2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 DLBCL and PMBCL  
 
Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) are a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative 
malignancies with differing patterns of behavior and responses to treatment.  The 
prognosis depends on the histologic type, stage, and response to therapy.  The NHLs can 
be divi ded into two prognostic groups: the indolent lymphomas and the aggressive 
lymphomas.  In Western populations, the majority of NHL (~85%) are of B -cell origin. 
NHL is a significant medical problem.  Last year, the American Cancer Society estimated 
that 71,8 50 persons were diagnosed with NHL, and despite recent advances in therapy, 
19,790 died from this disease (Siegel et al. 2016) .  Diffuse large B -cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) in itself is recognized to be an aggressive B -cell NHL, often presents clinically 
in a more symptomatic manner than indolent lymphoma, but a considerable number of 
these patients can be cured using intensive combinatio n chemotherapy regimens.  The 
standard treatment for patients with aggressive lymphoma who do not obtain a complete 
response with frontline treatment —or for those who relapse — is intensive salvage

 chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).  Not all patients are 
suitable candidates for this aggressive treatment option.  In addition, relapsed or 
progressive disease after auto -SCT occurs in more than 50% of patients with NHL (Philip 
et al. 1995) ; for these patients, prognosis is poor, with a median overall survival of 7 to 
11 months (Paltiel et al. 2003) .  Currently there is no consensus treatment for patients 
who have relapsed or refractory disease after auto -SCT.  
DLBCL is comprised of two major molecular subtypes: germinal center B cell -like 
(GCB) DLBCL and activated B cell -like (ABC) DLBCL (Alizadeh et al. 2000) .  All 
DLBCL lymphomas express the BCR on their cell surface and ABC DLBCLs rely on B -
cell recept or (BCR) signaling for their survival.  Downstream of the BCR are critical 
transducers that regulate DLBCL pathogenesis.  These include proximal BCR signaling 
effectors SYK, BTK, BLNK, PLCγ2, PI3Kδ and PKCβ.  The pathways downstream of 
the BCR include the PI3K -AKT -mTOR signaling pathway, which provides a direct 
conduit from diverse stimuli, including cell surface receptors and metabolic changes 
within the cell, to downstream pathways affecting cellular growth, size, survival and 
angiogenesis (Yuan and Cantley 2008) . Therefore, the targeting of the PI3K -AKT -mTOR 
has strong rationale.  
Primary mediastinal B -cell lymphoma (PMBCL), originally described in the 1980s, 
accounts for up to 10% of DLBCL.  It is epidemiologically, clinically, and biologically 
distinct from the other subtypes of DLBCL (GCB].  Similar to nodular sclerosing 
Hodgkin lymphoma arising in the mediastinum, it is likely derived from a thymic B cell 
and typically presents in adolescents and young adults with an anterior mediastinal mass, 
which may invade local structures.  Studies of gene expression profiling demonstrate a 
significant overlap between PMBCL and nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma.  In fact, 
PMBCL shares a third of its genes with NSHL (Rosenwald et al. 2003) .  Among the most 
common genetic alterations in PMBCL are abnormalities on chromosome 9p (up to 75%) 
and 2p (approximately 50%).  Although these abnormalities have been described in 
NSHL, they are t ypically not found in the other DLBCL subtypes.  The 9p region 
encodes Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), which then activates the transcription factor signal 
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 6 through phosphorylation (Rosenwald 
et al. 2003) .  Also, in the 9p region, programmed death ligands (PD -L) 1 and 2 are 
rearranged at a frequency of 20% (Twa et al. 2014) , which higher than what is seen in 
other subtypes of DLBCL.  
The optimal therapeutic approach to PMBCL is controversial, with a paucity of 
prospective studies.  PMBCL is frequently treated like other DLBCL subtypes.  The cure 
rate for progressive or recurrent disease after primary therapy is low.  Across the disease  
spectrum, relapsed/refractory NHL continues to represent an unmet medical need.  Given 
the few treatment options available for patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma, 
novel therapies providing clinical benefit are needed.  Treatment with convention al 
cytotoxic chemotherapy results in promising responses, however a great majority of 
subjects relapse due to emergence of molecularly resistant clones.  Evasion of the host 
immune responses is an important mechanism for inducing resistance to cancer thera py 
(Schreiber et al. 2011) .  Over the last several years, drug development in oncology has 
seen the emergence of immune therapies.  Strategies to block molecular and cellular 
mediators of cancer induced immunosuppression such as Cytotoxic T -Lymphocyte

 Antigen 4 (CTLA4, CD152), Programmed Death -1 receptor (PD -1, CD279) or T 
regulatory cells (T reg) have been explored both in solid and hematologic malignancies 
with some success.  
 
Tumor cells up regulate expression of the immune check point receptors (ICR) such as 
CTLA4, PD -1 and the ligands (PD -L1, B7 -H1/CD274) ICR which effectively attenuates 
the T -cell proliferation and anti -tumor effects.  While the necessary machinery for an 
effective antitumor immune response is present in lymphoma patients, the immune 
response appears ineffective and most lymphomas escape immune surveillance and 
progress.  In prior work (Wilcox et al. 2009a; Wilcox et al. 2009b; Yang et al. 2012; 
Yang et al. 2006) , we have shown th at the tumor microenvironment is highly 
immunosuppressive due to the presence of regulatory T (Treg) cells, suppressive 
monocytes and immunosuppressive cytokines.  Furthermore, we have found that PD -
L1/PD -1 signaling is a dominant mechanism accounting for immune suppression present 
in the tumor microenvironment (see Figure 1) (Wilcox et al. 2009a; Yang et al. 2012) .  
PD-1 immune check point inhibition has been shown to result in up regulation of genes 
associated wit h effector, NK cell function and cytolytic effects (Keir et al. 2008) .  The 
cardinal biological effects of PD -1 immune check point inhibition are manifested by 
reversal of exhaustive CD8+T cells, averting depletion of memory B cells, depleting 
Foxp3+iTreg cells and restoring robust Th1 immunity (Keir et al. 2008) .  Targeting PD -
1immune check points has the potential to play a major role in cancer therapy by 
reversing tumor immune escape.

 2.2 CTEP IND Agents  
 
2.2.1 Nivolumab  
Nivolumab is a fully human, IgG4(ⱪ) isotype mAb that binds PD -1 on activated immune 
cells and disrupts engagement of the receptor with its ligands PD -L1(B7 -H1/CD274) and 
PD-L2 (B7 -DC/CD273), abrogating the inhibitory signals and augmenting host antitumor 
immune response (Keir et al. 2008) .  Nivolumab has demonstrated efficacy in solid and 
hematological malignancies (Ansell et al. 2015; Brahmer et al. 2012) .  In early phase 
trials in hematologic malignancies, both nivolumab and pembrolizumab were found to be 
well tolerated and demonstrated clinical responses in various disease histologies.  In 
Hodgkin lymphoma patients, both agents were highly effective with very durable 
responses (Ansell et al. 2015) . In the nivolumab trial, an analysis of the responses seen in 
patients with other histological subtypes of lymphoma also showed clinically promising 
results (Lesokhin et al. 2014) .  While not quite as impressive as the results seen in the 
Hodgkin cohort, an overall response rate (ORR) in follicular lymphoma of 40% was seen.  
In patients with diffuse large B -cell lym phoma, 36% of patients responded to treatment.  
Though recent unpublished data from a phase 2 trial suggests a much lower ORR in 
DLBCL , in the low teens . A phase 1b multi -cohort trial in heavily pre -treated 
relapsed/refractory PMBCL using pembrolizumab showed that it was safe and active in 
these patients, with an ORR of 4 1% (7/17) (Zinzani et al. 2017) ; with a median follow -up 
of 11.3 months, median duration of response (DOR) was not reached.  
 
2.2.1.1  Nivolumab pharmacokinetics were assessed using a population PK approach, over a 
dose range of 0.1 to 20 mg/kg administered as a single dose or multiple doses as a 60 -
minute intravenous infusion every 2 or 3 weeks.  Nivolumab clearance decreases over 
time, with a mean maximal reduction (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) from 
baseline values of approximately 24.5% ( 47.6%) resulting in a geometric mean steady 
state clearance (CLss) (CV%) of 8.2 mL/h (53.9%); the decrease in CLss is not 
considered clinically relevant. The geometric mean volume of distribution at steady 
state (Vss) (CV%) is 6.8 L (27.3%), and geometric mean elimination half -life (t1/2) is 
25 days (77.5%). Steady -state concentrations of nivolumab were reached by 
approximately 12 weeks whenadministered at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and systemic 
accumulation was approximately 3.7 -fold. The exposure to nivolumab  increases dose 
proportionally over the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks. 
The predicted exposure of nivolumab after a 30 -minute infusion is comparable to that 
observed with a 60 -minute infusion.  Based on dose/exposure efficacy and safety 
relationships, there are no clinically significant differences in safety and efficacy 
between a nivolumab dose of 240 mg or 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks in patients with 
melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, urothelial carcinoma, MSI -H CRC, and HCC The 
population PK analy sis suggested that the following factors had no clinically 
important effect on the clearance of nivolumab: age weight, gender, race, baseline 
LDH, PD -L1 expression, solid tumor type, tumor size, renal impairment, and mild 
hepatic impairment.

 2.2.1.2  Rationale for Modification of the Dosage of Nivolumab After 8 Cycles  
 
Data obtained from manufacturer (Bristol -Myers Squibb) indicates that nivolumab 
administered as 480 mg Q4W over 30 -minutes is expected to offer the same clinical 
benefit as 3 mg/kg Q2W in subjects with melanoma, squamous non -small cell lung 
cancer (SQ NSCL C), non -squamous NSCLC (NSQ, NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), urothelial carcinoma 
(UC), and classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cHL).  This information is based upon data 
gathered in the course of the ext ensive nivolumab development program across multiple 
tumor types as well as robust clinical pharmacology and quantitative systems 
pharmacology (QSP) analyses.  
 
The proposed dose modification is based on the comprehensive understanding of 
nivolumab pharmacology and mechanism of action taken together with the following 
data and analyses:  
 
• Comparison of nivolumab exposures achieved by 240 mg Q2W, 480 mg Q4W and 3 
mg/kg Q2W in subjects with melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, SCCHN, cHL, and UC  
 
• Efficacy bridging evaluation  
o Comparison of the efficacy of nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W, 240 mg Q2W, and 
480 mg Q4W in melanoma, NSCLC, and RCC with respect to the following 
endpoints: overall survival(OS), objective response (OR)  
o Comparison of predicted receptor occupancy (RO) with nivolumab 3 mg/kg 
Q2W, 240 mg Q2W, and 480 mg Q4W, including sensitivity of RO to 
parameters that may vary across solid tumor types  
 
• Safety bridging evaluation  
o Assessment of safety margins, by comparison of predicted exposures with 240 
mg Q2W and 480 mg Q4W relative to the well -tolerated 10 mg/kg Q2W 
regimen  
o Comparison of the safety of nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W, 240 mg Q2W, and 480 
mg Q4W in subjects with melanoma, SQ and NSQ NSCLC, RCC, SCCHN, 
cHL, and UC with respect to the following 3 endpoints: Adverse events 
leading to discontinuation or death (AEDC/D), Grade  3+ adverse events (AE -
Grade 3+), and Grade 2+ immune -mediated adverse events (AE -IM Grade 2+)  
o Clinical safety data from subjects treated with nivolumab 480 mg Q4W 
administered over a 30 -minute infusion  
 
The exposure -response efficacy analysis between the 3 mg/kg Q2W and the 480 mg 
Q4W regimens demonstrated that the hazard ratios for survival with the 480 mg Q4W 
regimen are very similar to the 3 mg/kg Q2W regimen, resulting in a similar hazard ratio 
relati ve to the standard of care treatment studied in each respective phase 3 clinical trial. 
In addition, these analyses indicated that similar outcomes would be achieved when using 
an early efficacy measure of response rate (objective response; OR) as well.  T he 
exposure -efficacy response trends were consistent across different tumor types with

 varying tumor immunogenicity and mutational burdens.  Hence, in cases where 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W has been proven to be superior to standard of care, nivolumab 
480 mg Q4W is predicted to provide comparable benefit, irrespective of tumor type.  
 
This position is further supported by results of the analysis using a mechanistic 
quantitative systems pharmacology model incorporating transport to site of action, 
binding kinetics and varied physiological factors representing highly perfused or stromal 
tumors.  The median intratumoral RO predicted with this model is high for nivolumab 3 
mg/kg Q2W, 240 mg Q2W and 480 mg Q4W trough levels over a range of possible 
physiological parameter values.  It is postulated that high RO at the tumor site will 
initiate the immuno -stimulatory cascade resulting in similar efficacy with 3 mg/kg Q2W, 
240 mgQ2W, and 480 mg Q4W regimens.  
 
Safety bridging was conducted using robust clinical data for the 10 mg/kg Q2W regimen 
that had a similar safety profile to the 3 mg/kg Q2W regimen.  The nivolumab exposure 
parameters, including Cmax, resulting from 480 mg Q4W were well below Cmaxss 
values achieved with 10 mg/kg, providing a robust exposure safety margin. In addition, 
there were negligible differences in the probabilities of experiencing an adverse event 
irrespective of severity or adverse event type.  Moreover, key safety results from the 
interim safety analysis of CA209511 (Part 2) demonstrate that the safety profile of 
nivolumab 480 mg IV over 30 minutes Q4W is consistent with the established safety 
profile of nivolumab (240 mg Q2W or 3 mg/kg Q2W administered IV over 60 minutes) 
across mul tiple indications and Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC].  Taken 
together, these findings indicated that the safety profile of nivolumab is expected to be 
unaltered by the proposed dosing regimen changes.  
 
Based on extensive quantitative clinical pharmacology analyses and safety analyses 
summarized in this submission, the nivolumab 480 mg Q4W regimen administered over 
30 minutes is predicted to have similar efficacy and safety profiles to those established 
with the 3 mg/kg Q2W dosing regimen administered over 60 minutes. Thus, the provided 
analyses support the proposed nivolumab dosing regimen of 480 mg Q4W administered 
over 30 minutes as a convenient treatment option.  
 
Based on this information the dosage of Nivolumab will be 240 mg IV every 2 weeks for 
the first 8 cycles  on the study.  After 8 cycles , Nivolumab will be administered at the 
dose of 480 mg IV every 4 weeks. Both dosage strengths will be infused over 30 minutes.  
 
2.2.2 Copanlisib  (BAY 80 -6946)  
 
The B -cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway is critical for the development, 
proliferation, and survival of malignant B -cells.  Drugs targeting BCR pathway kinases, 
including the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib [2] and the phosphatidylinositol  
3-kinase (PI3K) -δ isoform inhibitor idelalisib [3], have proven to be effective treatment 
options in patients who have relapsed or are refractory to standard therapy.  However, 
fatal and/or serious toxicities have been associated with idelalisib use [3, 4 ] and, recently, 
NCI Protocol #:  10193  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Protocol Version Date:    July 13 , 2021 
 
14 
 frequent serious adverse events, including hepatic and gastrointestinal toxicity, colitis, 
opportunistic infections, autoimmune toxicities, and pneumonitis, have raised safety 
concerns around idelalisib in combination with standard therapies [5 –7].  Theref ore, new 
approaches, such as dual inhibition of PI3K -δ and PI3K -α, are necessary to both mitigate 
toxicity issues and improve efficacy [8 –10]. 
Copanlisib (BAY 80 -6946; Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany) is an intravenous pan -class I 
PI3K inhibitor with predominant activity against the PI3K -α and PI3K -δ isoform (Liu et 
al. 2013) .  A first -inhuman phase 1 study established the maximum tolerated dose of 
copanlisib as 0.8 mg/kg administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 -day cycle (Patnaik et 
al. 2016) .  In an expansion cohort including NHL patients, severe toxicities were low and 
there were early signs of efficacy, including complete response (CR) or partial response 
(PR) in all six patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma,  and one of three 
patients with DLBCL (Patnaik et al. 2016) .  A phase 2 study of copanlisib conducted in 
indolent and aggressive lymphomas (Dreyling et al. 2017) , the ORR w as 43.7% (14/32) 
in the indolent cohort and 27.1% (13/48) in the aggressive cohort  including mantle cell 
lymphoma, Peripheral T -cell lymphoma and DLBCL ; median progression -free survival 
(PFS) was 70 days (range, 0 –897) in the aggressive cohort with a median DOR of 166 
days (range, 0 –786).  In the 15  patient with DLBCL out of  a total of 34 patients with 
aggressive lymphomas , only 1 PR was seen with an ORR of 6.7% , Common adverse 
events included hyperglycemia (57.1%; grade ≥ 3, 23.8%), hypertension (54.8%; grade ≥ 
3, 40.5%), and diarrhea (40.5%; grade ≥ 3, 4.8%), all generally manageable. Neutropenia 
occurred in 28.6% of patients (grade 4, 11.9%) (Dreyling et al. 2017) . In a phase 2 study  
of 40 patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL after 1 or more lines of therapy, the ORR 
was 25%. Higher responses were seen in the ABC subtype (37.5%) as compared to the 
GCB subgroup (13.6%) (Lenz et al. 2017) . To date, there is no data with copan lisib in 
PMBCL.    
Copanlisib Pharmacokinetics:  
Copanlisib demonstrated dose -proportional increases in the plasma exposures (Cmax and 
[AUC( 0 25)] over the dose range of 0.1 to 1.2 mg/kg (absolute dose range: 5 to 93 mg) 
with a terminal elimination half -life of 39.1 h. There is no time -dependency and no 
accumulation in the pharmacokinetics of copanlisib. The recommended (Phase 2) and 
approved dose of monotherapy copanlisib is 60 mg given i.v. as a one hour IV infusion 
on an intermittent weekly schedule on days 1, 8 and 15 in a 3 weeks on/1 week off 
schedule.  
Copanlisib is eliminated predominantly via feces (64%; unchanged 30%) compared to 
urine (22%; unchanged 15%). Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that age, 
gender, race, smoking status, body weight, mild hepatic impairment, and mild to 
moderate rena l impairment had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
copanlisib and therefore no dose recommendation is needed for these specific 
populations. Based on the preliminary categorical analyses and the central tendency, 
copanlisib does n ot prolong the QT/QTc interval.  
 
Copanlisib metabolism is primarily mediated by CYP3A (>90%) with minor contribution 
NCI Protocol #:  10193  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Protocol Version Date:    July 13 , 2021 
 
15 
 of CYP1A1 (<10%).  Concomitant use of copanlisib with strong cytochrome P450 3A 
(CYP3A) inducers may decrease copanlisib AUC and should be avoided. Concomitant 
use of copanlisib with strong CYP3A inhibitors increases copanlisib AUC and a dosage 
reduction t o 45 mg is advised if patients required strong inhibitors. Copanlisib has low 
risk for clinical drug -drug interactions of concomitant drug products through inhibition or 
induction of CYP enzymes, inhibition of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 
(UGT) enzymes. Copanlisib is not an inhibitor of P -gp, BCRP, multi -drug resistance -
associated protein (MRP2), bile salt export pump (BSEP), OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT 
1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, and MATE1 at therapeutic 60 mg dose plasma concentrations. 
Copanlisib is an  inhibitor of MATE2 -K at therapeutic 60 mg dose plasma concentrations.  
Further details can be found in the latest available version of the investigator's brochure 
(2017), Which contains comprehensive information on the study drug and the United 
States Package Insert (USPI).  
 
2.3  Rationale for Combination  
 
In a preclinical mouse model, p110δ inactivation in regulatory T cells (Treg) unleashes 
CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and induces tumor regression (Ali et al. 2014) .  Thus, p110δ 
inhibitors can break tumor -induced immune tolerance.  In the A20 DLBCL syngeneic 
mouse model with tumor intrinsic regulation of the immunosuppressive environment, 
treatment with copanlisib resulted in effective down regulation of tumor ‐infiltrating Tregs 
and an increase of INFg+ CD44+ cells in tumors (Liu 2017) .  PR were observed in 75% 
of mice treated with copanlisib in combination with a surrogate anti ‐mouse PD ‐1 (aPD‐1, 
BioXCell) compared to 0% PR in the monotherapy groups.  These data support the 
rational for the combination of copanlisib and nivolumab in DLBCL.

must have failed front -line therapy and declined or are not candidates for autologous stem 
cell transplant (ASCT) or have failed prior ASCT.  
 
3.1.4 Age ≥ 18 years.

and nivolumab combination in patients <18 years of age, children are excluded from this 
study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.  However, if pediatric colleagues and 
centers are interested in including patients ages 12 to 18 in this trial, this trial the n could 
be available to this group of patients.

 3.1.8 Negative urine or serum pregnancy test for females of child bearing potential within 7 
days prior to registration.  
 
The effects of copanlisib and nivolumab  on the developing human fetus are unknown.  
For this reason, and because  the study drugs  used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, 
females of child -bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or 
barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study 
participation and for 5 months  after the last dose of study drug.  Males who are the sexual 
partners of a female of child -bearing potential must use any contraceptive method with a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year for the duration of study participation and for a 
period of 7 months  after the last dose of study drug.  These periods of required use of 
contraception have been calculated using the upper limit of the half -life for nivolumab 
(25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement that females of child -bearing 
potential use co ntraception for 5 month s and males who are the sexual partners of 
females of child -bearing potential use contraception for  7 months . 
 
Females must not breast -feeding  for 1 month after last dose . 
 
Females of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test 
(minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the 
start of nivolumab.  
 
A female of child -bearing potential is defined as any female who has experienced 
menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral 
oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal.  Menopause is defined clinically as 12 
months of amenorrhea in a female over 45 in the absence of other biological or 
physiological causes.  In addition, females under the age of 55 must have a documented 
serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU/mL.   
 
 Females who are not of childbearing potential ( i.e., who are postmenopausal or 
surgically sterile) and azoospermic males do not require contraception.   
 
Should a female of child -bearing potential become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant 
while she or her partner is participating in this study, she (or the participating partner) 
should inform the treating physician immediately.

those with 1 event that has resolved more than 1 year ago without recurr ence, or 
psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.  
 
3.2.13  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because copanlisib and nivolumab are  
agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.  Because there is an 
unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of 
the mother with copanlisib or nivolumab,  breastfeeding should be discontinued  for 1 
month after last dose  if the mother is treated with  copanlisib  or nivolumab.

 3.2.15  Patients with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might 
recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment 
including systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded.  These include but are not limi ted 
to patients with a history of immune related neurologic disease,  multiple sclerosis, 
autoimmune (demyelinating)  neuropathy, Guillain -Barre syndrome, myasthenia gravis; 
systemic autoimmune disease such as SLE, connective tissue diseases, scleroderma, 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn’s, ulcerative colitis, hepatitis; and patients 
with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens -Johnson syndrome, or 
phospholipid syndrome should be excluded because of the risk of recurrence or 
exacerbati on of disease.  Patients with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies including 
thyroiditis managed with replacement hormones including physiologic corticosteroids are 
eligible.  Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sjögren’s syndrome 
and p soriasis controlled with topical medication and patients with positive serology, such 
as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti -thyroid antibodies should be evaluated for the 
presence of target organ involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but 
should otherwise be eligible.  
 
3.2.16  Patients are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type 1 diabetes mellitus, residual 
hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, 
psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the  
absence of an external trigger (precipitating event).  However, Patients with uncontrolled 
Type I or II diabetes mellitus will be excluded; uncontrolled diabetes is defined as HbA1c 
>8.5%.  
 
3.2.17  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with 
either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive 
medications within 14 days of study drug administration.  Inhaled or topical steroids and 
adrenal replacement doses < 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the 
absence of active autoimmune disease.  Patients are permitted to use topical, ocular, intra -
articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption).  
Physiologic replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids are permitted, even if < 10 
mg/day prednisone equivalents.  A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis ( e.g., 
contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non -autoimmune conditions ( e.g., delayed -type 
hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted.  
 
3.2.18  Patients who have had evidence of active or acute diverticulitis, intra -abdominal abscess, 
and GI obstruction which are known risk factors for bowel perforation should be 
evaluated for the potential need for additional treatment before coming on study.  
 
3.2.19  Patients with other active malignancy ≤ 3  years prior to registration for which active 
treatment is required must be excluded.  Patients with composite lymphomas that have a 
non-B-cell component must be excluded.

 3.2.20  Copanlisib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4.  Therefore, the concomitant use of 
strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, 
indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir), and strong inducers of CYP3A4  (e.g. rifampin, 
phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John’s Wort) are not permitted from 14 
days prior to enrollment until the end of the study.   
Note:  Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to 
regularly consult a frequently -updated medical reference.  APPENDIX B (Patient Drug 
Information Handout and Wallet Card) should be provided to patients.  As part of the 
enrollmen t/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of 
interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or 
if the patient is considering a new over -the-counter medicine or herbal product.  
Other medications that are prohibited while on copanlisib treatment:  
• Herbal medications/preparations (except for vitamins)  
• Anti-arrhythmic therapy other than beta blockers or digoxin  
For the list of specific medications prohibited while on copanlisib treatment refer to the

3.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
 
NIH policy requires that women and members of minority groups and their 
subpopulations be included in all NIH -supported biomedical and behavioral research 
projects involving NIH -defined clinical research unless a clear and compelling rationale 
and justific ation establishes to the satisfaction of the funding Institute & Center (IC) 
Director that inclusion is inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects or the 
purpose of the research.  Exclusion under other circumstances must be designated by the 
Director, NIH, upon the recommendation of an IC Director based on a compelling 
rationale and justification.  Cost is not an acceptable reason for exclusion except when 
the study would duplicate data from other sources.  Women of childbearing potential 
shou ld not be routinely excluded from participation in clinical research.  Please see

(OPEN).  OPEN is a web -based registration system available to users on a 24/7 basis.  It 
is integrated with the CTSU Enterprise System for regulatory and roster data inter change 
and with the Theradex Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) for retrieval of patient 
registration/randomization assignment.  Patient enrollment data entered by Registrars in 
OPEN / IWRS will automatically transfer to the NCI’s clinical data managem ent system, 
Medidata Rave.  
 
The OPEN  system will provide the site with a printable confirmation of registration and 
treatment information.   Please print this confirmation for your records.   
 
4.2.6 OPEN/IWRS User Requirements  
 
OPEN/IWRS users must meet the following requirements:  
• Have a valid CTEP -IAM account ( i.e., CTEP username and password).  
• To enroll patients or request slot reservations:  Be on an ETCTN Corresponding 
or Participating Organization roster with the role of Registrar. Registrars must 
hold a minimum of an AP registration type.     
• Have regulatory approval for the conduct of the study at their site.  
 
Prior to accessing OPEN/IWRS, site staff should verify the following:

 5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Agent Administration  
 
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.   The study drugs will be 
administered in sequence, copanlisib must be administered before nivolumab.  Do not 
administer study drugs concurrently.  For patients receiving both drugs, the intravenous 
catheter must be flushed with  0.9% sodium chloride between the two infusions.  Pre-
medication is not needed unless a patient develops an infusion reaction.  
 
Reported adverse events and potential risks are described in Section 7.  Appropriate dose 
modifications are described in Section 6.  No investigational or commercial agents or 
therapies other than those described below may be administered with the intent t o treat 
the patient's malignancy.  
 
5.1.1 Copanlisib  
 
Copanlisib is administered by the 1 hour IV infusion weekly for 3 weeks (days 1, 8, and 
15) of each 28 -day cycle.  Copanlisib dose will be determined using a safety cohort in 6 
patients with Copanlisib 60 mg weekly days 1,8,15 with Nivolumab 240 mg  IV on days 1 
and 15 each cycle.  Copanlisib could be reduced to 45 mg if toxicity was observed with 
the combination, and the safety cohort will be re -evaluated  (Investigator’s Brochure, 
2016).   Cycle 9 and beyond treatment will be given as follows:  Copanlisib: Days 1and 
15 of each cycle Nivolumab (N) will be given IV day 1 only starting at 480 mg flat dose.  
 
Cycle 1, Day 1 (C1D1)  
The following assessments should be performed on Cycle 1, Day 1 before receiving study 
treatment unless otherwise specified.  
• On Cycle 1 Day 1, patients are not required to be fasting prior to the pre -dose 
glucose measurement.   
 
• Glucose will be measured at pre -dose and p ost dose  1 hour and 2 hours after the 
end of copanlisib infusion, ( window of  10 min is allowed except for the pre -
dose measurement). Additional measurements to be performed at the clinic as 
clinically indicated.  
 
NOTE: If patient needs to take a meal, then glucose test should be take prior to meal 
intake.  
 
Subsequent visits after C1D1 visit  
 
Fasting is not required prior to pre -dose glucose measurement.  
 
NCI Protocol #:  10193  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Protocol Version Date:    July 13 , 2021

 • Glucose will be measured at pre -dose and p ost dose  1 hour after the end of 
copanlisib infusion  (window of  10 min is allowed except for the pre -dose 
measurement) . Additional measurements to be performed at the clinic as 
clinically indicated.  
 
• Review of the blood glucose measurements/meal timing/insulin 
administration/oral glucose lowering medication, if applicable.  
• Note: If patient needs to take a meal, then glucose test should be taken prior to 
meal intake.  
 
The requirements for fasting and pre -dose glucose levels are presented in Table 5.1.

Consultation with treating physician or diabetes/endocrinologist is 
advised.  
 
b: The decision regarding meal timing and fasting can be made by the 
investigator based on glucose response patterns during prior treatment 
days  
 
• Fasting refers to a ≥ 8 h fast.  
• Non-fasting status includes any caloric intake such as meals and also  juice, snacks, 
and other caloric intake not consistently called a meal.

Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Protocol Version Date:    July 13 , 2021 
 
29 
 From Cycle 1 Day 1 onwards, glucose measurements at the site may be done either by 
laboratory analysis or in capillary blood.  
Because of inhibitory effect on PI3K α-isoform, which is implicated in insulin 
metabolism, copanlisib infusions could be associated with temporarily increase in blood 
glucose. Addition of meal in close proximity to copanlisib infusion may exacerbate 
glucose increase.  
On infusion days , a low carbohydrate diet is recommended,  the timing and content of 
caloric  meal intake and additional glucose testing (if clinically indicated) is managed and 
monitored by the investigators based on glucose response patterns during prior treatment 
days.  
All glucose measurements done at the site, oral glucose lowering medication and/or 
insulin administration, if applicable, fasting/non -fasting status  and meal intake timing on 
infusion days will be collected as part of the clinical source documentation.  
 
 
The use of corticosteroids as antiemetics prior to copanlisib administration is not allowed. 
After administration, flush the line with 0.9 % sodium chloride to ensure complete dose is 
given. No IV glucose preparations should be administered on the days of infusion.  
 
5.1.2 Nivolumab  
 
Nivolumab will be given intravenously at a dose of 240 mg on days 1 and 15 of each 28 -
day cycle for cycles 1 through 8 and at a dose of 480 mg on day 1 of cycle 9 and all 
subsequent cycles.  
 
Nivolumab is to be administered as a 30-minute IV infusion, using a volumetric pump  
with a 0.2 -1.2 micron in -line filter at the protocol -specified dose. Fixed dose (eg, 240 mg, 
360 mg, or 480 mg flat dose) nivolumab injection can be infused undiluted or diluted 
with 0.9% normal saline so as not to exceed a total infusion volume of 1 60 mL.  It is not 
to be administered as an IV push or bolus injection. At the end of the infusion, flush the 
line with a sufficient quantity of normal saline.  
 
5.1.3  Safety Cohort  
 
No dose escalation will be utilized, but a saf ety run -in of 6 patients with DLBCL or 
PLBCL  will be enrolled to evaluate the safety of the treatment combination.  Patients will 
be enrolled to receive 60 mg of Copanlisib and 240 mg IV of Nivolumab as per the dose 
schedule in Table 5.1 .3

480 mg on day 1 only of all subsequent cycles thereafter  
 
5.1.3.1 Six patients will be treated at the planned dose and observed for a minimum of 28 days 
before accruing the rest of the patients.  If no DLTs are observed (as per section 5.24) the 
study will open to complete accrual.  If at least 2 of 6 patients ex perience a DLT, then 6 
patients will be accrued at the -1 dose level and observed for a minimum of 28 days.  If at 
least 2 of 6 patients at the -1 dose level experience a DLT, this study will cease accrual.  
If 1 or less patients experience a DLT at the -1 dose level, the study will open to complete 
accrual.  If 1 or less patients experience DLTs at dose level 1, the study will open to 
complete accrual.   
 
5.1.3.3 Definitions of DLT  
 
A DLT is defined by the occurrence of any of the following toxicities (CTCAE v. 5) 
within the first cycle of treatment of dose escalation cohorts, which is possibly, probably, 
or definitely related to copanlisib and/or nivolumab in order to evaluate potential toxicity 
related treatment delays or any event within the first cycle of trea tment that requires 
permanent discontinuation of copanlisib, and/or nivolumab.  
 
5.1.3.3.1  Non-Hematological DLT  
 
Any Grade 3 or Grade 4 non -hematological toxicity that is possibly, probably or 
definitely attributable to the treatment regimen is considered a DLT, including the 
following:  
o Non-hematologic toxicity that causes a delay of >14 days in initiating cycle 2.  
o Any type of grade 3 -4 hypersensitivity reaction (i.e.: allergic reaction, 
anaphylaxis, serum sickness, skin disorders, etc.), regardless of attribution, that 
necessitate discontinuation of study drug.  
o Any type of grade 3 -4 immune related adverse event including skin reactions.  
o Grade 3 or greater colitis and bowel perforation  
o Grade 3 ALT/AST elevation or 10 x ULN  
o Grade 3 -4 pneumonitis  
o Grade 4 hyperglycemia: persistent post -infusion grade 4 hyperglycemia despite 
optimal glucose lowering therapy in consultation with an endocrinologist. 
Definition of persistent occurrence is based on repeated fasting blood glucose 
measurement following tre atment with copanlisib.  
 
 
5.1.3.3.2 The following events are exclusions and are NOT considered a DLT for this protocol, 
NCI Protocol #:  10193  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Protocol Version Date:    July 13 , 2021 
 
31 
 regardless of attribution or specific type:  
o Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or oral mucositis with < 3 days duration  
o Grade 3 fever  
o Grade 3 infection  
o Grade 3 peripheral sensory neuropathy that is decreased by at least one grade 
within 7 days  
o Grade 3 hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia 
responsive (i.e.: decreased by at least one grade) to oral supplementation within 7 
days 
o Grade 3 hypertriglyceridemia that returns to < Grade  2 prior to the beginning of 
cycle 2  
• Grade 3 hyperglycemia that returns to < Grade 2 (with or without the use of insulin or 
oral diabetic agents) prior to the beginning of cycle 2 . Transient infusion -related 
hyperglycemia lasting < 7 days are also excluded.  
 
5.2 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Because there is a potential for interaction of copanlisib and nivolumab with other 
concomitantly admini stered drugs, the case report form must capture the concurrent use 
of all other drugs, over -the-counter medications, or alternative therapies.   
 
The Principal Investigator should be alerted if the patient is taking any agent known to 
affect or with the potential for drug interactions. The known potential targets for drug 
interaction are CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors, as well as drugs modulating MAT E2K 
function. APPENDIX B (Patient Drug Information Handout and Wallet Card) should be 
provided to patients.  
• Sensitive substrates of the renal drug transporter MATE2K ( e.g. metformin) need 
to be used with caution. Metformin should be interrupted for 48 hours after 
receiving iodinated contrast media. Please see prescribing information for further 
information.  
• Patients taking medications with narrow therapeutic index should be proactively 
monitored if these medications cannot be avoided. These medications may 
include quinidine, cyclosporine, and digoxin.  
• Systemic corticosteroid therapy at a daily dose higher than 1 0 mg prednisone or 
equivalent is not permitted while on study. Previous corticosteroid therapy must 
be stopped or reduced to the allowed dose at least 7 days prior to the CT/MRI 
screening. If a patient is on chronic corticosteroid therapy, corticosteroids s hould 
be de -escalated to the maximum allowed dose before the screening. Patients may 
be using topical or inhaled corticosteroids. Short -term (up to 7 days) systemic 
corticosteroids above 1 0 mg p rednisolone or equivalent will be allowed for the 
management of acute conditions ( e.g., treatment non -infectious pneumonitis). The 
use of corticosteroids as antiemetics prior to copanlisib administration will not be 
allowed.  
• Patients should stop using herbal medications at least 7 days prior to the first dose 
of copanlisib. Herbal medications include, but are not limited to: St. John’s Wort, 
NCI Protocol #:  10193  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Protocol Version Date:    July 13 , 2021 
 
32 
 Kava, ephedra, gingko biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), yohimbe, saw 
palmetto, black cohosh and ginseng.  
• Patients with NHL, particularly after several lines of therapy are at risk for 
opportunistic infections.  Patients will be monitored symptomatically very closely 
at every visit prior to each cycle. If any symptoms were to arise suggestive of an 
opportunist ic infection, evaluation guided by the presenting symptom will be 
initiated immediately such as chest X -ray, CT scan of the chest and bronchoscopy 
if needed. Appropriate supportive care measures and antibiotic coverage will be 
started.  
 
 
5.3 Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s) , treatment may continue for a 
maximum of 2 years or until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
• Disease progression  
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study  
 
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable 
for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
 
• Clinical progression  
 
• Patient non -compliance  
 
• Pregnancy  
 
o All women of child bearing  potential should be instructed to contact the 
investigator immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed 
or late menstrual period) at any time during study participation.  
 
o The investigator must immediately notify CTEP in the event of a confirmed 
pregnancy in a patient participating in the study.  
 
• Termination of the study by sponsor  
 
• The drug manufacturer can no longer provide the study agent  
 
The reason(s) for protocol therapy discontinuation , the reason(s) for  study removal , and 
the corresponding dates must be documented in the Case Report Form (CRF).

5.4 Duration of Follow Up  
 
Patients will be followed for 100 days after removal from study or until death, whichever 
occurs first.  Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse event(s) will be 
followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.  
 
 
6. Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications for Copanlisib and Nivolumab  
 
Below are dose modification tables applicable to all patients participating in this study for 
the following adverse events.   
 
Patients who develop adverse events while being treated must have one or both drugs 
held or discontinued according to the guidance provided in the tables below.   
 
Please use as written and contact the drug monitor for any proposed changes.  Note that if 
a patient experiences several adverse events and there are conflicting recommendations, 
the investigator should use the recommended treatment modification for the mo st serious 
event that has a higher level of modification, i.e. going off study treatment versus holding 
drug.  
 
Dose hold = study drugs must be held  as indicated .  Day 1 of the next cycle is given when the 
patient meets the protocol criteria to restart drugs.  The current cycle will include all days until 
the patient resumes treatment and may be longer than 28 days.

 Distinguishing inflammatory pneumonitis 
is often a diagnosis of exclusion for 
patients who do not respond to antibiotics 
and have no causal organism identified 
including influenza.  Most patients with 
respiratory failure or hypoxia will be 
treated with ste roids.  Bronchoscopy may 
be required and analysis of lavage fluid for 
lymphocytic predominance may be 
helpful.  Patients with new lung nodules 
should be evaluated for sarcoid like 
granuloma.  Please consider 
recommending seasonal influenza killed 
vaccine f or all patients.  The investigator is requested to 
differentiate between non -
infectious pneumonitis, and 
infectious pneumonitis (viral, 
bacterial, or fungal), aspiration 
pneumonitis, or other 
pneumonitis clearly not due to a 
potential hypersensitivity 
reaction to the copanl isib 
infusion; and provide the basis 
for his/her assessment that it is 
infectious or other, as 
appropriate.  The investigator is 
requested to report with the 
most specific clinical terms to 
describe the condition, not 
simple “pneumonitis”.

Patients with grade 3 thyroiditis and skin rash may continue therapy with resolution and 
stable replacement treatment.  
 
Patients with thyroiditis or hypopituitarism who are stable as above may be restarted with 
replacement hormones including thyroid hormone and physiologic doses of 
corticosteroids.  
 
Please note that grading and for hypophysitis with symptoms of headache, visual or 
neurologic changes or radiologic evidence of pituitary enlargement and other CNS events 
such as aseptic meningitis or encephalitis should be considered grade 3 events.  
Any patients who require additional immune suppressive treatment beyond steroids 
should go off study treatment . 
 
Patients requiring > two dose delays for the same event should go off protocol therapy.  
 
Prior to starting corticosteroids or hormone replacement for any reason, appropriate 
endocrine testing including cortisol, ACTH, TSH and T4 must be obtained to document 
baseline.  
 
Please note that in some cases the treatment algorithms recommend steroids if symptoms 
do not resolve in 7 days.  However, this recommendation is not meant to delay steroid 
treatment at any time it is clinically indicated.   
 
Patients may be dose -delayed for evaluation and restarted depending on results.  
Any patient started on corticosteroids initially who is determined to not require steroid 
treatment for an autoimmune adverse event may resume therapy after a 2 week 
observation period without further symptoms at the discretion of the PI or investigator.

6.1 Dose Modification rules for transient post -infusion hyperglycemia  
 
Patients who develop transient post -infusion glucose>250  mg/dL after study drug administration 
may continue treatment.  However, the next infusion must be delayed until the patient’s pre -
infusion glucose level s return to <160  mg/dL (fasting) or <200  mg/dL (non -fasting).  Guidelines 
for the management of transient glucose increases are given in APPENDIX D and APPENDIX  
E.  Continuing  occurrence of post -infusion blood glucose >400 mg/dL, based on repeated 
laboratory analysis despite optimal glucose lowering therapy after 2 infusions of copanlisib,  will 
require dose reduction by one dose level.  
• Further dose reduction (where appropriate per study design/population)  is allowed as 
long as discontinuation criteria was not met.  
• Dose re -escalation is allowed when a patient has achieved controlled glucose levels per 
investigator’s judgment.  
• Persistent occurrence of post -infusion blood glucose >400 mg/dL based on laboratory 
analysis which occurred at the lowest dose level despite optimal glucose lowering therapy 
(after at least one cycle of treatment) with consultation of a diabetes specialist  requires 
permanent discontinuation of the study drug.  
 
6.2 Treatment of blood pressure increases associated with copanlisib  
 
It is important that patients with pre -existing arterial hypertension adhere to their regular 
medication schedule and take their usual doses on the days of study drug infusion.  
The management of acute blood pressure (BP) increases following copanlisib will need to be 
individualized for each patient, but experience from a Bayer -sponsored phase 1 study with 
NCI Protocol #:  10193  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Protocol Version Date:    July 13 , 2021 
 
44 
 copanlsisib has suggested the benefit of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers ( i.e., 
amlodipine, felodipine).  Topical nitrates and non -dihydropyridine should also be considered.   
Addition of non -dihydropyridine can be considered because of low significant clinical DDI 
potential with these drugs based on results with itraconozole data   In general, it is advisable for 
sites to be prepared, so that anti -hypertensive medication is readily available in case of need.  
In the event of the occurrence of arterial hypertension ≥150/90 mmHg during infusion of 
copanlisib at any cycle, antihypertensive treatment is suggested.  In the event of the occurrence of 
grade 3 arterial hypertension (≥160/100 mmHg) during infusion of co panlisib, the infusion should 
be interrupted and anti -hypertensive treatment as suggested above is administered.  Infusion can 
be resumed when BP has returned to <150/90 mmHg.  
Blood pressure measurement on treatment days  
Blood pressure will be measured every 5 -10 min prior to each copanlisib dose (no more than 4 
measurements) until there are two consecutive results <150/90 mmHg.  If blood pressure is ≥ 
150/90 mmHg, the investigator can consider a medical intervention or de laying the infusion of 
study drug. The patient should rest for 5 -10 min before blood pressure is recorded.  
On infusion days, blood pressure will be measured at 0 hour (pre -dose), 30 min (mid -infusion), 60 
min (end of infusion), and 1 hour and 2 hours after the end of infusion .  
NOTE : A window of ±10 min is allowed for all BP measurements, except for pre -dose (0 hour) 
measurement.  
 
7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section s 7.2 and 
7.3) will determine whether the event requires expedited  reporting via the CTEP Adverse Event 
Reporting System (CTEP -AERS) in addition  to routine  reporting.

BMS -936558 (Nivolumab, MDX -1106, NSC 748726)  
 
The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of 
reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform 
presentation of events by body system. In addition to the comprehensive list,  a subset, the 
Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and 
is identified with bold and italicized text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are 
protocol specific exceptions to expedited repo rting to NCI (except as noted below). Refer to the 
'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf  for 
further clarification. Frequency is provided based on 2069 patients. Below is the CAEPR for 
BMS -936558 (Nivolumab, MDX -1106).  
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in parentheses 
next to the AE in the SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple 
investigational agents and has an AE listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades 
to determine if expedited reporting is required.

 2Pericardial tamponade may be related to possible inflammatory reaction at tumor site.  
 
3 Nivolumab being a member of class of agents involved in the inhibition of “immune 
checkpoints”, may result in severe and possibly fatal immune -mediated adverse events probably 
due to T -cell activation and proliferation.  This may result in autoimmune disor ders that can 
include (but are not limited to) autoimmune hemolytic anemia, acquired anti -factor VIII immune 
response, autoimmune aseptic meningitis, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune nephritis, 
autoimmune neuropathy, autoimmune thyroiditis, bullous pemph igoid, exacerbation of Churg -
Strauss Syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia systemic symptoms [DRESS] syndrome, facial 
nerve disorder (facial nerve paralysis), limbic encephalitis, hepatic failure, pure red cell aplasia, 
pancreatitis, ulcerative and hemorrh agic colitis, endocrine disorders (e.g., autoimmune 
thyroiditis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, autoimmune hypophysitis/hypopituitarism, 
thyrotoxicosis, and adrenal insufficiency), sarcoid granuloma, myasthenia gravis, polymyositis, 
and Guillain -Barre sy ndrome.  
 
4Pancreatitis may result in increased serum amylase and/or more frequently lipase.  
 
5Cytokine release syndrome may manifest as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis with 
accompanying fever and pancytopenia.  
 
6Complications including hyperacute graft -versus -host disease (GVHD), some fatal, have 
occurred in patients receiving allo stem cell transplant (SCT) after receiving Nivolumab.  These 
complications may occur despite intervening therapy between receiving Niv olumab and allo -
SCT.  
 
7Infusion reactions, including high -grade hypersensitivity reactions which have been observed 
following administration of nivolumab, may manifest as fever, chills, shakes, itching, rash, 
hypertension or hypotension, or difficulty breathing during and immedi ately after administration 
of nivolumab.

event currently known to be caused by the other agent, or the combination may result in events 
never previously associated with either agent.  
 
 
 
7.2 Adverse Event Characteristics  
 
• CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
4 will be utilized for AE reporting.  All appropriate treatment areas should have access to 
a copy of the CTCAE version  4.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4 can be downloaded 
from the CTEP web site 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 
• For expedited reporting purposes only:   
- AEs for the agent  that are bold and italicized  in the CAEPR ( i.e., those listed in the 
SPEER column, Section 7.1.1) should be reported through CTEP -AERS only if the 
grade is above the grade provided in the SPEER.  
- Other AEs for the protocol  that do not require expedited reporting are outlined in 
section 7.3.4.  
 
NCI Protocol #:  10193  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Protocol Version Date:    July 13 , 2021 
 
54 
 • Attribution  of the AE:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
 
• PRO -CTCAE is not intended for expedited reporting, real time review or safety 
reporting.  
 
- . 
Expedited Adverse Event Reporting  
 
7.2.1 Expedited AE reporting for this study must use CTEP -AERS  (CTEP Adverse Event 
Reporting System), accessed via the CTEP Web site ( https://eapps -
ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers ).  The reporting procedures to be followed are presented in the 
“NCI Guidelines for Investigators: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements for DCTD 
(CTEP and CIP) and DCP INDs and IDEs” which can be downloaded from the CTEP 
Web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.htm
).  These requirements are briefly outlined in the tables below (Section 7.3.3).  
 
In the rare occurrence when Internet connectivity is lost, a 24 -hour notification is to be 
made to CTEP by telephone at 301 -897-7497.  Once Internet connectivity is restored, the 
24-hour notification phoned in must be entered electronically into CTEP -AERS  by the 
original submitter at the site.  
 
7.2.2 Distribution of Adverse Event Reports  
 
CTEP -AERS  is programmed for automatic electronic distribution of reports to the 
following individuals:  Principal Investigator and Adverse Event Coordinator (s) (if 
applicable) of the Corresponding Organization  or Lead Organization , the local treating 
physician, and the Reporter and Submitter .  CTEP -AERS  provides a copy feature for 
other e -mail recipients.  
 
7.2.3 Expedited Reporting Guidelines  
 
Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID assigned during trial 
registration on all reports.  
 
Note:  A death on study requires both  routine and expedited reporting , regardless of 
causality.  Attribution to treatment or other cause must be provided.  
 
 
Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Disease progression” in 
the system organ class (SOC) “General disorders and administration site conditions.”  
NCI Protocol #:  10193  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Protocol Version Date:    July 13 , 2021 
 
55 
  
Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease ( e.g., radiological 
changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a 
disease process) should be submitted.  
 
 
Phase 1 and Early Phase 2 Studies:  Expedited Reporting Requirements for Adverse 
Events that Occur on Studies under an IND/IDE within 30 Days of the Last Administration 
of the Investigational Agent/Intervention 1, 2 
FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR 
Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY Serious Adverse 
Events, whether or not they are considered related to the investigational 
agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization for ≥ 24 hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
interve ntion to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 
312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
 
ALL  SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST be immediately reported to 
the NCI via electronic submission within the timeframes detailed in the table below.  
Hospitalization Grade 1 and Grade 2 Timeframes  Grade 3 -5 
Timeframes  
Resulting in 
Hospitalization  
≥ 24 hrs  10 Calendar Days

Hospitalization  
≥ 24 hrs  Not required  
NOTE:   Protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting of serious adverse events are found 
in the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER) portion of the CAEPR.  
Expedited AE reporting timelines are defined as:  
o “24-Hour; 5 Calendar Days” - The AE must initially be submitted electronically within 
24 hours of learning of the AE, followed by a complete expedited report within 5 
calendar days of the initial 24 -hour report.  
NCI Protocol #:  10193  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Protocol Version Date:    July 13 , 2021 
 
56 
 o “10 Calendar Days” - A complete expedited report on the AE must be submitted 
electronically within 10 calendar days of learning of the AE.  
1Serious adverse events that occur more than 30 days after the last administration of 
investigational agent/intervention and have an attribution of possible, probable, or definite 
require reporting as follows:  
Expedited 24 -hour notification followed by complete report within 5 calendar days for:  
• All Grade 3, 4, and Grade 5 AEs  
Expedited 10 calendar day reports for:  
• Grade 2 AEs resulting in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
2For studies using PET or SPECT IND agents, the AE reporting period is limited to 10 
radioactive half -lives, rounded UP to the nearest whole day, after the agent/intervention was 
last administered.  Footnote “1” above applies after this reporting period.  
Effective Date:  May 5, 2011  
 
 
7.2.4 Additional Protocol -Specific Expedited Adverse Event Reporting Exclusions  
 
For this protocol only , the AEs/grades listed below do not require expedited reporting via 
CTEP -AERS .  However, they still must be reported through the routine reporting 
mechanism (Section 7.4):  
 
 
CTCAE SOC  Adverse Event  CTCAE Grade at 
which the event will 
not require 
expedited reporting1 
Investigations  Neutrophil count decreased  ≤ Grade 2 
Platelet count decreased  ≤ Grade 2 
White blood count  ≤ Grade 2 
Lymphocyte count decreased  ≤ Grade 4  
Blood and lymphatic system 
disorders  Anemia  ≤ Grade 2 
 
1. These exceptions only apply if the adverse event does not result in ≥24 hours hospitalization . 
 If the adverse event results in hospitalization, then the standard expedited adverse events 
reporting requirements must be followed.  
NCI Protocol #:  10193  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Protocol Version Date:    July 13 , 2021 
 
57 
 The following hospitalizations are not considered to be SAEs because there is no “adverse event” 
(i.e., there is no untoward medical occurrence) associated with the hospitalization:  
• Hospitalizations for respite care  
• Planned hospitalizations required by the protocol  
• Hospitalization planned before informed consent (where the condition requiring the 
hospitalization has not changed post study drug administration)  
• Hospitalization for elective procedures unrelated to the current disease and/or treatment on 
this trial  
• Hospitalization for administration of study drug or insertion of access for administration of 
study drug  
• Hospitalization for routine maintenance of a device ( e.g., battery replacement) that was in 
place before study entry  
• Hospitalization, or other serious outcomes, for signs and symptoms of progression of the 
cancer.  
 
7.3 Routine Adverse Event Reporting  
 
All Adverse Events must  be reported in routine study data submissions.  AEs reported 
expeditiously through CTEP -AERS  must also be reported in routine study data 
submissions.  
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are 
done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in 
future studies using similar agents.  AEs are reported in  a routine manner at scheduled times 
during the trial using Medidata Rave.  For this trial the  Adverse Event CRF  is used for routine 
AE reporting in Rave.  
 
7.4 Pregnancy  
 
Although not an adverse event in and of itself, pregnancy as well as its outcome must be 
documented via CTEP -AERS .  In addition, the Pregnancy Information Form  included within 
the NCI Guidelines for Adverse Event Reporting Requirements must be completed and 
submitted to CTEP.  Any pregnancy occurring in a patient or patient’s partner from the time of 
consent to 90 days after the last dose of study drug must be r eported and then followed for 
outcome.  Newborn infants should be followed until 30 days old.  Pl ease see the “NCI 
Guidelines for Investigators: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements for DCTD (CTEP and CIP) 
and DCP INDs and IDEs” (at http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/adverse_effects.htm ) 
for more details on how to report pregnancy and its outcome to CTEP.  
 
7.5 Secondary Malignancy  
 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a meta stasis of the initial neoplasm.  
 
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an 
NCI Protocol #:  10193  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Protocol Version Date:    July 13 , 2021 
 
58 
 NCI IND/IDE be reported expeditiously via CTEP -AERS .  Three options are available to 
describe the event:  
 
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia 
[AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be 
reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 
 
7.6 Second Malignancy  
 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a 
metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY routine AE 
reporting unless otherwise specified .

Description:  The powder is white to yellow solid substance.  
 
How Supplied:  Copanlisib is supplied by Bayer HealthCare AG and distributed by the 
Pharmaceutical Management Branch, CTEP, DCTD, NCI.  The agent is available as a 
lyophilized product containing 60 mg of copanlisib in a 6 mL injection vial.  The excipients 
are mannitol, sodium hydroxide, citric acid, and water for injection.  
 
Preparation:   Using appropriate aseptic technique, reconstitute the 60 mg vial of copanlisib 
with 4.4 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride resulting in a concentration of 15 mg/ml.  Gently 
shake well for 30 seconds and allow the vial to stand for 1 minute to let bubbles rise to the 
surface. Repeat if undissolved substance is still present. The reconstituted solution may be 
slightly yellow and should be clear prior to being withdrawn from the vial.   Withdraw the 
appropriate volume of the reconstituted solution and fu rther dilute by adding to a 50-200 mL 
0.9% sodium chloride bag. Mix well  by inverting .  
 
Storage: Store intact vials between 2°C and 8°C.  
 
If a storage temperature excursion is identified, promptly return copanlisib to between 
2°C and 8°C  and quarantine the supplies.  Provide a detailed report of the excursion 
(including documentation of temperature monitoring and duration of the excursion) to 
PMBAfterHours@mail.nih.gov  for determination of suitability.  
 
Stability:  Stability studies of the vials are ongoing.   The diluted solution should be used 
immediately (stored up to 4 hours at room temperature including preparation and 
administration).   If the diluted solution for infusion is not used immediately, it is stable for 
up to 24 hours refrigerated between 2°C and 8°C. It takes approximately 60 minutes for the 
100 mL diluted solution to return to room temperature after refrigeration.  The infus ion 
should be completed within 24 hours of preparation.  
 
CAUTION:  The single -use lyophilized dosage form contains no antibacterial 
preservatives.  Therefore, it is advised that the reconstituted product be discarded 6 hours 
after initial entry.  
 
Route  of Administration: IV infusion   
 
Method  of Administration:   The diluted solution for infusion is administered IV over 1 
hour. After administration, flush the line to ensure complete dose is given.  No IV glucose 
preparations should be administered on the days of infusion.  
 
Potential Drug Interactions:    
In vitro, copanlisib is metabolized primarily via CYP 3A4 and to a minor extent by 
CYP1A1.  It is also a substrate of P -gp and BCRP, but not a substrate of MATEs, OCTs, 
OATs, or OATPs. Concomitant administration with strong inhibitors or inducers of 
CYP3A4  should be avoided.  Use caution when administered with strong inhibitors and 
inducers of CYP1A1, P -gp, and BCRP.   Smoking tobacco may reduce drug exposure since

 tobacco induces CYP1A1 activity.  
 
In vitro, copanlisib is a strong inhibitor of MATE2K.  Copanlisib and its metabolite M -1 
have a low risk for inhibition or induction of CYP isoforms, inhibition of UGT isoforms, 
and inhibition of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase.  Copanlisib does not inhibi t P-gp, 
BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, bile salt export pump (BSEP), 
MRP2, or MATE1 at therapeutic 60 mg dose plasma concentrations. Use caution when 
administered with sensitive drug substrates of MATE2K.   
 
Copanlisib is not an inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A.  
 
Copanlisib and its metabolite M -1 have low protein binding.  
 
Special H andling:  Copanlisib is not genotoxic in vitro or in vivo.  Copanlisib is expected to 
adversely affect male and female reproduction.  
 
Patient Care Implications: . Females of child -bearing potential and male patients must use 
adequate contraception while receiving copanlisib and for 1 month after last dose of 
copanlisib.  Do not breastfeed during treatment with copanlisib and for at least 1 month after 
the last dose of copanlisib.  
 
Hypertension is frequently observed within the first 3 hours after start of infusion and 
hyperglycemia is frequently observed persisting for approximately 1 -3 days after study 
drug administration. Refer to protocol document for treatment and monitoring guidelines.

 differentiation 279 [CD279]) cell surface membrane receptor. PD -1 is a negative regulatory 
receptor expressed by activated T and B lymphocytes. Binding of PD -1 to its ligands, 
programmed death –ligand 1 (PD -L1) and 2 (PD -L2), results in the down -regulation of 
lymphocyte activation. Nivolumab inhibits the binding of PD -1 to PD -L1 and PD -L2.  
Inhibition of the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands promotes immune responses and 
antigen -specific T -cell responses to both foreign antigens as well as self -antige ns. 
 
Description:   Nivolumab Injection is a clear to opalescent, colorless to pale yellow liquid; 
light (few) particulates may be present. The drug product is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, single -
use, isotonic aqueous solution formulated in sodium citrate, sodium chloride, mann itol, 
diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (pentetic acid) and polysorbate 80 (Tween® 80), and 
water for injection.  Dilute solutions of hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may be 
used for pH adjustment (pH 5.5 -6.5). 
 
How Supplied:   Nivolumab is supplied by Bristol -Myers Squibb and distribu ted by the 
Pharmaceutical Management Branch, CTEP/DCTD/NCI as 100 mg vials (10 mg/mL) with 
a 0.7mL overfill.  It is supplied in 10 mL type I flint glass vials, with fluoropolymer film -
laminated  rubber stoppers and aluminum seals.  
 
Preparation:   Nivolumab injection can be infused  undiluted (10 mg/mL) or diluted with 
0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.  When the dose is based on patient weight (i.e., 
mg/kg), nivolumab injection can be infused undiluted or diluted to  a final  concentration  of 
1-10mg/ml s. When the dose is fixed (eg, 240 mg, 360 mg, or 480 mg flat dose), nivolumab 
injection can be infused undiluted or diluted so as not to exceed a total infusion volume of 
160 mL.  For patients weighing less than 40 kilograms (kg), the total volume of infusion 
must not exceed 4 mL per kg of patient weight.  During drug product preparation and 
handling, vigorous mixing or shaking is to be avoided.  
 
Nivolumab infusions are compatible with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or polyolefin containers 
and infusion sets, and glass bottles.  
 
Storage:   Vials of Nivolumab injection must be stored at 2° - 8°C (36° - 46°F) and protected 
from light and freezing.   The unopened vials can be stored at room temperature (up to 25°C, 
77°F) and room light for up to 48 hours.   
 
If a storage temperature excursion is identified, promptly return Nivolumab to 2°C -8°C and 
quarantine the supplies.  Provide a detailed report of the excursion (including documentation 
of temperature monitoring and duration of the excursion) to PMBAfterHou rs@mail.nih.gov  
for determination of suitability.  
 
Stability:   Shelf -life surveillance of the intact vials is ongoing.  
 
The administration of undiluted and diluted solutions of Nivolumab must be completed 
within 24 hours of preparation.  If not used immediately, the infusion solution may be stored 
up to 24 hours in a refrigerator at 2° -8°C (36° -46°F) and a maximum of 8 hour s of the total 
24 hours can be at room temperature (20° -25°C, 68° -77°F) and room light.  The maximum

 8-hour period under room temperature and room light conditions includes the product 
administration period.  
 
CAUTION:   The single -use dosage form contains no antibacterial preservative or 
bacteriostatic agent.  Therefore, it is advised that the product be discarded 8 hours after 
initial entry.  
 
Route of Administration:    Intravenous infusion over 30 minutes.  Nivolumab can be 
safely infused over 30 minutes in subjects with cancer.  Do not administer as an IV push or 
bolus injection.  
 
Method of Administration:   Administer through a 0.2 micron to 1.2 micron pore size, 
low-protein binding (polyethersulfone membrane) in -line filter.  
 
Potential Drug Interactions:  The indirect drug -drug interaction potential of nivolumab 
was assessed using systemic cytokine modulation data for cytokines known to modulate 
CYP enzymes.   There were no meaningful changes in cytokines known to have indirect 
effects on CYP enzymes across all dose levels of nivolumab. This lack of cytokine 
modulation suggests that nivolumab has no or low potential for modulating CYP enzymes, 
thereby indicating a low risk of therapeutic protein -drug interaction.  
 
Patient Care Implications:  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) receiving 
nivolumab must continue contraception for a period of 5 months after the last dose of 
nivolumab. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP must 
continue contraception for a period of 7  months after the last dose of nivolumab.

9.2    Integrated Correlative Studies
NCI Protocol #:  10193  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Protocol Version Date:    July 13,, 2021   
69 9.2.1 Lymph3Cx Cell -of-Origin (COO) molecular subtyping assay – Integrated Laboratory 
Correlative Study #1  (See Appendix G for more details ).  
 
The “Lymph3Cx” assay provides molecular Cell -of-Origin (COO) subtyping of large B cell 
lymphomas into Germinal Center B cell (GCB), Activated B Cell (ABC), Unclassifiable (UNC), 
and Primary Mediastinal B Cell Lymphoma (PMBCL) types, which have different bi ological 
features such as genomic alterations, gene expression and mutation profiles, signal pathway 
activation, and prognosis. We hypothesize that, as an integrated biomarker, the Lymph3Cx assay 
will identify those patients in this trial who benefited fro m the addition of Copanlisib in 
combination with Nivolumab.   
 
PMBCL is recognized as a distinct lymphoma entity in the current World Health Organization 
classification. However, the diagnosis relies on integration of clinical characteristics at time of 
presentation since reliable distinction from DLBCL solely based o n morphological or 
immunophenotypic features can be difficult and non -reproducible. Gene expression profiling 
(GEP) studies provide evidence that PMBCL can be distinguished from DLBCL on a molecular 
level and support a strong relationship between PMBCL and  classical Hodgkin lymphoma 
(Rosenwald et al., J Exp Med 2003; Savage et al., Blood 2003). Because these studies were 
performed using snap -frozen tissue specimens, the molecular classification of PMBCL has not 
penetrated into clinical practice. The Lymphom a and Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project 
research consortium (LLMPP), of which Dr. Rimsza  (Rimsza.Lisa@mayo.edu ) is the current 
Principal Investigator, recently developed a robust and accurate molecular assay for the 
distinction of PMBCL from DLBCL using GEP techniques applicable to routinely available 
formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded tissue (FFPE) biopsies.  
 
The Lymph3Cx assay that will be used in this clinical trial is builds upon the well -established 
Lymph2Cx assay with the addition of a gene expression “module” that specifically identifies 
PMBCL in additio n to the DLBCL subtypes (ABC, GCB, UNC).  The Lymph3Cx assay is run 
on the same platform as Lymph2Cx, the nCounter system by NanoString. The Lymph2Cx assay 
is now going through commercial development to become an FDA -cleared test. The Lymph2Cx 
is the only DLBCL cell -of-origin assay at such an advanced stage  of development, indicating the 
quality of the assays by the LLMPP.  
For Lymph3Cx assay development, all cases used were centrally reviewed by a panel of expert 
hematopathologists in the LLMPP. Gene selection was performed using data previously 
generated on Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 microarrays and the NanoString platform. T he training 
cohort for the new Lymph3Cx assay consisted of 68 cases (48 DLBCL and 20 PMBCL), and the 
independent validation cohort was comprised of 88 PMBCL and 78 DLBCL (42 GCB, 26 ABC, 
10 unclassified). Cases were required to have a tumor content of > 60 % (after macrodissection) 
and nucleic acids were extracted from 10 µm FFPE scrolls. Digital gene expression was 
performed using 200 ng RNA and the NanoString technology (Seattle, WA). Fresh versus 14 day 
old unstained tissue sections, at ambient temperature, were compared and yielded the same 
results on 5 samples indicatin g a 2 week time lag between cutting the samples and initiating 
testing is acceptable. Reproducibility between 2 different technical staff members, pathologists, 
and instruments was 100% fo r 9 samples repeated 2 weeks apart. Precision was assessed by 
repeating 5 cases on 3 different occasions, with 100% concordance. Dilution studies 
demonstrated that 100ng was the minimal reliable input for the assay. Potentially interfering

70 substances, including all reagents used in the assay, were tested and demonstrated no 
interference. The final Lymph3Cx gene set consisted of 64 probes and included the previously 
described 20 genes of the Lymph2Cx assay. A classifier score was then modeled  to account for 
error probabilities of the pathological classification and cut -points were defined at the 0.1 and 0.9 
probability scores. The model, including coefficients and thresholds was then “locked” and 
applied to the independent validation cohort. T he assay yielded gene expression data of sufficient 
quality in 157/166 cases (94.6 %). Among the pathologically -defined PMBCL, 85% were also 
classified as such based on the molecular signature. Ten percent were allocated in the 
“uncertain” category and 5% of cases showed a molecular signature of DLBCL. Among the 
pathologically -defined DLBCL cases, 83% were classified as DLBCL by the assay, 14% were 
“uncertain” and 3% were predicted to be PMBCL based on GEP. The newly developed and 
validated Lymph3Cx assay c learly distinguishes PMBCL and DLBCL based on gene expression 
signatures and shows high concordance with the pathological classification of an expert 
hematopathologist panel.  
 
An important pre -analytical variable is percentage of tumor, which should be a minimum of 60% 
based on a second dilution study demonstrating that 60% and 50% gave reliable results, but that 
40%, 30%, and 20% did not. To be conservative, 60% was chosen to a llow for slight variability 
in tumor content estimates and successive cuts off of the block. To address the tumor percent, an 
H&E stained section of each case will be assessed by Dr. Rimsza, who will estimate tumor 
purity. If needed, macro -dissection of th e tissue sections will be performed to increase tumor 
content. Optimal input is 1 x 10 micron thick section for a 50mm2 biopsy. For smaller biopsies, 
proportionally more sections will be taken. Dr. Rimsza will measure the size of the tumor area 
and determi ne the number of needed sections at the same time that she determines the tumor 
content. A Pathology Quality Assurance form is used to document the tissue input specifics 
(size/number of needed sections and percent tumor). At this time, only formalin fixed  biopsies 
(not other fixatives) have been assessed. The Pathology reports on the biopsies will be reviewed 
to determine whether formalin or another fixative was used. The average raw count of the 
housekeeping genes in the assay is used as a final quality c ontrol marker – samples with <20 
counts for this metric are reported as “Poor Quality”. The materials for this study will be 
analyzed in the exact same manner as the samples in the clinical laboratory that are tested for 
medical care. A positive and negati ve control and up to ten samples can be included in each 12 -
well cassette. Positive control is an equimolar mixture of oligonucleotides which hybridizes with 
all probes in the assay. This will be lyophilized, reconstituted into stock solutions, and pooled by 
the manufacturer. The negative control is a well in the cassette that includes all reagents and 
probes, but no RNA.  Importantly, there is a 100% concordance of 10 cases between 3 different 
laboratories using the Lymph3Cx assay. For these reasons, we ch ose the Lymph3Cx assay as the 
molecular method of choice. We have standardized operating procedures, controls, and a 
completely locked algorithm. Scoring is not applicable in this assay.

9.3 Exploratory/Ancillary Correlative Studies  
Unless otherwise indicated, we will follow the same steps for all correlative studies in terms of 
collection, handling and shipping as stated below in section 9 .3.2 and 9. 3.3. 
 
 
9.3.1 Background and Methodology  
We propose to obtain tumor tissue, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum for biomarker 
and correlative studies :  
• To characterize the effects of the copanlisib  and nivolumab combination regimen on 
tumor cells, tumor microenvironment and the immune response in relapsed/refractory 
DLBCL and PMBCL  
• To assess predictors of response of the combination in relapsed/refractory DLBCL and 
PMBCL . 
 
We will use the PD1/PD -L1 expression, gene amplification, number and location of immune 
cells, genetic mutations in the tumor, peripheral cell subtypes and activation status, as well as 
cytokine profile to develop an immune signature that is associated wit h response to PD -1 
blockade in combination with copanlisib.  
 
Blood/blood product/Tissue samples will be collected for the following research :  
1.  Identification of intratumoral immune cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC). To assess 
whether the location or num ber of intratumoral immune cells predicts response to therapy, serial 
NCI Protocol #:10193  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Version Date: July 13 , 2021  
 
73 5-μm paraffin -embedded sections will be deparaffinized and endogenous peroxidase quenched 
by incubation in 50% methanol/H2O2.  All sections will be pretreated with 50 mmol/L EDTA 
and staining will be done automatically on DAKO Autostainer using antibodies to CD11c (Leica 
Microsystems 5D11), CD14 (Cell Marque EPR 3653), CD163 (DAKO 1F8), CD68 (DAKO PG -
M1), CXCL13 (R&D Systems 53610), FOXP3 (Abcam 236AE/7), CD3 (R&D Systems), PD -L1 
(405.9A11), PD -L2 (366C.9E5) and PD -1 (Abcam NAT). Sections will be viewed wit h an 
Olympus BXFA51 microscope and photos taken with an Olympus DP71 camera.  
 
2.  Determine whether genetic amplification or copy number gain resulting in PD -L1/2 is 
associated with resp onse to therapy in our patients.  FISH will be performed to assess copy 
number on chromosome 9p24.1.  The bacterial artificial chromosome probes (CHORI; 
www.chori.org) RP11 -599H2O, which maps to 9p24.1 and includes PD -L1 (labeled with 
Spectrum Orange), and  RP11 -635N21, which also maps to 9p24.1 and includes PD -L2 (labeled 
with Spectrum Green), will be cohybridized.  A control centromeric probe, Spectr um Aqua –
labeled CEP9 (Abbott Molecular) that maps to 9p11 -q11, will be hybridized according to the 
manufacturer's recommendations.  Nuclei with a target:control probe ratio of at least 3:1 will be 
classified as amplified, those with a probe ratio of more t han 1:1 but less than 3:1 will be 
classified as relative copy gain, and those with a probe ratio of 1:1 but with more than two copies 
of each probe will be classified as polysomic for chromosome 9p.  
 
3.  Serum cytokine profile. To determine whether a serum cytokine profile can be used as a 
predictive biomarker, serum specimens will be subjected to multiplex ELIS A (Invitrogen, 
Camarillo, CA) to measure 30 serum cytokines in pre -treatment and subsequent blood samples.  
Luminex -200 system version 1.7 will be used for reading plates and MasterPlex QT1.0 system 
(MiraiBio) will be used to analyze data. Cytokines will i nclude epidermal growth factor (EGF), 
eotaxin, basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF -b), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating 
factor (GM -CSF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), IFN -α, IFN -ϒ, interleukin 1 receptor 
antagonist (IL -1RA), IL -1β,IL-2, IL -2R , IL -4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10,12,13,15,17, Inducible protein -10 
(IP10/CXCL10), monocyte chemotactic protein 1(MCP -1), monokine induced by interferon γ, 
(MIG/CXCL9), MIP -1α (CCL3), MIP1β ( CCL4), regulated on activation normal T -cell 
expressed and secreted (RANTES),TNF -α and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). 
Internal control serum will be included in all assays to control for interassay variation.  
 
4.  Changes in T -cell subsets by f low cytometry. To define changes in peripheral blood cell 
populations after treatment, peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be stained with 
fluorochrome -conjugated antibodies to human CD69 (R&D Systems), CD3 (clone HIT3a), 
CD19 (clone 4G7), PD1 (clone E H12.1), CD14 (clone M5E2), CD163 (clone GH1/61), CD21 
(clone B -ly4), PD -L2 (clone M1H18), PD -L1 (clone M1H1), TIM3 (clone 344823), and CD23 
(clone EBVCS -5; all obtained from BD Biosciences) and the data will be analyzed us ing 
CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson).  
 
5.  Sequencing to determine mutational burden. To determine whether increased numbers of 
mutations correspond to increased responses to therapy, genomic DNA will be extracted from 
formalin -fixed, paraffin - embedded tissue blocks for mutational an alysis. DNA will be extracted 
using the Qiagen FFPE DNA extraction kit. DNA quantitation will be performed using a Qubit 
fluorometer prior to sequencing. Whole -exome capture libraries constructed via the Agilent 
NCI Protocol #:10193  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Version Date: July 13 , 2021  
 
74 Sure-Select Human All Exon v2.0, 44Mb baited target with the Broad in -solution hybrid 
selection process will be used. Enriched exome libraries will be sequenced on the HiSeq 2000 
platform (Illumina) to generate paired -end reads (2x76bp) to a goal of 150X m ean target 
coverage (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA). Targeted resequencing using a custom panel of 376 
loci to a target coverage of 500X will be performed usin g Ampliseq (Life Technologies).  
 
6.  Screening for PTEN Loss. The following methods were developed  and validated using 
standard approaches for clinical test validation, in line with CLIA provisions and CAP 
requirements  at MDACC  (in collaboration with Dr. Timothy Yap) clinical IHC laboratory, which 
is certified under the provisions of the United States Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act 
(CLIA)  and accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP). This laboratory is also 
the central laboratory for the PTEN immunohistochemical study for the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (MATCH) trial.   The anti -human PTEN antibody 
clone 6H2.1 (isotype IgG2a, kappa) is manufactured by Dako and registered with the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) for in vitro diagnostic use (IVD).  Per  Dako, the immunogen 
against which the antibody is produced is the f ull-length recombinant human PTEN protein.   
This is a monoclonal mouse anti -PTEN clone 6H2.1 which identifies a single band at the 55 kD -
predicted molecular weig ht for PTEN in western blots of MCF -7, T-47D and MDA -MB-435S 
PTEN -homozygous cell lines. PTEN -null cell lines BT -549 and MDA -MB-468 were unreactive 
with clone 6H2.1 by western blot analysis. Immunoblots of MCF -7 cells induced to express 
PTEN demonstrated a n increased band intensity at the expected size, while a weak band was 
observed on immunoblots of ZR -75-1 cell lysates containing a hemizygous deletion of PTEN 
and a missense mutation in the remaining allele. Immunohistochemical staining of sections from 
FFPE blocks of Ishikawa 3 -H-12 cells transfected with PTEN stained positively, whereas PTEN -
deficient 3 -H-12 cell block sections were unreactive. The anti -PTEN antibody is provided in 
liquid form as a tissue culture supernatant (containing fetal bovine seru m) at a concentration of 
222.4 mg/L dialyzed against 0.05 mol/L Tris -HCl, pH 7.2, and 0.015 mol/L sodium azide, and 
containing stabilizing protein.  
 
This antibody can be used to perform IHC on formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tissue 
sections  and has been in use since 2010. The final protocol is validated for use on 4 um FFPE 
tissue sections. In brief, following deparaffinization and rehydration of the tissues sections, 
antigen retrieval is performed at 100 °C for 20 minutes with Tris -EDTA buffer, pH 6.0.  
Endogenous peroxida se is blocked with 3% peroxide for 5 minutes. Primary PTEN antibody 
(Dako, clone 6H2.1) is applied at 1:100 dilution.  Prima ry antibody detection is carried out using 
a commercial polymer system (Bond Polymer Refine Detection, Leica), and staining 
development is achieved by incubation with DAB and DAB Enhancer (Leica)  
 
A positive and negative control is added to every IHC run (batch control) and is reviewed by a 
member of the IHC medical directorship team. Records of batch control results are documented 
daily in internal laboratory records.  
 
Correlatives ( 1 to 6) will be done at Stephen Ansell’s laboratory (Chair of lymphoma disease 
oriented group). Dr. Ansell has extensively studied the effects of immunotherapy on the tumor 
and tumor microenvironment and has published several papers in the topic. These corr elatives 
will be exploratory.

7.  Circulating free DNA (cfDNA). Correlate effects of therapy on cfDNA and correlation with 
degree of response and use as an early predictor of progression of disease.  Plasma samples from 
patients will be screened for cfDNA at the end of the trial. We wi ll develop and optimize digital 
droplet PCR -based assays on the customizable RainDrop Digital PCR System 
(http://raindancetech.com/digital -pcr-tech/raindrop -digital -pcr-system).  We will use the be st 
technology available at the end of the trial as this is a rapidly evolving area of research.

79 11. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
 
If a second confirmatory scan indicates unequivocal disease progression, the subject will be 
discontinued from treatment. The date of the first scan indicating progression will be used for 
analysis purposes. If however the second scan indicates a reduction in t umor burden or stable 
disease from the baseline scan, the subject may continue on treatment in the absence of 
unacceptable toxicity or other reason for treatment discontinuation.  
Notwithstanding, the Investigator is free to remove the patient from treatment at any time during 
the study if it is felt to be in the patient’s best interest.  
 
11.1 Antitumor Effect – Hematologic Tumors  
 
Lugano Classification Response Criteria  
 
11.1.1  Response Considerations  
 
 Definitions for clinical response for patients with lymphoma are based on the 
lymphoma response to immunomodulatory therapy criteri a or LYRIC. (Cheson et 
al. 2016)   Lymph node measurements should be taken from the CT port ion of the 
PET/CT, or other dedicated CT scans where applicable.  Measurement of 
lymphadenopathy for purposes of assessing for PR will be determined by adding 
the sum of the products of the maximal perpendicular diameters of measured 
lesions (SPD). The per pendicular diameter of a single node is sufficient to 
evaluate for PD (see Table 11.1. 2).  Measurable extranodal disease should be 
assessed in a manner similar to that for nodal disease.  For these 
recommendations, the spleen is considered nodal disease. D isease that is only 
assessable (e.g., pleural effusions, bone lesions) will be recorded as present or 
absent only, unless, while an abnormality is still noted by imaging studies or 
physical examination, it is found to be histologically and pathologically n egative.  
 
 For response assessment, PET -CT is preferred for staging of FDG -avid 
lymphomas and CT scan is preferred in the other lymphomas  
 
   Progressive disease is based on either PET -CT based (PMD) or CT based (PD) 
response criteria.  Definition of progressive disease according to LYRIC is same 
as the Lugano classification except that a new category of indeterminate response 
(IR) is added. Patients whose disease fall in the IR category may continue 
treatment for additional 12 weeks if the patient remains clinically stable as judged 
by the treating physician. A repeat imaging study  in 12 weeks (or earlier if 
clinically indicated) is mandator y to confirm or refute disease progression.  PET 
confirmation of progressive disease is per physician discretion.

increase of ≥ 5 mm in either 
dimension of ≥ 1 lesion for lesions ≤ 
2cm and 10 mm for lesions  > 2 cm) 
constitutes PD

Note:  The new or growing lesion(s) 
(unless biopsy proven to be benign) 
should be added to the target 
lesion(s), up to a total of no more than 
6 total lesions. In future assessments, 
if the SPD of the newly defined set of 
target lesions has increased ≥ 50% 
from their nadir value (which may 
precede the IR time point), the patient 
should be considered to have PD.  
IR(3)  Increase in FDG uptake of 1 or more 
lesion(s) without a concomitant increase 
in lesion size or number.  
 
Note:  Because inflammatory responses 
may result in an increase in the 
standardized uptake value of a lesion, the 
patient will not be considered to have PD 
unless there is evidence of PD by an 
increase in lesion size or the development 
of new lesions, as noted b elow.

diameters for multiple lesions.  
a.   A score of 3 in many patients indicates a good prognosis with standard treatment, especially if at 
the time of an interim scan. However, in trials involving PET where de -escalation is 
investigated, it may be preferable to consider a score of 3 as inad equate response (to avoid under 
treatment). Measured dominant lesions: Up to six of the largest dominant nodes, nodal masses, 
and extranodal lesions selected to be clearly measurable in two diameters. Nodes should 
preferably be from disparate regions of th e body and should include, where applicable, 
mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas. Non -nodal lesions include those in solid organs ( e.g., liver, 
spleen, kidneys, and lungs), GI involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those noted on palpation. 
Non-measured lesions: Any disease not selected as measured, dominant disease and truly 
assessable disease should be considered not measured. These sites i nclude any nodes, nodal 
masses, and extranodal sites not selected as dominant or measurable or that do not meet the 
requirements for measurability but are still considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable 
disease, which is any site of suspected disease that would be difficult to follow quantitatively 
with measurement, including pleural effusions, ascites, bone lesions , leptomeningeal disease, 
abdominal masses, and other lesions that cannot be confirmed and followed by imaging. In 
Waldeyer’s ring or in extranodal sites ( e.g.,, GI tract, liver, bone marrow), FDG uptake may be 
greater than in the mediastinum with complete  metabolic response, but should be no higher than 
surrounding normal physiologic uptake ( e.g., with marrow activation as a result of chemotherapy 
or myeloid growth factors).  
†   PET Deauville 5PS: 1, no uptake above background; 2, uptake ≤  mediastinum; 3, uptake > 
mediastinum but ≤ liver; 4, uptake moderately > liver; 5, uptake markedly higher than liver 
and/or new lesions; X, new areas of uptake unlikely to be related to lym phoma.  
b.   If a patient is assessed as having IR and then “true” PD at a subsequent time point (without an 
intervening objective response between IR and PD), the IR assessment should subsequently be 
corrected to PD for reporting purposes to the date of the prior  designation of IR. We recognize 
that these lesions may remain stable during the time of observation, but, even if this is the case,

Data collection for this study will be done exclusively through Medidata Rave.  Access to the 
trial in Rave is granted through the iMedidata application to all persons with the appropriate 
roles assigned in the Regulatory Support System (RSS).  To access R ave via iMedidata, the site 
user must have an active CTEP IAM account (check at https:// ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/iam ) and the 
appropriate Rave role (Rave CRA, Rave Read -Only, Rave CRA  (Lab Admin ), Rave  SLA , or 
Rave  Investigator) on either the LPO or participating organization roster at the enrolling site. To 
the hold Rave CRA role or Rave CRA (Lab Admin ) role, the user must hold a minimum of an 
AP registration type.  To hold the Rave Investigator role, the individual must be registered as an 
NPIVR or IVR.  Associates can hold read -only roles in Rave.  If the study has a DTL, 
individuals requiring write ac cess to Rave must also be assigned the appropriate Rave tas ks on 
the DTL.  
 
Upon initial site registration approval for the study in RSS, all persons with Rave roles assigned 
on the appropriate roster will be sent a study invitation e -mail from iMedidata.  To accept the 
invitation, site users must log into the Select Login ( https://login.imedidata.com/selectlogin ) 
using their CTEP -IAM user name and password, and click on the “accept ” link in the upper

86 12.2.2  Responsibility for Data Submission  
 
For ETCTN trials, it is the responsibility of the PI(s) at the site to ensure that all 
investigators at the ETCTN Sites understand the procedures for data submission for each 
ETCTN protocol and that protocol specified data are submitted accurately and in a  timely 
manner to the CTMS via the electronic data capture system, Medidata Rave.   
 
Data are to be submitted via Medidata Rave to CTMS on a real -time basis, but no less 
than once every 2 weeks.  The timeliness of data submissions and timeliness in resolving 
data queries will be tracked by CTMS.  Metrics for timeliness will be followed and  
assessed on a quarterly basis.  For the purpose of Institutional Performance Monitoring, 
data will be considered delinquent if it is greater than 4 weeks past due.  
 
Data from Medidata Rave and CTEP -AERS is reviewed by the CTMS on an ongoing 
basis as data is received.  Queries will be issued by CTMS directly within Rave.  The 
queries will appear on the Task Summary Tab within Rave for the CRA at the ETCTN to 
resolve.  Monthly web -based reports are posted for review by the Drug Monitors in the 
IDB, CTEP.  Onsite audits will be conducted by the CTMS to ensure compliance with 
regulatory requirements, GCP, and NCI policies and procedures with the overarching 
goal of ensurin g the integrity of data generated from NCI -sponsored clinical trials, as 
described in the ETCTN Program Guidelines, which may be found on the CTEP 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.htm
)  and CTSU websites.  
 
An End of Study CRF is to be completed by the PI, and is to include a summary of study 
endpoints not otherwise captured in the database, such as (for phase 1 trials) the 
recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and a description of any dose -limiting toxicities 
(DLT s).  CTMS will utilize a core set of eCRFs that are Cancer Data Standards Registry 
and Repository (caDSR) compliant ( http://cbiit.nci.nih.gov/ncip/biomedical -informatics -
resources/interoperability -and-semantics/metadata -and-models ).  Customized eCRFs will 
be included when appropriate to meet uniq ue study requirements.  The PI is encouraged 
to review the eCRFs, working closely with CTMS to ensure prospectively that all 
required items are appropriately captured in the eCRFs prior to study activation.  CTMS 
will prepare the eCRFs with built -in edit c hecks to the extent possible to promote data 
integrity.  
 
CDUS data submissions for ETCTN trials activated after March 1, 2014, will be carried 
out by the CTMS contractor, Theradex.  CDUS submissions are performed by Theradex 
on a monthly basis.  The trial’s lead institution is responsible for timely submission t o 
CTMS via Rave, as above.

89 13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
13.1 Study Design /Endpoints : 
 
13.1.1  Overview  
This is a parallel phase II study of Nivolumab and Copanlisib in patients with 
relapsed/refractory diffuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal 
large B -cell lymphoma (PMBCL). It is designed using two separate a one -stage designs 
with an in terim analyses based on the Simon optimal design to assess efficacy (ORR 
(CR+PR)).   
 
13.1.2  Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the proportion of objective responses (either a CR or PR 
according to Lugano criteria). Throughout Section 1 3.0, CR or PR will be considered 
synonymous with “success”, unless specified otherwise. All patients meeting the 
eligibility crite ria who have signed a consent form and have begun treatment will be 
evaluable for response.  
 
 DLBCL and PMBCL will be analyzed  and reported separately.  
 
13.1.3  Statistical Design  
 
13.1.3.1  Decision Rules are based upon prior response rates reported in section s 2.2.1 and 
2.2.2 . 
It is expected that this dose will have response rates similar to those 
presented.  
 
13.1.3.2  Safety Cohort  
This treatment regimen has been explored in previous studies but study results have 
not been reported, thus, it has been determined that a safety cohort is necessary to 
confirm the copanlisib dose.  
 
6 patients will be enrolled on the trial and accrual will cease until these six patients 
have been evaluated for adverse events in 1 cycle.  If 1 or 0 of 6 patients experience a 
DLT as defined in section 5.1.3.3 , the study will open enrollment to accrue the rest of 
the patients.  If 2 or more of 6 patients experience a DLT, the trial will be halted 
while the examination of the treatment regimen at a lower dose will be explored.  If it 
is determined that a lower d ose is appropriate, 6 patients will be accrue d at the lower 
dose and accrual will cease until these six patients have been evaluated for adverse 
events in 1 cycle.  If 1 or 0 of 6 patients experience a DLT as defined in 
section 5.1.3.3 , the study will open enrollment to accrue the rest of the patients.  If no 
DLTs are observed at dose level 1, the study will open to complete accrual. If 1 or 
less patients experience DLTs at dose level -1, the study will open to complete 
accrual.  If 1 or less patients experience DLTs at dose level 1, the study will ope n to 
complete accrual.  
NCI Protocol #:10193  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Version Date: July 13 , 2021  
 
90  
This decision rule is based on the decision rules for a standard cohorts of 3 trial 
design.  The safety cohort will not be separated by lymphoma subtypes as it is 
expected that the treatment regimen will have the same effect on all three lymphoma 
subtypes.   The 6 patients accrued at the acceptable dose will be included in the 
primary analysis.  
 
13.1.3.3 DLBCL: The largest success proportion where the proposed treatment 
regimen would be considered ineffective in DLBCL is 25%, and the smallest success 
proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in this 
patient population is 45 %. This design uses 44 evaluable patients to test the null 
hypothesis that the true complete response rate is at most 25%.  
 
13.1.3.3.1  Interim Analysis: Enter 14 evaluable patients into the study. If there 
are three or less successes observed in the first 14 evaluable patients, we will 
consider this regimen ineffective in this patient population and terminate this 
study. Otherwise, if the  number of successes is at least 4, we will continue 
accrual.  
 
13.1.3.3.2  Final Decision Rule: If 14 or fewer successes are observed in the first 44 
evaluable patients, we will consider this regimen ineffective in this patient 
population. If 15 or more successes are observed in the first 44 evaluable patients, we 
may recommend further testing of this regimen in subsequent studies in this 
population.  
 
13.1.3..3.3  Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the 
additional patients will not be used to evaluate the stopping rule or used in any 
decision making process. Analyses involving over accrued patients are discussed in 
Section 16.3 .4. 
 
13.1.3.3.4  NOTE: We will not suspend accrual at the interim analysis to allow the 
first 14 patients to become evaluable, unless undue toxicity is observed. Given the 
limited overall sample size and the inclusion of an adverse events stopping rule, we 
feel it is ethic al to not halt accrual for the interim analysis. However, if accrual is 
extremely rapid, we may temporarily suspend accrual in order to obtain safety and 
efficacy data on these patients before re -opening accrual to further patients.  
 
13.1.3.4 PMBCL: The largest success proportion where the proposed treatment 
regimen would be considered ineffective in PMBCL is 30%, and the smallest success 
proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in this 
patient population is 50 %. This design uses 46 evaluable patients to test the null 
hypothesis that the true complete response rate is at most 30%.

Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Version Date: July 13 , 2021  
 
91 13.1.3.4.1 Interim Analysis: Enter 22 evaluable patients into the study. If there are 7 
or less successes  observed in the first 22 evaluable patients, we will consider this 
regimen ineffective in this patient population and terminate this study. Otherwise, if 
the number of successes is at least 8, we will continue accrual.  
 
13.1.3.4.2 Final Decision Rule: If 17 or fewer successes are observed in the first 46 
evaluable patients, we will consider this regimen ineffective in this patient 
population. If 18 or more successes are observed in the first 46 evaluable patients, we 
may recommend f urther testing of this regimen in subsequent studies in this 
population.  
 
13.1.3.4.3 Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the 
additional patients will not be used to evaluate the stopping rule or used in any 
decision making process. Analyses involving over accrued patients are discussed in 
Section 16.3 .4. 
13.1.3. 4.4 NOTE: We will not suspend accrual at the interim analysis to allow the first 22 
patients to become evaluable, unless undue toxicity is observed. Given the limited overall sample 
size and the inclusion of an adverse events stopping rule, we feel it is ethic al to not halt accrual 
for the interim analysis. However, if accrual is extremely rapid, we may  temporarily suspend 
accrual in order to obtain safety and efficacy data on these patients before re -opening accrual to 
further patients.  
 
 
13.2 Sample Size /Accrual Rate   
 
13.2.1  This study is expected to require a minimum of 42 (6 safety cohort, 14 DLBCL and 22 
PMBCL) and a maximum of 96 (6 safety cohort, 44 DLBCL and 46 PMBCL) evaluable 
patients. We anticipate accruing 10 (10%) additional patients to account for ineligibility, 
cancellation, or other reasons. Therefore, the study is expected to accrue a maximum of 
106 patients overall.  
 
13.2.2  Accrual Rate and Study Duration:  The anticipated accrual rate for the safety cohort is 2 -
3 months.  The anticipated accrual rate is 3-5 patients per month for the DLBCL cohort 
and 1 -2 patients per month for the PMBCL group.  Therefore,  after assessing safety,  the 
accrual period is expected to be 11 months  for the DLBCL cohort, with the primary 
endpoint evaluated at approximately 17 months  after the trial opens (or after the last 
patient accrued has been observed for at least 6 months and data collection fo r the 
induction phase is complete). The accrual period is expected to be 31 months  for the 
PMBCL cohort , with the primary endpoint evaluated at approximately 37 months after 
the trial opens.  The total study duration is expected to maximally be 6.75 years, or until 
all patients have completed all cycles of treatment.

92 13.2.3  Power and Significance Level: Assuming that the number of successes is binomially 
distributed, the significance level is .10, i.e. there is a 10% chance of finding the drug to 
be effective when it truly is not. The probability of declaring that this regime n warrants 
further study (i.e. statistical power) under various success proportions and the probability 
of stopping accrual after the interim analysis can be tabulated as a function of the true 
success proportion.  
 
For DLBCL:  
 
If the true success proportion is...  0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 
Then the probability of declaring 
that the regimen warrants further 
study is…  0.097  0.286  0.543  0.766  0.901  
and the probability of stopping 
after 
the interim analysis is …  0.521  0.355  0.221  0.124  0.063  
 
 
  For PMBCL:  
 
If the true success proportion is...  0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 
Then the probability of declaring 
that the regimen warrants further 
study is…  0.097  0.279  0.532  0.762  0.905  
and the probability of stopping 
after 
the interim analysis is …  0.671  0.474  0.290  0.152  0.067  
 
 
13.2.4  Other considerations: Adverse events, quality/duration of response, and patterns of 
treatment failure observed in this study, as well as scientific discoveries or changes in 
stand ard care will be taken into account in any dec ision to terminate the study.  
 
13.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
This study will be available to all eligible patients, regardless of race, gender, or ethnic 
origin.  
 
There is no information currently available regarding differential effects of this regimen 
in subsets defined by race, or ethnicity, and there is no reason to expect such differences 
to exist. Therefore, although the planned analysis will, as always, look for differences in 
treatment effect based on racial, the sample size is not increased in order to provide 
additional power for subset analyses.  
The diagnosis is more common in men, as the male:female ratio is approximately 2:1 
(Weisenburger et al. 2011)

13.4 Grouping Factors  
 
13.4.1  Histology: DLBCL vs PMBCL  
 
13.5 Evaluation of Response  
 
13.5.1  Primary Outcome Analyses:  
 
13.5.1.1  The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by 
the total number of evaluable patients. Confidence intervals for the true success 
proportion will be calculated according to the approach of Duffy and Santner (Duffy 
D 1987) . 
 
NCI Protocol #:10193  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Version Date: July 13 , 2021  
 
94 13.5.2  Secondary Outcome Analyses: These analyses will include all patients meeting the 
eligibility crite ria who have signed a consent form and have begun treatment, including 
patients who fail to achieve a complete or partial response.  
 
13.5.2.1  Adverse Events: All eligible patients that have initiated treatment will be considered 
evaluable for assessing adverse event rate(s). The maximum grade for each type of 
adverse event will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed 
to determine patterns. Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the 
study treatment will be taken into consideration.  
 
13.5.2.2  Progression free survival time is defined for all evaluable patients as the time from 
registration to relapse or death due to any cause. Patients are censored if they have not 
achieved progression at the time of analysis.  The distribution of progression -free 
survival will be estimated using the method of Kaplan -Meier. In addition, the 
progression -free survival rate at 5 years after registration will be reported.  
 
13.5.2.3  Duration of response is defined for all evaluable patients who have achieved a CR or 
PR as the date at which the patient’s objective status is first noted to be a CR or PR to 
the earliest date relapse is documented. The distribution of duration of complete  
response will be estimated using the method of Kaplan -Meier . 
 
13.5.2.4  Overall survival time is defined as the time from registration to death due to any 
cause. Patients are censored if they are alive at the time of analysis.  The distribution 
of survival time will be estimated using the method of Kaplan -Meier  (Kaplan and 
Meier 1958) .  
 
13.5.3  Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the additional 
patients will not be used to evaluate the stopping rule or used in any decision making 
processe s; however, they will be included in final endpoint estimates and confidence 
intervals.  
 
13.6 Evaluation of Toxicity : 
 
13.6.1  The study statistician will review the study weekly to monitor accrual, endpoints and 
adverse events. The Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) is responsible for reviewing accrual and safety data for this trial at least twic e a 
year, based on reports provided by the MCCC Statistical Office.  
 
13.6.2  Adverse Event Stopping Rules: The stopping rules specified below are based on the 
knowledge available at study development. We note that the Adverse Event Stopping 
Rule may be adjusted in the event of either (1) the study re -opening to accrual or (2) at 
any time during the conduct of the trial and in consideration of newly acquired 
information regarding the adverse event profile of the treatment(s) under investigation. 
The study team may choose to suspend accrual beca use of unexpected adverse event 
profiles that have not crossed the specified rule below.  
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we 
NCI Protocol #:10193  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Version Date: July 13 , 2021  
 
95 observe events considered at least possibly related to study treatment (i.e. 
an adverse event with attribute specified as “possible,” “probable,” or 
“definite”) that satisfy one of the following:  
• if 2 or more patients in the first 10 treated patients (2 0%) experience a 
grade 4 or higher non -hematologic adverse event at least possibly 
related to treatment.  
• if after the first 10 patients have been treated, 2 0% of all patients 
experience a grade 4 or higher non -hematologic adverse event at least 
possibly related to treatment.  
We note that we will review grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed 
“unrelated” or “unlikely to be related”, to verify their attribution and to 
monitor the emergence of a previously unrecognized treatment -related 
adverse event.  
 
13.7 Results Reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov:  
At study activation, this study will have been registered within the 
“ClincialTrails.gov” website. The Primary and Secondary Endpoints along with 
other required information for this study will be reported on ClinicalTrials.gov. 
For purposes of timing of th e Results Reporting, the initial estimated completion 
date for the Primary Endpoint of this study is 5.5 years after the study opens to 
accrual. The definition of “Primary Endpoint Completion Date” (PECD) for this 
study is at the time the last patient regi stered has been followed for at least 2 
months.

(In lieu of completing items 5 -6, the biomarker assay templates available at 
http://www.cancerdiagnosis.nci.nih.gov/diagnostics/templates.htm  may be utilized.)  
Please submit a response to each of the criteria below and complete one Study Checklist  for 
each Biomarker endpoint.  
1. Name of marker: Lymph3Cx Cell -of-Origin (COO) molecular subtyping assay for 
Primary Mediastinal B cell Lymphoma (PMBCL) and Diffuse Large B Cell 
Lymphoma (DLBCL) subtypes  
2. For an integral or integrated assay, indicate the role(s) of the biomarker assay in the trial:  
A. Eligibility criterion  
B. Assignment to treatment  
C. Stratification variable  
D. Risk classifier or score  
E. Other (describe in detail): This assay provides molecular cell -of-origin (COO) 
subtyping of PMBCL, not PMBCL, and uncertain; and DLBCL, with DLBCL 
further divided into Activated B cell, Germinal Center B cell, and Unclassifiable 
subtypes. These tumor types have different biological f eatures such as gene 
expression, mutation profiles, signal pathway activation, and prognosis.  
Retrospectively, after closure of the trial, the Lymph3Cx results will be analyzed 
with regard to patient response to the novel chemo therapy regimen. The assay 
was developed by the Lymphoma and Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project 
research consortium (LLMPP), of which Dr. Rimsza is the current Principal 
Investigator.   
3. Identify the specific individual(s) and laboratory(ies) who are being considered for 
conducting the assay(s) for the trial.  Performing lab: Molecular Diagnostics – Arizona 
Laboratory, Mayo Clinic Arizona; Medical Director: Dr. Lisa Rimsza; Performing 
technologist: Colleen Ramsower, MB(ASCP)CM., Quality Specialist: Tameson Yip, 
MB (ASCP)cm. 
4. Integral  laboratory assays used for clinical decision -making must be performed in a 
CLIA -certified facility.  Provide the lab’s CLIA number that is performing the integral  
biomarker study(ies) and the expiration date of the certificate. N/A – The Lymph3Cx 
assay will be an Integrated  Assay, not used for medical decision -making; 
nevertheless, the study will be conducted in the Molecular Diagnostics of Arizona 
Lab, at Mayo Clinic, CLIA # 03D2113087.  
5. Describe the assay: -  
A. Specify the analyte(s), technical platform, and sources of assay components (e.g., 
reagents, chips, and calibrators).  The technical platform is the Nanostring 
NCI Protocol #:10193  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Version Date: July 13 , 2021  
 
113 nCounter system, which is FDA -cleared for use with the ProSigna breast cancer 
assay.  The RNA extraction kits are commercially available from Roche.  The 64 
fluorescently -labeled tags used in the assay will be from NanoString. The 
positive control is an eq uimolar mixture of oligonucleotides with complimentary 
sequences to all probes in Lymph3Cx assay. The oligonucleotides will be 
purchased in bulk, lyophilized, reconstituted into stock solutions, and pre -mixed 
by Integrated DNA Technologies similar to our p rior work with the Lymph2Cx 
assay (D. Scott et al, Blood  2014).  We have a standard operating procedure for 
storage and dilution of this calibration standard, which has been used for 
normalization in all subsequent studies including the proposed trial. Additional 
PMBCL cell line pellets will be included as posi tive controls for the Lymph3Cx 
as well. The analysis algorithm is held behind a firewall on a password 
protected, NCI -sponsored website, so as to prevent any “drift” or tweaking.  
 
B. Describe the specimens, and anticipated methods for specimen acquisition, fixation or 
stabilization, and processing.  Provide justification for the timing of specimen 
collection. Describe the scoring procedures and type of data to be acquired:  
• quantitative/continuously distributed  
• semi -quantitative/ordered categorical  
• qualitative/non -ordered categorical  
 
The specimens will be formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections 
from the diagnostic pre -treatment biopsies of the patients, processed under 
standard clinical protocols at each participating site. Quantitative digital data 
will be generated f rom the nCounter system then uploaded to an NCI sponsored 
website with the analysis algorithm, which will calculate a probability score and 
assign the results into PMBCL, not PMBCL, or uncertain, and then 3 
DLBCL/not PMBCL categories: DLBCL -ABC, DLBCL -GCB,  or DLBCL -UNC.  
The average raw count of the housekeeping genes in the assay is used as a final 
quality control marker – samples with < 80 counts for this metric are reported as 
“Poor Quality”.  
A. Provide data on the analytical performance of the assay. -For in vitro  tests, describe 
the current status of studies defining the accuracy, precision, reportable range, 
reference ranges/intervals (normal values), turn -around time and failure rate of the 
assay as it is to be performed in the trial .  Describe the use of positive and negative 
controls, calibrators, and reference standards for clinical assays.  Describe any critical 
pre-analytic variables.  For guidance on regulatory requirements for laboratory  assays 
please visit: http://www.cms.gov/CLIA/05_CLIA_Brochures.asp    
 
Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the Lymph3Cx assay have been 
established as presented at the recent International Conference on Malignant 
Lymphoma meeting in Lugano, Italy, June 14 -17, 2017 (A. Mottok et al. ICML 
2017, manuscript under preparation  for submission). The assay yielded GEP 
data of sufficient quality in 157/166 cases (94.6%).  The Rimsza laboratory 
provided the intra - and inter -laboratory reproducibility data for the Lymph3Cx 
NCI Protocol #:10193  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Version Date: July 13 , 2021  
 
114 assay, which was 100% for repeat samples within the same laboratory and 
between laboratories respectively. The laboratory turn -around time for the 
assay is 2.5 days from the receipt of tissue sections including RNA extraction, 
overnight hybridization, digi tal scanning, and data analysis. There is no 
reference range.  The results are provided as a probability score of classification. 
The failure rate of the assay in the first 119 cases was 0% (all biopsies yielded 
sufficient RNA when assessed for pre -analyti cal variables as described below) 
using standard chemistry. A positive and negative control and up to ten samples 
can be included in each 12 -well cassette.  Positive controls include the mixture of 
oligonucleotides and cell lines which hybridize with all p robes in the assay.  The 
negative control is a well in the cassette that includes all reagents and probes, 
but no RNA. An important pre -analytical variable is percentage of tumor, which 
should be a minimum of 60%.  To address this, an H&E stained section o f each 
case will be assessed by Dr. Rimsza, who will estimate tumor purity.  If needed, 
macro -dissection of the tissue sections will be performed to increase tumor 
content.  Input is 1 x 10 micron thick section for a 50mm2 biopsy.  For smaller 
biopsies, proportionally more sections will be taken. Dr. Rimsza will measure the 
size of the tumor area and determined the number of needed sections at the same 
time that she determines the tumor content. A Pathology Quality Assuranc e 
form is used to document the tis sue input specifics (size/number of needed 
sections and percent tumor). At this time, only formalin fixed biopsies (not other 
fixatives) have been assessed.  The Pathology reports on the biopsies will be 
reviewed to determine whether formalin or another fi xative was used. A 
complete validation packet for the Lymph2Cx assay as a laboratory developed 
test in the clinical Molecular Diagnostics in Arizona Laboratory at the Mayo 
Clinic was completed in November 2016 with on -going patient testing since that 
time.  The Lymph3Cx clinical laboratory validation is underway and estimated 
for completion in late 2018. Although not for use in clinical decision making in 
this proposed trial, the Lymph3Cx assay will be run using the same standardized 
operating procedures as in the Mayo clinical laboratory. CLIA lab identification 
number 03D2113087.  
 
 
B. If the assay will be performed at more than one site, describe how inter -laboratory 
variability in the measurements listed in 5A above will be assessed. Describe how 
these sources of variation will be minimized to maintain performance at all sites 
within a cceptable limits and to prevent drift or bias in assay. Not applicable, all 
testing will be performed at one site.   
 
6. Provide data on the clinical utility of the integral/integrated assay as it will be used in the 
trial:  
A. Provide background information that justifies the use of this assay result as a marker 
for this trial. State the hypothesis and rationale for utilizing the biomarker, with 
supporting preclinical and clinical data, when available.  For example, if the integ ral 
marker will be used as a stratification or treatment -determining variable, data 
NCI Protocol #:10193  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Version Date: July 13 , 2021  
 
115 supporting its prognostic or predictive association with a main trial endpoint should 
be described or referenced.  
 Note:   If the trial objectives include an evaluation of the association of the 
integral marker with a new clinical endpoint or factor not previously studied, 
explain how the magnitude of the association or effect will be measured and 
provide power calculations for any statistical tests that are planned.  
  
The Lymph3Cx assigns the molecular COO subtype of cases of large cell 
lymphomas into PMBCL and DLBCL subtypes with different phenotypes 
and genotypes.  Meaningful analysis of any clinical trial results need to be 
correlated with COO status in order to accu rately describe the enrolled 
cohort of patients. Diagnosis of PMBCL is difficult, non -reproducible, and 
relies heavily on clinical presentation in the mediastinum, however, our 
research consortium recently described PMBCL -like tumors outside of the 
mediast inum, and conversely, not every case of large B cell lymphoma 
occurring in the mediastinum is a PMBCL, but could also be a usual DLBCL 
that happens to present there. (A. Rosenwald et al, J Exp Med , 2003; J. Yuan 
et al, Am J Surg Path ,  2015). Several assays for COO have been published in 
the literature.  The original methods used snap frozen tissues and the 
Affymetrix gene expression profiling system, which are now accepted by 
experts as a “gold standard” for COO classification of DLB CL and PMBCL 
respective ly (G. Wright et al, PNAS  2003; A. Rosenwald J Exp Med  2003); 
but both are expensive, have a poor turn -around time, and the Affymetrix 
platform does not perform well with FFPE tissue input.  The LLMPP 
research consortium, beginning with the original “discovery” methods, 
developed a GEP method that is accurate  and useful in FFPE tissues.  
 
B. Describe the expected distribution of the biomarker in the study population.  Justify 
the number of patients and specimens to determine feasibility and to demonstrate that 
the studies are likely to produce interpretable results.  
As per the prior LLMPP publication using GEP on frozen tissues, we expect that 
80% of patients with an initial diagnosis of PMBCL will classify as PMBCL 
using the molecular method with the rest being DLBCL (A. Rosenwald et al, J 
Exp Med, 2003). As per our prior publications we further expect that the 
DLBCL will subtype as approximately 50% GCB, 35% ABC, and 15% UNC (S. 
Kendrick et al, Leuk Lymph 2016). The response rates will be compared to GEP 
classification to determine whether there is a specific subtype  that correlates 
with treatment response. Given that this is a phase II study, descriptive statistics 
will be used to explore these COO and treatment associations.  
 
C. If cutpoints will be used, specify the cutpoint(s) and describe how these will be used 
in the trial.  Provide the rationale for the cutpoint(s) selected.  What proportion of 
subjects is expected to have values above and below the proposed assay value 
cutpo ints?  What magnitude of effect (e.g., treatment benefit) or outcome (e.g., 
prognosis) is expected for patients with assay results above and below the proposed 
cutpoint(s)?  
NCI Protocol #:10193  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Version Date: July 13 , 2021  
 
116 The cut -points for classification are pre -set at a  probability score  of 10% and 
90%  as generated from the locked Lymph3Cx algorithm, which was previously 
trained and validated. The results are first classified into PMBCL or not -
PMBCL or an uncertain category.  Then the non -PMBCL cases (DLBCL) are 
further classified into one of 3 subtypes  such that DLBCL -ABC (equal to or 
greater than 90% probability score), germinal center B cell subtype (less than or 
equal to 10% probability of being an ABC type), and uncl assifiable category (for 
all probabilities between 10 -90%). It is expected that 60 -70% of DLBCL patients 
will have the GCB subtype of DLBCL. We do not know if there will be a 
correlation between PMBCL, DLBCL -GCB or DLBCL -ABC subtype and 
clinical outcome in  this trial. The data will be collected retrospectively for 
correlation.  
 
D. Describe the conditions under which treating physicians and or patients will be able 
to access the biomarker assay results.  
The treating physicians will not have access to these biomarker results, only the 
Principal Investigator will have access and then only after the clinical trial has 
completed accrual.  The patients will not have access to the results at any time.

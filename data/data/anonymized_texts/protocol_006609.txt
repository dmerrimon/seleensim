Study  Design:  Randomized , double -blind  (cigarette nicotine content) , multi-center study that 
will examine the impact of cigarette nicotine content, e -liquid (vaping device) 
nicotine content and e -liquid flavor choices on smoking behavior.  
Primary Aim:  To evalu ate the impact of very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes, e -liquid 
nicotine content, and e -liquid flavoring on the total number of cigarettes 
(combined study  plus non-study) .  The hypothesis is that r elative to normal 
nicotine content ( NNC) cigarettes , VLNC cigarettes will reduce cigarettes 
smoked as well as reduce cigarette dependence, reduce exposure to 
toxicants, increase use of the vaping device  and increase abstinence from 
cigarettes . These differences between VLNC and NNC cigarettes will be 
great er when participants are provided e-liquids  with higher nicotine 
concentration and a choice of both tobacco and non -tobacco flavors.  
Secondary 
Aim: To test the impact of nicotine content in cigarettes, nicotine concentration of e -
liquids , and access to no n-tobacco flavors of e -liquids  on subjective effects. 
The hypothesis is that relative to NNC, VLNC cigarettes will decrease the 
positive effects of smoking and increase withdrawal. Conversely, vaping will 
produce more positive effects and withdrawal relief  in participants assigned to 
VLNC vs. NNC cigarettes. These differences in the effects of vaping  (betw een 
participants assigned VLNC vs. NNC cigarettes) will be greater when e -liquids  
a) are available in both tobacco and non -tobacco flavors (po sitive effec ts); and 
b) when e -liquids  have 1.8% vs. 0.3%  nicotine (positive effects and withdraw al 
relief).   
Population:  Cigarette smokers not intending to quit, who have also tried vaping.  
Study 
Procedures:  Subjects will undergo one week of monitoring of usual bra nd cigarette 
smoking. They will then be randomly assigned to one of eight experimental 
groups  (2x2x2 design)  receiving: study cigarettes with low versus  normal levels 
of nicotine ; e-liquids with 0.3%  versus  1.8%  nicotine content ; and choice of e-
liquid  flavors described as tobacco v ersus  tobacco and non -tobacco flavors . 
All subjects will be able to use these products for a period of 12 weeks. Both 
subjects and study staff will be blind to  the nicotine content of the cigarette; e -
liquid  nicotine content and  flavor will be open label.  After the 12 -week 
experimental phase, there will be a final, 30 -day follow -up visit.  
Accrual Goal:  480; 60 people in each of the 8 experimental conditions

17OCTOBER2019  Page 7 of 66 confidential  1. Background  
1.1. Tobacco Regulation  
Over 44 million people in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2002)  and 
1.2 billion worldwide smoke cigarettes (2014; Shafey & American Cancer Society, 2009) .  With 
480,000 deaths per year in the US and 6 million per year world -wide with speculations of 7 million 
deaths per year if current trends in smoking continue through 2020 (Shafey & American Cancer 
Society, 2009) , it is critical to have strong tobacco  control policies in place to minimize the casualties 
from tobacco use.  
According to Orleans and Slade (1993)  and Giovino (2002) , there are four main targets for tobacco 
control:  the Agent, the Vector, the Host and the Environment.  Most recent tobacco control efforts 
have been aimed at the Host (tobacco prevention and cessation programs), the Environme nt 
(policies such as smoking bans, increased taxes, anti -smoking media campaigns, advertisement 
bans, pictorial warning labels) and the Vector (tobacco law suits).  Relatively little attention has been 
focused on the Agent (the tobacco product). Altering t obacco products in ways to reduce mortality 
and morbidity that complement current tobacco control measures may be an important next step in 
tobacco control.  
The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA) passed in 2009 provides the 
FDA with  the authority to regulate tobacco products.  One provision in this legislative act empow ers 
the FDA to set limits on constituents in tobacco products, including nicotine if the nicotine levels are 
not reduced to zero.  Such a measure has the potential to reduce the chance of individuals 
experimenting with smoking from becoming dependent and enable current smokers to quit when 
they are motivated to do so.  Although the proposal to reduce nicotine in cigarettes has been met 
with skepticism by some because of  concerns over compensatory smoking behavior and the 
potential emergence of a black market (Jarvis & Bates, 1999; Kozlowski, 2015, 2016, 2017; 
Shatenstein, 1999) , this policy measure was considered to be technicall y feasible by the American 
Medical Association and the British Medical Association (Henningfield et al., 1998) , by tobacco 
control researchers, policymakers and governmental officials who were convened in a meeting on 
nicotine regulation (Hatsukami, Perkins, et al., 2010) , and by the WHO Study Group on Tobacco 
Product Regulation  (TobReg, 2015) . Most importantly, in July 2017, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb 
announced he was “directing our Center for Tobacco Products to develop a comprehensive nicotine 
regulatory pla n premised on the need to confront and alter cigarette addiction .” This announcement 
was followed on March 16, 2018 by the  release of the  Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
entitled “ Tobacco Product Standard for Nicotine Level of Combusted Cigarettes ” (ID: FDA-2017 -N-
6189 -0001 ) “to obtain information for consideration in developing a tobacco product standard to set 
the maximum  nicotine level for  cigarettes .”  
1.2. Effects of Very Low Nicotine Content Cigarettes  
Studies of very low nicotine content cigarettes (VLNC; e.g., <2.4 mg/g) suggest that, acutely, they 
produce many effects in smokers that are qualitatively similar to normal nicotine content (NNC; e.g., 
15.8 mg/g) cigarettes, but with somewhat reduced efficacy.  VLNC cigarettes reinforce behavior 
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 8 of 66 confidential  (Shahan  et al., 1999; Shahan et al., 2001), maintaining similar rates of self -administration as NNC 
cigarettes in brief sessions even though participants prefer NNC cigarettes when given a choice 
(Shahan et al., 1999).  Compared to not smoking, VLNC cigarettes in crease ratings of satisfaction 
and liking (Donny et al., 2007; Donny & Jones, 2009; Rose et al., 2000), although the magnitude of 
these effects is typically reduced compared to those produced by NNC cigarettes (Butschky et al., 
1995; Gross et al., 1997; Ro binson et al., 2000).  VLNC cigarettes also reduce withdrawal and 
craving (Pickworth et al., 1999), although some symptoms (e.g., restlessness, impatience) may be 
more effectively alleviated by NNC cigarettes (Buchhalter et al., 2005).   
Studies in which V LNC cigarettes were utilized over a longer period suggest potential benefits in 
terms of reduced smoking. When only VLNC cigarettes were available in an inpatient setting, the 
number of cigarettes smoked and the motivation to smoke during periods of abstin ence decreased 
over time (Donny et al., 2007).  Longer, outpatient studies have either found no change in smoking 
rates (Benowitz et al., 2007; Benowitz et al., 2009; Benowitz et al., 2012; Donny & Jones, 2009), or 
a significant decline in smoking rates (D onny et al., 2015; Hatsukami et al., 2010).  Some studies 
have also shown that VLNC cigarettes reduce nicotine dependence (Hatsukami et al., 2010) and 
increase quit attempts (Donny et al., 2015). In one study conducted among individuals interested in 
quitting smoking, there was a significant increase in smoking cessation (Hatsukami et al., 2010).   
There is very little evidence of adverse outcomes associated with VLNC use, including 
compensatory smoking. As noted above, data available to date indicate that the number of cigarettes 
smoked per day tends to decrease, not increase, over time (Donny et al., 2015; Donny & Jones, 
2009; Hatsukami, Kotlyar, et al., 2010) .  Furthermore, participants tend to reduce the volume o f 
smoke inhaled and some studies have reported significant decreases in expired carbon monoxide 
(CO) (Donny & Jones, 2009; Hatsukami et al., 2010).  If compensatory smoking occurs, it appears 
to be short -lived (Macq ueen et al., 2012; Strasser, Lerman, Sanborn, Pickworth, & Feldman, 2007)  
and may be more likely in heavily dependent smokers (Bandiera et al., 2015) .  Likewise, few other 
unintended consequences have been identif ied. In our recent clinical trial, there was also no 
evidence of an increase in depressive symptoms among those with higher depression scores at 
baseline (Tidey et al., 2017)  and no evidence of an increase in alcoh ol or marijuana use (Dermody 
et al., 2016; Pacek et al., 2016) . However, individuals who were compliant with the VLNC cigarettes 
did gain weight over a six -week intervention period at a rate similar to what might b e expected during 
smoking cessation (Rupprecht et al., 2016) . 
Most studies to date provide smokers with only two options: smoke free study cigarettes or abstain 
from using tobacco, with clear instructions to not us e non -study products. In this context, most 
smokers not only continue to smoke, but, despite instructions to the contrary, continue to use non -
study cigarettes. Based on self -report, more than 75% of participants assigned to VLNC cigarettes 
use at least on e non -study (normal nicotine) cigarette during trials that last 6 weeks or longer, 
typically smoking 2 -4 non -study cigarettes on at least a third of the days (Benowitz et al., 2015; 
Donny et al., 2015) . Consequentl y, nicotine exposure (as measured by urine total nicotine 
equivalents) only decreases by about 60% compared to the 97% reduction of nicotine content in the 
product (Donny et al., 2015) . This pervasive noncompliance  may attenuate the effects of VLNC 
cigarettes on abstinence (Dermody, Donny, Hertsgaard, & Hatsukami, 2015) , but it also likely 
foreshadows how patterns of product use would evolve if nicotine product standards wer e enacted 
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 9 of 66 confidential  for combusted tobacco. Some may seek out black market cigarettes or tamper with cigarettes to 
increase nicotine delivery, but many others may turn to easily accessible alternative products.   
1.3. Very Low Nicotine Content Cigarettes and Vaping Device s 
Vaping devices (e.g., e -cigarettes, vape pens, mods) use liquid that often contains nicotine, as well 
as varying compositions of flavorings, propylene glycol, glycerin, and other ingredients. The liquid is 
heated into an aerosol that the user inhales. Va ping devices have rapidly emerged as a commonly 
used non -combusted product in the U.S. (Agaku et al., 2014; Arrazola et al., 2015)  with a rule by 
FDA that they be deemed a “tobacco product” ("Deeming tobacco products to subject to the federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmet ic Act, as amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control 
Act," 2016)  with premarket review of products required as of August, 2022 . Our preliminary study 
suggests that approximately half of all smokers switched to VLNC cigarettes will try v aping devices 
when provided the opportunity (far more than any other non -combusted tobacco product; Hatsukami 
et al., 2017). Interestingly, there was a negative association between smoking VLNC cigarettes and 
use of alternative products which is consistent  with evidence that vaping devices can function as a 
substitute for conventional cigarettes (Polosa, 2015) . However, we know little about how the 
characteris tics of vaping devices impact VLNC use and, conversely, how nicotine reduction in 
cigarettes impacts the use of vaping devices with different characteristics. Both nicotine and non -
nicotine factors may be important.  This gap is important given FDA’s inten tion “to address the issue 
of flavored tobacco products” while “not altering the nicotine content of noncombustible products 
such as e -cigarettes” (Gottleib, July 28, 2017)  
1.3.1.  Nicotine  
Nicotine delivered via vaping devices may serve a variety of functions tha t support its actions as 
a reinforcer and an appealing alternative to smoking VLNC cigarettes. Some vaping devices can 
deliver as much or more (among experienced users) nicotine as a traditional cigarette with a 
relatively rapid rat e of absorption (Tmax ≤ 5 min) (Spindle, Breland, Karaoghlanian, Shihadeh, & 
Eissenberg, 2015) . In devices similar to the one proposed here, e -liquids with 18 -36 mg/ml 
produce cigarette -like increases in plasma nic otine concentrations after 10 puffs while lower 
nicotine content e -liquids produce smaller and short -lived increases in plasma nicotine (Lopez et 
al., 2016; Hiler et al., 2017). This pharmacokinetic profile suggests that vaping devices may have 
greater pos itive reinforcing effects than VLNC cigarettes (Ramoa et al., 2016) . Vaping devices 
can also be used throughout the day to maintain nicotine levels that would otherwise fall by 95% 
or more if smokers  use only VLNC cigarettes (Denlinger et al., 2016) . Inde ed, vaping devices 
reduce withdrawal symptoms in cigarette smokers (Dawkins, Turner, & Crowe, 2013; Dawkins, 
Turner, Hasna, & Soar, 2012) , and this suppression is dependent on the nicotine concentration 
of the e -liquid (Dawkins et al., 2012) . Relatedly, greater nicotine delivery may also result in 
increased risk of dependence on vaping devices (Etter & Eissenberg, 2015) . Finally, nicotine 
also acts peripherally on receptors in the oropha ryngeal cavity which may contribute to sensory 
effects (discussed below) that might generalize across products. Together, these data suggest 
that vaping devices that effectively deliver nicotine may be more likely to function as both positive 
and negative reinforcers and more able to compete with the reduced reinforcing effects of VLN C 
cigarettes.   
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 10 of 66 confidential  1.3.2.  Non-nicotine factors  
Vaping devices have a somewhat unique feature relative to other alternative nicotine delivery 
systems such as the patch or gum – they can p rovide sensorimotor stimuli similar to combusted 
cigarettes, including a smoke -like vapor and a tobacco -like flavor. Decades of research highlight 
the importance of sensorimotor stimuli in maintaining behavior even when nicotine is absent 
(Caggiula et al., 2001; Rose, 2006) . Stimuli associated with nicotine can elicit craving (Bake r, 
2015) , increase the probability of use (Thornley et al., 2009) , increase positive subjective 
experiences (Furlow, 2015; Glover & McRobbie, 2015; McNeill et al., 2015; McRobbie et al., 
2015) , reduce withdrawal (Hajek et al., 2015; Kalousova, 2015; McRobbie et al., 2015) , and 
support behavior even in the absence of the drug (McRobbie, Bullen, Hartmann -Boyce, & Hajek , 
2014; McRobbie et al., 2010) . These data suggest that the sensorimotor experience is an 
important determinant of whether a product will substitute for traditional cigarettes. Vaping 
devices may serve this function better than other alternative products which might explain both 
why they were chosen most often in our pilot study (Hatsukami et al., 2017) and why they 
attenuate withdrawal in cigarette users even if they do not deliver nicotine (Vansickel, Cobb, 
Weaver , & Eissenberg, 2010) . 
Vaping device e -liquids are also available in a variety of non -tobacco flavors that may impact the 
appeal and reinforcing effects of the product. The full impact of flavors on vaping devices use is 
still unknown, but it seems likely  that the availability of non -tobacco flavors influences the 
likelihood of use. Recent estimates are that 53% of adults use vaping devices with flavors other 
than tobacco (Yingst et al., 2015) . Other studies also s upported this assumption, demonstrating 
that liquid flavor choices influence appeal and choice of vaping device (Shiffman, Sembower, 
Pillitteri, Gerlach, & Gitchell, 2015; Yingst et al., 2015) . If flavors impact th e appeal of vaping 
devices, they may also impact the likelihood that smokers will switch from VLNC cigarettes to 
these products.  
2. Study Plan and Procedures  
2.1. Study Design  
480 smokers will rec eive Spectrum cigarettes , a vaping device  (Halo Triton  650 mAh and 2.4 ml 
tank with a 2.2-2.4 ohm coil), and an adequate supply of e -liquid for twelve weeks. After a screening 
visit, when eligibility is confirmed, participants will complete a baseline session where they will be 
provided with their usual brand of cigarette s to smoke for one week. Participants will then complete 
a randomization visit in which they are randomized into one of eight groups. Participants will either 
receive VLNC or NNC Spectrum cigarettes (double blind), e -liquid that is either low nicotine ( 0.3 % 
or 3 mg/ml) or contains a moderate level of nicotine ( 1.8% or 18 mg/ml), and will choose up to three 
flavors – either from a selection of flavors characterized as similar to tobacco, or from a selection of 
flavors characterized as similar to tobacco  as well as other non -tobacco flavors (e.g., blueberry ). 
Over 12 weeks of the experimental phase, they will use these products ad libitum attending weekly 
laboratory visits for the first four weeks and biweekly visits from Week 6 to 12.   At Week 12, 
participa nts will be required to return their study products. Participants can quit smoking or vaping 
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 11 of 66 confidential  at any time during the study; if participants are interested in quitting they will be provided appropriate 
resources. Approximately 30 days after the week 12 visit , they will return to the lab for a follow up 
visit to assess smoking behavior and biomarkers of exposure.

2.2. Pilot  
Up to four subjects (only at the Wake Forest site) will complete an abbreviated pilot procedure before 
implementing the full p rotocol for the purpose of staff training and evaluating the planned 
procedures. Interested participants will be recruited (as described in Section 3.1) and consented 
with a pilot -study specific consent form (as described in Section 3.2).  Up to 12 partici pants will be 
screened (as described in Sections 3.3 -3.6) and enrolled to achieve four completers. Stratification 
variables outlined in Section 3.7 will not be implemented.  Investigational cigarettes (i.e., Spectrum) 
will not be used; usual brand cigarett es will be used in their place. The vaping device (Halo Triton  
650 mAh and 2.4 ml tank  with a 2. 2-2.4 ohm coil) and e -liquids will be as proposed in the main 
protocol. One week a fter the screening visit,  eligible p articipants will complete the “Randomizati on 
Visit” (described in Section 5) in which they will be assigned one of the four e -liquid conditions 
(described in Section 2.3.2) in the following order (note: assignment of pilot subjects is not random): 
1) e-liquid that is low nicotine (0.3 % or 3  mg/ml ) and available only in tobacco flavors; 2) e-liquid 
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 12 of 66 confidential  that is moderate nicotine (1.8 % or 18  mg/ml) and available only in tobacco flavors; 3) e-liquid that 
is low nicotine (0.3 % or 3  mg/ml) and available in tobacco and non -tobacco flavors; 4) e-liquid that  
is moderate nicotine (1.8 % or 18  mg/ml) and available in tobacco and non -tobacco flavors . The pilot 
procedure experimental phase will last 2 weeks. After 1 week, participants will complete what is 
described in this protocol as the “Week 3 visit” and afte r 2 weeks  participants will complete what is 
described in this protocol as the “Week 12 visit.”  At the last experimental lab visit , participants will 
be required to return their study products. The 30 -day follow -up visit will not be conducted. 
Participants  can quit smoking or vap ing at any time during the pilot ; if participants are interested in 
quitting they will be provided appropriate resources . Compensation will be provided as outlined in

2.3 Study Products  
2.3.1 Investigational Cigarettes  
The National Institute on Drug Abuse has made  available  investigation al cigarettes that v ary in 
nicotine content for research  purposes (NOT -DA-14-004).  We h ave used these cigarettes in 
previous studies (e.g., Donny et al., 2015).  The specific products and nicotine/tar yields are 
reported below.  All products are manufactured by 22nd Century and distributed by the Research 
Triangle Institute (RTI) for NIDA. The NNC cigarettes contain approximately 15.8 mg nicotine per 
g of tobacco.  The VLNC cigarettes contain approximately 0.4 mg nicotine per g of tobacco.  
Additional information including machine generated nicotine and tar yields is provided below  and 
detaile d product information including storage requirements can be found in the Investigator 
Brochure.

2.3.2  Vaping Devices  
All participants will receive identical vaping devices – the Halo Triton (3.7 V battery; 650 mAh) and 
compatible Triton 2.4 ml refillable tank with 2.2-2.4 ohm coil. Participants will be instructed o n how  
to fill them with their assigned e -liquid by study staff, and will refill them as needed during the trial. 
All e-liquid will be purchased from Syndicate  Distribution (previously known as Nicopure Labs ) with 
a base of 70% propylene glycol and 30% vege table glycerin. Nicotine concentration will be either 
(0.3 % or 3 mg/ml ) or (1.8%  or 18 mg/ml ), depending on randomization group ( open -label). E-liquids 
will be stored at room temperature and protected from sustained direct light.  Participants will either  
choose between tobacco flavors only or between tobacco flavors and additional non -tobacco flavors  
(open label) . Participants will take home three 10 -ml bottles of e -liquid solution each week (six 10 -
ml bottles for bi -weekly visits), and will choose up to three flavors from a menu of e -liquid choices. 
Tobacco flavor choices include: a “robust” tobacco flavor, a “light” tobacco flavor, and a tobacco -
menthol combination flavor.  Non -tobacco flavors include: three fruit flavors (berry, blueberry , 
watermelon), three dessert flavors (cookies and crème, chocolate , caramel), and three mint flavors 
(peppermint, spearmint and menthol).  The device, tank, coils, and liquids were commercially 
available in the U.S. prior to August 8, 2016 (i.e., deeming date) and are the refore appropriate for 
use in this project.  The nicotine of the e -liquids will  be characterize d prior to the start of the study 
and at least annually thereafter  by the University of Minnesota , CENIC Biostatistics Core .

3.1. Recruitmen t  
Participants will be recruited from two sites: Wake Forest School of Medicine  (Site PI: Donny) and 
the University of Pennsylvania (Site PI: Strasser). Participants will be recruited through flyers, direct 
mailings, television, radio, newspaper, bus, soc ial media, online via our recruitment website, the 
CTSI Registry, and Craigslist advertisements that read, “ If you smoke, we could use your help. If 
you’re (age 18-24 or 25 or older ), smoke and have tried e -cigarettes or vaping multiple times, you 
may be e ligible for a 4 month study on tobacco use —during which you will be paid for your time and 
effort. This is NOT intended as a treatment for smoking. ”  Additional ads will be run as needed 
target ing smokers who would fit under -enrolled age categories . These ads will be identical but 
specify  the age range ( “age 18 -24…” “age 25 or older…”).  Individuals who are interested will leave 
their contact information on a voicemail, or enter it on a form on our website. Research staff will call 
each participant and read a script briefly explaining the study.  After verbal informed consent is 
received, the participants will be asked questions over the phone to determine initial eligibility. If 
eligible and interested, they will be scheduled for an informational session dur ing which they will be 
provided with a copy of the consent document and shown a PowerPoint presentation that outlines 
the procedures, benefits/risks, compensation and the participants’ rights. They will also be able to 
ask questions about the study.  They will receive $10 in transportation costs for the informational 
session.  If they are still interested in participation, then they will be scheduled for an in -person 
screening visit.  Potential participants will be instructed to bring a pack of their usual b rand cigarettes, 
all prescription medications they are currently taking, and a valid, state -issued p hoto ID to the 
screening visit . Acceptable forms of identification include a Driver’s License, State Photo ID Card, 
State Voter ID Card, Passport, or Milita ry ID. If the potential participant does not have a valid, state 
issued photo ID, the interviewer can provide him/her with information on obtaining one. Participants  
will be given the option to receive study information and visit reminders by phone, email,  and text 
message.  
A participant must complete his/her in -person screening session within 30 days of completing the 
telephone recruitment questionnaire.  If the participant is not able to attend the in -person screening 
visit in that timeframe, he/she will need to complete the telephone recruitment questionnaire again 
and will be given a new REDCap ID number.  
3.2. Informed Consent Process  
Before beginning the informed consent process, participants will need to produce valid, state issued 
photo identification. The  interviewer will confirm the age and identity of the participant.  If the 
participant is not age 18 or older, he/she will be dismissed without payment.  During the in -person 
screening session, study information will be presented and written, informed cons ent will be required 
to participate in the screening.  To ensure adequate informed consent, participants will be asked to 
read the first several lines aloud (to determine literacy) and will then be given ample time to read the 
consent document.  If the int erviewer determines that the participant is not literate, he/she will 
dismiss the person from the study.  The interviewer will review the PowerPoint presentation if 
necessary.  The participant will be instructed to read several open -ended questions aloud a nd 
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 15 of 66 confidential  discuss the answers with the researcher. Only after the participant and the researcher are fully 
satisfied that the participant understands the purpose of the study, the confidentiality of the data, the 
procedures, the risks/benefits and his/her rights as a research participant will the consent form be 
signed and the participant undergo screening procedures.  
3.3. Screening Procedures  
Physiological measures  collected  and recorded on paper, and entered into REDCap by the 
interviewer at the end of the visit:  
 
1. Breath alcohol concentration (BrAC)   
2. Expired breath carbon monoxide (CO) . 
3. Urinary cotinine strips , if needed  
4. A urine toxicological screen   
5. Weight and height   
6. Pregnancy Tests (HCG detection)   
7. Blood pressure and heart rate   
 
Screening  questionnaires administ ered on paper and entered into the study databases at the 
end of the visit:  
1. Identifying Information Form   
2. Brief Medical History Questionnaire  
3. Prime MD  
 
Screening assessments administered via interview and entered into REDCap by the 
interviewer : 
1. Concomitant  Medications Form  
2. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) suicide subscale   
3. Tobacco Use History Questionnaire  
4. Smoking Cessation Therapy Use Questionnaire  
5. Drug Use Questionnaire  (12 month and 1 month version)  
 
Assessment s administered on p aper and kept as a source document only:  
1. Brief M edical History Follow -Up Questionnaire , if needed  
2. BDI, if needed  
3. GAD 2 week monitoring,  if needed

1. Demographic Questionnaire  
2. Center for Epidemiologica l Studies -Depression Scale  
3. Alcohol Use Questionnaire  (12 month and 1 month version)  
4. Smoking Stages of Change  
 
If the Redcap website is not functioning, the assessments will be printed out and administered on 
paper.  The source documents will be kept in th e participant’s binder.  The interviewer will enter the 
data into Redcap when it resumes functioning properly.  This information should be recorded in the 
‘End of Visit Evaluation Form’ and entered in to REDCap.  
The following task will be completed  after i nitial eligibility determination by the research 
assistant  (prior to review by medical staff) :  
1. Puff topography  entails having participants smoke through a device that more precisely 
measures puffing behavior (e.g., puff volume). At screening, participants  will smoke a usual 
brand cigarette through the topography device.  
3.4. Eligibility Determination  
Research staff will determine initial eligibility after reviewing all eligibility criteria except for the 
medical/psychiatric history.  If the participant is deemed  eligible,  he/she will complete the puff 
topography assessment, be trained on using the IVR system ( see Section 9 ), and be scheduled to 
come in for the baseline visit.  Participants will be instructed to use tobacco products as usual 
between the screening visit and the baseline visit.  
Final eligibility of the participant will be determined by a  licensed medical monitor (LMM) after 
reviewing the Brief Medical History Questionnaire, Medical History Follow -Up Questionnaire and the 
MINI suicide subscale.  If t he participant's score on the Prime MD indicates a psychiatric disorder, 
then the Prime MD will be submitted to the licensed medical monitor for review as well.  Additionally, 
if the participant's score on the Prime MD indicates Major Depressive Disorder, then the Prime MD 
along with the Beck Depression Inventory will be submitted for review.  The LM M will sign off prior 
to the Baseline Visit that the participant is medically stable to receive the study product(s).  The LM M 
will not review the medical histo ry forms of participants who are not eligible for other, non -medical 
reasons.  
Once all the screening procedures have been completed, researchers will pay ineligible participants 
$30 for their time as long as they pass the drug and breath e alcohol tests and  meet the minimum 
requirements for carbon monoxide or urinary cotinine levels.  Those participants who do not pass 
these tests or meet these requirements will be dismissed from the study without payment.  If a 
participant does not pass the drug test but ha s a current, valid prescription that would explain the 
failed test, then he/she will not be automatically excluded and will still receive $ 30.   
At the end of the Screening/Baseline Visit, the researcher will complete the End of Visit Evaluation 
Form, whic h will be entered into REDCap. This will allow the researcher to make note of any

CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 19 of 66 confidential  32. Previous adverse reactions when using vaping devices . 
 
Children under age 18 are excluded because they cannot legally buy cigarettes.  Those wit h 
unstable medical or psychiatric conditions are excluded as these symptoms could affect a 
participant’s ability to complete the study.  Examples include but are not limited to the following: 
angina, stroke, heart attack which occurred since phone screenin g, blood clots in the arms or legs 
for which the individual is undergoing active medical treatment, cancer requiring active 
chemotherapy or radiation therapy, severe shortness of breath caused by conditions such as 
uncontrolled asthma, COPD, or arrhythmia,  active untreated infection such as pneumonia, active 
untreated endocrine disorder such as hyperthyroidism.  The LM M can also exclude participants for 
conditions in which participation is likely to pose a significant threat to health or for which the 
condi tion could interfere with the ability of the participant to fully participate  (e.g. severe allergic 
reaction to propylene glycol  or vegetable  glycerin found in e -liquids) . We will exclude those currently 
seeking smoking treatment, those who have quit smoki ng for longer than 3 days in the past 30 days 
or are planning to quit in the next 60 days, as participation in this study may not lead to reductions 
in smoking.  We will exclude pregnant and nursing women and anyone with current or recent alcohol 
or drug a buse problems as these factors could independently affect smoking behavior during the 
study.  Individuals with baseline CO readings greater than 80 ppm, those with heart rate or blood 
pressure readings that are out of range and anyone who has attempted sui cide in the past five years 
will be excluded from the study for safety concerns. Participants currently prescribed one of the 
medications listed will be excluded because this medication could interfere with the biomarkers or 
possibly cause an adverse smoki ng-drug interaction if there are changes in smoking behavior.  If an 
individual has recently participated in a smoking research study that changed his/her smoking 
behavior, this person would be excluded because he/she would not have a stable smoking baseli ne.  
Because participants are required to complete portions of the protocol independently both in the lab 
and at home, they will need to be able to independently read and comprehend the study materials.  
Multiple participants within the same household may not enroll concurrently to avoid product 
exchanging.  Very frequent use of vaping devices is exclusionary to target individuals who are 
primarily cigarette smokers and to decrease the likelihood that a participant will have a vaping device 
they find more s atisfying than the study vaping device. However, individuals must have at least tried 
vaping devices  at least on 2 separate occasions , without an allergic or otherwise adverse 
experience, to maximize the likelihood that participants will try the vaping dev ice provided to them.  
3.7. Stratification  
Throughout the study, we will stratify by menthol status ( no required sample size ) and age range 
(no required sample size  18-24/25+). We recognize that it will likely be more  challenging to recruit 
young adults. We wil l make use of targeted recruitment strategies (e.g., social media for the 
recruitment of young adults).  
4. Baseline Visit  
4.1. Baseline  Visit Scheduling Requirements  
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 20 of 66 confidential  Participants will return for a baseline visit one week after their screening visit. The ideal visit window 
is 6-10 days, but could be extended to as many as 21 days if necessary. If the participant is unable 
to attend the baseline visit within 21 -days, they will not be eligible to continue. At this visit they will 
complete a variety of assessments and  will be provided with a 14 -day supply of their usual brand 
cigarette to smoke between the baseline visit and the randomization visit.  
4.2.  Baseline Visit Procedures  
Physiological measures collected  and recorded on paper, and entered into REDCap at the 
end of  the visit:  
1. BrAC  
2. Weight  
3. CO 
4. Blood Pressure  (lab visit & Product evaluation)  
5. Heart Rate  (lab visit & Product evaluation)  
 
Biological specimens collected, stored, and entered into CENIC Biosample Collection 
Platform:  
1. Saliva sample :  
Participants will be asked  to provide two saliva samples during the Baseline Visit for 
assessment of nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), an indicator of CYP2A6 enzyme activity.  
Participants must wait 30 minutes after arrival to the lab before collecting the first saliva 
sample. Durin g this time, participants cannot eat, drink, chew gum or use tobacco/nicotine 
products.  After collecting the sample, the participant is provided time to eat and/or drink and 
must wait another 30 minutes before collecting the second saliva sample.  Samples  will be 
stored at temperatures approximately at -20°C (UPenn) or -80°C (Wake Forest) . Saliva 
samples will be sent regularly to be analyzed and stored at the University of Minnesota.  
 
2. First void urine sample for smoking biomarker assessment :  
Participants  will be asked to bring a urine sample (first void of the day) to the Randomization 
Visit for biomarker assessment.  Samples will be stored at temperatures approximately at -
20°C (UPenn) or -80°C (Wake Forest) .  Urine samples will be sent regularly to be a nalyz ed 
and stored at the University of Minnesota.  We will assess mercapturic acids  (markers of 
exposure to volatile organic compounds)  and total nicotine equivalents (TNEs ; a measure of 
nicotine exposure ). If a participant forgets to bring his/her urine sample, then the spot urine 
sample will be used.  
 
 
3. Spot urine sample for assessing baseline anatabine:  
Participants will be asked to provide a urine sample in the lab for biomarker assessment. 
Samples will be stored at temperatures approximately at -20°C (UPenn) or -80°C (Wake 
Forest) .  Urine samples will be sent regularly to be analyzed for anatabine (a non -nicotine

4. Smoking Expectancies and Vaping Expectancies Questionnaires  
5. Vaping Utility Questionnaire  
6. Perceived  Health Risks Questionnaire : Usual Bra nd 
Tasks completed at baseline : 
1. Product evaluation: will be assessed after participants take 4 puffs of their usual brand 
cigarette at baseline. Following the sampling period, participants will complete  the Cigarette 
Evaluation Scale  (CES), which assesses the extent to which the product they just sampled 
produced various subjective effects including satisfaction, good taste, dizziness, reduced 
appetite, nausea, and enjoyable sensations in the throat and chest on a 7 point Likert -type 
scale . We will also ass ess changes in heart rate and blood pressure related to smoking.  
4.3. Distributing Usual Brand Cigarettes  
Participants will receive a supply of their usual brand cigarette to smoke between the baseline visit 
and the randomization visit. Participants will recei ve a 14 -day supply and be instructed to bring their 
entire supply (empty packs and unused cigarettes) to the randomization visit. Participants will be 
notified that failure to return products throughout the study will result in removal from the study.   
5. Randomization Visit  
5.1. Randomization Visit Scheduling Requirements  
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 22 of 66 confidential  The ideal target window between the baseline and randomization visit is 6 to 10 days.  However, in 
rare cases, the window may be extended to as many as 21 days after the baseline visit. If the v isit 
window is extended beyond 10 days, the participant will receive a larger supply of usual brand 
cigarettes (see Product Distribution section). If a participant cancels and reschedules their 
randomization visit outside of the 10 -day window, staff will e ncourage the participant to return to the 
lab for an unanticipated visit to obtain additional product. If the participant is unable to attend the 
randomization visit within 21 -days, they will not be eligible to continue.  
5.2. Experimental Conditions  
During the Randomization Visit, participants (N=480 ; 240 per site ) will be randomized equally into 
one of eight experimental conditions. Participants will be assigned a cigarette that matches their 
menthol preference. Groups will be stratified by age and menthol stat us with no required sample 
size.

The source documents will be kept in the participant’s binder .  The interviewer will enter the data into 
Redcap when it resumes functioning properly.  This information should be recorded in the ‘End of Visit 
Evaluation Form’ and entered in to REDCap.  
The following tasks  will be completed  after participants are rando mized :  
1. Product evaluation  will be assessed after participants take four puffs of each assigned 
product with a 30 -second inter -puff interval, and a 15 -minute inter -product interval 
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 24 of 66 confidential  (Randomization, Weeks 02, 04, 08, and 12). Following each sampling period, participants 
will complete the Cigarette Evaluation Scale  (CES; modified to apply to both cigarettes and 
vaping devices), which assesses the extent to which the product they just sampled produced 
various subjective effects including satisfaction, good tast e, dizziness, reduced appetite, 
nausea, and enjoyable sensations in the throat and chest on a 7 point Likert -type scale . We 
will also assess changes in heart rate and blood pressure related to each product.  
 
2. Preference Task  will consist of a series of 10 choice trials, each lasting 1 minute , with a 2 
minute inter -trial interval.  During each trial, participants will be presented (via computer) 
with a choice between taking 2 puffs of the cigarette, 2 puffs of the e-cigarette,  or 
abstaining . Indices derived from this task include: total number of cigarette puffs; total 
number of vaping device puffs; and total number of choices to abstain from product use.  
Researchers will complete the End of Visit Evaluation Form, which will be entered into REDCap.  This 
will allow the researcher to make note of any problems encountered during the visit  and to assess the 
truthfulness of the participant in regard to self -report of tobacco use.  
6. Experimental Phase  
6.1.  Study Product Distribution  
The Administrative Core for the Cente r for the Evaluation of Nicotine in Cigarettes (CENIC) will be 
responsible for removing all identifying information from cigarettes received from the Research 
Triangle Institute (RTI), labeling each carton with a blind code, assigning product using this bl ind 
code based on the randomization schedule being provided by the CENIC Biostatistics Core, and 
shipping cigarettes to each site as needed based on recruitment.  The site will be responsible for 
tracking product received and distributed to participants, c ollecting unused product from participants, 
and destroying unused open packs.  The participants, investigators and study staff will not have 
knowledge of which product  is given to a participant or whether different participants received the 
same or differe nt product  with regards to study cigarettes.  
Between Visits  00, 01, 02, 03, and 04, participants will receive a 14 -day supply of research cigarettes 
at each visit. Between Visits 04, 06, 08, 10, and 12, participants will receive a 28 -day supply. This 
will ensure adequate availability of cigarettes in the numerous locations participants may typically 
keep a supply (home, work, vehicle, etc.) as well as avoid expending the entire supply if they miss 
a scheduled visit.   
Additionally, participants will rece ive two vaping device batteries  and one tank per flavor choice. 
Tanks  are refillable, but do need to be replaced occasionally. The Administrative Core will apply a 
product tracking label/ code to each e -liquid bottle. Product will be assigned using this code b ased 
on the randomization schedule being provided by the CENIC Biostatistics Core. Participants will 
receive three 10 -ml e-liquid bottles at each weekly visit (Visit 00, 01, 02, 03) and six 10 -ml bottles at 
each bi -weekly visit (Visit 04, 06, 08, 10), divi ded among as many as three different flavor choices. 
After choosing flavors, participants will fill an empty tank with each of their chosen e -liquid flavors in 
the lab with help of study staff. This process allows study staff to train participants on the p roper 
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 25 of 66 confidential  method for filling tanks . Participants will return their empty e -liquid bottles and any unused product 
at each weekly visit. Unopened e -liquid bottles will be considered full and all bottles with > 5 ml will  
be redistributed to the same participant i f participants choose the same flavor in a future week. If a 
participant loses their vaping device or e -liquids, we will provide replacements up to two times. If a 
participant loses their device or liquids more than twice, we may withdraw them from the stu dy. 
When participants are provided with their study vaping device for the first time, they will be told that 
losing their device or e -liquids multiple times may result in study withdrawal.  
If there is prior knowledge a participant will be missing a visit (e.g., planned vacation, laboratory 
closure, etc.), or a participant is unable to attend the randomization visit within the 10 -day window, 
then the participant will be provided with an adequate supply of study product until their next visit.  
The participa nt will be given a 21 -day supply of cigarettes if they will miss Visit 01, 02 or 03 or if the 
randomization visit is between 11 and 17 days from screening, a 28 -day supply of cigarettes if they 
will miss Visit 04 or the randomization visit is 18 or more da ys from screening, and a 35 -day supply 
of cigarettes if they will miss Visit 06, 08 or 10. For e -liquids, participant will be given 5 bottles (10 
ml each) if they will miss Visit 01, 02 or 03, 6 bottles if they will miss Visit 04, and 8 bottles if they 
will miss Visit 06, 08 or 10. In addition, participants can come to the laboratory during normal 
business hours to receive additional study product if needed.  
6.2. Study Product Accountability  
Participants will be required to keep track of the vaping device, tanks, and all the cigarettes and e -
liquid provided to them. They will be instructed to return all unused cigarettes and empty cigarette 
packs  and vaping device , tanks, and  e-liquid bottles  each week.  Because participants are provided 
with an ample supply of research cigarettes and e -liquid (to account for unanticipated missed visits 
or greater than anticipated use), they will be expected to return unused product at each visit to 
remain enrolled in the study.  
Research staff will complete the ‘Product Accountab ility Log’  directly in REDCap . Any discrepancies 
in the product dispensed versus product returned will be discussed and recorded in the log .  Empty 
cigarette packs and/or empty bottles  will be saved.  Unused cigarettes or bottles  will be redistributed 
to the participants during Visits 01 -12.  At Visit 10, participants will be made aware that they will be 
required to turn in all study products (cigarettes and vaping devices) at Visit 12.  
During the Experimental Phase, if participants lose cigarettes or e -liquids and require an 
unscheduled visit to the laboratory to supplement their supply, they will be told the next time they 
lose their supply of either product they will have to wait until their next scheduled appointment to 
receive more product.   
6.3. Experiment al Phase Visit Scheduling Requirements  
A computer -generated ideal visit calendar  will automatically generate the ideal visit windows  once 
the participant has been randomized.  If a participant misses a visit and is not able to reschedule 
during the window,  that visit will not be ‘made -up’ in the future.  All measures that were not completed 
will be considered missing data and will not be collected during future visits.  If a visit mistakenly 
occurs outside of the designated window, this is a protocol deviat ion.  A ‘ Protocol Deviation  Form’ 
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 26 of 66 confidential  will need to be completed and tracked in REDCap.  If a participan t is not able to attend Visit 12 , then 
it should be rescheduled even if it is outside of the scheduling window.  This will be documented as 
a protocol deviat ion. Participants that do not attend scheduled lab visits,  miss daily IVR phone calls, 
and do not respond to phone messages will be considered lost to follow -up. A certified letter  will be 
sent to notify them  as defi ned by  the site’s Standard Operating Pro cedure (SOP).

will enter the data into Redcap when it resumes functioning properly.  This inf ormation should be 
recorded in the ‘End of Visit Evaluation Form’ and entered in to REDCap.  
The following tasks  will be completed : 
Product evaluation  will be assessed after participants take 4 puffs of each assigned product with 15 -
minute inter -product int erval (Randomization and Visits 02, 0 4, 08, and 12 ). Following each sampling 
period, participants will complete the Cigarette Evaluation Scale  (CES; modified to apply to both 
cigarettes and vaping devices), which assesses the extent to which the product th ey just sampled 
was produced various subjective effects including satisfaction, good taste, dizziness, reduced 
appetite, nausea, and enjoyable sensations in the throat and chest on a 7 point Likert -type scale . 
We will also assess changes in heart rate and blood pressure related to each product. The product 
evaluation will be omitted if the participant indicates they are currently abstaining from use of the 
product (Question 3 of the Intention to Quit Log).  
Puff topography  entails having participants puff through a device that more precisely measures 
puffing behavior (e.g., puff volume). At Visits 01 and 10 , participants will puff both their assigned 
cigarette and vaping device through the topography device.  Puff topography will be omitted if the 
participant indicates they are currently abstaining from use of the product (Question 3 of the Intention 
to Quit Log).  
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 28 of 66 confidential  Researchers will complete the End of Visit Evaluation Form, which will be entered into REDCap , after 
each visit during the experimental phase .  This will allow the researcher to make note of any problems 
encountered during the visit  and to assess the truthfulness of the participant in regard to self -report of 
tobacco use.  
6.5. Product and Procedures Compliance Review Sessions  
Participants will be counseled at each visit to the lab  about th eir use of the study products. They will 
be asked about any concerns or obstacles associated with using the study cigarettes and vaping 
device.  The importance of honest self -reporting will be stressed. If difficulties are encountered, 
participants will be asked why they think they are experiencing difficulties (e.g., taste, withdrawal 
symptoms) and to problem -solve how to deal with these difficulties to meet the protocol 
requirements.   
Additionally, participants will be co unseled about IVR completion, visit attendance, task engagement 
and product accountability.   
Preparation for Visit 12  
At the end of Visit 10, participants will be reminded that the study will conclude at Visit 12 (except 
for the 30 -day follow up visit). F urther, at Visit 12 they will be expected to turn in all study tobacco 
products. Participants can make or schedule a quit attempt at any time throughout the study (see 
related procedure in Section 1 5: Quit Attempts) , including at this time. The two -week pe riod between 
Visit 10 and Visit 12 will allow participants to prepare accordingly for the end of the study or a quit 
attempt.  
After a participant has completed all study procedures, they are required to turn in all study 
cigarettes, vaping devices, tanks  and e-liquids.  
The research assistant will read the following script to all participants  at the Week 12 visit:  
“Nicotine in cigarettes is very addictive and robs people the choice of being able to quit smoking or 
not. In addition to being in cigarettes, n icotine is in smokeless tobacco products, snus, nicotine 
patches, nicotine lozenges, nicotine gum, and most e -liquid for vaping devices. Among these 
products, cigarettes contain the most toxins and cancer -causing chemicals because they are 
burned and this smoke is associated with the greatest risk for disease and death.  As many as half 
of the people who smoke cigarettes will die from smoking -related disease. The number of harmful 
chemicals in vaping products may be less because they are not burned. Are you  interested in 
additional resources about vaping risks? ( provide list of online resources)  
There is a 50% chance that the study cigarettes provided to you during the study were very low in 
nicotine content.  In prior studies, smokers assigned to very low n icotine cigarettes smoked less 
and made more quit -attempts than smokers of cigarettes with normal nicotine levels. Before you 
go, we want to encourage you to abstain (continue abstaining) from smoking. We can provide you 
with some resources that may help y ou quit. Would you like a copy of those resources? (provide 
“Clearing the Air,” state Quitline number, smokefree.gov) . Are you interested in quitting now or in 
the near future?  (If yes) Do you want to take five minutes to make a personalized quit plan that  we 
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 29 of 66 confidential  can print off for you? (provide smokefree.gov/build -your-quit-plan-results) . We also encourage you 
to consult with your physician and use any medications he/she deems appropriate. ” 
7. 30 Day Follow -Up Visit  
Participants will return to the lab between 25 a nd 35 days after Visit 12 to assess their smoking 
patterns. The purpose of this visit is to discuss tobacco product use since the study ended and obtain 
physiological measures. Additionally, any Adverse  Event Forms that remain open from the last 
session wi ll be discussed.  If the participant became pregnant during the study, this would have been 
recorded as a n adverse  event.  During this visit, the research assistant will confirm her due date.  
This event will remain open until delivery.  At that time, the licensed medical monitor will contact the 
participant to ask a few questions about the baby’s health and will update the Adverse  Event Form.  
Physiological measures collected  and recorded on paper, and entered into REDCap at the 
end of the visit:

Minnesota.   
2. First void urine sample  for smoking biomarker asses sment. Participants will be asked to bring 
a sample (first void urine of the day) for biomarker assessment. Samples will be stored at 
temperatures approximately at -20°C (UPenn) or -80°C (Wake Forest) . Urine samples will be 
send quarterly to be analyzed an d stored at the University of Minnesota. Total nicotine 
equivalents and mercapturic acids will be assessed. If a participant forgets to bring his/her 
urine sample, then the spot urine sample will be used.  
3. Total nicotine equivalents at the 30 -day follow -up will be compared to baseline samples. A t 
the discretion of the PI, a  letter will be sent to participants who demonstrate a 100% increase 
relative to baseline to alert them of their nicotine exposure, advise them to try to reduce their 
nicotine/tobacco use  and provide cessation resources.

the PI will review the participant’s binder and sign a form indicating study completion for that 
participant.  
Researchers will complete the End of Visit Evaluation Form, which will be entered into REDCap . This 
will allow the researcher to make note of any problems encountered during the visit  and to assess the 
truthfulness of the participant in regard to self -report of tobacco use.  
8. Procedures for Early Termination Visits and Withdraw al 
8.1. Withdrawal Procedures  
If the decision to withdraw a subject occurs at a study visit, regular clinic visit procedures will be 
conducted as well as the additional termination procedures as described in section 8.2. If it is 
determined via a phone call tha t withdrawal is appropriate or if the subject is dropping out, we will 
ask the subject  to attend an exit visit to return study product and equipment (e.g. cell phone if 
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 31 of 66 confidential  issued), complete questionnaires, product accountability and safety assessments and to receive 
their final study payment.  
If the subject refuses an exit visit, we will request that at the minimum, study investigational 
product s be returned and product accountability be completed. We will also stress the importance 
of being able to assess saf ety measures for the subject’s safety.  
8.2. Early Termination  
If a participant decides to withdraw from the study prior to completion or if they are withdrawn by 
the PI or LMM due to safety concerns, they will be scheduled for an early termination visit. If the  
participant is seen within the window of a regularly schedule d visit, all measures for that visit will 
be collected. Additional questionnaires and safety measures may be obtai ned (urine sample for  
biomarkers and pregnancy screen, CES -D, and BDI -II if appr opriate) if not scheduled during the 
normal visit.  If the subject is seen outside of a regularly scheduled visit window, the following 
measures will be obtained:

such as cough, phlegm production, shortness of breath on a scale ranging from 0 = none up to 
10 = severe with a total respiratory score determined by adding the scores of each of these 
items.  
23. Alcohol Use Questionnaire (1 and 12  month) assesses frequency and quantity of alcohol use.   
24. Drug Use History  (1 and 12 month) assesses amount, frequency in past year, and past month 
and date of last use of illicit drugs.  
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 34 of 66 confidential  25. Perceived Health Risks assesses perceived health risks of no tobacco use, usual brand of 
cigarettes and study products that are provided.   
26. Modified Cigarette Evaluation Scale and/or Product Evaluation Scale  assesses different 
dimensions of responses to cigarettes or other tobacco/nicotine products, (e.g., psychological 
rewa rd, satisfaction, aversiveness, and additional oral and respiratory sensation items).  
27. Cigarette/Product  Purchase Task assesses demand curves of products that are chosen .  This 
questionnaire  will be used to generate demand curves by asking the subject to r eport the number 
of units of a tobacco product that they would consume in a day if the units cost various amounts 
of money.  
28. Smoking and Vaping  Expectancy Questionnaire to assess attitudes and beliefs about the 
products provided.  
29. Stages of Change  assesses  the intention to quit smoking including next 30 days, 6 months and 
overall readiness to quit.  
30. Intention to Quit  assesses intention to quit smoking including next 30 days and 6 months and 
overall readiness to quit.   
31. Social and Environmental Influences on T obacco Use assesses tobacco/nicotine situational use 
and subject’s opinion on potential tobacco control policies.  
32. End of Study Questionnaire, an open -ended interview administered at follow -up which queries 
the subject’s rationale for product selection, kno wledge, attitudes and beliefs about these 
products, reactions to product(s) selected, reactions to a policy that reduces nicotine in 
cigarettes, ideas about how this policy should be conveyed to the public and what needs to be 
in place to reduce any negati ve effects.  
33. Qualitative Interview Guide  an open -ended interview administered at the 30 -day Follow -Up to 
gather qualitative data about product use patterns, e -liquid flavor selection, non -study product 
use, and general study feedback. (Wake Forest Site Onl y)   
10. Interactive Voice Response System  
Participants will be trained to use the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) System, which will contact 
participants each day throughout the study and ask about their smoking and vaping behavior. 
Participants will be pro vided a study cell phone if they have unreliable telephone access, do not 
have enough monthly cell phone minutes or prefer not to use their own phone. Each day during the 
period between the screening visit and the Week 12 Visit  the IVR system will ask part icipants to 
report their use of cigarettes, puffs of a vaping device, first tobacco product used, and minutes after 
waking until first tobacco product use. During each call, participants report about tobacco use during 
the previous calendar day (midnight t o midnight), not the previous 24 -hours.  
The IVR system is operated by MicroAutomation , a media production company.  To be enrolled in 
the IVR system, research staff will enter the participant’s  telephone number, subject identifier, and 
visit dates into the  IVR CENIC website.  Identifying information (telephone numbers) will be removed 
from the dataset by the biostatistics core. Please refer to MicroAutomation’s  privacy statement and 
HIPAA compliance form for additional information.  
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 35 of 66 confidential  11. Study Debriefing  
After da ta collection is complete, participants will receive a letter telling them which condition they 
were randomized into and the results of the study thus far.  
12. Biosample Storage  
The urine and saliva biosamples will be collected and stored at study sites until  regular shipment s 
to the University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center for analysis or long term storage . Samples 
that are not used for primary analysis of study biomarkers will be banked for future use  related to 
tobacco and nicotine exposure.  
13. Data Stor age 
Data will be stored locally at each site and at the University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center’s 
Bioinformatics Core for at least 7 years after study completion.  
14. Individually Identifiable Health Information  
No information will be collected from me dical records. Direct identifiers  will be retained at each site , 
stored separate from all other data,  and will only be available to the local study and regulatory staff.  
The only exception is subject telephone numbers provided to a HIPAA compliant vendor for our 
Interactive Voice Recording System. Other identifiable information (excluding direct identifiers) such 
as visit dates will be collected and accessible to study staff (i.e., a limited dataset).  These variables 
will be removed from the final de -identified dataset by staff associated with CENIC at the University 
of Minnesota Biostatistics Core.   
Data Collection Platforms  
Data will be collected and entered into multiple platforms including the REDCap and the Interactive 
Voice Recording System (IVR). I n the event that internet access is not functioning, the assessments 
will be printed out and administered on paper. The source documents will be kept in the participant’s 
case report form binder and the interviewer will enter the data into the software whe n it resumes 
functioning properly. Biosamples will be entered into a biomarker tracking database as they are 
collected.  
15. Participant Compensation/Incentives  
Subjects will rec eive $3 0 for the Screening Visit, $20 for the Baseline and 30 -day Follow -up Visits , 
$20 for completing each shorter visit (Week 01, 02, 03, 06, 10) and $40 for completing each longer 
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 36 of 66 confidential  visit (04, 08, 12) , and $60 for completing the Randomization Visit. All subjects will also receive $10 
to cover transportation costs for each visit , includi ng the informational session ($13 0).  
In addition to compensating subjects for their time and travel, there are  incentives in place to 
encourage retention, and compliance.  
Completed IVR Calls  
Participants will receive $1 for each completed IVR call. An add itional bonus of $5 will be awarded 
for missing no calls between scheduled visits.  
Retention  
Those who miss no more than two visits between Visit 01 and Visit 08, and who attend both Visit 10 
and 12, will receive a $100 completion bonus.  
Compliance  
Since w e have previously observed  high rates of non -compliance among those assigned to VLNC  
cigarette s, we think it is important to incentivize only using assigned study products. Subjects will be 
told that one of their spot urine samples collected between Visit 01 and Visit 12 will be randomly 
selected and analyzed, and if it indicates they were compliant, they will receive a $300 bonus. A 
missed visit will count as a non -compliant urine sample. In actuality the bonus will only be contingent 
on urine samples from  Visit 12, but it is important for subjects to believe samples are analyz ed 
throughout the study to encourage compliance. Since compliance cannot be assessed in participants 
using NNCs, all participants in those groups will receive the $300 compliance ince ntive unless they 
miss Visit 12. For those using VLNC  cigarette s, the incentive will be contingent on a urinary 
anatabine cut -off that indicates compliance with study products. Anatabine measures will be deemed 
compliant at levels slightly higher (0.16 nmo l/ml) than what would be expected for complete 
compliance (0. 010 nmol/ml)  to allow for variation in individual metabolism and will not penaliz e 
occasional non -study prod uct use.

At each session, we will ask the participant if he/she is currently abstaining from smoking and/or 
vaping with the intention of quitting.  I f the answer is no, then we will also ask if he/she is planning 
to quit smoking and/or vaping prior to his/her next scheduled visit.  
16.1.  If a participant is currently abstaining from smoking and/or vaping with the  
intention to quit we: 
 Encourage participant to  continue abstaining.  
 Schedule the participant for normal weekly visits, but do not conduct  puff topography ,

to the full amount (baseline CPD), that they would like to take, rather than require him/her 
to take the full amount .   
o If the participant choses to take home the study produc t we have him/her sign a form 
acknowledging that tobacco product availability could be detrimental to the quit 
attempt. We also r ecommend that he/she puts the product “away” at home as to 
avoid unwanted cues to smoke.  
 If the participant chooses not to take  home the study product, we have him/her contact the 
lab if he/she lapses and would like to pick up the study product prior to his/her next visit.  
16.2.  If a participant is planning to quit smoking or vaping, but has not initiated 
the quit attempt  we 
 Ask if he/s he has identified a target quit date and, if so, what that target date is  
 Provide the participant with the ‘ Clearing the Air ’ manual and smoking cessation resources  
 Provide the participant with he/she’s preferred amount of study product , up to the full amo unt 
(baseline CPD) , that they would like to take.  We also r ecommend that on the target date 
he/she puts the product “away” at home as to avoid unwanted cues to smoke . 
 If the participant choses to take home any amount of the study product , we have him/her 
sign a form acknowledging that tobacco product availability could be detrimental to the quit 
attempt.  
17. Potential risks of participation  
1. Survey Questionnaires : The interview will include questions about medical history, drug and 
alcohol use, and questionnair es about mood.  Answering these personal questions could 
make the participant feel uncomfortable.  
2. Breach of Confidentiality : The risk of the interview is loss of privacy if other people find out 
the results.  
3. Smoking Cigarettes : All cigarettes are detriment al to a person’s health and can lead to severe 
or fatal medical problems including:  
a. Cardiovascular Diseases: Coronary heart disease, heart attack, stroke, peripheral 
vascular disease, reduced blood circulation, abdominal aortic aneurysm  
b. Respiratory Disease s: Emphysema, bronchitis, tuberculosis and chronic airway 
obstruction  
c. Cancers: Lung, bladder, liver, colon, cervical, esophageal, kidney, larynx, mouth, 
pancreatic, throat, stomach cancers and acute myeloid leukemia   
d. Diabetes  
e. Abnormal immune function, rhe umatoid arthritis  
f. Other Health Risks Associated with Smoking: Including but not limited to infertility,  
tubal  pregnancy, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) , birth defects, lower bone 
density in postmenopausal women, hip fracture in women, male sexual dys function; 
age-related macular degeneration, vision problems.

h. Death  
4. Smoking study cigarettes : In addition to the above medical problems, participants may 
experience some minor adverse health effects such as headac hes or experience withdraw al 
symptoms which are listed below.  Due to the altered nicotine levels, there could be a change 
in their cigarette use including the way they inhale the smoke or an increase  in the number 
of cigarettes smoked per day. This increa sed rate of smoking may persist after completing 
the study. Smoking the study cigarettes does not provide any less risk than their usual brand 
cigarette and could pose increased health risks.  Participants may also experience increases 
in levels of carbon monoxide, a gas from smoke.  The study cigarettes are made from 
genetically modified tobacco plants.  A recent toxicological analysis of these cigarettes 
showed that the concentrations of many harmful tobacco constituents, including tobacco -
specific nitros amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, ammonia, and toxic metals, was 
similar to the concentrations of these constituents in commercial cigarettes (Richter et al., 
2016) . 
5. Vaping Devices: Vaping devices can expose users to several chemicals, including nicotine, 
carbonyl compounds, and volatile organic compounds, known to have adverse health effects. 
The health effects and potentially harmful doses of heated and aerosolized constituents of 
vaping devices , including solvents, flavorants, and toxicants, are not completely understood. 
Vaping device  aerosol is not harmless a lthough it generally contains fewer toxicants than 
combustible tobacco products. Specifi c potential known risks include : 
a. E-liquids may contain nicotine  contain nicotine which may contribute to some of the 
disease associated with smoking . 
b. The most common si de effects related to vaping device use are changes in taste, 
mucus in throat/sinus, dry mouth, dry cough, throat irritation, sore throat, mouth 
ulcers, dizziness, headache, seizures, and nausea.  Subjects are told to stop use of 
e-cigarette (or other nicot ine products) and promptly notify study staff if they have 
loss of consciousness, memory lapse, change in mental status, confusion, tremor, 
shaking, or seizure.  
c. While  uncommon, batteries from vaping devices have exploded /ignited  and injured 
users.  
d. Vaping devices can overheat and present a burn risk if the device is turned on 
repeatedly. Subjects are told to be careful if storing the device in a place where the 
button might be accidentally pressed often.  
e. Defective cartridges, tanks or devices may leak e -liquid. If this should happen, w ash 
the exposed area to remove the e -liquid immediately.  
f. Ingestion of e-liquids containing nicotine can cause acute toxicity and possible death 
if the contents of refill cartridges containing nicotine are consumed. Subjects ar e told 
to keep vaping devices  and all e -liquid cartomizers away from pets and children. 
Instructions are provided to call the Poison Control Center (1 -800-222-1222) 
immediately and contact study staff  if e-liquids are ingested .  For skin exposure  w e 
recomm end washing  well with soap and water for 10 -15 minutes.  
g. Allergic  reactions to propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin have been reported. 
Chemicals used to flavor foods are also a risk for allergic reactions. We will ask 
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 40 of 66 confidential  subjects if they have had previous adverse reactions to vaping and/or allergic 
reactions to food and provide that information to the medical monitor  to review as 
part of determining eligibility.   
h. Recent reports of seizure and severe lung problems associated with vaping are 
being evaluated by the CDC and the FDA. While current evidence is not conclusive 
of causality, it is prudent to inform potential subjects of this on -going investigation 
and be alerted to the symptoms of lung disease. These symptoms include: cough, 
shortness of breath, che st pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fever. One 
should promptly seek medical attention for any health concerns. Subjects will also 
be advised to use only the study product we have provided to them and to not alter 
the device or add any substances  to e-liquids. We will keep participants informed as 
the additional information is provided by the CDC and FDA.  
6. Continued use of vap ing devices : As part of this study, participants  will try a vaping device 
on multiple occasions and can use a vaping device as much as they like, outside of the lab, 
over a 12-week period. This product may contain nicotine, an addictive chemical. It is 
possible that this experience could lead to long -term use of vaping devices after the trial is 
over.  
7. Nicotine  Withdrawal : Parti cipants may experience smoking withdrawal symptoms during this 
study.  The symptoms can be uncomfortable but are typically of minimal risk. Smoking 
withdrawal symptoms include : 
a. Anger, irritability, frustration  
b. Anxiousness, nervousness  
c. Depressed mood or sad ness  
d. Desire or craving to smoke  
e. Difficulty concentrating  
f. Increased appetite, hunger or weight gain  
g. Insomnia, problems sleeping or awakening at night  
h. Restlessness  
i. Impatience  
j. Constipation  
k. Dizziness  
l. Coughing  
m. Dreaming or nightmares  
n. Nausea  
o. Sore Throat  
8. Returnin g to Regular Smoking : It is possible that if participants return to smoking their usual 
brand of cigarette at the end of the study they may experience mild and transient nausea, 
dizziness, and lightheadedness.  
9. Risk to Fetus : Smoking during pregnancy can le ad to miscarriage, preterm delivery, stillbirth, 
low birth weight, problems with the placenta, birth defects such as cleft palate, sudden infant 
death syndrome (SIDS), early childhood behavioral problems, altered lung development, and 
a possible propensity  for addiction. Although unknown, adverse effects could occur with the 
use of vaping devices . 
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 41 of 66 confidential  10. Changes in blood pressure and/or heart rate : Smoking and nicotine can affect the 
cardiovascular system which may result in changes in blood pressure and/or heart rate. 
11. Changes in mood, emotions and psychiatric symptoms : Smoking and nicotine can affect a 
person’s mood and emotions and are associated with psychiatric disorders including major 
depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder and eating disorders.   Any 
changes in nicotine use or cigarette consumption could adversely affect mood, emotions and 
the symptoms related to psychiatric conditions in some individuals.  
12. Smoking and oral contraceptives in women : Women who smoke and are over the age of  35 
should not take oral contraceptives that contain estrogen without consulting their physician. 
Smoking while using oral contraceptives can increase the risk of having a cardiovascular 
event such as a heart attack or stroke. Additionally, there is a pote ntial risk of thrombosis 
associated with hormonal therapy (including contraceptives) and smoking.  
13. Smoking and medications : Quitting smoking can greatly benefit participants’ health. 
However, changes in smoking can lead to changes in how well some medicati ons work. 
Participants should disclose all medications they are taking. We also recommend that 
participants discuss any planned or actual changes in how much they smoke with their 
doctor, especially if they are taking any medications for psychiatric, cardi ovascular, or other 
serious diseases.  
14. Unforeseen risks : There may be additional unforeseen short and long -term risks of 
participation.   
18. Avoiding Risks to Fetus  
If participants choose to be sexually active, they are advised to use an appropriate “double ba rrier” 
method of birth control (such as female use of a diaphragm, intrauterine device (IUD), or 
contraceptive sponge, in addition to male use of a condom) or the female should be using prescribed 
“birth control” pills, injections, or implants.  F emale par ticipants with child -bearing potential will be 
tested for pregnancy at Screening, Randomization, and Visits 04, 08 and 12.  If a participant 
becomes pregnant during the study, she will be withdrawn from the study.  Approximately 30 days 
after being withdra wn or having a positive pregnancy test at Visit 12, the research staff will call the 
participant to confirm her due date.  The licensed medical monitor will follow -up with the participant 
after delivery to ask questions about the baby’s health.  
19. Expected be nefits of participation  
There are no immediate benefits from participating in the study. The information obtained from this 
study may ultimately help the Food and Drug Administration decide how best to regulate tobacco 
products with the goal of improving p ublic health.  
20. Suicidality/Mental Health Monitoring  
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 42 of 66 confidential  Participants who make any response other than “not at all” on the suicidal ideation question of the 
Prime MD (Question 1i), indicate suicidal ideation, have attempted suicide in the past month, or have 
had a suicide attempted in the past 5 years on the MINI suicide subscale will not be eligible to 
participate in the study. If the participant has attempted suicide between 6 -10 years ago, then the 
LMM must approve eligibility. To determine if a participant i s in immediate danger, staff will ask the 
participant two questions to determine level of risk: “Are you feeling suicidal?” and “Do you have a 
plan to kill yourself today?” If the participant has a plan to kill himself/herself, staff will put the 
participa nt in contact with the suicide prevention hotline (Durham Center Crisis Line at 1 -800-510-
9132; Philadelphia Suicide Prevention Hotline: 215 -686-4420 or UPenn’s HELP line: 215 -898-H ELP 
4357). If the participant refuses to talk to the hotline and leaves, th e study staff will call 911. They 
will also contact the Study Coordinator and Site PI to inform them of the situation as soon as 
possible. If the participant does not have a plan to kill himself/herself, the study staff will recommend 
he/she speaks with th e suicide hotline. The visit will continue as normal, but the participant will not 
be eligible for the study.  The participant will be paid $ 30 and provided with local mental health 
resources. The on -site clinician will be available by phone for consultati on within 24 -hours.  
Additionally, any participant whose score on the Prime MD indicates Major Depressive Disorder will 
be administered the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the GAD 2 week monitoring on paper. 
The BDI will be submitted, along with the Pri me MD, Brief Medical History Questionnaire, Brief 
Medical History Follow -up Questionnaire, and the MINI suicide subscale to the licensed medical 
monitor for eligibility review. If he/she determines a participant with Major Depressive Disorder is 
eligible f or study participation, the participant will complete the BDI each visit  to monitor changes in 
his/her mood.  
21. Adverse Events  (AE) 
21.1.  Identifying Adverse Events  
While participating in the trial, adverse events and concomitant medications will be assessed at 
every study visit and vital signs and carbon monoxide will be measured .  Adverse  events will typically 
be identified during the administration of the Health Changes Questionnaire and Respiratory Health 
Questionnaire, and in some cases during the administratio n of the CESD.  Other events may be 
identified from physiological study measures or by spontaneous reports during non -scheduled 
assessments. The medical monitor is notified about all AEs within 10 days.  
Questionnaire items that will be reviewed:  
1. Health Cha nges Questionnaire   
1. Have you had any negative changes in your physical or mental health since your 
last visit? If yes, briefly describe.  
2. Since your last visit, have you received any form of medical care?  If yes, briefly 
describe.  
No new AE report will be required if one or more conditions below are met and the description 
does not otherwise meet the definition of an AE.  
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 43 of 66 confidential  a. Existing AE already open for reported symptom  
b. Pre-existing condition without increase in severity or frequency of symptoms (brief 
medical history will be updated if not previously reported).  
c. Nicotine withdrawal symptoms that don’t meet AE criteria  
A. The following withdrawal symptoms are considered expected 
withdrawal symptoms and are not considered AEs  
1. Desire or craving to smoke  
2. Restlessness  
3. Impatience  
4. Increased appetite, hunger, weight gain*  
*If a participant indicates any clinical behaviors such as binging or 
purging this should be recorded as a n Adverse  Event and the 
PrimeMD should be completed.  
B. The following withdrawal symptoms would be con sidered an AE if 
the participant indicated the symptom had a significant impact on your 
daily life, caused a major disruption of functioning, or took any medication 
for it.  
1. Anger, irritability, frustration  
2. Difficulty Concentrating  
3. Insomnia  
4. Nightmare/Night Terrors  
5. Depressed (sad) mood*  
6. Anxious (nervous) mood*  
*If a depressed (sad) mood and an anxious (nervous) mood AE is 
reported, the participant will complete the Prime MD and be assessed 
for suicidality.  
d. Received preventative or follow -up medical care.  
e. Other (explain).  
 
2. Respiratory Health Questionnaire : In the past week, have you experienced any health 
problems, such as cold, flu, or other respiratory illness that would affect these 
respiratory symptoms?  
No new AE report will be required if one or more cond itions below are met and the description 
does not otherwise meet the definition of an AE.  
a. Existing AE already open for reported symptom  
b. Pre-existing condition without increase in severity or frequency of symptoms (brief 
medical history will be updated if n ot previously reported; e.g., seasonal allergies).  
 
3. CESD : If the participant scores 16 or higher and is not already being monitored for 
depression , a ‘Adverse  Event Form’ should be completed and the LM M will provide 
information regarding follow -up.  If the re is already an open event, information will be added 
to the existing ‘ Adverse  Event Form.’  
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 44 of 66 confidential   
Physiological data that will be reviewed:  
1. CO level : The ‘ Adverse  Event Form’ should be completed if the average CO within a visit is:  
o CO is greater than 50 ppm i f CO at Baseline is < 20 ppm.  
o CO is greater than 60 ppm if CO at Baseline is 20 – 34 ppm.  
o CO is greater than 70 ppm if CO at Baseline is 35 – 49 ppm.  
o CO is greater than 80 ppm if CO at Baseline is 50 – 64 ppm.  
o CO is greater than 90 ppm if CO at Baseline is  65 – 80 ppm.  
2. Blood Pressure :  
o The ‘ Adverse  Event Form’ and ‘Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Symptom Checklist’ 
should be completed if  an automatic and subsequent manual blood pressure 
measurement during the same visit is at or above 160  SBP or 100 DBP. 
o The ‘Adverse  Event Form’ and ‘Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Symptom Checklist’ 
should be completed if  an automatic and subsequent manual blood pressure 
measurement during the same visit is below 90  SBP or 50 DBP. 
3. Heart Rate :  
o The ‘ Adverse  Event Form’ and ‘Blo od Pressure and Heart Rate Symptom Checklist’ 
should be completed if  an automatic and subsequent manual heart rate 
measurement during the same visit is at or above 105 bpm.  
o The ‘ Adverse  Event Form’ and ‘Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Symptom Checklist’ 
shou ld be completed if  an automatic and subsequent manual heart rate 
measurement during the same visit is  below 45 bpm .  
22. Management of SAEs and Other Study Risks  
The site medical monitor (s) will review all AEs.  A study participant may be discontinued from 
the study if the medical monitor and/or PI determine it is the best decision in order to protect the 
safety of a participant.  In the event that a participant either withdraws from the study or the 
investigator decides to discontinue a participant due to an A E/SAE, the participant will have 
appropriate follow -up medical monitoring.  The participant experiencing an AE/SAE will be 
followed until the problem resolves, stabilizes, or is clearly unrelated to the study cigarettes.  Any 
AE that remains open will be r eviewed and closed at the 30 day follow -up visit.   
23. Reporting of SAEs to the IRB, FDA, and NIDA  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) as defined in 21 CFR 312.32 (death, life -threatening, 
hospitalization (initial or prolonged), disability or permanent damage, cong enital anomaly/birth 
defect, required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage (devices), other 
serious (important medical outcomes)) that are related or possibly related to study participation 
will be reported to the Administrative Core, all  site IRBs, the NIDA Scientific Officer ( Kevin 
Walton, PhD ), the NIDA Project Officer ( Ann Anderson,  MD), FDA, and the Data Safety and 
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 45 of 66 confidential  Monitoring Board.  All Site IRBs require that fatalities related to the study be reported within 24 
hours, that all other  SAEs be reported within 5 business days.  Reports of all SAEs will also be 
documented within NIDA’s SAE data monitoring syste m, or SAETRS, within 72 hours.  
24. Reporting of IRB Actions to NIDA  
Actions taken by the local IRBs in response to SAEs will be repor ted to NIDA in the annual 
noncompetitive continuation application, as will reports of changes or amendments to the 
protocol as a result of an SAE.  Recommendation for trial discontinuation, for significant changes 
or amendments to the protocol, or other si gnificant findings as a result of an SAE will be reported 
immediately to the NIDA Scientific Officer ( Kevin Walton, PhD ) and Project Officer ( Ann 
Anderson, MD ) by the Project PI.  
25. Reporting Changes or Amendments to the Protocol  
Any changes or amendments to  the protocol made in response to adverse events/SAEs will be 
discussed with Eric Donny, PhD and Dorothy Hatsukami, PhD, and then requested in writing to 
the IRB, which will then grant or deny permission to make the requested change in protocol.  The 
DSMB and FDA will be notified about any significant changes to the protocol.  NIDA will be 
informed of any approved changes in protocol by documentation in the noncompetitive 
continuation application.  Changes that significantly alter the scope of the research or the ability 
of the research to achieve its specific aims will be submitted to Eric Donny, PhD and Dorothy 
Hatsukami, PhD, the DSMB, FDA, and NIDA for approval prior to implementation.  
26. Withdrawal or Monitoring of Participants  
For the participant’s prote ction, participants will be withdrawn immediately from the study 
if any of the following occur:  
 
1. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) event : Typically include s MI (heart attack), PTCA 
(angioplasty/stenting), bypass surgery, stroke, peripheral vascular disease (art erial 
blockages in arms or legs leading to procedure or surgery).  Less common CVD problems 
would be new cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., new atrial fibrillation) or new valvular disease (e.g., 
mitral or aortic regurgitation).  
2. DVT/PE  (deep vein thrombosis/pulmon ary embolism, i.e., blood clots in the venous system).  
3. Suicide Attempt :  A participant will be withdrawn if he/she attempts suicide at any time during 
participation in the study.  
4. Psychiatric Hospitalization : A participant will be withdrawn if he/she is hos pitalized for 
psychiatric reasons at any time during participation in the study.  
5. Pregnancy : If participant indicates she is pregnant or has a positive pregnancy test at the 
Randomization Visit, she will be withdrawn from the study, and this event will rema in open 
until delivery.  At that time the licensed medical monitor will contact the participant to ask a 
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 46 of 66 confidential  few questions about the baby’s health and will update the open ‘ Adverse  Event Form’.  A 
positive pregnancy test at follow -up will trigger a n ‘Adverse  Event Form’ to be completed but 
will not result in withdrawal since she is no longer receiving study product.  
6. Expired breath carbon monoxide increase : A participant will be withdrawn from the study if 
their CO reading is 100 ppm or greater.    
 
The following  will be monitored and can lead to the participant being withdrawn by the PI 
or Licensed Medical Monitor:  
 
1. Blood pressure (BP) or heart rate (HR) changes : If any of the following occur post -enrollment: 
1) BP is at or above 160  SBP or 100 DBP, 2) BP is belo w 90 SBP or 50 DBP 3) HR is at or 
above 105 bpm, 4) or below 45 bpm.   
2. Changes in tobacco product use : if during the weekly visits, participants self -report a greater 
than 100% increase in cigarette per day (total cigarettes, including study and non -study 
cigarettes) relative to baseline, or a 50% increase in cigarettes per day relative to baseline 
that is accompanied by an average daily use of 2 ml e -liquid or more.”  
3. Expired breath Carbon Monoxide increase : An ‘Adverse  Event Form’ will be documented  and 
the participant will be monitored by the medical monitor if CO exceeding the following criteria 
based on Baseline CO : 
a. CO is greater than 50 ppm if CO at Baseline is < 20 ppm.  
b. CO is greater than 60 ppm if CO at Baseline is 20 – 34 ppm.  
c. CO is greater than 70 p pm if CO at Baseline is 35 – 49 ppm.  
d. CO is greater than 80 ppm if CO at Baseline is 50 – 64 ppm.  
e. CO is greater than 90 ppm if CO at Baseline is 65 – 80 ppm.  
4. Medication changes : If a participant begins taking any of the exclusionary medications or 
other me dications that could potentially have a smoking -drug interaction post - enrollment, 
the licensed medical monitor will determine how best to monitor and minimize potential risks 
(including withdrawal if warranted).  We will also recommend that a letter be se nt to the 
participant’s physician (with their consent), making them aware of the potential changes in 
smoking that could occur as a result of participation in the study.    
5. Any hospitalization or debilitation in which participation in the study could be det rimental to 
the recovery process.  This will be self -reported by the participant and will be reviewed by 
the site PI and medical monitor to determine whether continued participation in the study is 
appropriate.   
6. If a participant is behaving in an inapprop riate or threatening manner, admits to lying about 
eligibility criteria, including omitting previous medical diagnoses and medications, is 
participating in other smoking research studies that could affect the primary outcome 
measures, does not follow study  instructions, etc., then the PI can withdraw him/her from the 
study at the PI’s discretion.  
7. If a participant fails to attend his/her Randomization Visit within the 21-day allowable visit 
window, he/she will not be eligible to reschedule this visit or con tinue participation in the 
study.  
8. If there is reason to believe the participant is sharing the study product with other people.  
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 47 of 66 confidential  If a participant chooses to withdraw from the study at any time, we will them to return to the lab 
to return study product and e quipment and to receive their final study payment. We will also ask 
participants who have been randomized if they would like to complete the end of study 
questionnaires.  
27. Investigational Tobacco Product  
The Co -Directors of this Center grant, Drs. Donny and Hatsukami, have submitted an 
Investigational Tobacco Product (ITP) application to the FDA to cover the experimental cigarettes 
being used in this study.  
28. Study Endpoints / Outcome s   
28.1.  Primary Endpoints : 
 Total number of cigarettes smoked per day (i.e. study plus non -study cigarettes) as 
measured by daily Interactive Voice Response (IVR) phone calls.  The total number 
of cigarettes smoked per day will be averaged using the last 7 days prior to the Week 
12 visit. We note that subjects have the opportunity to co rrect data entry errors in IVR 
from calls made since the last visit at each visit (for example, if a subject entered 100 
cigarettes instead of 10 cigarettes). In these cases, the original IVR data will be 
replaced with the corrected data to create a final,  cleaned version that will be used 
for analysis (herein called “IVR -Revised”).  A secondary, repeated measures analysis 
will also be completed using the mean of the total number of cigarettes smoked per 
day at each visit, calculated using IVR calls from the  previous 7 days. In the event 
that two visits were less than 7 days apart, then the average will be calculated using 
only days since the last visit.   
28.2.  Secondary Outcome s: 
 Cigarette  smoke exposure: mercapturic acid CEMA  
 Smoke -free days:  the number of days n ot smoking any combustible products based 
on IVR -Revised

 Increased nicotine exposure as indicated by 100% increase in total nicotine 
equivalents relative t o baseline  or a 50% increase in cigarettes per day relative to 
baseline that is accompanied by an average daily use of 2ml e -liquid or more.  
 Adverse events  
29. Statistical Approach  
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 49 of 66 confidential  This is a 2x2x2 factorial design in which participants will be randomized with equal probability to 
one of eight groups. Randomization will be stratified by age (18 -24 vs. 25+) and menthol 
preference; a set number/percentage of either age and menthol vs. non -menthol preferring 
smokers will not be enforced. All analyses described belo w will follow the intent -to-treat principle 
(i.e. subjects will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment assignment regardless of 
their compliance) unless otherwise noted.  
Our primary objective is to test the main effects of cigarette nicotine content, e -liquid nicotine 
content and e -liquid flavors, as well as the interactions among these factors. The primary 
endpoint  will be total CPD (i.e. study plus non -study CPD)  based on IVR -Revised . The primary 
analysis will compare CPD by factor at the we ek 12  visit using linear regression. Treatment 
groups should be balanced at baseline, and as a result our  primary analysis will only adjust for 
baseline CPD , week  and the three  stratification factors (site, age, and menthol preference). This 
will be consid ered the “unadjusted model” for the purposes of this document. We will start with a 
model that includes all two -way interactions between the three factors (note: the three way 
interaction will not be considered). Two -way interactions  that are not significa nt will be removed 
from the model and the final model will include the three factors, any two -way interactions 
significant at the 0. 05 levels, baseline CPD, and the three stratification factors. The estimation 
and testing of main effects in the presence of  significant interactions will be completed within 
levels of the other factor, otherwise, global estimates  of the main effects will be obtained.  
Whenever possible, s econdary endpoints will be analyzed following the approach to testing the 
main effects and interactions described above. Biomarkers of toxicant exposure are expected to 
be skewed and will be analyzed on the log scale. Likewise, e xploratory endpoints will be 
analyzed following the approach outlined above using a linear mixed model  or logistic reg ression, 
as appropriate, depending on the type of endpoint (continuous, binary). Finally, we will complete 
subgroup analyses following the approach described above within each subgroup (age: 18 – 24 
vs. 25+; menthol preference ; sex). We will not use formal  multiple comparison adjustments  for 
secondary endpoints because we have included only 2 outcomes that are likely correlated with 
each other and the primary endpoint. Likewise, we will not correct for multiple comparisons  for 
our subgroup analyses as they are considered exploratory.      
Study staff will make every effort to minimize missing data in the proposed clinical trial. The 
success of our previous and ongoing trials suggests that missing data will be minimal. 
Nevertheless, we plan to complete a sens itivity analysis to evaluate the impact of missing data 
on trial conclusions.   
We will compare subjects with and without missing data in order to identify baseline covariates 
associated with missing data. Our primary approach to handling missing data will  be multiple 
imputation where missing values are imputed using regression models developed from baseline 
covariates (Little and Rubin, 2002). Daily IVR data will be averaged within a week using complete 
observations (i.e. we will average the number of ciga rettes smoked per day for complete calls). 
In our previous work (Donny et al., 2015), 90% of weeks had 0 or 1 missed call, while 4% of 
weeks were completely missing, which suggests that an alternate approach to handling 
sporadically missed calls will only impact a small number of weeks for the entire trial. Missing 
CENIC II Project 2    
    
17OCTOBER2019  Page 50 of 66 confidential  weekly average IVR data (i.e. when all calls in a week are missing) will be analyzed using multiple 
imputation.  
In addition, we will conduct a sensitivity analysis of the primary and secondary en dpoints using 
baseline -carried -forward and last -observation carried forward. The results of these analyses will 
be compared to the primary analysis to evaluate the robustness of our conclusions.  
For the qualitative data, we will use grounded theory to deve lop hypotheses related to the topics 
of interest. Interviews will be audio -recorded and transcribed verbatim. The interviews will be 
analyzed using open and axial coding. Themes will emerge during data analysis, which will be 
ongoing throughout the project .   
30. Power Analysis  
We will enroll 480 subjects (n=60/group) and assume 75% retention at week 12 (i.e. 360 completers) 
based on our current and previous trials. Power calculations are presented for testing the main 
effects and the interactions between ciga rette nicotine content and e -cigarette nicotine concentration 
or flavor. Effect size estimates were based on our previous studies of VLNC cigarettes and the 
assumption that the main effect of e -liquid nicotine content and the interaction between e -liquid 
nicotine content and cigarette nicotine content will be similar to the effect of cigarette nicotine 
content. This assumption is supported by the results of Donny and Jones, who found that the effect 
of transdermal nicotine on use of VLNC cigarettes was as l arge as the main effect for cigarette 
nicotine content (Donny & Jones, 2009) . The impact of flavors is largely unknown, therefore, w e 
assumed an effect size similar to e -liquid nicotine content (A in table below) a s well as one half as 
large (B in table below). All power calculations were completed assuming a type -I error rate of 0.05. 
Power calculations for the main effect were completed in PASS 13. Power for testing interactions 
was calculated by simulation and is  consistent with the well -known theoretical relationship betw een 
the power for testing main effects and the power for testing interactions.

A Effect size for flavor equal to effect size for nicotine . B Effect size for flavor equal to half the effect size 
for nicotine.  
C Power calculations for our pre -planned subgroup analyses are based on the assumption of 50% of 
participants in each subgroup defined by age, sex, and menthol status. We are not forcing balance for 
any of these factors and we therefore acknowledge that the actual power will be larger for subgroups 
with more than 50% of the sample and lower for subgroup s with less than 50% of the sample. 1 The 
hypothesized differences for CPD, FTND and log(CEMA) are based on the differences observed 
between the immediate reduction and control groups at 12 weeks in Hatsukami et al. (submitted)

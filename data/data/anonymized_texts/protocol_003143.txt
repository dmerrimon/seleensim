NCT#: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Background and Significance:  
The global burden of sepsis is substantial with an estimated 15 to 19 million cases per year; the vast 
majority of these cases occur in low income countries. [1] With more timely diagnosis and improvement 
in supportive care the 28 -day mortality from sepsis  in high income countries has declined to about 25%, 
however, the mortality from septic shock remains as high as 45%. [2,3] Moreover, the mortality from 
sepsis and septic shock in low income countries is reported to be as high as 60%.[4 -6] In addition to 
short term mortality, septic patients suffer from a numerous short - and long -term complications and are 
at an increased risk of death for up to five years following the acute event.[7] Over the last 3 decades 
over 100 phase II and phase III clinical trial h ave been performed testing various novel pharmacologic 
agents and therapeutic intervention in an attempt to improve the outcome of patients with sepsis and 
septic shock; all of these studies have failed to show an improvement in patient outcomes. [8] New 
therapeutic approaches to sepsis are desperately required; considering the global burden of sepsis these 
interventions should be effective, cheap, safe and readily available.  
A large body of experimental data has demonstrated that both corticosteroids and intravenous vitamin 
C reduce activation of nuclear factor ƘB (NF ƘB) attenuating the release of pro -inflammatory mediators, 
reduce the endothelial injury characteristic of sepsis thereby reducing endothelial permeability and 
improving macrocirculatory flow,  augment the release of endogenous catecholamines and enhance 
vasopressor responsiveness.[9 -16] In animal models these effects have resulted in reduced organ injury 
and increased survival. Corticosteroids have been evaluated in several clinical trials, wit h meta -analysis 
of these trials demonstrating somewhat conflicting outcomes. [17 -20] Low -dose stress corticosteroids 
have proven to be safe with no increased risk of clinically important complications. [17] While 
corticosteroids decrease vasopressor depend ency the effect on survival is less clear.[19,21]  
Several studies have investigated the use of intravenous vitamin C in critically ill patients. Nathens et al 
randomized 595 surgical ICU patients (91% trauma patients) to receive intravenous vitamin C and 
vitamin E for up to 28 days. [22] The vitamin combination was associated with a significant reduction in 
the incidence of multiple system organ failure (p=0.04) with a trend to reduced mortality and length of 
ICU stay. No adverse effects were noted with th e vitamin combination. Fowler et al performed a pilot 
  
Page 2 of 15 
Version 5 – 13 May 2019  study in 24 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. [23] In this study patients were randomized to 
placebo (n=8), low dose intravenous vitamin C (50 mg/kg) (n=8) or high dose vitamin C (200mg/kg).  
Vitamin C attenuated the inflammatory response with both doses of the vitamin being devoid of any 
side effects. Although the Sequential Sepsis Related Organ Failure Score (SOFA) fell significantly in both 
treatment arms the study was underpowered to deter mine any outcome benefit. Zabet and colleagues 
performed a RCT in which they evaluated the role of intravenous vitamin C in a dose of 100 mg/kg/day 
(about 7g/day) in 28 surgical ICU patients with septic shock. [24] In this study the mean dose of 
norepineph rine and duration of norepinephrine administration were significantly lower in the ascorbic 
acid than the placebo group. The 28 -day mortality was significantly lower in the ascorbic acid than the 
placebo group (14% vs. 64%, p = 0.009). No side effects rela ted to the vitamin C infusion were reported. 
Tanaka et al randomized 37 patients with severe burn to very high dose vitamin C (about 110g/day) or 
placebo.[25] Patients who received vitamin C required less fluid resuscitation with a trend towards 
reduced le ngth of stay and mortality. No adverse effects were noted with the very high dosages of 
vitamin C. Several studies have administered vitamin C in doses exceeding 100g/day as adjuvant therapy 
in patients with cancer with no discernable side effects. [26 -33] Vitamin C appears to be toxic to normal 
human cells (not cancer cells) at a concentration on greater than 25 mM. [33] A dose of 6g/day will 
achieve a steady state serum concentration of about 240uM [34 -36] which is about 100 times less than 
the dose requi red to cause cellular toxicity. The package insert for vitamin C [37] lists no 
contraindications or adverse effects of the drug and states that as much as “6 grams has been 
administered without evidence of toxicity”. The only reported restriction to the us e of high dose 
intravenous vitamin C is in patients with known glucose -6-phospahte deficiency (G6PD) in whom 
hemolysis has been reported. [38,39] It is important to recognize that patents with sepsis predictably 
have very low serum vitamin C levels, which can only be corrected with intravenous vitamin C in a dose 
of more than 3gm per day. [23,34,36] The low or undetectable levels of vitamin C likely result from the 
metabolic consumption of the molecule as well as increased renal losses. Furthermore, unlike all other 
mammals, primates and guinea pigs are unable synthesize vitamin C is due to mutations in the L -gulono -
_-lactone oxidase ( GLO ) gene which codes for the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the last step of 
vitamin C biosynthesis. [40] In almost all s pecies, except humans and guinea pigs, vitamin C production 
increases during stress and is secreted by the adrenal gland; in these species vitamin C is best 
considered a stress “hormone”. [40] Vitamin C is an essential cofactor for the production of 
cortic osteroids and catecholamines by the adrenal gland. [13,41] Vitamin C has been shown to reverse 
adrenal suppression caused by induction doses of etomidate during anesthesia.[42,43]  
Ascorbate donates a single electron in all its redox reactions, generating the ascorbate radical. This 
radical is not very reactive with anything but itself. Dismutation of two ascorbate radicals forms a 
molecule each of ascorbate and dehydroascorbate. Hydrolysis of the lactone ring of dehydroascorbate 
  
Page 3 of 15 
Version 5 – 13 May 2019  irreversibly converts it to  2,3-diketo -1-gulonic acid which is then converted to oxalate. Oxalate is 
normally excreted by the kidney and serum levels will increase with renal impairment. In patients with 
renal impairment receiving mega -dose vitamin C, supersaturation of serum with o xalate may result in 
tissue deposition as well as crystallization in the kidney. [44,45] Glyoxylate, a byproduct of intermediary 
metabolism, is either reduced to oxalate or oxidized to CO 2 by the enzyme glyoxylate aminotransferase; 
thiamine pyrophosphate i s a co -enzyme required for this reaction. [46] Thiamine deficiency increases 
the conversion of glyoxylate to oxalate resulting in hyper - oxalosis. [47,48] Donnino and colleagues have 
demonstrated that thiamine deficiency is common (32%) in patients with se psis and that treatment with 
thiamine in these patients reduces mortality. [49] In a post -hoc analysis of this study these authors 
demonstrated that thiamine decreased the risk of acute kidney injury and the required for renal 
replacement therapy in all tr eated patients. [50]  
It has previously been suggested that “...the best hope for therapeutic advances [in sepsis] will depend 
on broad -base targeting, in which multiple components are targeted at the same time.” [51] Such 
combination “chemo -therapy” target ing multiple biological pathways is the standard approach in the 
treatment of malignant disease. While the benefits of vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine alone are 
likely limited,[23,49,50,52] we believe that these medications act synergistically to r educe the risk of 
organ failure and death in pat ients with sepsis. This hypothesis is supported previous research [53,54] 
and more recently a set of elegant experiments performed by Barabutis et al. [55] Using a validated 
pulmonary endothelial monolayer mo del, these authors demonstrated that hydrocortisone together 
with vitamin C protected the vascular endothelium from damage by endotoxin while neither agent alone 
had this effect. Previous research has demonstrated that vitamin C reverses oxidation of the 
glucocorticoid receptor (GR) a likely manifestation of sepsis.[53] Oxidation of the GR limits binding of the 
GR to both ligand and DNA responsive units decreasing the activity of glucocorticoids. [53] Furthermore, 
glucocorticoids increase the expression of the sodium vitamin C transporter -2 (SVCT -2) which is an 
essential transport protein necessary for vitamin C to be transported intracellularly.[54]  
We therefore propose that a “metabolic resuscitation protocol” including vitamin C, corticosteroids and 
thiamine  will limit the develop ment  of organ failure and reduce mortality in patients with severe sepsis 
and septic shock. This postulate is supported by the preliminary findings by Marik et al. [56] In a 
retrospective before -after clinical study, these authors compared the outcome and clinica l course of 
consecutive septic patients treated with intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone and thiamine during a 7 -
month period (treatment group) compared to a control group treated in during the preceding 7 
months.[56] The primary outcome was hospital sur vival. A propensity score was generated to adjust the 
primary outcome. There were 47 patients in both treatment and control groups with no significant 
differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. The hospital mortality was 8.5% (4 of 47)  
  
Page 4 of 15 
Version 5 – 13 May 2019  in the treatment group compared to 40.4% (19 of 47) in the control group (p < 0.001). The propensity 
adjusted odds of mortality in the patients treated with the vitamin C protocol was 0.13 (95% CI 0.04 -
0.48, p= 0.002). The SOFA score decreased in all patie nts in the treatment group with none developing 
progressive organ failure. Vasopressors were weaned off all patients in the treatment group, a mean of 
18.3 ± 9.8 hours after starting treatment with vitamin C protocol. The mean duration of vasopressor use 
was 54.9 ± 28.4 hours in the control group (p<0.001). The results of this study provide sufficient 
information for the design of an adequately powered, pragmatic randomized controlled trial.

Version 5 – 13 May 2019  Vitamin C, Hydrocortisone and Thiamine dosing protocol and randomization  
Medication dosing.  
Based on published clinical data,  vitamin C pharmacokinetic modeling, the package insert as well as the 
preliminary study by Marik et al, Vitamin C will be administered as an intravenous dose of 6gm per day 
divided in 4 equal doses. [22 -24,34 -37] This dosage is reported to be devoid of an y complications or side 
effects. Hydrocortisone will be dosed according to the consensus guidelines of the American College of 
Critical Care Medicine.[52] Thiamine will be administered according to current reco mmendations in a 
dose of  200mg q 12 hourly. [6 9]  
This is a double -blind placebo controlled study. Only the  dispensing  pharmacist will be aware of the 
treatment allocation. Patients will be randomized to receive either vitamin C/hydrocortisone/thiamine 
or triple placebo using a random number table pro vided to the dispensing pharmacists. Each patient will 
be allocated a unique subject ID which will be linked to the randomization sequence. Only the 
dispensing pharmacists will have a record of the subject ID and random ization sequence. The vitamin C,  
vitamin C -placebo, hydrocortisone, hydrocortisone -placebo, thiamine, and thiamine -placebo will be 
formulated as follows:  
Vitamin C:  Vitamin C is provided by the manufacturer as a 50 ml vial at a concentration of 500mg/ml. 
Three (3) ml of vitamin C will be placed in a 50 ml bag of Normal Saline (1500 mg vitamin C in 50ml bag)  
which will then be infused over 30 minutes (100mL/hr). The b ag will be labeled by the pharmacy as 
“Vitamin C 1.5g or Placebo”. The dosing schedule is 1500mg every 6 hours for 4 days (or discontinued 
earlier if discharge d from the ICU ).  
Once the vial is open, it is only stable for 6 hours. The resulting product is given 12 hour stability. When 
first ordered, 2 doses are made then and sent to the nurse. For next 12 hours, they will wait until 1 hour 
prior to make the next batch.  
Vitamin C placebo will consist of an identical bag of 50mL normal saline (but with no vi tamin C) and will 
be labeled “Vitamin C or Placebo”. Placebo will be infused over 30 minutes as per the infusion 
instructions of the active vitamin.  
Hydrocortisone:  Patients will be treated with hydrocortisone 50mg IV push every 6 hours for 4 days (or 
discontinued earlier if discharge d from the ICU ). Pharmacists will prepare hydrocortisone 50mg/1mL for 
the nurse in a 3mL syringe which will be labeled “Hydrocortisone 50mg or Placebo”. Hydrocortisone 
placebo will be provided as an identical 3mL syringe as 1m L of normal saline. Two doses of study 
medication will be prepared at a time.  
  
Page 7 of 15 
Version 5 – 13 May 2019  Thiamine:  Intravenous thiamine will be given in a dose of 200mg q 12 hourly for 4 days (or discontinued 
earlier if discharge d from the ICU ). This will be placed in a 50mL bag of  Normal Saline labeled “Thiamine 
200mg or Placebo” and run over 30 minutes (100mL/hr) Placebo patients will receive a matching 50mL 
bag of Normal Saline. One dose will be prepared at a time.   
Power Calculation:  
Based on the results of the preliminary stud y of Marik et al we project that the combination of 
hydrocortisone, vitamin C and thiamine could reduce time to vasopressor discontinuation from 54  (+/- 
30 hours) versus  30 hours.  For the additional primary outcome we projected a greater change of SOFA 
score of 4 (+/ - 3) versus 2.   Assuming a type 1 error of 5% (alpha of 0.05) and a power of 80% (the ability 
to detect a difference between two groups when a difference exists) would require a sample size of 94 
patients. To account for dropouts and patients not requiring vasopressor therapy  we will therefore aim 
for a sample size of 140 patients.  
Data Collection:  
The following de -identified demographic and clinical data will be colle cted.  
i. Age  
ii. Sex  
iii. Weight   
iv. Admitting diagnosis and possible site of infection  
v. Blood c ulture results   
vi. Co -morbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, cardiac failure, COPD, malignancy  
vii. Requirement for mechanical ventilation (Y/N).  
viii. Use of vasopressor agents (Y/N). The hourly dosage of vasopressors will be recorded as the 
norepinephrine equivalent dosage. [70,71]  
ix. Duration of vasopressor use  
x. Time  to vasopressor independence fro m start of active drug/placebo  
xi. Daily urine output (for first 4 days)  
  
Page 8 of 15 
Version 5 – 13 May 2019  xii. Fluid balance after 24 and 72 hours   
xiii. Presence of acute kidney injury (AKI). Presence of AKI: Acute kidney injury (AKI) will be defined using 
the KDIGO criteria; namely, an increase of the s -creatinine > 0.3  mg/dl or a level > 1.5 times the baseline 
value. [27] If the baseline s -creatinine is not known a value > 1.5 mg/dl will be regarded as diagnostic of 
AKI.  
xiv. Length of ICU and hospital stay   
xv. ICU, hospital,  and 28-day mortality  
xvi. Routine laboratory data for 4 days including:  
a. serum creatinine  
b. white cell count (WBC)  
c. platelet count   
d. total bilirubin   
e. PaO 2/FiO 2 ratio  
f. Procalcitonin (PCT) – on days 1 and 4  
g. lactate level   
h. urine oxalate level (day 4)  
xvii. H ostDx Sepsis genetic testing (day 1) if consent is provided for additional sub -study.  
xviii. The patients’ admission APACHE II and APACHE IV scores will be recorded. The APACHE IV score 
allows calculation of the predicted hospital mortality and predicted ICU length of stay (LOS).   
ixx. The daily SOFA (Sepsis -related Organ Failure Assessment) score will be recorded for the first 4 
treatment days.  
The APACHE II score (incrementing score of 0 -71) and APACHE IV score (incrementing score 0 -286) are 
standardized measures of disease severity that are used to predict hospital mortality and ICU LOS. 
[72,73] The SOFA score was designed to sequentially asses s the severity of organ dysfunction in patients 
who are critically ill from sepsis (incrementing score 0 -24). [74]. The SOFA scores is calculated 24 hours 
  
Page 9 of 15 
Version 5 – 13 May 2019  after admission to the ICU and daily thereafter. SOFA scores that increase by about 30 percent are 
associated with a mortality of at least 50 percent.[75]  
 
Data will be collected in the attached Excel  spreadsheet (Appendix A – Sepsis Data spreadsheet). No 
personal identifiers will be recorded on the spreadsheet. We will not be recording names, dates of b irth, 
social security or EMR numbers or any other HPI data in the data collection spreadsheet. Each record 
will be assigned a unique study ID number (subject ID key). A separate password protected spreadsheet 
will have a list of subject ID number and the c orresponding medical record numbers ( Subject ID Key data 
sheet). This spreadsheet will only be accessible to the principle investor and sub -PI. The pharmacist will 
have a copy of the “ Research Randomization and Dispensing Log ” with an additional field whic h will 
include the randomization code to active vitamin protocol or placebo. Only the pharmacist will have 
access to the “ Research Randomization and Dispensing Log ” until after the study is completed, when it 
will be made available to the principle investo r and sub -PI.  
Data analysis:  
Summary statistics will be used to describe the clinical data and presented as mean ± SD, median with 
interquartile range (IQR) or percentages as appropriate. Chi squared analysis with Fisher’s exact test 
(when appropriate) a nd Student’s t test (Mann Whiney U test for non - normal distributions) were used 
to compare data between the active treatment group and the placebo group with statistical significance 
declared for probability values of 0.05 or less.  
Data Safety & storage:   
The main risk to subjects is the accidental release of PHI. Careful record management methods will be in 
place to ensure this type of privacy breach does not occur.  
Subject ID Key: Each subject will be given a unique subject ID number. A subject ID key will be used to 
match the subjects Financial Identification Number (FIN). The subject ID key, linking the subject ID 
numbers to the FIN will be kept in a password -protected file on the pharmacy IV room and pharmacy co -
investigator computer. Only the resear ch team (PI, sub PI and research pharmacists) will have access to 
this information, and they will not disclose this information to any other person or entity. The subject ID 
key will be destroyed as soon as possible after the data set has been completely a bstracted and 
validated for accuracy and completeness.  
Data set: Similarly, the data set will be kept in a password -protected file and stored separately from the 
  
Page 10 of 15 
Version 5 – 13 May 2019  subject ID key in the locked office of the study coordinator. Only the research team will hav e access to 
this information, and they will not disclose this information to any other person or entity. Three years 
after the completion of the study, all collected data will be destroyed by permanently deleting electronic 
copies.

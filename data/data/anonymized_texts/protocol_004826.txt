 SYNOPSIS  
 
 
Protocol  Title:  Effects  of NOV03  on the Tear Film  in Subjects  with Dry Eye 
Disease  
Protocol  Number:  922 
Investigational  Product:  Perfluorohexyloctane  (PFHO;  MIEBO ™; NOV03)  
Study  Phase:  4 
 
Primary  Objective(s):  Determine the effect of a single instillation of PFHO on the 
thickness  and evaporation  rate of the mucus -aqueous  layer  of 
the tear film  
 
Exploratory  Objective(s):   
 
Overall  Study  Design:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Structure:  This pilot, open label, single -arm, single -center study will 
consist of 2 study visits in subjects with dry eye disease 
associated with MGD.  A Screening Visit will occur to verify 
subjects are eligible to participate followed by an Assessment 
Visit to eval uate tear film parameters at baseline and over 
approx. 4 hours following a single instillation of PFHO.  
Screening Visit: At Visit 1, the subjects will complete the 
informed consent process followed by a screening visit to 
determine  the presence  of dry eye and associated  MGD,  which 
will include slit -lamp exam, visual acuity (VA), intraocular 
pressure (IOP), meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) 
assessment, Schirmer test, tear film break up time (TFBUT), 
corneal fluorescein staining (CFS), and ocular surface dise ase 
index (OSDI).  
Assessment  Visit:  At Visit  2, a slit lamp  examination  and two 
baseline tear film assessments will be performed (tear film 
parameters: mucus -aqueous  layer thickness  (MALT);  mucus - 
aqueous  thinning  rate (MALTR);   
 
 Then 1 
drop of PFHO will be instilled into both eyes (the study eye 
will be the eye with the highest corneal fluorescein stainin g). 
The above assessments will be repeated at multiple time 
points up to 4 hours post -instillation (time points: 5±1 min, 
15±2 min, 30±2 min, 60±5 min, 120±10 min, 240±10 min).  
Any adverse  events  will be recorded.

Full Analysis  Set (FAS):  The FAS will consist of  all enrolled subjects  who are instilled with  study drug 
Per Protocol  Set (PP Set):  The PP Set will consist  of FAS  subjects  with no protocol  violations  expected 
to affect the evaluability of efficacy.  
Safety  Analysis  
The number and percentage of subjects with specific treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will 
be summarized  for each treatment  group.  The number of  subjects  will be tabulated  by MedDRA  System 
Organ Class and preferred term within each system organ class.  
 
Primary  Efficacy  Analyses  
 
The primary comparison in this trial is CFB in MALTR and MALT following a single instillation of 
PFHO. Change from baseline (post -instillation minus baseline, average of 2 baseline readings) at each 
post instillation time point will be summarized using con tinuous summary statistics.  
 
Hypotheses  
For each primary endpoint at each post -instillation timepoint, the null hypothesis is that the mean 
change  from  baseline  is zero.  The alternative  hypothesis  is that the mean  change  from  baseline  is not 
zero.  
 
Methods  
Each primary endpoint will be summarized by post -instillation timepoint using continuous summary 
statistics for the FAS. Paired t -tests will be used to test the statistical hypotheses. Each null hypothesis 
will be rejected if the corresponding two -sided p -value is less than 0.05.  
Sample  Size Calculations  
A sample size of 30 subjects will have 80% power to detect a difference in means of 0.529 times the 
standard  deviation  of the paired  differences,  using  a paired  t-test with a 5% two-sided  significance  level.

 1 INTRODUCTION  
Dry eye disease  (DED)  is a common  ocular condition  with approx. 18  million  currently  diagnosed  with the 
disease in the US, and  with many  more people  remaining undiagnosed (Farrand, et al. 2017; MarketScope 
2020). Typical clinical signs of DED include decreased tear fluid, tear film instability, and ocular surface 
damage with associated symptoms of dryness, grittiness, burning, stinging, light sensitivity, and blurred 
vision (Bartlett, et al. 2015; Craig, et al. 2017).  Previously, DED was charac terized into 2 main types, 
aqueous  deficient  (in which  lacrimal  secretion  is reduced) or evaporative  (in which  evaporation  of aqueous 
from the  tear film is excessive) (Bron, et  al. 2017;  Craig, et al. 2017).  It is now  recognized that DED  is on 
a continuum and that the most common cause of the disease is excessive evaporation due to conditions 
such as meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), a reduced blink rate (for example due to long -term use of 
digital displays), certain drugs, contact lens u se, and some eyelid disorders (Craig, et al. 2017).  The most 
common cause of evaporative DED is MGD, which is present in approx. 9 out of 10 patients with the 
disease (Lemp, et al. 2012;  Rabensteiner, et al. 2018; Badian, et al. 2021).  MGD results in  thinn ing of the 
tear film lipid layer leading to excessive evaporation of the underlying aqueous layer and associated tear 
film instability, hyperosmolarity, desiccation stress, and loss of mucin -producing goblet cells, which all 
cascade into a continuing cycle  of inflammation and ocular surface damage (Baudouin, et al. 2016; Craig, 
et al. 2017).  
 
Current  prescription  DED  therapies  are aimed  at reducing  inflammation  or increasing  tear secretion  but are 
not directly targeted at the main root cause of DED, namely excessive evaporation.  Perfluorohexyloctane 
ophthalmic solution (PFHO; trade name MIEBO ™; development name NOV03) is an FDA approved, 
water -free, non -steroidal, preservative -free eye drop indicated for treatment of the signs and symptoms of 
DED.  PFHO belon gs to a unique class of compounds known as semifluorinated alkanes which have low 
surface tension and amphiphilic properties due to a lipophobic/aerophilic fluorinated segment and a 
lipophilic hydrocarbon segment (Meinert and Roy 2000).  PFHO is thought to act as a functional 
replacement for the lipid layer by spreading rapidly over the ocular surface to form a long -lasting , anti- 
evaporative barrier (Agarwal, et al. 2018; Krosser 2018; Borchman 2022).  Therefore, PFHO may prevent 
excessive evaporation of the  aqueous component of the tear film in patients with evaporative DED, thus 
reducing the signs and symptoms of DED as has been consistently demonstrated in both a Phase 2 study 
and 2 Phase 3 clinical studies (Tauber, et al. 2021; Sheppard 2022; Tauber, et a l. 2022).  
 
To date, the effect of PFHO on inhibiting evaporation in vivo has not been demonstrated and there is 
limited available information regarding how PFHO modulates the lipid and aqueous tear film layers; in 
addition, demonstration of inhibition of evaporation by PFHO is currently limited to in vitro data.  The 
Tear Film Imager  (AdOM,  Advanced  Optical  Technologies  Ltd, Lod, Israel)  combines  spectrometry  and 
imaging to quantitatively assess changes in the tear lipid and aqueous layers with nanometer resolution. 
There are 6 tear film parameters which are measured simultaneous ly with the TFI:  
 
1. MALT:  the average  Muco -Aqueous  Layer Thickness  in nanometer  resolution  
2. MALTR:  the rate of change  of the  MALT value  in nm/sec, as  measured  in the steady  state phase  of 
a representative blink  
3. LLT:  the average  Lipid  Layer  Thickness  in nanometer  resolution  
4. LBUT:  the Lipid Break Up  Time  (in sec)  which  strongly correlates  to tear breakup  time 
5. IBI: the average  Inter -Blink -Interval  (in sec). 
6. LMU:  the average  Lipid  Map Uniformity  measured  on the Lipid  map taken  about  1 second  after the 
blink which allows quantitation of the spatial variation of lipid across the cornea.

 Several studies have been published which evaluated tear film parameters with the TFI.  Cohen et al  used 
the TFI to demonstrate  that the  distribution  of lipid in eyes  with DED  is nonuniform  and has  more  variance 
over the corneal surface as compared to normal eyes and hypothesized that this nonuniformity may be the 
cause of increased evaporation of  the aqueous  tear film layer  in DED  (Cohen, et al. 2020).  In addition, the 
parameters of MALT and LBUT have been shown to be significantly thinner and shorter, respectively, in 
patients with DED vs controls (Segev, et al. 2020).  Data from a recent study has also demonstrated 
correlation of specific tear film paramet ers with certain DED symptoms and/or signs (Arita, et al. 2022).  
Lastly, unpublished  pilot data suggests  that PFHO  may decrease  the MALTR  and thus the rate of 
evaporation in a subject with evaporative DED.  
 
2 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective is  to test the  hypotheses (twelve) that the  effects of  a single instillation  of PFHO in 
the study eye  on the  thickness  and evaporation rate  of the  mucus -aqueous  layer of the  tear film at six  time 
points between 5 minutes and 4 -hours ( 5±1 min, 15±2 min, 30±2 min, 60±5 min, 120±10 min, 240±10 
min) after instillation are nominally statistically significant in adults with established currently untreated 
bilateral  dry eye disease  associated  with meibomian  gland  dysfunction  who are not recen t users  of contact 
lenses or any medication that could affect ocular dryness.  
 
 
 
 
3 CLINICAL  HYPOTHESES  
It is hypothesized  that PFHO  will increase  MALT and  decrease  MALTR  in a population  of subjects  with 
dry eye d isease associated with MGD.  
 
4 OVERALL  STUDY  DESIGN  
This is a pilot,  open  label,  single arm  study.  
The study  will consist  of 2 study  visits:  a Screening  Visit  to verify  subjects  are eligible  to participate  and an 
Assessment study visit to evaluate tear film parameters at baseline and over approx. 4 hours following a 
single instillation of PFHO (Figure 1).  
At Visit  1, the subjects  will complete  the informed  consent  process  followed  by a screening  visit to determi ne 
the presence of dry eye and associated MGD, which will include slit -lamp exam, visual acuity (VA), IOP, 
MGD  assessment, Schirmer  test, TBUT,  CFS,  OSDI.  At Visit  2, a slit lamp  examination  will be performed. 
After  20 min, a baseline  examination  will be conducted  by performing  a Tear Film  Imager  assessment  in the 
study eye (tear film parameters measured twice 20 -40 min apart; study eye = worst CFS eye at baseline). 
The study eye drop will  then be applied to both  eyes. Tear film imager assessments will then be performed 
in the study eye at multiple time points up to 4 hours post -instillation as shown in Figure 1.

9 ADVERSE  EVENTS  
 Definition of Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse  event  is any untoward  medical  occurrence  in a subje ct participating  in a clinical  study,  which 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study product/procedure.  Therefore, an adverse 
event includes:  
• Any unfavorable  and/or  unintended  sign (including  an abnormal  laboratory  finding),  symptom, or 
disease onset, that occurs at any time between the signing of the ICF and study exit, without any 
judgement about causality (i.e., whether or not it is considered to be  related to the study product)  
• Exacerbation,  worsening,  or progression  of a pre-existing  illness,  including  an increase  in severity, 
frequency, and/or duration of a pre -existing episodic event or condition  
• Events occurring from drug overdose (accidental or intentional), drug abuse or misuse, drug 
hypersensitivity,  drug extravasati on, drug interactions,  drug dependency,  events  occurring  from 
drug withdrawal and medication errors  
• A condition  detected  or diagnosed  after study  product  administration  even though  it may have  been 
present prior to the start of the study  
A treatment -emergent  adverse  event  (TEAE) is  defined  as an AE with  a start date on or after the  first dose 
of study drug, or that worsened following administration of study drug.  
An AE does not include the  following:  

NOV03  (Perfluorohexyloctane) 
Clinical Trial Protocol #922  Sponsor:  Bausch  & Lomb  Incorporated 
Oct 16th 2023 FINAL v3.0  
Confidential  
Page 25 of 47  
 • Medical  or surgical  procedures  (e.g.,  surgery,  endoscopy,  tooth  extraction,  transfusion)  as event 
terms; the condition that led to the procedure is the AE if it meets the definition of an AE.  
•  Situations  where  an untoward  medical  occurrence  has not occurred  (e.g., hospitalization  for 
cosmetic elective surgery; and social and/or convenience admiss ions).  
Symptoms  associated  with disease,  which  are consistent  with the subject’s  usual  clinical  course;  unless  the 
subject experiences worsening of their symptom(s) or the symptom(s) meet the criteria for an SAE.  
 
9.1.1 Assessment  of Severity  of Adverse  Events  
The severity of an AE will be graded as follows:  
Mild  Awareness of a sign or symptom but is easily tolerated, 
requires  no treatment,  and does not interfere  with subject’s 
daily activities  
Moderate  Low level  of concern  to the subject  and may interfere  with 
daily activities but can be relieved by simple therapeutic 
care.  
Severe  Interrupts  the subject’s  daily  activity  and requires 
systemic therapy or other treatment  
 
9.1.2 Assessment  of Causality  of Adverse  Events  
The relationship  of an  AE to  the study  product  will be assessed  using  the following  guidelines, based  upon 
available information:  
 
Related  There  is at least a reasonable  possibility  that the AE/SAE 
is related  to the study  drug.  Reasonable  possibility  means 
that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the AE.  
Not Related  There is little or no reasonable possibility that the 
AE/SAE  is related  to the study  drug.  This assessment 
implies that the AE/SAE has little or no temporal 
relationship to the  study drug  and/or a  more  likely  or 
certain alternative etiology exists.  
 
Rationale  MUST be  provided  for any “not related”  assessment  and is recommended  for “related” 
assessments.  
 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE  is considered “serious”  if it meets  at least one  of the following  criteria.  The event:  
• Results  in death

 • Is life threatening (places  the subject at  immediate  risk of  death)  
NOTE:  The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the subject 
was at risk of death  at the time of the  event.  It does not refer  to an event  which  hypothetically  might  have 
caused death if it were more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization NOTE:  The term 
“hospitalization” refers to admission to a hospital as an in -patient for more than 24 hours. 
Therefore,  an adverse  event  would  meet  the SAE  criterion  of “requires  hospitalization”  only if the 
event necessitated admission to a health care facility for longer than 24 hours.  Elective 
hospitalization for an intervention that was already planned before inclusion of the subject i n the 
study, hospitalization solely for the  purpose of  diagnostic tests  (even if  related to an  AE), hospital 
admission for social circumstances, and admission to a day -care facility may not constitute 
sufficient grounds to be considered an SAE.  
Cases in which subjects are retained in the emergency room for more than 24 hours but not 
admitted  for medical  care should  be evaluated  individually,  because  the criterion  “otherwise 
medically significant” may apply (see below).  
• Results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity  
NOTE: The term “disability” means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance (e.g., uncomp licated headache, influenza, or sprained ankle) that may transiently 
interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is considered otherwise medically significant, as determined by the PI or medically qualified sub - 
investigator  
NOTE:  The term “medically  significant”  refers  to important  medical  events  that may not immediately 
be life threatening  or result  in death  or hospitalization,  but, based  upon  appropriate  medical  judgment, 
they jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the definition of an SAE.  
Examples of such medically significant events in clude allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Spontaneous  abortion,  elective  abortion  and ectopic  pregnancy  will be considered  SAEs  and must  be reported 
to the sponsor within 24 hours of awareness of the event.  
Subjects  will be withdrawn  from  the study  if an SAE  is identified  and thought  to be related  to the study  drug. 
The investigator is responsible for the reporting of all SAEs.  
Within  24 hours  following  the investigator’s  knowledge  of an SAE,  the investigator  must:  
• Report  the SAE  to the sponsor/designee.  
All SAEs occurring between screening and 30 days after the  last administered dose of study drug 
(inclusive) must be reported to the sponsor/designee, independent of the circumstance or suspected 
cause, and  regardless  of the  relationship  to the study  drug or protocol,  within  24 hours  from  the time 
the event was reported to the investigator.  For events occurring beyond the 30 -day period after the 
last application  of study  drug,  or for any timeframe  greater  than 30 days deemed  medically

 significant, only SAEs considered related to the study drug should be reported promptly to the 
sponsor.  
If the subject dies during participation in the study or during recognized follow -up period, and if 
cause of death is not available within the 24 -hour r eporting period, “death” must be reported as an 
SAE term  to meet  the timelines. Cause of death  must be actively  queried  and submitted  as a follow - 
up report.

Fax: +1 -585-510-5552  
 
Include copies of all confirmatory examinations carried out and the dates on which these 
examinations  were  performed.  Care  should  be taken  to ensure  that the subject's  identity  is protected 
(personal identifiers are redacted), and the date and subject id entifier in the clinical trial (i.e.,  
subject number) are  clearly visible  on every page/copy of source  document  provided  to the  sponsor. 
For laboratory results, include the laboratory normal ranges.  
• Investigators  should  not wait to receive  additional  information  before  notifying  the sponsor of  an 
SAE.  If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are require d. 
Within  48 hours  following  the investigator’s  knowledge  of an SAE,  the investigator  must:  
• Enter  the information  related  to the SAE in the  appropriate sections  of the CRF.  
• Send  notification  of the SAE  to the monitoring  team after  investigator  approval  of the CRF 
All further data updates should be recorded in the CRF within one working day of knowledge of this 
additional  information.  Send  notification  of the updated  SAE information  to the monitoring  team  after 
investigator approval of the CRF.  
Additional documentation (e.g., laboratory data, concomitant medication, subject status, etc.), should 
be sent by fax or e -mail to the monitoring team within one working day of knowledge of this 
information.  Care  should be taken to  ensure that  the subject's  identity is  protected  (personal identifiers 
are redacted) and the date and subject identifier in the clinical trial (i.e., subject number) are clearly 
visible  on every  page/copy  of source  document  that is provided  to the monitoring  team.  For laboratory 
results, include the laboratory normal ranges.  
After the EOS visit, the investigator does not need to actively monitor subjects for new SAEs. 
However, if the investigator becomes aware of a new or previously unreported serious adverse event 
within 30 days after the last investigational drug instillation, the event should be reported to the 
sponsor/designee within 24 hours of  learning of the event.  If the investigator  becomes aware of a  new 
or previously unreported SAE after 30 days from the last investigational drug instillation, only SAEs 
considered related to the study drug should be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s  knowledge  of the event.  Serious  adverse  events  reported  outside  of the protocol -required 
reporting  period will be captured  within  the safety  database  as clinical  trial SAE  Report  Form  cases  for 
the purposes of expedited reporting.

 9.2.1 Expedited  Serious  Adverse  Events  
Any suspected unexpected serious adverse event considered related to the study drug may warrant 
expedited reporting. In addition, any unexpected SAE related to a subject’s participation in the study (or 
related to the  conduct of  the study), regardless of  whether or not  the study  drug was administered, will be 
evaluated by Global Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management to determine if expedited reporting is 
required.  For example, an  unexpected, severe  SAE  that could  be associated  with the study  procedures  and 
could modify the study conduct requires expedited reporting.  
Each expedited safety report will routinely include a brief cover memorandum, the completed MedWatch 
Form FDA 3500A, a clinical analysis of the event with any similar events that have occurred wi th the 
product, and any additional pertinent information recommended by the study medical monitor. Once the 
report is compiled, the study center’s investigator must submit the expedited safety report to the local 
IRB/IEC within the required reporting timef rame. Follow -up reports should be submitted when requested 
or when  pertinent  information  becomes  available.  The principal  investigator must  retain  a complete  copy  of 
each expedited safety report as it was submitted to  the IRB/IEC. It is important that the principal 
investigator review these expedited reports, as they  contain safety information  that may be  relevant to  each 
of the participating subjects.  
 
9.2.2 Pregnancy  
All female subjects of childbearing potential and male subjects with female partners of childbearing 
potential  must  use an effective  method  of birth  control  during  the course  of the  study,  in a manner such  that 
risk of contraceptive failure is minimized.  Abstinence is allowed as a birth control method.  Before 
enrolling a  female subject of childbearing potential or a  male subject with  a female partner of childbearing 
potential, the investigator must review the following information about study participation:  
 
• Informed  consent  requirement  
• Contraceptives  in current  use 
By signing the informed consent form, the investigator or designee asserts that he/she has discussed this 
information with the subject and provided appropriate counseling. Following the review of this 
information,  the subject  must  sign the informed  consent  form  to enroll  in the study.  During  the study, all 
subjects should be instructed to contact the investigator immediately if they suspect that they or their 
partners might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period).  
 
If a subject or investigator  suspects  that the  subject may be  pregnant prior to  treatment, the  study  drug must 
be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are available.  If pregnancy is confirmed, the 
subject  is considered  to be a screen  failure,  must  not continue  in the study,  and must  not receive  study  drug. 
If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is receiving study treatment, the study drug must immediately 
be withheld until the result of pregnancy testing is known.  If pregnancy is confirmed, the stu dy drug will 
be permanently discontinued, and the subject and neonate will be followed until 30 days after the 
pregnancy comes to term.  A Pregnancy Report form will be submitted to the sponsor, both when 
pregnancy is confirmed, and 30 days after the delive ry date.  Information provided on the Pregnancy 
Report Form must include the outcome of the pregnancy and any complications occurring during the 
pregnancy or the delivery.  
 
If a subject  is withdrawn  from  the study  and is found  to be pregnant  within  30 days of withdrawal, the 
subject and neonate will be followed until 30 days after the pregnancy comes to term.

 All confirmed  pregnancies  must  be immediately  reported  to the sponsor/designee  and medical  monitor on  a 
Pregnancy Report form within 24  hours  of the investigator’s  awareness  of the  pregnancy.  If a pregnancy is 
associated with an SAE, an SAE  report form should also be submitted to  the sponsor/designee and medical 
monitor within  24 hours  of the investigator’ s awareness.  Abnormal  pregnancy  outcomes  (e.g., spontaneous 
abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.  
 
Completed SAE Report Forms and completed Pregnancy Report Forms should be transmitted to the 
spons or/designee  and the medical  monitor using  the contact  information  provided  in Section  9.2 above.  
 
If/when the investigator becomes aware of any new information regarding a pregnancy, the 
sponsor/designee  and medical  monitor should  be notified  of these  updates  as soon  as the new information 
becomes  available.  Updates  should  be documented  on a Pregnancy  Report  Form  and sent by fax or email 
using the contact information provided above.  The report should be marked as a follow -up report” and 
should include t he updated status of the pregnancy.  The original Pregnancy Report Form is not to be 
altered.  
 
 General Guidelines for Reporting Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur during the course of the study. 
Throughout the study, efforts will be made by the investigator to remain alert to possible AEs.  The period 
of observation for collection  of AEs exte nds from the time the subject gives informed  consent until the last 
study  visit or discontinuation  from  the study.  The first concern  will always  be the safety  of the subject, and 
appropriate medical intervention will be made.  
The AEs should  be documented  as a single  medical  diagnosis. When  this is not possible, the  AE should  be 
documented in terms of signs and/or symptoms observed by the investigator or reported by the  subject at 
each study visit. Each AE which appears to be  independent of any prior event will be reported separately.  
All AEs occurring  after the subject  signs  the informed  consent  through  the last study  visit must  be reported, 
regardless of whether or not  the AEs  are considered drug -related. All AEs, whether in response to a query, 
observed by the study site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the subject, will be recorded. Any AEs 
deemed related to treatment reported or observed at the final study/treatment vi sit will be followed until 
stabilization or resolution (or up to 30 days after final study visit).  
At each visit during the study, the subject will be assessed for the occurrence of new and ongoing AEs. 
Tolerability  signs  and symptoms  that result  in the subject’s  requiring  a concomitant  therapy, interruption  of 
treatment, or discontinuation  from  the study  will be reported  as an AE. The following  data will be collected 
on all AEs and recorded on the appropriate CRF:  
• Event  name  (diagnosis  preferred,  if unknow n, record  the signs/symptoms)  
• Onset  date and end date 
• Maximum  intensity  (severity)  
• Seriousness  
• Action taken regarding  study  drug 
• Corrective  treatment/therapy,  if given  
• Outcome

Page 30 of 47  
 • Resolution  
The investigator will also provide an assessment of the causal relationship to the study drug (for pre - 
treatment  AEs,  causality  is “not related”).  Rationale  MUST  be provided  for any “not related”  assessment 
and is recommended for “related” assessments.  
All AEs must  be reported  regardless  of whether  the AEs are considered drug -related.  
In order to ensure  the safety of the subjects, the  investigator should take appropriate  measures to follow all 
subjects  with adverse  events  until clinical  recovery  is complete, progression  has been stabilized, the  subject 
is lost to follow -up, or  until death.  This may result  in the  need for  observations to continue  beyond the last 
planned protocol specified visit, and additional investigations may be requested by the mo nitoring team.  
If a subject  requires  further  follow -up of ongoing  AEs upon  discontinuation  or completion  of the study, the 
Investigator should schedule post -study follow -up visits, as necessary.  
Laboratory  results, vital  signs, or  ECG  abnormalities  are to be recorded  as AEs (or SAEs,  if applicable) 
only if at least one of the following apply:  
• the result is  clinically  significant  
• the subject is  symptomatic  
• the subject requires  either  corrective  treatment or  consultation  
• the lab result,  vital sign, or  ECG  abnormality  leads  to study  drug discontinuation  or dose 
modification  
• the event  fulfills  a criterion  for an SAE 
In addition,  the investigator’s  assessment  of causality  will be recorded.  
Vital sign abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs (or SAEs, if applicable) only if they are clinically 
significant  (for example:  are symptomatic,  requiring  corrective  treatment,  leading  to discontinuation  or 
fulfilling a seriousness criterion).  
 
10 STATISTIC S 
 Assessment of Efficacy  
Efficacy  evaluations  will be completed using  the Full Analysis  Set. 
10.1.1  Primary  Efficacy  
For each primary endpoint at each post -instillation timepoint, the null hypothesis (H 0) is that the mean 
change  from  baseline  (δ) is zero.  The alternative  hypothesis  is that the mean  change  from  baseline  is not 
zero.  
𝐻𝐻 0: 𝛿𝛿 = 0 
𝐻𝐻 1: 𝛿𝛿 ≠ 0 
MALT  and MALTR  will be summarized  using  continuous  summary  statistics  by time point  (baseline,  5 
minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 -, 2-, and 4 hours). Change from baseline (post -instillation minus 
baseline) at each post instillation time point will be sum marized using continuous summary statistics.  
Paired  t-tests will be used to test the statistical  hypotheses.

 10.1.2  Secondary Efficacy  
This section is  not applicable  because  there are  no secondary efficacy  endpoints.  
10.1.3  Exploratory Efficacy  
The exploratory  endpoints  will be analyzed  in the same manner  as the primary  efficacy  endpoints.  
10.1.4  Statistical  Hypothesis  Testing  and Control  of Multiplicity  
Due to clinical  considerations,  the 36 statistical  tests will not be adjusted  for multiplicity.  The p-values  and 
any conclusions of statistical significance will be considered nominal.  
10.1.5  General  Considerations  
Quantitative  variables  will be summarized  descriptively  using  the number  of subjects  (n), mean,  median, 
standard  deviation,  minimu m, and maximum.  Qualitative  variables  will be summarized  using  counts  and 
percentages.  
All efficacy  analyses  will use a two-sided  alpha  = 0.05 test unless  otherwise  stated  and corresponding  2- 
sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be presented as applicable.  
For efficacy and non -ocular safety analyses, the unit of analysis will be the subject. In the cases where 
assessments  are recorded  for each  eye, the study  eye and fellow  eye will be summarized  separately  and a 
mean across all eyes will also be calculated.  
 
Adverse events will also be summarized at the subject level; if an AE occurs in either or both eyes, the 
subject  will be counted  as having  the AE. For other ocular safety  analyses  the unit of analysis  will be the 
eye, with summaries showing results for the study eye and the fellow eye separately.  
 
 Assessment of Safety  
The following  safety  variables  will be recorded:  
 
• Adverse  Events  (AEs;  reported,  elicited  and observed)  
10.2.1  Adverse  Events  
Adverse events (AEs) wil l be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. Frequencies and percentages of 
treatment -emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  will be summarized  at the subject  level  by system  organ  class 
and preferred term for all TEAEs, treatment related TEAEs, and serious TEAEs. An AE is treatment 
emergent if it occurs or worsens after the first dose of study medication. Similar summaries will be 
presented for all TEAEs by maximal severity. Separat e summaries will be performed for ocular and  non- 
ocular AEs.  
10.2.2  Concomitant  Medications  
All previous  concomitant  medications  will be classified  based  on terminology  from  the WHO  Drug 
Dictionary. Previous therapies and concomitant medications data will be pre sented in data listings.  
 
 Subject Disposition  
Subject  disposition  will be presented  in terms  of the numbers  and percentages  of subjects  who completed 
the study and discontinued from the study.

 The number  and percentage  of subjects  who prematurely  discontinue  from  the study  and the reasons  for 
study discontinuation will be summarized.  
 
 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Subject  demographics  including  age, sex, ethnicity,  race,  and baseline  characteristics  will be summarized 
using the appropriate descriptive statistics.  
 Protocol Deviations  
All protocol  deviations  will be reported  to the sponsor and  recorded  throughout  the study.  A tabulation  of 
protocol deviations (including categorizations of major and minor) wil l be presented.  
Important  protocol  deviations  leading  to exclusion  from  the Per-Protocol  Population  will include  the 
following.  
• Ineligibility  
• Missing  primary endpoint data at  any time  point  at Visit  1 
• Use of any  prohibited  medication  potentially  affecting  the primary  endpoint  at Visit  1 
 
 
 Compliance  
Compliance  will not be  evaluated  in this  study  since the  site will administer  the drop.  
 
 Interim Analyses  
There  are no  interim  analyses  planned for  this study.  
 
 Additional Statistical Considerations  
10.8.1  Analysis  Population  
• Full Analysis  Set (FAS):  The FAS will consist  of all  subjects  who are instilled  with study 
drug.  
• Per Protocol  Set (PP Set):  The PP Set will consist  of FAS  subjects  with no protocol 
deviations expected to affect the evaluability of efficacy.  
10.8.2  Sample Size Determination  
A sample  size of 30 subjects  will have  80% power  to detect  a difference  in means  of 0.529  times  the standard 
deviation of the paired differences, using a paired t -test with a 5% two -sided significance level.  
10.8.3  Multiplicity  Issues  
The probability  of at least one type 1 error  will be approximately  79% under the  universal  null hypothesis 
if the 36 endpoints are independent.

 11 COMPLIANCE  WITH  GOOD  CLINICAL  PRACTICES,  ETHICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS, AND ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, current Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), 
including  the International  Conference  on Harmonisation  (ICH)  Guidelines,  and in general,  consistent  with 
the Declaration of Helsinki. In addition, all  applicable local, state, and federal  requirements  relevant to the 
use of IP in the countries involved will be adhered to.  
 
 Protection of Human Subjects  
11.1.1  Subject  Informed Consent  
Informed consent/assent must take place before any study specific procedures are initiated. Signed and 
dated written informed c onsent must be obtained from each subject and/or from the subject’s parent or  
legal  guardian  prior to  enrollment  into the study.  If the subject  is under  the legal  age of consent,  the consent 
form must be signed by a legal guardian or as required by state a nd/or local laws and regulations.  
All informed  consent/assent  forms  must  be approved  for use by the sponsor and  receive  approval/favorable 
opinion from an IRB/IEC prior to their use. If the consent form requires revision (e.g., due to a protocol 
amendment or significant new safety information), it is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that the 
amended informed cons ent is reviewed and approved by B+L prior to submission to the governing 
IRB/IEC and that it is read, signed and dated by all subjects subsequently enrolled in the study as well as 
those currently enrolled in the study.  
11.1.2  Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB) Approval  
This study is to be conducted in accordance with IRB regulations (U.S. 21 CFR Part 56.103). The 
investigator must  obtain  appropriate  IRB approval  before  initiating  the study  and re-approval  at least 
annually.  
Only an IRB/IEC  approved  version of  the informed consent  form  will be  used.  
 
 Ethical Conduct of the Study  
This study  will be conducted  in accordance  with the ethical  principles  that originated  with the Declaration 
of Helsinki.  
 Subject Confidentiality  
All personal  study  subject  data collected  and processed  for the  purposes  of this study  should  be maintained 
by the investigator and his/her staff with adequate precautions as to ensure that the confidentiality of the 
data is in accordance with local, state, and federal laws and regulatio ns. 
Anonymized  TFI measurement data  will be analyzed by AdOM.  
Monitors, auditors  and other authorized  representatives  of the  sponsor,  the IRB/IEC  approving  this study, 
the FDA, the DHHS, other domestic government agencies, and other foreign regulatory agencies will be 
granted  direct  access  to the subject’s  original  medical  and study  records  for verification  of the  data and/or 
clinical  trial procedures. Access  to this information  will be permitted  to the aforementioned  individuals  to 
the extent permitted by law.

 A report of the results of this study may be published or sent to the appropriate health authorities in any 
country  in which  the IP may  ultimately  be marketed, but  the subject’s  identity  will not be disclosed  in these 
documents.  
 Documentation  
Source documents may include a  subject’s medical records, hospital  charts, clinic  charts, the  investigator’s 
study  subject  files, as  well as the results of diagnostic  tests such as X-rays, laboratory  tests, and  EKGs. The 
investigator’s copy of the CRFs serves as the investigator’s record of a subject’s study -related data.  
11.4.1  Retention of  Documentation  
All study  related  correspondence, subject records,  consent  forms,  record  of the distribution  and use of all 
IP, and copies of CRFs should be maintained on file for at least two years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications  in an ICH region;  or until  at least two years  have  elapsed  since  the formal  discontinuation  of 
clinical development of the IP. These documents will be retained for a longer period if required by the 
applicable  regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the sponsor. It is the responsibility of the 
sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to  when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
If the  responsible  investigator retires, relocates, or  for other  reasons  withdraws  from  the responsibility  of 
keeping study records, custody must be transferred to a person who will accept the responsibility. The 
sponsor must be notified in writing of the name and address of  the new custodian.  
 
 Labeling,  Packaging,  Storage,  Accountability,  and Return  or Disposal  of 
Investigational Product  
11.5.1  Labeling/Packaging  
The investigational  materials  will be packaged  and labeled  in a manner consistent  with the study  design. 
They will be labelled according to the local regulatory requirements  
11.5.2  Storage  of Investigational  Product  
The IP must  be stored  in a secure  area accessible  only to the investigator and  his/her designees. The  IP will 
be administered only to  subjects  entered into  the clinical study, in  accordance  with the  conditions  specified 
in this protocol.  
11.5.3  Accountability  of Investigational  Product  
The IP is to only be prescribed  by the principal  investigator or his/her  named  sub-invest igator(s), and  is to 
only be used in accordance with this protocol. The IP must only be distributed to subjects properly 
qualified under this protocol to receive IP.  
The investigator must  keep  an accurate  accounting  of the  IP received  from  the sponsor on  the Product 
Accountability Log.  
11.5.4  Return  or Disposal  of Investigational  Product  
All IP will be returned  to the sponsor  at the end of the study.  
 
 Recording of Data on Source Documents and Case Reports Forms (CRFs)  
The investigator is  responsible for ensuring  that study data is  completely and  accurately recorded on  each 
subject’s  CRF,  source  document,  and all study -related  material.  All study  data should also be attributable,

Pilot trial of oral cabozantinib / XL184 in metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer to 
explore the changes in bone and tumor imaging related pathways 
 
 Primary Objective:  
  
To conduct a pilot clinic al trial to evaluate the timing, physiology, and magnitude of changes 
in tumor imaging, and pharmacodynamic markers with XL184 treatment in metastatic 
castrate resistant prostate cancer.   
.  
 Secondary Objectives:  
 
1) To estimate the progression- free survival (PFS) achieved  with XL184 in metastatic 
CRPC patients. 2) To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the therapy, a nd the toxicities associated. 
3) To evaluate OS in chemothera py naïve metastatic CRPC patients 
  
Study Treatment 
XL184 at a starting dose of 60 mg orally daily taken after fasting 2 hours prior and one 
hour after administration. 
 Dose modifications for treatment related severe or intolerable adverse events. 
-1, and -2 Dose levels will be 40 mg and 20 mg respectively.  
Study Assessments 
Pretherapy CT, standard methylene diphosphonate (99mTc-MDP) bone scan, sodium 18F-
fluoride (18F-fluoride) PET bone scan, and FMAU {[2’-18F]-1-(2’-deoxy-2'-fluoro-beta-
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 7D-arabinofuranosyl)thymine} PET scan. Pretherapy bone biopsy and correlative 
pharmacodynamic sample collection (B lood and urine).  The FMAU and 18F-fluoride 
PET scans will be done under separately approved imaging protocols. 
Start XL184, monitor for toxicity every 2 week s for the first 3 months, then once every 4 
weeks.  At 2 -3 weeks post therapy repeat 
18F-flouride PET / FMAU PET scans, bone scans and 
tumor biopsy. The timing of the scan maybe further changed depending on the optimal 
time to detect changes as determined from the first 5 patients enrolled. At 6 weeks, 20 
weeks and then every 12 weeks thereafter until patient continues on cabozantinib,  CT 
and 99Tc-MDP bone scan will be done  to evaluate tumor status.  
The week 4 timepoint scan will be discontinue d for all present and future patients.    
We will also review each patients baseline scan to see if there is disease detectable.  If no 
readily visible cancer is found then the 2nd s can with FMAU PET will be eliminated for 
that patient.  So far of the 6 patients imaging, only patient 1 had no easily visible tumor on the baseline scan. Longer follow up of th e patients has revealed that it remains a 
challenge to determine if the patients are co ntinuing to derive clin ical benefit. The PSA 
level is frequently discordant with res ponse. Hence we will obtain an additional 
18F-
flouride PET scan and a FMAU scan (if the patient had <3 FMAU scans prior) at week 32 (+/- 10 weeks) for the patients continuing on study therapy at that timepoint. For the 
patients who discontinue therapy, prior to the 32 weeks timepoint,, the scan/s will be done at the time of treatment discontinuation (+ /- 2 weeks).  This timepoint was chosen to 
capture the maximum number of patients curren tly on the study for this scan, and since 
conventional CT scan and bone scan is al so conducted at the same timepoint for 
comparison. 
 
 
  Tissue, Blood and Urine collection:   
 Tumor tissue biopsy will be obtained within 2 weeks prior to and within 2-3 weeks post XL184 therapy.  Part of each tissue sample will be fresh-frozen for genomic analysis and 
the rest will be decalcified, fixed and embedded in paraffin for histological and immuhistochemical analyses. Blood and urin e samples will be collected from each 
patient for correlative studies.  For the first 5 patients, samples will be taken at pretherapy, 1, 2 and 4 weeks afte r treatment begins.  Timeline for additional 15 patients 
will be adjusted based on results obtained in  first 5 patients and will be correlated with 
the imaging schedule.  For instance if no change s are seen at a particul ar time point in all

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 85 patients, then that timepoint maybe ex cluded. Blood sample collection will be 
performed using Vacutainer CPT tubes. This  method will generate serum samples for the 
analysis of biochemical mark ers, and mononuclear cells for future analyses of DNA and 
RNA.  All isolated samples will be stored at -80° C until use. 
 
Clinical Monitoring and testing 
 Patients will be monitored for response (m easurable disease, PSA levels, clinical 
response and bone scans) progre ssion, survival and toxicity.

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 131 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
1.1 Hypothesis:  
XL-184 is a cmet inhibitor that results in abrupt clinical chan ges in bone metabolism 
represented as an abrogation of 99mTc-MDP uptake on bone scan. This is likely due to 
inhibition of osteoclast function and decrea se in osteoblast activ ity. We hypothesize that 
XL-184 uniquely targets the cross talk be tween cMet and VEGFR axis, downstream 
cathepsin K driven pathways and novel recet or tyrosine kinases (such as DDR-1 and 
DDR-2) in bone tumor microenvironment. He nce we propose a pilot trial designed to 
study the pathophysiology and genomic changes in bone metastases and correlate these 
with response and clinical outcome data in metastatic CRPC patients treated with XL-184 
therapy. 
1.2 Study Objectives 
The objectives of this study are as follows: 
 Primary Objective:  
  
To conduct a pilot clinical trial to evaluate the timing, pathophysiology, and 
magnitude of changes in tumor imaging and pharmacodynamic markers with XL184 
treatment in metastatic castra te resistant prostate cancer.  
 
.  
 Secondary Objectives:  
 
1) To estimate the progression- free survival (PFS) achieved  with XL184 in metastatic 
CRPC patients.   2) To evaluate the feasibility of the therapy, and the toxicities associated. 
  3) To evaluate OS in metastatic CRPC patients post ADT treated with XL-184. 
 
1.3 Background: Prostate Cancer and Targeted Therapy 
Cancer is a worldwide clinical and econom ic problem. The American Cancer Society 
estimates that there will be nearly 1.5 million cancer diagnoses and 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 14566,000 cancer-related deaths in the United St ates in 2008 (American Cancer Society 
2008). The estimated overall cost of cancer in 2006 (reflecting, for example, clinical 
treatment, lost work time and productivity fo r patients and families, and mortality) was 
$206.3 billion. Conventional approa ches to treating cancer in clude surgery, radiotherapy, 
and cytotoxic chemotherapy as single modalities or as combined therapies. Recently, targeted therapies including antibodies and small molecule inhibitors have also demonstrated clinical benefit. Further studies into the pathways and mechanisms of action of these novel agents will help guide patient selection for future therapies and 
determine resistance mechanisms. 
Bone metastases in prostate cancer are prim arily osteoblastic with evidence of deposition 
of new bone. The increased osteoblastic activity  results in incorpor ation of Tc99-labeled 
methylene-diphosphonate allowing visualization of the lesions on bone scan. Met and its 
ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) have  demonstrated increas ed expression after 
androgen ablation as well as with disease progression to lymph nodes and soft tissue. 
XL184 is a VEGF and c-met inhibitor that has demonstrated promising clinical efficacy 
in metastatic CRPC. Not only did the agent produce 89% aggregate re sponse and stable 
disease rate in measurable disease, but marked improvement of bone scans was noted 
(Smith DC et al. GU ASCO symposium 2011). This is an unusual phenomenon, not seen 
even with any of the other agents that produ ce high levels of anti-tumor efficacy such as 
ADT. The physiologic changes occurring with  the rapid normaliz ation of bone scans 
(within the first 6 weeks) are unknown to date. We propose a pilot trial to study the 
changes occurring in bone metastases and in tumor tissue and to correlate with clinical 
outcome, with XL184 therapy. We hypothesize that XL184 uniquely targets the crosstalk 
between cMet and VEGFR axis, downstream cathepsin K-driven pathways and novel RTKs (e.g., DDR-1, DDR-2) in the bone tumor microenvironment. XL 184 action leads to 
abrupt changes in bone me tabolism and abrogation of 
99mTc-MDP uptake due to the 
inhibition of osteoclast activ ity and subsequent decrease  in osteoblast function.   
1.3.1 Signal Pathways 
The MET receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) (receptor for hepatocy te growth factor [HGF]) 
has been implicated as a mediator in many important aspects of tumor pathobiology, 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 15including tumor survival, growth, angiogenesis,  invasion, and dissemina tion (Sattler et al. 
2004; Jiang et al. 2005), and se veral MET RTKs have been re ported to show activity in 
cell lines and animal models (Sattler et al . 2004). Recently, inhibitors of MET including 
XL880 and ARQ 197 have shown signs of antitumo r activity in Phase 1 studies (Eder et 
al. 2007; Garcia et al. 2007; Ross et al. 2007). The vascular endothelial growth factor 
receptor 2 (VEGFR2 [KDR]) is a central medi ator of tumor angiogenesis, and several 
small molecule and protein therapeutics targe ting this receptor are currently in clinical 
development. Recently, bevacizumab (Avastin®), a monoclonal antibody directed against 
VEGF, has been shown to improve overall  survival (OS) when combined with 
chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colo rectal cancer (Hurwitz  et al. 2004) and in 
lung cancer (Sandler et al. 2005). In addition to their i ndividual roles in tumor 
pathobiology, nonclinical data s uggest that Met and VEGFR2 play synergistic roles in 
promoting tumor angiogenesis and subsequent  dissemination (Bottaro and Liotta 2003).  
Compounds that simultaneously inhibit VEGF  and MET RTKs may be more effective 
anticancer agents than agents that target  each of these receptors individually 
(Pennacchietti et al. 2003). Th e investigational drug in this study, XL184, is a potent 
RTK inhibitor that targets primarily MET and VEGFR2 RTKs. XL184 has activity 
against other RTKs that have been impli cated in tumor pathobiology, including KIT, 
FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), and Tie-2. In addition, XL184 is known to inhibit 
RET, a RTK known to be causative for malignanc y in the setting of hereditary medullary 
thyroid cancer (MTC). 
1.4 XL184 Background 
A summary of XL184 clinical and nonclin ical experience is contained in the 
Investigator’s Brochure supplied by Exelixis (or designee). The Investigator’s Brochure 
should be reviewed in conjuncti on with this study protocol. 
1.4.1 Spectrum of XL184 Activity 
XL184 is a new chemical entity that inhibits multiple RTKs with growth-promoting and 
angiogenic properties. The primary bioche mical targets of XL184 are MET, VEGFR2, 
RET, and KIT (Table 1-1).

XL184 is orally bioavailable as demonstrated  by pharmacokinetic (PK) experiments in 
rodent and nonrodent models. Target modulation studies show  that the administration of 
XL184 in mouse models causes dose-depe ndent inhibition of MET, VEGFR2, a 
mutationally activated form of RET, and mu ltiple mutationally activated forms of KIT. 
Immunohistochemical studies demonstrate rapid effects on the tumor endothelium, 
resulting in breakdown of the vasculature and tumor cell death within 8 hours after 
administration of XL184. These effects transl ate into significant tumor growth inhibition 
after XL184 treatment in multiple  tumor models (Table 1-2). In addition, in all of the 
models examined (human breast cancer, human lung carcinoma, human MTC, and rat 
glioblastoma [GB]), marked tumor regression and excellent tolerability were observed .

Data from pharmacodynamic experiments show  that in vivo XL184 inhibits key RTKs 
that promote tumor cell proliferation and/or angiogenesis (MET , VEGFR2, and RET) 
(Table 1-3). XL184 inhibited RTKs MET in the liver, and xenograft tumors and 
VEGFR2 in lung tissue, with ED 50 (dose required for 50% inhibition of receptor 
phosphorylation) values of 5, 9, and 26 mg/ kg, respectively. Durations of action were 
sustained with > 50% inhi bition 10-24 hours post-dose at a dose level of 100 mg/kg. 
Immunohistochemical evaluations indicated th at XL184 inhibited angiogenesis and cell 
proliferation and stimulated necr osis in tumor tissue in vivo.

a 44% inhibition after 24h, no intermediate timepoint be tween 4h and 24h was tested. 
 
Nonclinical experiments in nude mice demons trated that XL184 crosses the blood-brain-
barrier in healthy animals. Four hours after drug administration at 10 mg/kg, XL184 brain 
exposure was approximately 16% (1.3 µM) of  the XL184 concentration in plasma (8.2 
µM).  
Overall, the data generated in vivo demonstrat e that the target prof ile of XL184 translates 
to potent anti-angiogenic activity and potent antitumor efficacy. The anti-VEGFR2 
activity of XL184, combined with additional gr owth-inhibitory properties mediated by its 
activity against MET, may result in enhan ced antitumor activity in GB. Phase 1 and 2 
clinical data suggest that XL184 has robust clinical activity in several tumor types, 
including MTC and GB.

Brochure supplied by Exelixis (or designee). This documen t should be reviewed in 
conjunction with this  study protocol. 
1.4.2 XL184 Nonclinical Toxicology 
In nonclinical toxicity studies in rodents and nonrodents, histopathological changes 
associated with XL184 administration were obser ved in gastrointestinal (GI) tract, bone 
marrow, lymphoid tissues, kidney, adre nal and reproductiv e tract tissues. 
Histopathological changes present in bone and pancreas were considered secondary to 
XL184 administration. XL184 was negative in in vitro bacterial, in vitro mammalian cell, 
and in vivo mammalian genotoxicity bioassays. In reproductive toxicity studies, XL184 
was embryotoxic in rats, produced fetal soft  tissue changes in ra bbits, and decreased 
fertility in male and female rats. 
Safety pharmacology studies of XL184 admi nistration did not demonstrate adverse 
effects on neurobehavioral or respiratory-system function in rats; furthermore, no 
significant changes in electrocardiographic parameters (including corrected QT [QTc] interval) were observed in telemeterized dogs. 
XL184 was not an inhibitor of cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 3A4 in vitro and is not predicted 
to have significant effects on CYP3A4 induction. XL184 was shown to be  an inhibitor of 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9*3, and CYP2C19 isozymes in  vitro and was also a substrate of 
CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. The mean plas ma protein binding by XL184 in vitro was 
greater than 98%. Additional toxicology information may be found in the Investig ator’s Brochure. 
1.4.3 Clinical Experience (Detailed and current clinical information is available in 
current version of the Investigators brochure) 
1.4.3.1 Clinical Summary 
There are nine ongoing studies for XL184, includ ing four Phase 1 studies, one Phase 1b/2 
study, three Phase 2 studies, and one Phase 3 study. As of 01 June 2010, there have been 
747 subjects enrolled across all nine studi es. The single-agent ma ximum tolerated dose

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 20(MTD) on the once daily (qd) oral (PO) dos ing schedule has been determined to be 
175 mg. Details of all studies may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.4.3.2 Clinical Safety Profile 
The adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) data summarized in the 
following section include those re ported and entered in the c linical database and safety 
database as of 01 June 2010. The clinical studies with XL184 are ongoing, thus the AE 
data from the clinical database do not yet include all SAEs. Data  from double-blinded 
studies are not presented. The severity  of AEs was assessed using the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.  
1.4.3.2.1 Adverse Events 
As of 01 June 2010, more than 561 subjects have been studied in open-la bel clinical trials 
with XL184, including treatment with XL184 as a single agent, as well as XL184 in combination with temozolomide and radia tion therapy, and XL184 in combination with 
erlotinib. The available pooled data in this database include  483 subjects who received 
open-label XL184 in Studies XL184-001, XL184-002, XL184-201, XL184-202, and XL184-203 (lead-in stage only). The most fre quently observed AEs (> 15%), regardless 
of the relationship to XL184, were fatigue, diarrhea, decreased appetite, nausea, constipation, vomiting, dysphonia, hypertensi on, rash, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
increased, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in creased, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia 
(PPE) syndrome, headache, dyspnea, cough, and weight decrease. Some of these events, 
including fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, dysphoni a, hypertension, rash, AST increased, ALT 
increased, and PPE syndrome, resulted in permanent study drug discontinuation,. Effects that may be related to inhibition of VEGF, including hypertension, thromboembolic 
events, GI perforation and hemorrhage, w ound dehiscence, and proteinuria, have been 
observed in clinical studies with XL184.  
1.4.3.2.2 Serious Adverse Events 
Of the 561 subjects enrolled in open-label clinical trials with XL184, 223 subjects (40%) 
experienced one or more SAEs recorded in the Argus safety database, and 95 subjects 
experienced one or more SAEs that were as sessed to be related to treatment with XL184.

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 21The most commonly reported SAEs assessed as drug related were pulmonary embolism 
(PE) (in 14 subjects), di arrhea (in nine subjects), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (in seven 
subjects), nausea (in seven s ubjects), hypertension (in five  subjects), th rombocytopenia 
(in five subjects), dehydration (i n four subjects), vomiting (i n four subjects), abdominal 
pain (in three subjects), and perirectal absc ess (in three subjects). In addition, one late-
breaking case of reve rsible posterior leukoencephal opathy syndrome (RPLS) was 
reported after the data cut-off in the d ouble-blind placebo-controlled Study XL184-301. 
Fifty-two deaths were reported within 30 days of the last dos e of study drug; the majority 
was due to disease progression, and five deat hs were assessed to be related to XL184. 
They were the result of GI hemorrhage (in on e subject), PE (in two subjects), respiratory 
failure (in one subject), and he moptysis (in one subject).  
Detailed information regarding the safety pr ofile of XL184 from a ll studies may be found 
in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.4.3.3 Clinical Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic analysis showed dose pr oportional increases in maximum plasma 
concentration (C max) and area under the plasma concen trationtime curve (AUC) both for 
the powder-in-bottle (PIB) formulation (dose range: 0.08 to 11.52 mg/kg) and the capsule 
formulation (dose range: 125 to 175 mg). Terminal-phase half-life (t 1/2, z) values were 
59.1 to 136 hours. More detailed information regarding XL184 PK from all studies and 
product metabolism in humans may be f ound in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.4.3.4 Clinical Activity 
Preliminary clinical activity data ar e available for Studies XL184-001, XL184-201, 
XL184-202, and XL184-203.  Eighty-five subjects with a dvanced solid tumors were en rolled in the XL184-001 study. 
Of the 85 subjects, 18 subjects experienced a tumor shrinkage of ≥ 30%, including 
17 (49%) of 35 subjects with MTC with measur able disease. In the response evaluable 
subset of subjects with MTC,  10 (29%) of 35 subjects had confirmed partial responses 
(cPRs). In addition, 15 subjects with MTC had stable disease (SD) for at least 6 months. 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 22In Study XL184-201, 196 subjects with relapsed GB have been enrolled. At the dose of 
125 mg qd, cPRs were observed in 11 of 37 (30%) subjects who had not received prior 
anti-angiogenic therapy, with a median durati on of response of 5.1 m onths (range, 0.9+ to 
6.7+). In subjects who had not received prio r anti-angiogenic ther apy, the 6-month PFS 
rate (PFS6) assessed by Kaplan-Meier estimate was 25%, with a 30% ra te of censoring at 
the time of analysis. The median PFS wa s 16.0 and 7.9 weeks for anti-angiogenic naïve 
and anti-angiogenic pretreated subjects, re spectively. At the dose of 175 mg qd, cPRs 
were observed in 7 of 34 (21%) subjects w ithout prior anti-angi ogenic therapy, with a 
median duration of response of 2.9 months  (range,1.9 to12.8). In subjects who had not 
received prior anti-angiogeni c therapy, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of  PFS6 was 10%. 
The median PFS was 15.9 and 14.3 weeks for anti-angiogenic naïve and anti-angiogenic 
pretreated subjects, respectively.  
In Study XL184-202, 65 subjects with non-sma ll-cell lung cancer (N SCLC) have been 
enrolled. As of 01 June 2010, the MTD of the combination of XL184 and erlotinib in the 
Phase 1 portion has not been determined. To date, 8 of 53 evaluable subjects treated in 
Phase 1 have experienced a ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of tumor measurements as 
compared to baseline measurements. Confirme d partial response was achieved in 4 of 53 
(8%) evaluable subjects. 
In Study XL184-203, 198 subjects with advanced solid tumors have been enrolled. Six 
subjects achieved a cPR dur ing the 12-week open-label lead-in stage, two with 
hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], two with  NSCLC, one with melanoma, one with 
prostate cancer). Of the 105 evaluable subj ects (with minimum 12 weeks of follow-up), 
43 achieved SD (11 with melanoma, eight with NSCLC, five with panc reatic cancer, five 
with prostate cancer, five with HCC, four with gastric/ gastroes ophageal junction [GEJ] 
adenocarcinoma, four with ovarian cancer, a nd one with small-cell lung cancer [SCLC]). 
The overall disease control ra tes (partial response [PR] + SD) at Week 12 were 88% in 
the HCC cohort, 86% in the ovarian cancer c ohort, 67% in the pros tate cancer cohort, 
50% in the melanoma cohort, and 50% in the NSCLC cohort.

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 23Genotyping data in the XL184-001 study suggest  the absence of a correlation between 
RET mutations and either clin ical response or time on study. In an ongoing analysis in 
the XL184-201 study, genotyping analysis of several genomic alterations frequently 
found in GB revealed that none appear to confer resistance to XL184. 
Data from subjects enrolled in ongoing clinical studies de monstrated statistically 
significant changes in plasma biomarkers such as sMET and sKIT. Analysis of serial hair 
and/or skin samples revealed substantia l inhibition of the phosphorylation of XL184 
targets such as MET, RET, and KIT, as well as of downstream signaling molecules AKT 
and ERK, following administration of XL184. 1.5 RATIONALE 
Presence of disease progression by PSA, cl inical symptoms, or on scans, despite 
androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT), signals the onset of cas tration resistant prostate 
cancer (CRPC). At this stage, the expected median survival is 18-20 months, despite 
treatment with docetaxel ba sed chemotherapy (Petrylak et  al. N Engl J Med 2004 and 
Tannock et al. N Engl J Med 2004). Although  novel therapies are showing promising 
efficacy, this disease remains incurable, a nd development of novel therapies that are 
likely to induce complete remissions is impor tant. Also avoiding the side effects of 
chemotherapy is a worthy goal in the patient population with prostate  cancer, that is 
frequently elderly or with significant comorbidities (Oh W et al. Urology 2006 and 
Berthold DR et al. J Clin Oncol 2005). Give n the limited life expectancy and the 
significant morbidity of metastatic prostate cancer (MPC), the development of novel 
therapies to improve outcomes is an “unmet n eed”. We propose to conduct a pilot trial in 
the metastatic CRPC patient population to ex plore the bone effects and tumor tissue 
effects of XL184. As this is a pilot study with  exploratory endpoints,  and prior treatment 
with standard of therapy is allowed, a single arm study design is reasonable. 
 Bone metastases in prostate cancer are prim arily osteoblastic with evidence of deposition 
of new bone. The increased osteoblastic activity  results in incorpor ation of Tc99-labeled 
methylene-diphosphonate allowing visualization of the lesions on bone scan. Met and its 
ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) have  demonstrated increased expression after 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 24androgen ablation as well as with disease progression to lymph nodes and soft tissue. 
XL184 is a VEGF and c-met inhibitor that ha s demonstrated promising clinical efficacy 
in metastatic CRPC. Not only does the ag ent produce promising response rates in 
measurable disease, but a marked change in  bone scans is noted (Smith D. et al. ASCO 
GU Symposium 2011 Abstract #127). This is an unusual phenomenon, not seen even 
with any of the other ag ents that produce high le vels of anti-tumor efficacy such as ADT. 
The physiologic changes occurri ng with the rapid normalizati on of bone scans (within the 
first 6 weeks) are unknown to date. We propose a pilot trial to study the changes 
occurring in bone metastases and in tumor tissue and to correl ate with clinical outcome, 
with XL184 therapy. We hypothesize that XL184 uniquely targets the crosstalk between cMet/VEGFR2 axis, downstream cathepsin K- driven pathways a nd novel RTKs (e.g., 
DDR-1, DDR-2) in the bone tumor microenvi ronment. XL184 action leads to abrupt 
changes in bone metabolism and abrogation of 
99mTc-MDP uptake due to the inhibition of 
osteoclast activity and subsequent decrease in osteobl ast function.   
 Proposed Model for XL 184 Mechanism of Action in Prostate Cancer 
  
 
        
    
Proposed Mechanism of Action of XL 184 in Prostate Cancer.  
XL184 predominantly targets RTKs involved in tumor-induced bone resorption. Inhibition of osteoclast activity by XL184 resu lts in reduced levels of the key osteoclast 
collagenase CTSK and overall inhibition of bone turnover. Inhibition of DDR-1, and -2 
directly by XL184 and indirectly by reduced availability of resorbed collagen abrogates collagen-induced osteoblast di fferentiation and woven bone depos ition.  Abbreviations:

Imaging Studies  
99mTc-MDP bone scan is a most widely use d, standard of care method for evaluating 
skeletal metastases of prostate cancer.  The 99mTc-MDP accumulates in new (woven) 
bone and is an indicator of ch anges in bone metabolism associated with prostate cancer-
induced osteoblastic response. However, 99mTc-MDP scan findings are not specific in 
determining the cause of increased or decr eased uptake and are indirect markers of 
response to treatment [Schoder H,  et al. Semin Nucl Med 2004]. 18F-flouride PET scans 
have improved anatomic detail over 99mTc-MDP scans, a higher accuracy in detecting 
both osteolytic and osteoblastic metastases and allow quantification of the extent of 
metastatic lesion [Shreve PD et al. Radi ology 1996].  This imaging modality may be 
superior to 18F-FDG PET for pr ostate cancer, since the bone metastases in prostate 
cancer are primary osteoblastic. Osteoblastic me tastases tend to exhibit a high rate of 
fluoride incorporation (Schoder H, et al. Semin Nuc Med 2004) and may have low FDG 
uptake (Shreve PD et al. radiology 1996). Additionally, 18F-flouride PET has improved 
sensitivity and specificity when compared to standard 99mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy, and 
importantly, PET offers the ability for rigor ous quantification.(Heicappell R et al. Eur 
Urol 1999, Yeh SD, et al. Nuc Me d Biol 1996 and Schirrmeister H, et al. J Clin Oncol 
1999). It is currently being evaluated in association with other therapeutic trials in prostate cancer (American Co llege of Radiology Network, A CRIN Trial # 6687) to detect 
pharmacodynamic effects of novel agents. We will utilize the 
18F-flouride PET in this 
study to trace the absorption of fluoride ion by bone tissue and quantify bone response. 
 PET obtained with the thymidine analog 
18F-FMAU scan then be used to image tumor 
metabolism and it is based on incorporati on of the tracer by mitochondrial thymidine 
kinase 2 (TK2) [Shields EF, et al. J Nucl  Med 1998 and Tehtani OS, et al. Eur J Nucl 
Med Mol Imaging 2008].  The three modalities complement each other in distinguishing bone changes vs. tumor response to XL184. Distribution of 
18F-FMAU is useful in 
measuring cellular metabolism. Measuremen ts of metabolism made during or after 
therapy would be far more sensitive measur es of anti tumor effects than the more

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 26conventional approach of observing the tumo r for changes in size or just detecting 
location of the bone tu rnover as seen with 99mTc-MDP conventional bone scans. A 
decrease in mean SUV by 20% is considered  a PET response and will be used as the 
threshold to detect changes. We have prev iously reported on the use of FMAU scans for 
detection of prostate cancer bone metastases  from a study conducted at our institution 
[Sun H et al. Eur J Nucl Med Mol Im aging 2005].  We will utilize the18F-FMAU PET to 
detect and quantify changes in tumor metabolism due to incorporation by mitochondrial 
thymidine kinase.   This study will utilize standard of care 
99mTc-MDP bone scan, high resolution 18F-
flouride PET to measure effects of XL184 treatment on bone tissue, and 18F-FMAU PET 
to measure changes in tumor metabolism in response to therapy. Imaging will be 
performed using a gamma camera and PET/CT scanners. 99mTc-MDP bone scans, 18F-
flouride PET and 18F-FMAU PET is already approve d for NOMIC-funded study (C-
2335, Shields, AF; PI). We propose evaluating patients with 18F-flouride imaging pre and 
post XL184 therapy to determine the optim al timing when bone scan normalization 
occurs. So approximately 5 patients will be evaluated with 18F-flouride imaging pre and 
within 2-3 weeks post XL184. Then we will de termine the optimal timepoint to perform 
imaging with FMAU PET scans to evaluate for anti tumor effect, as well as the possible osteoclast and osteoblast inhi bition resulting from the me dication, and the mechanisms 
underlying it.   Serum, Urine and tumor Tissue Correlates  XL184 uniquely targets osteoclast-driven even ts in the bone tumo r microenvironment 
that ultimately affect osteoblast differentia tion and new bone formation. Gene expression 
profiling analyses will validat e novel molecular signatures  with therapeutic potential 
identified by gene expression analysis. We propose to perform aCGH (array comparative 
genomic hybridization), expr ession profiling of human bone biopsy samples to determine 
molecular signatures prior to a nd in response to XL184 treatment.

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 27This study will generate precious bone biops y samples from bone lesions identified by 
imaging. These samples offer unique opportun ity for analysis of changes in gene 
expression profiles in response to treatment.  Particularly, imaging-guided assessment of 
early bone/tumor responses can potentially lead  to identification of novel targets that 
distinguish responsive lesions fr om ones that progress.    
 
We will also examine the effects of XL184 tr eatment on bone turnover and tumor growth 
and survival via histological , immunohistochemical and seru m bone marker analyses in 
human bone biopsy samples. We will utilize established protocols and procedures for 
aCGH, expression profiling, as well as hi stological and serum marker analyses. 
Performing aCGH will allow us to identify genetic translocation such as TMPRSS2-
ERG.   In addition, archival tissue will be  collected and c-met a nd VEGF expression will 
be evaluated pre and post therapy. Pre and post therapy CTC counts and phenotype will 
be tested. Post therapy biopsies will be obtained for checking for VEGF and c-met expression, and pre and post therapy serum and urine bone markers to assess bone 
turnover will be examined.  Baseline tu mor tissue will be evaluated for oncogene 
mutations and correlated w ith response and clinical ou tcome. Although there are no 
common point mutations in oncogenes, we  have the capability (such as the 
pyrosequencer and sequenom) to perform mu tational assays on any gene discovered in 
the future.  
 
The clinical response and outcome will be correlated with changes noted in tumor 
imaging and tissue changes to explore the pathwa ys influencing antitumor efficacy of this 
novel agent.   Based on prior clinical tr ial enrollment, about 40% of  the patient population is 
expected to be of African American ancestry. This will enable evaluation of XL184 effects in a population where it has not been systematically studie d. Given the likely 
differences in prostate cancer disease c ourse and biology, and associated comorbidities 
such as hypertension, this experience would broaden the safety and efficacy data regarding XL184.

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 281.3.1 Rationale for Cabozantinib Dose Selection 
A cabozantinib starting dose of 100 mg daily  has been studied in 171 CRPC subjects 
enrolled to the Phase 2 XL184-203 RDT. Desp ite relatively high rates of cabozantinib 
dose reductions to the next lowest dose of 60 mg daily within the first 12 weeks of 
therapy (51%), this starting dose resulted in high rates of pain relief, bone scan 
improvement, and overall disease control.  
Preliminary data from a separate and ongoi ng dose-ranging study looking at lower doses 
of cabozantinib in CRPC coupled with results from a retrosp ective review of the Phase 2 
XL184-203 RDT indicate that lower doses be low 100 mg daily are likely to retain 
efficacy while improving upon tolerability: 
Preliminary results from an ongoing dose -ranging study: To date, 9 subjects with 
metastatic CRPC enrolled to the first cohort (starting dose of 40 mg qd) are evaluable for 
bone scan response. All 9 subjects exhibit evidence of response on bone scan including 
two complete responses. Although most subjec ts did not have pain at baseline, one 
subject reported pain at baseline which resolved by Week 6. No dose reductions or 
interruptions have been re ported to date, although one subject discontinued study 
treatment for fatigue that was present at  baseline and another subject discontinued 
because of a pathologic fracture. This provides preliminary evidence that lower doses are 
pharmacologically active in a patient  population with advanced CRPC.  
 
Retrospective review of Phase 2 XL184- 203 RDT: While the overall rate of dose 
reduction from 100 mg to 60 mg was 51%, only 14% required an additional reduction in 
dose from 60 mg to the next lowest dose of 40 mg, which is consistent with an overall 
improvement in tolerability profile at the 60-mg dose level. The majority (69%) of 
subjects with pain at baseline who experienced early dose reduction (before Week 6) to 
60 mg went on to report pain improvement at  Week 6. Moreover, 80%  of these subjects 
remained progression-free and continued to re port pain relief at the Week 12 time point. 
Thus the dose of 60 mg qd appears to offer improved tolerability while maintaining efficacy in a patient population with advanced CRPC and cancer-related pain at baseline.  
 
Further analysis of the timing of AEs that led to dose reductions or interruptions was 
conducted. The median time to first AE trigge ring a dose reduction or interruption at 100 
mg qd was 29 days, with very few subjects expe riencing significant toxicity in the first 2 
weeks of study treatment. 
 As such this study will adopt a starting cabo zantinib dose of 60 mg qd. The goal of this 
regimen is to improve the overall tolerability  of cabozantinib while maintaining efficacy 
in this patient population.

2.1 STUDY DESIGN  
2.1.1 Overview of Study Design 
The study consists of open label daily, oral administration of XL184 or cabozantinib at a 
starting dose of 60mg to  eligible patients.  
Administration  
 Subjects will be provided with a sufficient supply of study treatment and instructions for 
taking the study treatment on days without sche duled clinic visits. After fasting (with 
exception of water) for 2 hours, subjects will take study treatment da ily with a full glass 
of water (minimum of 8 oz/ 240 mL) and con tinue to fast for 1 hour after each dose of 
study treatment. Subjects should record dos ing time and doses taken in a study drug 
dosing diary while on study treatment. If doses  are withheld, the original schedule of 
assessments should be maintained when XL184 is restarted. The subject should be 
instructed to not make up the missed doses and to maintain the planned dosing schedule. 
Subjects must be instructed to not make up missed doses that are vomited.  
This study consists of the following: (1 ) a Study Treatment Period consisting of 
continued treatment with XL184, a nd (2) a Post-Treatment Period.  
 2.1.2 Study Treatment Period  
The Study Treatment Period will consist of continued treatment during which time 
subjects will receive XL184 until either disease progression or the occurrence of 
unacceptable drug-related toxicity. Subjects will be assessed for safety at least every 2 
 weeks for the first 3 months and then at le ast every 4 weeks thereafter.  Adverse events 
will be collected throughout the study and reco rded in the subject’s clinical records  
Subjects’ tumors will be objectively assessed by PET scans and CT scans and bone scans. 
The purpose of these assessments is to allow the investigator to determine if the subject is   
benefiting from XL184 and to explore the mechanisms of changes occurring in bone and

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 321. Lytes include lytes, BUN and creatinine assessment. Fasting glucose should be 
measured. 
2. Labs include: Amylase, lipase, Albumin, alkaline phosphatase, tota l bilirubin, calcium, 
chloride, magnesium, γ -GT, LDH, inorganic phosphorus , total protein, SGOT, SGPT. If 
the total bilirubin concentration is in creased above 1.5 times the upper normal limit 
(UNL), total bilirubin should be differentiated into the di rect and indirect reacting 
bilirubin. 3. ECG assessments prestudy, once every 4 weeks through week 12 and then every 8 
weeks beyond week 12.  
4. CXR is required pretherapy unless pulmonary  metastases are noted. If pulmonary 
metastases, then chest CT is needed at baseline and for subsequent tumor assessment. If CT chest is done pretherapy, then CXR is not needed  
5. All tumor evaluation/measurement scans must be within 42 days prior to treatment. CT 
abdomen /pelvis is required for pretreatme nt and subsequent tumor assessments. 
6. FMAU scans are done under a separate protocol and patients will have to sign consent 
for those studies separately. Repeat bone s cans and PET scans will be done during week 
2 on first 5 patients and the schedule w ill be re–evaluated based on findings. 
18F-flouride 
PET scans should preferably be done before th e bone scan in week 2. At week 32+/- 10 
weeks or at the time of discontinuing study th erapyif this occurs prior to week 32, a 18F-
flouride PET scan will be done. A FMAU scan w ill also be done at the same time period 
if patient has had <3 FMAU scans in his lifetime. 7. The schedule for FMAU PET will also be determined based on the timeline of changes observed in bone scans and PET s cans in the first 5 patients. 
8.  CTC samples will be drawn at pretherapy, week 2 (post therapy) and at progression. 
9. PD samples and bone markers ; blood samples and urine will be collected per schedule; pretherapy day 8 (week 1), day 15 (week 2) and day 29 (week 4). For bone 
markers, 4cc of blood should be collected in a tiger top tube and the urine NTx requires a 
24 hour urine collection. 10. End of treatment and follow up within 4 weeks of discontinuing therapy: End of treatment visit- EKG, urine analysis a nd CBC, multiphasic and PSA. Repeat tumor

time of discontinuing study therapy if this occurs prior to week 32, a 18F-flouride PET 
scan and /or FMAU scan (only if patient has had <3 FMAU scans in his lifetime) will be 
done. All study bottles and diaries will be collected and submitte d.  Patients will be followed 
for a maximum of 5 years after end of treatment. Follow up will be for survival, progression and next li ne of therapy.  
 
2.1.3 Post-Treatment Period 
Subjects will return to the study site to complete end-of-study assessments 4 weeks 
(± 2 week) after their last dose of XL184. Patients will be followed for progression free 
survival and overall survival. 
2.4 Treatment Assignment  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to assign a subject number prior to treating each 
subject with XL184. 2.5 Study Sites 
This study will be conducted at Karm anos Cancer Center, Detroit MI. 
2.6 Withdrawals 
Subjects may discontinue study treatment or withdraw their consent to participate in the 
study at any time without prejud ice. The investigator may withdraw a subject from study 
treatment or from the study if, in  his or her clinical judgment, it is in the best interest of 
the subject or if the subject ca nnot comply with the protocol.  
In addition, any of the following conditions re quire withdrawal of the subject from study 
treatment: 
 An AE or intercurrent illness that in th e opinion of the investigator warrants the 
subject’s withdrawal from treatment 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 34 Necessity for treatment with other investigational drug or other anticancer 
medications prohibited by protocol 
 Participation in another clinical study using an investigational agent 
 Request by regulatory agencies for terminati on of treatment of an individual subject 
or all subjects under this protocol 
 Sexually active subjects who refuse to us e medically accepted barrier methods of 
contraception (eg, male condom, or diaphr agm with spermicidal gel) during the 
course of the study and for  3 months following discontinuation of study treatment. 
 Inability to tolerate XL184 
 XL184 treatment delays > 3 weeks 
 Progressive disease (PD) as de termined by the investigator.  
 
The reason for study treatment discontinua tion will be documented. For subjects who 
discontinue or are withdrawn from study trea tment, every effort must be made to 
undertake protocol-specified follow-up procedur es and end-of-treatment assessments, if 
possible, unless consent to participat e in the study is also withdrawn. 
If a subject fails to return fo r the protocol-defined visits, an effort must be made to 
determine the reason. If the subject cannot be reached by telephone, at the minimum a 
registered letter should be sent  to the subject (or the subjec t’s legal guardi an) requesting 
contact with the clinic. 
If a subject is discontinued from study treatm ent because of an AE considered to be 
related to study treatment and the event is ongoing 30 days after the last dose of study 
treatment, the event must be followed until resolution or determination by the 
investigator that the event has become stable or irreversible. 
If a subject withdraws consent to participate in the st udy, the reason for withdrawal will 
be documented, no study procedures or asse ssments will be performed, and no further 
study data will be collected for this subject, other than the determination of survival status from public records such as gove rnment vital statistics or obituaries.

of water (minimum of 8 oz/ 240 mL) and con tinue to fast for 1 hour after each dose of 
study treatment. Subjects should record dos ing time and doses taken in a study drug 
dosing diary while on study treatment. If doses  are withheld, the original schedule of 
assessments should be maintained when XL184 is restarted. The subject should be 
instructed to not make up the missed doses and to maintain the planned dosing schedule. 
Subjects must be instructed to not make up missed doses that are vomited.  
2.7.2General Guidelines for Treatment Delay, Dose Reduction, or Study Drug 
Discontinuation for Toxicity 
Subjects will be monitored continuously for AEs throughout the study and for 30 days 
after the last dose of study treatment, and fo r any serious adverse ev ent (SAE) assessed as 
related to study treatment or study procedures, ev en if the SAE occurs more than 30 days 
after the last dose of study treatment. 
Subjects will be instructed to notify thei r physician immediately of any and all AEs.  
Subjects experiencing one or more AEs due to the study treatment may require a dosing 
delay or reduction(s) in their dose in order to continue with study treatment.  
Re-escalating study treatment after a dose reduction: 
 Subjects who required a dose reduction for Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity 
should not be re-escalated 
 For other related AEs, subjects may be re -escalated to the previous dose at the 
discretion of the investigator but not sooner than 2 w eeks beyond the resolution to 
Grade ≤ 1 or to the baseline value of AEs. 
 If a subject has been dose-re duced more than once, dose re-escalation can only occur 
to the next higher dose level. Further dos e escalation to highe r well-tolerated dose 
levels is allowed only if c linically indicated per investigator’s judgment and dose 
escalation criteria are met w ith each escalation (e.g. a minimum 2 week interval 
between escalations)  
 If the AEs that previously led to dose reduction(s) recu r upon re-escalation, the dose 
should be reduced again and no furthe r dose escalation will be permitted.  
 Dose re-escalation is not allowed for dose reduction triggered by neutropenia or 
thrombocytopenia.  
 
Discontinuation from study treatment: 
 If the subject does not recover from hi s or her toxicities to tolerable Grade ≤ 2 within 
3 weeks, the subject will have study treatment discontinued unless there is

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 38unequivocal evidence that the subject is benefitting.  In this s ituation, a subject may 
be able to restart therapy with a dose reduction upon resolutio n of the toxicity. 
. 
 The minimum dose of study treatment will be 20 mg daily. Subjects who cannot 
tolerate 20 mg daily dose, will ha ve study treatment discontinued. 
 
Additional information for dose delays or dose reductions: 
 Dose delays for reason(s) other than AEs related to cabozantinib, such as surgical 
procedures with no anticancer  therapy intent, may be al lowed with investigator 
approval. The acceptable length of interruption will be determined by the 
investigator. 
 
2.8 Warnings, Precautions, and Management of Anticipated Adverse Events 
The general adverse event profile of cabozanti nib includes GI symptoms (such as nausea, 
vomiting, and diarrhea), fatigue, anorexia, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) 
syndrome, skin rash, elevated ALT and AST, increased pancreatic enzymes with rare cases of  pancreatitis, as well as side effects associated w ith inhibition of VEGF signaling 
such as thrombotic events (eg, pulmonary embolism [PE] and deep vein thrombosis 
[DVT]), hypertension, proteinuria,  hemorrhagic events, and rare cases of gast rointestinal 
[GI] perforation and rectal/p erirectal abscess. Arterial thromboembolism (transient 
ischemic attack [TIA], myocardial infarc tion [MI]) have been reported rarely.   
2.9 Management of Adverse Events 
In the absence of an unacceptable cabozantinib- related toxicity and/or clinical signs of 
disease progression, subjects may continue treatment at the discretion of the investigator. 
Subjects must be instructed to notify th eir physician immediately for any and all 
toxicities. 
Guidelines for the management of AEs (ie,  dose interruptions a nd dose reductions) are 
presented in the next sections. Each dose re duction of cabozantinib s hould be to one dose 
level lower that the current dose.  Dose reductions of more than one dose level are 
acceptable if agreed to by the Investigator. If  study treatment of cabozantinib is restarted 
after being withheld or interrupted, the subj ect should be instructed not to make up the 
missed doses of cabozantinib.  
The reason for treatment delay and reduced dos e must be recorded on the case report 
form (CRF). 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 39Dosing may need to be interrupted for AEs cons idered not related to cabozantinib if this 
is clinically indicated or if causality is  initially uncertain. Study treatment may be 
resumed at the same dose (or a lower dose pe r investigator judgment) if the AE is 
determined not to be related to cabozantinib once the investigator determines that 
retreatment is clinically appropriate and th e subject meets the protocol re-treatment 
criteria. 
2.10 General Guidelines for Non-Hematol ogic and Hematologic Adverse Events 
General guidelines for the management of non-hematologic and hematologic toxicities 
are provided in Table 3-2 and Table 3-3, re spectively. As a general approach, it is 
suggested that all AEs be managed with s upportive care when possible at the earliest 
signs of toxicity. For more specific guide lines on gastrointestinal AEs (diarrhea, 
nausea/vomiting, stomatitis/mucositis), hepato biliary disorders, pancreatic disorders 
including lipase and amylase elevations, skin  disorders (PPE), embolism and thrombus, 
hypertension, proteinurea, hemorrhage, rectal and perirectal absce ss, gastrointestinal 
perforation and gastrointestinal fistula,  wound healing and surgery, and endocrine 
disorders, refer to Section 3.4.1.2 – Section 3.4.1.13 below.  Guidance for the 
management of fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, non-gastrointestinal fistula, osteonecrosis 
of the jaw, eye disorders, musculoskeleta l and connective tissue disorders, nervous 
system disorders, respiratory/thoracic/medias tinal disorders and congenital, familial and 
genetic disorders can be found in the Investigators Brochure.

Hematologic Toxicities 
CTCAE Version 4 Grade  Guidelines/Intervention 
Grade 1: Add supportive care as indicated.  Continue study treatment at the 
current dose levels. 
Grade 2: 
Grade 2 AEs considered related to 
study treatment that are subjectively tolerable or easily managed Add supportive care as indicated.  Continue study treatment at the 
current dose levels.  
Grade 2 AEs considered related to study treatment that are intolerable to the subject or deemed unacceptable in the investigator’s 
judgment; or are not easily managed 
or corrected Dose reduce 
 If the AE dose not resolve to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline in 7 to 10 
days or worsens at any time, cabozantinib dosing should then be interrupted.  Then upon resolution to baseline or Grade ≤ 1, 
the reduced dose should be restarted. 
 If the AE does resolves to resolves to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline 
without a dose interruption, continue the reduced dose. 
Grade 3:  
Grade 3 AEs considered related to study treatment which occurred without optimal prophylaxis or 
which is easily managed by medical 
intervention or resolved quickly  Interrupt study treatment and add supportive care as indicated 
 For AEs that are easily mana ged (e.g., correction of 
electrolytes) with resolution to baseline or Grade ≤ 1 within 24 
hours,  treatment may be resumed at either the same dose or 
with a dose reduction at the discretion of the investigator 
unless this is a recurring event at which time the dose should be reduced 
 For AEs that require supportive car e, the dose should be held 
while supportive care is initiated and optimized.  Then upon resolution of the AE to baseline or Grade ≤  1, treatment 
should be restarted with a dose reduction.  Note: if the 
investigator believes the likelih ood of a reoccurrence of the 
same Grade 3 AE is small due to continued prophylaxis or 
other effective intervention, treatment may be resumed 
without a dose reduction and with very careful monitoring of 
the subject.   
Grade 3 AEs considered related to study treatment that occurred despite 
optimal prophylaxis or is not easily 
managed by medical intervention  Interrupt study treatment until recovery to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline, 
and resume treatment with a dose reduction 
Grade 4:  
Grade 4 AEs considered related to study treatment Permanently discontinue study treatment unless determined that the subject is unequivocally deriving clinical benefit.  In this case, upon 
recovery to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline, the subject may be re-treated at a 
reduced dose that is to be determined by the investigator.

2.11.1Diarrhea, Nausea, Vomiting,  Stomatitis, and Mucositis 
Diarrhea 
Subjects should be instructed to notify thei r physician immediately at the first signs of 
poorly formed or loose stool or an in creased frequency of bowel movements. 
Administration of antidiarrheal agents is re commended at the first sign of diarrhea as 
initial management. Loperamide is recommended as standard first line therapy. 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 43Alternatively, diphenoxylate/atropine can be used. Additional agents to consider in 
subjects with diarrhea that is refractory to the above includ e deodorized tincture of opium 
and octreotide (Benson et al. 2004). Some subjects may requi re concomitant therapy with 
loperamide, diphenoxylate/atropine , and deodorized tincture of opium to control diarrhea. 
When combination therapy with antidiarrheal agents does not contro l the diarrhea to 
tolerable levels, a dose reduction and/or dos e interruption of cabozantinib should be 
implemented as described.  In addition, general supportive meas ures should be 
implemented including continuous oral hydration, correction of fluid and electrolyte 
abnormalities, small frequent meals, and stopping lactose-containing products, high fat meals and alcohol.  
Nausea and Vomiting 
Anti-emetic agents along with supportive care are recommended as clinically appropriate 
at the first sign of nausea and vomiting.  A dose reductions and/or dose interruption of 
cabozantinib may be required as described in Table if antiemetic treatment and/or 
prophylaxis alone is not adequate.  Agents classified as having a high therapeutic  index (such as 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, 
or NK-1 receptor antagonists) per ASCO or MASCC/ESMO guidelines for anti-emetics 
in oncology or dexamethasone are reco mmended (Hesketh et al. 2008, ASCO 2006; 
Roila et al, Annals of Oncology, 2010). Ca ution is recommended with the use of 
aprepitant or fosaprepitant and nabilone as  cabozantinib exposure may be affected by 
concomitant administration because aprepitant  and fosaprepitant are both inhibitors and 
inducers of CYP3A4, and nabilone is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4. 
Stomatitis and Mucositis 
Preventive measures may include a comprehe nsive dental examination to identify any 
potential complications before study treatment is initiated. Appropriate correction of local 
factors should be instituted as indicated, su ch as modification of ill-fitting dentures and 
appropriate care of gingivitis. During treatm ent with cabozantinib, good oral hygiene and 
standard local treatments such as non-trau matic cleansing, and oral rinses (eg, with a 
weak solution of salt and baking soda) should be maintained. The oral cavity should be 
rinsed and wiped after meals, and dentures  should be cleaned and brushed often to 
remove plaque. Local treatment should be inst ituted at the earliest onset of symptoms.

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 44When stomatitis interferes with adequate nutrition and local thera py is not adequately 
effective, dose reduction or te mporary withholding of cabozan tinib should be considered. 
2.11.2 Hepatobiliary Disorders 
Elevations of transaminases have also been  observed during treatment with cabozantinib. 
In general, it is recommended that subjects w ith elevation of ALT, AST, and/or bilirubin 
have more frequent laboratory monitoring of these parameters. If possible, hepatotoxic 
concomitant medications and alcohol should be discontinued in s ubjects who develop 
elevated transaminases.  
Since subjects may enter the study with elevat ions of AST/ALT at baseline, the following 
guideline should be used for dose modifications:

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 46Cabozantinib treatment should also be inte rrupted when transaminase increases are 
accompanied by progressive elevations of total bilirubin, and/or elevations of coagulation 
tests (eg, International Normalized Ratio [INR]). Monitoring of transaminases should be intensified (2–3 times per week) and cabozanti nib should be held until the etiology of the 
abnormalities is determined and these abnormalities  are corrected or stab ilize at clinically 
acceptable levels (INR < 1.5  ULN, total bilirubin < 1.5  ULN, aminotransferases < 2.5 
 ULN or baseline).  
Subjects must have cabozantinib permanently discontinued if transaminase elevations are 
accompanied by evidence of impaired hepatic function (bilirubin elevation >2xULN), in the absence of evidence of biliary obstruction (i.e., significant elevation of alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) or some other explanation of the injury (e.g., viral hepatitis, alcohol hepatitis), as the combined finding (i.e., Hy’s Law cases) represents a signal of a potential for the drug to cause severe liver injury.
 
All subjects who develop isolated bilirubin  elevations of Grade 3 should have study 
treatment held until recovered to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline (or lower). If this occurs within 6 
weeks of the dosing delay, study treatment may continue at a reduced dose. In subjects 
without biliary obstruction and Grade 4 bilir ubin elevation, or with recurrence of Grade 3 
bilirubin elevation after a dose reduction, study treatme nt must be discontinued.   
2.11.3 Pancreatic Conditions 
Amylase and lipase elevations have been obser ved in clinical studies with cabozantinib. 
The clinical significance of asymptomatic elevations of enzymes is not know but in 
general have not been associated with clini cally apparent sequelae. It is recommended 
that subjects with lipase elevation and/or sy mptoms of pancreatitis have more frequent 
laboratory monitoring of lipase and/or amylas e (2-3 times per week). Subjects with 
symptomatic pancreatitis should be treat ed with standard supportive measures.

Grade 3  Interrupt treatment 
 Monitor lipase and amylase twice weekly 
 Upon resolution to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline, cabozantinib may be 
restarted at the same dose or at a reduced dose provided that this 
occurs within 6 weeks. 
 If retreatment following Grade 3 lipase or amylase elevation is at 
the same dose and Grade 3 elevations  recur, then treatment must be 
interrupted again and till lipase and amylase  levels have resolved to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline and retreatment must be at a reduced dose. 
Grade 4  Interrupt treatment 
 Monitor lipase and amylase twice weekly 
 Upon resolution to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline and if resolution occurred 
within 4 days, cabozantinib may be restarted at the same dose or a reduced dose.  If resolution took more than 4 days, the dose must be 
reduced upon retreatment provided that resolution occurred within 6 
weeks. 
 If retreatment following Grade 4 lipase or amylase elevation is at 
the same dose and Grade 3 or 4 el evations recur, then treatment 
must be interrupted again until lipase and amylase have resolved to 
Grade ≤ 1 or baseline and retreatment must be at a reduced dose. 
Symptomatic Pancreatitis 
Pancreatitis 
Grade 1  Continue at current dose level.  More frequent monitoring of lipase and amylase and radiographically  is recommended 
Grade 2  Interrupt treatment 
 Monitor lipase and amylase twice weekly 
 Upon resolution to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline , cabozantinib may be 
restarted at the same dose or at a reduced dose provided that this 
occurs within 6 weeks. 
 If retreatment following Grade 2 pancreatitis is at the same dose and Grade 2 pancreatitis recurs, then treatment must be interrupted again and till resolution to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline and retreatment 
must be at a reduced dose. 
Grade 3  Interrupt treatment 
 Monitor lipase and amylase twice weekly 
 Upon resolution to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline , cabozantinib may be 
restarted at a reduced dose if resolution occurred within 6 weeks 
Grade 4 Permanently discontinue treatme nt.  However, if the subject was 
unequivocally deriving benefit from cabozantinib therapy, treatment may 
resume at a reduced dose per investigator judgment.

2.11.4 Skin Disorders 
Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPE; also known as hand-foot syndrome), 
skin rash (including blister, erythematous ra sh, macular rash, skin exfoliation, dermatitis 
acneiform, and papular rash), pruritus, dry skin, erythema, pigmentary changes, and 
alopecia have been reported with cabozantini b. All subjects on study should be advised 
on prophylactic measures including the use of emollients, removal of  calluses, avoidance 
of exposure of hands and feet to hot wate r leading to vasodila tation, protection of 
pressure-sensitive areas of hands and feet, and use of cotton gloves and socks to prevent injury and keep the palms and soles dry. 
The onset of PPE is variable with paraesthesia (tingling, numbness) being the 
characteristic initial manifestation, which can be accompanied by slight redness or mild 
hyperkeratosis. PPE advances with symmetrical painful erythema and swollen areas (edema) on the palms and soles. The lateral si des of the fingers or periungual zones may 
also be affected. Adequate interventions are required to preven t worsening of skin 
symptoms such as blisters, desquamations, ul cerations, or necrosis of affected areas. 
Aggressive management of symptoms is  recommended, including early dermatology 
referral. Subjects with skin di sorders should be carefully mon itored for signs of infection 
(eg, abscess, celluli tis, or impetigo). 
In the case of study treatment-related skin changes (eg, rash, hand-foot syndrome), the investigator may request that  additional assessments be conducted with the subject’s 
consent. These assessments may include digita l photographs of the skin changes and/or a 
biopsy of the affected skin and may be repeated until the skin changes resolve.

Subjects should be instructed to notify investigator immediately if severity 
worsens.  If severity worsens at any tim e or if there is no improvement after 
2 weeks, proceed to the management guidelines for Grade 2 PPE 
Grade 2 Reduce study treatment to next lower level and/or interrupt dosing. 
Start/continue urea 20% cream twi ce daily AND clobetasol 0.05% cream 
once daily. Pain control with NSAIDs/GABA agonists/narcotics. Assess subject at least weekly for changes in severity.  Subjects should be instructed 
to notify investigator immediately if seve rity worsens.  If severity worsens at 
any time (eg, peeling, blisters, bleeding, edema, or hyperkeratosis or affects self-care) or if there is no improv ement after 2 weeks, proceed to the 
management guidelines for Grade 3 PPE.  If the dose was reduced, then upon resolution to Grade 0 or Grade 1, treatment may continue at the reduced dose.  If the dose was only interrupted but not reduced, then 
treatment may be restarted at one dose level lower. 
Grade 3 Interrupt study treatment until se verity decreases to Grade 1 or 0.  
Start/continue urea 20% cream twi ce daily AND clobetasol 0.05% cream 
once daily. Pain control with NSAIDs/GABA agonists/narcotics.  Treatment may restart at one dose level lower when  reaction decreases to Grade 1 or 0. 
Permanently discontinue subject from study if reactions worsen or do not 
improve within 6 weeks.

2.11.5 Embolism and Thrombosis  
In clinical studies with cabozantinib, venous thrombotic events (DVT and PE) have been 
observed in less than 10% of s ubjects, and arterial thromboe mbolic events (MI and TIA) 
have been reported rarely. In addition, subjects with  cancer have a significantly increased 
likelihood of developing thromboembolic complications (Agnelli et al, 2009).  
Subjects who develop a PE and/or DVT shoul d have study treatment interrupted until full 
anticoagulation is established with low mo lecular weight heparin (LMWH)  (Full 
anticoagulation with warfarin is not permitted) . Venous filters (e.g. vena cava filters) are 
not recommended due to the high incidence of co mplications associated with their use.  
Once a subject is fully anticoagulated, trea tment can be restarted per investigator 
judgment at one dose lower.  Subjects s hould permanently discontinue after a second 
thrombotic event. Although routine prophylactic  anticoagulation is not necessary for all

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 50subjects, prophylactic an ticoagulation is allowed for indi vidual subjects at the discretion 
of the investigator. 
Cabozantinib should be disconti nued in subjects who develop an acute MI or any other 
clinically significant arterial thromboembolic complication. 
2.11.6 Hypertension 
Hypertension is a relatively common complication of other VEGF-pathway inhibitors and 
has been observed in cabo zantinib clinical studies. 
Decisions to decrease or hold the dose of study treatment must  be based on BP readings 
taken by a medical professional and must be  confirmed with a second measurement at 
least 5 minutes following the first measurem ent. Other than for hypertension requiring 
immediate therapy, the presence of new or worsened hypertension should be confirmed at 
a second visit before taking new therapeutic action. Blood pressure should be monitored 
in a constant position visit to visit, either sitting or supi ne. Cabozantinib dosing should be 
interrupted in subjects with severe hypert ension (180 mm Hg systolic or 120 mm Hg 
diastolic; or sustained ≥ 160 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 110 diastolic) who cannot be controlled 
with medical interventions and discontinued in subjects with hypertensive crises or 
hypertensive encephalopathy.

existing medications and/or add new antihypertensive 
medications)  
 Maintain dose of cabozantinib 
 If optimal antihypertensive therapy (usually to include 3 agents) does not result in blood pressure < 140 systolic

 Increase antihypertension therapy  (i.e., increase dose of 
existing medications and/or add new antihypertensive 
medications)  
 Monitor subject closely for hypotension. 
 If optimal antihypertensive therapy (usually to include 
3 agents) does not result in blood pressure < 140 systolic 
or < 90 diastolic, dose of cabozantinib should be reduced further. 
≥ 180 mm Hg (systolic) OR 
≥ 120 mm Hg (diastolic )  Interrupt treatment with cabozantinib Add new or additional anti-hypertensive medications and/or increase 
dose of existing medications. 
 Monitor subject closely for hypotension. 
 When SBP < 140 and DBP < 90, restart cabozantinib 
treatment at  one dose level lower 
 If optimal antihypertensive therapy (usually to include 3 agents) does not result in blood pressure < 140 systolic 
or < 90 diastolic, dose of cabozantinib should be reduced 
further.

2.11.7 Proteinuria 
Proteinuria has been reported with approved dr ugs that inhibit VEGF pathways as well as 
with cabozantinib. Development and worseni ng of proteinuria should be monitored by 
serial urinalysis (qualitative/semiquantit ative assessment by dipstick; quantitative 
assessment by urine protein/urine creatinin e ratio [UPCR], or 24-hour urine protein 
excretion). When a UPCR exceeds 1 (mg/dL pr otein / mg/dL creatinine), a repeat UPCR 
or a 24-hour urine protein and creatinine s hould be performed to confirm the result. 
Cabozantinib should be discontinued in s ubjects who develop nephrotic syndrome

cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, and edema) or any other relevant renal 
disease. Also, given the nephr otoxic potential of bisphosphon ates, these agents should be 
used with caution in patients receiving treatment with cabozantinib. Details of 
management are described in Table below: 
Management of Treatment Emergent Proteinuria 
 Urine Protein/Creatinine Ratio Action To Be Taken 
≤ 1  No change in treatment or monitoring 
> 1 and < 3.5 
  Confirm with a 24 hour urine pr otein excretion within 7 days 
 If proteinuria of > 1 g/24 hours is confirmed, hold 
cabozantinib and continue with UPCR monitoring. When 
UPCR returns to < 1, restart cabozantinib at a reduced dose. Continue monitoring UPCR once every week until two 
consecutive readings are < 1, then revert to UPCR 
monitoring frequency specified in the protocol. 
≥ 3.5 
  Hold cabozantinib immediately and confirm with 24 hour urine protein excretion.  
 Evaluate for nephrotic syndrome. If present, discontinue 
cabozantinib treatment permanently, and monitor subject for 
resolution of nephrotic syndrome.  
 If proteinuria of ≥ 3.5 g/24 hours is confirmed without 
diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome, continue to hold 
cabozantinib and monitor UPCR weekly. If UPCR decreases 
to < 1, restart cabozantinib at a reduced dose.  Continue 
monitoring UPCR once every week until two consecutive 
readings are < 1, then revert to UPCR monitoring frequency 
specified in the protocol.

2.11.8 Hemorrhage 
Hemorrhagic events have been reported with  approved drugs that i nhibit VEGF pathways 
as well as with cabozantinib. As preventive measures, subjects should be evaluated for 
potential bleeding risk factors prior to initiating cabozantinib treatment and monitored for 
bleeding events with serial complete bl ood counts and physical examination while on 
study. Risk factors for hemorrhagic events may include (but may not be limited to) the 
following: 
 Tumor lesions of the lung with cavitations or tumor lesions which invade, encase, or 
abut any major blood vessels; non-small ce ll lung cancer (NSCLC) with squamous 
cell differentiation is known for significan t lung cavitations a nd centrally located 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 53tumors that may invade major blood vessels. The anatomic location and 
characteristics of tumor as well as the medical  history should be carefully reviewed in 
the selection of subjects for treatment with cabozantinib. 
 Recent or concurrent radiati on to the thoracic cavity  
 Active peptic ulcer disease, ulcerative co litis, and other inflammatory GI diseases 
 Underlying medical conditions which affect normal hemostasis (eg, deficiencies in 
clotting factors and/or platelet  function, or thrombocytopenia) 
 Concomitant medication with anticoagulan ts or other drugs which affect normal 
hemostasis 
 
Based on the described predisposing risk f actors for hemoptysis, many studies with 
antiangiogenic drugs exclude subjects with NSCLC and squamous cell differentiation. 
Although enrollment of subject s with NSCLC with squamous cell differentiation has 
been allowed on cabozantinib studies, cabozanti nib studies exclude NSCLC subjects with 
any of the following: tumors abutting, encasing, or invading a major blood vessel; 
cavitating lesions; history of clinically significant hemoptysis; or recent (within 
3 months) radiation therapy to the thor acic cavity including brachytherapy unless 
radiation therapy targets bone metastasis. 
Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subj ects with serious and life-threatening 
bleeding events or recent hemoptysis ( ≥ ½ tablespoon of red blood). Treatment with 
cabozantinib should be interrupted if less severe forms of clinically significant 
hemorrhage occur and may be restarted after th e cause of hemorrhage has been identified 
and the risk of bleeding has subsided. Th erapy of bleeding events should include 
supportive care and standard  medical interventions.  
Furthermore, subjects who develop tumors abutting, encasing, or invading a major blood 
vessel or who develop cavitation of their pulmonary tumors while on study treatment 
must be discontinued from cabozantinib treatment. 
2.11.9 Rectal and Perirectal Abscess 
Rectal and perirectal abscesses have been  reported, sometimes in subjects with 
concurrent diarrhea. These should be treate d with appropriate lo cal care and antibiotic 
therapy. Cabozantinib should be held until adequate healing has taken place. 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 542.11.10Gastrointestinal perfor ation and GI fistula  
Gastrointestinal perforation and GI fistula have been report ed with approved drugs that 
inhibit VEGF pathways as well as with cabozantinib. To allow for early diagnosis, 
subjects should be monitored for episodes of  abdominal pain, especially if known risk 
factors for developing GI perforation or fistula (Turnage et al. 2008) are present. Such 
risk factors include (but may not be limited to) the following: 
 Intra-abdominal tumor/metast ases invading GI mucosa  
 Active peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory  bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, 
diverticulitis, cholecystitis or symptomatic cholangitis, or appendicitis  
 History of abdominal fistula,  GI perforation, bowel obstr uction, or intra-abdominal 
abscess 
 Prior GI surgery (particularly when associat ed with delayed or incomplete healing) 
  
Complete healing following abdominal surgery or resolution of intr a-abdominal abscess 
must be confirmed prior to initia ting treatment with cabozantinib.  
Additional risk factors include concurrent use of steroid treatment or non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (Rodriguez et al . 2001, Straube et al. 2009). Constipation, 
consistent with symptoms of bowel obstr uction, should be monitored and effectively 
managed. Discontinue cabozantinib and initiate  appropriate management in subjects who 
have been diagnosed with GI perforation or fistula.  
2.11.12 Wound healing and Surgery 
VEGF inhibitors can cause wound healing complications and wound dehiscence which 
may occur even long after a wound has been co nsidered healed. Therefore, surgical and 
traumatic wounds must have completely heal ed prior to starting cabozantinib treatment 
and be monitored for wound dehiscence or w ound infection while th e subject is being 
treated with cabozantinib.  
Treatment with cabozantinib must be inte rrupted for any wound healing complication 
which needs medical intervention. Treatment  with cabozantinib can be resumed once 
wound healing has occurred unless otherwis e prohibited in specific protocols. 
Cabozantinib should be disconti nued in subjects with seri ous or chronic wound healing 
complications.

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 55The appropriate dose hold interval prior to elective surgery to re duce the risk for wound 
healing complications has not been determ ined. In general, cabozantinib should be 
stopped at least 3 weeks (5 half liv es) prior to elec tive surgery.  
2.11.13 Endocrine Disorders 
Prospective studies of markers of thyroid f unctions are currently ongoing in two single-
agent studies to characterize the effects of  cabozantinib on thyroi d function. Preliminary 
data indicate that cabozantinib affects thyroid function tests (TFTs) in a high number of 
subjects. In Study XL184-203, 17 of 34 (50 %) euthyroid subjects with castration-
resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC) developed abnormal t hyroid-stimulating hormone 
(TSH) levels 6 weeks after in itiation of cabozantinib treatment (6% showed TSH levels 
between 5 and 7 mU/L, 44% had TSH > 7 mU/L ). The median TSH level at week 6 was 
5.2 mU/L (range, 0.02-29.7 mU/L). In a Phase 1 combination study  of rosiglitazone and 
cabozantinib (XL184-008) to determine the pote ntial for a clinically  significant drug-drug 
interaction of cabozantinib on the CYP isoz yme CYP2C8, subjects with advanced solid 
tumors (particularly renal cel l carcinoma [RCC] and differen tiated thyroid cancer [DTC]) 
are enrolled. Among 11 evaluabl e subjects, the AE of hypot hyroidism was reported in 
55% of subjects. Currently available data ar e insufficient to determine the cause of TFT 
alterations and its clinical relevance. Routine monitoring of thyroid function and 
assessments for signs and symptoms associated with thyroid dysfunction is recommended for subjects treated with cabozantinib.  Management of thyroid dysfunction 
(eg, symptomatic hypothyroidism) should follow accepted clinical practice guidelines. 
Other endocrine disorders such as hypocalcemia and hyperglycemia, and associated 
laboratory changes, have been observed in less than 10% of subjects. Monitoring with 
standard laboratory tests for endocrine di sorders and clinical examination prior to 
initiation and during treatment with cabozan tinib is recommended. Cabozantinib should 
be discontinued in subjects with severe or life-threatening en docrine dysfunction. 
2.11.14  Guidelines for Management of Treatment-Emergent Corrected QT (QTc) 
Prolongation 
In preclinical studies, high doses of cabo zantinib (up to 1000 mg/kg) in dogs had no 
effect on electrocardiographic parameters, including QT and QTc intervals. However, the 
current clinical safety profile of cabozantin ib indicates a mild to moderate prolongation 
effect upon QT and QTc interval s at clinically relevant e xposures. Other factors which 
may contribute to QTc prolongation include 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 56 Treatment with other drugs associated with QTc prolongation (see 
http://www.qtdrugs.org) 
 Treatment with CyP3A4 inhibitors (whi ch may increase cabozantinib drug levels) 
 Electrolyte changes (hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia) 
 Medical conditions which can  alter electrolyte status  e.g., severe or prolonged 
diarrhea 
 
Subjects having any of these additional risk  factors while on cabozantinib should have 
ECGs performed approximately one week  after the onset of these factors. 
A very recent analysis of ECG data fr om the XL184-301 study, An International, 
Randomized, Double-Blinded, Phase 3 Effi cacy Study of XL184 versus Placebo in 
Subjects with Unresectable, Locally Advance d, or Metastatic Medul lary Thyroid Cancer 
,in which 214 subjects were randomized to cabozantinib and 109 subj ects randomized to 
placebo, demonstrates a mild to moderate prolongation of the QTcF in cabozantinib-
treated subjects vs placebo-treated subjects. A lthough subjects were treated with a higher 
dose in that study, we believe it is appropriate to monitor patients for QTc prolongation.  
No subject had a QTcF greater that 500 msec.   
If at any time on study there is an increas e in QTc interval to an absolute value > 500 
msec, two additional ECGs should be performed within 30 minutes after the initial ECG 
with intervals not less than 3 minutes apart.  If the average QTcF fr om the three ECGs is 
> 500 msec, study treatment must be withheld and the following actions should be taken: 
 Check electrolytes, especially potas sium, magnesium and calcium. Correct 
abnormalities as clinically indicated 
 If possible, discontinue any QTc- prolonging concomitant medications  
 Repeat ECG triplets hourly until the average QTcF is ≤ 500 msec or otherwise 
determined by consultation with a cardiologist 
Subjects with QTc prolongation and symptoms must be monitored closely until the QTc 
elevation has resolved. Cardiology consul tation is recommended for evaluation and 
subject management. Symptomatic subjects must be treated according to standard clinical 
practice. No additional study treatment is to be  given to the subject until after the event 
has resolved and the subject  has been thoroughly evaluate d. If any additional study 
treatment is given (eg, after correction of electro lyte abnormalities and normalization of 
QTcF), it will be at a reduced dose per protocol dose levels. 
 
2.12 Concomitant Medications and Therapies 
2.12.1 Anticancer Therapy 
If a subject requires additiona l systemic anticancer treatment , including steroid treatment 
for prostate cancer therapy, study treatment mu st be discontinued. Local intervention is 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 57discouraged unless medically unavoidable.  Subjects receiving  local intervention 
(eg, palliative radiation) are allowed to c ontinue to receive study treatment at the 
investigator’s discretion. Subjects with prostate cancer currently receiving luteinizing 
hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) 
agonists may be maintained on these agents. 
2.12.2 Other Medications 
Subjects must be instructed to inform the inve stigators of the current or planned use or all 
other medications during the study (including prescription medications, vitamins, herbal 
and nutritional supplements, and over-the-counter medications).  It is the responsibility of 
the investigator to ensure that details regarding all medications are documented. 
Anti-emetics and anti-diarrheal medications s hould not be administered prophylactically 
prior to the first dose of cabozantinib. Af ter the first dose of st udy treatment, at the 
discretion of the investigator  or after the onset of symptoms, treatment (or prophylaxis) 
with anti-emetic and anti-diarrheal medications  may be undertaken per standard clinical 
practice. Bisphosphonates are allo wed if started prior to screening activities or may be 
initiated during the course of the study to control bone pain. 
Colony stimulating factors (eg, erythropoi etin and granulocyte colony-stimulating 
factors) and pain medications administered as dictated by standard practice are acceptable 
while the subject is en rolled in the study. However, colony stimulating factors should not 
be administered prophylactically prior to  the first dose of study treatment.  
No concurrent investigational agents are permitted. 
2.12.3 Potential Drug Interactions 
Cytochrome P450: Preliminary data from a clinical drug inter action study (Study XL184-
008) show that clinically relevant steady-stat e concentrations of ca bozantinib appear to 
have no marked effect on the AUC of co -administered rosiglitazone, a CYP2C8 
substrate. Therefore, cabozantinib is not anticipated to markedly inhibit CYP2C8 in the 
clinic, and by inference, is not anticipated  to markedly inhibit other CYP450 isozymes 
that have lower [I]/Ki values compared to CYP2C8 (ie, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, 
CYP1A2, and CYP3A4). In vitr o data indicate that cabozan tinib is unlikely to induce 
cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for possible induction of CYP1A1 at high cabozantinib concentrations (30 μM).  
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 58Cabozantinib is a CYP3A4 substrate (but not  a CYP2C9 or CYP2D6 substrate), based on 
data from in vitro studies using CYP- isozyme specific neutralizing antibodies. 
Preliminary results from a clinical pharmacology study, XL184-006, showed that 
concurrent administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, 
resulted in an approximately 80% reduction in cabozantinib exposur e (AUC values) after 
a single dose of cabozantinib in healthy volunteers. Co-adm inistration of cabozantinib 
with strong inducers of the CYP3A4 family (eg, dexamethasone, phenytoin, 
carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapenti n, phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort) may 
significantly decrease cabozantinib concentrations. The ch ronic use of strong CYP3A4 
inducers should be avoided. Other drugs th at induce CYP3A4 should be used with 
caution because these drugs have the poten tial to decrease exposure (AUC) to 
cabozantinib. Selection of alternate conc omitant medications with no or minimal 
CYP3A4 enzyme induction potential is recomm ended. In addition, caution must be used 
when discontinuing treatment with a strong CY P3A4 inducer in a subject who has been 
concurrently receiving a stable  dose of cabozantinib, as this could significantly increase 
the exposure to cabozantinib.  
Preliminary results from a clinical pharmacology study, XL184-007, showed that 
concurrent administration of cabozantinib  with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, 
ketoconazole, resulted in a 33-39% increase  in the cabozantinib exposure (AUC values) 
after a single dose of cabozantinib in healthy volunteers. Co -administration of 
cabozantinib with strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (eg, ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, clarithromycin, in dinavir, nefazodone, nelf inavir, and ritonavir) may 
increase cabozantinib concentrations. Grapef ruit / grapefruit juice and Seville oranges 
may also increase plasma concentrations of  cabozantinib. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and 
other drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 should be used with caution because these drugs have 
the potential to increase exposure (AUC) to  cabozantinib. Selection of alternate 
concomitant medications with no or minima l CYP3A4 enzyme inhibition potential is 
recommended.  
Because in vitro studies only assessed the metabolizing capacity of the CYP3A4, 
CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 pathways, the potenti al for drugs that inhibit/induce other 
CYP450 pathways (eg, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CY P2B6, CYP1A2) to alter cabozantinib 
exposure is not known. Therefore, these drugs  should be used with caution when given 
with cabozantinib.  
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 59Please refer to the Flockhart drug interaction ta bles for lists of subs trates, inducers, and 
inhibitors of selected CYP450 isozyme pathways (Flockhart 2007; 
http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx).  
Protein Binding: Cabozantinib is highly protein bound (approximately 99.9%) to human 
plasma proteins. Therefore, highly protein bound drugs should be used with caution with 
cabozantinib because there is a potential displ acement interaction that could increase free 
concentrations of cabozantinib and/or a co-a dministered highly protein-bound drug (and a 
corresponding increase in pharmacologic effect ). Factors that influence plasma protein 
binding may affect individual tolerance to  cabozantinib. Therefore, concomitant 
medications that are highly protein bound (eg, diazepam, furosemide, dicloxacillin, and 
propranolol) should be used with caution. Because warfarin is a highly protein bound 
drug with a low therapeutic inde x, administration of warfarin at therapeutic doses should 
be avoided in subjects recei ving cabozantinib due to the po tential for a protein binding 
displacement interaction.  
Other Interactions: A relative bioavailability study in dogs suggests that cabozantinib is 
unlikely to be affected by drugs that alte r gastric pH. In vitro data suggest that 
cabozantinib is unlikely to be a substrate for P glycoprotein (P-gp), but it does appear to 
have the potential to inhibit the P-gp transport activity.

Brochure 
2.13 Compliance 
Drug accountability and subject compliance w ill be assessed with drug dispensing and 
return records.  
2.14 Study Drug Accountability 
The investigator will maintain accurate records of receipt of all cabozantinib, including 
dates of receipt. In addition, accurate records will be kept regarding when and how much 
study treatment is dispensed and used by each subject in the study. Reasons for deviation 
from the expected dispensing regimen must al so be recorded. At completion of the study, 
to satisfy regulatory requirements regarding drug accountability, all unused cabozantinib will be reconciled and destroyed in accord ance with applicable state and federal 
regulations.

4 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 
4.1 Pre-Treatment Period 
During the Pre-Treatment Period, subjects are co nsented and qualified (screened) for the 
study. Informed consent must be obtained befo re initiation of any clinical screening 
procedure that is performed solely for the purpose of determining eligibility for this 
study. Evaluations performed as part of routine care before informed consent can be 
considered as screening eval uations if done within the de fined screening period, and if 
permitted by the site’s institutional review board (IRB)/ ethics committee (EC) policies. Informed consent may be obtained within 42 da ys prior to first dose of study treatment. 
At informed consent, subjects will be assigned a subject identifier. Subject identifiers are 
not to be re-assigned if a subject is determined to be ineligible, and subjects are to maintain their original identifier if rescreening is required. 
For each subject, the Pre-Treatment Period ends  upon receipt of the first dose of study 
treatment or final determination that th e subject is ineligible for the study. 
4.2 Study Treatment Period  
Subjects are defined as enrolled upon rece ipt of the first dose of study treatment.  
If the subject is unable to have a study a ssessment taken within the defined time window 
due to an event outside of his or her cont rol (eg, clinic closure, personal emergency, 
inclement weather, vacation), the assessment s hould be performed as close as possible to 
the required schedule.  Subjects should be instructed to inform the PI of any AEs. Subjects experiencing 
dizziness, sleepiness, or other symptoms that  could influence aler tness or coordination 
should be advised not to drive or  operate other heavy machinery. 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 66Subjects may receive study treatment until the earlier of PD or unacceptable toxicity. 
Regular tumor assessments should be performed according to the guidelines in 
Section 4.5 to determine if PD is present.  
The Treatment Period ends when a subject receives his or her last dose of study 
treatment; the subject then enters the Post-Treatment Period . 
 The week 4 timepoint scan will be discontinue d for all present and future patients.    
We will also review each patients baseline scan to see if there is disease detectable.  If no 
readily visible cancer is found then the 2nd s can with FMAU PET will be eliminated for 
that patient.  So far of the 6 patients imaging, only patient 1 had no easily visible tumor 
on the baseline scan. Longer follow up of th e patients has revealed that it remains a 
challenge to determine if the patients are co ntinuing to derive clin ical benefit. The PSA 
level is frequently discordant with res ponse. Hence we will obtain an additional 18F-
flouride PET scan and a FMAU PET scan (if <3 lifetime FMAU scans done on the patient)  at week 32 (+/- 10 weeks) For the patients who discontinue therapy. prior to the 
32 weeks timepoint, the scan will be done at the time of treatment discontinuation (+/- 2 
weeks).  This timepoint was chosen to captu re the maximum number of patients currently 
on the study for this scan, and since conve ntional CT scan and bone scan is also 
conducted at the same timepoint for comparison.  
4.3 Post-Treatment Period 
Subjects will return to the study site 4 weeks (± 2 weeks) afte r the last dose of XL184 for 
an end-of-treatment assessment. Laborat ory and physical examinations will be 
performed. Remaining study treatment will be returned by the subject, and treatment 
compliance will be documented. Additional fo llow-up will occur for subjects with AEs 
related to study treatment that are ongoing at the time of this visit, and for subjects with 
SAEs related to study treatment that occur after the time of this visit. 
4.4 Laboratory Assessments 
Local laboratories will perfor m all laboratory tests. Blood and urine samples for standard 
hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis panels will be prepared using standard 
procedures.  
Abnormalities in clinical laborat ory tests that lead to a change in subject management 
(eg, dose delayed, withheld, or reduced; additional medication or monitoring required) or 
that are considered to be clinically signifi cant by the investigator are to be recorded on 
the AE case report form (CRF). If laboratory valu es constitute part of  an event that meets 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 67criteria for an SAE, the event (and associated  laboratory values) must be reported as an 
SAE (Section 5.1.2). 
4.5 Tumor Assessment 
4.5.1 Routine Tumor Assessment 
Tumor response should be assessed per the study schedule and until the medication is 
continuing to show benefit, (complete response [CR], PR, or SD) may continue on study. Subjects with disease progression should have their treatment di scontinued, and they 
should enter the post treatment phase of the study. The same method for tumor assessment should be employe d at every assessment.  
 
4.6 Response criteria:  
For measurable disease response RECIST criteri a 1.1 will be used [Eisenhauer E, et al. Eur 
J Cancer 2009]. The Prostate Cancer Clinical  Trials Working Group (PCWG2) criteria will 
be used to determine a response [Scher H, et al. J Clin Oncol 2008]. PCWG2 recommends 
a two-objective paradigm in metastatic CRPC:  (1) controlling, relieving, or eliminating 
disease manifestations that are present when treatment is initiated and (2) preventing or 
delaying disease manifestations expected to occur. PSA decline and changes in imaging will also be reported. The progression for measurable disease will be per RECIST criteria, 
and for bone metastases will be  defined as given below:  
4.6.1 THE RECIST 1.1 CRITERIA WITH  UNIDIMENSIONAL MEASUREMENT 
ARE TO BE USED FOR MEASURABLE DISEASE RESPONSE EVALUATION 
 Methods of Assessment 
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified  and reported  lesion at baseline and during follow-
up.CT is the best currently available a nd reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations 
(e.g., for body scans but not for lung).Lesions  on a chest X-ray may be considered 
measurable lesions if they are clear ly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. 
However, CT is preferable. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and ≥10 mm in diameter as assessed using calip ers. For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 68lesion, is recommended.Ultr asound (US) should not be used to measure tumor 
lesions. 
 
 Baseline Disease Assessment 
All baseline evaluations s hould be performed as clos ely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 42 days before the beginning of the treatment. Measurable lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurem ent is to be recorded) with a minimum 
size of: • 10 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thic kness no greater than  5 mm; when CT 
scans have slice thickness >5 mm, the minimum size should be twice the slice 
thickness). • 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as nonmeasurable). 
• 20 mm by chest X-ray. • Malignant lymph nodes: To be cons idered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT 
scan (CT scan slice thickness is recomme nded to be no greater than 5 mm). At 
baseline and in follow-up, only the shor t axis will be measured and followed. 
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic  lesions with identifiable soft tissue  
components that can be evaluated by cross-sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI 
can be considered measurable if the soft  tissue component meets the definition of 
measurability described above. • ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cy stic metastases can be considered 
measurable if they meet the definiti on of measurability  described above. 
However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions.  
Non-measurable lesions 
Non-measurable lesions are all other lesions, including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathol ogical lymph nodes with 10 to <15 mm short axis), as 
well as truly non-measurable lesions.  • Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable. • Lesions with prior local treatment, such  as those situated in a previously 
irradiated area or in an area subjected to other loco-regional therapy, are usually 
not considered measurable unless there ha s been demonstrated progression in the 
lesion.  
Target Lesions 
• All measurable lesions up to a maximu m of two lesions per organ and five 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, shoul d be identified as target 
lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. 
• Target lesions should be selected on th e basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter) and be representative of  all involved organs, as well as their

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 69• All measurements should be recorded in metric notation using calipers if 
clinically assessed. A sum of the diamet ers (longest for non-nodal lesions, short 
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions 
Non-target Lesions 
All lesions (or sites of disease) not id entified as target lesions, including 
pathological lymph nodes and all non-measurab le lesions, should be identified as 
non-target lesions and be reco rded at baseline. Measurem ents of these lesions are 
not required and they should be followed as  ‘present’, ‘absent’ or in rare cases, 
‘unequivocal progression’. 
 
Evaluation of target lesions 
Complete Response (CR): 
Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target 
or non-target) must have reducti on in short axis to <10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of di ameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline  sum of diameters. 
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of di ameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study (this may include the baseline sum). The sum must also demonstrate an absolu te increase of at least 5 mm. 
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for 
PD.  
Confirmation 
In non-randomized trials where response is the primary endpoint, confirmation of 
PR and CR is required to ensure responses identified are not the result of 
measurement error. This will also permit appropriate interpretation of results in the context of historical data wh ere response has traditionally required 
confirmation in such trials. However, in all other circumstances, (i.e., in randomized phase II or III trials or 
studies where stable disease or pr ogression are the primary endpoints), 
confirmation of response is not required since it will not add value to the interpretation of trial results. However, elimination of the requirement for response confirmation may increase the impor tance of central review to protect 
against bias, in particular in studies which are not blinded. 
In the case of SD, measurements must have  met the SD criteria at least once after 
study entry at a minimum interval (in gene ral not less than 6 –8 weeks) that is 
defined in the study protocol. 
 
4.6.2 Progression in patients with bone metastases 
Majority of the patients with prostate cancer have bone metastases which are not 
considered measurable sites of disease. Progression in patients with bone metastases will

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 70be defined as either the appearance of a mi nimum of 2 new lesions on bone scan which are 
related to metastatic disease per the judgement of the treating physician,  or the occurrence 
of a new skeletal relate d event. Skeletal-related event is defined as occurrence of new 
pathologic bone fractures (vertebral or nonvertebral), spin al cord compression, requirement 
of surgery or radiation therapy to bone metastases  (including the use of radioisotopes), or a 
requirement to change antineoplastic therapy to  treat bone pain or other related symptoms.  
 
4.6.3 Response Evaluable Patients All patients registered on the protocol and completing a minimum of 7 days of therapy 
followed by clinical, or radiologic or  PSA assessment of disease status. 
 4.6.4 Toxicity- Evaluable patients All patients registered on the protocol and st arting therapy with prot ocol medication, will 
be considered toxicity evaluable.  4.6.5 Progression-free survival (PFS)  PFS will be measured from date of registration to date of first documented disease progression, or death from any cause, whiche ver occurs first.   After treatment is 
discontinued for any reason patients will be followed every 3 months for progression and 
survival.  4.6.6 Overall survival (OS) OS will be measured from date of registration to death or last follow up.   After treatment 
is discontinued for any reason patients will be followed every 3 months for progression and survival.

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 715 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING AND SAFETY 
5.1 Adverse Events and Laboratory Abnormalities 
5.1.1 Adverse Events  
Toxicity will be graded per CTCAE ve rsion 4.0. An AE is any untoward medical 
occurrence in a patient or clinical investigati on subject who has been en rolled in a clinical 
study and who may have been given an inves tigational product, rega rdless of whether or 
not the event is assesse d as related to the study treatmen t. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended si gn (including an abnormal labor atory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally associated with the us e of an investigationa l product, regardless of 
whether or not the event is a ssessed as related to the inves tigational product.  Pre-existing 
medical conditions that worsen during a st udy should be recorded as AEs. Abnormal 
laboratory values, electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, or vital signs are to be recorded as 
AEs if they meet the criteria described in Section 5.2.1. 
All untoward events that occur after start of thera py through 30 days after the last dose of 
study treatment are to be record ed by the investigational si te. This requirement includes 
AEs from unscheduled as well as scheduled visits. Assessment of the relationship of the AE to the study treatm ent by the investigator is 
based on the following two definitions: 
 Not Related: A not-related AE is defined as an AE that is not associated with the 
study treatment and is attri butable to another cause. 
 Related: A related AE is defined as an  AE where a causal relationship between 
the event and the study treatment is a r easonable possibility. A reasonable causal 
relationship is meant to convey that there are facts (eg, evidence such as 
dechallenge/ rechallenge) or other clin ical arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship between the AE and study treatment.

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 725.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
The SAE definition and reporti ng requirements are in accordan ce with the International 
Conference of Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management: 
Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2A. 
An SAE is defined as any untoward me dical occurrence that at any dose: 
1. Results in death. 
2. Is immediately life-threate ning (ie, in the opinion of  the investigator, the AE 
places the subject at immediate risk of death; it does not include a reaction 
that, had it occurred in a more seve re form, might have caused death). 
3. Requires inpatient hospitaliz ation or results in pr olongation of an existing 
hospitalization. 
4. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
Note: The term “disability” refers to events that result in a substantial 
disruption of a subject’s ability to conduct norma l life function. 
5. Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
6. Is an important medical event (IME).  Note: The term “important medical 
event” refers to an event that, base d upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but 
may jeopardize the subject or require inte rvention to prevent one of the other 
serious outcomes listed under the defi nition of Serious Adverse Event. 
Examples of IMEs include intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not 
result in hospitalization; or devel opment of product dependency or product 
abuse.

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 735.1.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
As soon as an investigator becomes aware of an AE that meets the definition of ‘serious,’ 
this should be documented to the extent that information is available. 
 This report must be submitted by the study site to Exelixis or designee within 
24 hours, even if it is not felt to be drug related.  
 Email: drugsafety@exelixis.com ; Fax 650-837-7392 
 The investigator agrees to  provide supplementary information requested by the 
Exelixis Drug Safety personnel or designee. 
 Pregnancy, although not itself an SAE, shoul d also be reported on an SAE form or 
pregnancy form and be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or 
voluntary termination, details of birth, a nd the presence or absence of any birth 
defects or congenital abnormalities. 
 
5.1.4 Regulatory Reporting 
All serious unexpected adverse drug reacti ons (unexpected related SAEs) must be 
reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by the i nvestigator as required by 
21 CFR 312.32. 
 These reports are to be filed utilizi ng the Form FDA 3500A (MedWatch Form). 
The final MedWatch Form must be submitted by the study site to Exelixis at the time of 
submission to the FDA to allow Exelixis time  to cross-report to Exelixis’ IND. Email: 
drugsafety@exelixis.com ; Fax 650-837-7392 
 
5.2 Other Safety Considerations 
5.2.1 Laboratory Data 
All laboratory data re quired by this protocol and any othe r clinical investigations should 
be reviewed. Any abnormal value that leads to  a change in subject management (eg, dose 
reduction or delay or requirem ent for additional medication or monitoring) or that is 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 74considered to be of clinical significance by th e investigator should be  reported as an AE 
or SAE as appropriate. 
5.2.2 Pregnancy 
Forms for reporting pregnancies will be pr ovided to the study sites upon request. The 
outcome of a pregnancy (for the partner of a subject) and the medical condition of any 
resultant offspring must be reported to Exelixis or designee. Any birth defect or 
congenital anomaly must be reported as an SAE, and any other untoward events 
occurring during the pregnancy must be re ported as AEs or SAEs, as appropriate. 
5.2.3 Medication Errors/ Overdose 
Any study drug administration error or overdose th at results in an AE, even if it does not 
meet the definition of serious, requires reporti ng within 24 hours to Ex elixis or designee. 
5.2.4 Follow-Up of Adverse Events 
Any related SAEs or any AEs assessed as related that led to treatment discontinuation, including clinically signifi cant abnormal laboratory values that meet these criteria, 
ongoing 30 days after the last dose of study treatment must be followed until either resolution of the event or determination by th e investigator that the event has become 
stable or irreversible. This follow-up guidan ce also applies to related SAEs that occur 
> 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. The status of all other continuing AEs 
will be documented as of 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.  
  6.0     CORRELATIVE STUDI ES/PHARMACODYNAMIC STUDIES:   
 Serum and urine markers 
Serum bone markers will be assessed pre and post XL184 therapy. These will include serum bone specific alkaline phos phatase (BSAP) and N-terminal  telopeptide of collagen 
type I (NTx). High levels of these mark ers (>146u/Lfor BSAP and > 100nmol/mmol for 
NTx) were noted to be si gnificantly predictive of hi gher incidence of skeletal 
complications (relative risk  of 3.32, p< 0.001), prostate cancer progression (RR 2.02, 
p<0.001) and death (RR of 4.59, p<0.001) [Lara PN  Jr et al. Clin Cancer Res 2006].  
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 75 
A number of other bone turnover markers such as osteocalcin, pyridinoline, deoxypyridinoline, etc have been implicated to  be predictive of therapeutic response. A 
study evaluating the efficacy of matrix metallopr oteinase inhibitors in prostate cancer 
reported that decline of the bone resorp tion markers including NTx, procollagen I
 NH 2-
terminal propeptide, osteocalcin and deoxypyridinoline correlated with improved 
progression free survival and ove rall survival outcome [Lara PN et al. Clin Cancer Res 
2006 and Coleman RE et al. J Clin Oncol 2005]. This supported the fact  that changes in 
bone turnover could act as surrogates of th erapeutic effect in prostate cancer bone 
metastases.  For the purposes of our pilot trial, we have  selected the serum NTx and BSAP and urine 
NTx as the bone turnover mark ers due to the validation of these markers in prior large 
studies specifically utilizing zoledronate therapy [Coleman RE et al. J Clin Oncol 2005]. 
Decline in the levels was predictive of lowe r incidence of skeletal events as well as 
progression free and overall survival. Hence the measurement of these markers (NTx and BSAP) pre and post therapy will be correlated with PET scan findings and clinical 
outcomes.   
Bone markers: Serum and urine (Timeline: Pretherapy, week 1, week 2 and week 4) 
 
Urine N-telopeptide will be assessed from 24-hour urine collection sample using the 
Vitros ECI Immunodiagnostic System competitive
 assay (Johnson & Johnson Ortho-
Clinical Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ). Urinary marker levels will  be normalized relative to 
urinary creatinine levels, and samples will be required to contain 
 5 mg/dL creatinine to 
ensure validity of the sample. This test will be performed at a local CLIA certified 
laboratory.  
Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels will be assessed using a chemical 
inhibition and differential inactivation assay (12).  4cc of blood will be collected in a tiger 
top tube pre and post therapy for assessment of serum BSAP. This test will be 
performed at a local CLIA certified laboratory. 
Serum N-telopeptide will be assessed from serum collection  sample using the Vitros ECI 
Immunodiagnostic System competitive assay (Johnson & Johnson Ortho-Clinical 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 76Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ) (Chestnut CH 3rd, et al. Am J Med 1997). This test will be 
performed at a local CLIA certified laboratory. 
 
For the first 5 patients, samples will be taken at pretherapy and weeks 1, 2 and 4 after treatment begins.  Timeline for additional 15 pa tients will be adjusted  based on results of 
PET scans in first 5 patients to guide the sampling schedule in next 15 patients.  The 
goal is to have the same schedule for im aging and sample collection so we can 
correlate the results. 
 
 
Additional blood samples will be collected at  baseline and designated time points using 
BD Vacutainer CPT tubes for serum and DNA/RNA samples (Appendix B) in Podgorski 
lab according to protocol described below.   Total RNA isolation from blood will be 
performed using the 
PAXgene™ Blood RNA System (PreAnalytiX). This method requires 
specific sample collection tubes available from PreAnalytiX that contain a proprietary 
reagent that immediately stabilizes intracellular RNA . All isolated samples will be stored at -
80° C until use. TRACP 5 prot ein level and cathepsin K a ssessment in serum. We will 
use the Human TRAPTM Assays to measure the TRACP 5 proteins in serum. TRACP 5b 
is considered to be essential for clinical  assessment of bone metabolism. Quantitative 
assessment of Cathepsin K levels in serum,  an additional indica tor of increased bone 
turnover, will be done using Cathepsin K ELISA kits from ALPCO Immunoassays, Salem, NH. To measure changes in osteoblast function, levels of serum bone serum alkaline phosphatase will be  assessed using Human Alkaline Phosphatase ELISA kits 
from USCN, Lifesciences. The NTx (procollagen I NH
2), a predictive marker of 
therapeutic response in prostate cancer pa tients will be assessed from 24-hour urine 
collection sample using the Vitros ECI Immunodiagnostic System competitive assay (Johnson& Johnson).   Circulating tumor cell (CTC) counts have revealed prognostic and predictive value in 
conjuction with chemotherapy in metastatic CRPC [DeBono J et al. J Clin Oncol]. We will examine the effects of XL184 on CTC coun ts. These will be performed pretherapy,

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 77week 2 and at progression. 7.5 ml of blood will be  collected in a cell save tube at these 
timepoints for CTC. The CTC counts would be performed by the KCI 
pharmacokinetics core.  
 
 
 
TUMOR/BONE BIOPSY SAMPLES: 
 
Tumor/Bone biopsy samples will be collected  pre and post XL184 ther apy. Part of each 
tissue sample will be fresh-frozen for aCGH and genomic expression analysis, and rest 
will be decalcified, fixed and embedded in paraffin for histological and 
immuhistochemical analyses. The biopsy samples will be picked up by Mackenzie Herroon or Izabela Podgorski (contact info be low).  Tissues for hi stology will be fixed 
and decalcified (Podgorski lab) and embedded in paraffin. All immunostaining will be 
performed in Podgorski lab.  
Contact information for blood and biopsy tissue pickup: 
Mackenzie Herroon (313) 577-094 1 (lab); (937) 214-1819 (cell)

Gene Expression profiling 
Tissue collected for RNA isolation will be preserved in RNAlater™ RNA Stabilization 
Reagent. Tissue approximately 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm in size will be stored in a 
nuclease-free vessel appropr iate to accommodate the required 500ul volume of 
RNAlater™ preservative. Samples w ill be submerged and incubated in 
RNAlater™ overnight at 2-8 C.  Then the tissue will be removed from the reagent and 
stored at -80 C until RNA is extracted. 
 
The CGH analysis will be performed us ing comparative genomic hybridization 
microarrays with an average resolution of  35 kb (Agilent 44K). Normal human male 
DNA will be used as a reference sample a nd experiments will be performed with dye-
reversed replicates. For gene expressi on microarray experiments the 60-mer 
oligonucleotide arrays (Agilent 44K), which have the most complete coverage of the 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 78whole human transcriptome will be used. Two color hybridizations w ill interrogate the 
cancer cells from the collected specimens against a common standardized reference 
sample (Universal Human Reference RNA, St ratagene) which will permit the comparison 
of our results to transcriptional profiles generated by other researchers. Alexa dyes 
(Alexa647-red and Alexa555-green) will be used  for fluorescent labeling since these dyes 
are more resistant to oxidation and do not que nch as easily as tr aditional Cy dyes.  
Labeled targets will be synthe sized from the purified RNA using linear amplification and 
indirect labeling by incorporation of aminoallyl-labeled nucleotide, which will 
subsequently be modified by the covale nt addition of Alexa dye (Epicentre 
Technologies). The combined analysis of gene expression and chromosomal aberration 
will be performed as devised by Oncogenomics Lab at Karmanos Cancer Institute. This 
statistical analysis will be carried out with two Bioconductor libraries, globalTest and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).  These methods will be applied to multiple samples with similar amplicons and will provid e a basis for determining the fold change 
threshold required for an individual human tumor biopsy to indicate meaningful over-
expression harboring unique ge netic amplification events. 
 
Immunohistochemistry 
The immunohistochemical analyses will be pe rformed on bone on pre- and post treatment 
biopsy samples to assess: tumor cell prolifer ation (Ki67 staining), apoptosis (TUNEL), 
tumor vasculature (CD31, VEGFR2), cM et, DDR-1 and DDR-2 expression. For 
determination of osteoclast numbers, tart rate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAcP) and 
cathepsin K staining will performed on multiple non-serial sections. Positively stained 
osteoclasts in each section will be counted and expresse d as osteoclast number/mm
2. For 
Ki67, VEGFR2 and cMet, DDR-1, and -2 expr ession the specimens will be evaluated 
independently by two investigator s in a blind fashion and the results will be arbitrarily 
classified into four scores dependent  on the intensity of immunoreactivity: (a) −, negative 
immunostaining; (b) ±, very weak i mmunostaining; (c) +, medium positive 
immunostaining; and (d) ++, strongly positive immunostaining.  The CD31-positive blood vessels will be counted in multiple  fields and expressed as blood vessel 
number/field. To quantify apoptosis, TUNEL pos itive (red) and negative  (blue) cells will

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 79be counted in multiple non-serial sections a nd expressed as a rati o of numbers of red 
apoptotic cells to blue non-apoptotic cells.  Additional tu mor and bone targets may be 
added based on results from gene expression analyses. 
 
Gene expression microarray experiments will be performed using 60-mer oligonucleotide 
arrays (Agilent 44K), which have the most complete coverage of the whole human transcriptome. The histomorphometric and histological approaches will be used to quantitatively assess changes in the bone resorption and bone-to-tumor ratio in response 
to XL184 treatment.  In addition immunohistoche mical analyses will be performed to 
examine changes in tumor cell prolifera tion (Ki67) and apoptosis (TUNEL), tumor 
vasculature (CD31) and expr ession of targets of XL184 act ion: cMet, VEGFR2, DDR-1 
and DDR-2, Additional targets for immunohistoc hemical analyses may be also included 
based on the results of gene expression analyses.   
7       STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
7.1 Objectives: 
7.1.1 Primary Objective:   To conduct a pilot clinical trial to evaluate the timing, 
physiology, and magnitude of changes in tumor imaging, and pharmacodynamic markers 
with XL184 treatment in metastatic ca strate resistant prostate cancer.  
  
7.1.2  Secondary Objectives: 
1) To estimate the progression- free survival (PFS) achieved with XL184 in chemotherapy 
naïve metastatic CRPC patients. 2) To evaluate the feasibility of the therapy, and the toxicities associated. 
3) To evaluate overall survival (OS) in metastatic CRPC patients post ADT. 4) To estimate the mean level of all continuously distributed correlatives, and to tabulate 
the distribution of all cat egorical correlatives. 
7.2 Endpoints: 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 807.2.1 Primary:  PET SUV levels pre- a nd post-treatment with XL184, bone scan 
parameters.   Refer to the Study Schema in Section 2.3. 
7.2.2 Secondary:  TTP, the type and grade of t oxicities, clinical re sponse, PSA response, 
and PET response. 
7.2.3 Correlative:  Serum markers, urinary ma rkers, bone markers, gene expression 
levels, IHC parameters.   A detailed desc ription of them is given in Section 6. 
 
7.3 Design:   This is a prospective pilot adapti ve design study to obtain preliminary data.   
Each patient will undergo up to 4 PET scans, using different radiotracers.   It is desired to 
estimate the mean SUV at any time point to  approximately one-third of a standard 
deviation (SD) with 80% confidence.   With N=15 patients, the mean SUV can be 
estimated to within 0.347 SD units of the true mean with 80% confidence.   These 
preliminary estimates will be of sufficient precision for use in designing a subsequent 
larger study.  Since not all patients will agr ee to undergo all  PET scans, the mean SUV 
may be less precisely estimated at some time points.   7.4 Analysis: 
7.4.1    For the 15 patients imaged on a common schedule (see Section 7.5.1), the 
continuous endpoints (e.g., SUV, bone scan measurements, and all continuously 
distributed correlatives) will be summarized  with standard descriptive statistics, 
separately at each measurement time point .     This will include point and 80% 
confidence interval (CI) estimates.   The mean SUV levels over time will be displayed 
graphically as a line plot (with separate curv es for the different radiotracers).   Gene 
expression levels will be transformed on a log  2 scale. 
 7.4.2  The categorical endpoints (e .g., toxicities, the 3 types of response, IHC expression 
levels, etc.) will be summarized via their frequency distribution, point estimate of the proportion, and the Wilson type 80%  CI.  7.4.3   The distribution of censored PFS will be  summarized via the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) 
survivorship estimate.   Summary statistics (e.g., median, 6-month and 12-month 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 81progression-free rates, etc.) will be calculated from the K-M life table.   Similar analyses 
will be performed for OS as well. 
 
7.5 Expected accrual rate, accrua l duration, and study duration 
7.5.1    We seek to enroll 20 evaluable patients  (maximum of  25 screened to account for 
screen failures and non evaluable patients ) with clinical evidence  of metastases, and 
castrate-resistant di sease who will agree to undergo the various imaging studies, 
additional bone biopsy, and bone scans specified  in the Study Schema of Section 2.3.   To 
monitor early bone and tumor responses to  XL184 treatment, for the first 5 patients 
recruited we will perform imaging with Na18F PET as early as 2 da ys after beginning of 
XL184 regimen. Each patient will receive up to 4 scans.  The initial proposed timeline is: 
baseline, and 2-3 weeks post start of therapy;   however, time points selected for imaging 
may be adjusted based on results of scans and the timing of changes noted in first 5 patients.  After the timeline in dicative of measurable chan ges in bone and/or tumor in 
response to treatment is established, an a dditional 15 patients will be recruited for the 
imaging/biopsy studies on a common schedule.   Those next 15 patients will be utilized 
for statistical estimation purposes, as planne d in the study design described in Section 
7.3. If the pretherapy PET scans do not show any de tectable uptake in metastatic sites, the 
post therapy scan may not be conducted.   7.5.2    We expect an accrual rate of 12 pati ents/year, but we also expect that up to one-
third of them would not comple te the trial due to the required number of PET scans, bone 
scans, and the additional bone biopsy.   Allowing for up to 33% attrition, we anticipate a net accrual rate of a bout 8 patients/year who complete th e trial.   Thus, it would take 
about 30 months (i.e., about 2.5 years) of accrual to enroll  the needed 20 patients who 
complete all the various testing. About 25-30 pa tients will need to be screened to get 20 
evaluable patients on the study.    7.5.3   An additional 2-3 months is required to obtain the various imaging and laboratory 
endpoints on the last patient(s) enrolled, hence the total study duration is expected to be

8     ETHICAL ASPECTS 
8.1  Local Regulations 
The study must fully adhere to the principles outlined in “Guideline for Good Clinical 
Practice” (GCP) ICH E6 Tripar tite Guideline (January 1997). The investigator will 
ensure that the conduct of the study complies wi th the basic principles of GCP as outlined 
in the current version of 21 Code of Federal Regulations, subpart D, Part 312, 
“Responsibilities of Sponsors a nd Investigators” Part 50, “Pro tection of Human Subjects” 
and Part 56, “Instituti onal Review Boards.” 
8.2  Informed Consent 
It is the responsibility of the investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, to 
obtain written informed consent from each s ubject participating in  this study after 
adequate explanation of the aims, methods, an ticipated benefits, a nd potential h azards of 
the study. In the case wher e the subject is unable to rea d, an impartial witness should be 
present during the entire informed consen t discussion. After the subject has orally 
consented to participation in the trial, the w itness’s signature on the form will attest that 
the information in the consent form was accurately explained and understood. 
The CRF for this study contains a section fo r documenting informed subject consent, and 
this must be completed appropriately. If new safety information results in significant 
changes in the risk/ benefit a ssessment, the consent form should be reviewed and updated 
as necessary. All subjects (including those al ready being treated) should be informed of 
the new information, should be given a copy of  the revised form, and should give their 
consent to conti nue in the study. 
8.3  Institutional Review Board/ Ethics Committee  
This study is being conducted under a United States Investigational New Drug 
application or other Clinical  Trial Application, as appropr iate. This protocol (and any 
modifications) and appropriate consent procedures must be reviewed and approved by an 
IRB/ EC. This board must operate in accordan ce with current local, regional, and federal 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 83regulations. The investigator will send a letter or certificate of IRB/ EC approval to 
Exelixis (or designee) before subject enroll ment and whenever subsequent modifications 
to the protocol are made. 
 
 
8.4   Conditions for Modifying the Protocol 
Protocol modifications may be made and will be prepared, reviewed, and approved by 
representatives of the investigator. 
All protocol modifications must be subm itted to the IRB/ EC for information and 
approval in accordance with loca l requirements and to regulatory agencies if required. 
Approval must be obtained before any change s can be implemented, except for changes 
necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to  study subjects or those that involve only 
logistical or administrative aspe cts of the trial (eg, change in data monitor or change of 
telephone number). 8.5   Conditions for Terminating the Study 
Exelixis reserves the right to terminate th e study, and investigators reserve the right to 
terminate their participation in  the study, at any time. Should this be necessary, Exelixis 
and the investigator will arra nge the procedures on an indi vidual study basis after review 
and consultation. In terminating the study, Exelix is and the investigator will ensure that 
adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subjects’ interests.

Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 84as part of their responsibility to prot ect human research volunteers. Research 
records will be stored in a confiden tial manner so as to protect the 
confidentiality of subject information.  
 
b) Representatives of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command 
are authorized to review research reco rds as part of their responsibility to 
protect human research vol unteers. Research records will be stored in a 
confidential manner so as to protect th e confidentiality of your information.     
 
c) All unanticipated problems involving risk  to subjects or others related to 
participation in the study should be  promptly reported by phone (301-619-
2165), by email ( hsrrb@det.amedd.army.mil ), or by facsimile (301-619-
7803) to the USAMRMC, Office of Res earch Protections, Human Research 
Protection Office.  A complete written report will follow the initial notification.  In addition to the methods above, the complete report will be sent to the U.S. Army Medical Re search and Materiel Command, ATTN: 
MCMR-ZB-PH, 504 Scott Street, Fort Detrick, Maryland 21702-5012. 
 
 
9.2  Investigator’s File s and Required Documents 
The investigator must maintain adequate a nd accurate records to enable the conduct of 
the study to be fully documented and the study data to be su bsequently verified. These 
documents should be classified into two separate categories as follows: (1) the 
investigator’s study file, and (2) su bjects’ clinical source documents. 
The investigator’s study file will contain the protocol and protocol amendments, CRFs, 
query forms, IRB/ EC and governmental approvals with correspondence, sample 
informed consent, drug records, staff curricu lum vitae and authorization forms, and other 
appropriate documents and correspondence. 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 85Subjects’ clinical source documents include  the subjects’ hospital/ clinic records; 
physicians’ and nurses’ notes; the appoint ment book; original laboratory, ECG, 
electroencephalogram, X-ray, pathology and special assessm ent reports; signed informed 
consent forms; consultant letters; and subject screening and enrollment logs.  
The investigator must keep these document s on file for at least 2 years after the 
marketing application approval date for the study treatment and fo r the indication being 
investigated or for 2 years after the investig ation is discontinued and the FDA is notified. 
After that period, the documents may be destroyed subject to local regulations with prior 
written permission from Exelixis. If the inve stigator wants to assi gn the study records to 
another party or move them to another location, Exelixis must be notified in advance. 
If the investigator cannot guarantee the archiv ing requirement at the study site for any or 
all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and 
Exelixis to store these in a sealed container out side of the study site so that they can be 
returned sealed to the investigator in case of a regulatory audit. When source documents 
are required for the continued care of the subj ect, appropriate copies should be made for 
storing outside of the study site. 9.3    Source Documents and Background Data 
Upon request, the investigator will supply its  licensees and colla borators with any 
required background data from the study docum entation or clinic records. This is 
particularly important when CRFs are illegible or when errors in data transcription are 
suspected. In case of special problems or gove rnmental queries or requests for audit 
inspections, it is also necessary to have access to the complete study records, provided that subject confidentiality is protected. 
9.4   Case Report Forms  
For enrolled subjects, all and only data from the procedures and assessments specified in 
this protocol and required by the CRFs should be submitted on the appropriate CRF 
(unless source data are transmitted to Exelix is or a designee electronically, eg, central 
laboratory data). Data from so me procedures required by th e protocol, such as physical 
examinations and laboratory results, will be recorded only on the source documents and 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 86will not be transcribed to CRFs. Additio nal procedures and assessments may be 
performed as part of the investigator’s inst itution or medical practic e standard of care and 
may not be required for CRF entry.  
For each subject enrolled, the CRF (paper or electronic) must be completed and signed by 
the PI or authorized delegate from the study staff. 
All paper forms should be typed or filled out  using indelible ink a nd must be legible. 
Errors should be crossed out but not obliter ated, the correction inserted, and the change 
initialed and dated by the investigator or his or her authorized delegate.  
The investigator should ensure the accurac y, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of 
the data reported to Exelixis in the CRF and in all required reports.  9.5   Confidentiality of Trial Documents and Subject Records 
The investigator must assure that subjects’ anonymity will be maintained and that their 
identities are protected from unauthorized  parties. On CRFs or other documents 
submitted to Exelixis or designees, subjects should be identified by identification codes 
and not by their names. The investigator s hould keep a subject enrollment log showing 
codes, names, and addresses. The inves tigator should maintain documents not for 
submission to Exelixis or designees (eg, s ubjects’ written consent forms) in strict 
confidence. 
All tumor scans, research samples, photographs , and results from exam inations, tests, and 
procedures may be sent to Exelixis a nd its partners or designees for review. 
 
10    PUBLICATION OF DATA  
The Principal Investigator (Protocol Chair) holds the primary responsibility for 
publication of the study results; provided that  the PI will provide any such publication to 
Exelixis, Inc. for review at least sixty (60)  days prior to submission and also comply 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 87withy any provisions regarding publication as are agreed to between the PI’s institution 
(eg, institution name.) and Exelixis, Inc. in the Clinical Trial Agreement related to this 
study. The results will be made public within 24 months of the end of data collection. 
However, if a report is planned to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, then that 
initial release may be an ab stract that meets the require ments of the International 
Committee of Medical Journal Editors. In any event, a full report of the outcomes should 
be made public no later than three (3) years af ter the end of data collection. Authorship 
for abstracts and manuscripts resulting from  this study will be determined according to 
guidelines established by the Internati onal Committee of Medical Journal Editors.

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 96Appendix B   BLOOD PROCESSING 
 
 
1. The Vacutainer CPT tube with Sodium C itrate should be at room temperature (18-
25  C) 
2. Collect 8 ml of blood into the Tube 
3. Store Tube upright at room temperat ure until centrifugation.  Centrifugation 
should be performed within  2 hours of blood collection 
4. Centrifuge at room temperature in a horizontal rotor (swing-out head) for a 
minimum of 20 minutes at 1500 to 1800 RCF 
 
NOTE: Mix blood sample immediately prior to centrifugation by gently inverting the 
Tube 8 to 10 times  
5. After centrifugation, mononuclear cells and plat elets will be in a whitish layer just 
under serum layer 
6. Collect serum without disturbing the cell layer.  Store at -80  C for future 
analysis. 
7.  Collect the cell layer with a Pasteur pipe tte and transfer to a 15 ml size conical 
centrifuge tube with cap. Collection of cells immediately following centrifugation 
will yield best results. 
	
SUGGESTED CELL WASHING STEP: 
 
8. Add PBS to bring volume to 15 ml. Cap t ube, mix by inverting the tube 5 times 
9. Centrifuge for 15 minutes at 300 RCF.  As pirate as much supernatant as possible 
without disturbing the pellet 
10. Add PBS to bring volume to 10 ml. Cap t ube, mix by inverting the tube 5 times, 
centrifuge for 10 minutes at 300 RCF and as pirate supernatant without disturbing 
the pellet 
11. Re-suspend the cell pellet in 1 ml PBS.  Transfer cell suspension into Eppendorf 
tube, centrifuge and aspirate as much s upernatant as possibl e without disturbing 
the pellet (lymphocytes). 
12.  Store lymphocytes as pellet, do not add any solution.  For buffy coat/DNA 
analysis, add 1 ml 1% SDS/1mM EDTA /50 mM mannitol/20 mM Tris, pH 7.4 
over the cell pellet and vortex. Freeze at -80  C for future analysis. 
13.  For RNA later, resuspend the pellet in 100 ul of RNA later solution, then freeza 
at -80 C.

TITLE:  Open-Label Extension, Phase 2b Study to Evaluate the Longer Term Efficacy and Safety 
of LIB003 in Patients on Stable Lipid-Lowering Therapy Requiring Additional LDL-C Reduction  
PROTOCOL NUMBER:   LIB003-010 
INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT:   LIB003 
PHASE:  2b 
INDICATION(S):  Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL- C) reduction in patients with 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), high risk of ASCVD, or heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) without cardiovascular disease who need additional LDL- C 
reduction 
OBJECTIVES: 
The primary objectives of this study are to assess the longer term safety, tolerability, and 
LDL-C-lowering efficacy after 52 weeks  of additional treatment with LIB003 at a subcutaneous 
(SC) dose of 300 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W). Study patients will be those with 
hypercholesterolemia on stable diet and oral LDL-C-lowering drug therapy who have comp leted 
the Phase 2 dose finding study.  
The secondary objectives of this study are the following: 
 To assess the longer term tolerability and safety of LIB003 300 mg Q4W in patients treated 
for an additional 52 weeks who were previously treated with LIB003 at 150 mg, 300 mg , and 
350 mg or placebo during the Phase 2 double-blind study;   
 To assess the stability of LDL-C-lowering with LIB003 300 mg Q4W in patients treated for 
an additional 52 weeks who were previously treated with LIB003 at 150 mg, 300 mg, and 
350 mg or placebo during the Phase 2 double-blind study; 
 To assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect on serum unbound (free) proprotein convertase 
subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) concentrations of LIB003 300 mg Q4W in patients treated for 
an additional 52 weeks who were previously treated with LIB003 at 150 mg, 300 mg , and 
350 mg or placebo during the Phase 2 double-blind study; 
 To assess the effects on serum lipids, including total cholesterol (TC), high- density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (HDL-C), non–HDL-C, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C ), and 
triglycerides (TG) of LIB003 300 mg Q4W in patients treated for an additional 52 weeks who 
were previously treated with LIB003 at 150 mg, 300 mg, and 350 mg or placebo during the 
Phase 2 double-blind study; 
 To assess the effects on apolipoprotein (apo) B and lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]) serum 
concentrations of LIB003 300 mg Q4W in patients treated for an additional 52 weeks who 
were previously treated with LIB003 at 150 mg, 300 mg, and 350 mg or placebo during the 
Phase 2 double-blind study;

Version 3.0, 18 March  2020 5 To assess the pharmacokinetics of LIB003 and PCSK9 following multiple doses of LIB003  
300 mg SC Q4W;   
 To assess the frequency of anti-drug (anti-LIB003) antibodies (ADAs) (immunogenicity) of 
LIB003 300 mg Q4W in patients treated for an additional 52 weeks who were previously 
treated with LIB003 at 150 mg, 300 mg, and 350 mg or placebo, including those w ith 
detectable ADAs during the Phase 2 double-blind study; and   
 Patients who develop neu tralizing antibodies at Week 52 may be administered up to 3 
additional doses of LIB003 300 mg QW4 for a total of up to 64 weeks exposure to allow for 
the assessment and characterization of this finding. Following the first dose, if NAbs continue 
positive with possible attenuation of free PCSK9 and LDL-C, then up to 2 additional doses 
could be administered. 
POPULATION: 
The population for this study includes men and women who are 18 years of age who completed 
the double-blind, placebo-controlled 16-week Phase 2 study (LIB003-002) and will continue on 
stable lipid-lowering oral drug therapy (eg, tolerable statin with or without ezetimibe). 
STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION: 
This is an open-label, Phase 2b extension study of 52 weeks duration. Approximately 35 men and 
women aged 18 years who have completed the Phase 2 (LIB003-002) study and fulfill the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled at up to 4 sites in the United States. All patients 
will receive LIB003 at a dose of 300 mg administered SC Q4W.   
LIB003-010 Phase 2b Study Design  
 
 M = month; Q4W = every 4 weeks; SC = subcutaneously; W = week. 
Study Procedures 
Patients who have completed the LIB003- 002 study and do not meet any exclusion criteria and 
have completed the informed consent for this extension study will receive LIB003 at a dose of  
300 mg Q4W by SC injection at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48. In 
addition to a basic lipid profile, LDL-C will be measured by preparative ultracentrifugation at  
specified visits during the study. All lipid measurements on Week 0/Month 0 onward will be 
available to the Investigator, patients, and all site and Sponsor personnel involved in the study.  
Final safety assessments will include adverse events and the results from physical examinations, 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), cl inical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, and 
urinalysis), and immunogenicity testing. Injection site reactions will be assessed at each visit.  
Patients testing positive for ADAs will be tested for neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and titer, and 
may be further characterized for isotype, binding site, affinity, and presence of immune 
complexes.

Version 3.0, 18 March  2020 6Patients who test positive for binding, non-NAbs and have clinical sequelae at Week 52 /Early 
Termination that are considered safety related may be asked to return for additional monthly 
follow-up testing.  
In the case of positive NAbs at the final visit (Week 52/Early Termination ), patients will be asked 
to return for follow-up testing every 3 months until either NAbs are no longer detectable or the 
patient has been followed for a period of at least 12 months. During the initial 3 months of follow-
up patients may continue to receive LIB003 300mg at visits Q4W for a potential total exposure of 
64 weeks to further characterize the NAb finding. Following the first dose, if NAbs continue 
positive with possible attenuation of free PCSK9 and LDL-C, then up to 2 additional doses could 
be administered. 
DOSAGE FORMS AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION: 
All patients will receive SC doses of LIB003 300 mg administered as a SC injection by clinic 
personnel. 
PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES: 
Total serum PCSK9 concentrations at Weeks 24 and 36 and 52/Early Termination will be 
assessed.  
PHARMACODYNAMIC VARIABLES:  
The PD parameters include changes from both baseline in the Phase 2 (LIB003- 002) study and 
Week 0 in this study in LDL-C (calculated and measured), unbound (free) PCSK9 concentrat ions, 
serum lipid parameters (TC, HDL-C, non–HDL-C, VLDL-C, TG, apo B, and Lp[a]). 
SAFETY VARIABLES:  
Safety assessments will include adverse events and the results of vital sign measurements, ECG s, 
physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, and immunogenicity evaluations. Injection site 
reactions will be monitored by physical examination. The incidence of observed adverse events 
will be tabulated and reviewed for potential significance and clinical importance.  
STATISTICAL ANALYSES: 
Efficacy Analyses 
The primary objectives of this study are to assess the percent change from baseline, from the 
original LIB003-002 study, in LDL-C level at Week 52 (both calculated by Friedewald formula) 
with monthly (Q4W) dosing of various doses of LIB003 administere d SC in patients with 
hypercholesterolemia on stable diet and oral LDL-C-lowering drug therapy. Interim analyses will 
be carried out at Weeks 24 and 36 weeks. Results will be summarized descriptively. 
Safety Analyses 
The safety endpoint data will be summar ized for the Safety Population, which is defined as all 
patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Adverse events will be coded using the latest 
version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. A general summary of the adverse 
events and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be summarized by overall number of adverse 
events, severity, and relationship to study drug. The number of adverse events leading to

Version 3.0, 18 March  2020 15 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in 
industrialized countries and, despite progress in treatment, is projected to cause >22 million deaths 
over the next 15 years.1 Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) has been identified as one 
of the major, and easily modifiable, risk factors for atherosclerosis.2 Significant ASCVD benefit 
has been achieved since the introduction of statin therapy to reduce LDL-C.2 However, significant 
unmet medical need remains for additional LDL-C reduction in patients with existing ASCVD and 
those at increased cardiovascular risk, including patients unable to tolerate statins or effective 
doses of statins and those with more severe elevations of LDL-C, such as those with familial 
hypercholesterolemia (FH).3 Data from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ Collaboration has 
provided evidence that for every 1 mmol/L (~39 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C, the risk of major 
cardiovascular events is reduced by 24%, although these data were collected mostly with statins.2 
The recent cardiovascular outcome study with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 
(PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and evolocumab (Repatha®) and alirocumab (Praluent®) 
studies, the FOURIER and ODYSSEY Outcome studies, respectively, have confirmed this 
relationship for non–statin-lowering of LDL-C.4,5 Furthermore, recent data from a number of 
studies, including post hoc analysis of the IMPROVE-IT and Phase 3 alirocumab (Praluent®) 
studies, plus the FOURIER and SPIRE (Cardiovascular Efficacy and Safety of Bococizumab in 
High-Risk Patients) studies, have shown that the relationship between absolute LDL-C reduction 
and ASCVD event reduction remains linear and extends to very low LDL-C levels of <15 mg/dL 
without signals of adverse events either from PCSK9 inhibition or very low LDL-C.6,7,8,9,10,11 
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 is a circulating protein secreted mainly by the liver 
that plays a significant role in the recycling of hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs) 
and has been identified as a validated drug target for reduction of LDL-C. The LDLR is the primary 
pathway for LDL-C elimination from circulation; plasma PCSK9 binds to the hepatic LDLR along 
with LDL-C, targeting the receptor for degradation after endocytosis and thus reducing the 
expression of LDLRs available to remove LDL-C from circulation. Gain-of-function mutations of 
PCSK9 are associated with elevated LDL-C and constitute a third cause of FH and accelerated 
ASCVD, while loss-of-function mutations of PCSK9 are associated with reduced levels of LDL-C 
and reductions in ASCVD.4,5,11,12 Adverse effects or other metabolic disturbances have not been 
observed in subjects carrying loss-of-function PCSK9 mutations, even in a compound 
heterozygote with no detectable PCSK9 levels and strikingly low LDL-C (14 mg/dL), although 
recent Mendelian randomization studies have suggested the potential for increased diabetes in 
patients with impaired glucose tolerance or metabolic syndrome similar to that seen with 
statins.5,13,14 Nonclinical studies in PCSK9 knockout or overexpressing mice revealed phenotypes 
consistent with the human clinical data.15 Together, the clinical and nonclinical data for the PCSK9 
mechanism of action provide a strong genetic proof of concept for targeting PCSK9 to reduce 
plasma LDL-C levels and lower the risk of coronary heart disease. Based on these observations, 
PCSK9 inhibition is a promising target for developing new non-mAb therapies for reduction of 
plasma cholesterol levels. 
LIB Therapeutics has developed LIB003, a Chinese hamster ovary-cell line-derived recombinant 
fusion protein therapeutic agent consisting of a PCSK9-binding domain and human serum albumin 
(HSA). The HSA contains an alanine substituted for the naturally occurring cysteine at residue 34. 
The PCSK9-binding domain (Adnectin) in LIB003 is derived from the 10th type III domain of

Version 3.0, 18 March  2020 16 targets with high affinity. LIB003 has been designed to target PCSK9 and binds to human PCSK9 
with picomolar affinity in a concentration-dependent manner. The binding of LIB003 to PCSK9 
blocks the interaction between PCSK9 and LDLR, which thereby prevents LDLR degradation, 
increases LDLR recycling, enhances LDL-C clearance, and lowers plasma LDL-C levels. Based 
on this mechanism of action, LIB003 is being developed as an adjunct subcutaneous (SC) therapy 
for the reduction of LDL-C in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH (HeFH), ASCVD, 
or high risk of ASCVD who require additional LDL-C reduction. 
Based on in vitro and in vivo data demonstrating that LIB003 was unable to bind rodent PCSK9 
with sufficient affinity to modulate pharmacology in wild type rodents, no rodent toxicity studies 
were performed in accordance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) 
Guideline S6.16,17,18 To assess the overall toxicity risk of exposing human subjects to LIB003, 
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) 4-week repeat-dose and 12-week repeat-dose toxicity studies 
were conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. These studies demonstrated that LIB003 was clinically 
well tolerated with no adverse findings at all doses tested (30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg SC doses; 
100 mg/kg intravenous [IV] dose [4-week study only]). The highest dose of 100 mg/kg was 
considered the no-observed-adverse-effect level in both studies.    
In this current study, as with now numerous studies with mAbs that inhibit PCSK9, inhibition with 
LIB003 is not expected to adversely impact the cardiovascular system since both PCSK9-null mice 
and compound heterozygous humans with PCSK9 loss-of-function mutations exhibit no 
discernable cardiovascular phenotype.19,20,21 Moreover, extensive clinical studies inhibiting 
PCSK9 with monoclonal antibodies have shown only cardiovascular benefit.4,5,7,8,9,10,18,19,20 
Evaluation of the effect of LIB003 on the cardiovascular, central nervous, and respiratory systems 
were included as part of the 4-week GLP toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys in accordance 
with ICH S6 and S7 Guidances.16 Results from the study revealed that repeated administration of 
LIB003 had no effect on cardiovascular, central nervous system, or respiratory function. No 
genotoxicity studies were conducted with LIB003 as LIB003 is a fusion protein that does not 
contain an organic linker or any chemical moiety and, therefore, lacks potential for mutagenesis.  
Phase 1 study: 
LIB003 has been studied in a Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) study of 63 subjects, 45 on 
LIB003 and 18 placebo, monitored post-dose for at least 43 days. Subcutaneous doses of LIB003 
25 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, and 600 mg were administered to healthy subjects on no 
lipid-lowering therapy who had baseline LDL-C 100 and 190 mg/dL, and the 150 mg and 
300 mg doses were administered to patients on stable statin therapy with baseline 
LDL-C 100 mg/dL.  
Safety: All subjects had TG 250 mg/dL. LIB003 was safe and well tolerated following single SC 
and IV dosing in healthy subjects at all doses both for SC and IV administration as well as in 
patients with hypercholesterolemia on statin therapy at 150 mg and 300 mg given SC. A summary 
of adverse events is provided in Table 1 and summarized below.

There were no deaths or discontinuations due to adverse events. 
One placebo-treated subject experienced a moderate treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) 
that was considered not related to study drug; the subject, a 61-year-old male on statin who 
received placebo in cohort 9 (LIB003 300 mg SC or placebo group), experienced an episode of 
syncope with rapid heart rate and was found to be in atrial fibrillation 48 hours following 
administration of study drug. The patient was transported to the emergency room and admitted to 
the hospital, but within a few hours spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm before being seen by 
a cardiologist and discharged from the hospital. Subsequent follow-up with the cardiologist 
included stress ECHO test and Holter monitoring, which were normal and resulted in no further 
treatment or intervention.   
A total of 6 of 18 (33%) placebo subjects and 13 of 45 (29%) LIB003 subjects reported at least 
1 TEAE; none of the TEAEs were considered serious or drug related (Table 1). 
The most common adverse events reported (by more than 1 subject) were respiratory infections, 
gastrointestinal, eye (blurred vision), central nervous system (headache), and musculoskeletal; all 
other adverse events were reported by 1 subject only. None appeared dose related or more 
frequently in LIB003-treated subjects compared to placebo. 
One of the adverse events that was considered clinically significant was a 39-year-old male subject 
who received 300 mg LIB003 IV and experienced swelling of his lips 48 hours after study drug 
administration. This was confirmed on examination as mild, not affecting speech, food, or fluid 
intake. There was no evidence of tongue or soft palate edema and the subject denied any difficulty 
swallowing or breathing. The subject denied any other symptoms, such as rash or pruritus. There 
was no evidence of any reaction at the infusion site. He had no history of similar symptoms or 
known drug or food allergies. His vitals, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and 48-hour safety labs were 
unremarkable. The subject received oral Benadryl 50 mg and ranitidine 75 mg (which he 
continued twice daily). The Benadryl was replaced with cetirizine 10 mg orally daily and the 
subject was monitored as an outpatient after completing Day 4 in the inpatient unit. The swelling 
subsided after 2 to 3 more days without further intervention. cohort PBO 25 mg 75 mg 150 mg Diet 300 mg Diet 600 mg SC 300 mg IV 600 mg IV 150 mg Statin 300 mg Statin ALL LIB

Version 3.0, 18 March  2020 18 There were no other clinically remarkable vital sign measurements, physical examination findings, 
physical measurement findings, or clinically remarkable trends from baseline to discharge. 
There were no clinically remarkable trends observed in laboratory findings. A number of subjects 
in both LIB003 and placebo experienced spikes in creatine kinase (CK) that were clearly related 
to exercise or excessive or unusual physical activity, and CK decreased at subsequent testing. 
There were no adverse events based on ECG findings or any findings that were assessed as 
clinically significant by the Investigator. 
Anti-drug (anti-LIB003) antibodies (ADAs) were confirmed in 2 subjects: One subject treated with 
25 mg SC of LIB003 developed low titer non-neutralizing ADAs at Day 43; the titers remained 
low on monthly follow-up, with a stable titer of 160 after 3 months. The second subject, treated 
with 600 mg IV of LIB003, developed an ADA response at Day 22, which increased to a titer of 
2560 by Day 43. The patient was followed at weekly intervals until Day 57 when LDL-C returned 
to within 20% of baseline and was followed at monthly intervals for 2.5 months after Day 43, 
reaching a maximal titer of 5120 at Day 113, which declined 50% on Day 142. There were no 
associated clinical or laboratory adverse effects noted and there did not appear to be any 
neutralizing impact on efficacy as LDL-C and free PCSK9 reduction did not appear attenuated 
compared to other subjects treated with LIB003 in the same cohort. Evaluation in the LIB003 
neutralizing antibody (NAb) assay indicated that these ADAs were neutralizing beginning on 
Day 29 through Day 113 and were no longer neutralizing on Day 142. At a routine clinic visit on 
01 August 2018 (1 month after ending the study) to the Principal Investigator (PI), who was also 
the patient’s lipid doctor, the patient reported a recent upper right lung lobe mass found by their 
primary care physician on 24 July 2018 and on biopsy taken 30 July 2018 diagnosed as 
Epstein-Barr positive diffuse large B cell lymphoma of intra thoracic lymph nodes. The finding 
was determined by the PI as unrelated to study drug. 
Efficacy: Mean reductions in free PCSK9 were rapid with all doses and reached more than 
99% within 12 hours and were sustained in virtually all subjects for at least 3 weeks (Day 22) in 
the cohorts not on lipid-lowering therapy receiving 150 mg of LIB003. While the 300 mg dose 
maintained 99% suppression of free PCSK9 for 29 days in the 150 mg patients on 
non-lipid-lowering subjects, it had decreased to 12% and in those on statins to 54% of baseline 
levels. The reduced effects in free PCSK9 were reflected in less reductions of LDL-C and 
apolipoprotein (apo) B in statin-treated subjects although greater reductions were maintained in 
subjects not on lipid-lowering therapy. However, the 150 mg dose did not reduce free PCSK9 or 
LDL-C sufficiently in all statin-treated patients for 4 weeks. The single 300 mg dose, in both 
non-statin and statin-treated subjects, provided more stable and maximal reductions in free 
PCSK9, LDL-C, and apo B. In addition, based on prior data from studies with mAbs, it is 
anticipated that multiple dosing will result in longer duration of both free PCSK9 suppression and 
LDL-C reduction. Furthermore, extensive prior data show that patients on high-intensity statins 
and those with FH, who have higher baseline PCSK9 levels and likely increased synthesis of 
PCSK9, will require 300 mg or higher doses in order to suppress both free PCSK9 and LDL-C 
fully for 4 weeks. Three doses were selected for the Phase 2 study to be administered SC every 
4 weeks (Q4W); 150 mg, 300 mg, and 350 mg.

Version 3.0, 18 March  2020 19 Phase 2 study: 
Based on the free PCSK9 and LDL-C data from the SAD study and an objective of obtaining 
maximal and stable LDL-C reductions with dosing at least Q4W in a volume that is consistent 
with a single SC injection via an autoinjector ( 1.5 mL), a 16-week Phase 2 study was done. This 
was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study in approximately 81 patients with 
ASCVD, or at high risk for ASCVD, or HeFH without cardiovascular disease, on stable maximal 
tolerable statin and/or ezetimibe which was completed on 09 November 2018. The doses assessed 
included 150 mg, 300 mg, and 350 mg all administered SC Q4W on Days 1, 29, and 57 with the 
final efficacy endpoint at Day 85 (Week 12). Patients were monitored for 4 additional weeks at 
Days 99 and 113. Patients were randomized within each treatment group to LIB003 or placebo in 
a ratio of 3:1 resulting in 20 patients on placebo and 61 patients in the LIB003 treatment groups 
(21 on 150 mg, 19 on 300 mg, and 21 on 350 mg). Of the 81 patients randomized, 79 completed 
the study; of the 2 patients not completing the study, 1 was terminated after 4 weeks after starting 
on a prescription PCSK9 monoclonal antibody while the second patient withdrew after receiving 
the first dose due to conflict with her work schedule.  
Safety: There were no deaths and all 3 doses were safe and well tolerated (see Table 2). Serious 
adverse events occurred in 5.0% (1/20) subjects in the placebo group, 4.8% (1/21) in the LIB003 
150 mg group, 10.5% (2/19) in the LIB003 300 mg, and 9.5% (2/21) in the LIB003 350 mg group. 
Of the entire 81 patients, 24 were found to have positive ADAs on screening, of which 19 were 
confirmed as positive. This included 2 patients (2.5%) who tested positive prior to receiving study 
drug and whom showed the highest titers (160 and 1280) and in both patients, titers decreased 
progressively after dosing with study drug. Excluding these 2 patients, ADAs were found to be 
present post-dose in 27.8% (17/61) patients treated with LIB003 and 0% (0/20) on placebo. All 
positive ADAs post-dosing of study drug had low, or below level of quantitation, levels and based 
on individual free PCSK9 and LDL-C levels, there did not appear to be a pharmacokinetic 
(PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) effect. Subsequent testing was negative for treatment-induced 
NAbs.

Efficacy: The co-primary endpoints of percent reduction in LDL-C (calculated by Friedewald 
formula) from baseline compared to placebo at Week 12 and the mean of Weeks 10 and 12 was 
achieved (p<0.0001) for all 3 doses (see Table 3); however, maximal and stable reductions were

-77.3% (6.63; -90.5, -64.1)] at Week 12 (last post-baseline observation carried forward [LOCF]) 
and -76.1% (4.99; -86.0, -66.2) at mean of Weeks 10 and 12 (LOCF). These results were consistent 
with LDL-C measured by Hopkins formula and by preparative ultracentrifugation. The lower dose 
of 150 mg, while achieving similar LDL-C reductions at 2 weeks post dose, was insufficient to 
provide consistent free PCSK9, and more importantly LDL-C, reductions for 4 weeks. The larger 
dose of 350 mg Q4W provided no additional LDL-C reduction at any time point.

Based on the results the dose of 300 mg (1.2 mL) SC Q4W was selected for the open-label 
extension (LIB003-010) study. 
In summary to date, no specific risks have been identified in the nonclinical or clinical 
development of LIB003.  
1.1 Rationale 
The rationale for this extension study is to enable longer term assessment of the safety, tolerability, 
and LDL-C-lowering efficacy for a 52-week additional treatment with LIB003 at a SC dose of 
300 mg Q4W. Study patients will be those with hypercholesterolemia on stable diet and oral 
LDL-C-lowering drug therapy who have completed the Phase 2 dose finding study.  
Additional objectives of this study are the following: 
 To assess the frequency of anti-drug (anti-LIB003) antibodies (ADAs) (immunogenicity) of 
LIB003 300 mg Q4W in patients treated for an additional 52 weeks who were previously 
treated with LIB003 at 150 mg, 300 mg, and 350 mg or placebo, including those with 
detectable ADAs during the Phase 2 double-blind study; 
 To assess the longer term tolerability and safety of LIB003 300 mg Q4W in patients treated 
for an additional 52 weeks who were previously treated with LIB003 at 150 mg, 300 mg, and 
350 mg or placebo during the Phase 2 double-blind study;   
 To assess the stability of LDL-C-lowering with LIB003 300 mg Q4W in patients treated for 
an additional 52 weeks who were previously treated with LIB003 at 150 mg, 300 mg, and 
350 mg or placebo during the Phase 2 double-blind study; 

LIB Therapeutics, LLC

Confidential & Proprietary 
Version 3.0, 18 March  2020 21  To assess the PD effect on serum unbound (free) PCSK9 concentrations of LIB003 300 mg 
Q4W in patients treated for an additional 52 weeks who were previously treated with LIB003 
at 150 mg, 300 mg, and 350 mg or placebo during the Phase 2 double-blind study; 
 To assess the effects on serum lipids, including total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (HDL-C), non–HDL-C, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), and 
triglycerides (TG) of LIB003 300 mg Q4W in patients treated for an additional 52 weeks who 
were previously treated with LIB003 at 150 mg, 300 mg, and 350 mg or placebo during the 
Phase 2 double-blind study; 
 To assess the PK of LIB003 and PCSK9 following multiple doses of LIB003 300 mg SC Q4W; 
and 
 To assess the effects on apo B and lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]) serum concentrations of LIB003 
300 mg Q4W in patients treated for an additional 52 weeks who were previously treated with 
LIB003 at 150 mg, 300 mg, and 350 mg or placebo during the Phase 2 double-blind study. 
In patients who are NAb positive at Week 52, the rationale for up to 3 additional doses of LIB003 
300mg QW4 (12 additional weeks of exposure) is to allow for the assessment of the time course 
of NAbs and effects on relevant clinical and laboratory measures including but not limited to free 
PCSK9 and LDL-C. 
The risk of continuing treatment for up to 12 additional weeks (64 weeks total exposure) is 
considered low.  Currently, 3 of 112 (approximately 2.7%) patients who have received LIB003 to 
date have developed NAbs. No patient has had a concurrent change in their clinical or laboratory 
safety or efficacy findings. The PCSK9 free and LDL-C lowering effects remained consistent to 
previous visits when there were no NAbs detected, negating any indication of a neutralizing 
clinical effect. In 2 prior patients, NAbs were detected and then resolved while the patient remained 
on LIB003 treatment or followed after completing treatment in the phase 1 single ascending dose 
trial.   
Safety, immunogenicity, and PD data derived from the study will further support the Phase 3 
studies. 
1.2 Risk/Benefit 
Patients will receive no known clinical benefit from participating in the study beyond that of an 
assessment of their overall health status and reduction in LDL-C.   
LIB003 at doses of 300 mg given were shown to reduce LDL-C levels >60% and was safe and 
well tolerated in the Phase 2 study these patients previously participated in. Therefore, the risk to 
patients in this study is considered low.

Version 3.0, 18 March  2020 23 3 STUDY DESCRIPTION 
3.1 Summary of Study Design 
This is an open-label, Phase 2b extension study of 52 weeks duration. Approximately 35 men and 
women aged 18 years who have completed the Phase 2 (LIB003-002) study and fulfill the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled at up to 4 sites in the United States. All patients 
will receive LIB003 at a dose of 300 mg administered SC Q4W as shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. LIB003 Phase 2b Open-Label Extension Study 
  
M = month; Q4W = every 4 weeks; SC = subcutaneously; W = week. 
Patients who have completed the LIB003-002 study and do not meet any exclusion criteria and 
have completed the informed consent for this extension study will receive LIB003 at a dose of 
300 mg Q4W by SC injection at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48. In addition 
to a basic lipid profile, LDL-C will be measured by preparative ultracentrifugation at specified 
visits during the study. All lipid measurements on Week 0/Month 0 onward will be available to 
the Investigator, patients, and all site and Sponsor personnel involved in the study. Final safety 
assessments will include adverse events and the results from physical examinations, ECGs, clinical 
laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), and immunogenicity testing. 
Injection site reactions will be assessed at each visit.  
Patients testing positive for ADAs will be tested for NAbs and titer, and may be further 
characterized for isotype, binding site, affinity, and presence of immune complexes.  
Patients who test positive for binding, non-NAbs and have clinical sequelae at Week 52/Early 
Termination that are considered safety related may be asked to return for additional monthly 
follow-up testing.  
In the case of positive NAbs at the final visit (Week 52/Early Termination), patients will be asked 
to return for follow-up testing every 3 months until either NAbs are no longer detectable or the 
patient has been followed for a period of at least 12 months.  During the initial 3 months of follow-
up patients may continue to receive LIB003 300mg at visits Q4W for a potential total exposure of 
64 weeks to further characterize the NAb finding. Following the first dose, if NAbs continue 
positive with possible attenuation of free PCSK9 and LDL-C, then up to 2 additional doses could 
be administered.  
3.2 Stopping Rules  
Dose-Limiting Toxicity  
Dosing of a patient will be discontinued for any of the following events:  
 Alanine transaminase (ALT) and/or aspartate transaminase (AST) >5  upper limit of normal

5.2 Rationale for Dosing 
In the previous Phase 2 study (LIB003-002), the 300 mg SC dose QW4 was safe and well tolerated 
and provided maximal and stable reduction in mean LDL-C for 4 weeks. 
5.3 Randomization and Blinding 
This is an open-label extension study, therefore, no randomization or blinding is necessary. 
5.4 Breaking the Blind 
This is an open-label extension study, therefore, no blinding is necessary. 
5.5 Drug Supplies 
5.5.1 Formulation and Packaging 
The drug product is a 250 mg/mL solution packaged in 0.85 mL volumes in 2 mL clear glass vials 
with stoppers and aluminum crimp seals.  
The LIB003 formulation contains 20 mM histidine, 150 mM sodium chloride, 
0.02% Polysorbate 80 at pH 6.8, which are common excipients at concentrations used in approved 
protein therapeutics administered as SC doses.  
5.5.2 Study Drug Preparation and Dispensing 
LIB003 should be withdrawn directly from the vial into a suitable size syringe for injection. 
Solutions of LIB003 may foam; therefore, shaking and excessive agitation of vials should be 
avoided, or if performed, sufficient time allowed for the contents to settle prior to withdrawing the 
contents. Additionally, care must be taken to ensure the sterility of the prepared solution, as the 
drug product does not contain antimicrobial preservatives or bacteriostatic agents. To assure 
sterility of the prepared solutions, the vials are for single use only. 
Trained medical personnel will administer LIB003 to patients within the clinical facility. Site 
personnel should ensure that the study drug is stored in accordance with the environmental 
conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) as determined by LIB Therapeutics as outlined in the 
pharmacy manual. If concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study drug arise, do not 
dispense the study drug and contact LIB Therapeutics immediately.

5.6 Prior and Concomitant Medications and/or Procedures 
5.6.1 Excluded Medications and/or Procedures 
Concomitant therapy includes all medications and non-medication interventions used by a patient 
during the study.  
Medications include prescription drugs, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, approved dietary and 
herbal supplements, and nutritional supplements. Examples of non-medication interventions 
include individual psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, smoking cessation therapy, and 
rehabilitative therapy. All concomitant medications and non-medication interventions should be 
reported to the Investigator and recorded in the concomitant medications eCRF. 
As a general rule, concomitant medications will be permitted unless specifically excluded and 
provided they are anticipated to remain stable throughout the study or do not impact LDL-C. The 
rationale for use of any exceptions is to be discussed between the Investigator and the Sponsor and 
clearly documented. The following medications are exceptions: 
 Medications used to treat adverse events may be prescribed preferably after consultation with 
the Medical Monitor, unless there is an immediate medical need to ensure the well-being of 
the patient that should not be delayed. All therapy and/or medication administered to manage 
adverse events should be recorded in the appropriate eCRF.

Version 3.0, 18 March  2020 39 8 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
8.1 Adverse Events 
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the investigational medicinal 
product. All adverse events, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or 
symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. 
Adverse events, which include clinical laboratory test variables, will be monitored and 
documented from the time following the first dose of study drug until study participation is 
complete. Patients should be instructed to report any adverse event that they experience to the 
Investigator. From the time following the first dose of study drug, the Investigator should make an 
assessment for adverse events at each visit and record the event on the appropriate adverse event 
eCRF. 
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by the Investigator and recorded on the eCRF. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or 
syndrome by the Investigator, it should be recorded as a separate adverse event on the eCRF.  
Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure (eg, surgery, endoscopy, 
tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded as an adverse event, not the procedure.  
Any medical condition already present at the time of the first dose of study drug should not be 
reported as an adverse event unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at baseline 
changes in nature or seriousness at any time during the study. In this case, it should be reported as 
an adverse event. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination (eg, ECG) findings that are 
detected during the study or are present at the time of the first dose of study drug and significantly 
worsen during the study should be reported as adverse events. The Investigator will exercise his 
or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other 
abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values 
occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or 
are no longer clinically significant. Any abnormal test that is determined to be an error does not 
require reporting as an adverse event. Laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal clinical findings 
(eg, ECG abnormalities) should be reported as an adverse event if any of the following are 
applicable: 
 If an intervention is required as a result of the abnormality, 
 If action taken with the study drug is required as a result of the abnormality, or 
 Based on the clinical judgment of the Investigator. 
8.1.1 Adverse (Drug) Reaction 
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be 
considered an adverse drug reaction. “Responses” to a medicinal product means that a causal 
LIB Therapeutics, LLC 
Clinical Study Protocol LIB003-010 
Confidential & Proprietary 
Version 3.0, 18 March  2020 40 relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility 
(ie, the relationship cannot be ruled out). 
8.1.2 Assessment of Adverse Events by the Investigator 
The Investigator will assess the severity (intensity) of each adverse event as mild, moderate, or 
severe, and will also categorize each adverse event as to its potential relationship to study drug 
using the categories of yes or no. 
Assessment of Severity: 
 Mild – An event that is easily tolerated and generally not interfering with normal daily 
activities. 
 Moderate – An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal daily activities. 
 Severe – An event that is incapacitating with inability to work or perform normal daily 
activities. 
Causality Assessment: 
The relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug is to be assessed 
according to the following definitions: 
 No (unrelated, not related, no relation) – The time course between the administration of study 
drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event rules out a causal relationship and 
another cause (concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, etc.) is suspected. 
 Yes (related) – The time course between the administration of study drug and the occurrence 
or worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal relationship and no other cause 
(concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, etc.) can be identified. 
The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. 
The following factors should also be considered: 
 The temporal sequence from study drug administration – The event should occur after the study 
drug is given. The length of time from study drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the 
clinical context of the event. 
 Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases – Each report should be evaluated in the context 
of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease the patient 
may have. 
 Concomitant drug – The other drugs the patient is taking or the treatment the patient receives 
should be examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event 
in question. 
 Known response pattern for this class of study drug – Clinical and/or preclinical data may 
indicate whether a particular response is likely to be a class effect. 
LIB Therapeutics, LLC 
Clinical Study Protocol LIB003-010 
Confidential & Proprietary 
Version 3.0, 18 March  2020 41  Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses – The exposure to stress might induce adverse 
changes in the recipient and provide a logical and better explanation for the event. 
 The pharmacology and PK of the study drug – The known pharmacologic properties 
(absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of the study drug should be considered. 
8.1.3 Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction 
An unexpected adverse drug reaction is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of 
which is not consistent with the applicable product information.  
8.2 Serious Adverse Events 
An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator 
or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death; 
 A life-threatening adverse event; 
o NOTE: An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening” if, in view of 
either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death. 
 Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalizations; 
o NOTE: Any hospital admission with at least 1 overnight stay will be considered an 
inpatient hospitalization. An emergency room visit without hospital admission will not be 
recorded as a SAE under this criterion, nor will hospitalization for a procedure scheduled 
or planned before signing of informed consent or elective treatment of a pre-existing 
condition that did not worsen from baseline. However, unexpected complications and/or 
prolongation of hospitalization that occur during elective surgery should be recorded as 
adverse events and assessed for seriousness. Admission to the hospital for social or 
situational reasons (ie, no place to stay, live too far away to come for hospital visits) will 
not be considered inpatient hospitalizations.  
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
 An important medical event. 
o NOTE: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalizations, or the 
development of drug dependency.

Version 3.0, 18 March  2020 42 8.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting − Procedures for Investigators 
Initial Reports 
All SAEs occurring from the time of informed consent until the end of study visit (Week 36/Early 
Termination) or the Follow-up Visit or 30 days after the last administration of study drug if the 
patient does not complete the study must be reported to Medpace Clinical Safety within 24 hours 
of the knowledge of the occurrence (this refers to any adverse event that meets any of the 
aforementioned serious criteria). All SAEs that the Investigator considers related to study drug 
occurring after the 30-day follow-up period must be reported to the Sponsor. 
Any SAE, regardless of expectedness or causality, should be reported by completing the adverse 
event eCRF form (when Serious = Yes) electronically in the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) 
system. When the form is completed, Medpace Clinical Safety will be notified electronically. If 
the event meets serious criteria and it is not possible to access the EDC system, e-mail or fax a 
completed paper back up-SAE form to the Medpace Clinical Safety contacts listed below within 
24 hours of awareness. When the EDC system becomes available, the SAE information must be 
entered into EDC within 24 hours of the system becoming available. Any supporting 
documentation (eg, patient discharge summary, hospital records, autopsy reports, etc) should be 
submitted to Medpace Clinical Safety via e-mail or fax. 
Safety Contact Information: Medpace Clinical Safety

Telephone: +1-800-730-5779, dial 3 or 513-579-9911, dial 3 
Fax: +1-866-336-5320 or 513-579-0444 
e-mail: medpace-safetynotification@medpace.com 
Follow-Up Reports 
The Investigator must continue to follow the patient(s) until the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment), or the patient 
dies. 
Within 24 hours of receipt of follow-up information, the Investigator must update the SAE form 
electronically in the EDC system for the study and submit any supporting documentation 
(eg, patient discharge summary or autopsy reports) to Medpace Clinical Safety via fax or e-mail. 
If it is not possible to access the EDC system, refer to the procedures outlined above for initial 
reporting of SAEs.   
8.4 Pregnancy Reporting 
If the patient or partner of a patient participating in the study becomes pregnant during the study 
or within 30 days of discontinuing study drug, the Investigator should report the pregnancy to 
Medpace Clinical Safety within 24 hours of being notified. Medpace Clinical Safety will then 
forward the Exposure In Utero form to the Investigator for completion.  
A patient becoming pregnant while on study drug will immediately be withdrawn from the study 
and Early Termination study procedures will be performed. 
The patient or partner should be followed by the Investigator until completion of the pregnancy. 
If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the Investigator should notify 
Medpace Clinical Safety.  At the completion of the pregnancy, the Investigator will document the 
LIB Therapeutics, LLC 
Clinical Study Protocol LIB003-010 
Confidential & Proprietary 
Version 3.0, 18 March  2020 43 outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate 
classification as an SAE (ie, postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal 
death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 
8.5 Expedited Reporting 
The Sponsor will report all relevant information about suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions that are fatal or life-threatening as soon as possible to the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) and in any case no later than 7 days after knowledge by the Sponsor of such a case, and 
that relevant follow-up information will subsequently be communicated within an additional 
8 days.  
All other suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the FDA as soon as 
possible but within a maximum of 15 days of first knowledge by the Sponsor.  
The Sponsor will also inform all Investigators as required.  
8.6 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical laboratory panels for lipids, hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis will be evaluated 
from samples collected after 10 hours of fasting (ad libitum water is allowed and encouraged) 
and prior to administration of LIB003 at the time points specified in Table 4 (Appendix A). 
A urine pregnancy test will be performed by the clinical site at Week 0 and the end of study visit 
(Week 52/Early Termination) only on women of childbearing potential. 
A complete list of laboratory analyses to be performed is presented in Appendix B. 
8.6.1 Potential Drug-Induced Liver Injury 
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver-related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI) event. All occurrences 
of potential DILIs that meet the following criteria, must be reported as SAEs: 
1. ALT or AST levels >3  ULN; 
2. Total bilirubin levels >2  ULN, without initial findings of Gilbert’s syndrome or cholestasis 
(elevated serum alkaline phosphatase); and 
3. No other immediately apparent possible causes of ALT or AST elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic or acute 
liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic. 
8.7 Immunogenicity  
Patients will be assessed for ADAs at designated study visits specified in Table 4 (Appendix A). 
Patients testing positive for LIB003 antibodies will be tested for NAbs and titer, and may be further 
characterized for isotype, binding site, affinity, and presence of immune complexes.  
Patients who test positive for binding, non-NAbs and have clinical sequelae at Week 52/Early 
Termination that are considered safety related may be asked to return for additional monthly 
follow-up testing.

to return for follow-up testing every 3 months until either NAbs are no longer detectable or the 
patient has been followed for a period of at least 12 months. During the initial 3 months of follow-
up patients may continue to receive LIB003 300mg Q4W for a potential total exposure of 64 weeks 
to further characterize the NAb response. 
8.8 Vital Signs 
Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature) will be assessed at 
designated study visits specified in Table 4 (Appendix A). Blood pressure and heart rate will be 
measured after the patient has been seated or supine for 5 minutes. 
8.9 Electrocardiograms 
Twelve-lead (single) ECGs will be assessed at designated study visits specified in Table 4 
(Appendix A). Patients should be resting in the supine position for 10 minutes prior to each 
12-lead ECG.  
8.10 Physical Examinations

6. A full chemistry and hematology panel as listed in Appendix B. 
7. Thyroid-stimulating hormone will be tested at Weeks 0 and 52/ET only. 
8. A brief chemistry panel as listed in Appendix B. 
9. Samples will be collected at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 28, 32, 40, 44, 48 and 52 for potential measurements of total and unbound (free) PCSK9. Total and unbound (free) 
PCSK9 will initially be measured at Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 52/ET and at additional visits where NAbs are detected. 
10. An expanded lipid panel as listed in Appendix B. 
11. A brief lipid panel as listed in Appendix B. 
12. Samples will be collected at all visits with ADAs measured initially at Weeks 0, 12, 24, 36 and 52. Patients who develop positive ADAs will have additional 
measurements at visits after the last negative measurement. Patients who test positive for binding non-NAbs and have clinical sequelae that are considered safety-related at 
the final visit (Week 52/ET) may be asked to return for additional monthly follow-up testing. If positive NAbs are detected at the final visit (Week 52/ET), patients will be 
asked to return for follow-up testing every 3 months until either NAbs are no longer detectable or the patient has been followed for a period of at least 12 months.  
13. Patients should be resting in the supine position for 10 minutes prior to each 12-lead ECG. 
14. Study drug (LIB003) will be administered at a SC dose of 300 mg. 
15. Injection site assessments will be performed pre-dose and 15 minutes post-dose. 
16. To be conducted only in those patients with positive NAbs at Week 52 who continue up to 12 additional weeks (3 additional doses Q4W). Following the first dose, if 
NAbs continue positive with possible attenuation of free PCSK9 and LDL-C, then up to 2 additional doses could be administered.  Urine pregnancy, physical examination 
and ECG will be assessed only at the last visit.  LIB003 will be administered at every Q4W visit.  
apo = apolipoprotein; ECG = electrocardiogram; ET = Early Termination; NAb = neutralizing antibody; PCSK9 = proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9; 
PK = pharmacokinetics; SC = subcutaneous.

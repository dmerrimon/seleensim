Resources
If this study is a collaborative UM/V A study, please clarify which resources are being used at each institution.
1 * Describe the time that the Principal Investigator will devote to conducting and completing the research:
30%
2 * Describe the facilities where research procedures are conducted:
University of Maryland, Baltimore research staff virtually enroll participants and collect survey data from ACTs Continuing Care Retirements Communities where
participants are living. ACTs Continuing Care Retirement Communities is a national organization that provides Medicare Part A skilled nursing benefit services and 11
communities are involved in the study. We plan to enroll patients throughout facilities located in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and/or Southeast Pennsylvania.
The PI will conduct data analysis at University of Maryland (UMB).
3 * Describe the availability of medical and/or psychological resources that subjects might need as a result of anticipated
consequences of the human research:
Participants are residents of a skilled nursing facility and have 24 hour access to nursing and healthcare resources. The risks to participants are minimal because the
study focuses on evidence-based assessment and management tools. Much of the data collected for the study is information that is similar (although more detailed) to
that which is already captured for standard of care clinical purposes. Patients who are able to self-report will be queried regarding their pain, function, and mood, but
again, this information is not outside the realm of what is collected for clinical purposes.
4 * Describe the process to ensure that all persons assisting with the research are adequately informed about the protocol, the
research procedures, and their duties and functions:
The PI oversees recruitment, enrollment, data collection, and alerts/adverse events. A NIH approved DSMP is in place.
All study staff are trained on the protocol and standard operating procedures and duties.
All study staff will complete the NIH required training in the participation and conduct of studies that involve human subjects.

Lay Summary
1 * Provide a summary of the background and purpose of the study in language that can be understood by a person without a
medical degree.
More than 30% of adults over age 65 receive care in nursing homes (NHs) under the Part A Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) benefit in the last six months of life.1
These patients often receive care that is focused on intense rehabilitation and/or aggressive, disease-modifying therapies with minimal consideration for palliative-
oriented care. 2-5 In addition to potential for poorer end-of-life (EOL) outcomes including undertreated pain and dyspnea, almost one quarter of SNF patients are
rehospitalized,6 putting them at risk for medication errors, burdensome treatments, pressure ulcers, and higher mortality. 7-9 Recent research suggests a significant
association between NH palliative care consultation (PCC) and lower rates of hospitalization and emergency room visits; the association is even stronger for those
receiving earlier PCC.10,11 Palliative care is patient and family centered care that incorporates symptom assessment and management and open communication and
documentation of patients/families goals of care and preferences for treatments. The most widely used and studied model of palliative care in NHs is hospice; however,
most patients receiving Medicare SNF benefits are not eligible for the Medicare Hospice benefit.12 PCC is a promising option in this setting, particularly because it allows
the concurrent use of rehabilitation and disease-modifying therapies; however, there is little research about the processes and outcomes of SNF PCC.13 Specifically,
multi-component palliative care interventions have not been rigorously studied in controlled trials. Using published guidelines for designing and pilot testing complex
interventions,14,15 this proposal aims to establish the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a SNF PCC intervention for patients with advanced serious illness.

Justification, Objective, & Research Design
 
 If you uploaded a separate research protocol document in the ‘Research Protocol’ page, cite the applicable
section and page numbers from that document in the answer boxes below.
1 * Describe the purpose, specific aims, or objectives of this research. State the hypothesis to be tested:
Overall objectives: The specific research aims are to: 1) Establish the feasibility and acceptability of the SNF-PCC intervention by determining: (a) percentage of all SNF
patients who meet eligibility criteria; (b) percentage of eligible patients who opt-out of participation; (c) percentage of participants who receive the SNF PCC and from
whom all data are collected; (d) clinician fidelity to the standardized SNF-PCC protocol (defined as 90% adherence to protocol elements), and (e) participant/family
caregiver satisfaction with the consult (acceptability), defined as ratings of 4 and 5 on the Consultation Satisfaction Questionnaire (1-5 scale; higher scores reflect greater
satisfaction); 2) Estimate the effect size of the SNF-PCC intervention on participant/family caregiver reported quality of life at baseline and follow-up (between 14-21 days
post baseline measurement) among 80 participants; and 3) Determine adherence to SNF-PCC recommendations at 15 days post SNF-PCC.
Primary outcome variable(s) Patient/Caregiver Quality of Life: Baseline, follow-up (14-21 days later) measured by the Palliative Outcomes Scale version 2 (POSv2), a 12
item survey that measures quality of life in five dimensions: 1) physical; 2) emotional; 3) psychological; 4) spiritual needs, and 5) provision of information and support.
Items scored on a 5 point Likert Scale (0=not at all, 4= overwhelmingly) based on symptom/need in the past week. Overall profile score is calculated by summing
responses to the 10 questions (range 0-40). Source: patient or family caregiver; Time to complete: 5-7 minutes.
Secondary outcome variable(s) 1) Palliative Care Consultation Satisfaction: within 15 days post-SNF-PCC; measured by Consultation
Page 10 of 18Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ). The CSQ is an 18 item patient/caregiver-report instrument that measures communication and satisfaction of a consult in
four domains 1) general satisfaction, 2) professional care, 3) depth of relationship, 4) perceived length of consultation (scale format: 5-point Likert, strongly agree to
strongly disagree). Source: patient or family caregiver; Time to complete: 3-5 minutes 2) Adherence to SNF-PCC recommendations: within 15 days post-SNF-PCC;
measured by: medical record review.
 
2 * Discuss the research design including but not limited to such issues as: probability of group assignment, potential for subject
to be randomized to placebo group, use of control subjects, etc.:
Pilot clinical trial with usual care control; 40 participants in each arm.
Aim 1 of this study is to establish the feasibility and acceptability of the SNF-PCC intervention.
Aim 2 of this study is to estimate the effect size of the SNF-PCC on the Palliative Outcomes Scale.
Aim 3 of this study is to determine overall adherence quantitatively as a percentage of all SNF-PCC recommendations that are implemented as well as adherence rates
for specific recommendations.
 
3 * Describe the relevant prior experience and gaps in current knowledge. Describe any relevant preliminary data:
Palliative care is goal-directed, patient and family-centered care that focuses on a wide range of physical, psychosocial, and spiritual needs for persons with serious, life-
limiting illnesses. Despite its association with improved quality of care, higher satisfaction, and better symptom management at the end of life, palliative care is not widely
available to Medicare patients in the Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) setting. We will test an evidence-based intervention derived from existing palliative care standards for
adults over age 60 with life limiting illness who are admitted to a nursing home for SNF care.
More than 30% of adults over age 65 receive care in nursing homes (NHs) under the Part A Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) benefit in the last six months of life.1
These patients often receive care that is focused on intense rehabilitation and/or aggressive, disease-modifying therapies with minimal consideration for palliative-
oriented care.2-5 In addition to potential for poorer end-of-life (EOL) outcomes including undertreated pain and dyspnea, almost one quarter of SNF patients are
rehospitalized,6 putting them at risk for medication errors, burdensome treatments, pressure ulcers, and higher mortality.7-9 Recent research suggests a significant
association between NH palliative care consultation (PCC) and lower rates of hospitalization and emergency room visits; the association is even stronger for those
receiving earlier PCC.10,11 The most widely used and studied model of palliative care in NHs is hospice; however, most patients receiving Medicare SNF benefits are
not eligible for the Medicare Hospice benefit.12 External PCC is a promising option in this setting, particularly because it allows the concurrent use of rehabilitation and
disease-modifying therapies; however, there is little research about the processes and outcomes of SNF PCC.13 Specifically, multi-component palliative care
interventions have not been rigorously studied in controlled trials. Using published guidelines for designing and pilot testing complex interventions,14,15 this proposal
aims to establish the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a SNF PCC intervention for patients with advanced serious illness.
 
4 * Provide the scientific or scholarly background, rationale, and significance of the research and how it will add to existing
knowledge:
This will be the first study to evaluate a PCC intervention specifically designed for SNF patients with advanced serious illness. The study also will be the first to
systematically evaluate adherence to PCC recommendations in the NH setting. Another novel component to this study is that identification of eligible patients upon
admission will promote timely access to palliative care. This is important because evidence from other settings suggests that earlier palliative care is associated with
better preparation for EOL, improved quality of life, fewer burdensome transitions and lower healthcare costs.10,36-38

Study Procedures
 
 If you uploaded a separate research protocol document in the ‘Research Protocol’ page, cite the applicable
section and page numbers from that document in the answer boxes below. (If this study is a collaborative UM/VA
study please list each procedure that is being conducted and the locations where it is being conducted.)
1 * Describe all procedures being performed for research purposes only (these procedures would not be done if individuals were
not in the study) and when they are performed, including procedures being performed to monitor subjects for safety or to
minimize risks:
In this pragmatic clinical trial, broadcast notification will be utilized to inform all newly admitted patients at each study site of their participation in this trial. During the
admission process, potential subjects will be provided with a 1-page summary sheet (Broadcast notification) detailing their participation in this study that will include
contact information for the study team, should the subject or their LAR elect to opt-out of participating. Baseline data will be collected virtually via telephone by asking
each newly admitted patient or their surrogate to complete the Patient Outcomes Scale (POSv2).
Between 14 days and 21 days after the baseline POS is administered, all subjects will be asked to complete the POSv2 again virtually via telephone. The POS will be
given a total of two times to those in the INTERVENTION and CONTROL groups; at baseline and follow up (14-21 days later). During this follow-up, subjects in the
INTERVENTION ARM who receive a palliative care encounter will also be asked to complete the Consultation Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) survey. The CSQ
measures the INTERVENTION group satisfaction and therefore will only be given to INTERVENTION group at follow up. The CONTROL group WILL NOT receive a
palliative care encounter therefore a consultation satisfaction questionnaire (CSQ) is NOT appropriate to administer.
Deidentified subject demographics will be collected on all participants in the following way: Research staff will review subject's medical records and enter de-identified
data into REDCap (ACTS Staff assists with research team access to subject's medical record).
The goal of the intervention is to prevent, identify and treat symptoms early in the course of SNF care, establish goal directed treatment decisions, and support the
patient and family in decision making. We anticipate that many Palliative care encounters involve a single encounter with the patient and/or surrogate decision maker, but
we have made allowances for follow up visits depending on individual patient and family needs (e.g., symptom management, continuing goals of care discussions). We
will use usual care as the control condition. Usual care consists of traditional resources focused on skilled nursing care without services to support specialty palliative
care. A usual care comparison will test whether the Palliative Care Encounter improves patient/family reported outcomes compared to traditional services. We have
chosen to not use an attention control condition because the goal of this pilot clinical trial is to assess feasibility and determine the effect size of the intervention on the
primary outcome.
Research staff will collect measures via phone or through a secured online template to minimize missing data at two time points (baseline & 14-21 days later) during the
study. All data will be entered and managed in a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database by the RA, project manager, or the PI.
Patient/Caregiver Quality of Life: Baseline, follow-up (14-21 days later) measured by the Palliative Outcomes Scale version 2 (POSv2), a 12 item survey that measures
quality of life in five dimensions: 1) physical; 2) emotional; 3) psychological; 4) spiritual needs, and 5) provision of information and support. (RESEARCH PROCEDURE)
Palliative Care Consultation Satisfaction: within 15 days post-SNF-PCC; measured by Consultation Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ). The CSQ is an 18 item
patient/caregiver-report instrument that measures communication and satisfaction of a consult in four domains 1) general satisfaction, 2) professional care, 3) depth of
relationship, 4) perceived length of consultation (scale format: 5-point Likert, strongly agree to strongly disagree) (RESEARCH PROCEDURE)
Palliative Care Encounter (STANDARD OF CARE)
Trained provider will discuss illness trajectories, establish and communicate patient-directed goals that guide health care decisions, identify and treat illness-related
symptoms, and identify psycho-spiritual needs and approaches to mitigate suffering.
 
2 * Describe all procedures already being performed for diagnostic or treatment purposes (if not applicable to the study, enter
"N/A"):
The Palliative Care encounter is Standard of Care.
 
3 * Describe the duration of an individual participant's participation in the study: 
Up to 21 days.
 
4 * Describe the amount of time it will take to complete the entire study:
Entire project is 12 months in length.
 
5 * Describe any additional participant requirements:

Sample Size and Data Analysis
If you uploaded a separate research protocol document in the ‘Research Protocol’ page, cite the applicable
section and page numbers from that document in the answer boxes below.
1 * Provide the rationale and sample size calculations for the proposed target population:
Sample Size and Power Calculations
The goal of Specific Aim 1 is to establish the feasibility of the post-acute Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Palliative Care (PC) intervention for patients with advanced
serious illness. Following guidelines on sample size selection for pilot studies by Hertzog et al.,1
40 per group is adequate for establishing feasibility and acceptability of a pilot study.
Specific Aim 2 of the study is to estimate an effect size for the SNF-PCC intervention on patient/family caregiver reported quality of life as measured by the Palliative
Outcomes Scale, whose reported estimated standard deviation is approximately 6.1.2 As such, group sample sizes of 40 each produce a two-sided 80% confidence
interval for the true mean measure of effect (difference in means) with a width of 3.4 units.

means, comparison of proportions, regressions, analysis of variance, etc.),  which is the primary comparison/analysis, and
how the analyses proposed will relate to the primary purposes of the study:
The primary analysis will be to compare the mean pre-post changes in the Palliative Outcomes Scale (POS) between the intervention and control arms. Linear
regression models will be used to compare the two groups. The within-arm changes and differences between arms will be summarized with two-sided 90% CIs and p-
values corresponding to tests against the null hypothesis of no (zero) change or difference. We will also explore subgroup effects of the intervention on endpoints by
testing for statistical interactions between the binary group indicator and covariates of interest such as sex, age, and race.
Other key parameters needed to plan a follow-up study will be estimated as well, including the standard deviation (SD) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of each
endpoint. The ICC summarizes the degree of correlation of values among patients within a site, which is an important parameter when planning a cluster randomized
controlled trial.

 Only select populations which you will be targeting for enrollment. Do not include populations that may be enrolled incidentally. Enrollment of a vulnerable
population is considered to be “targeted” if the study team will be aware that a subject is from a vulnerable group as a result of interaction with the subject
or collection of specific information about the subject, and the research team does not wish to exclude them. “Incidental” enrollment is limited to situations
where a study team is unaware that a subject is from a vulnerable group.

Vulnerable Populations - Cognitively Impaired
 
 You indicated that individuals who are cognitively impaired are included in this study.
 
1 * Describe how you will prevent undue coercion:
Although we may recruit persons with severe cognitive impairment, potential subject's legally authorized representative (e.g., surrogate) will be informed of the study with
an opportunity to opt-out prior to data collection.
 
2
* How will the capacity of these individuals to provide informed consent be assessed? How will you determine the need for a
legally authorized representative?
Decision making status can only be determined by the Acts Staff directly caring for potential participants receiving care at ACTS. If it is determined during the screening
process with Acts that the potentially eligible participant is not capable of independent decision making, if eligible the participant's legally authorized
representative/surrogate decision maker will be informed of the study and provided with an opportunity to ask questions and opt-out. Participants including residents and
LARs/surrogate decision makers can refuse to answer any surveys or refuse to take part in the palliative care encounter at any time as they can in usual care delivery.

Research Related Risks
If you uploaded a separate research protocol document in the ‘Research Protocol’ page, cite the applicable
section and page numbers from that document in the answer box below.
1 * Individually list each research-related risk, using a separate line for each.  Next to each risk, delineate the
likelihood/seriousness of the risk, and the provisions for minimizing the risk:
The risks to participants are minimal because the study focuses on evidence-based assessment tools. Much of the data collected for the study is information that is
similar (although more detailed) to that which is already contained in the medical record. SNF residents who are able to self-report will be queried regarding their pain,
function, and mood, but again, this information is not outside the realm of what is collected for clinical purposes.
There is a slight chance that confidential clinical information will be available to people who are not associated with the facility or the study; we will take steps to protect
confidentiality: notably, all data to be used for analysis and thereby captured in REDCap will be de-identified prior to entry. A key linking participant's identifying
information to their subject ID will be destroyed upon completion of data collection. Older individuals with life limiting illness in a nursing home are vulnerable and their
surrogate decision makers may elect to not opt-out of participation in this study because of a real or perceived benefit, hope for improvement in the condition, or to help
others.
We will keep all data confidential in accordance with state and federal laws. Data will not be linked to participant identifying name in the study database and will be kept
in secure computer files and locked filing cabinets. Participants will be further assured of their right not to answer particular questions when surveyed.
There is a potential risk of loss of privacy, however, study staff will take steps to ensure privacy and confidentiality during remote study activities. All virtual
communications - either with Acts staff, or study participants - will be conducted in a private space and research staff will ensure that those individuals they are
communicating with are also in a private setting during all privileged conversations.

Confidentiality of Data
 
1 * Will stored research data contain identifiers or be able to be linked to and identify individual participants (either directly or
through a code/research ID)?
 Yes
 No, the data will be stored de-identified/anonymous (stripped of all identifiers, no way to identify individual participants)
 
2 * Where will research data be kept (address electronic and paper data as applicable)? (If this is a VA study please list specific
sites that data will be kept.)
Precautions will be taken to protect participant confidentiality and the privacy of individuals participating in the study. We will keep all data confidential in accordance with
state and federal laws. Data will not be linked to participant identifying name in the study database. Upon implementation of this protocol, a key will be used for linking
each subject to their assigned subject ID. This key will be stored in REDCap, separate from the primary REDCap database used for data collection. The project manager
and PI will be the only personnel with access to this key. Each subject's Participant ID, date of admission to the skilled nursing facility (SNF) and their corresponding
Subject ID will be the only variables stored in this key. Data Management and Security: Subject data extracted from the Acts EMR as described in the Procedure section -
once queried and scrubbed of identifying information - will be manually entered into REDCap by research staff remotely via remote access while remaining off-site in
adherence with COVID-19 restrictions.
All data collected for this study will be managed using REDCap (http://www.projectredcap.org) which is a secure, web-based application. which is a secure, web-based
application. The University of Maryland, Baltimore is a member of the REDCap consortium and this application is freely available to consortium members. REDCap
provides: 1) an intuitive interface for data entry (with data validation); 2) audit trails for tracking data entry and changes; 3) automated export procedures for seamless
data downloads to common statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R); 4) procedures for importing data from external sources; and 5) advanced features, such as
branching logic and calculated fields. To maximize quality control, I will train the research assistant/project manager in all data collection and entry procedures. I will have
access to all data upon entry into REDCap. The research assistant/project manager will monitor data collection by checking completed questionnaires for completeness
and referring back to me as needed. I will utilize double data entry methods on a 10% random sample, with checks for discordant errors, and as data are entered into the
REDCap system

2 * Why is the PHI necessary for this research?
If SSNs are going to be used, describe the specific use and type of SSN to be used (real, scrambled, last 4 digits).
PHI is necessary so research staff can contact participant and collect data. We need to view this information for screening, enrollment and data collection purposes. Data
will not be linked to participant identifying name in the study database and will be kept in secure computer files and locked filing cabinets.
We are requesting to move all records housed at UPENN RedCap to UMB RedCap database which includes ACTs IDs, dates, deidentified medical records, ages,
telephone numbers
 
3 * What is the source(s) of the PHI?
We will be given this information by Acts staff. The PI will also view redacted medical records.
 
4 * Provide written assurance that Protected Health Information will not be reused. (Note: this refers to re-use on another study
or for a purpose which has not been approved, not to the re-use of screening data during the current study).
We will adhere to HIPAA regulations that govern us as University of Maryland, Baltimore researchers as well as Acts Retirement-Life Communities. Since all of the work
of the study is done remotely, we will protect privacy by administering surveys virtually and ensuring participants have a private, quiet space in which to complete
surveys.

Waiver/Alteration of Authorization
You indicated that a waiver/alteration of authorization is requested.
1 * Provide rationale for how the research presents no more than minimal risk to the privacy of individuals:
Participants can expect the same level of privacy they receive during usual health care.
We will adhere to HIPAA regulations that govern us as University of Maryland researchers as well as Acts Retirement-Life Communities.
During remote communications, Acts staff will facilitate subject privacy by ensuring participants have a private, quiet space in which to complete surveys virtually.
2 * Describe the plan to ensure the protection of PHI collected during this study from improper use and disclosure:
We will keep all data confidential in accordance with state and federal laws. Data will not be linked to participant identifying name in the study database.
Upon implementation of this protocol, a key will be used for linking each subject to their assigned subject ID. This key will be stored in REDCap, separate from the
primary REDCap database used for data collection. The project manager and PI be the only personnel with access to this key. Each subject's Participant ID, date of
admission to the SNF and their corresponding Subject ID will be the only variables stored in this ke y.
Data Management and Security regarding subject data extracted from the Acts EMR as described in the Procedure section: once queried and scrubbed of identifying
information manually entered into REDCap by research staff via remote access.
3 * Describe the plan to destroy the PHI collected during this study at the earliest opportunity consistent with the conduct of the
research. If there is a need to retain PHI, provide a justification:
A key linking participant's identifying information to their subject ID will be destroyed upon completion of data collection.
4 * Why could the research not practicably be done without access to and use of this PHI?
Waiver for recruitment: We need the PHI in order to screen participants for eligibility.
HIPAA alteration to obtain verbal authorization: We cannot do the study without their PHI after they are enrolled because we still need to follow up with the resident or
LAR. We need to administer the baseline and follow up surveys at the designated timepoints and their names and numbers are needed to contact them. Their ACTs ID
are needed so Dr. Carpenter can complete the fidelity checks and link the participant to the UMB subject ID. The research staff records the participants' names, but they
will not be entered in the RedCap database. This done since we destroy names after they complete the study.
5 * Why could the research not practicably be done without the waiver or alteration?
(1) Palliative care consultation is standard of care and a low risk intervention;
(2) the waiver will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; hospice/palliative care are already being offered in this site and this trial seeks to increase
the opportunity for residents and their surrogates to benefit from palliative care , while not restricting choice to forego it because it is not offered:
(3) The research cannot be practicably conducted without a waiver as the trial will evaluate system-level implementation of an evidence-based intervention; requiring
prospective written informed consent would introduce important selection biases greatly reducing the knowledge generated; and (4) to the extent possible, the subjects
will be provided with pertinent information after participating in the trial.
These answers are also applicable to applicable for the HIPAA alteration.
6 * Will the subjects' PHI be disclosed to (or shared with) any individuals or entities outside of UM?
  Yes No
6.1 If Yes, describe the individuals or entities outside of UM to whom PHI will be disclosed.

Informed Consent Process
 
 
If the study does not involve interaction with participants or a waiver of consent is being requested , answer
“N/A” to the questions below.
 
1 * Indicate the type(s) of consent that will be involved in this study: (check all that apply)
 Not applicable (study may qualify as exempt)
 Request to Waive Consent/Parental Permission (Consent is not being obtained)
 Request to Alter Consent (Some Elements of Consent Waived)
 Request to Waive Documentation of Consent (Verbal/Oral Consent)
 Written Consent Form
 Electronic Consent
 
2 * Describe the Informed Consent process in detail:
We will use broadcast study notification to all new admissions by placing a poster at the common areas of the facility as well as a copy of the broadcast study
notification within the standard admissions paperwork (this provides a way for the patient or their legally authorized representative to receive a written statement of
the research). The use of broadcast study notification as well as the proposed broadcast study notification statement/flyer (included in this submission) has been
approved by Acts (the participating nursing home).
Study staff will consult virtually with ACTS staff to determine eligibility and contact recently admitted potential participants via telephone. If the potential participant
meets eligibility criteria, research staff will contact potential participants (eligible patients or the LAR/surrogate decision makers of eligible patients) by phone to
explain the purpose of the study and read information sheet.
 
3 * Confirm that the consent process will explain the following: 
    • The activities involve research.  
    • The procedures to be performed.  
    • That participation is voluntary.  
    • The name and contact information for the investigator. 
  Yes No 
 
4 * Describe who will obtain Informed Consent:
The PI, Co-I, or a trained study team member.
 
5 * If obtaining consent from a legally authorized representative (LAR), describe how you will confirm that the individual is the
LAR and can provide legally effective informed consent. (Answer "N/A" if not obtaining consent from LARs)
We can confirm that the individual is the LAR because we have been given the contact information by a designated Acts staff member who is involved in the
resident’s admission and overall care. Research staff asks the designated person at ACTS if the resident can make his/her own decisions. If they answer no, then
ACTS provides the LAR’s name for research staff to contact via phone .
 
6 * Describe the setting for consent:
via telephone in the private location of the subjects choosing.
 
7 * Describe the provisions for assessing participant understanding:
The subjects will be asked if they understand the purpose of the research and that they have the right to not answer any questions or stop their participation in the
research at any time.
 
8 * Describe the consideration for ongoing consent:
Continuation and completion of surveys will provide implied consent.

Waiver of Documentation of Consent
 
 You indicated that a waiver of documentation of consent (verbal/oral consent) is requested.
 
1 * Indicate why a waiver of documentation of consent is being requested for the study:
The only record linking the subject and the research would be the consent document, and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of
confidentiality.
The research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects, and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required
outside of the research context.
 
2 * Provide a justification/explanation for the choice above:
The risks to participants are minimal because the study focuses on evidence-based assessment tools. Much of the data collected for the study is information that is
similar (although more detailed) to that which is already contained in the medical record. Skilled nursing facility (SNF) residents who are able to self-report will be queried
regarding their pain, function, and mood, but again, this information is not outside the realm of what is collected for clinical purposes.

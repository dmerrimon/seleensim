Protocol Title: A Phase 3, Randomized Open -label Study of Pembrolizumab (MK -3475) 
Plus Olaparib Versus Abiraterone Acetate or Enzalutamide in Participants with Metastatic 
Castration- resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Who are Unselected for Homologous 
Recombination Repair Defects and Have Failed Prior Treatment with One Next -generation 
Hormonal Agent (NHA) and Chemotherapy (KEYLYNK -010)
Short Title: Phase 3 Study of Pembrolizumab Plus Olaparib Versus A biraterone Acetate or 
Enzalutamide in mCRPC
Acronym: KEYLYNK -010
Hypotheses, Objectives ,and Endpoints :
In men with mCRPC, unselected for homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene 
mutations, whose disease has progressed during prior NHA treatment and chemotherapy :
NOTE: As of Amendment 06,participants who are still on study treatment and deriving 
clinical benefit will no lo nger have tumor response assessments by BICR. However, local 
tumor imaging assessments should continue per SOC schedule. In addition, ePRO
assessments will no longer be performed and biomarker samples willno longer be collected. 
Updated analyses are descr ibed in Section 9.
Primary Objectives Primary Endpoints

weeks later if there is PSA decline from 
baseline, or 2) ≥25% increase and 
≥2ng/mL increase from baseline beyond 
12 weeks if there is no PSA decline from 
baseline.
Time to first SSRE: the time from 
randomization to the first symptomatic 
skeletal -related event, defined as:

Duration of 
ParticipationEach participant will be receiving assigned intervention for approximately 
2years. After the end of treatment , each participant will be followed for at 
least 30 days.
Each participant will participate in the study from the time the participant 
signs the Informed Consent Form (ICF) through the final protocol -specified 
contact.
Each participant will be assigned to receive study intervention until disease 
progression is radiographically documented and verified by BI CRper PCWG -
modified RECIST 1.1 guidelines , unacceptable adverse event(s) (AEs), 
intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, 
investigator’s decision to discontinue the participant, noncompliance with 
study intervention or procedure requirements or administrative reasons 
requiring cessation of treatment, or until the participant has received 35 cycles
of pembrolizumab (approximately 2 years). Participants who stop study 
intervention after receiving 35 cycles of pembrolizumab for reasons other than 
disease progression or intolerability, or participants who attain a complete 
response (CR) and stop study intervention may be eligible for up to 17 
additional cycles of pembrolizumab (approximately 1 year) upon experiencing 
disease progression ( Section 6.6.7 )if they meet the criteria for retreatment 
(Second Course phase) and the study is ongoing (Section 6.6.7) .

After the en d of treatment, each participant will be followed for the 
occurrence of AEs and spontaneously reported pregnancy of female partner as 
described under Section 8.4.5.
Participants who discontinue for reasons other than radiographic disease 
progression will h ave post -treatment follow -up imaging for disease status 
until disease progression is documented radiographically per PCWG -modified 
RECIST 1.1 and verified by BICR , initiating a non- study cancer treatment, 
withdrawing consent, or becoming lost to follow -up.All participants will be 
followed for overall survival until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of 
the study.
Once the participant has achieved the study objective or the study has ended, 
the participant is discontinued from this study.

2 INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer represents the second most common malignancy diagnosed in men 
worldwide, with an incidence of over 1,000,000 cases and >300,000 deaths annually [Ferlay, 
J., et al 2015] . In the US, approximately 1 in every 9 men will be diagnosed with prosta te 
cancer in his lifetime [Siegel, R. L., et al 2018] .
While many men diagnosed with locally confined disease may be treated definitivel y with 
radiation or surgery, those who go on to develop or are diagnosed with metastatic prostate 
cancer, an incurable entity, are typically treated first with androgen deprivation therapy 
(ADT), usually with a gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagon ist that 
results in suppression of testosterone production in the testes. This alone often succeeds in 
controlling disease, often for many years. W hen prostate cancer progresses despite ADT 
alone ,it is called castration -resistant. The disease a t this poin t is known as mCRPC, and 
systemic therapies must be added to re-establish control of disease. A number of important 
systemic therapies for m CRPC now compose the current therapeutic landscape. These 
include the next -generation hormonal agents (NHAs), abirat erone acetate and enzalutamide, 
and the taxanes, docetaxel and cabazitaxel.
Abiraterone acetate is an androgen biosynthesis i nhibitor that inhibits 17 α hydroxylase/C17,
20-lyase (cytochrome P450 [CYP]17). This enzyme is expressed in testicular, adrenal, and 
prostatic tumor tissues and is required for androgen biosynthesis. The efficacy and safety of 
abiraterone acetate with prednisone was established in 2 Phase 3 randomized ,
placebo -controlled clinical studies [Ryan, C. J., et al 2013] [Fizazi, K., et al 2012] [Ryan, C. 
J., et al 2015] .
Enzalutamide is an endocrine agent currently used for treatment of mCRPC. Enzalutamide 
treatment was studied in random ized clinical trials in participants with mCRPC before 
chemotherapy and found to result in superior OS versus control therapy (placebo and 
prednisone, respectively) [Beer, T. M., et al 2014] .
Docetaxel became the first systemic therapy to improve survival for men with mCRPC. A
randomized study demonstrated superior survival of median 18.9 months versus 16.5 for 
mitoxantrone [Tannock, I, et al 2004] . Cabazitaxel, a second taxane, was studied versus 
mitoxantrone in participants who had received docetaxel, and it too was found to be 
associated with superior survival (median 15. 1 months versus 12.7 months for mitoxantrone) 
[de Bono, J. S., et al 2010] . However, cabazitaxel can be a toxic therapy, and 4.9% of 
participant s died of various treatment -related causes, such as treatment- related neutropenia 
and treatment -related diarrhea. The cabazitax el label contains a black box warning regarding 
risks from neutropenia, severe hypersensitivity, and other label warnings and precautions 
pertaining to diarrhea, renal failure, hepatic impairment, and prohibitive risk in patients ≥65 
years of age. Thus, an un met need remains for patient s after treatment in the mCRPC setting 
with targeted endocrine therapy and docetaxel.

2.1 Study Rationale
Interim results from Cohort A in KEYNOTE -365 (data cutoff 27-J UL-2018), which 
evaluated the population intended for the current study, suggested promising clinical efficacy 
and potential synergistic effects in participants with mCRPC ,as evidenced by a confirmed 
biochemical response ( ≥50% reduction in PSA from baseline) in12.8% (95% confidence 
interval [ CI]4.3%, 27.4%) of the 39 participants with elevated PSA at baseline. In addition, 
over 50% of participants had a r eduction in PSA from baseline. An OR (CR or PR) per 
RECIST 1.1 was observed in 7.1% (95% CI 0.9% ,23.5%) ofthe 28 participants with 
measurable disease at baseline , including 2 participants with PR and none with CR. Disease 
control rate ( DCR )for all participants in this cohort was 56.1% (95% CI 39.7% , 71.5%). 
Notably, none of these participants had a known or suspected deleterious mutation in genes 
associated with HRR .
These results provide support for further evaluation of the combination of pembrolizumab 
and olaparib in patients with mCRPC unselected for HRR gene mutation.
Human cancers show genomic instability and an increased mutation rate due to underlying 
defects in DNA repair. T hese deficiencies render cancer cells more dependent on the 
remaining DNA repair pathways, and targeting these pathways is expected to have much 
greater impact on the survival of tumor cells than on normal cells. This study will evaluate 
the antitumor effect of olaparib, a potent polyadenosine 5' diphosphoribose (polyADP ribose) 
polymerization ( PARP )inhibitor , in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of
mCRPC regardless of deficiencies in the HRR pathway.  
Limited data are available for patients with mCRPC who have not responded to an NHA and 
at least 1 taxane -based chemotherapy. In general ,responses to treatment decrease with more 
lines of prior thera py, while differences in baseline prognostic factors still confer 
heterogeneity in response as measured by rPFS and OS. In 260 patients with mCRPC treated 
with abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, or cabazitaxel, median OS was 10 to 15 months 
(average 11 months) for third -line treatment and 4 to 7 month s (average 5 months) for 
fourth- line treatment [Caffo, O., et al 2015] .  
Accordingly, there remains a high unmet medical need for an efficacious, well tolerated 
therapy for patients with mCRPC, including tho se who have not responded to an NHA and 
chemotherapy.
This clinical study will study the combination of the PARP inhibitor olaparib and 
pembrolizumab in the treatment of participants with mCRPC who have failed to respond to 
either abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide (but not both) and to chemotherapy. Participants 
will be rando mly assigned in a 2:1ratio to treatment with either pembrolizumab and olaparib 
or with abiraterone acetate (if previously treated with enzalutamide) or enzalutamide (if 
previously treated with abiraterone acetate).

2.2 Background
Pembrolizumab
Pembrolizumab i s a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) with high specificity of binding to the pr ogrammed cell death 1 (PD -1) receptor, thus 
inhibiting its interaction with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD- L1) and programmed cell 
death l igand 2 (PD -L2). Based on preclinical in vitro data, pembrolizumab has high affinity 
and potent receptor blocking activity for PD -1. Pembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical 
safety profile and is in clinical development as an intravenous ( IV)immunother apy for 
advanced malignancies. Keytruda® (pembrolizumab )is indicated for the treatment of patients 
across a number of indications. F or more details on specific indications, refer to the 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB) .
Olaparib
Olaparib (AZD2281 ;KU-0059436) is a potent PARP inhibitor (PARP1, 2, and 3) that is 
being developed as an oral anticancer therapy, both as monotherapy (including maintenance) 
and for combination with chemotherapy and other anticancer agents.
PARP inhibition is a novel appro ach to targeting tumors with deficient DNA repair 
mechanisms. PARP enzymes are essential for repairing DNA single strand breaks (SSBs). 
Inhibiting PARPs leads to the persistence of SSBs, which are then converted to the more 
serious DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) during DNA replication. During cell division, 
DSBs can be efficiently repaired in normal cells by HRR . Tumors with homologous repair 
deficiency (HRD ), such as ovarian cancers in patients with breast cancer susceptibility gene 
1/2 (BRCA1/2 ) mutations (BRCAm), cannot accurately repair the DNA damage, which may 
become lethal to cells as it accumulates. In such tumor types, olaparib may offer a potentially 
efficacious and less toxic cancer treatment compared with currently available chemotherapy 
regimens.
Olaparib traps the inactive form of PARP on DNA at sites of SSBs, thereby preventing their 
repair [Helleday, T. 2011] [ Murai, J., et al 2012] . Olaparib has demonstrated efficacy in 
ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic tumors with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and has shown 
proof of concept in tumors with ataxia -telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) and other indicators of 
HRD. The specificity of olaparib for binding PARP at the replication fork during DNA 
replication is believed to have applicability to tumors associated with HRR mutations.
Refer to the IBand approved labeling for detailed back ground information on olaparib.
2.2.1 Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background
Inhibition of PD -1 as a Target for Cancer Therapy
The importance of intact immune surveillance function in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformations has been known for decades [Disis, M. L. 2010] . Accumulating evidence 
shows a correlation between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes in cancer tissue and favorable 
086YCG

MK-7339 -010-06FINAL PROTOCOL 02-MAY -2022
prognosis in various malignancies. In particular, the presence of cluster of differentiation 
(CD)8+ T- cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T -cells/FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells (T -regs) 
correlates with improved prognosis and long -term survival in solid malignancies, such as 
ovarian, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, malignant melanom a, 
and renal cell carcinoma. Tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes can be expanded ex vivo and 
reinfused, inducing durable objective tumor responses in cancers such as melanoma [Dudley, 
M. E., et al 2005] [Hunder, N. N., et al 2008] .
The PD -1 receptor -ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress 
immune control. The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated 
T-cells under healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwa nted or excessive immune 
responses, including autoimmune reactions. PD-1 (encoded by the gene Pdcd1) is an 
immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily member related to CD28 and cytotoxic T -lymphocyte -
associated protein 4 (CTLA -4) that has been shown to negatively reg ulate antigen receptor 
signaling on engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2) [Greenwald, R. J., et al 2005] 
[Okazaki, T., et al 2001] .
The structure of murine PD -1 has been resolved [Zhang, X., et al 2004] . PD- 1 and its family 
members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig -variable –type (IgV -type) 
domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail responsible for binding 
signaling molecules. The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, 
an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based 
switch motif. After T-cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases, SH P-1 and 
SHP-2, to the immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif within its cytoplasmic tail, 
leading to dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3 zeta (CD3ζ), protein kinase 
C-theta (PKCθ), and zeta chain -associated protein kinase (ZAP70), which are involved in the 
CD3 T -cell signaling cascade [Okazaki, T., et al 2001] [Chemnitz, J. M., et al 2004] 
[Sheppard, K -A, et al 2004] [Riley, J. L. 2009] . The mechanism by which PD -1 down -
modulates T- cell responses is similar to, but distinct from, that of CTLA -4, because both 
molecules regulate an overlapping se t of signaling proteins [Parry, R. V., et al 2005] 
[Francisco, L. M., et al 2010] . As a consequence, the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway is an attractive 
target for therapeutic intervention in mCRPC.
Inhibition of PARP as a Target for Cancer Therapy
PARP1 and PARP2 are zinc -finger DNA -binding enzymes that play a critical role in DNA 
repair [Ame, J. C., et al 2004] by sensing DNA damage and converting it to intracellular 
signals that activate the base excision repair and SSB repair pathways. When a break in DNA 
occurs, PARP enzymes are recruited to and bi nd at the end of the broken DNA strands, 
initiating their enzymatic activity. PARP subsequently catalyzes the addition of long 
ADP -ribose polymers to several other proteins associated with chromatin (eg, PARP, 
histones, DNA repair proteins), resulting in chromatin relaxation, rapid recruitment of DNA 
repair proteins, and efficient repair of the break.
Under normal conditions, HRR is the preferred pathway for repairing DNA damage, as it is 
associated with a lower rate of errors compared with ot her forms of DNA repair [Prakash, R., 
et al 2015] . During DNA replication (S phase), pre -existing or chemotherapy- induced SSBs 
086YCG
PRODUCT: MK-7339 48
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-06
MK-7339 -010-06FINAL PROTOCOL 02-MAY -2022
are converted to DSBs if not adequately repaired by intracellular mechanisms [Fong, Peter 
C., et al 2009] , such as HRR. C ells unable to perform HRR (eg, due to inactivation of genes 
required for homologous recombination, such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 ) are more likely to use 
the error -prone nonhomologous end -joining (NHEJ) or alternative (alt) -NHEJ pathways to 
repair these DSBs, and risk accumulating multiple lesions or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) 
due to an increase in deletions and accompanying genomic instability. Over time, 
accumulation of excessive DNA errors in combination with inability to complete S phase (ie, 
because of stalled replication forks due to presence of a PARP inhibitor), leads to cell death, 
showing that PARP inhibition is synthetic lethal in the context of BRCA mutations [Farmer, 
H., et al 2005] [Bryant, H. E., et al 2005] . Cells without SSBs or with intact HRR, such as 
those in somatic tissue, replicate normally in the presence of a PARP inhibitor, thereby 
minimizing toxicity.
Homo logous Recombination Repair in Solid Tumors
Defects in DNA repair drive the genesis of several solid tumors, most notably ovarian and 
pancreatic. D NA strand breaks occur both as part of the recombination and replication 
process and after intercalating chem otherapy or DNA -damaging radiotherapy. HRR defective 
tumors are intrinsically sensitive to PARP inhibitors, both in tumor models in vivo 
[Rottenberg, S., et al 2008] [Hay, T., et al 2009] and in the clini c [Fong, Peter C., et al 2009] 
[Tutt, A., et al 2010] [Mateo, J., et al 2015] [Kaufman, B., et al 2015]. The main mechanism 
of action of olaparib results from trapping of inactive PARP on SS Bs preventing their repair 
[Helleday, T. 2011] [Murai, J., et al 2012] and excessive conversion of SSBs to the more 
serious DSBs, which are lethal or results in incomplete/inaccurate repair of the damaged
strands, leading to LOH with subsequent aberrant protein translation and function. 
Normally, the process of HRR corrects DSBs using proteins such as BRCA1 and BRCA2. 
However, the HRR armamentarium includes proteins coded by at least 13 other genes, 
including ATM , BARD1 , BRIP1 , CDK12 , CHEK1 , CHEK2 , FANCL , PALB2 , PPP2R2A , 
RAD51B, RAD51C , RAD51D , and RAD54L . For example, the protein coded by the ATM
gene also is involved i n the repair of DSB. A TM is activated by DSB and phosphorylates 
diverse cellular proteins (eg, mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1, checkpoint kinase 2) 
leading to cell cycle arrest, activates the tumor suppressor p53, contributes to chromatin 
relaxation a nd remodeling, and activates nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of 
activated B -cells (NF -κB). Defective ATM increases the risk of breast, gastrointestinal, lung, 
and lymphoid cancers. Moreover, defective ATM appears to correlate with a poor prognosi s; 
however, the resulting risk has not been quantified. 
A small percentage of tumors have loss of function mutations in HRR genes, with BRCA1 , 
BRCA2 , and ATM the best characterized and most frequently mutated [Watkins, J. A., et al 
2014] [Marquard, A. M., et al 2015] [Choi, M., et al 2016] [Lord, C. J. 2016] . Approximately 
half the HRRm detected are germline mutations [Mateo, J., et al 2015] . While an adverse 
prognostic impact of germline BRCA2 mutations has been described in prostate cancer 
[Castro, E., et al 2015] , it is less clear if other germline or somatic HRR gene mutations are 
associated with similar adverse clinical outcomes. To date, HRRm has not been associated 
with specific patient or tumor characteristics.

Overview of Prostate Cancer
Prostate cancer repr esents one of the most frequently diagnosed malignancies andis the fifth
leading cause of cancer -related deaths and the second most frequently diagnosed cancer in 
men worldwide [Torre, L. A., et al 2015] . According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 
[Fitzmaurice, C., et al 2018] , there were 1.4 million new prostate cancer cases and 381,000 
deaths from the disease globally in 2016. These statistics suggest the great socioeconomic 
burden prostate ca ncer imposes worldwide. In the US, analysts estimated that there would be 
164,690 new cases of prostate cancer ( 19% o f all new cancer cases in males ) and 29,430
deaths caused by prostate c ancer (9 % of all new cancer deaths in males ) in 2018 [Siegel, R. 
L., et al 2018] . Since the advent of PSA screening about 3 decades ago, the prostate cancer 
death rate had been falling until it stabilized between 2013 and 2015 [Negoita, S., et al 2018] . 
However , following the US .Preventive Services Task Force’s recommendation in 2012
against routine PSA -based scr eening regardless of age , the incidence of late -stage disease has 
increase d [Negoita, S., et al 2018] . Furthermore, it is estimated that 1 in 9 men in the US will 
be diagnosed with prostate cancer in his lifetime [Siegel, R. L., et al 2018] . Although 
identifying cause sand effects is difficult, this change in the national trend in late -stage 
prostate cancer incidence may portend future increases in the number of men requiring 
treatment f or advanced disease. Therefore ,there is an urgent need t o develop new therapeutic 
strategies, including combination therapies ,for prostate cancer.
Unmet Medical Need in Prostate Cancer
Patients with mCRPC have a high unmet medical need. The prognosis for men diagnosed 
with locally confined disease is favorable , and such cases may be treated definitively with 
radiation therapy or surgery [Gray, P. J., et al 2017] . In fact, prostate cancer has been a prime 
example of an indolent cancer, with the majority of men found to have localized disease at 
diagnosis [Loeb, S., et al 2015] . For that reason, in the last decade physicians have 
increasingly adopted active surveillance as a management option for low -risk prostate cancer, 
reflecting the low rate of disease progression and enthusiasm for avoiding harm ( eg, 
incontinence and impotence) associated with overtreatment [Loeb, S., et al 2015] [Resnick, 
M. J., et al 2013] . Additionall y, metastatic prostate cancer evolves molecularly during 
disease progression and/or therapy through adaptive response, which may result in 
emergence of histologic variants that are biologically more aggressive and resistant to 
therapy [Vlachostergios, P. J., et al 2017] .
Androgen signaling mediated through androgen receptors is a critical factor for promotion 
and growth of prostate cancer [Knudsen, K. E. 2010] . Therefore, until 2015 the SOC for 
initial first -line therapy for metastatic prostate cancer (either recurrent or de novo metastatic 
tumors, heretofore called castration -sensitive prostate cancer [CSPC]) was ADT (eg, GnRH 
agonists or antagonists). H owever, a great stride in treatment of CSPC was made over the last 
few years. Two randomized, controlled studies , Chemohormonal Therapy Versus Androgen 
Ablation Randomized Study for Extensive Dise ase in Prostate Cancer (CHAARTED 
[Sweeney, C. J., et al 2015] ) and Systemic Therapy in Advancing or Meta static Prostate 
Cancer (STAMPEDE [James, N. D., et al 2017] ) demonstrated significant survival benefit 
with the addition of docetaxel to ADT.

MK-7339 -010-06FINAL PROTOCOL 02-MAY -2022
In a 2018 follow -up CHAARTED analysis [Kyriakopoulos, C. E., et al 2018] , investigators 
extended the original median duration of fo llow-up from 28.9 months to 53.7 months and 
confirmed the median OSadvantage in the ADT plus docetaxel group with high -volume 
disease (51.2 versus 34.4 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.72; 95% CI 0.59, 0.8 9; p=0.0018) . In 
the similar comparison in the STAMPEDE study, researchers recommended that docetaxel 
become part of the SOC after a 43- month follow -up found superior results with it against 
ADT in median OS (81 v ersus 71 months; HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.66, 0.93; p=0.006).
As part of the STAMPEDE study, participants were randomized to receive ADT and 
abiraterone acetate plus pred nisolone or ADT alone. P articipants in the former arm had a 
significantly higher rate of OSat 3 years (83% v ersus 76%; HR for death 0.63%; 95% CI 
0.52, 0.76; p<0.001) and signifi cantly fewer treatment failure events ( 248versus 535; 
HR0.29; 95% CI 0.25, 0.34; p<0.001). Findings were similar in the LATITUDE study
[Fizazi, K., et al 2017] . At a planned IAin the LATITUDE study at 30.4 months, there was
significantly longer OS in the group receiving ADT and abi raterone than in the group 
receiving ADT and placebo (not reached versus 34.7 months; HR for death 0.62; 95% CI 
0.51, 0.76; p<0.001) [Fizazi, K., et al 2017] [Sartor, O. 2018] .
While these therapies are initially effective, patients with metastatic prostate cancer 
invariably develop a lethal disease stage known as mCRPC and su ccumb to their disease. 
Though a number of imp ortant therapies have been approved since 2004 to treat mCRPC , no 
available guidance recommends appropriate sequencing or combining of these therapies, and 
none is curative.
Despite these recent advances, treatment options for men with mCRPC progressing af ter 
next-generation (second- generation) hormonal therapy and docetaxel are limited and provide 
only a modest survival benefit. In the TROPIC Phase 3 study [de Bono, J. S., et al 2010] , 
investigators compared cab azitaxel, a second -generation semisynthetic tubulin- binding 
taxane, with mitoxantrone (each in combination with prednisone) for mCRPC progressing 
during or after docetaxel -based therapy, and detected a significant improvement in median 
OSin the cabazitaxe l group (15.1 months [95% CI 14.1, 16.3] versus 12.7 months [95% CI 
11.6, 13.7]; HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.59, 0.83]; p<0.0001). Also, cabazitaxel maintained its 
antitumor activity after treatment with docetaxel and abiraterone or docetaxel and 
enzalutamide [Pezaro, C. J., et al 2014] . However, cabazitaxel can be a toxic t herapy , and 
consequently it is not widely used. Retrospective studies sug gest that either abiraterone or 
enzalutamide may be an option; howeve r, previous therapies [Handy, C. E. 2016] , potential 
for development of cross -resistance [Zhang, T., et al 2015] , and potential for emergence of a 
more aggressive form of prostate cancer after prolonged treatment [Roubaud, G., et al 2017]
must be considered and could be limiting factors. Additionally, conse nsus guidelines, such as 
those from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [National Comprehensive 
Cancer Network 2015] , recommend that men with mCRPC be encouraged to participate in 
clinical studies. Thus, there remains an unmet medical n eed for patients with mCRPC and
disease progression after treatment with a next -generation hormonal therapy and/or 
docetaxel -based chemotherapy.

Preclinical and Clinical Studies
Refer to the pembrolizumab and olaparib IBs for summaries of preclinical and clinical 
experience with pembrolizumab and olaparib, respectively.
Pembrolizumab in mCRPC
Participants wit h PD -L1 positive mCRPC were treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy in 
the Phase 1b study, KEYNOTE-0 28 (Cohort E3: advanced [unresectable and/or metastatic] 
prostate adenocarcinoma) . The primary endpoi nt was objective response rate ( ORR )
according to RECIST 1.1, determined by investigator review. Twenty- three participants with 
PD-L1 positive mCRPC (defin ed by PD -L1 expression in >1% of tumor or stromal cells) 
were enrolled and treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy. All received at least 1 prior
antineoplastic therapy, and 17 (73.9%) and 7 (30.4%) received 2 or more or 5 or more lines 
of therapy, respecti vely. Of the 23 participants, only 1 remained on treatment at the time of 
the last published analysis [Hansen, A. R., et al 2018] . Twenty- one participants (91.3%) had 
1 or more postbaseline PSA determinations; 5 of these participants (23.8%) had a PSA 
decline of ≥ 50%. There were 4 confirmed PRs according to RECIST 1.1 guidelines, for an 
ORR at the time of 17.4% (95% CI 5.0%, 38.8%) . Responses were durable (median duration 
of response [DOR ]13.5 months) and treatment was well tolerated.
Ongoing Clinical Studies in mCRPC
2.2.1.8.1 Pembrolizumab
KEYNOTE -199was designed to further evaluate the positive signal of activity seen in
KEYNOTE -028, with pembrolizumab monotherapy in participants with mCRPC who had 
previously received docetaxel -based chemotherapy and undergone abiraterone acet ate or 
enzalutamide treatment. The ORR was 4.5% in participants with measurable disease by 
RECIST 1.1 and previous chemotherapy (Cohorts 1 and 2 ) at the IA2 with a data cuto ff date 
of 13-O CT-2017. H owever, the DCR suggested durab le responses, regardless of PD -L1 
status, that warranted further evaluation. Additionally, early unpubli shed results suggest a 
potential survival benefit in the advanced mCRPC population with pembrolizumab 
monotherapy [Graff, J. N., et al 2016] .
Graff et al [Graff, J. N., et al 2016] initially enrolled 10 men in 2015 and 2016 with mCRPC 
and evidence of progression on enzalutamide, and subsequently enrolled a total of 28.
Because of failur e of immunotherapies (nivolumab andipilimumab ) to produce objective 
responses in mCRPC in previous studies [Topalian, S . L., et al 2012] [Kwon, E. D., et al 
2014] , interest in pursuing further studies waned. Nonetheless, after some suc cess, Graff et al 
undertook the Phase 2 study ,adding p embrolizumab to enzalutamide in men with mCRPC ,
and reported a decline in PSA (pri mary endpoint) of ≥50% in 5 of 28 participants (17.9%) 
and an ORR (secondary end point) in 3 of 12 participants (25.0%) with measurable disease at 
baseline. A t the last report, 3 of the 5 respond ers continued to respond (range 21.9 to 33.8 
months), and medi an OSwas 22.2 months ( 95% CI 14.7, 28.4 months).

2.2.1.8.2 Olaparib
Olaparib received an FDA breakthrough therapy designation in January 2016 as a treatment 
for patients with BRCA1/2 or ATM mCRPC who have received prior taxane -based 
chemotherapy and at least 1targeted hormonal agent (enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate). 
This designation was based on data from the Phase 2 Trial of PARP Inhibition in Prostate 
Cancer (TOPARP -A) that demonstrated an ORR of nearly 90% for olaparib monotherapy in 
a biomar ker-defined subgroup of participants with DNA repair defects [Mateo, J., et al 
2015] . Participants were considered biomarker -positive if homozygous deletions or 
deleterious mutations were identified in a gene reported to b e involved either in DNA 
damage repair or sensitivity to PARP inhibition. Next -generation sequencing identified 
homozygous deletions, deleterious mutations, or both in DNA repair genes in 16 of 49 
participants (33%). Of these 16 participants , 14 (88%) had a response to olaparib, using a 
composite endpoint of RECIST 1.1 response, a decline in PSA ≥50% f rom baseline, or a 
reduction of circulating tumor cells ( CTCs ) from ≥ 5 cells per 7.5 mL of blood to ≤5 cells per 
7.5mL of blood. This included all 7 participants with BRCA2 loss and 4 of 5 with ATM
aberrations. Defects in DNA repair genes were noted in 33% of the 49 evaluable participants. 
The overall prevalence of BRCA2 genomic aberrations was 6% in this cohort of unselected 
participants, and 10% of participa nts were found to have aberrations in the ATM gene. 
Whereas onl y 3% of participant s without tumor genomic DNA repair alterations had a PSA 
response to olaparib, 63% of participant s with tumor genomic DNA repair alterations did. In 
TOPARP -A, Grade 3 or 4 AEs were primarily anemia (20%), fatigue (12%), leukopenia 
(6%), thrombocytopenia (4%), and neutropenia (4%). Th irteen of the 50 treated participant s 
(26%) required a twice daily dose reduction to 300 mg from the initial dose of 400 mg, and 3 
of these requir ed a second dose reduction to 200 mg . Six percent of participant s permanently 
discontinued olaparib because of AEs. The average del ivered dose intensity was 87%.
The impressive response rate of 88% in biomarker -positive mCRPC is being further 
evaluated in the PROfound study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), a randomized Phase 3 study evaluating 
olaparib in participants with mCRPC and a deleterious homologous recombination DNA 
repair (HRR) aberration. The stud y is evaluating olaparib versus abiraterone acetate or 
enzalutamide (physician ’s choice) in participant s whose disease progressed when they were 
treated with a new hormonal agent. Participant s are to be randomized 2:1 to olaparib or to 
enzalutamide or abiraterone, stratif ied based on tumor aberration (C ohort A with mutations 
inBRCA1, BRCA2, orATM versus Cohort B with 1 or more of 12 other genes with 
aberrations). The primary en dpoint of the study is rPFS in C ohort A, using RECIST 1.1 (soft 
tissue) and PCWG3 (bone) criteria . Key secondary efficacy endpoints include confirmed 
ORR, TTPP , OS (all C ohort A), and rPFS (both coh orts).
Additionally, olaparib as a treatment of mCRPC has been evaluated in combination with 
abiraterone in a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase 2 study [Clarke, N., et al 
2018] . Investigators randomized 142 participants to olaparib and abiraterone (N =71) or 
placebo and abiraterone (N =71). They found a difference of 5.6 months in the median rPFS 
(olaparib group: rPFS 13.8 months; 95% CI 10.8 to 20.4 months; plac ebo group: rPFS, 
8.2months; 95% CI 5.5 to 9.7 months) and observed a n HR of 0.65 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.97; 
p=0.034), regardless of HRR mutation status. AEs of Grade 3 or higher were more frequent

(4[6%] versus 3 [4%]), and myocardial infarction (4 [6%] versus 0). S erious adverse events 
(SAEs) were repor ted by 24 participant s (34%) receiving olaparib ( 7 events were re lated to 
treatment) and 13 participant s (18%) receiving placebo (1 was related to treatment). One

The targeted endocrine therapies, abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide, are potent, orally 
available treatment options with a favorable tolerability profile that have replaced docetaxel 
as preferred first -line therapy for mCRPC [Sartor, O. 2018] . Abiraterone acetate and 
enzalutamide were investigated in randomized clinical studies in participants with mCRPC 
before chemotherapy and were found to result in superior OS versus control therapies 
(placebo and prednisone, respectively) and prolonged time t o chemotherapy initiation [Ryan, 
C. J., et al 2013] [Beer, T. M., et al 2014]. M edian OS was approximately 3 years with early 
initiation of abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide treatment [Ryan, C. J., et al 2013] [Beer, T. 
M., et al 2014] , but this is still a greatly reduced life expectancy compared with
approximately 15 years for age -matched men (approximately 70 years of age) in the general 
US population (https://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/population/longevity.html ). Once 
patients with mCRPC have failed to respond to abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide, the 
benefit from approved therapeutic options appears to be substantially diminished, and no 
currently approved agent has been developed for treatment of mCRPC after an NHA and 1 or 
more subsequent lines of therapy .
2.3 Benefit/Risk Asse ssment
It cannot be guaranteed that participants in clinical studies will directly benefit from 
treatment during participation, as clinical studies are designed to provide information about 
the safety and effectiveness of an investigational medicine.
Pembrolizumab has been administered to a large number of cancer patients with a well 
characterized safety profile and has received regulatory approval for multiple malignancies.
Overall, pembrolizumab is well tolerated at doses up to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks.
Pembrolizumab has also demonstrated anticancer clinical activity and efficacy in a broad 
range of cancer indications (refer to the current pembro lizumab IB).
Single -agent olaparib has been registered in the US for treatment of deleterious or suspected 
delet erious germline BRCA -mutated advanced ovarian cancer in patients who have received 
3 or more prior lines of chemotherapy for maintenance treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer 
and for deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA -mutated, HER -2 negativ e 
metastatic breast cancer after prior chemotherapy.

Preliminary results from Cohort A of KEYNOTE -365 (Section 2.1), in whic h participants 
have received a combinat ion of pembrolizumab and olaparib show a DCR of 56.1%. In this 
cohort, >50 % of participants h ad a reduction in PSA from baseline . Twenty -eight of 
41participants ( 68.3%) experienced a Grade 3 to 5 AE, and 23of 41 (56.1 %) experienced 
SAEs.
Abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide have been approved by regulatory agencies globally 
for treatment of mCRP Candhave been recommended for treatment of mCRPC in the 
guidelines of the NCCN and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) [Parker, 
C., et al 2015] .
NOTE: Based on the data from an IAof safety and efficacy for KEYLYNK -010 (data cutoff 
18-JAN-2022), the eDMC recommended stopping the study for futility because it was 
extremely unlikely that the efficacy boundary for study success would be reached at the next 
(final) analysis. In addition, the e DMC indicated that continuing the trial raised the risk of 
undue toxicities (Grade 3 to 5 
AEs and d rug-related SAE s) to participants receiving 
investigational therapy which were greater in the investigational arm compared with control. 
Based on these data and the recommendation of the eDMC , the study was unblinded ( as of 
11-MAR -2022). The prespecified final analysis of the study described in the statistical 
analysis plan (SAP) will not be performed. 
Selected analyses of safety endpoint swill be performed at the end of the study . There will be 
no further analyses of efficacy and PRO endpoints .

4 S TUDY DESIGN
4.1 Overall Design
NOTE: Based on the data from an IAof safety and efficacy for KEYLYNK -010 (data cutoff 
18-JAN-2022), the eDMC recommended stopping the study for futility because it was 
extremely unlikely that the efficacy boundary for study success would be reached at the next 
(final) analysis. In addition, the 
eDMC indicated that continuing the trial raised the risk of 
undue toxicities (Grade 3 to 5 AEs and d rug-related SAE s) to parti cipants receiving 
investigational therapy which were greater in the investigational arm compared to control.
This is a randomized, active -controlled, parallel -group , multi- site,open -label study of 
pembrolizumab plus olaparib versus abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide in participants with 
mCRPC.
After a screening phase of u p to 42 days, approximately 780 eligible participants will be 
randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to 1 of the f ollowing 2 study intervention arms:
Arm 1: p embrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W plus olaparib (as tablets) 300mg BID
Arm 2: abiraterone acetate 1000 mg once daily ( QD)plus prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg 
BID (in participants previously treated with enzalutamide) ORenzalutamide 160 mg 
QD(in participants previously treated with abiraterone acetate) 
There will be no crossover between treatment arms.
Before randomization, participants will be stratif ied by prior NHA treatment (abiraterone
acetate versus enzalutamide) and presence of measurable disease (yes v ersus no). Of 
participants randomized to the comparator arm (Arm 2), those previously treated with 
abiraterone acetate will receive enzalutamide, and those previously treated with enzalutamide 
will receive abiraterone acetate.
Participants must have had progressive disease ( PD)during or after treatment with 
abiraterone acetate orenzalutamide (but not both) and 1 previous chemotherapy (docetaxel)
regimen. P rior treatment with enzalutamide or apalutamide in the hormone -sensitive setting 
is not allowed. P rior treatment with apalutamide or darolutamide is also not allowed. 
Participants must provide tumor tissue from a fresh core or excisional biopsy (obtained 
within 12 months of screening) from soft tissue not previously irradiated .Samples from 
tumors progressing at a prior site of radiation are allowed; other exceptions may be 
considered after Sponsor consultation. Participants with bone -only or bone -predominant 
disease may provide a bone biopsy sample. However, if obtaining a fresh biopsy sample is 
not feasible, participants may provide an archival tumor tissue sample after Sponsor 
consultation. A dequacy of these sp ecimens for biomarker analysis will be evaluated by a 
centra l laboratory before randomization. F or complete details of the eligibility criteria, refer 
to Section 5.

Treatment wit h pembrolizumab may cont inue for up to 35 cycle s (approximately 2years 
starting with the first infusi on ofCycle 1) or until a criterion for discontinuation of study 
intervention (Section 7.1) ismet. Treatment with olaparib or with abiraterone acetate or 
enzalutamide will proceed continuously from Da y 1 of Cycle 1, unless a criterion for 
discontinuati on of study intervention (Section 7.1) ismet.
In this study, an independent eDMC will monitor safety and efficacy (Section 10.1.4.2). 
Response to study intervention will be evaluated with radiologic imag ing (whole -body bone
scans and computed tomography [ CT]/magnetic resonance imaging [ MRI ]scans of the chest, 
abdomen, and pelvis) every 9 weeks for approximately 1 year (through Week 54) and every 
12 weeks thereafter. R adiographic progress ion will be deter mined according to PCWG -
modified RECIST 1.1 (Section 8.2.1).
This study will use a group -sequential design. There will be 2 planned IAs. The final OS 
analysis will take place when at least 482 OS events (target number of OS events) have been 
observed. To maintain sufficient minimal follow -up duration, the f inal a nalysis should be 
conducted at least 12 months after the last participant israndomized. There will be only 1
progression -free survival ( PFS)analysis , at the time of IA1 when at least 360 rPFS events 
and 241 OS events (target number of OS events) have been observed. The results of the IAs
will be reviewed by the eDMC, which will provide recommendations for the study in 
accordance wit h the eDMC Charter and the SAP ( Section 9).
Participants who attain an investigator -determined confirmed CR may receive up to 35 cycles
of pembrolizumab. If a participant with radiographic progression is clinically stable or 
clinically improved, an excepti on to continue study intervention may be considered, on
consultation with the Sponsor. Participants showing clinical benefit in the study will be 
allowed to c ontinue study intervention regardless of any decision to stop enrollment or 
suspend the study.
AEs will be monitored throughout the study and graded in severity according to the 
guidelines outlined in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. After the end of treatment, each participant will be 
followed for 30 days for AE monitoring. S AEs will be collected for 90 days after the end of 
treatment or 30 days after the end of treatment if the participant initiates new anticancer 
therapy, whichever is earlier. Treatment -related SAEs must be repor ted regardless of the time 
point when they occur. Participants who discontinue treatment for reasons other than 
radiographic disease progression will stay in the study and continue study -related disease 
assessments until radiographic disease progression, i nitiating a non -study cancer treatment, 
participant discontinuation from the study, or becoming lost to follow -up. A ll participants 
will be followed for survival. This will be performed in a variety of ways ,including by 
telephone, e -mail, chart review, or review of public records ,in compliance to local practices 
or regulations.

Second Course Treatment : 
NOTE: As of Amendment 06, the study will be stopped due to futility and second 
course treatment is not an option for participants. There are currently no participants 
in the Second Course Phase.
Participants receiving pembrolizumab in combination with olaparib who stop study 
intervention with stable disease ( SD)or better may be eligible for up to17 additional cycles 
(approximately 1 year) of pembrolizumab (Second Course phase) if they have BICR -verified 
PDafter stopping study intervention and the study is ongoing (Se ction 6.6.7). The decision to 
retreat with pembrolizumab will be at the discretion of the investigator ,only if no anticancer 
treatment was administered since the la st dose of pembrolizumab, the participant still meets 
the safety parameters listed in the inclusion/e xclusion criteria, and the study remains open.
Olaparib may be continued at the investigator ’s discretion.
The risks of solid organ transplant after treatment with PD -1 inhibitor therapy have not been 
extensively studied. The timeframe for safe or appropriate solid organ transplantation after 
the last dose of pembrolizumab is unknown. Therefore, it is recommended not to perform 
solid organ transplantation within at least 120 days (5 half -lives) of stopping pembrolizumab. 
The risks and benefits of transplant should be discussed with the participant by t he treating 
investigator.
Specific procedures to be performed during the study, as well as their prescribed times and 
associated visit windows, are outlined in the SoA in Section 1.3. Details of each procedure 
are provided in Section 8.
4.2 Scientific Rational e for Study Design
This trial is a randomized open- label study. B ased on interim data from Cohort A of 
KEYNOTE -365 (Section 2.1), the present study was developed to evaluate the efficacy of 
the combination of pembrolizumab and olaparib in participants who have not responded to 
abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide and to chemotherapy.
The effect of a PARP inhibitor as monotherapy is sensitive to biomarker positivity in prostate 
cancer. A case in point is the ORR of nearly 90% in a biomarker -defined subgroup of 
participants with DNA repair defects in the TOPARP -A study [Mateo, J., et al 2015] . Of 16 
participants in this subgroup, 14 (88%) had a response to olaparib, using a composite 
endpoint of OR , PSA response, or a reduction of CTCs. However ,only 2 of 33(6.1%) had a 
response to olaparib in the biomarker -negative subgroup, and the median survival time in this 
subgroup was only 7.5 months. For pembrolizumab monotherapy, in KEYNOTE -199, 
although ORR was 4.5% in participants with measurable disease (Cohorts 1 and 2), survival 
data were encouraging in the first 3 cohorts whose disease progressed on 1 NHA and 1 
taxane -based chemotherapy (median OS 9.6 months). In KEYNOTE -365 Cohort A, which 
evaluated the population intended for study MK-7339 -010 (none with DNA repai r defects), 
DCR was 56.1% at the median follow -up of 11.4 months. The median survival time was 
approximately 13.5 months. Therefore, clinical benefit from the combination of 
pembrolizumab and olaparib is far beyond that which would be expected from either drug as

a single agent, especially for olaparib in patients with mCRPC unselected for DNA repair 
defects.
4.2.1 Rationale for Endpoints
Efficacy Endpoints
The dual primary endpoints of the study will be OS and rPFS. O verall survival has been 
recognized as the gold standard for demonstration of superiority of a new antineoplastic 
therapy in randomized clinical studies.
Radiographic PFS is an acceptable measure of clinical benefit for a late -stage study that 
demonstrates superiority of a new antineoplastic therapy, especially if the magnitude of the 
effect is large and the therapy has an acceptable risk/benefit profi le. R adiographic PFS w ill 
be assess ed by BICR according to PCWG -modified RECIST 1.1 (Section 8.2).
Time to initiation of the first subsequent anti cancer therapy (TFST) or death will be assessed 
as a key secondary endpoint. Adelay in the need to initiate the next anti cancer therapy is 
clinically meaningful for patients an d an important goal of any anti cancer thera py. T FST is 
supportive of rPFS, as it incorporates reasons to switch therapies in addition to ra diographic 
progression (eg, due to toxicity or clinical progression), thus providing a comprehensive 
measure of when an agent is considered no longer of clinical ben efit.
Safety Endpoints
Safety parameters frequently used for evaluating investigational systemic anticancer 
treatments are included as safety endpoints, including, but not limited to, the incidence of, 
causality, and outcome of A Es/SAEs, and changes in vit al signs and laboratory values. AEs 
will be assessed as defined by CTCAE Version 4.0.
Patient -reported Outcomes
Symptomatic improvement is considered a clinical benefit and accepted by health authorities 
as additional evidence of the risk- benefit profile o f any new study intervention. In this study, 
health- related quality of life (HRQoL) and disease -related symptoms will be investigated via 
the following assessment tools: the FACT -P and BPI -SF questionnaires. Health utilities will 
be evaluated using the EQ -5D-5L PRO instrument. PRO instruments will be administered by 
trained site personnel and completed electronically by participants in the following order: 
FACT -P and EQ- 5D-5L (both completed at the site) ,andBPI-SF(completed at home) . 
These measures are n ot pure efficacy or safety endpoints because they are affected by both 
disease progression and treatment tolerability. The FACT -P is a disease -specific 39- item 
questi onnaire included to assess HRQoL and prostate cancer -specific symptoms. It is a well -
estab lished measure of HRQoL/health status frequently used in prostate cancer clinical 
studies. The FACT- P was developed specifically for patients with advanced prostate cancer 
and has been found to be reliable and valid in th is population [Esper, P., et al 1997] .

The EQ -5D-5Lis a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome and will 
provide data to develop health utilities for use in health economic analyses [Rabin, R. 2001] . 
This instrument has been used extensively in cancer studies and published results from these 
studies support its validity and reliability [Pickard, A. S., et al 2007] .
The BPI -SF is a validated 15- item domain -specific instrument designed to assess the severity 
of pain and the impact/interference of pain on daily function [Cleeland, C. S. and Ryan, K. 
M. 1994] .
The Analgesic Log will be used to capture all analgesic medication dosages and dose times. 
Both the BPI -SF and the Analgesic Log will be completed over 7 consecutiv e days (eg, 
Days 15 to 21) at each scheduled timepoint after randomization .
Planned Exploratory Biomarker Research
PARP inhibitors and cancer immunotherapies represent important classes of antitumor 
agents. However, the mechanism of action of these exciting new therapies is not completely 
understood and much remains to be learned regarding how best to leverage these dr ugs in 
treating patients. Thus, to aid future patients, it is important to investigate the determinants of 
response or resistance to cancer therapy and other treatments administered, as well as 
determinants of AEs in the course of our clinical studies. The se efforts may identify novel 
predictive/pharmacodynamic biomarkers and generate information that may better guide 
single -agent and combination therapy. To identify novel biomarkers, biospecimens (ie, blood 
components, tumor material, tissue material) will be collected to support analyses of cellular 
components (eg, protein, DNA, RNA, metabolites) and other circulating molecules. 
Investigations of biomarkers that correlate with response or resistance to treatment may 
include but are not limited to :
Germline (blood) genetic analyses (eg, SNP analyses, whole exome sequencing, whole 
genome sequencing)
This research may evaluate whether genetic variation within a clinical study population 
correlates with response to the treatment(s) under evaluation. If genetic variation is found to 
predict efficacy or AEs, the data might inform optimal use of therapies in the patient 
population. Furthermore, it is important to evaluate germline DNA variation across the 
genome in order to interpret tumor -specific DNA mutations. I n addition to studying variation 
across the human genome, mutations in DNA damage repair genes including, but not limited 
to BRCA1 , BRCA2, ATM , BARD1 , BRIP1 , CDK12 , CHEK1 , CHEK2 , FANCL , PALB2 , 
PPP2R2A , RAD51B, RAD51C , RAD51D , and RAD54L as well as genome scars including 
LOH may be investigated. B ased on data from participants in several olaparib studies in 
multiple cancer types, known or suspected deleterious mutations in these genes and LOH 
may be predictive of a response to the combina tion of olaparib and pembrolizumab .Finally, 
microsatellite instability (MSI) may be evaluated as this is an important biomarker for some 
cancers (ie, colorectal cancer).

Genetic (DNA) analyses from tumor
The application of new technologies, such as next generation sequencing, has provided 
scientists the opportunity to identify tumor -specific DNA changes (ie, mutations, methylation 
status, microsatellite instability). Key molecular changes of interest to oncology drug 
development include the mutational burd en of tumors and the clonality of T -cells in the 
tumor microenvironment. Increased mutational burden (sometimes referred to as a ‘hyper -
mutated’ state) may generate neo -antigen presentation in the tumor microenvironment. To 
conduct this type of research, i t is important to identify tumor -specific mutations that occur 
across all genes in the tumor genome. Thus, genome -wide approaches may be used for this 
effort. Note that in order to understand tumor -specific mutations, it is necessary to compare 
the tumor genome with the germline genome. Microsatellite instability may also be evaluated 
as this is an important biomarker for some cancers (ie, colorectal cancer). Circulating tumor 
DNA and/or RNA may also be evaluated from blood samples.
Tumor and blood RNA anal yses
Both genome -wide and targeted messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiling and 
sequencing in tumor tissue and in blood may be performed to define gene signatures that 
correlate to clinical response to treatment. Specific immune -related gene sets (ie, tho se 
capturing interferon- gamma transcriptional pathways) may be evaluated and new signatures 
may be identified. Individual genes related to the immune system may also be evaluated (eg, 
IL-10). MicroRNA profiling may also be pursued as well as exosomal profi ling.
Proteomics and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using blood or tumor
Tumor, tissue, and blood samples from this study may undergo proteomic analyses (eg, PD -
L1 IHC). PD -L1 protein level in tumor sections, assessed by IHC, has been shown to 
correlate with r esponse to pembrolizumab in patients with NSCLC, and an in vitro diagnostic 
(IVD) device has been developed for use with pembrolizumab in NSCLC. Preliminary data 
indicates that this association may also be true in additional cancer types (ie, triple negati ve 
breast cancer, head and neck, and gastric). Additional tumor or blood -derived proteins may 
also correlate with response to olaparib and pembrolizumab. Therefore, tumor tissue may be 
subjected to proteomic analyses using a variety of platforms that could include but are not 
limited to immunoassays and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. This approach could 
identify novel protein biomarkers that could aid in patient selection for olaparib (MK -7339) 
and pembrolizumab (MK -3475) therapy.
Other biomarkers
In addition to expression on the tumor tissue, other tumor derived cells, proteins and 
DNA/RNA can be shed from tumor and released into the blood. Assays such as enzyme -
linked immunoassay (ELISA) that measure proteins and assays that measure cell -free 
DNA/RNA (cfDNA/cfRNA) may also be evaluated from blood samples. Correlation of these 
biomarkers with response to treatments may identify new approaches for predictive 
biomarkers in blood, representing a major advance from today’s reliance on assessing tumor 
biomarkers. This research would serve to develop such assays for future clinical use.

Other molecular changes of interest include the subtype of T -cells in the tumor 
microenvironment. The T -cell repertoire from tumor tissue and blood components may be 
evalu ated.
4.2.1.4.1 Planned Genetic Analysis
Genetic variation may impact a participant’s response to therapy, susceptibility to, severity, 
and progression of disease. Variable response to therapy may be due to genetic determinants 
that impact drug absorption, distribut ion, metabolism, and excretion; mechanism of action of 
the drug; disease etiology; and/or molecular subtype of the disease being treated. Therefore, 
where local regulations and IRB/IEC allow, a sample will be collected for DNA analysis 
from consenting part icipants.
DNA samples may be used for research related to the study intervention(s), the disease under 
study, or related diseases. They may also be used to develop tests/assays including diagnostic 
tests related to the disease under study, related diseases , and study intervention(s). Genetic 
research may consist of the analysis of 1 or more candidate genes, the analysis of genetic 
markers throughout the genome, or analysis of the entire genome. Analysis may be 
conducted if it is hypothesized that this may h elp further understand the clinical data.
The samples may be analyzed as part of a multi -study assessment of genetic factors involved 
in the response to understand study disease or related conditions.
Future Biomedical Research
The Sponsor will conduct FBR on specimens for which consent was provided during this 
study. This research may include genetic analyses (DNA), gene expression profiling 
(ribonucleic acid [RNA]), proteomics, metabolomics (serum, plasma), and/or the 
measurement of other analytes, depend ing on which specimens are consented for FBR .
Such research is for biomarker testing to address emergent questions not described elsewhere 
in the protocol (as part of the main study) and will only be conducted on specimens from 
appropriately consented part icipants. The objective of collecting/retaining specimens for 
FBR is to explore and identify biomarkers that inform the scientific understanding of 
diseases and/or their therapeutic treatments. The overarching goal is to use such information 
to develop saf er, more effective drugs/vaccines, and/or to ensure that participants receive the 
correct dose of the correct drug/vaccine at the correct time. The details of this FBR are 
presented in Appendix 6.
4.2.2 Rationale for the Use of Comparators
There is no SOC therap y for patients with mCRPC who se disease progressed through both 
NHA and taxane -based chemotherapy. Cabazitaxel, a second taxane, can be a toxic therapy . 
Also, patient s progressing during docetaxel treatment or becoming intolerant to docetaxel -
related toxic ities are unlikely to receive cabazitaxel and require a different treatment 
modality. Most patients with mCRPC have bone metastases, and specifically directed 
radium -223 dichloride is not applicable for patient swith visceral metastatic diseas e.

Although e fficacy of a second NHA after failure of the fir st is limited based on retrospective 
studies, it is a reasonable therapy choice.
The effect of olaparib monotherapy is sensitive to biomarker positivity ( BRCA1/2 or ATM
mutated) in prostate cancer. In the TOPARP -A study [Mateo, J., et al 2015] ,the response rate 
was 88% in the biomarker -positive subgroup of participants with DNA repair defect s, but 
only 6.1% in the biomarker -negative subg roup. The median rPFS and OS for olaparib were 
9.8 months a nd 13.8 months, respectively, in the biomarker -positive subgroup. I n con trast, 
the median rPFS and OS for olaparib were only 2.7 and 7.5 months ,respectively, in the 
biomarker -negative subgroup. G iven the cu rrent clinical evidence for efficacy of olapari b 
monotherapy in biomarker -positive mCRPC patients and the lack thereof in the 
biomarker -negative population, testing olaparib monotherapy in an unselected HRR
wild-type mCRPC population would not be ethical.
4.3 Justification for Dose
4.3.1 Pembrolizumab
The planned dose of pembrolizumab for this study is 200 mg Q3W. Based on the totality of 
data generated in the Keytruda development program, 200 mg Q3W is the appropriate dose 
of pembrolizumab for adults across all indications and regardless of tumor type. As outlined 
below, this dose is justified by the following:
Clinical data from 8 randomized studies demonstrating flat dose -and 
exposure- efficacy relationships from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks 
(Q2W).
Clinica l data showing meaningful improvement in benefit -risk relationship, including 
OSat 200 mg Q3W across multiple indications.
Pharmacology data showing full target saturation in both systemic circulation 
(inferred from PK data) and tumor (inferred from physi ologically based PK [PBPK] 
analysis) at 200 mg Q3W.
Among the 8 randomized dose -comparison studies, a total of 2262 participants were enrolled 
with melanoma and NSCLC , covering different disease settings (treatment naïve, previously 
treated, PD- L1 enriched, and all -comers) and different treatment settings (monotherapy and 
in combination with chemotherapy). Five studies compared 2 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg 
Q3W ( KEYNOTE -001 Cohort B2, KEYNOTE -001 Cohort D, K EYNOTE -002, K EYNOTE -
010, and KEYNOTE -021), and 3 studies compared 10 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W 
(KN001 Cohort B3, KN001 Cohort F2 ,and KEYNOTE -006). All these studies demonstrated 
flat dose -and exposure -response relationships across the doses studied, representing an 
approximate 5 -to 7.5- fold diffe rence in exposure. Adose of 2 mg/kg (or 200 mg fixed dose) 
Q3W provided similar responses to the highest doses studied. Subsequently, flat dose -and 
exposure- response relationships were observed in other tumor types, including head and neck 
cancer, bladde r cancer, gastric cancer ,and classical Hodgkin lymphoma, confirming 200 mg 
Q3W as the appropriate dose independent of tumor type. These findings are consistent with

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-06
MK-7339 -010-06FINAL PROTOCOL 02-MAY -2022
the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab, which acts by interaction with immune cells and 
not via direct binding to cancer cells.
Additionally, pharmacology data clearly show target saturation at 200 mg Q3W. First, PK 
data in K EYNOTE -001 evaluating target -mediated drug disposition conclusively 
demonstrated saturation of PD -1 in systemic circula tion at doses much lower than 200 mg 
Q3W. Second, a PBPK analysis was conducted to predict tumor PD -1 saturation over a wide 
range of tumor penetration and PD -1 expression. This evaluation concluded that 
pembrolizumab at 200 mg Q3W achieves full PD -1 satur ation in both blood and tumor.
Finally, population PK analysis of pembrolizumab, which characterized the influence of 
body weight and other participant covariates on exposure, has shown that fixed dosing 
provides similar control of PK variability to weight -based dosing, with considerable overlap 
in the distribution of exposures from the 200 mg Q3W fixed dose and the 2 mg/kg Q3W 
dose. S upported by these PK characteri stics, and given that fixed dosing has advantages of 
reduced dosing complexity and reduced po tential of dosing errors, the 200 mg Q3W fixed 
dose was selected for evaluation across all pembrolizumab protocols.
4.3.2 Olaparib
The dose of olaparib used in this study is 300 mg BID (tablet formulation), which is the 
currently approved dose. Refer to Section 6.6.2 and the approved labeling for detailed

screening visit through the duration (days)after the last dose of study intervention listed 
in inclusion criterion #12.
5.3 Lifestyle Considerations
5.3.1 Meals and Dietary R estrictions
Participants receiving pembrolizumab in combination with olaparib should avoid grapefruit, 
grapefruit juice, Seville oranges, Seville orange juice, and St John’s w ort (tablet or tea) while 
receiving study intervention. Otherwise, participants should maintain a normal diet unless 
modifications are required to manage an AE such as diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting.
5.4 Screen Failures
Screen failures are defined as participan ts who consent to participate in the clinical study, but 
are not subsequently randomized in the study. A minimal set of screen failure information is 
required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the

6.2.1 Dose Preparation
Details of preparation and administration of pembrolizumab are provided in the Pharmacy 
Manual. 
Olaparib, a biraterone acetate, prednisone or prednisolone , and enzalutamide do not require 
preparation.
6.2.2 Handling, Storage ,and Accountability
The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study intervention received, and any discrepancies are 
reported and resolved before use of the study intervention .
Only participants enrolled in the stu dy may receive study intervention, and only authorized 
site staff may supply or administer study intervention. All study interventions must be stored 
in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in 
accordance with the l abeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and 
authorized site staff.

records and ensure appropriate supply, storage, handling, distribution, and usage of study 
interventions in accordance with the protocol and any applicable laws and regulations.
6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
6.3.1 Intervention Assignment
Intervention randomization will take place centrally using an interactive response technology
(IRT)system. There are 2 study intervention arms. P articipants will be randomly assigned in 
a 2:1 ratio to pembrolizumab in combination with olaparib or to abiraterone acetate or
enzalutamide , respectively.
6.3.2 Stratification
Participants will be stratified according to the following factor s:
Prior NHA treatment : abiraterone acetate versus enzalutamide
Measurable disease at baseline: yes versus no
6.3.3 Blinding
This is an open -label study; therefore ,the Sponsor, investigator ,and participant will know 
the treatment administered. Imaging data for the primary analysis will be centrally reviewed 
by an independent radiologist( s) with out knowledge of participants’ treatment assignment.
PD-L1, PSA, and CTC results are not reported to sites, to prevent early withdrawal of 
participants from study intervention.
6.4 Study Intervention Compliance
Interruptions from the protocol -specified treatme nt plan for more than 12 weeks between 
pembrolizumab doses for nondrug- related or administrative reasons require consultation 
between the investigator and the Sponsor and written documentation of the collaborative 
decision on participant management.
For study interventions taken at home, the site will validate compliance with study 
intervention at ea ch site visit according to its SOP.

6.5 Concomitant Therapy
6.5.1 Prohibited Concomitant Therapy
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion cr iteria are not allowed
during the ongoing study OR during time periods specified by this protocol for that 
medication or vaccination. If there is a clinical indication for any medication or vaccination 
specifically prohibited, discontinuation from [study intervention or vaccination] may be 
required. The investigator is to discuss prohibited medication/vaccination with the Sponsor's 
Clinical Director. The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the 
investigator and/or the participa nt's primary physician. However, the decision to continue the 
participant on study intervention requires the mutual agreement of the investigator, the 
Sponsor, and the participant .
Based on in vitro data, olaparib may increase exposure to substrates of CYP 3A4, organic 
anion -transporting polypeptide 1B1, organic cation transporter 1/2/3, and multidrug and 
toxic compound extrusion 1/2, and reduce exposure to substrates of CYP2B6. Caution 
should be observed if substrates of these isoenzymes or transporter prot eins are co -
administered, including statins (eg, lovastatin, simvastatin, etc.) . Acurrent list of 
substrates can be found at the following website:
https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugI
nteractionsLabeling/ucm0936 64.htm
Listed below are specific concomitant therapies or vaccinations prohibited during the 
study:
Anticancer hormonal therapy (eg, anti-estrogens).
Note :Hormonal replacement therapy and ADT with LHRH agonists (eg, leuprolide) 
and LHRH antagonists (eg, degarelix) are allowed.
Strong and moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP 3A4.

should be avoided if possible ,as enzalutamide may decrease their exposure. If 
coadministration with warfarin cannot be avoided, perform additional INR 
monitoring.
Abiraterone is an inhibitor of CYP2D6. Dose reduction should be considered for 
medicinal products that are metabolized by CYP2D6 and have a narrow therapeutic 
index to prolong the QT interval (ie, pimozide, sertindole, droperidol, haloperidol, 
thioridazine).
Strong inhibitors of CYP2C8.
Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biologic therapy , except denosumab and 
bisphosphonates for bone meta stases as SOC (the participant must have been 
receiving stable doses for ≥ 4 weeks before randomization) .
Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol.
Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol.
Targeted therapy not specified in this protocol.
Administration of radium -223 while on study and for at least 5 days after the last 
administration of abiraterone in combination with prednisone/prednisolone .
The clinical efficacy and safety of concurrent therapy of abiraterone acetate plus 
prednisone/prednisolone and radium -223 were evaluated in a Phase 3, randomized, 
placebo -controlled, multicenter study in patients with asymptomatic or mildly 
symptomatic castration- resistant prostate cancer with bone metastases. Increased 
incidences of fractures (28.6% vs 11.4%) and deaths (38.5% vs 35.5%) were 
observed in patients who received abiraterone plus prednisone/prednisolone in 
combination w ith radium -223 compared to patients who received placebo in 
combination with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone [Smith, M., et al 
2019] . Therefore, the combination of abiraterone and prednisone/pre dnisolone with 
radium -223 is contraindicated. Additionally, subsequent treatment with radium- 223 
should not be initiated for at least 5 days after the last administration of abiraterone in 
combination with prednisone/prednisolone. 
Initiation of bone resor ptive therapy including, but not limited to, bisphosphonates or 
denosumab (unless approved by Sponsor consultation) .
Any second -generation androgen receptor inhibitor, except enzalutamide in 
participants randomized to abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide arm.
Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab or olaparib.

Herbal products that may have hormonal antiprostate cancer activity and/or are 
known to decrease PSA (e .g., saw palmetto).
Radiation therapy.
Note : Palliative localized radiation therapy to a site of pre -existing disease may be 
permitted during the study after consultation with the Sponsor. The radiation 
treatment field may not include a target or measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1.
Live vaccines within 30 days before the date of randomization and while participating 
in the study. Examples of live vaccines in clude, but are not limited to, measles, 
mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, intranasal seasonal influenza, rabies, 
BCG, and oral typhoid vaccine. S easonal i nfluenza vaccines for injection are 
generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed.
Note : If precluded by local regulations, live vaccines should not be given for 90 days 
after the last dose of study intervention. (See Appendix 7 for country -specific 
requirements).
Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than for administration to par ticipants 
receiving abiraterone acetate , orto modulate symptoms from an AE that is suspected 
to have an immunologic etiology. The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids 
may be approved after consultation with the Sponsor.
Note : The following uses of corticosteroids are permitted without Sponsor 
consultation:
Inhaled steroids for management of asthma.
Prophylactic corticoste roids to avoid allergic reactions (eg, reactions to IV 
contras t material ).
Palliative prednisone or prednisolone up to 10 mg daily or corticosteroid 
equivalent as used to treat men w ith prostate cancer .
Physiologic doses of corticosteroids for adrenal insufficiency.
Intranasal steroids for management of allergies.
Disease -modifying agents or immunosuppressive drugs.
5α reductase inhibitors (eg, finasteride ordutasteride), estrogens, or cyproterone.

In addition to the medications listed her e, site staff should refer to the local approved 
product labels for permitted and prohibited medications, as well as drug -drug 
interactions , for each intervention used in this study. Caution should be used if 
participants receiving enzalutamide are receivi ng concomitant medications that may 
lower the seizure threshold.
The exclusion c riteria (Section 5.2) describe other medications prohibited in this study.
Participants who, in the assessment of the Investigator, require the use of any of the 
aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the study.
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a participant’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the community standards of 
medical care. All concomitant medication will be recorded on the eCRF including all 
prescription, over -the-counter (OTC) products, herbal supplements, and IV medications and 
fluids. If changes occur during the study period, documentation of dr ug dosage, frequency, 
route, and date should also be included on the eCRF.
All concomitant medications received within 28days prior to the date of randomization and 
up to 30 days after the last dose of study intervention should be recorded. Concomitant 
medications administered 30 days after the last dose of study intervention should be recorded 
for SAEs and events of clinical interest (ECIs) as defined in Section 8.4.7.
6.5.2 Rescue Medications and Supportive Care
Participants should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by the 
treating investigator. Suggested supportive care measures for the management of AEs with 
potential immunologic etiology are outlined along with the dose modification guidelines in 
Section 6.6.3.1 , Table 7 . Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or IV 
treatment with corticosteroids, as well as additional anti -inflammatory agents if symptoms do 
not improve with administration of corticosteroids. Note that several courses of steroid 
tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For 
each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as me tastatic disease or 
bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care. The treatment 
guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator determines the events to be 
related to pembrolizumab.
Note: If after the evaluation of the event, it is determined not to be related to pembrolizumab, 
the investigator does not need to follow the treatment guidance. Refer to Table 7in Section 
6.6.3.1 for guidelines regarding dose modification and supportive care.
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or 
skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.

6.5.3 Radiotherapy
Sites must consult the Sponsor before the use of radiotherapy or surgical interv ention while a 
participant is in the study, and the intervention must be recorded in the study database.
Localized palliative radiation therapy to a site of pre -existing disease may be permitted while 
a participant is in the study. However, if the participant develops a new lesion or a definite 
increase in the size of existing bone or visceral lesions ,with or without extension into soft 
tissue ,that meets the criteria for disease progression according to PCWG [Scher, H. I., et al 
2016] , study intervention must be discontinued for PD regardless of whether radiation 
therapy is initiated.
6.6 Dose Modification (Escalation/Titration/Other)
6.6.1 Concomitant Combin ation Therapy
If either pembrolizumab is interrupted for >12 weeks foranimmune -related AE (irAE) orfor 
administrative reasons, or olaparib is interrupted for 28 consecutive days, the site must gain 
approval via an SCF to continue the other study intervention. Participants who must 
discontinue 1 of the 2 interventions due to drug -related A Es may continue with the other
intervention after consultation with the Sponsor until a criterion for study intervention 
discontinuation (e.g., disease progression) ismet.
6.6.2 Dose Modification for Olaparib
The dose of olaparib can be reduced to 250 mg BID initially and then to 200 mg BID as 
needed. If the 200 mg BID dose is not tolerable, no further dose reduction is allowed, and 
olaparib should be discontinued. Once the dose has been reduced, escalation is not permitted , 
except after concomitant treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors (Table 6 ).
The reason for the dose interruption or reduction should be captured on the appropriate 
electronic case report form (eCRF) .
Management of Hematologic Toxicities
Any hematologic toxicity observed during the study could be managed by a brief i nterruption 
of olaparib dosing or a reduction of the olaparib dose ( Table 3 andTable 4 ).Repeated 
interruptions, not exceeding 4 weeks ( 28 days) , are allowed as required. If the interruption is 
any longer, th e Sponsor must be informed.

follow -up and interruption of study intervention if CTCAE Grade 3 or worse neutropenia occurs.
Primary prophylaxis with G-CSF is not recommended; however, if a participant develops febrile neutropenia, 
study intervention should be stopped and appropriate management including G -CSF should be given 
according to local hospital guidelines. Please note that G- CSF should not be used within at least 24 hours (7 
days for pegylated G- CSF) of the last dose of study intervention unless absolutely necessary.
Platelet transfusi ons, if indicated, should be performed accordin g to local hospital guidelines.
Management of prolonged hematologic toxicities is detailed in Section 6.6.2.2 .
Management of Prolonged Hematologic Toxicities
If a participant develops prolonged hematologic toxicity ,such as :
≥2-week interruption/delay of ol aparib dosing due to NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or worse 
anemia and/or development of blood transfusion dependence ,
≥2-week interruption/delay of olaparib dosing due to NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or worse 
neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1 × 109/L), or
≥2-week interrup tion/delay of olaparib dosing due to NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or worse 
thrombocytopenia and/or development of platelet transfusion dependence (platelets <50 × 
109/L),
differential blood count, including reticulocytes and peripheral blood smear, should be 
checked weekly. If any blood parameters remain clinically abnormal after olaparib dosing 
has been interrupted for ≥4 weeks (≥28 days), the participant should be referred to a 
hematologist for further investigations. Bone marrow analysis and/or blood cytoge netic 
analysis should be considered, according to local regulations and/or standard institutional 
hematologic practice. Olaparib should be discontinued if blood counts do not recover to NCI 
CTCAE Grade 1 or better within 4 weeks (28 days) of dose interrupt ion.

Development of confirmed MDS or other clonal blood disorder should be reported as an 
SAE ,and full reports must be provided by the investigator to the Sponsor as outlined in 
Section 8.4.4. O laparib should be discontinued for co nfirmed MDS and/or AML 
(Section 7.1).
Management of Nonhematologic Toxicity
Repeated dose interruptions, not exceeding 4 weeks (28 days), are allowed as required. If 
toxicity recurs after rechallenge with olaparib , and where further dose interruptions are 
considered inadequate for management of toxicity, either a dose reduction sho uld be 
considered (Section 6.6.2) or the participant must permanently discontinue olaparib.
Olaparib dosing must be interrupted if any NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 AE occurs that the 
investigator considers to be related to olaparib administration .
6.6.2.3.1 Management of New or Worsening Pulmonary Symptoms
If new or worsening pulmonary symptoms (eg, dyspnea) or radiologic abnormalities occur in 
the absence of a clear diagnosis, an in terruption of olaparib dosing is recommended, and 
further diagnostic workup (including a high -resolution CT scan) should be performed to 
exclude pneumonitis.
After investigation, if no evidence of abnormality is observed on CT imaging and symptoms 
resolve, olaparib can be restarted if deemed appropriate by the investigator. If significant 
pulmonary abnormalities are identified, these need to be discussed with the Sponsor.
6.6.2.3.2 Management of Nausea and Vomiting
Events of nausea and vomiting are known to be assoc iated with olaparib administration . 
These events are generally mild to moderate in severity (NCI CTCAE Grade 1 or 2) , 
intermit tent, and manageable with continued treatment. The first onset generally occurs in the 
first month of olaparib dosing for nausea and within th e first 6 months of olaparib dosing for 
vomiting. For nausea, the incidence generally plateaus at around 9 months, and for vomiting 
at around 6 to 7 months.
No routine prophylactic antiemetic treatment is required at the start of olaparib treatment ; 
howe ver, participants should receive appropriate antiemetic treatment at the first onset of 
nausea or vomiting and as required thereafter, in accordance with local regulations or 
institutional guidelines. Alternatively, olaparib tablets can be taken with a lig ht meal/snack 
(ie, 2 pieces of toast or a couple of crackers).
Per international guidance on antiemetic use in cancer patients (ESMO; NCCN ), generally a 
single -agent antiemetic should be considered (eg, a dopamine receptor antagonist, 
antihistamines, or de xamethasone).

6.6.2.3.3 Management of Renal Impairment
If, after study entry and/or while st ill receiving olaparib , a participant’s estimated creatinine 
clearance ( CrCl )falls below the threshold for study inclusion ( ≥51 mL/min), retestin g should 
be performed prompt ly.
A dose reduction is recommended for participants who develop moderate renal impairment 
(calculated CrCl 31 to 50 mL/min, either as calculated with the Cockcroft -Gault equation or 
based on a 24- hour urine test) for any reason during the study.

Abbreviation: BID=twice daily.
aCreatinine clearance 31 to 50 mL/min as calculated with the Cockcroft -Gault equation o r based on a 24 -hour urine test
Because CrCl determination is only an estimate of renal function, in instances where CrCl 
falls to 31 to 50 mL/min the investigator should use his or her discretion in determining 
whether a dose c hange or discontinuation of olaparib is warranted.
Olaparib has not been studied in participants with severe renal impairment 
(CrCl ≤30mL/min) or end -stage renal disease. If participants develop severe renal 
impairment or end- stage renal disease ,it is recommended that olaparib be discontinued.
Interruptions for Intercurrent Nontoxicity- related Events
Olaparib dose interruption for conditions other than toxicity resolution should be kept as 
short as possible. I f a participant c annot restart olapar ibwithin 4 weeks (28 days) for 
resolution of intercurrent conditions not related to disease progression or toxicity, the case 
should be discussed with the Sponsor and approved via an SCF .
All dose reductions and interruptions (including any missed doses) and the reasons for the 
reductions/interruptions are to be recorded in the eCRF. 
Olaparib should be stopped at least 3 days before planned surgery and can be restarted when 
the wound has healed. It is not required to stop olaparib for any needle biopsy procedure.
Localized palliative radiation therapy to a site of pre -existing disease may be permitted while 
a participant is in the st udy. O laparib should be discontinued for a minimum of 3 days before 
radiation therapy and should be restarted within 4 weeks (28 days) ,as long as any bone 
marrow toxicity has recovered.
Because A Es related to olaparib may include asthenia, fatigue, and di zziness, participants 
should be advised to use caution while driving or using machinery if these symptoms occur.

Dose Reductions for Concurrent CYP3A4 Inhibitor Use
Strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors should not be taken with olaparib. If there is no 
suita ble alternative concomitant medication, the dose of olaparib should be reduced for the 
period of concomitant administration as described in Table 6 . After washout of the inhibitor 
is complete (Section 5.2), the olaparib dose can be re -escalated. The olaparib dose reduction 
should be recorded in the eCRF, with the reason documented as concomitant CYP3A4 
inhibitor use.

6.6.3 Immune -Related Events and Dose Modification (Withhold, Treat, 
Discontinue)
Dose Modification and Toxicity Management for Immune -related AEs 
Associated with Pembrolizumab
AEs associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent an immune -related response. 
These irAEs may occur shortly af ter the first dose or several months after the last dose of 
pembrolizumab treatment and may affect more than one body system simultaneously. 
Therefore, early recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to reduce complications. 
Based on existing cli nical study data, most irAEs were reversible and could be managed with 
interruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of corticosteroids and/or other supportive 
care. For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other 
causes. Additional procedures or tests such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, skin biopsy may be 
included as part of the evaluation. Based on the severity of irAEs, withhold or permanently 
discontinue pembrolizumab and administer corticosteroids.
Dose Modification a nd Toxicity Management Guidelines for irAEs associated with 
pembrolizumab monotherapy, coformulations, or IO combinations are provided in Table 7 .

MK-7339 -010-06FINAL PROTOCOL 02-MAY -2022
6.6.4 Management of Overlapping Toxicities
Based on the known toxicity profiles of pembrolizumab and olaparib, certain 
treatment -related AEs are uniquely associated with one drug versus the other. F or example, 
anemia is a known riskof olaparib treatment , while immune -related/ immune -mediated AEs 
are risks of pembrolizumab treatment. However, certain AEs, such as diarrhea, pneumonitis,
and increase dcreatinine ,may be initially considered attributable to either study drug. 
Ther efore, evaluation of attribution is important for determining the study drug most likely 
related to the AE, or an alternative etiology, and subsequently for proper clinical 
management. The following should be considered: 
1.Timing of AE Onset
Since olapar ib is dosed daily and continuously due to a relatively short half -life ( 11.9 hours) 
and pembrolizumab is dosed Q3W due to a long half -life, olaparib can be interrupted to 
assess whether an AE improves/resolves with dechallenge (ie , interruption of treatment) 
based on the following 2 scenarios:
If an AE is identifie d during a treatment cycle (ie, between 2 pembrolizumab doses), only 
olaparib dose interruption is needed. 
If an AE is identified at the beginning of a treatment cycle, olaparib c an be in terrupted 
and pembrolizumab dosing should be held.
If the participant recovers from an AE in respons e to olaparib interruption (ie, positive 
dechallenge), the event is more likely to be related to olaparib. O therwise, after excluding 
other alternative expl anations, an irAE should be considered.
2.Severity of AE
If an AE is suspected to be treatme nt-related and is severe/life -threate ning at the time of 
onset or rapidly worsens , action, including interrupting both drugs and initiating treatment 
with a cortic osteroid (with the exception o f hypothyroidism and type 1 diabetes mellitus 
[T1DM]) and other supportive care ,should be promptly taken.
6.6.5 Dose Modification for Abiraterone Acetate
Dose modification guidelines for abiraterone acetate are given in Table 9.The dose 
regimen/modification should be adopted according to the efficacy and safety risk information 
according to local regulations and guidelines for administration of abiraterone acetate. Once 
the dose has been reduced, it may not be escalated to a previous dose level.
Management of Hepatotoxicity
In participants who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment with abiraterone acetate ALT 
and/or AST >5 × ULN or total bilirubin >3 × ULN), inter rupt treatment. Treatment may be 
restarted at a reduced dose of 750 mg QDafter return of liver function test results to baseline 
086YCG
PRODUCT: MK-7339 96
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-06
MK-7339 -010-06FINAL PROTOCOL 02-MAY -2022
or to AST and ALT ≤2.5 × ULN and total bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN. If hepatotoxicity recurs at 
the dose of 750 mg QD, treatment may be restart ed at a reduced dose of 500 mg QDafter
return of liver function test results to baseline or to AST and ALT ≤2.5 × ULN and total 
bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN. If hepatotoxicity recurs at the reduced dose of 500 mg QD, treatment 
with abiraterone acetate i s to be discontinued.
Abiraterone acetate is to be permanently discontinued in participants who develop a 
concurrent elevation of ALT >3 × ULN and total bilirubin >2 × ULN in the absence of 
biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for this concurren t elevation. 
Participants who develop AST or ALT ≥20 × ULN and/or bi lirubin ≥10 × ULN should be 
discontinued from treatment with abiraterone acetate .
Management of Hypokalemia 
Correct hypokalemia before and during treatment. For Grade 1 or 2 hypokalemia, initiate oral 
potassium supplementation, and titrate to maintain serum potassium ≥3.5 mEq/L and ≤5.0 
mEq/L (maintenance at ≥4.0mEq/L is recommended) . Treatment without dose reduction can 
continue after hypokalemia is corrected to Grade 0.
If a participant develops Grade 3 hypokalemia (serum potassium <3.0 mEq/L to 2.5 mEq/L 
[NCI CTCAE Version 4.0]) or life- threatening hypokalemia with serum potassium 
<2.5 mEq/L (Grade 4 hypokalemia [NCI CTCAE Version 4.0]), abiraterone acetate should 
be wit hheld and the participant hospitalized for IV potassium replacement and cardiac 
monitoring. Re-initiation of abiraterone acetate after normalization (Grade 0) of serum 
potassium must be discussed with and approved by the Sponsor .
Management of Hypertension
For Grade 1 to 2 hypertension, continue abiraterone acetate without dose reduction. 
Management of hypertension is per the i nvestigat or.
For Grade 3 to 4 hypertension, with hold abiraterone acetate . Adjust or add medications to 
mitigate the toxicity ,and/or consider a specific mineralocortic oid receptor blocker such as 
eplerenone . When hypertension re solves to Grade ≤1, resume abiraterone acetate at the full 
dose.
If Grade 3 to 4 hypertension recurs, withhold abiraterone acetate and adjust or add 
medications to mitigate the toxicity. When hypertension is resolved to Grade ≤1, resume 
abiraterone acetate at 750 mg QD.
If Grade 3 to 4 hypertension recurs again , with hold abiraterone acetate and adjust or add 
medications to mitigate t he toxicity. Whenhypertension is resolved to Grade ≤1, resume 
abiraterone acetate at 500 mg QD.
If Grade 3 to 4 hypertension recurs despite optimal medical management and 2 dose 
reductions, discontinue abiraterone acetate.

Management of Edema and Fluid R etention
Supportive management of pedal edema is per the i nvestigator. Dose reduction of abiraterone 
acetate is not necessary.
If anasarca and/or pulmonary edema requiring supplemental oxygen occurs, withhold 
abiraterone acetate. Adjust or add medications to mitigate the toxicity , and/or consider a 
specific mineralocorticoid receptor blocker such as eplerenone. When anasarca and/or 
pulmonary edema resolves to Grade ≤1, resume abiraterone acetate at the full dose.
If anasarca and/or pulmonary edema recurs, withhold abiraterone acetate and adjust or add 
medications to mitigate the toxicity. When anasarca and/or pulmonary edema is resolved to 
Grade ≤1, resume abiraterone acetate at 750 mg QD.
If anasarca and/or pulmonary edema recurs again, withhold abiraterone acetate and adjust or 
add medications to mitigate the toxicity. When anasarca and/or pulmonary edema is resolved 
to Grade ≤1, resume abiraterone acetate at 500 mg QD.
If anasarca and/or pulmonary edema recurs despite optimal medical ma nagement and 2 dose 
reductions, discontinue abiraterone acetate .
Management of Other AE s Believed to be Related t o Abiraterone Acetate
For Grade 1 to 2 toxicities, give supportive care per institutional guidel ines. Dose reduction
of abiraterone acetate is not necessary .
For Grade 3 to 4 toxicities, withhold abiraterone acetate . Adjust or add medications to 
mitigate the toxicity ,and/or consider a specific mineralocorticoid receptor blocker such as 
epleren one. When the toxicity is resol ved to Grade ≤ 1, resum e abiraterone acetate at the full 
dose.
If the toxicity recurs, withhold abiraterone acetate and adjust or add medications to mitigate 
the toxicity. When the toxicity is resolved to Grade ≤1, resume abiraterone acetate at 750 mg 
QD.
If the toxicity recurs again, withhold abiraterone acetate and adjust or add medications to 
mitigate the toxicity. When the toxicity is resolved to Grade ≤1, resume abiraterone acetate at 
500 mg QD.
Ifthetoxicity recurs despite optimal medical management and 2 dose level reductions, 
discontinue abiraterone acetate .
Symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency may be masked by adverse reactions 
associated with mineralocorticoid excess seen in participants treated with abiraterone acetate. 
If clinically indicated, perform appropriate tests to confirm the diagnosis of adrenocortical 
insufficiency. Increased corticosteroid dosage may be indicated before, during, and after 
stressful situations. M onitor the participant f or symptoms and signs of adrenocortical

6.6.6 Dose Modification for Enzalutamide
If a par ticipant experiences any Grade ≥3 toxicity related to enzalutamide, the drug should be 
withheld until the toxicity decreases to Grade ≤2. Enzalutamide can then be resumed at a 
reduced dose of 120 mg QD. If Grade ≥3 toxicity recurs, enzalutamide can again be withheld 
until toxicity decreases to Grade ≤2 and resumed at a reduced dose of 80 mg QD. Dose 
reduction below 80 mg QD is not permitted.
Once the dose has been reduced, it may not be escalated to a previous dose level.
Enzalutamide should be permanently discontinued in participants who experience a seizure 
during treatment.
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been observed in participants 
treated with enzalutamide. This syndrome may present with rapidly evolving symptoms of 
seizure, lethargy, headache, confusion, blindness or visual disturbances, or other neurologic 
symptoms. Hyperten sion may or may not be present. PRES is diagnosed by brain imaging 
(prefera bly MRI). Enzalutamide must be permanently discontinued in participants who 
develop PRES during treatment.
Participants taking enzalutamide should promptly report the development of rash , regardless 
of severity, to the investigator. These participants should be promptly treated with steroids 
and dose interruption per protocol and monitored closely fo r worsening of rash ,which may 
require additional treatment. 
After resolution of toxicity, enzalutamide can be resumed with dose reduction according to

7.3 Lost t o Follow -up
If a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit and/or if the site is unable 
to contact the participant, the following procedures are to be performed:
The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit. If the 
participant is contacted, the participant should be counseled on the importance of mai ntaining 
the protocol -specified visit schedule.
The investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant at 
each missed visit (eg, telephone calls and/or a certified letter to the participant’s last known 
mailing address or locally equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be 
documented in the participant’s medical record.
Note: A participant is not considered lost to follow -up until the last scheduled visit for the 
individual participant. The missing data for the participant will be managed via the 
prespecified statistical data handling and analysis guidelines.
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA.
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential 
and required for study conduct.
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that procedures are conducted by appropriately 
qualified (by education, training, and experience) staff . Delegation of study sit e personnel 
responsibilities will be documented in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent).
All study- related medica l decisions must be made by an investigator who is a qualified 
physician.
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewe d to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.
Procedu res conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood 
count) and obtained before signing of ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes 
provided the procedure met the protocol -specified criteria and were performed wit hin the 
time frame defined in the SoA.
Additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by the investigator and or the 
Sponsor for reasons related to participant safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may 
be potentially sensitive in nature (e g, HIV, Hepatitis C), and thus local regulations may 
require that additional informed consent be obtained from the participant. In these cases, such 
evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations.

8.1 Administrative and General Procedures
8.1.1 Informed Consent
The investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) must 
obtain documented consent from each potential participant or each participant’s legally 
acceptable representative prior to participating in a clinical study or futu re biomedical 
research .If there are changes to the participant’s status during the study (eg, health or age of 
majority requirements), the investigator or medically qualified designee must ensure the 
appropriate consent is in place.
General Informed Consent
Consent must be docum ented by the participant’s dated signature or by the participant’s 
legally acceptable representative’s dated signature on a consent form along with the dated 
signature of the person conducting the consent discussion.
A copy of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the participant before 
participation in the study.
The initial ICF, any subsequent revised written ICF, and any written information provided to 
the participant must receive the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee ’s 
(IRB/IEC’s )approval/favorable opinion in advance of use. The participant or his/her legally 
acceptable representative should be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes 
available that may be relevant to the participant’s willingness to co ntinue participation in the 
study. The communication of this information will be provided and documented via a revised 
consent form or addendum to the original consent form that captures the participant’s dated 
signature or by the participant’s legally acceptable representative’s dated signature.
The participant or his legally acceptable representative will be asked to sign consent at the 
point of initial radiographic disease progression.
Specifics about a study and the study population will be added to the consent form template 
at the protocol level.
The informed consent will adhere to IRB/IEC requirements, applicable laws and regulations, 
and Sponsor requirements.
Consent and Collection of Specimens for Future Biomedical Research
The investigator or medically qualified designee will explain the FBR consent to the 
participant, answer all of his questions, and obtain written informed consent before

to the participant.
8.1.2 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
All inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed by the investigator who is a qualified 
physician to ensure that the participant qualifies for the study.
8.1.3 Participant Identification Ca rd
All participants will be given a participant identification card identifying them as participants 
in a research study. The card will contain study site contact information (including direct 
telephone numbers) to be used in the event of an emergency. The investigator o r qualified 
designee will provide the participant with a participant identification card immediately after 
the participant provides written informed consent. At the time of intervention
allocation/randomization, site personnel will add the treatment /randomization number to the 
participant identification card.
The participant identification card also contains contact information for the emergency 
unblinding call center so that a healthcare provider can obtain information about study 
intervent ion in emergency situations where the investigator is not available.
8.1.4 Medical History
A medical history will be obtained by the investigator or qualified designee. The medical 
history will collect all active conditions and any condition diagnosed within the prior 10 
years that the investigator considers to be clinically important. In addition, significant and 
potentially relevant conditions that occurred >10 years previously should be collected.
Details regarding the disease for which the participant has enr olled in this study will be 
recorded separately and not listed as medical history .
8.1.5 Prior and Concomitant Medications Revi ew
Prior Medications
The investigator or qualified designee will review prior medication use, including any 
protocol -specified washout requirement, and record prior medication taken by the participant 
within 28 days before the date of randomization. T reatment for the disease for which the 
participant has enrolled in this study will be recorded separately and not listed as a prior 
medicati on.
Concomitant Medications
The investigator or qualified designee will record medication, if any, taken by the participan t 
during the study through the S afety Follow -up Visit. All medications related to reportable 
SAEs and ECIs should be recorded as defined in S ection 8.4.1 . In addition, new medications 
started during the Second Course phase through the Second Course Safety Follow -up V isit 
should be recorded.

8.1.6 Assignment of Screening Numb er
All consented participants will be given a unique screening number that will be used to 
identify the participant for all procedures that occur prior to randomization . Each participant 
will be assigned only 1 screening number. Screening numbers must not be re -used for 
different participants.
8.1.7 Assignment of Treatment/Randomization Numb er
All eligible participants will be randomly allocated and will receive a treatment 
/randomization number. The treatment/randomization number identifies the participant for all 
procedures occurring after treatment randomization . Once a treatment/randomization number 
is assigned to a participant, it can never be reassigned to another participant.
A single participant cannot be assigned more than 1 treatment/randomization number.
8.1.8 Study Intervention Administrati on
Administration of pembrolizumab will be monitored by the investigator and/or study staff.
Administration of olaparib, abiraterone acetate and prednisone or prednisolone, or 
enzalutamide will be administered by the investigator and/or study staff according to the 
specifications within the Pharmacy Manual ,at the Cycle 1 Day 1 clinic visit. Participants will 
then self -administer olaparib, abiraterone acetate and prednisone or prednisolone, or 
enzalutamide orally on a continuous daily dosing schedule.
On Day 1 of subsequent cycle s, pembrolizumab should be administered after all procedures 
and assessments have been completed. S tudy intervention can be administered within 
±3days of th e targeted Day 1 for each cycle except Cycle 1, when intervention can o nly be 
administered within +3 days of the targeted Day 1.
Timing of Dose Administration
8.1.8.1.1 Pembrolizumab
Pembrolizumab treatments will begin on Da y 1 of each cycle after all pre dose study 
procedures and assessments have been co mpleted as detailed in the SoA.
Pembrolizumab will be administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg, as a 30-minute IV infusion 
Q3W. Sites should make every effort to target infusion time to be as close to 30 minutes as 
possible. H owever, given the variability of infusion pumps fr om site to sit e, a window 
of -5minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (ie, infusion time is 30 minutes -5 min/+10 min).
The Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions for pembrolizumab reconstitution, 
preparation of the infusion fluid, and administration.

8.1.9 Discontinuation and Withdrawal
Participants who discontinue study intervention prior to completion of the study intervention 
period should be encouraged to continue to be followed for all remaining study visits as 
outlined in the SoA and Section 8.1 2.3.
When a p articipant withdraw s from participation in the study, all applicable activities 
scheduled for the end oftreatment visit should be performed (at the time of withdrawal ). Any 
AEs that are present at the time of withdrawal should be followed in accordance with the 
safety requirements outlined in Section 8.4 an d Section 8.12.4.
Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Resear ch
Participants may withdraw their consent for future biomedical r esearch. Participants may 
withdraw consent at any time by contacting the principal investigator for the main study. If 
medical recor ds for the main study are still available, the investigator will contact the 
Sponsor using the designated mailbox (clinical.specimen.management@ MSD .com). 
Subsequently, the participant's consent for future biomedical r esearch will be withdrawn. A 
letter wil l be sent from the Sponsor to the investigator confirming the withdrawal. It is the 
responsibility of the investigator to inform the participant of completion of withdrawal. Any 
analyses in progress at the time of request for withdrawal or already performe d prior to the 
request being received by the Sponsor will continue to be used as part of the overall research 
study data and results. No new analyses would be generated after the request is received.
In the event that the medical records for the main study are no longer available (eg, if the 
investigator is no longer required by regulatory authorities to retain the main study records) 
or the specimens have been completely anonymized, there will no longer be a link between 
the participant’s personal informat ion and their specimens. In this situation, the request for 
specimen withdrawal cannot be processed.

8.2 Efficacy Assessmen ts
8.2.1 Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease
As of Amendment 06: Central t umor response assessments will be discontinued .
Imaging scans will no longer be submitted to iCRO nor read by BICR. The subsections 
below are retained for reference.
However, for participants who are still on study treatment and deriving clinical benefit and 
will contin ue on study intervention or SOC treatment until criteria for discontinuation are
met, local tumor imaging should continue per SOC schedule .
The process for image collection and transmission to the central imaging vendor is given in 
the Site Imaging Manual .
Chest, abdomen, and pelvis scans are required for all participants at screening and on -
study. CT with IV and oral contrast is preferred or noncontrast CT of the chest and MRI 
of the abdomen and pelvis with IV gadolinium for participants in whom iodinated 
contrast is contraindicated .
Bone scans (eg, bone scintigraphy, bone scan, radionuclide bone scan, etc.) arerequired 
for all participants at screening and on- study.
Other modalities (eg, ( FDG -PET, PSMA PET, MRI, SPECT, etc) cannot be a substitute 
for the bone scan.
Additional imaging acquired as per SOC or as clinically indicated, used to support 
radiographic disease progression or efficacy assessments, should be sent to the iCRO.
Note : For the purposes of assessing tumor imaging, the te rm “investigator” refers to the 
local investigator at the site and/or the radiologic reviewer at the site or at an offsite 
facility.
Participant eligibility will be determined using local assessment (investi gator assessment) 
based on PCWG -modified RECIST 1 .1. A ll scheduled images for all participants from the

sites will be submitted to the iCRO . In addition, images (includin g via other modalities)
obtained at an unscheduled time point to determine disease progression, as well as ima ging 
obtained for other reasons, but which demonstrates radi ologic progression, should be 
submitted to the iCRO .
Oninvestigator -assessed disease progression, the indicative scans are to be submitted 
immediately to iCRO for BICR verification of progression . After submission of scans, the 
iCRO will e -mail the assessment to the site and Sponsor.
If disease progression is not verified, the process continues as follows:
If participant is clinically stable, continue study intervention per protocol
- R esume imaging per protocol schedule 
-Send scans to iCRO
-Continue local assessment
-Do not change investigator assessment of progression
-If subsequent scan(s) indicate progression, submit scans to iCRO to request 
verification
If the participant is not clinically stable, best medical practice is to be applied
Before stopping study intervention or imaging or starting new anticancer therapy in a 
participant who is clinically stable, communication with the Sponsor is required.
If disease progression is verified, the process c ontinues as follows:
Investigator judgment will determine action
If the participant is clinically stable and study intervention is to continue, communication 
with the Sponsor is required and a reconsent must be signed
Note: the reconsent may be signed any time after investigator -assessed progression is 
identified but must be signed before starting study intervention after verification of 
disease progression is provided by the iCRO.
Obtain scans locally per original protocol schedule
Do not send scans to iCRO
For the purpose of this decision process, lack of clinical stability is defined as:
-Unacceptable toxicity

-Decline in performance status
-Rapid disease progression or threa t to vital organs or critical anatomical sites (eg, 
CNS metastasis, respiratory failure due to tumor compression, spinal cord 
compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention.
The primary measure used by BICR for assessment of tumor response, date of disease 
progression, and as a basis for all protocol guidelines related to disease status ( e.g., 
discontinuation of study intervention) will be PCWG -modified RECIST 1.1. PCWG PDu is 
not con sidered radiographic PD.
Assessment of treatment response in soft tissue will be according to the soft tissue rules of 
PCWG -modified RECIST 1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target soft tissue lesions 
and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. Assessment of treatment response in bone will 
be according to the bone lesion rules of PCWG -modified RECIST 1.1, as described in 
Appendix 8.
Soft tissue and bone response assessments will be combined to produce an overall

Initial Tumor Imaging
Initial tumor imaging at scree ning must be performed within 28 days before the date of 
randomization. Tumor imaging by CT (or MRI) and radionuclide bone scan ning is required 
at screening.
Scans performed as part of routine clinical management are acceptable as screening scans if 
they are of diagnostic quality and performed within 28 days before the date of randomization. 
Scans are required to be se nt to the iCRO before enrollment; however, central imaging 
assessment is not required before enrollment.
At screening, all soft tissue lesions seen with CT (or M RI) and all bone lesions seen with
radionuclide bone scann ingwill be documented. In determining response to study 
intervention or progression, investigators m ust evaluate all target and nontarget lesions and 
search for new lesions at each imaging time point.
Tumor Imaging During the Study
In the first year, on-s tudy imaging assessments must be performed every 9 weeks (63 days ± 
7 days) from the date of randomization (through Week 54).Participants who continue 
receiving study intervention beyond Week 54 will have imaging performed every 12 weeks 
(84 days ± 7 days ). All supplemental imaging must be submitte d to the iCRO .
Timing of imaging should follow calendar days from the date of randomization and should 
not be adjusted for delays in cycle starts.
Response must be confirmed at least 4 weeks later to be considere d for best overall response.
Radiographi c progression will be determined according to PCWG -modified RECIST 1.1. 
Disease progression in bone lesions should be confirmed by anothe r bone scan ≥6 weeks 
after site- assessed first radiologic evidence of progression is initially observed.
End ofTreatment and Follow- up Tumor Imaging
For participants who discontinue study intervention, tumor imaging should be performed at 
the time of treatment discontinuation (± 4-week window). If previous imaging was obtained 
within 4 weeks before the date of discontinuation, imaging at treatment discontinuation is not 
mandatory.
For participants who discontinue study intervention without documented disease progression, 
every effort shou ld be made to continue monitoring disease status by tumor imaging with the 
same schedule used while on treatment (every 9 weeks in Year 1 or every 12 weeks after 
Year 1) until the start of a new anticancer treatment, disease progression, death, withdrawal 
of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first.

the start of a new anticancer treatment
death
withdrawal of consent
the end of the study
Second Course (Retreatment) Tumor Imaging
NOTE: As of Amendment 06, the study will be stopped due to futility and second 
course treatment is not an option for participants . There are currently no participant s 
in the Second Course Phase.
Tumor imaging must be performed within 28days before restarting treatment with 
pembrolizumab. Local reading (investigator assessment with site radiology reading) will be 
used to determine eligibility. 
Response assessments an d progressive disease are determined by investigator assessment. 
The only Second Course scan to be provided to the iCRO is the baseline scan if it is the final 
scan for the Initial Treatment or First Course.
The first on -study imaging assessment should be performed at 9 weeks ( 63days ±7 days) 
after the restart of treatment. Subsequent tumor imaging should be performed every 12weeks 
(84days ±7 days) or more frequently, if clinically indicated.
Imaging should continue to be performed until disease p rogression, the start of a new 
anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, death, or notification by the Sponsor, whichever 
occurs first.
For participants who discontinue Second Course study intervention, tumor imaging should be 
performed at the time of i ntervention discontinuation (± 4-week window). If previous imaging 
was obtained within 4 weeks before the date of discontinuation, imaging at intervention 
discontinuation is not mandatory. F or participants who discontinue study intervention due to 
documente d disease progression, this is the final required tumor imaging.
For participants who discontinue Second Course study intervention without documented 
disease progression, every effort should be made to continue monitoring their disease status 
by radiologic imaging every 12 weeks (84 days ±7 days) until the start of a new anticancer 
treatment, disease progression, death, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first.

8.2.2 Prostate -specific Antigen Assessments
Two components are required f or defining trial eligi bility in terms of PSA: 1) rising PSA as 
determined by the local lab oratory and 2) PSA ≥ 1 ng/mL as determined by the central 
laboratory . PSA determination by the central laboratory must be performed within 10 days 
before randomization (Section 1.3.1). If this central laboratory result for PSA is not expected 
to be available to the site before randomization, the investigator may also perform the test 
locally, and,ifPSA is ≥1 ng/m L, may use that result to determine eligibility. However, a 
sample must still be collected within 10 days before randomization for submission to the 
central laboratory. During the remainder of the study, the local laboratory may not be used in 
lieu of central la boratory results.
For defining rising PSA ,the reference value to use (# 1) is the last PSA value before a
sequence of PSA increases (see Figure 2below from Prostate Ca ncer Working Group 2).
Figure 2Change in Prostate -specific Antigen
Thescreening value obtained during the screening period can count as the confirmatory 
second rising PSA value compared with a prior single increased PSA value . If a PSA value 
during screening is used as the second data point to confirm rising PSA and does not confirm 
the PSA rise but is still greater than the reference point, PSA determination should be 
repeated by the local laboratory in 1 week to prove that there is a sequence of rising PSA 
values .
If there are 2 con secutive rising PSA values before screening but the local laboratory value is 
less than the previous value (but still above the reference value), the participan t is still 
eligible for the study.

If a local laboratory PSA value obtained during screening is less than the reference point, this 
constitutes a new PSA nadir ,and another sequence of 2 risi ng PSA values is needed to 
ensure that PSA is rising.
8.2.3 Tumor Tissue Collection
Baseline tumor tissue for biomarker analysis must be sent to the testing laboratory and 
analyzed for adequacy before enrollment. Details of tumor tissue submission are in the 
Procedures Manual.
8.2.4 PROs and Quality of Life Assessments
As of Amendment 06: PROs and Quality of Life assessments will be discontinued .The 
subsections below are retained for reference. 
The FACT -P, EuroQoL EQ -5D-5L,and BPI -SFquestionnaires and the A nalgesic Log 
should be administered per the SoA in Section 1.3 .1. B oth the FACT- P and the EQ-5D-5L
will be administered at the site, while the BPI -SF and A nalgesic Logwill be completed by 
the participant at home. It is best practice and strongly recommended that electronic 
patient -reported outcomes (ePROs) are adminis tered to rando mized participants before study 
intervention administration, AE evaluation, and disease status notification. If the participant 
does not complete the ePROs at a scheduled time point, the MISS_MODE form must be 
completed to capture the reason that the assessment was not performed. Site staff must not 
read, administer ,or complete the PRO questionnaires for the participant. If the participant is 
unable to read the questionnaire ( eg, is blind or illiterate), that participant may still participate
in the study, but is exempted from completing PRO questionnaires, including the Analgesic 
Log. Participants exempted in this regard should be flagged appropriately by the site staff .
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Prostate (FACT -P)
FACT -P was dev eloped as a disease -specific adjunct to the FACT measurement system, and
consists of FACT -G (general) ,which is a 27-item self -report questionnaire measuring 
general HRQoL in 4 domains (physical, social, emotional, and functional well -being) ,and 
12prostate cancer- specific items. FACT -P (version 4) is self –administered and requires 
approximately 8 to 10 minutes to complete.
EQ-5D-5L
The 5 health state dimensions in the EQ -5D-5Linclude mobility, self -care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, and anxie ty/depression. Each dimension is rated on a 5- point scale from 
1(no problem) to 5 (unable to/extreme problems). The EQ -5D-5Lalso includes a graded 
(0to 100) vertical visual analog scale on which t he participant rates his general state of 
health at the t ime of the assessment.

Brief Pain Inventory- Short Form (BPI -SF) and Analgesic Log
BPI-SF
The BPI -SF is provided on an ePRO device and will be completed by the participant daily for 
7 consecutive days at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 1.3 .1).It does not have to 
be completed at the site.
The BPI -SF has 15 items that are rate don a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale, with 0 =No Pain and 
10=Worst Pain Imaginable. This instrument consists of 2 domains, pain severity and pain 
interference. The pain sever ity domain includes 4 items (Items 3, 4, 5, and 6) ,which assess 
pain at its “worst,” “least,” “average,” and “now” (c urrent pain) respectively on an 11-point 
scale. In this study, the “worst pain” ( Item 3) will be used as a single item in assessing pain 
progression. Acomposite pain severity score from all 4 i tems will also be evaluated as “ pain 
severity progression”. A≥2-point change in the average pain severity or in “worst pain” item 
is considered clinically meaningful.
The pain interference domain sco re is a mean of 7 items: general activity ( Item 9A), mood 
(Item 9B), walking ability ( Item 9C), normal work ( Item 9D), relations with other people 
(Item 9E), sleep ( Item 9F), and enjoyment of life ( Item 9G), each score d on an 11- point scale 
from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). Based on the BPI -SF scoring 
manual [Cleeland, C. S. 2009] , the following items are not used in scoring pain severity or 
pain interference domains: Items 1, 2, 7, and 8. Ite m 7 (a free text field) describing pain 
medication use is captured separately in more detail, using the Analgesic Log.
Analgesic Log
The Analgesic L og is a paper form that will be completed by the participant daily for 
7consecutive days per t he SoA (Section 1.3.1). Participants will record all analge sic 
medication dosages and dose times. TheAnalgesic Log is study-specific (not generic). A ll 
medications captured in the paper log will be reconc iled at every visit with the concomitant 
medications data to address any discrepanc ies.
8.3 Safety Assessments
Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA.
8.3.1 Physical Examinations
Full Physical Examination
The investigator or qualified designee will perform a complete physical exam ination during 
the Screening period. C linically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as medical 
history. The time points for full physical exam ination s are given in Section 1.3 .1. A fter the 
first dose of study intervention, new clinically significant abnormal findings should be 
recorded as A Es.

illnesses.
Directed Physical Examination
Incycles that do not required a full physical exam ination as defined in Section 1.3.1 , the 
investigator or qualified designee will perform a directed physical exam ination as clinically 
indicated before study intervention administration. New,clinically sign ificant abnormal 
findings should be recorded as Ae s.
8.3.2 Vital Signs
Vital signs will be measured with the participant in a sitting, semi recumbent, or supine 
position after 5 minutes ofrest,and will include temperature, systolic and diastolic BP , 
heart rate ,and respiratory rate. R ecord vital signs before study intervention 
administration at treatment visits.
8.3.3 Electrocardiograms
A standard 12- lead ECG will be performed once at the screening visit using local 
standard procedures. Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as 
medical history.
8.3.4 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
Refer to Appendix 2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the 
SoA for the timing and frequency.
The investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) 
must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically
relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the case report form 
(CRF). The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the 
underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for 
the participant's condition.
All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2 , must be 
conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA.
If laboratory values from nonprotocol specified laboratory assessments performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in study participant management or are 
considered clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose
modification), then the results must be recorded in the appropriate CRF (eg, SLAB).
For any laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation in the study or within 30days after the last dose of study intervention , every 
attempt should be made to perform repeat assessments until the values return to normal or 
baseline or if a new baseline is established as determined by the investigator .

per participant, are in the Study Procedures Manual. Refer to Section 1.3 for the timing of 
laboratory assessments.
Laboratory Safety Evaluations (Hematology, Chemistry, and Urinalysis)
Laboratory tests for hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis are specified in Appendix 2.
8.3.5 Performance Assessments
Eastern Cooper ative Oncology Group Performance Scale
The investigator or qualified designee will assess ECOG performance status (Appendix 11) 
at screening (within 7 days of randomization) and before dosing during the study intervention
period as specified in the SoA (Se ction 1.3.1).
8.4 Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Other Reportable 
Safety Events
The definitions of an AE or SAE, as well as the method of recording, evaluating, and 
assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures for completing and transmitting AE, 
SAE, and other reportable safety event reports can be found in Appendix 3 .
Adverse events, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be reported by the participant 
(or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized 
representative).
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE as well as other reportable safety events. 
Investigators remain responsible for following up AEs , SAEs, and other reportable safety 
events for outcome according to Section 8.4.3.
The investigator, who is a qualified physician, will assess events that meet the definition of 
an AE or SAE as well as other reportable safety events with respect to seriousness, 
intensity/toxicity and causality .
8.4.1 Time Period and Frequency for Coll ecting AE, SAE ,and Other Reportable 
Safety Event Information
All AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events that occur after the consent form is signed 
but before intervention allocation/randomization must be reported by the investigator if the 
partici pant is receiving placebo run -in or other run -in treatment, if the event cause the 
participant to be excluded from the study, or is the result of a protocol -specified intervention, 
including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, d iet, or a procedure.

All AEs from the time of intervention allocation/randomization through 30 days 
following cessation of study intervention must be reported by the investigator.
All AEs meeting serious crit eria, from the time of intervention allocation/r andomization 
through 90 days following cessation of study intervention or 30 days following cessation 
of study intervention if the participant initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is 
earlier, must be reported by the investigator.
All pregnancies and exposure during breastfee ding, from the time of intervention
allocation/randomization through 120 days following cessation of study intervention, or 
30 days following cessation of study intervention if the participant initiates new 
anticancer therapy must be reported by the investigator.
For Pharmacovigilance purposes and characterization, any SAE of MDS/AML or new 
primary malignancy occurring after the 30 day follow up period should be reported to the 
Sponsor regardless of investigator’s assessment of causality or knowledge of the 
treatment arm. Investigators will be asked during the regular follow up for OS if the 
participant has developed MDS/AML or a new primary malignancy and prompted to 
report any such cases.
Additionally, any SAE brought to the atten tion of an investigator at any time outside of 
the time period specified above must be reported immediately to the Sponsor if the event 
is considered related to study intervention .
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE sor SAEs or other repor table safety events 
in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a 
death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she 
considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, 
the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.
All initial and follow -up AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be recorded and 
reported to the Sponsor or designee within the time frames as indicated in Table 11.

including pregnancy and exposure during breastfeeding, events of clinical interest (ECI s), 
cancer, and overdose will be followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is 
otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3). In 
addition, the investigator will make every attempt to follow all nonserious AEs that occur in 
randomized participants for outcome. Further information on follow -up procedures is given 
in Appendix 3.
8.4.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAE
Prompt notification (within 24 hours) by the investigator to the Sponsor of SAE is essential 
so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the 
safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply w ith country -specific regulatory requirements and global laws and 
regulations relating to safety reporting to regulatory authorities , IRB/IECs, and investigators.
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSAR s) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and 
forwarded to investigators as necessary.
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAE) from the Sponsor will file it 
along with the I Band will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
8.4.5 Pregnancy and Exposure During Breastfeeding
Although pregnancy and infant exposure during breastfee ding are not considered A es, any 
pregnancy or infant exposure during breastfeeding in a participant’s female partner 
(spontaneously reported to the investigator or their designee) that occurs during the study are 
reportable to the Sponsor.
All reported pregnancies of participants’ female partners must be followed to the 
completion/termination of the pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, 
missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, 
miscarriage, and stillbirth must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If 
the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported.
8.4.6 Disease -related Events and/or Disease -related Outcomes Not Qualifying as 
AEs or SAEs
Efficacy endpoints as outlined in this section will not be reported to the Sponsor as described 
in Section 8.4.1.
Specifically, the suspected/actual events covered in this exception include any event that is 
disease progression of the cancer under study.

The Sponsor will monitor unblinded aggregated efficacy endpoint events and safety data to 
ensure the safety of the participants in the study. Any suspected endpoint that on review is 
not progression of the cancer under study will be forwarded to Glo bal Pharmacovigilance as 
an SAE within 24 hours of determination that the event is not progression of the cancer under 
study.
8.4.7 Events of Clinical Interest (ECI s)
Selected nonserious and SAEs are also known as ECIs and must be reported to the Sponsor. 
Event s of clinical interest for this study include: 
1.An overdose of Sponsor's product, as defined in Section 8.5, that is not associated with 
clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results.
2.An elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of 
normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X the 
upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less 
than 2X the upper limit of normal, as determined by way of protocol -specified laboratory 
testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.* 
*Note: These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The 
purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require 
an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology. The study site guidance for 
assessment and follow up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator Study File 
Binder (or equivalent) .
3.Any event of MDS/AML, new primary malignancy, or pneumonitis should be reported 
whether it is considered a non- serious AE (eg non -melanoma skin cancer) or SAE and 
regardless of investigator’s assessment of causality.
8.5 Treatment of Overdose
For this study, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1000 mg or 
greater ( ≥5 times the indicated dose).
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. In the 
event of overdose, the participant should be observed closely for signs of toxicity. 
Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.
Olaparib must only be used in accordance with the dosing recommendations in this protocol.
Any dose or frequency of dosing that exceeds the dosing regimen specified in this protocol 
should be reported a s an overdose.

(63 days ± 7 days) through Week 54 and every 12 weeks (84 days ± 7 days) thereafter, from 
the date of randomization, to coincide with the imaging schedule at the time of 
discontinuation from study intervention. P articipants who discontinue study intervention 
without documented confirmed disease progression should conti nue monitoring of disease 
status by radiologic imaging (CT/MRI and bone scans) and PSA determinations according to 
the imaging schedule at the time of discontinuation (every 9 or 12 weeks). Every effort 
should be made to collect information regarding disea se sta tus until the start of new 
anticancer therapy, disease progression, death, or the end of the study, or if the participant 
begins retreatment with pembrolizu mab as detailed in Section 6.6.7 . Information regarding 
poststudy anticancer treatment will be collected if new treatment is initiated .Participants 
who completed all efficacy assessments and/or will not have further efficacy assessments 
must enter the Survival Follow- up Phase.
Participants who are eligible to receive retreatment w ith pembrolizumab according to the

assessment follow -up visit has been performed.
8.12.6 Survival Status
To ensure that curre nt and complete survival data are available at the time of database locks, 
updated survival status may be requested during the study by the Sponsor. F or example, 
updated survival status may be requested before but not limited to an eDMC review, interim ,
and/or final analysis. OnSponsor notification, all participants who do not/will not have a 
scheduled study visit or study contact during t he Sponsor -defined period will be contacted 
for their survival status ( excluding participants with a previously recorded death event in the 
collection tool).
9 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN
As of Amendment 0 6: The Statistical Ana lysis Plan is amended as follow s.
NOTE: Based on the d ata from an interim safety and efficacy for KEYLYNK -010 (data 
cutoff 1 8-JAN-2022) , eDMC recommended stopping the study for futility because it was 
extremely unlikely that the efficacy boundary for study success would be reached at the next 
(final) analysis. In addition, the e DMC indicated that continuing the trial raised the risk of 
undue toxicities (Grade 3 to 5 AEs and d rug-related SAE s) to patients receiving 
investigational therapy which were greater in the investigational arm compared to control.
Based upon these data and the recommendation of the eDMC, the study was unblinded (as of 
11-M AR-2022). The prespecified final analysi s of the study described in the SAP will not be 
performed. Selected analyses of safety endpoint swill be performed at the end of the study; 
there will be no further analyses of efficacy and PRO endpoints. 
This section outlines the statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study. The study 
has been unblinded (as of 11-M AR-2022) . Changes made to primary and/or key secondary 
hypotheses or the statistical methods related to those hypotheses that occurred prior to 
Amendment 06 were document edin previous protocol amendments(s) (consistent with 
International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for 
Human Use Guideline [ICH] E9). C hanges to exploratory or other non confirmat ory analyses 
made after the protocol has been fin alized, but before the final database lock, will be

documented i n a supplemental Statistical Analysis Plan (sSAP) and referenced in the clinical 
study r eport (CSR) for the study. Post hoc exploratory analyses will be clearly identified in 
the CSR. Otherplanned analyses (ie , those speci fic to the analysis of PROs and FBR ) are 
beyond the scope of this document or will be documented in separate analysis plans.
9.1 Statistical Analysis Pla n Summary
Key elements of the SAP are summarized here. The comprehensive plan is provided in 
Sections 9.2 through 9.12. As of Amendment 06, the prespecified final analys is of the study 
described in the SAP will not be performed. Selected analyses of safety endpoints will be 
performed at the end of the study; there will be no further analyses of efficacy and PRO 
endpoints. The SAP summary has been updated accordingly. 
Study Design Overview A Phase 3 Randomized Open -label Study of Pembrolizumab (MK -3475) Plu s 
Olapari b versus Abiraterone Acetate or Enzalutamide in Participants with 
Metastatic Castration -resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Who are Unselected for 
Homologous Recombination Repair Defects and Have Failed Prior Treatment 
with One Next -generation Hormo nalAgent (NHA) and Chemotherapy
(KEYLYNK- 010)
Treatment Assignment Approximately 780 eligible participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of 
the following 2 study intervention arms:
Arm 1: pembrolizumab plus olaparib
Arm 2: abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide
Randomization stratification factors are:
Measurable disease at baseline: y es versus no
Prior NHA treatment: abiraterone acetate versus enzalutamide
As of Amendment 06, all ongoing participants may have the option to cont inue 
receiving study intervention or SOC, until criteria for discontinuation are met, if 
they are deriving clinical benefit.

2.Radiographic progression -free s urvival (rPFS)
Key Secondary Endpoint Time to initiation of the firs t subsequent antic ancer therapy or death (TFST)
Statistical Methods for
Key Efficacy AnalysesThe primary hypotheses will be evaluated by comparing pembrolizumab plus 
olaparib to abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide with respect to rPFS, TFST, and 
OS using a stratified l og-rank test. The hazard ratio will be estimated using a 
stratified Cox regression model. Event rates over time will be estimated within 
each study intervention group using the Kaplan -Meier method.
Statistical Methods for
Key Safety AnalysesThe analysis of safety results will follow a tiered approach. The tiers differ with 
respect to the analyses that will be performed. There are no events of interest that 
warrant elevation to Tier 1 in this study. Tier2 parameters will be assessed via 
point estimates with 95% C Is provided for between -group comparison; only point 
estimates by study intervention group are provided for Tier 3 safety parameters.
The 95% C Is for the between -treatment differences in percentages will be provided 
using the Miettinen and Nurminen method.

Interim AnalysesAs of Amendment 06, the prespecified final analys is of the study described in the 
SAP will not be performed. 
Two IAswill be performed in this study. Results will be reviewed by an eDMC . 
These IAsare summarized below. Details are provided in Section 9.7.
IA1: 
oTiming: To be performed when at least 360 rPFS events and at least 
241 OS events (target number of OS events ) are observed 
(approximately 17 months after the first participant is randomized). If 
rPFS event number achieves but OS event number does notachieve, 
IA1may be delayed for up to 3 months as long as the enrollment is 
complete .
oTesting: primary analysis for rPFS , primary analysis for TFST, and IA
for OS .
IA2: 
oTiming: To be performed when at least 386 OS events (target number 
of OS events) are observed (approximately 23 months after the first 
participant is randomized). IA2 should be conducted at least 6 months 
after the last participant israndomized .
oTesting: IAfor OS .
Multiplicity The Type I error rate over the multiple endpoints tested, as well as for the multiple 
analyses planned, will be strongly controlled at 2.5% (one -sided) by sequential 
interim monitoring and the methods of Maurer and Bretz [Maurer, W. 2013] . A
total of 2.0% Type I error rate is initially allocated to test OS superiority between 
2 arms ,and a total of 0.5% Type I error rate is initially allocated to t est rPFS 
superiority between 2 arms.
Sampl eSizeand PowerAs of Amendment 06, no final analys is of the study will be performed.
The planned samp le size is approximately 78 0 participants ,with approximately 
520 and 260 in the pembrolizumab and olaparib and abiraterone/enzalutamide 
arms,respectively. For rPFS, with 432 rPFS events, the study has approximately 
95% power to demonstrate that pembrolizumab + olaparib is superior to 
abiraterone/enzalutamide ( HR: 0.65) at an overall 1- sided 0. 5% α level. For OS, 
with 482 OS events, the study has about 90% power to demonstrate that 
pembrolizu mab and olaparib is superior t o abiraterone/enzalutamide ( HR: 0.725 ) 
at an initial over all 1-sided 2.0% α level.
9.2 Responsibility for Analyses/In -house Blinding
The statistical analysis of the data obtained from this study will be the responsibility of the 
Clinical Biostatistics department of the Sponsor.
The Clinical Biostatistics department of the Sponsor will generate the randomized allocation 
schedule for study intervention assignment for this protocol ,and the randomization will be 
implemented in an IRTby a stu dy vendor.
This study will be conduct ed as an unblinded, open -label study (ie,particip ants, 
investigators, and Sponsor personnel will be aware of participant treatment assignments after 
each participant is enrolled and treatment is assigned ). Although the study is open- label,

9.5 Analysis Populati ons
9.5.1 Efficacy Analysis Populations
The ITT population will serve as the primary population for the analysis of efficacy data in 
this study. A ll randomized participants will be included in this population. Participants will 
be included in the treatment group to which they were randomized for the analysis of 
efficac y data using the ITT population.
9.5.2 Safety Analysis Populations
Safety a nalyses will be conducted in the A PaT population, which consists of all randomized 
participants who received at l east 1 dose of study intervention. P articipants wi ll be included 
in the study intervention group corresponding to the study intervention they actually received 
for the analysis of safety data using the A PaT popula tion. This will be the study intervention
group to which t hey were randomized except for participants who take incorrect study 
intervention for the entire treatment period; such participants w ill be included in the study 
intervention group corresponding to the study intervention actually received.
At least 1 laboratory, vital sign, or ECG measurement obtained after at least 1 dose of study 
intervention is required for inclusion in the analysis of the respective safety parameter. To 
assess change from baseline, a baseline measurement is also required.
Details o fthe approach to handling safety analyses are provided in Section 9.6.2.
9.5.3 PRO Analysis Population
The PRO analyses are based on the PRO full analysis set (FAS) population, defined as 
participants who have at least 1 PRO assessment available and have received a t least 1 dose 
of study intervention.
9.6 Statistical Methods
NOTE: As of Amendment 06, the prespecified final analys is of the study described in the 
SAP will not be performed. Selected analyses of safety endpoints will be performed at end of 
study; there will be no further analyses of efficacy and PRO endpoints. The subsections 
below are retained for reference.
Statistical testing and inference for safety analyses are described in Section 9.6.2 . Methods 
related to exploratory objectives will be described in the sSAP. Efficacy results that will be 
deemed to be statistically significant after consideration of the Type I error control strategy 
are descri bed in Section 9.8 . Nominal p -values may be computed for other efficacy analyses, 
but should be interpreted with caution due to potential issues of multiplicity , sample size, etc. 
Unless otherwise stated, all statistical tests will be conducted at the α=0.05 (2 -sided) level . If
there are a small number of responses/ events in one or more strata, for the purpose of 
analysis strata will be combined to ensure sufficient number of responses/ events in each

stratum. D etails regarding the combining of strata will be specified in the sSAP before
database lock based on a blinded review of r esponse counts by stratum.
9.6.1 Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analyses
This section describes the statistical methods that address the primary and key secondary
objectives. M ethods related to other objectives will be described in the sSAP.
OS
The nonparametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the survival curves. The 
treatment difference in survival will be assessed by the stratified log -rank test (based on the 
stratification factors def ined in Section 6.3.2). A stratified Cox proportional hazard mod el 
with Efron’ s method of tie handling will be used to assess the magnitude of the treatment 
difference (ie, HR ). The HR and its 95% CI from the stratified Cox model with a single 
treatment co variate will be reported. The stratification factors used for randomization 
(Section 6.3.2) will be applied to both the stratified log- rank test and the stratified Cox 
model. 
Participants without documented death at the time of analysis will be censored a t the date of 
last known contact. The restricted mean survival time ( RMST )method proposed by Uno et al
[Uno, H., et al 2014] may be used for OS to account for the possible nonproportional hazards 
effect.
rPFS
The non parametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the r PFS curve in each 
study intervention group. The treatment difference in rPFS will be assessed by the stratified 
log-rank test. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron’ s method of tie handling 
will be used to assess the magnitude of the treatment difference (ie, HR) between the study 
intervention arms. The HR and its 95% CIfrom the stratified Cox model with Efron’ s 
method of tie handling and with a single treatment cova riate will be reported. The 
stratification factors used for randomization (Section 6.3.2) will be applied to both the 
stratified log- rank test and the stratified Cox model.
Since disease progression is assessed per iodically, PD can occur any time between t he last 
assessment where PD was not documented and the assessment when PD is documented. The 
true date of disease progression will be approximated by the date of the first assessment at 
which PD is objectively documented per PCWG -modified RECIST 1.1 by BIC R. Death is 
always considered as a confirmed PD event. Participants who do not experience a n rPFS 
event will be censored at the last disease assessment. Sensitivity analyses will be performed 
for comparison of r PFS based on the investigator ’s assessment. 
To evaluate the robustness of the rPFS endpoint, 1 primary and 2 sensitivity analyses with a 
different set of censoring rules will be performed. For the primary analysis, if the events (PD 
or death) ar e immediately after more than 1 missed disease assessme nt, the data are censored 
at the last disease assessment before missing visits. In addition, data after new anti cancer 
086YCG

MK-7339 -010-06FINAL PROTOCOL 02-MAY -2022
therapy are censored at the last disease assessment before the initiation of new anti cancer 
therapy.
The first sensitivity analysis follows the ITT principle; PDs/deaths are counted as events 
regardless of missed study v isits or initiation of new anti cancer therapy. The second 
sensitivity analysis considers discontinuation of study intervention or initiation of an 
anticancer treatment after discontinuation of study intervention due to reasons other than CR, 
whichever occurs later, to be a PD event for participants without documented PD or death . If 
a participant meets multiple criteria for censoring, the c ensoring criterion that occurs earliest 
will be applied. The censoring rules for primary and sensitivity analyses are summarized in
Table 12.

TFST
The nonparametric Kaplan- Meier method will be used to estimate the TF ST curve in each 
treatment arm . The treatment difference in TFST will be assessed by the stratified log -rank 
test. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron ’s method of tie handli ng will be 
used to assess the magnitude of the treatment difference (ie, HR) between the treatment arms. 
The HR and its 95% CI  from the stratified Cox model with Efron ’s method of tie handling 
and with a single treatment covariate will be reported. The str atification factors used for 
randomization (Section 6.3.2) will be applied to both the stratified log -rank test and the 
stratified Cox model.

9.6.2 Statistical Methods for Safety Analyses
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters including 
AEs, laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG measurements. 
The analysis of safety results will follow a tiered approach (Table 14). The tiers differ with 
respect to the analyses that will be performed. Adverse experiences (specific terms as well as 
system organ class terms) and events that meet predefined limits of change in laboratory and 
vital signs and ECG parameters a re either prespecified as Tier 1 endpoints or will be 
classified as belonging to Tier 2 or Tier 3, based on the observed proportions of participants 
with an event.
Tier 1 Events
Safety parameters or AE s of special interest that are identified a priori constitute Tier 1 s afety 
endpoints that will be participant to inferential testing for statistical significance.
AEs of special interest that are immune -mediated or potentially immune -mediated are well
documented and will be evaluated separately; however, these events have b een characterized 
consistently throughout the pembrolizumab clinical development program and determination 
of statistical significance is not expected to add value to the safety evaluation. F inally, there 
are no known A Es associated with participants with prostate cancer for which determination 
of a p -value is expected to impact the safety assessment. Therefore, there are no Tier 1 events 
for this protocol.
Tier 2 Events
Tier 2 parameters will be assessed via point estimates with 95% C Is provided for differ ences 
in the proportion of participants with events using the Miettinen and Nurminen method, an 
unconditional, asymptotic method [Miettinen, O. 1985] .
Membership in Tier 2 requires that at le ast 10% of participa nts in any study intervention
group show the event; all other A Es and predefined limits of change will belong to Tier 3. 
The threshold of at least 10% of participants was chosen for Tier 2 events because the 
population enrolled in this study are in critical condition and usually experience various A Es 
of similar types regardless of treatment; events reported less frequently than 10% of 
participants would obscure assessment of the overall safety profile and add little to the 
interpretation of potentia lly meaningful treatment differences. In addition, Grade 3 to 5 AEs 
(≥5%of participants in 1 of the treatment groups) and SAEs ( ≥5%of participants in 1 of the 
treatment groups) will be considered Tier 2 endpoints. Because many 95% C Is may be 
provided wit hout adjustment for multiplicity, the C Is should be regarded as a helpful 
descriptive measure to be used in safety review, not a formal method for assessing the 
statistical significance of the between -group differences in AEs and safety parameters that 
meet predefined limits of change .

estimates by treatment group are provided for Tier 3 safety parameters.

9.6.3 Analysis Methods for PRO Endpoints
For TTPP , the Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the survival curves for TTPP , 
separately, in each study intervention arm. In addition, corresponding survival curves will be 
estimated by study intervention arm. Stratified Cox proport ional hazards models with Efron’ s 
method of tie handling will be used to assess the magnitude of the treatment differ ence. 
Stratification factors used for randomization will be used in the stratified Cox proportional 
hazards models. The HR, 95% CI, and nominal p -value will be reported.
Details of additional PRO analyses will be included in the sSAP.

9.6.4 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
The comparability of the study intervention groups for each relevant demographic and 
baseline characteristi c will be assessed using tables and/or graphs. No statistical hypothesis 
tests will be performed on these characteristics. The number and percentage of participants 
screened and randomized and the primary reason for screening failure and discontinuation 
will be displayed. D emographic variables, baseline characteristics, primary and secondary 
diagnoses, and prior and concomitant therapies will be summarized by study intervention
either by descriptive statistics or categorical tables.
9.7 Interim Analyses
NOTE: As of Amendment 06, the prespecified final analys is of the study described in the 
SAP will not be performed. This section is retained for reference. 
AneDMC will serve as the primary reviewer of the results of the IAsand will make 
recommendations for discontinuation of the study or protocol modifications to an Executive 
Oversight Committee (EOC) of the Sponsor. Depending on the recommendation of the 
eDMC, the Sponsor may prepare a regulatory submission. Additional logistic details, 
revisions to the above plan ,and data monitoring guidance will be provided in the eDMC 
Charter .
9.7.1 Efficacy Interim Analyses
Two IAsand a final analysis are planned for this study. There is no plan to stop the study 
before superiority hypotheses for OS have been adequately evaluated. However, earlier 
positive findings may form the basis for earlier regulatory submission based on the 
recommendation of the eDMC. The f inal analysis is to be performed approximately 
29months after the first participant is randomized .
The analyses planned, endpoints evaluated, and drivers of the timing are summarized in
Table 15. Type I error control for the efficacy analyses, as well as efficacy bounds ,are 
described in S ection 9.8.

The key secondary TFST hypothesis will be tested at the time of IA1. The TFST hypothesis 
is initially allocated a Type I error =0% and thus cannot be tested unless the rPFS null 
hypothesis has been rejected. If the rPFS null hypothesis has been rejected and the OS null 
hypothesis has not been rejected, then the TFST hypothesis will be tested at a Type I error of 
0.5%. If both the rPFS and OS null hypotheses have been rejected, then the TFST hypothesis 
will be tested at a Type I error level of α=2.5%.

9.8.4 Safety Analyses
The eDMC has responsibility for assessment of overall risk /benefit. When prompted by
safety concerns, the eDMC can request corresponding efficacy data. External DMC review of
efficacy data to assess the overall risk /benefit to study participants will not require a
multiplicity adjustment typically associated with a planned efficacy IA. However, to account 
for any multiplicity concerns raised by the eDMC review of unplanned efficacy data 
prompted by safety concerns, a sensitivity analysis for efficacy endpoints adopting a 
conservative multiplicity adjustment will be prespecified in the sSAP. This analysis will be 
performed i f requested by the eDMC.
9.9 Sample Size and Power Calculations
NOTE: As of Amendment 06, the prespecified final analys is of the study described in the 
SAP will not be performed. This section is retained for reference.
The sam ple size is estimated based on the primary endpoint OS. 
A total of approximately 780 participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the 
pembrolizumab and olaparib armand the abiraterone/enz alutamide arm;approximately 
520and 260 participants ,respectively.
The final analysis of OS is event -driven and will be conducted after at least 482 OS events 
(target number of OS events) have been observed between the 2 treatment arm s unless OS is 
proven at an earlier IA. It is expected to occ ur around 29 months after the first participant is 
randomized (depending on enrollment rate and event accumulation rate). The f inal analysis 
should be conducted at least 12months after the last participant israndomized tomaintain 
sufficient minimal foll ow-up duration.

MK-7339 -010-06FINAL PROTOCOL 02-MAY -2022
With 482 OS even ts, the study has approximately 90% (91.5%) power to demonstrate that 
men treated with pembrolizumab and olaparib have a longer median OS than do those treated 
with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide at a 1- sided significance level of 0.020 (0.025) if the 
underlying constant HR is 0.725. Sample size and power calculations are based on the 
following assumptions: 1) an HR of 0.725 where OSfollows an exponential distribution with 
a median of 14.5 months in the pembrolizumab and olaparib arm and a median of 10.5
months in the control arm ; 2) IAsfor effica cy evaluation as outlined in Section 9.7, 3) an 
enrollment rate of 60 participants per month with a 6- month ramp- up time ;and 4 ) an 
approximately monthly dropout rate of 0.2%.
The final analysis of rPFS will be conducted when (1) enrollment is complete ,(2) at least 
360 rPFS events are observed, and (3) at least 241OS events ( target number of OS events ) 
are observed . If rPFS event number achieves but OS event number does notachieve, IA1 
may be delayed for up to 3 months. It is expected to occur around 17 months after the first 
participant is randomized (depending on enrollment rate and event accumulation rate) ,with 
about 432 rPFS events. 
With 432 rPFS events , the study has approximately 95% (98%) power to demonstrate that 
men treated with pembrolizumab + olaparib have a longer median rPFS than do those treated 
with abiraterone or enzalutamide at a 1- sided significance level of 0.005 (0.025) if the 
underlying constant HR is 0.65. These calculations are based on the following assumptions: 
1) anHR of 0.65 where rPFS follows an exponential distribution with a median of 
4.6months in the pembrolizum ab and olaparib armand a median of 3 months in the control 
group ,2) IAsfor efficacy evaluation as outlined in Section 9.7,3) an enrollment rate of 60 
participant s per month with a 6- month ramp- up time ;and 4) a monthly dropout rate of 5%.
The final analysis of TFST will be conducted at IA1,and approximately 432TFST events are 
expected . With 432 TFST events, the study has approximately 95% (98%) power to 
demonstrate that mentreated with pembrolizumab andolaparib have a longer median TFST
than do those treated with abiraterone or enzaluta mide at a 1 -sided significance level of 0.005 
(0.025) if the underlying constant HR is 0.65. These calculations are based on the following 
assumptions: 1) a nHR of 0.65 where TFST follows an exponential distribution with a 
median of 4.6 months in the pembrolizumab and olaparib arm and a median of 3 months in 
the control arm, 2) IAsfor efficacy evaluation as outlined in Section 9.7, 3) an enrollment 
rate of 60 participants per mont h with a 6- month ramp- up time ;and 4) a monthly dropout 
rate of 5%.
The sample size and power calculations for rPFS, TFST, and OS were performed using
software R (package “gsDesign”) and EAST 6.4.

9.10 Subgroup Analyses
To determine whether the treatment effect is consistent across various subgroups, the 
estimate of the between- group treatment effect (with a nominal 95% CI) for the primary 
endpoint swill be estimated and plotted within each category of the following classification 
variables:
Age group :<65years versus ≥65years
Race :white versus nonwhite
ECOG performance status : 0 versus 1
Measurable disease at baseline : yes versus no
Prior NHA treatment: abiraterone acetate versus enzalutamide
In addition, a f orest plot will be produced, which provides the estimated point e stimates and 
CIs for the treatment effect across the categories of subgroups listed above.
Ifthere are a small number of responses/ events in one or more strata, then, for analysis ,strata 
will be combined to ensure a sufficient number of responses/ events in each stratum . Details 
regarding the combining of strata will be specified in the sSAP before database lock based on 
a blinded review of response counts by stratum.
9.11 Compliance (Me dication Adherence)
Drug accountability data for study intervention will be collected during the study. Any 
deviation from protocol -directed administration will be reported.
9.12 Extent of Exposure
The extent of exposure for olaparib, abiraterone, and enzalutam idewill be summarized as 
duration of treatment in days . The extent of exposure for pembrolizumab will be summarized 
as duration of treatment in cycles . Dose interruption for each drug and dose reduction or dose 
increase for olaparib will be summarized. Su mmar y statistics will be provided for extent of 
exposure for the APaT population.

10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL 
CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Appendix 1: Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations
10.1.1 Code of Conduct for Clinical Trials
Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, Rahway, NJ, USA (MSD)
Code of Conduct for Interventional Clinical Trials
I. Introduction
A.Purpose
MSD, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our 
products. As such , we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing and reporting these trials 
in compliance with the highest ethical and scientific standards. Protection of participant s inclinical trials is the 
overriding concern in the design of clinic al trials . In all cases, M SD clinical trials will be conducted in compliance 
with local and/or national regulations (eg, International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice [ICH -
GCP]) and in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
B.Scope
Highest ethical and scientific standards shall be endorsed for all clinical interventional investigations sponsored by 
MSD irrespective of the party (parties) employed for their execution (eg, contract research organizations, 
collaborative research efforts). This Code is not intended to apply to trials that are observational in nature, or 
which are retrospective. Further, this Code does not apply to investigator -initiated trials , which are not under the 
full control of M SD.
II.Scientific Issues
A.Trial Conduct
1.Trial Design
Except for pilot or estimation trials, clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -driven to assess safety, 
efficacy, and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic indices of M SD or comparator products. 
Alternatively, M SDmay conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint 
measures, or trials to determine patient preferences, e tc.
The design (ie, participant population, duration, statistical power) must be adequate to address the specific
purpose of the trial. P articipants must meet protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial. 
2.Site Selection
MSD selects investigative sites based on medical expertise, access to appropriate participants, adequacy of 
facilities and staff, previous performance in clinical trials, as well as budgetary considerations. Prior to trial 
initiation, sites are evaluated by M SD personnel to assess the ability to successfully conduct the trial.
3.Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity
Investigative trial sites are monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol and general principles of 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP). MSD reviews clinical data for accuracy, completeness, and consistency. Data 
are verified versus source documentation according to standard operating procedures. Per M SD policies and 
procedures, if fraud, scientific/research misc onduct, or serious GCP -noncompliance is suspected, the issues 
086YCG
PRODUCT: MK-7339 147
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-06
MK-7339 -010-06FINAL PROTOCOL 02-MAY -2022
areinvestigated. When necessary, the clinical site will be closed, the responsible regulatory authorities and 
ethics review committees notified .
B. Publication and Authorship
Regardless of trial outcome, MSD commits to publi sh primary and secondary results of its registered trials of 
marketed products in which treatment is assigned, according to the prespecified plans for data analysis. To the 
extent scientifically appropriate, M SDseeks to publish the results of other analyses it conducts that are important 
to patients, physicians, and payers. Some early phase or pilot trials are intended to be hypothesis -generating rather 
than hypothesis testing , in such cases, publication of results may not be appropriate since the trial ma y be 
underpowered and the analyses complicated by statistical issues such as multiplicity.
MSD’s policy on authorship is consistent with the re commendations published by the International Committee of 
Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). In summary, authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and 
conduct of the trial, performance or interpretation of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript. All named 
authors must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. M SD funding of a t rial will be acknowledged in 
publications.
III.Participant Protection
A. Ethics Committee Review (Institutiona lReview Board [ IRB]/Independent Ethics Committee [ IEC])
All clinical trials will be reviewed and approved by an IRB/IEC before being initiated at each site. Significant 
changes or revisions to the protocol will be approved by the ethics committee prior to implementation, except 
changes required urgently to protect participant safety that may be enacted in anticipation of ethics committee 
approval. For each site, the ethics committee and M SDwill approve the participant informed consent form.
B. Safety
The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical tria ls is that participant welfare is of primary importance. 
Potential participants will be informed of the risks and benefits of, as well as alternatives to, trial participation. At 
a minimum, trial designs will take into account the local stand ard of care.
All participation in M SD clinical trials is voluntary. Participants enter the trial only after informed consent is 
obtained . Participants may withdraw from a n MSD trial at any time, without any influence on their access to, or 
receipt of, medical care that may otherwise be available to them.
C. Confidentiality
MSD is committed to safeguarding participant confidentiality, to the greatest extent possible. Unless required by 
law, only the investigator, Sponsor (or representative), ethics committee, and/or regul atory authorities will have 
access to confidential medical records t hat might identify the participant by name.
D. Genomic Research
Genomic research will only be conducted in accordance with a protocol and informed consent authorized by an 
ethics c ommittee .
IV. Financial Considerations
A. Payments to Investigators
Clinical trials are time -and labor -intensive. It is M SD’s policy to compensate investigators (or the sponsoring 
institution) in a fair manner for the work performed in support of M SD trials. M SD does not pay incentives to 
enroll participants in its trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challenging, additional payments may be 
made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts.
MSD does not pay for participant referrals. Ho wever, M SDmay compensate referring physicians for time spent 
on chart review to identify potentially eligible participants.

PRODUCT: MK-7339 148
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-06
MK-7339 -010-06FINAL PROTOCOL 02-MAY -2022
B.Clinical Research Funding
Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by M SDand that the investigator or sponsoring 
institution is being paid or provided a grant for performing the trial. However, the local ethics committee may 
wish to alter the wording of the disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution. As 
noted above, all publications resulting from M SD trials will indicate M SD as a source of funding.
C. Funding for Travel and Other Requests
Funding of travel by investigators and support staff (eg, to scientific meetings, investigator meeti ngs, etc.) will be 
consistent with local guidelines and practices .
V. Investigator Commitment
Investigators will be expected to review M SD’s Code of Conduct as an appendix to the trial protocol, and in signing the 
protocol, agree to support these et hical a nd scientific standards.
10.1.2 Financial Disclosure
Financial Disclosure requirements are outlined in the US Food and Drug Administration 
Regulations, Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators (21 CFR Part 54). It is the 
Sponsor's responsibility to determine, based on these regulations, whether a request for 
Financial Disclosure information is required. It is the investigator's/subinvestigator's 
responsibility to comply with any such request.
The investigator/subinvestigator(s) agree, if requested by the Sponsor in accordance with 21 
CFR Part 54, to provide his/her financial interests in and/or arrangements with the Sponsor to 
allow for the submission of complete and accurate certification and disclosure statements. 
The investigator/subinvestigator(s) furt her agree to provide this information on a 
Certification/Disclosure Form, commonly known as a financial disclosure form, provided by 
the Sponsor. The investigator/subinvestigator(s) also consent to the transmission of this 
information to the Sponsor in the United States for these purposes. This may involve the 
transmission of information to countries that do not have laws protecting personal data.
10.1.3 Data Protection
Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by the Sponsor. Any participant records or 
datasets that are transferred to the Sponsor will contain the identifier only; participant names 
or any information that would make the participant identifiable will not be transferred.
The participant must be informed that his/her personal study -related dat a will be used by the 
Sponsor in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be 
explained to the participant. 
The participant must be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by Clinical 
Quality Assurance audi tors or other authori zed personnel appointed by the S ponsor, by 
appropriate IRB/IEC members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities.

10.3 Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
10.3.1 Definition of AE
AE definition
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the 
study intervention.
NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or dis ease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a study intervention.
NOTE: For purposes of AE definition, study intervention (also referred to as Sponsor’s 
product) includes any pharmaceutical product, biological product, vaccine, diagnost ic 
agent, or protocol specified procedure whether investigational or marketed (including 
placebo, active comparator product, or run -in intervention) , manufactured by, licensed 
by, provided by, or distributed by the Sponsor for human use in this study.
Eventsmeeting the AE definition
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical 
and scientific judgment of the investigator.
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnos ed after study intervention administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication.
For all reports of overdose (whether accidental or intentional) with an associated AE, the 
AE term should reflect the clinical symptoms or abnormal test result. An overdose 
without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results is reported using 
the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”
Events NOT meeting the AE d efinition
Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
086YCG
PRODUCT: MK-7339 156
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-06
MK-7339 -010-06FINAL PROTOCOL 02-MAY -2022
Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present o r 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
Surgery planned prior to informed consent to treat a pre -existing condition that has not 
worsened.
Refe r to Section 8.4.6 for protocol -specific exceptions.
10.3.2 Definition of SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met.
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
1.Results in death
2.Is life -threatening
The term “ life-threatening ”in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.
3.Requires inpatient hospitalizati on or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay, even 
if the hospitalization is a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: 
Hospitalization for an elective proc edure to treat a pre -existing condition that has not 
worsened is not an SAE. A pre -existing condition is a clinical condition that is 
diagnosed prior to the use of an MSD product and is documented in the participant’s 
medical history.
4.Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncompl icated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) that may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
5.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
In offspring of participant taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-06
MK-7339 -010-06FINAL PROTOCOL 02-MAY -2022
6.Other important medical events
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 
of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usu ally be 
considered serious.
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.
10.3.3 Additional Events Reported in the Same Manner as SAE
Additional events that require reporting in the same manner as SAE
In addition to the above criteria, AEs meeting either of the below criteria, although not 
serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the Sponsor in the same time frame as SAEs to 
meet certain local requirements. Therefore, these events are considered serious by the 
Sponsor for collection purposes.
Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study)
Is associated with an overdose
10.3.4 Recording AE and SAE
AE and SAE r ecording
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to 
the event.
The investigator will record all relevant AE/SAE information on the AE 
CRFs /worksheets at each examination.
It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical 
records to the Sponsor in lieu of completion of the AE CRF page.
There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by 
the Sponsor. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant 
number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records before submission to the 
Sponsor.

PRODUCT: MK-7339 158
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-06
MK-7339 -010-06FINAL PROTOCOL 02-MAY -2022
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Assessment of i ntensity /toxicity
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, not when it is rated as severe.
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE (and other 
reportable safety event) according to the NC I CTCAE , version 4.0. Any AE that changes 
CTCAE grade over the course of a given episode will have each change of grade 
recorded on the AE CRFs /worksheets.
-Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.
-Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental ADL.
-Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitaliz ation indicated; disabling; limiting self -
care ADL.
-Grade 4: Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated .
-Grade 5: Death related to AE.
Assessment of c ausality
Did the Sponsor ’s product cause the AE?
The determination of the likelihood tha t the Sponsor’ s product caused the AE will be 
provided by an investigator who is a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated 
initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE 
form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed 
document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are 
intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a 
relationship be tween the test product and the AE based upon the available information.
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the 
Sponsor ’s product and the AE; the greater the correlation with the components and 
their respective elemen ts (in number and/or intensity), the more likely the Sponsor ’s 
product caused the AE:
-Exposure: Is there evidence that the participant was actually exposed to the 
Sponsor ’s product such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (pill 
086YCG

MK-7339 -010-06FINAL PROTOCOL 02-MAY -2022
count, di ary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite 
in bodily specimen?
-Time Course: Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the Sponsor ’s product? Is the time of onset of the AE compatible 
with a drug-induced effect (applies to studies with investigational medicinal product)?
-Likely Cause: Is the AE not reasonably explained by another etiology such as 
underlying disease, other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental factors.
-Dechallenge :Was the Sponsor ’s product discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency 
reduced?
◦If yes, did the AE resolve or improve?
◦If yes, this is a positive dechallenge.
◦If no, this is a negative dechallenge.
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or permanent 
disability; (2) the AE resolved/improved despite continuation of the Sponsor ’s 
product; (3) the study is a single -dose drug study; or (4) Sponsor ’s product(s) is/are 
only used 1 time.)
-Rechallenge: Was the participant re -expo sed to the Sponsor ’s product in this study?
◦If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?
◦If yes, this is a positive rechallenge.
◦If no, this is a negative rechallenge.
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or 
permanent disability, or (2) the study is a single -dose drug study; or (3) Sponsor’ s 
product(s) is/are used only 1 time.)
NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN AE THAT WAS SERIOUS AND 
MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE SPONSOR ’S PRODUCT, OR IF RE -EXPOSURE 
TO THE SPONSOR ’S PRODUCT POSES ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT 
RISK TO THE PARTICIPANT THEN THE RECHALLENGE MUST BE APPROVED IN 
ADVANCE BY THE SPONSOR CLINICAL DIRECTOR AS PER DOSE 
MODIFICATION GUIDELINES IN THE PROTOCOL, AND IF REQUIRED, THE 
INIRB/IEC .
Consi stency with study intervention profile: Is the clinical/pathological presentation of 
the AE consistent with previous knowledge regarding the Sponsor ’s product or drug class 
pharmacology or toxicology?

PRODUCT: MK-7339 160
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-06
MK-7339 -010-06FINAL PROTOCOL 02-MAY -2022
The assessment of relationship will be reported on the case report forms/worksheets by 
an investigator who is a qualified physician according to his/her best clinical judgment, 
including consideration of the above elements.
Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteria must be present to be
indicative of a Sponsor ’s product relationship).
-Yes, there is a reasonable possibility of Sponsor ’s product relationship:
◦There is evidence of exposure to the Sponsor ’s product. The temporal sequence of 
the AE onset relative to the administration of the Sponsor ’s product is reasonable. 
The AE is more likely explained by the Sponsor ’s product than by another cause.
-No, there is not a reasonable possibility of Sponsor's product relationship:
◦Participant did not receive the Sponsor ’s product OR temporal sequ ence of the AE 
onset relative to administration of the Sponsor ’s product is not reasonable OR the 
AE is more likely explained by another cause than the Sponsor’s product. (Also 
entered for a participant with overdose without an associated AE.)
For each AE/ SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, it is very important 
that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor.
The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up 
information and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.
The causality assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.
For studies in which multiple agents are administered as part of a combination regimen, 
the investigator may attribute each AE causality to the combination regimen or to a single 
agent of the combination. In general, causality attribution should be assigned to the 
combination regimen (ie, to all agents in the regimen). However, causality attribution 
may be assigned to a single agent if in the investigator’s opinion, there is sufficient data 
to support full attribution of the AE to the single agent.
Follow -up of AE and SAE
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by Sponsor to 
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.

MK-7339 -010-06FINAL PROTOCOL 02-MAY -2022
New or updated information will be recorded in the CRF.
The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.
10.3.5 Reporting of AE s, SAE s, and Other Reportable Safety Events to the Sponsor
AE, SAE, and o ther reportable safety event reporting to Sponsor via electronic d ata 
collection t ool
The primary mechanism for reporting to the Sponsor will be the electronic data collection 
(EDC) tool.
Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry guidelines (or 
equivalent).
If the electronic system is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use 
the paper AE Re porting form.
Reference Section 8.4.1 for reporting time requirements.
The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available.
After the study is completed at a given site, the EDC tool will be taken off -line to prevent
the entry of new data or changes to existing data.
If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data 
on a previously reported SAE after the EDC tool has been taken off -line, then the site can 
report this information on a paper SAE form or by telephone (see next section).
Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator Study File Binder (or 
equivalent).
SAE reporting to the Sponsor via paper CRF
If the EDC tool is not operational, facsimile transmission o r secure e -mail of the SAE 
paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this information to the Sponsor.
In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by 
telephone is acceptable with a copy of the SAE data collection tool s ent by overnight 
mail or courier service.
Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to 
complete and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time frames.
Contacts and instructions for SAE reporting and paper reporting procedures can be found 
in the Investigator Study File Binder (or equivalent).

10.6 Appendix 6: Collection and Management of Specimens for Future Biomedical 
Research
1.Definitions
a.Biomarker: A biol ogical molecule found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that is
a sign of a normal or abnormal process or of a condition or disease. A biomarker may
be used to see how well the body responds to a treatment for a disease or condition .1
b.Pharmacogenomi cs: The investigation of variations of DNA and RNA characteristics 
as related to drug/vaccine response.2
c.Pharmacogenetics: A subset of pharmacogenomics, pharmacogenetics is the influence 
of variations in DNA sequence on drug/vaccine response.2
d.DNA: Deoxyri bonucleic acid.
e.RNA: Ribonucleic acid.
2.Scope of Future Biomedical Research
The specimens consented and/or collected in this study as outlined in Section 8.8 will be 
used in various experiments to understand:
◦The biology of how drugs/vaccines work
◦Biomarkers responsible for how a drug/vaccine enters and is removed by the body
◦Other pathways drugs/vaccines may interact with
◦The biology of disease
The specimen(s) may be used for future assay development and/or drug/vaccine 
development.
It is now well recognized that information obtained from studying and testing clinical 
specimens offers unique opportunities to enhance our understanding of how individua ls 
respond to drugs/vaccines, enhance our understanding of human disease and ultimately 
improve public health through development of novel treatments targeted to populations 
with the greatest need. All specimens will be used by the Sponsor or those working for or 
with the Sponsor.
3. Summary of Procedures for Future Biomedical Research.
a.Participants for Enrollment
All participants enrolled in the clinical study will be considered for enrollment in the 
future biomedical research 
086YCG
PRODUCT: MK-7339 165
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-06
MK-7339 -010-06FINAL PROTOCOL 02-MAY -2022
b.Informed Consent
Informed conse nt for specimens (ie, DNA, RNA, protein, etc.) will be obtained 
during screening for protocol enrollment from all participants or legal guardians, at a 
study visit by the investigator or his or her d esignate. Informed consent for future 
biomedical r esearch should be presented to the participants on the visit designated in 
the SoA. If delayed, present consent at next possible Participant Visit. Consent forms 
signed by the participant will be kept at the clinical study site under secure storage for 
regulatory reasons.
A template of each study site’s approved informed consent will be stored in the 
Sponsor’s clinical document repository.
c.eCRF Documentation for Future Biomedical Research Specimens
Documentat ion of participant consent for future biomedical r esearc h will be captured 
in the eCRFs . Any specimens for which such an informed consent cannot be verified 
will be destroyed.
d.Future Biomedical Research Specimen(s)
Collection of specimens for future biomedical r esearch will be performed as outlined 
in the SoA. In general, if additional blood specimens ar e being collected for future 
biomedical r esearch, these will usually be obtained at a time when the participant is 
having blood drawn for other study purposes.
4.Confidential Participant Information for Future Biom edical Research
In order to optimize the resea rch that can be conducted with future biomedical r esearch 
specimens, it is critical to link participant' clinical information with future test results. In 
fact little or no research can be conducted without connecting the clinical study data to 
the specimen. The clinical data allow specific analyses to be conducted. Knowing 
participant characteristics like gender, ag e, medical history and intervention outcomes are 
critical to understanding clinical context of analytical results.
To maintain privacy of information collected from specimens obtained for future 
biomedical r esearch, the Sponsor has developed secure policies and procedures. All 
specimens will be single -coded per ICH E15 guidelines as described below.
At the clinical study site, unique codes will be placed on the future biomedical r esearch 
specimens. This code is a random number which does not contain any personally 
identifying information embedded within it. The link (or key) between participant 
identif iers and this unique code will be held at the study site. No personal identifiers will 
appear on the specimen tube.

MK-7339 -010-06FINAL PROTOCOL 02-MAY -2022
5.Biorepository Specimen Usage
Specimens obtained for the Sponsor will be used for analyses using good scientific 
practices. Analyses utilizing the future biomedical r esearch specimens may be performed 
by the Sponsor, or an additional third party (eg, a university investigator) designated by 
the Sponsor. The investigator conducting the analysis will follow the Sponsor’s privacy 
and confidentiali ty requirements. Any contracted third- party analyses will conform to the 
specific scope of analysis outlined in the FBR. FBR specimens remaining with the third 
party after specific analysis is performed will be reported to the Sponsor .
6.Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Research
Participants may withdraw their consent for future biomedical r esearch and ask that thei r 
biospecimens not be used for future biomedical r esearch. Participants may withdraw 
consent at any time by contacting the principal investig ator for the main study. If medical 
records for the main study are still available, the investigator will contact the Sponsor 
using the designated mailbox (clinical.specimen.management@MSD .com). 
Subsequently, the participant's specimens will be flagged in the biorepository and 
restricted to main study use only. If specimens were collected from study participants 
specifically for future biomedical r esearch, these specimens will be removed from the 
biorepository and destroyed. Documentation will be sent to th e investigator confirming 
withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the investigator to 
inform the participant of completion of the withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. 
Any analyses in progress at the time of reques t for withdrawal/destruction or already 
performed prior to the request being received by the Sponsor will continue to be used as 
part of the overall research study data and results. No new analyses would be generated 
after the request is received.
In the e vent that the medical records for the main study are no longer available (eg, if the 
investigator is no longer required by regulatory authorities to retain the main study 
records) or the specimens have been completely anonymized, there will no longer be a 
link between the participant’s personal information and their specimens. In this situation, 
the request for withdrawal of consent and/or destruction cannot be processed.
7.Retention of Specimens
Future biomedical r esearch specimens will be stored in the biorepository for potential 
analysis for up to 20 years from the end of the main study. Specimens may be stored for 
longer if a regulatory or governmental authority has active questions that are being 
answered. In this special circumstance, specimens will be s tored until these questions 
have been adequately addressed.
Specimens from the study site will be shipped to a central laboratory and then shipped to 
the Sponsor -designated biorepository. If a central laboratory is not utilized in a particular 
study, the study site will ship directly to the Sponsor -designated biorepository. The 
specimens will be stored under strict supervision in a limited access facility which 
operates to assure the integrity of the specimens. Specimens will be destroyed according

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-06
MK-7339 -010-06FINAL PROTOCOL 02-MAY -2022
to Sponsor policies and procedures and this destruction will be documented in the 
biorepository database.
8.Data Security
Databases containing specimen information and test results are accessible only to the 
authorized Sponsor representatives and the designated stud y administrator research 
personnel and/or collaborators. Database user authentication is highly secure, and is 
accomplished using network security policies and practices based on international 
standards to protect against unauthorized access.
9.Reporting of Future Biomedical Research Data to Participants
No information obtained from exploratory laboratory studies will be reported to the 
participant, family, or physicians. Principle reasons not to inform or return results to the 
participant include: Lack of relevance to participant health, limitations of predictive 
capability, and concerns regarding misinterpretation.
If important research findings are discovered, the Sponsor may publish results, present 
results in national meetings, and make results accessible on a public website in order to 
rapidly report this information to doctors and participants. Participants will not be 
identified by name in any published reports about this study or in any other scientific 
publication or presentation.
10.Future Biomedical Re search Study Population
Every effort will be made to recruit all participants diagnosed and treated o n Sponsor 
clinical studies for f uture biomedical r esearch.
11.Risks Versus Benefits of Future Biomedical Research
For future biomedical research, risks to the participant have been mini mized and are 
described in the future biomedical r esearch informed consent.
The Sponsor has developed strict security, policies, and procedures to address participant 
data privacy concerns. Data privacy risks are largely limited to rare situations involving 
possible breach of confidentiality. In this highly unlikely situation, there is risk that the 
information, like all medical information, may be misused.
12.Questions
Any questions related to the future biomedical research should b e emailed directly to

10.8 Appendix 8: Description of the Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG) 
Process for Assessment of Bone Lesions
The rules for evaluation of response and progression based on bone lesions were created by 
the Prostate Cancer Working Group and publ ished as part of both PCWG2 and PCWG3 
[Scher, H. I., et al 2016] . All bone lesions are evaluated according to these rules, including 
assessment at screening/baseline and evaluation of response.
10.8.1 Imaging Methods
The PCWG rules were designed based on radionuclide (99mTc) bone scintigraphy. Other 
modalities, including fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( FDG -PET), 
sodium fluoride PET, bone MRI, etc. may have individual advantages, but the PCWG rules 
were not created with the performance characteristics of these methods in mind, and these 
methods should not be used instead of radionuclide bone scan. 
Only bone lesions seen by bone scan may be followed for assessment of tumor treatment 
response. Bone disease seen by CT only (not visible on bone scan) is presumed not to 
represent active disease and should not be documented as a bone lesion (sclerotic lesions 
seen on CT may represent healed disease or nonmalignant confounders such as bone infarcts 
or other beni gn findings).
10.8.2 Documentation of Bone Lesions at Baseline
At baseline, individual bone lesions may be recorded as non target lesions only, and the 
number of bone lesions should be noted.
10.8.3 Assessment of Bone Response at Subsequent Imaging Time Points
At all follow -up time points, bone disease will be classified as PD (progressive disease), P Du 
(progressive disease unconfirmed), Non -PD (no progressive disease), NED (no e vidence of 
disease), or NE ( nonevaluable). The definitions are su mmarized in the following table and 
described in more detail below.
Bone Response Definition
PDProgressive disease: 
2 new lesions, not flare, persistent
PDuProgressive disease unconfirmed: 
Temporary marker of possible PD, to be updated to PD or non -PD once a subsequent 
scan is available. 
If this is the final visit, the visit response will remain P Du
Non-PDNonprogressive disease: 
At least 1 bone lesion present, but not enough to trigger P D
NENonevaluable: 
Status of bone lesions cannot be determined (scan quality, scan missing, etc.)
NEDNo evidence of disease: 
No lesions seen on bone scan

10.8.4 Descriptions of Bone Response Categories
No Evidence of Disease
No lesions seen on bone scan at this visit. Either none were seen at baseline, or all 
completely resolved on subsequent imaging.
Nonprogression (Non -PD)
At least 1 bone lesion is pr esent on the scan at this visit but the conditions for progression 
have not been met, be cause there are not at least 2 new lesions present.
Unconfirmed Progressive Disease (P Du)
At least 2 new bone lesions are present, but an additional scan is required for confirmation. 
This response c ategory is meant as a placeholder that reflects temporary uncertainty and is 
updated to PD or non -PD once a subsequent bone scan is available.
Progressive Disease (PD)
At least 2 new bone lesions are present, which have been confirmed to not represent flar e or 
any other confounder (see below), and which are persistent for at least 6 weeks. The new 
bone lesions do not all have to appear at the same time. Thus , if 1 new lesion appears at visit 
N, and another new lesion at visit N+1, visit N+1 is considered to represent progressive 
disease.
Confirmation of Progression
Radiographic progression of bone lesions is defined as the appearance of ≥2 new bone 
lesions on radionuclide bone scan. When ≥2 new bone lesions are first observed this is 
classif ied as PDu , which marks the possibility of progression that will be resolved by the next 
scan.
New Lesions Within the Flare Window (<12 Weeks)
After a scan classified as P Du within the first 12 weeks of treatment, if the next bone scan 
outside the flare window shows at lea st 2 additional new bone lesions in addition to the new
lesions seen on the prior scan , the initial progression is considered confirmed, and the bone 
scan response is updated to PD. Because this requires at least 2 new lesions followed by 
another 2 new les ions, this is known as the “2+2 rule”.
If the next bone scan outside the flare w indow does not show at least 2 additional new bone 
lesions, the lesions seen on the prior scan within the flare window are considered to be 
pre-existing lesions that became mor e visible because of the tumor flare phenomenon.
The bone response at the prior visit is updated to non- PD.
086YCG
PRODUCT: MK-7339 172
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-06
MK-7339 -010-06FINAL PROTOCOL 02-MAY -2022
The bone lesions seen within the flare window are ignored for the purposes of counting 
new lesions at later time points, since they were not new. This may be called
“rebaselining”.
New Lesions Outside the Flare Window (>12 Weeks)
After a scan classified as PDu after the first 12 weeks of treatment, if at least 2 of the new 
lesions seen on that scan persist on the next bone scan performed at least 6 weeks later, this 
confirms the initial progression. The prior response is then updated to PD. If the new lesio ns 
have disappeared on this later scan, the prior response is updated to non -PD because these 
lesions are presumed to be nonmalignant in nature. No re baselining of lesions will occur in 
this scenario.
10.8.5 Superscan
A “superscan” occurs when there is diffuse skeletal involvement by tumor, such that 
individual bone lesions are not distinguishable. The bone sc an may initially appear normal 
because the increase dbone uptake may be uniform, but can be distinguished by the faint or 
absent activity in the kidneys and urinary tract.
If there is a true superscan at baseline, identifying individual new bone lesions and 
determining progression based on bone lesions may be impossible. 
If a superscan occurs after baseline, the bone response will be recorded as PD. No subseq uent 
imaging will be required for confirmation, because a superscan is extremely unlikely to be 
caused by benign conditions or tumor flare.
10.8.6 Management After Confirmed PD
If repeat imaging does confirm PD, participants will be discontinued from study intervention.
Note: If a participant has confirmed radiograph ic progression as defined above but is 
achieving a clinically meaningful benefit, an exception to continue study intervention may be 
considered after consultation with the Sponsor. In this case, if study intervention is 
continued, tumor imaging should continue (See Section 8.2).

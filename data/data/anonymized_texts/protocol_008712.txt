STUDY  INDICATION:  CHRONIC PAINFUL  DIABETIC  PERIPHERAL  NEUROPATHY  
 
The study indication to be evaluated in this study is the temporary relief of chronic foot pain 
arising  from diabetic  peripheral neuropathy.  
STATISTICS 
 
Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common chronic diseases and a leading cause of adult  
disability in the U.S. Of the over 100 known types of neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy represents  
over a third of all neuropathies, making diabetes the leading cause of peripheral neuropathy. Due to the increasing prevalence of diabetes, there are now about 15 -18 million Americans with  
diabetic  peripheral neuropathy,  about  60% to 70% of the 25.8 million  adults  and children in the 
U.S. with diabetes. U.S. ( Source: The Neuropathy Association). In addition, there are 79 million 
individuals in the U.S. with pre -diabetes who are at risk for developing diabetic peripheral  
neuropathy  (Source:  The Center  for Disease Control ). 
 
Living with neuropathy can cause tremendous frustration and social isolation for patients. The daily chronic pain impacts day -to-day functionality resulting in physical and psychological  
problems  including impaired concentration,  anxiety,  depression,  a decline  in cognitive abilities,  
and sleep difficulties  which  in turn can lead to irritability  and increased pain sensitivity. 
Additionally,  the economic  burden  from medical  costs and workplace  productivity  losses  are high 
and on the rise as the incidence of peripheral neuropathy increases. Neuropathic pain patients  
are often high health care system users as they seek relief from persistent suffering. Those 
debilitated by neuropathy or coping with chronic pain are challenged with working full -time, and 
may become  unemployable or  stay under -employed.  
DESCRIPTION & DEFINITION  
 
Peripheral neuropathy describes damage to the peripheral nervous system, the vast  
communications network that transmits information from the brain and spinal cord (central  
nervous  system) to every  other  part of the body.  Peripheral  nerves  also send  sensory  information  
back to the brain and spinal cord, such as a message that the feet are cold or a finger is burned.  
Damage to the peripheral nervous system interferes with these vital connections, distorting and 
sometimes  interrupting  messages  between the brain and the rest of the body.  
 
 Classification  of the Peripheral  Neuropathies 
 
More than 100 types of peripheral neuropathy have been identified, each with its own 
characteristic set of symptoms, pattern of development and prognosis. Specific impaired function and symptoms  depend on the type of nerves  - motor,  sensory,  or autonomic - that are damaged:  
 
• Motor nerves control movements of all muscles under conscious control, such as those used 
for walking, grasping things,  or talking  
• Sensory  nerves  transmit  information about  sensory  experiences,  such as the feeling of a light 
touch  or the pain resulting  from a cut. 
• Autonomic nerves regulate biological activities that people do not control consciously, such as  
breathing,  digesting food,  and heart  and gland  functions.  
Erchonia®  FX-635™  Diabetic  Peripheral  Neuropathy  Pain Clinical  Study  Protocol  
Version  1.1 Page  5 January  12, 2016   
  
 
 Forms  of Neuropathy 
 
• Mononeuropathies : Neuropathies  that involve  damage to only one nerve.  
• Polyneuropathies : Neuropathies  that involve  multiple  nerves  affecting  all limbs. 
• Mononeuritis multiplex : Less commonly, neuropathies wherein two or more isolated nerves  
in separate areas  of the body  are affected  
 
Some  neuropathies  affect  all three  types  of nerves,  but most  often,  neuropathies  primarily  affect  
one or two types. Therefore, neuropathies may be further described as predominantly motor  
neuropathy, predominantly sensory neuropathy, sensory -motor neuropathy, or autonomic  
neuropathy.  
 
 Acute  versus  Chronic  Neuropathies 
 
In acute neuropathies , such as Guillain -Barre syndrome, symptoms appear suddenly, progress  
rapidly,  and resolve  slowly  as damaged  nerves heal.  
 
In chronic neuropathies , symptoms begin subtly and progress slowly. There may be periods of  
relief followed by relapse. A plateau stage may be reached where symptoms stay the same for  
months or years. Some chronic neuropathies worsen over time, but fatality from neuropathy is  
extremely  rare unless  complicated by other  diseases.  Occasionally,  neuropathy  is a symptom  of 
another  disorder.  
 
 Acquired peripheral  neuropathies 
 
Peripheral  neuropathy  may be either  acquired or inherited.  
 
 Acquired vs. inherited peripheral  neuropathies 
 
• Acquired peripheral  neuropathies  are grouped  into three broad  categories;  those  caused  by: 
 systemic disease  
 trauma  from external  agents  
 infections  or autoimmune  disorders  affecting nerve tissue 
 
Causes  of acquired  peripheral  neuropathy  include:  
 physical  injury  (trauma) to a nerve  
 tumors  
 toxins  
 autoimmune responses  
 nutritional  deficiencies  
 alcoholism  
 vascular  and metabolic  disorders  
 
• Inherited forms of peripheral neuropathy are caused by inborn mistakes in the genetic code 
or by new genetic mutations. Depending on the genetic error/mutation, inherited peripheral  
neuropathies can range from those with symptoms that begin in early adulthood and are 
minimal to more severe forms and symptoms/impairments that may begin in infancy or  
childhood. The most common inherited neuropathies are a group of disorders collectively  
referred  to as Charcot -Marie -Tooth disease  that result  from flaws  in genes  responsible for 
Erchonia®  FX-635™  Diabetic  Peripheral  Neuropathy  Pain Clinical  Study  Protocol

manufacturing neurons  or the myelin  sheath  and are characterized by extreme  weakening  
and wasting of muscles in the lower legs and feet, gait abnormalities, loss of tendon 
reflexes, and numbness  in the lower  limbs. 
 
 Diabetic  Peripheral  Neuropathy 
 
Diabetic  peripheral  neuropathy  is a chronic  acquired form of  nerve damage that can occur  in 
individuals with diabetes. High blood sugar can injure nerve fibers throughout the body, but  
diabetic  neuropathy  most often damages  nerves in the legs and feet. 
 
ETIOLOGY  
 
The primary cause of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is damage to nerve fibers and blood vessels  
from prolonged exposure to high blood sugar (glucose). While the precise mechanism for this  
damage remains unclear, a combination of factors likely plays a role, including the complex  
interaction between nerves and blood vessels. High blood glucose interferes with the ability of the nerves to transmit signals and weakens the walls of the small blood vessels (capillaries) that  
supply  the nerves with oxygen and nutrients.  
 
Other  factors  that may contribute  to diabetic  neuropathy  include:  
 
• Inflammation in the nerves  caused by an autoimmune response that occurs  when the immune  
system mistakenly  attacks  part of the body  as if it were a  foreign organism.  
• Genetic  factors  unrelated  to diabetes  that make  some people more  susceptible to nerve 
damage.  
• Smoking and alcohol abuse which damage both nerves and blood vessels and significantly  
increase the risk of infections.  
 
Risk factors  
Anyone with diabetes can develop neuropathy, but the following factors increase the risk of  
susceptibility  to nerve damage:  
 
• Poor blood sugar control is the greatest risk factor for every complication of diabetes, including nerve  damage.
 
• Duration of diabetes . The risk of diabetic neuropathy increases with increasing duration of  
diabetes, especially if there is also poo control of blood sugar. Peripheral neuropathy is most  
common  in people  who have had  diabetes  for at least  25 years.  
• Kidney disease. Diabetes can cause damage to the kidneys, which may increase the toxins in the blood and contribute  to nerve  damage.
 
• Smoking narrows  and hardens  the arteries,  reducing blood flow to the legs and feet, making  it 
more  difficult  for wounds  to heal and damages  the integrity  of the peripheral  nerves.

PRESENTATION AND SYMPTOMS  
 
 Early,  primary  symptoms  of diabetic  peripheral  neuropathy  may include: 
 
• tingling,  prickling, buzzing,  pinching or burning feeling  in the feet 
• pins and needles  in the feet 
• sharp,  jabbing,  stabbing pains  
• cramps  in the legs and feet 
• cold sensation  
• numbness  or reduced ability  to feel pain or changes  in temperature,  especially  in the feet 
and toes  
 
Symptoms  often  worsen  at night.  
 
 Progressive  symptoms  of diabetic  peripheral  neuropathy  may include: 
 
• Touch sensitivity: heightened and/or extreme sensitivity to touch such as the weight of a 
sheet  or clothes  being  painful,  or heightened tingling or numbness  in the toes,  feet, legs,  or 
hands  
• Muscle weakness : difficulty walking or getting up from a chair, grabbing things or carrying 
things  with the hands as  a result  of muscle weakness  from nerve damage  
• Balance problems: increased unsteadiness and incoordination when walking, occurring as  
the body  adapts  to changes  brought  on by muscle  damage  
• Serious  foot problems:  such  as ulcers,  infections,  deformities,  and bone  and joint pain  
 
 Complications : Diabetic neuropathy can cause a number of serious complications. Among the  
most  serious  are the following  two complications:  
 
• Loss of a limb: As nerve damage can cause lack of feeling in the feet, cuts and sores can 
go unnoticed and eventually become severely infected or ulcerated. The risk of infection is  
high because diabetes reduces blood flow to the feet. Infections that spread to the bone 
and cause tissue death (gangrene) may be impossible to treat and require amputation of a 
toe, foot or even the lower leg. More than half the non- traumatic lower limb amputations  
performed  every  year in the United States  are due to diabetes.  
• Charcot joint: This occurs when a joint, usually in the foot, deteriorates because of nerve  
damage. Charcot joint is marked by loss of sensation, as well as swelling, instability and  
sometimes  deformity  in the joint  itself.  
• Neuropathic pain is difficult to control and can seriously affect emotional well -being and  
overall  quality  of life.  Neuropathic  pain is often worse  at night,  seriously  disrupting sleep 
and adding to  the emotional  burden of  sensory  nerve damage.  
 
DIAGNOSIS  
 
Patients  being e valuated  for diabetic  peripheral  neuropathy  will have already  been clinically  
diagnosed with diabetes and/or be evaluated for and diagnosed with diabetes prior to the  
evaluation for diabetic  peripheral neuropathy. 
 
Diabetic neuropathy is diagnosed by a qualified physician based on a thorough evaluation of the 
patient's symptoms, medical history and a physical exam that includes assessment of blood pressure, heart rate, muscle strength and tone, tendon reflexes, and s ensitivity to touch, position 
changes,  temperature  and vibration.  
Erchonia®  FX-635™  Diabetic  Peripheral  Neuropathy  Pain Clinical  Study  Protocol  
Version  1.1 Page  8 January  12, 2016   
  
 
A comprehensive foot exam assessing the skin, muscles, bones, circulation, and sensation of the  
feet is also performed  as part of the diagnostic  process. 
 
Specific  tests  that may be conducted  as part of the diagnostic  process  include:  
 
• Filament test. Sensitivity to touch may be tested using a soft nylon monofilament or via pin  
prick. The inability to feel the filament on the foot or the pin prick is a sign that sensation in  
those  nerves  has been  lost or diminished.  
• Tuning fork. A tuning fork is used for quantitative  sensory  testing to assess vibration and 
temperature  change perception.  
• Nerve conduction studies or electromyography are sometimes used to help determine the type  
and extent of nerve damage. Nerve conduction studies check the transmission of electrical  
current through a nerve. Electromyography evaluates how well muscles respond to electrical  
signals  transmitted by nearby  nerves.  These tests  are rarely  needed  to diagnose neuropathy.  
 
CURRENT THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES TO THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC PAINFUL  
DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY 
 
Nerve  pain from diabetic  peripheral  neuropathy  can be severe,  constant,  and difficult  to treat.  As 
diabetic neuropathy is a many -faceted complication of diabetes, it is often best managed 
symptomatically with an array of drugs and/or treatments. In addition to optimal management of  
blood glucose levels (including a regimen of diet, exercise and medication), the following 
medications and therapies, and combinations therein, are used to assist in the management of  
painful  diabetic  peripheral neuropathy  symptoms: 
 
(i) Over -the-counter  (OTC) pain relief  options:  
• OTC NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil,  
Motrin),  and naproxen  (Aleve)  reduce inflammation  and relieve  pain.  A downside of NSAIDs  
is the potential for harmful side effects such as stomach irritation and bleeding, or even kidney and liver damage, with prolonged use, which may be more likely in people with 
diabetes.  
• Acetaminophen medications relieve diabetes nerve pain without reducing inflammation and  
do not cause the stomach irritation of NSAIDs, but there is a risk of liver damage with 
excessive use. 
• Capsaicin is found naturally in chili peppers or in drug stores under various brand names,  
including Capzasin- P and Zostrix. Capsaicin is believed to ease pain by reducing a chemical  
called substance P, which is involved in transmitting pain signals through the nerves.  
Effective on a short -term basis, there are concerns about long- term consequences such as  
prevention  wound  healing, which  is most  serious  in patients  with diabetes.  
• Lidocaine is an OTC  and/or  prescription gel or cream  anesthetic  that numbs  the area of 
application. Some  product  names  include Topicaine and Xylocaine.  
• Other topical creams such as salicylate, a chemical similar to aspirin found in pain- relieving  
creams like Aspercreme and Bengay; cortisone creams containing corticosteroids, potent  
anti-inflammatory drugs that can help relieve pain. However, there is no clear evidence that  
either helps  relieve nerve  pain from peripheral  neuropathy.  
Erchonia®  FX-635™  Diabetic  Peripheral  Neuropathy  Pain Clinical  Study  Protocol  
Version  1.1 Page  9 January  12, 2016   
  
 
(ii) Prescription pain relief  options:  
• Prescription NSAIDs such as Celebrex, Lodine, and Relafen. As with the OTC NSAIDs,  
people with diabetes are at greater risk of kidney damage that can occur with prescription 
NSAIDs, and at greater risk of heart disease which may also be elevated with prescription 
NSAID  use. 
• Antidepressants , such as: 
 Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) that primarily affect the levels of the brain chemicals  
norepinephrine and serotonin, such as Elavil, Pamelor and Norpramin. Side effects vary  
between the three, but can include drowsiness, weight gain, dry mouth, and dry eyes.  
For people with peripheral neuropathy, there may be additional side effects such as the 
development  of blood pressure,  heart  rate problems and  dizziness.  
 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) that work by altering the amount of the 
brain chemical  serotonin,  but these  are the least  effective  for pain management.  
 Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) , such as Effexor and 
Cymbalta, affect the levels of the brain chemicals serotonin and norepinephrine. They 
are quite effective for pain relief with fewer side effects than the SSRIs or TCAs.  
Cymbalta  is FDA -approved for painful  neuropathy.  
• Antiseizure drugs that prevent epileptic seizures can also relieve neuropathic pain by  
controlling the abnormal  firing of  nerve  cells. These drugs  include:  
 Neurontin is most  commonly  used for nerve  pain from peripheral  neuropathy.  Side 
effects include  causing sedation or dizziness at higher doses.  
 Lyrica is FDA -approved for painful neuropathy. The most common side effects are 
dizziness and sleepiness.  
• Opioid medicines such as Ultram and Ultracet, are strong pain killers for when pain is very  
severe and immediate relief is needed. Ultram and Ultracet are FDA- approved painkillers  
that contain tramadol, a weak opioid (morphine- like) substance. The drug also weakly  
affects  the brain  chemicals  serotonin and norepinephrine,  similar  to antidepressants,  which  
reduces  the perception of  pain.  
• Tramadol is often used as a back -up for "breakthrough pain" - pain that suddenly, for no  
apparent reason, is worse. Tramadol is a good replacement for over -the-counter  
medications  at those times.  However, strong narcotic  opioid medications  can cause severe  
constipation  and have the  potential  for addiction.  
 
(iii) Additional  and Alternative Treatment  Options:  
• Injections of local anesthetics such as lidocaine - or patches containing lidocaine - can be 
used to numb the painful  area for severe,  intractable diabetes  nerve pain.  
• Surgical  destruction of nerves  or to relieve  a nerve compression  that causes  pain.  
• Implantation of a device that relieves  pain.  
• Transcutaneous electrotherapy and percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation are 
alternative therapies that provide electrical nerve stimulation wherein small amounts of  
electricity  are used  to block pain signals  as they pass  through the skin.  
• Hand or foot braces to compensate for muscle weakness or to help relieve nerve  
compression.  
• Orthopedic  shoes  to improve gait (walking)  problems  to will prevent  foot injuries.

THEORY OF MECHANISM OF OPERATION OF THE APPLICATION OF LOW LEVEL 
LASER  THERAPY  TO REDUCING  PAIN 
 
"Low -energy photon irradiation by low level laser light lasers or LED arrays has been found to 
modulate various biological processes in cell culture and animal models. This mechanism of  
photobiomodulation by LLLT lasers or LED arrays at the cellular level has been ascribed to the 
activation of mitochondrial respiratory chain components, resulting in initiation of a signaling 
cascade that promotes cellular  proliferation and cytoprotection."  
Source:  Proc Natl Acad  Sci U S A. 2003 Mar18;  100(6):  3439- 44. 2003 Mar 07. 
 
When applied to injuries  and lesions,  low level laser  light has been  shown  to stimulate healing  and 
to reduce pain by accelerating the speed, quality and strength of tissue repair and the reduction of  
inflammation. Furthermore, laser therapy has been found to be particularly effective over other  
standard therapies in relieving pain and other symptoms associated with injuries as it impacts the complete system of targeted muscles, tendons, ligaments, connective tissue, bone, nerve, and dermal  tissues. 
 
Lasers can strengthen damaged cells. Using photochemical processes, laser light inserts bio- photons into damaged cells. The cells begin to produce energy (ATP), which improves their  
function,  assists their division,  strengthens  the body's  immune  system, a nd causes  the secretion  
of various hormones. The tissues are healed, and pain diminishes. If damaged cells have died,  
the bio- photons help the division of neighboring cells, generating new tissues, and thus bring 
about  healing.  
 
Therefore,  LLLT  promotes  healing,  regeneration  and pain reduction through  the following  
mechanisms:  
 
1) increased cell membrane  polarization and permeability  
2) increased ATP production and respiratory  chain  activity  
3) increased enzyme activity  
4) increased collagen and epithelial  production 
5) increased capillary  formation 
6) increased macrophage (immune) activity  
7) analgesic  effects  due to elevated endorphin production,  electrolytic  nerve blockage,  and 
improved  blood and lymph flow 
8) anti-inflammatory  effect due to improved circulation and accelerated tissue regeneration;  and 9) 
increased production of  antioxidants.  
 
Of additional benefit is that light energy from low level lasers will only be absorbed by those cells  
and tissues that are not functioning normally and that need it. Soft laser light has no effect on healthy  cells. 
 
The progressive process by which low level laser light aids in the production of ATP, consequently  
providing cells with more energy which in turn optimizes the cells' condition to play their part in a natural  healing and pain reduction process,  is as follows:  
Erchonia®  FX-635™  Diabetic  Peripheral  Neuropathy  Pain Clinical  Study  Protocol  
Version  1.1 Page  11 January  12, 2016   
  
 
 
The effects of low level laser light are photo -chemical (not thermal),

Considering the general mechanism of operation of LLLT as explained above, it follows that LLLT 
provides  relief  from the foot pain from chronic  diabetic  peripheral  neuropathy  by: 
 
• penetrating the skin of the foot and the ligaments and tendons to increase the production of  
ATP and activate enzymes in the targeted cells of the tissue to promote healing of the tendons  
and ligaments  
• cultivating a growth factor response within the cells and tissue of the foot as a result of the 
increased ATP production to promote  new,  healthier  cell and tissue growth  to strengthen  and 
support ligaments and tendons, to restore mechanical and sensory function, and to protect  
against  further  damage  
• The anti -inflammatory properties of low level lasers reduce nerve irritation and inflammation in  
the foot to provide pain relief

STUDY  RATIONALE  & JUSTIFICATION 
The chronic pain of diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be debilitating, impacting the individual's  
day-to-day functionality that further leads to physical, cognitive, psychological, sleep and social  
impairments. Additionally, diabetic neuropathic pain patients are typically burdensome to the 
health care system, frequently seeking relief from the persistent pain. Many afflicted also suffer  
economically, as coping with the chronic pain of the condition may render them unemployable or  
under -employed.  
Current therapeutic approaches for managing the chronic pain of diabetic peripheral neuropathy  
are primarily over -the-counter and prescription medications. However, in addition to their general  
limited effectiveness, many have harmful side effects with prolonged use such as stomach irritation and bleeding, kidney and liver damage, prevention of wound healing, elevated blood 
pressure and heart rate problems which can be both more likely to occur and more likely to pose 
serious implications for individuals with diabetes. Additional potential side effects include 
dizziness, drowsiness, weight gain, dry mouth, and dry eyes, as well as the potential for addiction 
with certain prescription  medications.  Non-medication alternatives  are also of limited  effectiveness  
and most, including injections of local anesthetics, surgical destruction of nerves, device 
implantation and t ranscutaneous electrotherapy and percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation are 
costly, invasive  and carry  their owns  set of potentially  harmful  and lasing  side effects.  
Low level laser light therapy, such as that provided through application of the Erchonia® FX - 
635™ Laser as proposed in this study protocol, offers a simple, quick, non -invasive, safe,  
effective and side- effect free option to reduce diabetic peripheral neuropathy pain. Prior trials with 
Erchonia low level lasers have demonstrated their efficacy in reducing chronic pain in various  
clinically diagnosed chronic pain conditions, and in post -surgical pain, in a clinically meaningful 
and statistically significant  manner, as is the treatment goal being evaluated in the current clinical  
study.  
Specific Justification for the assertion of anticipated safety and effectiveness of the Erchonia® FX - 
635™ for application to reducing chronic pain arising from diabetic peripheral neuropathy is found 
through the following FDA clearances for Erchonia® low level laser devices for chronic pain 
Erchonia®  FX-635™  Diabetic  Peripheral  Neuropathy  Pain Clinical  Study  Protocol  
Version  1.1 Page  13 January  12, 2016   
 reduction and post -surgical pain reduction indications, each device of whose technical  
specifications and outputs are comparable to those of the Erchonia® FX -635™ as presented in 
the current  clinical study  protocol:  
 
 
For all of the respective 510(k) clearances, the assigned Product Code is NHN, defined as  
follows:  
 Device: Powered Light Based Non- Laser Non -Thermal Instrument Wi th Non -Heating Effect  
For Adjunctive Use In Pain Therapy  
 Regulation Description:  Infrared lamp  
 Definition: A light based non- laser device that emits energy in infrared or other wavelengths, 
provides non -heating and non- thermal effect, and is indicated for adjunctive use in pain 
therapy or related indication. It does not provide therapeutic topical heating. The classification 
regulation for infrared lamps describes a device that emits energy in the infrared wavelength 
to provide  topical  heating  and that is not limited  to adjunctive use.  
 Device  Class : 2 
 
The above- referenced 510(k)  clearances  are the following:  
 K132940 : Erchonia® Allay™: is indicated as an adjunct to reducing chronic heel pain arising 
from plantar  fasciitis. 
 
 K050672: Erchonia EVRL Laser : is generally indicated while using the red diode, for  
adjunctive use in providing temporary  relief of  minor  chronic  neck  and shoulder  pain of 
musculoskeletal  origin. 
 
 K072206: Erchonia EML Laser : is indicated for the temporary reduction in post -surgery pain at  
24 hours  after surgery  following  bilateral  breast  augmentation surgery. 
 
 K041139: Erchonia EML Laser : is indicated as an  adjunct to liposuction procedures of the 
thighs, hips  and stomach for reduction of pain associated with the recovery  process. 
 
Therefore,  Erchonia® low level lasers of comparable configuration, technical specification and  
application as proposed in this current clinical study protocol have been determined to be safe and effective by the FDA for various pain reduction indications, including an indication for  
reducing chronic heel pain arising from plantar fasciitis, such that evaluation of application of the  
Erchonia® low level laser to reducing chronic diabetic peripheral neuropathy foot pain is a natural  
extension of its proven  and accepted application  for chronic  pain reduction  purposes.

Dosage calculations for the Erchonia®  FX-635™  
 
Equations : 
1) Intensity  = W/cm2  
2) Dosage = (J/cm2)=(W/cm2) x r(s) 
3) Oval Surface area =  n x (r1/2)  x (r2/2)  
MW = miliwatts  
W= Watts  
 
Intensity:  
Intensity  .. oval  surface  area = intensity  at tissue 
1) 17.5 mW / 1000  = 0.0175  W (Intensity  conversion from mW to W) 
2) n x (9cm/2) x (9.5cm/2) = 21.375 cm2 (surface area of treated region at single diode at 3.5"  
above the skin surface.  
3) 0.0175 / 21.375  cm2 = 8.2 x10-4 W/cm2  (intensity  for single  diode at skin)  
4) 8.2 x 10- 4 W/cm2 x (3 diodes) = 2.46 x10- 3 W/cm2 (intensity for all 3 diodes combined at the  
skin) 
 
Dosage delivered to the skin: 
Intensity  x r(s) = dosage  at specific  area 
1) 2.46 x 10-3 W/cm2  x (900 seconds)  = .0865  J/cm2  (total  dosage delivered  to the skin)

STUDY  DESIGN  
This clinical study is a double- blind, placebo- controlled randomized parallel group design multi - 
site evaluation of the effect of the Erchonia® FX -635™ on providing relief of chronic foot pain 
arising  from diabetic peripheral neuropathy.  
 
SUBJECT  GROUPS  
Each  subject  will be randomized to the test procedure group  or to the placebo procedure group,  
as follows:  
Test procedure group: Subjects randomized to the test procedure group will receive the study  
procedures  with the active  (true)  Erchonia® FX -635™  laser.  
Control procedure group: Subjects randomized to the control procedure group will receive the 
study  procedures with a 'fake'  (placebo)  Erchonia® FX -635™  laser.  
The 'fake' (placebo) laser device will appear to the subject to be an active device, but will not  
produce any therapeutic light output. The placebo laser device is designed to have the same 
physical appearance as the actual (active test) laser device, including the appearance of any  
visible light output. Therefore, both the test and control devices emit light when activated that is  
indistinguishable to the subject. As the laser light does not put out any notable degree of heat or  
noise,  these are not distinguishing factors  for subjects  between the active and control  devices.  
Apart from the distinction of whether or not the subject receives the study procedures with the actual or the fake laser device, all subjects and investigative parties will adhere to all phases of  
the entire protocol  design.  
DOUBLE  BLIND DESIGN 
This clinic al study will be a double- blind design, such that neither the subject nor the investigator  
will be aware of whether a subject is receiving the study procedures with the active (test  
procedure group assignment) or the 'fake' (placebo procedure group assignment) Erchonia® FX - 
635™ until after  the study  is completed  . 
Maintenance of study double- blind throughout the entire course of the study will be achieved 
through  the following  means:  
1) Each  subject  will be randomly  assigned to Procedure Group A or to Procedure Group  B by the 
independent study Monitor. Subjects assigned to Procedure Group A will be treated with the 
Erchonia® FX -635™ A and subjects assigned to Procedure Group B will be treated with 
Erchonia® FX -635™ B. Only the study Sponsor will know which label ('A' or 'B') corresponds  
to the actual (test) FX- 635™ device and which label corresponds to the 'fake' device until the  
final study data analysis is complete. The Sponsor will ensure that this information is stored 
and maintained confidentially at the Sponsor's work site. This knowledge will not be shared 
with the investigators, the subjects, or the study Monitor until the final data analysis is  
complete.  
2) The fake (placebo) Erchonia® FX -635™ is designed to have the same physical appearance 
as the actual Erchonia® FX -635™, including the appearance of any visible light output, with 
the placebo device employing a 635 nm LED rather than a 635 nm laser diode in the active 
device. Therefore, both the test and sham devices emit light when activated that i s 
indistinguishable to both the subject  and to the investigator.  As the laser  light does  not put out 
Erchonia®  FX-635™  Diabetic  Peripheral  Neuropathy  Pain Clinical  Study  Protocol  
Version  1.1 Page  27 January  12, 2016   
  
 
any notable degree  of heat  or noise,  these  are not distinguishing factors  for subjects  between 
the two groups.  
 
3) There will be two independent investigators interacting with subjects: (i) administration  
investigator : who will be responsible for administrating the study treatments; (ii) assessment  
investigator : who will be responsible for recording the study outcome m easures. Only the  
administration investigator will be aware of whether a subject is assigned to Procedure Group 
A or B, although he or she will not  be made aware of whether  A or B corresponds  to the true 
or fake laser.  Neither  the assessment investigator  nor the subject  will be aware  of the 
subject's A/B Group assignment. In this way, the assessment investigator will not be able to form an association between A/B Procedure Group and active/sham device over the course of  
the study  if a treatmen t effect is observed.  
 
4) During  the laser  procedures,  both the subject  and the administration  investigator  will wear  
safety  glasses  that filter out the laser  light spectrum.  
 
RANDOMIZATION  
 
Subject  allocation to procedure group  will be via variable block  randomization with varying  block  
sizes of two, four and six used at random to minimize the likelihood of predicting the next  
procedure group  assignment.  In addition,  randomization  will be stratified  by test site. 
Randomization will be attained using computer generation sequence methodology, insuring that  
the randomization methodology and the generated allocation sequence is concealed from the 
investigator  and subjects.  
Concealment  will be insured as follows:  
(ii) Each computer generated randomization sequence is unique and will therefore not be able to be replicated.  
(iii) Randomization will occur to either 'Procedure Group A' or to 'Procedure Group B' rather than to a test or placebo group, and only the study Sponsor will know which assignment (A or B)  
corresponds to the active device and which corresponds to the fake device. The Sponsor will  
not reveal this information to any source (investigators, subjects, or study Monitor) until the final study  data analysis  is compl ete. 
Once  a subject  has qualified for and been  enrolled in the study,  the Principal Investigator  will 
contact the study Monitor who will act as the central source for providing sequential subject  
procedure  group  assignment.  
 
SUBJECTS  
Subject  Sample  
Subjects will be males and females aged 18 years or older who have diagnosed diabetic  
peripheral neuropathy  with pain persisting over at least  the past three  months.  
 
Sample size 
There will be 64 qualified  subjects  enrolled in this clinical study:  
• 32 subjects  in the active procedure group  
• 32 subjects  in the control  procedure  group

Rationale for sample  size 
Based on the following parameters established for the purposes of assessing efficacy of the 
Erchonia®  FX-635™  in this clinical study  .: 
 Individual subject success criteria is defined as a 30% or greater reduction in self -reported 
Degree of Pain rating  on the 0- 100 VAS from baseline to study  endpoint  evaluation.  
 
N.B.: The clinical relevance of a 30% change in VAS score is explained and supported in the 
STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS PLAN section further along  in this protocol  document.  
 
 Overall study success criteria of at least a 35% difference between the test device group and 
the placebo  group,  comparing  the proportion  of individual  successes in each  group.  
 It is anticipated that about  55% of subjects  in the test device group and about  20% of subjects  
in the placebo group will meet  the individual  success criteria,  and 
 intended application of a two-tailed  test with an alpha value of 0.05 and Power  of 0.8 
 .the samp le size of 29 subjects per group (test gr oup and the control gr oup, separ ately) has 
been determined using the following reference calculator: Hypothesis Testing: Categorical  
Data - Estimation of Sample Size and Power for Comparing Two Binomial Proportions in  
Bernard Rosner's  Fundamentals  of Biostatistics. 
For the purposes of sample size calculation, it is anticipated that about one- twentieth of subjects  
overall may withdraw from the study prior to completion for various reasons. Therefore, the  
following  formula  is used  to determine the final needed starting sample  size for each  group:  
Final sample size = sample size X 1/(1 -d); where d = # expected dropouts/# subjects enrolled.  
Final  sample size =  29 X 1/(1 -0.083)  
Final sample size = 29 X 1/0.917 = 29 X 1.0905 = 31.62, rounded to 32 subjects per procedure 
group.  
 
Therefore, a minimum starting sample size of 32 subjects in each group is needed to insure that a sufficient number re mains at the end of the trial (29 subjects per group) for any significant  
differences found between groups to be considered statistically valid and representative of the general population being sampled. This results in a total of 64 subjects being enrolled in this study  
across  both study  procedure groups.

STUDY  PROCEDURE  
STUDY  TEST  BATTERY  
The following is a list of the study outcome assessment tools that will be used in this clinical study.  
For each  study  phase,  the precise tools  from this list that  will be employed will be specified.  
 
BASELINE  FOOT  VARIABLES:  The following  is recorded at baseline evaluation:  
(i) Duration of Pain: years/months  since foot pain began 
(ii) Number  of Months/Years  Since  Diabetes  Diagnosis  
(iii) Insulin  Dependency : Insulin  dependent  diabetes  or non-insulin  dependent  diabetes  
 
BASELINE CONCOMITANT MEDICATION AND THERAPY USE: The following is recorded at  
baseline evaluation:  
 
(i) Over -the-counter and prescription medications currently used, and therapies currently  
engaged in by the subject  for any non-pain relief  indication,  including dosages  and frequency  
of use. 
(ii) Over -the-counter and prescription medications that have been used specifically to relieve the 
subject's diabetic peripheral neuropathy  foot pain.  
(iii) Non-drug treatments/therapies (conventional, alternative and experimental) that have been  
used specifically  to relieve  the subject's  diabetic  peripheral  neuropathy  foot pain.  
 
SUBJECT  DEMOGRAPHICS:  The subject's  age, gender  and ethnicity  are recorded.  
 
VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS) DEGREE OF PAIN RATING: Subjects will be asked to rate the  
overall degree of pain experienced in the target foot region on the following 0- 100 mm (0 - 10 cm)  
Visual  Analog Pain Scale,  by responding to the following  question:  
 
"Using the scale below, please mark with a cross (X) the spot along the 0 to 100 line below that  
best shows how much pain you feel in your feet  right now. '0' means you feel no pain at all and 
'100' means you  feel the worst  pain imaginable.  Please mark  only one spot."  
 
no pain worst  pain imaginable 
The Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) is one of the three most commonly used scales for 
assessing chronic pain. It is a simple scale that consists of a line anchored at one end by a label  
such as "NO PAIN" and at the other end "WORST POSSIBLE PAIN". The subject marks on the 
line the spot  for the pain intensity,  which is then  measured.  
Standard  guidelines  for effective  use of the VAS that are followed  in this clinical study  are: 
i. The line should  be 10, 15 or 20cm  long,  as other  lengths  are less reliable.  
ii. There should be a small vertical  mark  at each end, with numbers 0 and 100, and a verbal  
description.  
iii. The verbal  description must  be in absolute  terms  (e.g. worst  pain imaginable);  
iv. The line itself should be clear  of any markings  and should be horizontal  rather  than vertical, 
for more  reliable measurements.  
Used in the above way, it has been shown that the VAS is a proper ratio scale. Like a 
thermometer,  this means  that its two ends  are rooted,  and a doubling  of the  score does  accurately

reflect a doubling of the pain. Consequently, sensitive t -tests and ANOVA methods can be used in 
the analysis, so that significant differences can be identified with relatively small sample sizes or  
small differences  between groups.

The subject is instructed to refrain from consuming any pain relief medication within 4 hours of  
recording a required VAS Degree of Pain Rating to ensure that the effect of the pain relief  
medication does not influence any potential treatment effect of the study procedure with the 
Erchonia® FX -635™ as evidenced through the VAS ratings. The subject may take a dosage of  
his or her study  rescue  pain relief  medication  immediately  after recording a VAS rating,  if needed.  
NEUROPATHIC PAIN  SYMPTOM  INVENTORY  (NPSI) : The NPSI  was developed in 2004  by 
Bouhassira Didier to evaluate the different symptoms of neuropathic pain in adults. It is a 12 -item 
self-administered patient -reported outcome (PRO) assessment tool with a recall/ observation 
period of over the past 24 hours. It contains 10 descriptors representing 5 distinct dimensions on 
the basis of factor analysis: burning pain, deep pain, paroxysmal  pain, evoked pain,  
paresthesia/dysesthesia, and 2 temporal items designed to assess pain duration and the number  
of pain paroxysms. The NPSI has been validated in patients with definite neuropathic pain of  
peripheral or central  origin. 
 
The development  and validation  of the NPSI  is contained in the abstract  below:

SUBJECT DAILY DIARY : Commencing upon administration of the first Erchonia® FX -635™  
laser procedure to the foot through to completion of the 4 -week post -procedure evaluation phase,  
the subject will be required to complete a Subject Daily Diary at home with the following 
information,  as applicable:  
 Rescue Pain Medication Use: The subject will record each time a dose of the study rescue pain medication is  taken as needed to manage knee pain.  
 Confirmation of Abstinence from Other Pain Medication Use: The subject will confirm at t he 
end of each day that he or she refrained from consuming any OTC and/or prescription medication(s) for the indication of pain relief other than the study pain relief rescue medication during that day 
 'Other' Medication Use: The subject will record at the  end of each day any medication(s) he or  
she consumed that day that was different  from that reported  during Baseline evaluation.  
 Adverse Events  recording,  as applicable.  
 Additional comments , as desired 
 
SUBJECT SATISFACTION WITH FOOT PAIN LEVEL: The subject is asked to rate how satisfied 
he or she is with the level of foot pain experienced at the relevant evaluation points following 
completion of the laser administration procedures with the Erchonia® FX -635™, by using the 5- 
point Likert scale presented below to respond to the following question: "Overall, how satisfied or  
dissatisfied are you with any change in the pain in your feet following the study procedures with the study  laser  device?"  
• Very Satisfi ed 
• Somewhat  Satisfied  
• Neither  Satisfied  nor Dissatisfied  
• Not Very Satisfied  
• Not at All Satisfied  
SUBJECT PERCEIVED GROUP ALLOCATION AND RATIONALE: The subject records whether  
he or she believes to have received the study procedures with the true or fake Erchonia® FX - 
635™  and records  verbatim  his or her reasoning or rationale for this perceived  determination.  
 
ASSESSMENT  INVESTIGATOR  PERCEIVED GROUP  ALLOCATION  AND RATIONALE:  The 
Assessment Investigator records whether he or she believes the subject to have received the study procedures with the true or fake Erchonia® FX- 635™ and records verbatim his or her  
reasoning or rationale for this perceived determination.  
 
RESCUE  PAIN  MEDICATION  USE:  As subjects in  this study  are those that  present  with a 
chronic pain level of 50 or greater on the 0 to 100 VAS pain scale, it is unethical to require 
subjects in this clinical study to refrain from consuming any and all medication(s) indic ated for the 
relief of pain, particularly for subjects assigned to the placebo group. Therefore, this clinical study  
will incorporate the use of rescue pain medication, to be taken as needed throughout the subject's  
participation  in the clinical study.  
The rescue medication to be used in this study will be over -the-counter Regular Strength 
Tylenol®  tablets.  Subjects  will be instructed to take a dosage of Tylenol  as needed to control  any 
foot pain he or she may be experiencing,  ensuring  that the directions  for use are followed.  
 
Subjects will be instructed to record each time a dosage of the pain medication is taken during the 
study  procedure  administration  and evaluation  phase in the Subject  Daily  Diary. 
Erchonia®  FX-635™  Diabetic  Peripheral  Neuropathy  Pain Clinical  Study  Protocol  
Version  1.1 Page  34 January  12, 2016   
  
 
Subjects will be instructed not to take a dose of any other over -the-counter or prescription 
medications for the indication of pain relief, including NSAIDs, over the course of study  
participation.  
 
Subjects will be instructed not to record a VAS pain rating (whenever indicated) any sooner than 
six hours after they have consumed a dosage of the study pain relief rescue medication. This is to  
ensure that the effect of the pain relief medication does not influence the effect of the study  
procedures with the Erchonia® FX -635™ Laser device. That is, a VAS rating is only to be 
recorded once the effect of any previously -consumed rescue pain medication has dissipated. The 
subject will be able to take another dosage of the study pain relief rescue medication immediately  
after recording the VAS rating, if  needed.  
Throughout the course of his or her study participation, a subject can continue to take any other  
over-the-counter and/or prescription medication(s) that he or she usually takes for any other (non - 
pain relief) indication(s), as he or she usually takes them, as reported at Baseline evaluation and approved by the study investigator. Subjects will be required to record any deviations from  
Baseline reported medication use  throughout  the course  of study  participation.

ADVERSE  EVENTS  
 
At each evaluation and measurement point throughout the clinical study, and at any other time 
throughout the duration of the clinical trial that is necessary, any and all potential adverse events  
reported by a subject or observed by an investigator  will be recorded on the case report form, and 
subsequently evaluated by the investigator for its relation to the study procedure and whether or  
not any corrective action needs to be taken. All potential adverse events recorded will be 
appropriately  reported  to the governing IRB,  as applicable.  
 
It is unlikely and not expected that any adverse events will result from implementation of this  
clinical study protocol. Prior clinical trials using low level laser light have not typically yielded any  
adverse events or reactions. However, potential adverse events that may feasibly occur from  
application of the Erchonia® FX -635™ include, but are not necessarily limited to: skin irritation,  
discoloring,  rash,  indentations  and infection.  
 
PRIVACY  AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
 
Records  for each subject  in this clinical study  will be maintained  in separate files in a locked  filing 
cabinet at the test site. The investigator at the test site will be responsible for ensuring that all  
records for a subject pertaining to his or her participation in the clinical study are stored in that  
subject's  file at all times  other  than when informat ion is being recorded  on them.  
 
Regulatory Insight, Inc., the study Monitor, will have access to the files for the purposes of data 
monitoring and auditing. Once the study is complete, copies of all of the subject case report forms  
will be made and supplied to Regulatory Insight, Inc. for analysis of results. Regulatory Insight,  
Inc. will maintain these copies in a separate clinical study file that is kept in a locked filing cabinet  
on their premises. The original records will be maintained at the respective test sites upon  
completion  of the study  in their original  files and stored  in a locked filing cabinet.  
 
Subjects' identities will be kept confidential by assigning each subject a subject ID upon acceptance into the study. The subject ID will comprise the  investigator's two initials (first and last  
name initials) and a three- digit number that will be based upon the subject's order of entry into the 
clinical study. Each test site will be assigned a unique range of numbers. Test site #1 will be assigned numbers  001 to 100. Test site #2 will be assigned numbers  101 to 200. For example,  
the eighth subject to be enrolled at test site #2 with Principal Investigator John Black would have a subject ID of JB108. Neither the study Sponsor nor Regulatory Insight, Inc. will receive any  
additional identifying information about a subject  and will therefore  have no way of linking a  
subject  ID to  a particular  subject  and his or her results. 
 
MONITORING OF THE CLINICAL  STUDY  
 
The study Monitor will assure that each test site and each investigator is executing the protocol  
exactly  as outlined and intended.  This includes  insuring  that a signed informed consent  form has 
been attained from each subject prior to commencing the protocol, and that all study evaluations  
are recorded using the specified methods and correctly and fully recorded on the appropriate  
clinical case report forms. All investigators will be trained by the same study Monitor to this end,  
including insuring that the investigator understands how to watch for, to evaluate and to handle,  
the occurrence  or potential  occurrence of  an adver se event.

STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS  
 
PRIMARY  EFFICACY  OUTCOME  MEASURE:  CHANGE  IN SUBJECT  SELF -REPORTED  VAS 
PAIN  RATING  FROM  BASELINE TO STUDY ENDPOINT  
Primary efficacy outcome measure for this clinical study will be a statistically significant difference  
in the proportion of subjects between test and control groups who achieve a clinically meaningful  
and statistically significant decrease in self -reported VAS pain rating from baseline to study  
endpoint.  
 
The primary efficacy outcome evaluation will be performed on the blinded data attained from  
subjects who were initially enrolled in either the test or placebo procedure group, and will not  
include active procedure test data attained from placebo subjects who partook in the post -study  
open- label  procedure  administration  period after blinding was broken.  
 
Subjects  meeting Individual  Success Criteria  
The individual subject success criteria is defined as a 30%  or greater decrease in self -reported 
VAS pain rating at study  endpoint  relative  to baseline.  
 
Overall  Study  Success  Criteria.  
Overall study success criteria is defined as at least a 35% difference between procedure groups,  
comparing the proportion of individual successes in each group. It is anticipated that about 55% of  
subjects in the test group will meet the individual success  criteria and about 20% of subjects in the 
control  group will meet  the individual success criteria.  
 
The clinical relevance of a 30% change in VAS score has been well previously established by  
FDA's Division of Surgical, Orthopedic and Restorative Devices through numerous pre -IDE 
reviews, the results of said studies that were subsequently used to successfully support various  
pain- reduction related indications for various Erchonia Corporation light therapy devices under  
Product  Code NHN for the 510(k)s  listed below  over the past 8 years:  
 
1. K101430;  06/22/10:  "The MLS-AC DermaScanner™  is indicated,  while  using the red diodes,  
for adjunctive use in providing temporary relief of minor chronic neck and shoulder pain of  
musculoskeletal  origin."  
 
2. K100509;  06/08/10:  "The Erchonia THL1 is indicated for use in providing temporary  relief of  
minor chronic neck  and shoulder pain of musculoskeletal origin."  
 
3. K072206; 04/24/08: "The Erchonia EML Laser is indicated for the temporary reduction in post - 
surgery  pain at 24 hours  after surgery  following  breast  augmentation surgery."  
 
4. K050672;  06/02/05:  "The Erchonia  EVRL  Laser  is generally  indicated while  using the red diode 
for adjunctive use in providing temporary relief of minor chronic neck and shoulder pain of  
musculoskeletal  origin."  
 
5. K041139; 09/30/04: "The Erchonia EML Laser is indicated as an adjunct to liposuction procedures  of the thighs,  hips and stomach  for reduction of pain associated with the recovery  
process."

STATISTICAL  METHODS  
Efficacy analysis will be according to the intent to treat  (ITT) principle by last observation carried 
forward  (LOCF).  
Intent to Treat : Subjects will be included in the analysis if they were randomized to study  
procedure group, had a valid baseline visit including the required Low Back Pain VAS recordings;  
and received the first study procedure administration.  
Erchonia®  FX-635™  Diabetic  Peripheral  Neuropathy  Pain Clinical  Study  Protocol  
Version  1.1 Page  49 January  12, 2016   
  
 
Last observation carried forward : Missing data will be handled by carrying forward the last  
observation.  
Per-protocol analysis will also be performed for the set of all subjects who were randomized to 
procedure  group  and completed  the study  according to  the full  protocol.  
 
STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS 
The primary  analysis  of efficacy will be through the application of: 
1) Fisher's exact test to compare the proportion of success between the test and the control  
groups, considering that randomization has been diligently conducted and important  
covariates  between the two groups  are well balanced.  
2) Parametric ANCOVA model analysis with the mean change from baseline to study endpoint  
in foot pain ratings on the VAS as the dependent variable, procedure group as the 
independent variable of interest and baseline average foot pain VAS rating as a covariate. A  
two-tailed  signific ance  level of 5% will be considered to be statistically  significant. 
 
Covariates:  The following potential covariate baseline variables will be adjusted, as applicable,  
through application of an ANCOVA analysis for the continuous variables and linear regres sion 
analysis for  categorical variables.  
 Baseline VAS rating  
 Baseline NPSI  total score 
 Duration of foot pain 
 Time  since Diabetes  diagnosis  
 Insulin  dependent  versus  non-insulin  dependent  Diabetes  
 Age 
 Gender  
 Ethnicity  
Secondary  Measures  Analysis  
 The secondary measures that are continuous variables will be analyzed through parametric  
analysis using ANCOVA. A two -way significance level of 5% will be considered to be 
statistically  significant. 
 The secondary measures that are categorical will be evaluated through linear regression 
analysis. 
Satisfaction with Study Outcome Ratings: will be tabulated according to category and reported as  
percentages. Satisfaction levels will be correlated with subject individual study success and recorded changes  in foot pain VAS ratings  from Baseline to post-procedure evaluations.  
 
BLINDING EFFICACY  EVALUATION  
Statistical  evaluation of blinding  efficacy  will be performed as follows: 
(i) The percentage of subjects who correctly perceived their procedure group allocation and the  
percentage of subjects who did not correctly perceive their procedure group allocation will be calculated.  
(ii) The percentage of times the assessment investigator correctly perceived subjects' procedure group allocation and the percentage of times the assessment investigator did not correctly  
perceive subjects' procedure group allocation  will be calculated.  
Erchonia®  FX-635™  Diabetic  Peripheral  Neuropathy  Pain Clinical  Study  Protocol  
Version  1.1 Page  50 January  12, 2016   
  
 
(iii) The Fischer's Exact categorical analysis technique for comparison of proportion of successes  
(accurate procedure group allocation determination) between actual active and placebo 
subject  groups will be performed.  
 
It is anticipated that the results of the Fischer's Exact analysis will not be statistically significant;  
that is, it is anticipated that both subjects assigned to the active procedure group and subjects  
assigned to the placebo procedure group will demonstrate a high percentage of accuracy of group allocation determination if the study treatment proves efficacious. Similarly, it is anticipated that  
assessment investigators will demonstrate a high percentage of accuracy of group allocation 
determination for both subjects assigned to the active procedure group and subjects assigned to 
the placebo procedure group, if the study treatment proves efficacious. Therefore, it should be noted that lack of  a statistically significant Fischer's Exact analysis result will be considered an  
indicator of study blinding efficacy, providing additional support to study outcome efficacy,  
particularly  if appropriately  supported by the reasoning statements,  as explained below.  
 
Positive blinding efficacy will be supported by comments provided to support perceived group allocation that pertain to the determination being made based on treatment efficacy or lack  
thereof; e.g.: 'My foot pain is much less than it used to be, so I believe I got the real treatment' or  
'My foot pain hasn't  really  changed,  so I believe I got  the fake treatment.'  
 
Blinding will be determined to have failed if comments provided to support perceived group 
allocation pertain to factors such as sensation/visual  clues (e.g. I saw/didn't see a light go on the 
laser, etc.) or other factors that pertain to blinding having been compromised such as 'I overheard the doctor  saying I  wasn't  getting the  real treatment.' 
 
SAFETY  ANALYSES  
Safety analyses will be based on all subjects who were randomized to test or placebo procedure 
group.  Safety  will be assessed by evaluating  and comparing  frequency  and incidence of observed 
and/or reported adverse events between test and placebo procedure groups related to  
administration of the Erchonia® FX- 635™ laser procedures. A chi- square test with a continuity  
correction will be performed to compare the percentage of subjects who experienced adverse events between test  and placebo procedure  group  subjects.  
 
INDIVIDUAL  SITE  ANALYSIS 
 
Analysis of results will be performed by individual test site and pooled across test sites.  
Application of a balanced test -control group study design incorporating a varied block by test site 
randomization procedure will contribute to statistical justification of pooling data across the 
different  test sites.

  Subject ID:  ________________ PURPOSE OF THE STUDY 
In this study, the Sponsor, Erchonia Corporation, and investigators are studying the use of a 
device called the Erchonia® FX-635™  that gives off low level laser light. This study is to see if 
using the Erchonia® FX-635™  can help to reduce foot pain in people with diabetic peripheral 
neuropathy. The Erchonia® FX-635™  is cleared for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) as an adjunct to reducing chronic heel pain arising from plantar fasciitis. 
However its use in this study is investigational, as the FX- 635™ has not been cleared for market 
by the FDA for reducing foot pain in individuals with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. 
 
PROCEDURES 
Ø If you agree to take part in this study, you will be one of about 64 people taking part. 
Ø This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. This means that if you choose 
to take part in this study, it will be determined by chance (like the flip of a coin) whether you 
will get the active study treatment or the placebo study treatment. In this study, there will be 
two groups of participants. Participants in one of the groups will get active study treatments. 
The other group of participants will get placebo treatments. This means the study treatments 
will be ‘fake’, as if the Erchonia® FX-635™  laser device were turned off. 
 
Since there are two different groups, you have: 
 
Ø About a 50% chance of receiving active study treatments. 
Ø About a 50% chance of receiving a placebo treatment (no laser therapy). 
 
Neither the active nor the placebo device make any noise or produce any heat, and both will 
have a light that you can see, so neither you nor the study investigators will be able to guess 
which group you are in. 
 
To take part in this study, you must agree to not take any medicines or try any other treatments 
to help with your foot pain, until your part in the study is over. You may take over-the-counter 
Tylenol according to the directions for use on the labeling to help with your foot pain while in the 
study, if you need to. 
 
Ø The study takes about four and a half months to complete. 
Ø The study process is as follows: 
 
Screening Visit (Visit 1)  
If you are interested in taking part in this research study, we will conduct a screening visit at the 
test site. At this visit, we will review this consent form. Then, we will: 
 
· Ask you to rate your foot pain on a line from 0- 100, where ‘0’ means you have no pain at 
all, and ‘100’ means you have the worst pain imaginable.  
· Get information about your medical history, including information about medical 
conditions you may have and medicines you may take 
 
The visit should take about 15 minutes. 
 
Washout Phase (at home) 
The washout phase will start once you have successfully completed all of the screening 
procedures, and we can confirm that you are eligible for this study.  
 
Erchonia® FX- 635™ Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy Pain Clinical Study Informed Consent Form 
Version 1.0    Page 4 December 26, 2014 
  Subject ID:  ________________ The washout phase occurs for 2 days after you have qualified for the study but before you get the 
first study treatment. On each of the 2 days of the washout phase, you will need to: 
 
· Rate your foot pain on the same 0-100 line as you did during screening 
· Start taking only Tylenol to relieve any foot pain you may have 
· Write down each time you take a dose of Tylenol or any other medications you may take 
on those days for any reason. 
 
Pre-Treatment Phase (Visit 2) 
The pre-treatment phase will start once you have successfully completed the washout phase, and 
we can confirm that you continue to be eligible for this study. We will: 
 
· Get information about the history of your foot pain and your diabetes 
· Get information about medicines you are taking now for any reason  
· Get information about your age, gender, and ethnicity 
· Rate your foot pain on the same 0-100 line as you did during screening 
· Ask you to fill out a questionnaire about different symptoms of your foot pain  
 
The pre-treatment phase should take about 15 minutes. 
 
Treatment Phase (Visits 2 through 13 and at home) 
Ø The treatment phase will start after the pre-treatment phase is done, on the same day. 
Ø There are 12 treatments with the Erchonia® FX- 635™ .  
Ø The first treatment will happen on the same day as the pre-treatment phase. 
Ø You will need to go to the test site 11 more times over 6 weeks for another treatment. 
Ø Each treatment lasts 30 minutes, 15 minutes for each foot. 
Ø You will sit comfortably with your foot elevated, and the Erchonia FX- 635™  will be directed at 
3 points on your foot. The laser light will shine on your foot, but it will not touch your skin. 
Ø You will wear protective glasses to block out the laser light. 
Ø On each day of the 6 weeks of the treatment phase, you will need to record some of the same 
measures at home as you did during the washout phase. You will need to: 
 
· Write down each time you take a dose of Tylenol to relieve any foot pain 
· Write down any other medications you take on those days for any reason that is different 
than usual. 
 
Ø After each of the 12 treatments with the Erchonia® FX- 635™, you will need to rate your foot 
pain on the same 0-100 line as you did during screening. 
 
Post-Treatment Phase (Visit 13 and at home) 
Ø The post-treatment phase will start right after your last treatment with the Erchonia® FX- 635™ 
and last for three months. 
Ø Right after your last treatment with the Erchonia® FX- 635™, we will  ask you to: 
 
· rate your foot pain on the same 0-100 line as you did during screening 
· fill out the questionnaire about different symptoms of your foot pain  
· rate how satisfied you are with any change you may have noticed in your foot pain after 
receiving the treatments with the Erchonia® FX635™ on a 5 -point scale 
Erchonia® FX- 635™ Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy Pain Clinical Study Informed Consent Form 
Version 1.0    Page 5 December 26, 2014 
  Subject ID:  ________________ · record if you think you got the treatments with the real or the fake Erchoni a® FX635™  and 
why you think this 
 
Ø For four weeks after your last treatment with the Erchonia® FX-465™, you will be asked to 
continue to use only over-the-counter Tylenol to help with any pain in your feet. You cannot 
take any other medication or try any other treatments to help with your foot pain during 
those four weeks. You will need to write down every time you take a dose of over-the-
counter Tylenol during those four weeks, as you did during the washout and treatment 
phases. 
 
Ø Two weeks after your last treatment with the Erchonia® FX- 465™ , you will again need to rate 
the level of pain in your feet on the 0 to 100 line, at home. 
 
Ø Four weeks after your last treatment with the Erchonia® FX- 465™, at home, you will again 
need to: 
 
· rate your foot pain on the same 0-100 line as you did during screening 
· fill out the questionnaire about different symptoms of your foot pain  
· rate how satisfied you are with any change you may have noticed in your foot pain after 
receiving the treatments with the Erchonia® FX635™ on a 5-point scale 
 
Ø Three months after your last treatment with the Erchonia® FX- 465™, at home, you will again 
need to: 
 
· rate your foot pain on the same 0-100 line as you did during screening 
· fill out the questionnaire about different symptoms of your foot pain  
· rate how satisfied you are with any change you may have noticed in your foot pain after 
receiving the treatments with the Erchonia® FX635™ on a 5 -point scale 
 
RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
 
Ø There have been other research studies using Erchonia low level light lasers. In these studies, 
no serious medical events resulted from use of the study device. 
 
Ø The only known or anticipated risk with the use of the laser study device is that long-term 
exposure to laser light could cause damage to your eyesight. As a precaution, when you are 
given the treatments with the FX- 635™, you will be fitted with special darkened protective 
glasses to block out the light.  
 
Ø However, there may be unknown risks to using the laser study device with this study treatment 
such as skin irritation, discoloring, rash, indentations and infection. There may be side effects 
that are not known at this time. 
 
Ø It is possible that you will not get any improvement in your foot pain, or that it may even get 
worse.

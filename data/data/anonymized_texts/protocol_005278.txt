Acetaminophen efficacy study protocol  
 
Brief protocol:  
 
Patients will be consented for the study on the day of their first surgery.   
 
Randomization will be coordinated with pharmacy.  Patient will be randomized by 
pharmacy to receive either acetaminophen or placebo at the end of the case, a nd 
then for the next  24 hours.  
 
Anesthesia will be induced with fen tanyl, propofol, and rocuronium, administered  at 
the discretion of the anesthesiologists.   
 
The anesthetic will be maintained with a combination of isoflurane, remifentanil, 
nitrous oxide, and/or propofol.   
 
The surgeons are free to infiltrate the incision with local anesthe tic.   
 
At the end of the case while the patient is emerging from anesthesia, administer 1 
gram IV acetaminophen  or placebo  over 15 minutes.  Except for remifentanil, do not 
administer any  other opioids at the end of the case.   
 
At arrival to the ICU, a patient controlled analgesia (PCA) pump will be setup and 
immediately made available to the patient.   
 
The ICU nurse will be informed of the study, and handed material that will explain 
their portion of the study, including assessments and drug administration.   
 
After 24 hours, the post -operative assessment form filled out by nursing will be 
collected.   
 
Within 30 days of discharge following the second surgery, the patients will be 
contacted via their method of choice to participate in a brief survey.

1.0 Objectives  
1.1 Study Rationale  
Our primary goal is to conduct a pi lot study of a population -specific psychological intervention aimed at 
decreasing anxiety and promoting coping in caregivers of patients with malignant gliomas .  In this initial 
phase of the research, we will pi lot the intervention with 25 malignant glioma  caregivers in order to 
assess feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.  
 
1.2 Specific Aims  
1) To refine a caregiver -directed intervention and study protocol based on acceptability feedback from 
an open pil ot study with exit interviews.  
 
2.0 Background  
2.1 Introduction  
Malignant gliomas are the most common types of brain tumors and have a disease course characterized 
by high symptom burden and rapid cancer progression.1,2  Survival of patients with glioblastoma, the mo st 
common type of malignant glioma, is on the order of 15 months, even in patients treated aggressively with 
chemotherapy and radiation.1,3,4 Thus, a diagnosis of malignant glioma has a significant impact on a 
patient’s family and friends (“caregivers”). There is increasing recognition that caregivers who experience 
substantial distress related to their loved one’s serious medical illness have worse physical and 
psychological health, which also may negatively impact  the patient’s health and outcomes.5-14 Caregivers 
of patients with brain tumors face sig nificant challenges due to the impact of the cancer on the patients’ 
central nervous system. Specifically, these caregivers m ust cope with their loved one’s progressive 
cognitive decline, personality and behavior changes, and accumulation of neurological d eficits as the 
disease progresses.15-18  This is physically, financially and emotio nally draining, and caregivers of patients 
with malignant gliomas experience poor quality of life and high rates of psychological distress.19-21 We 
conducted a prospective study of patients with newly diagnosed mal ignant glioma and their caregivers 
(DF/HCC 15 -500), with preliminary results demonstr ating that more than 50% of caregivers had 
clinically significant anxiety at the time of their loved one’s diagnosis, with almost two -thirds 
endorsing anxiety over their c ourse of illness.  Despite the high rates of distress in caregivers of patients 
with m alignant gliomas, few interventions have been developed to address the unique supportive care and 
coping needs of this highly burdened caregiver population.19  
 
The goal o f this proposal is to pilot a population -specific psychological intervention aimed at  
decreasing anxiety and promoting coping in caregivers of patients with malignant gliomas.  Our 
intervention is based on a conceptual framework for caregiver -directed inter ventions developed by our 
multi -disciplinary team.  We recently used this framework t o develop an intervention for caregivers of 
patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation, which was highly acceptable and beneficial to 
caregivers who participated in t he open pilot study. While the proposed intervention is based upon this 
framework, we  have used qualitative data collected from caregivers of patients with malignant glioma 
(DF/HCC 15 -500 and DF/HCC 18 -171) to refine the intervention and ensure that it is targeted to the 
specific needs of this caregiver population. Our study population wil l include caregivers within the first 
six months of their loved one’s diagnosis with malignant glioma who report clinically significant anxiety. 
We opted to enroll caregiv ers with clinically significant anxiety as they are in greatest need of a behavioral 
intervention focused on their distress and concerns about their loved one’s health and diagnosis. Enrolled 
caregivers will participate in six weekly, cognitive -behavioral therapy -based, individual sessions with a 
mental health clinician, designed to provid e them with the strategies and coping skills to manage the 
distress related to their loved one’s illness. Findings from this project may inform the development of a 
future  randomized efficacy trial to demonstrate the impact of the intervention on caregiver s’ psychological 
outcomes, coping, and well -being.  
 
3.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
 
The population for this study will include English -speaking adults (age ≥ 18) who are  the primary 
caregiver for an individual diagnosed with a malignant glioma within the past 6 months and present for 
cancer care at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, MA. The caregiver must  also 
have at least mild anxiety  symptoms, de fined as a 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD -7) score 
of 5 or greate r. See Table 1 for a summary of study inclusion/exclusion criteria:  
 
Table 1. Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
 
Rationale for inclusion/exclusion:  This research is focused on developing an intervention for caregivers 
with malignant gliomas. Only participants within 6 -months of their loved one’s brain tumor diagnosis are 
eligible to participate, as the intervention is targeted at the stres sors caregi vers may face during this time. 
Participants must be able to speak and read in English as we do not have the resources to c onduct the 
intervention in additional languages.  Participants must report clinically significant anxiety symptoms, 
defined as a Gene ralized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD -7) score ≥5 , as our intervention intends to address 
anxiety symptoms in caregivers. Caregivers deemed inappropriate for the study by the patient’s clinician 
or the study PI will be ineligible to participate.  Pregnant wom en will be included in the study. Adults 
unable to consent, individuals who are not yet adults, and prisoners will not be included.  
 
Screening for eligibility  Inclusion Criteria  Exclusion Criteria  
Age ≥ 18  Deemed inappropriat e for the study by the 
patient’s clinician or the study PI  
Identified by a patient with a malignant glioma 
(WHO Grade III or IV glioma) as the patient’s 
primary caregiver   
The patient is receiving care at the MGH Cancer 
Center   
The patient was diagnosed  with a malignant glioma 
within the past 6 months   
Able to speak and read in English   
Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 -item (GAD -7) 
score ≥5   
Participants may or may not be pregnant.   
Study staff will review the outpatient clinic schedule for the Yawkey 9E Brain Tumor Clinic to id entify 
patients with malignant gliomas.  To facilitate identification of potential participants and assess eligibility, 
study staff will review minimum necessary medical record data via a HIPAA waiver. This will ensure that 
caregivers are potentially eligi ble to participate in the study prior to contacting them to obtain informed 
consent. Prior to contacting potential participants identified via screening, the patient’s primary treating 
oncologist will be contacted to inform them that we plan to approach th e patient’s caregiver for study 
participation and to inquire about any concerns regarding study participation. If clinicians have specific 
concerns about the appropriateness of enrolling a particular caregiver, we will not contact that caregiver.

7.0 Study Timelines  
As this cognitive -behavioral therapy -based intervention consists of 6 weekly or biweekly sessions with a 
mental health clinician, an individual subject will participate for approximately 6 to 12 weeks. We 
anticipate that all study subjects will be enrolled  within 18 months and that the st udy will be complete 
by January 2020 . 
 
8.0 Study Endpoints  
The primary endpoint of this study is feasibility of the interve ntion.  In an exploratory analysis, we will 
examine preliminary efficacy of the intervention in improvin g caregiver -reported outcomes from baseline 
to post -intervention.  
 
9.0 Procedures Involved  
9.1 Recruitment  
Study staff will review the outpatient clinic schedul e for the Yawkey  9E Brain Tumor Clinic to identify 
patients with malignant gliomas.  To facilitate identification of potential participants and assess 
eligibility, study staff will review minimum necessary medical record data via a HIPAA waiver. This 
will ensure that care givers are potentially eligible to participate in the study prior to contacting them to 
obtain informed consent. Prior to contacting potential participants identified via screening, the patient’s 
primary treating oncologist will be contacte d to inform them  that we plan to approach the patient’s 
caregiver for study participation and to inquire about any concerns regarding study participation. If 
clinicians have specific concerns about the appropriateness of enrolling a particular caregiver, w e will 
not conta ct that caregiver.  
 
9.2 Enrollment  
A member of study staff (e.g. PI, Research Assistants) will obtain informed consent in  person prior to 
initiating any study measures. Participants will be c onsented next time they are in clinic. Research 
assis tants, all of wh om previously have received CITI and consent training, will be provided study -
specific recruitment training. Caregivers who would like more time to consider participation at in -clinic 
approach are able to take the consent forms home with th em to review. Ca regivers will be provided with 
study staff contact information if any questions or concerns regarding the research arise.  
 
9.3 Registration  
Study staff will register eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) OnCore 
as required by D F/HCC SOP REGIS T-101 after the participant completes the brief enrollment survey. 
Caregivers who report GAD -7 scores <5  will be considered ineligible for the study and will not be 
registered in OnCore. If a caregiver’s GAD -7 score renders t hem ineligible b ut they are still interested in 
the study, we will re -approach them in 3 months to re -administer the GAD -7. Caregivers who do not 
complete the brief enrollment survey will not be registered in OnCore.  
 
9.4 Study design  
This study will be a prospective, single -arm pilot study to assess feasibility and acceptability of a 
psychological intervention for caregivers of patients with malignant gliomas.  We will use qualitative 
data to refine a multicomponent psychological intervention specifically targeting the needs of caregivers 
of patients with malignant gliomas who are within the first 6 months of diagnosis.  We will collect 
demographics at baseline and will ask caregive rs to complete a questionnaire pre - and post -intervention 
to assess caregive rs’ self-reported information about mood, caregiver burden, coping, quality of life and 
illness understanding . 
 
9.5 Selection of Instruments  
 
9.5.1 7 -Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD -7) 
The GAD -7 (Appendix 31. 01)22 is a valid self -report measure for assessing generalized anxiety24 in 
patients with cancer.23 Patients indicate how often they have been bothered by symptoms over the last 2 
weeks us ing a likert -type scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Nearly eve ry day).  Scores of 5 to 9 are 
categorized as mild anxiety, scores of 10 to 14 as moderate anxiety, and scores of 15 or greater as severe 
anxiety. Patients with scores ≥ 5  on the GAD -7 (mild  symptomatology ) will be eligible for 
participation.25 The estimate d time for completing this scale is 1 -3 minutes.  
 
 
9.5.2 Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)  
We will use the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to assess symptoms of depression and 
anxiety in all study participants. The HADS is a 14 -item questio nnaire that contains two 7 -item 
subscales assessing depression and anxiety symptoms during the past week ( Appendix 31 .02)26. Used 
extensively in samples of patients with cancer and their caregivers, the questionna ire consists of a four -
point item response format that quantifies the degree to which participants experience mood symptoms. 
Scores on each subscale range from 0 to 21, with a cutoff of 8 or greater denoting clinically significant  
anxiety or depression.  T he estimated time for completing this scale is 2 -5 minutes.  
 
9.5.3 Brief Demographic Survey  
This includes self -reported information about participants’ gender, race, ethnicity, religion, education, 
relationship status, household members, employment status,  relationship to the patient, and years they 
have known the patient. It is estimated that these qu estions ( Appendix 31 .03) will take approximately 1 -
3 minutes to complete.  
 
9.5.4 Locator Form  
This includes self -reported contact information for participants and information necessary for 
registration in OnCore, including full name, address, phone number(s), email address, and date of birth. 
It also asks participants their preferr ed mode of communication with the stu dy team (phone, text, or 
email). It is estimated that these questions ( Append ix 31 .04) will take approximately 1 -3 minutes to 
complete.  
 
9.5.5 Caregiver Quality of Life (QoL)  
We wi ll use the CareGiver Oncology QoL que stionnaire (CarGOQoL), a 29 -item, well -validated 
instrument specific to caregivers for patients with cancer, to measure family caregiver QoL in multiple 
domains.27  It is estimat ed that the CarGOQoL ( Appendix 31 .05) will take approximately 2 -4 minutes to 
complete.  
 
9.5.6 Caregiving Burden  
Caregiving burden will be measured using the Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA).28 It is esti mated 
that this tool ( Appendix 31 .06) will take approximately 3 -5 minutes to complete  
 
9.5.7 Self-Efficacy  
We will use the Lewis Cancer Self -Efficacy Scale (CASE) to measure caregivers’ confidence in 
managing the impact of their loved one’s illness.29  The CASE questio nnaire is included as Appendix 
31.07 and will take approximately 2 -4 min utes to complete.  
 
9.5.8 Perceived Coping Skills  
We will use the Measure of Current Status (MOCS) to assess caregivers’ self -perceived status on skills 
targeted by the intervention including abilit y to relax, recognizing stress -inducing situations, 
restruc turing maladaptive thoughts, and coping.30  The MOCS is included as Appendix 31 .08.  It is 
estimated that the MOCS will take approximately 2 -4 minutes to comple te. 
 
9.5.9 Qualitative Exit Interview  
We will use a semi -structured interview guide that will explore 1) caregiver perception of the 
acceptability and content of the intervention; and 2) caregiver perceptions of the benefits of receiving 
the intervention. Facilitators will use probes to obtain comprehensive unders tanding of the caregivers’ 
perspectives. The semi -structured interview  guide is detailed in Appendix 31 .09. The interview will last 
approximately 30 minutes.  
 
9.6 Description of Intervention  
We utilized the findings f rom our longitudinal and qualitative studies and a thorough review of the 
literature to identify the necessary components of our planned caregiver in tervention. The preliminary 
content includes three essential components: 1) a psychoeducational component t o address preparedness, 
manage expectations, and develop caregiving skills; 2) a psychosocial component focusing on coping 
strategies, mindfulness, a nd facilitating acceptance while living with uncertainty; and 3) a self -care 
component to promote caregiver  health and well -being. We anticipate that the psychological 
intervention will consist of six individual sessions ( 45 minutes each), which will provi de sufficient dose 
to promote effective coping and reduce caregiving burden. Whenever possible, we will coo rdinate 
sessions with hospital and clinic visits or conduct them via phone or video conference  (using a HIPAA -
compliant video platform provided by MG H TeleHealth ) to minimize participant burden and facilitate 
adherence. The intervention will be delivered b y a social worker or psychologist in the MGH Cancer 
Center, specifically trained on the intervention content and delivery. Interventionists may conta ct 
caregivers directly via text message, phone call, or email  to coordinate session scheduling  only. No 
identifying information will be shared via text or email; these will be used solely for scheduling 
purposes.  In the Locator Form (Appendix 31. 04), participants will be asked to indicate their preferred 
method of communic ation (phone call, text, or email), and the study team will use this response to 
determine how to contact participants.   In this pilot study, we will  enroll 25 caregivers of patients with 
malignant gliomas to assess fidelity and acceptability of the interv ention. Attached as Appendix 31 .15 is 
the Intervention Manual for our Psychological Intervention for Caregivers of Patients with Malignant 
Gliomas,  which will be used as the basis for the intervention.  We have refined  the intervention to tailor 
it to the needs specific to this population of caregivers, based on our qualitative interview data .  
 
9.7 Instrument Administration  
A member of study staff trained in qualitative interviewing will facilitate the interview s over the phone 
or in person using a semi -structured interview guide with open -ended questions  and response probes 
(Appendix 31. 09), and the interview will last approximately 30 minutes. All interviews will be audio -
recorded; study staff will ask for permission to turn on the  audio -recorder prior to beginnin g each 
interview.  A script for administration of the qualitative interview over the phone is included as 
Appendix 31.1 4. 
 
The brief en rollment survey (Appendi ces 31.03, 31.04) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder 
measure ( Appendix 31.01 ) may be completed by participants via mail  correspondence , online using a 
secure website (REDCap), over the phone, or in clinic at MGH, in accordance with participant 
preferences and availability.  The message templates for administration of the GAD -7 and e nrollment 
survey by mail and REDCa p are in cluded as Appendices  31.11 and 31.12, respectively . A script for 
survey administration over the phone is included as Appendix 31.13 . Only participants who have a 
GAD -7 score ≥5 will be registered in OnCore and complete the  qualitative interview. Caregivers with 
GAD -7 scores <5 will be considered ineligible for the study.  If a caregiver is ineligible based on his or 
her GAD -7 score but is still interested in the study, we will re-approach in 3 months and re -administer 
the GAD -7. 
 
10.0 Data and Specimen Banking  
N/A 
 
11.0 Data Management  and Confidentiality  
11.1 Sample size and power calculations  
We will recruit and consent 25 caregivers for the open pilot. We chose the sample size of 25 caregiv ers 
based on the feasibility of completing the project in a timely fashion, given the rarity of this di sease. It is 
expected that it will take approximately twelve to eighteen  months to complete accrual for the study. 
The proposed sample size is also suffi cient to provide us with preliminary data that can be utilized to 
determine the effect size and adequat ely power a multi -center randomized controlled trial in the 
future.54,55  
 
 
 
 
11.2 Analysis Plan  
Feasibility will be defined by rates of enrollment and partici pation.  We will report the proportion of 
eligible caregivers who agree to participate in the intervent ion and the proportion of intervention visits 
completed by each participant. Additionally, we will examine reasons for declining participation, 
incomplet e session attendance, and early withdrawal from the study. The intervention will be deemed 
feasible if at least 70% (+/ - 18%) of eligible caregivers are enrolled in the study and if at least 70% of 
enrolled participants complete ≥50% of the sessions.31-34 We will use descriptive statistics to summarize 
the demographic and clinical characteristics of caregivers enrolled in the study. We will audio -record 
and transcribe the individual semi -structured exit interviews and analyze qualitative data according to 
NIH Best Practices for Mixed Methods Research in the Health Sciences.35  Study  staff will 
independently review the transcripts to create a thematic framework for interpretation.  Two individuals, 
including the Principal Investigator , will independently code  the data to enhance validity and credibility, 
until high reliability is achi eved (Kappa>0.80). The planned sample size will allow us to collect 
comprehensive feedback and ensures sufficient number of participants to achieve thematic saturation.  In 
an exp loratory analysis, we will also examine changes in caregiver -reported outcome s from baseline to 
post-intervention using paired t -tests.  
 
11.3 Data Collection  
Data will be collected primarily in the form of caregiver interviews.  Interviews will be audio recorde d 
on a digital recorder, and the audio files will be stored in an encrypted c omputer drive on the secure 
Partners network. Caregivers will complete the 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD -7) to 
determine whether they are eligible to participate in an interview. We will also gather demographic and 
contact information abou t our sample via a brief enrollment survey.  Specifically, we will collect data 
on:

To safeguard participant information and confidentiality, all data will be stored in locked cabinets in 
study staff’s offices, in password -protected computer files, and in REDCap  databases, all of which are 
accessible only to trained and IRB -approved study  staff. Participants' data will be identified by an ID 
number only, and a link between names and ID numbers will be kept separately under lock and key or in 
a separate password p rotected document accessible only by study staff.  
 
As part of the NIH data sha ring directive, deidentified data from this study will be transferred to the 
PCRC De -identified Data Repository located at the University of Colorado. Any deidentified data that 
are collected and entered will remain in the PCRC Data Repository indefinitely . All future data analysis 
will be performed on de -identified data in the PCRC Data Repository. While the information and data 
resulting from this study may be presented at scien tific meetings or published in a scientific journal, 
participant identities wi ll not be revealed. Data will be presented in aggregate reports without patient -
level identifiers.  
 
Consistent with the PCRC Data Sharing Policy, the data from this study will be  deidentified and will be 
transferred and stored on a server maintained by the  PCRC at the University of Colorado (U of CO). U 
of CO’s Office of Information Technology (OIT) Department provides University employees with 
centralized file sharing services. C entralized file servers are Windows -based virtual systems hosted in 
OIT’s vmwa re server environment. These servers are proactively monitored by the automated 
monitoring system, patched on a monthly basis with latest security patches and updates, and backed  up 
nightly by OIT’s Enterprise backup solution, consistent with good data sto rage practices.  
 
 
12.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects  
N/A. This study does not involve more than Minimal Risk to subjects.  
 
 
13.0 Withdrawal of Subjects  
We do not anticipate that any research participants will be withdrawn from the study without their 
consent. If a participant requests withdrawal from the study, we will ask them if they are comfortable 
sharing the reason for withdrawal to ensure that there  are no adverse events to report to the IRB. We will 
ask the study participant if they are still willing to permit the study team to continue to monitor their 
health record, but withdraw from all other study procedures.  
 
 
14.0 Risks to Subjects  
We do not antic ipate that participants in the psychological intervention or qualitative interviews will 
experience any serious adverse reactions. If a participant expresses distress during the psychological 
intervention visits or exit interviews, they will be reassured b y the psychologist and the research staff that 
they can stop the intervention and they need not answer any of the interview questions which they find 
upsetting. They will also be reminded that study participation is voluntary. If participants remain 
distre ssed, both the Principal Investigator and the oncologist will be notified. Additionally, we will offer 
participants who remain distressed an opportunity to meet with either the principal investigator (Dr. 
Deborah Forst) or a clinical psychologist (Dr. Jose ph Greer, a co -investigator) to help address their 
distress.  Should participants require further support, we will offer them an opportunity to meet with the 
MGH Neuro Oncology Clinic social worker for additional follow -up. 
 
 
15.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects  
Preliminary data have demonstrated that more than 50% of caregivers of patients with malignant 
gliomas have clinically significant anxiety at the time of their loved one’s diagnosis, with almost two -
thirds endorsing anxiety over their course of illness. Th e proposed psychological intervention aims to 
decrease anxiety and promote coping in this highly burdened caregiver population. Participation in this 
study may help to improve caregivers’ mental health by addressing their unique supportive care and 
coping needs. 
 
 
16.0 Vulnerable Populations  
We plan to include pregnant women in this study. As this is a psychological and behavioral study only, 
additional safeguards are not needed for this population.  No other vulnerable populations will be 
included in this study.  
 
17.0 Community -Based Participatory Research  
N/A 
18.0 Sharing of Results with Subjects  
We will provide the research team contact information to each participant and encourage them to contact 
us if they would like to receive updates and information on the research fin dings.  
 
19.0 Setting  
Study staff will review the outpatient clinic schedule for the Yawkey 9E Brain Tumor Clinic to identify 
patients with malignant gliomas. Staff will approach the caregive rs of these patients in clinic to obtain 
consent and administer survey s and questionnaires. Intervention sessions will be administered in person 
here at MGH. Qualitative exit interviews may be administered in person at MGH or over the phone.  
 
20.0 Resources Available  
20.1 Team Qualification and Oversight  
The overall PI of the project (Dr. Forst) is responsible for full oversight of the project. Dr. Forst 
currently has 60% of her time protected to conduct research activities. She will be meeting with study 
staff on weekly basis (and more often as urgent iss ues arise) to ensure the study  process is being 
followed accurately and to address potential challenges or issues as t hey may arise. Dr. Forst is a 
member of the MGH Cancer Outcomes Research Program (CORe).  CORe has extensive experience 
conducting support ive care intervention studies in oncology and has the necessary expertise to ensure 
the success of the proposed project. Research coordinators, all of whom previously have received CITI 
and consent training, will be provided study -specific recruitment trai ning.  
20.2 Other Resources  
There ar e approximately 100 new malignant glioma patients in the Yawkey 9E Brain Tumor Clinic each 
year, so we will need to recruit abou t 33% of these patients’ caregivers in order to reach our target 
accrual of 25 caregivers over the  course of 18 months . 
 
See Sec tion 14.0 for a description of the resources available to subjects given possible consequences of 
the research.  
 
21.0 Prior Approvals  
We will obtain IRB approval prior to initiating any study procedures.  
 
22.0 Recruitment Methods  
Study staff will review the outpatie nt clinic schedule for the Yawkey 9E Brain Tumor Clinic to identify 
patients with malignant gliomas.  To facilitate identification of potential participants and assess 
eligibility, study staff will review minimum necessa ry medical record data via a HIPAA w aiver. This 
will ensure that caregivers are potentially eligible to participate in the study prior to contacting them to 
obtain informed consent. Prior to contacting potential participants identified via screening, the p atient’s 
primary treating oncologist  will be contacted by email to inform them that we plan to approach the 
patient’s caregiver for s tudy participation and to inquire about any concerns regarding study 
participation. The email template  for obtaining permis sion from oncologists  is included as  Appendi x 
31.10 . If clinicians have specific concerns about the appropriateness of enrolling a particular caregiver, 
we will not contact that caregiver.  
 
A member of study staff (e.g. PI, Research Assistants)  will obtain informed consent in -person prior to 
initiating any study measures. Research assistants, all of whom previously have received CITI and consent 
training, will be provided study -specific recruitment training. C aregivers who would like more time t o 
consider participation at in -clinic approach are able to take the consent forms home with them to review. 
Caregivers will be provided with study staff contact information if any questions or concerns regarding 
the rese arch arise.  
 
Study staff will regis ter eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) OnCore 
as required by DF/HCC SOP REGIST -101 after the participant completes the brief enrollment survey. 
Caregivers who report GAD -7 scores <5  will be considered ineligible for the s tudy and will not be 
registered in OnCore. Caregivers who do not complete the brief enrollment survey will not be registered 
in OnCore.  
 
23.0 Local Number of Subjects  
A total of 25 subjects  (excluding screen failures)  will b e accrued locally. We expect more th an 50% to 
demonstrate at least mild anxiety (GAD -7 score of 5 or greater)  so total accrual of no more than 50 
caregivers including screen failures should be necessary.  
 
24.0 Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
To safeguard participant inform ation and confidentiality, all data will be stored in locked cabinets in 
study staff’s offices, in password -protected computer files, and in REDCap databases, all of which are 
accessible only to trained and IRB -approved study  staff. Participants' data will  be identified by an ID 
number only, and a link between names and ID numbers will be kept separately under lock and key or in 
a separate password protected document accessible only by study staff.  
 
25.0 Compensation for Research -Related Injury  
We do not anticip ate any research -related injury due to involvement in this supportive care intervention.  
 
26.0 Economic Burden to  Subject s 
There will be no financial burden on study participants.  
 
27.0 Consent Process  
As stated previously, a member of  study staff (e.g. PI, Research  Assistant) will obtain informed consent 
in-person during clinic appointments or infusion prior to initiating any study measures. Research 
assistants, all of whom previously have received CITI and consent training, will be pr ovided study -specific 
recruitme nt training. Caregivers who would like more time to consider participation at in -clinic approach 
are able to take the consent forms home with them to review. Caregivers will be provided with study staff 
contact information if  any questions or concerns rega rding the research arise.  
We will follow all the requirements of SOP: Informed Consent Process (CON -100) in obtaining 
informed consent for study participants.  
 
 
28.0 Process to Document Consent in Writing  
As stated previously, al l caregivers participating in t he study will provide written informed consent.

IRB PROTOCOL   
 1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
Title:  Phase  I/II Clinical  Trial of Copanlisib  and Ibrutinib  in Mantle  Cell Lymphoma  
 
Objectives:  The objective  of this trial is to determine  toxicity,  maximum  tolerated  dose  and/or  
recommended  phase  II dose,  and preliminary  efficacy  of the combination  copanlisib  and ibrutinib  
in patients  with mantle  cell lymphoma  (MCL).  
Patient  Population:  Patients  with relapsed  or refractory  MCL with at least 1 prior line of therapy  
are eligible.  
Study  Design:  This is a two stage  protocol  comprised  of a single  institution  phase  I dose  
escalation  trial using  standard  3+3 design  and a phase  II two stage  Simon  mini-max clinical  trial. 
Treatment Plan:  Following  enrollment,  patients  will be assigned  to receive  therapy  with ibrutinib  
given  by mouth  daily and copanlisib  given  by intravenous  injection  once  per week  on days 1, 8, 
15 of a 28 day cycle.  
The phase  II cohort  will accrue  patients  at the MTD dose  of copanlisib  and ibrutinib  determined  
during  phase  I. Patients  will accrue  in a two stage  design  and monitored  for safety  of copanlisib  
and ibrutinib  combination  therapy,  duration  of response,  best response  within  1 year,  progression  
free survival,  event  free survival,  and correlative  biomarkers.  
Time  to Completion:  In the phase  I dose  escalation  portion  of the study  of 3 dose  levels,  a 
minimum  of 4 patients  and a maximum  of 18 patients  will be needed  to complete  this phase.  The 
amount  of time required  to complete  the dose  escalation  portion  of this trial will depend  on the 
number  of dose  levels  studied  and the number  of patients  accrued  to each  cohort.  The phase  II 
two stage  Simon  mini-max will enroll  18 patients  in the first stage.  If 5 or more  patients  have a 
complete  response  by 6 months,  the trial will enroll  to a total number  of 33 patients.  We anticipate  
enrolling  2-3 patients  per month  for an approximate  accrual  time of 2 years.

3.0     BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE  
 
MCL is a unique  subtype  of NHL characteristic  with the t(11;14)  (q13;q32)  balanced  chromosomal  
translocation  of the cyclin  D1 gene  (bcl-1) on chromosome  11 to the immunoglobulin  heavy  chain  
(IGH)  enhancer  region  on chromosome  14, which  results  in Cyclin  D1 over expression  and 
increased  cell proliferation  of the tumor  cells[1].  With a prevalence  of 5% to 6% of all NHL,  MCL 
accounts  for up to 8000  newly  diagnosed  NHL cases  in US and EU each  year.  
With the exception  of rare patients  who enjoy  long term disease -free survival  after non- 
myeloablative  allogeneic  stem  cell transplantation,  patients  with MCL are not considered  cured  of 
their disease.  Most MCL patients  are treated  with rituximab  in combination  with different  
chemotherapy  regimens.  The initial  treatment  usually  yields  a high response  rate, however,  most  
patients  relapse  following  initial  therapy  and their median  survival  after relapse  is about  1-2 years  
[2]. For relapsed  MCL,  ibrutinib  is an FDA approved  agent.  
Ibrutinib  in MCL has high response  rates  of 60-70%.  However,  the median  duration  of response  is 
18 months  [3]. We can potentially  improve  response  rates  and duration  of responses  with 
combination  therapy.  
The BCR  Pathway  and ibrutinib  
 
Chronic  activation  of the B cell receptor  (BCR)  pathway  is essential  for survival  and proliferation  of 
malignant  B cells.  Strong  survival,  cell proliferation  and cell homeostasis  pathways  including  
Bruton’s  tyrosine  kinase  (BTK)  mediated  NF-ĸB activation  and phosphatidylinositide  3-kinase  
(PI3K)  triggered  mTOR  activation  result  from BCR  engagement.  Bruton's  tyrosine  kinase  (BTK)  
functions  as an intermediary  between  the BCR  ligand  activation  and NF-ĸB activation  in normal  B 
cells.  
Ibrutinib  forms an irreversible  covalent  bond  at cysteine  481 in the BTK active  site to quench  BTK 
tyrosine  phosphorylation.  The drug is well tolerated  and shows  strong  activity  in many  lymphomas  
including  mantle  cell lymphoma  (MCL),  follicular  lymphoma  (FL) and diffuse  large  B cell lymphoma  
(DLBCL)  (Table  3-1). A phase  I study  of ibrutinib  in various  B cell malignancies  showed  that ibrutinib  
was well tolerated  with an excellent  safety  profile  and was associated  with an objective  response  
rate of 60%.[4]  Across five dose  levels  (1.25,  2.5, 5.0, 8.3, and 12.5 mg/kg/day),  there  were  only 2 
DLTs  that occurred  in 56 total patients  (one grade  3 allergic   hypersensitivity  in a patient  with a

history  of drug hypersensitivity  and one dose  interruption  for more  than 7 days due to transient  
grade  2 neutropenia).  There  was no consistent  relationship  between  dose  level and adverse  events.  
An MTD was not reached.  Therefore,  for an average  70 kg person,  doses  ranging  from 87.5 mg/day  
to 875 mg/day were  found  to be safe in the phase  I study.  For further  study  in B cell non-Hodgkin  
lymphoma,  an optimal  biologic  dose  of 560 mg/daily  was established  and associated  with full BTK 
receptor  occupancy.  Recently  published  phase  II studies  of ibrutinib  also demonstrated  that the 
drug is well-tolerated  at a dose  of 560mg/daily  in mantle  cell lymphoma  and 420 mg/daily  in chronic  
lymphocytic  leukemia  [5, 6]. 
In R/R MCL,  a phase  II study  of 111 patients  showed  an overall  response  rate of 68% while  the 
majority  of responses  seen  were  partial  responses  (47%)  [3]. The median  duration  of response  was 
17.5 months  with a PFS of 13.9 months  [3]. In a small phase  I study of FL, 16 patients  treated  with 
ibrutinib  demonstrated  an ORR of 55%,  median  PFS 13.4 months  [7]. In DLBCL,  the effectiveness  
of ibrutinib  was seen  primarily  in non-GCB  subtype.  When  analyzing  both the non-GCB  and GCB  
DLBCL  responses,  the ORR  in DLBCL  was 21.7%  [8]. However,  the non-GCB  DLBCL  subgroup  
showed  an ORR  of 40% with a median  PFS of 5.5 months  [8]. 
Clearly,  ibrutinib  has definitive  clinical  activity  and improvements  can be made  to prolong  overall  
response,  duration  of response  (DOR)  and progression  free survival  (PFS).  Logically,  ibrutinib  is 
suitable  for combination  with other  targeted  therapies  with broad  single  agent  activity  such  as PI3K 
inhibitors  (Table  3-1).

The PI3K  pathway  and copanlisib  
 
The class  I PI3K pathway  includes  four isoforms : PI3Kα,  PI3Kβ,  PI3Kδ,  and PI3Kγ  [9]. PI3Kδ  and 
-γ expression  is largely  limited  to leukocytes  while  PI3K -α and -β are ubiquitously  expressed  [10]. 
PI3Kα  mutations  and amplifications  have been  identified  across  multiple  cancer  subtypes  and 
both overexpression  of PI3Kα  and gain of function  PI3Kα  mutations  were  found  to be oncogenic  
[11-14]. PI3Kα   is also the primary  isoform  required  for insulin  signaling  [15]. PI3Kβ  isoform  has 
roles in regulating  formation  and stability  of integrin  which  is required  for platelet  activation  [16]. 
PI3Kδ  and -γ regulate  leukocyte  trafficking  and cell proliferation  [17-20]. Mice with functionally  
deficient  PI3Kδ  have impaired  immune  systems  with abnormal  antibody  development  and 
inflammatory  bowel  disease  [20]. However,  dissecting  the individual  function  of class  I PI3K 
isoforms  have been  complicated  by the heterodimeric  nature  of the proteins  as altering  
expression  of one subunit  affects  the expression  profile  of others.  
Multiple  PI3K inhibitors  have been  in development  for B-cell non-Hodgkin  lymphoma  (NHL)  (Table  
3-2). Idelalisib,  a delta specific  PI3K inhibitor,  was the first and currently  the only PI3K inhibitor   
with regulatory  approval  in relapsed/refractory  chronic  lymphocytic  leukemia  (CLL),  small  
lymphocytic  lymphoma  (SLL)  and follicular  lymphoma  (FL). Chronic  administration  of idelalisib  is 
associated  with low but clinically  meaningful  risk of transaminitis,  pneumonitis,  colitis,  and

opportunistic  infections  [21]. Duvelisib,  a PI3K δ and γ inhibitor,  demonstrated  approximately  50% 
overall  response  rate in indolent  NHL with a 10 month  median  duration  of response  [22]. Dreyling  
et al. reported  on the safety and efficacy  of copanlisib,  a pan PI3K inhibitor  with primarily  α and δ 
activity,  in relapsed/refractory  B-cell NHL.  Clinical  response  rate is 59% in FL, and 64% in mantle  
cell lymphoma  (MCL)[23,  24]. Most commonly  observed  adverse  events  were  hyperglycemia  
(49%),  hypertension  (29%),  fatigue  (12%),  and diarrhea  (18%). The availability  of a PI3Kα/δ  
inhibitor  in the form of copanlisib  allows  us to dissect  the relevance  of specific  PI3K isoforms  in 
lymphoma.  Potentially,  the dual PI3K α/δ inhibition  by copanlis ib blocks  compensatory  resistance  
mechanisms  to PI3K inhibitors.

Various  models  support  the importance  of multiple  PI3K isoforms  in lymphomagenesis.  In one 
model  of resistance  to PI3K inhibitors,  primary  mantle  cell lymphoma  patient  samples  
demonstrated  compensatory  increase  of PI3Kα  in the relapsed  setting  [30]. In addition,  while  
PI3Kδ  inhibition  reduced  B-cell receptor  induced  PI3K activation,  dual inhibition  of PI3Kα  and –δ 
was required  for effective  blockade  of PI3K signaling[30].   Increased  protein  expression  and copy 
number  gains  of PI3Kα  have also been  identified  in various  lymphomas  indicating  a role of PI3Kα  
in lymphomagenesis  [31, 32]. Furthermore,  two independent  studies  support  the importance  of 
dual PI3Kα  and –δ inhibition.  Using  a PI3Kα  shRNA  knockdown  model,  DLBCL  cell lines are 
more  sensitive  to dual inhibition  of PI3Kα  and –δ blockade  [33]. Similar  studies  using  PI3K 
isoform  specific  inhibitors  demonstrate  that combination  of PI3Kα  and –δ inhibition  is required  for 
suppression  of phospho -AKT,  and downstream  NFkB  and PI3K pathways  [31, 33].  Resistance  to 
PI3K δ inhibition  may be overcome  by concurrent  PI3Kα  inhibition  [33].

Synergy  of PI3K  and BTK  inhibitors  
 
In vitro combinatorial  screens  identified  PI3K inhibitors  and BTK inhibitors  as strongly  synergistic  
[34]. A patient  derived  xenograft  model  demonstrate  that combination  of BTK and PI3K α/δ 
inhibition  is more  active  compared  to BTK inhibition  alone  [33]. An observed  rebound  activation  of 
AKT and BTK associated  with isolated  PI3K or BTK inhibition  provides  a mechanistic  rationale  for 
synergy  between  PI3K and BTK inhibitors  in diffuse  large  B cell lymphoma  [31]. Thus,  PI3K 
inhibitor  such  as copanlisib  may be suitable  for combination  with BTK inhibitors  such  as ibrutinib.  
Two early phase  studies  using  PI3K and BTK inhibitors  demonstrate  the feasibility  of this 
approach  [35, 36]. Both buparlisib,  an oral pan-PI3K inhibitor,  and umbralisib  (TG-1202),  an oral 
PI3K delta inhibitor  have been  combined  with the BTK inhibitor  ibrutinib  with promising  efficacy  in 
CLL and MCL [35, 36]. The phase  I/II study  of buparlisib,  a pan-PI3K inhibitor,  and ibrutinib  
(protocol  16-009) at MSK showed  high clinical  activity  in mantle  cell lymphoma.  Of 11 treated  
patients  thus far, the overall  response  rate is 100%  with 9 complete  responses  and 2 partial  
responses.  Two independent  preclinical  studies  investigating  the combinations  of copanlisib  and 
ibrutinib  and a PI3Kα/δ  inhibitor  and ibrutinib  generated  promising  activity  specifically  in ABC- 
DLBCL  [16, 33]. Therefore,  a molecularly  based  evaluation  of PI3Kα/δ  and BTK inhibition  is a 
promising  approach  for treatment  of lymphoma.  
 
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This is a phase  I/II, open  label single  institution  trial. The phase  I study  is a standard  3 x 3 dose  
escalation  trial to assess  the safety  of combination  therapy  with copanlisib  and ibrutinib.  We will 
enroll  a dose  escalation  cohort  treating  patients  with copanlisib  and ibrutinib  at escalating  doses.

IRB PROTOCOL   
  
A maximum number  of 18 patients  will be enrolled  in this stage.  This will determine  the maximum  
tolerated  dose  and the recommended  phase  II dose.  
In the phase  II study,  the cohort  will expand  and accrue  patients  at the recommended  phase  II dose  
of copanlisib  and ibrutinib  determined  during  phase  I dose  escalation.  In a simon  two stage  mini- 
max design,  an initial  18 patients  will be enrolled,  inclusive  of 6 patients  treated  at MTD or RP2D  
from phase  I study,  in first stage.  If 5 or more  patients  have a complete  response  by 6 months,  then 
an additional  15 patients  will be enrolled  for a total accrual  of 33 patients.  
4.3 Intervention  
 
Treatment  will be with intravenous  copanlisib  on days 1, 8, 15 of 28 day cycles  and oral ibrutinib  
daily in 28 day cycles.  A cycle  is defined  as 28 days of therapy.  If patients  are in a CR by RECIL  
criteria,  copanlisib  will be held after 2 cycles  of combination  past a CR or minimum  of 6 cycles  of 
therapy.  Copanlisib  will be restarted  upon  radiographic  and pathologic  progression  of disease  (see 
Section  9.9). Patients  remain  on continuous  ibrutinib  if copanlisib  is held. It may then be restarted  
as clinically  indicated.  Therapy  will continue  until disease  progression,  intolerable  toxicities  or death  
with a maximum  duration  of treatment  of 36 cycles  not exceeding  36 months  on therapy.  
 
 
5.0     THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC  AGENTS  
 
5.1. Copanlisib  
 
Copanlisib,  also known  as BAY 80-6946,  is an intravenously -administered,  small-moleculeinhibitor 
of PI3K manufactured  by Bayer.  The copanlisib  IND will be cross  referenced  between  MSKCC  and 
Bayer.  IND approval  and activation  is pending  at MSKCC.  
Physical  Description  of Study  Drug(s):  Copanlisib  lyophilisate  60 mg 1.5 mL for injection  001 is a 
single  use container.  
Labeling:  Study  drug labels  will contain  information  to meet  the applicable  regulatory  requirements.  
The investigational  products  will be labeled  as open -label material.  
Preparation,  Handling,  and Storage:  
 
Copanlisib  is a lyophilized  preparation  filled in 6-mL injection  vials.  Due to the technically  required  
overfill  the total amount  is 68.4 mg Copanlisib  per vial. After reconstitution  with 4.4 mL of 0.9 % 
NaCl  solution  a total volume  of 4.55 mL is obtained.  The resulting  drug substance  concentration  is 
15 mg/mL  Copanlisib.  To obtain  the target  dose  of copanlisib  a volumes  of 2.0 - 4.0 mL has to be 
withdrawn  (Table  5-1). Withdraw  the required  amount  of the reconstituted  lyophilisate  with an 
unused  sterile  syringe.  Connect  the syringe  to the patient  infusion  bag with 100 mL 0.9 % NaCl  
solution.  Transfer  the required  amount  of the reconstituted  lyophilisate  into the bag.

9.0       TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN 
 
9.1. Study  Treatment 
 
The investigational  agents  to be used  in this study  are copanlisib  and ibrutinib.  Copanlisib  is given  
intravenously  on days 1, 8, and 15 of 28 day cycles.  Ibrutinib  is given  orally  every  day on 28 days 
cycles.  The maximum  duration  of treatment  is 36 cycles  not exceeding  36 months.  Dose  changes  
or interruptions  are allowed  per below  guidelines  and must  be recorded  appropriately.  
Study  personnel  will maintain  a log of all drugs  supplied  to the patient.  Drug  supplies  for each  
patient  will be inventoried  and accounted  for. Subjects  will be given  diary cards to complete  for the 
ibrutinib  taken  at home.  Subjects  must  bring  the diary cards  to the site on every  visit so study  site 
personnel  can verify  compliance.  
 
 
 
 
9.1.1  Copanlisib  administration:  
 
Copanlisib  is supplied  as lyophilized  preparation  in a 6-mL injection  vial. The total amount  of 
copanlisib,  BAY 80-6946,  per vial is 60 mg. The solution  for IV infusion  is obtained  after 
reconstitution  of the lyophilisate  with 0.9%  sodium  chloride  solution.  Please  refer to the Pharmacy  
Instructions  for detailed  instructions  for the reconstitution  of the lyophilisate  and for further  dilution  
of the reconstituted  solution.  Study  drug is administered  in a normal  saline  solution,  intravenously,  
over 1 h (or per MSK protocol).  No intravenous  glucose  preparations  should  be administered  on 
the days of infusion.  Dosing  is weekly  for the first 3 weeks  of a 28-day cycle  (on Days  1, 8, and 15), 
followed  by a 1-week  break  (i.e., no infusion  on Day 22). Patients  will be on 30 mg, 45 mg or 60 mg 
depending  on their dose  level.  
Laboratory  blood  tests  on day 1 of copanlisib  treatment  must  follow  the below  criteria:

Glucose  Monitoring for  copanlisib  administration  
Treatment – Cycle  1 
Cycle  1, Day 1 
The following  assessments  should  be performed  on Cycle  1, Day 1 before  receiving  study  
treatment  unless  otherwise  specified.  
• On Cycle  1 Day 1, patients  should  be fasting  for at least 8 h prior to the pre-dose  glucose  
measurement.  Fasting  glucose  should  be < 125 mg/dl  for non-diabetic  patients  or <160  
mg/dl  for diabetic  patients.  
• Glucose  will be measured  at 0 h (pre-dose)  and post dose  1 hour and 2 hours  after the end 
of copanlisib  infusion  (deviation  of  15 min is allowed).  Additional  measurements  to be 
performed  at the clinic  as clinically  indicated.  
NOTE:  Patients  should  be educated  on the signs  and symptoms  of hyperglycemia,  suchas  frequent  
urination,  increased  thirst,  blurred  vision,  headaches  and difficulty  concentrating  and must  report  
these  to the investigator  or their physician  immediately.  If patient  needs   to take a meal,  then 
glucose  test should  be taken  prior to meal  intake.  
 
 
Cycle  1 Day 8, Cycle  1 Day 15, and all subsequent  doses  
• Fasting  is not required  before  first glucose  measurement.  
o If patient  is fasting,  glucose  should  be <160  mg/dl  prior to copanlisib  infusion  
o If patient  is non-fasting,  glucose  should  be <200  mg/dL  prior to copanlisib  infusion  
• Glucose  will be measured  prior to and after the end of copanlisib  study  drug IV infusion  
(deviation  of  10 min is allowed,  except  for the pre-dose  measurement).  Patients  are not 
required  to be fasting  prior to pre-dose  glucose  measurement.

Blood  pressure  will be measured  every  5 – 10 minutes  prior to each  copanlisib  dose  (no more  than 
4 measurements)  until there  are two consecutive  results  < 150/90  mmHg.  If blood  pressure  is ≥ 
150/90  mmHg,  the investigator  can consider  a medical  intervention  or delaying  the infusion  of study  
drug.  The patient  should  rest for 5-10 minutes  before  blood  pressure  is recorded.  
On infusion  days,  blood  pressure  will be measured  at 0 h (pre-dose),  30 min (mid-infusion),  60 min 
(end of infusion),  and 1 h and 2 hours  after the end of infusion  
Note:  a window  of ±10 min is allowed  for all BP measurements  
 
 
Ibrutinib  administration:  
Ibrutinib  will be administered  once  daily continuously  until disease  progression,  intolerance,  or 
completion  of 36 cycles,  not exceeding  36 cycles  since  start of therapy  whichever  comes  first. 
Patients  will be instructed  to take 420 mg or 560 mg depending  on the treating  cohort.  
Ibrutinib  should  be administered  at about  the same  time each  day orally  with 8 ounces  or 
approximately  240 mL of water.  The drug should  be swallowed  intact  and subjects  should  not 
attempt  to crush  dissolve  the tablets  in water.  If a dose  is missed,  the dose  may be taken  as soon  
as possible  on the same  day with a return  to the normal  schedule  the following  day. Extra  tablets  
of ibrutinib  should  not be taken  to make  up for the missed  dose.  If a patient  vomits  the dose,  the 
dose  should  not be retaken.  On days when  patients  are receiving  copanlisib  and ibrutinib,  patients  
should  take their dose  of ibrutinib  in clinic  just prior to the copanlisib  infusion.  
 
 
9.2. Definitions  of dose  limiting  toxicity,  maximum   tolerated  dose,  and recommended  phase  
II dose  
A dose  limiting  toxicity  (DLT)  is defined  as any of the following  adverse  events  occurring  within  cycle  
1 (28 days).  A maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  is defined  as the highest  dose  studied  for which  the 
incidence  of DLT is less than 33%.  The recommended  phase  II dose  (RP2D)  is the dose  with clinical  
efficacy  without  major  toxicity.  
• Any AE resulting  in a dose  delay  of >7 consecutive  days within  the DLT period  based  on 
dose  modifications  in Table  9-6 
• Non hematologic  AE: 
o Hemorrhage  requiring  transfusion  or procedural  intervention,  intracranial  
hemorrhage,  intraocular  hemorrhage  of any grade  
o Grade  4 arterial  hypertension  
o Any Grade  ≥3 AE EXCEPT  noted  below  
▪ Grade  ≥ 3 nausea,  vomiting,  constipation  or diarrhea  persisting  for <48 hours  
▪ Grade  ≥3 rash or skin hypersensitivity  persisting  for <7 days 
▪ <7 days of Grade  ≥3 fatigue  
▪ <7 days of Grade  ≥ 3 edema  
▪ <7 days of post infusion  blood  glucose  >250mg/dL  despite  optimal  glucose  
management  or <2 days of blood  glucose  >500mg/dL  despite  optimal  
glucose  management

• Grade  3 (or 4) isolated  electrolyte  abnormalities  that resolve,  with or without  intervention,  to 
Grade  ≤ 2 in less than 72 hours  Hematologic  AE 
o Any Grade  4 neutropenia  lasting  more  than 7 consecutive  days

o Grade  4 thrombocytopenia  lasting  more  than 7 days or Grade  3 thrombocytopenia  
with evidence  of ≥ Grade  2 bleeding  
• Any Grade  5 toxicity  is considered  a DLT.  
 
9.3. Phase  I dose  escalation  phase  
 
Cohorts  of 3-6 patients  each  will be treated  with escalating  doses  of copanlisib  and ibrutinib  (Table  
9-2). If unforeseen  toxicities  are observed  in 2 patients  treated  at dose  level 1, the next cohort  will 
be treated  at dose  level -1.

• At least 2 patients  will be treated  at each  dose  level.  All patients  treated  at the preceding  
dose  level will be observed  at minimum  of 28 days (1 cycle)  before  dose  escalation  occurs.  
• Dose  escalation  will proceed  as follows:  
o If none  of the initial  3 patients  in a cohort  experiences  dose  limiting  toxicity  (DLT),  
then a new cohort  of 3 patients  will be treated  at the next higher  dose  level.  
o If one of 3 patients  in a cohort  experiences  DLT,  then up to an additional  3 patients  
will be treated  at the same  dose  level.  Escalation  will continue  if only one of the 6 
patients  experiences  a DLT.  
o In the event  that ≥2 of 3 patients,  or ≥2 of 6 patients  in the first cohort  experiences  a 
DLT related  to study drugs,  then the next cohort  of patients  will be treated  at a lower  
dose  level (dose  level -1) and no further  dose  escalation  will occur  in this step.  Three  
patients  will be enrolled  at this dose  level,  if 0 or 1 patients  experiences  a study  drug 
related  DLT,  a further  3 patients  will be enrolled  at this dose  level.  If overall  0 or 1 
patient  experiences  a DLT at this dose  level,  this dose  will be established  as 
copanlisib/  ibrutinib  maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD).  
o If ≥2 or more  patients  in the cohort  experience  DLT,  then the maximum  tolerated  
dose  (MTD)  will have been  exceeded,  and no further  copanlisib  and ibrutinib  dose  
escalation  will occur.  The previous  dose  will be considered  as the MTD.  
o If only 3 patients  were  treated  at the dose  level under  consideration  as the MTD,  
then up to an additional  3 patients  will be accrued.  If no more  than 1 of 6 patients  at 
that copanlisib  and ibrutinib  dose  level experiences  DLT,  than that dose  level will be 
confirmed  as the MTD.  If ≥2 or more patients  in that cohort  experience  DLT,  than 
the previous  dose  level will be studied  in the same  fashion.

The maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  is the highest  combination  drug dosage  not causing  medically  
unacceptable  DLT in ≥33%  (i.e. 2/6 patients)  in the first cycle  of treatment.  The recommended  
phase  II dose  (RP2D)  is the dose  balancing  clinical  efficacy  and toxicity.  
9.4. Phase  II dose  expansion  
 
Patients  will be enrolled  at the MTD of copanlisib  and ibrutinib  combination.  The safety  events  in 
the expansion  cohorts  will be reviewed  on an ongoing  basis  by the primary  investigator  and several  
stopping  rules are in place  to protect  patients  from excessive  toxicity  (Section  14). Based  on this 
review,  we may adjust  treating  dose  level to the RP2D.

may be skipped  without  being  considered  a protocol  deviation.  For all samples,  it is of importance  
that the actual  date and time of blood  sampling  are documented  in the eCRF  because  PK 
calculations  will be based  on the actual  sampling  times  relative  to dosing  times.

9.6. Concomitant  Medications  
 
9.6.1  Permitted  Concomitant  Therapy  
 
• Standard  therapies  for concurrent  medical  conditions  
• Treatment  with non-conventional  therapies  (for example  herbs  or acupuncture),  and 
vitamin/mineral  supplements  is acceptable  provided  that they do not interfere  with the study  
endpoints,  in the opinion  of the Investigator.  St John’s  Wort  is not permitted.  
• Bisphosphonates  
• Close  monitoring  is recommended  according  to standard  of care.  If either  of these  values  is 
above  the therapeutic  range,  the doses  should  be modified  and the assessments  should  be 
repeated  weekly  until it is stable.  
• Antiemetics:  Prophylactic  anti-emetics  may be administered  according  to standard  practice.  
The routine  use of standard  antiemetics,  including  steroids,  5-HT3 blockers,  such  as 
granisetron,  ondansetron,  or an equivalent  agent,  is allowed  as needed.  
• Palliative  and supportive  care for the other  disease -related  symptoms  and for toxicity  
associated  with treatment  will be offered  to all patients  in this trial. 
• Patients  may receive  palliative  and supportive  care for any underlying  disease  
• Palliative  irradiation  shall be permitted  provided  that: 
o In the opinion  of the investigator,  the patient  does not have progression  of disease.  
o The radiation  field does not encompass  a target  lesion  
o The  radiation   field  does  not  encompass   a  lung  field  (to  reduce   the  risk  for 
pneumonitis).  
• Low-dose  aspirin  (maximum  100 mg/day)  and low-dose  heparin  are permitted.  
• Patients  taking  narrow  therapeutic  index  medications  should  be monitored  proactively,  if 
these  medications  cannot  be avoided.  These  medications  may include  quinidine,  
cyclosporine,  and digoxin  
• Short  term systemic  corticosteroids  will be allowed  for the management  of acute  conditions  
• Use of neutrophil  growth  factors  (filgrastim  and pegfilgrastim)  is not permitted  in the dose  
escalation  phase  during  cycle  1 unless  a DLT has already  been  determined.  Neutrophil  
growth  factor  support  is allowed  in the dose  expansion  portion  of the study  to treat 
neutropenia  but not prophylactically.  
 
 
9.6.2  Prohibited  Concomitant  Therapy  
The following  medications  are prohibited  during  study  treatment  in the study  (see Table  9-5 
below):  
This list is not comprehensive  and is only meant  to be used  as a guide:  
 
• Strong  inhibitors  or inducers  of CYP3A4/5  
• Other  investigational  and antineoplastic  therapies  
• Anti-arrhythmic  therapy  other  than beta blockers  or digoxin  
• Ongoing  immunosuppressive  therapy  
• Concomitant  radiotherapy  (it is assumed  that radiation  would  be indicated  only in case of 
progression,  when  the patient  would  come  off study  medication  anyway)

9.6.3  Drug -drug  Interactions  
 
Guideline  for Use of CYP Inhibiting/Inducing   Drugs  
Both ibrutinib  and copanlisib  are metabolized  primarily  by CYP3A4.  Plasma  concentrations  of 
ibrutinib  and copanlisib  may be increased  from concomitant  use of strong  or moderate  CYP3A4  
inhibitors.  . Consequently,  strong  or moderate  CYP3A4  inhibitor  and inducers  should  be 
avoided.  Ibrutinib  and its major  metabolite  (dihydrodiol)  have been  shown,  in vitro, to be weak  
inhibitors  and inducers  of CYP450  isoenzymes.  Note that with the data available,  it is not 
possible  to confirm  whether  such  interactions  will occur  in patients.  Therefore,  investigators,  at 
their  discretion,   may  administer   concomitant   medications   known   to  be  metabolized   by

IRB PROTOCOL   
  
CYP3A4/5,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9  and CYP2C19.  The use of moderate  and strong   CYP3A  
inducers  and inhibitors  is strictly  prohibited  during  the DLT evaluation  period.  
During  phase  II, strong  inhibitors  of CYP3A  suchas ketoconazole,  indinavir,  nelfinavir,  ritonavir,  
saquinavir,  clarithromycin,  telithromycin,  itraconazole,  and nefazodone,  etc should  be avoided.  
If strong  CYP3A  inhibitors  cannot  be avoided,  consider  holding  ibrutinib  and copanlisib  while  on 
CYP3A  inhibitor  if it will be used  short -term.  Re-initiate  ibrutinib  and copanlisib  after 5 to 6 half- 
life washout  period  of the CYP3A  inhibitor . If concurrent  therapy  with strong  inhibitors  cannot  
be avoided,  reduce  the copanlisib  dose  to 45 mg. If antifungal  therapy  is required,  strong  
inhibitors  of CYP3A4,   including  ketoconazole,   itraconazole,  posaconazole,  and voriconazole  
should  be avoided.  Moderate  inhibitors  of CYP3A4,  such  as isavuconazonium  sulfate,  may be 
used.  If used  with a moderate  CYP3A4  inhibitor,  ibrutinib  dosing  should  be reduced  to 140 mg 
daily.  No dose  adjustment  to copanlisib  is needed.  Avoid  grapefruit  and Seville  oranges  during  
ibrutinib  treatment,  as these  contain  moderate  inhibitors  of CYP3A  (see Appendix  1). 
During  phase  II, strong  inducers  of CYP3A  such  as enzyme -inducing  anti-epileptics  
(carbamazepine,  phenytoin,  etc), rifampin,  and St. John’s  Wort  etc, should  be avoided.  Co- 
administration  of ibrutinib  with strong  CYP3A  inducers,  rifampin,  in healthy  subjects  decrease  
ibrutinib  plasma  concentrations  by approximately  10-fold. Consider  alternative  agents  with less 
CYP3A  induction.  If strong  CYP3A  inducers  cannot  be avoided,  consider  holding  ibrutinib  and 
copanlisib  while  on CYP3A  inducer  if it will be used  short -term.  Re-initiate  ibrutinib  and 
copanlisib  after 5 to 6 half-life washout  period  of the CYP3A  inducer .  Additionally,  corticosteroid  
doses  more  than 4mg oral daily of dexamethasone -equivalent  (>26mg  prednisone)  may induce  
CYP3A  enzyme,  so need  to be discussed  with investigators.  
A list of common,  moderate  to strong,  CYP3A  inhibitors  or inducers  is provided  in the 
appendices;  a comprehensive  list of inhibitors,  inducers,  and substrates  may be found  at  
http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main -table/ . This website  is continually  revised  and 
should  be checked  frequently  for updates  (Appendix  1). 
Sensitive  substrates  of CYP3A  should  be used  with caution.  A comprehensive  list of sensitive  
substrates  of CYP3A  could  be found  on FDA website:

Concomitant  Use of Antiplatelet   Agents  and Anticoagulants  
Ibrutinib  may increase  the risk of hemorrhage  in patients  receiving  antiplatelet  or anticoagulant  
therapies.  The mechanism  for this bleeding  is not well understood.  
Warfarin  or vitamin  K antagonists  should  not be administered  concomitantly  with ibrutinib  or 
copanlisib.  Supplements  such as fish oil and vitamin  E preparations  should  be avoided.  Use 
ibrutinib  with caution  in subjects  requiring  other  anticoagulants  or medications  that  inhibit  
platelet  function.  
Subjects  receiving  antiplatelet  agents  in conjunction  with ibrutinib  should  be observed  closely  
for any signs  of bleeding  or bruising  and ibrutinib  should  be withheld  in the event  of any bleeding  
events.

Subjects  requiring  the initiation  of anticoagulation  therapy  (other  than warfarin  or a vitamin  K 
antagonist,  which  should  be avoided)  during  the course  of the study  should  have treatment  with 
ibrutinib  held, the PI should  be contacted,  and ibrutinib  should  not be restarted  until the subject  
is clinically  stable.  Subjects  should  be observed  closely  for signs  and symptoms  of bleeding.  
Subjects  were  excluded  from participation  in ibrutinib  Phase  2 and 3 studies  if they required  
warfarin  or other  vitamin  K antagonists.  Therefore,  ibrutinib  should  not be administered  
concomitantly  with warfarin  or other  vitamin  K antagonists.  Ibrutinib  should  be used  with caution  
in patients  requiring  other  anticoagulants  or medications  that inhibit  platelet  function.  Patients  
receiving  antiplatelet  agents  in conjunction  with ibrutinib  should  be observed  closely  for any 
signs  of bleeding  or bruising  and ibrutinib  should  be withheld  in the event  of any bleeding  events.  
Supplements  such  as fish oil and vitamin  E preparations  should  be avoided.  Patients  with 
congenital  bleeding  diathesis  have not been  studied.  
9.7. Dose  Continuation,  Modification  and Interruption  
 
Subjects  will be evaluated  for AEs at each  visit with the NCI CTCAE  v5.0 used  as a guide  for the 
grading  of severity.  Prior to completion  of cycle  1 in both dose  escalation  or dose  expansion  phase,  
treatment  with either  ibrutinib,  copanlisib  or both may be interrupted  for ≤ 7 days for any reason  and 
then resumed  at the same  dose.  If patients  take less than 2 infusions  of copanlisib  or less than 14 
days of ibrutinib  during  the intended  dose  of cycle 1, they will be excluded  from the DLT analysis  
and replaced.  However  if a patient  takes  less than 14 days of  the intended  dose  of cycle 1  due to 
a DLT,  they will be included  in the DLT analysis  and not replaced.  After completion  of cycle  1, 
study  drugs  (either  ibrutinib,  copanlisib ) may be interrupted  for ≤ 28 days for any reason  and then 
resumed  at same or reduced  dose.  The investigator  may remove  any patient  from study  for any 
toxicity  if the investigator  believes  it is in the best interest  of the patient  to discontinue  study  
treatment.  
Intrapatient  dose  reduction  will not be allowed  during  cycle  1 unless  a DLT has occurred  and been  
counted.  This is in order  to accurately  determine  the safe and tolerable  dose  of copanlisib  when  
used  in combination  with ibrutinib.  Dose  reductions  may be made  to ibrutinib  and/or  copanlisib  
during  cycles  2 and beyond.  If a toxicity  can be ascribed  to a specific  study  drug,  then that drug 
may be dose  modified  while  the non-offending  drug may be maintained.  Whether  to dose  modify  
ibrutinib  or copanlisib  is at the discretion  of the treating  physician.  
If the patient  experiences  unacceptable  toxicity  that fails to resolve  after a maximum  dose  delay  of 
28 consecutive  days,  then the patient  should  be discontinued  from the study  treatments.  In cases  
of treatment  delays  from reactivation  of CMV,  treatment  delays  can be extended  for up to 2 months.  
In exceptional  situations,  if the patient  is clearly  benefiting  from the study  treatment  (i.e. stable  
disease  or better)  and in the opinion  of the investigator  no safety  concerns  are present,  the patient  
may remain  on the study  treatment.  Patients  who discontinue  from study  for a study  related  adverse  
event  or an abnormal  laboratory  value  must  be followed  as described  in Section  10. 
Each patient  is allowed  a maximum  of two dose  reduction  of each  study  drug.  Dose  reduction  of 
copanlisib  or ibrutinib  indicates  treatment  at the next lower  dose  of copanlisib  or ibrutinib  based  on 
Table  9-6. If after treatment  interruption,  resolution  of toxicity,  and treatment  resumption  at same  
dose,  the subject  presents  with the same  toxicity  at the same  severity,  then the next treatment  re-

initiation  must  resume  at the next lower  dose  level irrespective  of duration.  A patient  must 
discontinue  therapy  if after therapy  is resumed  at a lower  dose,  the same  toxicity  recurs  with the 
same  or worse  severity.  Copanlisib  and ibrutinib  dose  modification  guidelines  for specific  toxicities  
are outlined  in Table  9-7.

Copanlisib  60 mg 45 mg 30 mg 
Ibrutinib  560 mg daily 420 mg daily 280 mg daily 
*Dose  reduction  starts  from the treating  dose.  
 
Dose  escalation  is allowed  after the DLT period  for ibrutinib  to the FDA approved  dose  levels  of 560 
mg. However,  patients  will only be allowed  to escalate  to this dose  once  the DLT evaluation  period  
for Dose  Level  1 has passed  and the dose  will not exceed  what has been  deemed  the MTD in other  
patients.  There  will be no intrapatient  dose  escalation  of copanlisib.  Once  a dose  reduction  for 
copanlisib  of a patient  has occurred,  the dose  level may not be re-escalated  during  subsequent  
treatment  cycles.  
The sections  below  describe  dose  reduction  steps  for patients  enrolled  in the expansion  phase  of 
the study.  For patients  in the dose  expansion  phase,  the dose  must  be held per these  guidelines

9.8. Management  of Toxicities  or Procedures  
Reproductive  Toxicity  
Copanlisib  may cause  embryo -fetal harm.  Female  patients  of childbearing  potential  are advised  to 
use highly  effective  contraception  (contraception  with a failure  rate <1% per year)  during  and up to 
1 month  after treatment  with copanlisib.  Advise  male  patients  with female  partners  of childbearing  
potential  to use highly  effective  contraception  in addition  to a barrier  method  of contraception  during  
and up to 1 month  after treatment  with copanlisib.  
Based  on findings  in animals,  ibrutinib  can cause  fetal harm  when  administered  to a pregnant  
woman.  Administration  of ibrutinib  to pregnant  rats and rabbits  during  the period  of organogenesis  
caused  embryofetal  toxicity  including  malformations  at exposures  that were  2-20 times  higher  than 
those  reported  in patients  with hematologic  malignancies.  Advise  women  to avoid  becoming  
pregnant  while  taking  ibrutinib  and for 1 month  after cessation  of therapy.  If this drug is used  during  
pregnancy  or if the patient  becomes  pregnant  while  taking  this drug,  the patient  should  be apprised  
of the potential  hazard  to a fetus.  
Women  of child-bearing  potential  who are sexually  active  must  use highly  effective  contraception  
during  the study and for 1 month  after the last dose  of ibrutinib  or copanlisib.  Men who are sexually  
active  must  use highly  effective  contraception  during  the study  and for 1 month  after the last dose  
of ibrutinib  or copanlisib.  Subjects  should  promptly  notify  the investigator  if they, or their partner,  
become  pregnant  during  this period.  If a female  subject  becomes  pregnant  during  the treatment  
period,  she must  discontinue  ibrutinib  and copanlisib  immediately.  Pregnancy  in a female  subject  
or a male  subject’s  partner  must  be reported  in the samemanne r as a SAE.  Womenare considered  
post-menopausal  and not of child-bearing  potential  if they have had 12 months  of natural  
(spontaneous)  amenorrhea  with an appropriate  clinical  profile  (e.g. age appropriate,  history  of 
vasomotor  symptoms)  or have had surgical  bilateral  oophorectomy  (with or without  hysterectomy)  
at least six weeks  ago. For women  with therapy -induced  amenorrhea,  oophorectomy  or serial  
measurements  of FSH and/or  estradiol  are needed  to ensure  postmenopausal  status.  
Guidelines  for Ibrutinib  and Copanlisib  Management  with Surgeries  or Procedures  
Ibrutinib  may increase  risk of bleeding  with invasive  procedures  or surgery  (including  excisional  
lymph  node  biopsies).  The following  guidance  should  be applied  to the use of ibrutinib  in the 
perioperative  period  for patients  who require  surgical  intervention  or an invasive  procedure  while  
receiving  ibrutinib:  
Minor  Surgical  Procedures  
For minor  procedures  (such  as a central  line placement,  needle  biopsy,  thoracentesis,  or 
paracentesis)  ibrutinib  should  be held for at least 3 days prior to the procedure  and should  not be 
restarted  for at least 3 days after the procedure.

Page  36 of 65 
MEMORIAL  SLOAN  KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB PROTOCOL   
  
 
For bone  marrow  biopsies  that are performed  while  the subject  is on ibrutinib  or copanlisib,  it is not 
necessary  to hold ibrutinib  or copanlisib  for these  procedures.  
Major  Surgical  Procedures  
 
For any surgery  or invasive  procedure  requiring  sutures  or staples  for closure,  ibrutinib  should  be 
held at least 7 days prior to the intervention  and should  be held at least 7 days after the procedure  
and restarted  at the discretion  of the investigator  when the  surgical  site is reasonably  healed  without  
serosanguineous  drainage  or the need  for drainage  tubes.  For emergency  procedures,  ibrutinib  
should  be held after the procedure  until the surgical  site is reasonably  healed,  for at least 7 days 
after the urgent  surgical  procedure  or the discretion  of the investigator.  
Copanlisib  may be interrupted  at the discretion  of the treating  physician  with surgical  procedures.  
 
Guidelines  for Second  Primary  Malignancies  
 
Other  malignancies  (range,  5 to 14%)  including  non-skin carcinomas  (range,  1 to 3%) have 
occurred  in patients  treated  with ibrutinib.  The most  frequent  second  primary  malignancy  was non- 
melanoma  skin cancer  (range,  4 to 11 %). All new malignant  tumors  including  solid tumors,  skin 
malignancies  and hematologic  malignancies  will be reported  for the duration  of study  treatment  and 
collected  for 30 days post study  treatment.  
Management  of lymphocytosis   and leukostasis  associated  with ibrutinib:  
 
Similar  to other  agents  targeting  B-cell receptor  signaling,  transient  lymphocytosis  is a 
pharmacodynamic  effect  of ibrutinib,  in which  the inhibition  of BTK-mediated  cellular  homing  and 
adhesion  results  in a mobilization  of tumor  cells to the peripheral  blood.12  
Upon  initiation  of ibrutinib,  a temporary  increase  in lymph ocyte  counts  (i.e., ≥ 50% increase  from 
baseline  and above  absolute  lymphocyte  count  of 5,000/MCL)  occurred  in 33% of patients  in the 
MCL study.  The onset  of isolated  lymphocytosis  occurs  during  the first few weeks  of ibrutinib  
therapy  and resolves  by a median  of 8 weeks.  High number  of circulating  malignant  cells 
(>400,000/mcL)  may confer  increased  risk; these  patients  should  be closely  monitored.  Patients  
with MCL who develop  lymphocytosis  greater  than 400,000/mcL  have developed  intracranial  
hemorrhage,  lethargy,  gait instability,  and headache.  However,  some of these  cases  were  in the 
setting  of disease  progression.  Administer  supportive  care such  as hydration  and/or  leukapheresis  
as indicated.  This observed  transient  lymphocytosis  is usually  not associated  with an adverse  event  
and should  not be considered  progressive  disease  in the absence  of other  clinical  findings.  
Management  of hematologic  toxicity  associated  with copanlisib  
 
Neutropenia  and febrile  neutropenia  are listed  in the current  version  of investi gator’s  brochure  for 
copanlisib  as expected  adverse  events.  Please  refer to Table  9-7 for dose  modifications  based  on 
hematologic  toxicity.  If the guidelines  are not followed,  the rationale  for other  measures  is to be 
documented  in detail  in the patient’s  medical  record.

Non-infectious  pneumonitis  has been  associated  with PI3K inhibitors.  The investigator  is requested  
to differentiate  between  non-infectious  pneumonitis,  and infectious  pneumonitis  (viral,  bacterial,  
fungal),  aspiration  pneumonitis,  or other  pneumonitis  clearly  not due to a potential  hypersensitivity  
reaction  to the copanlisib  infusion;  and provide  the basis  for his/her  assessment  that it is infectious  
or other,  as appropriate.  The investigator  is requested  to report  with the most  specific  clinical  terms  
to describe  the condition,  not simple  “pneumonitis”.  
In the event  of suspected  non-infectious  pneumonitis,  modify  copanlisib  treatment  as per guidelines  
in Table  9-7 and Table  9-8. If the guidelines  are not followed,  the rationale  for other  measures is to 
be documented  in detail  in the patient’s  medical  record.

Guidelines  for the treatment  of copanlisib  induced  arterial  hypertension  
 
No dose  should  be given  if blood  pressure  is ≥ 150/90  mmHg.  Antihypertensive  medication  may be 
given  to control  the increased  blood  pressure.  Dosing  can proceed  on the scheduled  day if there  
are at least 2 consecutive  measurements  <150/90  mmHg.  Otherwise  dosing  must  be delayed.

IRB PROTOCOL   
  
 
If drug-related  arterial  hypertension  (post -dose  blood  pressure  of CTCAE  Grade  3 or ≥ 160/100  
mmHg)  is not manageable  with optimal  antihypertensive  treatment,  the dose  for the subsequent  
copanlisib  administrations  may be reduced  by 1 or 2 dose  levels  at the investigator’s  discretion.  
Patients  with a post-dose  blood  pressure  that may have life-threatening  consequences  (e.g. 
malignant  arterial  hypertension,  transient  or permanent  neurologic  deficit,  hypertensive  crisis)  must 
permanently  discontinue  the study  drug.  Please  see table 9-7. 
Treatment of blood  pressure  increases  associated with copanlisib  
 
It is important  that patients  with pre-existing  arterial  hypertension  adhere  to their regular  medication  
schedule  and take their usual  doses on the days of study  drug infusion.  
The management  of acute  blood  pressure  increases  following  copanlisib  will need  to be 
individualized  for each  patient,  but experience  in Phase  I has suggested  the benefit  of 
dihydropyridine  calcium  channel  blockers  (i.e. amlodipine,  felodipine).  Topical  nitrates  should  also 
be considered.  Verapamil  and diltiazem(non -dihydropyridine  calcium  channel  blockers  and 
moderate  inhibitors  of CYP3A4)  should  be used  with caution  due to a potential  CYP3A4  interaction.  
In general,  it is advisable  for sites to be prepared,  so that antihypertensive  medication  is readily  
available  in case  of need.  
In the event  of the occurrence  of arterial  hypertension  ≥ 150/90  mmHg  during  infusion  of copanlisib  
at any cycle,  antihypertensive  treatment  is suggested  as indicated  in Table  9-7. In the event  of the 
occurrence  of CTCAE  Grade  3 arterial  hypertension  (≥ 160/100  mmHg)  during  infusion  of 
copanlisib,  the infusion  should  be interrupted  and antihypertensive  treatment  as suggested  above  
is administered.  Infusion  can be resumed  when  blood  pressure  has returned  to <150/90  mmHg.  
Guidelines  for the monitoring  and treatment  of copanlisib  induced  hyperglycemia  
 
Hyperglycemia  is a common  side effect  of PI3K and also mTOR  inhibitors.  Hyperglycemia  is often  
infusion -related  and is dose -dependent.  Transient  increase  of glucose  levels  have been  observed  
in somepatients. Regular  monitoring  of FPG to identify  early hyperglycemia  and prevent  acute/sub - 
acute  complications  is important.  Caution  is warranted  for patients  with history  of DM, or taking  
corticosteroids,  or with other  severe  medical  conditions  (e.g. infections),  or patients  who show  
potential  acute  signs  suchas  poly-nocturia,  polydipsia,  confusion,  etc. Hyperglycemia  management  
guidance  includes  patient  education  and dietetic  measures/life -style changes  as well as appropriate  
anti-diabetic  medications  as per investigator’s  decision  and/or  local guidelines.  
Oral anti-diabetics  such  as metformin  should  be considered  for sustained  and more  severe  
hyperglycemia  (other  drugs  as appropriate).  Provided  hyperglycemia  is asymptomatic  and there  
are no acute  complications,  sufficient  time should  be given  to install  optimal  management  (e.g. up 
titrate  metformin,  addition  of a second  oral anti-diabetic  agent  to be considered  as needed,  etc.).  
Patients  with history  of DM, management  should  take prior anti-DM treatments  into account.  Note 
that some  oral anti-diabetic  are CYP3A  inducers  or inhibitors  and may be prohibited  (see Appendix  
1 for more  details).  Patients  who develop  Grade  3 or 4 or symptomatic hyperglycemia  should  be 
managed  urgently  as per standard  clinical  practice,  with the goal of stabilizing  glycemic  control  
within  24 hours.  More  guidance  on dose  reductions  and interruptions  is provided  in Table  9-7.

Recommendations  on me al timing  on infusion  days  
Caloric  intake  and timing  recommendations  for diabetic  patients  who require  insulin  treatment  prior 
to the infusion  at any cycle  visit should  be managed  by the investigator  based  on consultation  with 
treating  physician  or diabetes/endocrinologist  physician.  
Cycle  1 Day 1 
Fasting  is required  before  the first glucose  measurement  on date of infusion.  
 
Subsequent  dosing  beyond  Cycle  1 Day 1: 
Fasting  is not required  before  the first glucose  measurement.  
 
Management  of transient  post-infusion  glucose  increases  that can occur  with copanlisib  
study  treatment  
Mild to moderate  asymptomatic  increases  of blood  glucose  may occur  with copanlisib  infusion,  and 
with larger  increases  potentially  occurring  post-prandially.

Guidelines  for the Management  of Ibrutinib  and Copanlisib  induced  stomatitis/oral  mucositis  
 
General  guidance  and management  include  patient  awareness  and early intervention.  
Evaluation  for herpes  virus or fungal  infection  should  be considered.  
Patients  should  be informed  about  the possibility  of developing  mouth  ulcers/  oral mucositis  and 
instructed  to report  promptly  any signs  or symptoms  to their physician,  Patients  should  be educated  
about  good  oral hygiene,  instructed  to avoid  spicy/acidic/salty  foods,  and should  follow  the following  
guidelines:  
• For mild toxicity  (grade  1), use conservative  measures  such  as non-alcoholic  mouth  wash  
or salt water  (0.9%)  mouth  wash  several  times  a day until resolution.  
• For more  severe  toxicity  (grade  2 in which  case  patients  have pain but are able to maintain  
adequate  oral alimentation,  or grade  3 in whichcase patients  cannot  maintain  adequate  oral 
alimentation),  the suggested  treatments  are topical  analgesic  mouth  treatments  (i.e., local 
anesthetics  such  as benzocaine,  butyl aminobenzoate,  tetracaine  hydrochloride,  menthol,  
or phenol)  with or without  topical  corticosteroids,  such  as triamcinolone  oral paste  0.1%  
(Kenalog  in Orabase®),  or as per local practice.  
• Agents  containing  alcohol,  hydrogen  peroxide,  iodine,  and thyme  derivatives  may tend to 
worsen  mouth  ulcers.  It is preferable  to avoid  these  agents.  
Antifungal  agents  should  be avoided  unless  a fungal  infection  is diagnosed  as they may interfere  
with copanlisib  metabolism.

Total  cholesterol,  LDL and triglycerides  will be tested  only at with fasting  labs on Cycle  1 Day 1 and 
non-fasting  labs on Day 1 of every  even cycle  starting  from Cycle  2, and at the EOT visit. If lipids  
are abnormal  with non-fasting  labs, a repeat  fasting  lipid panel  is recommended.  As lipids  are 
monitored  for the duration  of this study  it is recommended  to treat significant  deviations  from normal  
range  with standard  interventions  and therapy  in standard  doses  according  to local  medical  
practice.  Goals  of therapy  are to keep fasting  triglycerides  < 300 mg/dL  and low-density  lipoproteins  
(LDL)  < 190 mg/dL  (lower  LDL depending  on cardiovascular  risk) in patients  with a life expectancy  
>1 year.  The goals  for fasting  triglycerides  can be raised  to < 500 mg/dL  for patients  with life 
expectancy  <1 year.  Although  there  is a paucity  of data on the effects  of hyperlipidemia  and cancer  
outcomes,  these  goals  have been  chosen  to decrease  risk of established  complications  of 
hypertriglyceridemia  (pancreatitis)  and hypercholesterolemia  (cardiovascular  events).  
Guidelines  for the  treatment  of copanlisib  or ibrutinib  induced  diarrhea  
 
The investigator  should  consider/investigate  potential  concomitant  medication,  food or comorbidity  
driven  causes  of diarrhea  (including  infectious  causes)  and remedy  these  causes  if possible  (e.g. 
discontinuation  of concomitant  medication,  dietary  modification,  treatment  of comorbidity).  
The patient  should  be monitored  for signs  of dehydration  and instructed  to take preventive  
measures  against  dehydration  as soon  as diarrhea  occurs.  Concomitant  medication  for the 
treatment  of diarrhea  should  be considered,  as per local practice  and best investigator’s  judgment  
and may consist  for example,  as per “the recommended  guidelines  for the treatment  of cancer  
treatment -induced  diarrhea” [38], of loperamide  given  at a standard  dose  (e.g. initial  administration  
of 4mg,  then 2mg every  4 hours,  maximum  of 16 mg/day),  along  with oral hydration  and dietetic  
measures  could  be considered  for Grade  1-2 diarrhea.  More  severe  diarrhea  should  be treated  
appropriately  according  to investigator  discretion,  including  for example  IV fluids.  
Dose  modification  of copanlisib  or ibrutinib  in case  of treatment  related  diarrhea  should  follow  the 
guidelines  presented  above  for other  non-hematological  adverse  events.  
 
 
Guidelines  for the treatment  of ibrutinib  or copanlisib  induced  skin toxicity  
 
Skin toxicity  is a class -effect  observed  with both ibrutinib  and PI3Ki/mTORi  agents.  Close  
monitoring  of potential  skin reactions  will be performed  at each  planned  visit and will be reported  
as adverse  event.  The most  frequent  skin adverse  events  reported  are: maculopapular  rash (only 
a minority  present  acneiform  rash);  pruritus  and dry skin. The onset  is typically  within  the first 2 
months  of treatment  start and is reversible  with adequate  co-medication  and treatment  interruption  
if needed.  Photographs  of a skin rash event  as well as skin biopsy  are recommended,  if possible.  
According  to the investigators  discretion,  a paired  skin biopsy  could  be obtained  (from  both an 
affected  and an unaffected  skin area for local histopathology  assessment)  to further  assess  rash if 
clinically  appropriate.

• Topical  steroids  of moderate  potency  (face  and folds):  triamcinolone  0.025%;  clometasone  
0.05%  (< 8 weeks  continuously),  for mild and moderate  rashes.  
• Topical  steroids  of high potency  (trunk/extremities):  fluocinonide  0.05%;  clobetasol  0.05%  
cream  or spray  (< 8 weeks  continuously),  for mild and moderate  rashes.  
• Oral antihistamines  (sedating,  evening):  diphenhydramine  25 to 50mg  t.i.d; hydroxizine  
25mg  tid or q.i.d; 
• Oral antihistamines  (non-sedating,  day time):  fexofenadine  180mg  q.d. or 60mg  tid (monitor  
the use of this class  of drugs  since  skin toxicity  has also been  reported)  
• Oral corticosteroids:  prednisone  0.5mg/kg  or equivalent  up to 2 weeks  of treatment  
• In caseof  mild acneiform  rashes  topical  antibiotics:  clindamycin  1% to 2%; erythromycin  1% 
to 2% (gel or solution  formulation  can be used,  ointments  cannot  be used);  metronidazole  
1%; silver  sulphadiazine.  
• For more  severe  acneiform  rashes  oral antibiotics:  doxycycline  100mg  B.I.D.;  minocycline  
100mg  B.I.D.;  oxytetracycline  500mg  B.I.D.  for 6 weeks  can be considered.  If infection  
suspected  (yellow  crusts,  purulent  discharge,  painful  skin/nares),  then switch  to broad  
spectrum/gram  negative  antibiotics;  consider  skin swab  for bacterial  culture.  
• Topical  antipruritics  (pramoxine  1%, doxepin  5% cream)  applied  twice  daily 
• For severe  pruritus  GABA  Agonists:  Gabapentin  300mg  every  8 hours,  or pregabalin  50 to 
75 mg every  8 hours  (to adjust  of renal  impairment)  can be considered.  Dose  should  be 
adjusted  depending  on patient’s  clinical  condition  beware  of potential  and common  side 
effects  observed  with GABA  agonists  such  as: somnolence,  dizziness  (both  drugs)  and 
peripheral  edema  (Gabapentin)  among  others  AEs. 
 
 
Dry skin has been  reported,  it is recommended  that patients  with dry skin use mild and fragrance  
free soaps  and detergents.  According  to the severity  and BSA extension  patients  may apply  mild 
moisturizers,  ammonium  lactate  cream  12% or salicylic  acid cream  6% B.I.D.  
Patients  should  be advised  to take measures  to protect  themselves  from direct  exposure  to sunlight,  
including  regular  use of sunscreen  (factor  20 at least),  wearing  of sunglasses,  using  of hats,  and 
protective  clothes  when  outdoors.  
Guidelines  for the management  of ibrutinib  induced  hemorrhage  
 
Fatal  bleeding  events  have occurred  in patients  treated  with ibrutinib.  Bleeding  events  (subdural  
hematoma,  gastrointestinal  bleeding,   hematuria  and post procedural  hemorrhage)  have occurred  
in up to 6% of patients.  Bleeding  events  of any grade,  including  bruising  and petechiae,  occurred  
in approximately  half of patients  treated  with ibrutinib.  The mechanism  for the bleeding  events  is 
not well understood.  Ibrutinib  may increase  the risk of hemorrhage  in patients  receiving  antiplatelet  
or anticoagulant  therapies.  Consider  the benefit -risk of withholding  ibrutinib  for at least 3 to 7 days 
pre and post- surgery  depending  upon  the type of surgery  and the risk of bleeding.  If bleeding  
diathesis  occurs,  consider  platelet  transfusions  to reverse  the inhibition  of platelet  adhesion  and 
collagen  induced  platelet  aggregation  from ibrutinib[39].

Cytomegalovirus  (CMV)  reactivation  and Pneumocystis  pneumonia  (PCP)  have been  observed  in 
patients  treated  with other  PI3K inhibitors  suchas  idelalisib.  Patients  will undergo  CMV  PCR  testing  
every  cycle.  Patients  should  be placed  on prophylaxis  for PCP pneumonia  unless  there  is a medical  
contraindication.  
9.9. Criteria  to Resume  Treatment after  Complete  Response:  
 
For subjects  who stop copanlisib  after achieving  a complete  response,  copanlisib  may be restarted  
upon  radiographic  and pathologic  progression  of disease.  Subjects  may resume  treatment  if any 
drug-related  AE(s)  resolve  to Grade  ≤1 or baseline  value , with the following  exceptions:  
• Subjects  may resume  treatment  in the presence  of Grade  2 fatigue  
• Subjects  who have  not experienced  a Grade   3 or 4 drug-related   skin AE  may resume  
treatment  in the presence  of Grade  2 skin toxicity  
• Drug -related  pulmonary  toxicity,  diarrhea,  or colitis,  must  have resolved  to baseline  before  
treatment  is resumed.  
• Drug -related   endocrinopathies    adequately    controlled   with  only   physiologic    hormone  
replacement  may resume  treatment  
 
Patients  must  also meet  the following  criteria:  
 
• Investigator   assessed  clinical  benefit  
• Tolerance  of study  treatment  
• Stable  performance  status  
• Repeat  treatment  with copanlisib  and ibrutinib  will not delay  an imminent  intervention   to 
prevent  serious  complications  of disease  progression  (eg CNS metastasis)  
• Participant  provides  written  informed  consent  prior to receiving  additional  copanlisib  and 
ibrutinib.  
 
A radiographic  assessment  with FDG -PET/CT  or PET-MRI should  be performed  within  6-10 weeks  
of re-initiating  treatment  to assess  response.  
 
 
10.0   EVALUATION DURING  TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
 
10.1.  General  requirements  
 
Evaluations  during  this period  are per Table  10-1. 
 
10.2.  Treatment period  
 
Patients  will receive  study  treatments  copanlisib  and ibrutinib  until disease  progression,  
unacceptable  toxicity  or until other  discontinuation  criteria  are met, whichever  come  first. Maximum  
duration  of treatment  is 36 cycles  not exceeding  36 months.

Patients  will follow  the visit schedule  as per Table  10-1. Permitted  visit windows  for assessments  
within  the treatment  period  and at efficacy follow -up visits  are included  in the table.  If copanlisib  is 
held based  on achievement  of a complete  response,  patient  visits  will be every  2 cycles  during  C1- 
C6, every  3 cycles  during  C7-C12, every  4 cycles  during  C13-36. 
Information  on drug exposure  will be collected  on the Dosage  Administration  Record  eCRF.  
Concomitant  medications/significant  non-drug therapies  prior to start (≤ 28 days)  and after start of 
study  treatment  will be recorded  on the appropriate  eCRFs.  
Compliance  will be assessed by the investigator  and/or  study  personnel  at each  visit using  box 
counts  and information  provided  by the caregiver.  
10.3.  End of treatment  visit including  premature  withdrawal  and study  safety  followup  
 
Patients  will continue  study  treatment  until disease  progression,  until any of the study’s  
discontinuation  criteria  are met, or a maximum  treatment  period  of 36 cycles,  not exceeding  36 
months  (Section  13). Patients  who discontinue  study  treatment  or at completion  therapy  should  be 
scheduled  for an End-of-Treatment  visit within  7 days from treatment  discontinuation  or as early as 
possible  per patient’s  convenience  at which  time all of the assessments listed  for the EOT visit will 
be performed.  For details  of assessments,  refer to Table  10-1. An End of Treatment  eCRF  page  
should  be completed,  giving  the date and reason  for discontinuation  of study  treatment.  Patients  
will have an additional  follow  up 1 month  after last dose.  
If a patient  withdrawal  occurs,  or if the patient  fails to return  for visits,  the investigator  must 
determine  the primary  reason  for a patient’s  premature  withdrawal  from the study  and record  this 
information  on the End of Treatment  eCRF  page.  
Patients  will be assessed  for any adverse  events  30 days,  +/- 7 days,  from the last dose  of either  
study  drug or until new therapy  is initiated,  whichever  comes  first. 
10.4.  Correlative  studies  
 
Patients  consented  on this trial will have tumor  samples  analyzed  for genomic  alterations  via next 
generation  targeted  sequencing.  Optional  post treatment  biopsy  will be obtained  to compare  the 
differences  in genomic  alterations  prior to treatment  and post treatment.  In addition,  circulating  
tumor  DNA and circulating  tumor  RNA samples  will be collected  throughout  treatment  to serially  
assess  the genomic  profile  of treated  patients.  
Gene  sequencing  will be performed  in the CLIA  certified  Molecular  Diagnostics  Service  laboratory,  
a division  of the MSKCC  Pathology  Department,  using  IMPACT -Heme  (Integrated  Mutation  
Profiling  for Actionable  Cancer  Targets  Hematology  Panel)  with paired  tumor  and normal  tissue  
samples, or a custom pane l of gene s depend ing on baseline IMPACT-Heme results. IMPACT 
provides  full exon coverage  of 410 cancer  related  genes  including  CARD11,  MYD88,  PIK3CA,  BTK,  
and can be used  to detect  base  substitutions,  small  indels,  copy number  alterations  and select  gene  
re-arrangements.  In some  cases,  the Molecular  Diagnostic  Service  will utilize  an additional  assay,  
such  as Sanger  Sequencing,  B cell clonality,  or fluorescence  in situ hybridization  (FISH),  to confirm  
specific  results  from these  multiplexed  assays.  We will assess  for the following:

11.0   TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
11.1.  Adverse Event 
 
11.1.1.  Definitions  and reporting  
 
An adverse  event  is defined  as the appearance  of (or worsening  of any pre-existing)  undesirable  
sign(s),  symptom(s),  or medical  condition(s)  that occur  after patient’s  signed  informed  consent  has 
been  obtained.  Abnormal  laboratory  values  or test results  occurring  after informed  consent  constitute  
adverse  events  only if they induce  clinical  signs  or symptoms,  are considered  clinically  significant,  
require  therapy  (e.g. hematologic  abnormality  that requires  transfusion  or hematological  stem  cell 
support),  or require  changes  in study  medication(s).  
Adverse  events  that begin  or worsen  after informed  consent  should  be recorded  in Medidata.  
Conditions  that were  already  present  at the time of informed  consent  should  be recorded  in the Medical  
History  in Medidata.  Adverse  event  monitoring  should  be continued  for at least 30 days following  the 
last dose  of study  treatment  or until initiation  of new therapy,  whichever  comes  first. Adverse  events  
(including  lab abnormalities  that constitute  AEs)  should  be described  using  a diagnosis  whenever  
possible,  rather  than individual  underlying  signs  and symptoms.  When  a clear  diagnosis  cannot  be 
identified,  each  sign or symptom  should  be reported  as a separate  Adverse  Event.  
Adverse  events  will be assessed  according  to the Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  
(CTCAE)  version  5.0. If CTCAE  grading  does not exist for an adverse  event,  the severity  of mild, 
moderate,  severe,  and life-threatening,  corresponding  to Grades  1 - 4, will be used.  CTCAE  Grade  5 
(death)  will not be used  in this study;  rather,  information  about  deaths  will be collected  though  a Death  
form.  
The occurrence  of adverse  events  should  be sought  by non-directive  questioning  of the patient  
(subject)  during  the screening  process  after signing  informed  consent  and at each  visit during  the 
study.  Adverse  events  also may be detected  when  they are volunteered  by the patient  (subject)  during  
the screening  process  or between  visits,  or through  physical  examination,  laboratory  test, or other  
assessments.  As far as possible,  each  adverse  event  should  be evaluated  to determine:  
• The severity  grade  (CTCAE  Grade  1-4) 
• Its duration  (Start  and end dates)  
• Its relationship  to the study  treatment  (Reasonable  possibility  that AE is related:  No, Yes) or 
its relationship  to the study  treatment  (Reasonable  possibility  that AE is related:  No, Yes, 
investigational  treatment,  Yes, the study  treatment  (non-investigational),  Yes, both and/or  
indistinguishable)  
• Action   taken   with  respect   to  study   or  investigational   treatment   (none,   dose   adjusted,  
temporarily  interrupted,  permanently  discontinued,  unknown,  not applicable)  
• Whether   medication    or   therapy    taken    (no   concomitant   medication/non -drug   therapy,  
concomitant  medication/non -drug therapy)  
• Outcome  (not recovered/not  resolved,  recovered/resolved,  recovering/resolving,  
recovered/resolved  with sequelae,  fatal, unknown)  
• Whether  it is serious,  where  a serious  adverse  event  (SAE)  is defined  as in Section  11.2.1

MEMORIAL  SLOAN  KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB PROTOCOL   
  
• All adverse  events  should  be treated  appropriately.  If a concomitant  medication  or non-drug 
therapy  is given,  this action  should  be recorded  in Medidata.  
• Once  an adverse  event  is detected,  it should  be followed  until its resolution  or until it is judged  
to be permanent,  and assessment  should  be made  at each  visit (or more  frequently,  if 
necessary)  of any changes  in severity,  the suspected  relationship  to the study  treatment,  the 
interventions  required  to treat it, and the outcome.  
• Progression  of malignancy  (including  fatal outcomes),  if documented  by use of appropriate  
method  (Cheson  criteria),  should  not be reported  as a serious  adverse  event.  
• Adverse  events  separate  from the progression  of malignancy  (example,  deep  vein thrombosis  
at the time of progression  or hemoptysis  concurrent  with finding  of disease  progression)  will 
be reported  as per usual  guidelines  used  for such  events  with proper  attribution  regarding  
relatedness  to the drug.  
 
 
11.1.2.  Laboratory  test abnormalities  
 
Laboratory  abnormalities  that constitute  an Adverse  event  in their own right (are considered  clinically  
significant,  induce  clinical  signs  or symptoms,  require  concomitant  therapy  or require  changes  in study  
treatment),  should  be recorded  in Medidata.  Whenever  possible,  a diagnosis,  rather  than a symptom  
should  be provided  (e.g. anemia  instead  of low hemoglobin).  Laboratory  abnormalities  that meet  the 
criteria  for Adverse  Events  should  be followed  until they have returned  to normal  or an adequate  
explanation  of the abnormality  is found.  When  an abnormal  laboratory  or test result  corresponds  to a 
sign/symptom  of an already  reported  adverse  event,  it is not necessary  to separately  record  the 
lab/test  result  as an additional  event.  
Laboratory  abnormalities,  that do not meet  the definition  of an adverse  event,  should  not be reported  
as adverse  events.  A Grade  3 or 4 event  (severe)  as per CTCAE  does not automatically  indicate  a 
SAE unless  it meets  the definition  of serious  as defined  below  and/or  as per investigator’s  discretion.  
A dose  hold or medication  for the lab abnormality  may be required  by the protocol  in which  case  the 
lab abnormality  would  still, by definition,  be an adverse  event  and must  be reported  as such.  
11.2.  Serious Adverse Event 
 
A serious  adverse  event  is one that is fatal or life-threatening  (see below),  is temporarily  or 
permanently  disabling,  requires  inpatient  hospitalization  (initial  or prolonged),  or is associated  with a 
congenital  anomaly,  a new cancer  or a drug overdose  (either  accidental  or intentional).  In addition,  
any event  suggesting  a significant  hazard,  contraindication,  side effect  or precaution  should  also be 
considered  serious.  
11.3.  Life-threatening  event  
 
The event  is an immediate  risk of death  from the reaction  as it occurred.  Life-threatening  does not 
include  a reaction  that, had it occurred  in a more  serious  form,  might  have causeddeath. For example,  
drug-induced  hepatitis  that resolved  without  evidence  of hepatic  failure  would  not be considered  life- 
threatening  even though  drug-induced  hepatitis  can be fatal.

IRB PROTOCOL   
  
All adverse  events  occurring  during  the study,  observed  by the investigator  or reported  by the subject,  
will be reported  to the IRB either  in memorandum  form or on the Medidatatoxicity  form.  The following  
attributes  must  be assigned:  description;  dates  of onset  and resolution;  severity;  assessment  of 
relatedness  to study  drug,  other  suspect  drug,  or device;  and action  taken.  The investigator  may be 
asked  to provide  follow -up information.  
11.5.  Ibrutinib  anticipated  toxicities  
 
Ibrutinib  is an FDA approved  drug for mantle  cell lymphoma.  
 
Likely  (>20%):  Diarrhea,  nausea,  constipation,  abdominal  pain, vomiting,  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection,  fatigue,  peripheral  edema,  bruising,  rash,  musculoskeletal  pain, dyspnea,  decreased  
appetite,  platelets  decreased,  neutrophils  decreased,  hemoglobin  decreased  
Less  Likely  (4-20%):  stomatitis,  dyspepsia,  urinary  tract infection,  pneumonia,  skim infections,  
sinusitis,  pyrexia,  asthenia,  petechiae,  muscle  spams,  arthralgia,  cough,  epistaxis,  dehydration,  
dizziness,  headache,  hyperuricemia,  hemorrhage  (gastrointestinal  bleeding,  hematuria  and post 
procedural  hemorrhage),  hypertension,  second  primary  malignancies - most  common  non-melanoma  
skin cancer  
Rarely  (<3%) : intracranial  and subdural  hematoma,  cardiac  arrhythmias,  lymphocytosis,  tumor  lysis 
syndrome,  progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy  
Most side effects  listed  above  have been  mild to moderate  in severity;  however  severe  side effects  
have occurred.  Some  side effects  have been  severe  enough  to lead to study  drug discontinuation,  
dose  modification  or reduction,  hospitalization,  disability  and sometimes  death.  
11.6.  Ibrutinib  adverse  events  of special  interest  
 
Hemorrhagic  Adverse  Events  
 
Fatal  bleeding  events  have occurred  in patients  treated  with ibrutinib  Grade  3 or higher  bleeding  
events  (subdural  hematoma,  gastrointestinal  bleeding,  hematuria  and post procedural  hemorrhage)  
have occurred  in up to 6% of patients.  Bleeding  events  of any grade,  including  bruising  and petechiae,  
occurred  in approximately  half of patients  treated  with ibrutinib.  The mechanism  for the bleeding  
events  is not well understood.  Ibrutinib  may increase  the risk of hemorrhage  in patients  receiving  
antiplatelet  or anticoagulant  therapies.  
Subjects  in the current  study  will be monitored  closely  for hemorrhagic  adverse  events.  Ibrutinib  should  
be held at least 3 to7 days pre and post-surgery  depending  upon  the type of surgery  and the risk of 
bleeding  (please  refer to Section  9.7 for further  details).  
 
Infection  
 
Fatal  and non-fatal infections  have occurred  with ibrutinib  therapy.  Grade  3 or greater  infections  
occurred  in 14% to 29% of patients.  Cases  of progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy  (PML)  have 
occurred  in patients  treated  with ibrutinib.  Monitor  patients  for fever  and infections  and evaluate  
promptly.  
 
Cytopenias

MEMORIAL  SLOAN  KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB PROTOCOL   
  
Treatment -emergent  Grade  3 or 4 cytopenias  including  neutropenia  (range,  19 to 29%),  
thrombocytopenia  (range,  5 to 17%),  and anemia  (range,  0 to 9%) occurred  in patients  treated  with 
ibrutinib.  Monitor  complete  blood  counts  monthly.  
Atrial  Fibrillation  
 
Atrial  fibrillation  and atrial flutter  (range,  6 to 9%) have occurred  in patients  treated  with ibrutinib,  
particularly  in patients  with cardiac  risk factors,  acute  infections,  and a previous  history  of atrial 
fibrillation.  Periodically  monitor  patients  clinically  for atrial fibrillation.  Patients  who develop  arrhythmic  
symptoms  (e.g.,  palpitations,  lightheadedness)  or new onset  dyspnea  should  have an ECG  performed.  
If atrial fibrillation  persists,  consider  the risks and benefits  of ibrutinib  treatment  and dose  modification  
based  on recommendations  in Section  9. 
 
Hypertension  
 
Hypertension  (range,  6 to 17%)  has occurred  in patients  treated  with ibrutinib  with a median  time to 
onset  of 4.6 months  (range,  0.03 to 22 months).  Monitor  patients  for new onset  hypertension  or 
hypertension  that is not adequately  controlled  after starting  ibrutinib.  Adjust  existing  anti-hypertensive  
medications  and/or  initiate  anti-hypertensive  treatment  as appropriate.  
 
Secondary  Primary  Malignancies  
 
Other  malignancies  (range,  5 to 16%)  including  non-skin carcinomas  (range,  1 to 4%) have occurred  
in patients  treated  with ibrutinib.  The most  frequent  second  primary  malignancy  was non-melanoma  
skin cancer  (range,  4 to 13%).  
 
Tumor  Lysis  Syndrome  
 
Tumor  lysis syndrome  has been  reported  with ibrutinib  therapy.  Assess  the baseline  risk (e.g. high 
tumor  burden)  and take appropriate  precautions.  Monitor  patients  closely  and treat as appropriate.  
Embryo -Fetal  Toxicity  
 
Based  on findings  in animals,  ibrutinib  can cause  fetal harm  when  administered  to a pregnant  woman.  
Administration  of ibrutinib  to pregnant  rats and rabbits  during  the period  of organogenesis  caused  
embryofetal  toxicity  including  malformations  at exposures  that were  2-20 times  higher  than those  
reported  in patients  with MCL,  CLL/SLL  or WM. Advise  women  to avoid  becoming  pregnant  while  
taking  ibrutinib  and for 1 month  after cessation  of therapy.  If this drug is used  during  pregnancy  or if 
the patient  becomes  pregnant  while  taking  this drug,  the patient  should  be apprised  of the potential  
hazard  to a fetus.  
11.7.  Copanlisib  anticipated  toxicities  
 
The side effects  listed  below  have been  reported  by patients  who have received  copanlisib  in clinical  
trials 
Likely  (>20%):  Anemia,  hyperglycemia,  hypertension,  fatigue,  nausea,  diarrhea,  neutropenia  
(including  febrile  neutropenia),  infections,  rash (including  macular,  maculopapular,  pruritic,  pustular,  
erythematous,  generalized,  exfoliative  rash,  pruritus/Pruritus  generalized,  dermatitis  acneiform,  
dermatitis  allergic  and dermatitis  exfoliative)

MEMORIAL  SLOAN  KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB PROTOCOL   
  
Less  Likely  (4-20%):  Dysgeusia,  leukopenia,  lymphopenia,  elevated  amylase  and lipase  increased,  
hypomagnesemia,  hyponatremia,  paraesthesia,  pneumonitis,  interstitial  lung disease,  
thrombocytopenia,  vomiting,  chills,  mucosal  inflammation  (including  stomatitis  and mouth  ulceration),  
dry mouth,  muscle  spasms  
Rarely  (<3%) : alopecia,  hyperinsulinemia,  infusion  related  reaction,  hypers ensitivity,  gastritis,  colitis,  
aphthous  ulcer,  eosinophilia,   Pancreatitis,  Stevens -Johnson  syndrome  
Most side effects  listed  above  have been  mild to moderate  in severity;  however  severe  side effects  
have occurred.  Some  side effects  have been  severe  enough  to lead to study  drug discontinuation,  
dose  modification  or reduction,  hospitalization,  disability  and sometimes  death.  
11.8.  Copanlisib  adverse  events  of special  interest  
 
Non-Infectious   Pneumonitis  
 
Non-infectious  pneumonitis  is an adverse  event  of special  interest.  In general,  non-infectious  
pneumonitis  was symptomatic,  with fever,  cough,  and dyspnea  but asymptomatic  in some  patients.  
Therefore  CT scans  may be used  to assess  for radiographic  indications  of non-infectious  pneumonitis.  
The CT findings  in case  of non-infectious  pneumonitis  were  diffuse  ground -glass  opacities.  A 
bronchoscopy  may not show  any findings.  Non-infectious  pneumonitis  resolved  in all 9 patients,  
usually  within  2 to 4 weeks.  No patient  died due to non-infectious  pneumonitis.  In all 9 patients,  study  
drug was interrupted  and in 3 patients  permanently  discontinued  due to non-infectious  pneumonitis.  
Interruption  of study  drug alone  improved  non-infectious  pneumonitis  in 1 patient,  1 patient  received  
steroids  only, 2 patients  received  antibiotics  only, and 6 patients  received  antibiotics  and steroids.  Re- 
treatment  with study  drugs  was performed  in 2 patients,  resulting  in re-occurrence  of non-infectious  
pneumonitis  in 1 of them.  
 
Hyperglycemia  
 
The PI3K/AKT  pathway  plays  a significant  role in regulating  glucose  metabolism.  Hyperglycemia  is 
considered  as an “on target”  effect  of copanlisib,  and has been  commonlyobserved in patients  treated  
with copanlisib  with an incidence  approximately  50-70%.  
 
Hypertension  
 
Approximately  42% of patients  have post infusion  drug related  Grade  3 hypertension.  There  were  no 
cases  of Grade  4 hypertension.  There  was a CTC Grade  3 SAE hypertension.  Hypertension  was 
reported  in the medical   history  of 22 out of 76 patients;  16 of them  were  already  receiving  
antihypertensive treatment at study start. Antihypertensive treatment was administered in 8 treatment 
naive  patients  as a consequence  of post infusion  hypertension,  and in 7 patients  due to a worsening  
of already  therapy  controlled  baseline  hypertension.  Six of the eight naive  patients  received  treatment  
only on the day of infusion,  and 2 naive  patients  started  chronic  antihypertensive  treatment.  
12.0   CRITERIA  FOR  THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
Response  and progression  of disease  will be evaluated  in this study  using  the RECIL  criteria[37].  
Clinical  evaluation  and tumor  assessments  will be performed  periodically,  as is indicated  in Table  10- 
1, based  on physical  examination,  radiological  evaluation  and core bone  marrow  biopsy  (in patients  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 18 -450 A(10)

MEMORIAL  SLOAN  KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB PROTOCOL   
  
with pre-existing  bone  marrow  involvement).  Clinical  suspicion  of disease  progression  at any time will 
require  a physical  examination  and radiological  confirmation  to be performed  promptly,  rather  than 
waiting  for the next scheduled  tumor  assessment.  In case  of an unscheduled  or delayed  tumor  
assessment  for any reason,  subsequent  tumor  assessments  must  be performed  according  to the 
originally  planned  schedule  from baseline.  
Measurability  of lesion  for objective  response  and measurement  of target  lesions:  Measurable  
disease:  lesions  that can be accurately  measured  in two dimensions  by CT, MRI, plain x-ray of other  
conventional  technique  and have a greatest  transverse  diameter  of 1.5 cm or greater.  Non- 
measurable  disease:  All other  lesions  including  uni dimensional  lesions,  lesions  too small  to be 
considered  measurable,  pleural  or pericardial  effusions,  ascites,  bone  disease,  leptomeningeal  
disease,  lymphangitis,  pulmonitis,  abdominal  masses  not confirmed  by CT, or disease  documented  
only by indirect  evidence  (e.g. lab values).  
Assessment  of tumor  burden  in lymphoma  clinical  trials can use the sum of longest  diameters  (SLD).  
In patients  with disseminated  disease,  a maximum  of three  target  lesions  should  be selected  and used  
to estimate  tumor  response.  Target  lesions  should  be selected  from those  with the largest  size that 
can be reproducibly  measured  and preferably  representing  multiple  sites and/organs.  In most  cases,  
lymph  nodes  can be considered  target  lesions  if the lymph  node  longest  diameter  measures  ≥15 mm. 
Similar  to RECIST  1.1, a lymph  node  measuring  between  10 and 14 mm is considered  abnormal  but 
should  not be selected  as a target  lesion.  Lymph  nodes  measuring  <10mm  in diameter  are considered  
normal.  In certain  anatomical  sites (inguinal,  axillary,  and portocaval),  normal  lymph  nodes  may exist 
in a narrow,  elongated  form,  and such nodes  should  not be selected  as target  lesions  if alternatives  
are available.  Extranodal  lesions  are selected  as target  lesions  if they have soft tissue  component,  
based  on their size, and the ease  of reproducibility  of repeated  measurements,  with a minimum  
measurement  of the longest  diameter  of ≥ 15 mm. All other  lesions  should  be identified  as nontarget  
lesions  and should  be recorded  at baseline,  without  the need  to measure  them.  Nontarget  lesions  
should  be followed  and reported  as present,  absent,  or clear  progression.  
Objective  disease  response  assessment:  Objective  status  is to be recorded  at each  evaluation  
according  to the RECIL  criteria

13.0 CRITERIAFOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
Patients  may voluntarily  withdraw  from the study  or be removed  from the study  at the discretion  of the 
investigator  at any time.  Patients  may be withdrawn  from the study  if any of the following  occur:  
• Disease  progression.  However,  if progression  develops  after CR while  patient  is on ibrutinib  
alone,  patients  could  restart  treatment  upon  radiographic  and pathologic  expression  of 
disease.  
• Ineligibility   (at the pretreatment  evaluation)  of the patient  as defined  in the inclusion/  exclusion  
criteria  
• Treatment  will be discontinued  at the request  of the patient,  refusal  of therapy,  non-compliance,  
or upon  the development  of an intercurrent  significant  medical  illness.  
• Significant  protocol  violation  
• Unacceptable  toxicity  
o Grade  4 arterial  hypertension  
o Grade  4 dermatologic  toxicity  
o  Non-infectious  pneumonitis  
o Drug  induced  clinically  relevant  pancreatitis  
o Grade  ≥3 hypersensitivity  reaction  
• Decision  by the investigator  that termination  is in the patient’s  best medical  interest.  
• Loss to follow -up

• Development  of active  HBV or HCV infection,  hepatitis,  or HIV infection  
• Pregnancy  or a positive  pregnancy  test 
• Death  of the patient  
 
 
In addition  to the general  study  treatment  withdrawal  criteria,  the following  study  specific  criteria  will 
also require  premature  study  treatment  discontinuation:  
• Use of prohibited  medication  
• Start of any other  anti-neoplastic  therapy  
 
 
If a study  treatment  withdrawal  occurs,  or if the patient  fails to return  for visits,  the investigator  must  
determine  the primary  reason  for a patient’s  premature  withdrawal  from study  treatment  and record  
this information  on the End of Treatment  CRF page.  
 
 
14.0     BIOSTATISTICS 
 
14.1.  Phase  I 
 
In the Phase  I part the standard  3+3 dose  escalation  scheme  will be used.  If none  of the initial  cohort  
of 3 has a DLT (defined  in Section 9.2) the dose level will be escalated.  If one has a DLT that dose  
level will be expanded  with 3 more  patients.  Dose escalation  will stop if 2 or more  DLTs are  seen  at a 
dose  level within  the treatment  and observation  periods  as described  in Section  9.2. The MTD is 
defined  as the highest  dose  level at which at most  1 of the 6 patients  treated  at that level has a DLT.  
Two dose  levels  plus a “-1” dose  level are planned  for this study.  The maximum  sample  size is 18 
patients.  Toxicity  seen  after 4 weeks  that are likely or definitely  related  to treatment  with study  drugs  
will be collected  and evaluated  by the investigators.  
All patients  that stop protocol  therapy  or have dose  reductions  due to a DLT will be included  in the 
DLT analysis.  If a patient  stopped  therapy  for other  reasons  and has taken  ≤75% of planned  doses  (2 
of 3 copanlisib  doses and 21 of 28 doses of  ibrutinib)  in the first cycle then they will be excluded  from 
DLT analysis.  In the event  that a patient  withdraws  from the trial due to a reason  unrelated  to a DLT 
before  completing  cycle  one, they will be replaced.  We expect  that less than 10% of patients  will be 
replaced  due to insufficient  time of treatment.  The probability  of dose  escalation  based  on various  
underlying  DLT rates  (Table  2). 
 
 
Table  14-1. DLT probability  table  
True DLT rate 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 40% 50% 
Probability  of 
escalation  0.97 0.91 0.81 0.71 0.60 0.49 0.31 0.17 
 
 
It is expected  that 2-3 patients  will be enrolled  per month  and so the phase  I portion  of the trial will be 
completed  in approximately  6 months.  
14.2.  Phase  II

MEMORIAL  SLOAN  KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB PROTOCOL   
  
The primary  objective  for this phase  II cohort  is to assess  the complete  response  rate based  on best 
response  by 6 months  of ibrutinib  and copanlisib  and the secondary  objective  is to measure  the 
disease  control  rate (stable  disease,  partial  response,  and complete  response),  overall  response  rate 
(partial  and complete  response),  duration  of response,  progression  and event  free survival.  A Simon  
mini-max two stage  design  will be used  with the goal to increase  by complete  response  rate based  on 
best response  by 6 months  from 20% to 40%.  In first stage,  if 5 or more  of 18 patients  have responses,  
then the trial will proceed  to stage  2. In stage  2, additional  patients  are enrolled  to make  the total 
sample  size 33. If 11 or more  responses  are observed,  then the combination  is deemed  promising.  
Accrual  will not be held while  the initial  18 patients  in the first stage  are evaluated  for the 6-month  
response  endpoint.  The one sided  type I error rate is 0.05 and the power  is 0.80.  A total of 33 patients  
will be enrolled,  though  patients  treated  at MTD/RP2D  from phase  I portion  of the study  will be included  
in the phase  II analysis.  Expected  accrual is 2-3 patients  per month  and so the phase  II portion  will 
be completed  within  a year.  
For other  secondary  objectives,  the event  free survival  and progression  free survival  rates  will be 
assessed  by the Kaplan -Meier  estimation.  Event  free survival  is defined  from the date of first dose  to 
progression, or death, and any events including treatment discontinuation for adverse events or 
severe  adverse  events  whichever  came  first. Progression  free survival  is defined  from the date of first 
dose  to progression  or death,  whichever  came  first. The duration  of response  will also be assessed  
by Kaplan -Meier  method  but on a sub-cohort  of patients  who showed  any response.  
To protect  patients  from excessive  toxicity  of the treatment  during  the entire  treatment  period,  several  
stopping  rules are implemented  during  the study  based  on the maximum  total number  of treated  
patients  in both phase  I and II (45).Treatment  related  Grade  ≥3 Pneumonitis  or Colitis:  10% 
unacceptable  rate, 2.5%  acceptable  rate. Trial to hold enrollment  if ≥4 deaths  related  to treatment  at 
any point during  the study.  Otherwise,  hold enrollment  based  on number  of treated  patients.

correlation  with response/resistance  and log rank test for correlation  with duration  of response.  The 
proportion  of patients  with detectable  ctDNA  will be estimated  along  with a 95% CI as well as a mean  
(variance)  of ctDNA.  I plan to plot the variant  allele  frequency  of each  mutation  over time for each  
patient.  ctDNA  levels  will be correlated  with response  or duration  of response  to treatment.  A 
multivariate  logistic  regression  model  will be fit with best response  to treatment  as the outcome  
variable  and ctDNA  and patient -related  factors  as covariates.  To test the relation  between  ctDNA  and 
disease  status,  defined  as no evidence  of radiographic  disease  (CR)  vs radiographic  disease  
(combined  PR, SD, POD),  all serial  measurements  will be used  in a logit model  with generalized  
estimating  equations  to correct  for within -patient  correlations.  Logistic  regression  will be used  to 
assess  the correlations  between  the markers  and tumor  status.  Overall  survival  (OS)  and progression - 
free survival  (PFS)  will be assessed  by Kaplan -Meier  methods.  The effect  of ctDNA  on OS will be 
analyzed  as a time-dependent  covariate  using  a Cox proportional  hazards  model.  Similar  evaluations  
will be performed  on ctRNA.  The statistical  analysis  will be primarily  descriptive  and the data will 
provide  initial  information  regarding  the kinetics  of response  and sensitivity  of the assay  itself.  
Pharmacokinetic  assessments  will be based  on patients  in the phase  I dose  escalation  level 1 and 2 
cohorts.  A non-compartmental  analysis  (NCA)  will be performed  in this study  and pharmacokinetic  
parameters  will be calculated  using  WinNonlin,  in the latest  version.  Based  on the plasma  
concentration –time data,  the following  pharmacokinetic  parameters  will be calculated.

monitoring,  problem  resolution  and prioritization,  and coordinate  the activities  of the protocol  study  
team.  
The data collected  for this study  will be entered  into a secure  database  (Medidata)  at Memorial  Sloan  
Kettering  Cancer  Center.  Source  documentation  will be available  to support  the computerized  patient  
record.  
16.2 Quality Assurance 
 
Registration  reports  will be generated  on an ongoing  basis  to monitor  patient  accruals  and 
completeness  of registration  data.  Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  
missing  data and inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates  and extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and 
follow -up will be monitored  periodically  throughout  the study  period  and potential  problems  will 
be brought  to the attention  of the study  team  for discussion  and action.  
Random -sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by the study  
team,  at a minimum  of two times  per year,  more  frequently  if indicated.  
16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  were  
approved  by the National  Cancer  Institute  in September  2001.  The plans  address  the new 
policies  set forth by the NCI in the document  entitled  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  Institute  
for Data and Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical  Trials”  which  can be found  at: 
 
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html . 
 
The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  were  established  and are monitored  by the Office  of Clinical  
Research.  The MSKCC  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  
Intranet  at: 
https://one.mskcc.org/sites/pub/clinresearch/Documents/MSKCC%20Data%20and%20Safet  
y%20Monitoring% 20Plans. pdf 
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by which  clinical  trials are monitored  for data,  safety  
and quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff education  
on clinical  research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus there  are two 
institutional  committees that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  trials 
programs.  The committees:  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II 
clinical  trials,  and the Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III clinical  trials,  
report  to the Center’s  Research  Council  and Institutional   Review  Board.  
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for its 
level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  
in-house  sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) Will be addressed  and 
the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation.

IRB PROTOCOL   
  
17.1 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
Potential  risks to human  subjects  include  drug related  toxicity;  pain and discomfort  associated  with 
therapy;  treatment  side effects;  phlebotomy;  and possible  psychologic  discomfort  from the stresses  
associated  with obtaining  imaging  studies  (e.g.,  CT scan,  PET scan).  
The side effects  and potential  toxicities  of all agents  are listed  in sections 5.0 and 11.0.  All efforts  will 
be made  to avoid  any comp lication  by completely  reviewing  patients’  symptoms,  providing  appropriate  
management,  and monitoring  blood  tests.  
If an adverse  medical  event  occurs,  the patient  will first contact  the primary  oncologist  or the principal  
investigator.  At nights  and weekends,  there  is an oncology  physician  on call at all times.  Patients  may 
either  call or come  directly  to the Urgent  Care  Center  at Memorial  Hospital  (or to their local emergency  
room)  to be seen.  
Costs  to the patient  (third  party  insurer)  will include  the cost of blood  tests and diagnostic  studies,  
office  visits,  and those  admissions  which  may be required  as a consequence  of treatment -related  
complications.  
All serious  adverse  events  incurred  while  a patient  is on study  will be reported  to the IRB at Memorial  
Hospital,  and Bayer.  All serious  adverse  experiences  and relevant  laboratory  findings  will be reported  
to the principal  investigator  immediately.  An adverse  experience  is considered  serious  if death  occurs,  
the condition  is life threatening,  hospitalization  is required,  or there  is permanent  disability  or 
incapacity.  All information  regarding  serious  adverse  experiences  must  be recorded  on the form 
provided.  Patients  suffering  serious  adverse  reactions  must  be carefully  followed  and all follow-up 
information  also recorded.  
All life threatening  and lethal  known,  unknown,  or suspected  reactions  (toxicities)  must  be reported  to 
the principal  investigator.  An SAE report  will be submitted  to Bayer  within  24 hours  of the principal  
investigator’s  knowledge  of the event,  and the IRB within  5 days.  Any death,  regardless  of cause,  must  
be reported  to the principal  investigator  by telephone  or fax and in writing.  It is the treating  physician’s  
responsibility  to investigate  and report  the date and cause  of death  of any patient  entered  on this trial. 
17.2 Privacy  
 
MSK’s Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure  of protected  health  information  
pursuant  to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  The use and disclosure  of 
protected  health  information  will be limited  to the individuals  described  in the Research  
Authorization  form.  A Research  Authorization  form must  be completed  by the Principal  
Investigator  and approved  by the IRB and Privacy  Board  (IRB/PB).  
The consent  indicates  that individualized   de identified  information  collected  for the purposes  
of this study  may be shared  with other  qualified  researchers.  Only researchers  who have 
received  approval  from MSK will be allowed  to access  this information  which  will not include  
protected  health  informati on, such  as the participant’s  name,  except  for dates.  It is also 
stated  in the Research  Authorization  that their research  data may be shared  with other  
qualified   researchers.

IRB PROTOCOL   
  
17.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• Development  of a new malignancy  
• Pregnancy  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  
hospitalization  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require  hospitalization  may be considered  serious  when,  based  upon  medical  judgment,  
they may jeopardize  the patient  or subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
Note: Hospital  admission  for a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an 
SAE.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  starts  investigational  
treatment/intervention.  SAE reporting  is required  for 30-days after the participant’s  last 
investigational  treatment/intervention.  Any event  that occur  after the 30-day period  that is 
unexpected  and at least possibly  related  to protocol  treatment  must  be reported.  
 
Please  note:  Any SAE that occurs  prior to the start of investigational  treatment/intervention  
and is related  to a screening  tet or procedure  (i.e., a screening  biopsy)  must  be reported.  
 
All SAEs  must  be submitted  in PIMS.  If an SAE requires  submission  to the HRPP  office  per 
IRB SOP  RR-408 ‘Reporting  of Serious  Adverse  Events’,  the SAE report  must  be submitted  
within  5 calendar  days of the event.  All other  SAEs  must  be submitted  within  30 calendar  
days of the event.  
 
The report  should  contain  the following  information:  
• The date the adverse  event  occurred  
• The adverse  event  
• The grade  of the event  
• Relationship  of the adverse  event  to the treatment(s)  
• If the AE was expected  
• Detailed  text that includes  the following  
o An explanation  of how the AE was handled  
o A description  of the participant’s  condition  
o Indication  if the participant  remains  on the study  
• If an amendment  will need  to be made  to the protocol  and/or  consent  form • If the 
SAE is an Unanticipated  Problem

Number of 
Subjects  30 
Diagnosis and 
Main Inclusion 
Criteria  Inclusion Criteria : 
1) Age 16- 80 years old 
2) Meet one of the following:  
a. Active  EoE as per consensus guidelines OR  
b. Undergoing upper endoscopy for a clinical suspicion of EoE   
3) No prior history of dietary elimination therapy  
 
Exclusion Criteria : 
1) Concomitant eosinophilic gastroenteritis  
2) Any corticosteroid exposure in the 4 weeks prior to their baseline 
endoscopic exam  
3) Previous esophageal surgery  
4) Medical instability that precludes safely performing upper endoscopy  
5) Inability to read or understand English  
6) Pregnant women  
Statistical 
Methodology  To determine the response rate for the primary outcome, the number of subjects 
with <15 eos/hpf on follow -up endoscopy will be calculated.  
 
For secondary outcomes, median eosinophil counts, endoscopy scores, and 
symptoms scores will be compared before and after treatment with Wilcoxon 
signed- rank. These will be contextualized by calculating odds ratios and 95% 
confidence intervals where appropriate, so as not to over -rely on p values alone. 
Patients who drop out or who have incomplete data for the outcomes  will be 
excluded from analysis. Because this study’s outcomes are determined after the 
treatment period and follow -up endoscopy, a subject must complete this end of 
treatment evaluation for us to be able to include their data in the analysis. We do 
not feel that selection bias would impact the analysis if there are incomplete data 
due to drop out. We are not performing a comparative analysis between groups, so 
drop out would not be dependent on different treatments administered in different 
study arms. In addition, in our experience with previous clinical studies of EoE, 
dropout rates have been quite low.

CONFIDENTIAL  1   Introduction 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according to US 
and international standards of Good Clinical Practice,  applicable government regulations and Institutional 
research policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background  
Over the past decade, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) has rapidly increased in incidence and prevalence, 
becoming a major cause of chroni c gastrointestinal morbidity. EoE is defined by pathologic infiltration of 
eosinophils into the esophageal mucosa, leading to dysphagia and progressive esophageal stenosis, and 
is now the most common cause of food impaction in the U.S. EoE is a chronic, al lergic/immune -mediated 
condition that appears to be driven primarily by IL- 5+ and IL- 13+ T cell responses to food antigens, based 
on studies observing disease remission in individuals empirically avoiding all potentially allergenic foods. 
However, such radical elimination diets are not feasible and there is no currently available test to accurately 
identify specific food triggers in EoE. Because of this, successful dietary therapy requires empiric 
elimination of a large number of foods, subsequent reintroduction of single foods, and invasive monitoring 
(endoscopy with biopsy) to assess response. There is a critical need to develop methods to reliably identify 
allergen triggers.  
 
In Phase I of the Team Translational Science Award, we began to address these ke y knowledge gaps. 
Using prospectively collected biospecimens, we successfully developed a novel T cell directed approach 
whereby allergen- specific T cells were correlated with known dietary triggers of EoE. We examined 
esophageal tissue, duodenal tissue, a nd blood, and found that the blood compartment was the most reliable 
for extracting, culturing, and stimulating T cells. This demonstration was the first time in humans with EoE 
that potential food triggers could be detected with a T cell signature in the blood, and it provided proof -of-
principle of a clinical application of individualized food elimination regimens. We also performed preliminary 
studies detecting allergen -specific IgG4 in esophageal biopsies, a recently described pathogenic 
mechanism of EoE . We feel that the combination of these techniques will allow determination of allergen-
specific immune signatures in EoE patients. These hold great promise to impact clinical practice by 
accurately identifying foods to eliminate in dietary therapy, thus i ncreasing compliance and ultimately 
response rates. However, additional steps are required before clinical adoption of this approach.  
 
The goal of this study is to conduct a pilot prospective study of allergen- specific immune signature- guided 
dietary elimination therapy to assess the clinical effectiveness of this technique. The overall hypothesis is 
that T cells obtained from the blood of a subject with active EoE, when cultured and stimulated with food 
allergens, and when coupled with allergen- specific Ig G4 detected in an esophageal biopsy, will result in a 
food trigger -specific immunological signature that can be used to design highly effective dietary treatment 
specific to that individual.  
1.2 Rationale  
Eosinophilic esophagitis is a rapidly increasing chronic allergic condition  
Over the past decade, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) has rapidly increased in incidence and prevalence to 
become a major cause of chronic gastrointestinal morbidity, with annual health care costs estimated at $1 
billion.1-3 EoE i s defined by pathologic infiltration of eosinophils into the esophageal mucosa, leading to 
dysphagia and progressive esophageal stenosis,4, 5 and is now the most common cause of food impaction 
in the U.S.6, 7 EoE is a chronic, allergic/immune- mediated cond ition that is driven primarily by IL- 5+ and IL-
13+ T cell responses to food antigens,8-11 rather than a typical immediate IgE response.12 This pathogenesis 
suggests that dietary elimination would be effective, and disease remission has been demonstrated in 
individuals empirically avoiding all allergenic foods or consuming only a hypoallergenic elemental formula.13-
18  
 
  
IDiET Protocol   Page 4 
Version: June 20, 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  Dietary elimination, as currently conceived, is a sub -optimal and cumbersome therapy option  
There are multiple problems, however, with the dietary elimination approach to treatment of EoE. Radical 
elimination diets, although effective, are not feasible given their very restrictive nature. For example, more 
than 50% of adults are unable to tolerate an elemental formula diet for more than a fe w days,15 and children 
often require placement of feeding tubes to obtain adequate nutrition.14, 19 Further, poor ability to adhere to 
the so- called “six food elimination diet”, which empirically removes dairy, wheat, egg, soy, nuts, and 
seafood, has led t o variable and unpredictable response rates.20, 21 
 
A major reason for this is that no currently available allergy test can accurately identify specific food triggers 
leading to EoE. For example, two studies have shown that an elimination diet based on ski n-prick testing 
correctly identifies food triggers in only 13%, a rate that is far worse than expected by chance alone.17, 22 
Because of this, successful dietary therapy requires empiric elimination of a large number of foods, 
subsequent reintroduction of single foods, then endoscopy and biopsy to assess for recurrent tissue 
eosinophilia.5 This leads to dietary changes that are frequently unnecessary, and the serial endoscopies, 
which can number up to 10 in a single year,22 are costly and risky.3 Finally, w hile alternative treatment with 
topical corticosteroids is possible in patients who cannot comply with dietary therapy, not all patients 
respond, and long- term use of this medication class is unsafe.23, 24 Therefore, there is a critical need to 
develop met hods to reliably identify allergen triggers. This will advance understanding of the biology of EoE, 
lead to substantially improved therapy, and reduce costs.  
 
This study uses  novel and highly innovative techniques to identify dietary trig gers and individua lize 
dietary treatment regimens, making dietary elimination practical and more palatable  
A novel allergen- specific immune signature- directed approach to food trigger identification has great 
promise for EoE. The current model of EoE pathogenesis holds that  when food antigens are presented to 
the GI tract, either in the esophagus or in the small intestine, previously sensitized T cells are triggered to 
produce a cascade of Th2 cytokines, including IL- 4, IL -5, and IL -13.8 In addition, a recent study has 
ident ified foodspecific IgG4 as important to the pathogenesis.12 Because this model is neither simply an 
immediate IgE - nor a classic delayed IgG -mediated response, it is not surprising that skin prick or patch 
tests are not accurate.  
 
An alternative approach w ould be to create a food trigger -specific immunological signature using both 
sensitized T cells and food -specific IgG4 as the basis for elimination diet therapy. The complexity of the 
immune response in EoE suggests that IgG4- secreting B -cells may receive signals from allergen-
responsive T cells after exposure.25 Our previous work has shown that T cells sensitized to specific foods 
can be readily expanded and characterized in response to antigen in non- EoE patients with IgE -mediated 
peanut or egg allergies.26-28 In our work supported by Phase I of the UNC Team Translational Science 
Award (TTSA), we showed for the first time in patients with EoE that this could also be done. Specifically, 
using prospectively collected specimens, we successfully developed a no vel T cell directed approach 
whereby allergen- specific T cells were correlated with known dietary triggers of EoE. We examined 
esophageal tissue, duodenal tissue, and blood, and found that the blood compartment was the most reliable 
for extracting, culturi ng, and stimulating T cells (see below). Moreover, we performed preliminary studies 
detecting food allergen- specific IgG4 in esophageal biopsies in EoE patients (see below).  
 
Taken together, these findings demonstrate proof -of-principle of a potential clin ical application using 
allergenspecific immune signatures to identify food triggers and create elimination diet regimens in patients 
with EoE.  
 
Optimization of newly developed techniques of determining allergen -specific immune signatures in 
patients with well -characterized, food -driven EoE.  
Investigators studied  two allergen- specific signatures.  The first was antigen- specific IgG4 in esophageal 
tissue.  Investigators showed that total and food- specific IgG4 was markedly elevated in esophageal 
biopsies fro m EoE cases compared to controls (Table 1).  Second, investigators showed that food- specific 
IgG4 levels of trigger foods decreased in EoE patients who responded to dietary elimination (Figure 1).  
Third, using the sub- population of EoE patients who succes sfully responded to dietary elimination and in 
whom the trigger foods were known, investigators were able to develop optimal thresholds for normalized 
food- specific IgG4 levels that identified food triggers with a good to excellent agreement (Table 2).  
IDiET Protocol   Page 5 
Version: June 20, 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  The second allergen- specific signature we assessed was the lymphocyte proliferation assay developed by 
the investigators.  Here, investigators again used the sub- population of EoE patients who successfully 
responded to dietary elimination and in whom the t rigger foods were known to develop a threshold for 
identifying food triggers with good to excellent agreement (Table 3).  When both tests were used together, 
the sensitivity for identifying triggers was improved, with an associated decrease in specificity (Table 4).  
However, investigators will accept this trade- off for this protocol so that investigators identify as many 
potential food triggers as possible to optimize the treatment response rate.  Moreover, the agreement across all of the tested foods was substantially better than the reported agreement of 13% using traditional skin prick allergy tests.  Investigators  have confirmed that the lab studies can yield results within 2 weeks, 
which is a clinically acceptable time frame.  In addition, investigator s performed cytokine stimulation testing 
for 14 EoE cases with IL- 4, IL- 5, and IL- 13 but these results did not clearly help to increase the yield for 
identifying food triggers, so investigators  will not pursue this direction further (data not shown).  
 
 
These thresholds will be used in this prospective study of allergen- specific immune signature- guided dietary 
elimination therapy to assess the clinical effectiveness of this technique.  Samples may be tested using 
additional allergens, including but not limited to beef, corn, fish, shellfish, rice, chicken, potato, pork, Table 3 :  Performance of lymphocyte proliferation testing  for identifying food triggers in EoE

are for data collection only and will not be used to drive subject diet elimination  or communicated to subjects.  
2 Study Objectives  
Primary Objective: To evaluate prospectively the effectiveness of individualized allergen- specific immune 
signature- based dietary elimination therapy for EoE.  
 
We hypothesize that at least 75% of patients with active EoE will experience a histologic response following 
treatment with an individualized dietary regimen based on their o wn allergen- specific immune signature.  
3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
This is a p rospective single center clinical trial of allergen- specific immune signature- guided dietary 
elimination therapy to assess the clinical effectiveness of this technique.  
 
Potential subjects will be approached regarding the study . If eligible and interested, then informed consent 
will be obtained and they will be enrolled in the study.  If the subject h as had an 
esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)  at UNC with in 3 months  since enrollment, clinical biopsies from the 
EGD show active EoE and the subject continues to meet consensus guidelines for active EoE, and research 
biopsies were taken during that EGD that can be used for this study , then the subject will complete 
questionnaires  and a blood draw  only.  The blood draw may be abbreviated if the subject had research 
blood drawn during the same recent EGD that can be used in this study.  
 
If subjects have not had an EGD with biopsies at UNC within 3 months prior to  enrollment, then th ey will 
complete questionnaires, a blood draw, and be scheduled to receive a routine care 
esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)  at UNC facilities  with clinical and research biopsies .  However, in 
some cases, samples that were obtained prior to this time frame can be used, as long as the samples were 
obtained when the EoE was active and there were no major changes in clinical status.  
 
During the routine care endoscopy, clinical biopsies will be taken for routine care purposes, and additional 
research biopsies wi ll be collected for research purposes for diet elimination testing and to be stored for 
future research studies from the distal, mid, and proximal esophagus.  Blood will also be collected during 
this visit, and questionnaires completed.  If research biopsi es are unable to be obtained during this EGD 
the subject will no longer continue in the study and will be considered a screen fail.  If pathology from routine 
care biopsies does not confirm a diagnosis of active EoE, then the subject will no longer continue in the 
study and will be considered a screen fail.   If subjects have had an EGD with clinical and research biopsies 
within 3 months prior to enrollment, then research biopsies taken during that EGD will be used for this study.   
As noted above, in some cases, samples that were obtained prior to this time frame can be used, as long 
as the samples were obtained when the EoE was active and there were no major changes in clinical status.  
 
After completion of the EGD and/ or collection of EGD records  and previous biopsies  if an EGD was 
previously completed), and confirmation of eligibility,  subjects will be scheduled for a routine care nutrition 
counseling appointment.  Two weeks prior to the routine care nutrition counseling appointment, subject s 
will begin the dysphagia symptom questionnaire (DSQ).  During the routine care nutrition counseling 
appointment, the subject will receive counseling on which foods to eliminate based on the T -cell and IgG4 
results from the research biopsies.  Subjects will also receive a n allergy skin test during this visit.  Results 
from the allergy skin test will not be used to drive food elimination diet . 
 
Subjects will follow their assigned food elimination diet for 6 weeks.  At 6 weeks  subjects  will be scheduled 
for a routine care esophagogastroduodenoscopy  (EGD) with biopsies for clinical purposes.  Two weeks 
prior to the 6 week EGD subjects will restart the DSQ. Data will be collected from the 6 week EGD but no 
research specific biopsies will be obtained during that visit.  Research specific blood will be taken at this 
visit. Study participation is complete after completion of the 6 week EGD.

CONFIDENTIAL  3.4 Study Outcomes  
The primary outcome will be histologic response, defined as a post -treatment esophageal  eosinophil 
count of <15 eos/hpf.41 The esophageal eosinophil counts will be quantified using our previously  
validated protocol.42  
 
The secondary outcomes will be: 1) change in the  absolute esophageal eosinophil count;  2) improvement 
in the endoscopic appearance, as measured by a validated endoscopy score;43 and 3)  improvement in 
symptoms, as measured by a validated dysphagia symptom score.44 
4 Subject Selection and Withdrawal  
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
1) Age 16- 80 years old 
2) Meet one of the following:  
a. Active EoE as per consensus guidelines OR  
b. Undergoing upper endoscopy for a clinical suspicion of EoE  
3) No prior history of diet ary elimination therapy  
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
1) Concomitant eosinophilic gastroenteritis  
2) Any corticosteroid exposure in the 4 weeks prior to their baseline endoscopic exam  
3) Previous esophageal surgery  
4) Medical instability that precludes safely performing upper endoscopy  
5) Inability to read or understand English  
6) Pregnant women 
4.3 Subject Recruitment and Screening  
Patients with active or suspected EoE or who are undergoing or recently underwent  routine care upper 
endoscopy will be screened by research personnel . These patients will be identified by  screening the 
endoscopy and CEDAS clinic schedules  or via referrals from other physicians . Once a potential subject is 
identified , study personnel  will contact the potential subject to describe the study and gauge interest in 
participating.  Initial contact may be in person or on the phone.  If the patient is interested in participating, 
then the study coordinator or other study staff will obtain written  informed consent  from the subject.   
4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1  When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, and without  repercussion.  
The investigator, Dr. Evan Dellon, has the right t o withdraw a patient from the study in the event of an 
intercurrent illness, adverse event (AE), treatment failure, protocol violation, and for administrative or other 
reasons. An excessive rate of withdrawals would reduce the amount of data available for analysis and limit 
the ability to interpret the study results; therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of patients should be avoided.  
 
If subjects become pregnant during the study, then their participation will be stopped.  
4.4.2  Lost to Follow -Up 
A subject will be considered lost to follow -up after documentation has been made of at least three 
documented attempts to contact (via phone or email).  At that point a certified letter should be mailed to the 
subject’s home address.  If there is still no response after the c ertified letter is delivered, then the subject 
will be withdrawn from the study as lost to follow -up. 
IDiET Protocol   Page 13 
Version: June 20, 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  4.4.3  Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects 
Patients who withdraw prematurely from the study may be asked to complete an end of study visit per t he 
study procedures.  In addition, any ongoing adverse drug reactions or study -related adverse events will be 
followed until resolution or documentation of why there will be no resolution if the event will be ongoing.

1 Subjects must be scheduled for a routine care EGD with biopsies (clinical and research)  at UNC or have had a routine care EGD 
with clinical and research biopsies at UNC within 3 months prior to enrollment.  If subjects have had a recent EGD as defined above, 
then results from clinical biopsies taken during that EGD will be used to assess eligibility for this study, and research biopsies  and 
EREFs  from that EGD will also be used for this study.  In these cases, an additional EGD does not need to be performed.  In addition, 
if research blood was collected during the recent EGD and can be used in this study, then subjects will have an abbreviated blood 
collection during the screening visit. If subjects have not had an EGD with research and clinical biopsies at UNC within 3 months of 
enrollment , then they must be scheduled to receive a routine care EGD with biopsies at UNC during which clinical and research 
biopsies will be collected for this  study.  
2 These procedures are considered routine care and are billed to the subject and/or subject’s insurance.  
3 The DSQ is started 2 weeks prior to the Day 1 and 6 week visits. 
4 Results from the allergy skin testing will not be used to drive the food elimination diet.  
5 Subjects will begin diet elimination on day 1 and continue for 6 weeks.  
5.1 Screening Visit  
During the screening visit , eligibility is assessed (based on inclusion/exclusion criteria) and those eligible 
and interested in participating will provide informed consent.   Potential cases will be identified  by 
screening endoscopy and clinic schedules .  This will require approval  of a limited HIPAA waiver to access 
the personal health information (PHI) of potential research subjects prior to their formal enrollment.     
 
The following procedures will be completed during the screening visit:  
• Informed consent  
• Inclusion/exclusion cri teria review to determine eligibility  
• Demographics  
• Medical history  
• Current medications  
• Vital signs

***If subjects have had an EGD at UNC within 3 months of enrollment including clinical and research 
biopsies that can be used in this study, then the EGD will not be performed and biopsies and EREF 
scores from the recent EGD will be used in this  study.  
5.1.1  Consenting Procedure  
If a subject is screened eligible and interested in the study, the subject will be consented on the study 
prior to any study procedure. W ritten informed consent will be obtained by qualified study personnel.  
Documentation of the consent process will be maintained in the subject’ s research record.  
 
Subjects  will be given ample time to review the consent document and ask any questions they m ay have.  
A copy of the written consent form will be provided to the subject  and the original maintained in the 
subject ’s research record.   
 
If subjects  meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria and consent to the study, they will be 
enrolled in the study.  Subjects will be assigned a unique subject code.   
 
5.1.2  Biopsy Collection and Processing  
The research biopsy protocol below is frequently used in CEDAS research projects.  If subjects have had 
an EGD with biopsies at UNC within 3 months prior to enrollment and the biopsies are available for use in 
this study, and the subject consented to their use in future research studies , then the subject does not 
need to return for an EGD with biopsies, unless necessary for routine care.  
 
If subjects have not had an EGD within 3 months of enrollment in which biopsies below are available for 
this study, then they can be scheduled for a routine care EGD with biopsies at UNC to be eligible for this 
study.  However, in some cases, samples that were obtained prior to this time frame can be used, as long 
as the samples were obtained when the EoE was active and there were no major changes in clinical 
status.  During the routine care EGD, clinical biopsies will be obtained for pathology assessment. In 
addition, 4 research- specific biopsies will be obtained from each of the following locations:  Distal 
esophagus (3cm from TGF), middle esophagus (8cm from TGF), and proximal esophagus (13cm from 
TGF). Additionally, 2 research- specific biopsies will be obtained from the duodenum, and 2 research-
specific biopsies will be obtained from the stomach (1 from antrum, 1 from body).  The 4 distal biopsies 
will be separated into 4 cryovials: 2 filled with formalin for histology, 1 filled with RNALater, and 1 empty  to 
be frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen.        
 
Research biopsies will be used in this study, and will be stored indefinitely for future research.  Subjects 
will sign a separate stored specimens consent form for this purpose.  If a complete set of cli nical and 
research biopsies is not collected during the routine care EGD, then he subject will be considered a 
screen fail.

5.2 Day 1 Visit  
Two weeks prior to the day 1 visit, and while the lab performs T -cell and IgG4 signatures testing, subjects 
will be asked to fill out the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ). The DSQ is a daily 3- question 
symptom diary to be completed nightly over a 2 week time period. This can be done on paper or by email.  
 
During the day 1 visit, subjects will be scheduled for a routine care nutrition counseling appointment. 
During this appointment subjects will be advised how to effectively follow an elimination diet based on the 
specific triggers identified between Screening and Day 1 using samples obtained for the research study 
and will under allergy skin prick testing as a research procedure.  Results from the allergy skin prick 
testing will not be used to dri ve the food elimination diet.  
 
Subjects will be instructed to eliminate between 1 and 5 foods (dairy, wheat, egg, soy, and/or nuts) based 
on results from the T -cell and IgG4 signatures.  Subjects will adhere to the elimination diet for 6 weeks

6 Statistical Plan  
6.1 Sample Size Determination  
Because this is a proof -of-principle effectiveness study without a comparison group, there is not a formal 
sample size calculation. However, we plan to consent and enroll up to 30 subjects  with a goal of 20 subjects 
completing the study  to show that 75% ( 15) have a histologic response to the allergen- specific immune-
signature dietary elimination. We feel that this is a robust number of patients to demonstrate a preliminary 
effect, while also being a realistic number to enroll during this pilot study. In addition, while the 95% CIs 
around this goal are somewhat wide (47- 92%), current allergy testing only has the ability to accurately 
predict triggers 13% of the time, so even if we are at the lower end of the range, it’s still a major clinical step 
forward in practice.  
 
In the proposed study, we will be performing the first prospective effectiveness study of an allergen- specific 
immune signature- based individualized dietary elimination regimen in patients with EoE. Because we are 
conducting what will essentiall y be a pilot or proof -of-principle study, the data we collect, including response 
rates and magnitude of response, will directly inform a planned large scale (ie R01) grant application for a 
randomized study of immune- signature- based elimination versus empiric food elimination.  
6.2 Statistical Methods  
To determine the response rate for the primary outcome, the number of subjects with <15 eos/hpf on follow -
up endoscopy will be calculated. For secondary outcomes, median eosinophil counts, endoscopy scores, 
and sy mptoms scores will be compared before and after treatment with Wilcoxon signed- rank. These will 
be contextualized by calculating odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals where appropriate, so as not to 
IDiET Protocol   Page 18 
Version: June 20, 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  over-rely on p values alone. Patients who drop out or who have incomplete data for the outcomes will be 
excluded from analysis. Because this study’s outcomes are determined after the treatment period and 
follow -up endoscopy, a subject must complete this end of treatment evaluation for us to be able to include 
their data in the analysis. We do not feel that selection bias would impact the analysis if there are incomplete 
data due to drop out. We are not performing a comparative analysis between groups, so drop out would 
not be dependent on different treatments administered in different study arms. In addition, in our experience 
with previous clinical studies of EoE, dropout rates have been quite low.  
6.3 Subject Population(s) for Analysis  
Patients who drop out or who have incomplete data for the outcomes will be exc luded from analysis  
7 Safety and Adverse Events  
7.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  (UPIRSOs)  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility tha t the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by the 
procedures involved in the research,  
• Suggests that the research places  subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including 
any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, experience, or 
disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered 
related to the subject’ s participation in the research.  Adverse events encompass both physical and 
psychological harms . Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal 
results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance 
 
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non- serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospital stay  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threaten ing, but are clearly of major 
clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result 
in in-patient  hospitalization, or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would 
typically be considered serious.  
 
IDiET Protocol   Page 19 
Version: June 20, 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non -serious 
adverse events.  
 
Serious vs.  Severe  
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, 
or severe); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe 
headache).  This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria 
usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) 
serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device E ffect   
Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life- threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, 
or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights,  
safety, or welfare of subjects (231CFR812.3(s)).  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the period from the 
initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  For this study, the study 
treatment f ollow -up is defined as 30 days following the last administration of study treatment.   
 
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be 
recorded as an adverse event if the fr equency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during 
the study period.  
 
General Physical Examination Findings 
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the 
end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse 
event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
 
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by the investigator until t he events are resolved, the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s 
personal  physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The investigator 
should notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has 
discontinued or terminated study participation that m ay reasonably be related to this study.  The sponsor 
should also be notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a 
congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in this st udy.  
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one of the following 
conditions is met:   
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, 
etc. 
 
Hospitaliza tion, Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery  
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and 
reported as a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition  
responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for 
and adverse event.   
IDiET Protocol   Page 20 
Version: June 20, 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL   
Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are reported as an adverse 
event in the following circumstances:  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical procedures for a 
preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the 
purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnost ic and the outcome was uneventful.  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization required to allow efficacy measurement for the study.  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for therapy of the target disease of the study, unless it 
is a worsening or i ncrease in frequency of hospital admissions as judged by the clinical investigator.  
7.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
At each contact with the subject, the investigator must seek information on adverse events by specific 
questioning and, as appropriate, by exami nation.  Information on all adverse events should be recorded 
immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report 
form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures resul ts should 
recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event 
should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until  it has been determined that the study treatment or 
participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period 
must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs aft er the study 
period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be 
recorded and reported immediately.  
7.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems  
Investigators and the protocol sponsor must conform to the adverse event reporting timelines, formats and 
requirements of the various entities to which they are responsible, but at a minimum those events that must 
be reported are those that are:  
• related to study participation,  
• unexpected, and  
• serious or involve risks to subjects or others  
(see definitions, section 7.1).   
If the report is supplied as a narrative, the minimum necessary information to be provided at the time of the 
initial report includes:  
• Study identifier  
• Study Center  
• Subject number  
• A description of the event  
• Date of onset  • Current status  
• Whether study treatment was discontinued  
• The reason why the event is classified as serious  
• Investigat or assessment of the association 
between the event and study treatment  
 
7.3.1  Notifying the UNC IRB 
Dr. Evan Dellon is responsible for reporting adverse events to the UNC IRB per the UNC IRB SOPs for 
reporting adverse events. Federal regulations require investigators to report unanticipated problems 
involving risks to subjects or others to the IRB. Historically, there has been confusion about what needs to 
be reported. OHRP and FDA have issued guidance that clarifies that investigators need only report 
“unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others” (or UPIRSOs). The UNC -Chapel Hill policy is 
based on this guidance. “Adverse events” that are not UPIRSOs are not required to be reported to the IRB.  
Site should refer to the most recent version of UNC IRB SOPs for up to date reporting requirements.  
 
IDiET Protocol   Page 21 
Version: June 20, 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  7.3.1.1  Differentiating between an UPIRSO and an Adverse Event 
By definition, an UPIRSO is unexpected, whereas an “adverse event” may be anticipated or unanticipated. 
Additionally, an UPIRSO may involve the i ncreased risk of harm —whether or not any actual harm occurred. 
In order to decide which events or circumstances constitute an UPIRSO, it is important to bear in mind the 
following:  
• Not all Adverse Events are UPIRSOs. Only a small subset of “adverse events”  occurring in FDA -
regulated clinical trials and other types  of studies constitute UPIRSOs.  Many events that are 
required to be reported to the sponsor or federal agency are not UPIRSOs.  
• An UPIRSO may not be an adverse event. It is possible for an event that does not involve actual 
physical, psychological, social, or economic harm to a research subject or another person 
nevertheless to constitute an UPIRSO that must be reported to the IRB. This is the case if the event 
places subjects or others at increased or different risk of harm, regardless of whether actual harm 
has occurred.  
 
There are other types of incidents, experiences and outcomes that occur during the conduct of human 
subjects research that represent UPIRSOs but are not considered adverse events. Some UPIRSOs involve 
social or economic harm instead of the physical or psychological harm associated with adverse events. In 
other cases, UPIRSOs place subjects or others at  risk of harm, but no harm occurs. For example, an 
investigator conducting behavioral research collects individually identifiable sensitive information about illicit 
drug use and other illegal behaviors by surveying college students. The data are stored on a laptop 
computer without encryption, and the laptop computer is stolen from the investigator’s car. This is an 
UPIRSO and must be reported because the incident was (a) unexpected (i.e., the investigators did not 
anticipate the theft); (b) related to participation in the research; and (c) placed the subjects at a greater risk 
of psychological and social harm from the breach in confidentiality of the study data than was previously 
known or recognized.  
 
Other examples of UPIRSOs that should be reported to the IRB, even though they are not adverse events, 
include:  
• Publication in the literature, safety monitoring report (e.g., DSMB report), interim result, or other 
finding that indicates an unexpected change to the risk/benefit ratio of the research;  
• Breach in confidentiality resulting from a disclosure of confidential information or from lost or stolen 
confidential information;  
• Unresolved complaint of a participant, family member or other individual;  
• Laboratory or medication errors that may involve potential risk to that individual or others;  
• Change in FDA labeling because of adverse consequences or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, 
device, or biologic used in a research protocol;  
• Disqualification or suspension of investigators;  
• Accidental or unintentional change to the IRB -approved protocol that involves risks or has the 
potential to recur;  
• Deviation from the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate hazard 
to a research participant  
• Any deviation from the IRB -approved protocol that increases the risk or affects the participant’s 
rights, safety, or welfare.  
7.3.1.2  UNC IRB Reporting Timelines  
Reporting is required of all UPIRSOs, including those which may occur after the participant has completed 
or is withdrawn from the study, or following study closure. Reporting is completed via IRBIS, UNC’s online 
IRB information sy stem.  
 
Events that meet the criteria for an UPIRSO and are also serious adverse events should be reported to the 
IRB within one (1) week  of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
 
Any other events that meet the criteria for a UPIRSO should be reported to the IRB within two (2) weeks 
of the investigator becoming aware of the problem.  
IDiET Protocol   Page 22 
Version: June 20, 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL   
If the report cannot be completed in its entirety within the required time period, a preliminary report should 
be submitted. The report should be amended once the event is resolved and/or more information becomes 
available.   
 
Site should refer to the most recent version of UNC IRB SOPs for up to date reporting requirements.  
7.3.2  Notifying the FDA  – Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
Unanticipated adverse device effect  means any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was 
not previously ident ified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application 
(including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with 
a device that relates to the rights,  safety, or welfare of subjects (231CFR812.3(s)).  
 
Per 21CFR812.46(b) the sponsor (Dr. Dellon)  shall immediately conduct an evaluation of any unanticipated 
adverse device effect.  
 
A sponsor who determines that an unanticipated adverse device effect presents an unreasonable r isk to 
subjects shall terminate all investigations or parts of investigations presenting that risk as soon as possible. 
Termination shall occur not later than 5 working days after the sponsor makes this determination and not 
later than 15 working days after the sponsor first received notice of the effect  
 
Per 21CFR812.150( b), a sponsor (Dr. Dellon) who conducts an evaluation of an unanticipated adverse 
device effect under §812.46(b) shall report the results of such evaluation to FDA and to all reviewing IRB's 
and participating investigators within 10 working days after the sponsor first receives notice of the effect. 
Thereafter the sponsor shall submit such additional reports concerning the effect as FDA requests.  
7.4 Stopping Rules  
This study does not have stopping rules, and there are no plans for an interim analysis.  
7.5 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to oversee the safety of the study at his/her site.  This 
safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted 
above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 
9).  Medica l monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of adverse events.  
 
Safety data will be aggregated and reviewed by the principal investigator, Dr. Evan Dellon periodically. 
Individual adverse events will be reviewed weekly, or as necessary, by study investigators. Adverse events 
will be reported to the IRB per local IRB SOPs.  
 
While an overall study stop is not anticipated due to the low risk profile of the study, Dr. Evan Dellon will 
closely monitor adverse events. Any unusual or unanticipated events will be carefully considered and 
reported to the IRB as per IRB SOPs. The site PI, Dr. Evan Dellon, will review all safety data and determine 
severity, and causality on an ongoing basis. Research personnel will communicate safety informati on to 
the PI in a timely manner.  
8 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
8.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed 
subject authorization informing the subject  of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
IDiET Protocol   Page 23 
Version: June 20, 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  • Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorizat ion for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by regulation, retains 
the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that 
have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect 
at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
8.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, or iginal records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a 
clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source 
documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records  include: hospital records, clinical and 
office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing 
records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as  
being accurate and complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, 
subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico- technical departments 
involved in the clinical trial.  
8.3 Case Report Fo rms 
The study will utilize paper case report forms (eCRFs).  All data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  
All missing data must be explained in the comments section of the CRF.  Data will then be entered into a 
secure Excel workbook.  
8.4 Records Retention  
Per 21CFR812.140(d), an investigator or sponsor shall maintain the records required by this subpart during 
the investigation and for a period of 2 years after the latter of the following two dates: The date on which 
the investigation is terminated or completed, or the date that the records are no longer required for purposes 
of supporting a premarket approval application or a notice of completion of a product development protocol.

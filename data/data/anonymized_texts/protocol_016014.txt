CONFIDENTIALAMENDMENT HISTORY
Amendment 5
The purpose of this amendment is to change the time point for evaluation of the secondary 
endpoints from week 100 to week 52.
The secondary outcome measures include as sessment of parameters associated with the 
prevention of vision threatening complications s econdary to diabetic retinopathy, and central-
involved diabetic macular edema (DME).  Th ese secondary outcome measures were to be 
analyzed in an exploratory manner at week 52 and formally tested at week 100.  At week 24, 
these measures were assessed from a safety pers pective, and there was a remarkable separation 
between the Intravitreal Afliberc ept Injection (IAI) and sham groups.  This separation was highly 
suggestive that IAI has a profound impact on these out comes in diabetic retinopathy patients.  In 
light of these results, Regeneron feels that it is important to make these data available to the 
diabetic retinopathy community through approved labeling as soon as possible.

CONFIDENTIALCLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
Title A Phase 3, Double -Masked, Randomized Study of the Efficacy and Safety of 
Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection in Patien ts with Moderately Severe to Severe
Nonproliferative Diabetic Retinopathy
Site Locations Approximately 70 sites.
Objectives The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of intravitreal (IVT) 
aflibercept compared to sham treatment in the improvement of moderately severe 
tosevere nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR).
The secondary objectives of the study are:
xTo characterize the safety of IVT aflib ercept in patients with moderately 
severe to severe NPDR 
xTo determine if IVT aflibercept w ill prevent the worsening of diabetic 
retinopathy and reduce the incidence of diabetic macular edema (DME)
xTo determine the anatomic effects of  IVT aflibercept in patients with 
moderately severe to severe NPDR.
Study Design This is a phase 3, double -masked, randomized study of the ef ficacy and safety of 
IVT aflibercept for the improvement of  moderately severe to severe NPDR.
Eligible patients will be enrolled into  1 of 3 treatment groups in a 
1:1:1 randomization scheme, and will be stratified based on their Diabetic 
Retinopathy Severi ty Scale (DRSS) score (level 47 vs. level 53).  Only 1 eye will 
be selected as the study eye.  The 3 treatm ent groups will have the following dosing 
regimens from day 1 to week 48:  1) ev ery 8 weeks (2Q8) aflibercept IVT after 5 
initial monthly doses; 2) e very 16 weeks (2Q16) aflibercept IVT after 3 initial 
monthly doses and 1 Q8 interval; and 3) sham treatment.  In year 2 (beginning at week 56), the 2Q8 group will be treated with a flexible treatment regime
n.
The primary outcome measure of the study is the proportion of patients who have improved by ≥2 steps from baseline on the DRSS in the 
combined 2Q8 and 2Q16 
group s at week 24, and in each group separately at week 52.
Patients will be evaluated for efficacy (bes t corrected visual acuity [BCVA] using 
the 4-meter Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] protocol, 
spectral domain o ptical coherence tomography [SD- OCT], and fluorescein 
angiography [FA]/fundus photography [FP]) and for ocular and systemic safety 
(including ophthalmic exams, visual field testing, and laboratory assessments) through week 100.
Patients who develop PDR, anterior segment neovascularization
(ASNV) , or DME 
in the study eye will qualify for rescue treatm ent.  If treatment is given, patient data 
will be censored for the primary analysis.

CONFIDENTIALIntravitreal aflibercept (2 mg) will be ma de available for patients who have central-
involved DME (CI-DME), PDR or ASNV in the fellow eye at screening (beginning 
on day 1), or are diagnosed during the trial.  
Standard of care treatment (eg, PRP ) will also be allowed for patients developing 
PDR in the fellow eye at any time during the trial.
Study Duration The study duration is 103 weeks, including the screening period.
Population
Sample Size:  Approximately 360 patients will be enro lled, and with a target enrollment of 
approximately 1 20 patients in each treatment group (1:1:1 ratio).
Target Population: The patient population will include men or women with type 1 or 2 diabetes 
mellitus who have moderately severe to severe NPDR (without DME threatening 
the center of the macula), in whom PRP can be safely deferred for at least 6
months.
For patients who meet eligibility criteria in both eyes, the eye with the most severe 
DRSS score will be selected as the study eye. If both eyes have equivalen t scores, 
factors such as ocular dominance and patient preference should be considered in 
making the selection.
Treatments
Study Drug
Dose/Route/Schedu
le:The investigational product is intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI), and will be 
administere d to the patients by IVT injection.
Study Eye
Patients will be randomly assigned to 1 o f 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio:
x2Q8:  aflibercept 2 mg Q8 to week 48 (after 5 initial monthly doses),
followed by a flexible treatment regimen with aflibercept 2 mg to week 96
x2Q16:  aflibercept 2 mg Q16 to week 96 (after 3 initial monthly doses and 1 
Q8 interval)
xSham:  sham injections every 4 weeks (Q4) to week 16, followed by sham 
injections Q8 to week 96
To preserve the masking, sham injections will be performe d for the 2Q8 and 2Q16 
group sat treatment visits in which patients  do not receive an active injection 
through week 96, and at all treatment visits for the sham group from baseline to 
week 96.  Masking will be maintained to the end of the study (week 100).
Endpoints
Primary: The primary outcome measure of the study is the proportion of patients who have improved by ≥2 steps from bas
eline in the DRSS score at week 24 in the combined 
2Q8 and 2Q16 groups, and at week 52 for each group separately.

CONFIDENTIALSecondary: The secondary outcome measures will be tested at week 52 and are as follows:
xProportion of patients developing a vision-threatening complication due to 
diabetic retinopathy
Vision-threatening complications are defined as composite outcome of 
PDR (inclusive of patients who have vitreous hemorrhage or tractional 
retinal detachment believed to be due to PDR) and ASNV
oNote:  ASNV is defined as neovascularization of the iris (at least 2 
cumulative clock hours), and/or definitive neovascularization of 
the iridocorneal angle
xProportion of patients who develop CI-DME
xTime to development of a vision-threatening complication
xTime to development of CI-DME
xProportion of patients who receive PRP, inclusive of patients undergoing 
vitrectomy with endolaser 
xArea under the curve (AUC) for change in BCVA from baseline
These outcome measures will also be tested at week 100in an exploratory manner 
for all 3 treatment groups.
Procedures and 
AssessmentsEfficacy and safety ocular procedures will include BCVA (ETDRS) and refraction, 
intraocular pressure (IOP), slit lamp examination ,gonioscopy, indirect 
ophthalmoscopy, SD -OCT, FA/FP, and visual field testing (study eye).
Overall safety will be assessed by evaluation of treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs), physical examinations, electroc ardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, and 
clinical safety laboratory tests (hematology, blood chemistry, hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], and urinalysis) at pr especified time points.  
Statistical Plan The primary efficacy variable is the proportion of patients with a ≥2 -step 
improvement from baseline in DRSS score in the study eye at week 24 in the 
combined 2Q8 and 2Q16 groups, and at week 52 for the 2Q8 and 2Q16 groups
separately .  Statistical testing of week 24 and week 52 will be conducted to 
demonstrate the superiority of the aflibercept  groups (combined, 2Q8, and 2Q16) to 
the sham group, respectively.
The primary efficacy variable analysis w ill be conducted on the full analysis set 
(FAS) population.  The primary analysis is a statistical evaluation of superiority of 
3comparisons (combined aflibercept vs. sham at week 24, aflibercept 2Q8 vs.
sham at week 52, and aflibercept 2Q16 v s. sham at week 52) in respect to the 
primary eff icacy variable. The statistical analysis will be performed using the 
Cochran-Mantel- Haenszel method, stratified by baseline DRSS level (level 47 vs. 
level 53).  Missing or n ongradable post- baseline values will be imputed using the 
last observation carried forward (LOCF) procedure. For any patient who receives 
rescue treatment, the measurements after re scue is given will be imputed using the

CONFIDENTIALlast observation prior to rescue treatment. Baseline values will be carried forward 
if all post -baseline observations are missing or nongradable.
Aflibercept treatment will be considered to  be superior to sham if the estimated 
aflibercept group (combined, aflibercept 2Q 8, or aflibercept 2Q16) is greater than 
the sham group, and the p -value is less than or equal to or statistically significant at 
a 1.67% level.
A hierarchical testing procedure will be performed for each dose group to compare 
the secondary efficacy variables between the respective aflibercept group and the 
sham group at week 52.
For a sensitivity analysis, the primary efficacy analysis will also be performed 
using all observed measurements (regardless of whether rescue treatment was 
given), and only true missing values will be imputed using the LOCF procedure.  
Baseline values will be carried forward if all post-baseline observations are missing
or nongradeable .
Safety Variabl es
Safety variables will be summarized on the safety analysis set (SAF) through week 
24 for the combined 2Q8 and 2Q16 group, and the sham group.  Safety data 
accumulated through week 52 and week 100 for each treatment group will be 
summarized at the respec tive time point.
Summaries of all TEAEs by treatment grou p, and by ocular study eye, ocular 
fellow eye, and non -ocular TEAEs, will include the number and percentage of 
patients with at least 1 TEAE.  Laboratory test results will be summarized by 
baseline and change from baseline to each scheduled assessment time with 
descriptive statistics. 
Sample Size
Anticipating approximately 4 1% of patients with a ≥2 -step improvement from 
baseline in DRSS score in either the 2Q8 or  2Q16 groups versus 17% in the sham 
group, 102 patients per group are required to detect a difference with a power of 90% for rejec
ting the null hypothesis at a 2-sided 1.67% (5%/3 ) significance level.  
A sample size of 102 patients per group will provide at least 90% power to detect a 
difference between the combined aflibercept group and sham group at week 24, if a38%
response rate is assumed in the combined aflibercept group.  To account for 
about a 15% dropout rate, 120 patients  per group will be enrolled.

CONFIDENTIAL1. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE
1.1. Introduction
Diabetes mellitus and its complications are a worl dwide health epidemic that is expected to 
increase.  In 2013, the World Health Organizati on estimated that 347 million people had diabetes 
and this number has been projected to increase to 366 million by 2030 and potentially more if 
rates of obesity continue to increase ( Wild 2004 ).  Despite early intervention programs and better 
methods of glycemic control, morbidity and mort ality as a consequence of diabetes, including 
diabetic retinopathy, are expected to rise.  Di abetic retinopathy is microvascular damage to the 
blood vessels in the retina, and it can progress to  vision-threatening stages including proliferative 
diabetic retinopathy (PDR), where new vessels that  are susceptible to hemorrhage grow initially 
from the retina and/or optic disc and extend be yond the internal limiting membrane, and diabetic 
macular edema (DME), where fluid accumulates disrupting the macular architecture and 
function.  Although there are treatments for DME (eg, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor 
[VEGF] agents), there is a significant unmet medical need for the treatment of diabetic 
retinopathy. More advanced retinopathy (prolif erative) is often treated with panretinal 
photocoagulation (PRP).  Although PRP may stop the progression of a proliferative disease, it is 
inherently destructive to the reti na and, therefore, likely to cause  visual symptoms such as visual 
field defects, reduced contrast sensitivity, and impaired night and color vision, and can also lead 
to exacerbation of macular edema ( Bressler 2011 ). There is currently no treatment for 
nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), and patients are observed until disease progresses 
sufficiently to warrant PRP.
Intravitreal (IVT) anti-VEGF therapy is currentl y the standard of care tr eatment for DME, and it 
has proven to be generally safe and effective in patients with DME.  In the phase 3 VISTA and 
VIVID studies of EYLEA®(aflibercept, known in the scientific literature and in clinical studies 
as VEGF Trap-Eye or intravitreal aflibercept injection [IAI]), patients treated with either 
aflibercept 2 mg every 4 weeks (2Q4) or aflibercept 2 mg every 8 weeks (2Q8) (following 
5 initial monthly doses) regimens gained 11.5 a nd 10.7 letters, respectively, in best corrected 
visual acuity (BCVA) at week 52 (data on file).  Similar visual acuity (VA) gains were seen in 
the RISE and RIDE studies of 0.3 and 0.5 mg Lucentis given monthly ( Brown 2013 ).
In addition to the effect on vision, improvements in diabetic retinopathy as measured by the 
Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (E TDRS) Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale 
(DRSS) were demonstrated in studies of EY LEA and Lucentis.  In the VISTA and VIVID 
studies, the proportion of patients showing a ≥2 -step improvement in DRSS at week 52 for the 
2Q4 and 2Q8 groups was 33.8% and 29.1% (VISTA) and 33.3% and 27.7% (VIVID), 
respectively ( Korobelnik 2014 ).  In order to confirm that these results would be consistent for a 
population with moderately severe to severe NPDR at baseline, a subgroup analysis was 
performed in patients with a ba seline DRSS score of level 47 or 53.  In this subgroup, as with the 
entire population, consistently more patients in the aflibercep t groups had a ≥2 -step improvement 
in DRSS (2Q4 = 49.6%, 2Q8 = 43.9%), as compared to  the laser group (16.7%) (data on file).  It 
is also worth noting that the proportion of patients with ≥2 -step improvement in DRSS both in 
the subgroup and the overall population at week 52 was similar at the earlier time point of 
week 24.

CONFIDENTIALDespite advances in treatment for DME, there ar e currently no approved treatments for NPDR in 
patients without DME, leaving patients at risk  for the development of DME and/or PDR.  Based 
on the evidence from the VISTA and VIVID studies in patients with DME showing that EYLEA (in addition to treating macular edema) also improves the underlying diabetic retinopathy, we 
propose to investigate EYLEA in patients with  moderately severe to severe NPDR who do not 
have DME by assessing the proportion of patients who improve by at least 2 steps on the DRSS.
This phase 3 study will assess the efficacy an d safety of IVT aflibercept in patients with 
moderately severe to severe NPDR.
Additional background information on the study drug can be foun d in the Investigator’s 
Brochure.
1.2. Rationale
1.2.1. Rationale for Study Design 
Patients with severe NPDR may have 20/20 vi sion and therefore experience no symptoms of 
their advancing disease.  Howe ver, profound vision loss can occur acu tely if the fragile, leaky 
vessels develop and either bleed into the vitr eous cavity or cause retinal traction and/or 
detachment ( Bressler 2011 ).  Therefore, slowing or haltin g the worsening of disease will 
minimize or completely avert these severe, often  irreversible, effects on vision in a patient
population for which there are no approved, or generally accepted, therapies.
The most comprehensive grading scale that has been developed for diabetic retinopathy was 
derived from the ETDRS.  This was a landm ark study that established the value of laser 
photocoagulation in managing diabetic retinopathy.  From this study, a systematic grading scale, 
the DRSS, was derived to predict progression from NPDR to PDR.
Based on the evidence from the VISTA and VIVID studies showing that aflibercept, in addition 
to treating macular edema, also improves the underl ying diabetic retinopathy in patients with 
severe NPDR, this study is designed to assess th e superiority of aflibercept when compared to 
sham in treating patients with moderately seve re to severe NPDR, by assessing the proportion of 
patients who improve by at least 2 steps on th e DRSS.  In the VISTA and VIVID studies, the 
2Q8 interval was shown to be effective in improvi ng the DRSS score in patients with macular 
edema.  However, as patients with moderatel y severe to severe NPDR who do not have 
concurrent DME are unlikely to be experiencing vi sion loss, a longer interval between physician 
visits and injections would be preferable.  Theref ore, a dosing regimen with a longer interval will 
be tested (aflibercept 2 mg every 16 weeks [2Q16]) in the current study, along with the 2Q8 
regimen.
1.2.2. Rationale for Dose Selection
The 2 mg dose of aflibercept is the same as the currently marketed dose of EYLEA and was used 
in the phase 3 DME studies, where improvemen t in underlying diabetic retinopathy was 
demonstrated.

2.1. Primary Objective
The primary objective of the study is to assess th e efficacy of IVT aflibercept compared to sham 
treatment in the improvement of moderately severe to severe NPDR.
2.2. Secondary Objectives
The secondary objectives of the study are:
xTo characterize the safety of IVT aflibercept in patients with moderately severe to 
severe NPDR 
xTo determine if IVT aflibercept will pre vent the worsening of diabetic retinopathy 
and reduce the incidence of DME
xTo determine the anatomic effects of IVT af libercept in patients with moderately 
severe to severe NPDR
3. STUDY DESIGN
3.1. Study Description and Duration
This is a phase 3, double-masked, randomized study of the efficacy and safety of IVT aflibercept 
for the improvement of moderately severe to severe NPDR.
After providing informed consent, pa tients will be assessed for study eligibility at the screening 
visit, up to 3 weeks before day 1/baseline.  At the day 1/baseline visit, patients will undergo 
safety assessments prior to receiving the first dose of study drug.
Eligible patients will be enrolled into 1 of 3 treatment groups in a 1: 1:1 randomization scheme, 
and will be stratified based on their DRSS scor e (level 47 vs. level 53). Only 1 eye will be 
selected as the study eye. The 3 treatment groups will have the following dosing regimens from 
day 1 to week 48: 1) 2Q8 aflibercept IVT after 5 initial monthly doses; 2) 2Q16 aflibercept IVT 
after 3 initial monthly doses and 1 8-week in terval; and 3) sham treatment (see section 5.1). In 
year 2 (beginning at week 56), the 2Q8 group will be treated with a flexible treatment regimen
(see section 5.3).
The primary outcome measure of the study is the proportion of patients who have improved by 
≥2 steps from baseline on the DRSS in the combined  2Q8 and 2Q16 groups at week 24, and in 
each group separately at week 52.  Patients will be evaluated for efficacy (BCVA using the 
4-meter ETDRS protocol, spectr al domain optical coherence tomography [SD-OCT], and 
fluorescein angiography [FA]/fundus photography [FP]) and for ocular and systemic safety 
(including ophthalmic exams, visual field testin g, and laboratory assessments) through week 100 
(Figure 1 ).
Patients who develop PDR, anterior segment ne ovascularization (ASNV), or DME will qualify 
for rescue treatment (see section 5.2).  If treatment is given, patien t data will be censored for the 
primary analysis.

No formal interim analysis is planned.
3.3. Study Committees 
3.3.1. Safety Monitoring Team
A safety monitoring team (SMT) at Regeneron will  meet at scheduled times during the study to 
review masked safety data.  These data may include, but are not limited to:
xTreatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) th at result in an early study withdrawal
xSerious adverse events (SAEs)
xFatal events
xIdentified and potential risks for IVT aflibercept
Appropriate action, if needed, will be taken ba sed upon these reviews and in consultation with 
the medical monitor.
3.3.2. Other Safety Committee
Potential arterial thrombotic events will be ev aluated by a masked adjudication committee 
according to criteria formerly appl ied and published by the Anti- Platelet Trialists’ Collaboration 
prior to database unmasking ( Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration 1994; 
Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration 2002 ).  An arterial thrombotic event is defined as a 
nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal ischemic stroke, nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke, or death resulting from vascular or unknown causes.  Additi onal details regarding data to be collected can 
be found in the study procedure manual.

A patient has the right to withdraw from the st udy at any time, for any reason, and without 
repercussion.
The investigator and sponsor have the right to w ithdraw a patient from the study in the event of 
an intercurrent illness, adverse event (AE), tr eatment failure, protocol violation, cure, and for 
administrative, or other reasons .  An excessive rate of withdrawals would render the study 
uninterpretable; therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of patients should be avoided.
Patients who withdraw prematurely from the study will be asked to complete study assessments 
per section 6.2.1 .
4.4. Replacement of Patients
Patients prematurely discontinued from the study will not be replaced.

CONFIDENTIAL5.2. Rescue Treatment in the Study Eye
Patients who develop PDR, ASNV, or central-i nvolved DME (CI-DME) in the study eye may be 
treated, if deemed appropriate by the masked phy sician.  For any of these complications, an FP 
must be performed before rescue treatment is given.
Patients who develop CI-DME may re ceive IVT aflibercept (refer to EYLEA USPI 2015 ) or 
laser photocoagulation, and will no longer receive their randomized treatment.  Rescue treatment 
may be given by the masked or unmasked physician.
Patients who develop PDR and/or ASNV may recei ve PRP or vitrectomy with endolaser, if 
necessary, but will remain on their randomized  treatment schedule. Panretinal photocoagulation 
or surgical intervention may be performed by  either the masked or unmasked physician. In 
addition, 1 injection of aflibercept may be give n, which must be administered by the unmasked 
physician.
If treatment for DME, ASNV, or PDR is given, pa tient data will be censored from the time of 
treatment for the primary analysis.
5.3. Flexible Treatment in the 2Q8 Group in the Study Eye
Beginning at week 56, patients randomized to the 2Q8 group will receive aflibercept using a 
flexible treatment regimen.  An injection will be given at each visit unless a patient has reached 
Level 35 or better (mild NPDR) on the DRSS (as determined by the masked investigator), at 
which point treatment will be deferred (and a sh am injection given). Level 35 can be clinically 
defined as microaneurysms plus venous loops , hard exudates, cotton wool spots, and/or mild 
retinal hemorrhages (less than present in ET DRS standard photograph 2a in up to 3 quadrants 
[see also study procedure manua l]). The determination whether Level 35 or better has been 
reached will be assessed by the mask ed investigator at each visit on FP.
To maintain masking, all treatment groups will be  assessed (using FP) for flexible treatment 
criteria from week 56 to week 96, but the 2Q16 g roup will continue to receive treatment every 
16 weeks and the sham group will continue to  receive sham injections at every visit.
5.4. Dose Modification and Study Drug Discontinuation Rules
5.4.1. Dose Modification
Dose modification for an indi vidual patient is not allowed.
5.4.2. Study Drug Discontinuation
Patients who permanently discontinue from st udy drug and who do not withdraw from the study 
will be asked to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits per the visit schedule.
Patients who opt to withdraw from the study wi ll be asked to complete study assessments, per 
section 6.2.1 .

CONFIDENTIAL5.5. Method of Treatment Assignment
Approximately 360 patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either aflibercept 2Q8, 
aflibercept 2Q16, or sham according to a ce ntral randomization scheme provided by an 
interactive voice response system (IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS) to the designated study pharmacist (or qualified design ee).  Randomization will be stratified according 
to the patient’s DRSS level (level 47 vs. level 53 at the scree ning visit).
5.5.1. Masking
To preserve the masking, sham injections will  be performed for the 2Q8 and 2Q16 groups at
treatment visits in which patients do not receiv e an active injection through week 96; sham 
injections will be performed at all treatment visits for the sham group from baseline to week 96. 
Weeks 52 and 100 are nontreatment visits.
A masked physician will be assigned to do the fo llowing:  1) assess AEs, and 2) perform the 
masked assessment of efficacy.  A separate, unmaske d physician will administer treatment in the 
study eye (ie, perform study drug injection or sham injection) ( Table 1 ).
The unmasked physician or designee will not have  any role in the study beyond the receipt, 
tracking, preparation, destruction, administration of study drug, and assessing safety during the 
observation period following study drug administ ration. The masked physician will determine if 
a patient has developed DME, ASNV, or PDR in th e study eye, and will be responsible for 
recommending treatment, which will be admini stered by the unmasked physician. Once it has 
been determined that a patient has progressed to DME, ASNV, or PDR, treatment may be given by either the masked or unmasked physician.  Beginning at week 56, the masked physician will 
assess whether a patient has a DRSS Level 35 or be tter in the study eye using FP, to determine 
the need for flexible treatment. The unmasked ph ysician will administer sham or active treatment 
per protocol.
Every effort must be made to ensure that all other study site personnel other than those 
designated as unmasked remain masked to treatment assignment.
Masked and unmasked roles will be assumed for the entire study, and switching from an 
unmasked to a masked role after the first patient is randomized at a site is not permitted.  Any 
deviation to the roles above must first be a pproved by the sponsor.  This must be properly 
documented before any patients are treated, and th e Site Signature and Delegation Log must be 
maintained as new personnel are added to the study team.

All drug compliance records must be kept curren t and must be made available for inspection by 
the sponsor and regulatory agency inspectors.
5.7. Concomitant Medications and Procedures
Any treatment administered from the time of inf ormed consent to the final study visit will be 
considered concomitant medication.  This includes medications that were started before the study 
and are ongoing during the study.
If a pretreatment concomitant medication is admini stered in the study eye before injection (eg, 
antibiotic or anesthetic), it must be admini stered for both active and sham treatment.
5.7.1. Prohibited Medicati ons and Procedures 
Patients may not receive any medications (approved or investigational) for their diabetic 
retinopathy in the study eye other than the assign ed study treatment (aflibercept or sham) as 
specified in this protocol, unless they have developed PDR, ASNV, or DME (in which case they 
may be treated as indicated in section 5.2) or completed the end of study (week 100) visit 
assessments.  This includes medications administered  locally (eg, IVT, topical, juxtascleral or 
periorbital routes), as well as those administered systemically, with the intent of treating the 
study and/or fellow eye.

Fellow Eye
Intravitreal aflibercept (2 mg) will be made avai lable for patients who have CI-DME, PDR or 
ASNV in the fellow eye at study start (beginning  on day 1), or are diagnosed during the trial 
(refer to EYLEA USPI 2015 ).
Standard of care treatment (eg, PRP) will also be allowed for patients developing PDR in the 
fellow eye at any time during the trial.
The patient’s fellow eye may receive treatment on the same day a s  t h e  s t u d y  e y e  o r  a t  a n  
unscheduled visit.  All fellow eye treatments must be recorded on the electronic case report form 
(CRF) as a concomitant medication and/or procedure for  the fellow eye.  The fellow eye will not 
be considered an additional study eye.  Patients  who receive treatment for the fellow eye will not 
be required to be withdrawn from the study.  Sa fety of the fellow eye will be monitored and all 
AEs will be collected.  Other conditions in the fellow eye may be treated with approved 
therapies.
Any other medications that are considered necessary for the patient’s welfare, and that ar e not 
expected to interfere with the evaluation of the study drug, may be given at the discretion of the 
investigator.

clinic to complete the visit 11 assessments, as described in Table 2 . Patients who are withdrawn 
from the study after week 52/visit 11 will be asked to return to the clinic for week 100/visit 18 assessments, as described in Table 3 .
6.2.2. Unscheduled Visits
All attempts should be made to keep patients on the study schedule.  However, unscheduled 
visits may be necessary to evaluate or repeat tes ting following abnormal laboratory results, for 
follow-up of AEs, for rescue treatment for the stud y eye, for treatment of the fellow eye, or for 
any other reason, as warranted.
6.3. Study Procedures
6.3.1. Procedures Performed Only at the Screening/Baseline Visit
For women of childbearing potential, a negative se rum pregnancy test at screening is required for 
eligibility.
6.3.2. Ocular Procedures (Efficacy and Safety)
6.3.2.1. Best Corrected Visual Acuity 
Visual function of the study eye and the fellow eye will be assessed us ing the ETDRS protocol 
(The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Group 1985 ) at 4 meters at each study visit, as 
specified in Table 2 and Table 3 .  Visual acuity examiners must be certified to ensure consistent 
measurement of BCVA.  The VA examiner must remain masked to treatment assignment.  Best 
corrected visual acuity should be done before any other ocular procedures are performed.  A 
detailed protocol for conducting VA testing and re fraction can be found in the study procedure 
manual.
6.3.2.2. Intraocular Pressure
Intraocular pressure of the study eye will be mea sured at every visit using Goldmann applanation 
tonometry or Tono-pen™, as specified in Table 2 and Table 3 .  The same method of IOP 
measurement must be used throughout the study for each individual patient.  Intraocular pressure 
will be measured pre-dose (bilateral) by the masked physician (or designee), and at 
approximately 30 minutes post-dose (study eye) by the unmasked physician (or designee).
6.3.2.3. Slit Lamp Examination
Patients’ anterior eye structure and ocular adnexa will be exam ined bil aterally pre-dose at each 
study visit using a slit lamp (study procedure manua l) by the masked investigator, as specified in

Patients will be evaluated for the development of neovascularization of the iridocorneal angle by 
gonioscopy in conjunction with slit lamp biom icroscopy. The examination should be performed 
in the study eye only before the application of mydriatic agents, as specified in Table 2 and 
Table 3 , or if frank rubeosis is present.
6.3.2.5. Indirect Ophthalmoscopy 
Patients’ posterior pole and peripheral retina will be examined  by indirect ophthalmoscopy a t
each study visit pre-dose (bilateral) by the masked investigator and post-dose (study eye) by the 
unmasked investigator, as specified in Table 2 and Table 3 .  Post-dose evaluation must be 
performed immediately after injection (active drug or sham).
6.3.2.6. Fundus Photography/Fluorescein Angiography
The anatomical state of the retinal vasculature and the DRSS level will be evaluated by FA and 
FP as specified in Table 2 and Table 3 . The study eye will be the transit eye. Fundus 
photography and FA will be captured and transmit ted to an independent reading center for both 
eyes.
An FP must be performed once a patient has been diagnosed with PDR, ASNV, or CI-DME in 
the study eye, and before rescue treatment is given.
Fundus and angiographic images will be sent to an independent reading center where images will 
be read by masked readers.  All FPs and FAs will  be archived at the site as part of the source 
documentation.  Photographers must be certified by the reading center to ensure consistency and 
quality in image acquisition.  Ev ery effort will be made to ensure that all photographers at the 
site remain masked to treatment assignment.   A detailed protocol for image acquisition and 
transmission can be found in the study procedure manual.
For sites that will capture FA images on the Optos®Ultra-Widefield Imaging system, axial 
length must be measured in both eyes at baseline using any appropriate method.
6.3.2.7. Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography
Retinal characteristics will be evaluated at ever y visit using SD-OCT.  Images will be captured 
and transmitted for both eyes.  Images will be sent to an independent reading center where they will be read by masked readers.  All OCTs will be electronically archived at the study sites as 
part of the source documentation.  Optical coherence tomography te chnicians must be certified 
by the reading center to ensure consistency and quality in image acquisition.  Every effort will be 
made to ensure that OCT technicians at the study site remain masked to treatment assignment.  A 
detailed protocol for acceptable OCT machines a nd OCT image acquisition/ transmission can be

7. SAFETY DEFINITIONS, REPORTING, AND MONIT ORING
7.1. Definitions
7.1.1. Adverse Event
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a study drug which may or 
may not have a causal relationship with the study drug.  Therefore, an AE is a ny unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal labor atory finding), symptom, or disease which is 
temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.
An AE also includes any worsening (ie, any cli nically significant change in frequency and/or 
intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug.

CONFIDENTIAL7.1.2. Serious Adverse Event
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
xResults in death –includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely 
unrelated to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient is a passenger).
xIs life-threatening –in the view of the investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event. This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.
xRequires in-patient hospitalization orprolongation of existing hospitalization .
In-patient hospitalization is defined as admission to a hospital or an emergency room 
for longer than 24 hours.  Prolongation of existing hospitalization is defined as a 
hospital stay that is longer than was originally anticipated for the event, or is 
prolonged due to the development of a new AE as determined by the investigator or
treating physician.
xResults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).
xIs a congenital anomaly/birth defect
xIs an important medical event - Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient ormay require intervention to prevent 1 of the other serious outcomes listed above 
(eg, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse).
An ocular important medical event may include the following:
xAn AE that requires either surgical or medical intervention to prevent permanent loss 
of vision
xSubstantial, unexplained vision loss or an AE that causes substantial vision loss
7.2. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events
7.2.1. Adverse Events
The investigator (or designee) will record all AE s that occur from the time the informed consent 
is signed until the end of study.  Refer to the study procedure manual for the procedures to be 
followed.
Information on follow-up for AEs is provided in section 7.2.6 .  Laboratory, vital signs, or ECG

CONFIDENTIAL7.2.2. Serious Adverse Events
All SAEs, regardless of assessment of causal rela tionship to study drug must be reported to the 
sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours.  Refer to the study procedure manual for the procedure to 
be followed.
Information not available at the time of the init ial report must be documented in a follow-up 
report.  Substantiating data such as relevan t hospital or medical records and diagnostic test 
reports may also be requested.
The investigator must promptly report to the In stitutional Review Boa rd (IRB) all unanticipated 
problems involving risks to patients.  This include s death from any cause and all SAEs related to 
the use of the study drug.  It is recommended that all SAEs be reported to the IRB, regardless of 
assessed causality.
In the event the investigator is informed of an  SAE after the patient completes the study, the 
following will apply:
xSAE with an onset within 30 days of the end of study/early termination visit - the
SAE will be reported to the sponsor.  The investigator should make every effort to 
obtain follow-up information on the outcome until the event is considered chronic 
and/or stable.
xSAE with an onset day greater than 30 days from the end of study/early termination 
visit - only fatal SAEs and those deemed by the investigator to be drug-related SAEs will be reported to the sponsor.  The investigator should make every effort to obtain 
follow-up information on the outcome of a drug-related SAE until the event is 
considered chronic and/or stable.
7.2.3. Other Events that Require Accelerated Reporting
The following events also require reporting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of 
learning of the event:
Symptomatic Overdose of Study Drug: Accidental or intentional overdose of at least 
2 times the intended dose of study drug within the intended therapeutic window, if associated with an AE,
Pregnancy: Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the 
investigator to report to the sponsor (or designee), by telephone within 
24 hours of identification, any pregnancy occurring in a female patient or
female partner of a male patient, during the study or within 90 days of the last dose of study drug.  Any complication of  pregnancy affecting a female study 
patient or female partner of a male study patient, and/or fetus and/or newborn 
must be reported as an SAE.
Refer to the study procedure manual for the procedures to be followed.

All AEs that lead to a patient ’s withdrawal from the study must be reported to the sponsor’s 
medical monitor within 30 days.
Refer to the study procedure manual for the procedures to be followed.
7.2.5. Abnormal Laboratory, Vital Signs, or Electrocardiogram Results
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an 
AE include:
xthe test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or
xthe test result requires additional diagnos tic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or
xthe test result leads to a change in dosing (outside of protocol-stipulated dose 
adjustments), discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy
Contact the medical monitor in the event the investigator feels that an abnormal test finding 
should be reported as an AE, although it  does not meet any of the above criteria.
Repeating an abnormal test, in th e absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an 
AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an 
AE.
Evaluation of severity of laboratory abnormalitie s will be assessed according to the scale 
outlined in section 7.3.1 .
7.2.6. Follow-up
Adverse event information will be collected until the patient ’s last study visit.
Serious adverse event information will be collected  until the event is considered chronic and/or 
stable.
7.3. Evaluation of Severity and Causality
7.3.1. Evaluation of Severity
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following scale:
xMild: Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient ’s normal 
functioning level.  It may be an annoyance.  Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief of symptoms, but may be given because of personality of the patient.
xModerate: Produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to health.  
It is uncomfortable or an embarrassment.   Treatment for symptom may be needed.
xSevere: Produces significant impairment of fu nctioning or incapacitation and is a 
definite hazard to the patient ’s health.  Treatment for symptom may be given and/or 
patient hospitalized.

Relationship of AEs to Study Drug:
The relationship of AEs to study drug will be a ssessed by the masked investigator, and will be a 
clinical decision based on all available information.  The following question will be addressed:
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by the study drug?The possible answers are:
Not Related: There is no reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by 
the study drug
Related: There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by 
the study drug
For a list of factors to consider in assessi ng the relationship of AEs to study drug, see 
Appendix 2 .
The sponsor will request information to justify th e causality assessment of SAEs, as needed.
Relationship of AEs to Injection Procedure:
The relationship of AEs to injection procedure will  be assessed by the masked investigator, and 
will be a clinical decision based on all availa ble information.  The following question will be 
addressed:
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by the injection procedure?
The possible answers are:
Not Related: There is no reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by 
the injection procedure
Related: There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by 
the injection procedure
For a list of factors to consider in assessing the relationship of AEs to the injection procedure,

CONFIDENTIALFor each test, let p t(and p c) be the true proportion of patients with a ≥2 -step improvement from 
baseline in DRSS score at week 24 for the comb ined 2Q8 and 2Q16 groups, and at week 52 for 
the 2Q8 and 2Q16 groups separately (and the sham group, p c).
The following hypotheses will be tested:
H0: pt= p cversus H 1: pt≠ p c
To control the family-wise type I error rate of 5%, primary efficacy endpoints for the combined 
group (week 24) and endpoints for the 2Q8 and 2Q16 groups (week 52) will be tested separately 
at the significance level of α = 1.67% (5%/3 ).  Secondary efficacy endpoints at week 52 will be 
tested for the 2Q8 and 2Q16 groups by the hierarch ical testing procedure at the significance level

9.2. Justification of Sample Size
Anticipating approximately 41% of patients with a ≥2 -step improvement from baseline in DRSS 
score in either the 2Q8 or 2Q16 groups versus 17%  in the sham group, 102 patients per group are 
required to detect a difference with a power of 90% for rejecting the null hypothesis at a 2-sided 
1.67% (5%/3) significance level.  A sample size of 102 patients per group will provide at least 
90% power to detect a difference between th e combined aflibercept group and sham group at 
week 24, if a 38% response rate is assumed in the combined aflibercept group. The assumption 
of the proportions for the aflibercept group and sham group is based on VIVID and VISTA data 
at a given time point.  To account for about a 15% dropout rate, 120 patients per group will be 
enrolled. 
The sample size calculation was computed using the Chi square test (continuity corrected) from 
the commercial software nQuery nTerm 7.0.

Demographic variables and baseline  characteristics will be summarized by treatment group and 
pooled aflibercept treatment groups for the FAS a nd SAF, depending on the type of data, as 
described in section 9.5.  Medical history will be coded by  Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA®) codes, and prior and c oncomitant medications by Anatomical Therapeutic 
Chemical (ATC) codes (World Health Organization Drug Dictionary).  No formal comparison 
between treatment groups will be conducted.
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be  summarized descriptively by treatment group.
9.5.2. Efficacy Analyses
Efficacy analyses of all efficacy variables defined in section 8.2will be conducted using the FAS 
population.  Missing values will be imputed with post-baseline values during the ontreatment 
period by using the last observation carry forward (LOCF) procedure. For any patient who 
receives rescue treatment, measurements after resc ue is given will be imputed using the last 
observation prior to rescue treatment.
The primary endpoint analysis for the study will  be conducted at 2 time points (week 24 for the 
combined 2Q8 and 2Q16 groups, and week 52 for the 2Q8 and 2Q16 groups separately).  Each 
of the primary efficacy analyses will be tested at the 1.67% (5%/3) significance level to control 
for multiplicity.
The secondary endpoints described in section 8.2for both groups (2Q8 and 2Q16) will be tested 
in a hierarchical manner at week 52, as described in section 9.1.
Primary Efficacy Analysis for the Combined 2Q8 and 2Q16 Groups at Week 24 
This analysis will be conducted on the FAS and will include the primary efficacy endpoint at 
week 24 for the combined 2Q8 and 2Q16 groups only.
Primary Efficacy Analysis for the 2Q8 and 2Q16 Groups at Week 52 
This analysis will be conducted on the FAS and will include the primary efficacy endpoint at 
week 52 for the 2Q8 and 2Q16 groups separately.
9.5.2.1. Analyses of Primary and Secondary Efficacy Variables
Primary Efficacy Variable
The primary efficacy variable analysis will  be conducted on the FAS population. The primary 
analysis is a statistical evaluati on of superiority of 3 comparisons (combined aflibercept vs. sham 
at week 24, aflibercept 2Q8 vs. sham at week 52, and aflibercept 2Q16 vs. sham at week 52) in 
respect to the primary efficacy variable (see section 8.2). The statistical analysis will be 
performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method, stratified by baseline DRSS level (level 
47 vs. level 53). Missing or nongradable post-baseline  values will be imputed using the LOCF 
procedure. For any patient who receives rescue treatment, the measurements after rescue is 
given will be imputed using the last observation pri or to rescue treatment. Baseline values will 
be carried forward if all post-baseline observations are missing or nongradable.

CONFIDENTIALAflibercept treatment will be cons idered to be superior to sham if the estimated aflibercept group
(combined, aflibercept 2Q8, or aflibercept 2Q16) is greater than the sham group, and the p-value 
is less than or equal to or statistically significant at a 1.67% level.
As stated above, for the primary efficacy analysis, any patient who receives rescue treatment in 
the study eye will have all efficacy measurements  collected after rescue treatment is imputed 
using the last observation prior to such treatment. For a sensitivity analysis, the primary efficacy analysis will also be performed using all obs erved measurements (regardless of whether rescue 
treatment was given), and only true missing valu es will be imputed using the LOCF procedure. 
Baseline values will be carried forward if all post-baseline observations are missing or 
nongradable.
Secondary Efficacy Variables
If at least one of the aflibercept groups is shown to  be superior to sham in the primary variable, 
additional comparisons will be made for this af libercept group with resp ect to the secondary 
variables at week 52, using the significance level specified in section 9.1.
A hierarchical testing procedure will be performed for each dose group to compare the secondary 
variables between the respective aflibercept group and sham in the following order:

CONFIDENTIALThe p-values at week 52 for the secondary endpoints will be reported for all comparisons 
between the aflibercept groups and the sham group; however, a superiority claim can be made 
for a given endpoint only if all preceding endpoint comparisons in the hierarchy are shown to be 
statistically significant at a significance level specified in section 9.1. The hierarchical method 
ensures the overall type I error rate of 5% for this study, with multiplicity adjustment for primary 
and secondary endpoint analyses.
All endpoints will also be analyzed descriptively at week 100 in an exploratory manner. 
The analysis of proportion variables will be done using the same methodology as for the analyses 
of the primary efficacy variable described in this section.
For continuous variables (ie, BCVA), an analysis  of covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline 
measurements of the continuous variable as covari ates and treatment and baseline DRSS score 
(level 47 vs. level 53) stratification as fixed fact ors will be used for the endpoint. The pair-wise 
comparisons of each aflibercept group versus sh am will be done in the ANCOVA model. In 
addition, 2-sided 95% confidence in tervals for the difference of each aflibercept group minus 
sham will be calculated.
Time to first vision-threatening co mplication (composite of PDR [inclu sive of patients who have 
vitreous hemorrhage or tractiona l retinal detachment believed to  be due to PDR] and ASNV) will 
be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier estimates. A log-rank test will be performed, comparing 
sham with the aflibercept groups, as well as 2-si ded 95% confidence intervals for the time to first 
vision-threatening complication for the di fference of each comparison group. Time to 
development of CI-DME will be analyzed similarly.
Similar to the analysis of the primary endpoint, any patient who receives rescue treatment in the 
study eye will have all efficacy measurements co llected after rescue treatment imputed using the 
last observation prior to such treatment.  For a se nsitivity analysis, the primary efficacy analysis 
will also be performed using all observed measur ements (regardless of whether rescue treatment 
was given) and only true missing values will be imputed using the LOCF procedure.  Baseline
values will be carried forward if all post-baseline observations are missing.
Analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints may also be performed on subsets of the FAS, 
such as patients who have developed CI-DME, PDR, or patients who have had a vitrectomy.  
Such subsets will be defined in the SAP.
9.5.2.2. Analyses of Additional Efficacy Variables
All additional efficacy variables (see section 8.3) will be analyzed descriptively.  In addition, the 
primary and secondary variables will be also analyzed descriptively at week 100.  These 
descriptive analyses may include statistical tests on the proportion for the efficacy variables, in 
the same way as described for the primary and secondary efficacy variable analyses (see section 9.5.2.1 ).
The analysis of categorical variables will be  done using the same methodology used for the 
analysis of the primary efficacy variable described in section 9.5.2.1 . Analyses of continuous 
variables (eg, central retina l thickness, median deviation on visual field) will use a 2-way

xIf the start date of an AE or concomitant medic ation is incomplete or missing, it will be 
assumed to have occurred on or after the intake of study medication, except if an 
incomplete date (eg, month and year) clearly indicates that the event started prior to 
treatment.  If the partial date indicates the same month or year of the intake of study 
medication date, then the start date by the study medication intake date will be imputed; 
otherwise, the missing day or month by the first day or the first month will be imputed. 
xNo imputations for missing laboratory data, ECG data, vital sign data, or physical 
examination data will be made.
Visit windows:
xAssessments taken outside of protocol allowable windows will be displayed according to 
the CRF assessment recorded by the investigator.
Unscheduled assessments:
xExtra assessments (laboratory data or vital signs associated with nonprotocol clinical 
visits or obtained in the course of investigating or managing AEs) will be included in 
listings, but not summaries.  If more than 1 laboratory value is available for a given visit, 
the first observation will be used in summaries and all observations will be presented in listings.

It is the responsibility of both the sponsor and the investigator(s) to ensure that this clinical study 
will be conducted in accordance with the ethi cal principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and that are consistent wi th the ICH guidelines for GCP and applicable 
regulatory requirements.
13.2. Informed Consent
The principles of informed consent are described in ICH guidelines for GCP.
The ICF used by the investigator must be re viewed and approved by the sponsor prior to 
submission to the appropriate IRB.  A copy of the IRB-approved ICF and documentation of 
approval must be provided to the sponsor before st udy drug will be shipped to the study site.
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee (if acceptable by local regulations) to obtain 
written informed consent from each patient prior to his/her participation in the study and after the 
aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of th e study have been explained to the patient
in language that he/she can understand.  The ICF s hould be signed and dated by the patient and 
by the investigator or authorized designee who reviewed the ICF with the patient.
xPatients who can write but cannot read will have the ICF read to them before signing 
and dating the ICF.
xPatients who can understand but who can neit her write nor read will have the ICF 
read to them in presence of an impartial witness, who will sign and date the ICF toconfirm that informed consent was given.
The original ICF must be retained by the investigator as part of the patient's study record, and a 
copy of the signed ICF must be given to the patient.
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment, the ICF 
must be reviewed and updated appropriately.  Al l study patients must be informed of the new 
information and provide their written c onsent if they wish to continue in the study.  The original 
signed revised ICF must be maintained in the patient ’s study record and a copy must be given to 
the patient.
13.3. Patient Confidentiality and Data Protection
The investigator must take all appropriate measures to ensure that the anonymity of each study patient will be maintained.  Patients should be  identified by their initials and a patient
identification number, only, on CRFs or other documents submitted to the sponsor.  Documents 
that will not be submitted to the sponsor (eg, signed ICF) must be kept in strict confidence.
The patient's and investigator's personal data, which may be included in the sponsor database, 
will be treated in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.  The sponsor shall take all 
appropriate measures to safeguard and prevent acc ess to this data by any unauthorized third 
party.

CONFIDENTIAL13.4. Institutional Review Board 
An appropriately constituted IRB,  as described in ICH guidelines for GCP, must review and 
approve:
xThe protocol, ICF, and any other materials to be provided to the patients
(eg, advertising) before any patient may be enrolled in the study
xAny amendment or modification to the study protocol or ICF before implementation, 
unless the change is necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to the patients, in which case the IRB should be informed as soon as possible
xOngoing studies on an annual basis or at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk
In addition, the IRB should be informed of any event li kely to affect the safety of patients or the 
continued conduct of the clinical study.
A copy of the IRB approval letter with a curren t list of the IRB members and their functions 
must be received by the sponsor prior to ship ment of drug supplies to the investigator.  The 
approval letter should include the study number and title, the documents reviewed, and the date
of the review.
Records of the IRB review and approval of all st udy documents (including approval of ongoing 
studies) must be kept on file by the investigator.
14. PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS
The sponsor may not implement a change in the design or operation of the protocol or ICF 
without an IRB-approved amendment.
15. PREMATURE TERMINATION OF THE STUDY OR 
CLOSE-OUT OF A SITE
15.1. Premature Termination of the Study
The sponsor has the right to terminate the study prematurely.  Reasons may include efficacy, 
safety, or futility, among others.  Should the sponsor decide to terminate the study, the 
investigator(s) will be notified in writing.
15.2. Close-out of a Site
The sponsor and the investigator have the right to close-out a site prematurely.
Investigator’s Decision
The investigator must notify the sponsor of a desire  to close-out a site in writing, providing at 
least 30 days’ notice.  The final decision should be made throu gh mutual agreement with the 
sponsor.  Both parties will arrange the close-out procedures after review and consultation.

CONFIDENTIALSponsor’s Decision
The sponsor will notify the investigator(s) of a deci sion to close-out a study site in writing.  
Reasons may include the following, among others: 
xThe investigator has received all items and information necessary to perform the 
study, but has not enrolled any patient within a reasonable period of time
xThe investigator has violated any fundamental obligation in the study agreement, 
including but not limited to, breach of this protocol (and any applicable amendments), 
breach of the applicable laws and regulations, or breach of any applicable ICH 
guidelines 
xThe total number of patients required for th e study are enrolled earlier than expected
In all cases, the appropriate IRB and Health Authorities must be informed according to 
applicable regulatory requirements, and adequate c onsideration must be given to the protection 
of the patient s’ interests.
16. STUDY DOCUMENTATION
16.1. Certification of Accuracy of Data
A declaration assuring the accuracy and content of the data recorded on th e CRFs must be signed 
by the investigator.  This certification form accomp anies each set of CRFs.  The signed form will 
be provided to the sponsor with the final set of CRFs for each patient.
16.2. Retention of Records
The investigator must retain all essential study documents, including ICFs, source documents, investigator copies of CRFs, and drug accountability records for at least 15 years following the completion or discontinuation of the study, or long er if a longer period is required by relevant 
regulatory authorities.  The investigator must consult with the sponsor before discarding or 
destroying any essential study documents following study completion or discontinuation.  Records must be destroyed in a ma nner that ensures confidentiality.
If the investigator's personal situation is such that archiving can no longer be ensured, the 
investigator must inform the sponsor and the relevan t records will be transferred to a mutually 
agreed-upon destination.

CONFIDENTIALAPPENDIX 1. OPTICAL COHERENCE 
TOMOGRAPHY - ANGIOGRAPHY SUB-STUDY
This is an exploratory study for OCT-angiography conducted as a sub-study to protocol 
VGFTe-OD-1411.  Investigational sites that are participating in VGFTe-OD-1411 may choose to 
participate in this optional, exploratory OCT- angiography sub-study.  In order to participate, 
sites must have the Optovue Angio-vue system installed.
A. OCT-Angiography Sub-study Objective
The objective of this sub-study is to explore the use of OCT-angiography to monitor vascular 
leak and other disease characteristics in patients with diabetic retinopathy treated with aflibercept 
versus sham.  Since OCT-angiography has the ability to image vessels based on fluid flow 
characteristics, and more accuratel y, delineate the vascular laye rs, it may provide additional 
information related to treatment response beyond that achievable with standard OCT imaging.
B. Number of Patients and Sites
Patients will be enrolled at the inv estigator’s discretion at sites  that have access to the Optovue 
Angio-vue system.  There will be no cap on the number of patients or sites that may participate.
C. Timing of OCT-Angiography
Optical coherence tomography-angiography will be performed approximately quarterly at the 
time points indicated in Table 1 and Table 2, in conjunction with the scheduled study visits for 
the main study.

 1 Background  
1.1 Investigational Agent  
 Perfluoropropane gas (PFP or C 3F8) (Air Liquide, DMF #16400)  
1.2 Preclinical Data  
 Various laboratories around the world have successfully used PFx gas mixtures to image 
morphology and function in animal lungs in vivo and in ex- vivo human lungs. Likely the first 
use of PFx gases in an animal study was in 1984 ( 20) where perfluoromethane mi xed with 
oxygen was compared to Xenon ventilation CT studies in dogs. There was little additional activity in the field until 1998 when Kuethe’s group demonstrated the use of perfluoroethane 
mixed with oxygen to image rat lungs using 19F MRI and respirator y triggered imaging (13 ). 
Two years later Schreiber’s group demonstrated ‘breath- hold’ imaging of the lungs of ventilated 
pigs using SF6 and ‘ultrafast’ MRI (24). The same group evaluated dynamic imaging including 
wash -in/washout kinetics of pulmonary vent ilation in 2001, again in ventilated pigs (23). 
Kauczor reviewed various strategies for lung ventilation assessment using MRI in 2002 and cited 
six animal studies using PFx gases for such purposes (11). Jacob et al. demonstrated imaging of 
ventilation and diffusion in diseased and healthy excised human lungs as well as in 7 excised 
canine  lungs using perfluoroethane (9). Perez -Sanchez et al. used SF6 to create diffusion-
weighted images in anesthetized rats as well as calculated apparent diffusion constant ( ADC) 
maps in 2005 (18 ). The same group demonstrated the impact of pressure and air -SF6 
composition on ADC maps in rats in 2005 (21 ). Schreiber’s group demonstrated sub- second SF6 
images in pigs in 2006 as well as static 3D and dynamic wash- in images (26). Conradi et al. 
expanded on previous work and evaluated hyperpolarized 3He in humans as well as PFx gases in excised healthy and emphysematous human lung using perfluoroethane and perfluoropropane 
(4). Most recently Schreiber’s group has compared MRI of inhaled SF6 with respiratory gas 
analysis in anesthetized pigs and found correlations adequate for lung function analysis (22).  
1.3 Risk/Benefits  
 There likely will be no direct benefits to the subjects, other than increased understanding 
of their COPD. There wil l be not direct benefits to the subjects without lung disease. The 
benefits resulting from this research includes a better understanding of COPD structure/function 
relationships and how these relate to clinical trajectories and therapeutic responses. This should 
translate into better -targeted therapies and more focused clinical trial designs.  
1.3.1 Potential Risks  
1. Pain and/or hematoma formation may occur at blood sampling site. This is not a serious 
complication.  
2. Dizziness during blood sampling may occur.  
3. Spirome try may exacerbate bronchospasm, but in our laboratory this has not been a 
Methods Study – PFP  
Duke Image Analysis Laboratory  
   
  Page 2 of 26 serious problem.  
4. Ionizing radiation exposure from HRCT  
5. The risks of participating in the MRI component of the study are considered minimal. 
MRI is a non- invasive imaging modality that involves no ionizing radiation. At the time 
of recruitment/consenting and again before the MRI session, all subjects will complete a standard questionnaire to screen for contraindications to MRI imaging (e.g. presence of 
metal in the eye).  
6. The primary r isk of the perfluorinated gases would be asphyxiation if breathed without 
oxygen present. This risk is minimized by obtaining the medical grade agents premixed 
with oxygen and with certificates of analysis. Further, as described in the preliminary 
data and research methods the source gas oxygen level is tested in the source gasbag prior 
to the study (510k cleared Oxygraf system) and the subject’s oxygen saturation is monitored with pulse oximetry before, during and after the MRI. Any abnormal drop in 
oxygen saturation based on absolute levels (SpO2 < 90%) or levels observed relative to 
room air breath- hold maneuvers OR any indication of a problem will the source gas 
would cause termination of the procedure. In addition, the gas is delivered via a 
disposable mask  with spirometer filters to isolate the subject from the gas delivery 
system . Further, we monitor inhaled and exhaled flow with MR compatible 
pneumotachometers (510k cleared) . 
1.3.2 Protection Against Risk  
1. Pain and/or hematoma formation may occur at the blood drawing site. We have 
experienced coordinators and pulmonary function technologists certified in both arterial 
and venous blood sampling.  
2. Dizziness during blood sampling may occur. Subjects will be supine during blood sampling to avoid this problem.  
3. Spirometry may exacerbate bronchospasm, but in our laboratory this has not been a 
serious problem.  
4. Subjects will stay on their prescribed oxygen levels while participating in the study. Please note, this includes all the imaging components (CT and MRI)   
5. HRCT  will be performed in accordance with all Duke Department of Radiology 
procedures to minimize unnecessary ionizing radiation. The risks of the delivered 
radiation (i ncreased cancer risk) is described out in the required consent language and 
compared to other risks of everyday life (refer to section 1.3.4 ). 
6. All data will be maintained in secured files within the Duke Research site or in the 
SQUID research image management system.  
7. Subjects will be monitored as follows during the imaging procedures: (a) monito ring of 
SpO2 before during and after the examination (any SpO2 levels < 90% will cause the 
study to be terminated (b) monitoring of exhaled oxygen (%) and CO2 (%) using a laser 
based capnograph. Further, we monitor inhaled and exhaled flow with MR compatible 
pneumotachometers (510k cleared).  
8. Duke University has formal education and certification procedures regardi ng research 
ethics (www.irb.mc.duke.edu/certification.htm). All research personnel will complete 
these in full  before entry into the protocol;  the nature and risks of the study will be 
reviewed with each subject.  
9. Each subject will be given the opportunity to read the consent form and ask questions. 
Methods Study – PFP  
Duke Image Analysis Laboratory  
   
  Page 3 of 26 After all questions by the study subject are answered, and before any protocol specified 
procedures a re initiated, each subject will sign and date the consent form. A copy of the 
signed consent will be provided to the subject  
1.3.3 MRI Risk  
MRI  uses a magnet and radio waves to make diagnostic medical images of the body. There have 
been no ill effects reported from exposure to the magnetism or radio waves used in this test. 
However, it is possible that harmful effects could be recognized in the future. A known risk is 
that the magnet could attract certa in kinds of metal. Therefore, The technologist  will carefull y 
ask the subject about metal within the subject’s  body (this includes certain dyes found in tattoos). 
If there is any question about potenti ally hazardous metal within the subject’s body, we will be 
excluding the subject  from participation in this researc h study. We will also keep the exam room 
locked so that no one carrying m etal objects can enter while the subject is  in the scanner.  
 The study involves entering a large room i n which a magnet is present. The subject  will be 
placed on a narrow bed and then slid into a small tunnel approximately 6 feet in lengt h and 25 
inches in diameter. The subject  will be asked to lie still for  about one hour on this bed. The 
subject  will hea r a loud machine -like noise. The subject  may be asked to have a harmless 
monitori ng device applied during the study. During the study, the subject  can have voice contact 
and physical contact with someone in attendance if you desire.  
1.3.4 Computed Tomography (CT)  
CT is a way to make x- ray images of the inside of the body. The CT scanner is a doughnut -
shaped machine that uses x- rays to create computer pictures that show structures inside your 
body more clearly than regular x- ray pictures. During the procedure, a technologist will take the 
subject  into the CT scan room where the subject will l ie down on the table (usually on the 
subject’s  back) inside of the CT machine. The subject  should get comfortable because it is very 
important the subject does  not move during certain parts of the test.  CT examinations differ 
depending on the part of your body being studied. For example, if your abdomen is  being 
studied, a series of pictures will be taken from your lower chest to your lower pelvis. During the study, the subject will be asked to hold their  breath so that the pictures will not be blurred. The  
machine will make some  noise, and the table will  move during the scan. Also, the subject  may 
receive signals from the technologist or from the  machine about their  breathing.  
 If the subject is taking part in this research, the subject  will have one or mor e medical imaging 
studies that use radiation. The  tests or treatments the subject will have include lung CT scan 
(inhale/exhale). The radiation dose from this  research is a bout 4 millisievert. To give subject  an 
idea about how much radiation will get, we w ill make a  comparison with an every- day situation. 
Everyone receives a small amount of unavoidable radiation each year. Some of this radiation 
comes from space and some from naturally occurring radioactive forms of water  and minerals. 
This research gives your body the equivalent of about 1 extra year’s worth of this natural  
radiation. The radiation dose we have discussed is what you will receive from this study only, and does not  include any exposure you may have received or will receive from other tests.  
 
Methods Study – PFP  
Duke Image Analysis Laboratory  
   
  Page 4 of 26 A possible health problem seen with radiation exposure is the development of cancer later in life. 
This extra  cancer risk is higher at younger ages and for girls and women. The extra lifetime risk 
of dying of a fatal cancer  due to the radiation exposure fr om this research may range from about  
one in 8,000 to about one in 3,000. At  such low radiation exposures, scientists disagree about the 
amount of risk. These estimates are very uncertain, and there may be no extra risk at all.  
 
We can compare this possibl e extra cancer risk to other risks (over a lifetime) that everyone is 
subject to in everyday life. For example, the chances of a person dying of cancer with no extra radiation exposure are about one in 4. The chances of dying in a car crash are about one i n 82, 
and the chances of being killed by a car while crossing the street are about one in 730.  
1.4 Dose Rationale  
 Each subject will receive PFP as a contrast agent to visualize the airway and alveolar 
spaces in their lungs using magnetic resonance imaging of  inert gas/oxygen mixtures.  
1.5 Trial Design  
An open l abel study in 250 subjects over five  years. We ar e planning 130 subjects with 
COPD (var ies stages of GOLD I -IV) and 120 normal subjects (non- smokers, ex smokers and 
current smokers with normal PFT’s).  
1.6 Literature  
 Gas trapping by HRCT  
Air tr apping can be detected by CT (14) ( 11) at suspended or full expiration with straightforward  
analysis of the image density in the lung field usually by counting pixels below a threshold 
value, e.g. < -856 in the COPDGene protocol. Air trapping using HRCT has been shown in recent 
work associated with the COPDGene project to be perhaps the only clinical phenotype to identify the several genotypes of COPD (http://www.copdgene.org/ats -abstracts -2010) (17) (7 ). 
We will focus on measuring such trapping in Aim 1.1 as well as washout using temporal 
measures of PFx image intensity in Aim 1.  
 
Preliminary Studies  
1. IND and Mixed Gases from Air Liquide/Scott Medical Products  
Before the initiation of these studies we received a full FDA  safety review and obtained 
IND 104,917 (Evaluation of Regional Ventilation in Normal Subjects and Subjects with Airway and Lung Disorders Using 19F Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Inert Perfluorinated Gases 
mixed with Oxygen (SF6, and PFP): A Phase 1 Study) . We provided this information to our IRB 
in support of local approval of the protocol. Our shipments of gas mixtures have undergone microbial limit testing under USP <1111>, USP <61> and USP <62> as required by the FDA 
Note that these gases are supplied a t low pressure to insure that the dense gas component  remains 
in the gaseous state. Example calculations follow: The gas mixture is formulated to have a ‘dew point’ of 0°C, i.e. it will not ‘condense’ above 0°C. The vapor pressure of PFP at 0°C is 60.41 
psi. In order to determine the overall pressure of the mixture we divide the vapor pressure by the 
concentration in the mix to get the corresponding mix pressure (at 0°C). Then multiply by 294/273 (°Kelvin to °C conversion) to find the pressure at 21°C/70°F (assumed room 
temperature). So, for 79% PFP mix, it is: 60.41 / 0.79 = 76.46 psia @ 0°C x 294/273 = 82.35

2. Initial Human Images and Physiological Monitoring  
We have initiated a proof of concept study under IND 104,917 and with local IRB approval 
(Evaluation of Regional Ventilation in Normal Subjects and Subjects with Airway and Lung 
Disorders Using 19F Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Inert Perfluorinated Gases mixed with 
Oxygen (PFP): A Phase 1 Study) . We have  conse nted 44 subjects  minus  one withdrawal , 
screened 43 subjects in the study with the characteristics described in Table 1 and scanned 30 
subjects (reasons for non scanning of subjects: 1 voluntary withdrawal  prior to any study 
participation, 5 body habitus (t oo obese), 4 screen fails, 4 MRI contraindications).

2 Trial Objectives  
The proposed st udy will determine regional qualitative and quantitative lung function 
information in the context of the clinical trajectory of COPD defined by the cross sectional 
cohort component s. Due to the long time -frame of this disease we are using a modified case 
control design that allows a cross -sectional evaluation of the proposed measures in aims 1- 2 to 
identify putative markers that could later be tested as prognostic factors in longit udinal studies. 
In the case of these PFx/oxygen mixtures, the availability of multi -liter quantities allows for 
wash -in/wash -out image acquisition and analysis allowing direct measures of gas trapping in a 
manner not easily achieved with any existing modal ity.  
3 Trial Design  
 The central hypothesis and current observation is that PFx gases used as contrast agents 
provide functional images of the lung airways including important regional ventilation 
information such as ventilation defect severity and gas trapping. We will test the central 
hypothesis and accomplish the overall objective by addressing the following specific aims:  
Methods Study – PFP  
Duke Image Analysis Laboratory  
   
  Page 6 of 26 3.1 Primary Study Aims/Secondary Aims  
Aim 1: Determine quantitative measures of lung ventilation performance in terms of direct 
measures of gas trapping measured during washout of the perfluorinated gas mixture.  
 Sub- aim 1. 1: Compare gas trapping from aim  1 with air trapping by HRCT using 
conventional analysis procedures.  
 
Sub- aim 1.2: We will accomplish this aim (as well as Aim 2) in a well -characterized 
cohort of subjects with COPD and subjects with normal global pulmonary function tests (non- , 
ex- and current smokers). This cohort will provide the basis for the cross sectional evaluation of 
the imaging markers in all aims with respect to disease severity (e.g. GOLD status) and risk factors (e.g. smoking)  
 Aim 2: Determine ventilation defect severity by comparing regional gas signal during wash- in of 
the perfluorinated gas mixture to steady state in the same cohort.  
 
The outcomes  of the work  proposed in the aims is expected to demonstrate a novel quantitative 
approach for ventilation defect and gas trapping evaluation of regional lung function in humans that would be easily deployed for multi -center studies. It should also provide a set of bi omarkers 
that could better inform evaluation of new treatments.  
 
3.2 Trial Treatment  
Each subject will receive PFP  gas as a contrast agent to visualize the airway and alveolar 
spaces in their lungs using magnetic resonance imaging of inert gas/oxygen mixtures.   The 
subjects will receive the gas by breathing normoxic mixtures of the gas using a 6500 V2 
Disposable oral -nasal mask and a standard Douglas Bag system. No additional drug products, 
investigational or otherwise will be provided in this study.  The subjec t will be monitored with a 
MRI compatible pulse oximeter as well as exhaled % oxygen and carbon dioxide.  
3.3 Duration  
3.3.1 Screening (V0)  
1. Obtaining Informed Consent from each subject   
2. History and Physical exam. The history will focus on onset of symptoms, co- morbidities, 
and smoking/occupational/environmental history. Also included:  
a. An assessment of patterns of exacerbations (mild = use of oral antibiotics and/or 
steroids for an acute change in respiratory status; moderate = hospital admission 
for a change in re spiratory status; severe = requirement for mechanical ventilation 
for a change in respiratory status).  
b. A measurement of the body mass index (BMI).  
c. A medication history (oral steroids, chronic bronchodilator use, oxygen use) with 
an emphasis on whether adhe rence was adequate.  
d. Assessment of gast ro-esophageal reflux disease ( 10) 
e. Epworth Sleepiness Scale as a marker of sleep disordered breathing

3. Pulmonary function tests will include spirometry, plethysmographic lung volumes, and 
corrected carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO). All procedures will be done in 
accordance with A TS/ERS standards ( 3) (15) (1 7). 
4. High resolution computerized scans of the chest (HRCT). Emphysema scores will be calculated per COPD  Gene protocol  (7). We will also explore novel approaches to 
quantifying airway structures ( 5) (16) 
5. A six -minute walk test with monitoring of pulse oximetry and heart rate will be 
conducted in a ccordance with ATS standards (1)  
6. Vital Signs will be measured and recorded ( temperature, heart rate, blood pressure and 
respiratory rate ) 
7. Pulse oximetry will be measured and recorded.  
8. Weight and height will be recorded.   
9. Quality of Life (QOL) will be assessed using the St George self -administered instrument  
10. A serum  pregnancy tes t will also  be performed in women with child bearing potential.  
  
MRI will be collected at the study visit 1 after the screening visit. Where possible the screening visit (V0) and MRI visit (V1) will be accomplished on the same day for the convenience of the 
subject. In all cases, the MRI will be followed- up immediately following the MRI procedure for 
any adverse events. Finally, all subjects will be contacted 24 hours post -MRI by phone for 
follow -up regarding any adverse events.   
3.3.2 Visit  1: MRI 
Visit 1 will  include a rescreening for MRI safety by the MR Technologist , (if not performed at 
screening), the MRI exam, Vital signs (temperature, heart  rate, blood pressure,  respiratory rate  
and pulse oximetry) will be collected at pre and post imaging examination. A urine pregnancy 
test will be performed on female of child- bearing potential  if the screening serum test was given 
48 or more hours earlier.   They must have a negative result to further participate in the study.   
  Additionally, subjects will be carefully observed for any signs of hypoxia  before,  during , and 
after the MRI exam using pulse oximetry. Any SpO2 reading < 90% will result in termination of 
the study.  
Subjects will stay on their prescribed oxygen treatment, while participating in the study. Pleas e 
note, this includes both imaging components (CT and MRI)  
 
3.3.3 Twenty -four Hour Follow-up  
Twenty- four hours post V1 (and subsequent imaging visits) the subjects will be contacted by 
phone and questioned regarding any post MRI adverse events.  (Refer to Tabl e 2 for the 
scheduled of events.)

Methods Study – PFP  
Duke Image Analysis Laboratory  
   
  Page 11 of 26 4.4 Treatment of Subjects  
4.4.1  MRI  
At the study visit (V1), MRI ‘studies’ will be perfo rmed using the same MR scanner (a 
3.0-Tesla (T) TRIO MRI system (Siemens Medical Systems )).  Lung morphology and function 
will be acquired using conventional 1H MRI followed by 19F MRI with a gaseous contrast agent 
mixed with oxygen for the 19F MRI study.  For both series the subject will lie down in a supine 
position on the magnet bed inside a transmitter and receive (T/R) coil for imaging of the hum an 
torso.  
 
For the gas mixture, the inert medical grade perfluorinated gas  (PFP) will be present at 
79% combined with 21% medical grade oxygen.  The agents will be supplied in aluminum 
cylinders (MR compatible) at pressures to prevent phase change of the perfluorinated component 
to the liquid phase.  For example, in an 8 inch by 52- inch aluminum cylinder, the same format 
cylinder of the 79% PFP/21% oxygen mixture will contain 137 liters of the mixture.  
 
Subjects will rest in a supine position for breathing  in normal air, and then switch to PFP 
by a passive Douglas bag system with 35 mm tubing with remote pneumatic switching between 
room air and PFP and MRI compatible pneumotachometers to allow flow rate and gas volume 
determinations. The subjects are monitor ed with an MRI compatible pulse oximeter as well as 
exhaled % oxygen and carbon dioxide. The subjects will then exit the MRI suite.  
4.4.2 High Resolution Computerized Tomography  
Chest CT Scan will be performed to assess for emphysema and airway disease in all 
subjects. An inspiratory chest CT scan will be performed with a radiation dose of 200 mAs in 
order to provide thorough assessment of small airway wall thickness and emphysema. An 
expiratory chest CT scan will be performed of lower dose (50 mA) to assess for  air trapping.

5 Assessment of Efficacy 
5.1 Efficacy Parameters  
 All of the protocols in this proposal will  be approved by our Institutional Review Board 
and reviewed periodically (every 6 -12 months).  In addition, a local Data Safety and Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) will be established. The committee members will be pulmonologists and 
radiologists with knowledge of COPD, imaging techniques and clinical research procedures. The 
frequency of monitoring depends on the progress of the study and will range between 3 and 12 
months.  Any adverse event will be reported to the IRB and DSMC, and serious adverse events will be reported within 24 hours.  An annual progress report (or more frequently, if requested) 
will be submitted to the IRB and DSMC . 
5.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
Any adverse event will be reported to the IRB and DSMC, and any other regulatory agents, 
and serious  adverse events will be reported within 24 hours. An annual progress report (or more 
frequently, if requested) will be submitted to the IRB, DSMC and any other regulatory agents.  
 
Significant morbidity and mortality are anticipated in these study subjects  due to the nature of 
the disease. Deaths, exacerbations of COPD, and hospitalizations for any cause are outcome 
measures of the trial and will not be reported as adverse events.  These outcomes will be 
monitored by the DSMC.  In accordance with policies of the NIH, other serious events, including 
severe injuries and new diagnosis of potentially fatal or disabling medical conditions will be reported as serious adverse events of the study to the local IRB, the DSMC, and the NIH.  The clinical investigator(s)  will terminate the study immediately if the occurrence of serious adverse 
events that suggests unacceptable risk to the health of the subjects.  All observed or volunteered adverse events, regardless of suspected causal relationship to the study procedure (s), will be 
recorded on the adverse events page(s) of the CRF’s or worksheets.  Events involving adverse experiences occurring during the study procedure(s) will be recorded.   
5.3 Definitions  
5.3.1 Adverse Events  
 Adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation by a subject 
who has been administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study procedures. Adverse events include the following:  
• All suspected procedure -related adve rse events.  
• Apparently unrelated illnesses, including the worsening of a preexisting illness (see fifth 
bullet, below, regarding preexisting conditions).  
Methods Study – PFP  
Duke Image Analysis Laboratory  
   
  Page 14 of 26 • Injury or accidents. Note that if a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or 
accident  (e.g., a fall secondary to dizziness), the medical condition (dizziness) and the 
accident (fall) should be reported as 2 separate adverse events.  If an accident results in a subsequent adverse event (e.g., hip fracture secondary to the fall), both the ac cident and 
the subsequent event should be  recorded in the adverse event CRF.  
• Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination findings that require clinical intervention or further investigation unless they are associated with an already 
reported adverse event.  A test or an examination that is repeated to check a possible 
abnormality does not constitute an adverse event.  
• Preexisting condition (i.e., a disorder present before the adverse event reporting period 
started and noted on the pretre atment medical history/physical examination form) should 
not be reported as an adverse event unless the condition worsens or episodes increase in frequency during the adverse event reporting period.  
 
5.3.2  Serious and Unexpected Adverse Events  
A serious adver se event is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life -threatening (i.e., puts the patient or clinical investigation subject at immediate risk 
of death; but not an event that, had it been more severe, might have created a risk of death);  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determi ning whether an event is an 
important medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life threatening 
and/or result in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may 
jeopardize the patient and may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in 
the definition above, the important medical event should be reported as serious.  
 
An unexpected adverse event is any adverse drug experience, the specificity or severity of 
which is not consistent with the current investigator brochure; or, if an investigator brochure is 
not required or available, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the study docum ents.  
In this case, “expected” does not include events that are anticipated based on pharmacological properties.  
5.4 Adverse Event Follow -up 
 The investigator will document all directly observed adverse events and all adverse 
events spontaneously reported by the trial subject.  In addition, each trial subject will be 
questioned about adverse events by phone at 24 hours post imaging.  The question asked will be 
“Since your MRI examination, have you had any health problems?”  
Methods Study – PFP  
Duke Image Analysis Laboratory  
   
  Page 15 of 26 6 Statistical Plan  
6.1 Statistical Methods and Subject Population for Analysis  
We have three main methods to employ to characterize of clinical phenotypes using MR 
Imaging bases features.  
 
One method is to estimate with reasonable precision the mean and standard deviation 
ventilation parameters f rom 19F gas imaging. So with 250 (5 groups) subjects we should be able 
using a t -test (or ANOVA) to detect a variation in defect volume of approximately 6% in the 
smallest sample (N = 26/group, GOLD III/IV) (alpha 0.05 and 90% power) and 5% in the 
referenc e groups (N=40/group). [ Statmate Ver 2, GraphPad Software (La Jolla, Ca)].  
 
Further, we wish to evaluate the diagnostic/prognostic ability of the MRI parameters to 
provide distinction among current ‘phenotypes’ and perhaps extend better discrimination with  
the MRI parameters from study aims .  We will also use statistical modeling for this project to 
correlate the features obtained from the gas -probe MR imaging- based measures with one or more 
of the clinical assessment measures recorded in Aim 1.2, to better  characterize disease 
phenotypes and identify the most promising prognostic indicators.  
 
In a similar context, a recent study has shown such promise for certain CT imaging- based 
features ( 7). Thus, if the role of MR imaging- based measures can be establishe d in a similar 
fashion then, associated with a link £, is some MR -defined variable Z which can define a 
biomarker, risk factor or phenotype R, resulting in the general linkage statement of 
R←£→GOLD+MRI. The makeup of this biomarker would contain information obtained from 
one or more measures Aims 1, 1.1 and 2 as well as other clinical status information X (as 
codified in the GOLD score or more generally some combination of the demographic, physiological and past history information, (Aim 1.2). This biomarker would then provide a 
more rapid and efficient means for deciding treatment strategies. We will examine the 
diagnostic/phenotyping ability of the MR imaging- based features (Aims 1 and 2) in  terms of 
their ability to predict existing clinical phenotypes (GOLD) characterized and other clinical features (Aim 1.2). For this purpose, we will divide the predictors into two categories: a) clinical 
assessments features (Xa1, Xa2,…, Xak), obtained fr om existing clinical, physiologic, and 
HRCT imaging, measured under Specific Aims 1.1 and 1.2; b) features obtained from MR 
imaging (Xb1, Xb2,…, Xbl), identified under Aims 1 and 2. A generalized linear model of the 
form [1] will be fitted using the method of maximum likelihood:  
 
g(Yt) = βa0 + βa1Xa1 + …+ βakXak + ε [1] 
 
The predictability of this model will be calculated using the Akaike Informati on Criterion 
(AIC) statistic (2), which balances the quality of fit (likelihood) against model complexity (8). Selection of the optimal subset of predictors will be achieved via a search over predictor space to identify the subset that maximizes the AIC statistic.  
Methods Study – PFP  
Duke Image Analysis Laboratory  
   
  Page 16 of 26 6.2 Termination Criteria  
Premature termination of this clinical trial may occur because of a regulatory authority 
decision, change in opinion of the IRB, or at the discretion of the FDA.   DUMC  also reserves the 
right to discontinue the trial prior to inclusion of the intended number of subjects, but intends 
only to exercise this right for valid scientific or administrative reasons.  
 After s uch a decision, the investigator must contact all participating subjects within 4 weeks.  
All trial materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible  
7 Direct Access to Source Data/Documentation  
During trial conduct, DIAL  will conduct periodic monitoring to ensure that the protocol and 
GCP  are being followed.  DIAL staff will review source documents to confirm that the data 
recorded on CRFs is accurate.  The investigator and institution will allow DIAL staff and 
appropriate re gulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.   
8 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
The trial site  (Duke)  may be subject to review by IRB and/or to quality assurance audits 
performed by Duke, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities from the US.  It is 
important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during these monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.  
9 Ethical Considerations  
9.1 Institutional Review Board  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain prospective approval of the trial 
protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent forms, and other relevant documents, e.g., 
advertisements, if applicabl e, from the IRB.   All correspondence with the IRB should be retained 
in the Investigator f ile. Copies of IRB approvals should be retained at Duke.  
 
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB approval is 
where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects consistent 
with applicable regulations.  In that event, the investigator must notify the IRB in writing in a 
time frame consistent with Duke policy and applicable regulations  
9.2  Ethical Conduct  of the Trial  
The trial will be performed in accordance with the protocol, ICH, GCP guidelines, and 
applicable local regulatory requirements and federal laws.  
9.3  Subject Information and Consent  
The informed consent form must be approved by the Duke IRB and must be in compliance 
with ICH, GCP, local regulatory requirements, and federal laws.  The investigator must  ensure 
that each trial subject  is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the trial and possible 
risks associated with participation.  The investigator will obtain written informed consent from 
Methods Study – PFP  
Duke Image Analysis Laboratory  
   
  Page 17 of 26 each subject subject's before any study- specific activity is performed.  The informed consent 
form used in this trial, and any changes made during the course of the trial, must be 
prospectively approved by the IRB before use.  Additionally, the FDA will be notified of any 
changes prior to implementation as appropriate.  The investigator will retain a copy of each subject’s signed consent form.  
 The subjects will be asked to provide contact informat ion for their primary care (or other 
physician) so that they can be notified if any potentially clinically relevant findings are obtained from standard clinical procedure (e.g HRCT or PFT’s).  This contact information will be kept in 
the subjects research record.  
10 Data Handling and Record Keeping   
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form 
or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this trial .  A 
CRF is required and s hould be completed for each included subject.  The completed original 
CRFs are the sole property of Duke and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Duke or appropriate regulatory authorities, 
without written permission from Duke.   
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure completion and to review and approve all 
CRFs. CRFs must be  electronic  signed by the investigator or by an authorized staff member .  
These signatures serve to attest that  the information contained on the CRFs is true.  At all times, 
the investigator has final personal responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all clinical and laboratory data entered on the CRFs.  
 
The CRF s, the MR and HRCT images and PFTs testing results  will serve as source 
document s for this study.  
10.1 Data Management  
All patient data will be collected on a dedicated and encrypted Duke University server. The 
data entry system will check for out -of-range and other implausible data entries and immediately 
prompt the study coordinator to confirm or correct the entry. All patient data files will be de -
identified.  
10.2  Data Storage  
All MRI images are stored in DIAL  for QA/QC and image  analysis;  CAMRD  will be 
notified of cases of unacceptable image quality t o enable the rescheduling of scans accordingly. 
Subjects can be rescanned a maximum of one (1) time. The data will be de -identified and stored 
in the research image management system SQUID, a research image management system in 
DIAL.  
10.3  Record Retention  
As required by law and to enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities, the 
investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (i.e., sufficient information to link records to identity), all original signed informed consent forms, 
Methods Study – PFP  
Duke Image Analysis Laboratory  
   
  Page 18 of 26 copies of all CRFs, other source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition.  The 
investigator according to International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), or federal, and local regulations should retain the records, whichever is longer.  
 
If the investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the trial, the trial 
records must be transferred to an acceptable designee, such as another investigator at Duke.  The 
investigator must obtain Duke’s writte n permission before disposing of any records, even if 
retention requirements have been met.  
 
11 Publication Plan  
 The conditions regulating dissemination of the information derived from this clinical trial 
are compliant with existing Duke policies .

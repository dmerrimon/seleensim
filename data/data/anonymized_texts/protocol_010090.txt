Title of Study : Phase 1/2 Clinical Study  of Niraparib in Combination with Pembrolizumab in 
Patients with Advanced or Metastatic Triple -Negative Breast Cancer and in Patients with 
Recurr ent Ovarian Cancer  
Study Center(s):  Phase 1: approximately 6 centers in the United States; Phase 2: 
approximately 40  centers in the United States  
Stud y Period (years):  
Estimated date first patient enrolled : April 2016  
Estimated date last patient completed: November 
2019 Phase of Development : 1/2 
Objectives:  
Primary objectives:  
 Phase 1: To evaluate dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) of  combination  treatment with 
niraparib and pembrolizumab during the first cycle of treatment, and to establish a 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule  
 Phase 2: To estimate  the clinical activity of combination treatment with niraparib 
and pembrolizumab in terms of objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by the 
Investigators using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1  
separately for the triple -negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) and ovarian cancer ( OC) 
cohorts .  
Secondary objectives:  
 Phase 1 and Phase 2: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of combination 
treatment with niraparib and pembrolizumab using Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v.4.0 3)  
 Phase 2: To evaluate additional measures of clinical benefit  as assessed by the 
Investig ators , including:  
 ORR by immune -related RECIST (irRECIST)  
 Duration of response (DOR)  by RECIST v1.1 and irRECIST ; 
 Disease control rate (DCR) by RECIST  v1.1 and irRECIST ; 
Niraparib  TESARO, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -PN162 -01-001 Amendment 2  
 
Confidential   Page 5 of 122 
  Progression -free survival (PFS)  by RECIST v1.1 and by irRECIST ; 
 Overall survival (OS) . 
 Phase 1 and 2: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of niraparib and associated 
major metabolite M1  during  combination treatment . 
Exploratory objective s (both phases) : 
 To identify the biomarker -based patient population that would derive benefit from 
the combination treatment based on the tumor tissue molecular profile , molecular 
profile of tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) , and circulating biomarkers . 
 To correlate homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status with other 
immune -related biomarkers and with efficacy outcomes . 
Methodology:  
Overall  
This is a multicenter, open -label, single -arm Phase 1/2 study evaluating the safety and efficacy 
of combination treatment with niraparib and pembrolizumab in patients with previously treated 
TNBC or OC. Specifically, patients eligible for this study are those with:  
 Advanced or metastatic TNBC (in Phase 1 patients may have received up to 4 lines 
of cytotoxic therapy for advanced/metastatic disease or in Phase 2, up to 2  lines of 
cytotoxic therapy for advan ced/metastatic disease); or  
 Advanced, recurrent epithelial (for Phase 1: any serous, endometroid, mucinous, 
clear cell; for Phase 2: high -grade serous or endometroid)  ovarian, fallopian tube, or 
primary peritoneal cancer who are currently platinum -resistan t but previously 
experienced a response lasting for at least 6 months to first -line platinum -based 
therapy (in Phase 1 patients may have received up to 5 lines of cytotoxic therapy or 
in Phase 2, up to 4 lines of cytotoxic therapy).  Study treatment should be considered 
an appropriate option by the Investigator .  
The study will be conducted in 2 parts. The Phase 1 portion of the study will be a dose -
escalation evaluation to determine the RP2D and schedule of niraparib to be administered in 
combination with t he recommended dose of pembrolizumab, and the Phase 2 portion will 
further evaluate the RP2D and schedule in 2 cohorts of approximately 48 patients each with 
TNBC or OC as described above.  
The study will be conducted in conformance with Good Clinical Pract ice (GCP) . The study 
schema is provided below .

triple-negative breast cancer.  
Phase 1  Dose Escalation  
At Dose Level 1, a cohort of 6 patients with either TNBC or OC will be enrolled . After all 
patients in Dose Level 1 who are evaluable for safety have completed Cycle 1 of c ombination 
treatment, the next higher dose level (Dose Level 2) will be open for enrollment if less than 
one-third of patients ( ie, < 2 of 6 patients  or < 4 of 12 patients ) in Dose Level 1 experience a 
DLT during Cycle 1 (see DLT definition below).  
Based on current single -agent niraparib experience ( see niraparib Investigator’s Brochure ), 
hematological laboratory abnormalities are expected in a significant proportion of patients . If 2 
of 6 initially enrolled patients in a cohort experience hematologic DLTs , a lower dose level will 
be evaluated . If, however,  the 2  observed DLTs include  1 hematologic DLT and 1 non-
hematologic DLT  or 2 non -hematologic DLTs , a cohort may be expanded up to approximately 
12 patients to better characterize the safety of the combin ation treatment.  
Once Dose Level 1 is determined to be safe, a cohort of 6 patients with either TNBC or OC will 
be enrolled in Dose Level 2. No further dose escalation will be considered if Dose Level 2 is 
reached.  
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be defined as the highest dose with DLTs observed in 
less than one -third of patients ( ie, < 2 of 6 patients  or < 4 of 12 patients ) during Cycle 1 of 
combination treatment . If one-third  or more of the evaluable patients experiences a DLT, then 
this dose will b e considered to exceed the MTD and a lower dose level may be opened for 
enrollment if not yet evaluated . Alternative dosing schedules may be explored.  
Additional cohorts of 6 patients may be opened to evaluate Dose Level ( -1) or Dose Level ( -2), 
which will  explore lower niraparib dose intensity , for example,  by introducing an alternat ive 
dosing schedule following agreement by the Investigators and Sponsor.  
The RP2D will be determined following discussion and agreement between Investigators and 
the Sponsor (see Section  9.12) based on an evaluation of multiple endpoints , which may include 
the DLT rate in first and subsequent cycles of combination treatment, the rate of dose 
modifications for non -DLT adverse event s (AEs), the ability to manage toxicities, PK, niraparib

 dose intensity , and signs of clinical efficacy. The goal will be to identify the dose/regimen of 
niraparib with the greatest dose intensity that can be safely combined with the recommended 
dose/regim en of pembrolizumab.  
In the Phase 1  portion of this study, 14 patients with advanced TNBC or OC were enrolled in 
Dose Level 1 or Dose Level 2 . Twelve patients were eligible for DLT evaluation . In Dose Level 
1, 1 of 6 DLT -eligible patients experienced multi ple DLTs including G rade 3 anemia, G rade 4 
neutropenia , and G rade 4 thrombocytopenia . In Dose Level 2, 1 of 6 DLT -eligible patients 
experienced 1 DLT, G rade 4 thrombocytopenia; an additional patient experienced an adverse 
event that was deemed to be a DLT -equivalent; the patient had epistaxis on C1D17 and Grade 4 
thrombocytopenia on C2D1 .   
DLT criteria  (as assessed during Cycle 1 , ie, during the first 21 days of treatment  - Day 1 
through Day  21): 
 Any treatment -related Grade ≥ 3 non -hematologic clinical (non-laboratory) AE  
 Any treatment -related Grade 3 or Grade 4 non -hematologic laboratory abnormality 
if: 
 Medical intervention is required to treat the patient, or  
 The abnormality leads to hospitalization, or  
 The abnormality persists for ≥ 7 days . 
 Any treatment -related hematologic toxicity specifically defined as:  
 Thrombocytopenia Grade 4 for ≥ 7 days, or Grade 3 or 4 associated with 
bleeding or requiring platelet transfusion;  
 Neutropenia Grade 4 for ≥ 7 days , or Grade 3 or 4 associated with infec tion or 
febrile neutropenia;  
 Anemia Grade 4, or Grade 3 or 4 requiring blood transfusion  
 Any treatment -related  AE leading to  niraparib  dose interruption per the following 
criteria:  
 A dose interruption per dose modification rules (see Section  5.4.1 , Table 3) for a 
non-DLT laboratory abnormality ( eg, for Grade 2 or 3 thrombocytopenia or for 
Grade 3 anemia or neutropenia) lasting ≥ 14 days  
 A dose interruption per dose modification rules (see Section 5.4.1 , Table  2 ) for 
non-hematologic AE leading to <  80% of an intended dose being administered 
(eg, niraparib dose interruption for > 4 days within Cycle 1).  
Note that niraparib dosing has been safely manag ed with dose interruptions and/or adjustments 
for AEs, including laboratory abnormalities, while maintaining activity in the single -agent 
setting (see Section  5.4.1 , Table 3 and niraparib Investigator’s Brochure ). Therefore , niraparib 
dose interruption and/or reduction for an AE that does not meet a DLT definition as described 
above will be considered a non -DLT m odification. The non -DLT dose modifications will not be 
considered in determining the MTD but will be considered in determining the niraparib dose

 intensity and RP2D.  
Phase 2 : Efficacy  Phase  
The Phase 2 portion of the study will commence after the RP2D is determined during the 
Phase  1 portion. Two cohorts of approximately 48 patients each with advanced or metastatic 
TNBC or recurrent OC as outlined above will be enrolled.  
Patients in this phase of the study  will receive the RP2D dose: niraparib 200 mg/day PO on 
days 1 -21 and pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on day 1 of each 21 -day cycle; niraparib dose may be 
escalated on or after C3D1 from 200 mg daily to 300 mg daily if hemoglobin ≥  9 g/dL, platelets 
≥ 100,000/µL and neutrophils ≥ 1500/µL for all labs performed during the first two cycles after 
discussion with Medical Monitor or Designee.  
Pembrolizumab/niraparib combination t reatment may continue for up to 2 years or until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal, Investig ator’s decision, or death. 
Continued treatment with niraparib beyond 2 years may be considered following discussion 
between the Sponsor and Investigator.  
General Study Conduct : Phase 1 and 2  
All patients will begin  treatment with niraparib and pembrolizuma b on Cycle 1 /Day 1 ; 
additional on-treatment assessments  will be conducted on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 
1 of all subsequent cycles . Safety assessments conducted throughout the treatment period 
include symptom -directed physical examination, vital s igns, ECGs, ECOG performance status, 
and clinical laboratory assessments (complete blood count [ CBC ], coagulation  [Phase 1 only] , 
chemistry, thyroid stimulating hormone [ TSH ], triiodothyronine [ T3] or free T3 [FT3] , free 
thyroxine [ FT4], urinalysis, cancer  antigen -125 [ CA-125] [OC patients only], and pregnancy 
testing) . Radiographic evaluations ( computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging 
[CT/MRI ] of chest [all TNBC patients and OC patients with abnormal screening scan or with 
clinical indication], abdom en, and pelvis ) to assess extent of disease  will be conducted every  9 
weeks (63 days ±7 days) while on study treatment independent of cycle delays and/or dose 
interruptions, and/or at any time when progression of disease is suspected . Brain scan will be 
conducted if clinically indicated ; bone scans will  be conducted per standard of care . After 1 
year of radiographic assessments , patients will have imaging performed every 12 weeks ( 84 ±7 
days). If a patient discontinues treatment for a reason other than prog ression or death, 
withdrawal of consent, or loss to follow -up, scans and CA -125 testing (OC patients only) 
should continue at the specified intervals  (ie, every 9 weeks for the first year and every 12 
weeks thereafter) . All radiographic images/scans will b e sent to a central imaging vendor  upon 
acquisition  and archived for potential future evaluation . Per RECIST v1.1, complete response 
(CR) or partial response ( PR) should be confirmed ; tumor imaging for confirmation of response 
may be performed at the earliest 4 weeks after the first indication of response, or at the next 
scheduled scan ( ie, 9 weeks later), whichever is clinically indicated . Blood sampling for PK and 
biomarker evaluations will be conducted for patients in both Phase 1 and Phase  2. 
In pa tients who consent to fresh biopsies, serial fresh biopsies will be obtained for exploratory 
biomarker analysis at 3 time points: during the screening period, 1 to 3 days before or on C3D1 
prior to pembrolizumab infusion  and, whenever possible, at the time  of disease progression  
(note: although  the biopsy is voluntary, it is highly encouraged) . The serial biopsies at different 
Niraparib  TESARO, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -PN162 -01-001 Amendment 2  
 
Confidential   Page 9 of 122 
 time points should preferably be on the same lesion . A core biopsy is recommended (details are 
provided in the Study Manual) ; if an excisional or incisional biopsy is to be performed, it must 
be conducted on a non -target lesion . If a patient has had a biopsy  within 12 weeks  prior to 
entering screening, that biopsy may be accepted in lieu of the screening biopsy.  Blood samples 
will also be obtained for biomarker analysis predose on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, as well 
as at the end of treatment (EOT).  
All patients will undergo an EOT visit within 7 days of the last dose of study treatment  and a  
safety follow -up visit conducted 30 days (+7 days) post -treatment . Thereafter, all patients will 
enter the post-treatment period for telephone assessment of survival status and the occurrence of 
any new malignancies every 90 days (±14 days).  
All AEs  will be collected and re corded for each patient from the day of signing the informed 
consent form until 30 days after last study drug administration ; serious adverse events (SAEs) 
and Events of Clinical Interest (ECI) (see Section  6.1.6 ) are required to be captured through 
90 days after cessation of study treatment (or to a minimum of 30 days post treatment if the 
patient starts alternate anticancer therapy), and any pregnancies that occur within 120 days post -
treatment are to be captured. All AEs and SAEs experienced by a patient, irrespective of the 
suspected causality, will be monitored until the AE or SAE has resolved, until abnormal 
laboratory values have retu rned to baseline or normalized, until there is a satisfactory 
explanation for the changes observed, until the patient is lost to follow -up, or until the patient 
has died.   
Number of Patients (Planned) :  
Phase 1: A total of approximately 18 patients (up to  36 patients may be included)  
Phase 2: A total of approximately 96 patients ( ie, approximately 48 patients enrolled into each

Investigational Product, Dosag e, and Mode of Administration:  
Niraparib  
Niraparib will be administered orally  (PO)  throughout the 21 -day cycle at the assigned dose and 
schedule. On Day  1 of each cycle , a niraparib dose will be administered upon completion of 
pembrolizumab infusion. Depending on dose schedule, 1, 2 , or 3 capsules of 100 mg strength 
niraparib will be ta ken at each dose administration (total dose 100 mg, 200 mg, or 300 mg per 
dose schedule, respectively). Patients will be instructed to take their nirapar ib dose at the same 
time each day, preferably in the morning. Patients must swallow and not chew all ca psules. The 
consumption of water and food is permissible .  
Niraparib will be dispensed to patients on Day 1 of every cycle ( every 21 days) thereafter until 
the patient discontinues study treatment. The Pharmacy Manual contains descriptions of the 
packaging  of niraparib and instructions for the preparation and administration  of niraparib .  
Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab  will be administered at a dose of 200 mg intravenously ( IV) using a 30 -minute 
IV infusion  on Day 1 of each 21 -day treatment cycle after all pro cedures and assessments have 
been completed as detailed in  Table  6. Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing 
to be as close to 30 minutes as possible. Given the variability of infusion pumps from site to 
site, however, a window between -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted.  
The Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions for the preparation of the pembrolizumab  
infusion and administration of the infusion solution.  
Duration of Treatment  and Study  Conduct : 
Treatment duration for individual patient: Patients may continue the pembrolizumab/niraparib 
comb ination treatment for up to 2 years or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, 
patient withdrawal, Investigator’s decision, or death. Continued treatment with niraparib 
beyond 2 years may be considered following discussion between the Sponsor and  Investigator.  
Long -term follow -up: Every 3 months (90  days), via telephone.  
Planned study conduct duration: the first data cutoff will occur at approximately 18 months ( ie, 
time from first patient enrolled /when responder or discontinuation status for all patients is 
known /approximately 6 months after last patient is enrolled ). The final analysis of primary and 
secondary endpoints will be conducted at approximately 12 months after the last patient is 
enrolled).  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Safety  
 Dose-limiting toxicities during the first cycle  (ie, during the first 21 days  of 
treatment / Cycle  1/Day 1 through Cycle 1/Day 21 ) (Phase 1 only)  
Niraparib  TESARO, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -PN162 -01-001 Amendment 2  
 
Confidential   Page 15 of 122 
  Incidence of treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) during the first cycle compared to 
the second and subsequent cycles  
 Incidence of TEAEs  occurring while patients are on treatment or up to 30 days after 
the last dose of study drug  
 Incidence of serious adverse events ( SAEs ) and events of clinical interest ( ECI) 
occurring while patients are on treatment or up to 90 days after the last dose of study 
drug 
 Changes in clinical laboratory parameters (hematology, chemistry , coagulation, 
thyroid function, urinalysis ), vital signs, ECOG performance status, ECG 
parameters, physical examinations, and usage of concomitant medications  
 Whole b lood samples will be collected prior to the start of the study drug and at 
treatment discontinuation for cytogenetic analysis  
Efficacy  
 Primary endpoint: ORR, defined as the proportion  of patients who have achieved CR 
or PR , evaluated using RECIST v1.1 based on Investigator assessment  
 The following secondary endpoints will also be evaluated  based on Investigator 
assessment : 
 ORR by  irRECIST  
 Duration of response, defined as the time from first documentation of response 
(CR or PR) until the time of fir st documentation of disease progression  by 
RECIST v1.1 and by irRECIST  
 Disease control rate defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved CR, 
PR, or stable disease (SD) per RECIST v1.1  and irRECIST  
 Progression -free survival , defined as the time f rom first dose  to the earlier date 
of assessment of progression , or death by any cause in the absence of 
progression , by RECIST v1.1 and by irRECIST  
 Overall survival  as measured from the date of first dose  to the date of death by 
any cause  
Pharmacokinetics  
Samples for PK determination will be collected from patients in both Phase 1 (plasma and 
serum) and Phase 2  (plasma only)  and the plasma will be analyzed using liquid chromatography 
with mass spectroscopic detection (LC -MS-MS) for niraparib  and major meta bolite M1 . The 
serum may be analyzed for pembrolizumab using enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA). Model predicted area under the concentration × time curves  (AUCs) will be derived. 
Parameters of interest are AUC, minimum concentration (C min), maximum  concentration (C max), 
clearance after oral administration (CL/F) and volume of distribution after oral administration 
(Vz/F), AUC at steady state (AUC ss), C min at steady state (C min,ss), C max at steady state (C max,ss). 
Biomarkers  
Niraparib  TESARO, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -PN162 -01-001 Amendment 2  
 
Confidential   Page 16 of 122 
 Biomarker classifiers wil l be evaluated in archival and fresh tumor samples obtained during 
screening ; in addition, in the subset of patients who undergo serial biopsies, biomarkers will be 
evaluated  in fresh tumor samples obtained 1 to 3 days before or on C3D1 prior to 
pembrolizu mab infusion  and, whenever possible, at the time of disease progression . Blood  
samples for biomarker analysis will be obtained predose on Day 1 of Cycle 1  and Cycle 2, as 
well as at the EOT  visit. Tumor and blood markers , including mutations in homologous 
recombination genes, such as breast cancer gene 1 and 2 ( BRCA1 and 2 ) mutations, may be 
explored. The magnitude of homologous recombination deficiency ( HRD ) positivity and tumor 
immune  microenvironment  may be evaluated.  Programmed death ligand -1 (PD-L1) expression 
and other related markers in tumor and tumor -infiltrating immune cells may be explored.  
HRD status and other biomarkers may be correlated with efficacy outcomes.  
Statistical Methods:  
Sample Size Considerations  
Phase 1: A total sample size of approximately 18 patients is estimated for the Phase 1 portion of 
the study to provide initial comparison of incidence of DLTs and safety profiles of the 
combination treatment between dose schedules in each patient populatio n. More patients could 
be enrolled ( eg, if the Dose Level -2 is explored or if expansion at any dose level is required to 
better understand safety and tolerability) ; up to a total of 36 patients may be enrolled . 
Phase 2: A total of approximately 96 evaluable patients ( approximately 48 patients in each 
tumor type) will be enrolled to ensure understanding of the activity of the combination 
treatment and to obtain adequate representation of different molecular cancer subtypes and 
biomarkers.  
Analysis Populations  
Three analysis populations will be defined as follows:  
 Safety Population: All patients who receive any amount of study drug. The 
assessment of DLTs in Phase 1 will include only those patients completing the first 
cycle of therapy, unless the pa tient discontinued study drug due to a DLT.  
 Full Analysis Set (FAS):  All patients who receive any amount of study drug. The 
primary analysis of efficacy endpoints will be performed on the FAS population.  
 Per-Protocol Population: All patients who receive at  least two cycles of study dru g 
andhave at least one protocol -required post -baseline disease assessments and have 
no major protocol violations that would impact efficacy evaluations. Supportive 
analys es of efficacy endpoints will be performed on the per -protocol population.  
General Methods  
All analyses will include summary statistics, including number and percentage for categorical 
variables and number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum 
for continuous variables. Time -to-even t analyses will be performed using Kaplan -Meier 
methods. As the Phase 2 portion of the study is single -arm, any statistical analysis  to be 
performed among subgroups is for descriptive and future study purposes. Further detail will be

 provided in the study statistical analysis plan.  
Safety  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) for purposes of summarization. All AEs occurring during the study will be included 
in by -patient data listings and tabulated by M edDRA system organ class and preferred term. 
Safety endpoints for AEs include the following: incidence of DLTs, TEAEs, ECI, TEAEs 
leading to death, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation; tabulations will be produced by 
MedDRA system organ class and prefe rred term . Tabulations of TEAEs will also be produced 
by severity and by relationship to study drug.  
Additional safety summaries will be provided for clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, ECOG 
performance status, and ECGs . 
Results of cytogenetic analysis, including incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities at end of study 
treatment , will be summarized.  
Efficacy  
ORR and DCR will be summarized using descriptive statistics including number, percentage 
and 1 -sided 90% CI.  
Duration of response, PFS, and O S will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier analysis, including 
number and percentage of events, number and percentage of censored patients, and 25th, 50th, 
and 75th percentiles of times to event with 95% CIs.  
Pharmacokinetics  
Pharmacokinetic parameters will b e summarized by study phase and dose schedule using 
descriptive statistics.  
Biomarkers  
The incidence of biomarkers will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Comparisons of 
efficacy  endpoints between biomarker subpopulations may be performed.  
Inter im Analysis  
To minimize the risk of exposing patients to an ineffective treatment, a series of response  
assessments will be performed when 6, 12, and  18 of 48 Phase 2 patients from each cancer type 
have at least 2 post -baseline tumor assessments. A formal decision regarding futility, which 
could result in stopping the study early, will be conducted separately for the TNBC and OC 
cohorts and will only be  made from the analysis of 24 patients within each cohort. The earlier 
response assessments, however, will inform the conduct of the formal interim analysis as 
follows: If no responder is observed in all three response assessments from 6, 12, and 18 
patien ts, then enrollment will be suspended after 24 patients have been enrolled, and no further 
patients will be enrolled until the result of the formal interim analysis of 24 patients is known. If 
≥1 responder is observed in any single response assessment from  6, 12, or 18 patients, then 
enrollment will not be curtailed. The decision rule regarding the formal interim analysis at 
N=24 is as follows: If there are fewer than 3 responders out of 24, enrollment may be closed 
and the corresponding cohort  may be stopp ed for futility. Otherwise, the study will continue to

 1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Background  
1.1.1.  PARP and Homologous Recombination Deficiency  
Poly(ADP -ribose) polymerases (PARP)1 and PARP 2 are zinc -finger deoxyribonucleic acid 
(DNA) -binding enzymes  that play a crucial role in DNA repair .(1) Upon formation of DNA breaks, 
PARP binds at the end of broken DNA strands, a process that activates its enzymatic activity . 
Activated PARP catalyzes the addition of long polymers of adenosine diphosphate ( ADP )-ribose 
onto PARP and several other proteins associated with chromatin, including histones and various 
DNA repair proteins . This results in chromatin relaxation, fast recruitment of DNA repair proteins, 
and efficient repair of DNA breaks . In this manner, PAR P plays a key role in sensing DNA damage 
and converting it into intracellular signals that activate the base excision repair (BER) and single -
strand break repair pathways.(1, 2) 
Normal cells repair up to 10,000 DNA defects daily, and single -strand breaks are the most common 
form of DNA damage . Cells that are unable to repair this burden of DNA damage, such as those 
with defects in the homologous recombination or BER pathways, are at risk for accumulating 
multiple lesions that will ultimately trigger apoptosis . They enter the S phase (DNA replication) of 
the cell cycle with unrepaired single - and double -strand breaks . Pre-existing single -strand breaks 
are converted to double -strand breaks  as the replication machinery passes .(1) Accumulated double -
strand breaks present during S phase are repaired by homologous recombination . Homologous 
recombination is the preferred repair pathway because it is associated with a much lower error rate 
than other forms of repair . Cells unable to perform DNA repair via homologous r ecombination  (eg, 
due to inactivation of genes required for homologous recombination , such as breast cancer gene 
[BRCA]1 - or BRCA2 -mutated cells) are at risk for accumulating multiple lesions that will 
ultimately trigger apoptosis . These cells accumulate s talled replication forks during S  phase and are 
more likely to use the error -prone nonhomologous end -joining (NHEJ) or alternative ( alt)-NHEJ 
pathways to repair double -strand breaks in DNA . Accumulation of errors in DNA by NHEJ 
contributes to mutation  burden that promote s the development of cancer . Over time, the buildup of 
excessive DNA errors in combination with the inability to complete S phase (because of stalled 
replication forks) contributes to cell death.  
Treatment with PARP inhibitors could represent a novel opportunity to selectively kill a subset of 
cancer cells with deficiencies in DNA repair pathways . For example, a tumor arising in a patient 
with a germline BRCA mutation (gBRCAmut) has a defective homologous recombination  DNA 
repair path way and would be increasingly dependent on NHEJ, alt -NHEJ, and BER for 
maintenance of genomic integrity . PARP inhibitors block alt -NHEJ and BER, forcing tumors with 
BRCA deficiencies to use the error -prone NHEJ to fix double -strand breaks .(1) Non-BRCA 
deficiencies in homologous recombination  DNA repair genes could also enhance tumor cell 
sensitivity to PARP inhibitors .(3) The rationale for anticancer activity in a subset of non -gBRCAmut 
tumors is that they share distinctiv e DNA repair defects with gBRCAmut carriers, a phenomenon 
broadly described as “BRCAness .”(4) DNA repair defects can be caused by germline or somatic 
alterations to the homologous recombination  DNA repair pat hway . In a recent analysis of 
Niraparib  TESARO, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -PN162 -01-001 Amendment 2  
 
Confidential   Page 30 of 122 
 approximately 500 high -grade serous ovarian adenocarcinoma tumors, approximately 50% 
contained homologous recombination  defects .(5) A subset of these tumors had biologically plaus ible 
molecular alterations that may make them sensitive to PARP inhibition by niraparib. A similar 
analysis of triple -negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) indicates up to 40% of these patients have tumors 
with homologous recombination  defects .(6) 
Homologous recombination  is a complex pathway, and several genes other than BRCA1 and 
BRCA2 are required either to sense or repair DNA double -strand breaks via the homologous 
recombination  pathway. Therefore, PARP inhibitors are also selectively cytotoxic for cancer cells 
with de ficiencies in DNA repair proteins other than BRCA1 and BRCA2 , including RecA 
homologs (RAD51 and RAD54), X -ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster 
cells (XRCC2 and XRCC3), DSS1, replication protein A1 (RPA1), ataxia telangiectasia muta ted 
(ATM ), ATM and Rad3 -related (ATR), check point kinases (CHK1, CHK2), Nijmegen breakage 
syndrome 1 (NBS1), and the components of the Fanconi anemia repair pathway.(1, 4, 7) 
Clinical studies have shown that PARP inhibitors are active for recurrent ovarian cancer  (OC) .(1-3, 8-
11) Clinical anticancer activity has been observed in patients with and without gBRCAmut and in 
patie nts who are platinum -sensitive and platinum -resistant . PARP inhibition appears to be most 
active in patients with gBRCAmut platinum -sensitive disease .(3, 9) Additionally, maintenance therapy 
in patients with relapsed, platinum -sensitive OC appears promising .(10) Of patients with a BRCA 
mutation, median progression -free survival (PFS) was significantly longer in the PARP inhibitor 
group than in the placebo group (11.2 months vs. 4.3  months; hazard ratio: 0.18; p < 0.0001) . 
Similar findings were noted for patients with wild -type BRCA, although  the difference between 
groups was smaller (7.4  months vs. 5.5  months; hazard ratio: 0.54; p  = 0.007) .  
Recent clinical studies also have shown PARP inhibitors to be active in breast and ovarian cancer. 
Clinical anticancer activity with PARP inhibitors has been seen in both patients with gBRCAmut and 
without g BRCAmut; however , activity is more robust in patients with the germline mutation .(1, 3, 8, 10-
12) 
In summary, t reatment with PARP1/2 inhibitors represents a novel opportunity to selectively kill a 
subset of cancer cell types by exploiting their  deficiencies in DNA repair. Human cancers exhibit 
genomic instability and an increased mutation rate due to underlying defects in DNA repair. These 
deficiencies render cancer cells more dependent on the remaining DNA repair pathways, and 
targeting these p athways is expected to have a much greater impact on the survival of the tumor 
cells than on normal cells.  
1.1.2.  Immune Surveillance and PD -1 Inhibitors  
The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformation 
has been k nown for decades .(13) Accumulating evidence shows a correlation betw een tumor -
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and prognosis in various malignancies .(14-26) In 
particular, the presence of CD8+ T cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T cells/FoxP3+ regulatory T 
cells seem to correlate with improved prognosis and long -term survival in many solid tumors .(22, 27-
33) 
The programmed death -1 (PD-1) receptor -ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors 
to suppress immune control .(34) The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of 
activated T cells under healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune

 responses, including autoimmune reactions . PD-1 (encoded by the gene Pdcd1) is an 
immunoglobulin ( Ig) superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -4, which has been shown to 
negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -
L2). The structures of murine PD -1 alone (35) and in complex with its ligands were first resolved (36, 
37), and more recently the  nuclear magnetic resonance -based structure of the human PD -1 
extracellular region and analyses of its interactions with its ligands were also reported .(38) PD-1 and 
family members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig variable -type (V -type) 
domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail , which is responsible for the bin ding 
of signaling molecules . The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based 
switch motif (ITSM) . Following T cell stimulation, PD -1 recr uits the tyrosine phosphatases SHP -1 
and SHP -2 to the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the dephosphorylation of 
effector molecules, such as CD3ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70, which are involved in the CD3 T cell 
signaling cascade .(39) The mecha nism by which PD -1 down -modulates T cell responses is similar 
to, but distinct from , that of CTLA -4.(40) PD-1 was  shown to be expressed on activated 
lymphocytes, including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, T regs , and natural killer 
cells.(41) Expression has also been shown during thymic development on CD4 -/CD8 - (double -
negative) T cells , (42) as well as subsets of macrophages (43) and dendritic cells .(44) The ligands for 
PD-1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell 
types .(45) PD-L1 is expressed at low levels on various non -hematopoietic tissues, most notably on 
vascular endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is predominantly  expressed on antigen -presenting 
cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments .(45) Both ligands  are type I 
transmembrane receptors containing both IgV - and IgC -like domains in the extracellular region and 
short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs . Binding of either PD -1 ligand to PD -1 
inhibits T cell activation triggered through the T  cell receptor. PD -L2 is thought to control immune 
T cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T cell function 
in peripheral tissues . Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers 
were demo nstrated to express abundant levels of this T cell inhibitor , (46, 47) which, via its 
interaction with the PD -1 receptor on tumor -specific T cells, plays a critical role in immune evasion 
by tumors .(48) As a consequence, the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway is an attractive target for therapeutic 
intervention in cancer .(49) 
1.2. Study Tre atments  
1.2.1.  Niraparib  
Niraparib is a potent, orally active PARP1 and PARP 2 inhibitor being developed as a treatment  for 
patients with tumors that harbor  defects in the homologous recombination  DNA repair pathway or 
that are driven by PARP -mediated transcription factors.  
Nonclinical data on niraparib are discussed in detail in the Investigator’s Brochure . Briefly, i n 
nonclinical models, niraparib has been observed to inhibit normal DNA repair mechanisms and 
induce synthetic lethality when administere d to cells with homologous recombination  defects . In a 
BRCA1 -mutant xenograft study, niraparib dosed orally caused tumor regression, which was 
mirrored by > 90% reduction in tumor weight compared with control . In a BRCA2 -mutant 
xenograft study, niraparib -dosed mice showed 55% to 60% growth inhibition, both by tumor 
volume and weight.  
Niraparib  TESARO, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -PN162 -01-001 Amendment 2  
 
Confidential   Page 32 of 122 
 Niraparib displayed strong antitumor activity in in vivo studies with BRCA 1-mutant breast cancer 
(MDA -MB-436), BRCA 2-mutant pancreatic cancer (CAPAN -1), ATM -mutant mantle cell 
lymphoma (GRANTA -519), serous OC (OVCAR3), and colorectal cancer (HT29 and DLD -1) 
xenograft models and with patient -derived Ewing sarcoma mice models.  Utilizing patient -derived 
ovarian and breast  cancer  xenograft  model s, niraparib demonstrated response in both BRCA 
mutation and BRCA wild -type tumors .  
Niraparib clinical data are discussed in detail in the niraparib Investigator’s Brochure . In the Phase 
1 clinical program, niraparib, as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, has been 
administered to 144 patients.  
In the Phase 1 program  (n=144) , the most common  (> 20.0%  of patients ) adverse event s (AEs), 
were fatigue (58.3%), nausea (54.9%), anemia (50.7%), const ipation (39.6%), thrombocytopenia 
(37.5%), vomiting (36.8%), decreased appetite (31.9%), neutropenia (28.5%), headache (26.4%), 
diarrhea (21.5%), dyspnea (21.5%), cough (20.8%), and leukopenia (20.8%).  
In the randomized, double -blind, Phase 3 NOVA trial (N iraparib Maintenance Therapy in Platinum -
Sensitive, Recurrent Ovarian Cancer), a total of 553 patients were randomized at 107 centers 
worldwide . Patients were categorized according to the presence or absence of a germline BRCA  
mutation (g BRCA  cohort and no n-gBRCA  cohort) and the type of non -gBRCA  mutation and were 
randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive niraparib (300 mg) or placebo once daily. The primary 
end point was progression -free survival . The study enrolled  203 patients in the g BRCA mut cohort 
and 350 patients in the non -gBRCA mut cohort. Among the 350 patients in the non -gBRCA mut 
cohort, 162 had tumors that were defined as HRDpos and 134 had tumors that were HRD negative 
(HRDneg). HRD status was not determined (HRDnd) for 54 patients.  
Demographic  and baseline characteristics were well balanced . Table  1 shows the results for the PFS 
primary endpoint for each of the 3 primary efficacy populations (ie, gBRCAmut cohort, HRDpos 
cohort, and overall non -gBRCAmut cohort). In addition, median PFS in  patients with HRD 
negative (HRDneg) tumors was 6.9 months (95% CI: 5.6, 9.6) in the niraparib arm , versus  3.8 
months (95% CI: 3.7, 5.6) in the placebo arm , with a  hazard ratio ( HR) of 0.58 (95 % CI: 0.361, 
0.922) (p=0.0226).

Progression-free survival is defined as the time in months from the date of randomization to progression or death. 
The primary data to support the safety of treatment with niraparib are derived from the NOVA main 
study in which a total of 546 patients received study treatment.  
All 367 patients who received niraparib and 171 (96%) of 179 patients who received placebo 
experienced at least 1 treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE). The high rate of TEAEs in the 
placebo group indicates the burd en of prior chemotherapy and the patient’s underlying ovarian 
cancer. Review of the data across study cohorts for TEAE incidence showed that, in general, the 
results were similar in the g BRCA mut and non -gBRCA mut cohorts. In the overall safety population, 
for the niraparib versus placebo treatment arms, the incidences of Grade 3/4 TEAEs (74% vs. 23%), 
serious adverse events (SAEs) (30% vs. 15%), TEAEs leading to treatment interruption (69% vs. 
5%), TEAEs leadin g to dose reduction (67% vs. 15%), and TEAEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation (15% vs 2%) were higher for niraparib. There were no on -treatment deaths 
reported.  
The most commonly observed non -hematologic TEAEs (all grades) observed in niraparib -
compar ed to placebo -treated patients were nausea (74% vs. 35%), fatigue (46% vs. 32%), 
constipation (40% vs. 20%), and vomiting (34% vs. 16%). The majority of the non -hematological 
TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity. The most commonly observed hematologic T EAEs (all 
grades) of niraparib were  anemia (49%), thrombocytopenia (46%), and neutropenia (18%). 
Although Grade 3/4 hematologic laboratory events were common at the initiation of treatment, no 
severe clinical sequelae were observed, and relatively few pati ents discontinued due to these AEs. 
Dose adjustment based on individual tolerability during the first 3 cycles substantially reduced the 
incidence of these events beyond Cycle 3, indicating the overall effectiveness of the approach to 
dose modification. Th ese TEAEs can be monitored routinely using standard assessments of 
hematological laboratory parameters, as is routine for patients with ovarian cancer r eceiving anti -
cancer therapies . In the NOVA study, niraparib dose adjustment tended to occur early with most 
patients reaching their individual adjusted dose level at the end of Month 3 (ie Cycle 3) of 
treatment. ~36% pts were kept on 300mg and ~64% pts had dose adjustment after 3 cycles in 
NOVA. However, in the Phase 1 portion of this study (3000 -PN162 -01-001) no patients were able 
to tolerate the 300 mg dose of niraparib .   
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have been observed in 
patients receiving treatment with olaparib, a PARP inhibitor; given the common mechanism of 
action, MDS and AML therefore represent a potential risk to patients receiving niraparib . In the 
Phase 3 NOVA study, the incidence of MDS/AML in patients who received niraparib (5 of 367; 
Niraparib  TESARO, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -PN162 -01-001 Amendment 2  
 
Confidential   Page 34 of 122 
 1.4%) was similar to its incidence in patients who received placebo (2 of 17 9; 1.1%).  Guidance on 
monitoring patients for new events of MDS/AML and the follow -up of patients with suspected 
MDS/AML is provided in Section  6.1.8  and Section  7. 
Study PR -30-5011 -C1 (NOVA QTc substudy n=26) is an open -label evaluation of the effects of  
niraparib on QTc measurements in patients  with histologically diagnosed ovarian cancer,  fallopian 
tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer . There were no reports of clinically significant abnormal 
electrocardiogram ( ECG ) changes, including QTc interval prolongation, attributed to niraparib . 
Administration of niraparib at the therapeutic dose did not prolong the QT interval. There was no  
correlation between the exposure level (ie, plasma concentration) of niraparib and QTc changes 
(ie,ΔQTcF).  
Clinical activity data for niraparib administered a s monotherapy in patients with OC are available 
from 1 early -phase clinical study . In the Phase 1/2 study PN001, 104 patients with advanced solid 
tumors who had received a median of 5 prior therapies were enrolled; 49 had OC (13 platinum -
sensitive, 35 plat inum -resistant, and 1 platinum -refractory) .(11) Of the 49 patients, 22 had confirmed 
BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, of whom 20 were radiologically assessable . Eight (40%) of these 20 
patients achieved a confirmed partial res ponse (PR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors ( RECIST ) and cancer antigen ( CA)-125 Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) criteria at 
doses ranging from 80 to 400 mg per day . Median response duration was 387 days (range: 159 to 
518 days) . Three (33%) of 9 patients with platinum -resistant BRCA -mutant OC had PR by RECIST 
and CA -125 criteria . Additionally, a 50% response rate (5 of 10 evaluable patients) was observed at 
daily doses ranging from 290 to 300 mg among patients with BRCA -mutant OC who had received 
more than 3 lines of prior chemotherapy  (data on file) .  
1.2.2.  Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
with high specificity of binding to the programmed cell death 1 (PD 1) receptor, thus inhibiting its 
interaction with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1) and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD -
L2). Based on preclinical in vitro data, pembrolizumab has high affinity and potent receptor 
blocking activity for PD 1 . Pembrolizumab has an  acceptable preclinical safety profile and is in 
clinical development as an intravenous (IV) immunotherapy for advanced malignancies . 
Keytruda™ (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients across a number of 
indications . For more details on s pecific indications refer to the Investigator brochure.  
1.3. Rationale for Current Study  
Current t reatment options for patients with advanced or metastatic TNBC and patients with 
recurrent OC are limited , with no approved standard of care .  
Triple -negative breast cancer is an aggressive histologic subtype of breast cancer, clinically defined 
by lack of expression of the estrogen receptor (ER -) and progesterone receptor (PR -) and lack of 
overexpression or amplification of H ER2-receptor . The ma lignancy constitutes an aggressive form 
of the disea se regardless of stage at diagnosis , and in patients with metastatic TNBC, there are 
currently no approved therapies or standard of care.  
Similarly for recurrent OC, there are no approved treatments or st andard of care . Although the 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend treatment with single -agent 
Niraparib  TESARO, Inc.

 topotecan, doxorubicin, or gemcitabine, the optimal combination and sequence of these agents  is 
unclear , and the exact population who would derive the most benefit is not well defined . 
Over recent years, research has revealed the importance of TILs in controlling the clinical 
progression of various cancers and their presence in a tumor is associated with response to immune 
checkpoint inhibitor s.(50) Accumulating evidence suggests that  basal -type TNBC may be the ER (-) 
breast cancer most regulated by intratumoral T cells and thus the most potentially responsive to 
immunotherapies .(51) In addition, the frequency of BRCA1/2 deficiency, both BR CA mutations and 
silencing of BRCA expression, in TNBC is between 45% and 70% .(6) Similarly in OC, 
intraepithelial CD8+ T -cells correlated with the presence of mutation or lo ss of expression of 
BRCA1 through promoter methylation .(52) Collectively, metastatic TNBC and OC patient 
populations that were sensitive to agents targeting defects in DNA repair are likely to overlap with 
those tumors with an active yet checkpoint -blocked immune response .  
Despite promising activity of PD -1 inhibitors observed in some types of cance r, including 
melanoma and NSCLC ,(53) activity in TNBC ( objective response rate [ ORR ] of 18.5% with 
pembrolizumab) and ovarian cancer  (ORR of 1 1%-12% on pembrolizumab or avelumab) observed 
thus far have been modest .(54-56) Although promising in selected patients with BRCA mutations or 
potentially with homologous recombination  deficiency, modest activity of PARP inhibitors in 
unselect ed ovarian cancer patients with resistant disease has been observed (ORR of 16% with 
niraparib and 0% with olaparib) .(3, 11) Synergistic interactions have been observed , however,  
between immune checkpoint  inhibitors and PARP inhibitors ; nonclinical experiments in syngeneic 
mouse models have shown an increased response rate to the combination of anti -PD-1 and niraparib 
over either agent alone, providing additional support to investigate this combination in patients .(57-
59) Exposure of  a tumor in vivo to PARP inhibitor results in increased cancer cell death by 
2 independent mechanisms.  First, through the mechanism of synthetic lethality, the PARP inhibitor 
can kill HRD  tumors through apoptosis. Second, the PARP inhibitor can increase th e number of 
CD8+ T cells and natural killer ( NK) cells, as well as their production of IFN -γ and TNF -α, 
resulting in an improved response to checkpoint blockade.(59) Accordingly, the bioma rkers for this 
combination clinical study  will include a wide range of assays, including the measurement of tumor 
cell death, genomic changes, apoptosis, and immune response.  
Given the unmet medical need of patients with advanced or metastatic TNBC and patients with 
platinum -resistant recurrent OC, the non -overlapping safety and metabolic profile (see the current 
version s of the niraparib Investigator’s Brochure  and the pembrolizumab Investigator ’s Brochure  
for details), and preclinical data suggesting possible synergistic interaction between imm une 
checkpoint inhibitors and PARP inhibitors along with a potential overlap  for PD -l- and PARP -
sensitive patient populations , this study is designed to evaluate the combination of niraparib and 
pembrolizumab in these populations.

 3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
3.1.1.  Overview  
This is a multicenter, open -label, single -arm Phase 1/2 study evaluating the safety and efficacy  of 
combination treatment with niraparib and pembrolizumab in patients with previously treated TNBC 
or OC. Specifically, patients eligible for this study are th ose with:  
 Advanced or metastatic TNBC ( in Phase 1  patients may  have received up to 4 lines of 
cytotoxic therapy  for advanced/metastatic disease  or in Phase 2 , up to 2 lines of 
cytotoxic therapy  for advanced/metastatic disease ); or 
 Advanced, recurrent epith elial (for Phase 1: any serous, endometroid, mucinous, clear 
cell; for Phase 2: high -grade serous  or endometroid ) ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer who are currently platinum -resistant but previously experienced a 
response lasting for at least 6 months to first -line platinum -based therapy (in Phase 1  
patients may have received up to 5 lines of cytotoxic therapy  or in Phase 2 , up to 4 lines 
of cytotoxic therapy ). 
Study treatment should be considered an appropriate option by t he Investigator. The study will be 
conducted in 2 parts . The Phase 1 portion of the study will be a dose -escalation evaluation to 
determine the RP2D and schedule of niraparib to be administered in combination with the 
recommended dose of pembrolizumab , and the Phase 2 portion will further evaluate the RP2D  and 
schedule in 2 cohorts of approximately 48 patients each with TNBC or OC as described above. See 
Section  3.1.2.1  for the RP2D.   
Figure  1 presents an overview of the planned study schema . The schedule of events  for the study is 
provided in Table  6.

The study will be conducted  in conformance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  
3.1.2.  Phase 1 Dose Escalation  
The following are the planned dose levels and treatment schedule for the Phase 1 portion of the 
study . Initially, 6 patients will be enrolled within a cohort . Based on current singl e-agent niraparib 
experience (see niraparib Investigator’s Brochure), hematological laboratory abnormalities are 
expected in a significant proportion of patients; therefore, c ohorts may be expanded up to 
approximately 12  patients if needed to better charac terize the safety of the combination treatment . 
 Dose Level 1: niraparib 200 mg/day orally ( PO) on Days 1 -21 and pembrolizumab 200 
mg intravenously ( IV) on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle.  
 Dose Level 2: niraparib 300 mg/day PO on Days 1 -21 and pembrolizumab 200 mg IV 
on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle.  
 Dose Level ( -1): niraparib 200  or 300  mg/day PO on Days 1 -14 of each 21 -day cycle 
and pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle. Schedule of niraparib 
administration will be determined by agreement between I nvestigators and Sponsor  (see 
Section  9.12). 
 Dose Level ( -2): niraparib 200 or 300 mg/day PO on Days 1 – 7 of each 21 -day cycle 
and pembrolizumab 20 0 mg IV on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle. Schedule of niraparib 
administration will be determined by agreement between Investigators and Sponsor  (see 
Section  9.12).  
Dosing will initiate a t Dose Level 1  with a cohort of 6 patients with either TNBC or OC enrolled

 200 mg IV on Day 1 every 21 days . After all patients in Dose Level 1 who are evaluable for safety 
have completed Cycle 1 of combination treatment, a review of the safety of treatment will be 
conducted by the Investigators and Sponsor  (see Section  9.12). A patient will be considered non -
evaluable if , for any reason other than safety,  the patient  is unable to complete the 21 -day 
combination treatment DLT observation period or is unable t o take > 80% of the intended dose of 
either agent. Patients in Phase 1 considered unevaluable may be replaced after consultation between 
the Sponsor and Principal Investigator. If 2 of 6 initially enrolled patients in a cohort experience 
hematologic DLTs, a lower dose level will be opened. If , however,  the 2 observed DLTs include 1 
hematologic DLT and 1 non -hematologic DLT  or 2 non -hematologic DLTs , a cohort may be 
expanded up to approximately 12  patients to better characterize the safety of the combination  
treatment.  Following th e safety  review, the next higher dose level (Dose Level 2) will be open for 
enrollment if less than one -third of patients ( ie, < 2 of 6 patients  or < 4 of 12  patients ) in Dose 
Level  1 experience a DLT during Cycle 1 (see Section  5.3 for the definition of DLT ).  
Once Dose Level 1 is determined to be safe, a cohort of 6 patients with either TNBC or OC will be 
enrolled in Dose L evel 2 and treated with a combination of niraparib 300 mg PO daily for Days  1-
21 and pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on Day 1 every 21 days. No further dose escalation will be 
considered if Dose Level 2 is reached.  
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be defined as the highest dose with DLTs observed in less 
than one -third of patients ( ie, < 2 of 6 patients  or < 4 of 12 patients ) during Cycle 1 of combination 
treatment . If one-third  or more of the evaluable patients experiences a DLT, then this dose will be 
consid ered to exceed the MTD and a lower dose level may be opened for enrollment if not yet 
evaluated . Alternative dosing schedules may be explored.  
Additional cohorts of 6 patients may be opened to evaluate Dose Level ( -1) or Dose Level ( -2), 
which will explore  lower niraparib dose intensity by , for example,  introducing an alternat ive dosing 
schedule , following agreement by the Investigators and Sponsor  (see Section  9.12).  
Patients in Phase 1 who complete the 21 -day DLT evaluation period may continue the 
pembrolizumab/niraparib combination treatment  for up to 2 years unless specific withdrawal 
criteria are m et (Section  4.3). Continued treatment with niraparib beyond 2 years may be considered 
following discussion between the Sponsor and Investigator.  Appr opriate niraparib dose 
modification can be made according to Section  5.4.1 . 
3.1.2.1.  Recommended Phase 2 Dose  
The RP2D was determined following discussion and agreement between Investigators and the 
Sponsor based on evaluation of multiple endpoints , which may include the DLT rate in first and 
subsequent cycles of combination treatment, the rate of dose modifications for non -DLT AEs, the 
ability to manage toxicities, PK, niraparib dose intensity , and signs of clinical efficacy. The goal 
will be to identify the dose/regimen of niraparib with the greatest dose intensity that can be safely 
combined with the recommended dose/regime n of pembrolizumab.  
In the Phase 1  portion of this study, 14 patients with advanced TNBC or OC were enrolled in Dose 
Level 1 or Dose Level 2 . Twelve patients were eligible for DLT evaluation . In Dose Level (DL) 1, 
1 of 6 DLT -eligible patients experienced multiple DLTs including G rade 3 anemia, G rade 4 
neutropenia , and G rade 4 thrombocytopenia . In Dose Level 2, 1 of 6 DLT -eligible patients 
experienced 1 DLT, G rade 4 thrombocytopenia; an additional patient experienced an adverse event

 that was deemed to be a  DLT -equivalent; she had epistaxis on C1D17 and Grade 4 
thrombocytopenia on C2D1 .  Based on the observed DLTs in DL1 and DL2, the  RP2D to be 
implemented  in the Phase 2  portion of this study is niraparib 200 mg/day PO on days 1 -21 and 
pembrolizumab 200 mg I V on day 1 of each 21 -day cycle; niraparib dose may be escalated on or 
after C3D1 from 200 mg daily to 300 mg daily if hemoglobin ≥  9 g/dL, platelets ≥ 100,000/µL and 
neutrophils ≥ 1500/µL for all labs performed during the first two cycles after discussion  with 
Medical Monitor or Designee . 
3.1.3.  Phase 2  Expansion  
The Phase 2 portion of the study will commence after the RP2D is determined during the Phase  1 
portion. Two cohorts of approximately 48 patients each with advanced TNBC or OC  as outlined 
above  will be ev aluated . 
Patients in this phase of the study will receive the RP2D  as described in Section  3.1.2.1 .  
Combination  pembrolizumab/niraparib treatment may continue for up to 2 years unless specific 
withdrawal criteria are met ( Section  4.3). Continued treatment with niraparib beyond 2 years may 
be co nsidered following discussion between the Sponsor and Investigator.  
3.1.4.  General Study Conduct : Phase 1 and 2  
Following informed consent, all patients in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 will undergo screening 
procedures within 21 days prior to  the first dose of study treatment to determine eligibility for study 
entry . Screening procedures include medical, surgical, cancer , and medication history; complete 
physical examination, including vital signs, height , and weight; Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performa nce status; clinical laboratory tests (complete blood count [CBC], 
coagulation, chemistry, thyroid -stimulating hormone [TSH] , triiodothyronine [T3] or free T3 [FT3] , 
free thyroxine [FT4], urinalysis, pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential, serum CA -125 
[OC patients only] ) and electrocardiogram (ECG). Tumor samples must be available from all 
patients (fresh samples or archived paraffin blocks ; see Study  Manual  for details on sample 
collection and preparation ) and will be sent to a centralized  laboratory for biomarker testing .  
Radiographic evaluations (computed tomography [CT, preferred method] or magnetic resonance 
imaging [MRI, if clinically indicated]) of the chest, abdomen , and pelvis must be conducted at 
screening  to determine extent of d isease and confirm presence of measurable disease . Brain scan 
will be conducted if clinically indicated ; bone scans will be conducted per standard of care . Scans 
performed prior to the signing of the informed consent form ( ICF) as part of routine clinical 
management are acceptable for use as initial tumor imaging if they are of diagnostic quality  and are 
performed within 2 1 days prior to first dose date.  
All patients will begin treatment with niraparib and pembrolizumab on Cycle 1 /Day 1 ; additional 
on-treatment assessments  will be conducted on Days 8 and  15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of all 
subsequent cycles . Safety assessments conducted throughout the treatment period include 
symptom -directed physical examination, vital signs, ECGs, ECOG p erformance status, and clinical 
laboratory assessments (CBC, coagulation  [Phase 1 only] , chemistry, TSH , T3 or FT3 , FT4, 
urinalysis, CA -125 [OC patients only] , and pregnancy testing) . Radiographic evaluations ( CT/MRI 
of chest [all TNBC patients and OC pati ents with abnormal screening scan or with clinical 
indication], abdomen, and pelvis ) to assess extent of disease will be conducted every 9 weeks (63 
days ±7 days) after Cycle 1/Day 1 while on study treatment independent of cycle delays and/or dose 
Niraparib  TESARO, Inc.

 interrup tions and/or at any time when progression of disease is suspected . The same modality (CT 
or MRI) should be used throughout the study for a given patient . Brain scans will be conducted if 
clinically indicated ; bone scans will  be conducted per standard of ca re. After 1  year of radiographic 
assessments , patients will have imaging performed every 12 weeks ( 84 ±7 days) until disease 
progression . If a patient discontinues treatment for a reason other than progression or death, 
withdrawal of consent, or loss to follow -up, scans and CA -125 testing (OC patients only) should 
continue at the specified intervals  (ie, every 9 weeks for the first year and every 12 weeks 
thereafter) . All radiographic images/scans will be sent to a central imaging vendor  upon acquisition  
and archived for future evaluation if needed. Per RECIST v1.1, patients who achieved complete 
response ( CR) or partial response ( PR) should have the response  confirmed; tumor imaging for 
confirmation of response may be performed at the earliest 4 weeks after the first indication of 
response, or at the next scheduled scan ( ie, 9 weeks later), whichever is clinically indicated . Blood 
sampling fo r PK and biomarker evaluations will be conducted for patients in both Phase 1 and 
Phase 2 (see Section  6.4). 
In patients who consent to fresh biopsi es, serial fresh biopsies will be obtained for exploratory 
biomarker analysis at 3 time points: during the screening period , 1 to 3 days before or on C3D1 
prior to pembrolizumab infusion  and, whenever possible, at the time of disease progression  (note: 
although  the biopsy is voluntary, it is highly encouraged) . The serial biopsies at different time 
points should be on the same lesion preferably.  A core biopsy is recommended (details are provided 
in the Study Manual) ; if an excisional or incisional biopsy  is to be performed, it must be conducted 
on a non -target lesion . If a patient has had a biopsy within 12 weeks prior to entering screening, that 
biopsy may be accepted as the screening biopsy.  Blood  samples will also be obtained for biomarker 
analysis pre dose on Day 1  of Cycle 1  and Cycle 2 , as well as at the end of treatment (EOT) . 
All patients will undergo an EOT visit within 7 days of the last dose of study treatment  and a  safety 
follow -up visit conducted 30 days (+7 days) post -treatment . Thereafter, all patients will enter the 
post-treatment period for telephone assessment of survival status  and the occurrence of any new 
malignancies  every 90 days (±14 days).  
All AEs will be collected and recorded for each patient from the day of signing the ICF until 
30 days after last study drug administration; serious adverse events (SAEs) and Events of Clinical 
Interest (ECIs) (see Section  6.1.6 ) are required  to be captured through 90 days after cessation of 
study treatment (or to a minimum of 30 days post-treatment if the patient starts alternate anticancer 
therapy), and any pregnancies are to be captured through 120  days post -treatment. All AEs and 
SAEs expe rienced by a patient, irrespective of the suspected causality, will be monitored until the 
AE or SAE has resolved, until abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline or normalized, 
until there is a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed,  until the patient is lost to follow -
up, or until the patient has died.

4.3. Patient Withdrawal and Replacement  
4.3.1.  Discontinuation from Treatment  
Patients may be discontinued from study treatment at any time . Specific examples of reasons for 
discontinuing all study treatment s are given below.  
 Adverse event  
 Disease progression as outlined in Section  6.3 or based on clinical cr iteria by 
Investigator  
 Risk to patient as judged by the Investigator and/or Sponsor  
 Severe noncompliance with the protocol as judged by the Investigator and/or Sponsor  
 Patient request  
 Patient becomes pregnant  
 Sponsor decision to terminate study  
Details of required niraparib dose modifications, including interruptions, dose reductions , and 
permanent discontinuation s, related to toxicity are provided in Section  5.4.1 . 
Details of required pembrolizumab dose interruptions and permanent discontinuation related to 
toxicity are provided in Section  5.4.2 . 
Note : If a patient is required to be discontinued from one of the study medications in the 
combination, treatment with the other study medication may be continued per decision of the 
Investi gator in consultation with Sponsor.  
Discontinuation of treatment may be considered for patients who have attain ed a confirmed CR , 
have been treated for at least 24 weeks with study treatments , and had at least 2  cycles of treatment 
beyond the date when the  initial CR was declared.  
Patients who discontinue from all study treatment s will continue to receive follow -up assessments 
(see Table  6) as part of the  study unless they are discontinued from the study ( Section 4.3.2 ).

 4.3.2.  Discontinuation from the Study  
Patients may be discontinued from the study for an y of the following reasons:  
 Withdrawal of consent by the patient, who is at any time free to discontinue their 
participation in the study, without prejudice to further treatment  
 Death from any cause  
 Loss to follow -up 
 Sponsor decision to terminate study  
 Investigator’s decision  
If a patient is lost to follow -up or withdraws from study treatment, attempts should be made to 
contact the patient to determine the reason for discontinuation . For patients who are lost to follow -
up, at least 3 documented attempts,  including one via certified mail, should be made to contact the 
patient before considering the patient lost to follow -up. 
4.3.3.  Replacement of Patients  
After consultation between the Sponsor and the Principal Investigator, enrollment may be extended 
to replace patient(s) that become non -evaluable for safety during Phase  1. 
In Phase 2, i f a patient discontinues study treatment prior to the first assessment of disease (either 
scheduled radiological assessment at 9 weeks post treatment initiation or clinically indi cated disease 
assessment prior to 9 weeks), the patient should be replaced for the purposes of efficacy analysis  
after consultation between the Sponsor and Principal Investigator . 
4.4. Patient Identification and Randomization  
4.4.1.  Patient Identification  
All patients  who enter into the screening period of the study (defined as the point at which the 
patient signs the ICF) will receive a unique patient identification number . This number will be used 
to identify the patient throughout the study and must be used on all s tudy documentation related to 
that patient . A patient will be considered enrolled when the patient has been consented, screened, 
and all eligibility criteria have been confirmed  in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). The 
patient identification number must remain constant throughout the entire study; it must not be 
changed at the time of enrollment .  
4.4.2.  Randomization Scheme  
Not applicable, as this is a single -arm study.

 5. STUDY MEDICATION  
5.1. Identity  
5.1.1.  Niraparib  
Niraparib ([3S] -3-[4-{7-(aminocarbonyl) -2H-indazol -2-yl} phenyl] piperidine [tosylate 
monohydrate salt]) is an orally available, potent, highly selective PARP1 and PARP 2 inhibitor . The 
excipients for niraparib are lactose monohydrate and magnesium stearate.  Niraparib will be 
supplied as 100 -mg capsules.  
5.1.2.  Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized mAb of the IgG4/kappa isotype 
designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2. 
Pembrolizumab Powder for Solution for Infusion is a sterile, non -pyrogenic lyophilized powder for 
IV infusion supplied in single -use Type I glass vial containing 50 mg of pembrolizumab. The 
product is preservative -free, white to off -white powder and free from visible foreign matter.  
5.2. Administration  
5.2.1.  Niraparib  
Niraparib will be supplied as 100 -mg capsules and will be administered orally once daily ( QD) 
continuously starting on Cycle 1 /Day 1 . The daily dose to be administered each day ( ie, 300 mg as 
3 × 100-mg capsules , 200 mg as 2 × 100-mg capsules , or 100 mg as 1 × 100-mg ca psules ) will 
depend on the phase of the study, and in Phase 1, the cohort assignment . See Section  3.1.2.1  for the 
RP2D of the combination. Patients will be instructed to take their dose at the same time each day, 
preferably in the morning . Patients must swallow and not chew all capsules . The cons umption of 
water and food is permissible.  
Niraparib capsules  will be dispensed to patients on Cycle 1/Day 1 and on Day 1 of every cycle (2 1-
day cycle s) thereafter until the patient discontinues study treatment . On Day  1 of each cycle, a 
niraparib dose wil l be administered at the clinic upon completion of the pembrolizumab infusion.  
Details on the administration of niraparib can be found in the Pharmacy Manual.  
5.2.2.  Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab will be administered at the study site on Day 1 of each 21-day treatm ent cycle after 
all procedures and assessments have been completed as detailed in Table  6. Pembrolizumab may be 
administered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled Day 1 of each cycle after Cycle 2 due to 
administrative reasons.  
Pembrolizumab will be administered a t a dose of 200 mg IV using a 30 -minute IV infusion . Sites 
should make every e ffort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible . Given 
the variability of infusion pumps from site to site,  however,  a window between -5 minutes and +10 
minutes is permitted.

 See Section  3.1.2.1  for the RP2D of the combination.  
The Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions for the preparation of the pembrolizumab 
infusion and administration of the infusion solution.  
5.3. Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
The following are to be considered DLTs for this study  (as assessed during Cycle 1 , ie, during the 
first 21 days of treatment , Day 1 through Day 21  during Phase 1 ): 
 Any treatment -related Grade ≥ 3 non -hematologic clinical (non -laboratory) AE 
 Any treatment -related Grade 3 or Grade 4 non -hematologic laboratory abnormality if:  
 Medical intervention is required to treat the patient, or  
 The abnormality leads to hospitalization, or  
 The abnormality persists for ≥ 7 days . 
 Any treatment -related hemat ologic toxicity specifically defined as:  
 Thrombocytopenia Grade 4 for ≥ 7 days, or Grade 3 or 4 associated with bleeding or 
requiring platelet transfusion;  
 Neutropenia Grade 4 for ≥ 7 days, or Grade 3 or 4 associated with infection or 
febrile neutropenia ;  
 Anemia Grade 4, or Grade 3 or 4 requiring blood transfusion . 
 Any treatment -related AE leading to  niraparib  dose interruption per the following 
criteria:  
 A dose interruption per dose modification rules (see  Section  5.4.1 , Table 3) for a 
non-DLT laboratory abnormality ( eg, for Grade 2 or 3 thrombocytopenia or for 
Grade 3 anemia or neutropenia) lasting ≥ 14 days . 
 A dose interruption per dose modification rules (see Section 5.4.1, Table  2) for non -
hematologic AE leading to < 80% of an intended dose being administered ( eg, 
niraparib dose interruption for > 4 days within Cycle 1).  
Note that niraparib dosing has been safely manag ed with dose interruptions and/or adjustments for 
AEs, including laboratory abnormalities, while maintaining activity in the single -agent setting ( see 
see Section  5.4.1 , Table  2 and Table 3, and niraparib Investigator’s Brochure ). Therefore , niraparib 
dose interrup tion and/or reduction for an AE that does not meet a DLT definition as described 
above will be considered a non -DLT modification. The non -DLT dose modifications will not be 
considered in determining the MTD but will be considered in determining the nirapar ib dose 
intensity and RP2D.  
5.4. Dose Modification  
Study treatment dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical / surgical events or 
logistical reasons not related to study therapy ( eg, surgery, unrelated medical events, patient

 vacation, and/or holidays). Patients should be placed back on study therapy within 28 days of the 
scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the Sponsor.   
All treatment interruptions and dose reducti ons (including any missed doses), and the reasons for 
the reductions/interruptions, are to be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).   
5.4.1.  Niraparib  
Dose interruption of niraparib may be implemented per the Investigator’s judgement after Cycle  1 
in patients enrolled in Phase 1 and at any time in patients enrolled in Phase 2. See the following 
sections for permitted duration of interruption prior to required discontinuation from treatment.  
Intra -patient Dose Escalation  
For patients in Phase 1 , the do se of niraparib may be increased after Cycle 1 to a higher dose level 
that has been found to be safe during the dose escalation phase following discussion with the 
Sponsor . 
See Section  3.1.2.1  for the RP2D .  
Niraparib Dose Modifications for Non -Hematologic Toxicity  
Treatment with niraparib must be interrupted for any treatment -related non -hematologic CTCAE 
Grade 3 or 4 event. Once resolved to Grade ≤ 1, the patient may restart treatment with niraparib 
with a dose level reduction ( see Table  2) unless prophylaxis is considered feasible. If the event 
recurs at a similar or worse grade, treatment should be interrupted again and, upon resolution, a 
further dose reduction must be made to a lower dose level, if available, or niraparib dosing should 
be discontinued. If the toxicity requiring dose interrupti on has not resolved to CTCAE Grade ≤  1 
during a maximum 4 -week (28 -day) dose interruption period, and/or the patient has already 
undergone a maximum of 2 dose reductions (to a minimum dose of 100 mg QD), the patient must 
permanently discontinue treatment w ith niraparib.  Once the dose of niraparib has been reduced, any 
re-escalation must be discussed with the Sponsor . Note that treatment with pembrolizumab may 
continue if discontinuation criteria as outlined in Section  5.4.2  have not been met.

 Niraparib Dose Modifications for Hematologic Toxicity  
The dose interruption/modification criteria for niraparib for hematologi c toxicities  will be based on 
blood counts and are outlined in  Table 3. 
For thrombocytopenia, p atients with a platelet count ≥ 25,000 to < 75,000/µL must have niraparib 
interrupted and have blood counts monitored twice  weekly until recovery to ≥ 100,000/µL ; upon 
recovery , niraparib can be resumed at the same dose for the first occurrence  with once weekly 
monitoring for 3 weeks to confirm no recurrence of thrombocytopenia . For a further recurrence of 
platelet count at this level or any occurrence of platelet count < 25,000/µL, dose interruption 
followed by dose reduction upon recovery to ≥ 100,000/µL with subsequent monitoring once 
weekly for 3 weeks to ensure the safety of the new dose level is required (see  Table  2).  
For Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia or anemia, treatment with niraparib must be  interrupted with blood 
counts monitored twice  weekly for neutropenia and once or twice  weekly for anemia until recovery 
to ≤ Grade 1. Niraparib dosing should be resumed with a dose level reduction (see  Table  2) at that 
time and the patient monitored once weekly for 3 weeks to ensure the safety  of the new dose level . 
If clinically indicated, use of G -CSF is allowed according to current American Soci ety of Clinical 
Oncology (ASCO) guidelines .(60) 
If the hematologic toxicity does not recover to the specified level within 4 weeks (28 days) of dose 
interruption and/or the patient has already undergone a maximum of 2 dose reductions (to a 
minimum dose of 100 mg QD), then niraparib should be d iscontinued .  
Any patient requiring transfusion of platelets or red blood cells (1 or more units) or hematopoietic 
growth factor support must undergo a niraparib dose reduction upon recovery if study treatment is 
resumed.  
It is strongly recommended that the patient be referred to a hematologist for further evaluation (1) if 
transfusions are required on more than 1 occasion or (2) if the treatment -related hematologic 
toxicities have not recovered to CTCAE ≤ Grade 1 within  4 weeks . If a diagnosis of MDS/AML  is 
confirmed by a hematologist, the patient must permanently discontinue niraparib . Note that 
treatment with pembrolizumab may continue following discussion with the Sponsor if 
discontinuation criteria as outlined in Section  5.4.2  have not been met.  
The reason for interruption, reduction, or discontinuation of niraparib should be recorded in the 
eCRF.

prophylactic transfusion at an alternate threshold, such  as ≤ 20,000/μL.  
5.4.2.  Pembrolizumab  
Adverse events (both non -serious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab exposure may 
represent an immunologic etiology. These AEs may occur shortly after the first dose or several 
months after the last dose of treatment. Pembrolizumab must  be withheld for drug -related toxicities 
and severe or life -threatening AEs per Table 4. See  also Section  6.1.6 , Events of Clinical Interest  
(ECIs) . 
Table 4 provides detailed information for dose interruptions and discontinuations related to toxicity

Niraparib 100 -mg capsules will be packed in high-density polyethylene bottles with child -
resistant closures.   
Pembrolizumab for injection is supplied as 50 -mg lyophilized powder single -use vials.  
The label text of the study treatments will comply with Good Manufacturing Practice and 
national legisla tion to meet the requirements of the participating countries.  The study treatment 
will be open -label and non -patient -specific.  
All study treatment supplies must be stored in accordance with the Pharmacy Manual 
instructions and package labeling . Until dispe nsed or administered to the patients, the study 
treatment will be stored in a securely locked area, accessible to authorized personnel only.  
5.6. Drug Accountability  
The Investigator or designee is responsible for maintaining accurate dispensing records of the 
study treatments throughout the clinical study.  
Details of maintaining drug accountability, including information on the accountability log, will 
be provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
All dispens ation  and accountability records will be available for Sponsor review . The study 
monitor will assume the responsibility to reconcile the study treatment accountability log . The 
pharmacist will dispense study treatment for each patient according to the protocol and 
Pharmacy Manual, if applicable.  
5.7. Previous and Concomitant Medications  
Any medication the patient takes during the study other than the study treatments, including 
herbal and other nontraditional remedies, is considered a concomitant medication . All 
concomitant medications must be recorded in the eCRF . The following information must be 
recorded in the eCRF for each concomitant medication: generic name, route of administration, 
start date, stop date, dosage, and indication . Any changes in the dosage or  regimen of a 
concomitant medication must be recorded in the eCRF.  
At screening, patients will be asked what medications they have taken during the last 30 days. At 
each subsequent study visit, patients will be asked what concomitant medications they are 
currently taking or have taken since the previous visit.  
Niraparib has potential to induce cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A2 and is a substrate for P -
glycoprotein (P -gp); therefore  , investigators should be advised to use caution with drugs that are 
sensitive substr ates for CYP1A2 (see Appendix A) . 
The niraparib safety profile includes risk for thrombocytopenia; therefore, investigators should 
be advised to use caution with anticoagulation and antiplatelet drugs.

Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -PN162 -01-001 Amendment 2  
Confidential   Page 57 of 122 5.7.1.  Prohibited  Medications  
Patients are prohibited from re ceiving the following therapies during the screening and treatment 
phase of this study : 
 Antineoplastic systemic che motherapy or biological therapy  
 Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol  
 Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol  
 Investigational agen ts other than niraparib and pembrolizumab  
 Radiation therapy  is prohibited if encompassing >  20% of the bone marrow within 2 
weeks or any radiation therapy within 1 week prior to study Day 1.  
Note : The following may be considered exceptions on a case -by-case basis after 
consultation with the Sponsor: Radiation therapy to pre -existing small areas of 
painful metastases that cannot be managed with local or systemic analgesics 
(excluding palliative radiotherapy encompassing > 20% of the bone marrow) as long 
as no evidence of disease progression is present . The patient must have clear 
measurable disease outside the radiated field . Administration of palliative radiation 
therapy may be considered clinical progression for the purposes of determining PFS.  
 Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an 
ECI of suspected immunologic etiology . The use of physiologic doses of 
corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Sponsor . 
Note : Inhaled steroids are allowed for the management of asthma.  
 Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of study  treatment and while 
participating in the study . Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, 
the following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever,  rabies, bacille 
Calmette -Guerin ( BCG ), and typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for 
injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed. Intranasal influenza 
vaccines ( eg, Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, however, and are not allowed.  
 Prophylactic cytokine s (G-CSF) should not be administered in the first cycle of the 
study but may be administered in subsequent cycles according to current ASCO 
guidelines .(60) 
If there is a clinical indication for any medication or vaccination specifically prohibited during 
the study , discontinuation fr om study  therapy may be required . The Investigator should discuss 
any questions regarding this with the Sponsor . The final decision on any supportive therapy or 
vaccination rests with the Investigator and/or the patient’s primary physician . The decision to 
continue the patient on study  therapy , however, requires the mutual agreement of the 
Investigator, the Sponsor , and the patient.  
5.7.2.  Contraception  
Pembrolizumab and niraparib are known to have properties that require the patient to use 
contracep tion. For details on niraparib, please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure.  
Niraparib  TESARO, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -PN162 -01-001 Amendment 2  
Confidential   Page 58 of 122 Pembrolizumab may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero . Furthermore, it is not known if 
pembrolizumab has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm . Therefore, 
non-pregnant, non -breastfeeding women may only be enrolled if they are willing to use 2 
methods of birth control or are considered highly unlikely to conceive . Highly unlikely to 
conceive is defined as 1) surgically sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal (a woman who is ≥ 45 years 
of age and has not had menses for > 1 year will be considered postmenopausal), or 3) not 
heterosexually active for the duration of the study . The 2 birth control methods can be either 2 
barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy. Patients 
should start using birth control from screening  throughout the study period up to 120 days after 
the last dose of pembrolizumab.  
The following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception: diaphragm, condom (by 
the partner), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide per local regulations or guidelines . 
Appropriate hormonal contraceptives will include any registered and marketed contraceptive 
agent that contains an estrogen and/or a progestational agent (including oral, subcutaneous, 
intrauterine, or intramuscular agents) . Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and 
preferred contraception for the patient.   
Patients should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the 
fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study . In order to participate in the 
study they must adhere to the contraception requirement (describ ed above) for the duration of the 
study and through 120 days after the last study treatment . If there is any question that a patient 
will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that patient should not be 
entered into the study.  
5.7.3.  Rescue  Medications and Supportive Care Guidelines During Treatment with 
Pembrolizumab  
Patients should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by the treating 
Investigator . Suggested supportive care measures for the management of AEs with  potential 
immunologic etiology are outlined below . Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be 
necessary , as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, 
attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metas tatic disease or bacterial or viral 
infection, which might require additional supportive care. The treatment guidelines are intended 
to be applied when the Investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
Note:  it may be necessary to per form additional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or 
skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.  
The following text details specific guidance by type of AE.  
 Pneumonitis:  
 For Grade 2 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids. When sympt oms improve 
to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 
4 weeks.  
 For Grade 3 -4 events, immediately treat with IV steroids . Administer additional 
anti-inflammatory measures, as needed.  
Niraparib  TESARO, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -PN162 -01-001 Amendment 2  
Confidential   Page 59 of 122  Add prophylactic antibiotics for  opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged 
steroid administration.  
 Diarrhea/Colitis:  
Patients should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such 
as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) a nd of 
bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus) .  
 All patients who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids . If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and 
electrolytes should be sub stituted via IV infusion . For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, 
consider gastrointestinal consultation and endoscopy to confirm or rule out colitis.  
 For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis that persists greater than 3 days, administer oral 
corticosteroids.  
 For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis that persists > 1 week, treat with IV steroids 
followed by high -dose oral steroids .  
 When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onse t, including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) or 
≥ Grade 3 hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic 
acidosis : 
 For Type 1 diabetes mellitus or Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia  
 Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes melli tus and 
for Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic acidosis or ketonuria.  
 Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine ketones, 
glycosylated hemoglobin, and C -peptide.  
 Hypophysitis:  
 For Grade 2 events, treat with corticost eroids. When symptoms improve to 
Grade  1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 
4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid 
dose is tapered.  
 For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by 
oral corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper 
should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of 
appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.

Confidential   Page 60 of 122  Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism:  
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for 
changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, 
and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of 
thyroid disorders.  
 Grade 2 hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2 -4 hypothyroidism):  
 In hyperthyroidism, non -selective beta -blockers (eg , propranolol) are 
suggested as initial therapy.  
 In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with levothyroxine 
or liothyronine , is indicated per standard of care.  
 Grade 3 -4 hyperthyroidism  
 Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid s followed by oral 
corticosteroids. When symptoms improv e to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper 
should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of 
appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
 Hepatic:  
 For Grade 2 events, monitor liver function tests more frequently unt il returned to 
baseline values (consider weekly).  
 Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids . 
 For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours.  
 When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and 
conti nued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 Renal Failure or Nephritis:  
 For Grade 2 events, treat with corticosteroids.  
 For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids.  
 When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued o ver no less than 4 weeks.  
 Management of Infusion Reactions : 
Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after drug infusion and 
generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion.  
Table 5 shows treatment guidelines for patient s who experience an infusion reaction 
associated with administration of pembrolizumab.

6.1. Safety Endpoints  
Safety parameters evaluated during the conduct of the study include treatment -emergent AEs 
(TEAEs), clinical laboratory values (hematology, chemistry , coagulation, thyroid function, 
urinalysis ), vital signs, ECG s, physical examination findings, and use of concomitant 
medications.  Additionally, the rela tionship between  cytogenetic abnormali ties and safety 
parameters may  be explored.  
6.1.1.  Definitions  
Adverse event : An adverse event  is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment . An AE can therefore be any 
unfavora ble and unintended sign (including clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or 
not considered related to the product.  
Adverse events may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre -existing medical 
conditions . An AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including 
baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.  
A treatment -emergent adverse event  will be defined as any new AE that begins, or any 
preexisting condition that worsens in severity, after at least 1 dose of study treatment has been 
administered.  
Serious adverse event : A serious adverse event  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
that, at any dose:  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening  
 Note: This means that the patient is at immediate risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more seve re 
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
 Any AE that prolongs hospitalization will be considered an SAE.  
 Exception : Planned hospitalization ( eg, for observation, protocol compliance, 
elective procedures, social reas ons, etc.) will not be considered an SAE; however, 
the reason for the planned hospitalization should be captured in medical history.  
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
Niraparib  TESARO, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -PN162 -01-001 Amendment 2  
Confidential   Page 64 of 122  Is an important medic al event(s)  
 An important medical event may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or require intervention to 
prevent one of the above outcomes . Examples of such events are intensive 
treatmen t in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
6.1.2.  Assessment of Adverse Events  
Each AE will be assessed by the Investigator w ith regard to intensity and causality with regard to 
study treatment as outlined in the following sections . 
6.1.2.1.  Intensity  
Investigators should assess the severity of AEs according to CTCAE . In general, CTCAE (v4.0 3) 
severity grades are:  
Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL). (Instrument al ADL refer 
to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, 
managing money, etc.)  
Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disa bling; limiting 
self-care ADL. (Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding 
self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.)  
Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 5:  Death related to  AE 
A distinction should be made between serious  and severe  AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria above in Section 6.1.1 . For example, a mild degree 
of gastrointestinal bleeding requiring an overnight hospitalization for monitoring purposes may 
be considered an SAE but is not necessarily severe. Similarly, an A E that is severe in intensity is 
not necessarily an SAE . For example, alopecia may be assessed as severe in intensity but may 
not be considered an SAE.  
6.1.2.2.  Causality  
The Investigator will assess the causality/relationship between the study drug and the AE . One of 
the following categories should be selected based on medical judgment, considering the 
definitions and all contributing factors:  
 Related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs in a plausible 
time relationship to treatment admi nistration, and which concurrent disease or other 
Niraparib  TESARO, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -PN162 -01-001 Amendment 2  
Confidential   Page 65 of 122 drugs or chemicals cannot explain. The response to withdrawal of the treatment 
should be clinically plausible.  
 Possibly  related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable ti me sequence to administration of the treatment, unlikely to be attributed 
to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  
 Unlikely related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
temporal relationship to treatment administration  which makes a causal relationship 
improbable, or in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide likely 
explanations.  
 Unrelated : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no 
temporal relationship with treatment administration. Typically explained by 
extraneous factors ( eg, concomitant disease, environmental factors, or other drugs or 
chemicals).  
6.1.3.  Collecting and Recording Adverse Events  
All AEs, regardless of the source of identification ( eg, physical examination, laboratory 
assessment, ECG, reported by patient), must be documented in the eCRF.  
All AEs will be collected and recorded in the eCRF for each patient from the day of signed 
informed consent until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment ; SAEs will be  monitored 
through 90 days after the last dose of study treatment ( or to a minimum of 30 days post-treatment 
if the patient starts alternate anticancer therapy ). All AEs and SAEs experienced by a patient, 
irrespective of the suspected causality, will be mo nitored until the AE or SAE has resolved, any 
abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline or normal  level s, until there is a 
satisfactory explanation for the changes observed, until the patient is lost to follow -up, or until 
the patient has died.  
If an Investigator becomes aware of an SAE after the specified follow -up period  post treatment 
discontinuation and considers the SAE related to investigational product, the Investigator should 
report the SAE to the Sponsor according to timelines for reporting SAEs described in this 
section.  
Adverse events may be volunteered spontaneously by the study patient, or discovered by the 
study staff during physical examinations or by asking an open, non -leading question such as: 
“How have you been feeling sin ce you were last asked?”  The Investigator will document the 
nature of AE, date of onset of the AE (and time, if known), date of outcome of the AE (and time, 
if known), severity of the AE, action taken with study drug as a result of the AE, assessment of 
the seriousness of the AE, and assessment of the causal relationship of the AE to study drug 
and/or study procedure.  
All AEs should be recorded individually in the patient’s own words (verbatim) unless, in the 
opinion of the Investigator, the AEs constitute components of a recognized condition, disease, or 
syndrome . In the latter case, the condition, disease, or syndrome should be named rather than 
each individual symptom.

Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -PN162 -01-001 Amendment 2  
Confidential   Page 66 of 122 Concomitant illnesses that existed before entry into the study will not be considered a n AE 
unless the illness worsens during the treatment period . Pre-existing conditions will be recorded in 
the eCRF as well as on the SAE Report Form medical history section.  
6.1.4.  Reporting Disease Progression  
The event of disease progression is an efficacy crite rion and is therefore not considered an AE. 
Disease progression should be reported within the eCRF . If AEs/SAEs occur in relation to 
disease progression, the AEs/SAEs must be reported per AE/SAE reporting requirements 
described in Section  6.1.3  and Section  6.1.5 . 
6.1.5.  Serious Adverse Events  
6.1.5.1.  Reporting  of Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator must report all SAEs within 24  hours of becoming aware of the initial SAE or 
any follow -up information regarding the SAE  using the SAE reporting contact information as 
printed on the SAE forms and in the SAE Com pletion guidelines . 
For all SAEs, an SAE report form must be completed by the Investigator for all initial and 
follow -up SAEs . A follow -up SAE report must be completed each time an Investigator becomes 
aware of any additional information regarding the SAE . For the follow -up SAE Report Form, the 
following fields must be completed on each form : follow -up number, site number, patient/subject 
number, protocol number, and the SAE term(s) and date of awareness. Additionally, only the 
appropriate field(s) on the S AE Report Form where the Investigator received additional or 
updated information should be completed . Previously provided information does not have to be 
entered on the follow -up SAE Report Form.  
Initial and follow -up SAE reports and any additional support ing documentation ( eg, hospital 
reports, consultant reports, death certificates, autopsy reports, etc.) included with the SAE report 
should be sent to the Sponsor (or de signee) within 24 hours of the I nvestigator/site awareness or 
receipt . If supporting do cumentation is provided, the Investigator should highlight all relevant 
and pertinent information . Also, any additional SAE documentation must be a clear photocopy 
with the patient’s personal identifiers removed . The Investigator must sign and date all SAE  
forms.  
The minimum information required for an initial SAE report is:  
 Name of person sending the report ( ie, name, address of Investigator)  
 Patient identification (screening/randomization number, initials  [if permitted by local 
data privacy regulations] , NOT patient name)  
 Protocol number  
 Description of SAE  
 Causality assessment  
 Seriousness assessment  
In case the Investigator has no ability to either fax or email an SAE ( eg, due to technical issues), 
pharmacovigilance can be contacted by phone . If an SAE is reported via phone and during usual 
Niraparib  TESARO, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -PN162 -01-001 Amendment 2  
Confidential   Page 67 of 122 business hours, the Sponsor pharmacovigilance (or designee) will capture the information on a 
telephone contact form or similar method . Outside usual business hours, the message will be 
recorded and the required follow -up actions initiated during the next business day . Once 
technical issues are resolved, the Investigator should fax or email the completed SAE form to the 
Sponsor (or designee).  
After receipt of the initial report, the Sponsor (or designee) will review the i nformation and, if 
necessary, contact the Investigator to obtain further information.  
6.1.5.2.  Submission and Distribution of Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events  
Per regulatory requirements, if an SAE is required to be submitted to a Regulatory Authority a

6.1.6.  Events of Clinical Intere st 
Selected non -serious AEs and SAEs are also known as Events of Clinical Interest (ECI s) and 
must be recorded as such on the eCRF and reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor as noted for 
SAEs in Section  6.1.5.1 . 
6.1.6.1.  Pembrolizumab  
Patients are to be monitored through 90 days after the last dose of study treatment for the 
following ECI : 
1. An overdose of pembrolizumab that is not associated with clinical symptoms or abnormal 
laboratory results. For this study , an overdose is defined as a dose ≥ 1000  mg (5 times the 
dose) of pembrolizumab . No specific information is available on the treatment  of 
overdose of pembrolizumab. In the event of overdose, the patient  should be observed 
closely for signs of toxicity . Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if 
clinically indicated  
2. An elevated AST or ALT value that is ≥ 3× ULN  concurrent with  an elevated total 
bilirubin value that is ≥ 2× ULN and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase value that 
is < 2× ULN , as determined by protocol -specified laboratory testing or unscheduled 
laboratory testing.  
Note : These criteria are based upon availab le regulatory guidance documents .(63) The 
purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require 
an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology . The study  site guidance for 
assessment and follow up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator T rial File 
Binder (or equivalent).  
6.1.6.2.  Niraparib  
Patients are to be monitored through 90  days after the last dose of study treatment for the 
following ECI:  
1. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a cute myeloid leukemia (AML). EC Is must be 
reported to the Sponsor as soon as the Investigator becomes aware of them.  
Niraparib  TESARO, Inc.

Confidential   Page 68 of 122 2. An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional ingestion or infusing of any dose 
of study treatment that exceeds the dose described in the protocol. Overdoses are not 
considered AEs; however, all ove rdoses should be recorded on a Serious Adverse Event 
Form (Section  6.1.5.1 ) within 24 hours  of becoming aware . An overdose should be 
reported even i f it does not result in an AE. Overdoses do not need to be recorded on the 
eCRF; dosing information is recorded on the eCRF.  
3. In conjunction with the survival assessment, new malignancy information will be 
collected for all patients  via telephone every 90 (±14) days (Section  7.2.10 ). Additionally, 
the relationship between cytogenetic abnormalities and safety parameters may be 
explored.  
6.1.7.  Pregnancy  Repor ting and Follow -up 
Pregnancies occurring in patients  enrolled in a study or in a female partner of a male patient  must 
be reported and followed to outcome . If a female patient inadvertently becomes pregnant while 
on study treatment, the patient will immedi ately be removed from the study . Any pregnancies 
that occur within 120 days following the last dose of study treatment must be captured in the 
eCRF . 
The Investigator should complete the Initial Pregnancy Notification report form and forward it to 
the Spons or (or designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the pregnancy . If there is an 
associated serious outcome, then both the Initial Pregnancy Notification report form and SAE 
report form should be completed.  
The site will follow -up with the patient at least m onthly and document the patient’s status until 
the pregnancy has been completed or terminated . The Investigator will make every effort to 
obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or 
newborn to the Spons or. The Pregnancy Outcome report form should be completed and 
submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours after the Investigator becomes aware of the pregnancy 
outcome.  
In the event the pregnancy outcome occurs following the end of the study and database lock , the 
Investigator will report the pregnancy outcome to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours after 
the outcome of the pregnancy is known to the Investigator in accordance with the procedure for 
reporting SAEs (see Section  6.1.5 ). 
Pregnancy alone is not regarded as an AE unless there is a possibility that the study drug may 
have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication . Elective abortions without 
complications should not be considered AEs unless they were therapeutic abortions . 
Hospitalization for normal delivery of a healthy newborn should not be considered an SAE . 
Pregnancy is not considered an SAE unless there is an as sociated serious outcome. Spontaneous 
abortions should always be reported as SAEs.  
Any SAE that occurs during pregnancy must be recorded on the SAE Report Form ( eg, maternal 
serious complications, therapeutic abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, neonat al death, 
congenital anomaly, birth defect) and reported within 24 hours in accordance with the procedure 
for reporting SAEs.

Confidential   Page 70 of 122 Any laboratory values assessed as clinically significant should be recorded as an AE . If SAE 
criteria are met  or the laboratory abnormality is an ECI (see Section  6.1.6 ), the event  should be 
recorded and reported according to the SAE reporting process (see Section  6.1.5 ). 
Hematological testing may occur more frequently than is specified in Table  6 when additional 
testing is medically indicated per Investigator judgment  or if the event meets the criteria for 
niraparib dose modification (see Section  5.4.1 ). Additional tests may be performed at a 
laboratory facility other than the study site, but test results must be reported to the study site, the 
study site must keep a copy of test results with the patient’s study file, and the results must be 
entered into the eCRF . 
It is strongly recommended that  any suspected MDS/AML case reported while a patient is 
receiving treatment or followed for post -treatment assessments  be referred to a loc al 
hematologist, who must perform  bone marrow aspirate and biopsy testing. A whole blood 
sample will also be collected for cytogenetic analysis (mutations of select myeloid -associated 
genes). Testing completed as part of standard of care is sufficient as l ong as the methods are 
acceptable to the Sponsor's Medical Monitor. The study site must receive a copy of the 
hematologist's repo rt of aspirate/biopsy findings, which must include a classification according 
to World Health Organization  (WHO ),(64) and other sample testing reports related to MDS/AML. 
Report data will be entered in the appropriate eCRF pages and the site must keep a copy of all 
reports with the patient’s study file . 
Who le blood samples will be collected prior to the start of the study drug and at treatment 
discontinuation for cytogenetic analysis. Further details on sample collection and analysis can be 
found in the Study  Manual.  
6.1.9.  Physical Examination and Vital Signs  
Phys ical examinations, including height (screening only), weight, and vital signs (blood pressure 
[BP], pulse, and temperature), will be performed in accordance with the schedule of events 
(Table  6). 
Any physical examination or vital signs assessed as clinically significant should be recorded as 
an AE or SAE . If SAE criteria are met or the abnormality is an ECI (see Section  6.1.6 ), the event 
should be recorded and reported according to the SAE reporting process (see Section  6.1.5 ). 
6.1.10.  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status  
Performance status will be assessed using the ECOG scale (see  Appendix  G) in accordance with 
the schedule of events ( Table  6). The same observer should assess performance status each time.  
6.1.11.  Additional Safety Assessments  
All patients will undergo ECGs in accordance with the schedule of events ( Table  6). 
Electrocardiograms  should be performed prior to blood draws for PK . Patients will be supine and 
rested for approximately 2 minutes before ECGs are recorded.  
Any ECG findings assessed as cli nically significant should be recorded as an AE . If SAE criteria 
are met or the abnormality is an ECI (see Section  6.1.6 ), the event should be recor ded and 
reported according to the SAE reporting process (see Section  6.1.5 ).

6.3. Efficacy  Endpoint(s)  
6.3.1.  Evaluation of Tumor Response  
6.3.1.1.  Overview  
The efficacy of combinati on treatment with niraparib and pembrolizumab will be evaluated by 
assessment of tumor response to treatment according to RECIST v1.1 (65) and irRECIST  (see 
Section  6.3.1.3  and Section  6.3.1.4 , respectively ) per investigator assessment . Tumor marker 
data (CA -125) will not be used for defining objective response s or disease progression; however 
CA-125 can be used for clinical decisions. Clinical criteria such as the GCIG criteria (66) (see 
Appendix  F) will also be considered for management of OC patients with clinical events ( eg, 
bowel obstruction) wit hout radiographic evidence of disease progression. The Study  Committee 
will adjudicat e such cases  (see Section  9.12). 
Response to treatment will primarily be based on Investigator  evaluation of radiographic images . 
All radiographic images/scans at the time points specified in Table  6, as well as any unscheduled 
images/scans, will be sent by the study sites to the central imaging vendor upon acquisition and 
archiv ed for potential future evaluation.  
The process for image collection and transmission to the central imaging v endor can be found in 
the Site Imaging Manual . 
Tumor imaging (chest, abdomen, and pelvis [plus brain if clinically indicated] ) should be 
performed by CT (preferred). Magnetic resonance imaging  should only be used when CT is 
contraindicated or for imaging of the brain, but the same imaging technique should be used in a 
patient throughout the study . CT scan is the more commonly used modality and is preferred for 
the majority of patients . An MRI can be utilized if clinically appropriate . Positron emission 
tomography/CT may be used according to RECIST guidelines .  
If the chest (OC patients only) and/or brain (OC and TNBC patients) CT/MRI is clear at 
screening, repeat imaging of these areas is not required in the absence of clinical indication 
requiring follow ‐up. 
Bone scans should be conducted per standard of care.  
6.3.1.2.  Timing of Radiographic Evaluations  
All patients will undergo serial radiographic assessments to assess tumor response . Initial tumor 
imaging at screening must be performed within 2 1 days prior to the date of the first dose of study  
treatment . Scans performed  prior to the signing of the ICF  as part of routine clinical management 
are acceptable for use as initial tumor imaging if they are of diagnostic quality and performed 
within 2 1 days prior to first dose date.  
Niraparib  TESARO, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -PN162 -01-001 Amendment 2  
Confidential   Page 73 of 122 The first on -study imaging assessment should be performed at 9 weeks (63 ±  7 days) from the 
date of first dose of study  treatment ; in the case of  progressive disease ( PD), a confirmatory 
image will be required 4 weeks later (eg, 13 weeks [91 ±7 days] ) (see Section  6.3.1.4 ). 
Subsequent tumor imaging should be performed every 9  weeks (63 ±  7 days) or more frequently 
if clinically indicated  and at the time of suspected disease progression . After 1  year of 
radiographic assessments , patients will have imaging performed every 12 weeks ( 84 ±7 days) . 
Imaging should not be delayed for delays in cycle starts or extension of combination treatment  
cycle intervals.  
Per RECIST v1.1  (see Appendix  D), CR or PR should be confirmed by a repeat tumor imaging 
assessment . The tumor imaging for confirmation of response may be performed at the earliest 
4 weeks after the first indication of response, or at the next scheduled scan (ie , 9 weeks later), 
whic hever is clinically indicated.  
Continue to perform imaging until whichever of the following occurs:  
 The start of new anticancer treatment  
 Withdrawal of consent  
 Death  
 End of the study ( when responder or discontinuation status for all patients is known ) 
Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than PD will continue post -treatment 
imaging stud ies for disease status follow -up at the same frequency as already followed, eg , every 
9 or 12 weeks (± 7 days) depending on the length of treatment with the study combination drugs, 
until disease progression, start of a non –study anticancer treatment, with drawal of consent to 
study participation, becoming lost to follow -up, death, or end of the study.  
6.3.1.3.  Assessment of Response by RECIST  
RECIST v1.1 will be used by the Investigator  as the primary measure for assessment of tumor 
response, date of disease progres sion, and as a basis for all protocol guidelines related to disease 
status . Note that irRECIST will be followed in cases of disease progression to assess 
continuation of treatment  in clinically stable patients until progression is confirmed (see 
Section  6.3.1.4 ).  
Details on RECIST v1.1, including evaluation of target and non -target lesions and definitions of 
response are provided in Appendix  D. 
6.3.1.4.  Assessment of Response by Immune -Related RECIST  
RECIST v1.1 will be adapted to account for the unique tumor response characteristics seen 
during  treatment with pembrolizumab . Immunotherapeutic agents such as pembrolizumab may 
produce antitumor effects by potentiating endogenous cancer -specific immune responses . The 
response patterns seen with such an approach may extend beyond the typical time cou rse of 
responses seen with cytotoxic agents and can manifest a clinical response after an initial increase 
in tumor burden or even the appearance of new lesions . Standard RECIST v1.1 may, thus, not 
provide an accurate response assessment of immunotherapeut ic agents such as pembrolizumab. 
irRECIST will be used by local site Investigator s to assess tumor response and progression and 
make treatment decisions.  
Niraparib  TESARO, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -PN162 -01-001 Amendment 2  
Confidential   Page 74 of 122 Therefore, RECIST  v1.1 will be used with the following adaptations  (ie, irRECIST)  (see also  
Appendix  E). 
 If repeat imaging shows < 20% increase in tumor burden compared with nadir, stable 
or improved previous new lesion (if identified as cause for in itial PD), and 
stable/improved non -target disease (if identified as cause for initial PD), treatment 
may be continued / resumed , and the next tumor imaging  should be conducted 
according to the protocol schedule of every 9 weeks (63 ± 7 days) (or every 12 weeks  
[84 ± 7 days]  if after 1 year) . 
 If repeat imaging confirms PD due to any of the scenarios listed below, patients will 
be discontinued from study thera py.  
In determining whether or not the tumor burden has increased or decreased  per 
irRECIST , the local site Investigator  should consider all target and non-target lesions , 
as well as any incremental new lesion(s) . 
If ANY of the following occur by irRECIST on repeat imaging, PD is confirmed:  
 Tumor burden remains ≥  20% and at least 5 -mm absolute increase compared with 
nadir  
 Non-target disease resulting in initial PD is worse (qualitative)  
 New lesion resulting in initial PD is worse (qualitative)  
 Additional ne w lesion(s) since last evaluation  
 Additional new non -target progression since last evaluation  
In patients who have initial evidence of radiological PD, it is at the discretion of the treating 
physician whether to continue a patient on study treatment until  repeat imaging is obtained.  This 
clinical judgment decision should be based on the patient’s overall clinical condition, including 
performance status, clinical symptoms, and laboratory data.  Patients may receive pembrolizumab 
treatment while waiting for c onfirmation of PD if they are clinically stable as defined by the 
following criteria:  
 Absence of signs and symptoms indicating clinically significant progression  of 
disease, including worsening of laboratory values  
 No decline in ECOG performance status  
 Absence of rapid progression of disease  
 Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg, cord compression) 
requiring urgent alternative medical intervention  
When feasible, patients should not be discontinued until progression is confirmed.  This 
allowance to continue treatment despite initial radiologic progression takes into account the 
observation that some patients can have a transient tumor flare in the first few months after the 
start of immunotherapy but with subsequent disease response.  Patients who are deemed clinically 
unstable are not required to have repeat imaging for confirmation of progressive disease.

6.3.2.1.  Objective Response Rate  
The primary efficacy endpoint is ORR, defined as the proportion of patients achieving CR or  PR 
as assessed by the Investigator  per RECIST ( v1.1) (Appendix  D). Tumor assessments after the 
initiation of further anticancer therapy are excluded  for the assessment of best overall response.  
ORR by irRECIST (Section  6.3.1.4 ) will also be evaluated as a secondary en dpoint.  
6.3.2.2.  Duration of Response  
Duration of response  will be evaluated as a secondary endpoint and  is defined as  the time from 
first documentation of CR or PR by RECIST v1.1 until: (1) the time of first documentation of 
disease progression per RECIST v1.1 (Appendix  D); and (2) the time of first documentation of 
disease progression per irRECIST  (Section  6.3.1.4 ). Note that date of progression based on either 
RECIST v1.1 or irRECIST may be overwritten in patients with OC if clinical criteria  
(Appendix  F) indicate earlier progression as adjudicated by the Study Committee ( Section  9.12). 
DOR by irRECIST ( Section  6.3.1.4 ) will also be evaluated as a secondary endpoint.  
6.3.2.3.  Disease Control Rate  
Disease control rate will be assessed as a secondary endpoint and is defined as the proportion of 
patients achieving CR, PR, or stable disease (SD)  as assessed by the Investigator per RECIST 
v1.1 (Appendix  D) and irRECIST  (Section  6.3.1.4 ). 
6.3.2.4.  Progression -Free Survival  
Progression -free survival will be assessed as a secondary endpoint and is defined as the time 
from enrollment to the earlier date of assessment of progression or d eath by any cause in the 
absence of progression  based on: (1) the time of first documentation of disease progression per 
RECIST v1.1 (Appendix  D); and (2) the time of first documentation of disease progression per 
irRECIST ( Section  6.3.1.4 ). Note that date of progression based on either RECIST v1 .1 or 
irRECIST may be overwritten in patients with OC if clinical criteria  (Appendix  F) indicate 
earlier progression as adjudicated by the Study Committee ( Section  9.12).  
6.3.2.5.  Overall Survival  
Overall survival will be assessed as a secondary endpoint and is defined as the time from date of 
first dose of study treatment to the date of death by any cause.  New malignancy information will 
also be collected as part of this assessme nt (Section  7.2.10 ).  
6.4. Pharmacokinetics  
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected from patients in both Phase 1 and Phase 2. An 
overview of sampling times for blood for PK analysis and concurrent ECG assessments, see 
Table  8 (Phase 1) and Table  9 (Phase 2).  
For niraparib and major metabolite M1,  the plasma samples from both Phase 1 and Phase 2 
patients will be analyzed using liquid chromatography with mass spectroscopic detection 
(LC-MS-MS). For pembrolizumab in Phase 1, serum PK samples will be collected according to

using enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) if required for understanding of AEs.  
The timing of each required sample collection listed in Table 7 and Table 8 for niraparib and 
major metabolite M1, and pembrolizumab for PK blood draws will be recorded.  
Complete instructions for collection, processing, shipping, and handling of samples ar e detailed 
in the Study  Manual.  
6.4.1.  Phase 1  
For all patients in Phase 1, blood samples for measurements of plasma levels of niraparib  and 
M1 will be obtained on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2 at the following time  points: 0 (predose within 
30 minutes) and 1 hour (±5 minutes), 2 hours (±5 minutes), 4 hours (±5 minutes), 6 hours (±5 
minutes), 8  hours (±10 minutes), and 24 hours (±30 minutes) postdose.  
In addition, blood samples for measurements of drug levels of niraparib  and M1  will be obtained 
on Day  1 of Cycles 4 and  8 at the following time  points: 0 (predose within 30 minutes) and 2 
hours (±15 minutes) postdose.  
For all patients in Phase 1 , blood samples for pembrolizumab will only be analyzed to 
understand an AE in an individual patient. The samples will be collect ed according to the 
following schedule , stored, and analyzed as needed . Predose blood samples for trough 
measurement of serum levels of pe mbrolizumab  will be obtained  at Cycles 1, 2, 4 , and 8 . All 
predose trough samples should be drawn within 30 minutes  (±5 minutes) before infusion of 
pembrolizumab . Additional postdose peak PK serum samples will be drawn within 30 minutes 
after the end of the pembrolizumab infusion at Cycle s 1 and 8 . An additional single PK serum 
sample should be drawn at 24 hours  (±30 minutes)  (Day 2), 168 hours  (±2 hours)  (Day 8) , and 
336 hours (±4 hours)  (Day 15) after Cycle 1 dosing.   
6.4.2.  Phase 2  
For patients in Phase 2, b lood samples for measurements of plasma levels of niraparib  and M1  
will be obtained on Day 1 of Cycle s 1, 2, 4 , and 8  at the following time points: 0 (predose within 
30 minutes) and 2 hours (±15  minutes) postdose.  
6.4.3.  Determination of Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
Model predicted area under the concentration × time curves  (AUCs) will be derived. Parameters 
of interest are AUC, minimum concentration (C min), maximum concentration (C max), clearance 
after oral administration (CL/F) , volume of distribution after oral administration (V z/F), AUC at 
steady state (AUC ss), Cmin at steady state (C min,ss ), and Cmax at steady state (C max,ss ). 
6.5. Biomarkers  
Biomarker classifiers will be evaluated in archival OC and TNBC tumor samples obtained 
during screening . In addition, in the subset of patients who undergo serial biopsies, biomarkers 
will be evaluated in fresh tumor samples obtained  at screening,  1 to 3 days before or on C3D1 
prior to pembrolizumab infusion  and, whenever possible, at the time of disease progression . Core 
biopsies (3 to 6) are preferred ; fine needle aspirate, frozen sampl e, plastic embedded sample, cell 
block, clot, or cytologic specimen will not be acceptable for analysis.

2, as well as at the  EOT visit for analysis of tumor -related circulating biomarkers, such as 
circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor DNA.  Biopsy samples will be collected and 
managed centrally, and tumor sections will be distributed to the designated translational research 
laboratories. DNA/RNA w ill be extracted from samples at a central location and analyzed for 
exploratory biomarkers including HRD mutational status of genes relevant for OC and TNBC,  
and RNA expression. Immunohistochemistry for PD -L1, as well as additional immune 
checkpoint prot eins and markers for infiltrating immune cellswill also be performed. Other 
exploratory analyses may be performed with the remaining samples.  
HRD status, PD -L1 positivity  and other biomarkers will be correlated with efficacy outcomes.  
Special attention wil l be devoted to subsets of OC and TNBC which may have distinct 
underlying DNA repair pathway deficiency ( homologous recombination , nucleotide excision 
repair ( NER ), and mismatch repair ( MMR ) deficiency) and distinct drug responses.  
Details on blood and tissue sample collection and analysis can be found in the Study  Manual.  
Samples from blood and tumor will be stored and may be used at a later time for biomarker 
testing , including potential to bridging to candidate companion diagnostic assays.

collection.  
5 For patients who do not have archival tissue, tissue from a fresh biopsy must be obtained prior to study treatment initiation . See the Study Ma nual for details on 
sample collection and processing.  
6 In patients who consent to serial biopsies, fresh tumor sample is to be obtained at screening, 1 to 3 days before or on C3D1 prior to pembrolizumab infusion , 
and when possible, at the time of disease  progression. See the Study Manual for details on sample collection and processing. The serial biopsies at different 
time points should be on the same lesion preferably. A core biopsy is recommended ; if an excisional or incisional biopsy is to be performed , it must be 
conducted on a non -target lesion . If a patient has had a biopsy within 12 weeks prior to entering screening, that biopsy may be accepted as the screening biops y. 
7 Standard of care tests/procedures, including biopsy, radiographic scans, laboratory assessments  (fasting glucose at baseline) , ECG, physical examination, vital 
signs, height, and weight, performed prior to the patient signing the informed consent form can be used as part of the screen ing assessments as long as the 
tests/procedu res meet the protocol -required timelines (ie, within 21 days of first dose for these procedures with the exception of the biopsy, which may have 
been conducted within 12 weeks of first dose, and pregnancy test, which must be conducted within 72 hours of fi rst dose) and any relevant guidelines (eg, 
diagnostic quality for scans).  
8 Required on Day 1 of Cycle 2 only.  
9 Blood  samples are to be obtained for niraparib and major metabolite M1, pembrolizumab PK assessments; see Table  8 and Table  9 for the detailed schedule.  10Tumor assessment per RECIST and irRE CIST via CT or MRI (chest, abdomen, and pelvis [brain, only if clinically indicated]) required at screening, every 9 
weeks (63 ±7 days) from Cycle 1/Day 1 for the first year, and then every 12 weeks (84 ±7 days) until progression; at the time  of progressio n, a final follow up 
set of images is required if not done within the last 4 weeks. The same modality (CT or MRI) should be used throughout the st udy for a given patient. If the 
chest (OC patients only) or brain (OC and TNBC patients) CT/MRI is clear at sc reening, repeat imaging of these areas is not required in the absence of clinical 
indication requiring follow ‐up. Positron emission tomography/CT may be used according to RECIST v1.1 guidelines. Bone scans should be conducted per 
standard of care. Timing of images will not be delayed for treatment interruptions, and tumor assessment should occur accordi ng to this schedule regardless of 
whether study treatment is interrupted. If a patient discontinues treatment for a reason other than progression or death, wit hdrawal of consent, or loss to follow -
up, scans and CA -125 testing (OC patients only) should continue at the  specified intervals.  
11 May be done within 24 hours prior to the visit.  
12 May be done at the study center’s local laboratory or at a laboratory local to the patient if the  laboratory  is included on FDA Form 1572.  
13 If dose interruption or modification is required at any point on study because of hematologic toxicity, twice -weekly (thrombocytopenia or neutropenia) or once 
weekly (anemia) blood draws (CBC) will be monitored until the AE resolves, and to ensure safety of the new dose, weekly blood  draws fo r CBC will also be 
required for a subsequent 3 week cycle after the AE has been resolved to the specified levels, after which monitoring every 3  weeks may resume.  
14 If screening laboratory testing (CBC, serum chemistry, CA -125, urinalysis) is performed wi thin 72 hours of first dose of study treatment on Day 1, repeat 
testing is not required.  
15 Serum chemistry to be conducted on Day 90 post -treatment (or to a minimum of 30 days post -treatment if the patient starts alternate anticancer therapy) to 
assess fo r possible ECI (see Section  6.1.6 ). The assessment may be done at the study center’s laboratory or at a laboratory local to the patient, if approved by 
the Principal Investigator as an adequate laboratory . This should be the same laboratory as conducted any Cycle 1/Day 8 CBC samples.  
16 Required for Phase 1 patients only . Required on Day 1 of Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 only.  
17 Negative serum pregnancy test required within 72 hours prior to first dose of study treatment on Day 1 for females of childbe aring potential; urine pregnancy 
test conducted every 3 cycles for duration of study (ie, Cycle 4, Cycle 7, etc.) and at the 30 -day safety follow -up visit. Pregnancy status must be determined 120 
days post treatment.  
18 If a patient discontinues treatment for a reason other than progression or death, withdrawal of consent, or loss to follow -up, CA -125 testing (OC patients only) 
should  continue at the intervals specified for tumor assessments.

FT4 to be collected at 30 -day post -treatme nt safety follow -up only if assessment is clinically indicated.  
20 Patients will undergo ECG monitoring as per Table  8 and Table  9. 21 Vital signs include blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Height obtained at screening only.  
22AEs are required to be captured through 30 days after cessation of study treatment, SAEs and ECIs (see Section  6.1.6 ) are required to be captured th rough 90 
days after cessation of study treatment (or to a minimum of 30 days post -treatment if the patient starts alternate anticancer therapy), and any pregnancies that 
occur within 120 days post -treatment are to be captured.  
23 Administer pembrolizumab o nce every 21 days (200 mg IV). Pembrolizumab may be administered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled Day 1 of each 
cycle after Cycle 2 due to administrative reasons.  24 See Table  10 for details of niraparib administration in Phase 1 , and Section  3.1.2.1  for the RP2D of the  combination.  Niraparib dose may be escalated on or 
after C3D1 from 200 mg daily to 300 mg daily if  hemoglobin ≥  9 g/dL,  platelets ≥ 100,000/µL and neutrophils ≥ 1500/µL for all labs performed during the first 
two cycles  after discussion with Medical Monitor or Designee . 
25 Niraparib dose administered upon completion of pembrolizumab infusion.  
26  Blood samples collected at screening and EOT will be stored for evaluation if the Sponsor's medical monitor finds evaluation necessary for assessing 
niraparib -related risk for M DS/AML (eg, the patient develops MDS/AML). Mutation profile before and after study treatment will be compared to determine 
whether any mutations were present prior to study treatment. Additional details on sample collection and analysis are in the Study Ma nual.  
27It is strongly recommended that any suspected MDS/AML case reported while a patient is receiving treatment or being followed for post -treatment assessments 
be referred to a local hematologist, who must perform bone marrow aspirate and biopsy testin g. A whole blood sample will also be collected for cytogenetic 
analysis (mutations of select myeloid -associated genes). Testing completed as part of standard of care is sufficient as long as the methods are acceptable to the 
Sponsor’s medical monitor. The study site must receive a copy of the hematologist’s report of aspirate/biopsy findings, which must include a classification 
according to WHO criteria, (64) and other sample testing results related to MDS/AML.

7.2.1.  Screening (Day -21 to Day -1) 
Standard of care tests/procedures, including laboratory assessments, ECG, physical examination, 
vital signs, height, an d weight, performed prior to the patient signing the informed consent form 
can be used as part of the screening assessments as long as the tests/procedures meet the 
protocol -required timelines (ie, within 21  days of first with the exception of the pregnanc y test 
which must be conducted within 72 hours of first dose) . Note that source documents must clearly 
identify the standard of care tests/procedures that are used for screening and the results of these 
tests/procedures must be entered in the eCRF.  
At screening, the following procedures/tests will be performed:  
 Obtain written informed consent  
 A single study ICF will be signed before any study procedures  
 Inclusion/exclusion criteria review  
 Demographics  
 Medical/surgical/cancer/medication history  
 Archival tumo r sample for biomarker testing  
 For patients who do not have archival tissue, tissue from a fresh biopsy must be 
obtained prior to study treatment initiation. See the Study Manual for details on 
sample collection and processing.  
 Optional tumor biopsy for biomarker testing  
 For patients who consented to serial biopsies. See the Study Manual for details on 
sample collection and processing. If a patient has had a biopsy within 12 weeks 
prior to entering screening, that biopsy may be accepted in lieu of  the sc reening 
biopsy.  
 Sample collection (whole blood) for cytogenetic analysis . 
 Tumor assessment (CT/MRI) for determination of measurable disease (RECIST v1.1)   
 Chest, abdomen , and pelvis (brain, if clinically indicated) CT (preferred method ) 
or MRI (if clinically indicated ). If the chest ( applies to OC patients only) and/or 
brain (applies to OC and TNBC patients) CT/MRI is clear at screening, repeat 
imaging is not required in the absence of clinical indication requiring follow ‐up. 
Positron emission tomog raphy  (PET) /CT may be used according to RECIST v1.1 
guidelines.  
 Scans performed  prior to informed consent  as part of routine clinical management 
are acceptable for use as initial tumor imaging if they are of diagnostic quality and 
are performed within 21 d ays prior to first dose date.  
 Bone scans performed per standard of care.

Details of  the statistical analyses presented below will be provided in the study’s statistical 
analysis plan (SAP) . A change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require 
a protocol amendment only if it alters a principal feature of the protoc ol. The SAP will be 
finalized prior to database lock . Any changes to the methods described in the plan will be 
described and justified in the final clinical study report.  
8.1. Study Populations  
Three analysis populations will be defined as follows:  
 Safety Popu lation: All patients who receive any amount of study drug. The 
assessment of DLTs in Phase 1 will include only those patients completing the first 
cycle of therapy, unless the patient discontinued study drug due to a DLT.  
 Full Analysis Set  (FAS): All patie nts who receive any amount of study drug. The 
primary analysis of efficacy endpoints will be performed on the FAS population.  
 Per-Protocol Population: All patients who receive at least two cycles of study drug, 
have protocol -required post -baseline disease assessments and have no major protocol 
violations that would impact efficacy evaluations. Supportive analys es of efficacy 
endpoints will be performed on the per -protocol population.  
8.2. Demographics, Medical History, Baseline Characteristics, and 
Concomitant M edications  
Demographics, baseline characteristics, and medical history information will be summarized by 
dose level for Phase 1, and by indication for Phase 2, for the Safety population using descriptive 
statistics . No formal statistical comparisons will b e performed.  
Demographic, baseline characteristics, and medical history data for each patient  will be provided 
in data listings.  
8.3. Safety Analyses  
The following key safety parameters will be evaluated  by study phase, pooled dose schedule 
across phases, by disease type, and overall , unless noted otherwise : 
 Dose -limiting toxicities during the first cycle (ie, during the first 21 days  of treatment , 
ie, Cycle 1/Day 1 through Cycle 1/Day 21 ) for Phase 1  
 Incidence of TEAEs during the first cycle compared to the second and subsequent 
cycles  
 Incidence of TEAEs  occurring while patients are on treatment or up to 30 days after 
the last dose of study drug   
 Incidence of SAEs and ECI occurring while patients are on treatment or up to 90 days 
after the last dose of study drug  
 Incidence of any new malignancies

Confidential   Page 99 of 122  Changes in clinical laboratory parameters (hematology, chemistry, thyroid function, 
coagulation, urinalysis), vital signs, ECOG performance status, ECG parameters, 
physical examinations,  and usage of concomitant medications  
All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) coding 
system and displayed in tables and data listings using system organ class and preferred term. 
Analyses of AEs will be perform ed for those events that are considered treatment -emergent, 
where treatment -emergent is defined per protocol as any AE with onset beginning at the day of 
first administration of study drug, throughout the treatment period until 30 days after the last 
dose of study drug, any SAE or ECI that occurs through 90 days after cessation of study 
treatment (or to a minimum of 30 days post-treatment if the patient starts alternate anticancer 
therapy), or any event that was present at baseline but worsened in intensity  or was subsequently 
considered drug -related by the Investigator through the end of the study. DLTs will be tabulated 
by dose level in Phase 1.  
The number and percentage of patient s with any TEAE, with any TEAE assessed by the 
Investigator as related to tr eatment (definite, probable, or possible relationship), and with any 
SAE will be summarized by treatment group and overall . In these tabulations, each patient  will 
contribute only once ( ie, the most related occurrence or the most intense occurrence) to eac h of 
the incidence rates in the descriptive analysis, regardless of the number of episodes. No formal 
hypothesis -testing analysis of AE incidence rates will be performed.  
The occurrence of and reasons for any requirement for dose interruption or modificati on will be 
tabulated, and distinguished as to presumptive causality from niraparib or pembrolizumab, if 
known.  
All AEs occurring on -study will be listed in patient  data listings. By -patient  listings also will be 
provided for the following : patient  deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to withdrawal.  
8.4. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
All patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug and have measureable drug concentrations 
will be included in PK analyses.  
Non-compartmental methods will be used to evaluate the PK charact eristics of niraparib and its 
major metabolite M1, and pembrolizumab as appropriate. Pharmacokinetic parameters to be 
determined will include AUC, AUC ss, Cmin, Cmax, CL/F, V z/F, Cmin,ss, and C max,ss. Plasma 
concentrations and PK parameter estimates will be  presented using descriptive statistics by dose 
level.  
8.5. Post-Treatment Analyses  
Descriptive summary statistics will be used to summarize post -treatment data (ie,  any new 
occurrence of MDS/AML ). 
8.6. Efficacy Analyses  
All efficacy endpoints will be summarized on the Phase 2 population by disease type; in 
addition, data may be  pooled for patients in Phase 1 and Phase 2, by  disease type. All analyses 
will include summary statistics, including number and percentage for categorical variables and

variables. Two -sided exact 90% confidence intervals (CIs) based on the Clopper -Pearson 
method  (67) will be provided where appropriate. Time -to-event analyses will be performed using 
Kaplan -Meier (KM) methods. Comparisons in the Phase 1 portion of the study will be made 
using descriptive statistics. As the Phase 2 portion of the study is single -arm, any statistical 
analysis  to be performed among subgroups is for descriptive and future study purposes.  
8.6.1.  Primary Efficacy Parameter  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be ORR, defined as the achievement of C R or PR using 
RECIST ( v1.1), as assessed by the Investig ator. Point estimates and 1-sided 95% CI, 
corresponding to the specifications of the sample size calculation  will be provided.  The primary 
analysis will be performed for each patient cohort and no multiplicity adjustment will be made 
since separate inferen ces will be drawn for each cohort.  
8.6.2.  Secondary Efficacy Parameter(s)  
Objective response rate as assessed by the Investigator using irRECIST will be assessed as a 
secondary endpoint.  
Disease control rate will be assessed as a secondary endpoint and is defined  as the proportion of 
patients achieving best overall response of CR, PR, or SD as assessed by the Investigator per 
RECIST v1.1 and irRECIST , with point estimates and 2-sided 90% CIs.  
Duration of response, PFS and OS will be presented through use of summar y statistics using KM 
methods , to include 25th, 50th (median) , and 75th percentiles and associated 2-sided 95% CIs , 
number of events and number of censored observations . DOR and PFS will be defined by both 
RECIST v1.1 and irRECIST criteria, based on the date of PD that will be used to determine 
duration , and will be analyzed separately by both criteria .  
8.7. Biomarker Analyses  
For each patient in the study, blood and tumor samples will be prospectively collected, evaluated 
and archived to support exploratory biomarker analysis . PD-L1 expression  (retrospective 
analysis) , HRD score, immune cell infiltrates , and other exploratory biomarkers will be 
correlated with response.  
8.8. Probability of Dose Escalation  
Based on the dose escalation schema planned for the Phase 1 portion of the study as outlined in 
Section  3.1.2 , the following decision rules will be u sed to determine if a dose is or is not 
increased:

Abbreviations:  DLT = dos -limiting toxicity; NA = not applicable; second 6 patients are not required to be enrolled.  
To model the probabilities of dose escalation given various rates of true hematological and non -
hematological DLTs, let X = number of hematological DLTs observ ed and Y = number of non -
hematological DLTs observed . Then the joint distribution of (X,Y) is multinomial (trinomial) 
with parameters: N = number of patients evaluated, PH = true probability of a hematological 
DLT, and PN = true probability of a non -hemato logical DLT . There are 2 probabilities to 
calculate . First, the probability of escalation based on the first 6 patients enrolled . Second is the 
conditional probability of escalation based on the second 6 patients enrolled, given (X,Y) = (1,1) 
or (0,2) in t he first 6 patients . The probability of dose escalation is the sum of these 2 
probabilities . It is assumed that a given patient cannot have more than 1 DLT, and that 
hematologic DLTs take precedence over non -hematologic DLTs . The following graph presents 
the probabilities of dose escalation for ranges of true rates of DLTs, where it is assumed the true 
rates will be approximately 18% (range 12 -24%) for hematologic DLTs and 5% (range 3 -7%) for 
non-hematologic DLTs.  
As shown in Figure 2, the probability of dose escalation decreases as the DLT rate increases, as 
expected . Over the restricted range of DLT rates, the probabilities are close to a linear 
relatio nship as the true DLT rates increase.

Figure 3 shows the probability of dose escalation for a standard 3+3 escalation design, contrasted 
with the 6 + 6 design , at the fixed rate of 0.05 for non -hematologic DLTs (the anticipated rate) . 
As can be seen,  the protocol -specified 6 + 6 design has a similar probability of escalation as the 
3+3 design , and is, in fact, somewhat more conservative for hematologic DLT rates >0.15 .

have at least 2  post-baseline  tumor assessments. A formal decision regarding futility, which 
could result in stopping the study  early, will be conducted separately for the TNBC and OC 
cohorts and will only be made from the analysis of 24 patients  within each cohort . The earlier  
response  assessments, however, will inform the conduct of the formal interim analysis as 
follows: If no responder is observed in all three response assessments from 6, 12, and 18 
patients, then enroll ment will be suspended after 24 patients have been enrolled, and no further 
patients will be enrolled until the result of the formal interim analysis of 24 patients is known. If 
≥1 responder is observed in any single response assessment from 6, 12, or 18 p atients, then 
enrollment will not be curtailed. The decision rule regarding the formal interim analysis at N=24 
is as follows: If there are fewer than 3 responders out of 24, enrollment may be closed and the 
corresponding cohort may be stopped for futility.  Otherwise, the study will continue to the 
planned enrollment of 48 patients.  
8.10. Determination of Sample Size  
Phase 1: In the Phase 1 portion of this study, 14 patients with advanced TNBC or OC were 
enrolled in Dose Level 1 or Dose Level 2 . Twelve patients were eligible for DLT evaluation . In 
Dose Level 1, 1 of 6 DLT -eligible patients experienced multiple DLTs including G rade3 anemia, 
Grade 4 neutropenia, and G rade 4 thrombocytopenia . In Dose Level 2, 1 of 6 DLT -eligible 
patients experienced 1 DLT, G rade 4 thrombocytopenia; an additional patient experienced an

Phase 2: A total of approximately 96 evaluable patients ( approximately 48 patients in each tumor 
type) will be enrolled to ensure understanding of the activity of the combination treatment With 
48 patients treated in each cohort, observed 12 responses (CR and/or PR) at the final analysis 
will rule out a 15% response rate. The s tudy has approximately 82%/94% power for each cohort 
to rule out a ≤15% ORR (null hypothesis) when the true ORR is 30%/35% at the 10% type I 
error rate (two -sided) .

Recommendations. —The Panel recommends that  ER and PgR status be determined on all 
invasive breast cancers and breast cancer recurrences. A testing algorithm that relies on accurate, 
reproducible assay performance is proposed. Elements to reliably reduce assay variation are 
specified. It is recomme nded that ER and PgR assays be considered positive if there are at least 
1% positive tumor nuclei in the sample on testing in the presence of expected reactivity of 
internal (normal epithelial elements) and external controls.

Confidential   Page 118 of 122 APPENDIX  D. RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID 
TUMORS (RECIST), V1.1  
Response Criteria by RECIST v1.1 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference  the baseline sum diameters . 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to th e relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note : the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progressions).  
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor suff icient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study . 
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must  be non -pathological in size ( < 10 mm short axis) . 
Note : If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target les ion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump 
target  lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion 
increase.  
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of the 
treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator).  
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progre ssion/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will 
depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

** Only for non -randomized trials with response as primary endpoint.  
*** In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non -target lesions may be accepted as disease 
progression.  
Note:  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective 
evidence of disease progre ssion at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should 
be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

*‘Non -CR/non -PD’ is preferred over ‘stable disease’ for non -target disease since SD is increasingly used as an 
endpoint for assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not 
advised

BY GYNECOLOGIC CANCE R INTERGROUP (GCIG) 
CRITERIA  
Because of the pelvic location of the primary tumor in patients with OC and the frequent 
occurrence of peritoneal disease, imagin g may not always be reliable for documentation of PD in 
patients with OC . Criteria other than RECIST may be applicable to define PD in these patients . 
For this protocol, the GCIG criteria for disease progression will also be considered for patients 
with OC .(66) Based on these criteria, PD may also be determined if at least 1 of the following 
criteria is met:  
1. Addi tional diagnostic tests ( eg, histology/cytology, ultrasound techniques, endoscopy, 
positron emission tomography) identify new lesions or determine existing lesions qualify 
for unequivocal PD AND CA -125 progression according to GCIG criteria.  
2. Definitive cli nical signs and symptoms of PD unrelated to nonmalignant or iatrogenic 
causes ([a] intractable cancer -related pain; [b] malignant bowel obstruction/worsening 
dysfunction; or [c] unequivocal symptomatic worsening of ascites or pleural effusion) 
AND CA -125 p rogression according to GCIG criteria.  
Abnormal CA -125 levels on -study do not represent disease progression; however, they may 
prompt imaging if clinically indicated . Progressive disease will not be diagnosed in case of 
CA-125 progression in the absence of  at least 1 of the criteria defined above .  
The Investigator will describe how PD was diagnosed in the eCRF.  
The date of PD is defined as the earliest time point when one of the PD criteria is met . If 
CT/MRI shows existing (baseline) lesions that only equi vocally suggest PD and additional 
diagnostic tests are required to determine unequivocal PD, the official date of PD will be the date 
PD was unequivocally determined . Alternatively, with new lesions (except ascites and effusions) 
that are initially equivoc al that are later unequivocally determined, the date of progression will 
be the date the lesion was initially identified.

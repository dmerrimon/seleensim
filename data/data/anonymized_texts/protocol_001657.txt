J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  4 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Primary Objective  
 
To determine the objective response rate (ORR)  using Response Evaluation Criteria for 
Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1 ) in two cohorts of subjects with previously treated metastatic 
pancreatic cancer : Arm A  treated with cyclophosphamide (CY)/  
nivolumab/ipilimumab/ GVAX pancreas vaccine followed by nivolumab/ipilimumab/  
CRS -207 and Arm B  treated with  nivolumab/ipilimumab/CRS -207. 
 
1.2 Secondary Objective  
 
1.2.1 To assess safety and characterize toxicities of each vaccine treatment regimen when 
combined with anti-PD-1 and anti -CTLA -4 blockade in subjects with metastatic 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  
 
1.3 Exploratory Objectives  
 
1.3.1 To assess the overall survival (OS).  
 
1.3.2  To assess progression free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), and time to 
progression (TTP) by RECIST 1.1.  
 
1.3.3 To measure tumor marker kinetics (CA 19 -9) in subjects receiving treatment and 
correlate with OS, PFS, and best overall response.  
 
1.3.4  To assess the ORR , PFS, and DOR  by immune -related response criteria (irRC) .  
 
1.3.5  To collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) , plasma,  and serum to 
identify potential therapeutic targets , biomarkers and predictors of response  (OS, 
PFS and best overall response)  and autoimmune toxicity.  
 
• Measure pre - and post-treatment changes in PBMCs including effector, 
helper, and regulatory T cells, NK cells, monocytes, and macrophages  
through cell phenotyping analysis and gene expression profiling .  
 
• Correlate induction of Listeria monocytogenes  (Lm)- and mesothelin 
antigen -specific T cell responses and changes to the  T cell epitope repertoire 
with OS, PFS , and best overall response . 
 
• Correlate  telomere length of lymphocytes to help predict response  (OS, 
PFS, and best overall response) .  
 
• Correlate the i nduction of anti-thyroglobulin and anti-galectin -3 antibody 
responses with response  (OS, PFS , and best overall response) .   
 
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  5 • Proteomic approaches will be used on pre - and post-treatment sera to 
identify targets and biomarkers of response  (OS, PFS , and best overall 
response) or toxicity.  
 
1.3.6  To collect archived tissue and pre - and post-treatment biopsies to test for predictors 
of response (OS, PFS , and best overall response) and future targets for 
combinatorial therapy.   
• Immunohistochemistry  (IHC)  and/or gene expression profiling will be used 
to compare the nature of tumors and immune infiltrates for responders 
versus non -responders .   
• Next -generation sequencing of T cell receptor (TCR) genes may be used to 
compare the tumor infiltrating T cell repertoire in re sponders and non -
responders  
• Up-regulation of immune inhibitory molecules (such as programmed death -
ligand 1 [ PD-L1]) will be evaluated  in the pre- and post -treatment samples.  
 
• Proteomic approaches to quantify protein expression and activation of 
specific signaling pathways in tumors from responders vers us non -
responders . 
1.3.7 To collect stool and oral wash  samples pre - and post -treatment to identify candidate 
gut microbial biomarkers and predictors of response ( OS, PFS and best overall 
response)    
• Microbial com munity analysis to correlate gut microbiome composition 
with response (OS,  PFS and best overall response).  
 
• Whole metagenome functional profiling analysis via shotgun sequencing 
to correlate microbiome composition and microbial functions and 
pathways with response (OS, PFS and best overall response) . 
 
1.4 Study Design  
 
This is a multi -center, open -label, randomized , phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and clinical 
activity  of nivolumab and ipilimumab in combination with either sequential administration of 
CY/GVAX pancreas vaccine followed by CRS -207 (Arm A) or with administration of CRS -207 
alone (Arm B)  in subjects with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma who have progres sed after 
at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen . The primary endpoint of this study is objective response 
rate (ORR) using RECIST 1.1.  Approximately 63 subjects will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to 
the two treatment arms to achieve 60 treated subjects  (i.e. allowing for 5% loss) . 
 
The study will consist of a screening period (within 21 days of first dose), a treatment period per 
the table below , and a follow -up period.

Subjects who are still 

J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  7 receiving treatment at the time of study close may complete the current treatment course and the 
EOT evaluation prior to transitioning to long -term follow -up. Subjects wi ll be considered in the 
treatment  period until 28 days  after the last dose of study drug . Blood cultures through a peripheral 
vein and also through a central line (if applicable) will be collected to monitor for the presence of 
CRS -207 per Section 5.13 . 
 
After completion of treatment and EOT assessment s, all subjects , including those who did not 
receive treatment, will continue to be followed every three months (+/ - 2 weeks) by telephone, e -
mail, or optional clinic visit until death, withdrawal of consent, or closure of study .  Subjects will 
also be contacted at 100 days (+14 day reporting window) from the last dose of nivolumab / 
ipilimumab  or 28 days (+7 day reporting window) from the last dose of cyclophosphamide, 
GVAX, or CRS -207 if the subject  never rece ived nivolumab /ipilimumab or is no longer receiving 
nivolumab /ipilimumab due to toxicity , whichever reporting period is longer . Information on 
survival and new cancer therapies will be collected.  In addition, all subjects that received at least 
one dose of  CRS -207 will be monitored for CRS -207 infection for one year per Section 5.13 . 
 
All subjects  who discontinue study treatment should continue to be monitored for disease status 
by radiologic imaging  every two months (+/ - 2 weeks)  until: 1) the start of a new antineoplastic 
therapy (information of the new cancer therapy will be collected), 2) disease progression, 3 ) death , 
4) withdrawal  of consent, or  5) the close of the study , whichever occurs first.    
All subjects  will be followed after their l ast dose of study drug for the development of adverse 
events  (AEs ) and serious adverse events (SAEs) as described in Section 7.5.1 .  
 
The primary analysis will be conducted when all treated subjects have documented response or 
progression by RECIST 1.1, or  have discontinued  the study . Information on survival may continue 
to be gathered for supplementary analyses after the completion of the primary analysis. At the 
conclusion of the study, all remaining subjects will be offered enrollment in a long -term follow -
up study and continue to be followed for survival.  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Disease  
 
Despite  decades of basic and clinical research, effective therapy for the treatment of patients with 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PAC) remains one of the grea test unmet clinical needs in 
oncology today. Currently, PAC accounts for approximately 7% of all cancer -related mortality 
and has the lowest 5 -year survival rate among all cancer types in the United States . PAC is 
currently the 4th leading cause of death from cancer in the U.S. with estimates in 2016 for 53,070 
people diagnosed and about 41,780 dying from the disease1.  Worldwide it will claim more than 
300,000 lives this year2.  It is projected that by 2030, pancreatic cancer will become the second 
leading cause of cancer -related death in the US3.  
 
Most patients are initially diagnosed with advanced disease that is inoperable with median survival 
of less th an 1 year. Patients with advanced disease are usually treated with chemotherapy, with the 
intent of prolonging survival and palliating symptoms (pain, weight loss and decrease in 
performance status). From 1997, gemcitabine was the standard chemotherapy for  advanced 
pancreatic cancer after demonstrating a significant improvement in survival compared to 5 -
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  8 fluorouracil (5 -FU)4. Median survival was 5.65 months for gemcitabine -treated patients and 4 .41 
months for 5 -FU treated patients, while overall tumor response rates were 5.4% and 0%, 
respectively.  
 
Until recently, only erlotinib, an oral epidermal growth factor (EGF) inhibitor, was shown in a 
Phase 3 study to modestly improve median OS in combination with gemcitabine over gemcitabine 
alone (6.24 months for the doublet versus  5.91 months for gemcitabine alone) without a significant 
difference in ORR between the treatments5. In 2011, a Phase 2/3 trial conducted by a French 
consortium study group demonstrated FOLFIRINOX, a combined regimen of oxaliplatin, 
irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin significantly increased survival in patients with pancreatic 
cancer over gemcitabine alone. Median OS was 11.1 months versus 6.8 months for each treatment, 
respectively (hazard ratio [HR] for death, 0.57; 95% confidenc e interval [CI], 0.45 to 0.73; p < 
0.001). The ORR was also increased to 31.6% from 9.4% ( p < 0.001). Adverse events were 
increased in the FOLFIRINOX group and 5.4% of patients in this group experienced febrile 
neutropenia6. Although FOLFIRINOX represents an efficacious regimen in pancreatic  cancer, 
there are still concerns about its potential toxicity and it is being reserved for the most fit patients.  
 
In the MPACT ( Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Clinical Trial) study, nab-paclitaxel 
combined with gemcitabine demonstrated a statistica lly significant and clinically meaningful 
median OS of 8.5 versus 6.7 months (HR 0.72, p < 0.0001 including a 59% increase in one -year 
survival (35% versus 22%, p=0.0002) and demonstrated double the rate of survival at two years 
(9% versus 4%, p=0.02) as c ompared to gemcitabine alone in previously untreated patients with 
metastatic pancreatic cancer. nab-/gemcitabine also demonstrated a statistically significant 
improvement in key secondary endpoints compared to gemcitabine alone, including a 31% 
reduction in the risk of progression or death with a median PFS of 5.5 versus 3.7 months (HR 0.69, 
p < 0.0001) and an ORR of 23% compared to 7% (response rate ratio of 3.19, p < 0.0001)7. The 
MPACT study and regimen formed the basis for full FDA approval in September 2013 for the 
first-line treat ment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.  
 
Nanoliposomal irinotecan in combination with 5 -FU was recently approved for patients with 
previously treated pancreatic cancer.  However, it is unknown if this combination is better than 5 -
FU and irinotec an (FOLFIRI) as 5 -FU was the comparator and there was no benefit in patients 
who previously received irinotecan so the value of this drug is questionable in FOLFIRINOX 
treated patients8.  Therapies for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer are urgently needed.  
 
Novel approaches, such as immunotherapy, hold promise in this very difficult cancer.    
 
2.2 Rationale  
 
Therapeutic benefit of immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer remains to be seen.  Single agent 
therapy using vaccines to induce antigen -specific T cells or targeting immune checkpoints such as 
programmed death -1 (PD -1) or cytotoxic T -lymphocyte associated pro tein-4 (CTLA -4) does not 
address the complex immunosuppressive mechanisms at play both at the systemic level and in the 
tumor microenvironment. Effective immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer may require 
combinations of 2 or more agents to overcome this toler ance.  Various combination strategies are 
being tested in less immunogenic tumors. CTLA -4 or PD -1 inhibition with pancreatic cancer 
vaccines is currently being studied with GVAX Pancreas (allogeneic pancreatic cancer cells

antigen mesothelin). In each of these studies, there have been a handful of objective responses but 
in general pancreatic cancer has been refractory to immunotherapy and triplet approaches may be 
necess
ary.  Numerous studies are targeting various immune checkpoints and stimulatory agonists 
but it could possibly be futile without a vaccine to induce infiltration of an inflammatory infiltrate 
including effector T cells into the tumor.

Vaccine
 

J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  20  
Local vaccine site reaction may be treated with topical applications of aloe vera or vitamin 
E gel or lotion. Significa nt local inflammation that is causing the subject  severe pain or is 
interfering with the activities of daily living may be treated with oral analgesics. Local 
toxicities of pruritus at the vaccine sites and systemic pruritus may be treated with topical 
or oral diphenhydramine hydrochloride (Benadryl®) or topical aloe vera. If oral 
diphenhydramine hydrochloride is used the recommended dose shall be 25 -50 mg every 
four to six hours as needed for pruritus, not to exceed 300 mg/day. Cases of local ulceration 
should be manageable with local wound care, with or without antibiotics. Severe local 
inflammation or significant clinical autoimmunity will be managed on a case-by-case basis.  
 
5.2.3 CRS -207 
 
Guidance on treatment of the common infusion reactions related to  CRS -207 dosing is as 
follows:  
 
• Fevers:  Despite the acetaminophen premedication, subjects can spike fevers up 
to 40°C starting at the end of the CRS -207 infusion generally through the next 
24 hours. Oral ibuprofen (400 to 800 mg) and acetaminophen (650 to 1000 mg) 
may be used in alternate sequen ce every 4 hours.  
 
• Rigors : Rigors (generally once or twice per infusion) have been observed to 
start during or at the end of a CRS -207 infusion through 24 hours. IV narcotics 
such as morphine or meperidine may be administered per institutional policy. 
Oral morphine or non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g., 
aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen) may be used as home treatment.  
 
• Blood pressure : Decreases in blood pressure have been observed necessitating 
additional IV fluids during the 4 hour observation  period (up to 1 or 2 liters). 
Reasons for this include the development of fever, compartmental shifts of fluid 
resulting from the CRS -207 infusion and the  use of narcotics. Some subjects 
have also been slightly hypotensive at 24 hours upon arrival to the clinic after 
CRS -207 administration . Subjects are encouraged to hydrate themselves 
liberally at home with oral fluids.  
 
• Nausea and vomiting : Nausea and vomiting have been reported and observed 
within 24 hours after CRS -207 infusion. Subjects may be given a nti-emetics as 
needed.  
 
Blood draws for clinical hematology and serum chemistry  will be done the day  after the 
CRS -207 infusion . Any unexpected grade 3 or greater laboratory abnormalities should be 
repeated within 24 -72 hours.  Grade 3 or greater creatinine , AST, ALT, and bilirubin should 
be repeated within 24 -72 hours as well.  
 
5.2.4 Nivolumab  and Ipilimumab  
 
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  21 Nivolumab and ipilimumab are  fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 
antibod ies. Subjects should be closely monitored for potential AEs during antibody 
infusion and potential AEs throughout the study.  
 
5.2.4.1 Infusion Reactions  
Since nivolumab and ipilimumab contain only human immunoglobulin protein 
sequences, it is unlikely to be immunogenic and induce an infusion or 
hypersensitivity r eaction. However, if such a reaction were to occur, it might manifest 
with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruritis, arthralgias, hypo - or hypertension, 
bronchospasm, or other symptoms. All grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions should be 
reported within 2 4 hours to the Protocol Chair  and BMS  and reported as an SAE if 
criteria are met. Infusion reactions should be graded according to CTCAE (version 
4.03) guidelines. Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be 
modified based on local treatment standards and guidelines as appropriate:  
 
For grade 1 symptoms ( mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; 
intervention not indicated):  
 
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. The following 
prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen  325 to 1000 mg at 
least 30 minutes before additional nivolumab or ipilimumab administrations.  
 
For grade 2 symptoms ( moderate reaction requires therapy or infu sion interruption 
but responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [e .g., antihistamines, non -steroidal 
anti-inflammatory  drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; 
prophylactic medications indicated for 24 hours):  
 
Stop the nivolumab or ipilimumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, 
and treat the subject with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or 
acetaminophen  325 to 1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor subject until 
resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid or bron chodilator therapy may also be 
administered as appropriate. If the infusion is interrupted, restart the infusion at 50% 
of the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve; if no further complications 
ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 10 0% of the original infusion 
rate. Monitor subject closely. If symptoms recur then no further nivolumab or 
ipilimumab will be administered at that visit. Administer diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, 
and remain at bedside and monitor the subject until resolution of symptoms. The 
amount of study drug infused must be recorded on the case report form (CRF). The 
following prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen  325 to 1000 mg 
should be a dministered at least  30 minutes before additional nivolumab  or 
ipilimumab  administrations.  
 
For grade 3 or grade 4 symptoms ( severe reaction, grade 3: prolonged [i .e., not rapidly 
responsive to symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion] ; 
recurrence of symptoms following initial improvement; hospitalization indicated for 
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  22 other clinical sequelae [e .g., renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]; grade 4: (life 
threatening; pressor or ventilator support indicated):  
 
Immediately di scontinue infusion of nivolumab  or ipilimumab . Begin an IV infusion 
of normal saline, and treat the subject as follows. Recommend bronchodilators, 
epinephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1,000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 
to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution injected slowly for IV administration, and/or 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as 
needed. Subject should be monitored until the investigator is comfortable that the 
symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab and ipilimuma b will be permanently 
discontinued. Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the 
treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from 
symptoms. In the case of late -occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (e .g., appearance 
of a localized or generalized pruritis within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic 
treatment may be given (e .g., oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids).  
 
Please refer to Section 6.2  for guidelines regarding  ipilimumab, GVAX and CRS -
207 treatment delays  following a nivolumab or ipilimumab infusion -related reaction.  
 
5.2.4.2 Nivolumab  and Ipilimumab -Related Adverse Events  
 
Blocking PD-1 or CTLA -4 function may permit the emergence of auto -reactive T 
cells and resultant clinical autoimmunity. Rash /pruritus , diarrhea/colitis, 
pneumonitis, hepatitis , and hypothyroidism  were drug -related, presumptive 
autoimmune events noted in previous nivolumab  and ipilimumab studies.   
 
For the purposes of this study, a  nivolumab  or ipilimumab -related  AE is defin ed as 
an AE of unknown etiology, associated with drug exposure and is consistent with an 
immune phenomenon. Efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, 
metabolic, toxin or other etiologic causes. Serological, immunological, and 
histological (biopsy) data should be used to support the diagnosis of an immune -
mediated toxicity. Suspected nivolumab  or ipilimumab -related AEs must be 
documented on an AE or SAE CRF.  Identification  and treatment of nivolumab  and 
ipilimumab -related AEs can be found in  Appendix B . Additional guidance can be 
found in the nivolumab and ipilimumab Investigator ’s Brochure s (IB). Antibiotics 
will also be administered to subjects who have not yet received antibiotics for CRS -
207 and the subject  requires steroids for a suspected nivolumab  or ipilimumab -related 
AE (Section 5. 5). 
 
Subjects  who experience a grade 2 or higher nivolumab  or ipilimumab -related AE 
should be discussed with the Protocol Chair  and IND sponsor immediately.  
 
5.3 Prohibited and/or Restricted Medications  and Devices  
 
The following therapies or devices are not permitted during the treatment period (if  administered, 
the subject may be removed from the study):  
 
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  23 •  Any non -study anticancer chemotherapy or immunotherapy (approved or 
investigational)  
• Any major surgery or surgical procedure; if required must be discussed with the Protocol 
Chair to determine if it is appropriate for the subject to continue study treatment  
•  TNF pathway inhibitors or PI3 kinase inhibitors  
•  Another  investigational agent  
•  Filgrastim (Neupogen® or G -CSF) or sargramostim (Leukine® or GM -CSF)  
• Live vaccines (examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to: measles, mumps, 
rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid [oral] vac cine). Seasonal 
influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed. 
However, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. Flu -Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and 
are not allowed.  
• The use of anticoagulants is known to increas e the risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. 
Since gastrointestinal hemorrhage is an adverse reaction with nivolumab, subjects who 
require concomitant anticoagulant therapy should be monitored closely.  
• Implanted medical devices that pose high risks for colonization and cannot be easily 
removed (e.g., artificial heart valves, pacemakers, prosthetic joints, orthopedic screw(s), 
metal plate(s)) if infection occurs are prohibited. Other common devices such as venous 
access devices (e.g., Port -a-Cath or Medip ort), arterial and venous stents, and dental and 
breast implants may be permitted if approved by the Protocol Chair.  
• Palliative (limited -field) radiation therapy is permitted, but only for pain control and with 
approval by the Protocol Chair or IND Spons or. 
• Systemically active steroids can be used but should be reported to the Protocol Chair 
and/or IND Sponsor. Steroid treatment should be completed at least 14 days prior to 
resuming study -related treatments.  Patients requiring adrenal replacement steroid doses 
< 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent (in the absence of active autoimmune disease) may 
resume treatment if approved by the Protocol Chair  or the IND Sponsor . Patients 
requiring replacement doses of steroids are required to discontinue treatment with C RS-
207. 
• If steroids or immunosuppressive agents are required during treatment, prophylactic 
antibiotics will be administered as outlined in Section 5.5.  
 
In addition, the following therapies should not be administered during the  treatment period unless 
medically necessary and approval must be obtained from  the Protocol Chair  for a subject to 
continue dosing if therapy is given  concurrently with study participation:  
 
•  General anesthesia  
•  Aspirin >325 mg/day (chronic daily use of aspirin ≤325 mg/day and heparin  flushes for 
central lines are allowed  except during CRS -207 infusions through 4 days after each 
CRS -207 infusion. ) 
•  More than 3 g/day of acetaminophen  
•  Systemic antibiotics  
 
5.4 Other Restrictions and Precautions  
 
Palliative (limited -field) rad iation therapy is permitted, but only for pain control to sites present at 
baseline and with approval by  the Protocol Chair  or IND Sponsor .

Definition of an Overdose for t
his Protocol
 
 

J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  26 Overdose of nivolumab  or ipilimumab are  defined as:  
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional admi nistration of any dose of a product that 
is considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdose must be 
reported as SAEs (see  Section 7.5.1  for reporting details).  Appropriate supportive treatment should 
be provided if clinically  indicated.  
 
All reports of overdose with and without an AE must be reported within 24 hours to the Protocol 
Chair, IND Sponsor ( Dr. Elizabeth Jaffee), and Bristol -Myers Squibb ( BMS ). IND Sponsor , and 
BMS  contact information can be found in Section 7.5.1 . 
5.7 Unacceptable T oxicity  
 
Unacceptable toxicities are defined as : 
 
1. Any treatment -related > grade 3 AEs .  Exceptions include:  
 
• Asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities  
• Grade 3 fatigue  
• Grade 3 dermatologic AEs that are considered mild in severity but only considered grade 
3 because of >30% body surface involvement   
• Fever, chills, rigors, hypertension, hypotension, syncope, or hypoxia occurring within 12 
hours of CRS -207 administration  
• Diarrhea,  nausea, or vomiting that resolves to < grade 3 within 24 hours of intervention  
• Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia or grade 3 endocrinopathies where symptoms are controlled on 
hormone replacement therapy  
 
2. Any of the following  toxicities related to  CRS -207: 
 
• A fever of >40°C that lasts for greater than 24 hours and does not respond to antipyretics . 
• Clinically significant hypotension unresponsive to IV fluids ( e.g., systolic blood pressure 
[BP] <90 mm Hg or mean arterial pressure <55 mm Hg as measured on two separate 
occasions at least 10 minutes apart) . 
• Initiation of antibiotic therapy, coincident with simultaneous isolation of CRS -207 from a 
normally sterile body site, other than blood (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid, joint fluid) . 
 
3. Treatment related b lood bilirubin > 5 x ULN or concurrent blood bilirubin > 2 x ULN and AST 
or ALT > 3 x ULN  
 
4. Treatment related e ye pain ≥ grade 2 or reduction of visual acuity that does not respond to 
topical therapy an d does not improve to ≤ grade 1 severity within 2 weeks of starting therapy, 
or requires systemic therapy is an unacceptable toxicity.  
 
Unexpected Grade 3 or greater laboratory abnormalities should be repeated within 24 -72 hours if 
clinically indicated and  monitored as necessary to determine if event meets toxicity criteria.  Grade 
3 or greater creatinine, AST, ALT, and bilirubin should be repeated within 24 -72 hours as well.  
 
The proportion of unacceptable toxicities will be monitored  separately in each arm . If the toxicity 
levels in  either treatment arm (A or B)  are unacceptable , then  enrollment  will be  suspended until 
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  27 further review and consideration by the  Protocol Chair , IND Sponsor , and the Medical Expert 
Committee (MEC) . If treatment in one arm is permanently discontinued due to toxicity, the other  
arm may continue  as long as the toxicity level remains acceptable . There will be no dose reductions 
for CY, nivolumab , ipilimumab, CRS -207, or GVAX pancreas  vaccine . 
 
The propor tion of treated subjects with unacceptable toxicity will be monitored using a Bayesian 
stopping guideline.  A Beta  (1.5, 5.5) prior, representing a toxicity rate of 21%, a slightly 
conservative estimate,  was used in the development of our guidelines.  The therapy will be re -
evaluated if the posterior probability that the toxicity rate exceeds the 33% boundary is greater 
than 50%.  Toxicity will be monitored continuously. Table 3 summarizes the stopping bo undaries 
for unacceptable toxicities.  
 
Table 3.  The number of toxicities needed to trigger stopping guidelines  throughout the course of 
the study.

The probability of triggering the stopping guidelines was assessed for a range of possible true 
toxicity rates using simulations with 10,000 replicates ( Table 4).  The probability of stopping to 
re-evaluate was 7.3% if the true proportion with an unacceptable toxicity was 15%.  In comparison, 
the prob ability of stopping early is 72.6% if the true proportion with  an unacceptable toxicity was 
33%.

5.8 WOCBP, Contraception, Use in Pregnancy, Use in Nursing  
 
A WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone 
surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) and is not postmenopausal. 
Menopause is defined  clinically  as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over age 45 years in the 
absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, women under the age of 62 years 
must have a documented  serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level >  40mIU/mL to confirm 
menopause.  
 
Women treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are likely to have artificially suppressed 
FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic F SH level. The 
duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of the washout 
period below are suggested guidelines and the investigators should use their judgment in checking 
serum FSH levels. If the serum FSH level is >4 0 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, 
the woman can be considered postmenopausal:  
 
• 1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)  
• 4 week minimum for transdermal products  
• 8 week minimum for oral products  
 
5.8.1 Contraception  
 
The investigational agents used in this protocol  may have adverse effects on a fetus in 
utero . Furthermore, it is not known if the investigational agents have  transient adverse 
effects on the composition of sperm.  Non-pregnant, non -breast -feeding women may  be 
enrolled if they are considered highly unlikely to conceive. Highly unlikely to conceive is 
defined as 1) surgically sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal ( defined as a woman who is > 45 
years of age and has not had menses for greater than 12 months  and women under the age 
of 62 must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 
40mlU/mL will be considered postmenopausal ). or 3) amenorrheaic for <  2 years without 
a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and with a documented FSH va lue in the 
postmenopausal range, or ) not heterosexually active for the duration of the study, or 5) 
heterosexually active and willing to use 2 methods of birth control (which is also required 
for the female partners of male subjects ). The 2 birth control methods can be 2 barrier 
methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy, used 
throughout the study starting with Visit 1  through 5 months  after the last dose of study 
drug.  Male subjects  enrolled in this study must also agree to use an adequate method of 
contraception starting with Visit 1 through 7 months  after the last dose of study drug . 
 
Investigators shall counsel WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with 
WOCBP on the impo rtance of pregnancy prevention and the implications of an unexpected 
pregnancy Investigators shall advise WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active 
with WOCBP on the use of highly effective methods of contraception. Highly effective 
methods of contra ception have a failure rate of < 1% per year when used consistently and 
correctly.  
 
 
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  29 HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION  
• Male condoms with spermicide  
• Hormonal methods of contraception including combined oral contraceptive pills, 
vaginal ring, injectables, implants, and intrauterine devices (IUDs) such as Mirena 
by WOCBP subject or male subject’s WOCBP partner.  
• Nonhormonal IUDs, such as ParaGard  
• Tubal ligation  
• Vasectomy  
• Complete abstinence * 
 
*Complete abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse and is 
an acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs. Abstinence is only acceptable when 
this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., 
calendar, ovulation, symptother mal, profession of abstinence for entry into a clinical trial, 
post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
Subjects who choose complete abstinence are not required to use a second method of 
contraception, but female subjects must continue to have pregnancy tests. Acceptable 
alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the event that the 
subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.  
 
LESS EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION  
• Diaphragm with spermicide  
• Cervical cap with spermicide  
• Vaginal sponge  
• Male condom without spermicide*  
• Progestin only pills by WOCBP subject or male subject’s WOCBP partner  
• Female condom * 
*A male and female condom must not be used together  
 
Subjects  should be informed tha t taking the study drug may involve unknown risks to the 
fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate in 
the study they must adhere  to the contraception requirement (described above) for the 
duration of  the study.  If there is any question that a subject  will not reliably comply with 
the requirements for contraception, that subject  should not be entered into the study.  
 
5.8.2 Use in Pregnancy  
 
The investigational agents used in this protocol  may have adve rse effects on a fetus; 
therefore, women with a positive pregnancy test at screening will not be eligible for 
enrollment.  If a subject  inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment, the subject  
will immediately be removed from the study.  The site wil l contact the subject  at least 
monthly and document the subject ’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or 
terminated.   
 
Pregnancy in female subjects throughout the study or within 5 months  of completing 
treatment  as well as any pregnancy in partn ers of male subjects throughout the study or 
within 7 months  of completing the study should be reported initially as a serious adverse 
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  30 event (see SAE reporting procedures in section 7.5.1  and 7.5.5 ) by the investigator within 
24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Pregnancy information must be reported on the 
Pregnancy Form . 
 
Protocol required procedures for study discontinuation and follow -up must be performed 
on the subject unless contraindicated b y pregnancy (e .g., x-ray studies). Other appropriate 
pregnancy follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated.  
 
Follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including any voluntary or 
spontaneous termination, perinatal and neonatal outcome and where applicable, offspring 
information must be reported on the Pregnancy Follow -up Form. Pregnancy outcomes 
must also be collected for the female partners of any males in this trial. Consent to report 
information regardi ng these pregnancy outcomes should be obtained from the female 
partner.  
 
5.8.3 Use in Nursing Women  
 
Since many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious 
adverse reactions in the nursing infant, subjects  who are breast -feeding are not eligible for 
enrollment.  
 
5.8.4 All Subjects (Male and Female)  
 
All sexually active patients must use at least a barrier method (i.e., condom) to prevent 
transmission of body fluids.  
 
5.9 Duration of Therapy  
 
Subjects on both arms will receive treatment every 3 weeks for 6 cycles of treatment within a 
course (18 weeks total). At the investigator’s discretion, subjects who are clinically stable and meet 
dosing  requirements  (per Section 6.2) at the end of the fir st course may receive additional courses 
of their assigned  treatment  for up to a maximum of 2 years . Subjects that begin a new course prior 
to the 2 year cut -off may complete that course prior to coming off study.  The additional course(s) 
may start as  early as 3 weeks  (+7 days) from last dose of previous course  and all assessments  will 
be followed per the study schedule in Section 10 , with the first dose of the  additional course 
corresponding to Day 1, Cycle 1 of the study schedule.  The following assess ments are not required 
during additional courses:  
 
• HLA -typing  
• Tumor biopsies  
 
5.10 Criteria for Removal from Treatment  
 
The reason for study removal and the date the subject  was removed will be documented in the 
CRF . A subject will be discontinued from the  trial for any of the following reasons:  
• The subject or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) withdraws 
consent  for participation in the study . 
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  31 A subject must be discontinued from treatment (but may continue to be monitored in the post-
treatment follow -up portion of the trial) for any of the following reasons:  
 
• The subject or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) withdraws 
consent for treatment  
•  Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatme nt 
•  Unacceptable toxicity  (see Section 5.7). Exceptions for treatment discontinuation 
are listed in Section 5.10.2 . If the study treatment has provided clinical benefit (as 
defined in Section 5.10.1 ), the IND sponsor may approve trial continuation for 
patients experiencing toxicities that are not life threatening or of major clinical 
concern (such as pruritis or transient hypotension).  
•  Disease progression as defined in Section 5.10.1 
•  Severe or life -threatening nivolumab  or ipilimumab -related AE(s)  (see Section 
5.10.2) 
•  Need for >2 dose delays due to the same drug-related toxicity as per the dose delay 
guidelines (see Section 6.2) 
•  If, in the opinion of the Investigator, a change or temporal or permanent 
discontinuation of therapy would be in the best interest of the subject , 
•  Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements,  
•  Subject is lost to follow -up 
•  Subject becomes pr egnant  
 
5.10.1 Disease Progression  
 
GVAX  Pancreas vaccine , CRS -207, nivolumab , and ipilimumab  are expected to trigger 
immune -mediated responses, which require activation of the immune system prior to the 
observation of clinical responses. Such immune activ ation may take weeks to months to be 
evident. Some subjects  may have objective volume increase of tumor lesions or other 
disease parameters within weeks following the start of immunotherapy . Such subjects  may 
not have had sufficient time to develop the required immune activation or, in some subjects , 
tumor volume or other disease parameter increases may represent infiltration of 
lymphocytes into the original tumor. In conventional studies, such tumor volum e or 
relevant laboratory parameter increases during the first 2 -4 months of the study would 
constitute disease progression  and lead to discontinuation of imaging to detect response, 
thus disregarding the potential for subsequent immune -mediated clinical re sponse. This 
phenomenon was observed in approximately 10% of subjects in the Phase 1 study of 
nivolumab and has also been reported for ipilimumab monotherapy16. 
 
Subjects will be permitted to continue with treatment beyond RECIST 1.1 defined PD as 
long as they meet the following criteria:  
• Investigator -assessed clinical benefit , and 
• Subject is tolerating study drug.  
 
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  32 The assessment of clinical benefit should take into account whether the subject is clinically 
deteriorating and unlikely to receive further benefit from continued treatment. The  
following criteria need to be taken into consideration:  
• No decline in ECOG performance status.  
• Absence of rapid progression of disease or of progressive tumor at critical anatomical 
sites (e.g., cord compression) requiring urgent alternative medical inter vention.  
 
All decisions to continue treatment beyond PD must be discussed with the Protocol Chair  
and documented in the study records.  
 
Tumor assessments will be made using RECIST 1.1 (Appendix C ) and irRC  (Appendix 
D).  
 
5.10.2 Nivolumab  and Ipilimumab -Related Adverse Events  
 
Permanent discontinuation of study treatment  should be considered for any of the 
following:  
1. Severe or life -threatening related AEs, including, but not limited to, any of the 
following ( the IND Sponsor , and BMS  must be notified in the event of these AEs):  
• Any grade 2 treatment -related uveitis, eye pain, or blurred vision that does not 
respond to topical therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 severity within 2 
weeks of starting therapy OR requires systemic treat ment  
 
• Any grade 3 non -skin, drug -related AE lasting > 7 days, with the following  
exceptions:  
 
▪ Grade 3 treatment -related uveitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm, diarrhea, 
colitis, neurologic  toxicity, hypersensitivity reaction, or infusion reaction  
(applies to nivolumab and ipilimumab only)  of any duration requires  
discontinuation  
▪ Grade 3 treatment -related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with 
only physiologic hormone replacement do not require discontinuation  
▪ Grade 3 treatment -related laboratory abnormali ties do not require treatment 
discontinuation  except:  
 
o Grade 3 treatment -related thrombocytopenia  > 7 days OR that is  
associated with bleeding requires  discontinuation  
 
o Any treatment -related liver function test (LFT) abnormality  that 
meets the following  criteria require discontinuation:  
− Total bilirubin > 3 × ULN  
− Concurrent AST or ALT > 3 × ULN and total bilirubin > 2 
× ULN  
 
• Any grade 4 treatment -related AE or laboratory abnormality, except for the 
following  events which do not require discontinuation:  
 
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  33 ▪ Grade 4 amylase or lipase abnormalities that are not associated with 
symptoms or clinical  manifestations, or radiographic signs of pancreatitis. 
It is recommended to consult with  the Protocol Chair  for grade 4 amylase 
or lipase abnormalities.  
 
▪ Isolated grade 4 electrolyte imbalances/abnormalities that are not associated 
with clinical  sequelae and are corrected with supplementation/appropriate 
management  within 72 hours of their onset . 
 
▪ Transient, self -correcting grade 4 AST or ALT that occur after the CRS -207 
infusion and resolve s within 2 weeks .  
 
▪ Grade 4 lymphopenia  and leu kopenia . 
 
▪ Grade 4 trea tment -related endocrinopathy adverse events, such as adrenal 
insufficiency, ACTH deficiency, hyper - or hypothyroidism, or glucose 
intolerance, which resolve or  are adequately controlled with physiologic 
hormone replacement (corticosteroids, thyroid hormones) or glucose -
controlling agents, respectively, may not require discontinuation after 
discussion with and approval from the Protocol Chair.  
 
• Any dosing interru ption lasting > 6 weeks with the following exceptions:  
 
▪ Dosing interruptions to allow for prolonged steroid tapers to manage drug -
related adverse  events are allowed. Prior to re -initiating treatment in a 
subject with a dosing interruption lasting > 6 weeks, the Protocol Chair  must 
be consulted. Tumor assessments  should continue as per protocol even if 
dosing is interrupted.  
 
▪ Dosing interruptions > 6  weeks that occur for non -drug-related reasons may 
be allowed if  approved by the Protocol Chair . Prior to re -initiating treatment 
in a subject with a  dosing interruption lasting > 6 weeks, the Protocol Chair  
must be consulted.  Tumor assessments should cont inue as per protocol even 
if dosing is interrupted.   
 
Any AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the  
Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the subject with continued nivolumab  or 
nivolumab/ ipilimumab  dosing.   
 
In order to standardize the management of AEs for all subjects, treatment management 
algorithms are included in Appendix B . Additional AE treatment management algorithms 
included in the nivolumab  and ipilimumab IB might be considered for individ ual cases.  
 
Subjects  that are required to stop treatment with nivolumab/ ipilimumab due to toxicity may 
stay on study and receive CY/GVAX Pancreas vaccine followed by CRS -207 ( assessment 
schedule per Section 10.2 ) once the nivolumab /ipilimumab -related toxicity(s) has resolved 
to a grade 1.

Confirmed Listeria Infection
 
 
In the event a subject has a positive Listeria culture at any time during or after study 
participation (except within 7 days after a CRS
-
207 infusion), the IND Sponsor should be 
notified within 24 hours of the adverse event of special interest (AESI) per 
S
ection 7.1.3
. 
 
 
If Listeria has been confirmed at the clinical site or an external laboratory, all efforts should 
be made to obtain a sample of the bacterial isolate from the original positive culture and 
submit to 
the IND Sponsor or designee
 
for strain co
nfirmation; records on all samples 
cultured during this period must be obtained and provided to the Sponsor. Refer to the 
Central Laboratory Manual for sample collection and shipping instructions.

207 or Listeria infection that has not been 
confirmed by culture, collection of blood
 
(peripheral and port for those with indwelling 
ports)
, urine and stool samples in duplicate is recommended. One set of samples shoul
d be 
cultured locally for Listeria per institutional guidelines. Culture of cerebrospinal fluid 
should be obtained for subjects with suspected central nervous system infection. In such 
instances, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid should also include cell cou
nt, protein, glucose, 
and Gram stain. If samples are positive for Listeria, the IND Sponsor must be notified 
immediately, and the duplicate samples and Listeria isolate must be sent to 
the IND 
Sponsor
 
or designee for testing to confirm CRS

Dosing Delays
 
 
D
osing of study therapy will be delayed for the following laboratory criteria: 
 
 
 

J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  36 • AST/ALT >3 × ULN   
• Total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN or direct bilirubin > 2.0 × ULN for subjects with 
Gilbert ’s disease  
• Creatinine > 1.5 × ULN  
• Hemoglobin < 7.5 g/dL  
• ANC < 1000/uL  
• Platelets < 80 × 103/uL 
 
All scheduled cycles within a course are to be given approximately 3 weeks apart. If necessary, a 
scheduled cycle may be delayed for up to 1 week. In this case,  subsequent cycles should continue 
so that a subject can still receive all 6 cycles given that the cycles are a minimum of 3 weeks apart 
and they have not experienced an AE necessitating discontinuation. If delayed more than 1 week, 
the Protocol Chair must  be contacted for further instructions on continued treatment. Additional 
delays or modifications to the treatment schedule must be approved by the Protocol Chair  or IND 
Sponsor.   
 
If a delay  occur s between D ay 1 and 2 in a cycle:  
• Nivolumab  and ipilimumab -related infusion reactions must resolve to baseline prior to 
administration of ipilimumab, GVAX , or CRS -207.  
• If a nivolumab -related infusion reaction prevents subsequent infusion of ipilimumab on the 
same day, the dose of ipilimumab should be replaced wi thin 72 hours. In such instances, at 
least 18 days must elapse between the replacement dose of ipilimumab and the 
administration of the next dose of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab.  If the dose of 
ipilimumab cannot be replaced within 72 hours, resume ip ilimumab at the next scheduled 
dose per Section 10 . 
• Resume D ay 2 treatment schedule  (GVAX or CRS -207) and assessments without repeating 
Day 1 study treatments (CY and/or nivolumab/ ipilimumab ) if the delay is within 72 hours . 
• If the delay is longer than  72 hours, repeat Day 1 and D ay 2  (if applicable)  study 
treatments/assessments with a minimum of 2 weeks  from the previous Day 1 treatment.   
This includes steroid treatment requiring at least a 14 day  washout prior to resuming study -
related treatments.  
 
Administration  of study drug  should be delayed for the following:  
 
• Dosing criteria are not met  
• Any grade ≥ 2 non -skin, treatment -related AE , with the following exceptions:  
o Grade 2 drug -related fatigue or laboratory abnormalities do not require a treatment 
delay 
o Grade 2 hypothyroidism or thyroiditis  
• Any grade >3 skin treatment -related AE   
• Any ≥ grade 3 treatment -related laboratory abnormality, with the following exceptions for  
asymptomatic amylase or lipase:  
o Grade 3 or 4 amylase or lipase abnormalities that are not associated with symptoms 
or clinical  manifestations, or radiographic signs of pancreatitis do not require a dose 
delay. It is  recommended to consult with the Protocol Chair  for grade 3 amylase or 
lipase  abnormalities.  
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  37 o Isolated g rade 3 or 4 electrol yte imbalances/abnormalities that are not associated 
with clinical sequelae and are corrected with supplementation/appropriate 
management  
• Any AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of  the 
investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study drug. 
 
In order to standardize the management of AEs for all subjects, treatment management algorithms 
are included in Appendix B . Additional AE treatment management algorithms included in the 
nivolumab  and ipilimumab IB might be considered for individual cases.  
 
Subjects may resume treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab when the treatment -related AE (s) 
resolve to  grade ≤1 or baseline value, with the following exceptions:  
 
• Subjects may resume treatment in the presence of grade 2 fatigue.  
• Subjects who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug -related skin AE may resume treatment 
in the presence of Grade 2 skin adverse event  
• Treatment -related  pulmonary toxicity , diarrhea, or colitis must have resolved to baseline 
before  treatment is resum ed. 
• Treatment -related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic hormone  
replacement may resume treatment , which  include grade 2  hyperglycemia,  hypothyroidism 
and thyroiditis . 
 
7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
This study will use the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised CTCAE version 4.03 
for AE reporting that can be found at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm .   
 
Information about all AEs, whether voluntee red by the subject, discovered by investigator 
questioning, or detected through physical examination, laboratory test or other means, will be 
collected, recorded, and followed as appropriate.  
 
7.1 Definitions  
 
7.1.1 Adverse Event  
 
An AE  is defined as any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition occurring after 
starting the study drug (or therapy) even if the event is not considered to be related to the 
study. An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pai n), signs 
(e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the abnormal results of an investigation (e.g. , 
laboratory findings, electrocardiogram). Medical conditions/diseases present before 
starting the study treatment are only considered AEs if they worsen after s tarting the study 
treatment (any procedures specified in the protocol). New medical conditions / diseases 
occurring before starting the study treatment but after signing the informed consent form 
will not be recorded  as AEs . Additionally, expected progress ion of the disease being 
studied will not be recorded as an adverse event .  
 
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  38 Laboratory abnormalities:  Laboratory abnormalities present at the screening visit will 
be recorded as pre -treatment signs and symptoms. After study treatment administration, all 
grade 3 and 4 clinical laboratory results that represent an increase in severity from baseline 
will be reported as AEs. A grade 1 or 2 clinical laboratory abnormality should be reported 
as an AE only if it is considered clinically significant by the invest igator ( induce clinical 
signs or symptoms or require therapy ). 
 
7.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
 
A SAE  is an undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition which:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization 
(see note below for exceptions) for >2 4 hours  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (note: reports of congenital  anomalies/birth 
defects must also be reported on the Pregnancy Form)  
• Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may 
require intervention [e .g., medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes listed in the definition above.) Examples of such events include, but are 
not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or c onvulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization.)  
• Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important medical 
event.  
• Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is also considered an important medical 
event.  
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) 
via the study drug is an SAE.  
• Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study)  
• Is associated with an overdose  
• Is a pregnancy  or pregnancy outcome of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, 
benign hyda tidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, 
miscarriage, or stillbirth.  
 
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospitalizations for:  
• Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure or to facilitate 
a procedure  
• Routine  health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health 
status (e .g., routine colonoscopy)  
• Medical/surgical admission for purpose other than remedying ill health state and 
was planned prior to entry into the study. Appropriate documentation  is required in 
these cases .  
• Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on 
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  39 health status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e .g., lack of housing, 
economic inadequacy, care -giver respite, family circumstances, administrative).  
• Admissions for monitoring of treatment -related infusion reactions that do not 
otherwise meet the criteria for a SAE.  
 
7.1.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest  (AESI)  
 
Suspected infection with CRS -207 and/or Listeria are considered adverse events of special 
interest (AESI) and should be reported following SAE reporting procedures in Section 7.5  
irrespective of temporal relationship to study drug administration.  
 
In the e vent a subject has a positive Listeria culture at any time during or after study 
participation , the event should be reported to the IND Sponsor within 24 hours of the event.  
 
All AESIs must be reported for the duration of the study regardless of causality.  
 
7.2 Assessment of Causality  
 
The relationship of an AE to the administration of the study drug is to be assessed by the 
investigator according to the following definitions:  
 
• No (unrelated, not related, no relation) :  The time course between the administ ration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event rules out a causal 
relationship and another cause (concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, etc.) is 
suspected.  
 
• Yes (related) : The time course between the administration of stu dy drug and the occurrence 
or worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal relationship and no other cause 
(concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, etc.) can be identified.  
 
The following factors should also be considered:  
• The temporal sequence from study drug administration - The event should occur after the 
study drug is given. The length of time from study drug exposure to event should be 
evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurre nt diseases - Each report should be evaluated in the 
context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease 
the subject may have.  
• Concomitant medication - The other medications the subject is taking or the treatment t he 
subject receives should be examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized 
to cause the event in question.  
• Known response pattern for this class of study drug - Clinical and/or preclinical data may 
indicate whether a particular response i s likely to be a class effect.  
• Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses - The exposure to stress might induce adverse 
changes in the recipient and provide a logical and better explanation for the event.  
• The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the stu dy drug - The known pharmacologic 
properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of the study drug should 
be considered.  
 
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  40 Assessment of Grade:  
 
The investigator will make an assessment of grade for each AE and SAE reported during the study, 
which will be recorded in the CRF. The assessment will be based on the National Cancer Institute’s 
CTCAE (Version 4.03) and graded as shown below:  
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolon gation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care 
activities of daily living  
• Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
• Grade 5: Death related to AE  
 
Any AE that changes in grade during its course will be recorde d in the CRF at the highest level 
experience by the subject.  
 
7.3 Expectedness  
 
Unexpected AE: An AE, which varies in nature, intensity or frequency from information on the 
investigational drug/agent provided in the  product  IB, package insert or safety rep orts. Any AE 
that is not included in the IB, package insert, safety reports or informed  consent is considered 
“unexpected”.  
 
Expected (known) AE: An AE, which has been reported in the IB, package insert or safety reports . 
An AE is considered “expected”, only if it is included in the IB document as a risk.  
 
7.4 Handling of Expedited Safety Reports  
 
In accordance with local regulations, the IND Sponsor  or designee  will notify investigators of all 
SAEs that are unexpected (i .e., not previously described in the IB), and related to CY, GVAX  
pancreas vaccine , CRS -207, nivolumab , or ipilimumab . This notification will be in the form of an 
expedited safety report (ESR) that is to be faxed to the investigators and the study coordinators. 
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the IB and 
where required by local regulations, the investigator will submit the ESR to the appropriate IRB. 
The investigator and IRB will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The investigator 
should also comply with the IRB procedures for report ing any other safety information.  
 
7.5 Reporting  
 
7.5.1  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
 
All AEs (both related and unrelated) will be captured on the appropriate study -specific 
CRFs. All AEs experienced by subjects will be collected and reported from the first dose 
of the investigational agent, throughout the st udy, and will be followed for 28 days after 
last dose of study drug unless related to the investigational agent.

Pregnancy Reporting
 
 
Although pregnancy and lactation 
are not always serious by regulatory definition
, it is the 
responsibility of investigators or their designees 
to report any pregnancy or lactation in a 
subject (spontaneously reported to them)
 
that occurs during the trial or within 
5 months
 
of completing the trial
 
as an SAE
. This
 
also 
includ
es
 
the pregnancy of a male subject's 
female partner who has provided writt
en consent to provide information regarding 
pregnancy, which
 
occurs during the trial or within 
7 months
 
of completing the trial.

If a subject or partner of a subject participating in the study becomes pregnant, the 
investigator must 
report the pregnancy
 
within 24 hours of discovery or knowledge of the 
event. To report a pregnancy, complete the 
S
AE form 
with the seriousness category
 
checked as 
‘
o

All subjects or partners of subjects who become pregnant must be followed to the 
completion/termination of the pregnancy.  If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the 
anticipated date, the investigator should notify 
the IND Sponsor and BMS
.  At th
e 
completion of the pregnancy, the investigator will document the outcome of the 
pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign 
hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and 
stillbirth mu
st also be reported as SAEs (Important Medical Events).  If the pregnancy 
continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported to

8. PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
8.1  Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan®, CY)  
 
8.1.1 Agent Accountability  
 
The IND S ponsor or the IND Sponsor’s representative shall take responsibility for and 
shall take all steps to maintain appropriate records and ensure appropriate supply, storage, 
handling, distribution and usage of investigati onal product in accordance with the protocol 
and any applicable laws and regulations.  
 
8.1.2 Mode of Action  
 
CY is a synthetic antineoplastic drug chemically related to the nitrogen mustards. CY is 
biotransformed principally in the liver to active alkylati ng metabolites by a mixed function 
microsomal oxidase system. These metabolites interfere with the growth of susceptible 
rapidly proliferating malignant cells. The mechanism of action is thought to involve cross -
linking of tumor cell DNA.  
 
8.1.3 Descriptio n 
 
CY ( CYTOXAN® ; cyclophosphamide for injection, USP) is a sterile , white powder 
containing cyclophosphamide monohydrate and is supplied in vials for single -dose use.  
 
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  45 8.1.4 Packaging and Labeling Information  
 
CY is commercially available.  
 
8.1.5 Preparation  
 
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and 
discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Add the 
diluent to the vial and shake it vigorously to dissolve. If the powder fail s to dissolve 
immediately and completely, it is advisable to allow the vial to stand for a few minutes. 
Use the quantity of diluent shown below to constitute the product:  
 
Dosage Strength  CYTOXAN Contains 
Cyclophosphamide Monohydrate  Quantity of Diluent  
 
500 mg  534.5 mg  25 mL  
1 g 1069.0 mg  50 mL  
2 g 2138.0 mg  100 mL  
 
CY may be prepared for parenteral use by infusion using any of the following methods:  
1. CY constituted with 0.9% sterile sodium chloride may be infused without further 
dilution.  
2. CY constituted with 0.9% sterile sodium chloride may be infused following further 
dilution in the following:  
 
• Dextrose Injection, USP (5% dextrose)  
• Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (5% dextrose and 0.9% sterile 
sodium chloride)  
• 5% Dextrose and Ringer’s Injection  
• Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP  
• Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (0.45% sterile sodium chloride)  
• Sodium Lactate Injection, USP (1/6 molar sodium lactate)  
 
8.1.6 Storage  
 
Store vials at or below 77° F (25° C).  
 
8.1.7 Stability  
 
CY (prepared for either direct injection or infusion) is chemically and physically stable for 
24 hours at room temperature or for 6 days in the refrigerator; it does not contain any 
antimicrobial preservative and thus care must be taken to assure the sterilit y of prepared 
solutions.

Care Implications
 
 
During treatment, the 
subject
’s hematologic profile (particularly neutrophils and platelets) 
should be monitored
 
regularly to determine the degree of hematopoietic suppression.
 
 
The rate of metabolism and the leukopenic activity of 
CY 
reportedly are increased by 
chronic administration of high doses of phenobarbital. The physician should be alert for 
possible combine
d drug actions, desirable or undesirable, involving 
CY 
even though 
CY 
has been used successfully concurrently with other drugs, including other cytotoxic drugs. 
CY 
treatment, which causes a marked and persistent inhibition of cholinesterase activity, 
poten
tiates the effect of succinylcholine chloride. If a 
subject
 
has been treated with 
CY 
within 10 days of general anesthesia, the anesthesiologist should be alerted.
 
 
CY 
may interfere with normal wound healing.

9. CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES  
 
Research samples will be collected at the discretion of th e PI based on availability of supplies and 
safety of patient and staff. Sample collection, processing, storage , and shipment instructions will 
be provided in the  Laboratory Manual . 
 
9.1 Tumor Tissue Studies  
 
Tumor biopsies will be collected  (if a subject ’s tumor is thought to be reasonably safe and easy to 
biopsy) at baseline and at Cycle 3 (4-6 cores per time  point) .  If a biopsy was done within 21 days 
before first dose, archived tissue from this biopsy may be used as baseline  sample .  Fine needle 
aspir ation will not be acceptable. Additional optional biopsies may be obtained later in the course 
of study treatment .  
 
Attempts will be made to obtain archived tissue samples from all subjects.  Archived FNA biopsy 
samples do not contain sufficient tissue an d will not be collected.   
 
Detailed instructions for tissue collection, processing , storage,  and shipment will be provided in 
the Laboratory  Manual . 
 
To exp lore the association of OS , PD -L1 positivity, and tumor -infiltrating lymphocyte 
characteristic s with clinical responses, archived tumor tissue and tumor tissue obtained at baseline 
and during treatment  (Cycle 3) will be compared . PD-L1 expression may predict  response to anti -
PD-118,19.  However, PD -L1 is also upregulated in response to IFN -γ released by infiltrating T cells 
and could potentially be a predictor of response to any active immunotherapy .  Pre - and post -
treatment tumor biopsies will also be analyzed for PD -1 expression as well  as infiltration of 
immune cells (effector T cells, Tregs, B cells, dendritic cells, etc).  Characterization of immune 
checkpoint expression as well as immune infiltrates may be predictive of response to therapy and 
may also give insight into next generati on combinatorial approaches.  Preliminary data from a 
pancreatic cancer immunotherapy study suggests  that induction of a T h1and T h17 phenotype at the 
tumor itself predicts response.   Furthermore, upregulation of other inhibitory molecules such as 
IL-10 and  TGF -β may identify other targets for combinatorial strategies .  Dependent on 
availability of paired tissue samples, additional analysis including determination of gene signatures 
of tumor and immune cells will be performed to look for patterns of response  associated with 
immune activation and changes in the tumor.  
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  57  
Attempts will be made to obtain archived tissue samples from all subjects .   
 
9.2 Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells  (PBMCs) 
 
Whole blood for isolation of PBMCs will be collected prior to dosing  on Day 1 of  Cycle s 1, 2, 4, 
and 6 only during Course 1 . Pre- and post-treatment changes in PBMCs including effector, helper, 
and regulatory T cells, NK cells, and macrophages through cell phenotyping analysis and gene 
expression profiling  will be measured . In addition, induction of Listeria  and mesothelin antigen -
specific T cell responses and changes to the T cell epitope repertoire will also be evaluated.  
The cellular immune responses directed against Lm and mesothelin will be evaluated by using 
enzyme -linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) and intracellular cytokine staining.  Post-
treatment  expression  of PD-1 and other lymphocyte activation markers  will be measured as well. 
These responses will be correlated with OS. PB MCs are isolated and stored fr ozen (liquid nitrogen) 
until use . Detailed instructions for collection, processing , storage , and shipment  are provided in 
the Laboratory Manual.  
 
9.3 Serum and Plasma Marker Studies  
 
Sera will be collected prior to dosing on Day 1 of  Cycles 1 -6 only during Course 1 . Additionally, 
subjects will have whole blood for serum drawn 20 -26 hours post -CRS -207 infusion during Cycles 
3-6 for patients in Arm A and during Cycle s 1-6 for patients in Arm B  only during Course 1 .  
Plasma will be collected pr ior to dosing on Day 1 of Cycle s 1, 2, 4, 6, and the EOT  evaluation  only 
during Course 1 . Humoral immune responses , including anti-Lm, anti -mesothelin, anti -
thyroglobulin and anti -galectin 3 antibodies will be evaluated by using enzyme -linked 
immunosorbent ass ay (ELISA) . In addition, potential therapeutic targets, biomarkers, and 
predictors of response and autoimmune toxicity will be evaluated . Sera and plasma are isolated 
and stored frozen ( -80oC) until use. Detailed instructions for collection, processing , storage , and 
shipping  are provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
 
9.4 Stool and Oral Wash Samples  Studies  
 
Stool and oral wash  specimens (and questionnaire) will be obtained when available. All stool 
specimens should be collected within 72 hours (and ideally within 24 hours) of the patient's 
appointment. Baseline specimens may be obtained at Cycle 1 Day 1 ± 30 days of Course 1. 
Additional samples will be colle cted at Course 1 Cycle 4 Day 1 (± 30 days), Course 1 Cycle 6 Day 
1 (± 30 days) and EOT (± 30 days) . Additional samples may be obtained if the patient has any 
drug-related toxicity or at other timepoints of interest at the discretion of the PI at any point during 
the trial.    
 
Microbial DNA will be isolated  from stool  and oral wash  samples and prepared for 16S V4 
sequencing to profile microbial species represented in the gut pre - and post -treatment.   In addition, 
microbial DNA will be subjected to whole geno me metagenomics profiling of microbial species 
via shotgun sequencing for detailed functional and pathway analysis to determine the change in 
the species and functions in response to treatment.   Further bioinformatics analyses will be 
performed with these sequencing data to identify candidate microbial biomarkers, and predictors 
of response.   Detailed instructions for stool and oral wash  collection, storage , and shipment  are 
provided in the Laboratory Manual.   
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  58  
9.5 Diagnostic Tissue Samples  
 
Tissue, fluid, or blood may be collected from standard of care procedures used to treat or diagnose 
immune -related toxicities.  
 
9.6 Genomic Analysis  
 
Genomic sequencing library construction, whole genome/exome sequencing, whole transcriptome 
sequencing, mi crobial sequencing, neoepitope prediction, mutation burden, and bioinformatic 
analysis will be performed either at an on -campus laboratory or at an off -campus sequencing 
service. All the samples will be de -identified before sending to any laboratory for se quencing.   The 
FASTQ files, BAM files and VCF files will be generated and analyzed.  
 
Genomic sequencing data will be stored and computations conducted using a JH IT managed 
subscription of Azure.  
 
Clinical analysis.   Several CLIA -certified laboratories now offer molecular profiling of 
cancer  specimens  in commercial and  noncommercial settings and provide these results to patients 
and their physicians (e.g. Foundation Medicine, PGDx,  Michigan Center for Translational 
Pathology, or JHU CLIA Laboratories). I t is possible, therefore, that some of our research analyses 
will be conducted in these CLIA -certified environments.  If tissue or cells are evaluated with next 
generation sequencing strategies to provide a molecular profile of individual cancer specimens in 
a CLIA -certified facility, these results will be made available to the patient and their 
physician.  Patient confidentiality will be maintained, and the patient’s identity will not be publicly 
linked to any study results.   Researchers may use the data s et generated in the CLIA assay setting 
to study genetic alterations across a large number of genes important in cancer. Germline mutations 
are only identified in punitive cancer genes. Researchers will use the data set for exploratory 
research to study can cer cell heterogeneity. Some of the sequencing data obtained from the NGS 
strategies will be uploaded to government sponsored databases, such as GEO and dbGAP.   The 
results of the research studies may be published but subjects will not be identified in any  
publication.  
 
If a germline alteration of clinical importance (as judged by the Investigator) to the subject and his 
or her family members is identified by a CLIA -certified test in the course o f this analysis, attempts 
will be made in writing to contact the subject and/or family members for genetic counseling 
referral.

In order to minimize the need for research -only in -person visits, telemedicine visits may be substituted for in person clinical trial visits or portions 
of clinical trial visits where determined to be appropriate and where determined by the investigator not to increase the part icipants ris ks. Prior to 
initiating telemedicine for study visits the study team will explain to the participant, what a telemedicine visit entails an d confirm that the study 
participant is in agreement and able to proceed with this method. Telemedicine acknowledgemen t will be obtained in accordance with the Guidance 
for Use of Telemedicine in Research. In the event telemedicine is not deemed feasible, the study visit will proceed as an in -person visit. Telemedicine 
visits will be conducted using HIPAA compliant method  approved by the Health System and within licensing restrictions.  
 
1:   If necessary, a scheduled cycle may be delayed for up to 1 week. Longer delays to  be approved by the IND Sponsor  or Protocol Chair.  
2:   Order of administration is CY, Nivolumab, and t hen Ipilimumab. Subjects should be observed for a minimum of 30 minutes between each infusion . 
3: Cancer history includes: primary site of cancer, gross location of primary tumor, secondary sites of cancer, histology, histo logic grade, date of initial 
diagnosis, date of metastatic diagnosis, prior cancer therapy regimens.  
4: Complete physical examination and assessment of ECOG PS will be completed at baseline; focused physical examinations and asse ssment of ECOG 
PS will be conducted thereafter.  Day 1 Physi cal examination and ECOG status may be done up to 1 day prior to dosing.  
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  61 5:   Blood pressure, pulse, and temperature are required as indicated. Weight and pulse oximetry will be obtained at baseline and prior to each cycle.  Height 
will be taken at or prior to screening only. Vitals should be collected prior to CY administration and  prior to and after GVAX pancreas vaccine 
administration. Nivolumab:  vitals will be collected prior to  and at the end of the infusion (-5/+ 15 minutes) . Ipilimumab:  vitals will be collected prior 
to and at the end of the infusion (-5/+ 15 minutes) . CRS -207: vital signs will be obtained prior to and then every 30 minutes (± 15 minutes) during 
infusion and every hour ( -5/+ 15 minutes) during post -infusion follow -up. Subjects will be observed for at least 4 hours after each CRS -207 infusion. 
Subjects who are not stable enough to be released at 4 hours after infusion should continue to be monitored until stable. Pre sence of f ever alone does 
not indicate subject is not clinically stable.  
6:  Clinical hematology: CBC with differential ANC, ALC, AEC, and platelet count; serum chemistry: sodium, potassium, chloride, b icarbonate, glucose, 
BUN, creatinine, ALT, AST, alkaline phospha tase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, amylase, total protein, albumin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. 
LDH at baseline only. Required labs on Day 2 only after CRS -207 dosing: Any unexpected Grade 3 or greater laboratory abnormalities should be 
repeat ed within 24 -72 hours.  Grade 3 or greater creatinine, AST, ALT, and bilirubin should be repeated within 24 -72 hours as well.  
7:   TSH (Total T3 and free T4 if TSH abnormal  and clinically indicated ). 
8:   Bilirubin, blood, glucose, ketones, leukocytes, nitr ite, pH, color, protein, RBC and WBC count, and specific gravity.  
9:  Virology screen: HIV antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody; additional virology may also be evaluate d. Subjects who are 
hepatitis C antibody positive and confirm ed negative viral load at screening will be allowed to enroll.  
10:  Coagulation panel: D -dimer, fibrinogen, international normalized ratio of prothrombin time, APTT  
11: Pregnancy tests will be administered to WOCBP: serum pregnancy test is required at screening; urine pregnancy tests are requi red before doses on Day 
1 of dosing weeks.  
12: Labs may be collected within a window of up to 3 days prior to dosing. Blood draws must not be collected from a central line for at least 4 days after 
infusion of CRS -207.  
13: ECG should be performed at baseline.  
14: Spiral CT of thorax, abdomen and pelvis (and other imaging studies as clinically indicated to evaluate suspe cted sites of metastatic disease). If a subject 
cannot have a CT scan (e.g., allergy to contrast dye), an MRI should be performed. 3-D CT scans and RECIST reads will not be used to determine 
eligibility at baseline. On study r adiologic evaluations and tumo r measurements (RECIST and irRC per Appendix C  and Appendix D ) will be 
performed every 10 weeks (± 1 week; starting from the date of first treatment) including the EOT evaluation (± 4 weeks). If the EOT visit occurs early, 
scans do not need to be repeated if one has been done within the past 6 weeks.  Weeks are in reference to calendar week and should not be adjusted due 
to dosing delays.  
15: Injection -site reactions will be evaluated on Day 4 after GVAX pancreas vaccinations  by phone or email.  
16: Up to 120 mL of whole blood for PB MC isolation may be drawn up to 72 hours prior to dosing and must be processed by sponsor -qualified operators 
within 6 hours of collection and stored in liquid nitrogen . Approximately 20 mL of whole blood for plasma collection wil l be drawn as indicated. 
Approximately 5.0 mL of blood for serum for immune monitoring will be drawn as indicated. Day 3 blood draws (after CRS -207 only) should be taken 
between 20 and 26 hours after start of dosing.  Collection of  whole blood for isolatio n of PBMCs, plasma, and serum will only be drawn during Course 
1. 
17: Stool and oral wash specimens (and questionnaire) will be obtained when available. All stool specimens should be collected within 72 hours (and 
ideally within 24 hours) of the patient's appointment. Baseline specimens may be obtained at Cycle 1 Day 1 ± 30 days of Course 1. Additional samples 
will be collected at Course 1 Cycle 4 Day 1 (± 30 days), Course 1 Cycle 6 Day 1 (± 30 days) , and EOT (± 30 days) . Additional samples may be obtained

J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  67 11.  STUDY ENDPOINTS  
 
11.1 Primary Endpoint  
 
The primary endpoint is ORR, which is defined as the proportion of subjects with PR or CR 
according to  RECIST 1.1.  Subjects who discontinue due to toxicity or clinical progression prior to 
post-baseline tumor assessments will be considered as non -responders.   Subjects who discontinue 
for other reasons prior to their first dose of study drug  will be replaced and not included in  the 
primary efficacy analysis . 
 
11.2 Secondary Endpoint  
 
The secondary endpoint is as follows:  
• Safety assessed by the following measures:  
– Number of pa tients who have grade 3 or higher  drug-related toxicities  
– Frequency of drug-related toxicity by grade   
– Injection -site reactions (after GVAX pancreas vaccine injections only)  
– Nivolumab -related infusion  reaction s 
– Ipilimumab -related infusion reactions  
– CRS -207-related infusion reaction s 
– Immune -related AEs  
– Unacceptable toxicities  
– Vital signs: BP, pulse, temperature  
– Physical examination  
– Changes in ECG readings  
– Clinical hematology: complete blood count (CBC) with differential ANC, 
ALC, AEC, and platelet count  
– Clinical serum chemistry: sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucos e, 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ALT, 
AST, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, bilirubin (total), total protein, albumin, 
calcium, magnesium and phosphate  
 
11.3 Exploratory Endpoints

related progression -free survival (irPFS), and time to progression (TTP).  
− Overall survival (OS) is defined as the number of months from the date of 
randomization  until death or end of follow -up (OS will be censored on the date 
the subject was last known to be alive for subjects without documentation of 
death at the time of analysis).  
− Progression -free survival (PFS) is defined as the number of months from the 
date of randomization to disease progression (PD or relapse from CR as 
assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death due to any cause. PFS will be 
censored at the date of the last scan for subjects without documentation of 
disease progression at the time of analysis.  
− Duration of Re sponse (DOR) is defined as the number of months from the first 
documentation of a response to date of disease progression.  
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  68 − Time to -progression (TTP) is defined as the number of months from the date of 
randomization to the date of documented disease progre ssion (PD or relapse 
from CR as assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria). It differs from PFS in that it 
does not include death in the definition of an event.  TTP will be censored at 
the date of the last scan for subjects without documentation of disease 
progr ession at the time of analysis.

12.2 Safety Meetings  
 
Scheduled meetings will take place weekly and will include the protocol principal investigator, 
study coordinator(s), data manager(s), sub-investigators (as appropriate), collaborators (as 
appropriate), and biostatisticians (as appropriate) involved with the conduct of the protocol. During 
these meetings matters related to the following will be discussed: safety of protocol participants, 
validity and integrity of the data, enrollment rate relative to expectation, characteristics of 
participants, retention of participants, adherence to protocol (potential or real protocol violations), 
data completeness, and progress of data for objectives.  
 
Monthly teleconferences will be scheduled to include the Coordinating Center and the clinical trial 
sites. During these meetings, the Coordinating Center and clinical trial sites  shall discuss  the 
following: study protocol  updates , safety data, enrollment  status, and progress of data for 
objectives.  
 
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  70 12.3 Monitoring  
 
The SKCCC Compliance Monitoring Program will provide external monitoring for JHU -affiliated 
sites in accordance with SKCCC DSMP (Version 6.0, 02/21/2019). The SMC Subcommittee will 
determine the level of patient safety risk and level/frequency of monitoring . Eligibility for all sites 
will be monitored by the Protocol Chair. Data monitoring of this protocol will occur on a regular 
basis with the frequency dependent on the rate of subject accrua l and the progress of the study.  
Additional data and safety monitoring oversight will also be performed by the SKCCC Safety 
Monitoring Committee (SMC - as defined in the DSMP) and a Medical Expert Committee (MEC) 
as detailed below. The protocol will be mo nitored internally by the IND Sponsor and the Principal 
Investigator at each site. External monitoring will occur according to the following guidelines:  
 
Johns Hopkins SKCCC : The protocol will be monitored externally by the SKCCC CRO in 
accordance with SKC CC guidelines. Trial monitoring and reporting will be done through the 
Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) at SKCCC.  
 
Participating site(s):  The protocol will be monitored by the internal CRO at each site. A report of 
the reviews will be submitted to the Protocol Chair, IND Sponsor,  and the SKCCC CRO.  
 
Authorized representatives of the Coordinating Center may visit the satellite sites to perform audits 
or inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of these audits or inspections is to 
system atically and independently examine all trial -related activities and documents to determine 
whether these activities were conducted and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported 
according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and any ap plicable regulatory 
requirements.  
 
The Medical Expert Committee (MEC) for this clinical study contains three medical oncologists 
from other disciplines who are not affiliated with this clinical trial protocol. The MEC will review 
safety data on at least a semi -annual basis. The MEC will provide a written summary of each 
assessment to the IND Sponsor -Investigator after each meeting. In turn, the study team will 
forward these summaries to the JHU and IRB, and JHU SKCCC SMC. The operating plan of the 
MEC will be as follows:  
 
• Meetings will be held at least semi -annually, and potentially more frequently if needed.  
• Meetings will be conducted in -person or via video/teleconference, with a participant sign -
in sheet collected at each meeting.  
• Approximately one week prior to each MEC meeting, the study team will submit the 
following items to MEC personnel for review and discussion at the meeting (The PI may 
join the MEC meeting in order to answer any questions the MEC might have):  
o A summary of the clinical trial’s progress to date;  
o The latest IRB -approved consent document;  
o A summary of all adverse events, serious adverse events, deaths, and withdrawals 
to date;  
 
Note that the MEC reserves the right to halt trial accrual or all study activity i f, after review, serious 
safety concerns warrant this action. If the MEC halts study accrual or all study activity, then the 
study team must notify the JHU SKCCC SMC, JHU IRB, and the FDA immediately.    
 
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  71 12.4 Study Documentation  
 
12.4.1 Informed Consent an d Authorization for use and Disclosure of Protected 
Health Information  
 
Written informed consent and authorization of use and disclosure of protected health 
information (PHI) must be obtained from each subject (or the subject’s legally authorized 
represent ative) before performing any study -specific screening/baseline period 
evaluations. The ICF and authorization for use and disclosure of PHI, which is prepared by 
the investigator or the site, must be reviewed and approved by the IND Sponsor, the study 
monit or (if applicable) , and the site’s IRB before the initiation of the study.  
 
12.4.2 Investigator Study Files  
 
Documentation about the investigator and study staff, the IRB and the institution, is 
required before study site initiation. A list of required documents will be provided by the 
IND S ponsor or designee to each participating investigator. Copies of these do cuments as 
well as supplemental information, such as the investigator’s obligations, IB, clinical study 
protocol and amendments, safety information, investigational agent information, biological 
samples and laboratory procedures, SRM, study logs and IND S ponsor/investigator/study 
monitor correspondence will be kept on -site in study site -specific binders.  
 
The IND Sponsor or designee will be responsible for maintaining original and backup of 
all CRF data. The investigator is responsible for maintaining backu p of all electronic  data 
systems used for primary documentation or source documentation. Backup of electronic 
data will be performed periodically as described in the site -specific SOPs. Backup records 
must be stored at a secure location on site and backup and recovery logs must be maintained 
to facilitate data recovery. If an electronic medical records system that is not supported by 
the IND S ponsor or designee (or is discontinued or decommissioned) is used, the 
investigator must maintain a system to retrie ve these records or arrange for the transfer of 
these records to an alternate electronic format or to paper.  
 
Changes to any electronic records require an audit trail, in accordance with 21 CFR 
11.10(e), and should include who made the changes and when and  why the changes were 
made. An audit trail is defined as a secure, computer -generated, time -stamped electronic 
record that will allow reconstruction of the course of events relating to the creation, 
modification and deletion of an electronic record. Audit trails must be created 
incrementally, in chronological order and in a manner that does not allow new audit trail 
information to overwrite existing data. Audit trails should be in a readable format and 
readily available at the study site and any other locat ion where electronic study records are 
maintained.  
 
Audit trails are generated automatically for eCRFs . The investigator is responsible for 
maintaining audit trails of all electronic data systems used for primary documentation or 
source documentation.  
 
12.4.3 Case Report Forms and Source Documentation  
 
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  72 The investigator must make study data accessible to the site monitor, to other authorized 
representatives of the IND Sponsor (or designee) and to the appropriate regulatory 
authority inspectors. The original CRF for each subject will be checked against source 
documents at the study site by the site monitor.  
 
12.4.4 Retention of Study Documents  
 
According to ICH E6, Section 4.9, all CRFs, as well as supporting paper and electronic 
documentation and administrati ve records, must be retained for at least 2 years after the 
last approval of a marketing application and until there are no pending or contemplated 
marketing applications, or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of 
clinical develo pment of an individual product. Longer retention periods may apply. The 
IND S ponsor will notify investigators as to when documents no longer need to be retained. 
No study documents will be destroyed or moved to a new location without prior written 
approval  from the IND Sponsor . If the investigator relocates, retires or withdraws from the 
clinical study for any reason, all records required to be maintained for the study should be 
transferred to an agreed -upon designee, such as another investigator at the ins titution where 
the study was conducted.  
 
Audit trails for electronic documents must be retained for a period at least as long as that 
required for the subject electronic records to which they pertain. The investigator must 
retain either the original or a c ertified copy of audit trails.  
 
12.4.5 Data Confidentiality and Subject Anonymity  
 
All information about the nature of the proposed investigation provided by the IND 
Sponsor or their representative to the investigator (with the exception of information 
required by law or regulations to be disclosed to the IRB, the subject or the appropriate 
regulatory authority) must be kept in confidence by the investigator.  
 
The anonymity of participating subjects must be maintained. Subjects will be identified by 
their initials and an assigned subject number on CRFs and other documents retrieved from 
the site or sent to the IND Sponsor, BMS, regulatory agencies, or central 
laboratories/reviewers. Documents that identify the subject (e.g., the signed ICF) must be 
mainta ined in strict confidence by the investigator, except to the extent necessary to allow 
auditing by the appropriate regulatory authority, the study monitor, IND Sponsor or their 
representative.  
 
13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
Sample size .   
 
The primary endpoint is ORR, defined as the proportion of subjects with PR or CR according 
to RECIST 1.1.   Subjects who discontinue due to toxicity or clinical progression prior to post -
baseline tumor assessments will be considered as non -responders.   Subjects who discontinue for 
other reasons prior to their first dose of study drug will be replaced  and not included in the primary 
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  73 analysis . 
 
With a total of 30 evaluable subjects  in each arm , the treatment will be considered successful if 5 
or more subjects respond  in a single arm .  If the number of responses is 4 or less, the preliminary 
anti-tumor activity of the treatment will be rejected.  
 
The study is powered to assess each arm separately. The sample size is based on an A’Hern single -
stage  phase 2 design20.  A sample size of 3 0 evaluable subjects per arm  are required to decide 
whether the proportion responding is less than or equal to 0. 06 or greater than or equal to 0. 2221.  
If the number of responses is 5 or more, the hypothesis that P <= 0. 06 is rejected with a target error 
rate of 0.05 (alpha).  If the number of responses is 4 or less, the hypothesis that P >= 0. 22 is rejected 
with a target error rate of 0.20 (power = 0.80).  Each arm will be evaluated independently.  
 
The benchmark for the es timate of ORR is based on a recent study of metastatic pancreatic cancer 
patients who had failed one prior gemcitabine -based regimen where patients who received 
nanoliposomal irinotecan plus fluorouracil and folinic acid had a response rate of 16% (19/177) .  
Response rates for patients receiving either nanoliposomal irinotecan monotherapy or fluorouracil 
and folinic acid were between 1 -6%.  
 
Statistical Analyses    
 
Data will be summarized descriptively by treatment arm and overall.  The descriptive summary 
including demographics and baseline variables will include counts and percentages for categorical 
variables and means, medians, standard deviations and minimum and maximum values for 
continuous variables.  
 
Time -to-event outcomes such as OS will be analyze d using Kaplan -Meier estimates (to obtain 
medians with 95% CI as well as plotting survival curves), log -rank tests, and Cox proportional 
hazards models. Comparisons between the two treatment arms will be exploratory in nature due to 
the small sample size. Where applicable, comparisons between groups will be made using a Chi -
square test or logistic regression for binary variables and t -tests or analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) or linear regression models for continuous variables.  Non -parametric alternatives 
(e.g. Fisher’s exact test or Kruskal -Wallis tests) will be considered as needed as will 
transformations of the outcome variables (e.g. log).   
 
For correlative studies, plots will be used to show the changes in immune response over time both 
for each indiv idual and for each treatment group. For each treatment, comparisons in the pre and 
post-treatment responses will be compared using paired t -tests (or Wilcoxon signed rank tests if 
appropriate) for continuous variables and McNemar’s tests for dichotomous or  categorical 
variables. Associations between immune parameters will be explored graphically (e.g. scatterplots, 
boxplots) and numerically (e.g., correlations, Fisher’s exact tests). Regression techniques will be 
used to explore the differences between the treatment arms for cross -sectional data (e.g., linear and 
logistic regression) and longitudinally with appropriate correction for correlation between repeated 
measurements (e.g., GEE and linear mixed effects models).  
 
All statements of statistical signific ance will be based on a 2 -tailed test with an overall 0.05 level 
of significance, unless stated otherwise.  All confidence intervals will be 95%, unless stated 
otherwise.  Sensitivity analyses will include models adjusting for baseline covariables.  These 
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  74 covariates will be selected based upon both clinical significance and potential imbalances between 
the treatment arms . 
 
Timing of Analysis  
 
The primary analysis will be conducted when all treated subjects have documented response or 
progression by RECIST 1.1, or have discontinued the study.  
 
13.2 Analysis Sets  
 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of 
study treatment. FAS analyses will be conducted on the basis of the randomized treatment. Since 
the focus of this study is on establishing the efficacy of the treatment combinations, all efficacy 
outcomes will be assessed using the FAS as the primary population for analysis.  
 
The Intent to Treat (ITT) analysis set includes all randomized subjects, regard less of the amount 
or type of treatment received. It is distinguished from the FAS in that individuals who do not 
receive any doses of study treatment will be included and therefore focuses upon the effectiveness 
of the treatment combinations.  ITT analyse s will be conducted on the basis of the randomized 
treatment. This population will be used for sensitivity analyses of OS and other selected efficacy 
endpoints.  
 
The safety population includes all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study  
treatment. The safety population will be conducted on the basis of the actual treatment received. 
All safety outcomes will be assessed using the safety population for analysis.  
 
A Per -Protocol (PP) subset may also be used to analyze select efficacy endpoi nts and will be based 
on study treatment exposure (compliance and/or time on study treatment) and major protocol 
deviations. The criteria for inclusion in the PP subset will be finalized and documented prior to 
database lock.  
 
13.3 Safety Analysis  
 
The saf ety analysis will be performed in all treated subjects. AE data will be listed individually 
and incidence of AEs summarized by system organ class and preferred terms within a system organ 
class for each treatment group.  When calculating the incidence of A Es, each AE (based on 
preferred terminology defined by CTCAE version 4.03 ) will be counted only once for a given 
subject.  In analyses of grade and causality, if the same AE occurs on multiple occasions, the 
highest grade and strongest relationship to stud y drug will be assumed.  If 2 or more AEs are 
reported as a unit, the individual terms will be reported as separate experiences.  Vaccine -site 
reactions will be listed and tabulated separately from the AEs.  
 
Changes in vital signs, hematology and clinical chemistry parameters from baseline to the end of 
the study will be examined.  Toxicity will be tabulated by type and grade. Toxicities will be 
characterized according to the CTCAE  version 4.03.  Treatment -emergent changes from normal 
to abnormal values in key laboratory parameters will be identified.

J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  78 APPENDIX B : Management Algorithms  
 
These general guidelines constitute guidance to the Investigator and may be supplemented by 
discussions with the Protocol Chair  representing the IND Sponsor. The guidance applies to all 
immuno -oncology (I -O) agents and regimens.  
 
A general principle is tha t differential diagnoses should be diligently evaluated according to 
standard medical practice. Non -inflammatory etiologies should be considered and appropriately 
treated.  
 
Corticosteroids are a primary therapy for immuno -oncology drug -related adverse even ts. The oral 
equivalent of the recommended IV doses may be considered for ambulatory subjects  with low -
grade toxicity. The lower bioavailability of oral corticosteroids should be taken into account when 
switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticostero ids. 
 
Consultation with a medical or surgical specialist, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure, is recommended . 
 
The frequency and severity of the related adverse events covered by these algorithms will depend 
on the immuno -oncology agent or regimen being used.

J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  87 APPENDIX C: Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 Criteria for 
Evaluating Response in Solid Tumors  
 
RECIST version 1.1  will be used in this study for assessment of tumor response.  While either CT 
or MRI may be used utilized, as per RECIST 1.1, CT is the preferred imaging technique in this 
study.   
Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease :  Measurable lesions are defined as  those that can be accurately measured in 
at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm by chest x -ray, as >10 mm 
with CT scan, or >10 mm with calipers by clinical exam.  All tumor measurements must be 
recorded in millimeters  (or decim al fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be 
considered measurable unless there is evidence of progression in the irradiated site. Malignant 
lymph nodes.   To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must 
be >15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to 
be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measu red 
and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease :  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered 
non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomen ingeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not 
followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non -measurable.  
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiog raphically defined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by 
definition, simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesi ons, 
if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions 
are present in the same subject , these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
Target lesions:   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and 
measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that 
lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the 
largest lesion does not lend it self to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next 
largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters 
(longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calcu lated 
and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then 
only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to 
further characterize any objective tumor regression in  the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions :  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over 
J1790 /  Version  7.0/ December 10, 2020  88 and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline.   Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, 
or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up.  
 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions.   Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest 
on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progressions).  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
 
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -patholog ical in size (<10 mm short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a subject  
to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression  
of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  should not normally trump target lesion 
status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of the treating 
physician  should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at 
a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator).  
 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started).  The subject 's best r esponse assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

** Only for non -randomized trials with response as primary endpoint.  
*** In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non -target 
lesions may be accepted as disease progression.  
 
Note : Subjects  with a global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease 
progression at that time should be reported as “ symptomatic 
deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to document the 
objective pr ogression even after discontinuation of treatment.

Defining immune -related Response Criteria by RECIST 1.1 criteria at 20 weeks (irDCR at 20 
weeks):  
 
1. Any patient with stable disease or progressive disease at any time in the trial with "rapid 
clinical deterioration" felt to be related to disease progression is irPD  
 
2. Any patient who meets the criteria for RECIST 1.1 CR at  20 weeks is irCR  
 
3. Any patient who meets the criteria for RECIST 1.1 PR at 20 weeks is irPR  
 
4. Any patient who meets the criteria for RECIST 1.1 SD at 20 weeks is irSD  
 
5. A patient with RECIST 1.1 PD but no rapid clinical deterioration may stay on study if 
his/her next tumor measurement evaluation is stable disease or better.  
 
6. If patient has first time PD by RECIST 1.1 criteria, call it unconfirmed PD for irRC 
RECIST 1.1.  
 
7. A patient with unconfirmed irPD at 20 weeks whose next tumor measurement is SD or 
better will be considered to be included in the irDCR at 6 months.  
 
8. A patient with unconfirmed irPD at 20 weeks who fails to qualify for RECIST 1.1 SD or 
unconfirmed CR or PR by next tumor measurement will be considered to have RECIST 
1.1 PD and irPD at 20 weeks.

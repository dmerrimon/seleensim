Title: Novel Hormonal Therap y (NHT) for Treating Patients with Metastatic Castr ation-
Sensitive Prostate Cancer (mCSPC): An Analy sis of National Veterans Affairs Health Care 
Network Data
Version: 1.0
Date of Protocol: 06 November 2023
Author: 
Rationale and Background: Prostate cancer is t hemost common cancer and the second 
leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States. While the long -term outlook 
is positive for earl y-stage prostate cancer, survival rates drastically  decrease once the disease 
has spread beyond the prostate gland. Metastatic castration- sensitive prostate cancer 
(mCSPC) is form of metastatic prostate cancer among men who have never received or are 
sensitive to androgen deprivation therap y (ADT). Conventional therap y for mCSPC has been 
ADT, however, mCSPC treat edwith ADT might eventuall y transition to castration -resistant 
prostate cancer (CRPC) stage with a median survival of approximately  3 years. Upfront 
intensified tre atment with NHTs, including abiraterone acetate ( ABI), apalutamide ( APA ), 
and enzalutamide (E NZ), added to a backbone of ADT, has substantially  improved survival
in clinical trials. Due to relatively  recent approval of NHTs in mCSPC there is limited 
information on real -world duration of treatment and time to next treatment wi th these 
therapies . The current study  proposes to use the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) 
database to 
describe outcomes of patients with NHT use in mCSPC.
Objectives: The study objectives include:
Primary objective : Describe duration of therap y (DOT) among patients with 
mCSPC who initiated NHT inthefirst line ( 1L)
Secondary objective :Describe time to next therapy (TTNT) among patients with 
mCSPC who initiated NHT in 1L
Exploratory objectives :
1.Describe patient baseline characteristics overall

Study Design: This is a retrospective, observational study  using the VHA data. Patients with 
mCSPC who initiated NHT in 1L during January  2020 –December 2022 will be selected 
based on diagnosis 
history , treatment history , PSA measurements, age, and continuous 
enrollment.
. Patients w ill be required to have 
365 day s of continuous enrollment in the National Vetera ns’ Affairs ( VA)Health Care 
Network prior to their index date, during which baseline characteristics will be assessed. The 
follow -up period will be defined as the t ime from th e index date to the end of continuous 
enrollment, theend of the data availabili ty, or death, whichever comes first. During the 
follow -
up period, the outcome measures (ie, DOT, TTNT, time to deep PSA response , time 
toundetectable PSA , time to progression, and the distribution of next treatment) will be 
assessed. 
Population: The popu
lation for the primary  and secondary  objectives will consist of patients 
with mCSPC who initiated NHT in 1L and who meet all the sample selection criteria.  
 
Varia bles: Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics will include age, race,
geographic regions, index y ear, treatment history ,diagnosis history , prognostic variables, 
Charlson 
Comorbidity  Index score , and individual comorbidities. O utcomes will includ e
DOT, TTNT, time to deep PSA response , time to undetectable PSA , and 
time to progression.
Data Sources: VHA Medical Statistical An alysis Sy stem datasets.  
Study Si ze:All eligible patients available for the analysis will be included.
Data Analysis :In the primary  and secondary  analy ses, DOT and TTNT will be described in 
the overall sample of patients with mCSPC who initiated 1L  NHT using Kaplan -Meier (KM) 
analysis.The number at risk table and the median time to event and its 95% confidence 
interval will be reported. In the exploratory  anal yses, patient baseline characteristics will be 
described in the overall sample . Means, standard deviations, me dians, 
and interquartile range will be e ous variables; counts and perce ntages 
will be estimated for categorical variables.  
 
 KM anal ysis will be conducted to describe time to deep PSA response, time to

357.RATIONALE AND BACKGR OUND
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death 
among men in the United States. The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2022 there 
will be 268,490 new cases of prostate cancer (PC) and 34,500 deaths due to PC.8While the 
long-term outlook is positive for early -stage prostate cancer, survival rates drasticall y 
decrease once the disease has spread bey ondthe prostate gland.9
Metastatic castration -
sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) is form of metastatic prostate cancer 
among men who have never received or are sensitive to ADT .5Conventional therap y for 
mCSPC has been ADT, however, mCSPC treated with ADT might eventually  transition to
CRPC stage with a median survival of approximately 3 years.11
Several NHTs have been approved for treatment in mCSPC together with A DT. ABI and 
ENZ were initially  approved by  the United State s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 
metastatic CRPC patients with prior chemotherap y in April 2011 and August 2012, 
respectivel y, and for chemotherap y-naïve patients in December 2012 and September 2014, 
respectivel y. ABI was later approved in February  2018, followed by  ENZ in December 2019, 
for the treatment of mCSPC.1,2One of the most recent NHTs, apalutamide (APA) was 
approved b y the FDA in September 2019 for patients with mCSPC.3
Upfront intensified treatment with NHTs in mCSPC , including ABI, APA, and ENZ ,added 
toabackbone of ADT, has substantially  improved survival.4,6,10With the rapidly  expanding 
treatment landscape, there have been limited studies describing clinical o utcomes with NHTs
in mCSPC . 
The current study  proposes to use the 
VHA database to describe outcomes of patients with 
NHT use in in mCSPC. 
8.RESEARCH QUESTION AND OBJECTIVES
The main research question is to identif y men with mCSPC from the VHA database who 
were treated with NHT, including ABI, APA, and ENZ, in the 1Lsetting and describe 
clinical outcomes of interest.  
 
More specificall y, the study objectives include:
Primary objective: Describe DOT among patients with mCSPC who i nitiated NHT 
in 1L
Secondary objective: Describe TTNT among patients with mCSPC who initiated 
NHT in 1L

5. Describe time to progression overall and  
6.Describ e the distribution of next therapy regimens overall  
9. RESEARCH METHODS 
9.1.Study Design
This is a retrospective, obser vational study  using the VHA data. Patients with mCSPC who 
initiated NHT in 1L during January  2020 – December 2022 will be selected based on 
diagnosis history , treatment history , PSA measurements, age, and continuous enrollment.  
 
.Patients will be r equired to have one y ear of continuous 
enrollment in the National VA Health Care Network 
prior to their index date, during which 
patient baseline characteristics will be assess ed. The time period (January  2020 –December 
2022) to 
identify  NHT initiation reflects the recency  of NHT approvals, and the baseline 
period allows us to capture an y potential comorbidities and characteristics tha t may be 
confounders to the outcomes. The follow -up period will be defined as the time from the 
index date to the end of continuous enrollment, the end of the data availability , or death, 
whichever comes first. During the follow -up period, the outcome meas ures (ie, DOT, TTNT, 
time to deep PSA respo
nse,time to undetectable PSA, time to progression, and the 
distribution of next treatment )will be assessed. The follow -up period is chosen to maximally  
capture an
y potential outcomes among patients with mCSPC who initiated NHT in 1L . 
9.2.
Setting
The study  population will include patients with mCSPC who initiat ed NHT in 1L  in the VHA 
database . Inclusion and exclusion criteria are specified below.

359.2.1. Inclusion Criteria
Patients must meet all of the following inclusion cr iteria to be eligible for inclusion in the 
study :
Males .
Haveat least one claim with a diagnosis code of PC(PC; ICD-10- CM code C61) .
Have documented secondary  metastasis codes on or after the initial PCdiagnosis 
(ICD-10 codes C77, C78, C79, C7B) .
Have initiated ABI, APA, orENZ ( 1) during the index window of January  2020 –
December 2022, and (2) within 90 day s prior to or any  time after the first claim for

index date .
Index window of Janua ry 2020 – December 2022 is selected ,as during this period 
all NHTs were approved for mCSPC, which will help remove earl y initiator bias 
(eg, when a product/class of products became available, patients with severe 
diseases tend to try  first). Table 1lists the approval dates for when each NHT was 
approved for treating mCSPC .

359.4.Data Sources
Data from the National VA Health Care Network will be used for this study . This network is 
the U.S.’s largest integrated health care s ystem with over 1,700 sites of care, serving 
approximately  8.76 million veterans each year. The VA Health Sy stem Corporate Data 
Warehous e (CDW) includes all medical encounter information in the VA, comprised of 
medical centers, community -based outpatient clin ics, community -living centers, veteran 
centers, and domiciliaries. The VA CDW stores data in separate dat abases, onefor each t ype 
ofclinical information -inpatient medication, inpatient laboratory, inpatient admission, 
outpatient medication, outpatient laboratory , outpatient visits, etc. The databases provide 
demographic information and contain comprehensive services, including prima ry care, 
specialty  care, inpatient care, rehabilitation, long -term care, home care, and other services, to 
military  veterans. The database also includes date of death. The date of death is extracted 
from the VA electronic health record s ystems and verified by official sources, including VA 
facilities, death certificates, and National Cemetery Administration. Information on CDW , 
including date of death, is updated on a dail y base. Cause of death is not available on CDW.
9.5.Study Size
As no priori hy potheses are specified, sample size calculations are not applicable. The 
number of patients eligible for the stud y will be determined i n accordance with the sample 
selection conducted per the criteria described in Section 9.2.

359.8.Quality Control
Best practice guidelines will be followed to ensure project qualit y, including structured 
organization of project materials (eg, data extracts, statistical software programs, output 
tables) and st andard internal audit process. The audit process both confirms the validity  of 
the anal ytical approach and ensur es that all programs and results are accurate.
9.9.Limitations of the R esearch M ethods
The anal yses conducted as part of this study  are subject to t he following limitations, which 
will be addressed in an y write -up of the stud y:
As this study  will be conducted among veterans, its findings may  not be generalizable 
to other populations.
Also, as we are pulling VA only  data, we are not able to capture ca
re that occurs 
outside the VA which could lead to missing data and misclassification of disease 
states and treat ment groups.
There are no specific diagnosis codes for CSPC. Assumptions will be made to selec t 
patients with CSPC based on clinical input.
Certain assumptions will be made in order to depict treatment patterns for 
determining TTNT. However, the definition of treatment patterns will nevertheless be 
subject to assumptions that may  not match up to the prescribing phy sicians’ intent .
Data are subject to inaccuracies in coding of diagnoses. The presence of a diagnosis 
code in the data does not necessarily  mean the presence of disease. The disease may  
be incorrectl y coded or the code was included as a ru le-out criterion. 
The presence of a prescription does not necessarily mean the medication was used as 
prescribed. In addition, prescriptions filled over the coun ter or provided as samples by  
the phy sician are not included in the data .
Regression models cannot account for unmeasured factors .

10.1. Patient I nformation 
This study  involves data that exist in deidentified /anonymized structured format and contain 
no patient personal information. 
10.2. Patient Consent
As this study  involves deidentified /anony mized structured data, which according to 
applicable legal requirements do not contain data subject to privacy  laws, obtaining informed 
consent from patients b y Pfizer is not required.
10.3. Institutional R eview Board (IRB) / Ethics C ommittee (EC)
This protocol, and an y subsequent modifications, will be reviewed and approved b y the 
SLVHCS I RB prior to implementation. 
10.4. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, as well as 
with scientific purpose, value,and rigor and follow generally  accepted research practices 
described in Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology  Practices (GPP). Public Policy  
Committee, I nternational Society  of Pharmacoepidemiology . Pharmacoepidemiology  and 
Drug Safet y 2015; 25:2 -10. https://onlinelibrary .wiley .com/doi/full/10.1002/pds.3891.
11.MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS/ADVERSE 
REACTIONS 
This study  involves data that exist as structured data by  the time of study  start. In these data 
sources, individual patient data a re not retrieved or validated, and it is not possible to link 
(ie, identify  a potential association between) a particular product and medical event for an y 
individual. Thus, the minimum criteria for reporting an adverse event (AE) (ie, identifiable 
patient, identifiable reporter, a suspect product, and event) cannot be met.
12.PLANS FOR DISSEMINATING AND COMMUNICATING STUDY RESULTS
Base d on the anal ysis results and discussions with Pfizer, a study  report summarizing the 
background, objectives, methods, results , and conclusion of the study  will be prepared. The 
study  report may  be disseminated within Pfizer but is not expected to be exter nally 
communicated. 
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (eg, clinical hold) by an applicable 
competent authorit y in any area of the world, or if the party responsible for collecting data 
from the participant is aware of an y new informat ion which might influence the evaluation of 
the benefits and risks of a Pfizer product , Pfizer should be informed immediately .

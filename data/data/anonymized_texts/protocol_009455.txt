Visceral Sensitivity Index (VSI ) is a widely used a unidimensional 15 -item scale that measures 
gastrointestinal symptom -specific anxiety (GSA). Preliminary and follow -up studies have found high 
internal consistency for the VSI, reporting a Cronbachs of about 0.93 and a mean inter -item c orrelation of 
0.47 (26, 27). Criterion and construct validity tests showed the VSI, when compared to the ASI and the 
HAD, to be the strongest predictor of current IBS symptom severity (26). Studies have also shown the VSI 
to have good concurrent, divergent  and discriminant validity (27).  Gastrointestinal Cognitions 
Questionnaire (Hunt, M., Ertel, E., Coello, J. & Rodriguez, L. (2014). Development and validation of the

18 self -report items that are rated on a 5 -point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (Hardly) to 4 (Very much). The 
questionnaire consists of three subscales. The pain/life interference subscale (e.g., When I feel my GI 
symptoms acting up, I'm afrai d the pain will be excruciating and intolerable), the social anxiety subscale 
(e.g., If I have to get up and leave an event, meeting, or social gathering to go to the bathroom people will 
think theres something wrong with me), and the disgusts sensitivity subscale (e.g., The thought of fecal 
incontinence is terrifying. If it happened, it would be awful). The GI -Cog has been shown to have excellent 
internal consistency ( = .92) and test re -test reliability (r = .87, p .001) (Hunt, Ertel, Rodriguez et al., 20 12).

survey - Participants will be asked to complete a survey of demographic information, that will help to 
determine whether the sample is representative and detect an y underlying differences between the wait -
list group and the intervention group. It will also aid the investigators in examining whether the effects of 
the intervention differ according to demographic characteristics. All questionnaires are standardized 
questionnaires that are readily available for use. Thousands of studies found in the literature utilize the 
DASS and PHQ9 to measure anxious and depressive symptoms, while a number of articles found in the 
literature have assessed and tested the reliability of the Visceral Sensitivity Index, the GI -Cog, the IBSQol, 
and the GSRS. The paper on the development and validation of the Fear of Food Questionnaire is currently 
in development. Thus, all measures being used are reliable standard questionnaires which hav e been tested

quality of life in patients with IBS.

baseline measures. When they have completed the consent and initial screening questionnaires, eligible 
participants will be randomized as abo ve and either given access to the app or informed that they are on 
the waitlist. At 8 weeks after enrollment, all participants in both the waitlist group and self -help app group 
will receive a battery of follow -up questionnaires (the same that they answere d directly after consenting in 
the beginning of the study as baseline measures). After completing the 8 week questionnaires, participants 
in the waitlist group will be offered access to the app. All participants will receive 3 month post -treatment 
follow -up questionnaires.  All questionnaires will be available through qualtrics.com. Study investigators

Abstract  
The purpose of this research is to assess if a new self -help app for IBS is an ac ceptable and effective 
intervention for improving the overall quality of life in patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome.  
Objectives  
Overall objectives  
As self -help modalities are increasingly available online and through smart phone apps, it is increasingly 
important to test the acceptability and efficacy of those apps through rigorous, controlled research. Bold 
Health (https://www.bold.health/) is a com pany in the UK committed to developing effective digital health 
interventions for a number of hard to treat conditions, including IBS. They have agreed to partner with me 
to make their app available for free to research participants so that we can test its  acceptability and efficacy.  
Primary outcome variable(s)  
GSRS IBSQoL GI symptom severity and overall health related quality of life are the primary outcome 
measures.  
Secondary outcome variable(s) 
VSI GICoG FFQ  PHQ9 DASS  
Background  
Irritable Bowel Syndrome  is a functional GI disorder that responds poorly to traditional medical 
management. Various psychosocial, mind/body treatments have been shown to be quite efficacious when 
delivered in person, in group format, via the internet with limited therapist feedb ack and in selfhelp book 
format. These interventions include cognitive -behavioral therapy, gut directed hypnotherapy, mindfulness 
and acceptance based interventions and interoceptive exposure therapy. With the population increasingly 
interested in digital,  interactive interventions, the time is ripe to develop and test a digital app that can be 
downloaded to smart phones. Bold Health has developed such an app that combines the best of many 
treatment modalities. (For example, Dr. Peter Whorwell, the develope r of gut directed hypnotherapy, wrote 
and recorded all the hypnotherapy imagery scripts for them.) They are interested in subjecting their app to 
rigorous testing to determine its acceptability and efficacy. They have agreed to make the app available at 
no cost to research participants in this trial.  
Study Design  
Phase*  
Not applicable  
Design  
The aim of the current study is to test the acceptability and efficacy of a novel digital app for IBS patients. 
The design of the study is experimental. There will be t wo experimental groups, an immediate treatment 
group and a waitlist control group. Once consented and enrolled, participants will be randomly assigned 
to either the immediate treatment group or the waitlist control group by the coin toss feature of random. org. 
Participants in the immediate treatment group will be able to download the app at no cost.  At 8 weeks 
after enrollment, all participants in both groups will receive a battery of followup questionnaires (the same 
that they answered directly after cons enting in the beginning of the study as baseline measures). Upon 
receipt of the 8 week questionnaire data, participants in the waitlist group will be given access to the app. 
All participants will receive 3 month post -treatment follow -up questionnaires. Th e research method is 
experimental (randomized controlled trial) with a waitlist control. Participation in the study will last 
approximately 4.5 months, depending on the subjects willingness to participate and rate of completion. All 
contact with participan ts will be over the Internet via e -mail and electronic questionnaires through 
Qualtrics. All study questionnaires and use of the app will be completed at the subjects' convenience and 
in their own home. All electronic questionnaire responses will be gather ed via Qualtrics secure servers. 
Questionnaire responses will be de -identified from participants contact information and will be assigned a 
code number in the main data file. Responses will be incorporated into a master database for further 
analysis. The m aster database will be password protected and only study investigators and the study PI 
will have access to the file.

Approximately one year, depending on speed of enrollment.  
Resources necessary for human research protection  
Describe resear ch staff and justify that the staff are adequate in number and qualifications to conduct the 
research. Describe how you will ensure that all staff assisting with the research are adequately informed 
about the protocol and their research related duties. Ple ase allow adequate time for the researchers to 
conduct and complete the research. Please confirm that there are adequate facilities for the research.  
The PI, Dr. Melissa Hunt, is a licensed clinical psychologist who has conducted a number of such trials in  
the domain of chronic GI disorders.  
Characteristics of the Study Population  
Target population  
The target population is individuals who have been diagnosed with IBS.  
Subjects enrolled by Penn Researchers 
120 
Subjects enrolled by Collaborating Researchers  
0 
Accrual  
Participants will consist of individuals currently suffering from IBS. There are many online forums that  
IBS patients frequent searching for advice, management strategies and support, including Reddit, 
Facebook, Healing Well and others. Participa ting in those forums allows researchers to recruit participants 
to trials like this one. Online trials like this typically have attrition rates of about 50% from the intent to 
treat sample. An initial enrollment of 120 would end with approximately 60 treat ment completers, or 30 
per group. Given moderate effect sizes, an N of 30 per group should allow us to detect significant effects 
at the level of alpha .05.  
Key inclusion criteria  
In order to be included in the study, subject must be at least 18 years of a ge or older, speak English, and 
have been previously diagnosed with IBS. Subjects must also own a smart phone and be willing to 
download the app.  
Key exclusion criteria  
Subjects will be excluded from the study if they are under 18 years of age, and therefore under the age of 
consent. However, subjects will not be excluded based on age if over 18 years old. Subjects will be 
excluded if they have another gastro -intestinal d isorder (such as an inflammatory bowel disease.) Subjects 
will not be excluded based on sex, race, socioeconomic status, or religion. Participants reporting severe 
levels of depression, or active suicidal ideation with intent will not be included in the tr ial, but will be 
offered the app at no cost.

Subject recruitment  
We wi ll recruit study participants via various online support groups and message boards. The invitational 
post will include a link to the study Qualtrics page which will start with the Statement of Research/Consent 
and then proceed to the baseline questionnaire s. Upon receipt of the questionnaires and determination of 
eligibility, the participants will be randomized and contacted with their group assignment.  
Will the recruitment plan propose to use any Penn media services (communications, marketing, etc.) for 
outreach via social media avenues (examples include: Facebook, Twitter, blogging, texting, etc.) or does the 
study team plan to directly use social media to recruit for the research?  
No

Will subjects be financially compensated for their participation?  
Yes 
The following documents are currently attached to this item:  
There are no documents attached for this item.  
If there is subject compensation, provide the schedule for compensation per study visit or session and 
total amount for entire participation, either as text or separate document  
If subjects are in the immediate treatment group, they will be compensated $20 for complet ing the 
posttreatment follow -up questionnaires in the week or so after they complete the program. They will be 
compensated a further $20 for completing the follow -up questionnaires 3 months after completing the 
program. Thus, their total compensation could  be as much as $40.  If they are in the waitlist control group, 
they will be compensated $20 for completing the follow -up questionnaires 8 weeks after the initial 
questionnaires. They will be compensated a further $20 for completing another set of follow -up 
questionnaires in the week or so after they complete the program. Finally, they will be compensated a 
further $20 for completing the follow -up questionnaires 3 months after completing the program. Thus, 
their total compensation could be as much as $60. P eople who are randomly assigned to the waitlist control 
group will be compensated more money to help make up for the fact that they had to wait for two months 
to access the app, and have to fill out the questionnaires one extra time.  
Study Procedures  
Suici dal Ideation and Behavior  
Does this research qualify as a clinical investigation that will utilize a test article (ie - drug or biological) 
which may carry a potential for central nervous system (CNS) effect(s)?  
No 
Procedures  
We will recruit study participa nts via online support groups, and online message boards. Interested parties 
will click on a link to the study Qualtrics page, which will start with the consent form/statement of research 
and then ask subjects to complete all the baseline questionnaires, i ncluding the Rome IV, GSRS, IBSQoL, 
VSI, GICoG, FFQ, PHQ9 and DASS. Upon receipt of the questionnaires and determination of eligibility, 
the participants will be randomized and contacted via email with their group assignment. Subjects in the 
immediate trea tment group will be given information about how to download the app at no cost. The only 
contact information required will be the subjects e -mail address to identify their responses. All forms of 
contact will be via email, as we do not have any intention o f contacting participants via phone.  At 4 weeks 
after enrollment, both groups will be provided with a check -in email to reassure them that any logistical 
Page 10 of 14 questions can be answered by the investigators at any point in the study and to encourage them to con tinue 
using the app (if in the immediate treatment group) or to hang in there (if in the waitlist group). At 8 weeks 
after enrollment, all participants in both groups will receive a battery of follow -up questionnaires (the same 
that they answered directly after consenting in the beginning of the study as baseline measures). Upon 
receipt of the 8 week data, the individuals on the waitlist will be given access to the app at no cost. All 
groups will receive 3 month post -treatment follow -up questionnaires.  All  questionnaires will be available 
through qualtrics.com. Study investigators will be responsible for sending participants the e -mails, the 
follow up questionnaires, monitoring the questionnaires online, and answering any questions participants 
may have thr ough e -mail. Questionnaires may take approximately 30 -45 minutes to complete.

The following documents are currently att ached to this item:  
There are no documents attached for this item.  
Data confidentiality  
Paper -based records will be kept in a secure location and only be accessible to personnel involved in 
the study.  
x Computer -based files will only be made available to personnel involved in the study through the 
use of access privileges and passwords.  
Prior to access to any study -related information, personnel will be required to sign statements 
agreeing to protect the security and confidentiality of identifiable information.  
x Wherever feasible, identifiers will be removed from study -related information.  
A Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained, because the research could place the subject at risk 
of criminal o r civil liability or cause damage to the subject's financial standing, employability, or 
liability.  
A waiver of documentation of consent is being requested, because the only link between the subject 
and the study would be the consent document and the prima ry risk is a breach of confidentiality. 
(This is not an option for FDA -regulated research.)  
x Precautions are in place to ensure the data is secure by using passwords and encryption, because 
the research involves web -based surveys.  
Audio and/or video recor dings will be transcribed and then destroyed to eliminate audible 
identification of subjects.  
Subject Confidentiality  
Subject confidentiality will be maintained throughout the study. Data from questionnaires and other 
completed materials will be available to download from the Qualtrics website account to a password 
protected, secure PC in the PIs lab or office. Identifica tion and contact information will be stored 
electronically in a spreadsheet separate from data that will reside on a password protected computer in the 
lab. Both the lab and the PIs office are locked when not in use. Data will be de -identified before entry  into 
the master spreadsheet. This will be done by assigning each subject (identified by email address) a number. 
Page 11 of 14 The electronic document containing this information will be kept separate from the identifying data 
spreadsheet, but both will be in the secur e, password protected PC.  
Sensitive Research Information*  
Does this research involve collection of sensitive information about the subjects that should be excluded 
from the electronic medical record?  
No 
Subject Privacy  
Privacy refers to the person's desire  to control access of others to themselves. Privacy concerns people, 
whereas confidentiality concerns data. Describe the strategies to protect privacy giving consideration to 
the following: The degree to which privacy can be expected in the proposed resear ch and the safeguards 
that will be put into place to respect those boundaries. The methods used to identify and contact potential 
participants. The settings in which an individual will be interacting with an investigator. The privacy 
guidelines developed b y relevant professions, professional associations and scholarly disciplines (e.g., 
psychiatry, genetic counseling, oral history, anthropology, psychology).  
We will collect e -mail addresses so that we can be in contact with participants and can e -mail them  about 
their group assignment and follow -up questionnaires. If a subject indicates that they are actively suicidal 
at any point during the study, the PI will contact them via email to inquire as to their safety and to offer 
referrals to local mental health  services. However, no further action will be taken that might compromise 
the subject's privacy.  
Data Disclosure  
Will the data be disclosed to anyone who is not listed under Personnel?  
Subjects who experience any technical difficulties with the app will be  invited to contact the tech support 
people at Bold Health. This should not involve disclosure of any PHI, however.

Risk / Benefit  
Potential Study Risks  
There are some risks to taking part in this study. Participants may find themselves more aware of physical 
sensations and IBS symptoms for a period of time after using the app. They will also be asked to think in 
new ways about problems and situations that  might come up in their life, including IBS itself. Sometimes 
it can be uncomfortable or even scary to think about things differently, or to practice new skills. In the 
event that a subject indicates active suicidal ideation on the PHQ9 (a score of 2 or 3 on item 9) they will 
be contacted by the study PI who will conduct a risk assessment and offer referrals to local mental health 
resources.  
Potential Study Benefits  
There are a few potential benefits of participating in this research study. Subjects will have the opportunity 
to use an evidence based digital self -help app for IBS at no cost that incorporates elements of a number of 
empirically supported treatments for IBS. The treatment may help reduce levels of depression, anxiety, 
and symptom severity as well as increase their overall quality of life. The purpose of this study is to test 
the acceptability and efficacy of a novel digital self -help app.  Apps like this one are proliferating in the 
digital space, and it is incredibly important that they be tested for actual efficacy.  The results of the study 
will provide researchers and clinicians with better understanding of whether or not digital self -help apps 
can be another treatment option for those with IBS.

• Mean change from baseline in the Itch Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)  score at Weeks 2, 4 , and 8. 
• Safety and tolerability assessed by monitoring the frequency, duration, and severity of adverse events 
(AEs); performing phys ical examinations; collecting vital signs; and collecting laboratory data for 
hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis. 
Overall Study Design:  
This is a randomized, vehicle- and active (triamcinolone 0.1% cream) -controlled study in subjects with 
mild to moderate AD.  The study is double -blinded for vehicle , INCB 018424 doses, and active control.  
Approximately 300 subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1:1 to INCB018424 1.5% BID, 
INCB018424 1.5% QD, INCB018424 0.5 % QD, INCB018424 0.15 % QD, vehicle BID, and active 
control (triamcinolone 0.1% cream BID ) and stratified by EASI score ( ≤ 7 and >  7).  Subjects receiving 
QD regimens will apply vehicle at the evening application.  Subjects will receive blinded study drug for 
8 weeks.  Subjects randomized to triamcinolone will apply triamcinolone 0.1% c ream BID  for 4 weeks 
and vehicle cream for 4 weeks to not exceed the allowable triamcinolone application duration. 
At Week 8 , subjects who meet criteria (compliant with the Protocol and no safety concerns) will be 
offered  open- label treatment with  INCB018424 1.5% cream BID  for 4 weeks. 
Through Week 8 , subjects should continue to treat areas identified for treatment at baseline even if the 
area begins to improve.   After Week 8, areas which were treated before Week 8 that are no longer 
symptomatic are not required to be treated.  
Subjects will have follow- up assessments 1 month after the last application of study drug.  
Study drug (INCB018424 cream , vehicle, or triamcinolone) may not be applied to the face or 
intertriginous areas.  The face and intertriginous areas may be treated with hydrocortisone 2.5% cream 
during the study.  Assessments of BSA should be based on the areas treated with study drug  (excluding 
the face and intertriginous areas that cannot be treated with study drug).  
Subjects who develop additional areas  of AD after the initiation of treatment may treat these additional 

Incyte Corporation  Page 5 of 72 
Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  areas (except the face and intertriginous areas) as long as the total treated BSA does not exceed 20% and 
there are no safety concerns regarding the additio nal application of study drug. 
Subjects may continue to use bland emollients that do not contain urea or ceramides during the study.  If 
bland emollients are used, the type of cream and amount of application should remain consist ent for the 
duration of the study. 
An interim analysis will  be conducted when at least half of the randomized subjects reach Week 4.  These 
data will be assessed by an unblinded team at the sponsor who do es not have direct contact with the study 
sites.  
Sites and the sponsor are blinded to study drug ; however , some personnel at Incyte (without direct contact  
with sites ) will be unblinded. 
Study Population:  
Men or women, aged 18 to 70 years, who have been diagnosed with AD for at least 2 years, with an IGA 
score of 2 to 3, and BSA involvement  (excluding the face  and intertriginous areas)  of 3% to 20 %. 
Key Inclusion Criteria:  
A subject who meets all of the following criteria may be included in the study: 
• Adult men and women aged 18 to 70 years, inclusive.  
• Subjects diagnosed with AD as defined by the Hanifin and Rajka criteria . 
• Subjects with a history of AD for at least 2 years.  
• Subjects with an IGA score of 2 to 3 at screening and baseline . 
• Subjects with BSA of AD involvement, excluding the face  and intertriginous areas, of 3 % to 20 % at 
screening and baseline. 
• Subjects who agree to discontinue all agents used to treat AD from scr eening through the final 
follow- up visit.  
Key Exclusion Criteria:  
A subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study: 
• Subjects  with evidence of acti ve acute or chronic infections. 
• Use of topical treatments for AD (other than bland emollients) within 2 week s of baseline.  
• Systemic immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs (eg, oral or injectable corticosteroids, 
methotrexate, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine) within 4 weeks or 5 half- lives of 
baseline (whichever is longer) . 
• Subjects with other dermatologic disease besides AD whose presence or treatments could complicate the assessment of disease (eg, psoriasis).  
• Subjects with a history of other diseases besides dermatologic disorders (eg, other autoimmune diseases) taking treatments that could complicate assessments.  
• Subjects with cytopenias at screening, defined as:  
− Leukocytes < 3 .0 × 10

Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  • Subjects with severely impaired liver function (Child -Pugh Class C) or end- stage renal disease on 
dialysis or at least 1 of the following:  
− Serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/ dL. 
− Alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase ≥ 1.5 × upper limit of normal. 
• Subjects taking potent systemic cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors or fluconazole within 2 weeks or

availability are permitted ). 
• Subjects who ha ve previously received Janus kinase inhibitor s, systemic or topical  (eg, ruxolitinib, 
tofacitinib, baricitinib, filgotinib, lestaurtinib, pacritinib) . 
INCB018424 C ream /Study Drug,  Dosage, and Mode of Administration:  
INCB0 18424 1.5% cream, INCB018424 0.5% cream , and INCB018424 0.15% cream  will be supplied  
and applied topically as a thin film to the affected areas in the morning and in the  evening at least 1 hour 
before bedtime.  The prescribed dose of study drug is to be determined by weighing a tube before and 
after the subject applies a thin film of study drug to the affected areas.  For each 1% of BSA (palm with 
fingers) to be treated with study drug, approximately 2 inches (5 cm) of study drug may be used.  Subjects 
will be advised to  limit use to no more than 1 tube per application.  Application instructions will be 
provided at study visits and via a diary card given to the subjects.  If sunscreen, makeup, or other cream 
has been applied to the areas to be treated, subjects should wash the treatment areas with  mild soap and 
water and pat dry before application of study drug.  If used , topical anti-infectives or other topical 
treatments should be avoided for at least 1 hour before  and after application of study drug to an area.   
Subjects should be cautioned to avoid excessive exposure to either natural or artificial sunlight (including 
tanning booths, sun lamps, etc) and, when outdoors, should be advised to wear loose- fitting clothin g that 
protects the treated area from the sun.   Immediately after application of study drug, s ubjects are to  wash 
hands thoroughly with soap and warm water. 
Reference Therapy, Dosage , and Mode of Administration:  
Vehicle  cream  is matching  in appearance to the INCB018424 creams, except it does not contain active 
drug.  Vehicle cream and triamcinolone 0.1% cream are to be applied in the same manner as 
INCB018424 cream.  Triamcinolone 0.1% cream treatment of 4 weeks will be  followed by vehicle  
treatment for 4 weeks.  Subjects receiving QD regimens of INCB018424 cream will receive vehicle 
cream at the evening application.  
Study Schedule/Procedures:  
Study visits as follows: 
Screening:   Up to 28 days before enrollment.  Screening will begin at the time that the subject signs the 
informed consent and will continue until the date the subject is enrolled in the study (Day 1). Treatment:   Subjects will have study visits on Day 1  and at  Weeks 2, 4, 8, 10, and 12 for assessment of 
safety and efficacy . 
Study drug will be applied in the clinic on the day of a study visit.  Subjects will be given a daily diary to 
record application times.  Subjects will also be instructed to bring all study drug tubes with them to each 
visit so that compliance can be assessed.  
Safety follow -up:  Subjects will have follow -up assessments 30 (±  7) days after the last dose of study 
drug to assess safety and efficacy .  If prohibited treatment for AD is started, then an earlier follow- up visit 
will be performed as a final, and thus end-of- study, visit.  
Safety assessments:  
At each scheduled study visits at the clinical site, targeted physical examinations, vital sign collection, 
laboratory assessments, collection of concomitant medications, and AE assessments will be performed.  A 
12-lead ECG will be performed at screening.  All laboratory assessments will be performed using a

INCB018424 cream is a topical formulation of INCB018424 phosphate under development for 
the treatment of subjects with psoriasis , alopecia areata (AA), and  atopic dermatitis (AD) .  
INCB018424 phosphate is an inhibitor of the Janus kinase (JAK) family of protein tyrosine kinases.  Isogenic and inflammatory cytokines are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis,  AA, and  AD.  Because JAKs serve to translate extracellular signals from a number of 
relev ant cytokines and growth factors upregulated in inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, 
AA, and AD,  JAK inhibitors represent potential therapeutic agents for these disease states.  
1.1. Atopic Dermatitis  
Atopic dermatitis affects approximately 20% of children a nd 10% of adults ( Silverberg  and 
Hanifin  2013), is increasing in incidence, and costs $3.8 billion a year in direct medical costs 
alone ( Ellis et al  2002).  Although not life-threatening, patients  with AD are at higher risk for the 
development of other life-threatening disorders such as asthma and food allergy  (Spergel  2010).  
Further more , according to the recent Global Burden of Disease project, worldwide AD is one of 
the 50 most prevalent diseases, and it has the second hig hest disability rank of all nonmalignant 
skin diseases  (Hay et al 2014).  Strikingly, despite the advances in tar geted biologic treatments 
for ps oriasis, no targeted therapies currently exist for AD.  
Topical therapies are limited to topical steroids, which  have associated side effects from 
long- term use , including glucocorticoid -induced folliculitis and localized skin atrophy.  The use 
of systemic glucocorticoids is also limited because of the adverse event (AE) profile.  If current 
topical therapies fail, then systemic immunosuppressive agents (eg, cyclosporine, methotrexate) 
are occasionally employed with highly variable efficacy and/or high risk of AEs.  However, recent studies indicate that oral JAK inhibitors are effective in the treatment of AD  (Levy  et al 
2015).  New approaches that improve AD symptoms  and quality of life without introducing 
safety issues are urgently needed.  
1.2. Inflammation  and Atopic Dermatitis  
Type 2  inflammation is widely known to underlie the pathogenesis of AD.  A number of studies 
have highlighted that T helper type 2  cells, group 2 innate lymphoid cells, and basophils, which 
all produce the t ype 2  cytokines interleukin ( IL)-4, IL -5, and/or IL-13, are highly pathogenic in 
the setting of AD  (Kim 2015).  Indeed, all of these cells are increased in frequency in lesional 
skin from AD patients .  Further blockade of these type 2  cytokines decreases disease in both 
murine models and in patients  (Kim et al 2014, Beck  et al 2014).  Taken together, simultaneous 
disruption of multiple type 2  inflammatory cytokine –associated pathways  via JAK inhibition 
may serve as a novel therapeutic modality in AD. 
1.3. Role of Janus Kinases  in Atop ic Dermatitis 
The type 2  cytokines IL -4 and IL-13 signaling through JAK1.  A number of drugs in clinical 
studies for AD are designed to block these cytokines and are highly promising new biologic agents (eg , dupilumab and lebrikizumab; Beck  et al 2014).  However, these new drugs employ 
humanized monoclonal antibody-mediated approaches, which cannot be used topically.  Thus,

Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  topical JAK1 inhibition presents a unique approach to develop a novel non steroidal 
anti-inflammatory agent.  Studies with oral tofacitinib (JAK1 - and JAK3 -inhibitor) have already 
demonstrated efficacy in AD.  Thus, topical treatment with INCB018424 phosphate is a highly 
promising approach for the treatment of AD.  To date, a topical JAK inhibitor with sufficient 
skin penetration has not yet been approved in AD .  The JAK1/2 inhibitor INCB018424 has been 
used systemically successfully in myeloproliferative disorders, and a topical formulation of 
INCB018424 has been developed and demonstrated to be active in subjects with psoriasis.

1.7.1. Clinical Efficacy With Topical INCB018424 in Psoriasis 
In a double-blind, vehicle- or comparator -controlled, ascending dose, safety, tolerability, PK, and 
preliminary efficacy study of INCB018424 cream in subjects with plaque psoriasis 
(Study INCB  18424-201), efficacy was demonstrated with both the 1% cream applied QD and 
the 1.5% cream applied BID, with a trend toward a dose response.  Improvement in lesion 
thickness, erythema, scaling, and reduction in total lesion area were observed in comparison to 
the vehicle.  Reductions in mean lesion scores were 53% for 1% cream QD versus 32% for 
vehicle (p ≤ 0.05) , 54% for 1.5% cream BID versus 27% for vehicle (p ≤ 0.05) , 46% for 1.5% 
cream BID versus 40% for Dovonex® cream , and 58% for 1.5% cream BID versus 44% for 
Diprolene AF® cream.  
In an open-label, multicenter, sequential-cohort, dose-escalation, safety, tolerability, PK, 
pharmacodynamic, and preliminary efficacy study of INCB018424 1% or 1.5% cream applied to 
2% to 20% BSA QD or BID for 4 weeks in subjects with active, stable plaque psoriasis 
(Study INCB  18424- 202), the efficacy analyses collectively revealed that all 5  regimens of 
INCB018424 cream, when applied for 28 days, were effective in decreasing the individual signs 
of lesion severity, lesion area, and the overall disease severity of psoriatic plaques .  Within each 
cohort, the mean individual and total psoriasis assessment scores for the treated lesions decreased 
from baseline to each subsequent assessment, indicating an overall lessening of disease severity.  
The total lesion scores for the control lesions within each cohort either increased from baseline, 
indicating a wor sening of disease severity, or decreased marginally from baseline.  
Study INCB 18424-203 was a 12-week, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, 
vehicle-controlled, double-blind, dose- ranging study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy 
of QD application of  INCB018424 cream (0.5%, 1.0%, or 1.5%) relative to vehicle cream in 
subjects with stable plaque psoriasis.  Within each active treatment group, the mean scores for 
the individual and total psoriasis lesion assessments, the Psoriasis Area Severity Index , the 
Physician Global Assessment, and the mean treatable percent age of BSA decreased from 
baseline to each subsequent assessment, which indicated an overall lessening of disease severity.  Thus, the efficacy analyses collectively revealed that all 3  doses of INCB018424 cream, when 
applied topically QD for 12 weeks, were effective in decreasing the individual signs of lesion 
severity, lesion area, and  the overall disease severity of psoriatic plaques .

Topical tofacitinib  2% BID was studies in a Phase 2 randomized vehicle- controlled clinical study 
in subjects with mild to moderate AD.  Over a 4-week period, improvements were noted in 
disease activity (Eczema Area and Severity Index [ EASI ] and pa tient- reported pruritus) and it 
was generally safe and well -tolerated ( Poulin et  al 2015).

018424 (Ruxolitinib) Safety 
In the randomized period of the 2 pivotal studies in myelofibrosis, Controlled  Myelo fibrosis 
Study With O ral JAK Inhibitor Treatment ( COMFORT )-I and COMFORT -II, discontinuation 
because of AEs regardless of causality was observed in 11.3% of subjects.  The most frequently 
reported adverse drug reactions were thrombocytopenia and anem ia.  Hematological adverse 
reactions (any CTCAE grade) included anemia (82.4%), thrombocytopenia (69.8%), and neutropenia (16.6%).  Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia are dose- related effects.  The 
3 most frequent nonhematological adverse reactions were bruising (21.6%), dizziness (15.3%), 
and headache (14.0%).  The 3 most frequent nonhematological laboratory abnormalities were 
increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT; 27.2%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST; 18.6%), and hypercholesterolemia (16.9%). 
Long -term follow -up in subjects with myelofibrosis (including 615 subjects treated with 
ruxolitinib during the controlled and extension phases of Studies INCB 18424-251 cutoff 
01 OCT 2012, COMFORT -I cutoff 02 SEP 2012, and COMFORT -II cutoff 01 SEP 2012 has 
shown that, as expected, the numbers and proportions of AEs and SAEs has increased; however, no new safety signals have emerged (median duration of exposure for this population is 27.6 months, with 1345.78 patient- years of exposure).  
In Study IN CB 18424-258, in subjects with myelofibrosis with a platelet count between 50 and 
100 × 10
9/L, beginning treatment with 5 mg BID was well-tolerated, avoided levels of 
thrombocytopenia associated with a high risk of significant bleeding, and provided an 
opportunity to increase the dose of ruxolitinib in a safe manner. 
Overall, the safety profile of ruxolitinib in the polycythemia vera (PV) population is generally 
consistent with that observed in the myelofibrosis population.  Ruxolitinib was generally 
well-tolerated in subjects with PV, and only a small proportion of subjects discontinued 
ruxolitinib because of AEs (3.6%).  Most of the AEs were managed by dose modifications.  
Hematological toxicities were less frequent and less severe in subjects with PV as compared with 
those observed in subjects with myelofibrosis.  No new safety signals emerged from a study in 
pancreatic cancer in combination with capecitabine.   
The AE profile of ruxolitinib was also assessed in 198 healthy subjects, subjects with various 
degrees of renal (n = 32) or hepatic (n = 24) impairment, and subjects with rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA; n = 59).  Adverse events were, in general, mild and  resolved without interventions.

CONFIDENTIAL  4. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
4.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a randomized, vehicle- and active (triamcinolone 0.1% cream)-controlled study in 
subjects with mild to moderate AD.  The study is double-blinded for vehicle, INCB018424 doses, and active control.  Approximately 300 subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1:1 to 
INCB018424 1.5% BID, INCB018424 1.5% QD, INCB018424 0.5% QD, INCB018424 0.15% 
QD, vehicle BID,  and active control (triamcinolone 0.1% cream BID) and stratified by EASI 
score ( ≤ 7 and > 7).  Subjects receiving QD regimens will apply vehicle at the evening 
application.  Subjects will receive blinded study drug for 8 weeks.  Subjects randomized to QD regimens will apply vehicle for the evening application.  Subjects randomized to triamcinolone will apply triamcinolone 0.1% cream BID for 4 weeks and vehicle cream for 4 weeks to not 
exceed the allowable triamcinolone application duration ( Figure  2). 
At Week 8, subjects who meet criteria (compliant with the Protocol and no safety concerns) will 
be offered open-label treatment with INCB018424 1.5% cream BID for 4 weeks. 
Through Week 8 , subjects should continue to treat areas identified for treatment at baseline even 
if the area begins to improve.  After Week 8, areas which were treated before Week 8 that are no 
longer symptomatic are not required to be tr eated.  
Subjects will have follow -up assessments 1 month after the last application of study drug. 
Study drug (INCB018424 cream , vehicle, or triamcinolone) may not be applied to the face or 
intertriginous areas.  The face and intertriginous areas may be treated with hydrocortisone 2.5% 
cream during the study.  Assessments of BSA should be based on treated areas (excluding the face and intertriginous areas that cannot be treated with study drug).  
Subjects who develop additional areas of AD after the initia tion of treatment may treat these 
additional areas (except the face and intertriginous areas) as long as the total treated BSA does not exceed 20% and there are no safety concerns regarding the additional application of study drug. 
Subjects may continue to use bland emollients that do not contain urea or ceramides during the 
study.  If bland emollients are used, the type of cream and amount of application should remain consist ent for the duration of the study. 
An interim analysis will be conducted when at least half of the randomized subjects reach Week  4.  These data will be assessed by an unblinded team at the sponsor who does  not have 
direct contact with the study sites.  
Sites and the sponsor are blinded to study drug; however, some personnel at Incyte (without direct contact with sites) will be unblinded.

4.2. Measures Taken to Avoid Bias  
The study is  randomized and double-blinded with a vehicle and active comparator (triamcinolone 
0.1% cream).  A designated site staff member will be assigned to dispense and collect study 
drug, as well as instruct and assist with application of study drug during the clinic visits.  This 
person should not have study responsibilities that involve either efficacy or safety assessments.  
Returned study drug should be collected before  other study assessments being performed.  Study 
drug should be dispensed at the end  of the visit by the same designated staff, after other visit 
assessments hav e been completed.  When the study drug is dispensed at the study visit, the 
morning dose of study drug for that visit should be applied.  The subject should be counseled at 
this time regarding questions about dose or method of application. 
4.3. Number of Subjec ts 
The study will randomize approximately  300 subjects  in a ratio of 1:1:1:1:1:1 .  Subjects who 
discontinue will not be replaced. 
4.4. Duration of Treatment and Subject Participation  
The total duration of participation will be up to 20 weeks, including up to 4 weeks for screening, 8 weeks of double-blind treatment, 4 weeks of optional open- label treatment, and 4 weeks of 
safety follow -up. 
4.5. Overall Study Duration  
The study begins when the first subject signs the ICF.  The end of the study will occur when all 
subjects have discontinued study drug and h ave completed applicable follow -up assessments or 
been lost to follow-up.

CONFIDENTIAL  4.6. Study Termination  
The investigator retains the right to terminate study participation at any time, according to the 
terms specified in the study contract.  The investigator is to notify the institutional review board 
(IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC)  in writing of the study 's completion or early 
termination, send a copy of the notification to the sponsor or sponsor's designee, and retain 
1 copy for the site study regulatory file.  
The sponsor may terminate the study electively or if required by regulatory decision.  If the study 
is terminated prematurely, the sponsor will notify the investigators, the IRBs and I ECs, and 
regulatory bodies of the decision and reason for termination of the study.   
5. TREATMENT  
5.1. Treatment Assignment  
5.1.1. Subject Numbering and Treatment Assignment  
All subject numbers will be 6 digits; the first 3 digits will be the site number, and the last 3 digits will 
be the subject's number.  This subject number will be maintained throughout the study and will not 
be reassigned.  Subjects who withdraw consent or discontinue from the study after being assigned a subject number will retain their initial number.  
The study will utilize an interactive response technology ( IRT) for management of study enrollment.  
The system will assign the subject study number, track subject visits, randomize according to the defined para meters, track study drug, and maintain the blind.  Site staff will contact the IRT after 
screening is completed to enroll the subject and to allocate the subject to treatment assignment and obtain the initial study drug assignment.  The investigator or designee will select the appropriate kit from their stock that corresponds to the information provided by the IRT and dispense the study drug 
to the subject.  All subsequent dispensing of study drug should follow this process.  Full details will 
be provided in the IRT manual. 
 
5.1.2. Randomization and Blinding  
For subjects who have met all study inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, the IRT 
should be contacted at baseline to obtain the study drug assignment.  
The IRT system will set minimum entry criteria for an IGA score of 2 or 3, a BSA 3% to 20%, and 
will stratif y the treatment groups based on baseline EASI score of ≤ 7 and > 7 .  If 1 or both of the 
limits are  reached, the IRT will stop assigning randomization numbers to that group, and no 
additional subjects will be enrolled in that group.  Subjects, investigators, and the sponsor will 
remain blinded to each subject's treatment assignment throughout the study (with the excepti on 
of the unblinded team that will assess the results of interim analysis) .  Emergency unblinding 
will occur if an AE requires the investigator to be made aware of the subject 's treatment 
assignment (see emergency unblinding procedures in Section  8.4 and refer to the Study 
Reference Manual ).

5.2.1. Description and Administration 
INCB018424 1.5% cream, INCB018424 0.5% cream, INCB018424 0.15% cream, vehicle 
cream, or triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream will be applied topically as a thin film to the 
affected areas (except the face and intertriginous areas) in the morning and in the evening at least 
1 hour before bedtime, with applications at least 8 hours apart.  Application instructions will be 
provided at study visits and via a diary card given to the subjects.  Application instructions will 
state that the cream is for dermatological use only and not for ophthalmic use.  If sunscreen, 
makeup, or other cream has been applied to the areas to be treated, subjects should wash the treatment areas with mild soap and water and pat dry before application of study drug.  If used , 
topical anti-infectives or other topical treatments should be avoided for at least 1 hour before and after application of study drug to an area.  Subjects should be cautioned to avoid excessive exposure to either natural or artificial sunlight (including tanning booths, sun lamps, etc) and , 
when outdoors, should be advised to wear loose- fitting clothing that protects the treated area 
from the sun as well as apply sunscreen (see Section  5.6.1 for permitted sunscreens) .  
Immediately after application of study drug, subjects are to wash hands thoroughly with soap and 
warm water.  
Vehicle cream  is matching  in appearance to the INCB018424 creams , except that it does not 
contain active drug.   Subjects receiving QD regimens of INCB018424 cream will receive vehicle 
cream at the evening application.   Triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream is in a different vehicle.   
Vehicle cream and triamcinolone 0.1% cream are to be applied in the same manner as 
INCB018424 cream. 
The prescribed dose of study drug is to be determined by weighing a tube before and after the 
subject applies a thin film of study drug to the affected a reas.  For each 1% of BSA  (palm with 
fingers) to be treated with study drug, approximately 2  inches  (5 cm) of study drug may be used.  
Subjects will be advised to apply cream as a thin film to the affected areas and limit use to no 
more than  1 tube per application .   
For all study visits where applicable, study drug should be applied at the visit to verify proper 
dispensing and application by the subject. 
5.2.2. Supply, Packaging, and Labeling 
INCB018424 drug product will be provided as INCB018424 1.5%, 0.5%, and 0.15% cream, or 
vehicle 1.5% (w/w free base equivalent) of INCB018424 phosphate cream.  INCB018424 cream 
(all doses), INCB018424 vehicle cream, and triamcinolone 0.1% cream and will be packaged as 
15 grams per tube.  Tubes will include labeling for morning  or evening application.  
Tubes will include labeling  in the local language and will comply with the legal requirements of 
each country . 
5.2.3. Storage 
The INCB018424 drug product and vehicle cream should be stored between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F). 

Incyte Corporation  Page 36 of 72 
Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  5.3. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance will be assessed for frequency of administration and total amount of application of 
study drug by reviewing the subject diaries and by weighing the study drug tubes.  Subjects will 
also be questioned regarding study drug application technique, missing doses, and use of any 
additional topical or systemic prescription s of other products or over- the-counter products.  
Starting at the Day 1 visit and each visit thereafter, a diary will be given to each subject in order 
to record use of the study drug.  The completed diary will be collected during each visit.  
Qualified clinical staff will review the subjects' entries for compliance.  Subjects who are noncompliant with study drug (defined as < 80% or > 120% compliant based on expected 
application regimen and weight of study drug tubes) will have their administration instructions 
reinforced by the investigator or a qualified designee.  Subjects will be considered compliant with the treatment regimen if they apply at least 80% but no more than 120% of the expected 
applications during participation in the treatment p ortion of the study.  Subjects who are 

Incyte Corporation  Page 37 of 72 
Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  noncompliant on more than 1 occasion will be reinstructed by the investigator or a qualified 
designee, and the sponsor should be consulted by the investigator for instruction on the proper 
handling of the subject. 
5.4. Treatment Interruptions and Adjustments  
5.4.1. Dose Modif ications 
Subjects who have additional areas of AD develop after the initiation of treatment may treat 
these additional areas (except the face and intertriginous areas) as long as the total treated BSA 
does not exceed 20%, amount of study drug applied does not exceed 1 tube per application, and 
there are no safety concerns regarding the additional application of study drug.  After Week 8, 
areas that  were treated before Week 8 that are no longer symptomatic are not required to be 
treated.  
5.4.2. Criteria and Procedures for Dose Interruptions and Adjustments  of Study Drug  
In some circumstances, it may be necessary to temporarily interrupt treatment as a result of AEs or laboratory abnormalities that may have an unclear relationship to study drug.  Except in cases 
of emergency, it is recommended that the investigator consult with the sponsor medical monitor 
(or other representative of the sponsor) before temporarily interrupting study drug.  Additionally, 
the investigator must obtain approval from the sponsor before res tarting study drug that was 
temporarily interrupted because of an AE or laboratory abnormality. 
Individual subjects may have administration interrupted at the discretion of the investigator, in 
consultation with the sponsor, for AEs or laboratory abnormalities until these have resolved.  
Subjects MUST have administration interrupted in the following situations: 
• The subject develops a Grade 2 increase in ALT (> 3 × ULN) or AST (> 3 × ULN) , 
or a Grade 2 decrease in ANC (< 1.5 × 10
9/L) or platelets (< 75 × 109/L), or a Grade 3 
decrease in absolute lymphocyte count (< 0.5 × 109/L).  Laboratory abnormalities 
should be confirmed with repeat testing within 48 hours whenever possible and STAT delivery of the laboratory results requested. 
• The subject develops a Grade 3 or higher laboratory abnormality, with the exceptions of lipase (in which case a Grade 4, > 5 × ULN , results in discontinuation of study 
medication ) or any asymptomatic triglyceride, cholesterol, or amylase elevations.  
Laboratory abnormalities should be confirmed with repeat testing within a medically 
indicated timeframe, based upon the investigator's judgment and in collaboration with the sponsor's medical monitor, and STAT delivery of the laboratory results requested. 
• The subject had a Grade 3 or 4 dr ug-related AE as determined by the investigator . 
5.4.3. Criteria for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Subjects who have administration interrupted based on above criteria will be followed until the 
parameters return to the normal range or to baseline values.  Laboratory evaluations can be 
repeated as frequently as daily.  A subject who has had their dose interrupted based on these criteria may resume administration with study drug at a later time if the subject no longer meets 
the criteria for interrupting the dose with the sponsor's approval in consultation with the 

Incyte Corporation  Page 38 of 72 
Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  investigator.  Subjects who meet withdrawal criteria (see Section  5.5.1) during study drug 
interruption will be withdrawn from the study and may not resume administration . 
5.5. Withdrawal of Subjects  From Study Treatment  
5.5.1. Withdrawal Criteria  
Subjects must  be withdrawn from study treatment for the following reasons: 
• The subject becomes pregnant. 
• Consent is withdrawn.   
• Further participation would be injurious to the subject' s health or well -being, in the 
investigator 's medical judgment.  
• The study is t erminated  by the sponsor. 
• The study is t erminated  by the lo cal health authority, IRB, or IEC. 
A subject  may be discontinued from study  treatment as follows:  
• If, during the course of the study, a subject is found not to have met eligibility 
criteria,  then  the medical monitor, in collaboration with the i nvestigator, will 
determine whether the subject should be withdrawn from the study. 
• Subjects who are noncompliant with study drug (defined as < 80% or > 120% compliant based on tube weight) will have the administration instru ctions reinforced 
by the investigator or a qualified designee.  After reinforcement, subjects who again fail to meet < 80% or > 120% compliance benchmarks in a subsequent visit will be 
considered for withdrawal from the study.  In such cases, the sponsor should be consulted by the investigator for instruction on the proper handling of the subject 
before withdrawal.  
• If a subject is noncompliant with study procedures in the investigator's opinion, the sponsor should be consulted for instruction on handling the subject. 
5.5.2. Withdrawal Procedures  
In the event that the decision is made to permanently discontinue the study drug , the subject will 
be withdrawn from the study and the end- of-treatment  (EOT)  visit should be conducted.  
Reasonable efforts should be made to have the subject  return for a follow-up visit.   These visits 
are described in Section  6.  The last date of the last dose of study drug and the reason for subject 
withdrawal will be recorded  in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). 
If a subject is withdrawn from the study : 
• The study monitor or sponsor must be notified. 
• The reason(s) for withdrawal must be documented in the subject' s medical record and 
in the eCRF.  
• The EOT  visit should be performed. 

Incyte Corporation  Page 39 of 72 
Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  • The date of the EOT visit should be recorded in the IRT. 
• Subjects must be followed for safety until the time of the follow -up visit or until 
study drug–related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible, 
whichever is longe st. 
If the  subject discontinues study treatment and actively withdraws consent for collection of 
follow-up data (safety follow-up or disease assessment), then no additional data collection 
should occur; however, subjects will have the option of discontinuing study drug but continuing in the follow- up period of the study for safety/efficacy assessments.  
5.6. Concomitant Medications 
All concomitant medications and treatments must be recorded in the eCRF and ideally should remain stable through the end of the treatment portion of the study.  All prior medications for AD  
and any medications received up to 30 days before randomization will be recorded in the eCRF.  
Concomitant treatments and/or procedures that are required to manage a subject' s medical 
condition during the stud y will also be recorded in the eCRF.

6.1. Screening  
Screening is the interval between the signing of the ICF and the day that the subject is enrolled in 
the study.  Informed consent must be obtained before performing any study- specific procedures.  
Assessments that are required to demonstrate eligibility may be performed over the course of 
1 or more days during screening. 
Results from the screening evaluations will be reviewed to confirm subject eligibility before 
randomization or the administration of study drug.  Tests with results that fail eligibility 
requirements may be repeated once during screening if the investigator believes the results to be 
in error.  Additionally, a subject who fails screening may repeat the screening process 1  time if 
the investigator believes that there has been a change in eligibility status (eg, following recovery 
from an infection). 

Incyte Corporation  Page 43 of 72 
Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  6.2. Baseline  
The results from the screening evaluations will be reviewe d to determine whether  the subject 
continues to meet the eligibility requirements as specified in the Protocol.  
Subjects who have signed the ICF and meet all the entry criteria (see Section  3) may be enrolled 
or randomized in the study on Day 1. 
6.3. Treatment  
Subjects who meet all of the study inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will return 
to the study site on Day 1 of administration.  Dates for subsequent study visits will be determined 
based on this day and should occur within the visit windows outlined in the schedule of 
assessments ( Table 2 ). 
The treatment period begins when the subject receives their first dose of study drug, which will 
be administered in the clinic.  The amount of study medication to be obtained from the pharmacy 
is determined by the BSA to be treated.  On Day 1, the prescribed dose is to be determined by weighing a tube before and after the subject applies a thin film of study drug to the affected 
areas.  For e ach 1% of BSA (palm with fingers) to be treated with study drug, approximately 
2 inches (5 cm) of study drug may be used.  Subjects will be advised to limit use to no more than 
1 tube per application.  Tubes of INCB018424 cream, triamcinolone 0.1% cream,  or vehicle 
cream will be dispensed to subjects with detailed application instructions .  The face and 
intertriginous areas may be treated with hydrocortisone 2.5% cream throughout the study. 
For all study visits, subjects should apply the morning dose of stud y drug in the clinic to assess 
understanding of dispensing and application.  A designated site staff member will be assigned to 
dispense and collect study drug, as well as instruct and assist with application of study drug during the clinic visits.  Th is person should not have study responsibilities that involve either 
efficacy or safety assessments.  Returned study drug should be collected before other study assessments being performed.  Study drug should be dispensed at the end of the visit by the sam e 
designated staff, after other visit assessments have been completed.  The subject should be 
counseled at this time regarding questions about dose or method of application. 
Subjects who are noncompliant with study drug (defined as < 80% or > 120% complian t based 
on tube weight) will have the administration instructions reinforced by the investigator or a 
qualified designee.  After reinforcement, subjects who again fail to meet < 80% or >  120% 
compliance benchmarks in a subsequent visit will be considered for withdrawal from the study.  
In such cases, the sponsor should be consulted by the investigator for instruction on the proper 
handling of the subject before  withdrawa l. 
6.4. End of Treatment/Early Termination  
If a decision is made that the subject will perman ently discontinue study drug, then  the EOT visit 
should be conducted.  If the EOT visit coincides with a regular study visit, then the EOT evaluations will supersede those of that scheduled visit, and the data should be entered in the 
EOT page in the eCRF.   If this decision does not coincide with a regular visit, reasonable efforts 
should be made to have the subject return to the site to have the EOT procedures completed. 

Incyte Corporation  Page 44 of 72 
Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  6.5. Follow -Up 
After the EOT visit (Weeks 8 or 12, or early termination), subjects will have follow-up 
assessments 1 month later to monitor for durability of effect (relapse rate), AE s, medication 
history, vital signs, and clinical assessments.   If prohibited treatment for AD  is started, an earlier 
follow-up visit may be performed.  A final and thus end-of-study visit should be performed 
ideally no earlier than 30 days after the last dose of study drug.  Adverse events and SAEs must 
be reported up until at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug, the date of the follow-up visit, or until toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible, whichever is 
longer.  If needed, a follow-up phone call will be conducted to determine any AEs or SAEs  
during the 30 days after the last dose of study drug.  Reasonable efforts should be made to have the subject return for the follow-up visit and report any AEs that may occur during follow-up. 
6.6. Unscheduled Visits 
Unscheduled study visits may occur at any time medically warranted.  Any assessments performed at th ose visits should be recorded in the eCRF.   
If the  subject develops new areas of AD, treatment of the new areas may begin after 
documenting of the new EASI score and photography of the  new or expan ding areas .  This may 
occur at an unscheduled visit. 
7. CONDUCT OF STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
7.1. Administration of Informed Consent Form  
Valid informed consent must be obtained from the study subject before conducting any 
study-specific procedures using an ICF approved by the local IRB/IEC that contains all eleme nts 
required by ICH E6 and describes the nature, scope, and pos sible consequences of the study  in a 
form understandable to the study subject.  Local and institutional guidelines for ICF content and administration must be followed; the original signed ICF m ust be retained by the investigator , 
and a copy of the signed ICF must be provided to the study subject.  The informed consent 
process for each subject must be documented in writing within the subject source documentation. 
7.2. Interactive Response Technology  Procedure 
The IRT will be contacted to obtain a subject ID number when a subject enters screening.  Upon 
determining that the subject is eligible for study entry, the IRT will be contacted to obtain the 
treatment  assignment.   Additionally, the IRT will be  contacted at each regular study visit to 
update the study drug  supply.  Full details will be provided in the IRT manual.  
7.3. Demography and Medical History 
7.3.1. Demographics and General Medical History  
Demographic data and general medical history  will be collected at  screening.  

Incyte Corporation  Page 45 of 72 
Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  7.3.2. Disease Characteristics and Treatment History  
A disease- targeted medical and medication history will be collected at screening. 
7.4. Prior  and Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
Prior and concomitant medications and procedures will be reviewed to determine subject 
eligibility.  All concomitant medications and measures must be recorded in the eCRF, and any 
medication received  or procedure performed within 30 days before randomization and up to the 
end of study will be recorded in the eCRF.  The medication record will be maintained  after  
signing the ICF  to document concomitant medications, including any changes to the dose or 
regimen.  Concomitant medications include any prescription, over- the-counter, or natural/herbal 
preparations taken or administered during the study period.  Concomitant treatments and/or 
procedures that are required to  manage a subject 's medical condition during the study will also be 
recorded in the eCRF.  
7.5. Safety Assessments  
7.5.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be monitored from the time the subject  signs the ICF .  Subjects will be 
instructed to report all AEs during the study and will be assessed for the occurrence of AEs throughout the study.  In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects will be asked general, 
nonleading questions such as "How are you feeling? "  All AEs (serious and nonserious) must be 
recorded on the source documents and e CRFs  regardless of the assumption of a causal 
relationship with the study drug .  The definition, reporting, and recording requirements for AEs 
are described in Section  8. 
7.5.2. Physical Examinations 
Physical examinations must be performed by a medically qualified individual such as a licensed 
physician, physician 's assistant, or an advanced registered nurse practitioner, as local law 
permits.  
Clinically notable abnormalities that are considered clinically significan t in the judgement of the 
investigator are to be reported as AEs.  
7.5.2.1. Comprehensive Physical  Examination 
The comprehensive physical examination will include height and body weight (at screening  
only) and assessment  of the following organ or body systems:  skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and 
throat; thyroid; lungs; cardiovascular  system ; abdomen (liver, spleen); extremities ; and lymph 
nodes; as well as  a brief neurological exam ination . 
7.5.2.2. Targeted Physical  Examination 
The targeted physical examination will be a symptom- directed evaluation.  The targeted physical 
examin ation will include assessment of the body systems or organs, as indicated by subject 
symp toms, AEs, or other findings. 

Incyte Corporation  Page 46 of 72 
Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  7.5.3. Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements include blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and body temperature.  
Blood pressure and pulse will be taken with the subject in the sitting position after 5  minutes of 
rest.  Clinically notable abnormalities that are considered clinically significant in the judgment of 
the investigator are to be reported as AEs.  
7.5.4. Electrocardiograms  
All 12 -lead ECG will be performed with the subject in a recumbent or semirecumbent position 
after 5  minutes of rest.  
The 12- lead ECGs will be interpreted by the investigator at the site  to be used for immediate 
subject management .  The decision to include or exclude a subject or withdraw a subject from 
the study based on an ECG flagged as " Abnormal, Clinically Significant " is the responsibility of 
the investigator, in consultation with the sponsor' s medical monitor, as appropriate.  Clinically 
notable abnormalities that are considered clinically significant in the judgment of the investigator 
are to be reported as AEs. 
7.5.5. Laboratory Assessments 
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed using a central laboratory.  A detailed description of 
the procedures for sampling, handling, storage, and shipment of the central laboratory samples 
and all material such as test tubes and labels is provided in the central Laboratory Manual.  If 
unscheduled local laboratory tests are performed , and if those results lead to a dose modification, 
delay, or dose interruption, or if any additional non-Protocol–required test is performed  because 
of an AE, then those results and the normal reference ranges for those analytes must be 
documented in the eCRF.  Otherwise, unscheduled local laboratory test results need not be entered in the eCRF.  
Additional analytes may be requested based on em erging data, if indicated for safety of study 
subjects.  In addition, some subjects may receive additional assessments as medically indicated; results of nonrequired tests may also be entered in the eCRF. 
7.5.5.1. Chemistry  
A panel of standard serum chemistries will be analyzed at times shown in Table 2.  A list of 
required analytes is found in Table 3.  All serum chemistries will be performed from blood samples collected without respect to food intake (ie, nonfasted). 
7.5.5.2. Hematology 
Hematology tests will be performed at each study visit indica ted in Table 2.  A list of required 
analytes for scheduled visits is provided in Table 3. 
7.5.5.3. Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will be performed at screening  indicated in Table 2. 

Incyte Corporation  Page 47 of 72 
Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  7.5.5.4. Pregnancy Testing  
Pregnancy testin g will be performed on all female subjects as noted in the schedules of 
assessments ( Table 2 ).  Serum pregnancy test will be obtained at screening.  A urine pregnancy 
test will be obtained all other visits.  A positive urine pregnancy test should be confirmed by a 
serum pregnancy test. 
7.5.5.5. Serology 
Subjects will be tested for hepatitis and HIV as shown in Table 3.  Serology will be conducted 
during the screening period.  This thorough hepatitis testing is being obtained to better interpret 
any abnormalities in liver function tests that may develop during the course of the study; therefore, it is not mandatory that results of all tests be available before enrollment (Day 1) if 
clinical evaluation and medical history provide no reason to suspect ongoing active or subclinical 
hepatitis infection.  
7.6. Efficacy Assessments  
7.6.1. Eczema Area and Severity Index Score 
Atopic dermatitis will be assessed using the EASI  scoring system (Appendix B ), which is a 
validate d disease measurement for clinical studie s (Hanifin  et al 2001).   The severity strata for 
the EAS I are as follows:  0 = clear; 0.1  to 1.0 = almost clear; 1.1 to 7.0 = mild; 7.1 to 
21.0 = moderate; 21.1 to 50.0 = severe; 50.1 to 72.0 = very severe ( Leshem  et al 2015).  
7.6.2. Investigator's Global Assessment  
The grades  for the  IGA are shown in Table 4. 
Table 4: Investigator' s Global Assessment  
Grade  Severity  Status  
0 Clear  No inflammatory signs of AD 
1 Almost clear  Just perceptible erythema and just perceptible papulation/infiltration  
2 Mild disease  Mild erythema and mild papulation/infiltration 
3 Moderate disease  Moderate erythema and moderate papulation/infiltration  
4 Severe disease  Severe erythema and severe papulation/infiltration  
5 Very severe disease  Severe erythema and severe papulation/infiltration with oozing/crusting

Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  7.6.4. Itch Numerical Rating Scale 
The Itch NRS  is a daily patient -reported measure (24-hour recall) of itch intensity .  Subjects will 
be asked to rate the itching severity because of  their AD  by selecting a number from 0 (no itch) 
to 10 (w orst imaginable itch)  that best describes their worst level of itching in the past 24 hours. 
Subjects will be issued a hand- held device (eDiary)  on which to record itch severity.  The subject 
will be  instructed to complete the eDiary each night beginning on the day of screening through 
treatment discontinuation.  Subjects will bring the device to the study site at each study visit so 
that the device charging can be verified and accumulated data can be downloaded, as applicable.  The device will then be returned to the subject for continued use each night.  The subject will 
return the device and the docking station for the final time at the EOT visit so that the data can be 
archived.  Detailed direction s for the administration of the eDiary will be provided in the Study 
Reference Manual.  
7.6.6. Photography 
For each visit with photography (baseline and Week 4), photographs of the areas of AD   
 will be obtained.

to record use of the study product.  The completed diary will be collected during the subject' s 
visit.  Qualified clinical staff will review the subjects ' entries for compliance.  Subjects who are 
noncompliant with either their study drug (defined as < 80% or > 120% compliant based on prescribed application regimen and weight of study drug tubes) will ha ve their administration 
instructions reinforced by the investigator or a qualified designee.  Subjects will be considered 
compliant with the treatment regimen if they apply at least 80% but no more than 120% of the 
expected applications during participatio n in the treatment phase of the study.

CONFIDENTIAL  8. SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING  
8.1. Adverse Events  
8.1.1. Definitions  
For the purposes of this Protocol, an AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related , that occurs 
after a subject provides informed consent.  Abnormal laboratory values or test results occurring 
after informed consent constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are 
considered clinically meaningful, require t herapy (eg, hematologic abnormality that requires 
transfusion), or require changes in the study drug(s). 
8.1.2. Reporting  
Adverse events  that begin or worsen after informed consent should be recorded on the Adverse 
Events form  of the e CRF.  Conditions that were already present at the time of infor med consent 
should be recorded on the Medical History form in  the eCRF.  Monitoring for the occurrence of 
new AEs should be continued for at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug.  Adverse 
events ( including lab oratory abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described usin g a 
diagnosis whenever possible rather than  by individual underlying signs and symptoms.  When a 
clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate AE . 
The severity of AEs will be assessed using CTCAE v 4.03 Grades 1 through 4.  T he CTCAE 
v4.03 severity of Grade 5 will not be used; AEs resulting in death  will be graded accordingly 
using Grades 1 through 4 and have the outcome noted as fatal.   If an event is not classified by 
CTCAE, the severity  of the AE will be graded according to the scale below to estimate the grade 
of severity:  
Grade  1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention 
not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
activities of daily living.  
Grade 3  Severe or medical ly significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living . 
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by nondirective questioning of the subject during the 
screening process after signing the ICF and at each visit during the study.  A dverse events may 
also be detected when they are volunteered by the subject during the screening process or 
between visits, or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments.  To the 
extent  possible, each AE  should be evaluated to determine: 
• The severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 to  4). 
• Whether there is at least a reasonable possibility  that the AE is related to the study 
treatment:  suspected (yes) or not suspected (no). 

Incyte Corporation  Page 51 of 72 
Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  • The s tart and end dates, unless unresolved at final follow-up. 
• The action taken with re gard to study drug . 
• The event o utcome ( eg, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, 
recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown). 
• The s erious ness, as per SAE definition provided in Section  8.3.1. 
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special reporting 
requirements  (see Section  8.3.2). 
All AEs should be treated appropriately.  If an AE is treated with a concomitant medication or 
nondrug therapy, this action should be recorded on A dverse Event form and the treatment should 
be specified on  the Prior/ Concomitant M edications  or Procedures and Non- Drug Therapy form 
in the eCRF . 
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until it ha s resolved  or until it is judged to be 
permanent;  assessment should be made at  each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any 
changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to 
treat the event , and the outcome. 
When the severity  of an AE changes over time for a reporting period (eg, between visits ), each 
change i n severity  will be reported as a separate AE until the event resolves.  For example, 
2 separate AEs will be reported if a subject has Grade 1 diarrhea, meeting the definition of an AE  
that lasts for 3  days before worsening to a Grade 3 severity .  The Grade 1 event will be reported 
as an AE with a start date equal to the day the event met the Grade 1 AE  definition and a stop 
date equal to the day that the event increased in severity  from Grade  1 to Grade 3.  The Grade 3 
event will also be reported as an AE, with the start date equal to the day the event changed in 
intensity from Grade 1 to Grade 3 and a stop date equal to  the day that the event either changed 
severity  again or resolved. 
8.2. Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute a n AE  in their own right (considered clinically 
meaningful, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or require changes 
in study drug ) should be recorded on the Adverse Event form in  the eCRF.  Whenever possible, a 
diagnosis rather than a symptom should be provided (eg, " anemia" instead of "low hemoglobin" ).  
Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteria for AEs should be followed until they have 
returned to normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.  When an abnormal 
laboratory te st result corresponds to a sign or symptom of a previously reported AE, it is not 
necessary to separately record the laboratory  test result as an additional event.  
Laboratory abnormalities  that do not meet the definition of an AE  should not be reported as AEs .  
A Grade 3 or 4 (severe) AE does not automatically indicate an SAE unless it meets the definition 
of serious, as defined in Section 8.3.1.  A dose modification  for the lab oratory  abnormality may 
be required (see Section  5.4) and should not contribute to the designation of a laboratory test  
abnormality as an SAE . 

Incyte Corporation  Page 52 of 72 
Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  8.3. Serious Adverse Events  
8.3.1. Definitions  
An SAE is defined as an event that meets at least 1 of the following criteria: 
• Is fatal or life -threatening . 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless 
hospitalization is a result of: 
− A routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associated with 
any deterioration in condition . 
− An elective surgery or preplanned treatment for a pre- existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the ICF. 
− A treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE and not resulting in hospital admission. 
− Any social reasons and respite care, in the absence of any deterioration in the subject 's general condition. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability , incapacity , or a substantial disruption of 
a person 's ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• Constitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect . 
• Is considered to be an important medical event  or a medically significant event that 
may not result in death, be immedia tely life-threatening, or require hospitalization but 
may be considered serious  when, based on appropriate medical judgment, the event 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
1 of the outcomes listed above. 
8.3.2. Reporting  
Every SAE, regardless of suspected causality (eg, relationship to study drug(s) or study procedure or disease progression), occurring after the subject has signed the ICF through the last 
study visit (or 30 days after the last dose of study drug, whichever is later) must be reported to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours  of learning of its occurrence, unless otherwise 
specified by the Protocol.  Any SAEs occurring more than 30 days after the last dose of study drug should be reported to the sponsor or its designee only if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study drug.   
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Adverse Event form  of the eCRF .  
The i nvestigator must assess and record the causal relationship of each SAE to the study 
treatment .  
The investigator must also complete the Incyte Serious Adverse Event Report Form, in English, 
and send the completed and signed form to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours of becoming aware of the SAE.  The investigator must provide a causality assessment, that is, assess whether 
there is at least a reasonable possibility that the SAE is related to the study treatment:  suspected 

Incyte Corporation  Page 53 of 72 
Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  (yes) or not suspected (no).  Refer to the Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Serious 
Adverse Event Report Form. 
The contact information of the sponsor' s study- specific representatives  is listed in the 
investigator manual provided to each site.  The original copy of the SAE Report Form and the 
confirmation sheet must be kept at the s tudy site.  
Investigational site personnel must report any new information regarding the SAE within 
24 hours of becoming aware of the information in the same manner that the initial SAE Report Form was sent.  Follow-up information is recorded on an amended or new SAE Report Form, 
with an indication that it is follow -up to the previously reported SAE and the date of the original 
report.  The follow-up report should include information that was not provided on the previous 
SAE Report Form, such as the outcome of the event (eg, resolved or ongoing), treatment 
provided, action taken with study drug because of the SAE (eg, dose reduced, interrupted, or 
discontinued), or subject disposition (eg, continued or withdrew from study participation).  Each recurrence, com plication, or progression of the original event should be reported as follow-up to 
that event, regardless of when it occurs. 
If the SAE is not documented in the IB for the study drug  (new occurrence) and is thought to be 
related to the sponsor' s study drug, the sponsor or its designee may urgently requir e further 
information from the investigator for reporting to health authorities .  The sponsor or its designee 
may need to issue an  Investigator Notification (IN)  to inform all investigators involved in any 
study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported.  Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and 
relevant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC , or as per national 
regulatory requirements in participating countries. 
8.4. Emergency Unblinding of Treatment Assignment  
The procedure for emergency unblinding is provided in the study reference manual .  This option 
may be used ONLY if the subject 's well -being requires the investigator to be aware of the 
subject 's treatment assignment.  
The investigator should make every effort to contact the sponsor' s (or its designee 's) clinical 
research physician  or medical monitor before  unblinding a subject 's treatment assignment; 
however, this is not mandatory .  If a subject 's treatment assignment is unblinded, the sponsor or 
its designee must be notified immediately by telephone.  
If an investigator, site personnel performing assessments, or subject is unblinded, the subject  
must be withdrawn  from the study treatment.  In cases where there are ethical reasons to have the 
subject  remain in the study, the investigator must obtain specific approval from the sponsor' s (or 
its designee 's) clinical research physician or medical monitor for the subject  to continue in the 
study.  

Incyte Corporation  Page 54 of 72 
Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  8.5. Pregnanc y 
Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that study drug may 
have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication or method.  When a 
pregnancy has been c onfirmed  in a subject during maternal or paternal exposure to study drug, 
the following procedures should be follow ed in order to ensure subject safety: 
• The s tudy drug must be discontinued immediately  (female subjects only ; see 
Section  5.4 for the  maximum permitted dura tion of study drug interruption). 
• The i nvestigator must complete and submit the Incyte Clinical Trial Pregnancy form 
to the sponsor or its designee within 24 hours  of learning of the pregnancy. 
Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safety 
evaluation.  Follow-up should be conducted for each pregnancy to determine outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any 
birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications, by following 
until the first well- baby visit.  Pregnancy sh ould be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy f orm 
and reported by the investigator to the sponsor or its designee.  Pregnancy follow-up information 
should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible causal relationship to the sponsor' s study drug to  any pregnancy outcome , as well as  follow-up to the 
first well-baby visit or the duration specified in local regulations , whichever is later .  Refer to the 
Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form.  
Any SAE occurring  during pregnancy must be re corded  on the SAE report form and 
submitted to the sponsor or designee.  
8.6. Warnings and Precautions  
Special warnings or precautions for the study drug, derived from safety information collected by 
the sponsor or its designee , are presented in the Investigator 's Brochure  (IB).  Additional safety 
information collected between IB updates will be communicated in the form of Investigator 
Notifications  (INs) .  Any important new safety information should be discussed with the subject 
during the study, as necessary .  If new significant risks are identified, they will be added to the 
ICF. 
8.7. Data Monitoring Committee  
No external data monitoring committee will be used ; however, an internal data monitoring 
committee will examine the interim analysis . 
8.8. Product Complaints  
The sponsor collects product complaints on study drugs and drug delivery systems used in 
clinical studies in order to ensure the safety of study participants, monitor quality, and facilitate 
process and product improvements. 
All product complaints associated with material packaged, labeled, and released by the sponsor 
or its designee  will be reported  to the sponsor.  All product complaints associated with other 
study material will be reported directly to the respective manufacturer.  

Incyte Corporation  Page 55 of 72 
Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  The investigator or his/her designee is responsible for reporting a complete description of the 
product complaint via email or other written communication to the sponsor contact  or respective 
manufacturer as noted in the packaging information.  Any AE associated with a product 
complaint should be reported as described in Section 8.1.2 of this Protocol. 
If the i nvestigator is asked to return the product for investigation, he/she will return a copy of the 
product complaint communication  with the product. 
9. STATISTICS  
9.1. Study Population s 
The i ntent- to-treat (ITT)  population includes all randomized subjects.   Treatment groups for this 
population will be defined according to the treatment assignment at randomization . 
The per protocol population includes randomized subjects who are considered to be sufficiently 
compliant with the Protocol. 
The safety evaluable population includes all subjects who applied at least 1 dose of study drug.  Treatment groups for this population will be determined according to the actual treatment the 
subject received on Day 1. 
9.2. Selection of Sample Size  
The assumptions in Table 5 were used for the percent age change from baseline in EASI scores  at 
Week 4 . 
Table 5: Assumed Percentage Change From Baseline in EASI at Week 4  
Treatment  Percent age Change 
Vehicle  30% 
Triamcinolone  0.1%  (active control)  50% 
INCB 018424 1.5% BID 75% 
INCB 018424 1.5% QD 65% 
INCB 018424 0.5% QD 50% 
INCB 018424 0.15% QD  30% 
The standard deviation was  assumed to be 0.13 (13%).  These assumptions were based on the 
review of a historical clinical study  in AD ( Beck  et al  2014).  
In order to provide a large safety database and to provided adequate power for efficacy variables,  
the total s ample size for the study is 300 subjects randomized in  a 1:1:1:1:1:1  ratio (stratified by 
baseline EASI score) to INCB018424 1.5% BID, INCB018424 1.5% QD, INCB018424 0.5% 
QD, INCB018424 0.15% QD, triamcinolone (active control), and v ehicle.

Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  9.2.1. Graphical Procedure  
A graphical procedure with gatekeeping testing strategy for the primary and key secondary 
analyses will be implemented .  A family of 7 elementary hypotheses, corresponding to treatment 
comparison between each active dose group to vehicle or triamcinolone is evaluated  in Figure  3 
based on the percent age change from baseline to Week 4 of EASI score. 
The pr imary  endpoint will  test the superiority of INCB018424 1.5% BID compared with vehicle.  
The k ey secondary endpoint has 2 branches.  Branch 1 will test  whether : 
• INCB018424 1.5% BID is noninferior to triamcinolone (active control) 
• INCB018424 1.5% QD is noninferior to triamcinolone (active control) 
• INCB0 18424 1.5% BID is superior to triamcinolone (active control) 
• INCB018424 1.5% QD is superior to triamcinolone (active control) 
Branch 2  will test whether: 
• INCB018424 1.5% QD is superior to vehicle 
• INCB018424 0.5% QD is superior to vehicle 
Figure  3: Illustration of the Statistical Treatment Comparisons  
 
AC = active control ; s = superiority; ni = noninferiority ; V = vehicle . 
9.2.1.1. Primary Analysis 
The primary alternative hypothesis ( superiority of INCB018424 1.5% BID compared with 
vehicle) will be tested at a 2-sided α  = 0.05 level.  The test on the primary endpoint will be used 

Incyte Corporation  Page 57 of 72 
Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  as a gatekeeper for 6 statistical tests on secondary endpoints that will be grouped into 2 parallel 
branches (see Figure  3).  The first branch (Branch 1) includes tests of INCB018424 versus 
triamcinolone.  The second branch (Branch 2) includes tests of INCB018424 versus vehicle, as 
visualized in Figure  3.  The initial allocation  of the overall significance level to Branch  1 and 
Branch  2 is three -fifths  and two -fifths , respectively.  The weights of the level to be passed on if 
1 hypothesis is rejected are specified in Figure  3. 
9.2.1.2. Secondary Analysis 
9.2.1.2.1. Tests in Branch  1 
• Step 1 :  The first alternative hypothesis  (noninferiority of INCB018424 1.5% BID 
compared with t riamcinolone) will be tested at a 2-sided α  = 0.03 level if the primary 
test is significant.  If the first alternative hypothesis is established, then hypotheses in 
Step 2 will be tested at an overall error rate of 0.03. 
• Step 2:  If Step 1 is established, then a superiority test of INCB018424 1.5% BID 
compared w ith triamcinolone and noninferiority test of INCB018424 1.5% QD 
compared with triamcinolone will be carried out using the Bonferroni- Holm 
procedure at an overall 2 -sided α  = 0.03 level.   
• Step 3:  If both of the null hypotheses in Step 2 are rejected, then a superiority test of 
INCB018424 1.5% QD compared with t riamcinolone will be carried out at a 2-sided 
α = 0.03 level. 
If all 4 tests in Branch  1 are significant, then the overall level (α = 0.03) of Branch  1 will be 
reallocated to Branch  2, and the first alternative hypothesis in Branch 2 will be tested with start 
level of 2 -sided 0.05.  If 1 or more of the tests in Branch 1 is nonsignificant, there will be no 
level reallocated from Branch  1 to Bra nch 2, and the first alternative hypothesis in Branch 2 will 
be tested wi th start level of 2 -sided 0.02. 
9.2.1.2.2. Tests in Branch  2 
• Alternative hypotheses (superiority of INCB018424 1.5% QD and 0.5% QD 
compared with vehicle) will be tested in sequence using the alpha level decided in the 
previous steps.  
If 1 or more of the 4 tests in Branch 1 is nonsignificant, but all tests in B ranch  2 are sign ificant, 
then the alpha level will be re allocated to Branch  1, and Branch  1 will re open with a start  level of 
0.05. 
9.2.2. Noninf eriority Margin  
In the historical study ( Beck  et al 2014) , the difference of percent age change from baseline to 
Day 29 in EASI scores between active control (placebo and glucocorticoids) and placebo was 
27.1% with the derived lower limit of 95% c onfidence interval  (CI)  16.4% .  Therefore, 
27% constitutes the minimum expected benefit of triamcinolone (active control ) over vehicle.  
Given that the result is based on 2 studies with small sample sizes, the margin is chosen to 
be -10%, which is between a half of the lower 95% CI  (-8%) and 50% of the minimum 
effect  (-13.5%).    

Incyte Corporation  Page 58 of 72 
Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  Noninferiority analysis will be performed between each of the active treatment groups and 
triamcinolone. 
9.2.3. Power A nalysis 
Given the assumptions specified in Table 5, a simulation following the graphical procedure was 
performed and showed that a sample size of 50 subjects in each g roup would yield a power of 
> 99% t o test the superiority of the each of the active treatment  group (INCB018424 1.5% BID, 
INCB018424 1.5% QD, and INCB018424 0.5 % QD) to  the vehicle group with a 2-sample t  test.   
Assuming no true differe nce between the active treatment group and triamcinolone with respect 
to percentage change from baseline in EASI scores and an SD of 13 %, the simulation showed 
that the sample size of 50 in each group would yield a power of >  99% to declare that the active 
treatment changes in INCB018424 1.5% BID  and INCB018424 1.5% QD are noninferior to 
triamcinolone (ie , that the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of INCB018424 minus 
triamcinolone is greater than or equal to the noninferiority margin of -10%).  The sample size 
will also provide at least 9 5% power to test the superiority of each of the active tr eatment groups 
of INCB018424 1.5% BID and INCB018424 1.5% QD to the triamcinolone  group. 
9.3. Level of Significance  
A graphical procedure with  a gatekeeping testing strategy for the primary and key seconda ry 
analyses will be implemented to control the overall Type I error r ate at a 2 -sided alpha level 
of 0.05.  The underlying procedure is derived using the methodology developed in Bretz et al 
(2009).  This method will guarantee a strong control of the family- wise error rate .  
Simulations results are provided to illustrate Type I error control for the graphical procedure.  
The Type I error rates, provided in Appendix E , Table E.2 , are strongly controlled in all 
scenarios.

9.4.1. Efficacy Analyses 
9.4.1.1. Efficacy Measures  for Primary and Secondary Endpoints  
9.4.1.1.1. Eczema Area and Severity Index –50 
Eczema Area and Severity Index  score is specified in Section 7.6.  T he categorical variable 
EASI -50 will be equal to 1 if the  percentage i mprovement from baseline in EASI  scores is 50 or 
greater and 0 if less than 50.  This definition is introduced for the purpose of identifying subjects 
who respond to the treatment (1 - re sponder, 0 - nonresponder). 
9.4.1.1.2. Investigator' s Global Assessment  Response  
Investigator' s Global As sessment  response is defined as an IGA score of 0  or 1 who have an 
improvement of ≥ 2 points from baseline .

CONFIDENTIAL  9.4.1.1.3. Itch Numerical Rating Scale  
The Itch NRS  score is a single -question as sessment tool with a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no 
itch' and 10 being  'worst itch imaginable. '  The average itch NRS score will be measured overall, 
for the previous week, and for the previous 24 hours.  
9.4.1.2. Primary Efficacy Analyses  
Comparisons be tween INCB018424 1.5% BID and vehicle based on p ercentage change from 
baseline in EASI scores at Week 4 will be performed with a  fixed -effect AN OVA model using 
last observations carrying forward in the ITT. 
The ANOVA model will include  the fixed effects of treatment  and randomization stratification 
factor .  If there are no data after the date of randomization, then the endpoint will be considered 
missing and will not be included in analysis. Supportive analyses for the primary endpoint include a similar ANOVA approach in  the per 
protocol population. 
9.4.1.3. Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Secondary efficacy analyses will be conducted in the ITT population.   
The key seco ndary endpoints  will be analyzed using the similar ANOVA as specified in the 
primary analysis .  The graphic approach will be used to control family -wise error rate .  Tests for 
noninferiority between 2 treatment groups  will be performed using the l east square mean 
estimate of the percentage change in EASI at 4 weeks .  Noninferiority will be established if the 
lower limit of a 2 -sided CI  for the difference (INCB 018424 minus active control) is higher than 
or equal to -10%.  There will be no adjustment for multiple comparisons for secondary endpoints 
besides key secondary endpoints. 
Mean, change from baseline, and percent age change from baseline of EASI scores at other visits 
besides Week  4 will be summarized using descriptive statistics .  Itch NRS  score daily ,  
 will be summarized and analyzed  in a similar fashion .  
An E
max model will be fit for assessment of the dose response and provide estimates of the 
maximum and minimum response levels, ED 50 (the concentration where the response is the 
midpoint between the maximum and minimum), and the slope parameter.

EASI -50 response, will be summarized and may  be analyzed by Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test  
with stratification factor of randomization. 
The Kaplan -Meier product limit method will be used to estimate time –to–EASI -50 response.  
Treatment comparisons may be performed using the log- rank test stratified by randomization 
stratification factor , if applicable.  
9.4.1.4. Other Efficacy Analyses 
Other efficacy variables will be summarized  and analyzed using similar methods as described for 
the primary and secondary endpoints.  
9.4.2. Safety Analyses 
9.4.2.1. Adverse Events  
A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is any AE either reported for the first time or worsening of a 
pre-existing event after first dose of s tudy drug.  Analysis of AEs will be limited to TEAEs, but 
data listings will include all AEs regardless of their timing to study drug administration.  Adverse 
events will be tabulated by the MedDRA preferred term and system organ class.  Severity of AEs 
will be based on the National Cancer Institute CTCAE v4.03 using Grades 1 through 4. 
The subset of AEs considered by the investigator to have a relationship to study drug will be 
considered to be treatment- related AEs.  If the investigator does not specify t he relationship of 
the AE to study drug, then the AE will be considered treatment -related.  The incidence of AEs 
and treatment -related AEs will be tabulated.  
9.4.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Laboratory test values outside the normal range will be assessed for severity based on the normal 
ranges for the clinical reference laboratory.  The incidence of abnormal laboratory values and 
shift tables relative  to baseline will be tabulated.  
Laboratory data will be classified into Grades 1 through 4 using CTCAE v4.03.  The following 
summaries will be produced for the laboratory data:  
• Number and percentage of subjects with worst postbaseline CTC AE grade (regardless

Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  − Regulatory inspection:  Regulatory authorities may conduct an inspection of the 
study and the site at any time during the development of an investigational 
product .  The investigator and staff are expected to cooperate with the inspectors 
and allow access to all source documents supporting the eCRFs and other 
study-related documents.  The investigator must immediately notify the sponsor 
when contacted by any regulat ory authority for the purposes of conducting an 
inspection. 
• Obtaining informed consent and ensuring that the study subjects' questions have been answered and the subjects fully understand study procedures:  
− Informed consent must be obtained before  any study- related procedures are 
conducted, unless otherwise specified by the Protocol. 
− Informed consent must be obtained using the IRB/IEC -approved version in a 
language that is native and understandable to the subject.  A template will be 
provided by the sponsor or its designee.  The sponsor or its designee must review 
and acknowledge the site -specific changes to the ICF template .  The ICF must 
include a statement that the sponsor or its designee and regulatory authorities have 
direct access to subject records.  
• Obtaining approval from the IRB/IEC before the start  of the study and for any 
changes to the clinical study Protocol, important Protocol deviations, routine updates, 
and safety information in accordance with institutional requirements and local law. 
− The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the safety reports provided by the 
sponsor are reviewed and processed in accordance with regulatory requirements 
and with the policies and procedures established by the IRB /IEC . 
• Adhering to the Protocol as des cribed in this document and agree ing that changes to 
the Protocol procedures , with the exception of medical emergencies, must be 
discussed and approved, first, by the sponsor or its designee and, second , by the 
IRB/IEC.  Each investigator is responsible for enrolling subjects who have met the 
specified eligibility  criteria . 
• Retain ing records in accordance with all local, national, and regulatory laws, but for a 
minimum period of at least 2  years after the last marketing application approval in an 
ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in 
an ICH region, or if not approved, 2 years after the termination of the test article for 
investigation to ensure the availability of study documentation should it become 
necessary for the sponsor or a regulatory authority to review. 
− The investigator must not destroy any records associated with the study without 
receiving approval from the sponsor.  The investigator must notify the sponsor or 
its designee in the event of accidental loss or destruction of any study records.  If the investigator leaves the institution where the study was conducted, the sponsor 
or its designee must be contacted to arrange alternative record storage options.  
− All eCRF data entered by the site (including audit trail), as well as computer 
hardware and software (for accessing the data), will be maintained or made 
available at the site in compliance with applicable re cord retention regulations.

Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  10.2. Accountability, Handling, and Disposal of Study Drug  
The investigator is responsible for drug accountability of INCB018424 phosphate cream, 
INCB018424 vehicle cream, and triamcinolone at the study site; however, some of the drug 
accountability duties may be assigned to an appropriate pharmacist or other designee.  Inventory 
and accountability records must be maintained and readily available for inspection by the stu dy 
monitor and are open to inspection at any time by any applicable regulatory authorities.  The investigator or designee must maintain records that document: 
• Delivery of study drug to the study site.  
• Inventory of study drug at the site. 
• Subject use of the study drug including tube counts from each supply dispensed. 
• Return of study drug to the investigator or designee by subjects. 
The investigational product as well as triamcinolone must be used only in accordance with the 
Protocol.  The investigator will also maintain records adequately documenting that the subjects 
were provided the specified study drug.  These records should include dates, quantities, and any 
available batch or serial numbers or unique code numbers assigned to the investigational product 
and study subjects. 
Completed accountability records will be archived by the site.  The investigator or designee will 
be expected to collect and retain all used, unused, and partially used containers of study drug 
until verified by  the study monitor (unless otherwise agreed to by the sponsor).  At the 
conclusion of the study, the investigator or designee will oversee shipment of any remaining 
study drug back to the sponsor or its designee for destruction according to institutional standard 
operating procedures.  If local procedures mandate on-site destruction of investigational supply, 
the site should (where local procedures allow) maintain the investigational supply until the study 
monitor inspects the accountability records in order to evaluate compliance and accuracy of accountability by the investigative site.   At sites where the study drug is destroyed before 
monitor inspection, the monitors rely on documentation of destruction per the site SOP. 
10.3. Data Management  
Data management will be performed in  a validated database via an Electronic Data Capture 
(EDC) system.  All data entry, verification, and validation will be performed in accordance with the current standard operating procedures of the Data Management Department  at the sponsor or 
its designee .  The database will be authorized for lock once all defined procedures are completed. 
The investigator will be provided with access to an EDC system so that an eCRF can be completed for each subject.  Entries made in the eCRF must be verifiable against source 
documents; if updates to the database are not possible, any discrepancies should be explained and documented.  The investigator will be responsible for reviewing all data and eCRF entries, 
and will sign and date the designated forms in each subject' s eCRF, verifying that the 
information is true and correct.  The investigator is responsible for the review and approval of all 
query responses. 
Protocol deviations will be identified and recorded in the Protocol Deviation form  of the eCRF.  
The study monitor will reference the Monitoring Plan in order to ensure that each issue identified

Protocol INCB 18424- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  is appropriately documented, reported, and resolved in a timely manner in accordance with the 
plan's requirements.  
10.4. Data Privacy and Confidenti ality  of Study Records  
The investigator and the sponsor or its designee must adhere to applicable data privacy laws and regulations.  The investigator and the sponsor or its designee are responsible for ensuring that sensitive information is handled in accordance with local requirements (eg, HIPAA).  
Appropriate consent and authorizations for use and disclosure and/or transfer (if applicable) of 
protected information must be obtained. 
Subject names will not be supplied to the sponsor or its designee, if app licable.  Only the subject 
number and subject' s initials (subject 's initials will only be recorded if allowable by local 
regulations) will be recorded in the e CRF , where permitted; if the subject 's name appears on any 
other document (eg, laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be 
supplied to the sponsor or its designee.  Study findings stored on a computer will be stored in 
accordance with local data protection laws.  The subjects will be informed that representatives of the sponsor or its designee, IRB or IEC, or regulatory authorities may inspect their medical 
records to verify the information collected, and that all personal information made available for inspection will be handled in strictest confidence and in accordanc e with local data protection 
laws.  
10.5. Financial Disclosure  
Before study initiation, all clinical investigators participating in clinical studies subject to FDA 
Regulation Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 54 – Financial Disclosure by 
Clinical In vestigators (ie, "covered studies ") are required to submit a completed Clinical 
Investigator Financial Disclosure form that sufficiently details any financial interests and 
arrangements that apply.  For the purpose of this regulation, " clinical investigato r" is defined as 
any investigator or subinvestigator who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of 
research subjects, including the spouse and each dependent child of the clinical investigator or 
subinvestigator.  These requirements apply to both US and foreign clinical investigators 
conducting covered clinical studies. 
Any new clinical investigators added to the covered clinical study during its conduct must also 
submit a completed Investigator Financial Disclosure Form.  During a covered clinical study, 
any changes to the financial information previously reported by a clinical investigator must be reported to the sponsor or its designee.  At the conclusion of the covered clinical study, the 
clinical investigators will be reminded of their obligation s.  In the event that the clinical 
investigator  is not reminded, the y nevertheless  will remain obligated  to report to the sponsor or 
its designee any changes to the financial information previously reported, as well as any changes 
in their financial information for a period of 1 year after completion of the covered clinical study.

CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX A. INFORMATION REGARDING EFFECTIVENESS OF 
CONTRACEPTIVE METHOD S 
For Subjects Participating in the Study:  
The following methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used 
consistently and correctly are considered as highly effective birth control methods.  
Such methods include: 
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation1 
− oral 
− intravaginal 
− transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation1 
− oral 
− injectable  
− implantable2 
• Intrauterine device (IUD)2 
• Intrauter ine hormone- releasing system (IUS)2 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion2 
• Vasectomised partner2,3 
• Sexual abstinence4 
 
1  Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the IMP, which may reduce the efficacy of the 
contraception method.  
2  Contraception  methods that in the context of this guidance are  considered to have low user dependency. 
3  Vasectomised partner is a highly effective method provided of avoiding pregnancy  that partner is the sole sexual 
partner of the WOCBP trial participant and that th e vasectomised partner has received medical assessment of the 
surgical success.  
4  In the context of this guidance, sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire per iod of risk associated with the study treatments.  The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.

CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX B.  ECZEMA AREA AND SEVERITY INDEX 
The EASI score examines 4 areas of the body and weights them for subjects 8 years of age and 
older as follows: 
Head/Neck (H) = 0.1, Upper limbs (UL) = 0.2, Trunk (T) = 0. 3, and Lower limbs  (LL)  = 0.4. 
The percentage of area involved for each of the 4 body regions is weighted as follows:  0 = no eruption, 1 = some to < 10%, 2 = 10% to 29%, 3 = 30% to 49%, 4 = 50% to 69%, 5 = 70% to 
89%, and 6 = 90% to 100%. 
Each of  the 4 body regions is assessed separately for erythema (E), induration/papulation/edema 
(I), excoriations (Ex), and lichenification (L) for an average degree of severity of each sign in 
each region with:  0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3= severe, with half- step allowed.

CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX C. POTENT CYP3A4 INHIBITORS AND FLUCONAZOLE  
In clinical studies with CYP3A4 inhibitors, elevated levels of INCB018424 of approximately 
2-fold have been observed after oral administration.  Additionally, simulations using 
physiologically based pharmacokinetic models suggested that fluconazole (a dual CYP3A4 and 
CYP 2C9 inhibitor) increases steady- state ruxolitinib AUC by approximately 1 - to 3-fold after  
oral administration.   Thus, these concomitant medications should not be taken by subjects 
beginning 2 weeks or 5 half- lives  (whichever is longer) before the first application of study drug 
until the last administration (either Week  24 or Week 48); however, topical use of these agents if 
the systemic bioavailability is low may be permitted on a case by case basis.  The followin g is a 
list of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and fluconazole.  The sponsor should be contacted with any 
questions regarding concomitant medications that might be considered potent CYP3A4 inhibitors but are not on this list.

CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX E.  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Type I Error Rates  
Six scenarios are examined for Type I error rates, corresponding to null hypothesis that there is 
no different treatment effect between 1 or more active treatment groups with  active control or 
vehicle.   
With 50 subjects per group, normal distributions, with standard deviation of 0.13, and mean 
percentage changes specified in Table E.1 were generated .  For each scenario, 
10,000 replications were run us ing SAS® 9.2.  Comparisons between each of the active dose to 
active control or vehicle are perfo rmed using 2 sample t- tests.  Confidence interval s of the means 
(INCB 018424 - active control or vehicle) were created with  corresponding alpha level following 
the graphical procedure specified in Section  9.2.  The lower limits of CIs were  compared with 
the critical  values (0 for superiority, and - 10% for noninferiority ) for treatment comparisons.  To 
provide conservative estimates, the primary comparison  (INCB018424 1.5% BID vs vehicle 
superiority) was excluded from  the procedure, that is, only key secondary endpoints were 
evaluated.  
The Type I error rates  are provided in Table E.2  under different null hypotheses.  The rates are 
compared with the nominal alpha 2.5%, which showed that the Type I error rate s are 
well-controlled in all scenarios (< 2.5%).

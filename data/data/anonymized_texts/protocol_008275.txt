1  PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1 SYNOPSIS   
Title:  Efficacy of opioid -limiting pain management protocol in men undergoing 
urethroplasty  
Study Description :  
Objectives:  
 The purpose of this study is to assess the difference in narcotic usage 
between two different pain management  protocols after urethroplasty.  
Endpoint s: The primary endpoints are overall pain scores and rate of prescription 
filling.  
Study Population:  The study population is adult men who are scheduled for anterior 
urethroplasty surgery  and have no exclusion criteria.  
Phase:   
Description of Study  
Intervention: Participants will be randomized to a control or intervention group. The 
intervention group will receive acetaminophen 975mg PO, Celebrex 
200mg PO, and gabapentin 300mg PO in preoperative holding, and they will receive 30mL 1/2 % bupivacaine injection and dexamethasone 4mg as a peripheral nerve block (dorsal penile nerve and pudendal branches) at the beginnin g of surgery. The control group will  receive historical standard 
management o f pain during and after surgery.  
Study Duration:  16 months  
Subject  Duration:  Approximately 1 month

  2 2  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE   
 
In the past the PI has  participated in a study on the use of bupivacaine for pain control after penile 
prosthesis placement. We found that patients who received bupivacaine had statistically significantly 
lower pain scores after surgery in the prior surgery. We have also been u sing the ERAS protocol  
(Enhanced Recovery after Surgery), a multimodal perioperative care pathway designed to achieve early recovery after surgical procedures, for cystectomy and seen reduced narcotic usage among those patients.  Given the heightened concern over narcotic usage by postoperative patients, including the risk 
of chronic usage by even young patients, our objective will be to assess if using this protocol can limit the need for postoperative narcotics prescriptions.   
 
2.2 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT    
 
2.2.1  KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  
 Risks are minimal and include any possible reaction to the injection agent. This may include damage to local structures or an allergic reaction to the bupivacaine and the agents within it.  Risks of the enhanced recovery include the general risks of the additional medications given. These 
include: side effect or allergic reaction from acetaminophen or gabapentin, pain and  discomfort from 
the procedure, excessive bleeding, infection, nerve damage, failed analgesia, and allergic reaction to local anesthetic. Risks are listed below.  
 Allergic reaction: rare, unlikely to be severe, reversible  
Bleeding: very rare for severe bleeding, reversible  
Infection: uncommon, treatable with antibiotics, reversible with treatment Nerve damage: very rare, can be severe, may or may not be reversible Failed analgesia: rare, reversible with more anesthetic given  
 The usual precautions taken during giving oral medication or injection of a local anesthetic will be  aken – 
ensuring no allergy, ensuring no injection directly into a blood vessel, ensuring non -expiration status of 
the drug, etc. Monitoring will be done by the surgical and anesthetic team intraoperatively and postoperatively.  
 
3 STUDY DESIGN  
 
3.1 OVERALL DESIGN  
 Our management at the current time varies between giving intraoperative analgesics with peripheral 
nerve blocks in some patients, but others we do not. In this study, one group will continue the historical standard care of the hospital, which involves postoperative NSAIDs and narcotics for pain control. The other group will utilize a protocol to minimize narcotics usage, including acetaminophen, gabapentin, Celebrex, and local anesthetic (bupivacaine) in an attempt to reduce the usage of narcotics after urethroplasty surgery. Patient pain scores will be measured in clinic, on the day of surgery in 
preoperative holding, and per the standard protocol postoperatively . During surgery, patients will be 
randomized to receive either the standard protocol or the enhanced recovery protocol. At discharge, 
 Version 1.0 
 10OCT2020 
  3 men will be given a narcotic prescription in a sealed envelope after surgery, with each patient getting 
the same narcotic prescription regardless of group. Pain scores, time to first narcotic usage, use of 
narcotics in morphine equivalents, and narcotic refill requests will be assessed postoperatively. Prescription filling will be monitored via the Alabama Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP).

by the PI for any exclusion criteria by examining the medical record and history of the patient and 
planning their procedure.  
 
5 STUDY INTERVENTION  
5.1.1  DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION  
 Surgery:  Once they have signed the consent, on the day of their surgery, patients will be logged into  he 
system and randomized into one of two groups. Group 1 will receive the enhanced protocol: acetaminophen, Celebrex, and gabapentin pre -op, with 30 mL of 1/2 % bupivacaine and 4mg of 
dexamethasone given as a perineal nerve block at the time of urethroplasty surgery. Narcotics will be 
 Version 1.0 
 10OCT2020 
  4 administered judiciously and as seen fit by the anesthesia and/or surgical teams. Postoperative 
prescriptions will include NSAIDs and narcotics, with patients encouraged to use NSAIDs primarily and narcotics as breakthrough pain control; Group 2 (standard group) will receive the historical standard, which may include narcotics during and after surgery. As in group 1, Postoperative prescriptions will 
include NSAIDs and narcotics, with patients encouraged to use NSAIDs primarily and narcotics as 
breakthrough pain control. Randomization will be performed using a random number generator. The 
surgeon will not be blinded as they perform the local anesthetic injection. Patients will not be blinded insofar as each patient in the enhanced recovery group will receive oral medication preoperatively that the historical group will not.  
 Post -Operative Period:  Upon arrival in the PACU, the (sub)investigator, using the numerical rating scale 
(NRS), will clinically assess post -operative pain. Assessment of patient pain levels involve a series of NRS 
testing postoperatively (upon arrival and every 15 minutes postoperatively until discharge from the PACU) using a 10 cm line.  Patients that complain of pain intensity >5  
cm/10cm on the NRS, will be given a rescue intravenous hydromorphone regimen, IV hydromorphone at 0.4mg up to a max dose of 2mg prn q 2 hours or until a VAS of <5 is obtained. Due to hydromorphone shortages, IV fentanyl at 25 -50mcg dosings or morphine at 2 -4mg dosings can be substituted. Post -
operative PACU narcotic consumption will be recorded and quantified. Post -operative nausea and 
vomiting (PONV) will be assessed using a PONV rating scale every 15 minutes until PACU discharge.  PONV will be rated as 0,  no nausea; 1, mild nausea ≤ 15 minutes; 2, nausea ≥ 5 minutes and 3, vomiting.  
PONV will be treated with ondanestron 4 mg intravenously and, if persistent, with metoclopramide 10 mg intravenously.     
 If admitted, PO acetaminophen and/or ibuprofen, along with PO and IV narcotics will be available based 
on current standard practice. Pain scores will be charted by nursing based on current hospital protocol.  
Upon discharge, patient will be given prescriptions for ibuprofen 800mg and acetaminophen 1000mg to 
take on a scheduled basis, alternating for three days. Medications will then be taken as needed. A prescription for narcotic medication (14 pills of oxycodone) will be given in a sealed envelope, and patients will be asked to use this prescription only if needed. The men will then bring the envelope or prescription bottle back to the postoperative visit for assessment of need for narcotics using pill counts.  
5.2 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION  
 Randomization will be performed using a random number generator. The surgeon will not be blinded as they perform the local anesthetic injection. Patients will not be blinded insofar as each patient in the 
enhanced recovery group will receive oral medicatio n preoperatively that the historical group will not.  
 
 
 
6 STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND SUBJECT  
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
 
6.1 SUBJECT  DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY 
Subject s are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue  or withdraw a subject  from  the study for the following reasons : 
 
• Significant study intervention non -compliance  
 Version 1.0 
 10OCT2020 
  5 • If any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation 
occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the 
subject  
Subjects who sign the informed consent form and are randomized but do not receive the study 
intervention may be replaced.  Subjects who sign the informed consent form, and are randomized and 
receive the study intervention , and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or discontinued  from the 
study, will not be replaced.  
6.2 LOST TO FOLLOW- UP 
A subject  will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she fails to return for 2 scheduled visits and is 
unable to be contacted by the study site  staff.  
 The following actions must be taken if a subject  fails to be available for a required study visit:  
• The site will  attempt to contact the subject  and reschedule the missed visit and counsel the 
subject  on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the subject  
wishes to and/or should continue in the study.  
• Before a subject  is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will m ake every effort 
to regain contact with the subject  (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified 
letter to the subject ’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact 
attempts should be documented in the subject ’s medical record or study file.  
• Should the subject  continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have withdrawn 
from the study with a primary rea son o f lost to follow -up. 
 
 
7 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
 
7.1 STUDY  ASSESSMENTS  
 Screening: Patients coming into the Urology Clinic at Kirklin Clinic to see Dr. Baumgarten  will be 
screened  for inclusion and exclusion criteria. After presenting the research to them, potential 
participants will have until the day of their surgery to decide whether or not they wish to enroll in the 
protocol.  
 Surgery: Once they have signed the consent, on the day of their surgery, patients will be logged into  the 
system and randomized into one of two groups. Group 1 will receive the enhanced protocol: acetaminophen, Celebrex, and gabapentin pre -op, with 30 mL of 1/2 % bupivacaine and 4mg of 
dexamethasone given as a perineal nerve block at the time of urethropla sty surgery. Narcotics will be 
administered judiciously and as seen fit by the anesthesia and/or surgical teams. Postoperative prescriptions will include NSAIDs and narcotics, with patients encouraged to use NSAIDs primarily and narcotics as breakthrough pain control; Group 2 (standard group) will receive the historical standard, which may include narcotics during and after surgery. As in group 1, Postopera tive prescriptions will 
include NSAIDs and narcotics, with patients encouraged to use NSAIDs primarily and narcotics as breakthrough pain control. Randomization will be performed using a random number generator. The surgeon will not be blinded as they perf orm the local anesthetic injection. Patients will not be blinded

  6 insofar as each patient in the enhanced recovery group will receive oral medication preoperatively that 
the historical group will not.  
 Post -Operative Period: Upon arrival in the PACU, the (sub)investigator, using the numerical rating  scale 
(NRS), will clinically assess post -operative pain. Assessment of patient pain levels involve a series of NRS 
testing postoperatively (upon arrival and every 15 minutes postoperatively until discharge from the PACU) using a 10 cm line.  Patients that complain of pain intensity >5  
cm/10cm on the NRS, will be given a rescue intravenous hydromorphone regimen, IV hydromorphone at 0.4mg up to a max dose of 2mg prn q 2 hours or until a VAS of <5 is obtained. Due to hydromorphone shortages, IV fentanyl at 25 -50mcg dosings or morphine at 2 -4mg dosings can be substituted. Post -
operative PACU narcotic consumption will be recorded and quantified. Post -operative nausea and 
vomiting (PONV) will be assessed using a PONV rating scale every 15 minutes until PACU discharge.  PONV will be rated as 0,  no nausea; 1, mild nausea ≤ 15 minutes; 2, nausea ≥ 5 minutes and 3, vomiting.  
PONV will be treated with ondanestron 4 mg intravenously and, if persistent, with metoclop ramide 10 
mg intravenously.  If admitted, PO acetaminophen and/or ibuprofen, along with PO and IV narcotics will 
be available based on current standard practice. Pain scores will be charted by nursing based  on current 
hospital protocol. Upon discharge, patient will be given prescriptions for ibuprofen 800mg and acetaminophen 1000mg to take  on a scheduled basis, alternating for three days. Medications will then 
be taken as needed. A prescription for narcotic medication (14 pills of oxycodone) will be given in a sealed envelope, and patients will be asked to use this prescription only if need ed. The men will then 
bring the envelope or prescription bottle back to the postoperative visit for assessment of need for narcotics using pill counts.  
 Data Collection: Study personnel will use information from the patient’s medical record as well as  pain 
scale responses and number of narcotic pills used post -operatively to populate the database.  
 
7.2 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
   
7.2.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurren ce associated with the use of an intervention in 
humans, whether or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  
 
7.2.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “ serious ” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life-threatening adverse event  (of note, the term “life- threatening” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event, rather than to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe ) 
• inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions  
• or a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
 Version 1.0 
 10OCT2020 
  7 subject  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or con vulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
7.2.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
7.2.3.1  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For adverse events (AEs) , the following guidelines will be used to describe severi ty:  
 
• Mild  – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject ’s daily 
activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe  – Events interrupt a subject ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy 
or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  Of 
note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious .” 
 
7.2.3.2  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
All adverse events ( AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by the clinician who 
examines and evaluates the subject  based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The 
degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect.  
 
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention , there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study intervention  caused the AE , or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
intervention  and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study intervention  and the AE. 
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention  caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention  
and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
7.2.3.3  EXPECTEDNESS  
The Principal Investigator will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event ( AE) is expected 
or unexpected.  An AE  will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is 
not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention . 
7.2.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE ) or serious adverse event (SAE ) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study subject  presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor.  
 All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAE s will be captured on the 
appropriate  case report form  (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs 
 Version 1.0 
 10OCT2020 
  8 occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be 
followed to adequate resolution.  
 Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject  is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study subject ’s condition  deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity  to be performed. A Es characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each episode.  
 The Study Coordinator  will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after 
informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of 
study participation.  At each study visit, the Study Coordinator  will inquire about the occurrence of 
AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
 
7.2.5  ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
All serious adverse events must be reported to the IRB according to regulatory requirement s. The 
Principal Investigator will immediately report to the sponsor any serious adverse event, whether or not 
considered study intervention related, including those listed in the protocol or package insert  and must 
include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the event. Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all- cause mortality) must be reported 
in accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the study intervention and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator must immediately report the event to the sponsor.  
 All serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the Principal 
Investigator deems the event to be chronic or the subject  is stable. Other supporting documentation of 
the event may be requested and should be provided as soon as possible.  
 
7.3 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
7.3.1  DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP) 
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
subject s or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the 
following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject  population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research); and  
• Suggests that the research places subject s or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 Version 1.0 
 10OCT2020 
  9  
7.3.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING  
The investigator will report unanticipated problems (UP s) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB). The UP report will include the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP ;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP . 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UP s will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
• UPs that are serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB within 10 working days  of 
the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP  will be reported to the IRB within 10 working days  of the investigator becoming 
aware of the problem.  
 
8 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
8.1 REGULATORY, ETHICAL, AND STUDY OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS  
 
8.1.1  INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
 
8.1.1.1  CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO SUBJECT S 
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention , study procedures, and risks are given to the 
subject  and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to conducting study screening 
procedures . A separate screening consent form will not be used.  
 
8.1.1.2  CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation.
 Consent forms will be Institutional 
Review Board ( IRB)-approved and the subject  will be asked to read and review the document. T he 
investigator will explain the research study to the subject and answer any questions that may arise. A 
verbal explanation will be provided in terms suited to the subject ’s comprehension of the purposes, 
proc edures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research subjects.  Subject s will have 
the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing.  The 
subject s should have the opportunity to discuss the study with their family or surrogates or think about 
it prior to agreeing to participate. The subject  will sign the informed consent document prior to any 
procedures being done specifically for the study.  Subject s must be informed that participation is 
voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice.  A copy of the 
informed consent document will be given to the subject s for their records. The informed consent 
process will be conducted and  documented in the source document (including the date), and the form 
signed, before the subject  undergoes any study -specific procedures.  The rights and welfare of the 
 Version 1.0 
 10OCT2020 
  10 subject s will be protected by emphasizing to them that the quality of their medical care will not be 
adversely affected if they decline to participate in this study.  
8.1.2  STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable 
cause.  Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by the suspending or terminating party to regulat ory authorities.  If the study is prematurely 
terminated or suspended, the  Principal Investigator ( PI) will promptly inform study subject s and the 
Institutional Review Board ( IRB), will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension.  Study 
subjec ts will be contacted, as applicable, and be informed of changes to study visit schedule.  
  
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subject s 
• Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stopping    
• Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
• Determination that  the primary endpoint has been met  
• Determination of futility  
 
Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are addressed, 
and satisfy the IRB.  
8.1.3  CONFIDENTIALITY  AND PRIVACY   
Subject  confidentiality  and privacy is strictly held in trust by the participating investigators  and their 
staff. Therefore, the study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be 
held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the Principal Investigator.  
 All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible.  
 Representatives of the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) may inspect all documents and records required 
to be maintained by the investigator, including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy records for the subject s in this study. The clinical study site will permit access to 
such records.  
 The study subject ’s contact information will be securely stored at each clinical site for internal use 
during the study. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for as long a period as dictated by the reviewing IRB and/or  Institutional policies . 
 
Study subject  research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific reporting, will be 
stored at the UAB Department of Otolaryngology research office. This will not include the subject ’s 
contact or identifying information. Rather, individual subject s and their research data will be identified 
by a unique study identification number. The study data entry and study management systems used by 
research staff will be secured and password protected.  
 
8.1.4  QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL  
 Version 1.0 
 10OCT2020 
  11 The site will perform internal quality management of study conduct, data collection, documentation and 
completion.  Quality control ( QC) procedures will be completed by the Data Manager during data entry 
into the appropriate CRF. Any missing data or data anomalies will be communicated to the Study 
Coordinator for clarification/resolution.  
 Following written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the monitors will verify that the clinical trial is conducted and data are generated  are collected , documented (recorded), and reported in compliance 
with the protocol, International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP ), and 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
 The site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and inspection by local and regulatory author ities.
 
 
8.1.5  DATA  HANDLING  AND  RECORD  KEEPING   
 
8.1.5.1  DATA COLLECTION AND  MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the Principal Investigator. The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, 
legibility, and timeliness of the data reported . 
 All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation 
of data.   
 Hard  copies of source document  worksheets will be used for recording data for each subject  enrolled in 
the study.  Data record ed in the case report form ( CRF) derived from source documents should be 
consistent with the data recorded on the source documents .  
 
8.1.5.2  STUDY RECORDS RETENTION  
Study documents should be retained for a minimum of 3 years after the completion of the study . These 
documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by local regulations.  
 
8.1.6  PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol  requirements. The 
noncompliance may be either on the part of the subject , the investigator, or the study site staff. As a 
result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the site and implemented promptly.  
 These practices are consistent with ICH GCP :  
• 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
• 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1  
• 5.20 Noncompliance, sections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2.  
 It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to use continuous vigilance to identify and report 
deviations within 10 working days of identification of the protocol deviation.  Protocol deviations must 
be sent to the reviewing  Institutional Review Board (IRB)  per their policies.  The Principal Investigator  is 
responsible for knowing and adhering to the  reviewing IRB requirements.

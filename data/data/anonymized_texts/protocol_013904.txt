2.0 OBJECTIVES AND SCIENTIFIC AIMS  
The primary objective for this study is : 
1. To evaluate whether  romiplostim  can improve  the recovery of persistent, isolated Chemotherapy -
Induced Thrombocytopenia (CIT), to a platelet count >100,000 /mcL  within 3 weeks after initiation 
of therapy .  
 
Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives for this study are:  
 
1. In patients whose platelet counts have recovered within three weeks  on romiplostim treatment, we 
will observe for:  
a. Ability to resume at least two cycles (or eight weeks, whichever comes first) of 
chemotherapy without r ecurrence of chemotherapy -induced thrombocytopenia leading to 
chemotherapy dose delay or reduction.  
i. Note the duration of off -chemotherapy time.  
b. Change in chemotherapy for progression of disease or other cancer related conditions.  
c. Change in chemotherapy for other toxicities unrelated to thrombocytopenia.  
d. Censor patients who have tolerated chemotherapy with romiplostim support for up to 12 
months.  
e. Death due to all causes.  
2. The safety profile of  romiplostim will be  assessed in this patient population  at specified time -points 
during the course of study  as per section 11.0 Toxicities/Side Effects .   
 
3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 3.1   Chemotherapy -induced thrombocytopenia  
Chemotherapy -induced thrombocytopenia (CIT) is defined as a single hematopoietic lineage 
depression resulting in a low platelet count (< 100,000 /mcL) despite adequate recovery time 
from prior chemotherapy.  Not uncommonly, CIT can result in subsequent dose reductions and 
can adversely affect on time delivery of subsequent chemotherapy cycles.  In a retrospective 
series of 609 patients with solid tumors or lymphoma who exhibited CIT (platelets of 
<50,000/mcL), delay in subsequent chemotherapy occurred during 6% of cycles.  The CIT 
cohort used more resources, but outcomes were not impacted when compared to those who 
did not experience CIT1.  In the same report, dose reduction occurred in 15% of patients with 
CIT 1.  Current ly, the  management of CIT is supportive with pla telet transfusions  per the 
discretion of the treating medical oncologist .  Presently, there is no specific standard of care 
for CIT.  
 
 3.2 Romiplostim: Mechanism of action  
Romiplostim  (Npate ®) is a thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetic that is F ood and Drug Administration 
(FDA)  approved for use in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) 2.  
Romiplostim  bears no structural or biochemical resemblance to TPO, but mimics the TPO 
binding to the TPO receptor (Mpl). 3 Romiplostim is a ‘peptibody’ formed by the fusion of the 
Fc portion of an IgG1 monoclonal antibody with four TPO mimetic peptides.  Ro miplostim binds 
the distal cytokine homology region of the TPO receptor  leading to activation of the JAK/STAT 
pathway.  Simultaneously, romiplostim has been shown to engage the MAP kinase  pathway  
leading to activation of anti -apoptotic pathways resulting i n increased platelet production4,5.

   3.3   Romiplostim: Clinical activity  
Romiplostim has been shown to increase and maintain platelet c ounts in splenectomized and 
non-splenectomized patient with ITP with few adverse effects. 6  No anti -TPO antibody 
formation of clinical significance has been reported to date. 6  In several trials of patients with 
ITP, the mean  therapeutic dose of romiplostim to achieve a platelet count of 50-200,000/mcL  
was 3-4 mcg/kg . 5  
 
 
 3.4   Rationale for Romiplostim in CIT  
At MSKCC, Soff, Parameswaran, and Mantha  have treated over 50 patients with romiplos tim 
for CIT.  Our initial case series of 20 patients was published in 2014, indicating 19 of 20 treated 
patients meeting the goal of normalization of platelet count to >100,000/mcL (Parameswaran 
et al, 2014).  
Our interim  observations of this  current  clinical trial suggest s that romiplostim is effective and 
safe to improve platelet counts in patients with CIT. Of the treatment patients, 13 of the 14 
(93%) romiplostim patients normalized their platelet count within the three -week primary 
endpoint. From our i nitial 21 patients who enrolled on this trial, 1 out of 7 (14.3%) observation 
patients have corrected her platelet counts within 3 weeks. (P= 0.0009 by two -tailed Fisher’s 
Exact Test). Of the 5 observation patients who crossed over to romiplostim and were 
evaluable, all 5 corrected their platelet count within 3 weeks. Of all patients receiving 
romiplostim, 18 of 19 patients (95%) reach platelet counts of 100,000/mcL or greater within 3 
weeks of treatment. No patients who resumed chemotherapy while receiving  romiplostim 
(N=14) had a recurrence of CIT. We continue to see efficacy and safety within our patients 
currently on romiplostim. Based on highly significant efficacy and no further spontaneous 
correction of platelets , it was felt inappropriate to continue  randomizing to the observation 
control arm.  
No toxicity attributable to the romiplostim  has been observed in our initial cases.  Three  of the 
initial 20 courses of treatment (19 patients) developed deep vein thrombosis  which is within 
the historical range of between 10% and 30%  7 in comparable patients with metastatic cancer 
on chemotherapy.  Further, one of t he two patients with DVT had a previous history of DVT , 
prior to initiation of romiplostim , and had been off anticoagulation when the second thrombosis 
occurred.  
 
4.0 OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
4.1 Design  
Primary objective : 
This is a n intent -to-treat multicenter  phase II open label trial .  Once appropriate patients are 
identified and enrolled, 60 patients  will be  enrolled.   
 
During the initial 3 -week period, the enrolled patients  will receive romiplostim , titrated a s per 
protocol (Section 9.0).   Assessment for the  primary endpoint will take place at week 3 and 
denote  the proportion  of patients that achieves a  platelet count of >100,000/mcL  within 3 weeks 
of initiation .  
 
Safety Analysis  will be performed  at specified time -points (Section 11.0 To xicities/Side Effects)  
including  possible adverse events such as thrombosis,  peripheral blood abnormalities and 
evidence of organ dysfunction .  
 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 13-132 A(20) 
Approval date: 29-Jun-2021 
 
  Secondary objective:  
 
In patients whose platelet counts have recovered within three weeks , we will observe  for 
patient’s ability to receive two cycles (or eight weeks, whichever comes first) of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy without recurrence of chemotherapy -induced thrombocytopenia leading to 
chemo therapy dose delay or reduction; c hange in chemotherapy for progression of  disease or 
other cancer related conditions ; change in chemotherapy for other toxicitie s unrelated to 
thrombocytopenia; and death due to all causes.  The duration for patients off -chemotherapy 
will also be noted. In addition we are also c ensor ing patients w ho have tolerated chemotherapy 
with romiplostim support for up to 12 months.  
 
Safety endpoints will include possible adverse events such as thrombosis, evidence of marrow 
toxicity, and evidence of organ dysfunction.   
 
4.2 Intervention  
I.  Initial Phase o f Study: Intervention For Primary Endpoint.  
 
Romiplostim, n= 60.   
All patients will  begin weekly romiplostim at 2 mcg/kg, subcutaneously.  The romiplostim dose 
will be titrated as per Section 9.0, based on weekly CBC/platelet counts.  For titration purposes, 
the target platelet count is 150,000 -200,000/mcL.   
 
II.  Maintenance romiplostim , During Resumed Chemotherapy/Secondary Efficacy Endpoint  
 
All patients on romiplostim who achieve a platelet count  adequate ( >100,000 /mcL ) and resume  
chemotherapy  will be followed with continuation of weekly, titrate d romiplostim .   
 
In patients whose platelet counts have recovered within three weeks , we are observing for 
ability to resume 2 cycles (or eight weeks, whichever comes first) of cytotoxic chemotherapy 
without recurrence of chemotherapy -induced thrombocytopenia leading to chemo therapy dose 
delay or reduction; c hange in chemotherapy for progression of disease or o ther cancer related 
conditions ; change in chemotherapy for other toxicitie s unrelated to thrombocytopenia; and 
death due to all causes.  The duration for patients off chemotherapy will be noted. In addition 
we are also c ensor ing patients who have tolerated chemotherapy with romiplostim support for 
up to 12 months.  
 
Patients who are  benefitting  from the romiplostim, will be able to remain on treatment beyond 
the completion of  12 months on study , at the discretion of their oncologist and the study 
participati ng hematologist.   
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS  
Romiplostim, a member of the TPO mimetic class, is an Fc -peptide fusion protein (peptibody) that 
activates intracellular transcriptional pathways leading to increased platelet production via the TPO 
receptor (also known as  cMpl). The peptibody molecule contains two identical single -chain subunits, 
each consisting of human immunoglobulin IgG1 Fc domain, covalently linked at the C -terminus to a 
peptide containing two thrombopoietin receptor -binding doma ins. Romiplostim has no amino acid 
sequence homology to endogenous TPO. Romiplostim is produced by recombinant DNA technology 
in Escherichia coli (E coli) . 
 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 13-132 A(20) 
Approval date: 29-Jun-2021 
 
  Romiplostim is approximately 59 kilodalton and is comprised of 4 Mpl -binding domains and an Fc 
fragment. The peptibody is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli (E coli). 
Though it has no amino acid sequence homology to endogenous thrombopoietin (eTPO), 
romiplostim is an agonist of the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor and signals and ac tivates 
intracellular transcriptional pathways to increase platelet production.  
  
Romiplostim is supplied as a sterile, preservative -free lyophilized white powder ready for 
reconstitution. It is supplied for single use in 5 cc Type I glass vials containing  625 μg of romiplostim, 
500 μg deliverable drug product. When reconstituted with the appropriate volume of sWFI, 
romiplostim is at a concentration of 0.5  mg/mL in 10 mM histidine, 4% (w/v) mannitol, 2% (w/v) 
sucrose, and 0.004% (w/v) polysorbate 20 at a pH  of 5.0. The product, when reconstituted, is a clear 
colorless solution practically free from particles.  
  
Prior to administration, romiplostim is reconstituted in the vial to 0.5 mg/mL (1.2 ml of sWFI is added 
to vials containing 625 μg (500 μg) of romipl ostim), and drawn into a syringe for subcutaneous 
injection.  
  
Romiplostim vials will be stored in their carton to protect from light until the time of use.   Keep 
romiplostim vials refrigerated at 2°to 8°C (36° to 46°F).   Do not freeze .  
A. Romiplostim is an FDA approved drug, approved for the indication of chronic immune 
(idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).  The investigators Brochure, provided by Amgen, 
is attached as Appendix C.  The product insert is also provided as Appendix B. 
 
B. Relevant statements from the Product Insert:

existing referral patterns to the Hematology Service.   
 
After the consultation and results  of the cytogenetics and FISH , if a patient qualif ies for the trial, the 
consult ing hematolog ist will discuss the possibility of participation in the study. If consent is offered, 
the risks:  benefits will be presented to the patient by an investigator  prior to the patient consenting . If 
the patient consents, they will be enrolled by a study RSA (see section 15.1). Similar recruitment 
procedures will be followed at participating institutions.

9.0 TREATMENT/ INTERV ENTION  PLAN  
I. Initial Phase of Study: Intervention For Primary Endpoint.  Romiplostim, n= 60 .  
  
A. Patients will begin weekly romiplostim treatment at 2 mcg/kg, subcutaneously.   
 
B. Weekly CBC , comprehensive chemistry panel, LDH, PT, and aPTT  will be performed, (as 
well as monitoring laboratory tests)  for the first 3 weeks on treatment .   
The romiplostim  dose will be titrated by a study investigator . 
The target platelet count for romiplostim dose titration is 150,000/mcL .  A platelet count of 
≥100,000 /mcL is the threshold for successful response  and the range of acceptable platelet Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 13-132 A(20) 
Approval date: 29-Jun-2021 
 
  counts is 100 -200k/mcL. These target platelet values have been used by investigators s ince 
the opening of this trial. L anguage specifying exact values was added in Amendment 16.  
In the initial 3  successive week s, the weekly romiplostim  dose will be increased by 1 mcg/kg, 
until the platelet count 100,000 -200,000 /mcL .  With romiplostim  dose escalation, if the 
platelet count reaches ≥100,000 /mcL , (adequate to resume che motherapy), but not 
≥150,000 /mcL , the dose of romiplostim will not be escalated above  5 mcg/kg.  
The dose of romiplostim may be modified at the discretion of the study investigator in 
consultation with the PI. Smaller dose increment (or decreases) may be ne eded to titrate the 
platelet cou nt to the 10 0,000 - 200,000/ mcL target.  
C. 3 Week: Primary Endpoint.  
The anticipated recovery of the platelets is within 3 weeks of initiation of romiplostim .  The 
initial endpoint will be at 3 weeks . 
The proportion of patient s who have achieved a platelet count of ≥100,000 /mcL within 3 
weeks,  (adequate to resume chemotherapy ) and the  weekly  absolute platelet counts are 
recorded.  
 
II. Maintenance Romiplostim, During Resumed Chemotherapy/Secondary Efficacy Endpoint  
 
A. All patients who achieve an adequate platelet count to resume chemotherapy 
(>100,000/mcL) and resume chemotherapy will be followed with continuation of weekly, 
titrated romiplostim. If the patient receives romiplostim therapy for ≥12 months, the 
scheduling of routine labs and treatment dosing will be at the discretion of the investigator.   
 
B. The secondary endpoint will be documented for patients whose platelet counts have 
recovered within three weeks. We will observe for ability to resume 2 cycles (or eight week s, 
whichever comes first) of cytotoxic chemotherapy without recurrence of chemotherapy -
induced thrombocytopenia leading to chemotherapy dose delay or reduction; change in 
chemotherapy for progression of disease or other cancer related conditions; change in  
chemotherapy for other toxicities unrelated to thrombocytopenia; and death due to all 
causes. The duration for patients off chemotherapy will be noted. In addition we are also 
censoring patients who have tolerated chemotherapy with romiplostim support for  up to 12 
months.  
 
C. Romiplostim dose titration.  After resumption of full -dose chemotherapy, the romiplostim 
dose can be further titrated based on platelet count at beginning of each chemotherapy 
cycle.  The dose adjustments are from the prior week’s romip lostim dose.  The below dose 
titration refers to the initial 2 cycles of resumed chemotherapy as well as the continuation 
phase for patients who successfully complete the study through  2 cycles.  
1. The target platelet count, at initiation of a cycle of chemotherapy is 10 0,000 -
200,000 /mcL .   
2. If the pre -chemotherapy cycle platelet count is >200,000 /mcL , the romiplostim dose will 
be reduced by 0.5 mcg/kg.   
3. If the pre -chemotherapy cycle platelet count is >250,000 /mcL , the romiplostim dose will 
be reduced by  1.0 mcg/kg  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 13-132 A(20) 
Approval date: 29-Jun-2021 
 
  4. If the pre -chemotherapy cycle platelet count is <100,000 /mcL , the romiplostim dose will 
be increased by 1.0 mcg/kg.   
5. The dose of romiplostim may be rounded off to the nearest 50 mcg.  
6. The dose of romiplostim may be modified at the discretion of  the study investigator in 
consultation with the MSKCC P.I. S maller dose increments (or decreases) may be 
needed to titrate the platelet count to the 1 00,000 -200,000 /mcL  target.   
III.  Discontinuation of Romiplostim.  
A. Discontinuation of Cancer Therapy.  Af ter the 3 week period of the initial endpoint is reached, 
if the treating medical oncologist discontinues chemotherapy or switches to a cancer therapy 
not associated with thrombocytopenia, the romiplostim may be discontinued.   
 
B. If a patient develops a Gra de 3/4 adverse event, attributable to Romiplostim, based on the 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), the Romiplostim will be 
discontinued.  
 
C. If a patient develops a symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism, not 
associate d with hemodynamic instability, and not considered life -threatening, the romiplostim 
may be continued if there is consensus of judgment of the treating oncologist and study 
investigator.  
 
 
 
10.0 EVALUATION DURING TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
Patients will come for visits to the study -center /hematologist on a weekly basis during the study.  
The intervals of the weekly visits will be 7 +/ - 2 days.  These visits will be for the purpose of 
monitoring the safety and efficacy of the romiplostim intervention, as well a s to allow for further dose 
titration. Treatment can be held up to 16 days if a patient develops an intercurrent medical illness or   
symptom that is unrelated to study drug therapy. Treatment may be held up to 20 days if the patient 
is unavailable for non -medical reasons, such as vacation or travel.  
For the first 3 weeks on treatment, patients will receive weekly CBC, COMP, LDH, PT, and aPTT. 
During consecutive weeks, CBC s will be obtained weekly, for the purpose of monitoring the platelet 
recovery and to allow for further dose titration.  On ce per month (30 days +/ - 10 days),, comprehensive 
metabolic panel (see above for itemization ), LDH, Prothrombin Time, and activated  Partial 
Thromboplastin Time will be monitored . If at any time the automated hematology analyzer flags 
possible morphological abnormalities, peripheral smears will be ordered f or further analyze  in order to 
monitor the platelet recovery and continue dose titration.   
 
Patients who remain on romiplostim for 4 or more months, will undergo bone marrow aspirate and 
biopsy, or peripheral bl ood test, with reticulin stain, cytogenetics, and FISH panel for MDS, in the 30 
day period after completion of the 4th month.  
 
Patients will have a CBC performe d within 1 -4 weeks after  the last dose of romiplostim.   
 
11.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE EFFECTS  
Based on our initial experience, we have not observed treatment -related toxicities in our first 40+ 
patients.  Based on the romiplostim Prescribing Information, t he most common adverse Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 13-132 A(20) 
Approval date: 29-Jun-2021 
 
  reactions (≥ 5% higher pati ent incidence in romiplostim  versus placebo) are arthralgia, dizziness, 
insomnia, myalgia, pain in extremity, abdominal pain, shoulder pain, dyspepsia, and 
paresthesia.    
Individual cases of thrombosis and been reported in patients receiving romiplostim, b ut in one 
recent review of long -term use of romiplostim, “T he thrombotic adverse event rate  across all 
studies was 0.09 events per 100 patient -weeks on  romiplostim therapy ,”8 markedly lower than 
would expected in patients with active cancer receiving chemotherapy. We have not observed 
an increased thrombosis rate compared with expected rates in patients with metastatic cancer, 
on chemotherapy, however, we will monit or any clinical evidence of thrombosis as well as 
hemorrhage.  
Assessment of potential toxicity wi ll be based on the Common Terminology Criteria for  Adverse 
Events (CTCAE)  Version 4.0 .  We will monitor for evidence of marrow toxicity, with weekly CBC  
(CBC must include: WBC, Hgb, platelet, MCV, cell differential)  and lab toxicities of grade 3/4 will 
be adjudicated on a regular basis by the PI or Co -PI of the study.  In addition, cytogenetics testing 
through  bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood  will be performed within 30 days after the 
completion of the 4th month on treatment.  
Patients will be monitored for Adverse Events throughout the study  at the following time points:  
Toxicity Assessments will be completed a t 3-weeks from enrollment (3-weeks from  initiation of 
romiplostim in cross -over patients), and every 3 months while on romiplostim. A final toxicity 
assessment will be completed 1  month   after the last dose of romiplostim . However, if the patient 
is discontinuing chemotherapy and going to hospice/ comfort care, the final toxicity assessment 
will be omitted if toxicities were managed regularly. For purposes of toxicity assessment, 3 
months will be defined as 90 days +/ - 15 days, 1 month is defined as 30 days +/ - 15 days, and 
3 weeks will be defined as 21 days + 9 days .  
The study will report only those toxicities  that are not known to be linked to the patient’s prior 
chemotherapy treatment or underl ying disease. All toxicitie s meeting this criteria should be reported 
to MSK CC as an Adverse Event in CRDBi -Multicenter with supporting source documentation.  
 
12.0    CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
The primary therapeutic response is assessed by the platelet count within  3 weeks of treatment.   
1. Achievement of platelet counts of >100,000 /mcL  in patients who receive  romiplostim will serve as 
the primary endpoint.  
 
The secondary therapeutic response endpoints are:  
For patients who successfully achieve platelet counts of >100,000/mcL, and resume 
chemotherapy, we will observe the:  
1. Ability to resume two cycles (or eight weeks, whichever comes first) of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy without recurrence of che motherapy -induced thrombocytopenia leading to 
delay or dose reduction in chemotherapy.  
a. Dose reduction/ delay for pancytopenia or drop in hemoglobin or neutrophil count will 
not count.  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 13-132 A(20) 
Approval date: 29-Jun-2021 
 
  b. The day of chemotherapy dose delay/ reduction will be considered the s econdary 
endpoint.  
c. Duration of the off-chemotherapy time will be recorded.  
2. Change in chemotherapy for progression of disease or other cancer related conditions.  
a. The start of a new chemotherapy is the day that will be considered the secondary 
endpoint.   
3. Change in chemotherapy for other toxicities unrelated to thrombocytopenia.  
a. The start of a new chemotherapy is th e day that will be considered the secondary 
endpoint.  
4. Censoring  patients who have tolerated chemotherapy with romiplostim support for 12 
months .  
 
13.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY  
Treatment will continue until the occurrence of any of the following events:  
 Continuation is no longer in the patient’s best interest as determined by the patient ’s oncologist.  
 Patient withdraws consent  
 Death  
 Lost to  follow -up 
 Major violation of study protocol , such as non -compliance . 
 Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the Investigator or treating oncologist, may cause 
severe or permanent harm or which rule out continuation of the trial.  
 Discontinuation of chemotherapy for reason other than CIT.  If the patient is discontinuing 
chemotherapy regimen and beginning a different regimen, the patient may remain on study.  
 Note: (Patients on romiplostim who fail to achieve ≥100,000/mcL within the first 3 weeks of 
treatment are considered a primary treatment failure. However, patients can continue on 
treatment per protocol if the treating physician believes the patient will benefit for secondary 
endpoints.)  
 
 
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS  
This study was originally designed as a phase II randomized study where patients were randomized 
2:1 to respectively receive romiplostim and observational control.  The primary endpoint was the 
achievement of a platelet count of ≥ 100,000/mcL within th ree w eeks of study enrollment, and a ny 
patient removed from study during  evaluation  window without count recovery  was considered a 
treatment failure.  Based on earlier MSKCC  data, it was estimated that the probability of a success in 
the romiplostim arm is at le ast 90%, while the probability of a spontaneous recovery in the  control arm 
is 60% or less.  
 
Due to preliminary trial results, the protocol was amended on 4/13/2016 and the observation control 
arm was dropped. At that point, the study became a single arm phase II study of romiplostim. The 
sections below represent the new single arm study design.   
 
Analysis of these data will only be done with 60 evaluable  patients enrolled on the trial. There was 
one patient enrolled during this time who was inevaluable an d therefore there were 61 patients 
enrolled for 60 spots.  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 13-132 A(20) 
Approval date: 29-Jun-2021 
 
   
Primary endpoint : 
This study is a single arm phase II design to evaluate romiplostim  mediated  improve ments in  platelet  
counts in patients who have experienced CIT.  The primary endpoint is the achi evement of a platelet 
count of ≥ 100,000 /mcL  within three weeks of study enrollment.  Any patient who is removed from 
study before the evaluation of the primary endpoint will be considered a treatment failure.   A total of 
sixty patients will be  enrolled  and treated with romiplostim . Based on preliminary MSKCC  data, it is 
estimated that the probability of a success in  patients on  romiplostim  treatment  is at least 90% . 
Therefore, we will consider the trial promising and worthy of further intervention if at lea st 54 out of 60 
achieve platelet  count recovery. The operating  characteristics of this design rule are provided in the 
table below.  
 True Rate of Count Recovery  
Probability of   
Observin g >= 54/60  0.85 0.875  0.9 0.925  0.95 
17% 40% 60% 81% 97% 
 
Secondary endpoints : 
Patients who achieve a platelet recovery may be allowed to resume chemotherapy.  In these patients, 
we are observing for recurrence of chemotherapy -induced thrombocytopenia leading to chemo therapy 
dose delay or reduction; c hange in che motherapy for progression of disease or other cancer related 
conditions ; change in chemotherapy for other toxicities unrelated to thrombocytopenia ; and death due 
to all causes .  
 
Lastly, the frequency of thrombosis, marrow toxicity, and organ dysfunction w ill be tabulated.

  16.1.1  Quality Assurance for Participating Sites  
 
Each site ac cruing participants to this protocol will be audited by the staff of the MSK study 
team for protocol and regulatory compliance, data verification and source documentation.  
 
Audits will be conducted annually during the study (or more frequently if indicated ) and at the 
end or closeout of the trial. Ideally the first audit will occur shortly after the first patients are 
enrolled. The number of participants audited will be determined by auditor availability and the 
complexity of the protocol. Each audit will b e summarized and a final report will be sent to the 
PI at the audited participating site within 30 days of the audit.  
 
 16.1. 1 Response Review  
 
Since therapeutic efficacy is a stated primary objective, participant’s responses are subject to 
review by MSKCC’s Therapeutic Response Review Committee (TRRC).  Radiology, additional 
lab reports and possibly bone marrow biopsies and/or aspirates will be  submitted  for MSKCC 
TRRC review and confirmation of response assessment.  
 
16.2 Data and Safety Monitoring  
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan Kettering were approved by 
the National Cancer Institute in August 2018. The plans address the new policies set forth by 
the NCI in the document entitled “ Policy of the National Cancer Institute for Data and Safety 
Monitoring of Clinical Trials .”  
There are several different mechanisms by which clinical studies are monitored for data, 
safety and quality. At a departmental/PI  level there exists procedures for quality control by 
the research team(s). Institutional processes in place for quality assurance include protocol 
monitoring, compliance and data verification audits, staff education on clinical research QA 
and two institu tional committees that are responsible for monitoring the activities of our 
clinical trials programs. The committees: Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) for 
Phase I and II clinical trials, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for Phase III 
clinical trials, report to the Deputy Physician -in-Chief, Clinical Research.  
The degree of monitoring required will be determined based on level of risk and documented.  
The MSK DSMB monitors phase III trials and the DSMC monitors non -phase III trials.  The 
DSMB/C have oversight over the following trials:  
 MSK Investigator Initiated Trials (IITs; MSK as sponsor)  
 External studies where MSK is the data coordinating center  
 Low risk studies identified as requiring DSMB/C review  
The DSMC will initiate review following the enrollment of the first participant/or by the end of 
the year one if no accruals and will continue for the study lifecycle until there are no participants 
under active therapy and the protocol has closed to accrual. The DSMB will initiate rev iew once 
the protocol is open to accrual

17.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting  
  
 
SAE reporting is required  as soon as the participant signs consent .  SAE reporting is 
required for 30 -days after the participant’s last investigational treatment or intervention. Any 
events that occur after the 30 -day period and that are at least possibly related to protocol 
treatment must be reported . 
 
If an SAE requires submission to the IRB office per IRB SOP RR -408 ‘Reporting of Serious 
Adverse Events’, the SAE report must be sent to the IRB within 5  calendar days  of the event . 
The IRB requires a Clinical Research Database (CRDB) SAE report be submitted 
electronically to the SAE Office as follows:   
 
For all other tri als: Reports that include a Grade 5 SAE should be sent to 
saegrade5@mskcc.org .  All other reports should be sent to sae@mskcc.org . 
The report should  contain the following information:  
Fields populated from CRDB:  
 Subject’s initials  
 Medical record number  
 Disease/histology (if applicable)  
 Protocol number and title  
Data needing to be entered:  
 The date the adverse event occurred  
 The adverse event  
 The grade  of the event  
 Relationship of the adverse event to the treatment (drug, device, or intervention)  
 If the AE was expected  
 The severity of the AE

Approval date: 29-Jun-2021 
 
  o A explanation of how the AE was handled  
o A description  of the subject’s condition  
o Indication if the subject remains on the study  
 If an amendment will need to be made to the protocol and/or consent form  
 If the SAE is an Unanticipated Problem  
The PI’s signature and the date it was signed are required on the co mpleted report.  
 
 
 17.2.1  Report SAEs to Amgen by MSKCC  
The MSKCC research staff must inform Amgen , Inc.  of any SAE as soon as possible but no 
later than 5 calendar days  of the MSKCC principal  investigator becoming aware of the event.  
Participating sites should submit SAEs to MSKCC as indicated in section 17.3 and MSKCC 
will report these events to Amgen as appropriate. Participating sites should not  submit SAEs 
directly to Amgen. All SAE’s will be reported up to 30 days after the last d ose of treatment.  
 
Definitions  
Adverse Event Definition  
Adverse event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence(s) in a patient/subject 
attributed to a pharmaceutical product. ( The untoward medical occurrence does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. )  An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether 
or not it is related to the medicinal product.  This includes any newly occurring event, or a 
previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of 
study drug.  
 
Serious Adverse Event Definition  
Serious adverse event (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death.  
 Is life -threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the time 
of the event.  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe).  
 Requires inpatient hospitalization , with the exception of a planned procedure .  
 Requires  prolongation of an existing hospitalization .  
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  (Disability is defined as a 
substantial dis ruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 Is a medically important event.  This refers to an AE that may not result in death, be 
immediately life threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be considered serious 
when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient, require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or 
involves suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent.    Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 13-132 A(20) 
Approval date: 29-Jun-2021 
 
  Clarification should be made between the terms serious  and severe  because they ARE NOT 
the s ame.  The term severe  is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may 
be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe headache).  T his is NOT the 
same as serious , which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria described above 
and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning.  A 
severe AE does not necessarily need to be considered serious.  For example, persistent 
nausea of several hours duration may be considered severe nausea but may not be 
considered an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke resulting in only a minor degree of disability 
may be considered mild but would be defined as an SAE based on the above noted criteria.  
Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
17.3 SAE Reporting for Participating Sites  
Responsibilities of Participating Sites  
 Participating sites are responsible fo r reporting all SAEs to their local IRB per local 
guidelines. Local IRB SAE approvals/acknowledgements must be sent to MSK upon 
receipt.  
 Participating sites are responsible for submitting the SAE Report form found in MSK’s 
internet based Clinical Research Database to MSK within 3 calendar days of learning of 
the event.  
 When a death i s unforeseen and indicates participants or others are at increased risk of 
harm, participating sites should notify the MSK PI as soon as possible but within 24 hours 
of the time  the site becomes aware of the event.  
 
SAE contact information:  
Email: medmctcore@mskcc.org  to the attention of 13 -132 Research Staff  
 
AND 
 
Email: wilkinsc @mskcc.org  
 
 Responsibilities of MSK  
 MSK Research Staff are responsible for submitting all SAEs to the MSK IRB/PB as 
specified in 17.2 and to Amgen as described in 17.2.1  
 The MSK PI is responsible for informing all participating sites about all unexpected 
SAEs that are either possibly, probably, or definitely r elated to the study intervention 
within 30 days of receiving the stamped SAE from the MSK IRB/PB  
 The MSK PI is responsible for informing all participating sites within 24 hours or on 
the next business day about a death that is unforeseen and indicates part icipants or 
others are at increased risk of harm.  
 
 17.5     Safety Reports  
 
MSK must submit external safety reports to the MSK IRB/PB according to institutional 
guidelines. All external safety reports will be made available to the participating sites. For  
those safety reports that require an amendment, the participating sites will receive a special 
alert.  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

Participating sites are responsible for submitting safety reports to their local IRB per their 
local IRB guidelines. All local IRB approvals/acknowledgments of safety reports must be sent 
to MSK upon receipt.  
 
18.0 INFORMED CONSENT PROCEDURES  
Before protocol -specified procedures are carried out, consenting professionals will explain full details 
of the protocol and study procedures as  well as the risks involved to participants prior to their inclusion 
in the study. Participants will also be informed that they are free to withdraw from the study at any 
time. All participants must sign an IRB/PB -approved consent form indicating their con sent to 
participate. This consent form meets the requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations and the 
Institutional Review Board/Privacy Board of this Center. The consent form will include the following:  
1. The nature and objectives, potential risks and be nefits of the intended study.  
2. The length of study and the likely follow -up required.  
3. Alternatives to the proposed study. (This will include available standard and investigational 
 therapies. In addition, patients will be offered an option of supportive ca re for therapeutic 
 studies.)  
4. The name of the investigator(s) responsible for the protocol.  
5. The right of the participant to accept or refuse study interventions/interactions and to 
 withdraw from participation at any time.  
Before any protocol -specific pro cedures can be carried out, the consenting professional will fully 
explain the aspects of patient privacy concerning research specific information.  In addition to signing 
the IRB Informed Consent, all patients must agree to the Research Authorization comp onent of the 
informed consent form.  
Each participant and consenting professional will sign the consent form. The participant must receive 
a copy of the signed informed consent form.  
 
 
 
18.1 Informed Consent Procedures for Participating Sites  
 
The investigators listed on the Consenting Professionals Lists at each participating site may obtain 
informed consent and care for the participants according to good clinical practice and protocol 
guidelines.  
 
A note will be place in the medical record documenting that informed consent was obtained for this 
study, and that the participant acknowledges the risk of participation.

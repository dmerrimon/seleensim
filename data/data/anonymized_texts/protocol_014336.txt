Study Treatment Ponatinib
Study Title A Randomized, Open -label, Phase 2 Trial of Ponatinib in Patients with Resistant 
Chro nic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia to Characterize the Efficac y and Safety  
of a Range of Doses
Phase Phase 2
Eligible Population Patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP -CML) who have received 
at least two prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies and have demonstrated 
resistance to treatment or have the T315I mutation
Summary and Study 
RationalePonatinib is a novel, synthetic, orally active TKI specifically designed to optimally 
inhibit native BCR -ABL.  It is also active against mutated forms of the protein that 
can arise during treatment with other TKIs and cause resistance, including the T315I 
gatekeeper mutant.  The latter confers uniform resistance to all other available BCR -
ABL inhibitors ( e.g., imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib).  Ponatinib 
(Iclusig®, ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ) is approved in the United States (US) for 
the treatment of adult patients with chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase 
chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) or Philadelphia chromosome positive acute 
lymphoblas tic leukemia ( Ph+ ALL) for whom no other TKI therapy is indicated and 
for treatment of adult patients with T315I -positive CML (chronic phase, accelerated 
phase, o r blast phase) or T315I -positive Ph+ ALL.   In the European Union (EU), 
ponatinib is approved f or the treatment of adult patients with CML ( chronic phase, 
accelerated phase, or blast phase ) and Ph+ ALL who are resistant to dasatinib (or 
nilotinib for CML), w ho are intolerant to dasatinib (or nilotinib for CML), and for 
whom subsequent treatment with imatinib is not clinically appropriate, or who have 
the T315I mutation.
The phase 2 clinical trial of ponatinib in patients with CML orPh+ ALL who have 
hadprior TKI therapy (AP24534 -10-201, PACE), which supported the drug’s 
approvals, tested a starting dose of 45 mg daily. The 5 -year data from this study 
confirmed that treatment with ponatinib continued to provide clinically meaningful 
responses.  In patients with CP -CML, the primary endpoint was met in more than 
double that of the most recent dasatinib or nilotinib therapy (55.4% vs. 25.8%) and 
85.7% remained in the primary endpoint for ≥550 days at 30 mg. The median 
duration of follow -up was 37.3 months. Continuing analyses of the phase 2 trial have 
demonstrated a higher cumulative incidence of arterial occlusive events (including 
cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular events) observed with a 
longer follow -up, than reported at the time of the initial approval.   Arterial occlusive 
events (AOEs) —including fatal myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, severe peripheral 
vascular disease, and the need for urgent revascularization procedures —have been 
reported in ponatinib -
treated patients.
Current data suggest that a dose -effect relatio nship exists with efficacy and with the

05October 2020 Page 8of 113occurrence of AOEs, and that a lower daily dose may reduce the incidence of AOEs .  
This clinical study will assess the relationships ofexposure with efficacy and safety: 
patients will receive a range of initial doses ,and at defined time poin ts, patients in 
response will undergo a dose reduction.  The goal of the study will thus be to 
understand induction of responses, maintenance of responses, safety, and exposure -
response as consequences of these dosing strategies.
The primary endpoint of th is study will be the achievement of ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISat 
12 months. This incorporates standard CML approaches to patient care and uses 
patient monitoring. Increasingly, patient monitoring is being performed by 
quantitation of BCR -ABL1 transcripts from a stan dard established by the 
internatio nal scale (IS) (Mar in, 2014 ; NCCN, 2014 ; Baccarani et al, 2013 ; Marin et 
al, 2012; Lauseker et al, 2012 ; Saglio et al, 2012 ).  
This trial is being conducted in fulfillment of a Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) post -
marketing requirement (PMR2113 -6).
Study Design This is a multi -center, randomized phase 2 trial to characterize the safety and 
efficacy of ponatinib over a range of 3 starting doses.  Eligible patients must have 
CP-CML; have received at least 2 prior TKI therapies and have demonstrated 
resistance to treatment or have the T315I mutation.  
Patients w ill be randomized to receive once -daily  oral administration of 1 of 3 
starting doses of ponatinib: 45 mg (Cohort A), 30 mg (Cohort B), or 15 mg (Cohort 
C).  Patients starting at 45 mg or 30 mg will have their daily dose reduced to 15 mg 
upon achievement of ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS, as defined in Section 14.1.3 .
The study  will consist of an initial 24 -cycle Main Treatment Period; additionally, the 
study includes an optional Treatment Continuation Period.  All randomized patients 
will enter the Main Treatment Period and will remain on treatment in the Main 
Treatment Period until the occurrence of at least one of the following: absence of 
complete hematologic response (CHR) by 3 months, absence of major cytogenetic 
response (MCyR) at 12 months, absenc e of ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISat 12 months, loss of 
≤1% BCR -ABL1ISasdefined in Section 16.5.1.1 , development of intolerance, or 
completion of all 24 cycl es of treatment (whichever occurs first). Patients who 
achieve ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISat any  time point undergo dose reduction, and then lose 
≤1% BCR -ABL1ISare candidates for dose re -escalatio n to their starting dose, as 
described in Section 14.1.4 .
Following completion of the 24- month Main Treatment Period or following early 
withdrawal from the Main Treatment Period befo re completing all 24 cycles of the 
Main Treatment Period, patients w ho are both tolerating ponatinib treatment and 
receiving clinical benefit from treatment may enter into an optional Treatment 
Continuation Period upon discussion and agreement between the investigator and 
medical monitor.  Examples of clinical benefit that could allow a patient to enter the 
Treatment Continuation Period include (but are not limited to) a reduction from 
baseline in BCR -ABLISlevels (but without meeting the protocol -defined r esponse 
criterion of ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISat 12 months), an improvement in hematologic 
parameters (but without meeting the protocol -defined response criterion of CHR by 
3 mo nths), o r a BCR -ABLISlevel indicative of clinical benefit (but that is > 1%, 
after loss of ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISat an earlier time point).  Each patient may remain 
on study  treatment during the Treatment Continuation Period until the patient stops 
receiving clinical benefit or experiences unacceptable toxicity, or until the study is 
terminated by the sponsor (whichever occurs first).  Section 12describes follow -up 
and data collection for such continuation patients.  Section 10.4 provides more detail 
about the study design including descriptions of the Main Treatment and Treatment

The trial will assess hematologic response, cytogenetic response, and molecular 
response—as well as characteristics of efficacy, including time to and duration of responses—both by starting dose and after dose reduction.  AE rates and the rates of AOEs and venous thrombotic/embolic events (VTEs), in particular, will be measured.  Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) data will also be collected and analyzed.  Assessments will be performed according to standard international criteria.  The duration of patient participation will vary by patient depending on clinical benefit and toxicity.  Each dose cohort will be analyzed separately for efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK).
Study Objectives Primary Objective:
To characterize the efficacy of ponatinib administered in 3 starting doses (45 mg, 
30 mg, and 15 mg daily) in patients with CP-CML who are resistant to prior TKI therapy or have T315I mutation, as measured by ≤1% BCR-ABL1

Approximate Number of 
PatientsThe total enrollment will be 276 patients, with 92 (1:1:1) patients in each cohort. 
Approximate Duration of 
Patient Pa rticipationThe duration of patient participation will be approximately 24 months for all patients 
in the Main Treatment Period, with an option for patients completing or 
discontinuing from the Main Treatment Period who are still receiving clinical benefit
from treatment to enter a Treatment Continuation Period after discussion and 
agreement between the investigator and medical monitor.  Each patient will undergo 
a period of up to 3 weeks for screening prior to treatment. The duration of therapy 
will be det ermined by each patient’s response and toxicity profile, and patients may 
remain on ponatinib in the study if the benefit -risk profile remains favorable.  
Patients will be followed for 30 days after last dose of study drug.
Approximate Duration of 
StudyThe estimated duration of the trial is at least 60 months, including 36 months for 
enrollment and 24 months of treatment/follow -up in the Main Treatment Period.  
The total duration of therapy, and therefore of the study, will be determined by each 
patient’s response and toxicity profile; the study will continue until all patients have 
been discontinued from the study or the study is terminated by the sponsor 
(whichever occurs first).

Study CentersApproximately 150 centers; multi -natio nal. 
Dosage and 
AdministrationPatients will be randomized to receive once -daily  oral administration of 1 of 3 
starting doses of ponatinib: 45 mg (Cohort A), 30 mg (Cohort B), or 15 mg (Cohort 
C).  Patients starting at 45 mg or 30 mg will have their daily dose reduced to 15 mg 
upon achievement of ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS(as defined within the protocol). 
Mandatory dose reduction on response details are described in Section 14.1.3 . 
Dose interruptions or reductions should be implemented for patients who experience 
treatment -related AEs (TRAEs) upon clinical judgment of the investigator.  
Guidelines for management of TRAEs are described in Section 14.2.2 . 
Concomitant Treatment Medical or surgical treatment necessary for the patient’s well -being is perm itted.  
Where appropriate, patients may be treated with hematopoietic growth factors for 
limited times.
Antidiabetic Treatment
Patients with diabetes are at increased risk of experiencing arterial occlusive events 
while being treated with ponatinib. Theref ore, as a part of the assessment and 
management of the patient’s cardiovascular risk factors, initiation of or 
modifications to diabetic care should be considered in patients being treated with 
ponatinib who have elevated glucose levels.   The American Diab etes Association 
guidelines should be followed, and antidiabetic treatment and lifestyle intervention 
(including but not limited to weight loss, decreased fat intake, calorie restriction, 
increased physical activity, and smoking cessation) should be starte d in any patient 
with fasting glucose > 130 mg/dL (7.2 mmol/L) and/or HbA1c ≥7% ( Diabetes 
Preventio n Program Research Group, 2002 ; American Diabetes Association, 
Position Statement 2003 ).
Hypertension Treatment
Hypertension (HTN) may contribute to risk of arterial occlusive events.  Patients 
who have HTN should be managed appropriately before initiating treatment.  During 
ponatinib treatment, blood pressure elevations should be monitored and managed.  
Hypertensio n should be treated to achieve a goal of < 150/90 mmHg.  Initial 
antihy pertensive treatment should generally include a thiazide -type diuretic, calcium 
channel blocker, angiotensin -converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor 
blocker ( James et al, 2014 ).  Ponatinib treatment should be temporarily interrupted if 
HTN is not medically controlled.  Patients may require urgent clinical intervention 
for HTN associated with confusion, headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath.  
Prohibited Treatments
The following concurrent medications and treatments are prohibited:
 Other anticancer therapies
 Other investigational drugs or devices
 Medications with a known risk of Torsades de Pointes (see Appendix A )
 Herbal preparations or related over -the-counter preparations containing herbal 
ingredients
 Elective surgery requiring inpatient care
Medications that are potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 (see Appendix B )

05 October 2020 Page 15 of 113should be avoided, but are not prohibited (see Section 14.6) .
Medications that prolong the QT interval (QT), but are without a known risk of 
Torsades de Pointes, should be avoided but are not prohibited.  If such medications are necessary and are used while a patient is on study, additional ECG monitoring should be performed as clinically indicated.
Efficacy Evaluation Hematologic response rate, cytogenetic response rate, molecular response rate, and 
disease progression will be assessed according to standard criteria, as follows:
! Bone marrow aspirates for assessment of cytogenetic response
! BCR-ABL1ISassessment to determine molecular response
! Complete blood count (CBC) for assessment of hematologic response
! Survival follow-up
Patients will be followed for response, progression, and survival, for 24 months 
following treatment assignment in the Main Treatment Period. Patients who continue to receive treatment in the Treatment Continuation Period will continue to be followed to ensure continued clinical benefit and compliance with study treatment.  Section 12describes follow-up for all patients in the study.
Safety Evaluation Safety assessments will include physical and laboratory examinations.  AEs will be 
graded according to the NCI CTCAE, v4.0.
All patients receiving at least 1 dose of ponatinib will be considered evaluable for 
safety.  The AE, AOE and VTE incidence rates, as well as the frequency of occurrence of overall toxicity—categorized by toxicity grades (severity)—will be described for each cohort.  Listings of laboratory test results will also be generated, and descriptive statistics summarizing the changes in laboratory tests over time will 
be presented. 
Pharmacokinetic 
EvaluationBlood samples will be collected at specified time points to characterize the 
pharmacokinetics of ponatinib. Upon implementation of Amendment 6, no further PK sample collection will be performed as all ongoing patients have completed at least 12 cycles of treatment.
Plasma ponatinib concentration-time data will be obtained to contribute to 
population PK and exposure-response analyse s of safety and efficacy. The analysis 
plan for the population PK and exposure-response analyses will be defined separately and the results of these analyses will be reported separately.

05October 2020 Page 16of 113stratified by age at baseline ( ≥60 vs. < 60 years) and history of hypertension, 
diabetes, and/ or hyperlipidemia (yes/no). 
Cohorts A, B, and C will consist of CP -CML patients (resistant to previous TKI 
therapy  or who have T315I mutation) being administered a daily starting dose of 45 
mg, 30 mg, or 15 mg ponatinib, respectively.  Patients starting a t 45 mg or 30 mg 
will have their daily dose reduced to 15 mg upon achievement of ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS
(as defined below and in the protocol).  Each cohort of patients will be analyzed 
separately for efficacy and safety.
The primary endpoint for this trial will be ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISrate at 12 months. The 
primary  analy sis is planned after all patients have at least 12 months of follow -up; 
however, preliminary analyses may be performed at earlier time points.
Statistical inference will be made for each of the 3 cohor ts separately, with the 
primary  endpoint of ≤1% BCR -ABL1IStested at 2 -sided 0.05/3=0.0167 significant 
level using the Bonferroni method for multiplicity adjustment.  The primary analysis 
of the primary endpoint of ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISwill be performed using a 2-sided 
exact 98.3% confidence interval (CI) for ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISrate based on the 
intention -to-treat (ITT) population.  Any other comparisons will be descriptive.
Sample Size Determination: 
The primary endpoint for this trial will be the ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISrate at 12 mo nths.  
Consistent with the phase 2 PACE trial, the null or uninteresting ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS
rate is set at 20%.  The alternative ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISrate is set at 35%.  Using the 
Bonferro ni method, t he overall 2 -sided significant level for statisti cal testing in each 
cohort will be set at 0.0167.  The primary analysis of the primary endpoint of ≤1% 
BCR -ABL1ISwill be performed using a 2 -sided exact 98.3% CI for ≤1% BCR -
ABL1ISrate based on the ITT population.
A total sample size of 276 patients or 92 patients in each cohort (1:1:1) will 
distinguish a favorable ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISrate of 35% from a null or an 
uninteresting ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISrate of 20%, with a nominal 80% power and a 1 -
sided ty pe I error rate of 0.0083 (equivalent to a 2 -sided 0.0167) us ing an exact 
binomial test. Using the 20% boundary for ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS, 29 or mo re ≤1% 
BCR -ABL1ISresponders will be needed for a lower limit of the 2 -sided exact 98.3% 
CI for the ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISrate to exceed 20%. 
Rationale for Number of 
PatientsThe total number of patients planned to be enrolled in this study is based on the sum 
of the individual cohorts described in the statistical considerations (276 patients).

05October 2020 Page 27of 1138 INTRODUCTION
This protocol describes a phase 2 open -label study  of 3 different starting dosages of ponat inib for 
treatm ent of patients with refractory  chronic myelo id leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP).  
Ponatinib was designed to inhibit the BCR -ABL1 protein, the pathogenetic driver of CML, with 
high potency  and pan -inhibitory  capabili ty.  Pan -inhibit ion refers to ponatinib’s abilit y, in 
preclinical experiments, to inhibit or prevent t he emergence of all single mutations that arise in 
the course of therapy  with imatinib, dasat inib, nilotinib, and bosut inib, and which have been 
observed to engender resistance of CML to treatment with these current ly available t yrosine 
kinase inhibitors ( TKIs).  Data from the phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials of ponatinib have 
supported the preclinical findings and demo nstrated that ponatinib has substant ial activity in 
CML that has beco me resistant to prior therapy.
Ponatinib ( Iclusig®, ARIAD Pharmaceut icals, Inc. ) is approved in the United States (US) for the 
treatm ent of adult patients with chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase chronic myelo id 
leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymph oblastic l eukemia (Ph+ ALL) 
for who m no other TKI therapy  is indicated and for treatment of adult patients with T315I-
positive CML (chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase) or T315I -posit ive Ph+ ALL .In 
the European Unio n (EU), ponatinib is approv ed for the treatm ent of adult patients with CML 
(chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase ) and Ph+ ALL who are resistant to dasatinib (or 
nilotinib for CML) and into lerant to dasatinib (or nilot inib for CML) and for who m subsequent 
treatm ent wi th imatinib is not clinically appropriate, or who have the T315I mutation.
The phase 2 clinical trial of ponat inibin pat ients wit h CML or Ph+ ALL who have had prior TKI 
therapy  (AP24534-10- 201, PACE), which supported the drug’s approvals, tested a starting do se 
of 45mg daily. The 5 -year data from this study confirmed that treatment with ponat inib 
continued to provide clinically meaningful responses.  In patients with CP -CML, the primary  
endpo int was m et in m ore than doubl e that of the most recent dasatinib or nilotinib therapy 
(55.4% vs. 25.8%) and 85.7% remained in the primary endpo int for ≥550 day s at 30 mg.  The 
median duration of fo llow-up was 37.3 months.Continuing analyses of the phase 2 trial have 
demonstrated a hi gher cum ulative incidence of arterial occlusive events (including 
cardi ovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular events) observed wit h a longer follow -
up, than reported at the time of the init ial approval.  Arterial and venous thrombosis and 
occlusions—including fatal my ocardial  infarction (MI), stroke, severe peripheral vascular 
disease, and the need for urgent revascularizat ion procedures —have been reported in ponatinib -
treated pati ents.
Current data suggest that a dose -effect relat ionship exists with efficacy and with the occurren ce 
of arteri al occl usive events (AOEs), and that a lower daily dose may  reduce the incidence of 
AOEs.  This clinical study  will assess the relat ionships of exposure with efficacy and safet y: 
patients will  receive a range of init ial doses, and at defined t ime points, patients in response will 
undergo a dose reduction.  The goal of the study  will thus be to understand induct ion of 
responses, maintenance of responses, safet y, and exposure -response as consequences of these 
dosing strategies.

05October 2020 Page 28of 113The primary  endpoin t of this study  will be the achievement of ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS at 12 m onths. 
This incorporates standard CML approaches to patient care and uses patient monitoring. 
Increasingly, patient monitoring is being performed by  quant itation of  BCR -ABL1 transcripts 
froma standard established by the international scale (IS) ( Marin, 2014; NCCN, 2014; Baccarani 
et al, 2013 ; Marin et al, 2012 ; Lauseker et al , 2012 ; Saglio et al, 2012).  
This tri al is being conducted in fulfillment of an FDA post -marketing requirement (PMR2113 -6).
8.1 Ponatinib Preclinical Summary
In vitro assays demonstrated that ponatinib potently inhibits the kinase enzymat ic act ivity of 
native ABL1 and mutant versions of the protein, including T315I, with IC 50concentrations 
between 0.4 and 2.0 nM.  Ponatinib inhibit ed the in vitro kinase act ivity of addi tional kinases 
with IC 50concentrations between 0.1 and 20 nM, including members of the VEGFR, PDGFR, 
FGFR, and EPH receptors and the SRC families of kinases, as well as KIT, RET, TIE2, and 
FLT3.  In a cell line expressing nat ive BCR
-ABL1, ponatinib inhibited viabilit y with an IC 50
< 1nM.  Ponatinib also potently inhibited viabilit y (with IC 50s <40 nM) of cell lines expressing 
14 major clinically -observed BCR -ABL1 mutants that are resistant to the other approved TKIs.  
The abilit y of ponat inib to suppress the emergence of resist ant m utants was al so assessed.  Using 
an in vit ro mutagenesis screen approach, which has successfully predicted mutations that confer 
clinical resistance to the approved TKIs ( Bradeen et al, 2006 ), 40 nM concentration of ponatini b 
was found to suppress the emergence o f any resistant BCR -ABL1 mutati on (O’Hare et al, 2009 ).  
Based on these data, the hy pothesis that ponatinib will treat BCR -ABL1 -driven l eukemia wi th 
high potency  and effectiveness was tested i n phase 1, 2, and 3 trials.
8.2 Ponatinib Clinical Efficacy
8.2.1 Phase 1 Clinical Trial of Ponatinib (AP24534 -07-101)
The phase 1 trial o f ponatinib enrolled 81 patients with hematologic malignancies who had no 
other effect ive treatment options.  Doses from 2 mg to 60 mg were invest igated, and 45 mg was 
chosen as the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).  The trial has co mpleted, with all 81 patients 
discontinued fro m the study .  As of 18 October 2016, the MCyR rate for CP -CML patients 
(N=31/43) was 72% (CCy R rate of 65. 1%) and 83.3% in patients with T315I; the MMR rate for 
these patients was 55.8%; and the MR4.5 ( ≤0.0032% BCR -ABL1IS) rate was 32.6%.  Duration 
of MCyR ranged from 8 to 345 weeks (median not yet reached), and the Kaplan -Meier method 
estimated that 72% of r esponders will remain in MCyR at 4y ears.  At the time of analysis, of the 
43 CP -CML patients, 22 who achieved MCyR remained on study —20 of  who m were in 
continuous MCyR.
Steady -state peak pl asma concentrations of ponat inib at dose l evels o f 45 m g, 30 m g, an d 15 m g 
exceeded the concentration (40 nM) required to suppress the emergence of any resistant 
BCR- ABL1 mutations.  Efficacy was demo nstrated at each of these dose levels, and responses 
were m aintained for patients who started at 45 mg and reduced to 15 mg (all 3 of the ongoing 
CP-CML pat ients in the 15
-mg dose cohort had achieved and maintained MCyR at the time of 
filing).

05October 2020 Page 29of 113As of 18 October 2016, the most common treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) ( ≥30%) were rash 
(49.4 %), nausea (45.7%), fatigue (45.7%),  headache (43.2%), arthralgia (39.5%), constipat ion 
(39.5%), vomit ing (39.5%), hy pertensio n (37.0%), py rexia (37.0%), edem a peripheral  (35.8%), 
platelet count decreased (35.8%), abdominal pain (34.6%), diarrhea (32.1%) and rash 
erythematous (30.9%) .  
Overall, 81.5% of patients experienced a treatment -emergent SAE.  Pancreatit is, the 
dose-limit ing toxicit y (DLT) in the phase 1 s tudy, was the m ost comm on treatm ent-related SAE, 
occurring in 12.3% of patients.  The SAEs with the highest incidence (> 5% of patients), 
regardl ess of rel ationship to study  treatm ent, were febrile neutropenia (14.8%), pneumonia 
(13.6%), pancreat itis (12.3%), py rexia (11.1%), neoplasm progression (8.6%), abdominal pain 
(7.4%), atrial fibrillat ion (7.4%), and dy spnea (6.2%).  Serious AOEs and VTEs occurred in 
24patients (30%): 13 (16%) had cardiovascular SAEs, 5 (6%) had cerebrovascular SAEs, 7 (9%) 
had per ipheral  vascular SAEs, and 4 (5%) had venous SAEs.  A more detailed presentation of 
AEs is provided in the Clinical Investigator’s Brochure for ponatinib .
8.2.2 Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Ponatinib (AP24534 -10-201, PACE)
The phase 2 trial enro lled 449 patients with refractory  CML (all  phases) or Ph+ ALL that was 
either resistant or i ntolerant (R/I) to dasatinib or nilot inib or with the T315I mutation.  Patients 
received 45 mg ponat inib orally once daily (QD).  The 5 -year study  report was com pleted, wi th 
10 pati ents still ongo ing at 1 site in Korea as of the data cutoff date of 06 February 2017.  
Median duration of fo llow
-up for the overall population was 37.3 months (range: 0.07- 73.13).  
As of 06 February  2017, the overall MCyR rate for CP -CML patients (N=148) wa s 55.4% and 
overall CCyR rate was 46.1% (N=123).  The MCyR and CCyR rate for CP -CML R/I patients 
were 50.7% and 39.9% respectively, and for CP- CML patients with the T315I mutation 
confirmed at baseline, the MCyR and CCyR rates were 70.3% and 65.6% respecti vely.  The 
overall MMR rate was 40.4% (57.8% in T315I patients) ( Table 1).

As of 06 February  2017, the m ost comm only reported TEAEs (i .e., incidence o f ≥20% of 449 
patients overall, in decreasing order of frequency) were platelet count decreased, abdomi nal pain, 
rash, const ipation, headache, dry  skin, hypertensio n, fat igue, pyrexia, arthralgia, nausea, 
neutrophil count decreased, anemia, diarrhea, lipase increased, vo miting, myalgia, and pain in

SAEs considered to be treatment -related were rep orted in 172/449 patients (38.3%). The most 
commo n SAEs considered by the Invest igator to be treatment -related were pancreatit is 
(25/449 patients; 5.6%) and peripheral arterial occlusive disease (14/449 patients; 3.1%). All 
other treatment -related SAEs wer e reported in <3% of the overall populat ion. In general, 
treatm ent-related SAEs were reported in a higher proportion of CP -CML pati ents (who had the 
longest treatment duration) compared with AP -CML and dBP -CML/Ph+ ALL pat ients.
8.3 Dose-Response Analyses
This clinical trial will test 2 modulations of dose: both a range of starting doses utilized in the 
phase 1 and 2 clinical trials (as described in Sect ion8.2.1 and Section 8.2.2 ), and dose reduction 
at defined t ime points for patients in response.  The data that support these approaches derive 
from univari ate and mul tivariate analyses of the relationship of dose, eff icacy , and safet y and 
analyses o f the effects of dose reductions on response and safet y.
8.3.1 Dose Intensity and Efficacy
The impact of dose on MCyR in pat ients with CP-CML has been evaluated using 
2methodologies: a mult ivariate analysis adjust ing for covariat es, and an analysis o f dose 
response in pat ients with at least 3 m onths of foll ow-up that separates them into tertiles of dose 
intensity (the l atter analysis also includes CCyR and MMR).  Both analyses show that increasing

include dose intensit y, patient age, pri or TKI exposure, and baseline platelet counts ( Table 2).

As further evidence, an analysis o f CP-CML patients fro m the phase 2 PACE trial who had 
received at least 3 months of fo llow-up showed a decline in MCyR and MMR from the highest 
dose-intensity tertile to the l owest dose -intensity tertile ( Table 3).  Response rates are 
nevertheless high in the lowest tertile and higher in the higher tertiles.

In a popul ation with refractory  disease and few viable treatment options, achieving an init ial 
response is among the most important goals of TKI treatment.  The starting dose of 45 mg once 
daily  used in the phase 2 tri al of ponatinib has been shown to yiel d responses in a high 
proporti on of  patients.  The exposure -response analyses to date also support the conclusio ns from  
univariate and mult ivariate analyses: that patients who receive a higher starting dose (and 
therefore, a higher exposure, on average) ac hieve a response more quickly.  However, response 
rates are sufficient ly high to reasonably attempt ident ificat ion—both prospectively and with 
greater resol ution—of the effect of lower starting doses.  Thus, this clinical study  will test 
starting doses acr oss the range of doses (45, 30, and 15 mg) utilized in the phase 2 and phase 3

doses of ponatinib.
8.3.2 Dose Intensity and Safety 
Multivariate analyses on data from the phase 2 PACE trial were also performed to elucidate the 
relationship between dose intensit y (as m easured by  the daily dose given) and safet y.  In general, 
increasing dose intensit y correlated with an increased probabilit y of experiencing AEs.  The
factors associated with a lower probabilit y of AEs were y ounger age, less t ime since diagnosis, 
and fewer prior TKIs.  Patients with a T315I mutatio n (who were generally y ounger, wi th a 
shorter time since diagnosis and fewer prior TKI therapies) did, in f act, experi ence less 
thrombocy topenia and neutropeni a. 
With longer fo llow-up and the accumulat ion of AOEs and VTEs, the relat ionship between dose 
intensity and the events was examined, using mult ivariate analysis wit h an expanded set of 
covari ates wi th a minimum o f 24 m onths of fo llow-up.  All modeling showed that dose intensit y 
(up to the time of the events) was statist ically -significant ly associated with an increase in event 
rate in univariate models, and became more significant when adjust ing for covari ates in 
multivariate models.  
The specific relat ionships among dose, AOEs and VTEs, and clinical covariates were also 
examined.  Data are shown below in Table 4.  The analysis demo nstrates that the strongest 
associ ations wi th the occurrence of vascular events were observed with age (odds ratio 1.82; 
p
<0.0001), a medical history  of di abetes (odds ratio 3.69; p=0.0003), dose intensit y (oddsratio 
1.99/15 -mg dose; p=0.0009), a medical history of ischemia (odds ratio 2.46; p=0.0087), and time 
since diagnosis (odds ratio 2.03; p=0.0228).  Other contribut ing factors were baseline neutrophil 
(p=0.0276) and platelet counts (p=0.0466), the numbe r of pri or regimens (p=0.0755), and the 
presence of the T315I mutation (p=0.1328).

These data suggest that the risk of AOEs can be influenced by  dose, as well  as by  clinical and 
histori cal factors pertaining to the patient populat ion.  The data, in conjunction wit h the

05October 2020 Page 33of 113dose-response data discussed above, provide the rationale for testing lower starti ng doses in 
CP-CML pat ients.  They  also suggest that other measures to lower exposure, such as dose 
reducti on, m ay be protective.
8.4 Rationale for Dose Reduction after Response 
Dose intensit y appears to be rel ated to the risk of arterial occlusi ve events, and preliminary  
analyses in pat ients with AEs suggest that patients can maintain response on doses lower than 
45mg.  The mult ivariate analysis demo nstrates that several covariates contribute significant ly to 
the risk of vascular events.  
Data demonstrate that despite reductions in dose intensit y (as a resul t of AEs), pati ents are able 
to maintain responses.  Data from the patients in the phase 2 PACE trial who underwent dose 
reducti on are shown in Table 5.

Data extraction date: 06 January 2014
These findings illustrate that patients who achieved response, either at 45 mg or 30 mg, 
maintained responses after dose reduction (because of AEs) to 30 mg or 15 mg.  The 
maintenance of response appears to be independent of the length of dose reduction.  Thus, there 
is a rationale for testing a standard approach to dose reduction in patients who have achieved 
response in this study . 
Taken together, these data support the use of a 45 -mg dose or a 30- mg dose to achieve a 
response in pat ients with no effecti ve treatm ent optio ns, and to then reduce the dose to maintain 
response while lowering the risk of long -term AEs.
8.5 Rationale behind Measures to Reduce Risk
Therapy  with ponatinib should be init iated by  a physician experienced in the diagnosis and 
treatm ent o f patients with leukemia.  As discussed and as demo nstrated in the mult ivariate 
analyses, several aspects of patient history  contribute to the risk of developing vascular 
complicat ions of therapy; while pat ients both with and wit hout ri sk factors experienc e such 
complicat ions, the presence of certain risks is strongly  associated wi th AEs. Table 6
demonstrates the univariate relat ionship between a variet y of histori cal risk factors and the 
occurrence of vascular complicat ions in the phase 2 PACE trial.

It is clear that certain risks, such as prior MI or coronary  disease, can be discretely  identified in 
patient medical history  and are associ ated wi th increased risk.  Thus, based on these 
observat ions, pati ents wi th MI, unstable angina, or CHF within 3 mon ths prior to the first dose of 
ponatinib are excluded fro m the study .  Similarly , pati ents wi th a history  of clinically  significant 
atrial arrhy thmia or any  ventricular arrhy thmia are also excluded.  
Other ident ified baseline risk factors for serious AOEs and VTEs include diabetes mellitus, 
hypertensio n, and hypercho lesterolemia.  These condit ions can be managed in the course of 
therapy; consequent ly, their appropriate medical treatment and control are mandatory  in this 
clinical trial.
8.6 Rationale for the Ponatinib Phase 2 Dose- Ranging Clinical Trial
Ponatinib is approved for the treatment of CP -CML pati ents, based on response rate observations 
in refractory  patients in a phase 2 clinical trial (AP24534-10- 201, PACE).  Responses were 
achieved in heavily  pretreated patients and in patients who had resistance mutations, but also in 
patients who di d not.  Responses were durable, with 39.6% of CP -CML pat ients continuing to 
receive clinical benefit and remaining on ponatinib for > 4 years.  Continuing analyses of t he

05October 2020 Page 35of 113phase 2 trial have demo nstrated a higher cumulat ive incidence of arterial occlusive events 
(including cardio vascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular events) observed wit h a 
longer fo llow-up, than reported at the time of the init ial approvals i n the US and EU.  Thus, there 
exists a need to examine strategies to lessen vascular complications of long -term therapy  in these 
patients who have a substant ial, unmet therapeuti c need and stand to benefit from ponat inib 
therapy .
Analyses fro m the phase 1 and phase 2 trials suggest that a dose- effect relat ionship exists with 
the occurrence of responses.  The conclusio ns of the m ultivariate analyses support the 
proposi tion that hi gher dose intensit ies in refractory  patients yield higher response rates across
the dose ranges tested.  This provides the basis for retaining a starting dose of 45 mg daily, which 
will maximize the possibilit y of each patient achieving a rapid response and maintaining it —both 
key requi rements of successful therapy in pat ients with this unmet medical need.  Based on the 
preclinical findings and addit ional clinical observati ons, supporting evidence points to lower 
dose intensit ies having the capabilit y to induce and maintain cy togeneti c responses in pat ients 
with CP-CML.  Steady -state peak plasma concentrations o f ponatinib at dose levels o f 45 m g, 
30mg, and 15 mg exceeded the concentration (40 nM) required to suppress the emergence of 
any resistant BCR -ABL1 mutations.  Efficacy was demonstrated at each of these dose levels, and 
respon ses were maintained for patients who started at 45 mg and reduced to 15 mg.  Thus, the 
initial doses in this study  will be 45 m g, 30 m g, and 15 m g daily.
The accumulat ion of vascular complicat ions is also rel ated to dose.  Although pat ients without 
pre-existing risk factors experience vascular AEs, several risks have been ident ified that can aid 
in select ing appropriate patients for therapy; addit ionally, the management of concurrent medical 
condi tions may  further mi tigate ri sk.
In summary, this rando mized phase 2 clinical trial will examine a range of ponatinib doses—
both init ially and as part of a dose reduction strategy —in CP-CML pat ients, and will generate 
data on efficacy and safet y in relation to dose, supported by pharmacokinet ic data.  The goal o f 
this study is to test the hypothesis that each of the 3 starting doses will demo nstrate the continued 
efficacy  of ponat inib, and that the dose reduction strategy will lessen vascular occlusive 
complicat ions in the resistant CP -CML patient populat ion—includin g pati ents wi th or wi thout 
the T315I mutation who have no alternative therapies available.

10 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
10.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a multi-center, randomized phase 2 trial to characterize the efficacy of ponatinib over a 
range of 3 starting doses.  Eligible patients must have CP-CML; have received at least 2 prior 
TKI therapies and have demonstrated resistance to treatment or have the T315I mutation, as 
defined in Section 11.  The trial will also assess the short- and long-term safety of the 3 starting 
doses investigated.
Patients will be randomized to receive once-daily oral administration of 1 of 3 starting doses of 
ponatinib: 45 mg (Cohort A), 30 mg (Cohort B), or 15 mg (Cohort C).  Patients starting at 45 mg 
or 30 mg will have their daily dose reduced to 15 mg upon achievement of ≤1% BCR-ABL1IS, 
as described in Section 14.1.3.   In the event of loss of ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISafter dose reduction 
for response, and in the absence of AEs necessitating continued dose reduction, escalation back 
to the starting dose will be allowed, upon review  and agreement with the medical monitor. 
All randomized patients will enter the Main Treatment Period.  Patients will remain on treatment 
in the Main Treatment Period for 24 months.  Following completion of or withdrawal from the 
Main Treatment Period (as described in Section 12.4.1 ), patients who are both tolerating 
treatment and receiving clinical benefit from tr eatment may enter into the optional Treatment 
Continuation Period upon discussion and agre ement between the investigator and medical 
monitor.  Examples of clinical benefit that could allow a patient to enter the Treatment 
Continuation Period include (but are not limited to) a reduction from baseline in BCR-ABLIS
levels (but without meeting the protocol-defined response criterion of ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISat 
12 months), an improvement in hematologic parameters (but without meeting the Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only ct to the Applicable Terms of Useurabilitabil y

10.2 Description of Treatment
Patients will be randomized to receive once-daily oral administration of 1 of 3 starting doses of 
ponatinib: 45 mg (Cohort A), 30 mg (Cohort B), or 15 mg (Cohort C). 
Mandatory dose reduction: Patients will undergo assessments for achievement of ≤1% 
BCR-ABL1ISand for consideration of mandatory dose reduction at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (or if 
an unscheduled response assessment is performed).  The schedule for dose reduction is described 
in Section 14.1.3.  
Escalation for loss of response following dose reduction: Patients who undergo dose reduction 
upon achievement of ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISand who, with continued monitoring, lose the ≤1% 
BCR-ABL1ISmay undergo dose escalation back to the starting dose at the discretion of the 
physician and upon review with the medical moni tor.  The dose re-escalation schema is 
described in Section 14.1.4.
Dosing during the Treatment Continuation Period: Patients in the Treatment Continuation 
Period will be treated with study drug in accordance with Section 14.1.5.  
10.3 Randomization
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive ponatinib in one of three different starting 
dose cohorts:
! Cohort A: 45 mg QD with reduction to 15 mg at 3, 6, 9, or 12 months upon achievement of 
≤1% BCR-ABL1IS 
! Cohort B: 30 mg QD with reduction to 15 mg at 3, 6, 9, or 12 months upon achievement of 
≤1% BCR-ABL1IS 
! Cohort C: 15 mg QD with no change upon achievement of ≤1% BCR-ABL1IS

shoul d be perform ed following com plete eligibilit y assessments and prior to the init iation o f 
assigned treatment.  This study  is open-label; patients, invest igators, and the sponsor will know 
the identi ty of each pati ent’s study  treatm ent.  
10.4 Treatment Periods
For each patient, treatment will start with the Main Treatment Period.  Following co mpletion o f 
the 24-month Main Treat ment Period or following early withdrawal fro m the Main Treatment 
Period before complet ing all 24 cycles o f the Main Treatment Period (as described in 
Secti on12.4.1 ), patients who are both tolerating ponatinib treatment and receiving clinical 
benefit from treatment may enter into an optional Treatment Continuat ion Peri od upon 
discussio n and agreement between the invest igator and medical mo nitor.
10.4.1 Main Treatm ent Period
Patients will  be treated wi th their randomized dose of study  drug, wi th mandatory  dose reducti on 
and the option for dose re -escalat ion for loss of response, as described in Sect ion10.2.  Pati ents 
will remain in the Main Treatment Period until meeting any  of the cri teria for wi thdrawal  (see 
Secti on12.4.1 ), or until complet ing the full 24 cycles of the Main Treatment Period.
10.4.2 Optional Treatment Continuation Period
Patients who ei ther com plete the 24 -cycle Main Treatm ent Peri od or who discont inue before 
completing 24 cycles because of failure to achieve or maintain protocol -defined responses (see 
Secti on12.4.1.1 ) may enter the Treatment Continuation Period on a case -by-case basi s if they 
are both tolerating treatment and receiving clinical benefit from ponat inib administration as 
determined by agreement between the investigator and medical mo nitor.  Wri tten permissio n 
from the medical  monitor m ust be obtained in advance of each p atient entering the Treatment 
Continuat ion Peri od. Pati ents who enter the Treatment Continuat ion Peri od will be evaluated as 
per the SOE shown in Table 8.  For pati ents in the Treatment Continuat ion Peri od, the follow -up 
schedule will be arranged so that contact between the pat ient and the site occurs at least once 
every 3 m onths and a study  visit occurs at l east once every  6 months.  Object ive evidence 
supporting such continuation treatment will include overall tolerance, hematologic evidence for 
disease control  relative to baseline, and lack o f events requiring study  discont inuat ion 
(Secti on12.4.2 ).
With continued agreement between the invest igator and medical monitor, each patient in the 
Treatment Continuat ion Peri od may  remain on ponatinib unt il the patient stops receiving clinical 
benefit or ex periences unacceptable toxicit y, or until  the study  is terminated by  the sponsor 
(whichever occurs first).  The clinical benefit to th e pati ent m ust be assessed by  the invest igator 
and medical mo nitor, wi th key evidence supporting clinical benefit recorded in the source 
docum ents, and wi th study -specific clinical data recorded both in the source documents and in 
the electronic case report form (eCRF).

and dated an Inst itutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) -approved informed 
consent form.  Each patient's participat ion in the trial begins with the signing and dat ing of 
the informed consent form.
3 Randomization
Specific instructions for rando mizat ion will be supplied in the Study  Reference Manual.  
Randomization procedures should be performed wit hin the 21 -day screening peri od, 
following co mplete eligibilit y assessments and just prior to the init iation of assigned dose 
cohort.
4 Medical/Surgical History and Demographics
Medical and surgical history  and demographic info rmation will be recorded.  Medical and 
surgi cal history  include diagnoses, therapies, and medical and surgical treatments.  
Speci al attenti on shoul d be paid to docum enting risk factors for cardiovascular, 
cerebrovascular, peripheral vascular, and venous thro mboembolic disease.  The history 
must al so include any  history  of ischemic heart disease (such as angina, my ocardial  
infarction, acute coronary  syndrome, coronary  revasculariz ation procedures, etc.); valvular 
heart disease; congest ive heart failure; arrhyt hmias; myocardit is; peripheral arterial

05October 2020 Page 45of 1138 Physical Examination and ECOG Performance Status
A complete physical examinat ion, including measurement of weight, must be performed at 
screening; at Cy cle 1, Day  1 pri or to the first administration of study  drug; and at the 
End-of-Treatm ent Visi t.  All  physical examinat ions should address the presence or a bsence 
of hepatom egaly  and splenom egaly, which must be recorded.  The extent of the physical 
examinat ion shoul d be consistent wi th the medical history  and the pati ent’s underlying 
disease.  ECOG performance status should be evaluated during each physical e xaminat ion.  
Following the physical examinat ion for Cycle 1, Day  1—wi th the except ion of the 
End-of-Treatm ent Visi t
—all  subsequent physical examinat ions (to be performed on 
Days 15 and 28 of Cycle 1 and Day  28 of  Cycles 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24, and on D
ay 28 
of every  sixth cycle thereafter for patients continuing on to the Treatment Continuat ion 
Period, as indicated in Table 7and Table 8) may be di rected to relevant findings in the 
patient, but shoul d always include an assessment of hepatomegaly  and splenom egaly.  
Height measurement is required at screening only.
9 Eye Exam
A detailed eye history  and exam  must be performed at screening. The ey e exam  should test 
visual acuit y, refraction, pupillary  function, ocul ar motility, and intraocular pressure. 
Perform  a retinal exam ination, parti cularly  noting the appearance o f the retinal vasculature. 
Describe any signs of serious vascular occlusio n (both venous and arterial) in the retina. 
Also, clinically evaluate for photophobia, conjunctival disease, uveit is, and cataracts. 
10 Com plete Blood Count (CBC) with Differential
CBC with different ia
l is defined as peripheral blood total white blood cell (WBC) count, 
hemoglo bin, hematocrit, platelet count, abso lute neutrophil count (ANC), and WBC 
different ial, reported individually  for each cell t ype. Cell t ypes required for diagnosis and 
response assessment —including basophils, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, promyelocytes, 
and blasts, when present —must be quant ified.  Hematologic assessments must be obtained 
at screening and at every  subsequen t assessment, as specified in the Schedule of Events 
(Table 7and
 Table 8), or m ore frequent ly as clinically  indicated (e.g., to confirm the loss of 
hematol ogic response as defined in Sect ion16.5.1.3 )
. 
11 Serum Analysis
a. Chemistry
Serum  chemistry  consists of a peripheral blood draw with the following assessments: 
sodium, potassi um, chloride, bicarbonate (or total carbon dioxide [CO 2]), bl ood urea 
nitrogen (BUN, or urea), fast ing glucose, albumin, creatinine, total bilirubin (direct 
and indirect), AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, magnesium, phosphorous, calcium, 
amylase, and lipase.
The full chemistry  panel m ust be obtained at screening and at every  subsequent 
assessment –with the exception o f assessments on Day  15 during Cycle 2 and 
Cycle 3 which are lipase only  –as specified in the Schedule of Events ( Table 7and 
Table 8), or m ore frequent ly as clinically indicated.

Fasting serum lipid panel (total, high -densit y lipoprotein [HDL], and low -densit y 
lipoprotein [LDL]) —including triglycerides—must be collected during screening 
andat subsequent time points as specified in the Schedule o f Events ( Table 7and 
Table 8), or m ore frequent ly as clinically indicated.
c. HbA1c, CRP, Troponin, and NT -proBNP or BNP
Hem oglobin A1c (HbA1c), C -reactive protein ( CRP), cardiac troponin (cTn) (either T 
or I is acceptable, but whichever is used must be used consistent ly for a given 
patient), and N -terminal pro -brain natriuret ic pept ide (NT -proBNP) assessments must 
be perform ed at screening. If the invest igational sit e is unable to perform NT -proBNP 
testing, a BNP test can be performed instead.  Addit ionally , HbA1c, CRP, cTn, and 
NT-proBNP (or BNP) assessments must be performed at the times specified in the 
Schedule of Events 
(Table 7and Table 8), or m ore frequent ly as clinically  indicated.
d. Hepatitis B Serology
At the time of screening, blood serum must be tested for Hepatit is B serology 
(Hepati tis B surface Ant igen, Hepat itis B core Antibody, and Hepat itis B surface 
Antibody ) at minimum. Patients who are chronic carriers of Hepat i
tis B virus (HBV) 
and receive a BCR -ABL TKI therapy  may have a reactivation of Hepat itis B. For 
patients wi th evidence of pri or or current HBV i nfecti on, pl ease refer to the IB 
versio n 8, Secti on 8.1.2.9.
12 Pregnancy Test
The pregnancy test must be a beta- human chorionic gonadotropin (β -HCG) test, using 
either urine or serum .  Women who are not of childbearing potential (status post -
hysterectomy, status post -bilateral oophorectomy, or postmenopausal [defined as 
amenorrhea for at l east 12 months]) do not need to have the test performed.  If the test is 
deem ed necessary , it must be perform ed wi thin 7 days of first dose of study  drug and 
known to be negat ive prior to randomization.  Women of childbearing potential at study 
start m ust also com plete the pregnancy  test at the End -of-Treatm ent Visi t.
13 Electrocardiogram (ECG)
All ECGs must be 12 -lead ECGs.  The screening ECG must be performed within the 
21-day screening window prior to randomizat ion.  Addit ionally , 12-lead ECGs m ust be 
perform ed at Cy cles 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and at the end of every sixth cycle thereafter for 
patients continuing on to the Treatment Continuat ion Period; and at End
-of-Treatm ent, as 
specified in the Schedule of Events ( Table 7andTable 8)—or m ore frequent ly if clinically 
indicated.  If medicat ions known to p rolong the QTcF interval are used while a patient is on 
study , then addi tional ECG m onitoring shoul d be perform ed as clinically  indicated.
14 Echocardiogram (ECHO)
An ECHO for assessment of LVEF must be performed within the 21 -day screening 
window and at Cy cles 12, 24, and at the end of every  12th cy cle thereafter for patients 
continuing on to the Treatment Continuat ion Peri od; as well  as at End -of-Treatm ent, as 
specified in the Schedule of Events 
(Table 7andTable 8).  Addi tional ECHOs need only be

15 Adverse Events and Concomitant Medications
AEs and conco mitant m edicat ions are to be recorded continuously throughout the treatm ent 
period—starting on the date of signed informed consent —and at the 30- day follow-up visi t, 
as indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Table 7andTable 8).  It i s expected that new and 
updated AEs and concomitant medicat ions reported within the treatment period; on going 
AEs thought to be at least possibly study -drug rel ated; and all ongoing SAEs should be 
followed at l east every  4 weeks unt il they reso lve to baseline (or to NCI CTCAE, v4.0 
grade ≤1), stabilize, or are considered to be chronic/irreversible.
16 Bone Mar row Aspirate/Cytogenetics
The bone marrow (BM) aspirate results should include the components required for 
assessing response of the patient.  All BM aspirates should quant ify cell types required for 
diagnosis and response assessment, including promyelocy t
es and blasts.  Examinat ion 
shoul d include cy togeneti c assessment by  convent ional banding.  Interphase fluorescence 
in situ hybridizat ion (FISH) is not allowed.
The BM aspirate with or without an optional biopsy  must occur wi thin 42 days prior to 
rando miza tion and ± 7 days of the subsequent scheduled assessment at Cy cle 12.  A BM 
aspirate wi th cytogeneti c assessment i s requi red in all  patients on study  after the first 
12cycles. 
Patients wi th variant BCR -ABL1 translocat ions must be assessed for cy togenetic response, 
utilizing convent ional BM cy togenetic techniques, at each time point.
During Cycle 12, all pat ients must undergo a BM aspirate and cy togeneti c assessment. 
A BM aspirate and cy togeneti c assessment m ust be perform ed at the End -of-Treatment 
Visit if there have been no on -treatm ent BM assessments, or if the patient has greater than a 
1-log (i.e., 10 -fold) increase in transcript level; the exception is if the level remains ≤1% 
BCR- ABL1IS.  Bone m arrow aspi rates and cy togeneti c assessments m ay be per formed at 
other times when clinically  indicated (e.g., to confirm loss of cy togeneti c response as 
defined in Sect ion16.5.1.2 )
.  Results of any BM aspirate or cy togeneti c assessment, 
whether scheduled or unscheduled, must be recorded in the patient’s electronic case report 
form (eCRF).
17 Blood Samples for BCR -ABL1ISMolecular Response Assessment
Testing of peripheral blood in all pat ients by quanti tative, real -time po lymerase chain 
reacti on (PCR) of the BCR -ABL1 transcript must be done at screening; at the end of 
Cycles 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24; at the end of ev ery 3 cy cles thereafter for patients in 
the Treatm ent Continuat ion Peri od who have co mpleted < 24 total cycles of treatment in 
the study; at the end of every  6 cycles thereafter (at a minimum) for patients in the 
Treatment Continuat ion Peri od who have co mpleted ≥24 total cycles of treatment in the 
study; and at the End -of-Treatment Visit. Specific instructions will be supplied in the Study 
Reference Manual.

will be reported to the participating investigator.  However, in cases where a patient’s visit 
to the site is not feasible due to extenuating circumstances, such as the COVID-19 
pandemic, evaluation via local laboratories will be permitted.  The ratio of BCR-ABL1 to 
ABL1 transcripts will be reported on the International Scale.  For patients with variants of 
BCR-ABL1 for whic h there is no International Scale, only the absolute ratio of BCR-ABL1 
to ABL1 transcripts will be reported.

21 Pharmacokinetic (PK) Samples 
A pre-dose blood sample will be collected within 1 hour prior to dosing on Day 28 of 
Cycles 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12.  Samples will also be collected at 1 (± 15 minutes), 
4 (± 30 minutes), and 6 (± 30 minutes) hours post-dose on Day 28 in Cycle 1. 
Additionally, an unscheduled trough assessment (to be collected within 1 hour prior to 
dosing) will be performed at the first scheduled visit following a dose reduction of at least 
7 days’ duration prior to the visit. 
Patients must be instructed not to take the day’s dose of ponatinib until after the pre-dose 
sample is collected.  The pre-dose sample should be collected as close as possible to 
24 hours after the prior dose; the administration time of the prior dose must be recorded, Property of Takedarmacomaco

Upon implementation of Amendment 6, no further PK s ample collection w ill be performed 
as all ongoing patients have completed at least 12 cycles of treatment.
22 Review of Patient Daily Dosing Diary
The patient dosing diary card will be completed by the patient on a daily basis and 
reviewed by site staff at each visit. 
23 Treatment Continuation Procedures
Continuation patients (including both those who enter the Treatment Continuation Period 
before completing all 24 cycles of the Main Treatment Period and those who enter the 
Treatment Continuation Period after comp leting all 24 cycles of the Main Treatment 
Period) will generally be evaluated every 3 mont hs according to the schedule of events for 
the Treatment Continuation Period as shown in  Table 8.   Upon agreement between the 
investigator and the medical monit or, patients who have completed ≥24 cycles of 
treatment may be evaluated using an alternating schedule of telephone contact and patient 
visits (for visits that would otherwise occur at the end of odd- and even-numbered cycles, 
respectively, as shown in  Table 8) .  In all cases, the schedule will be arranged so that 
contact between the patient and the site occurs at least once every 3 months and a study 
visit occurs at least once every 6 months.
Key evidence supporting clinical benefit must be recorded by the investigator in the source 
documents, with study-specific clinical data recorded both in the source documents and in 
the eCRF as instructed in the eCRF Completion Guidelines.  Patients must be withdrawn 
from the Treatment Continuation Period if th ey are no longer receiving clinical benefit in 
the opinion of the investigator or if they meet any of the criteria shown in Section 12.4.2.   
The investigator may contact the medical monitor if  needed to discuss a patient’s continued 
participation in the Treatment Continuation Period.
24 End-of-Treatment or Early Termination Procedures
The End-of-Treatment (or early termination) visit should be performed within 2 weeks 
(14 days) of the patient’s last dose of study drug or the patient/investigator decision to 
discontinue treatment—whichever occurs later. A follow-up visit should be conducted 
approximately 30 days (±7 days) after the last dose of study treatment. For both visits, the 
information may be collected from tests that we re performed for the study or as part of the 
patient’s routine medical care. Patients that do not return to the clinic and attempts to 
contact these patients have been unsuccessful will be considered as lost to follow-up. At 
least three attempts must be made to contact the patient, and must be documented. See 
Section 12.2.2 for further details on discontinuation of patients from study drug. For 
patients continuing on to the optional Treatment Continuation Period, the End-of-
Treatment and subsequent follow-up visits should be performed only after the patient 
discontinues from the optional Treatment Continuation Period. Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Usetinuatinuat ioi

All AEs ongo ing or starting wit hin 30 days after End -of-Treatm ent m ust be recorded on the 
eCRF.  After this t ime, all ongo ing SAEs should be fo llowed at least every  4 weeks unt il 
they resolve to baseline (or to NCI CTCAE, v4.0 grade ≤ 1), stabilize, or are considered to 
be chronic/irreversible.
26 Follow -up Procedures: Survival
Survival data will be co llected every 12 weeks ± 14 days, starting after the last dose of 
ponatinib or the investigator/patient decisio n to di scontinue treatment—whichever occurs 
later. These data do not need to be obtained during a visit; phone contact is acceptable. 
Tests and procedures should be perform ed on schedul e, but occasi onal changes may  be allowed 
for holidays, vacat ion, and other administrative reasons. If the study  schedule is shifted, both 
assessments and dosing must be shifted to ensure collect ion of assessment is completed prior to 
dosing. If extenuating circumstances (such as the COVID -19 pandemic) prevent a patient fro m 
beginning treatment or complet ing a scheduled procedure or assessment within this time, the 
patient may  cont inue the study  only wi th the wri tten permissio n of the spo nsor/designee medical 
monitor. Similarly, if extenuat ing circumstances prevent complet ion of a scheduled evaluat ion 
but an acceptable alternat ive test can be performed, the patient may cont inue the study only wit h 
written permissio n of the sponsor/designee medical mo nitor. Mi ssed or del ayed study  visits 
and/or procedures should be recorded as protocol deviat ions.
12.1.1 Changes to Study Procedures Due to COVID
-19 Pandemic 
The fo llowing inform ation provi des gui dance regarding changes to the study  procedures that 
could be implemented for study  parti cipants or study  sites that are affected by  the COVID -19 
Public Healt h Emergency. This guidance takes references fro m the FDA Guidance on Conduct 
of Clinical  Trials o f Medical Products during COVID- 19 Public Health Emerge ncy -Guidance 
for Industry , Investi gators, and Insti tutional Review Boards, March 2020, updated 02 July 2020, 
and the EMA Guidance on the Management of Clinical Trials During the COVID -19 
(Coronavirus) Pandemic, Version 3 (28 April 2020).
As the COVID -19 pandemic may peak in different regions at different times and restrict ions 
implemented by  local laws and recommendations may vary , any  decisi on on procedural changes 
shoul d be made on a case -by-case basis by  the princi pal invest igator in consultat ion with the 
study  team  and the m edical team as needed, while maintaining patient safet y and confident iality 
as the priorit y.
Procedural  changes due to COVID -19 may include the fo llowing:
All attem pts shoul d be made to perform the assessments with the patient prese nt at the 
site. However, in cases where a patient’s visit to the site is not feasible (patient cannot 
travel  to the si te, the si te is tem porarily closed for visit s, or in cases where the 
investigator believes that is best for patient’s and site staff’s saf ety not to visit to the site),

05October 2020 Page 54of 11312.2 Patient Registration and Identification
Dem ographic informat ion on all pat ients who si gn the Informed Consent Form will be recorded 
on the eCRF.  Those patients who complete screening procedures and meet all eligible criteria 
may be enro lled into the study  using the enrollment procedure established by the sponsor.  At the 
time of enrollment, the patient wi ll be assigned a unique identificat ion code (number), consist ing 
of a study  site number and a unique consecut ive number.
12.2.1 Screen Failures
Patients who have signed informed consent and subsequent ly fail to m eet the inclusio n criteria 
and/or meet the exclusio n criteria are defined as screen failures.  For all screen failures, the 
investigator is to maintain a screening log that documents the patient’s init ials and reason(s) for 
screen failure.  A copy  of the l og shoul d be retained in the invest igator’s study f iles.  Any  patient 
who is re -screened after screen failure must, in addit ion to the failed procedure, repeat only those 
screening procedures outlined in the Schedule o f Events ( Table 7) that have fallen outside the 
specified screening period.
12.2.2 Early Discontinuation from Study Drug Administration or Assessments
In the event that a patient is withdrawn from the study , every effort will be made by  the 
investigator to document and report the reason for withdrawal as thoroughly as possible.  The 
reason for terminat ion must be clearly reported on the appropriate page of the patient’s eCRF.  
An End -of-Treatment reason for discont inuat ion must be recorded fo r any  patient who is 
rando mized.
If a patient is discont inued fro m the trial for any reason, every  effort m ust be m ade to perform  all 
clinical and laboratory  procedures as scheduled for the End -of-Treatm ent Visi t.  In the event that 
the pati ent fails to re turn for the necessary  visit(s), an effort m ust be made to contact the patient 
to determine the reason, and this informat ion should be recorded in the appropriate source record 
and the End
-of-Treatm ent eCRF.
12.3 Study Duration
Total  study  durati on is expected to be at l east 60 months.  This includes an enro llment period of 
approximately  36 m onths and a durati on of  treatment wi th study  drug of 24 m onths in the Main 
Treatment Period, unless the patient is discont inued early.  Fo llowing co mpletion of the 
24-mont h Main Treatment Period or fo llowing early  withdrawal from  the Main Treatment Period 
before complet ing all 24 cycles o f the Main Treatment Period and upon discussio n and 
agreem ent wi th the m edical mo nitor, pati ents who are receiving clinical benefit from and
tolerating Ponatinib may cont inue to receive treatment in the optional Treatment Continuat ion 
Period.  The study  will continue unt il all pat ients have been discont inued fro m the study  or the 
study  is terminated by  the sponsor, whi chever comes first.  Pati ents will  be followed f or 30 day s 
after last dose of study  drug.

14.1 Study Treatment
Patients will be randomized to receive ponatinib at 1 of 3 starting doses (45 mg, 30 mg, or 
15 mg) QD.  Ponatinib will be self-administered by  the patient on a daily schedule.  Each 28-day 
dosing period is referred to as 1 cycle.
Study treatment will be administered only to  eligible randomized patients at qualified centers 
(e.g., listed on the FDA Form 1572).
14.1.1 Starting Do se Assignment 
The starting dose of ponatinib will be 45 mg (Cohort A), 30 mg (Cohort B), or 15 mg (Cohort 
C), taken orally once daily.  Patients starting at 45 mg or 30 mg will have their daily dose 
reduced to 15 mg if ≤ 1% BCR-ABL1IShas been achieved, as described in Section 14.1.3.
14.1.2 Treatment Administration 
Patients will take the prescribed number of tablets with water, with or without food, at 
approximately the same time each day.  Patients will be provided a diary card or equivalent 
where the date and time of administration will be recorded; complete instructions will be 
provided with the Study Reference Manual.  Patients should be instructed not to take their dose 
on days of visits where they will have plasma samples drawn for PK analyses until after the first 
sample is drawn.  Patients who forget to take their dose more than 6 hours after it is due should 
not make up the missed dose.  Any missed doses should be recorded, and subsequent training of 
patients should be documented in the appropr iate source record (e.g., clinic chart) and in the 
eCRF.
14.1.3 Mandatory Dose  Reduction for Response Scheme
Patients will be assessed for ≤ 1% BCR-ABL1IS(as defined below) at 3-month intervals, and 
those in the 45 mg QD and 30 mg QD cohorts will have their doses reduced to 15 mg QD upon Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject t3 startin3 starti

dosing during the Treatment Continuation Period). Dose reduction based upon response can also 
be implemented when an unscheduled response assessment is performed. Dose reduction should 
be implemented as soon as feasible (preferably in 2 -3 weeks fro mthe time the response results 
have been co mmunicated to the sites). An unscheduled visit may be required to implement this 
change. No dose reduction for response will be implemented for patients in the 15 mg QD 
cohort.
The primary  endpoint of this study  will be achievement of ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS at 12 m onths . Thi s 
incorporates standard CML approaches to patient care and uses pat ient moni toring.Increasingly, 
patient m onitoring is being performed by quant itation of BCR -ABL1 transcripts from a standard 
establis hed by  the internat ional scale (IS) ( Marin, 2014 ; NCCN, 2014; Baccarani  et al , 2013 ; 
Marin et al, 2012 ; Lauseker et al , 2012; Saglio et al, 2012 ) .  
Patients will  undergo a baseline BM aspirate and cy togeneti c assessment to establish their 
diagnosis and eligibilit y.  They  will then undergo mo lecular monitoring at 3 -month intervals for 
the assessme nt of response and to inform the decisio n regarding dose reduction.  Patients will 
undergo a BM aspirate with cy togeneti c assessment after 12 cy cles, and at addit ional time po ints 
as specified in the Schedule of Events ( Table 8).  Details o f BM acquisit ion are also listed in 
Secti on12.1,
 Item 16.
Note: Patients who begin therapy  at 45 m g or 30 mg may  undergo dose reduction for adverse 
events (see Section 14.2.2 )
 prior to the achievement of ≤ 1% BCR -ABL1IS.  Thi s shoul d not 
affect the assessment of response ( ≤ 1% BCR -ABL1IS) nor the m andated reducti on to 15 m g QD 
upon its attainment. 
The schedule of patient assessment for mandat ory response- related dose reduction is as 
follows :
Patients in the 45 mg and 30 mg cohorts will have their dose reduced to 15 mg at 3 months if 
they have achieved ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS.  If not, they  will cont inue at their current dose until the 
6-month assessme nt. 
At 6 months, they  will have their dose reduced to 15 mg if they  have achieved ≤1% 
BCR- ABL1IS.  If not, they  will cont inue at their current dose until the 9 -month assessment.
At 9 months, they  will have their dose reduced to 15 mg if they  have achieve d 
≤1% 
BCR- ABL1IS.  If not, they  will cont inue at their current dose until the 12 -month assessment.
At 12 m onths, pati ents will  have thei r dose reduced to 15 mg if they  have achieved ≤1% 
BCR -ABL1IS. 
Patients will discontinue therapy  in the Main Treatment Period if they  are not in ≤1% 
BCR- ABL1ISat the time of mo lecular assessment at 12 months.  
14.1.4 Loss of Response after Dose Reduction for ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS
Patients who achieve ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISat any  time point, undergo dose reduction, and then 
lose ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS(Sect ion16.5.1.1 )
, are candidates for dose re -escalation to their starting

05October 2020 Page 61of 113dose in the absence of AEs requiring dose modification and upon review and agreement with the 
medical mo nitor.
As described in Section 14.1.3 , pati ents in the cohorts starting at 45 mg (Cohort A) and 30 m g 
(Cohort B) will undergo dose reduction to 15 mg upon achievement of ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS
during the Main Treatment Period.  With continued monitoring at the reduced dose, should 
patients f rom Cohort A or Cohort B demonstrate loss of ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS as determined by  
molecular assessment, they  may be candidates for dose escalat ion.  Dose escalat ion can be 
implemented at the discret ion of the physician and upon review wit h the m edical m onitor. 
Patients will  be monitored wi th molecular response assessmen ts according to the Schedule of 
Events ( Table 7and Table 8).  If the assessment does not demonstrate loss of ≤1% 
BCR- ABL1IS, asdefined in Section 16.5.1.1 ,continued mo nitoring is indicated.  If the 
assessment indicates loss of ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS, dose escal ation may be considered.
Patients may be dose re -escalated as follows:
Patients m ay only un dergo dose re -escalat ion if they are in Cohort A or Cohort B and do not 
have ongo ing AEs necessitat ing treatment at 10 mg or 15 mg as per Section 14.2.2 (Dose 
Modificat ions for Adverse Drug React ions). 
For pati ents in Cohort A, escalate to the starting dose of 45 mg.  If patients underwent dose 
reducti on for AEs and have not y et resumed dosing at 45 mg, escalate to 30 mg.  
For patients in Cohort B, escalate to the starting dose of 30 mg.
For pati ents in Cohort C, loss of ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISmandates their discont inuat ion from the 
Main Treatment Period.
If pat ients regain ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISafter dose escal ation, continue their therapy  at the escalated 
dose and m onitor according to the Schedule of Events ( Table 7and Table 8). 
If pat ients do not regain ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS after 6 m onths of therapy  at the escalated dose, they  
must be discont inued fro m the Main Treatment Period. 
14.1.5 Treatment during the Treatme nt Continuation Period
During the Treatment Continuat ion Peri od, each pati ent shoul d be administered the dose and 
most frequent schedule that i s both tol erable and continues to provide evidence of clinical benefit 
to the patient, not to exceed the highest dose and frequency  (QD) determined from  the pati ent’s 
experience in the Main Treatment Period.  A reduced dose and/or dosing frequency may be 
administered during the Treatment Con tinuati on Peri od upon di scussio n and agreement between 
the invest igator and t he medical mo nitor.
14.2 Supportive Care
An analysis o f baseline risk factors in pat ients from the phase 2 PACE study  assessed the impact 
of hypertensio n, hypercho lesterol emia, diabetes, and obesit y, and revealed several risk factors 
that predispose patients to AOEs and VTEs on ponatinib.  Based on an analysis of odds ratios 
(OR), the leading risk factors for serious AOEs are cardiovascular disorders, such as any history  
of myocardial infarct ion (MI) (OR=6.86), coronary artery  disease (OR=7.14), or coronary

subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Ltd. Co.)AP24534 -14-203
05October 2020 Page 62of 113revasculari zation (OR=6.19).  The ORs for serious AOEs are 3.53 for history  of ischemic 
cerebrovascular disease, 3.78 for diabetes mellitus, 2.49 for hy pertensi on, and 2.07 for 
hypercho lesterol emia.  Based on thi s analysis, the fo llowing supportive care recomm endat ions 
are provided to decrease the risk of AOEs and VTEs for patients taking ponat inib.
Antidiabetic Treatment
Patients wi th diabetes are at i ncreased risk of experiencing arterial occlusive events while being 
treated with ponat inib.  Therefore, as a p art of the assessment and management of the patient’s 
cardi ovascular risk factors, init iation of or m odificati ons to di abetic care shoul d be considered in 
patients being treated with ponatinib who have elevated glucose levels.  The American Diabetes 
Associ ation gui delines shoul d be f ollowed, and antidiabet ic treatment and lifest yle intervent ion 
(including but not limited to weight loss, decreased fat intake, calorie restrict ion, increased 
physical act ivity, and smoking cessat ion) should be started in any pa tient wi th fasting glucose 
>130 m g/dL (7.2 mm ol/L) and/or HbA1c ≥7% ( Diabetes Prevent ion Program  Research Group, 
2002; American Diabetes Association, Position Statement 2003 ) .
Hypertension Treatment
Hypertensio n (HTN) m ay contribute to ri sk of  arteri al occl usive events.  Patients who have HTN 
shoul d be managed appropri ately  before ini tiating treatm ent.  During ponatinib treatment, blood 
pressure elevations should be mo nitored and managed.  Hy pertensio n shoul d be treated to 
achieve a goal of < 150/90 mmHg.  Init ial antihypertensive treatment should generally include a 
thiazide -type di uretic, calcium channel blocker (CCB), angiotensin -converting enzyme inhibitor 
(ACEI), or angiotensin receptor blocker (A RB) ( James et al , 2014 ).  Ponatinib treatment should 
be tem porarily  interrupted if HTN is not medically controlled (refer to Section 14.2.1.5 below for 
additional management recommendat ions).  Pati ents m ay require urgent clinical intervent ion for 
HTN associated with confusio n, headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath.
14.2.1 Management of Selected AEs 
Dose reduct ion gui delines are outlined in Sect ion14.2.2 .  Thi s secti on provi des addi tional 
guidance for m anagement of selected AEs for ponatini b.
Com prehensive assessments of any  study  drug -related AEs (adverse drug reactions) experienced 
by the patient will be performed throughout the course of the study .  Ant icipated adverse drug 
reacti ons that m ay be experienced are described in the current In vestigator’s brochure for 
Ponatinib. The severit y of the event, as well as clinical judgment, will be utilized to determine 
appropriate management of the patient for any  AE experienced while participat ing in this study .
Any medicat ion—including those admin istered for therapy  of symptoms considered associated 
with study  drug administration —shoul d be reported on the appropriate concomitant medication 
page of the patient’s eCRF.  The symptoms should be reported on the AE page.
14.2.1.1 Arterial Occlusive and Venous Thrombotic/Embolic Events 
Serious arteri al and venous thrombotic and occlusive AEs— including fatal MI, stroke, stenosis 
of large arteri al vessels of the brain, severe peripheral vascular disease, renovascular disorders

ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a wholly -owned 
subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Ltd. Co.)AP24534 -14-203
05October 2020 Page 63of 113including renal artery  stenosis, and the need for urgent revascularizat ion procedures —have 
occurred in ponat inib-treated pati ents.  Pati ents wi th and wi thout cardi ovascular ri sk factors, 
including patients age 50 y ears or y ounger, experienced these events.  Vascular occlusive 
adverse events were more frequent with increasing age and in patients with prior history of 
ischemia, hypertensio n, diabetes, or hy perlipidemia.
14.2.1.1.1 Arterial Occlusion and Thrombosis 
Serious arteri al occl usive AEs occurred in ponatinib -treated pati ents; some pati ents experi enced 
events of more than 1 ty pe.  Seri ous cardi ovascular occl usive AEs included MI and coronary  
artery  disease.  Som e pati ents devel oped CHF concurrent or subsequent to the my ocardial  
ischemic event.
Serious cerebrovascular AEs were also reported in ponat inib-treated pati ents.  Som e pati ents 
developed stenosis of large arterial vessels of the brain (e.g., carotid, vertebral, or middle 
cerebral artery ).  
Serious peri pheral arteri al AEs were reported in ponat inib-treated pati ents; so me developed 
digital or distal  extremit y necrosi s with com plicat ions of diabetes mellitus and peripheral arterial 
disease that required amputations.
Moni tor and aggressively  treat f actors that increase cardiovascular risks, such as hypertensio n, 
smoking, hyperchol esterolemia, and hyperglycemia.  Interrupt and consider discont inuat ion of 
study  drug in patients who develop arterial occlusive AEs.  Any pat ient who experiences a 
serious AE of MI, stroke, or urgent revascularization while on trial must be discont inued fro m 
the trial un less the invest igator believes the potential benefit s of ponatinib treatment are likely to 
exceed the risks of cont inued treatment for that individual patient and the patient has no other 
treatm ent opti ons.
14.2.1.1.2 Venous Thromboembolism
Serious venous thromboembo lic AEs occurred in ponatinib -treated pati ents, incl uding deep 
venous thrombosis, pulmo nary embolism, superficial  thrombophlebi tis, and retinal vein 
thrombosis.  Consider dose modification or discontinuat ion of ponatinib in pat ients who develop 
serious ven ous thromboembolic AEs.  Ponatinib should not be restarted in patients with serious 
venous occlusive AEs unless the investigator believes the potential benefit outweighs the risk of 
recurrent venous occlusio ns and the patient has no other treatment options .
14.2.1.2 Neuropathy
Serious peri pheral and cranial neuropathic AEs have occurred in ponatinib -treated patients.  In 
clinical trials, serious peripheral neuropathic AEs reported included peripheral neuropathy , 
paresthesia, hypoesthesia, and hyperesthesia.  Of the patients who developed neuropathy , many 
did so during the first month of treatment.  Monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy , such as 
hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, disco mfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain, or 
weakness.  Consider in terrupting ponat inib and evaluate if neuropathy is suspected.

Hepatotoxicit y, most comm only manifested by  reversible transaminase and alkaline phosphatase 
elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, has been observed with ponatinib.  Monitoring of hep atic 
funct ion is reco mmended, and laboratory abnormalit ies should be managed with dose 
interrupti on and/or dose reduction, according to Table 9.
14.2.1.4 CHF and Left Ventricular Dysfunction
Severe CHF and left ventricular (LV) dysfunct ion have been reported in patients taking 
ponatinib.  Patients with cardiac disease or risk factors for cardiac disease should be monitored 
carefully , and any patient with signs or symptom s consistent with cardiac failure should be 
evaluated and treated.  Consider discontinuation o f ponatinib in pat ients who develop serious 
CHF.
14.2.1.5 Hypertension
Blood pressure shoul d be m onitored at each visit.  HTN detected by  at least 2 bl ood pressure 
measurements should be graded according to NCI CTCAE, v4.0, which defines HTN as a 
disorder characterized by a pathological increase in blood pressure: a repeated elevat ion in the 
blood pressure exceeding 150 mmHg for sy stolic and ove r 90 mmHg for diastolic.  Aggressive 
antihypertensive medicat ion shoul d be ini tiated or optimized to achieve target blood pressure for 
patients who ei ther develop HTN or experience worsening HTN during study  treatm ent before 
interrupti on or dose reducti on of the study
 treatment.  HTN m ay also contribute to renovascular 
disorders, m ost comm only observed as renal artery stenosis.  Renal artery  stenosis has been 
observed in patients taking ponat inib; monitoring for significant or unexplained hypertensio n 
shoul d therefore include an assessment for renal vascular disease.  If hypertensio n is persistent 
despite aggressive ant ihypertensive therapy (i.e., 3 or more medications), or if grade 3 or 4 HTN 
develops, dose interruption and reduction is recommended accordin g to Dose Modificat ion 
Guidelines for general nonhematologic AEs in Table 9.
14.2.1.6 Ocular Toxicity
Serious ocul ar AE toxi cities leading to bl indness or blurred visio n have occurred in ponatinib -
treated pati ents.  Retinal toxicit ies, including macular edema, retinal vein occlusio n, and retinal 
hemorrhage, have also occurred in ponatinib -treated pati ents.  Other ocular toxicit ies include 
cataract s, glauco ma, ir
itis, iridocycli tis, and ul cerative keratit is.  Conduct comprehensive eye 
exams at baseline and when clinically  indicated.  See Table 9for details.
14.2.1.7 Pancreatitis and Lipase or Amylase Elevations
Pancreat itis (symptomatic abdo minal pain associated with pancreat ic enzyme elevat ion) and/or 
elevations in lipase and amylase are known AEs associated with ponat inib.  Most cases of 
pancreat itis or elevated pancreatic enzymes occur within the first 2 month s of treatment with 
ponatinib.  These events are generally uncomplicated and reversible, and can be managed with 
both a bri ef interrupti on of  treatm ent and standard medical therapies. Almost all patients are able 
to con tinue on wi th ponatinib treatment at either the same or a reduced dose once the event has 
either improved to grade 1 or resolved.  Patients wit h low-grade (NCI CTCAE, v4.0 grade 1 or

closely  with serial  enzyme level determinations.  See Table 9for details.
14.2.1.8 Hemorrhage
Hem orrhagic events have occurred in patients receiving ponatinib.  Most of these events 
occurred in pat ients with grade 4 thrombocy topenia.  Interrupt administration in the case of 
serious or severe hemorrhage.
14.2.1.9 Fluid Retention and Edema
Ponatinib is associated with edema and occasio nally  serious fluid retenti on.  Pati ents sho uld be 
weighed and m onitored regul arly for signs and symptom s of fluid retention.  An unexpected and 
rapid wei ght gain shoul d be carefully investigated and appropriate treatment provided.  Interrupt, 
reduce the dose of, or discontinue ponatinib as outlined in Table 9.
14.2.1.10 Cardiac Arrhythmias
Supraventricular tachyarrhyt hmias were reported in patients treated with ponatinib.  Advise 
patients t o report si gns and symptoms of rapid heart rate (such as palpitat ions or di zziness).  
Symptom atic bradyarrhyt hmias have also been reported.  Advise patients to report signs and 
symptoms suggest ive of slow heart rate (including faint ing, dizziness, or chest pain; see Table 9).
14.2.1.11 Myelosuppression
Neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocy topeni a have been observed in clinical studies of ponatinib 
in patients with CML.  While myelo suppressio n can occur at any  time during treatment, its onset 
in CML pati ents m ost comm only occurs wi thin the first m onth of treatm ent.  My elosuppressi on 
can partially be attributed to the CML itself; however, treatment with p onatinib coul d also 
contribute.  These events can ty pically be m anaged wi th supportive care and, if believed by the 
investigator to be treatment -related, ei ther a reductio n or i nterrupti on of  treatm ent wi th ponat inib 
shoul d occur (see Table 9).  Rarely, one or more cy topenias can lead to perm anent 
discontinuat ion of treatm ent.  The use of hematopoiet ic growth factors, such as granulocyte 
colony-stimulat ing factor and granulocyte -macrophage co lony-stimulat ing factor, is permitted on 
study; these agents may be used to support blood counts as clinically indicated to minimize 
treatm ent interruptions or repeated dose reductions.
The important c linical AE of febrile neutropenia falls under the broad category of 
myelosuppressio n.  If a patient’s individual risk factors present a high risk of developing febrile 
neutropeni a, primary  prophylactic use of colony -stimulat ing growth factors for the preve ntion or 
reducti on of  febrile neutropenia is recommended, according to the published NCCN guidelines 
[NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2012 –Myeloid Growth Factors ].
14.2.1.12 Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)
The patients at risk of TLS are those with hi gh tumor/l eukemic burden prior to treatment.  These 
patients shoul d be m onitored cl osely, especially  at the ini tiation of treatm ent.  Appropriate TLS 
precauti ons and prophylactic treatment (such as aggressive hydrat ion with fluids and the

to the start of therapy  for those deem ed at ri sk.  Rasburicase and other appropriate treatments for 
hyperuricemia or TLS are permitted.
14.2.1.13 Rash and/or Pruritus
Skin rashes have been commo nly reported to be associated with ponat inib.  The vast majorit y of 
these skin events are nonserious —either self -limit ing or m anageable wit h ant ihistamines or 
topical steroi ds—and do not resul t in discont inuat ion.  In more severe cases, a short course of 
oral corti costeroi ds m ay be used unt il the rash has improved or resolved. 
In pati ents treated wi th ponatinib, the most commo n skin manifestations are a diffuse 
maculo -papular rash that is nonprurit ic and an acneiform dermatit is.  Occasionally, p atients 
treated with ponat inib have been reported to have a dry , flaky, or exfoliat ive type of rash or a 
psori asiform  dermat itis.  Rarely, an erythema mult iform e type of rash has been associated with 
ponatinib.
Most patients can be maintained on their curr ent dose of ponatinib, uninterrupted; if necessary, 
their symptoms can be managed wit h ant ihistamines, emo llients, or topical steroids.  If dose 
interrupti on is indicated, pati ents can resume the same dose of ponatinib —typically  without 
recurrence of sympt oms
—once the ori ginal episode has improved or resolved.  Interrupt 
administration in the case of serious or severe (grade 3 or 4) rash, and fo llow the dose 
modificati on guidelines for nonhematologic toxicit y in
 Table 9.
14.2.1.14 Diarrhea, Nausea, and Vomiting 
Diarrhea is a commo n side effect of ponatinib, and the use of antidiarrheal medicat ions is 
permitted.  Patients who experience ≥grade 2 dia rrhea may  begin l operamide at i ts standard 
treatm ent schedule (4 m g orally  
×1, then 2 m g orally  after each l oose stool , up to a m aximum  of 
16 m g/day).
Nausea and vo miting are also reported as side effects of ponatinib.  The use of an ant iemetic 
prophylact ically is not recommended.  However, if a patient is symptomat ic, appropriate 
antiemetic medicat ions may be used as clinically indicated.
14.2.1.15 Constitutional Symptoms/Joint Pain
Certain const itutional symptom s—such as myalgia, arthralgia, headache, weakness, fa tigue, 
asthenia, and low -grade fever —have been very  comm only reported wi th ponat inib.  These 
symptoms have been reported mainly  at the ini tiation of treatment, are ty pically  short-lived 
(<2weeks), and are seldo m, if ever, reported bey ond the fi rst m onth of treatm ent.  These AEs 
are m ost comm only l ow-grade (grade 1 and 2) and are self -resolving, without the need for dose 
interrupti on or dose reducti on, when they  do occur.  Most patients can be maintained on their 
current dose of ponatinib, uninterrupted, a nd their symptoms can be managed with a short course 
of oral analgesics, corti costeroi ds, and/or antipyretics as clinically indicated.  If dose interruption 
is indicated, patients can resume the same dose of ponatinib —typically  without recurrence of 
sympto ms—once the ori ginal  episode has ei ther improved or resolved.

05October 2020 Page 67of 11314.2.1.16 Compromised Wound Healing and Gastrointestinal Perforation 
Ponatinib may co mpromise wound healing.  Interrupt ponatinib for at least 1 week prior to major 
surgery .  The deci sion of when to resume ponat inib after surgery should be based on clinical 
judgment of adequate wound healing.
14.2.1.17 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)
PRES, al so known as reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndro me, is a neurological 
disorder that can pr esent with signs and symptoms such as seizure, headache, decreased 
alertness, al tered m ental  functioning, visio n loss, and other visual and neuro logical disturbances.  
No cases of PRES have been reported in clinical trials conducted by ARIAD, but two 
postm arket ing cases related to PRES have been reported in ponat inib-treated pati ents.  If PRES 
is diagnosed, interrupt ponatinib treatment and resume treatment only  once the event is resolved, 
and if the benefit of cont inued treatment outweighs the risk of PRES.
14.2.2 Dose Modifications for Adverse Drug Reactions
14.2.2.1 Dose Reduction Guidelines 
Dose reduction guidelines for ponatinib are summarized in Table 9, and AEs should be graded 
according to NCI CTCAE, v4.0. These guidelines should be fo llowed by  clinical invest igators; 
however, for an individual pat ient, dose interruptions, reductions, and treatm ent di scont inuat ion 
shoul d also be based on the clinical circumstance. Variat ion from these guidelines must be 
communicated with the sponsor or sponsor designee, ideally prior to implementation, but no later 
than 72 hours, and must be documented. Whe n the observed toxicit y has reso lved to ≤grade 1 or 
returned to baseline, the invest igator may resume dosing if clinically indicated. Guidance for 
re-escalation after resolut ion of adverse drug reactions is provided in Section 14.2.2.3 .
Dose reduction below 10 mg once -daily is not permitted in the Main Treat ment Period (see 
Table 9; a reduced dosing frequency  may be permitted in the Treatment Continuation Period in 
accordance with Sect ion14.1.5 )
.  Doses may be interrupted for study drug -related toxi cities for 
up to 28 day s.  If a nonhematologic, study  drug -related toxi city does not resolve to ≤ grade 1 or 
has not returned to baseline after dose interruption for more than 28 day s, the patient must be 
discontinued fro m study  treatm ent.  If a hematologic study  drug -related toxicit y does not resolve 
to ≤ grade 1 or has not returned to baseline after dose interruption for more than 28 day s, the 
sponsor’s medical mo nitor must be conta cted.  Addit ionally , the sponsor’s m edical  monitor m ust 
be contacted if any AE deemed unrelated to treatment requires dose interruption for more than 
28 day s.  
During dose interruptions, continue to observe the study schedule as planned ( Table 7and
Table 8).
Once adverse drug reactions have resolved when the guidelines below are followed, invest igators 
are encouraged to re -escalate the dose of ponatinib (Section 14.2.2.3 ).

All conco mitant m edicat ions administered fro m the time of informed consent signature through 
30 day s after End -of-Treatm ent (ei ther the last dose of study  drug or the invest igator/patient 
decisio n to discont inue, whichever occurs later) are to be reported on the appropriate eCRF for 
each patient.
14.4 Permitted Treatment
All routine and appropriate supportive car e (including receipt of blood products and 
hematopoiet ic growth factors) will be allowed during this study , as clinically  indicated, and in 
accordance with standard -of-care practices.  Clinical judgment should be utilized in the treatment 
of any AE experie nced by  an individual patient.
Inform ation on all concomitant medicat ions, administered blood products, and intervent ions 
occurring during the study  must be recorded on each pat ient’s eCRF.  Among other treatments 
for concurrent illnesses, the following th erapies are allowed:
Medical or surgical treatment necessary for the patient’s well -being 
Where appropriate, treatment with hematopoiet ic growth factors 
Where appropriate, hy droxyurea or anagrelide during the first cy cle of  study  drug 
administration (con comitant use must be discontinued by the end of the first cycle in all 
patients, and is thereafter prohibited)
14.5 Prohibited Treatment(s)/Therapy
The fo llowing concurrent medications and treatments are prohibited: 
Other anticancer therapies
Other invest igational drugs or devi ces
Medicat ions wit h a known risk of Torsades de Pointes (see Appendix A )
Herbal preparations or related over- the-counter preparations containing herbal 
ingredients 
Elect ive surgery requiring inpatient care t hat cannot be postponed unt il study  
completion
Medicat ions that are potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 (see Appendix B )
 shoul d be 
avoided, but are not prohibited (see Section 14.6).

risk of Torsades de Pointes, should be av oided, but are not prohibited.  If such medications are 
necessary  and used while a pat ient is on study , addi tional ECG m onitoring shoul d be perform ed 
as clinically indicated.
14.6 Potential Drug Interactions
Based on in vitro studies, drug- drug interactions due to either CYP inhibit ion or induct ion by 
ponatinib are highly  unlikely  in clinical  trials using the recommended daily  doses of 15 -45 m g.  
In vitro studies demonstrate that human CYP3A4 is invo lved in the metabolism o f ponatinib.  In 
light of this, a drug -drug interaction study  was perform ed wi th a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor in 
healt hy subjects, and ketoconazole co -administration was found to increase ponatinib C maxand 
AUC by 47% and 78%, respectively.  Another drug- drug interaction study  was perform ed wi th a
strong CYP3A4 inducer in healt hy subjects, and co -administration o f ponatinib fo llowing 
multiple doses of rifampin was found to decrease ponatinib C maxand AUC by 42% and 62%, 
respectively .  Since CYP3A4 contributes to the metabolism of ponat inib, strong inducers or 
inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be used wit h caution or avoided altogether.  If co -administration 
with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 is unavo idable, consider reduction of the ponatinib dose 1 
level fro m the current dose (that is, 30 mg for a patient receiving 45 mg; 15 mg for a patient 
receiving 30 mg).  Consider an alternative to the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or, if that is not 
possible, consult the sponsor.  Co- administration of strong CYP3A inducers with ponat inib 
shoul d be avoi ded unless the benefit outwei ghs the ri sk of  decreased ponat inib exposure.  
Patients shoul d be m onitored f or reduced efficacy  if co-administration with strong CYP3A 
inducers cannot be avoided.  Select ion of conco mitant medicat ion with no or minimal CYP3A 
induct ion potential is recommended.
Medicat ions that are associated with the prolongat ion of the QT interval may interact with 
ponatinib, as well.  Some medicat ions associated with QT prolongat ion also interact with 
CYP3A4.  
14.7 Treatment Supply

At a minimum, such text will include product name, product strength, number of tablets, and lot 
number.
14.7.2 Treatment Storage, Dispensing, and Accounta bility
Store ponatinib tablets at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursio ns permitted to 15°C to 30°C 
(59°F to 86°F). Keep away fro m children.  
The study  pharmacist or designee at the invest igative site will be responsible for handling and 
dispensing study  drug and complet ing associated documentary paperwork.
Supplies are shipped to the invest igative site at appropriate intervals, depending on patient 
accrual.  Supply shipping will be managed by  an interactive voice response system (IVRS).  The 
site must use either an appropriate dispensing log/accountabilit y form provided by the sponsor or 
an acceptable subst itute.  Each time study  medicat ion is dispensed for a patient, the fo llowing 
inform ation is recommended to be recorded: the patient’s init ials, the pati ent’s study  number, 
tablet strength, the number of tablets dispensed (with the corresponding lot number), and the 
initials of the person dispensing the drug.  These logs are to be maintained by the study  
pharmacist in the pharmacy throughout the duration o f the study , and will be periodically  
verified by a representative o f the sponsor.  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the 
patient diary  card(s) and study  drug provi ded to the pati ent and returned from the patient are 
accounted for and noted in source documentation.
In the event that a patient cannot visit the site to obtain the study drug due to unavo idable 
circumstances, such as the COVID -19 pandemic, sites should contact the study mo nitor/desi gnee 
to arrange for an alternate mechanism (eg, DTP Shipping).
14.7.2.1 Disposition of Used Supplies
All used bottles or packs of study  drug m ust be destroy ed in an appropriate manner according to 
the standard practice at each study  center.  Destructi on of  such supplies will be documented, and 
a representative of the sponsor will verify  disposi tion records.
During the trial and at termination, patients must return all unused study  drug supplies and the 
return of these unused study  drug supplies must be recorded.  Returned supplies must not be 
re-dispensed.
No other utilizat ion of ponatinib intended for use in this study  is authorized by the sponsor.  The 
principal investigator or his/her designee will be responsible for the appropriate handling and 
disposi tion of  residual study  drug.  Each site is responsible f or proper and careful destruction of 
study  drug returned by patients.
14.7.2.2 Inventory of Unused Supplies
Periodically  throughout and at the conclusio n of the study , a representative of the sponsor will 
conduct an inventory  of unused study  drug.  At the com pletion of the trial, a final study  drug 
accountabilit y review will be conducted.  Any discrepancies must be invest igated and all unused

15 ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
15.1 AEs
15.1.1 AE Definition
An AE is any  untoward m edical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily  have a causal  relati onship 
with this treatm ent.  An AE can be any  unfavorable an d unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal 
product, whether or not that sign, symptom, or disease is considered related to the medicinal 
product.  Any worsening of a pre -exist ing condit ion that i s tem porally associ ated wi th the use of 
the study  drug (e.g., occurs after the first dose of study  drug), i s also defined as an AE.
AEs include:
 Abnorm al test findings
 Changes in physical exam findings
 Other untoward medical events —regardl ess of their relat ionship to the study  drug —such as 
injury , events that requi re surgery , accidents, or apparent ly unrelated illnesses
 Hypersensi tivity
Addit ionally , AEs m ay include signs or symptoms result ing from:
 Drug overdose
 Drug withdraw al
 Drug abuse
 Drug misuse
 Drug interactions
 Drug dependency
 Exposure in utero
15.1.2 Abnormal Test Findings
The cri teria for determining whether an abnormal object ive test finding should be reported as an 
AE are as fo llows:
 Test resul t is associ ated wi th acco mpan ying symptom s that are considered clinically  
significant in the opinio n of the invest igator.
 Test resul t requi res addi tional diagnostic testing (other than merely  repeat ing an abnormal 
test) or m edical/surgical intervent ion.

05October 2020 Page 80of 113 Test resul t leads to a change i n study  drug dosing or di scontinuati on from the study , 
significant addi tional concomi tant drug treatment, or other therapy .
 Test resul t is consi dered to be clinically significant by  the invest igator or sponsor.
15.1.3 Performing AE Assessments
All observed or vol unteered AEs, regardl ess of dose cohort or suspected causal relat ionship to 
the invest igational product, will be reported as described in the fo llowing sect ions.
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain informat ion adequate to determine the 
outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classificat ion as a SAE (see 
Secti on 15.2.1 ) requiring immediate notification to ARIA D Pharmaceut icals, Inc. (ARIAD) or its 
designated representative.
15.1.4 Reporting Period
All AEs (serious, non -serious, and adverse events of special interest [AESIs]) should be recorded 
on the AE eCRF for all pat ients beginning at the time of signing the inform ed consent form  and 
concl uding 30 days following the last dose of the assigned study  treatm ent in the study  or the 
investigator/patient decisio n to di scont inue treatment, whichever occurs later. 
Once a pat ient is deemed a screen failure, AE collection is no longer required (see Section 12.2.1
Screen Failures). Any SAEs ongoing at the end of the reporting period should be fo llowed unt il 
they resolve to baseline, stabilize, or are considered to be chronic/irreversible. 
There i s no requi rement to m onitor subj ects f or SAEs after end of study . Invest igators in the 
European Economic Area (EEA) are obligated to report SAEs that they  become aware of, to the 
sponsor even after the reporting period (reference European Commissio n CT -3 Section 4.4). 
Invest igators outside the jurisdict ion of the EEA are encouraged to report SAEs after the 
reporting period. 
15.1.5 AE Severity
The severit y of AEs will be assessed according to the NCI CTCAE, v4.0 (see
 Appendix C and 
the Study  Reference Manual).  If the AE is not defined in the CTCAE, the investigator will 
determine its severit y based on the fo llowing definit ions:
 Mild (grade 1): The AE is noticeable to the patient but does not interfere with routine 
activit y.  
 Moderate (grade 2): The AE interferes with routine activit y but responds to symptomat ic 
therapy  or rest.  
 Severe (grade 3): The AE significant ly limits the patient’s abilit y to perform routine 
activit ies despite symptomat ic therapy.  
 Life-Threatening (grade 4): The patient is at immediate risk of death.
 Death (grade 5): The patient dies as a direct result of the complicat ion or condit ion induced 
by the AE.

05October 2020 Page 81of 11315.1.6 Causality
The invest igator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and nonser ious).  
An invest igator’s causalit y assessment i s the determinat ion of whether there exists a reasonable 
possibilit y that the invest igational product caused or contributed to the AE.
In addit ion, if the invest igator determines an SAE is associated with stu dy procedures, the 
investigator must record this causal relat ionship in the source documents and on the SAE form. 
The invest igator must report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requi rements.
The invest igator will use both medical cons iderat ion and the fo llowing categori es of causalit y to 
determine the relatedness of an AE to the study  drug (based on the definit ions below).  Not all 
criteria in each category  of relatedness must be present.
Definitely Not Related (not drug -related)
The p atient di d not receive study  drug

Rechallenge (if feasible) is posit ive
The AE shows a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of the test drug or a test 
drug class
15.1.7 Expectedness
The expectedness of an SAE is assessed by the sponsor in the overall classificat ion of SAEs for 
regul atory  reportabilit y.  The current Clinical Investigator’s Brochure will be used as the 
reference for determinat ion of expectedness and risk assessment for ponatinib.
15.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Adverse Events of Special Interests (AESIs)
The definit ions and reporting requirements of ICH Gui delines for Clini cal Safet y Data 
Management, Definit ions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2A , will  be adhered to 
in this study .
15.2.1 Serious Adverse Events Definition
The invest igator or sponsor may determine the seriousness of an AE based on the fo llowing.
An AE is considered an SAE if at least one of these condit ions applies:
Death: An AE that results in death is any  patient death wi thin 30 days of the last dose 
of study  drug administrati on.  The cause of death or AE that resulted in a fatal outcome 
is the SAE.
Life-threatening: An AE that places the patient, in the view of the invest igator or the 
sponsor, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (i.e., this does not 
include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused dea th)

05October 2020 Page 83of 113Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions : Any substantial disrupt ion of a patient’s abilit y to 
conduct normal life funct ions
Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization: Hospitalization 
refers to admission o f a pati ent into a hospi tal for any  length of time.
A congenital anomaly/birth defect: A fixed, permanent impairment established at or 
before birth
Cancer: Occurrence or diagnosis of a new can cer during thi s study  is considered an 
SAE.  A new cancer is a cancer that is histopathologically different than the cancer 
under study  in the tri al (i.e., does not include metastatic or progressive disease)
Important medical event: Medical and scient ific judgment shoul d be exercised in 
determining whether an event is an important medical event.  An important medical 
event m ay not resul t in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalizat ion.  However, 
if it is determined that the event may jeopardize th e pati ent and/or may  requi re 
intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definit ion above, that 
important medical event should be reported as serious.  Examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an Em ergency  Room  or at hom e for allergic bronchospasm, 
blood dyscrasias, or convulsio ns that do not result in hospitalizat ion, or the 
development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
15.2.1.1 Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of 
progression)
Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy  under study  shoul d be reported as AEs in 
the appropriate section of the eCRF.  Disease progressio n, assessed by  measurement of 
malignant lesio ns on radiographs or other methods, should not be reported as an AE.
15.2.1.2 Hospitalizatio ns
AEs (reported from clinical studies) that require hospitalization or prolongation o f 
hospi talizati on are considered serious.  Any  initial admissi on (even if less than 24 hours) to a 
healt h care facilit y meets these criteria.  AEs that require Emergency Room  care but do not result 
in hospi tal admissi on are not SAEs, unless assessed by the invest igator to be an important 
medical event.  Hospitalizat ion does not include the fo llowing:
Care in hospice facilit ies
Respite care
Care in skilled nursing facilit ies
Care in nursing ho mes
Routine Emergency Room admissions
Same-day surgeri es (as outpati ent/same -day/ambulatory  procedures)

05October 2020 Page 84of 113Hospitalization or prolongat ion of hospitalizat ion in the absence of a precipitating AE is not in 
itself an SAE.  Examples include:
Social admissi on (e.g., pati ent has no pl ace to sleep)
Protocol -specified admissio n during a clinical study (e.g., for a procedure required by 
the study  protocol )
Optional admissi on not associ ated wi th a preci pitating AE (e.g., for el ective surgery  
that wa s planned pri or to study  enrollment [appropriate documentation is required for 
these cases])
15.2.2 AESIs
AOEs and VTEs have been ident ified as AESIs for ponatinib.  These include arterial and venous 
thrombotic and occl usive adverse events that meet the criteria for SAEs, as defined above in 
Secti on15.2.1 , as well as those AEs that do not meet the SAE criteria.
AESIs require ongoing monitoring by invest igators and rapid ident ification and co mmunicat ion 
by the investigator to the sponsor.  The sponsor has determined that the events listed below 
shoul d be considered AESIs:
Myocardial  infarct ion (MI): The Third Universal Definit ion of Myocardial  Infarcti on 
(Thygesen et al , 2012 ) is used to define MI. The term "Acute MI" is used when there is 
evidence of myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with myocardial ischemia 
including any one of the following: 
oA rise and/or fall of cardiac bio marker values (preferably  cardiac troponin [cTn]) with 
at least 1 val ue above the 99thpercent ile upper reference limit (URL) and with at least 
one of the fo llowing:
Symptom s of ischemia
New or presumed new significant ST -segm ent T -wave changes or new left bundle 
branc h block (LBBB)
Development of pathological Q waves in the ECG
Imaging evidence of new loss of viable my ocardium  or new regi onal wall  motion 
abnorm ality
Ident ification of an intracoronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy.
oCardi ac death wi th symptoms suggest ive of myocardial ischemia and presumed new 
ischemic ECG changes or new LBBB, but death occurred before cardiac bio markers 
were obtained or would be increased.
oPercutaneous coronary  intervent ion-related MI was arbitrarily  defined by  elevati on of  
cTnvalues (>5 × 99th percent ile URL) in pat ients with norm al baseline values 
(≤99th percentile URL) or a rise of cTn values >20% if the baseline values were 
elevated and were stable or falling. In addit ion, either (1) sym ptoms suggest ive of

oCoronary  artery  bypass graft ing-related MI was arbitrarily d efined by  elevation of 
cardi ac bi omarker values (>10 × 99th percentile URL) in patients with normal 
baseline cTn values (<99th percent ile URL). In addit ion, either (1) new pathol ogical  
Q waves or new LBBB, (2) angiographic documented new graft or new nat ive 
coronary  artery  occl usion, or (3) imaging evidence of new loss of viable my ocardium 
or new regi onal wall m otion abnorm ality.
Angina (newly diagnosed or worsening of existing or unstable angina)
Coronary  artery  disease (CAD) (newly diagnosed or worsening of exist ing CAD) or 
symptoms that may  reflect cardi ovascular disease ( Thygesen et al, 2012)
Cerebrovascular ischemic disease, including ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, vascular 
stenosi s, TIA, cerebrovascular occlusive disease do cumented on diagnost ic neuro imaging, or 
symptoms that may  reflect cerebrovascular disease ( Easton et al, 2009 )  
New onset or worsening of peripheral artery  occl
usive di sease (e.g., of the renal artery , 
mesenteric artery , or f emoral artery ) or symptom s that may  reflect peri pheral  vascular 
disease 
Retinal vascular thrombosis, both venous and arterial
Venous thromboembolism that could result in significant compro mise of organ funct ion or 
other si gnificant consequences (e.g., pulmo nary embo lism, portal vein thrombosis, or renal 
vein thrombosis), or symptoms that may reflect venous thrombosis.
Addit ionally , the sponsor has a list of a broad range of nonspecific terms that could meet the 
criteria for AOEs and VTEs. The sponsor will peri odically l ook at the safety
 data and inform  the 
site if any AE qualifies for AOEs/VTEs as per that criteria. Dose modificat ion gui delines for 
AOEs/VTEs are presented in Section 14.2.2.2 .
15.2.3 Reporting SAEs 
The invest igator or invest igator’s designee must notify ARIAD Pharmacovigilance and Risk 
Management or its designated representative immediately (within 24 hours) after becoming 
aware of an SAE.  This t imeframe also applies to addi tional new inform ation (fo llow-up) on 
previously reported SAEs.

05October 2020 Page 86of 11315.2.4 Information to be Provided by the Investigator for an SAE 
The sponsor requires all o f the following informat ion about the patient and the event:
Invest igator iden tification
Patient identificat ion code (e.g., sex, age, date of birth)
Inform ation on study  drug (e.g., start/stop date, dose and frequency  of study  drug 
administered)
Descript ion of event.
In addit ion to the above information, the sponsor will require the invest igator’s assessment of the 
following:
Severit y of the SAE 
Relationship of the SAE to the study  drug
Outcom e of the SAE. 
15.2.5 Follow -up Information on a SAE 
Appropriate diagnostic tests should be performed and therapeutic measures, as medically 
indicat ed, shoul d be inst ituted.  Appropriate consultation and fo llow-up evaluat ions should be 
carried out until the event has resolved or is otherwise explained by  the investi gator.  F or all  
SAEs, the invest igator is obligated to pursue and provide informat ion to the sponsor.  In addit ion, 
an invest igator may be requested by the sponsor to obtain specific informat ion in an expedited 
manner.  This informat ion may be more detailed than that captured on the AE form.  In general, 
this informat ion will include a descr iption of the AE, provided in sufficient detail to allow for a 
complete m edical assessment of the case and independent determination o f possible causalit y.  
Inform ation on other possible causes, such as concomitant medication and illnesses, must also be 
provided.
Required Follow -up for SAEs 
Routine fo llow-up shoul d be conducted through and including 30 days after the last 
administration of assigned study  treatm ent in the trial or the investigator/patient decisio n to 
discontinue treatm ent—whichever occurs later—in all pat ients, in order to monitor for the 
occurrence of SAEs.  If an SAE continues after the 30 -day evaluat ion peri od, the pati ent m ust be 
followed unt il the event resolves to baseline, stabilizes, or is considered to be 
chronic/irreversible.  The medical mo nitor may specify  a longer foll ow-up peri od if required to 
assure the safet y of the pati ent.

ARIAD or authori zed designee will be re sponsible for the submissio n of safet y letters to central 
independent ECs (IECs).
The sponsor will notify invest igators of all reportable SAEs.  This notificat ion will be in the form 
of an expedited safet y report.  Upon receiving such notices, the invest igator m ust revi ew and 
retain the notice with other study -related docum entati on.
The invest igator and IRB/EC will determine whether the informed consent requires revisio n.  
The invest igator should also comply wit h the IRB/EC procedures for reporting any othe r safet y 
inform ation.

within 7 days prior to first dose of ponatinib, and again at the End -of-Treatm ent Visi t.  A 
negat ive pregnancy test must be docum ented pri or to administration of study  drug.
Females should be advised to take a pregnancy test if their period is late, and to inform their 
investigator of the result.
If a patient is confirmed pregnant during the trial, study  drug administration must be 
discontinued immediately .  The invest igator must also immediately notify the sponsor medical 
monitor of  this event and record the pregnancy on a Pregnancy  Form.  Initial informat ion 
regarding a pregnancy must be immediately  forwarded to ARIAD Drug Safety  and 
Pharmacovigilance or its designated representative.
The invest igator must immediately report follow -up informat ion to the sponsor regarding the 
course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcomes, regardless of whet her the 
patient has discont inued participation in the study.  If the pregnancy results in the birth of a child, 
additional follow-up inform ation may be requested.  If the pregnancy results in spontaneous 
aborti on or stillbirth, that event should be reporte d as an SAE.
Pregnancy outcomes must also be collected for the female partners of any males who took study  
drug in this trial.  Consent to report informat ion regarding these pregnancy outcomes should be 
obtained fro m the female partner.
15.3.2 Overdose
An overdos e is defined as the accidental or intent ional ingest ion or i nfusing o f any dose of study  
treatm ent that exceeds the dose described in the protocol.  Overdoses are not considered AEs; 
however, all overdoses should be recorded on an Overdose Form and forward ed to ARIAD 
Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management or its designated representative wit hin 24 hours.  An 
overdose should be reported even if it does not result in an AE.  Overdoses do not need to be 
recorded on the eCRF; dosing information is recorded on th e form .  
16 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS
16.1 General Considerations
For the purposes of this protocol and all analyses, unless otherwise specified, a month is defined 
as 28 days, the same l ength as a cycle of treatment for ponatinib. 
Eligible CP -CML patients wil l be rando mized to 3 dose cohorts (45 mg, 30 mg, and 15 mg).  
Patients starting at 45 mg or 30 mg will have their daily  dose reduced to 15 m g upon 
achievement of ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS.  Each cohort of patients will be analyzed separately  for 
efficacy  and safety .
Categorical data will be summarized by the number and percentage of patients in each category .  
Continuous variables will be summarized by descript ive statist ics, including mean, standard 
deviat ion, median, and range.
Statistical inference will be made fo r each of the 3 cohorts separately —each wi th the primary  
endpo int of ≤1% BCR -ABL1IStested at 2 -sided 0.05/3=0.0167 significance level, using the

≤1% BCR -ABL1ISwill be perform ed using a 2 -sided exact 98.3% CI for ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS
rate based on the ITT populat ion followed through the Main Treatment Period. Any  other 
comparisons will be descriptive. An interim analysis (IA) is planned for this study  after all 
patients have been enrolled in the study . The IA data summary  will be descri ptive in nature. The 
primary  analysis is planned to be performed when all patients have at least 12 months of  
treatm ent. Addi tional analyses may be performed at later time points to d evelop addit ional CSRs 
as per sponsor's discretion. In addit ion, the data will be summarized and reported at least 
annually.
16.2 Analysis Populations
ITT Population: The ITT population will include all rando mized pat ients, regardless of whether 
they take the a ssigned study  drug.  The primary  analyses of efficacy  will be based on thi s 
popul ation.  Rando mized patients without response assessments will be considered as non -
responders in the primary  efficacy  analysis (see Secti on16.5.2.1 ).
Treated Population: The treated populat ion for each cohort includes all pat ients who have 
received at least one dose of study  drug.  The primary  analyses of safet y will be based on this 
popul ation.
Per-protocol Population: The per -protocol population includes all pat ients who are 
rando mized, receive at least 1 dose of study  drug, and have no major protocol vio lations that 
could be expected to impact response d ata (such as failure to satisfy 1 or more eligibilit y criteria, 
administration of other ant icancer therapy concurrent with study drug, or administration of 
incorrect dose [e.g., dose that was not the one to which the patient was rando mized]).  Major 
protoc ol violations will be finalized and documented prior to database lock.

Exploratory Endpoints
16.4 Determination of Sample Size
The primary endpoint for this trial is ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISat 12 months.   Consistent with the 
phase 2 PACE trial, the null or uninteresting ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISrate is set at 20%.  The 
alternative ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISrate is set at 35%.  Using the Bonferroni method, the over all 
2-sided significance level for statis tical testing in each cohort w ill be set at 0.0167.  The primary 
analysis of the primary endpoint of ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISwill be performed using a 2-sided exact 
98.3% CI for ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISrate based on the ITT population.
A total sample size of 276 patients or 92 patients in each cohort (1:1:1) will distinguish a 
favorable ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISrate of 35% from a null or an uninteresting ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISrate 
of 20% with a nominal 80% power and a 1-sided type I error rate of 0.0083 (equivalent to a 
2-sided 0.0167) using an exact binomial test.  Using the 20% boundary for ≤1% BCR-ABL1IS, 
29 or more ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISresponders will be needed for a lower limit of the 2-sided exact 
98.3% CI for the ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISrate to exceed 20%.

Gender
Other ri sk factors 
16.6.2 Analysis of Categories of AEs
Categories of AEs will be prospectively defined using Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQs) 
or Modified MedDRA Queries based on SMQs and M edDRA Sy stem  Organ Classes (SOCs).  
The AE crude rates, as well as the frequency  of occurrence by  overall  toxicity—categori zed by  
toxicity grades (severi ty)
—will  be described for each cohort.  Events will also be characterized 
by time to onset, dose at ons et, and durati on, as described above.  Further details will be outlined 
in the SAP.
16.6.3 Other Safety Analyses
For all TEAEs and SAEs, crude rates as well as the frequency  of occurrence by  overall toxici ty, 
categori zed by  toxicity grades (severit y) 
- will be de scribed for each cohort.  List ings of 
laboratory  test resul ts will  be generated, and shifts in laboratory  param eters f rom baseline to 
worst post -baseline value (in terms of NCI CTCAE, v.4.0 grades) will be summarized.  
Maximum shift from baseline in blood pressure and mean change from baseline over time will 
be summarized.  Exposure to study  drug over time will also be summarized.

For each dose cohort, numbers and percentages of patients who discontinue treatment due to 
AEs; who have any dose reduction from the starting dose due to AEs; or who have dose 
interruption of at least 3 days will be provide d.  Number of days at each dose level and time to 
first dose reduction due to AE will be summarized in order to characterize length of dose 
interruptions a nd reductions.
16.7 Exposure-Response Analysis 
The plasma concentration-time data will be listed and summarized by time point. These data will 
contribute to population PK and exposure-response analyses of safety (e.g., AOE incidence) and 
efficacy (e.g., MMR). The analysis plan for the population PK and exposure-response analyses 
will be defined separately and the results of these analyses will be reported separately. 
16.10 Protocol Deviations/Violations
To be protocol-compliant, a patient must not have any major protocol deviations during the study 
period.  Protocol deviations will be identified prior to database lock, and will be listed by dose 
cohort in the Clinical Study Report (CSR).
Protocol deviations related to the COVID-19 pandemic will be assessed and listed 
independently.  Additional sensitivity analy ses may be performed to evaluate the impact of 
protocol deviations related to COVID-19 on the primary efficacy and safety endpoints.

05October 2020 Page 98of 113inform ation recorded in the eCRFs will be verified against source document s.  The sponsor’s 
medical mo nitor will review the data for safet y inform ation.  The sponsor’s clinical data 
associ ates or desi gnees will review the data for legibilit y, com pleteness, and logical consistency.  
Addit ionally , the sponsor’s clinical data assoc iates will use automated validat ion program s to 
help identify missing data, selected protocol vio lations, out -of-range data, and other data 
inconsistencies.  Requests for data clarificat ion or correcti on will be added to the electronic 
database and reviewe d by the investi gational si te for resol ution.  The sponsor may  visit the 
investigat ional site and perform a qualit y check of the eCRFs against source documents.
17.1 Investigators and Study Administrative Structure
The invest igator must provide the sponsor with the following documents before enrolling any 
patients:
An executed Clinical Trial Agreement
FDA Form  1572
Docum entati on of  financial disclosure
Principal investigator’s Curriculum Vitae
IRB/EC approval o f the protocol
IRB/EC -approved consent form
If any i nvest igator retires, relocates, or otherwise withdraws fro m conduct ing the study, the 
responsibilit y for maintaining records may be transferred to another person (e.g., sponsor, 
IRB/EC, or other invest igators) who accepts the responsibilit y.  The sponsor m ust be notified in 
writing o f and agree to the change in advance.  An updated FDA Form 1572 will be filed wit h 
the sponsor and the FDA for any  changes in the study  personnel reported in the current FDA 
Form  1572.
17.2 Study Monitoring
This study  will be m onitored by  representatives of the sponsor.  Site visits are made before the 
study  begins, at regul ar intervals during the study , and at the study  closeout.  Communicat ion by 
telephone, m ail, and e -mail may be used, as needed, to supplement site visits.  The inv estigator 
and study  personnel will cooperate with the sponsor, provide all appropriate documentation, and 
be available to discuss the study .  The purpose of the site visits is to verify:
Adherence to the protocol (the invest igator should document and expla in any deviat ion 
from the approved protocol)
The completeness and accuracy of the eCRFs and the dispensing and inventory  record 
(adequate time and space for these visits should be allocated by the invest igator)
Com pliance wi th regul ations (the verificat ionwill require comparison of the source 
docum ents to the eCRFs)

05October 2020 Page 99of 113In the event that a monitor cannot visit the site in a timely manner due to the COVID -19 
pandemic, alternat ive monitoring approaches such as remote source data verificat ion or 
telephone contact m ay be used to ensure data quality  and integri ty and maintain pat ient safet y. 
Alternat ive monitoring approaches should be used as approved by the sponsor, and only where 
allowed by  thelocal Heal th Authori ty, local privacy  laws (where applicable), and the IRB/IEC.
18 ETHICAL CONDUCT OF THE STUDY
This study  will be conducted in accordance wit h the ethical standards that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and that are consisten t with GCP gui delines and the applicable 
regul atory  requi rements.
18.1 Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee Approval
The protocol and the informed consent document must have the init ial and at least annual 
(when requi red) approval  of an IRB/EC.  The signed IRB/EC approval letter must identify the 
docum ents approved (i .e., list the invest igator’s name, the protocol number and title, the date of 
the protocol and informed consent document, and the date of approval o f the protocol and the 
inform ed consent document).  Any advert isements used to recruit patients should also be 
reviewed by  the IRB/EC.  The sponsor will not ship clinical supplies unt il a signed approval 
letter from the IRB/EC has been received and a Clinical Trial Agreement has been signed by the 
sponsor and the clinical site.
18.2 Patient Information and Consent
Regulatory  agencies have i ssued regul ations to provide protection for human patients in clinical 
investigat ions and to describe the general requirements for informed consent.
A copy  of the study  site’s proposed inform ed consent docum ent shoul d be submitted to the 
sponsor for review and comment before submissio n to the IRB/EC.  The study  shoul d not begin 
until the document has been reviewed by the sponsor, and must not begin unt il the documen t has 
been approved by the IRB/EC.  In some instances, the study  must not begin unt il the document 
has been approved by  a regulatory  agency.
The informed consent document shall contain all of the elements of the informed consent 
specified in the regulat ions.  Som e regulat ions may require the disclosure of addit ional 
inform ation to the pati ent and/or inclusio n of additio nal information in an informed consent 
docum ent.
Nothing in this protocol or the regulat ions is intended to limit the authorit y of a physici an to 
provi de em ergency medical care under applicable regulat ions.  In addit ion, the investigator 
shoul d be aware that som e regulati ons requi re that he/she permit regulatory  agencies to conduct 
inspections and review records pertaining to this clinical inv estigation.
18.3 Patient Confidentiality
All unpublished information that the sponsor provides to the investigator, as well as all 
inform ation generated in connect ion with the study, m ust be kept confident ial and must not be 
disclosed to a thi rd party  without the prior written consent of the sponsor.  In addit ion, thi s

the Clinical Trial Agreement.  
18.4 Study Committees
18.4.1 Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)
An independent DMC , consist ing of 3 to 5 members not associated with the conduct of the study, 
will be established for this trial.  The committee will perform data review quarterly  and meet at 
least twice yearly  until  the final  analysis has been performed, as specified in t he protocol.  Ad-
hoc DMC meet ings may also be held if a significant issue should arise.  
The DMC will be responsible for evaluat ing the results of safet y analyses and making 
recommendat ions to the sponsor.  Efficacy data can also be requested, if needed, to eval uate 
risk/benefit before making a recommendation.  The DMC will operate under the DMC charter, 
which specifies the data to be included in each review, rules related to study  modificat ion, and 
protecti on of  the integri ty of the data.  At each m eeting , the DMC will make reco mmendat ions to 
either continue the study  unchanged, to modify  the study , or to discont inue the study.  The DMC 
will co mmunicate the recommendat ions to the sponsor.  The final decisio n to act on the DMC 
recommendat ions will be made b y the sponsor in consultation wit h the Study  Steering 
Committee.   
18.4.2 Study Steering Committee
A steering committee will be const ituted wi th initiation of  the study .  Its purpose is to funct ion in 
an advisory  capaci ty to: 1) provi de input on study  conduct an d progress; 2) ensure scient ific and 
ethical integri ty of the study; and 3) provide ongoing oversight of safet y and efficacy  in this 
open -label study .  The steering committee will include clinicians who are experts in the clinical 
care and invest igation ofthe targeted patient population, and will also include sponsor 
representatives.  In addition to general study  oversight, the committee will be responsible for 
periodic review of study  data to eval uate the safet y profile of ponatinib, assess accumulat ing 
signals of efficacy, evaluate data qualit y, and provide input on operational aspects of the study .  
The committee may  make recommendat ions for the sponsor’s consideration based on periodic 
review. 
18.4.3 Cardiovascular Endpoint Adjudication Committee
The cardiova scular endpo int adjudicat ion committee (CVEAC) will be composed of independent 
experts with experience and training appropriate for reviews of the CV, AOE, HF, and VTE 
endpo ints. They  will review all CV events defined as AOEs, HF, and VTEs reported by  the sites 
(i.e., ini tial diagnoses, l aboratory  values, resul ts of procedures, hospital discharge summaries) to 
determine the occurrence of CV endpo ints and sites may be requested to send relevant source 
data to the sponsor representative for this purpose. The adjudicati on of  these events will be 
perform ed based on the CVEAC adjudicat ion charter, whi ch will docum ent details for 
performing adjudicat ion. The CVEAC’s assessment of each potential CV endpo int will be 
docum ented in the clinical database and will be us ed in the endpo int analysis. The process will

This study will be a randomized, open- label, multi- center, study evaluating the PK and safety of 
the new formulation compared to the currently- approved formulat ion of oritavancin.  
Approximately 100 subjects at about 5 centers will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the currently 
approved formulation of oritavancin versus the new formulation. Fifty (50) subjects will be administered the currently approved formulation of oritavancin, using the approved dosing regimen in which SWFI is used for reconstitution and D5W is used for further dilution to a final volume of 1000 mL. This formulation will be infused over 3 hours per the approved label. An additional fifty (50) s ubjects will be administered the new formulation of oritavancin. This 
formulation will also be reconstituted with SWFI  and further diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride to 
a final volume of 250 mL. This formulation will be infused over 60 minutes. 
Informed consent will be obtained from subjects before the initiation of any study- specific 
procedures. Subjects will be screened up to 48 hours prior to the initiation of study drug. 
Subjects will receive their dose of oritavancin on Day 1 and will be ask ed to return to the study 
center on Day 2, Day 4, Day 8 and Day 15 for collection of additional blood samples and procedure assessments. The subject ’s participation is approximately 17 days.  
Safety of the new formulation of oritavancin will be assessed acc ording to AEs and SAEs, 
clinical laboratory parameters (including Direct and Indirect Coombs development and oritavancin antibody assay as applicable), and vital signs . 
This is an unblinded, open label study. The primary endpoint is based on a pharmacokine tic 
assessment, a measurement that is not subject to interpretation bias.  
The schedule  of study assessments is provided in Table 1 , and PK sampling time points are 
provided in Table 2 .

8.1. Sample Size  Determination  
Using combined results from selected Phase 1 studies on oritavancin pharmacokinetics with the 
approved formulation, the observed CV of AUC 0-72 and AUC 0-168 were 25.4% and 26.3%, 
respectively. Using a slightly larger CV value of 30% to be conservative, the table below shows estimated power values in a parallel study design to demonstrate equivalence of AUC of the new 
formulation (test, T) relative to the appr oved formulation (reference, R), assuming various true 
T/R ratios of geometric means of AUC
0-72 and AUC 0-168. The table uses a sample size of 
100 subjects randomized in 1:1 ratio to the test and reference groups and uses the standard 80% 
to 125% equivalenc e limits. A study design of 50 subjects in each of the test and reference 
groups should have ≥  ~90% power to demonstrate AUC equivalence, if the true T/R ratios are 
within 0.95 to 1.05.  
True T/R Ratio  Power  
0.95 89.5%  
1.0 96.7%  
1.05 90.2%  
8.2. Randomization  
With a sample size of approximately 100, subjects will be randomized in 1:1 ratio in a parallel 
fashion to the test (new formulation) and reference (approved formulation) groups. 
8.3. Analysis Population  
8.3.1. Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
All subjects randomized  will be  analyzed according to the  treatment arm  to which they were 
randomized. Subject disposition, demographic, and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment using the ITT population 
8.3.2. Pharmacokinetics (PK) Population  
All subjects who have received the full dose of oritavancin and have one  valid sample measured 
for study drug levels. The PK population will be the primary population for the PK analysis.  
8.3.3. Safety Population  
All subjects who have received any amount of IV oritavancin  will be included in the safety 
population. Treatment group will use it as actually received.  The safety population will be the 
primary population for all the safety analyses.

Confidential   Page 14 of 24  8.4. General Statistical Considerations and Definitions  
8.4.1. Software   
All data listings, summaries and statistical analyses will be generated using SAS® Version  9.4 or 
above, or equivalent statistical software.  PK analysis (including the calculation  of PK parameters 
such as AUC, C max, T1/2, etc.) will use WinNonlin or relevant softwa re, and will be performed by 
PK vendor . 
8.4.2. General Statistical Methods  
All study -collected data will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics, 
graphs, and/or raw data listings. Unless otherwise specified, descriptive statistics for continuous 
variables will include number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, quartiles 
(Q1 and Q3), minimum (min) and maximum (max) values. Analysis of categorical variables will 
include frequency and percentage. For the summary by visit anal ysis, graphic display using box-
whisker or mean +/ - standard error plot will be generated.  
8.4.3. Analysis Windows and Baseline  
All data collected in the study will be included in the analysis. Unless otherwise specified, the 
last evaluation prior to the initiation of study drug will be considered the "Baseline" evaluation for analysis. For microbiologic assessments, any pathogen identified from within 72 hours prior to screening up to and including Day 2 will be considered as baseline.  
8.4.4. Missing Data Handling  
Unles s otherwise specified, missing data will not be imputed and will be excluded from the 
associated analysis.  
Partial dates :  Dates missing the day of the month, or both the day and month of the year will 
adhere to the following conventions:   
• The missing day of onset of an adverse event or  start date of a concomitant medications 
will conservatively be set to the earlier of:  
 first day of the month that the event occurred, as long as it is after the date of the start of first treatment  
 one day after the first d ose, if this is the same month that the event occurred  
• The missing day of resolution of an adverse event or end date of a concomitant medications will be set to the last day of the month of the occurrence.  
• If the onset date of an adverse event or start date of a concurrent therapy is missing both the day and month, the onset date will be set to the earliest of:  
 January 1 of the year of onset, as long as it is after the first dose  
 one day after the first treatment, if this is the same year that the event occurred

Confidential   Page 15 of 24  • If the resolution date of an adverse event or end date of a concomitant medications is 
missing both the day and month, the date will be set to:  
 December 31 of the year of occurrence, if the patient is continuing treatment  
 The date of patient  discontinuation, if the event is not ongoing 
8.5. Statistical Analyses  
8.5.1. Subject Disposition  
A disposition table will summarize the number of patients screened, randomized, treated, discontinued from study treatment and reasons for discontinuation from study and study drug by treatment groups. The table will define the ITT, PK, and Safety Populati ons. Indicator variables 
(Yes/No) will be presented in listings to identify the population flag. The reason for discontinuation from study and study drug will be summarized using the categories specified in the case report form (CRF), by treatment group.  
8.5.2. Demographic and B aseline  Characteristics  
Subject demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment  groups  using 
the ITT population. Unless the PK, and Safety population is significant ly different from  the ITT 
population (>  5% in tota l number of patients), the demographic and baseline characteristics table 
will not be duplicated. 
Demographic and baseline variables will include:  
• Age  
• Sex 
• Race  
• Ethnicity  
• Height  
• Weight  
• BMI  
• ABSSSI Disease Status  
Baseline pathogens and medical/surgical history will also be summarized.  
8.5.3. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Summary of each prior medication , and concomitant medication will be provided by treatment 
group separately for the safety population. Medication will be coded with World H ealth 
Organization Drug Dictionary Enhanced (WHO Drug March 1, 2019 )
2 and summarized using 
ATC Level 4 and generic drug names . Subjects will be counted only once within each period by 
medication.

Melinta Therapeutics, Inc.  Version 2.0, October 7, 2019 
Confidential   Page 16 of 24  8.5.4. Study Drug Exposure  
Extent of exposure including dose amount and duration of treatment (minutes) will be 
summarized for the Safety po pulation. The number and percentage of subjects who completed 
treatment, and who experienced dose interruptions and discontinuations will be summarized for 
the Safety population. 
All study drug administration data will be presented in a listing.  
8.5.5. Safety Ana lysis 
Safety will be assessed according to adverse clinical events, clinical laboratory evaluations 
(including Coombs anti -globulin tests and oritavancin antibody assay, as applicable), and vital 
signs. For each safety parameter, the last assessment made p rior to the first dose of study drug 
will be used as the baseline value for all analyses.  
 Adverse Events  
The MedDRA Version 2 2.03 or later will be use d for coding AEs. Adverse events (AEs) will be 
graded using the 5- point Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria 
(Version 5)1. An AE (classified by preferred term) occurring from the start of study drug will be 
counted as treatment emergent AE (TEAE) either if it was not present at baseline or if it was present at baseline but increased in severity during the period of observation.  
An overall summary of subjects reporting a TEAE in each treatment group will be provided for 
the Safety population. This analysis will include: the number and percentage of subjects 
report ing any TEAE, any TEAE presented by maximum severity, any TEAE related to study 
drug, any SAE, any SAE related to study drug, any SAE leading to premature discontinuation of 
study drug, any SAE with an outcome of death, any TEAE leading to study discontinuation, any 
TEAE leading to study drug discontinuation or interruption, and any TEAE of special interest 
will be summarized for the Safety population.  
The number  and (percentage) of subjects reporting TEAEs for each preferred term will be 
tabulated by syste m-organ class, by system -organ class and severity, and by system -organ class 
and relationship to study drug. A summary of TEAEs occurring in ≥  5% (or >=2 subjects) of 
either formulation group (based on MedDRA preferred term) sorted by decreasing frequency in 
the new formulation arm  will also be provided. Likewise, the number and percentage of subjects 
reporting a serious TEAE and reporting a study- drug related SAE in each treatment group will be 
tabulated separately by system organ class and preferred term.  Likewise, summaries of TEAEs 
leading to study discontinuation or study drug discontinuation or interruption will also be 
provided by system organ class and preferred term. For all analyses of TEAEs i f the same event 
(based on preferred term) occurred for the same subject  more than once , the subject will be 
counted only once for that preferred term using the most severe or related occurrence for the summary by severity, or relationship to study drug, respectively.  
A listing of all serious TEAEs will be prov ided and will include subject ID, study day(s) of 
event, duration of study drug administered prior to onset (minutes), system organ class, preferred 
term, verbatim term, severity, relationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, and outcome.

 Laboratory Tests  
Laboratory values presented will include: serum chemistry, hematology, direct/indirect Coombs test, and oritavancin antibody assa y. Descriptive statistics (number of subjects with a reported 
value, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) will be presented for quantitative laboratory 
parameters . Laboratory data will be summarized by visit using descriptive statistics (including 
absolute values and change from baseline). F or qualitative laboratory parameters, tables will 
display the number of subjects with a reported value and percentage in each category. Laboratory results will be classified as low (L), normal (N), or high (H) according to the laboratory -supplied 
reference ranges from the local lab oratorie s. 
There will be separate data listings for each category of laboratory test results. Subjects with values above or below the reference range, regardless of clinical s ignificance, will be identified 
in the data listings with flags for high and low values. Potentially clinical ly significant (PCS)

  Analysis of Coombs Test  
Coombs Test (Indirect and Direct) results (positive or negative) will be summarized by treatment 
group, including changes from baseline (negative to positive) at each scheduled time point.  A 
shift table from baseline to worst chang e (negative to positive) post -baseline will be generated.  
Subjects with missing data  for a given visit will not contribute to the summary statistics for that 
visit.  
 Vital Signs  
Systolic and Diastolic blood pressure  (mmHg) , heart rate (beats/minute , bpm ), respiratory rate  
(breaths/minute , rpm ), and temperature (° F) will be collected at Screening/Baseline, Day  1 (post -
dose) , Day 2, Day 4, and Day 8 and Day 15. Body height and weight will be collected at 
Screening/Baseline only.  
Vital sign measurements and changes from baseline will be summarized descriptively at each 
scheduled timepoint and overall worst post -baseline (maximum and/or minimum) by treatment 
group. The number and percentage of subject s with treatment- emergent PCS changes wi ll also be 
summarized by treatment group at each scheduled time point  and overall w orst post -baseline 
(which will include values from unscheduled post -baseline visits).  
A treatment -emergent PCS  vital sign  is defined as : Baseline value is within the  normal  range and 
the post -Baseline value is PCS. Table 4  provides definitions for PCS vital sign values. For each 
treatment -emergent PCS  vital sign , if criteria in both directions  (low and high)  are shown for a 
single parameter, then abnormalities in each direction will be  summarized separately.  
Table 4:  Criteria for Potentially Clinically Significant Vital Signs Values  
Vital Sign  Direction  Criterion  
Systolic blood pressure  Low Value ≤ 90 mmHg and decreased ≥ 20 mmHg from Baseline value  
 High  Value ≥ 180 mmHg and increased ≥ 20 mmHg from Baseline value  
Diastolic blood pressure  Low Value ≤ 50 mmHg and decreased ≥ 15 mmHg from Baseline value  
 High  Value ≥ 105 mmHg and increased ≥ 15 mmHg from Baseline value  
Heart Rate  Low Value ≤ 45 bpm and decreased ≥ 10 bpm from Baseline value  
 High  Value ≥ 120 bpm and increased ≥ 15 bpm from Baseline value  
Respiratory Rate  Low Decreased ≥ 6 rpm from Baseline value  
 High  Increased ≥ 6 rpm from Baseline value  
All vital sign data collected during the study will be presented in a listing including an indication 
of whether each value is PCS.  
8.5.6. Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
All the pharmacokinetic analys es including the calculation of PK parameters and comparison 
between the two formulations, will be performed by the Melinta designated vendors. This section will just show what PK analysis will be included, all the TFLs related to PK will be provided by a separate report from the vendor.

Melinta Therapeutics, Inc.  Version 2.0, October 7, 2019 
Confidential   Page 20 of 24  Oritavancin p lasma (blood) concent ration versus time data will be analyzed using 
noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis. The following pharmacokinetic parameters will be 
estimated where possible (additional parameters may be calculated):  
• Area under the plasma concentration -time curve (A UC) from time zero to 72  hr 
(AUC 0-72), time zero to 168 hr (AUC 0-168), time zero to the time of the last measurable 
concentration (AUC 0-last) and , where possible, AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC 0-inf) 
• Maximum observed measured plasma concentration (C max) 
• Time of observed C max (Tmax) 
• Elimination half - life (t ½) 
• Total body clearance (CL)  
• Volume of distribution at steady state (V ss) 
All concentration data will be presented descriptively for each formulation at each time point. All pharmac okinetic parameters will be summarized  by formulation for the PK population. 
Descriptive statistics comprise N, mean, geometric mean, SD, SEM, median, %CV, minimum and maximum. 
A general linear model (GLM) will be used to evaluate the relative AUC exposure of the new 
formulation (test) relative to the approved formulation (reference) based on a two- group parallel 
design. The primary PK parameters (AUC
0-72 and AUC 0-168) will be natural- logarithmically 
transformed and used as the dependent variable. The independent variable includes formulation. For each PK parameter, the estimate of the treatment difference (test minus reference) and the upper/lower bound of its 90% confidence interval (CI) will be obtained from the general linear model, and then exponentiate d to obtain the ratio of the geometric means and its 90% CI in the 
original scale.  
Bioequivalence can be demonstrated if the 90% CI in the original scale is within the range of 
80% to 125%. 
8.5.7. Subgroup Analysis  
No subgroup analysis is planned.  
8.5.8. Interim Analysi s 
No interim analysis is planned.

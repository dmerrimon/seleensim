Rationale Rationale for Combination of High-Dose Testosterone w ith Nivolumab in Metastatic 
Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Patients 
 
Bipolar Androgen Therapy (BAT) a lone: BAT is a paradoxical appr oach for the 
treatment of mCRPC whereby testosterone levels are rapidly cycl ed between 
supraphysiologic and near-castra te concentrations. Based on pri or studies, the 
incidence of germline mutations in DNA-repair genes in mCRPC pa tients is ~12% with 
somatic DNA-repair mutations a pproaching 20-25%.  Interestingly , we have identified 
a correlation between  long-term (“exceptional”) responders to B AT and the presence 
Bipolar Androgen Therapy and Nivolumab in mCRPC IRB00164973 
Johns Hopkins University  
 5 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 of mutations in homologous-recom bination DNA repair genes.  In Teply et al. ( Eur	Urol , 
2017), we report the case of a pa tient with mCRPC who achieved a durable (>24 mo) 
complete radiographic and serolo gic response following treatmen t with BAT.  DNA 
sequencing found inactivating mutations in both BRCA2  and ATM , which were 
confirmed on germline DNA testin g.  We are currently sequencing  tumor/germline 
DNA from other “exceptional” res ponders to BAT, and remarkably,  we have found DNA 
repair mutations in 5/6 extreme responders.  These unpublished findings suggest a 
relationship between responses to BAT and the presence of mutat ions in DNA-repair 
genes.       Checkpoint Blockade alone: Two randomized phase III trials invo lving single-agent 
checkpoint (CTLA-4) inhibitors i n mCRPC patients did not meet t heir primary 
endpoints.  However, a small subset (~20%) of mCRPC patients di d derive clinical 
benefit.  In pilot studies conduc ted at Johns Hopkins, we have observed dramatic 
responses to checkpoint inhibition in those patients with DNA-r epair defects.  For 
instance, two patients (#1: MSH6 -mutated; #2: BRCA2 -mutated) achieved a PSA 50 
response following combined PD-1/ CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibition.  A third mCRPC 
patient (#3: ATM -mutated) achieved a partial rad iographic RECIST response.  A f ourth 
patient (#4: POLH -mutated) also had a RECIST resp onse.  Similar to the efficacy of 
checkpoint inhibitors in patients with MSI-High colon cancer, w e speculate that a 
benefit of immunotherapy may be observed in those mCRPC patient s with germline 
and/or somatic mutations in DNA-repair genes.   BAT/Immunotherapy Combination: Even more notably, we have obser ved two mCRPC 
patients with intact DNA repair processes (i.e. no repair gene mutations) that were 
treated initially with BAT and su bsequently achieved dramatic P SA/RECIST responses 
to PD-1 checkpoint inhibition.  Patient #1 achieved a PSA 50 response to BAT which 
lasted 11 months before developi ng subsequent PSA progression.  Upon starting 
nivolumab in combination with an anti-CD73 inhibitor, his PSA l evel dropped from 692 
ng/mL to 3 ng/mL in the first 12 weeks with an associated clini cal benefit.  Patient #2 
also achieved a PSA 50 response to BAT lasting 6 months.  Following subsequent 
treatment with checkpoint inhibi tion, his PSA dropped from 56 n g/mL to 4 ng/mL with 
a partial radiographic response after only 3 months of therapy.  As mentioned, neither 
patients had a DNA-repair mutation although both benefited dram atically from PD-1 
inhibition. Further study of BA T with nivolumab is warranted.

Johns Hopkins University  
 6 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 Correlatives/Tertiary: 
 To estimate the percentage of patients with somatic (tumor) or germline 
(inherited) mutations in homologo us repair (HR) and/or mismatch  repair 
genes. 
 To measure IHC-based changes in gamma-H2AX, RAD51, 53BP1 (DNA d amage 
markers) following treatment with BAT and at progression on BAT /nivolumab. 
 To measure changes in CD4, CD8, FOXP3, Ki-67, PD-1, PD-L1 tumor  levels with 
BAT alone and at progressi on following BAT/Nivolumab. 
 To investigate any association be tween PD-1 and PD-L1 expressio n in tumor 
specimens and PSA 50 response rates. 
 To explore the relationship between mutation-associated neoanti gen (MANA) 
and tumor-associated neoantigen (TAA) assays and clinical outco mes. 
 To characterize the effect of BA T on production of inflammatory  chemokines 
and cytokines. 
	
Study design The study is an open-label, singl e arm, Phase II trial. Eligible patients are men with 
mCRPC.  All patients must have a r ising PSA and/or radiographic  progression and prior 
treatment with at leas t one novel AR targeted therapy (i.e. abi raterone acetate, 
enzalutamide), and up to one pri or chemotherapy agent for mCRPC  is permitted. A 
mandatory tumor biopsy will be p erformed prior to the start of therapy in all patients. 
A second, mandatory tumor biopsy  will take place after three mo nths of therapy with 
BAT alone.  A third, OPTIONAL bi opsy will be performed followin g PSA and/or 
radiographic progression on BAT/Nivolumab. 
After enrollment, patients will be treated with testosterone cy pionate 400mg IM every 
4 weeks for a lead-in period of 12 weeks.  Patients will be fol lowed monthly with clinic 
visits, safety labs (including CBC w/ Diff, CMP), PSA, and toxi city assessments.  After 
the lead-in period, all patients  will be treated with nivolumab  480mg IV every 4 weeks 
and maintained on testosterone cypionate 400mg IM every 4 weeks .  Treatment [with 
a minimum drug exposure of 12 we eks] will be continued until PS A progression 
(PCGW3 criteria) or clinical/radi ographic progression (whicheve r comes first), or until 
unmanageable toxicity requirin g drug cessation.  Patients will continue a GnRH 
analogue during the study or h ave undergone orchiectomy.

Exploratory Analyses 
 Estimate	the	Percentage 	of	Patients	with	a	Pathogenic 	Somatic	or	Germline 	Mutation 	in	a	
HR	or	MMR	Gene	Mutations: 	
The somatic DNA mutations present in the tumor will be identifi ed through Foundation 
Medicine sequencing.  Germline DN A mutation testing per standar d of care practice will 
be done using clinical-grade test ing in a CLIA-certified labora tory prior to the start of 
treatment for consenting subjects only. Patients with a germlin e and/or somatic 
deleterious alteration in the pr e-specified gene list (BRCA1, B RCA2, ATM, CHEK2, NBN, 
RAD50, RAD51C, RAD51D, PALB2, M RE11, FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD 2, FANCE, 
FANCF, FANCG, FANCI, FANCL, FANC M, MLH1, MLH3, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6 , PMS1 and 
PMS2) will be considered biomarker positive. For biomarker posi tive and biomarker 
negative subjects, w e will calculate PSA
50 response rates with confidence intervals for 
hypothesis generation.   		PD‐1,	PD‐L1,	FOXP3,	CD4,	CD8,	γH2AX,	RAD51,	53BP1	Protein	Levels:		
Subjects will have pretreatment,  on-treatment (and at progressi on) tumor biopsy 
specimens analyzed.  IHC staining for PD-1 and PD-L1 will be pe rformed on the 
pretreatment samples and scored as <1%, 1-5%, 5-10%, >10% and t he results will be 
associated with responses for both proteins, separately, using descriptive statistics and 
Fisher’s Exact Tests.   Immunofluorescence will be used to quan tify the median intensity 
of each gamma-H2AX, RAD51 and 53B P1 foci per cell as well as de termine the median 
number of foci per cell on the p retreatment biopsies.  Using an alytical microscopy, Drs. 
Meeker and Heaphy have developed  imaging software, which can is olate single nuclei 
and quantify both the in
tensity and number of immunofluor escent foci per nucleus (i.e. 
per cell). Using FFPE tissue obta ined at biopsy, we will examin e the change in DNA 
damage foci number and intensity  (reported as median percent ch ange) induced by 
BAT/Nivolumab in PSA 50 responders versus non-respond ers using a T-test.  Using 
imaging software, we will count the number of CD4+ and CD8+ lym phocytes in pre-
treatment and on-treatment bi opsies. We will correlate PSA 50 responses with CD4+ and 
CD8+ lymphocyte tumor infiltration.

 9 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 Interrogate 	for	Mutation ‐associated 	Neoantigens 	(MANAs) 	and	Tumor‐associated 	
Neoantigens 	(TAAs):	
Whole-exome sequencing will be p erformed on pre-treatment sampl es, after 12 weeks 
of BAT lead-in therapy, and post -progression tumor and matched normal samples. 
Exome data will be appl ied in a neoantigen prediction pipeline that evaluates antigen 
processing, MHC binding, and gen e expression to generate neoant igens specific to the 
patient’s HLA haplotype. Truncal neoantigens will be identified  by correcting for tumor 
purity and ploidy. Putative-neoa ntigens will then be used to ge nerate peptides and 
stimulate autologous T cells, fo llowed by TCR nex t-generation s equencing. 
	To	Characterize 	the	Effect	of	BAT	on	Production 	of	Inflammatory 	Chemokines 	and	
Cytokines: 	  
Milliplex human cytokine/chemokine Immunology Multiplex Assay ( Millipore-Sigma) 
will be used to assay acute effe cts of BAT on production of cyt okines and chemokines.  
Plasma samples are obtained at s creening, 3 hours after the fir st testosterone injection, 
3 days after the first testosterone injection, Cycle 2 Day 1, a nd Cycle 7 Day 1. Analysis 
will be performed by the Immune Processing Core Lab at Johns Ho pkins. 
 
Statistical method Primary Analysis 	
The primary endpoint of this study is PSA 50 response, defined as a decrease in the PSA to 
≥ 50% less than the baseline PSA upon enrollment in the trial. The decrease must be 
confirmed by a second measurement at least 4 weeks apart. For p urposes of meeting the 
primary endpoint, patients will be considered to  have done so i f they have a PSA 50 
response either while on therapy with BAT alone (during lead-in ) or BAT in 
combination with Nivolumab (combination phase).  PSA values wil l be measured 
monthly during the trial.  All patients who take at least one d ose of BAT (during lead-in) 
will be considered evaluable for t he primary endpoint. If patie nts do not have at least 
one follow-up PSA after initiation of BAT due to stopping thera py for toxicity or 
withdrawing consent, then they will be replaced. PSA 50 response rate will be estimated 
along with 95% confidence interval.  Secondary Analysis 	
Safety:  
Patients will be assessed for toxi cities at each clinical evalu ation. Toxicities will graded 
according to current CTCAE stand ardized grading scales.  The in cidence of grade 3-5 
toxicities will be reported to the lead site and to BMS. Patien ts will be assessed for 
toxicity as long as they are tak ing BAT alone or BAT in combina tion with Nivolumab, 
and patients will continue to be  followed if treatment is disco ntinued for toxicity until 
the toxicities improve to grade 1 or resolve. Toxicities will b e reported as a tabulated 
table by type and grade. 
	
PSA	Progression ‐free	Survival	(PSA‐PFS) : 
A standard definition of PSA progression per PCWG3 will be used . PSA-PFS will be 
defined as an increase in 25% over a nadir value, confirmed by a follow-up PSA at least 4 
weeks later. If patients are removed from the study prior to PS A progression, then they 
will be censored at that time.  W e will use the Kaplan-Meier me thod to summarize the 
median PSA-PFS.  Progression ‐free	Survival	(PFS):	
Bipolar Androgen Therapy and Nivolumab in mCRPC IRB00164973 
Johns Hopkins University  
 10 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 Progression-free survival will be measured from the time of the  first dose to objective 
clinical or radiographic tumor progression as defined by PCWG3 for progressive disease 
or death, and summarized using a  Kaplan-Meier curve. Progressio n will be assigned to 
the earliest observed time. Patients whose disease has not prog ressed at follow-up will 
be censored at the date when the last tumor assessment determin ed a lack of 
progression.  We will use the Kaplan-Meier method to summarize the median PFS. 
	
Objective 	Response 	Rate	(ORR):	
The objective response rate is de fined as the percentage of pati ents who achieve an 
objective response by RECIST 1.1 criteria (i.e. Complete respon se or Partial Response) 
to BAT alone or BAT in combination with Nivolumab. We will estim ate the objective 
response rate, along with the exa ct 95% confidence interval, fo r the population of 
patients with RECIST-evaluable disease.   
Durable	Progression ‐free	Survival	(durable‐PFS):	
Durable PFS will be defined as th e proportion of patients witho ut clinical or 
radiographic progression, as defi ned by PCWG3, or death for at least 24 weeks from the 
start of treatment. 
Overall	Survival	(OS):	
Overall survival will be defined  as the time from study enrollm ent to death from any 
cause up to 2 years after the last dose of study treatment.  Th is will be summarized 
using a Kaplan-Meier curve. 
 
Sample Size/Power Calculation: 
The sample size is calculated to detect an improved PSA 50 response rate from 25% (null 
hypothesis) to 45% (alternative) . A minimax Simon two stage des ign is planned. A total 
of 23 patients will be entered i n the first stage. A planned an alysis will be performed 12 
weeks after the last patient in the first stage receives the fi rst dose of nivo lumab.  If ≤ 5 
subjects have a PSA 50 response, the study will be terminated and we will conclude th e 
regimen is ineffective (i.e. not  more effective than BAT alone) . If ≥ 6 subjects respond in 
the first stage, then an additi onal 16 patients will be enrolle d, for a total of 39 patients.  
If a total of ≤ 13 subjects resp ond in stage one and two combin ed, we consider this 
regimen ineffective. I f a total of ≥ 14 re spond, we will conclu de that the regimen is 
promising and warrants further study. A total of 44 patients wi ll be enrolled to account 
for a 10% possible dropout rate  and unevaluable patients.  
 This design provides 90% power t o detect an abso lute 20% increa se in PSA response 
rate with a one-sided type I erro r of 0.1. The ch ance of early stopping for futility is 0.49 
if PSA
50 response rate is 25%. 
 
Safety analysis Standard safety summaries will be provided for treatment exposure, patient disposition, 
adverse events leading to discontinuation, serious adverse even ts, and all events 
resulting in death, including tho se up to 100 days after treatm ent discontinuation. The 
incidence of adverse events will be tabulated and reviewed for potential significance 
and clinical importance.

1.1	Disease	Background 	
 
Prostate cancer is the most comm only diagnosed non-cutaneous ma lignancy in men, with 
an estimated 180,000 cases annually in the United States (1).  It is the second most common 
cause of cancer mortality in the  United States as well, with ov er 26,000 deaths in 2016 (1).  
The discrepancy betwee n the incidence and mortality numbers dem onstrate its potential 
curability if treated while disease is local, as well as the no n-lethal nature of some cancers, 
even if not treated definitively.  While many men are cured of their disease, many others 
will unfortunately progress to inc urable and lethal metastatic disease. 
 1.1.1	Clinical	States	of	Prostate	Cancer	
 
The course of prostate cancer fr om diagnosis to death is best c ategorized as a series of 
clinical states (Fig. 1). These states are defined by the exten t of disease and status of 
responsiveness to hormonal therapy. Therapies have been develop ed for specific states, as 
each state presents unique risks to the patient and different r esponsiveness of the disease 
to therapy. 
 
  Figure 1.  Clinical states of prostate cancer (2)  
 
1.1.2		Metastatic 	Castration ‐Resistant 	Disease	State	
 Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the backbone of treatment  for metastatic prostate 
 cancer,  and while ADT is initi ally highly effective, prostate  cancers invariably adapt to a 
 low-testosterone environment, leading to castration resistance . Studies have  demonstrated 
 that castration-resistant prosta te cancer (CRPC) remains depen dent on AR signaling. Based 
 on this understanding, several drugs have been developed and F ood and Drug 
 Administration (FDA)-approved f or the treatment of mCRPC, incl uding abiraterone acetate 
 and enzalutamide. How ever, we have observed in multiple clinic al studies a paradoxical 
 effect of high dose testosterone resulting in both PSA and rad iographic responses in 
 patients with mCRPC.

1.2.1	Description 	and	Mechanism 	of	Action	
 Testosterone cypionate is the oil-soluble form of the androgeni c hormone, testosterone. A 
paradoxical inhibition of cell gr owth has been observed in both  androgen-sensitive and 
CRPC cell lines following the addi tion of high-dose testosteron e.(3,4) Several mechanisms 
underlying this paradoxical resp onse to androgens have been ide ntified. First, our group 
and others have showed that AR m ay be involved i n DNA relicensi ng during cell cycle 
progression.(5-7) Under normal c onditions, AR is degraded durin g the cell cycle. Our group 
found that the AR protein is stabilized in the presence of supr aphysiologic levels of 
androgen and remains bound to or igins of replication.(5-7) This  binding inhibits 
progression through th e cell cycle, leading to cell death. Seco nd, androgen-starved prostate 
cancer cells up-regulate both fu ll-length AR and AR splice vari ants as a survival mechanism. 
The addition of high-dose androg en to the growth media results in the down-regulation of 
these AR splice variants (including AR-V7), potentially re-sens itizing these cells to 
ADT.(8,9) Third, we have shown t hat following androgen starvati on, exposure of CRPC cells 
to high-dose androgen induces double-strand (ds) DNA breaks, re sulting in cell growth 
inhibition and decreased clonogen ic survival.(10)  Mechanistica lly, high-dose androgen has 
also been shown to induce structu ral genomic rearrangements/tra nslocations in CRPC cells, 
including the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion.(11) 	
  Nivolumab (also referred to as BMS-936558, MDX1106, or ONO-453 8) is a human 
 monoclonal antibody (HuMAb; immunoglobulin G4 [IgG4]-S228P) th at targets the 
 programmed death-1 (PD-1) clust er of differentiation 279 (CD27 9) cell surface membrane 
 receptor. PD-1 is a negative regulatory molecule expressed by activated T and B 
 lymphocytes. Binding of PD-1 to its ligands, programmed death– ligands 1 (PD-L1) and 2 
 (PD-L2), results in the down-re gulation of lymphocyte activati on. Inhibition of the 
 interaction between PD-1 and its ligands promotes immune respo nses and antigen-specific 
 T-cell responses to b oth foreign antigens as well as self-anti gens. Nivolumab is expressed in 
 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and is produced using standa rd mammalian cell 
 cultivation and chromatographic  purification technologies. The  clinical study product is a 
 sterile solution for parenteral administration.    
OPDIVO (nivolumab) is approved for the treatment of several typ es of cancer in multiple 
 regions including the United States (US, Dec-2014), the Europe an Union (EU, Jun-2015), and 
 Japan (Jul-2014). Nivolumab is a lso being investigated in vari ous other types of cancer as 
 monotherapy or in combination with other therapies, and as sin gle-dose monotherapy for 
 the treatment of sepsis.  
	1.2.3					Preclinical 	Studies		
 
High-dose testosterone, also ref erred to as Bipo lar Androgen Th erapy (BAT): 
The mechanisms underlying the growth-suppressive effects of hig h levels of androgens in 
prostate cancer cells in vitro an d in vivo is likely highly com plex. Recent evidence from our 
group suggests that one mechanism may involve the formation of androgen-induced 
Topoisomerase II beta (TOP2B)-medi ated double strand breaks at AR target genes (Figure 
2).(10) Studies have shown that estrogen signaling in breast ca ncer cells involves the co-
recruitment of Estrogen receptor and TOP2B to estrogen receptor  target sites, where 
Bipolar Androgen Therapy and Nivolumab in mCRPC IRB00164973 
Johns Hopkins University  
 15 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 TOP2B introduces transient doubl e strand breaks. We hypothesize d that such a mechanism 
may be involved in androgen sign aling in prostate cancer cells and that at high doses of 
androgens, such breaks may persi st and ultimately lead to growt h suppression. In support 
of this, we observed that stimul ation of androgen-deprived LNCa P cells with 
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) led to recruitment and catalytic acti vity of TOP2B at AR target 
sites in the TMPRSS2 enhancer as well as at other known AR targ et sites. At high doses of 
DHT, this TOP2B recruitment and c atalytic activity was associat ed with significant 
formation of AR and TOP2-dependent persistent double strand bre aks at the TMPRSS2 
gene, as observed by fluorescenc e in situ hybridization (FISH) assay which is capable of 
detecting genomic breaks on an i ndividual cell basis.(10) Such breaks likely occurred 
throughout the genome at AR target sites since we observed nume rous γH2A.x foci, a 
marker for double strand break formation, throughout the nucleu s in response to 
stimulation of LNCaP cells with high-dose DHT (Figure 2). In fu rther confirmation of this, 
we also observed recruitment of ATM, a double strand break repa ir signaling protein, to AR 
target sites in PSA and TMPRSS2, genes present on different chr omosomes in the cell. These 
findings suggest that exposure o f prostate cance r cells from pa tients with CRPC to high 
doses of testosterone may induce growth suppression due to the accumulation of androgen- 
mediated, TOP2-induced doubl e strand DNA breaks.(10)

Bipolar Androgen Therapy and Nivolumab in mCRPC IRB00164973 
Johns Hopkins University  
 16 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 Recently, the Denmeade laborator y has explored a mechanism for growth inhibition by 
testosterone (T) in CRPC cells. These studies document that the  increase in AR expression 
observed in these cells in the low T environment creates a uniq ue therapeutic vulnerability 
to selectively kill CRPC cells. This is based upon the fact tha t AR is involved in DNA 
relicensing and DNA replication and AR must be degraded in each  cell cycle for proper 
relicensing to occur. Overstabili zation of the increased levels  of AR observed in CRPC with 
supraphysiologic testosterone pre vents complete d egradation of AR via the proteasome 
during mitosis. This was demonstr ated by in vivo treatment of r esistant human LNCaP 
prostate cancer xenogr afts with T implants to achieve supraphys iologic serum T- levels.(5) 
This treatment resulted in significant growth inhibition (Figur e 3a). These growth-inhibited 
cells had similar amount of cells with nuclear AR in the nucleu s and Ki-67 positivity (Figure 
3a). However, in xenografts trea ted with supraphysiologic T, th e Cell Death Index was ~ 3- 
fold higher.(5) More strikingly,  the percent of cells staining positive for AR in mitosis was 
approximately 10-fold higher in cells exposed to supraphysiolog ic T versus castrate-only 
animals (Figure 3b). This data s uggests that CRPC cells that ha ve not properly relicensed 
DNA, can die when they attempt to  proceed through a subsequent cell cycle. Thus, based on 
this proposed mechanism, prostate cancer cells that maintain hi gh AR levels will be 
vulnerable to cell death when exp osed to supraphysiologic T con ditions due to their 
inability to rapidly auto-regulate AR to lower levels. Due to t he bipolar cycling between high 
and low serum T achieved with BAT, those cells that do manage t o survive the high T 
environment through adaptive down-regulation of AR will become vulnerable to cell death 
when suddenly exposed to low T conditions that occur over the c ycle of BAT.

 Nivolumab: 
Tumors can express tumor-specific  antigens as a result of mutat ional burden, and ongoing 
immune surveillance is believed to control the development of m any tumors. Tumor 
progression may depend on the acqu isition of mechanisms that pe rmit them to evade an 
effective immune response. One such mechanism of evasion may be  the expression of 
ligands, which engage inhibitory receptor(s) on anti-tumor T ce lls of many tumors. PD-L1 

Bipolar Androgen Therapy and Nivolumab in mCRPC IRB00164973 
Johns Hopkins University  
 17 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 expression has been found on a number of tumors and may be a me chanism by which 
tumors can directly engage PD-1 to evade an effective anti-tumo r immune response.(12-14) 
Expression of IFN-γ by activated T cells is known to induce PD- L1 expression in tumors.(15) 
PD-L1 expression has been associat ed with poor prognoses in ren al,(16-18) 
esophageal,(19) gastric,(20) ova rian,(14) pancreatic,(21) and l ung cancers.(22)  PD-1 
engagement on T cells by PD-L1-po sitive APC or PD-L1-positive t umor cells in the tumor 
microenvironment may limit effective immune responses. Converse ly, PD-L1 expression 
may be a positive prognostic fac tor as it may indicate infiltra tion of tumor-specific T cells 
that secrete IFN-γ, which up-regulates PD-L1 expression. Consis tent with this hypothesis is 
the co-localization of lymphoid cell infiltrates and PD-L1 stai ning observed in human 
melanoma lesions.(23)  Studies in multiple tumor models  using a chimeri c murine anti-m ouse PD-1 antibody 
showed that PD-1 blockade has anti-tumor activity.(24) Blocking  PD-1 in PD-L1-positive 
tumors may reverse the inactivat ion of tumor-specific effector T cells at the tumor site, as 
well as activate anti-tumor responses that are limited by PD-L1  expression on “host” DC or 
APC. The anti-tumor effects of anti-PD-1 observed in several mu rine models suggest that 
both PD-L1-positive and PD- L1-n egative tumors may be targeted using this approach. In 
addition, in several tumor models in which anti-PD-1 has proved  ineffective, PD-1 blockade 
can be combined with vaccines or other immunomodulatory antibod ies for improved 
therapeutic efficacy.(25-27) PD- 1 blockade by Nivolumab is a pr omising avenue to pursue 
as an anti-tumor therapy for rec urrent or treatm ent-refractory malignancies.  
 1.2.4				Clinical	Studies	
BAT: 
Up until recently, there had been very limited clinical experie nce in the PSA-era treating 
CRPC patients with testosterone. Brendler et al. (1949) at the Brady Urological Institute 
reported in the Archives of Surgery on the use of parenteral te stosterone in several men 
with advanced CRPC.(28) They obs erved considerable improvement in several men that 
included decreased pain, decreas ed prostate size, and decreases  in acid and alkaline 
phosphatase. In a second study, Prout and Brewer (1967) reporte d in Cancer on the 
treatment of men who had been either untreated or recently cast rated or long term 
castrates with parenteral testos terone.(29) Five relapsed patie nts in the long term castrate 
group received testosterone for a t least one month and 4 of 5 h ad subjective improvement. 
Five remaining patients in the long term castrate group receive d testosterone for 1-19 days, 
with each progressing and subsequently coming off therapy. Acid  phosphatase declined in 
2/5 men receiving a longer cours e of testosterone. Remarkably, one man in this group 
admitted to hospital with severe back pain, weakness, and anore xia had a 10 month 
response with complete cessation of pain, excellent appetite, a nd weight gain with a 
decrease in acid phosphatase from 50 to 5 units.  
In contrast, a number of studies  during the 1960-70s evaluated the use of T-priming in 
combination with 32P-sodium phos phate to treat men with CRPC an d severe pain due to 
widespread bony metastases.(30,31 ) In these studies, initial T- priming using a variety of 
parenteral dosing regimens was associated with transient increa se in bone pain during the 
first week followed by excellent  pain palliation following admi nistration of 32P. Similar 
results were observed in studies led by Manni who evaluated T- priming with 
chemotherapy in the 1980’s.(32) These studies were also conduct ed in men with CRPC and 
Bipolar Androgen Therapy and Nivolumab in mCRPC IRB00164973 
Johns Hopkins University  
 18 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 pain due to widely metastatic disease. In these studies, increa sed bone pain was also 
observed in men upon initial tre atment with oral androgens. The  increased pain in these 
studies typically occurred within  days of T administration. Thu s, given this time frame, it is 
likely the increased pain was du e to T-stimulation of inflammat ion/cytokine release within 
sites of bone metastases rather than a direct effect on tumor g rowth. Such rapid change is 
also seen in men with bone pain upon initially starting ADT. Ma rked improvement in pain 
after ADT often occurs within ho urs of treatment, an effect not  due to tumor death but 
rather a rapid change in expressi on of pain-promoting gene prod ucts.  
Two contemporary Phase I studies were reported describing the r esults of the use of 
transdermal T as therapy for men  with CRPC who had minimal to m oderate disease burden 
and no pain due to prostate cancer. In the first study, Szmulew itz et al. (2009) evaluated the 
effect of increasing doses of tra nsdermal T in 15 men with earl y CRPC (rising PSA and 
minimal bone disease).(33) Five men each were treated with 2.5,  5.0 or 7.5 mg/day of 
transdermal T which brought the median concentration of T from castrate to 305, 308, and 
297 ng/dL respectively. In this study, no grade 3 or 4 toxiciti es were observed with the 
exception of one man who was taken off study at week 53 for gra de 4 cardiac toxicity. Only 
one patient had symptomatic pro gression and three patients (20% ) had a decrease in PSA 
(largest was 43%). Patients treated at the highest T dose had a  prolonged time to 
progression that did not reach sta tistical significance, most l ikely due to the small cohort 
size. In the second study, Morris et al. (2016) evaluated the e ffect of transdermal T at a dose 
of 7.5 mg/day administered for 1 week (n=3), 1 month (n=3) or u ntil disease progression 
(n=6) in 12 patients with CRPC.(34) They observed no grade 3 or  4 toxicities and no pain 
flares. Eugonadal serum T levels  were reported for this study. No objective responses were 
observed. Four patients had at least 20% declines and one achie ved a > 50% PSA decline.  
Neither of these Phase I studies achieved the supraphysiologic levels of serum T that can be 
reached with FDA-approved doses o f T administered as an intramu scular depot.(35) 
However, the levels of serum T achieved were in the high-end of  the eugonadal range. 
Remarkably, although the studies  were considered “negative” fro m the standpoint of 
disease response, in both studies  the administration of parente ral T to men with CRPC was 
very well-tolerated and did not r esult in significant worsening  of disease or symptoms, 
including pain flares. While only one patient out of 27 from th e combined studies had a 
reported > 50% decline in PSA, s maller PSA declines were observ ed in a few of the patients 
on these two studies with a trend  toward a dose-responsive effe ct, suggesting a potential for 
therapeutic benefit in some patients.(33,34)

Based on the preclinical results and potential me chanisms for g rowth inhibition that include 
androgen-induced double strand b reaks and the stabilization of AR preventing relicensing, 
we have conducted a pilot study evaluating the efficacy and saf ety of pharmacologic doses 
of testosterone to produce supra physiologic T le vels in conjunc tion with oral etoposide (E) 
in chronically castrated men with  rising PSA and CRPC (Figure 4 a).(36) Patients who had 
been continuously castrate for more than one year with minimal metastatic disease burden 
(≤ 5 total bone metastases and ≤  10 total sites of metastases),  and/or rising PSA were 
eligible (Figure 4b). To achieve rapid cycling between supraphy siologic and near-castrate 
serum T, patients rece ived an intramuscular injection of 400 mg  testosterone cypionate (i.e. 
BAT) every 28 days. For the firs t 3 cycles of therapy, patients  received BAT plus oral 
etoposide 100 mg PO/day, days 1-14 of a 28 day cycle. After 3 c ycles, PSA and objective 
responses were assessed. Those patients with a PSA that was dec lining from peak levels and 
no objective evidence of diseas e progression or worsening pain were continued on therapy. 
Given the toxicity associated with etoposide and the lack of cl inical response in an earlier

 20 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 trial,(37) patients who were res ponding after 3 cycles of testo sterone plus etoposide were

Seven of fourteen patients had a decline in PSA from baseline v alue (Figure 5a). An eighth 
patient progressing after testosterone treatment for 6 months, had a decline in PSA upon 
reaching castrate-level testoste rone. Non-responders came off t rial after 3 cycles due to PSA 
progression. Overall, three patte rns of PSA response were obser ved (Figure 5b). For the 
seven patients that had a PSA de cline, the median time to PSA p rogression was 221 days 
(range, 95 to 454 days).

Nivolumab 
This updated Investigators Broch ure (IB) references the most re cent USPI and EU SmPC as 
the basis for the current state o f knowledge on Nivolumab for u se in humans with cancer. 
The approved USPI and SmPC are p rovided in Appendix 1 and Appen dix 2 of the IB, 
respectively. The USPI and SmPC summarize Nivolumab monotherapy  clinical data for 
melanoma (based on CA209037 and CA209066), SQ NSCLC (based on C A209063 and 
CA209017), NSQ NSCLC (based on CA209057), RCC (based on CA20902 5), Classical 
Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL; based on CA209205 and CA209039), and uro thelial carcinoma 
(UC; based on CA209275 and CA209032), as well as clinical data for Nivolumab in 
combination with Ipilimumab for melanoma (based on CA209004, CA 209069, and 
CA209067). In addition, the USPI describes Nivolumab monotherap y clinical data for 
SCCHN (based on CA209141). Data f rom clinical studies that are relevant to ongoing clinical 
investigations in oncology that are not in the approved USPI an d SmPC or to subjects with 
sepsis are included in  this updated IB.  
The PK, clinical activity, and sa fety of Nivoluma b have been as sessed in approximately 75 
clinical studies sponsored by BM S or ONO. The description and s tatus of studies with 
reference safety information are provided in Appendix 4 of the IB. Across those studies, 
approximately 16,900 subjects have received Nivolumab monothera py in single- or 
multiple-dose Phase 1/2/3 studies or studies with Nivolumab in combination with other 
therapeutics (Ipilimumab, cytoto xic chemotherapy, anti-angiogen ics, and targeted 
therapies). Results from the ongoing studies are preliminary an d are subject to change.  
Nivolumab has demonstrated clini cal activity in NSCLC, melanoma , RCC, cHL, SCCHN, UC 
(approved indications) and other tumor types (Section 5.4 of th e IB) as monotherapy or in 
combination with Ipilimumab or o ther therapeutics. The majority  of responses were 
durable and exceeded 6 months. In  randomized-controlled studies , Nivolumab 
monotherapy demonstrated statist ically significant improvement in OS over standard-of-
care in subjects with advanced o r metastatic melanoma, subjects  with advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC, subjects with advanced RCC, and subjects with  recurrent or metastatic 
SCCHN.  In randomized-controlled studies, Nivolumab in combinat ion with Ipilimumab 
demonstrated statistically signi ficant improvement in PFS and O RR over Ipilimumab 
monotherapy in subjects with adva nced or metastatic melanoma.  
All available data suggest that Nivolumab monotherapy has a con sistent AE profile across 
tumor types. The safety profil e is generally consistent across completed and ongoing clinical 
trials, with no maximum tolerate d dose (MTD) reached at any mon otherapy dose tested up 
to 10 mg/kg. There was no pattern in the incidence, severity, o r causality of AEs to

consistent with the mechanisms o f action of Nivolumab and Ipili mumab. The nature of the 
AEs was similar to tha t observed with either agent used as mono therapy; however, both 
frequency and severity of most AEs were increased with the comb ination. A dose of 3 
mg/kg Nivolumab/3 mg/kg Ipilimumab exceeded the MTD, and both 1  mg/kg 
Nivolumab/3-mg/kg Ipilimumab and  3 mg/kg Nivolumab/1 mg/kg Ipil imumab were 
identified as the MTD. Across all studies conducted to date, dr ug-related AEs have included 
pulmonary toxicity, renal toxici ty (including acute renal failu re), endocrine abnormalities, 
GI toxicity, dermatologic toxici ty (including rash), and hepato toxicity. For Nivolumab 
monotherapy and combination thera py, the majority of these AEs have been managed 
successfully with supportive care  and, in more severe cases, a combination of dose delay, 
permanent discontinuation, and/or use of corticosteroids or hor mone replacement therapy 
(endocrinopathies) as instructed in the management guidelines p rovided in Appendix 3 of 
the IB.  
In addition to BMS-sponsored ongoing studies, 22 studies sponso red by ONO 
Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. and conducted in Japan, Korea, and/or Tai wan are included in the 
reference safety information in Section 5.6 of the IB. Brief de scriptions of these studies are

1.2.5					Clinical	Safety	Summary 	
  B A T :  
The majority of adverse events ( AEs) occurred during the initia l phase of treatment and 
were largely consistent with know n side effects of etoposide. I nitial-phase side effects were 
mostly low grade (i.e. ≤ Grade 2) and included: nausea (N=10), fatigue (N=9), alopecia 
(N=9), edema (N=8), and neutropenia (N=3), as listed in the tab le below. Two patients had a 
grade 3 asymptomatic, subsegment al pulmonary embolism. Two subj ects did not complete 
the initial treatment phase, one  individual was taken off study  after developing grade 2 
priapism, and a second individua l expired due to pneumonia/neut ropenic sepsis. AEs 
occurring during the BAT monothera py phase of the trial were ra re and low grade. Only 
four subjects experienced an AE during this phase, and all but three AEs were grade 1. 
Grade 2 events included alopecia and an elevated creatinine in one subject and grade 2 
nausea in a separate subject.  
 
None of the 14 patients developed  new pain, skeletal events or urinary obstruction due to 
prostate cancer. Although qualit y of life was no t formally eval uated in the study, most 
subjects reported enhanced well- being and increased functional activity. Patients with 
intact sexual function prior to ADT had return of sexual functi on and libido on BAT.

         N i v o l u m a b :  
 The overall safety experience wi th Nivolumab as a monotherapy,  is based on experience in 
 approximately 11,000 subjects tr eated to date.  For monotherap y, the safety profile is 
 similar across tumor types. The only exception is pulmonary in flammation adverse events 
 (AEs), which may be numerically greater in subjects with NSCLC , because in some cases, 
 it can be difficult to distingu ish between Nivo lumab-related a nd unrelated causes of 
 pulmonary symptoms and radiogra phic changes. There is no patte rn in the incidence, 
 severity, or causality of AEs t o Nivolumab dose level.  A deta iled list of AEs for patients 
 treated with Nivolumab as monot herapy on clinical trials can b e found in Table 5.6.1-1 in 
 t h e  I B .    In several ongoing clinical tria ls, the safety of Nivolumab in  combination with other 
 therapeutics such as Ipilimumab , cytotoxic chemotherapy, anti- angiogenics, and targeted 
 therapies is being explored. Most studies are ongoing and, as such, the safety profile of 
 Nivolumab combinations continues to evolve.

1.3.1	Rationale 	for	Conducting 	the	Study	
 BAT and DNA Repair:  
We have discovered a provocative association between germline a nd/or somatic DNA-
repair mutations and response to  BAT. Based on prior studies, t he incidence of germline 
mutations in DNA-repair genes in mCRPC patients is 8-12%, with somatic DNA-repair 
mutations approaching 20-25%. As mentioned, we have recently id entified a correlation 
between long term (“exceptional” ) responders to BAT and the pre sence of mutations in 
homologous recombination DNA repa ir genes. Our index case was a n enzalutamide-
pretreated patient with mCRPC wh o achieved a durable (> 24 mo) complete radiographic 
and serologic response following t reatment with BAT (Figure 6). (38) Tumor DNA 
 sequencing found inactivating m utations in both BRCA2 (with LO H) and ATM (mono-
 allelic), which were then confir med on germline DNA testing (i .e. these were b oth inherited
 mutations). We have since syste matically sequenced tumor/germl ine DNA from patients 
 receiving BAT and, remarkably, have detected DNA repair mutati ons in the majority of 
 responders (Table 1). Overall, o ur preliminary unpublished fin dings suggest an 80% 
 response rate to BAT (4/5) in men with DNA repair mutations, i mplying a provocative 
 association between DNA repair-d eficient prostate cancer and B AT responsiveness. This is a 
 rational inference based on the fact that BAT may induce dsDNA  breaks that may go 
 unrepaired in the setting of homologous recombination defects.

 Immune Checkpoint Blockade and DNA Repair:  
Two randomized phase III trials involving single-agent checkpoi nt (CTLA-4) inhibitors in 
mCRPC patients did not meet their primary endpoints.(39,40) How ever, a small subset 
(~20%) of mCRPC patients did der ive clinical benefit, although the molecular 
characteristics of these patients are unknown. In pilot studies  conducted at Johns Hopkins, 
we have observed significant responses to checkpoint inhibition  in several heavily 
pretreated mCRPC patients with DNA repair defects (Figure 7). F or instance, two patients 
(#1: MSH6-mutated; #2: BRCA2-mutated) achieved a PSA 50 response following combined 
PD-1/CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitio n using Ipilimumab plus Nivolum ab. Patient #1 also had a 
partial radiographic R ECIST response and remains progression-fr ee for > 6 months.  Patient 
#2 had over 20 sites of symptomat ic bone metastases at that sta rt of therapy. Following 
combination checkpoint inhibition, his pain disappeared (pain s core: 6/10  0/10) and his 
clinical response is ongoing aft er 9 months. A third mCRPC pati ent (#3: ATM-mutated) 
achieved a partial radiographic RECIST response without a PSA r esponse. A fourth patient 
(#4: POLH-mutated) also had a RE CIST response without a PSA res ponse. Moreover, those 
patients with a DNA repair mutat ion had significantly improved radiographic-PFS (HR 0.28, 
p=0.027) and PSA-PFS (HR 0.14,P= 0.001) compared to DNA repair-p roficient patients. 
Similar to the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors in patients wi th MSI-High (mismatch repair-
deficient) colon cancer, we spe culate that a benefit of immunot herapy may be observed in 
mCRPC patients with germline and /or somatic mutations in DNA re pair genes, including 
homologous recombination genes (i.e. not just MMR genes), thus potentially expanding the 
pool of mCRPC patients that may be susceptible to immune checkp oint blockade.

 BAT/Immunotherapy Combination:  
Even more notably, we have obser ved intriguing tumor responses in two mCRPC 
patients with intact DNA repair processes (i.e. no repair gene mutations) that were treated 
sequentially (on two different tr ials) with BAT followed by PD- 1 inhibition, who achieved 
dramatic PSA/RECIST responses to PD-1 blockade (Figure 8). Pati ent #1 initially achieved a 
PSA 50 response to BAT, which lasted 11 months, before developing sub sequent progression. 
Upon starting checkpoint inhibiti on following BAT, his PSA leve l dropped from  56 ng/mL to 
4 ng/mL in the first 12 weeks, accompanied by a dramatic soft t issue response (Figure 8A). 
Patient #2 also init ially achieved a PSA 50 response to BAT lasting 6 months, but eventually 
progressed. Following subsequent treatment with Pembrolizumab, his PSA dropped from 
692 ng/mL to 3 ng/mL, with a partial radiographic response afte r only 3 months of anti-PD-
1 therapy (Figure 8B). Important ly, neither pati ent had a DNA r epair mutation although 
both benefited dramatically from PD-1 inhibition following BAT.  Based on these 
preliminary data, we believe tha t further study of BAT with a c heckpoint inhibitor is 
warranted.

In this trial, we will adopt a timed-sequential approach, where by patients will first receive 
BAT and followed 12 weeks later by the addition of Nivolumab. W e hypothesize that (1) 
BAT-induced dsDNA breaks/rearrang ements will result in neoantig en formation and 
increased sensitivity to Nivolumab (primary hypothesis); that ( 2) mCRPC patients with 
germline/somatic mutations in DN A repair genes will derive the greatest clinical benefit 
from both BAT and Nivolumab; and  (3) that the combination of BA T with Nivolumab will be 
safe and well-tolerated in mCRPC  patients resulting in minimal grade 3/4 toxicities. 
 1.3.2	Rationale 	for	Dosage	Selection 	
Nivolumab will be administered at  a flat dose of 480mg IV given  every 4 weeks until 
progression. Nivolumab has been ex tensively studied in humans a t doses ranging from 1-
10mg/kg every 2 weeks to 0.3-10mg/kg every 3 weeks.  Using thes e doses, the clinical 
pharmacology of Nivolumab is well-established.  Based on the ex posure-response 
relationships for efficacy and sa fety, the benefit-risk profile  of Nivolumab 480mg given 
every 4 weeks is predicted to be  similar to the 3mg/kg dosing a cross multiple tumor types 
(Zhao	X	et	al.	A	Model‐Based	Exposure–Response 	(E–R)	Assessment 	of	a	Nivolumab 	(NIVO)		4‐

Testosterone cypionate will by a dministered at a dose of 400mg IM every 28 days (4 
weeks). This dose of testosterone has been shown to be both saf e and efficacious in mCRPC 
patients.

l       Physical exam (including vital signs/height/weight) may be missed if not clinically indicated or in the event of a tele medicine visit. In order to minimize the need for research-only  in-person visits, 
telemedicine visits may be substituted for in-person clinical t rial visits or portions of clinical trial visits where determin ed to be appropriate and where determined by the investigator n ot to 
increase the participants risks. Prior to initiating telemedici ne for study visits the study te am will explain to the particip ant, what a telemedicine visit entails and confirm that the stu dy participant 
is in agreement and able to proc eed with this method. Telemedic ine acknowledgement will be obtained in accordance with the Gui dance for Use of Telemedicin e in Research. In the event 
telemedicine is not deemed feasible, the study visit will proce ed as an in-person visit. Telemedicine visits will be conducted  using HIPAA compliant method appr oved by the Health System and  
within licensing restrictions.

Johns Hopkins  
 36 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 5.1	Screening 	Assessment 	(Day	‐28	to	Day	‐1)	
Before initiating any screening activities, the scope of the st udy should be explained to each 
patient. Patients should be advised of any known risks inherent  in the planned procedures, 
any alternative treatment options , their right to withdraw from  the study at any time for 
any reason, and their right to p rivacy. After this explanation,  patients should be asked to 
sign and date an IRB-approved informed consent that meets the r equirements of the Code 
of Federal Regulations (Federal Register Vol. 46, No. 17, Janua ry 27, 1981, part 50).
The screening visit will determin e patient eligibility accordin g to the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria (Sections 3. 3 Inclusion Criteria & 3.4 Exclu sion Criteria). The following 
assessments will be perfo rmed at this visit:  
 Obtain informed consent and research authorization. 
 Record demographics (including a ge) and medical history (includ ing 
prior treatment for prostate carcinoma). 
 Conduct physical exam (including  vital signs, height/weight).  The	
physical	exam	may	be	missed	if	screening 	visit	is	taking	place	over	
telemedicine.  
 Obtain histologic and radiologic  confirmation of disease. If ra diographic 
studies have not been performed in prior 4 weeks of the screeni ng visit, 
they must be obtained as part of screening. 
 Obtain history regarding prior t reatment history for prostate c ancer 
(including history of ADT, history of radiation therapy, or oth er local 
therapy). 
 Perform laboratory tests (Comp lete blood count w/ Diff, PSA, 
Comprehensive metabolic panel, u rinalysis, PT/INR, PTT, serum 
testosterone, TSH with reflexive  T3, T4 testing, serum Creatine  kinase 
(CK), serum amylase/lipase, and Hepatitis B/C panel). 
 Assess performance status  (ECOG). (Appendix B). 
 Perform 12-lead EKG. ECGs are required within 14 days prior to 
starting study treatment and when clinically indicated. 
 Twelve-lead ECGs will be obtaine d after the pati ent has been 
rested in a supine position for at least 5 minutes in each case .  
The Investigator or designated physician will review the paper copies of each of the timed 12-lead ECGs on each of the study days when they are collected. 
 ECGs will be recorded at 25 mm/sec.  All ECGs should be 
assessed by the Investigator as t o whether they are clinically 
significantly abnormal or not cli nically significantly abnormal .  
If there is a clinically signi ficant abnormal finding, the 
Investigator will record it as a n AE on the eCRF.  The original  
ECG traces must be stored in t he patient medical record as 
source data. 
 Determine suitability for Testosterone + Nivolumab. 
Bipolar Androgen Therapy and Nivolumab in mCRPC IRB00164973 
Johns Hopkins  
 37 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021  Obtain image-guided bi opsy of a site of disease (i.e. soft tiss ue, lymph 
node) – further described in section 5.1.1. 
 Discuss concurrent medications.  
 Provide instructions for obtaini ng a CLIA-certif ied laboratory (i.e. 
COLOR genomics) kit for germline  DNA testing per standard of ca re 
practice (Optional). 
 Relevant information should be d ocumented. The institutional re gistration should be 
finalized, and appropriate docume nts (i.e. signed informed cons ent and supporting source 
documentation for eligibility questions) emailed to the Lead si te. 
 
Information for patients who do not meet the eligibility criter ia to participate in this study 
(i.e. screening failures) should be captured in the CRMS databa se at the screening 
assessment.  5.1.1	Surgical	Procedures 	
A core needle biopsy of a site o f disease (soft tissue, lymph n ode) will be performed 
during the Screening period (prior to C1D1). Patients will be r eferred to their 
respective biopsy service for an  image-guided core biopsy. At l east 4 standard core 
biopsies should be attempted to b e obtained from the site (soft  tissue, lymph node). 
Fine	needle	aspiration 	is	unlikely	to	yield	adequate 	tumor	tissue	for	molecular 	
analysis,	and	should	only	be	attempted 	when	core	biopsy	is	not	feasible.		The unique 
subject number given by the Lead site during registration shoul d be used to identify 
the biopsy samples to protect the subject’s identity.  
For each biopsy timepoint, ≥ 4 f resh cores will be collected fr om the same  site of 
disease chosen during the Screen ing period (prio r to C1D1); ≥ 2  fresh cores will be 
collected for immediate flash-free zing in liquid nitrogen and ≥  2 cores will be 
formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. For soft-tissue biopsies,  18-gauge core 
biopsy needles are recommended. 
To minimize tissue autolysis, a d edicated tissue technician sho uld be appointed and 
called/paged to the biopsy room to initiate processing steps in cluding FFPE 
preparation, which should be done within 30 minutes of biopsy c ollection, and the 
flash-freezing of the other desi gnated cores with liquid nitrog en. FFPE specimens 
should be processed according to  standard institutional FFPE pr ocedures. All 
samples will be sent to the De Ma rzo Laboratory f or analysis. 
Note. If site(s) do not have the capability to perform flash-fr eezing of tumor tissue 
cores with liquid nitrogen, all available tumor tissue core spe cimens should be 
prepared and processed according to standard institutional FFPE  procedures. 
 
5.1.1.1 Potential 	Biopsy	Complications  
Potential complications of a rese arch biopsy include: infection , bleeding, and 
pain at the biopsy site.

Johns Hopkins University  
 43 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 7.1.2	Dose	Modifications 	
There will be no dose modifications permitted. Dose reductions or dose escalations are not 
permitted. 
7.2								Dose	Delay	and	Treatment 	Discontinuation 	
Dose delay criteria apply for a ll drug-related adverse events ( regardless of whether or not 
the event is attributed to Nivolu mab, Testosterone, or both). A ll study drugs must be 
delayed until treatment can resume. 
7.3	Dose	Delay	Criteria		
Nivolumab and Testosterone admin istration should be delayed for  the following: 
 Any Grade ≥ 2 non-skin, drug-related adverse event, with the fo llowing exceptions: 
 Grade 2 drug-related fatigue or laboratory abnormalities do not  require a treatment 
delay. 
 Any Grade 3 skin, drug-related adverse event. 
 Any Grade 3 drug-related laborat ory abnormality, with the follo wing exceptions for AST, 
ALT, or total bilirubin: 
 Delay dosing for drug-related AST, ALT, or total bilirubin grad e ൒ 2 toxicity. 
 Grade 3 amylase or lipase abnorma lities that are not associated  with symptoms or clinical 
manifestations of pancreatitis d o not require a dose delay.  
 Grade 3 lymphopenia does not require a dose delay. 
 Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illn ess, which, in the judgment 
of the investigator, warrants de laying the dose of study medica tion. 
Because of the potential for cli nically meaningful Nivolumab-re lated AEs requiring early 
recognition and prompt intervention, management algorithms have  been developed for 
suspected pulmonary toxicity, GI , hepatotoxicity, endocrinopath y, skin toxicity, neurological 
toxicity and renal toxicity. The recommendations are to follow the Nivolumab IB adverse 
event algorithm (Appendix A). 
7.4		Criteria	to	Resume	Treatment 	
Missed doses of Nivolumab and/or Testosterone should be adminis tered when subject 
meets criteria to resume treatment. If a Testosterone and Nivol umab dose has been 
missed, the subject should wait u ntil the next scheduled dosing  date following the 
originally planned dosing schedule that is consistent with the study calendar.  
Subjects  may  resume  treatment  with  study  drug  when  the  drug-related AE(s)  
resolve to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline  value, with the following exce ptions: 
 Subjects may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigu e. 
 Subjects who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug-related skin A E may resume 
treatment in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity. 
 For subjects with Grade 2 AST, A LT, or total bilirubin elevatio ns, dosing may resume 
when laboratory values return to baseline and management with c orticosteroids, if 
needed, is complete. 
 Subjects with combined Grade 2 AST/ALT AND  total bilirubin values meeting 
discontinuation parameters should have treatment permanently di scontinued. 
 Drug-related diarrhea, or  colitis, must have resolved to baseli ne before treatment is 
resumed.  
 Subjects with persistent Grade 1  pneumonitis after completion o f a steroid taper over at 
Bipolar Androgen Therapy and Nivolumab in mCRPC IRB00164973 
Johns Hopkins University  
 44 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 least 1 month may be e ligible for retreatment if discussed with  and approved by the 
investigator. 
 Drug-related endocrinopathies ade quately controlled with only p hysiologic hormone 
replacement may resume treatment. 
 If treatment is delayed > 10 weeks, the subject must be permane ntly discontinued from 
study therapy.  
If the subject is unable to resu me both Nivolumab and Testoster one, permanent 
discontinuation is required.  
7.5									Discontinuation 	Criteria	
Treatment with Nivolumab and Testosterone should be permanently  discontinued for any 
of the following: 
     Any Grade 2 drug-related uveitis or eye pain or blurred vis ion that does not respond 
to topical therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 severity wit hin the re-treatment period 
OR requires systemic treatment. 
     Any Grade 3 non-skin, drug-related adverse event lasting > 7 days, with the following 
exceptions for drug-related labo ratory abnormalities, uveitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm, 
diarrhea, colitis, neurologic to xicity, hypersensitivity reacti ons, and infusion reactions: 
 Grade 3 drug-related uveitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm, diarrh ea, colitis, 
neurologic toxicity, hypersensitivity reaction, or infusion rea ction of any duration 
requires discontinuation. 
 Grade 3 drug-related endocrinopat hies adequately controlled wit h only physiologic 
hormone replacement do not requi re discontinuation, except for Grade 3 adrenal 
insufficiency which requires permanent discontinuation. 
 Grade 3 drug-related laboratory abnormalities do not require tr eatment 
discontinuation except: 
 Grade 3 drug-related thrombocytopenia > 7 days or associated wi th 
bleeding requires discontinuation. 
 Any drug-related liver  function  test  (LFT)  abnormality that   meets  the  
following criteria require discontinuation: 
 Grade > 3 drug-related AST, ALT,  or total bilirubin requires 
discontinuation. 
 Concurrent AST or ALT > 3xULN and total bilirubin > 2xULN. 
     Any Grade 4 drug-related adverse event or laboratory abnorm ality, except for the 
following events which do not require discontinuation: 
 Grade 4 amylase or lipase abnormalities that are not associated  with symptoms or 
clinical manifestations of pancreatitis.  
 Isolated Grade 4 electrolyte imb alances/abnormalities that are not associated with 
clinical sequelae and are corre cted with supplementation/approp riate management   
within 72 hours of their onset. 
 Grade 4 neutropenia < 7 days. 
 Grade 4 lymphopenia or leukopenia. 
 Grade 4 drug-related endocrinopat hy AEs, such as, hyper- or hyp othyroidism, or 
glucose intolerance, that resolv e or are adequately controlled with physiologic 
hormone replacement (corticosteroids, thyroid hormones) or gluc ose-controlling 
agents, respectively, may not req uire discontinuation after dis cussion with and

Johns Hopkins University  
 45 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 approval from the investigator. Grade 4 drug-related adrenal in sufficiency or 
hypophysitis requires discontinuation regardless of control wit h hormone 
replacement. 
    Any dosing interruption lasting > 10 weeks unless the invest igator is consulted and agrees 
with the rationale for resuming therapy after a delay > 10 week s. Note that tumor 
assessments should continue as pe r protocol even if dosing is i nterrupted. 
   Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent il lness which, in the judgment 
of the Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to th e subject with continued 
Nivolumab dosing. 
7.6	Treatment 	of	Nivolumab ‐Related	Infusion 	Reactions 	
Since Nivolumab contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequ ences, each is 
unlikely to be immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensitiv ity reactions. However, 
if such a reaction were to occur,  it might manifest with fever,  chills, rigors, headache, rash, 
pruritus, arthralgias, hypo- or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms. Infusion 
reactions should be graded accord ing to the most current NCI CT CAE guidelines. 
Treatment recommendations are pro vided below and may be modifie d based on local 
treatment standards and guidelines as appropriate: 
For	Grade	1	symptoms : (Mild reaction; infusion inte rruption not indicated; interven tion 
not indicated) 
Remain at bedside and monitor su bject until recovery from sympt oms. The following 
prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusion s: diphenhydramine 50 
mg (or equivalent) and/or parace tamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetamino phen) at least 30 
minutes before additional n ivolumab administrations. 
For	Grade	2	symptoms : (Moderate reaction requires therapy or infusion interruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [e.g. antihistamines , non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, narcotics, co rticosteroids, bronchodilators , IV fluids]; prophylactic 
medications indicated for up to 24 hours). 
Stop the Nivolumab infusion, beg in an IV infusion of normal sal ine, and treat the subject 
with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or paracetamo l 325 to 1000 mg 
(acetaminophen); remain at bedsid e and monitor subject until re solution of symptoms. 
Corticosteroid or bronchodilator therapy may also be administer ed as appropriate. If the 
infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% of th e original infusion rate when 
symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 mi nutes, the rate may be 
increased to 100% of the original infusion rate. Monitor subjec t closely. If symptoms recur 
then no further Nivolumab will be  administered at that visit. A dminister diphenhydramine 
50 mg IV, and remain at bedside and monitor the subject until r esolution of symptoms. 
The amount of study drug infused must be recorded on the electr onic case report form 
(eCRF). The following prophylactic premedications are recommend ed for future infusions: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to  1000 mg 
(acetaminophen) should be administered at least 30 minutes befo re additional Nivolumab 
or administrations. If necessary, corticosteroids (recommended dose: up to 25 mg of IV 
hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used. 
For	Grade	3	or	Grade	4	symptoms: 	(Severe reaction, Grade 3: pr olonged [i.e. not rapidly 
responsive to symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of 
symptoms following initial improvement; hospitalization indicat ed for other clinical 
Bipolar Androgen Therapy and Nivolumab in mCRPC IRB00164973 
Johns Hopkins University  
 46 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 sequelae [e.g. renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]). Grade  4: (life-threatening; pressor 
or ventilatory support indicated). 
Immediately discontinue infusion of Nivolumab. Begin an IV infu sion of normal saline, and 
treat the subject as follows. Re commend bronchodilators, epinep hrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a 
1:1,000 solution for subcutaneous  administration or 0.1 to 0.25  mg of a 1:10,000 solution 
injected  slowly  for  IV  administration,  and/or  diphenhydra mine  50  mg  IV  with 
methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subjec t should be monitored 
until the investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will no t recur. Nivolumab will be 
permanently discontinued. Investi gators should follow their ins titutional guidelines for the 
treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor subject  until recovery from 
symptoms. In the case of late-o ccurring hypersensitivity sympto ms (e.g. appearance of a 
localized or generalized pruriti s within 1 week after treatment ), symptomatic treatment 
may be given (e.g. oral antihi stamine, or corticosteroids). 
7.7			Treatment 	Beyond	Disease	Progression 	
Accumulating evidence indicates a minority of subjects treated with immunotherapy may  
derive clinical benefit despite initial evidence of PD, as desc ribed by irRECIST criteria 
(Nishino et al, Clin Cancer Res ; 19(14) July 15, 2013). Subject s will be permitted to continue 
treatment beyond initial inves tigator-assessed progression with out reconsent as long as 
they meet the following criteria:  
  Investigator-assessed clinical benefit and subject is tolerati ng study drug. 
  The assessment of cli nical benefit should  take into account wh ether the subject is clinically  
deteriorating and unlikely to re ceive further benefit from cont inued treatment. 
  Subjects should discontinue stu dy therapy upon evidence of fur ther progression, defined as 
an additional 10% or greater in crease in tumor burden volume fr om time of initial 
progression (including all target  lesions and new measurable le sions). 
  Per irRECIST criteria, new lesi ons are considered measurable a t the time of initial 
progression if the longest diameter is at least 10 mm by CT sca n (except for pathological 
lymph nodes, which must have a short axis of at least 15 mm). A ny new lesion considered 
non-measurable at the time of initial progression may become me asurable and therefore 
included in the tumor burden measurement if the longest diamete r increases to  at least 10 
mm by CT scan (except for pathological lymph nodes, which must have an increase in short 
axis to at least 15 mm). In situations where the relative incre ase in total tumor burden by 
10% is solely due to inclusion of  new lesions which become meas
urable, these new lesions 
must demonstrate an absolute in crease of at least 5 mm.  Furthe r bone disease progression is 
defined as additional two or more new bone lesions noted on bon e scans compared to the 
time of PCWG3-defined progression of bone disease. 
 
 Testosterone 	Only	Phase:	
During the Testostone-only lead-in phase (12 weeks), patients m ay experience PSA 
progression in the presence or abs ence of radiographic progress ion. Patients will be allowed 
to remain on study in the following circumstances:  
PSA	Progression 	Only:	
In the setting of a rising PSA (including patients with PSA pro gression [PCWG3 criteria]) in the 
absence of radiographic progressi on (RECIST 1.1 Criteria), pati ents without clinical symptoms 
Bipolar Androgen Therapy and Nivolumab in mCRPC IRB00164973 
Johns Hopkins University  
 47 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 of disease progression will be allowed to remain on study.  If the patient is not deriving clinical 
benefit, patients may be removed from the study at the discreti on of the treating physician. 
	Radiographic 	Progression: 	
Patients with radiographic progr ession (per RECI ST 1.1 Criteria ) determined on post-
testosterone, restaging imaging may remain on study except in ANY  of the following 
circumstances: 
 Patient is not deriving clinical benefit as determined by the t reating physician 
 Development of symptoms of clini cal progression (any of the bel ow): 
 New bony pain. 
 Risk of impending fracture. 
 Pending spinal cord compression. 
 Obstructive urinary symptoms. 
 Decline in performance status  from baseline assessment. 
 Development of new liver or brain metastases. 
For patients that continue on st udy after radiographic progress ion (as documented on initial 
imaging), restaging must occur be tween 6-7 weeks +/- 5 days fro m prior imaging. Subjects 
should discontinue study therapy  upon evidence of further progr ession, defined as an 
additional 10% or greater increas e in tumor burden volume from time of initial progression 
(i.e. post testosterone only imag ing).  Subsequent imaging will  continue as per protocol and 
irRECIST criteria should be us ed to assess further progression of the Testosterone + 
Nivolumab combination. 
 
7.8							Immunotherapy 	Adverse 	Event	Management  
Because  of  the  potential  for   clinically  meaningful  Nivol umab-related AEs requiring early 
recognition and prompt intervent ion, management algorithms have  been developed for 
suspected pulmonary toxicity, GI  toxicity, hepatotoxicity, endo crinopathy, skin toxicity, 
neurological toxicity, and renal toxicity (Nivolumab IB). 
These adverse event management algorithms are included in Appen dix A.  
7.9	Removal 	of	Subjects 	from	the	Study,
	Therapy 	Assessment 	
7.9.1	Subject	Withdrawal 	
Single subject termination is by definition when the patient is  withdrawn or when 
the patient has died.  The study termination page in the eCRF m ust be completed. 
The Investigator also has the ri ght to withdraw subjects from t he study in the event 
of: 
 Occurrence of an exclusion crite rion, which is clinically relev ant and affects the 
subject’s safety, and discontinuation is considered necessary b y the Investigator 
and/or the Sponsor. 
 Therapeutic failure requiring urgent additional medication (if applicable) 
 Occurrence of AEs, if discontinua tion of study medication is co nsidered 
necessary by the Investigator and /or Subject (if applicable). 
 Intake of non-permitted concomit ant medication as defined in Ap pendix A 
where the predefined consequence  is withdrawal from the study.

 48 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021  Progression of disease (subject s will only come off study after  meeting PCWG3 
criteria for radiographic progre ssion and not for PSA) except a s described in 
Section 7.7. 
 Lack of subject compliance. 
 Protocol violation. 
 
7.10					Treatment 	Compliance 	
Trained medical personnel will ad minister Nivolumab and dispens e other study 
medications. Treatment complianc e will be monitored by drug acc ountability, as well as by 
recording administration of all medications in the CRF. The dat e and the exact dosage 
amount given at each infusion will be recorded. Any missed dose s will be recorded. In case 
the treatment has to be interrupt ed during an infusion and the dosing is not resumed, the 
medical personnel should evaluat e the percentage of dose receiv ed by the patient and 
document it in the patient record. Any reason for non-complianc e should also be 
documented.  
7.11						Destruction 	of	Study	Drug	
Investigator drug destruction is  allowed provided the following  minimal standards are met: 
• On-site disposal practices must not expose humans to risks fr om the drug. 
• On-site disposal practices and  procedures are in agreement wi th applicable laws and 
regulations, including any speci al requirements for controlled or hazardous substances. 
• Written procedures for on-site  disposal are available and fol lowed. The procedures must be 
filed with the Sponsor SOPs and a copy provided to BMS upon req uest. 
• Records are maintain ed that allow for traceability of each co ntainer, including the date 
disposed of, quantity disposed, and identification of the perso n disposing the containers. 
The method of disposal, ie, inci nerator, licensed sanitary land fill, or licensed waste disposal 
vendor must be documented. 
• Accountability and disposal re cords are complete, up-to-date,  and available for BMS to 
review throughout the clinical tr ial period as pe r the study ag reement. A copy of the drug 
destruction certificate should b e maintained for provision to B MS at the end of the study. 
If conditions for destruction ca nnot be met, please contact BMS .  
It is the Investigator’s respons ibility to arrange for disposal  of all empty containers, 
provided that procedures for pro per disposal have been establis hed according to applicable 
federal, state, local, and insti tutional guidelines and procedu res, and provided that 
appropriate records of  disposal are kept. 
7.12			Return	of	Study	Drug	
It is the Investigator’s respons ibility to arrange for destruct ion of drug upon completion or 
termination of the study and dis posal of all empty containers, provided that procedures for 
proper disposal have been established according to applicable f ederal, state, local, and 
institutional guidelines and procedures, and provided that appr opriate records of disposal 
are kept.

8.1	Definitions 	
8.1.1	Adverse	Event	(AE)		
 An AE is defined as any untowar d medical occurrence in a patie nt administered a 
medicinal product that does not necessarily have a causal relat ionship with this 
treatment. An AE can, therefore,  be any unfavorable and uninten ded sign (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding),  symptom, or disease temporally  associated with 
the use of an investigational pr oduct, whether or not related t o the investigational 
medicinal product. This includes an exacerbation of pre-existin g conditions or 
events, intercurrent illnesses, d rug interaction, or the signif icant worsening of the 
indication under investigation that is not recorded elsewhere o n the eCRF under 
specific efficacy assessments. An ticipated fluctuations of pre- existing conditions, 
including the disease under study, that do not represent a clin ically significant 
exacerbation or worsening are not considered AEs. 
 It is the responsibility of the  Investigator to  document all A Es that occur during the 
study. AEs should be elicited by asking the patient a non-leadi ng question (e.g. 
“Have you experienced any new or  changed symptoms since we last  asked/since 
your last visit?”). The existence of an AE may be concluded fro m a spontaneous 
report of the patient; from the physical examination; or from s pecial tests such as 
the ECG, laboratory assessments, or other study-specified proce dure (source of AE). 
Symptoms reported spontaneously by the patient during the physi cal examination 
would also qualify as an AE (and hence documented on the AE eCR F, not on the 
physical examination eCRF, which is reserved for physical signs  or findings). 
 
8.1.2	Serious	Adverse	Event	(SAE)	
An SAE is any untoward medical  occurrence that occurs at any do se (or, occurs after 
informed consent is given and prior to dosing if the SAE is rel ated to a study 
procedure) that: 
 Results in death. Any event resu lting in death during the repor ting period (from 
date of first dose of study drug through 100 days after last do se) must be treated as 
an SAE and reported as such. An event related to a study proced ure that occurs after 
informed consent, but prior to dosing that results in death mus t also be reported as 
an SAE. 
 Is life-threatening (patient is at immediate risk of death from  the event as it 
occurred). 
 Requires in-patient hospitalization (formal admission to a hosp ital for medical 
reasons) or prolongation of e xisting hospitalization. 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. 
 Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
 Important medical events that ma y not result in death, are not life-threatening, or do 
not require hospitalization may be  considered SAEs when, based on appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopa rdize the patien t and may requi re medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this defi nition. Examples of such 
Bipolar Androgen Therapy and Nivolumab in mCRPC IRB00164973 
Johns Hopkins University  
 50 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 events include allergic bronchosp asm requiring intensive treatm ent in an emergency 
room or at home or the developme nt of drug dependency or drug a buse. 
 
8.1.2.1  Events	or	Outcomes 	Not	Qualifying 	as	Serious	Adverse	Events  
 The following are not considered SAEs and therefore do not nee d to be reported as 
 s u c h :  
 Pre-planned or elective hospital ization including social and/or  convenience 
situations (e.g. respite care). 
 Hospital visits of less than 24 hours duration (e.g. patient pr esents to the emergency 
room, but is not admitted to a ward). 
 Overdose of either BMS study drug or concomitant medication unl ess the event 
meets SAE criteria (e.g. hospital ization). However, the event s hould still be captured 
as a nonserious AE on the appropriate eCRF page. 
 Events of progression of the pati ent’s underlying cancer as wel l as events clearly 
related to progression of the pa tient’s cancer (signs and sympt oms of progression) 
should not be reported as a seri ous adverse event unless the ou tcome is fatal within 
the safety reporting period. If the event has a fatal outcome w ithin the safety 
reporting period, then the event  of Progression of Disease must  be recorded as an 
AE and as a SAE with CTCAE Grade 5 (fatal outcome) indicated. 
8.1.3	Progression 	of	Malignancy 	
Progression of a patient’s malignancy should not be considered an AE or SAE, unless 
in the Investigator’s opinion, study treatment resulted in an e xacerbation of the 
patient’s condition. If disease progression results in death or  hospitalization while 
on study or within 100 days of th e last dose, progressive disea se will be considered 
an SAE. 
8.1.4	Life‐threatening 	Events	
A life-threatening event is any AE that places the patient at i mmediate risk of death 
from the reaction as it occurs. It is not a reaction that had i t occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death. 
8.1.5	Hospitalization 	or	Prolongation 	of	Hospitalization 	
Hospitalization encompasses any inpatient admission (even for l ess than 24 hours) 
resulting from a precipitating, treatment-emergent adverse even t. For chronic or 
long-term patients, inpatient ad mission also includes transfer within the hospital to 
an acute or intensive care inpat ient unit. Hospitalizations for  administrative reasons 
or a non-worsening preexisting c ondition should not be consider ed AEs (e.g. 
admission for workup of a persiste nt pretreatment laboratory ab normality, yearly 
physical exam, protocol-specifie d admission, elective surgery).  Pre-planned 
treatments or surgical procedure s should be noted in the baseli ne documentation. 
Hospitalization because of an unplanned event will be deemed an  SAE. 
Prolongation of hospitalization is  any extension of an inpatien t hospitalization 
beyond the stay anticipated or required for the original reason  for admission. 
8.1.6	Significant 	Disability 	
Disability is a substantial disr uption of the patient’s ability  to conduct normal life 
functions.

Johns Hopkins University  
 51 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 8.1.7	Pregnancy 	
Male participants should refrain  from fathering a child or dona ting sperm during the 
study and for 7 months following  the last dose of nivolumab. 
Pregnancy of the patient’s partn ers is not considered to be an adverse event. 
However, the outcome of all preg nancies (spontaneous miscarriag e, elective 
termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abno rmality) should, if 
possible, be followed up and documented.  
The outcome of any conception o ccurring from the date of the fi rst dose until 7 
months after	the	last	dose	should be followed up and documented. 
All outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to BMS. 
8.1.8	Medical	Significance 	
An event that is not fatal or life-threatening and that does no t necessitate 
hospitalization may be considere d serious if, in the opinion of  the Investigator, it 
jeopardizes the patient’s status and might lead to medical or s urgical intervention to 
prevent any of the outcomes described in section 7.1.2. Such me dically significant 
events could include allergic bro nchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the 
emergency room or at home, blood  dyscrasias that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the developm ent of drug dependency or abuse . 
 
8.1.9	Deaths	
All deaths that occur during the study, or within the protocol- defined 100-day 
post-study follow-up period after the administration of the las t dose of study 
treatment, must be reported as follows: 
 Death that is  clearly the result of disease pro gression should be reported to  
the study monitor at t he next monitoring visit, be documented, and reported 
as an SAE. 
 Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to progression of t he disease 
under study, the AE causing the death must be reported to the s tudy monitor 
as a SAE within 24	hours . The report should cont ain a comment regarding 
the co-involvement of progression of disease, if appropriate, a nd should 
assign main and contributory causes of death.   
 Deaths with an unknown cause should be reported as a SAE., but followup 
should be done to determine the cause of death.  If a cause of death is 
determined, the event term of “d eath” must be updated at that t ime.    A post 
mortem maybe helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, a nd if 
performed a copy of th e post-mortem results should be forwarded  to BMS 
within the usual timeframes. 
 
The most recent version of the NCI CTCAE handbook will be used for adverse event 
descriptions and grading. 
 
All AEs (including SAEs and AESI s) occurring during the study a re to be followed up in 
accordance with good medical pra ctice until resolved; judged no  longer clinically 
significant; or, if a chronic c ondition, until fully characteri zed through 100 days after the last 
dose of study drug. Any SAEs, AE SIs, and treatment-related Grad e 3/4 AEs must be followed

Johns Hopkins University  
 52 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 until resolution or stabilizati on, or until lost to follow-up. After the 100-day window, 
treatment-related SAEs and all AE SIs, irrespective of causality , do not need to be reported.  
 
8.2	Expectedness  
 Adverse events can be considere d, “expected,” or, “unexpected. ” 
 8.2.1		Expected 	Adverse	Events  
Expected adverse events are those that have been previously ide ntified as resulting 
from administration of the agent. An adverse event can be consi dered expected 
when it appears in the same natu re severity and specificity as what is  in the current 
adverse event list of the Investigator’s Brochure. 
 
 8.2.2	Unexpected 	Adverse	Events	
An adverse event can be consider ed unexpected when the nature, intensity or 
frequency of which is not consistent with the current adverse e vent list of the 
Investigator’s Brochure, contact the lead site, principal inves tigator or sponsor to 
confirm unexpected adverse events when necessary. 			
8.3	Recording 	and	Grading	
8.3.1	Recording 	
All observed or volunteered adver se events, regardless of treat ment group, severity, 
suspected causal relationship, e xpectedness, or seriousness wil l be documented. 
A clinically significant change in  a physical examination findi ng or an abnormal test 
result (i.e., laboratory, X-ray,  EKG) should be recorded as an AE, if it: 
 Is associated with accompanying symptoms. 
 Is suggestive of organ toxicity. 
 Requires additional diagnostic te sting or medical or surgical 
intervention. 
 Leads to a change in study dosin g or discontinuation from the s tudy. 
 Is considered clinically significant by the Investigator. 
 
An abnormal test result that is subsequently determined to be i n error does not 
require recording as an adverse event, even if it originally me t one or more of the 
above criteria. 
8.3.2	Grading	Severity	
All adverse events will be grade d for intensity on a scale of 0  to 5. Severity grades 
will be recorded and based on the most recent version of the NC I CTCAE handbook. 
8.3.3	Attributing 	Causality 	
   Medical judgment should be used to determine the cause of the A E considering  
  all relevant factors such as, but not limited to, the underly ing study indication,  
  coexisting disease, concomitant medication, relevant history,  pattern of the AE,  
  temporal relationship to the study medication, dechallenge or  rechallenge with  
  the study drug (Table 3).

to BMS.	
 
 IND application sponsors are required to notify FDA in a writt en safety report of: 
 Any adverse experience  associated with the use of the drug that  is both serious 
and unexpected or, 
 Any findings from tests in laboratory animals that suggest a si gnificant risk for 
human subjects including reports  of mutagenicity, teratogenicit y, and 
carcinogenicity.  
  
 Adverse event means any untowar d medical occurrence associated  with the use of a 
 drug in humans, whether or no t considered drug related. 
  Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which t here is a reasonable 
 possibility that the drug cause d the adverse event. For the pu rposes of IND safety 
 reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to  suggest a causal 
 relationship between the drug a nd the adverse event. A suspect ed adverse reaction 
 implies a lesser degree of cert ainty about causality than an a dverse reaction. 
 Adverse reaction means any adverse event caused by a drug. Adv erse reactions are 
 a subset of all suspec ted adverse reactions where there is rea son to conclude that 
 the drug caused the event.   
 Unexpected adverse event or suspected adverse reaction refers to an event or 
 reaction that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the 
 specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an Inve stigator’s Brochure is not 
Bipolar Androgen Therapy and Nivolumab in mCRPC IRB00164973

 55 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021  required or available, is not c onsistent with the risk informa tion described in the 
 general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current IND a pplication. 
 Serious adverse event or suspected adverse reaction refers to an event or reaction 
 that, in the view of either the  Investigator or Sponsor, resul ts in any of the following 
 o u t c o m e s :  
 Death. 
 A life-threatening adverse event. 
 In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospital ization. 
 A persistent or significant inca pacity or substantial disruptio n of the    
ability to conduct normal life functions. 
 A congenital anomaly  or birth defect.  
 A life-threatening adverse event or suspected adverse reaction  is considered “life-
 threatening” if, in the view of  the investigator or sponsor, i ts occurrence places the 
 patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not inc lude an adverse event or 
 suspected adverse reaction that , had it occurred in a more sev ere form, might have 
 caused death. 
 Important medical events that m ay not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
 require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate 
 medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or research subject and may 
 require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the  outcomes listed as 
 s e r i o u s .   
	Mandatory 	Safety	Reporting 		
• Initial reporting: I ND application sponso r must report any su spected adverse 
reaction or adverse re action to study treatment that is both se rious and unexpected.  
Unexpected serious suspected adverse reactions suggesting signi ficant risk to 
human subjects must be reported to FDA as soon as possible but no later than 
within 15 calendar days following  the sponsor’s initial receipt  of the information. 
Unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction s represent 
especially important safety info rmation and must  be reported to  FDA as soon as 
possible but no later than 7 calendar days following the sponso r’s initial receipt of 
the information.  • Follow-up reporting:
 Any relevant additional informat ion obtained by the sponsor 
that pertains to a previously su bmitted IND safety report must be submitted as a 
Follow-up IND Safety Report. Such  report should be submitted wi thout delay, as 
soon as the information is availa ble but no later than 15 calen dar days after the

8.4.2	Reporting 	SAEs	at	Multi‐Site/Participating 	Institutions 		
SAEs should be reported to the Lead site and BMS. 
9.	 CRITERIA 	FOR	OUTCOME 	ASSESSMENT/THERAPEUTIC 	RESPONSE 	
9.1	Outcome 	Assessment 	
All baseline evaluations will be  performed as closely as possib le to the beginning of 
treatment (within 7 days). For subsequent evaluations, the meth od of assessment and 
techniques will be the same as those used at baseline. 
Note : Any bone lesions, however, that are identified on the baselin e CT or MRI 
studies and judged as providing meaningful information about no ntarget disease 
status on the basis of their size or other features should be c onsidered for inclusion 
in the follow-up assessments of nontarget lesions by the same i maging modality. 
 Conventional CT, NM Bone Scan. 
CT Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis and NM  Bone scans will be used to mea sure tumor 
response as a secondary endpoint per RECIST 1.1 Criteria. 
 Tumor markers. 
       PSA measurements will be used to assess the primary endp oint. 
9.1.1	Primary	Endpoint 	
The primary endpoint is defined as a PSA 50 response, defined as a ≥ 50% decline in 
PSA from baseline, confirmed wit h a second measurement at least  4 weeks later. 
 
9.1.2	Secondary 	Endpoints 	
 
9.1.2.1		Safety  
This endpoint is defined as inci dence of grade 3 -5 toxicities b ased upon the 
most current CTCAE standard grading scales. 
 
		 9.1.2.2		PSA	Progression ‐Free	Survival	(PFS)   
PSA progression (PSA progression-free survival; PSA–PFS) will b e defined 
Bipolar Androgen Therapy and Nivolumab in mCRPC IRB00164973 
Johns Hopkins University  
 57 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 per PCWG3 guidelines.  
   For those subjects showing an initial decline in PSA from ba seline, is   
   defined as an increase in PSA that is ≥ 25% and ≥ 2 ng/mL ab ove the nadir,  
   and which is confirmed by a second value ≥ 3 weeks later (i. e. a   
   confirmed rising trend). 
    For those subjects with no decline in PSA from baseline, is defined as an  
   increase in PSA that is ≥ 25% and ≥ 2 ng/mL after 12 weeks.  
  9.1.2.3		Progression–free 	Survival  
Time to radiographic or clinical  progression or death, whicheve r comes first.  
 Based on RECIST version 1.1 and PCWG3 definitions including:  
 Progression of soft tissue lesi ons according to RECIST 1.1 Crit eria.  
 Progression of bone lesions detected with bone scan according t o 
PCWG3 criteria.  
 Radiologically-confirmed spinal c ord compression or pathologica l 
fracture due to malignant prog ression, or other clinical event 
deemed to be cancer-related.  
		 9.1.2.4			Objective 	Response 	Rate	
Defined as the proportion of pat ients achieving a complete/part ial response 
in target lesions (RECIST 1.1 Criteria).  
   9.1.2.5				Durable	Progression ‐free	Survival	(durable‐PFS)		
Durable PFS will be defined as th e proportion of patients witho ut clinical or 
radiographic progression, as defi ned by PCWG3 criteria, or deat h at 24 
weeks from the start of treatment. 	
    9.1.2.6		Overall	Survival	(OS)	
Overall survival will be defined  as the time from study enrollm ent to death 
or up to 2 years after last dose. 
This will be summarized using a Kaplan-Meier curve. 
 
9.2	Therapeutic 	Response 	
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using a combination of the 
international criteria proposed  by the Response Evaluation Crit
eria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) Committee(42) and the guidelines for prostate cancer e ndpoints developed by the 
Prostate Cancer Clinical Trial s Working Group (PCWG3).(43)
Patients will need to be re-evaluated for response every cycle according to the guidelines 
below.
9.2.1	PSA	
Perform PSA testing at a minimum  of 1-week intervals with the t hreshold PSA level 
at 2.0 ng/mL. To report PSA-based outcomes, PCWG3 recommends th at the percent 
of change in PSA from baseline to 12 weeks (or earlier for thos e who discontinue 
Bipolar Androgen Therapy and Nivolumab in mCRPC IRB00164973 
Johns Hopkins University  
 58 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 therapy) and the maximum decline in PSA that occurs at any poin t after treatment 
be reported for each patient using a waterfall plot. PSA measur ements obtained 
during the first 12 weeks should not be used as the sole criter ion for clinical 
decision making. 
9.2.2	Measurable 	Disease	
According to RECIST 1.1, measura ble disease is defined as at le ast 1 lesion > 10mm 
in its longest diameter as measured with conventional technique s (i.e. CT with slice 
cut of 5 mm, MRI). All tumor measurements will be taken using a  ruler or calipers 
and recorded in millimeters (or d ecimal fractions of centimeter s).  To be considered 
pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be > 15 mm in short 
axis when assessed by CT scan (CT  scan slice thickness recommen ded to be no 
greater than 5 mm).  
9.2.3	Nonmeasurable 	Disease	
Following RECIST 1.1, all other l esions (or sites of disease) w ill be considered 
nonmeasurable disease. This inclu des small lesions (longest dia meter < 10 mm 
using spiral CT scan), lymph nod es (shortest diameter > 10 mm t o < 15 mm) and 
any of the following: 
 Bone lesions. 
 Ascites. 
 Pleural or pericardial effusion. 
 Lymphangitis cutis or pulmonis. 
 Abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging  
techniques. 
 Cystic lesions. 
 Lesions occurring within a previo usly irradiated area unless th ey are 
documented as new lesions since the completion of radiation the rapy. 
	Note . If only a single, asymptomatic  bone lesion is present at base line, and 
will be irradiated, the metastatic  nature of this lesion must b e 
confirmed by X-r ay, CT, or MRI. 
9.2.4	Target	(nodal	and	visceral)	Lesions	
Following RECIST 1.1 Criteria, progression in a nodal or viscer al site (i.e. liver and 
lung) is sufficient to document disease progression. The presen ce or absence of 
nodal and visceral disease before and after treatment should be  recorded 
separately. 
All measurable lesions (up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total) will be identified as target lesions to be measured and recorded at baseline. 
The target lesions should be representative of all involved org ans. Target lesions 
will be selected on the basis of size (i.e. the largest area) a nd suitability for accurate, 
repeated measurements (either by  imaging techniques or clinical ly). The sum of the 
longest diameter (LD) of all non- nodal and shortest diameter (n odal) target lesions 
will be calculated and reported a s the baseline sum LD. The bas eline sum LD will be 
used as a reference by which to characterize the objective tumo r response. 
Because small lymph no des are difficult to measure accurately a nd may not be 
malignant, to be considered pathologically enlarged and measura ble, a lymph node 
Bipolar Androgen Therapy and Nivolumab in mCRPC IRB00164973 
Johns Hopkins University  
 59 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 must be > 15 mm in short axis whe n assessed by CT scan (CT scan  slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). 
  
9.2.5	Bone	Lesions	
When the bone scan is the sole indicator of progression, diseas e progression in bone 
is defined as ≥ 2 new lesions see n on bone scan compared with a  prior scan for used 
trial entry. In situations where  scan findings suggest a flare reaction or where new 
lesion(s) may represent trauma, confirm these results with othe r imaging 
modalities (e.g. MRI or fine-cut CT). If many new areas of upta ke are observed, 
confirmation is generally not necessary. 
9.2.6	Nontarget 	Lesions	
All other lesions (or sites of di sease) will be identified as n ontarget lesions and 
recorded at baseline. Nontarget lesions will inclu de measurable  lesions that exceed 
the maximum number per organ (2) or total of all involved organ s (5), as well as 
nonmeasurable lesions. The presen ce or absence of these lesions  will be recorded 
on the CRF and should be evaluated at the same assessment time points as all target 
lesions. 
9.2.7	New	Lesions	
	 The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progres sion. There are 
 no specific criteria for the id entification of new radiographi c lesions; however, the 
 finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal, i.e. not attrib utable to differences in 
 scanning technique, change in im aging modality or findings tho ught to represent 
 something other than tumor (for example, some “new” bone lesio ns may be simply 
 healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). 		
 
9.3	Response 	Criteria	for	Primary 	and	Secondary 	Endpoints 	
9.3.1	Measurable 	Soft‐tissue	Lesions	
When evaluating soft-tissue lesi ons, the definitions in Table 4  apply. 
Table 4. RECIST	1.1	Response 	Criteria	for	Target	Lesions  
Response 	 Evaluation 	of	Target	Lesions	
Complete response 
(CR) Disappearance of all target les ions. Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.  
Partial response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of dia meters of target 
lesions, taking as reference th e baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive disease 
(PD)  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference th e smallest sum on study (this 
includes the baseline sum if that  is the smallest on study). In  
addition to the relative increas e of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥ 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progression). 
Bipolar Androgen Therapy and Nivolumab in mCRPC IRB00164973 
Johns Hopkins University  
 60 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 Stable disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
 In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish resid ual disease from 
normal tissue. When the evaluation  of complete response depends  on this 
determination, it is recommended  that the residual lesion be in vestigated (e.g. fine 
needle aspirate or biopsy) befor e confirming the complete respo nse status. 
Changes in nodal and visceral si tes should be recorded and repo rted separately, and 
lymph nodes in the pelvis must m easure ≥ 15 mm in shortest diam eter to be 
considered target lesions. Complete elimination of disease at a  particular site 
should be recorded separately. Any favorable change should be c onfirmed using a 
second follow-up scan. 
9.3.2	PSA	
For each patient, use a waterfa ll plot to report the percent ch ange in PSA from 
baseline to 12 weeks (or earlier for those who discontinue ther apy) and the 
maximum decline in PSA that occurs at any point after treatment .  We will also 
report the proportion of patient s to achieve a 50% of greater d ecrease in PSA from 
baseline (i.e. PSA
50 response rate). 
9.3.3	Bone	
Record post-treatment changes as  either “no new lesions” or “ne w lesions.” 
 In the absence of clearly worseni ng soft-tissue (nodal and visc eral) disease or 
disease-related symptoms, progre ssion at the first scheduled as sessment should be 
confirmed on a second scan performed ≥ 6 weeks later. In the ra re case where 
visible lesions disappear, th is too should be confirmed. 
9.3.4	Nontarget 	Lesions	
When assessing nontarget lesions, the definitions in Table 5 wi ll apply. 
 
Table 5. RECIST	1.1	Response 	Criteria	for	Nontarget 	Lesions  
Response 	 Evaluation 	of	Nontarget 	Lesions	
Complete response 
(CR) The disappearance of a ll nontarget lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker l evels. All lymph nodes must 
be non-pathological in si ze (< 10 mm short axis). 
Non-CR/non-PD The persistence of one or more nontarget lesions and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker levels above the normal limits.

 61 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 9.4	Criteria	for	Progressive 	Disease. 	
9.4.1	Measurable 	Soft‐tissue	Lesions	
When evaluating soft-tissue lesi ons, the definitions in Table 4  apply. 
In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish resid ual disease from 
normal tissue. When the evaluation  of complete response depends  on this 
determination, it is recommended  that the residual lesion be in vestigated (e.g. fine 
needle aspirate or biopsy) befor e confirming the complete respo nse status. 
Progression in a nodal or visceral site should be defined using  RECIST 1.1 Criteria 
(Table 4).  
9.4.2	PSA	
Per the PCWG3, PSA progression is  defined as the date that a 25 % or greater 
increase and an absolute increase of 2 ng/mL or more from the n adir is documented 
and confirmed by a second value obtained 3 or more weeks later.  Where no decline 
from baseline is documented, PSA progression is defined as a 25 % increase from the 
baseline value along with an in crease in absolute value of 2 ng /mL or more after 12 
weeks of treatment. 
9.4.3	Bone	
Progressing disease on bone scan is considered when at least 2 new lesions are 
observed. Yet, progression remai ns unconfirmed unless at least 2 additional  new 
lesions appear at a subsequent time point. 
Unless clinically indicated, ther e is no need to perform a foll ow-up bone scan before 
12 weeks of treatment. To define disease progression requires a  confirmatory scan 
(which shows additional new lesion s compared with the first fol low-up scan) 
performed ≥ 6 weeks la ter. When further progression is document ed on the 
confirmatory scan, the date of p rogression recorded for the tri al is the date of the 
first scan that shows the change. 
9.4.4	Nontarget 	Lesions	
When assessing nontarget lesions, the definitions in Table 5 ap ply.

10.1	Data	Entry	
Data collected during this study will be entered into a secure database. Staff at Johns 
Hopkins University will be responsible for the initial study co nfiguration and setup in the 
CRMS database and for any future changes. 
10.1.1	Case	Report	Forms	Completion
	
Electronic Case report forms will be generated by the coordinat ing center for the 
collection of all stud y data. Investigators will be responsible  for ensuring that the 
CRFs are kept up-to-date. 
The paper Eligibility Checklist CRF must be completed using bla ck ink.  Any errors 
must be crossed out so that the original entry is still visible , the correction clearly 
indicated and then initialed and  dated by the individual making  the correction. 
eCRFs will be completed within 2 weeks of the patient coming to  the clinic and all 
relevant supporting do cumentation such as sc ans, progress notes , nursing notes, 
blood work, pathology reports, et c., will be submitted via emai l to the SKCCC 
Coordinating Center Study Manage r.  All patient names or other identifying 
information will be removed prior to being sent to the Coordina ting Center (SKCCC)

document transfer based on each institution’s guidelines.  
Authorized representatives of the Coordinating Center (SKCCC) m ay visit the 
satellite sites to perform audi ts or inspections, including sou rce data verification. 
The purpose of these audits or i nspections is to systematically  and independently 
examine all trial-related activi ties and documents to determine  whether these 
activities were conducted and data were recorded, analyzed, and  accurately 
reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP ), and any applicable 
regulatory requirements. 
10.1.2	Source	Documents 	
Study personnel will record clini cal data in each  patient’s sou rce documents (i.e. the 
patient’s medical record). Source documentation will be made av ailable to support 
the patient research record. Stu dy monitors will review entries  on the CRFs at 
regular intervals, comparing the content with source documents.  
10.1.3	Record	Retention 	
The Investigator will maintain a dequate and accu rate records to  enable the conduct 
of the study to be fully documented and the study data to be su bsequently verified. 
After study closure, the Investi gator will maintain all source documents, study-
related documents, and the CRFs. Because the length of time req uired for retaining 
records depends upon a number of regulatory  and legal factors, documents should 
be stored until the Investigator is notified that the documents  may be destroyed. In 
this study, records are to be re tained and securely stored for a minimum of 5 years 
after the completion of all study activities. 
10.2	Data	Management 	
10.2.1	Lead	Research 	Program	Coordinators 	
A Lead research program coordina tor at the coordinating center will be assigned to 
the study. A Lead Research Progr am Coordinator will manage the study activities at 
each of the participating sites.  The responsibilities of the Le ad Research Program 
Coordinator include project compl iance, data collection, data e ntry, data reporting, 
regulatory monitoring , problem resolution and prioritization, a nd coordination of 
the activities of the protocol team. 
10.3	Study	Monitoring 	and	Quality	Assurance 	
Regularly scheduled registration reports will be generated to m onitor patient accruals and 
the completeness of registration data. Routine data quality rep orts will be generated to 
assess missing data and inconsis tencies. Accrual rates and the extent and accuracy of 
evaluations and follow-up will be  monitored periodically throug hout the study period, and 
potential problems will be broug ht to the attention of the prin cipal investigator for 
discussion and action. 
Random-sample data quality and p rotocol compliance audits will be conducted by the study 
team at least once a year, more f requently if indicated. Audits  by the coordinating center 
may entail (1) shipping source d ocuments and research records f or selected patients from 
participating sites to the coordi nating center for audit, or (2 ) on-site auditing of selected 
patient records at participating sites.

 Data	and	Safety	Monitoring: 		
This is a DSMP Medium Risk study  under the SKCCC Data and Safet y Monitoring Plan 
(6/5/2020). Data Monito ring of this protoco l will occur annuall y. The protocol will be 
monitored internally at SKCCC by t he Principal Investigator. Th e SKCCC Compliance 
Monitoring Program will provide external monitoring for JHU aff iliated sites in accordance 
with SKCCC DSMP (Version 6.0, 02/21/2019). The SMC Subcommittee  will determine the 
level of patient safety risk and  level/frequency of monitoring.   
Additionally, scheduled meetings  will take place monthly and wi ll include the protocol 
Principal Investigator , research nurse, data  manager, and, when  appropriate, the 
collaborators, subinvestigators, and biostatistician involved w ith the conduct of the 
protocol. 
During these meetings the invest igators will discuss matters re lated to: the safety of 
protocol participants, validity and integrity of the data, enro llment rate relative to 
expectation, characteristics of participants, retention of part icipants, adherence to protocol 
(potential or real protocol viol ations), data completeness, and  progress of data for 
secondary objectives. 
 
10.4	Clinical	Trial	Agreement 	
This trial is being conducted un der one or more clinical trial agreements that contain, 
among other terms, the publication policy, indemnity agreements , and financial 
arrangements for the study.
11.	STATISTICAL 	CONSIDERATIONS 	
The primary endpoint will be the proportion of subjects who ach ieve a PSA response, 
defined as a 50% or greater decli ne in PSA from b aseline, confi rmed on a subsequent 
measurement at least 4 weeks apart. The treatment regimen would  be considered of 
insufficient activity for further  study in this population if t he PSA response rate is 25% or 
less. The sample size is calculate d to detect an improved PSA r esponse rate from 25% (null 
hypothesis) to 45% (alternative) . A minimax Simon two stage des ign is planned. A total of 
23 patients will be entered in th e first stage. A planned analy sis will be performed 12 weeks 
after the last patient in the first stage receives the first do se of nivolumab.  If ≤ 5 subjects 
have a PSA response, the study will be terminated and we will c onclude the regimen is 
ineffective. If ≥ 6 subjects res pond, then an additional 16 pat ients will be studied, for a total 
of 39 patients. If a total of ≤ 13 subjects respond in stage on e and two combined, we 
consider this regimen ineffectiv e. If a total of ≥ 14 respond, we conclude the regimen is 
promising and warrants further study. The maximum sample size w ill be increased to 44 
patients to account for 10% possi ble dropouts and unevaluable p atients.   
 This design provides 90% power t o detect an abso lute 20% increa se in PSA response rate 
with a one-sided type I error of  0.1. The probability of early stopping is 0.49 under the null 
hypothesis that the PSA
50 response rate is 25%.

11.1.1	Analysis	of	the	Primary	Endpoint 	
The primary endpoint of this study is PSA 50 response, defined as a decrease in the 
PSA to 50% less than the baseline PSA upon enrollment in the tr ial. The decrease 
must be confirmed by a second measurement at least 4 weeks apar t. For purposes of 
meeting the primary endpoint, pa tients will be considered to ha ve done so if they 
have a PSA 50 response only while on therapy with Testosterone +/- Nivolumab . PSA 
values will be measured each cy cle during the trial.  All patie nts who are 
administered at least one dose o f Testosterone will be consider ed evaluable for the 
primary endpoint. If patients do not have follow-up PSAs after initiation of 
Testosterone therapy due to withdrawing consent or being lost t o follow-up for 
example, then they will be replaced.   
We will estimate the PSA 50 response rate, along with  the exact 95% confidence 
interval, for the population of patients. 
   
11.1.2	Analysis	of	Secondary 	Endpoints 	
 
11.1.2.1	Safety  
Patients will be assessed for toxi cities at each clinical evalu ation. Toxicities 
will graded according to  the most current CT CAE standardized gr ading 
scales.  The incidence of grade 3-5 toxicities will be reported . Patients will be 
assessed for toxicity a s long as they are taking Testosterone + /- Nivolumab, 
and patients will continue to be  followed if treatment is disco ntinued for 
toxicity until the toxicities im prove to grade 1  or resolve. 
Toxicities will be reported as a  tabulated table by type and gr ade. 
 
	11.1.2.2	PSA	Progression ‐free	Survival	(PSA‐PFS)   
A standard definition of PSA progression per PCWG3 will be used . PSA-PFS 
will be defined as an increase in  25% over a nadir value, confi rmed by a 
follow-up PSA at least 4 weeks apart. If patients are removed f rom study 
prior to PSA progression, then th ey will be censored at that ti me. 
  We will use the Kaplan-Meier method to summarize the median P SA PFS. 
 			11.1.2.3	Progression ‐free	Survival	(PFS)	
Progression-free survival will be  measured from the time of fir st dose to 
objective tumor progression as d efined by RECIST 1.1 for progre ssive 
disease or death and summarized using a Kaplan-Meier curve. Pro gression 
will be assigned to the earliest observed time. Patients whose disease has 
not progressed at follow-up will be censored at the date when t he last tumor 
assessment determined a  lack of progression.  
  We will use the Kaplan-Meier method to summarize the median P FS. 
  11.1.2.4	Objective
	Response 	Rate	(ORR)	
Bipolar Androgen Therapy and Nivolumab in mCRPC IRB00164973 
Johns Hopkins University  
 66 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 The objective response rate is defined as the percentage of pat ients who 
achieve an objective response by RECIST 1.1 criteria (i.e. Comp lete response 
or Partial Response) to Testosterone +/- Nivolumab. 
We will estimate the objective response rate, along with the ex act 95% 
confidence interval, for the pop ulation of patients with RECIST  1.1 evaluable 
disease.

 		 11.1.2.6	Overall	Survival	(OS)	
Overall survival will be defined  as the time from study enrollm ent to death 
or up to 2 years after the last dose of study treatment.  
This will be analyzed as  a Kaplan-Meier plot. 
	
11.1.3	Analysis	of	Exploratory 	Endpoints 	
	
	 11.1.3.1	Estimate	the	Percentage 	of	Patients	with	a	Pathogenic 	Somatic	or	Germline 		
			 Mutation 	in	a	HR	or	MMR	Gene	Mutation 	
The somatic DNA mutations present in the tumor will be identifi ed through 
Foundation Medicine sequencing. Germline DNA mutation testing p er 
standard of care practice will be  done using clinical-grade tes
ting in a CLIA-
certified laboratory (i.e. COLOR  genomics) for consenting subje cts only. 
Patients with a germline or soma tic deleterious mutation or del etion in the 
pre-specified gene list (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CHEK2, NBN, RAD50, RAD51C, 
RAD51D, PALB2, MRE11, FANCA, FAN CB, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF , 
FANCG, FANCI, FANCL, FANCM, MLH1 , MLH3, MSH2, MS H3, MSH6, PMS1 
and PMS2) will be considered biomarker positive. For biomarker positive 
and biomarker negative sub jects, we will calculate PSA 50 response rates with 
confidence intervals for hypothesis generation.  
				 11.1.3.2	PD‐1,	PD‐L1,	CD4,	CD8,	FOXP3,	γH2AX,	RAD51,	53BP1	Protein	Levels:		
Subjects will have pre-treatment , on-treatment (and at progress ion) tumor 
biopsy specimens analyzed.  IHC staining for PD-1 and PD-L1 wil l be 
performed on the pre-treatment samples and scored as <1%, 1-5%,  5-10%, 
>10% and the results will be associated with responses for both  proteins, 
separately, using descriptive st atistics and Fisher’s Exact Tes ts. 
Immunofluorescence will be used to quantify the median intensit y of each 
gamma-H2AX, RAD51m and 53BP1 foc i per cell as well determine th e 
median number of foci per cell on the pretreatment biopsies. Us ing   
 analytical microscopy, Drs. Meek er and Heaphy have developed i maging 
software which can isolate single nuclei and quantify both the intensity and 
number of immunofluorescent foci per nucleus (i.e. per cell). U sing FFPE 
tissue obtained at biopsy, we wi ll examine the change in DNA da mage foci 
number and intensity (reported as median percent change) induce d by BAT 
+/- Nivolumab in PSA

Johns Hopkins University  
 67 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 Using imaging software, we will count the number of CD4+ and CD 8+ 
lymphocytes in pre-treatment and  on-treatment biopsies. We will  correlate 
PSA 50 responses with CD4+ and CD8+ ly mphocyte tumor infiltration. 
		 11.1.3.3	MANAs/TAAs 	Assay		
Whole-exome sequencing will be p erformed on pre-treatment sampl es, after 
12 weeks of BAT lead-in therapy, and post-progression tumor and  matched 
normal samples. Exome data will be applied in a neoantigen pred iction 
pipeline that evaluate s antigen processing, MHC binding, and ge ne 
expression to generate neoantige ns specific to the patient’s HL A haplotype. 
Truncal neoantigens will be iden tified by correcting for tumor purity and 
ploidy. Putative neoantigens wi ll then be used to generate pept ides and 
stimulate autologous T cells, fo llowed by TCR nex t-generation s equencing. 
  11.1.3.4		Cytokines 	and	Chemokines 	Analysis	
Milliplex human cytokine/chemokine Immunology Multiplex Assay (Millipore-Sigma) will be used to assay acut e effects of BAT on  production of 
cytokines and chemokines. Plasma samples are obtained at prior to the first 
BAT injection on C1D1, 3 hours after the first BAT injection (C 1D1), 3 days 
after the first BAT injection (C1D4), prior to C2D1, and prior to C7D1.  
Samples will be processed and st ored in the Denmeade Laboratory  and 
analyzed by the Immune Processing Core Lab at Johns Hopkins. 
11.2	Analysis 	Populations 	
11.2.1	Intent‐to‐treat/Response ‐to‐treatment/Evaluable 	Population 	
All patients who meet eligibility  criteria and receive at least  1 dose of testosterone 
will be included in the main analysis of the response rate, eve n if there are major 
protocol deviations (e.g. incorre ct treatment schedule or drug administration). Each 
patient will be assigned to one of the following categories:  
Table 6. Categories 	for	Response 	to	Treatment  
Category 	 Response 	
1 Complete response 
2 Partial response 
3 Stable disease 
4 Progressive disease 
5 Early death from malignant disease 
6 Early death from toxicity 7 Early death from other causes 
8 Unknown (not assessabl e/insufficient data) 
NOTE:  By arbitrary convention, c ategory 8 designates unknown s tatus in a 
clinical database. Patients in response categories 4 to 6 will be 
considered to have tre atment failure (disease progression) Pati ents in 
response categories 7 and 8 will be censored (i.e. stable disea se) or 
considered disease progression at the discretion of the PI. 
Bipolar Androgen Therapy and Nivolumab in mCRPC IRB00164973 
Johns Hopkins University  
 68 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021  Conclusions are to be based on the population of all eligible p atients. Subanalyses 
may be performed on various subsets of patients, such as those with no major 
protocol deviations or those who continued in the study for the  entire treatment 
period (i.e. did not withdraw pr ematurely). Subanalysis will no t serve as the basis 
for drawing conclusions concerning treatment efficacy. 
11.2.2	Safety	Population 	
All patients enrolled in the stu dy will be included in the safe ty analysis population 
and considered evaluable for tox icity and safety from the time of their first dose. 
Demographic and baseline charact eristics for the safety populat ion will be 
summarized by number and percent  for categorical data (e.g. sex , race/ethnicity) 
and by descriptive statistics for continuous data (e.g. weight,  vital signs, EKG 
readings, disease status). 
11.3	Safety	Analysis 	
11.3.1	Evaluation 	of	Adverse	Events	
Treatment-emergent adverse event s will be translated from inves tigator terms to 
MedDRA v.20.1 terminology and su mmarized (number and percentage  of patients) 
for all patients who receive at least 1 dose. Ad verse event sum maries will be 
organized by body system, freque ncy of occurrence, intensity (i .e. severity grade), 
and causality or attribution. Pat ients who experience an advers e event more than 
once will be counted only once. T he occurrence with the maximum  severity will be 
used to calculate intensity. 
11.3.2	Evaluation 	of	Serious	Adverse	Events	and	Premature 	Withdrawals 	
Adverse events deemed serious an d those resulting in treatment withdrawal or 
death will be summarized separa tely. Narrative paragraphs will be generated to 
describe the circumstances su rrounding each SAE and death. 
11.3.3	Evaluation 	of	
Laboratory 	Parameters 	and	Assays	
Selected clinical laboratory par ameters will be s ummarized and clinically significant 
changes from baseline will be discussed. 
11.3.4	Extent	of	Exposure 	
Treatment exposure will be summa rized for all pa tients, includi ng dose 
administration, number of cycles, dose modifications or delays,  and duration of 
therapy. 
12.	PROTECTION 	OF	HUMAN	SUBJECTS

 69 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 12.2		 Protocol	Amendments 	
Before starting the study, the protocol must be approved by eac h institution’s IRB or 
Independent Ethics Committee (IEC). Amendments to the protocol may be made 
only with consent of the lead sit e/sponsor and principal invest igator and are subject 
to IRB approval before instituting. 
12.3		 Written	Informed 	Consent	
Before obtaining consent, members of the study team will review  the rationale for 
the treatment program with the p atient. The discussion will rev iew the alternatives 
available (including hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, or support ive care as 
appropriate), the potential bene fits of this program, the risks  and the probability of 
their occurrence, and the procedu res to minimize these risks. S hould an adverse 
event occur, the provisions avai lable to ensure medical interve ntion will also be 
reviewed. Why the risks are reas onable in relation to the antic ipated benefits, 
incentives, or costs that will or may be incurred as a result o f participating in the 
study, as well as the efforts to  maintain confidentiality, will  also be discussed with 
the patient. 
Patients will be required to sig n and date (in duplicate) a sta tement of informed 
consent that meets the requirements of the Code of Federal Regu lations (Federal 
Register Vol. 46, No. 17, January  27, 1981, part 50) and the IR B. The medical record 
will include a statement that written informed consent was obta ined (and document 
the date that it was obtained) before the patient is enrolled i n the study. The original 
signed document will become part of the patient’s medical recor d, a copy will be 
forwarded to the lead site/spons or pursuant to sponsor registra tion, and a copy will 
be sent home with each patient. 
The consent form will include the following: 
 The nature and objectives, poten tial toxicities,  and benefits o f the intended 
study. 
 The length of therapy and li kely follow-up required. 
 Alternatives to the proposed the rapy (including available stand ard and 
investigational therapies). 
 The name of the invest igator(s) responsible for the protocol. 
 The right of the patient to acce pt or refuse treatment and to w ithdraw from 
participation in this study. 
 Text regarding the coordinating center should be added to all i nstitutional 
informed consent documents. 
12.4		 Protection 	of	Privacy	
Patients will be informed of the extent to which their confiden tial health 
information generated from this study may be used for research purposes. After this 
discussion, they will be asked to sign a Notice of Privacy Prac tice research 
authorization/HIPAA form. The original signed documents will be come part of the 
patient’s medical records, and ea ch patient will receive a copy  of the signed 
documents. The use and disclosure  of protected health informati on will be limited to 
the individuals described in the  research authorization form. T he research 
authorization form must be compl eted by the principal investiga tor and approved 
by the IRB.

 70 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 12.5		 Terminating 	or	Modifying 	the	Study	
Adverse event and laboratory dat a from this trial will be asses sed by the medical 
monitor (Dr. Mark Markowski) on an ongoing basis. At least quar terly, data from the 
clinical database will be reviewe d. The results of this review will be shared with all 
investigators either in writing or as part of a teleconference.  SAEs will be reviewed 
as they are reported to the lead site/sponsor, and the medical monitor will make an 
assessment regarding th e safety of continui ng or modifying the study. This 
assessment will be shared with the  investigators either in writ ing or as part of a 
teleconference as well as with BM S. Should the assessment of ei ther the lead 
site/sponsor or the principal investigator be that the study sh ould be terminated, 
the study will be closed to furth er accrual. Patients who are r eceiving Testosterone 
+/- Nivolumab will be  assessed individually  by the investigator  to see if it is in the 
patients’ best interest to continue, which might be the case fo r a patient that is 
responding to the intervention. F ollow-up safety assessments wi ll be performed for 
all patients who are terminated from the study prematurely. Any  planned data 
disclosures will also b e discussed with BMS.

 75 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021  APPENDIX 	A:	MANAGEMENT 	ALGORITHM 	FOR	IMMUNO ‐ONCOLOGY 	AGENTS	
 
 These general guidelines constitute guidance to the Investigato r. The guidance applies to all 
immuno-oncology agents and regimens.  A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be di ligently evaluated according to 
standard medical practice. Non-in flammatory etiologies should b e considered and 
appropriately treated.   Corticosteroids are a primary therapy for immuno-oncology drug- related adverse events. 
The oral equivalent of the recom mended IV doses may be consider ed for ambulatory 
patients with low-grade toxicity . The lower bioavailability of oral corticosteroids should be 
taken into account when switchin g to the equivalent dose of ora l corticosteroids. 
 For subjects expected who require more than 4 weeks of corticos teroids or other 
immunosuppressants to manage an a dverse event, consider the fol lowing 
recommendations:   
 Antimicrobial/antifungal prophyla xis per institutional guidelin es to prevent 
opportunistic infections such as  Pneumocystis jiroveci (PJP) an d fungal infections. 
 
 Early consultation with an infect ious disease specialist should  be considered. 
Depending on the presentation, c onsultation with a pulmonologis t for bronchoscopy 
or a gastroenterologist for endo scopy may also be appropriate. 
 
 In patients who develop recurrent  adverse events in the setting  of ongoing or prior 
immunosuppressant use, an opportunistic infection should be con sidered in the 
differential diagnosis. 
 
 Consultation with a medical or s urgical specialist, especially prior to an invasive 
diagnostic or therapeutic p rocedure, is recommended. 
 The frequency and severity of th e related adverse events covere d by these algorithms will 
depend on the immuno-oncology agent or regimen being used.

AMINOTRANSFERASE 	AND	TOTAL	BILIRUBIN 	–	HY’S	LAW	
	
1. INTRODUCTION 	
 During the course of the study t he Investigator will remain vig ilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry. The investigator is responsible for determining w hether a patient meets potential 
Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any p oint during the study. The Inve stigator participates, together with 
BMS clinical project representa tives, in review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to 
agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) crite ria are met. HL criteria are m et if there is no alternative 
explanation for the elevations in liver biochemistry other than  Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) 
caused by the Investigational Me dicinal Product (IMP). The Inve stigator is responsible for 
recording data pertaining to PHL /HL cases and for reporting Adv erse Events (AE) and Serious 
Adverse Events (SAE) according to the outcome of the review and  assessment in line with standard 
safety reporting processes.  
2. DEFINITIONS 	
 Potential Hy’s Law (PHL): 
 Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)  or Alanine Aminotransferase (A LT) ≥ 3x Upper Limit of 
Normal (ULN) and Total Bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2xULN at any point dur ing the study irrespective 
of an increase in Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP).  
 Hy’s Law (HL): 
 AST or ALT ≥ 3xULN and TBL ≥ 2xU LN, where no other reason, othe r than the IMP, can be 
found to explain the combination of increases, e.g. elevated AL P indicating cholestasis, viral 
hepatitis, another drug.  
 3. IDENTIFICATION 	OF	POTENTIAL 	HY’S	LAW	CASES	
 In order to identify cases of PHL it is important to perform a comprehensive revi ew of laboratory 
data for any patient who meets any of the following identificat ion criteria in isolation or in 
combination: 
• ALT ≥ 3xULN • AST ≥ 3xULN 
• TBL ≥ 2xULN 
 The Investigator will without de lay review each new laboratory report and if the identification 
criteria are met will: 
• Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Section 2  of this Appendix for 
definition) by reviewing laborato ry reports from all previous v isits. 
• Promptly enter the laboratory data into the laboratory CRF.

 95 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 4. FOLLOW‐UP	
 Potential 	Hy’s	Law	Criteria	not	met	
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will : 
• Perform follow-up on subsequent l aboratory results according to  the guidance provided in 
the Clinical Study Protocol. 
 Potential 	Hy’s	Law	Criteria	met	
If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investigator will: 
• Notify the BMS representative wh o will then inform the central Study Team. 
• The Study Physician contacts the  Investigator, to provide guida nce, discuss and agree an 
approach for the study patients’ follow-up and the continuous r eview of data. Subsequent to 
this contact the Investigator will: 
 Monitor the patient until liver biochemistry parameters and app ropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to nor mal or baseline levels, or as l ong as medically 
indicated. 
 Investigate the etiology of the event and perform diagnostic in vestigations as 
discussed with the Study Physician. 
 Complete the three Liver CRF Modules as information becomes ava ilable. 
 If at any time (in consultation with the Study Physician) the P HL case meets serious 
criteria, report it as an SAE using standard reporting procedur es. 
  5. REVIEW	AND	ASSESSMENT 	OF	POTENTIAL 	HY’S	LAW	CASES	
 The instructions in this Section should be followed for all cas es where PHL criteria are met.  No 
later than 3 weeks afte r the biochemistry abnormality was initi ally detected, the Study 
Physician contacts the Investiga tor in order to review availabl e data and agree on whether 
there is an alternative explanation for meeting PHL criteria ot her than DILI caused by the 
IMP. BMS and the Principal Investigator will also be involved i n this review together with other 
subject matter experts as approp riate. According to the outcome  of the review and assessment, the 
Investigator will follow the instructions below: 
 If there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AS T and TBL elevations, a 
determination of whether the alt ernative explanation is an AE w ill be made and subsequently 
whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE: 
• If the alternative explanation is  not an AE, record the alterna tive explanation on the 
appropriate CRF. 
• If the alternative explanation is  an AE/SAE, record the AE/SAE in the CRF accordingly and 
follow BMS standard processes. 
 If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain  the ALT or AST and to tal bilirubin level 
elevations other than the IMP: 
• Report an SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to BMS standar d processes. 
 The ‘Medically Important’ seriou s criterion should be used if n o other serious 
criteria apply. 
 As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causa lity assessment of 
“related” should be assigned.

Johns Hopkins University  
 96 of 97 COMBAT-CRPC Protocol Version 8.0 Date: June 9, 2021 If, there is an unavoidable dela y of over 3 weeks in obtaining the information ne cessary to assess 
whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is a ssumed that there is no alternative 
explanation until such time as a n informed decision can be made : 
• Report an SAE (report term “Pote ntial Hy’s Law”) applying serio us criteria and causality 
assessment as per above. 
• Continue follow-up and review a ccording to agreed plan. Once th e necessary supplementary 
information is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to de termine whether HL 
criteria are met. Update the SAE report according to the outcom e of the review. 
  6. ACTIONS 	REQUIRED 	FOR	REPEAT	EPISODES 	OF	POTENTIAL 	HY’S	LAW	
 This section is applicable when a patient meets PHL criteria on  study treatment and has 
already met PHL criteria at a pre vious on study treatment visit .   
 The requirement to conduct follo w-up, review and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of 
PHL is based on the nature of th e alternative cause identified for the previous occurrence. 
The investigator should determine the cause for the previous oc currence of PHL criteria being 
met and answer the following question:  
• Was the alternative cause for th e previous occurrence of PHL cr iteria being met chronic or 
progressing malignant disease? 
 
 If No: follow the process descri bed in Section 4 of this Append ix. 
 If Yes: Determine if there has b een a significant change in the  patient’s condition# 
compared with when PHL crite ria were previously met. 
 If there is no significant c hange no action is required. 
 If there is a significant change  follow the process described i n Section 4 of 
this Appendix.  
A “significant” change in the pa tient’s condition refers to a c linically relevant ch ange in any of the 
individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST or total bil irubin) in isolation or in 
combination, or a clinically rele vant change in associated symp toms. The determination of whether 
there has been a significant cha nge will be at the discretion o f the Investigator , this may be in 
consultation with the Study Phys ician if there is any uncertain ty.

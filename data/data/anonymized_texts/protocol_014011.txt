Summarize plasma concentrations of lemborexant and its metabolites M4, M9, and M10
Conduct population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling for lembo rexant
Explore PK/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships between lemborexant concentrations and efficacy 
and safety variables
Study Design
E2006 -G000 -304 is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, active comparator (ZOL), 
parallel -group study of 2 dose levels of lemborexant for 30 nights in approximately 950 subjects 55 years or 
older with insomnia disorder. Subjects will be males 65 years or older or females 55 years or older. 
Approximately 60% of the subjects will be age 65 years or older. (revised per Amendment 03)
The study will have 2phases :The Prerandomization Phase and the Randomization Phase. The 
Prerandomization Phase will comprise 3 periods that w ill last up to a m aximum of 35 days: a Screening Period, 
a Run-in Period, and a Baseline Period. The Randomization Phase will comprise a Treatment Period during 
which subjects are treated for 30 nights ,and a minimum 14-day Follow -up Period before an End of Study 
(EOS) Visit. (revised per Amendment 02)
Throughout the Prerandomization Phase and the Randomization Phase, all subjects will undergo routine safety 
assessments at specified visits, including questioning regarding adverse events (AEs), 12-lead 
electrocardiograms (ECGs ), vital signs, weight, height, clinical hematology and chem istry analysis and 
urinalysis ,and s uicidality . 
Screening Period
The Screening Period will begin no more than 35days before the subject is randomized.  At the first visit, 
informed consent will be obtained after the study has been fully explained to each subject and before the 
conduct of any screening procedures or assessments.  A medical, psychiatric, and sleep history interview will be 
conducted, and will include confirm ation that the subject meets diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder, and 
further that the subject complains of difficulties with sleep maintenance and/or early morning awakening.
Screening assessments will include the ISI, as well as the Epworth Sleepin ess Scale (ESS), STOPBang, 
Internation al Restless Legs Scale (IRLS), and Munich Parasomnia Scale (MUPS), collectively called the Sleep 
Disorders Screening Battery (SDSB). Other assessments administered will include the FSS and EQ-5D-3L.  
Additional eligib ility criteria will be assessed and safety assessments including the electronic Columbia -Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale (eC-SSRS) will be conducted.   (revised per Amendment 02)
Eligible subjects will be provided with an electronic device on which they will complete the Sleep Diary.  
Subjects will be trained in the use of thisdevice .  Site staff will instruct subjects to complete the diary each 
morning within 1 hour after morning waketime and will emphasize the importance of doing so.  The Sleep 
Diary entrie s will be reviewed by site staff at least weekly throughout thestudy to ensure subject compliance 
with completion of the Sleep Diary and to ensure that study restrictions are met pertaining toduration of time 
spent in bed, and use of alcohol.  Subjects will also be reminded of study restrictions pertaining to timing of 
meals and caffeine use.

frequency of nights with symptoms of insomnia , subjects will undergo the second screening visit.  (Subjects 
who are not eligible based on Sleep Diary entries will return to the clinic for debriefing purposes and to return 
study equipment.) This visit must occur between Day -17 and Day  -10.  On this and all n ights on which PSG is
recorded, subjects will arrive atthe clinic in the evening with sufficient time before bedtime to comple te check -
in procedures, any scheduled assessments, and preparations (eg, electrode montage placem ent) for the PSG 
recordings. In addition, at check -in before all visits at which PSG is to be recorded, subjects will undergo a 
urine drug test. (revised per Amendment 02)
After check -inhas been completed, study personnel will familiarize subjects with the postural stability 
assessment (Cognitive Drug Research [CDR ]posture assessment ) and will also conduct a minimum of 2 
training sessions forthe cognitive performance assessment battery (PAB).  Subjects will then undergo an 
8-hour PSG recording, to start at the median habitual bedtime (MHB) as calculated from the Sleep Diary 
entries .  The PSG recording will include channels in the electrode montage to screen for symptoms of sleep 
apnea and periodic limb movement disorder.   Within 5 minutes of morning waketime, theCDR posture and 
PAB assessments will be administered under the same conditions (eg, timing of assessments relative to 
waketime, ambient lighting), as will be employed during the testing sessions .  The CDR posture and PAB 
assessments at this time are for familiarization purposes only.  At 1.5 hours after waketime , subjects will rate 
their morning sleepiness level.  ThePSG will be reviewed for exclusion criteria related to symptoms of sleep 
apnea and/or periodic limb movement disorder .  Subjects who continue to meet the eligibility criteria will then 
be dispensed PBO tablets (single -blind) and will enter the Run -in Period.
Run-in Period
The Run-in Period will begin when eligible subjects are dispensed PBO tablets and will continue until the 
Baseline Period on Day 1.  During the Run-in Period subjects will take PBO each night immediately (ie, within 
5 minutes) before bedtime (defined as the time the subject intends to try to fall asleep ).  They will be reminded 
that they must remain in bed for at least 7 hours each night and maintain a regular bedtime and waketime 
throughout the study , according to the schedule determined by the study site and the subject . They  will also be 
reminded that they must follow  study restrictions with regard to timing of meals and use of caffeine and 
alcohol.  
When subjects have completed the Sleep Diary on at lea st7 consecutive mornings during the Run -in Period ,the 
diary will be reviewed for continued eligibility with regard to whether the subject continues to report sWASO 
≥60 minutes onat least 3 of the 7 nights , as well as the schedule and duration of time spentin bed.  Subjects 
who are still eligible will return to the clinic for the first of 2consecutive nights on which PSG w ill be recorded. 
The first of these 2 nights must be between Day -10 and Day -4.  In the evening, before the PSG recording, t he 
ISI, FSS, and EQ -5D-3L will be assessed .  The ISI score will be reviewed for eligibility ,and safety assessments 
will be conducted.  Study personnel will administer study drug to subjects within 5 minutes before their
scheduled bedtime, which will be at the same MHB as used for the second screening visit.  Subject swill 
undergo an 8-hour PSG.  The next morning ,subjects will undergo assessment sincluding the CDR posture and 
PAB assessments, willcomplete the Sleep Diary , and willrate their morning sleepiness level at 1.5 hours after 
waketime . (revised per Amendment 01)  The PSG recording will be reviewed for continued eligibility and 
subjects may then leave the clinic only after the investigator determines that is safe for them to do so.  (revised 
per Amendment 02)
Subjects will return to the clinic that evening.  Study person nel will administer study drug to subjects within 
5minutes before the scheduled bedtime.  A PSG will be recorded overnight .  The following morning subjects
will undergo postural stability and PAB assessments and will complete the Sleep Diary.  At 1.5 hours after 
waketime, subjects will rate their morning sleepiness level.  The PSG recording will be reviewed for continued 
eligibility, and both PSGs during theRun-in Period will also serve as the baseline for PSG-derived endpoints 
for subjects who are randomized. Subjects may then leave the clinic after the investigator determines that is 
safe for them to do so .
Subjects will continue to take study drug at home within 5 minutes before bedtime and they will continue to 
complete the Sleep Diary  each morning within 1 hour after morning waketime.  They will again be reminded 
that they must remain in bed for at least 7 hours each night , maintain a regular bedtime throughout the study ,
and follow study restrictions with regard to timing of meals and use of caffeine and alcohol .

Caffeine will be perm itted in limited quantities during the study.  Subjects will be advised to limit caffeine 
consumption to ≤4 cups of caffeinated beverages per day, or ≤400 m gcaffeine per day.  They will be instructed 
to avoid caffeine after 13:00on days when they are scheduled for a PSG recording and after 18:00 on all other 
days during the study.  
Alcohol will be permitted in limited quantities during the study.  Subjects may consume a maximum of

Com pliance with these restrictions will be monitored by specific questions on the Sleep D iary.
Prohibited medications include strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors and all CYP3A inducers.  Prohibited 
therapies also include any treatment for insomnia disorder, including any drugs or non-pharm acological 
treatment such as cognitive behavioral therapy; medications that are used for the purpose of inducing sleep 
(hypnotics) or inducing wakefulness (stimulants; except caffeine; see above) and medications that have known 
sedating effects or alerting effects. The prohibition applies even if the entire class to which that medication 
belongs is not prohibited (eg, anticonvulsants).  
If a medication is not on the list of prohibited medications but in the opinion of the investigator causes or 
exacerbates the subject’s insomnia, it must not be used throughou t the study.  If a m edication is not specified as 
prohibited but is in the same class as a medication that is listed in Appendix 3of the protocol, and if the 
investigator is uncertain whether the medication has known sedating or alerting effects, the Medi cal Monitor 
must be consulted.
If a subject starts any prohibited medication or therapy during the study, he/she must discontinue from the 
study, with the exception that certain prohibited medications may be used for a short duration (not to exceed 
2weeks) to treat an acute condition if this is agreed with the Medical Monitor. Note that strong CYP3A

Beck Depression Inventory –II
The BDI -II is a 21 -question multiple -choice self-report questionnaire that subjects will use to rate the presence, 
frequency, and severity of symptoms of depression using a 4-point Likert scale.  Scores on the BDI-II may 
range from 0 to 63, with higher scores indicating higher levels of depressive sympt oms.  Subjects with BDI-II 
scores greater than 19 w ill be excluded from participation.

Efficacy Assessments
Polysomnography (PSG)
Each PSG recording will include an electrode montage with electroencephalography (EEG), electromyograph y 
(EMG), electrooculography , and ECG channels, for scoring of sleep param eters and sleep architecture via 
standard sleep scoring criteria.  In addition, the first PSG will include channels for assessment of symptoms of 
sleep apnea and periodic limb movement disorder .
Trained PSG scorers w ill score PSG records in 30 -second epochs according to standard criteria.   The PS Gat the 
second screening visit will be used only to calculate the Apnea-Hypopnea Index and the Periodic Limb 
Movements with Arou sal Index for evaluation of eligibility criteria; sleep parameters and sleep architecture will 
not be evaluated from this PSG.  The 2 PSGs obtai ned during the Run-in Period will be used to a) determine 
eligibility and b) derive baseline PSG parameters for those subjects who are randomized.
All PSG param eters will be obtained separately for each PSG recording and averaged across the pairs of 
consecutive PSG nights.
The follow ing parameters will be derived from all PSGs:
LPS:  minutes from lights off to the first epoch of 20 consecutive epochs of non -wakefulness
SE:  proportion of time spent asleep per time in bed (TIB), calculated as TST/interval from lights off until 
lights on
WASO :  minutes of wake from the onset of persistent sleep until lights on 
WASO2H :  minutes of wake during the interval from 240 minutes after lights off until lights on 
TST:  minutes of sleep from sleep onset until terminal awakening 
Mean duration of long awakenings (DurLongAw ):  average duration of all long awakenings (with long 
awakening defined as 10 or more consecutive epochs [ie, 5 minutes or longer] scored as wake or N1, 
initiated with at least one epoch of wake, after onset of persistent sleep, and including any terminal 
awakening)
Additional sleep architecture parameters will also be calculated from each PSG, including:
Sleep onset latency : minutes from lights off to thefirst epoch of any stage of sleep (N1, N2, N3, REM)
(revised per Amendment 01)
 Number of awakenings after persistent sleep, with an awakening defined as at least 2consecutive epochs 
of wakefulness; an awakening cannot be interrupted by  stage N1, but must be interrupted by stage N2, N3,

Mean REM /NREM cycle duration
REM latency :  minutes from first epoch of sleep (N1, N2, N3)to first epoch of REM (revised per 
Amendment 01)
Each of these PSG-derived variables, with the exceptions of SE, REM episode frequency and duration, mean 
REM/NREM cycle duration, and REM latency, will also be calculated by hour and half of th e 8-hour TIB.  
Electronic Sleep Diary
The Sleep Diary will be completed within an hour of morning waketime on each morning of the study from 
Screening through the end of the study.  Sleep Diary entries may be maintained in paper format as a backup to 
the electronic Sleep Diary, if necessary.  This Sleep Diary will yield several self -reported measures of sleep that 
will be used to determine eligibility, as well as to assess efficacy and safety.   In addition, the Sleep Diary will 
include questions that relat e to morning sleepiness and to alcohol consumption.   (revised per Amendment 02)
Sleep parameters :
Subjective Sleep Onset Latency (sSOL) :  estimated minutes from the time that the subject attempts to sleep 
until sleep onset 
Subjective Wake After Sleep Onset (sWASO) :  sum of estimated minutes of wake during the night after 
initial sleep onset until the time that the subject stopped trying to sleep for the night
Subjective Total Sleep Time (sTST) :  derived minutes of sleep from sleep onset until the time the subject 
stopped tryi ng to sleep for the night
Subjective Sleep Efficiency (sSE) :  proportion of sTST per subjective time spent in bed, calculated as the 
interval from the time the subject report edattempt ingto sleep until the time the subject stopped trying to 
sleep for the night , and time spent asleep derived from subjective time spent in bed minus sWASO
Quality of Sleep:
The Sleep Diary will also be used to assess the subject’s perception of the quality of sleep on the previous night 
with the following question , “How  would you rate the quality of your sleep last night?”  Subjects will rate the 
quality of th eir sleep on a scale from 1 to 9 with 1 being extremely poor and 9 being extremely good .
Morning Sleepiness :
The Sleep Diary will also be used to assess subjective ratings of morning sleepiness with the following 
question: “How sleepy/alert do you feel this morning?”  Subjects will rate their sleepiness/alertness level on a 
scale from 1 to 9, w ith 1 being extremely sleepy, and 9 being extr emely alert .
The morning sleepiness question that is part of the electronic Sleep Diary will also be asked verbatim , using a 
paper -and-pencil format, at 1.5 hours after waketime each morning the subject is in the clinic following a PSG 
recording.  The rating on this question will be taken into consideration by the investigator when making the 
determination about whether it is safe for the subject to be discharged from the clini c.
Alcohol Consumption:
The Sleep Diary will include questions to askwhether the subject consumed alcohol the previous day within 3 
hours before bedtime, or exceeded the daily maximum of 2 alcoholic drinks, or both. (revised per 
Amendment 01)
Insomnia Severity Index 
The ISI is a 7-item self-report questionnaire assessing the nature, severity and impact of insomnia. The 
dimensions evaluated are severity ofsleep onset, sleep maintenance, early -morning awakening problem s; sleep 
dissatisfaction; interference of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning, noticeability of the sleep problems 
by others; and distress caused by the sleep difficulties. A 5-point Likert scale is used to rate each item (from  
0= no problem to 4 = very severe problem), yielding a total score from 0 to 28.

The FSS is a self-report scale on which subjects are instructed to choose a number from 1 to 7 that indicates 
their degree of agreement with each of 9 statements about their fatigue where “1” indicates strongly disagree 
and “7”, strongly agree. The FSS score is the sum of all responses to the 9 questions.  Higher scores indicate 
greater fatigue. 
Pharm acokinetic Assessments
A single blood sample for plasma concentrations of lemborexant and its metabolites M4, M9 and M10 or 
zolpidem will be taken at predefined visits.  The time and date of the 2 most recent dosesbefore each sample 
will be documented.
Pharm acodynamic Assessments
Postural S tability using the CDR Posture Assessment
Postural stability will be assessed using an apparatus similar to the Wright ataxiameter , and referred to as the 
CDR posture device .  The CDR posture device measures directional trunk movements (ie, body sway) through 
a cord placed around the subject’s waist and connected to the ataxiameter.  On the evening of the Screening 
PSG visit, subjects will be introduced to the CDR posture assess ment.  Subjects will stand on a firm surface 
with feet comfortably apart, either barefoot or wearing socks .  The standing position (inside heel-to-inside heel 
distance) and barefoot/socks conditions will be documented to ensure they remain the same for a given subject 
at each postural stability assessment timepoint.  They will be instructed to stand as still as possible with eyes 
closed for 1minute.  (revised per Amendment 01) On the morning after the Screening PSG, subjects will 
complete a CDR posture assessment session for familiarization purposes only; no data from this session will be 
used for analyses.  This session must be conducted under the same conditions (eg, starting within 5 minutes of 
morning waketime, at bedside) as during the testing session s at subsequent visits.
Body  sway is detected through the cable around the subject’s waist by the ataxiameter and these data are 
transmitted to a laptop. Body  sway is measured in units of 1/3° of the angle of arc. For ease in reporting these 
will be called arbitrary units, with a higher number indicating more body sway (less postural stability). 
Cognitive Performance Assessment Battery
A computerized PAB will be administered on a laptop computer after the postural stability test.  (revised per 
Amendment 01)  While completing the PAB, subjects will be in bed and am bient lighting will be maintained at 
a level of 80 –100 lux at the subject’s eye level.   On the evening of the Screening PSG visit, before bedtime, 
subjects will be intro duced to the PAB tasks and will undergo a minimum of 2 training sessions. If subjects 
cannot adequately perform  the tasks during the training sessions, they will be excluded from further 
participation.   On the morning after the Screening PSG, subjects willcomplete a session of the cognitive PAB 
for familiarization purposes only; no data from this session will beused for analyses .  This session must be 
conducted under the same conditions (eg, lighting, subject in bed) as during the testing sessions at subsequent 
visits.
The PAB comprises 9tasks including Simple Reaction Time, Choice Reaction Time, Digit Vigilance, 
Immediate Word Recall, Delayed Word Recall, Numerical Working Mem ory, Spatial Working Mem ory, Word 
Recognition, and Picture Recognition.  The full PAB will take approximately 18to 30minutes to complete .  
Four composite domain factor scores are calculated by combining outcome variables from the various tests.  
The four domain factor scores are Power of Attention, Continuity of Attention, Quality of Mem ory, and Speed 
of Memory Retrieval.
Power of Attention
oA composite score from the speed scores of 3 tests of attention
oReflects the ability to focus attention and process information
Continuity of Attention
oA composite score created by combining the accuracy scores from the tests of attention 
oReflects the ability to sustain attention (vigilance)
Quality of Memory

Safety Assessments
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all AEs; regular laboratory evaluation for 
hematology, blood chem istry, and urine values; periodic measurement of vital signs, weight and ECGs; and the 
performance of physical examinations.  Safety will be assessed at every clinic visit throughout the study, and at 
the EOS Visit.
Columbia -Suicidality Severity Rating Scale
Suicidality will be assessed using a self-rated electronic version of the C-SSRS (eC-SSRS) .  The eC-SSRS 
assesses an individual’s degree of suicidality, including both suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. 
Tyrer Benzodiazepine Withdraw al Symptom Questionnaire 
An assessment of withdrawal symptoms will be made using the T-BWSQ completed at the EOS Visit. Subjects 
will be asked about the presence/absence and severity of the symptoms listed in the questionnaire.  For each 
listed symptom, the subject is to respond “No” (Score = 0), “Yes –moderate” (Score = 1) or “Yes –severe” 
(Score = 2).  The sum of r esponses will be the subject’s score. (revised per Amend ment 02)
Other Assessments
EQ-5D-3L
The EQ-5D-3L is a generic instrument that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care, 
and to collect data on quality of life and preference s/utility. The instrument comprises questions on mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression, and a visual analogue scale from 0 (“Worst 
imaginable health state”) to 100 (“Best imaginable health state”).
Patient Global Imp ression –Insomnia 
The PGI-Insomnia is a self-report assessment asking about subjects’ perception sof the effects of the study 
medication on their sleep relative to their sleep before entering in the study.  As such, the PGI-Insomnia does 
not have a baseline and the outcome is not change from baseline, but rather the global impression of the study 
medi cation’s effects at the end of treatment. The PGI-Insomnia has 3 items related to study medication effects 
(a)helped/w orsened sleep, (b)decreased/increased time to fall asleep, (c)increased/decreased total sleep time,
and 1 item related to perceived app ropriateness of study medication strength.  The first 3 items are answered on 
a 3-point scale (1=positive medication effect, 2=neutral medication effect, 3=negative medication effect) and 
the last item on a different 3 -point scale (medication: 1=too strong , 2=just right, 3=too w eak).
Bioanalytical Methods
Plasma concentrations of lemborexant and its metabolites (M4, M9, and M10) and zolpidem (as needed ), will 
be measured using validated liquid chromatography -tandem  mass spectrometry assay methods.
Statistical Methods
All statistical tests will be based on the 5% level of significance ( 2-sided ).

percentages of subjects for each response category (eg, negative [3], neutral [2], positive [1] m edication effect).  
The percentage of positive responses will be compared between treatment groups using the chi-square test, and 
repeated for age subgroups.
The change from baseline in the EQ-5D-3L score at Day 31 will be analyzed using ANCOVA, adjusted for
region , age group and treatment .  (revised per Amendment 03)
No multiplicity adjustment or missing value imputation is planned for explorat ory and pharmocodynamic 
analyses.  (revised per Am endment 03)
Pharm acokinetic Analysis 
The Safety Analysis Set will be used for individual lemborexant and its metabolites M4, M9, and M10, as well 
as zolpidem plasma concentration listings. The PK Analysis Set will be used for summaries of lemborexant and 
its metabolites M4, M9, and M10, as w ell as zolpidem plasma concentrations by dose, time ,and day.
A population PK approach will be used to characterize the PK of lemborexant . For this approach, PK analysis 
data from this study will be pooled with relevant data from Phase 1 and 2 studies, and other Phase 3 studies if 
available. The effect of covariates (ie, demographics) on the PK of lemborexant will be evaluated. The PK 
model will be parameterized for apparent total clearan ce following extravascular admini stration (CL/F) and 
volumes of distribution. Derived exposure parameters such as area under the concentration -time curve (AUC), 
maximum lemborexant plasma concentration (Cmax) and any other relevant param eters will be calculated from 
the model using the in dividual posterior estimate of CL/F and dosing history. 
Pharm acodynamic Analysis
These analyses are described in the Secondary Efficacy Analyses, and Exploratory and Pharm acody namic 
Analyses sections (above).

treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs ), will be explored graphically.  Any emergent PK/PD relationships 
will be evaluated by population PK/PD modeling. The population PK/PD analysis plan will be described and 
results will be reported in a separate document. 
Population PK and PK/PD analyses wi ll be performed using NONMEM version 7.2 or later.
Safety Analyses
Evaluations of safety will be performed on the relevant Safety Analysis Set.  The incidence of AEs, out-of-
norm al-range laboratory safety test variables, abnormal ECG findings, out-of-range vital signs and weight , 
suicidality (eC -SSRS), and T -BWSQ (including frequency and percentage of subjects with T -BWSQ score ≥3), 
along with change from baseline in laboratory safety test variables, ECGs, and vital sign and weight 
measurements, will be summarized by treatment grou p using descriptive statistics.
Other Analyses
Secondary and exploratory endpoints may be additionally presented graphically or analyzed by modeling 
methods if warranted.
Although ZOL is included in the study as an active comparator, comparison of ZOL to PBO, and comparison 
betw een LEM10 and LEM5 may be made to facilitate evaluation of study results.
Interim Analyses
An interim analysis is planned to be conducted after approximately 50% of subjects (approximately 
n=475 subjects) have been randomized and either completed Day 31 assessments or discontinued from the 
study.  This interim analysis will be conducted for administrative reasons as detailed in the separate Interim 
Analysis charter.  When the specified number of subjects has completed the Day 31 assessments, an 
independent statistician external to the Sponsor will be provided with the relevant PSG dataset and will be 
unblinded to the primary endpoint, ie, change from baseline in WASO2H for the mean of Days 29 and 30.  A 
conditional power will be calculated to predict the probability that the trial will achieve a significant treatment 
effect for WASO2H in the LEM10 versus ZOL arms at the end of the study, given what is observed at the tim e 
of interim analysis. The interim analysis will be limited to the comparison of LEM10 versus ZOL on the 
change from baseline in WASO2H for the mean of Days 29 and 30.  No other endpoints, dose groups, or 
timepoints will be analyzed at the interim analysis. The study will not be terminated for either futility or 
efficacy.  Therefore no impact to the type I error rate is expected.  
The method of calculating the conditional power will be detailed in the Interim Analysis charter, along with 
operational procedures, unblinding procedures, procedures for communicating the results of the conditional 
power calculation and recipients of this information.  To preclude potential influence on the conduct of the 
remainder of the study, disclosure of the conditional power will be limited to a presp ecified set of executive -
level individuals at the sponsor and sponsor's co-development partner . No individuals involved with the 
conduct of the study will have access to the interim data or the results of the interim  analysis (i.e., the 
conditional power of LEM10 versus ZOL on the change from baseline in WASO2H for the mean of Days 29 
and 30).
Enrollment of subjects will not be stopped during the interval during which the interim analysis is conducted.  
The interim analysis may be waived or otherwise not conducted, for reasons including but not limited to a 
higher than anticipated enrollment rate which would make the interim analysis unnecessary as the majority of 
subjects w ould have been enrolled by the time the interim analysis was concluded.   
Sample Si ze Rationale
The sam ple size was estimated for each comparison of LEM10 vs. PBO, and LEM5 vs PBO with respect to the 
mean change from baseline of LPS at Month 1, on the basis of a 2-sided t-test at the 0.05 α-level for each 
treatment comparison .  (revised per Amendment 03)
On the basis of the dose finding study E2006 -G000 -201(Study 201), across various lemborexant doses (1to 
25mg) at Days 14 and 15, the standard deviation (SD)of change from baseline for log-transformed LPS is 
assumed to be 0.9. The LS m ean treatment difference at Days 14/15 from Study 201 for log-transformed LPS of 
LEM10 and LEM5 compared with PBO was 0.75 and -1.15, respectively .  Therefore, a sample size of 250 
subjects for LEM5, 250 subjects for LEM10, and 200 subjects for PBO has at least 95% power for each 
treatment comparison, LEM10 with PBO, and LEM5 with PBO ,based on 2-sided, 2-sample t-test at 5% 
significa nce level .(revised per Amendment 03)
Power is also estimated for the key secondary objective s, the comparison of LEM10 andLEM5 to PBO on

5.1 Institutional Review Boards/Independent Ethics Committees
The protocol, informed consent form (ICF), and appropriate related documents must be 
reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) constituted and functioning in accordance with International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH)E6 (Good Clinical Practice ; GCP ), Section 3, and any local regu lations.   
Any protocol amendment or revision to the ICF will be resubmitted to the IRB/IEC for 
review and approval, except for changes involving only  logistical or admini strative aspects of 
the study  (eg, change in clinical research associates [CRA s], change of telephone number[s]).  
Documentation of IRB/IEC compliance with the ICH E6 and any local regulations regarding 
constitution and review conduct will be provided to t he sponsor.
A signed letter of study  approval from the IRB/IEC chairman must be sent to the principal 
investigator (PI) (or if regionall y required, the head of the medical institution) with a copy  to 
the sponsor before study start and the release of any study drug to the site by the sponsor or 
its designee (ICH E6, Section 4.4).  I f the IRB/ IEC decides to suspend or terminate the study , 
the investigator (or if regionall y required, the head of the medical institution) will 
immediately  send the notice of study  suspension or termination by the IRB/IEC to the 
sponsor.
Study  progress is to be reported to IRB/IECs annually  (or as required) by the investigator or 
sponsor, depending on local reg ulatory  obligations.  If the investigator is required to report to 
the IRB/IEC, he/she will forward a copy to the sponsor at the time of each periodic report.  
The investigator (s) or the sponsor will submit, depending on local regulations, periodic 
reports and inform the IRB/IEC (or if regionally required, the investigator and the relevant 
IRB via the head of the medical institution) of any reportable adverse events (AEs) per ICH 
guidelines and local IRB/IEC standards of practice.  Upon completion of the study, the 
investigator will provide the IRB/IEC with a brief report of the outcome of the study , if

7.1 Indication 
7.1.1 Current Therapeutic Options 
Insomnia is a sleep disorder characterized by  difficulties with sleep onset, sleep maintenance, 
or early morning awakening, in association with a complaint of impairment during the 
daytime.  Insomnia is a widespread problem in industrialized nations, with approximatel y 
30% of the population having symptoms and at least 6% meeting diagnostic criteria for 
insomnia meriting treatment .  Currentl y available pharmacological treatments used for 
insomnia include benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepine γ-aminobuty ric acid (GABA)
receptor agonists (GABAergics), a recentl y approved dual orexin receptor antagonist 
(DORA), sedating antidepressants, melatonin and melatonin agonists, antihistamines, and 
other prescription and non -prescription medications with sedative properties .  
The current commercial environment is generic, with the non-benzodiazepine ,zolpidem 
(Ambien®),leading in prescriptions in the US. Other so-called “z-drugs” including zaleplon 
and eszopiclone, contribute substantially  to market share as well.   However, there are 
efficacy  and safety  concerns associated with the use of z-drugs, particularly  zolpidem, 
particularl yinolder patie nts.  This limite defficac yis characteristic ofshort -acting non-
benzodiazepine hypnotic sandreprese ntsan importan t unmet medical need, as sleep 
maintenance insomnia is the most prevalent type of insomnia experienced in aging. Up to 
50% of individuals over age 55 report difficulty maintaining sleep.   The recentl y approved 
DORA, suvorexant, was show nin clinical trials to significantly  improve sleep maintenance 
insomnia, but at the starting dose approved for use, showed suboptimal efficacy .
7.1.2 Lemborexant (E2006)
7.1.2.1 Mechanism of Action
Lemborexant, E2006, (1R,2S)-2-{[(2,4 -dimethy lpyrimidin -5-yl)oxy]methy l}-2-(3-
fluorophen yl)-N-(5-fluoropy ridin -2-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamide belongs to the 
pharmacologic class of orexin receptor antagonists .
Orexin neuropeptides (orexin -A and orexin -B) have been recognized as critica l upstream 
controllers of most wake -promoting neurotransmitters via twoGprotein -coupled receptors, 
the orexin -1 receptor and the orexin -2 receptor .  Small-molecule antagonists of orexin 
receptors ,such as suvorexant, have recently  emerged as a new class of chemical compounds 
that represents a novel alternative approach to treat insomnia disorder. 
7.1.2.2 Clinical Experience with Lemborexant
7.1.2.2.1 PHASE 1
E2006 -A001 -001 (Study 001):  single ascending dose study .  This study included healthy 
subjects and otherwise healt hy subjects with primary  insomnia.  In addition to determining 
Clinical Study Protocol
Per Amendment 04E2006 -G000 -304
Eisai
FINAL : (v7.0), 05Feb2018ConfidentialPage 33of 109the safet y and tolerability  of single doses, the study  provided preliminary  evidence of 
efficacy  in the target patient population.
E2006 -A001 -002 (Study 002):  multiple ascending dose study .  This study  enrolled healthy 
adult and elderl y subjects, each of whom was dosed with lemborexant or placebo at night.  In 
addition to determining the safet y and tolerability of multiple doses, the study  also provided 
preliminary  evidence of a lack of importa nt differences in exposure between adult and 
elderl y subjects.  
E2006 -A001 -003 (Study 003):  A multiple dose study  to bridge pharmacokinetics (PK) , 
pharmacod ynamics (PD), safet y and tolerability  between Japanese and white healthy 
subjects .  This study  provided evidence of a lack of important differences in exposure and 
safet y between Japanese and white subjects.
E2006 -A001 -004 (Study  004):  metabolism -based inducer/inhibitor study .  This study  
provided data demonstrating (1) strong inhibitors of CYP3A lead to higher plasma 
concentrations of lemborexant ; and (2) strong inducers of CYP3A lead to notably  lower 
plasma concentrations of lemborexant . The study  also demonstrated a weak effect of 
lemborexant on CYP2B6 activity  and no effect on CYP3A activity .
E2006 -A001 -005 (Study  005):  relative bioavailability  study of capsules vs tablet 
formulations.  This study  demonstrated that the capsules and tablets provided similar 
exposure (maximum observed concentration [Cmax]and area under the concentration -time 
curve [ AUC]), thus allowing the tablet formulation to be used in future clinical trials.
E2006 -A001 -007 (Study 007):  human mass balance absorption, distribution, metabolism, 
and excretion study  to characterize the route and extent of excretion of lemborexant . This 
study  demonstrated that elimination takes place by fecal (57%) and urinary  excretion (29%) 
based on total recovery (86.5%) of radioactivity  following a single dose of radiolabeled 
lemborexant . In addition, there were no human -specific metabolites and the only major 
(12%) metabolite was M10.   The blood -to-plasma ratio was approximately  0.65.
E2006 -A001 -008 (Study 008):  food effect study .  This study  demonstrated a mild food 
effect.  The Cmax was decreased by  23% and the area under the concentration -time curve from 
zero time extrapolated to infinite time (AUC [0-inf])was increased by 18% following 
consumption of a high fat meal .
E2006 -A001 -107 (Study 107):  This Phase 1 study  was conducted to evaluate the effects of 
the 5 and 10 mg doses on next-morning residual sleepiness in subjects with insomnia 
disorder.  The study  design was randomized, double -blind, and placebo (PBO) -controlled
with a 3-way crossover.  Next-morning residual sleepiness was measured on a modified 
multi ple sleep onset latency  test (M-MSLT).  An active comparator, flurazepam 30 mg, was 
included to confirm assay sensitivity .  Results showed that for neither 5 mg nor 10 mg was 
the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the treatment difference in change 
from baseline of average sleep onset latency  on the M-MSL T more than -6 minutes, which 
was the prespecified criterion defining clinically  meaningful next-morning residual 
sleepiness.  That is, neither dose level of E2006 resulted in a clinically  meaningful reduction

their use in Phase 3 studies.
7.1.2.2.2 PHASE 2
A dose-finding study  (E2006 -G000 -201; Study 201) was conducted in subjects who had
insomnia disorder, with the primary  objectives of identify ing doses that resulted in efficacy 
but did not result in significant next-day residual sleepiness. The doses evaluated were 1, 
2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 25 mg, administered once daily for 15days.Thestudy  was stopped early 
for efficacy  after the prespecified success criterion for sleep efficiency  (SE) was achieved 
without unacceptable next-day residual sleepiness as evaluated by the Karolinska Sleepiness 
Scale (KSS) .
As measured by polysomnography  (PSG), improvements in sleep were also demonstrated by 
statistically  significant increases from baseline in SE, and by decreases from baseline in 
mean latency  to persistent sleep (LPS) and wake after sleep onset (WASO) .  These changes 
were largel y maintain ed over 15days of treatment with lemborexant as compared with 
placebo.  Subjective measures derived from sleep diary  entries yielded results largel y 
comparable to PSG-derived results .  Further, there was no evidence of rebound insomnia 
after treatment was completed, as measured either by  PSG or Sleep Diary .
At doses up to 10mg, changes from baseline in next-day sleepiness, as measured by the 
KSS,did not differ from those after placebo.  At the highe st doses of 15and 25 mg, the 
increase in KSS from baseline was statistically  significantly  different from placebo at some
time points , but the increases in KSS were of small magnitude (ie, less than 1 unit on 
average) .  Although there was approximately  a two-fold accumulation of lemborexant in 
plasma over the 15-day Treatment Period , next-day sleepiness did not increase from the 
beginning to the end of treatment .
Overall, data from the clinical program to date have shown an acceptable safet y and 
tolerability  profile of lemborexant, and efficacy  on both objective and subjective measures of 
sleep onset and sleep maintenance.
7.2 Stud y Rationale
The purpose of this study  is to provide important information to begin to improve on the 
current treatment paradigm for older patients with sleep maintenance insomnia.  The study  
will help establish the efficacy  of lemborexant for the treatment of sleep onset and sleep 
maintenance difficulties, by comparing change from baseline in these parameters to placebo.  
With respect to comparisons to existing therapies, the current market leader, zolpidem has 
been shown to improve sleep onset insomnia. The immediate release (IR) formulation of 
zolpidem is not, however, indicated for sleep -maintenance insomnia.  The extended release 
formu lation, zolpidem tartrate extended release 6.25 mg (Ambien CR®; ZOL ),was approved 
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA )for the treatment of sleep maintenance 
symptoms as well as for sleep onset difficulties. However, 2studies, one using 12.5 mg in 
adults and the other study ing 6.25 mg in elderly  patients, reported that effects on WASO 
after nights 1and 2 of treatment were only statistically  significantl y different from placebo

FINAL : (v7.0), 05Feb2018ConfidentialPage 35of 109for the first 6 hours (adults) or first 5 hours (elderly ) of the 8-hour sleep period.  After 2 
weeks of treatment, WASO was significantly  decreased for only  the first 5 hours (adults) and 
first 4 hours (elderly ) of the 8-hour sleep period.  Given that this is the time of night when 
most sleep maintenance difficulties are experienced, particularl y by elderly  individuals, there 
is an unmet need that has not been effectively  addressed with ZOL .  In brief, while ZOL 
improves sleep maintenance more than the IRformulation ,it does not sufficientl y decrease 
WASO in the second half of the night (WASO2H) . Nonetheless, ZOL was approved based 
on data for the first 6 hours of the sleep period.  It should be no ted that the pivotal studies for 
ZOL were based on data from 3-week trials analyzed for Nights 1/2 and 15/16.   A 
comparison of lemborexant with ZOL, especiall y with respect to sleep maintenance, would 
provide clinically  meaningful information for clinician s and patie nts.  (revised per

9.1 Overall Study  Design and Plan
E2006 -G000 -304 is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, active 
comparator (ie, ZOL), parallel -group study  of 2 dose level s of lemborexant for 30 nights in 
approximately  950 subjects 55 years or older withinsomnia disorder.   Subjects will be m ales
65 years or older or females 55 years or older.  Approximately  60% of the population will be 
age 65 years or older.   (revised per Amendment 03)
The study  will have 2 phases, the Prerandomization Phase and the Randomization Phase. The 
Prerandomization Phase will comprise 3 periods that will last up to a maximum of 35days: a 
Screening Period, a Run-in Period, and a Baseline Period. The Randomization Phase will 
comprise a Treatment Period during which subjects are treated for 30 nights followed by a 
minimum 14 -day interval before an End of Stud y(EOS) Visit.  (revised per Amendment 02)
Throughout the Prerandomization Phase and the Randomization Phase , all subjects will 
undergo routine safety  assessments at specified visits , including questioning regarding AEs, 
12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs ), vital signs, weight, height, clinical hematology  and 
chemistry  analysis and urinaly sis, and s uicidalit y.  
Estimates for End of study are as follows: 
oThe study  will begin in approximately  Apr 2016
oThe end of the study  will be the date of the last study  visit for the last subject in the 
study .
oThe estimated duration for each subject on study is anticipated to be a maximum of 
81 days / 11.5 weeks (Screening Period plus Run-in Period plus Baseline Period 
maximum of 35days plus Treatment Period plus Follow -up Period and EOS Visit
maximum of 53 days).  A subject who completes the Treatment Period (assessments 
throu gh discharge from clinic on the morning of Day 31) will be considered to have 
completed the study .(revised per Amendment 02)

9.1.1.1 Screening Period
TheScreening Period will begin no more than 35 days before the subject is randomized.  At 
the first screening visit (Visit 1), informed consent will be obtained after the study  has been 
fully explained to each subject and before the conduct of any screening procedures or 
assessments.  A medical, psychiatric, and sleep history  interview will be conducted, and will 
include confirmation that the subject meets diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder, and 
further that the subject complains of difficulties with sleep maintenance or early morning 
awake ning, or both. Screening assessments will include the ISI, as well as the Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the STOPBang, the Internationa l Restless Legs Scale (IRLS), and 
the Munich Parasomnia Scale (MUPS), collectively  called the Sleep Disorders Screening
Battery  (SDSB). Additional eligibility  criteria will be assessed andsafety assessments will
be conducted as described in Section 9.5.1.5 and summarized in Table 4.(revised per 
Amendment 02)
Subjects will be provided with an electronic device on which they will complete the Sleep 
Diary  and will be trained in the use of this device.  Site staff will instruct subjects to 
complete the diary  each morning within 1 hour after morning waketime and will emphasize 
the importance of doing so.  The Sleep Diary  entries will be reviewed by site staff at least 
weekl y throughout the study  to ensure subject compliance with completion of the Sleep 
Diary  and to ensure that study  restrictions are met pertaining to duration of time spent in bed, 
and use of alcohol.  
After subjects have completed the Sleep Diary  on at least 7 consecutive mornings , and 
provided that the Sleep Diary  entries indicate continued eligibility with regard to sleep 
timing, duration of time spent in bed, and frequency  of nights with symptoms of insomnia , 
subjects will undergo the second screening visit.  (Subjects who are not eligible on the basis 
of Sleep Diary  entries will return to the clinic for debriefing purposes and to return study  
equipment.) This visit must occur between Day -17 and Day -10.  On this and all nights on 
which PSG is to be recorded, subjects will arrive at the clinic in the even ing with sufficient 
time before bedtime to complete check -in procedures, any scheduled assessments, and 
preparations (eg, electrode montage placement) for the PSG recordings.   In addition, at 
check -in before all visits at which PSG is to be recorded, subjects will undergo a urine drug 
test.  (revised per Amendment 02)
After check -in has been completed, study  personnel will familiarize subjects with the 
postural stability  assessment (CDR posture assessment ) and will also conduct a minimum of 
2training sessions for the cognitive performance assessment battery  (PAB).  Subjects will 
then undergo an 8-hour PSG recording, to start at the median habitual bedtime (MHB) as 
calculated from the Sleep Diary  entries.  The PSG recording will include channels in the 
electrode montage to screen for symptoms of sleep apnea and periodic limb movement 
disorder .  Within 5 minutes of morning waketime, the CDR posture and PAB assessments 
will be administered under the same conditions (eg, timing of assessments relative to 
waketime, ambient lighting), as will be employed during the testing sessions.  The CDR

after waketime, subjects will rate their morning sleepiness level.  The PSG will be reviewed 
for exclusion criteria related to absence of symptoms of sleep apnea and/or periodic limb 
movement disorder , subjects who continue to meet the eligibility  criteria will then be 
dispensed PBO tablets (single -blind) and will enter the Run -in Period.
9.1.1.2 Run-in Period
The Run-in Period will begin when eligible subjects are dispensed PBO tablets and will
continue until the Baseline Period on Day 1.  During the Run-in Period, subjects will take 
PBO each night immediately  (ie, within 5 minutes) before bedtime (defined as the time the 
subject intends to try to fall asleep).  They will be reminded that they must remain in bed for 
at least 7 hours each night and maintain a regular bedtime throughout the study according to 
the schedule determined by the study  site and the subject . They  will also be reminded that 
they must follow study  restrictions with regard to timing of meals and use of caffeine and 
alcohol.   
When subjects have completed the Sleep Diary  on at least 7 consecutive mornings during the 
Run-In Period , the diary  will be reviewed for continued eligibility  with regard to whether the 
subject continues to report sWASO ≥60 minutes on at least 3of the 7nights , as well as the 
schedule and duration of time spentin bed. Subjects who are still eligible will return to the 
clinic for the first of two consecutive nights on which PSG will be recorded. (Subjects who 
are not eligible on the basis of Sleep Diary  entries will return to the clinic for debriefing 
purposes and to return study  equipment.)   The first of these 2nights must be between Day -
10 and Day -4. In the evening before the PSG recording, t he IS I, the FSS, and the EQ-5D-3L 
will be assessed.  The I SI score will be reviewed for eligibility  and safet y assessments will be 
conducted.  Study  personnel will administer study  drugto subjects within 5minutes before 
theirscheduled bedtime, which will be at the same MHB as used for the secon d screening 
visit.  Subject swill then undergo an8-hour PSG.  The next morning, subjects will undergo 
assessment sincluding the CDR posture and PAB assessments and will complete the Sleep 
Diary .  At 1.5 hours after waketime, subjects will rate their morni ng sleepiness level.  The 
PSG recording will be reviewed for continued eligibility  and subjects may then leave the 
clinic only after the investigator determines that is safe for them to do so.  (revised per 
Amendment 02)
Subjects will return to the clinic that evening .Study  personnel will administer study  drug to
subjects within 5 minutes before the scheduled bedtime .  A PSG will be recorded overnight .  
The following morning subjects will undergo postural stability  and PAB assessments and 
will complete the Sleep Diary .  At 1.5 hours after waketime, subjects will rate their morning 
sleepiness level.  The PSG recording will be reviewed for continued eligibility , and both 
PSGs during the Run-in Period will also serve as the baseline for PSG-derived endpoints for 
subjects who are randomized.   Subjects may then leave the clinic only after the investigator 
determines that is safe for them to do so.

the subject discontinues from the study  due to an AE, the subject must complete an ETVisit 
and the AE must be followed to resolution or for 2weeks, whichever comes first.  In 
addition, subjects who withdraw due to an AE should undergo a urine drug t est.
9.2 Discussion of Study  Design, Including Choice of Control Groups
9.2.1 Randomization
Randomization will be used in this study  to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to 
treatment, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (eg, 
demographics and baseline characteristics) are balanced across treatment groups, and to 
ensure the validit y of statistical comparisons across treatment groups.  Blinding to treatment 
will be used to reduce potential bias during data collection and evaluatio n of endpoints.
9.2.2 Run-In 
Insomnia trials are associated with large placebo effects.  This study  will include a placebo 
Run-in Period to exclude subjects who show a response to placebo. (revised per 
Amendment 03)
The Run-in Period will also help to identify  and exclude subjects who are not compliant with 
the Sleep Diary  instructions, duration of time spentin bed,or restrictions on alcohol use.  In 
this regard, it is necessary  for the subjects to be taking PBO andto obtain Sleep Diary  data 
for a minimum of 1 week to adequatel y evaluate whether there is a PBO response and

treatment, eligible subjects will have PSG recordings on 2 consecutive nights.  These 
recordings will be used to further screen for eligibility , and will serve as baseline values for 
those subjects who continue to randomization.
9.2.3 Efficacy Assessments
The study  uses objective (PSG) as well as subjective (Sleep Diary) assessments of efficacy .  
Both assessments have been widel y used in registration trials evaluating treatments for 
insomnia disorder.  While PSG indicates that a measurable physiological effect ofthe study 
drug has occurred, Sleep Diary outcomes indic ate the magnitude of the effect for the patient.  
(revised per Amendment 03)
Another focus of this study  is on WASO2H, a measure of sleep maintenance in the second 
half of the night.  The rationale for the selection of this endpoint is based on the loss of effect 
of ZOL on sleep maintenance at the end of the sleep period.  However, any benefit on 
WASO2H observed with lemborexant must not be due to a worsening of sleep latency  or 
continuity  at the beginning of the night.  Therefore, analy ses of both LPS and total WASO as 
well as other PSG variables (eg, total sleep time [TST], number and duration of awakenings) 
will be conducted to confirm the efficacy  of lemborexant on sleep onset and sleep 
maintenance.   (revised per Amendment 03)
9.2.4 Morning Residual Effects on Postural Stability and Cognitive Performance 
Non-benzodiazepine sleep -inducing agents such as zolpidem have been associated with 
motor and cognitive impairment, and laboratory studies have evaluated these impairments 
both during the middle of the night several hours postdose, and in the morning hours shortl y 
after awakening.  Of clinical importance is that the elderl y are particularly  sensitive to effects 
of zolpidem on postural stability , which is especially  problematic given the increased risk of 
falls in the elderl y.  
Moderate to large treatment effects versus placebo on measures of postural stability and 
cognitive performance have been reported for both 5 mg and 10 mg doses of the IR 
formulation of zolpidem (Allain, et al., 2003 , Mets ,et al.,2010 ,and Boyle,et al.,2009 ; 
reviewed in Stranks and Crowe ,2014 ).  Larger impairments are observed near the C maxof the 
zolpidem IR formulation at approximately  1.5 hours postdose than at late r timepoints relative 
to dosing, but there remains a moderate impairing effect of zolpidem even the next morning 
on certain cognitive domains including attention and memory  (Stranks and Crowe ,2014 ).  
With regard to postural stability  as measured in this study , zolpidem is assumed to have the 
same effect on body  sway as alcohol at 4.5 hours after dosing (Wesnes, et al., 2000 ).  
Further, there is consistent evidence that the effects on postural stability of hypnotic drugs 
are larger after the first one or two nights of dosing and dissipate thereafter, which has been 
explained as due tobehaviora ltoleranc e(Mets ,etal.,2010 ).For this reason, thekey 
secondary  objective for the current study  is to compare the effects of lemborexant to those of 
zolpidem onpostural stability  at the beginning of treatment, in the morning shortly  after 
waketime on Day 2 and Day 3.  Whether there are differential effects of lemborexant and

Effects on cognitive performance in the morning shortly  after waketime will be exploratory 
for both the beginning and end of treatment.
9.2.5 Adjudication Committee (revised per Amendment 02)
An independent Adjudication Committee will be employ ed at intervals to review, in a 
blinded manner, AEs that could potentially  be considered cataplex yor seizure .  A set of 
preferred terms constituting a customized Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA) query  for cataplex y or seizure will be used to identify  events for adjudication 
(including cataplex y, muscle fatigue, muscular weakness, muscle tone disorder, hypotonia, 
drop attacks, slurred speech, diplopia, falls, convulsions, atypical migraine, loss of 
consciousness, decreased consciousness, myoclonus, syncope, transient global amnesia, 
lipothy mia and transient ischemic attack ).  To assist in the preparation of narratives about 
such events and to support the committee’s adjudication process, investigators and site staff 
will be instructed to query subjects who report any of the above events for supplemental 
information about events of cataplex y or potential cataplexy  events, using a questionnaire for 
events potential related to cataplex y and the SAE form for any of the above events 
considered serio us.(revised per Amendment 02)
9.2.6 Study Duration
The registration trials for zolpidem were 3 weeks in duration, with analy ses of PSG efficacy  
data conducted after the first 2 doses and at the end of 2 weeks of active treatment.  As noted, 
treatment benefit of zolpidem declined over time such that WASO 2H,particularly  in the last 
2 hours of the night, was not different from placebo on Nights 15/16 in the zolpidem 
registration trials.  In contrast, when lemborexant was studied for 15 nights of treatment in 
Study 201, the treatment benefit was maintained such that there was no significant difference 
in LPS, WASO, or WASO2H between the first 2 and last 2 nights of treatment.  Study 304 
includes 30 days of active treatment.  Based on the results of Study  201, it isexpected that 
there will not be a loss of efficacy  of lemborexant between 2 weeks and 4 weeks of 
treatment. 
Moreover, as the beneficial effects of zolpidem on WASO2H did not persist for 2 weeks, it is 
not expected that there will be statistically  or clinically  significant effects of ZOL at the end 
of the 30 day s of treatment.
9.2.7 Age Group
While the lower age is not the typical 65years defining “elderl y,” it is physiologicall y 
meaningful, as insomnia incidence increases at middle age in both men and women, with a 
particularl y steep increase in incidence in women at menopause.   In addition, the 
homeostatic and circadian regulation of sleep are disturbed in many  older individuals, which 
manifests most frequently as sleep maintenance insomnia in the second halfof the night, and 
early morning awakening.  The preponderance of sleep maintenance issues in the second half 
of the sleep period is clear from the literature as well as supported by analyses of data by  age 
group from Study  201.   (revised per Amendment 03)

FINAL :  (v7.0), 05Feb2018Confidential Page 46of 109When Study  201 data were analyzed separately  for those aged 55 years and older, the 
apparent treatment effect of lemborexant versus placebo on WASO2H, as well as on WASO, 
was larger than for the full sample (all ages studied), suggesting that older indivi duals may  be 
most likely  to benefit from a treatment that reduced difficulties with both sleep onset and 
sleep maintenance.  Table 1shows the least square (LS) mean treatment difference between 
lemborexant and PBO for various dose groups and dose group combinations from Study  201 
for the full sample and for those aged 55 and older.  Caution must be exercised concerning 
the predictive ability  of these data, however, since the observed variability  in WASO2H was 
larger in the older subjects.  For this reason, a conservative estimate of the expected 
treatment difference between lemborexant and PBO for WASO2H at the end of treatment 
was used for power analy ses and sample size justification.  Enrollment in this study  is 
exclusively  older subjects, aged 55 y ears and older.  (revised per Amendment 03)

At Baseline, subjects will be randomized, in a double -blind manner, to receive LEM5, 
LEM10, ZOL, or PBO in a 5:5:5:4 ratio. Randomization will be stratified by country  and by  
age group (55to 64 years; 65 years or older).  Randomization to study  treatments will be 
based on a computer -generated randomization scheme that will be reviewed and approved by 
an independent statistici an.  The randomization scheme and identification for each subject 
will be included in the final clinical study  report for this study .
Randomization will be performed centrall y by an interactive voice and web response system 
(IxRS).  The IxRS or clinical supply vendor will generate the randomized blister card 
identification numbers.  At enrollment (and after successful completion of study  procedures 
the morning of Day 1), the investigator or designee will call the IxRS to register the subject 
information.  At Randomization (morning of Day 1), the IxRS will assign each subject a 
unique 6 -digit randomization number .
9.4.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
In Study 201, all doses studied met the first primary objective of balancing significant efficac y 
as measured by change from baseline in SE with sufficient safety  measured by subjective 
sleepiness reported on the KSS.  The second primary  objective was also achieved, as there 
were no significant increases in the KSS at 1 hour after waketime at the end of treatment.  
However, there were dose-related increases in the KSS at both the beginning and end of 
treatment, and the rate of AEs of somnolence also increased with increasing dose level.  
In Study  201,lemborexant 5 mg and 10 mg showed significant efficacy  measured by SE, as 
well as decreases in sleep onset latency .  These effects were maintained across the 15-day 
Treatment Period .  For sleep maintenance, lemborexant 10 mg showed significant decreases, 
and while the magnitude of decreases in WASO was less for 5 mg, there was a significant 
proportion of subjects whose WASO decreased substantiall y, providing evidence for clinical 
benefit of 5 mg on sleep maintenance as well.  
Because of the observed dose -related increases in subjective sleepiness and AEs of somnolence 
in Study  201, Study  107 was conducted to obtain additional information about the risk of 
clinicall y meaningful morning residual sleepiness.  The study  assessed average sleep onset 
latency  on the M-MSLT after a single dose of LEM5 or LEM10 versus PBO .  The results 
indicated that the pre-specified threshold for a clinicall y meaningful decrease in average sleep 
onset latency  was not met by either the 5 mg or 10 mg dose level of lemborexant, supporting 
their use in the Phase 3 clinical trials.  Taken together with the efficacy  and safety results for 
lemborexant 5 mg and 10 mg in the Phase 2 study , these dose levels were selected for the 
current study .

9.4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Throughout the Run-in Period and the Treatment Period, study  drug will be taken 
immediately  before the subject intends to sleep.  When the subject is to sleep in the clinic for 
PSG, study  personnel will administer study  drug.  On other nights, the subject will take study  
drug at home on as consistently  a time schedule as possible . Subjects should not eat a meal 
within 3 hours before taking the stud y drug. 
9.4.6 Blinding
During the Run-in Period of the Prerandomization Phase, single blinding will be in effect 
such that the subject will be blinded to study  treatment but study  personnel will not be 
blinded.  During the Randomization Phase, subjects and all personnel involved with the 
conduct and interpretation of the study, including investigators, site personnel, and sponsor 
staff will be blinded to the treatment codes.  Randomization data will be kept strictly  
confidential, filed securely  by an appropriate group with the sponsor or CRO and accessible 
only to authorized p ersons (eg, Eisai Global Safet y) until the time of unblinding, per standard 
operating procedure .
A master list of all treatments and the subject numbers associated with them will be 
maintained in a sealed envelope by the clinical supply  vendor, the IxRS vendor, and the 
sponsor.  In the event that emergency  conditions require knowledge of the study  treatment 
given, the blind may be broken via the code breaker facility  within the IxRS.  Emergenc y 
procedures for revealing drug codes are given in Section 9.5.4.5 .  If possible, before breaking 
the blind, the investigator should consult with the sponsor to ascertain the necessity  of 
breaking the code.
Disclosure of information from the interim anal ysis (Section 9.7.3 ) will be limited as detailed 
in the Interim Anal ysis charter . No individuals involved with the conduct of the study  will 
have access to this information.

maximum of 2 alcoholic drinks on anyday during the study , and will be advised not to 
consume any alcohol within 3 h ours before bedtime. They  must not consume alcohol on any  
days when they are scheduled for a PSG recording.  Compliance with these restrictions will 
be monitored via questions on the Sleep Diary.  If subjects cannot compl y after an infraction 
and counseli ng, they  may be discharged from the study .
Prohibited medications include strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors and all CYP3A 
inducers.  Prohibited therapies also include any treatment for insomnia disorder, including 
any drugs or non-pharmacological treatm ent such as cognitive behavioral therapy ; 
medications that are used for the purpose of inducing sleep (hypnotics) or inducing 
wakefulness (stimulants; except caffeine; see above) and medications that have known 
sedating effects or alerting effects. Thisprohibition applies even if the entire class to which 
that medication belongs is not prohibited (eg, anticonvulsants).  
A subject must discontinue any prohibited medication (Appendix 3) at least 1 week (or at 
least 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) before starting the Sleep Diary , ie, at least 2weeks 
before the start of the Run -In Period.  
Prohibited therapies include treatments for insomnia disorder (drugs or non-pharmacological 
treatment such as cognitive behavioral therapy ) and any medication which, in the opinion of 
the investigator, causes or exacerbates the subject’s insomnia.  (revised per Amendment 01)
If a medication is not on the list of prohibited medications but in the opinion of the 
investigator causes or exacerbates the subject’s insomnia, it must not be used throughout the 
study .  If a medication is not specified as prohibited but is in the same class as a medication 
that is listed in Appendix 3,and if the investigator is uncertain whether the medication has 
known sedating or alerting effects, the Medical Monitor must be consulted.
If a subject starts any prohibited medication or therap y during the study , he/she must 
discontinue from the study , with the exception that certain prohibited medications may be 
used for a short duration (not to exceed 2weeks) to treat an acute condition if this is agreed 
with the Medical Monitor.  Note that strong CYP3A inhibitors will not be permitted at any 
time for an y duration of use during the study.   (revised per Amendment 01)
Any medication (including over-the-counter medications) or therap y administered to the 
subject within the last 3 months before Screening (ie, Prior Medications) or during the study ,
starting onthe date of informed consent ,will be recorded on the Prior and Concomitant 
Medication eCRF or Non-Pharmacological Procedures eCRF .  The investigator will record 
on the Adverse Event eCRF any AE for which the concomitant medication/therapy  was 
administered.  If the concomitant medication/therap y is being administered for a medical 
condition present at the time of entry  into the study , the investigator will record the medical 
condition on the Medical History  and Current Medical Condition seCRF.

tablet count . Tablets will be counted separatel y for tablets that are matched to lemborexant 
and tablets that are matched to zolpidem. 
When subjects arrive for the first screening/baseline PSG during the Run-in Period, and the 
treatment compliance check indicates that a subject has missed any doses, the subject will be 
counseled by site personnel. If the subject has missed more than 1 dose, and given that the 
subject continues to meet eligibility  criteria, the investigator must consult with the sponsor 
prior to the subject being randomized and come to a collaborative decision on whether the 
subjec t should continue in the study .  When subjects arrive for Baseline, and the treatment 
compliance check indicates that a subject has missed any doses, the investigator must use 
clinical judgment to decide if the subject should continue in the study .
Records of treatment compliance for each subject will be kept during the study . Clinical 
research associates will review treatment compliance during site visits and at the complet ion 
of the study .

9.5.1.3 Efficacy Assessments
9.5.1.3.1 POLYSOMNOGRAPHY
Each PSG recording will include an electrode montage with electroencephalography  (EEG), 
electrom yograph y (EMG), electrooculograph y, and ECG channels, for scoring of sleep 
parameters and sleep architecture via standard sleep scoring criteria.  In addition, the 
screening PSG will include channels for assessment of sy mptoms of sleep apnea and periodic 
limb movement disorder .
Trained PSG scorers will score PSG records in 30-second epochs according to standard 
criteria.   The PSGat the second screening visit will be used only to calculate the Apnea -
Hypopnea Index and the Periodic Limb Movements with Arousal Index for evaluation of 
eligibility  criteria; sleep parameters and sleep architecture will not be evaluated from this 
PSG.  The 2 PSGs obtained during the Run-in Period will be used to a) determine eligibility 
and b) derive baseline PSG parameters for those subjects who are randomized.
All PSG parameters will be obtained separately  for each PSG recording and averaged across 
the pairs of consecutive PSG nights.
The following parameters will be derived from all PSGs:
LPS:  minutes from lights off to the first epoch of 20 consecutive epochs of non -
wakefulness
SE:  proportion of time spent asleep per TIB, calculated as TST/interval from “lights off” 
until “lights on”
WASO :  minutes of wake from t he onset of persistent sleep until lights on 
WASO2H :  minutes of wake during the interval from 240 minutes a fter lights off until

either barefoot or wearing socks .  The standing position (inside heel-to-inside heel distance)
and barefoot/socks conditions will be documented to ensure they  remain the same for a given 
subject at each postural stability  assessment timepoint.  They  will be instructed to stand as 
still as possible with ey es closed for 1 minute.  (revised per Amendment 01)   On the morning 
after the Screening PSG, subjects will complete a CDR posture assessment session for 
familiarization purposes only; no data from this session will be used for analyses.  This 
session must be conducted under the same conditions (eg, starting within 5 minutes of 
morning waketime, at bedside) as during the testing sessions at subsequent visits.
Body sway  is detected through the cable around the subject’s waist by the ataxiameter and 
these data are transmitted to a laptop. Body sway is measured in units of 1/3° of the angle of 
arc. For ease in reporting these will be called arbitrary  units, with a higher number indicating 
more bod y swa y (less postural stability ).

A computerized PAB will be administered on a laptop computer after the postural stability  
test.    (revised per Amendment 01)  While completing the PAB, subjects will be in bed and 
ambi ent lighting will be maintained at a level of 80 to100 lux at the subject’s eye level.   On 
the evening of the Screening PSG visit, before bedtime, subjects will be introduced to the 
PAB tasks and will undergo a minimum of 2 training sessions. If subjects cannot adequatel y 
perform the tasks during the training sessions, they will be excluded from further 
participation.   On the morning after the Screening PSG, subjects will complete a session of 
the cognitive PAB for familiarization purposes only; no data from this session will be used 
for anal yses.  This session must be conducted under the same conditions (eg, lighting, subject 
in bed) as during the testing sessions at subsequent visits.
The PAB comprises 9tasks, including Simple Reaction Time, Choice React ion Time, Digit 
Vigilance, Immediate Word Recall, Delay ed Word Recall, Word Recognition, Picture 
Recognition , Numeric Working Memory , and Spatial Working Memory .  The full PAB will 
take approximately  18to 30 minutes to complete.  Four composite domain factor scores are 
calculated b y combining outcome variables from the various tests, as described below:
Power of Attention
oA composite score from the speed scores of 3 tests of attention
oReflects the ability  to focus attention and process information
Continui ty of Attention
oA composite score created by  combining the accuracy  scores from the tests of 
attention 
oReflects the ability  to sustain attention (vigilance)
Quality  of Memory
oA composite score created by  combining the accuracy  measures from the two tests of 
working memory  and the four tests of episodic memory  
oReflects the ability  to store information in memory  and subsequentl y retrieve it
Speed of Memory  Retrieval
oA composite score created by  combining the reaction time scores from the two 
working memory  tests and the two episodic recognition tests

Safety  assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all AEs; regular laboratory  
evaluation for hematology , blood chemistry , and urine values; periodic measurement of vital 
signs, weight and ECGs; and the performance of physical examinations.  Safety will be 
assessed at every  clinic visit throughout the study , and at the EOS Visit.
9.5.1.5.1 COLUMBIA -SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE 
Suicidality  will be assessed using a self-rated electronic version of the eC-SSRS (Posner et 
al., 2011 ).  The eC-SSRS assesses an individual’s degree of suicidality , including both 
suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior.  Qualified personnel must evaluate positive responses 
on the eC-SSRS and take appropriate action as detailed in the training and certification 
process for administer ing the eC -SSRS.
9.5.1.5.2 TYRER BENZODIAZEPINE WITHDRAW AL SYMPTOM QUESTIONNAIRE 
An assessment of withdrawal sy mptoms wi ll be made using the T -BWSQ ( Tyrer et al., 1990 ) 
to be completed at the EOS Visit. Subjects will be asked about the presence/absence and 
severit y of the symptoms listed in the questionnaire.  For each listed symptom, the subject is 
to respond “No” (Score = 0), “Yes –moderate” (Score = 1) or “Yes –severe” (Score = 2).  
The sum of responses will be the subject’s score. (revised per Amendment 02)
9.5.1.5.3 ADVERSE EVENTS 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered an investigational product.  An AE does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the medicinal product. For this study , the study  drug is lemborexa nt. 
The criteria for identify ing AEs in this study  are:
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of an investigational product, 
whether or not considered related to the investigational product (Note :  Every  sign or 
symptom should not be listed as a separate AE if the applicable disease [diagnosis] is 
being reported as an AE)
Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease
Any deterioration in nonprotocol -required measurements of a laboratory  value or other 
clinical test (eg, ECG or x -ray) that results in sy mptoms, a change in treatment, or 
discontinuation of study  drug
Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (eg, headache) not present pretreatment 
(Baseline)
An abnormal laboratory  test result should be considered an AE if the identified laboratory 
abnormality  leads to any type of intervention, withdrawal of study  drug, or withholding of 
study  drug, whether prescribed in the protocol or not

Eisai
FINAL :  (v7.0), 05Feb2018Confidential Page 65of 109All AEs observed during the study  will be reported on the eCRF.  All AEs, regardless of 
relationship to study  drug or procedure, should be collected beginning from the time the 
subject signs the study  ICF through the last visit.  Serious adverse events (SAEs )will be 
collected for 28 day s after the last dose.
Abnormal laboratory  values should not be listed as separate AEs if they are considered to be 
part of the clinical syndrome that is being reported as an AE.  It is the responsibility  of the 
investigator to review all laboratory  findings in all subjects and determine if they constitute 
an AE.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated 
laboratory  abnormality should be classified as an AE.  Any laboratory  abnormality 
considered to constitute an AE should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Abnormal ECG (QTc F) results, if not otherwise considered part of a clinical sy mptom that is 
being reported as an AE, should be considered an AE if the QTcFinterval is more than 
450msec and there is an increase of more than 60msec from baseline.  Any ECG 
abnormality  that the investigator considers as an AE should be reported as such.
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to review the results of the eC-SSRS in all subjects 
and determine if any result constitutes an AE.  Medical and scientific judgment should be 
exercised in deciding whether an isolated suicidality  rating scale response should be 
classified as an AE (see Section 9.5.1.5   for a description of the eC-SSRS ). 
AEs in clinical investigation subjects include any change in the subject’s condition.  This 
includes symptoms, physical findings, or clinical syndromes.  All AEs encountered during 
the clinica l study  will be reported on the eCRF .  
All AEs must be followed for 28 daysafter the subject’s last dose, or until resolution, 
whichever comes first.   
Every effort must be made by the investigator to categorize each AE according to its 
severity and its relationship to the study treatment.
ASSESSING SEVERITY OF ADVERSE EVENTS
AEs will be graded on a 3-point scale (mild, moderate, severe) and reported in the detail 
indicated on the eCRF.  The definitions are as follows:
Mild Discomfort noticed, but no disr uption of normal daily  activity
Moderate Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily  activit y
Severe Incapacitating, with inability  to work or to perform normal daily  activity
The criteria for assessing severity  are different than those used for seriousness (see 
Section 9.5.1.5.4 )for the definition of an SAE).

FINAL :  (v7.0), 05Feb2018Confidential Page 66of 109ASSESSING RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY TREATMENT
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study treatment are:
Temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study  treatment
The course of the event, especiall y the effect of discontinuation of study  treatment or 
reintroduction of stud y treatment, as applicable
Whether the event is known to be associated with the study  treatment or with other 
similar treatments
The presence of risk factors in the study  subject known to increase the occurrence of the 
event
The presence of nonstudy, treatme nt-related factors that are known to be associated with 
the occurrence of the event
CLASSIFICATION OF CAUSALITY
The relationship of each AE to the study  drug will be recorded on the eCRF in response to 
the following question:
Is there a reasonable possibility  that the study  drug caused the AE?
Yes (related) A causal relationship between the study  drug and the AE is a reasonable 
possibility .
No (not related) A causal relationship between the study  drug and the AE is not a 
reasonable possibility .
9.5.1.5.4 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AND EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIAL SITUATIONS
An SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death
Is life -threatening (ie, the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE  as it 
occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or 
was allowed to continue, might have caused death)
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
Is acongenital anomal y/birth defect (in the child of a subject who was exposed to the 
study  drug)
Other important medical events that may not be immediately  life-threatening or result in 
death or hospitalization but, when based on appropriate medical judgmen t, may jeopardize 
the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes in the definition of

FINAL :  (v7.0), 05Feb2018Confidential Page 67of 109SAE listed above should also be considered SAEs.  Medical and scientific judgment should 
be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is a ppropriate in such situations. 
In addition to the above, events associated with special situations (EASS) include pregnancy 
or exposure to study  drug through breastfeeding and AEs associated with study  drug 
overdose, misuse, abuse, or medication error.   These EASSs are to be captured using the 
SAE procedures but are to be considered as SAEs only  if they  meet one of the above criteria.  
All AEs associated with special situations are to be reported on the eCRF whether or not they  
meet the criteria for SAEs .
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely , to stabilization.
The following hospitalizations are not considered to be SAEs because there is no “AE” (ie, 
there is no untoward medical occurrence) associated with the hospitalization :
Hospitalizations for respite care 
Planned hospitalizations required b y the protocol
Hospitalization planned before informed consent (where the condition requiring the 
hospitalization has not changed after stud y drug administration)
Hospitalization for a dministration of study  drug or insertion of access for administration 
of study  drug
Hospitalization for routine maintenance of a device (eg, battery  replacement) that was in 
place before stud y entry
If possible, a blood sample for the measurement of study drug plasma concentration should 
be drawn at the first report of an SAE or a severe unexpected AE and at its resolution.
9.5.1.5.5 LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS
Clinical laboratory  tests are to be performed according to the schedule in Table 2.  Blood and 
urine samples will be collected for the clinical laboratory  tests as listed in Table 3.  Subjects 
should be in a seated or supine position during blood collection.  
Viral testing for hepatitis B and C will be conducted from a blood sample obtained at 
Screening. The specific test for hepatitis B is the surface antigen panel (HBsAg) with 
confirmation as needed.  The specific tests for hepatitis C are the hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
antibody  immunoglobulin G (IgG), with confirmation as needed using the HCV score.  
(revised per Amendme nt 01)
A 30-mL urine sample for assessment of drugs of abuse will be collected at designated time 
points as specified in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments ( Table 4).  These samples will 
be tested for common drugs of use/abuse :  eg, cocaine, cannabinoids, phency clidine , opioids

9.5.1.5.6 VITAL SIGNS AND WEIGHT MEASUREMENTS
Vital sign measurements (ie, sy stolic and diastolic blood pressure [BP] [mmHg], p ulse [beats 
per minute], respiratory rate [per minute], and body  temperature [in centigrade ])will be 
obtained at the visits designated in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments (Table 4) by a 
validated method.  Blood pressure and pulse will be measured after the subject has been in a 
sitting position for 5 minutes.  All BP measurements should be performed on the same arm, 
preferabl y by the same person.  Validated methods will be used for all vital sign 
measurements, and values will be recorded.  Height (cm; once only)and weight (kg) will 
also be measured.
When vital signs are to be obtained concurrentl y with PK or other blood samples, the vital 
sign measurements will be performed before drawing blood samples in order to maximize the 
accuracy  of blood sampling times while minimizing the potential effects of blood drawing on 
recordings obtained during safet y assessments.
9.5.1.5.7 PHYSIC AL EXAMINATIONS
Physical examinations (full or brief) will be performed as designated in the Schedule of 
Procedures/Assessments Table 4).  At Screening and at the end-of-study  visit, a full physical 
examination will be conducted, including evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, 
neck, chest (including heart and lungs), abdomen, limbs, skin.  The full phy sical examination 
will include a brief neurological examination to assess possible impairment in major 
functions (ie, motor, cerebellar, sensory , major pathological reflexes).  A urogenital 
examination will only be required in the presence of clinical symptoms related to this region 
and at the di scretion of the investigator.  At other study  visits as designated in Table 4,a brief 
physical examination will be conducted to assess health status by brief evaluation of the 
head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, heart, lungs, abdomen, and extremities, and other physical 
conditions of note.  Documentation of the physical examinations, including the brief 
neurological examinations, will be included in the source documentation at the site.  Only 
changes from screening physical examination findings that meet the definition of an AE will

9.5.1.5.9 OTHER ASSESSMENTS
EQ-5D-3L
The EQ-5D-3L is a generic instrument that can be used in the clinical and economic 
evaluation of health care, and to collect data on quality  of life and preferences/utility (Brooks 
et al., 1996 ). The instrument comprises questions on mobility , self-care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort and anxiety /depression, and a visual analogue scale from 0 (“Worst 
imaginable health state”) to 100 (“Best imaginable health state”).
PATIENT GLOBAL IMPRESSION –INSOMNIA 
The PGI-Insomnia questionnaire is a self-report assessment asking about a subject ’s 
perception of the effects of the study  medication on their sleep relative to their sleep before 
entering in the study .  As such, the PGI-Insomnia does not have a baseline and the outcome 
is not change from baseline, but rather the global impression of the study  medication’s 
effects at the end oftreatment. The PGI-Insomnia has 3 items related to study  medication 
effects (a:  helped/worsened sleep, b: decreased/increased time to fall asleep, and c: 
increased/decreased TST) and 1 item related to perceived appropriateness of study 
medication strengt h.  The first 3 items are answered on a 3-point scale (1=positive 
medication effect, 2=neutral medication effect, 3=negative medication effect) and the last 
item on a different 3 -point scale (medication :  1=too strong, 2=just right, 3=too weak).  Each 
item will be reported separatel y.  This scale was used in studies of zolpidem (Roth et al., 
2006 ; Walsh et al., 2008 ).

The scheduling of stud y procedures and assessments is shown in Table 4.
9.5.3 Appropriateness of Measurements
Most of the clinical assessments are standard measurements commonly  used in studies of 
drugs for the treatment of subjects with insomnia disorder.
Completion of sleep diaries by  subjects is considered to be an appropriate method to measure 
changes in subjective sleep parameters, thereby  allowing assessments of secondary  efficacy  
in this study .  The advantages of the electronic Sleep Diary  to be used in this study include 
that the questions and instruction al texthave been adapted from sleep diaries that have were 
developed by clinicians and researchers with expertise in insomnia disorder, and have 
undergone linguistic validation and cognitive debriefing to optim ize their use in this study . 
The Sleep Diary  will include questions to assess the subject’s rating of sleep qualit y each 
night and sleepiness/alertness level in the morning.  The ISI has been widely  used to evaluate 
the subjective impact of insomnia sever ity on psy chosocial functioning, which is one type of 
daytime functioning impairment experienced by those with insomnia disorder.  The FSS 
measures fatigue, which is another t ype of day time impairment that is often a consequence of 
insomnia.  This scale has been employ ed primarily  in clinical trials of cognitive and 
behavioral treatments for insomnia disorder. Because theobjectives of this study  include 
assessing the response to lemborexant of both nighttime sleep and daytime impairment 
complaints, the ISI and the FSS will be evaluated for changes from baseline.  The PGI-
Insomnia and EuroQoL assessment (version EQ-5D-3L)will also be employ ed.  Both 
measures have been used in studies evaluating the impact of treatment for insomnia on the 
patients’ global perceptions of sleep quality  and quality  of life. Together these measures will 
provide a broad evaluation of the effects oflemborexant on each patient’s sleep, daytime 
functioning, and quality  of life.
The CDR posture and cognitive PAB will assess whether there are residual effects of study  
drug on morning postural stability  and cognition.  There are documented effects of hypnotic 
drugs, including zolpidem, on postural stabilit y and certain cognitive domains in the morning 
hours.  These effects are associat ed with an increase drisk of falling and other negative 
effects on functioning in the morning hours.  The measures to be employ ed to evaluate the 
effects on postural stability  and cognition have been widely  used in clinical trials of drugs in 
older individ uals, including clinical trials of treatments for insomnia disorder. 
9.5.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events, Pregnancy, and Events Associated 
with Special Situations
9.5.4.1 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
All SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS, regardless of their relation ship to study treatment, 
must be reported on a completed SAE form by email or fax as soon as possible but no 
later than 24 hours from the time the investigator becomes aware of theevent.   (revised 
per Amendment 01)

FINAL :  (v7.0), 05Feb2018Confidential Page 76of 109Serious adverse events, regardless of causalit y assessment, must be collected through the last 
visit and for 28 days after the subject’s last dose.  All SAEs must be followed to resolution 
or, if resolution is unlikely, to stabilization.  Any SAE judged bythe investigator to be 
related to the study  treatment or any protocol -required procedure should be reported to the 
sponsor regardless of the length of time that has passed since study  completion.
The detailed contact information for reporting of SAEs is provided in the Investigator Study 
File.
For urgent safety issues please ensure all appropriate medical care is administered to the 
subject and contact the appropriate stud y team member listed in the I nvestigator Study  File.
It is very important that the SAE report form be filled out as completel y as possible at the 
time of the initial report.  This includes the investigator’s assessment of causality .
Any follow -up information received on SAEs should be forwarded within 24 hours of its 
receipt.  (revised per Amendment 01)If the follow -up information changes the investigator’s 
assessment of causality , this should also be noted on the follow -up SAE form.
Preliminary  SAE reports should be followed as soon as possible by detailed descriptions 
including copies of hospital case reports, autops y reports, and other documents requested by 
the sponsor.
The investigator must notify  his/her IRB/IEC of the occurrence of the SAE in writing, if 
required b y their institution.  A cop y of this communication must be forwarded to the sponsor 
or the responsible CRO, to be filed in the sponsor’s Trial Master File.
9.5.4.2 Reporting of Pregnancy and Exposure to Study Drug Through Breastfeeding
Although the female subject population will be postmenopausal, in the event that a 
pregnancy  does occur, investigato rs will c apture and report such events .
Any pregnancy  in which the estimated date of conception is either before the last visit or 
within 28 days of last study  treatment, or any exposure to study  drug through breastfeeding 
during stud y treatment or within 28 day s of last study  treatment, must be reported.
If an adverse outcome of a pregnancy  is suspected to be related to study  drug exposure, this 
should be reported regardless of the length of time that has passed since the exposure to stu dy 
treatment.
A congenital anomal y, death during perinatal period, an induced abortion, or a spontaneous 
abortion are considered to be an SAE and should be reported in the same time frame and in 
the same format as all other SAEs (see Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
[Section 9.5.4.1 ]).
Pregnancies or exposure to study  drug through breastfeeding must be reported by fax or

pregnancies must be followed to outcome.  The outcome of the pregnanc y must be reported 
as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours after the time the investigator becomes aware 
of the outcome.   (revised per Amendment 01)
A subject who becomes pregnant must be withdrawn from the stud y.
9.5.4.3 Reporting of Events Associated wit h Special Situations
Adverse events associated with study drug overdose, misuse, abuse, and medication error 
refer to AEs associated with uses of the study  drug outside of that specified by the protocol.  
Overdose, misuse, abuse, and medication error are d efined as follows:
Overdose Accidental or intentional use of the study  drug in an amount higher 
than the protocol -defined dose
Misuse Intentional and inappropriate use of study  drug not in accordance with 
theprotocol
Abuse Sporadic or persistent intent ional excessive use of study  drug 
accompanied b y harmful physical or ps ychological effects
Medication error Any unintentional event that causes or leads to inappropriate study 
drug use or subject harm while the study  drug is in the control of site
personne lor the subject.  
All AEs associated with overdose , misuse, abuse, or medication error should becaptured on 
the Adverse Event CRF and also reported using the procedures detailed in Reporting of 
Serious Adverse Events (Section 9.5.4.1 ) even if the AEs do not meet serious criteria.  
Investigators should report whether one or both study  drugs had been taken incorrectl y. 
Abuse is alway s to be captured as an AE.  If the AE associated with an overdose, misuse, 
abuse, or medication error does not meet serious criteria, it must still be reported using the 
SAE form and in an expedited manner but should be noted as nonserious on the SAE form 
and the Adverse Event eCRF.
9.5.4.4 Expedited Reporting
The sponsor must inform investigators (or as regionall y required, the head of the medical 
institution) and regulatory authorities of repor table events, in compliance with applicable 
regulatory  requirements, on an expedited basis (ie, within specific time frames).  For this 
reason, it is imperative that sites provide complete SAE information in the manner described 
above.

In the case of a medical emergency  where the appropriate treatment of the subject requires 
knowledge of the study  treatment given, the investigator may break the randomization code 
for an individual subject.  In all such cases, the AE necessitating the emergency  blind break 
will be handled as an SAE in accordance with the procedures indicated above.  Any broken 
code will be clearl y justified and documented.  The Medical Monitor must be notified 
immediately  of the blind break.
9.5.4.6 Regulatory Reporting of Adverse Events
Adverse events will be reported by the sponsor or athird party acting on behalf of the 
sponsor to regulatory  authorities in compliance with local and regional law and established 
guidance.  The format of these reports will be dictated by the local and regional 
requirements.
All studies that are conducted within any  European country  will comply  with European Good 
Clinical Practice Directive 2005/28/EC and Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC.  All 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported, as required, to the 
competent authorities of al l involved European member states.
9.5.5 Completion/Discontinuation of Subjects
For purposes of entering subject disposition in the eCRF, a subject will be considered to have 
completed the study  per protocol after the End of Study  visit has been completed. (revised 
per Amendment 01) For analysis purposes, asubject will be considered to have completed 
the study  once the assessments on the morning after the last dose of study  drug have been 
completed .  All subjects will be required to return to the clinic at least 14, but not more than 
18 day s later for an End of Study  (EOS )visit. 
The investigator or subject may  elect to discontinue thesubject’s participation in the study  at 
any time for any reason.  Subjects who discontinue study  drug prematurel y at any time after 
randomization at Visit 5(Baseline) will be encouraged to return to the site as soon as 
possible (preferably  within 7 days)toundergo an early termination (ET)Visit, as described 
in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments ( Table 4). 
If the investigator or sponsor discontinues the study  prematurel y, the investigator will 
promptly  explain to the subject involved that the study  will be discontinued for that subject 
and will provide appropriate referral for medical treatment and other necessary  measures for 
the subject.  A subject who has ceased to return for visits will be followed up by  mail, phone, 
or other means to gather information such as the reason for failure to return, the status of 
treatment compliance, the presence or absence of AEs, and clinical courses of signs and 
symptoms.  This information will be recorded in the eCRF.
Subjects who discontinue early from the study  will be discontinued for one of these prima ry 
reasons:  AE(s), lost to follow -up, subject choice, lack of therapeutic effect, or 
administrative/other.  Discontinuations due to non-compliance with study  drug, time spent in

primary  reason, the subject may indicate one or more of secondary  reasons for 
discontinuation.  Study disposition information will be collected on the Subject Disposition 
eCRF.
A subject removed from the study  for any  reason will not be repl aced.  
9.5.6 Abuse or Diversion of Study Drug
During the study , the investigator will report any concern about abuse or diversion of one or 
both study  drugs.
Adverse events associated with abuse or diversion will be appropriately reported as AEs and 
monitored p er Section 9.5.1.5.4 . Abuse is alway s to be captured as an AE.
9.5.7 Confirmation of Medical Care by Another Physician
The investigator will instruct subjects to inform site personnel when they are planning to 
receive medical care by another phy sician.  At each visit, the investigator will ask the subject 
whether he/she has received medical care by another physician since the last visit or is 
planning to do so in the future.  When the subject is going to receive medical care by  another 
physician, the investigator, with the consent of the subject, will inform the other physician 
that the subject is participating in the clinical study .
9.6 Data Quality  Assuran ce
This study  will be organized, performed, and reported in compliance with the protocol, 
SOPs, working practice documents, and applicable regulations and guidelines.  
9.6.1 Data Collection
Data required by the protocol will be collected on the eCRFs and entere d into a validated 
data management system that is compliant with all regulatory  requirements.  As defined by 
ICH guidelines, the eCRF is a printed, optical, or electronic document designed to record all 
of the protocol -required information to be reported t o the sponsor on each study  subject.
Data collection on the eCRF must follow the instructions described in the eCRF Completion 
Guidelines.  The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all 
clinical data entered on the eCRF.  The investigator or designee as identified on Form

Control of Ty pe I Error (revised per Amendment 03)
A sequential gate-keeping procedure will be used for the primary  and the key secondary 
endpoint comparisons to control for the overall type I error at the 0.05 significance level 
(Figure 2).  The first endpoint comparison will be tested at the 0.05 significance level.  If the 
testing is found to be statistical ly significant , then proceed to the next endpoint testing at 
signif icance level of 0.05, otherwise stop testing.  
The primary  endpoints will be tested in the following order:
Change from baseline of the mean L PS of Day s 29 and 30 of LEM10 compared to PBO
Change from baseline of the mean L PS of Day s 29 and 30 of LEM5 comp ared to PBO
The key secondary  endpoints will only be tested if both primary  analyses are statistically 
significant at the 0.05 level.  The key secondary endpoints will be tested in the following

(55<65years; 65 years or older), treatment, time (Day s 1/2, and Days 29/30), and the 
interaction of treatment by time.  Since LPS is known to be non-normally  distributed, a log-
transformation will beused in the analy sisAn unstructured covariance matrix will be used, 
and if the model fails to converge, then an autoregressive matrix will be used.   The missing 
values will be imputed using a pattern mixture model utilizing multiple imputation s(MI) 
assuming the missing values are missing not at random (MNAR) utilizing the complete case 
missing value pattern (CCMV -subjects who completed primary  efficacy  assessments 
without missing values) .  The missing values for a given visit will be imputed using all

The change from baseline mean score of the quality  of sleep item on the Sleep Diary  for the 
means of the first 7 days and last 7 days of the Treatment Period will be analyzed using
MMRM assuming MAR .  (revised per Amendment 03)
Rebound insomnia is defined as worsened sleep relative to Screening after study  drug 
treatment is completed.  Sleep Diary  datafrom the Follow -up Period will be compared to 
Sleep Diary  data from the Screening Period to assess whether subjects experience rebound 
insomnia.  Specifically, a higher value for sSOL or sWASO during the Follow -up Period 
compared to the mean sSOL  or sWASO value during the Screening Period will be considered 
worsened sleep. (revised per Amendment s01and 02 )
To assess rebound insomnia, both categorical analy sis at the subject level and continuous 
analysis at the group mean level will be perform ed.  Foreach of the first 3 nights , the mean 
of the first 3 nights, and the mean of each of the 2 weeks of the Follow -up Period the 
proportion of subjects whose corresponding value for sSOL  or sWASO exceeds the 
corresponding Screening Period value by 5 minutes will be summarized by treatment group 
and compared to placebo. The percentage of ‘rebounders’ between each treatment and 
placebo group will be analy zed using a CMH test .  (revised per Amendment s01,02, and 03 )
To assess statistical significance using the continuous data at the group mean level, thedata 
will be analy zed using ANCOVA, adjusted for region , age group and treatment.  The LS 
mean of each of the first 3 nights and each week of the Follow -up Period will be compared to

95% CI of sSOL  or sWASO for each of the first 3 nights and the mean of each week of the 
Follow -Up Period exceeds the upper bound of a 95% CI for the values during the Screening 
Period in the given treatment group, it will be considered strong evidence for rebound 
insomnia. If the LS means for sSOL and sWASO for the Follow -up Period are all lower than

Laboratory  test results will be assigned a low -normal -high (LNH) classification according to 
whether the value was below (L), within (N), or above (H) the laboratory  parameter’s 
reference range.  Within-treatm ent comparisons will be based on 3 by 3 tables (shift tables) 
that, for a particular laboratory  test, compare the Study  Baseline LNH classification to the 
LNH classification at end of study/early termination, by treatment group.
Clinical laboratory  results post-baseline will be evaluated for markedl y abnormal values.  A 
laboratory  test will be considered markedl y abnormal if the result worsens to meet Eisai 
grading criteria for laboratory  values limit of Grade 2 or higher .  If the Grade 2 limit is 
missing, the Grade 1 limit will be considered.  Appendix 1presents the Eisai grading criteria

9.7.2 Determination of Sample Size
The sample size was estimated for the each comparison of LEM10 vs. PBO, and LEM5 vs
PBO with respect to the mean change from baseline of LPS at Month 1, on the basis of a 
2-sided t-test at the 0.05 α-level for each treatment comparison .  (revised per Amendment 03)
On the basis of the dose finding study  E2006 -G000 -201 (Study  201), across various 
lemborexant doses (1 to 25 mg) at Days 14 and 15, the standard deviation (SD)of change 
from baseline for log-transformed LPS is assumed to be 0.9. The LS mean treatment 
difference at Days 14/15 from Study  201 for log-transformed LPS of LEM10 and LEM5 
compared with PBO was 0.75 and -1.15, respectively .  Therefore, a sample size of 250 
subjects for LEM5, 250 subjects for LEM10, and 200 subjects for PBOhas atleast 95%
power for each treatment comparison, LEM10 with PBO, andLEM5 with PBO ,based on 
2-sided, 2 -sample t-test at 5% significance level .  (revised per Amendment 03)
Power is also estimated for the key secondary  objective s, the comparison of LEM 10and
LEM 5to PBOon change from baselin eof SE and WASO, and LEM10 and LEM5 to ZOL 
on WASO2H.   Asample size of 250 subjects each for LEM5, LEM10, and ZOL, and 200

between LEM and PBO for change from baseline in SE, at least 80% power for detecting a

9.7.3 Interim Analysis
An interim analy sis is planned to be conducted after approximately 50% of subjects 
(approximately  n=475 subjects) have been randomized and either completed Day 31 
assessments or discontinued from the study .  This interim analy sis will be conducted for 
admi nistrative reasons as detailed in the separate Interim Anal ysis charter.  When the 
specified number of subjects has completed the Day 31 assessments, an independent 
statistician external to the Sponsor will be provided with the relevant PSG dataset and wil l be 
unblinded to the primary  endpoint, ie, change from baseline in WASO2H for the mean of 
Days 29 and 30.  A conditional power will be calculated to predict the probability  that the 
trial will achieve a significant treatment effect for WASO2H in the LEM10 versus ZOL arms 
at the end of the study , given what is observed at the time of interim analy sis. The interim 
analysis will be limited to the comparison of LEM10 versus ZOL on the change from 
baseline in WASO2H for the mean of Days 29 and 30.  No other endpoints, dose groups, or 
timepoints will be analyzed at the interim analy sis. The study  will not be terminated for 
either futility  or efficacy .  Therefore no impact to the ty pe I error rate is expected.  
The method of calculating the conditional power will be detailed in the Interim Anal ysis 
charter, along with operational procedures, unblinding procedures, procedures for 
communicating the results of the conditional power calculation and recipients of this 
information.  To preclude potential influence on the conduct of the remainder of the study , 
disclosure of the conditional power will be limited to a prespecified set of executive -level 
individuals at the sponsor and sponsor's co-development partner. No individuals involved 
with the conduct of the study  will have access to the interim data or the results of the interim

Eisai
FINAL :  (v7.0), 05Feb2018Confidential Page 99of 10911PROCEDURES AND INSTR UCTIONS (ADM INISTRA TIVE 
PROCEDURES)
11.1 Changes to the Protocol
Any change to the protocol requires a written protocol amendment or administrative change 
that must be approved by the sponsor before implementation.  Amendments specificall y 
affecting the safety  of subjects, the scope of the investigation, orthe scientific quality  of the 
study  require submission to health or regulatory  authorities as well as additional approval by 
the applicable IRBs/IECs.  These requirements should in no way prevent any immediate 
action from being taken by the investigator, or by the sponsor, in the interest of preserving 
the safet y of all subjects included in the study .  If the investigator determines that an 
immediate change to or deviation from the protocol is necessary  for safet y reasons to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to the subjects, the sponsor’s Medical Monitor and the 
IRB/IEC for the site must be notified immediately .  The sponsor must notify  the health or 
regulatory  authorit y as required per local regulations.
Protocol amendments that affect only administrative aspects of the study may not require 
submission to health or regulatory  authority  or the IRB/IEC, but the health or regulatory  
authority  and IRB/IEC (or if regionall y required, the head of the medical institution) should 
be kept informed of such changes as required by local regulations.  In these cases, the 
sponsor may  be required to send a letter to the I RB/IEC and the Competent Authorities (or, if 
regionally  required, the head of the medical institution) detailing such changes.
11.2 Adherence to the Protocol
The investigator will conduct the study  in strict accordance with the protocol (refer to 
ICH E6, Section 4.5).
11.3 Monitoring Procedures
The sponsor’s/CRO’s CRA will maintain contact with the investigator and designated staff 
by telephone, letter, or email betwee n study  visits,  Monitoring visits to each site and remote 
monitoring will be conducted between onsite monitoring visits by the assigned CRA as 
described in the monitoring plan.  The investigator (or if regionally  required, the head of the 
medical institut ion) will allow the CRA to inspect the clinical, laboratory , and pharmacy 
facilities to assure compliance with GCP and local regulatory  requirements.  The eCRFs and 
subject’s corresponding original medical records (source documents) are to be fully  availab le 
for review by the sponsor’s representatives at regular intervals.  These reviews verify 
adherence to study  protocol and data accuracy  in accordance with local regulations.  All 
records at the site are subject to inspection by the local auditing agency and to IRB/IEC 
review.
In accordance with ICH E6, Section 1.52, source documents include, but are not limited to,
the following:

Correspondence regarding a stud y subject’s treatment between ph ysicians or memoranda 
sent to the I RBs/IECs
eCRF components (eg, questionnaires) that are completed directl y by subjects and serve 
as their own source
11.4 Recording of Data
AneCRF is required and must be completed for each subject by qualified and authorized 
personnel.  All data on the eCRF must reflect the corresponding source document, except 
when a section of the eCRF itself is used as the source document.  Any correction to entries 
made on the eCRF must be documented in a valid audit trail where the correction isdated, 
the individual making the correct is identified ,the reason for the change is stated, and the 
original data are not obscured.  Only data required by the protocol for the purposes of the 
study  should be collected.
The investigator must sign each eCRF.  The investigator will report the eCRFs to the sponso r 
and retain a cop y of the eCRFs.
11.5 Identification of Source Data
All data to be recorded on the eCRF must reflect the corresponding source documents. 
11.6 Retention of Records
The circumstances of completion or termination of the study  notwithstanding, the 
investigator (or if regionally  required, the head of the medical institution or the designated 
representative) is responsible for retaining all study  documents, including but not limited to 
the protocol, copies of eCRFs, the I nvestigator's Brochure, and regul atory agency  registration 
documents (eg, Form FDA 1572 ICFs, and IRB/IEC correspondence).  In addition, the 
Clinical Study Protocol
Per Amendment 04E2006 -G000 -304
Eisai
FINAL :  (v7.0), 05Feb2018Confidential Page 101of 109sponsor will send a list of treatment codes by study subject to the investigator after the 
clinical database for this study  has been locked.  The site should plan to retain study 
documents, as directed by the sponsor, for at least 2 years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated 
marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 3 years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product.
It is requested that at the completion of the required retention period, or should the 
investigator retire or relocate, the investigator contact the sponsor, allowing the sponsor the 
option of permanentl y retaining the stud y records.
11.7 Auditing Procedures and Inspection
In addition to routine monitoring procedures, the sponsor’s Clinical Quality  Assurance 
department conducts audits of clinical research activities in accordance with the sponsor’s 
SOPs to evaluate compliance with the principles of ICH GCP and all applicable local 
regulations.  If a government regulatory  authority  requests an inspection during the study  or 
after its completion, the inv estigator must inform the sponsor immediately .
11.8 Handling of Study  Drug
All study  drug will be supplied to the PI(or a design ated pharmacist) by the sponsor.  Drug 
supplies must be kept in an appropriate secure area (eg, locked cabinet) and stored accordin g 
to the conditions specified on the drug labels.  The investigator (or a designated pharmacist) 
must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of the study  drug in a drug 
accountability  ledger, a copy  of which must be given to the sponsor at the end of the study .  
An accurate record of the date and amount of study  drug dispensed to each subject must be 
available for inspection at any  time.  The CRA will visit the site and review these documents 
along with all other study  conduct documents at appropriate intervals once study  drug has 
been received b y the site.
All drug supplies are to be used only for this study  and not for any other purpose.  The 
investigator (or site personnel) must not destroy  any drug labels or any partly  used or unused 
drug supply  before approval to do so by the sponsor.  At the conclusion of the study  and as 
appropriate during the study , the investigator (or a designated pharmacist) will return all used 
and unused drug containers, drug labels, and a copy  of the complete d drug disposition form 
to the sponsor’s CRA or, when approval is given by the sponsor, will destroy  supplies and 
containers at the site.
11.9 Publication of Results

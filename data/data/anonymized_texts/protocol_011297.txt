INTRODUCTION
Study rationale
Tezepel umab is a fully  human immunogl obulin G (IgG) 2λ monoclonal ant ibody  (mAb) di rected 
against TSLP and is current ly being evaluated for severe asthma.
In the current global Phase 3 asthma clinical program, 210 mg o f tezepel umab (or pl acebo) is 
administered as a single 1.91 mL subcutaneous (SC) injection (110 mg/mL) via vial (wit h 
disposable syringe) Q4W at the clinic. An accessorized pre -filled syringe (APFS) and auto -
injector (AI) have been developed to enable safe, effecti ve and convenient tezepelumab 
administration by caregivers and patients in a ho me use environment in addit ion to 
administration by healt h care professionals (HCPs) in the clinic. The purpose of this study is to 
assess the funct ionality and perform ance o f the APFS and AI used to administer a fixed 210 mg 
dose of tezepelumab SC in the clinic and an at -home setting.
Background
Biologic therapies have been shown to reduce the annualised asthma exacerbat ion rate (AAER) 
in severe asthma pat ients who are uncontrolled wit h medium to high dose ICS and addit ional 
asthma controller medicat ions. Omalizumab provided benefit for a subgroup of patients with 
proven reactivit y to an aeroallergen and elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels who 
remain inadequately  control led with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus a lo ng-acting beta -
agonist (LABA) ( Xolair US PI 2018 ). Four additional bio logics, m epolizumab, reslizumab, 
benralizumab and dupilumab, have recent ly been approved for severe asthma with an 
eosinophilic phenoty pe (Nucala US PI 2017 ;Cinqair US PI 2019; Fasenra US PI 2017 ; Dupixent 
US PI 2018 ).  Bio logics targeting IL -5 and IgE are now included in internat ional treatment 
guidelines ( GINA 2018) as an add- on treatment to patients uncontrolled with ICS/LABA 
treatment. However, even when using current ly available bio logics, substant ial proporti ons of 
patients continue to experience exacerbations and may benefit fro m agents that target different 
molecular pathways ( Wenzel 2016 ; Fasenra US PI 2017 ; Froidure et al. 2016 ; Swedin e t al. 
2017). Therefore, despite these addit ional therapeutic options, there is st ill a clear unmet medical 
need amo ng patients with severe asthma, independent ly of IgE status or eosinophil level, who are 
unable to gain co mplete asthma control using current ly available therapies.
Thymic stromal lymphopoiet in (TSLP) is an epit helial cell -derived cy tokine that is produced in 
responses to proinflammatory  stimuli (e.g., infectious, allergic and environmental st imuli) and 
traum a. TSLP has an upstream and central role in the init iation of immune responses and can 
activate a broad range of cell t ypes including eosinophils, mast cells, T cells, dendrit ic cells, 
Type 2 innate lympho id cells and basophils ( Watson and Gauvreau 2014 ). Classically , TSLP 
may be a cr itical co mponent in the init iation and perpetuation of the T helper 2 (Th2) response 
and the result ing cascade of cytokines associated with T2 driven asthma ( Kaur and Brigh tling 
2012). Asthma is recognized as a heterogeneous disease, though, and there are subsets of patients 
that do not exhibit T2 -associ ated di sease ( Wenzel 2012). Emerging data indicates that TSLP may  
also m ediate non -allergic (non -T2) inflammat ion (Tanaka et al. 2009 , Ziegler et al . 2013 ).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 22 (107 ) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426Tezepel umab is a fully  human immunogl obulin G (IgG) 2λ monoclonal ant ibody  (mAb) di rected 
against TSLP. Tezepelumab binds to human TSLP and prevents its interaction with the TSLP 
receptor (TSLPR). Owing to the central role of TSLP as an upstream and pleiotropic cy tokine in 
mediat ing asthma pathophysio logy, anti -TSLP therapy  is anticipated to have abroad impact on 
the spectrum of inflammatory  responses seen in asthma.
Results of a co mpleted inhaled allerg en challenge study  in 31 adult subjects with mild atopic 
asthma (Study  20101183) dem onstrated that tezepelumab attenuated the late allergic response 
and the early allergic response to allergen challenge, as measured by the area -under -the-curve 
(AUC) for th e percent fall in the forced expiratory  volume in one second (FEV 1) and the 
maximum percent fall in FEV 1. Tezepel umab also attenuated the increase in fract ional expired 
nitric oxi de value on the post -allergen day co mpared with the pre -allergen day. Mult iple doses of 
700 m g IV tezepel umab dem onstrated an acceptable safet y profile in subjects with mild atopic 
asthma. No subjects developed ant i-drug antibodies (ADA) after receiving tezepelumab 
(Gauvreau et al. 2014 ). Based upon these data, the MedImmune/AstraZeneca conducted a 
rando mized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, dose range finding study  in asthmat ics who were 
inadequately controlled with mediu m or hi gh dose ICS/LABA with or without other controller 
medicat ions.
Study  CD-RI-MEDI9929- 1146 was a Phase 2b mult icenter, mult inational, dose -ranging, double -
blind, randomized, parallel -arm, placebo -controlled study  to eval uate the effect of 3 dose level s 
of tezepel umab on the AAER in adult subjects with inadequately  controlled, severe asthma. 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 dose levels o f subcutaneous (SC) 
tezepel umab (70 m g every  4 weeks [Q4W], 210 mg Q4W, 280 mg every  two weeks [Q 2W]) or 
placebo (Q2W) for 52 weeks. Ano malo us data at a single site was identified following 
completion of this study  and due to GCP non -compliance, all data relat ing to 34 subjects from 
this site were excluded and the CSR revised. Consequent ly, a total of 550 subjects received at 
least 1 dose of tezepelumab or placebo. An AAER reduction of 62%, 71%, and 66% for the 70 
mg Q4W, 210 mg Q4W, and 280 mg Q2W tezepelumab groups, respectively, compared wit h 
placebo were observed in the intent -to-treat population ( p<0.001). After repeated SC 
administration, mean serum trough concentration increased over time and achieved steady -state 
by week 12. Tezepel umab exhibited linear pharmacokinet ics (PK) across the 3 doses. A total of 
6 (4.3%) placebo subjects and 7 (1.7%) t ezepelumab subjects who had no detectable ADA at 
baseline had detectable ADA post -treatm ent; no subjects developed neutralizing ADA in the 
study . The resul ts of this study  did not i dentify safety concerns associated with tezepelumab for 
any dosing regimen. The frequencies of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were 
similar between the placebo (65.9%) and the total tezepelumab (66.0%) dose groups. A majorit y 
of subjects had TEAEs that were mild or moderate in severit y and not related to invest igational
product (IP). Few subjects had TEAEs that resulted in permanent discont inuat ion of IP, and at 
similar incidence between the tezepelumab (5 subjects [1.2%] overall) and placebo (1 subject 
[0.7%]) groups. Overall, tezepelumab was well -tolerated wi th an acce ptable safety  profile and no 
ident ified safety risks were noted ( Corren et al, 2017 ).

Benefit/risk assessment
In order to evaluate the clinical benefit -risk balance for tezepelumab, preclinical and clinical data 
have been taken into considerat ion, as well as a review of the available information for 
monoclonal antibodies that are approved for or are in development for the treatment of severe 
asthma. Benefits for tezepelumab over placebo include a clinically meaningful reduct ion in 
asthma exacerbations, improvement in lung function and asthma control metrics. 
Tezepel umab has been well tolerated with no identified s afety  risks to date in the clinical 
development program. No serious allergic reactions or anaphylact ic reactions considered related 
to tezepel umab were reported in the Phase 2 program. Alt hough TSLP suppressio n could 
theoreti cally  have unant icipated immune -related side effects impairing host defense against 
certain infect ions, there i s no clear preclinical or clinical evidence supporting such a role, and no 
safet y signals related to infect ions have been detected in the tezepelumab program.
The benefit/risk assessment for tezepelumab in severe asthma based on the development through 
Phase 2 i s favorable. The future benefit / risk assessment will largely be defined by  resul ts from 
the Phase 3 program.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 25 (107 ) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426Approximately  210 subjects wi th severe asthma will enter the treatment period to receive 6 SC 
doses (Week 0, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, and Week 20) of tezepelumab.  The first 3 
doses of tezepelumab will be administered in the clinic, the next 2 doses will be administered at 
home, and the last dose at the clinic. Approximately 20 ado lescents aged ≥12 to <18 y ears will  
be included as subjects. 
As part of the informed consenting pr ocess, the APFS and AI Instructions For Use (IFU) and 
administration quest ionnaire (see Appendix I and Appendix J ) will be reviewed. Fo llowing a 2 -
week screening period, eligible subjects will receive 4 SC doses of tezepelumab 210 mg at the 
clinic (Week 0, Week 4, Week 8 and Week 20) and 2 SC doses of tezepelumab 210 mg at home 
(Week 12 and Week 16). At Week 0, the HCP will administer the study  drug. At Week 4, the 
subject or caregiver will have the option of administering the study  drug under HCP supervisio n 
to ensure they  understand the procedure and are capable of doing so. At Week 8, the subject or 
caregiver will have to perform the inject ion, again under HCP supervision. Subjects or subjects 
with caregivers who are unable or unwilling to administer invest igational product (IP) at Week 8 
(Visit 4) will be discont inued fro m the stud y.
At Week 12 and Week 16, tezepelumab will be self -administered by  the subject or administered 
by the caregiver at home on weekdays when the physician office or clinic is open. The subject or 
caregiver will be given the IFU to refer for home administratio ns. After each of these 
administrations, the subject will return for a scheduled on- site visi t within 48 hours. For 
adolescent subjects who will self -administer the IP, the caregiver or an adult must supervise IP 
administration.  For adult subjects who wil l self-administer the IP, an adult must be present for 
IP administration.  
The final dose of tezepelumab (Week 20) will be self- administered by the subject or 
administered by  the caregiver at the clinic under HCP supervisio n in order to evaluate 
administration technique.
When IP i s administered in the clinic at Week 0, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 20, the person 
administering the dose will fill out an administration questionnaire designed to indicate if the 
dose was successfully  administered. The si teis to subsequent ly return the used devices and 
completed questi onnaires to the Sponsor for evaluation.
When IP i s administered at home (Week 12 and Week 16), whether the subject is self -
administering, or the caregiver is administering to the subject, the person administering the dose 
will fill out an administration quest ionnaire designed to indicate whether the dose was 
successfully administered. Both the completed questionnaire and the used device are to be 
returned to the site during each of the on -site visits scheduled wit hin 48 hours of the ho me 
administration of IP (Week 12 and Week 16). The site is to subsequent ly return the used devices 
and co mpleted questionnaires to the Sponsor for evaluat ion. 
The same person must administer the IP at Weeks 4 (if administered by  subject/caregiver), 8, 12, 
16, and 20, whether it is the subject or caregiver. The caregiver must accompany the subject to 
all dosing visits after signing consent. Caregiver attendance to the EOT/IPD and Fo llow up visits 
is opti onal.

(see Secti on 6.5), subj ects shoul d be evaluated at the study  center when feasible. 
Scientific rationale for study design
This is a mult icenter, open -label trial designed to confi rm the su ccessful  use and gain relevant 
inform ation on the HCPs and subjects/caregivers use of the AI and APFS devices with 
tezepel umab both in the clinic and an at -home setting . The study  design provi des for HCP 
administration at Week 0, followed by HCP or option al subject/caregiver administration at Week 
4. Subj ect/caregiver administration will take place at Week 8 and Week 20 in the clinic and at 
Week 12 and Week 16 at home. The design and duration of the study  is intended to allow 
adequate time for HCP and sub ject/caregiver familiarit y with the devices, provide oversight by  
site staff while in the clinic, and establish suitabilit y of subject/caregiver use at home.
Justification for dose
A 210 m g Q4W dosing regimen was selected for the Phase 3 studies based on efficacy data and 
an exposure -response analysis fro m the Phase 2b Study  CD-RI-MEDI9929- 1146 using 
popul ation PK/PD methodology . The populati on PK m odel of tezepel umab was developed based 
on all available data fro m 5 Phase 1 studi es (Study 20070620, Study  20080390, Study  2010118, 
Study  D5180C00003, Study  D5180C00002), and 2 Phase 2 studies (Study  D5240C00001 and 
Study  CD-RI-MEDI9929- 1146). The exposure -response analysis was based on the Phase 2b 
Study  CD-RI-MEDI9929- 1146.
Analysis of data fro m the Phase 2b s tudy identified a stati stically significant exposure -response 
against the primary efficacy endpo int of AAER and the pharmacodynamic (PD) endpo int of 
FeNO. These relat ionships indicate that the dose of 70 mg Q4W is a sub -optimally effect ive dose 
and the dos e of 210 mg Q4W is optimally effect ive. In summary, characterizat ion of AAER data 
from Study  CD-RI-MEDI9929- 1146 indicate the 210 mg Q4W dose provides improved efficacy 
over the 70 mg Q4W dose, whereas the 280 mg Q2W dose did not further reduce AAER. 
Tezepel umab was well -tolerated at all doses and the safet y profile was well balanced between 
the tezepelumab and placebo groups with no evidence o f a dose rel ationship to TEAEs in the 
adult populati on.
This study  will use the same dose as the Phase 3 studies.

Screen failures
Screen failures are defined as subjects who signed the informed consent form to participate in the 
clinical study  but are not subsequent ly rando mized. A minimal set of screen failure informat ion 
is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure subjects to meet the Consolidated 
Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries 
from regulatory  authori ties. Minimal  information includes dem ography, screen failure details, 
eligibilit y criteria, and any serious adverse event (SAE). 
These subjects should have the reason for study  withdrawal  recorded as a ‘Screen Failure’ (i.e., 
subject does not meet the required inclusio n/exclusio n criteria) in the eCRF. This reason for 
study  withdrawal  is only  valid for screen failures, and not randomized subjects.
Re-screening is allowed only  once under the following circumstances:
Subjects with respiratory  infect ions requiring ant ibiotics or antiviral medicat ion within 14 days 
prior to Visi t 1 or during the screening/run -in pe riod may  be re-screened (exclusio n criterion 4) 
14 day s after recovery , (i.e., com pletion of the therapy ).
If the reason for screen failure was transient (including but not limited to study -supplied 
equipment failure, unforeseen personal events that mandate missed screening visit s), subjects 
may potentially be re -screened. These cases should be discussed with the AstraZeneca study  
physician and documented in the Invest igator Study  File (ISF).
Subjects who experience an asthma exacerbat ion during the screening/run -in period will be 
screen failed and may be re -screened after 14 day s of com plete resol ution of the asthma 
exacerbation, and when the subjects return to baseline, at Invest igator’s discretion. 
Any re -screened subject will be re -enrolled and reassigned their originally assigned enrolment 
number after signing a new Informed Consent Form (ICF), or assent form, and after all Visit 1 
assessments have been performed as listed in Table 1(with the except ion of testing for HIV1 and 
HIV2, hepatit is B and C, and FSH).
Re-screened subjects should be assigned the same subject number as for the initial screening. 
However, re -screening should be documented so that its effect on study results, if any, can be 
assessed.
Re-screening of a subject will be allowed only upon approval o f the AstraZeneca Study  
Physician.
STUDY TREATMENTS
Study  treatm ent is defined as any invest igational product(s) (including marketed product 
comparator and pl acebo) or m edical  device(s) intended to be administered to a study  parti cipant 
according to the study  protocol . Study  treatm ent in this study  refers to tezepelumab.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 35(107) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426resolved before use of the IP. Tezepelumab must be stored in a secure, environmentally 
controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labelled storage 
condi tions wi th access limited to the invest igator and authorized site staff. 
The IP must be kept in the original outer packaging and under condit ions specified on the label 
(between 2°C to 8°C [36°F to 46°F], protected from light).
Only subjects enrolled in the study  may receive and self -administer study  treatment. Only 
authori zed si te staff may  supply  or administer study  treatm ent. Only authorized caregivers may 
administer study  treatm ent to the specific subject they have consented t o provi de administration 
of IP. The Invest igator, inst itution, or the head of the medical inst itution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study  treatm ent accountabilit y, reconciliat ion, and record maintenance (i.e., 
recei pt, reconciliat ion, and final dis position records).
For at hom e administrati on, the subject will be responsible for refrigerat ing the product at home. 
Subjects can transport the IP in uncontrolled temperature condit ions but shoul d return i t to a 
refrigerator as soon as possible. The tempe rature is not m onitored duri ng storage by  the subject; 
standard refrigerat ion is sufficient to maintain appropriate temperatures while the IP is in the 
subject’s possessio n. The subject will be responsible for returning used APFS/AI devices and 
completed a dministration questi onnai res to the study  center.
In the fo llowing cases nei ther the center staff nor the subject or caregiver should use the affected 
IP and should immediately contact an AstraZeneca representative for further guidance:
Temperature excursion upon receipt or during storage at the study center
Dam aged ki t upon recei pt
Dam aged APFS/AI device
Dam aged IP shoul d be docum ented vi a IWRS (pl ease refer to IWRS manual for further details).
Dose Preparation
Prior to each IP administration at clinic site:
Invest igator/authorized delegate will assess injection site as per standards of medical care
For WOCBP, urine pregnancy test will be done; IP will be administered only when the 
resul t of the test is negat ive (see Sect ion8.2.1.1 )
Prior to each IP administration in at -home setting:
Invest igator/authorized delegate will perform visit reminder call within 48 hours prior 
scheduled IP administration. The conversat ion shoul d include only basic informat ion and 
serve as a reminder to the subject about the next scheduled visit to occur within 48 hours 
after hom e administrati on.
For WOCBP, urine pregnancy test will be done; IP will be administered only when the
resul t of the test is negat ive (see Sect ion8.2.1.1 )

Dose Administration
The administration of all study  drugs (including IPs) should be recorded in the appropria te 
sections of the Case Report Form (CRF). The IP will be administered at the study center for the 
first 3 doses, at home for the following 2 doses, and at the study  center for the last dose. 
The IP will be administered by the Invest igator/authorized dele gate/subject/caregiver as specified 
in Table 1. If subject is not willing or not able to self -administer (or caregiver is not willing/able 
to administer) at Visit 4, subject will be discont inued fro m the IP.
Each subject will receive tezepelumab 210 mg (one 1.91 mL inject ion) administered SC Q4W 
for 6 doses in the abdo men, thi gh, or upper arm by APFS or AI.
It is suggested that the site of inject ion of the IP be rotate d such that the subject receives IP at a 
different anatomical site each time. Suggested injection site rotation sequence is presented below 
(see Figure 2). In the case whe n rotati on of  the injecti on si te is not favourable for the subject 
and/or Invest igator, the reason should be recorded in the source documents. The inject ion site 
must be recorded in the source documents and the eCRF at each treatment visit.
If IP i s self -administered by the subject, the injection should be done in the abdo men or thigh; 
when the injection is performed by the healt h care professio nal (HCP) or caregiver the inject ion 
can be made in the abdo men, thigh or upper arm (upper arm reserved only for i njecti ons 
performed by  HCP or caregiver). The same person must administer the IP throughout the study , 
whether it i s the subject or caregiver. The caregiver administering study drug must accom pany  
the subject to all dosing visits after signing consent. Car egiver attendance to the EOT/IPD and 
Follow up visits is optional. For adolescent subjects who will self -administer the IP, the 
caregiver or an adult must supervise IP administration.  For adult subjects who will self -
administer the IP, an adult must be pr esent for IP administration.   
Further details on IP administration are provided in the Instruction for Use (IFU). Invest igational 
product administration must be carried out in line with the instructions provided.

At Visits 2 and 3 (Weeks 0 and 4), subjects should be observed by the HCP for a minimum o f 2 
hours after IP administration for the appearance of any acute drug reactions. For the remaining 
visits invo lving IP administration, subjects will be observed by the HCP (or adult if inject ion was 
done at home) for a minimum o f 1 hour after IP administration for the appearance of any such 
reacti on. If IP administrati on was performed at home, the subject should visit the study  center for 
the previously  scheduled center vi sit within 48 hours after IP administration.
If any o f the following occur, the Invest igator should reschedule the visit and the IP should not 
be administered until the rescheduled visit:
The subject received allergen immunotherapy injection on the same day as scheduled IP 
administration.
The subject has an intercurrent illness that, in the opinio n of the Invest igator, may 
compromise the safet y of the subject in the study  (e.g., vi ral illnesses)
The su bject is febrile ( ≥ 38°C; ≥ 100.4°F) within 72 hours prior to IP administration.
The subject and caregiver, if applicable, should be informed about these condit ions and reminded 
prior to at -home administration. In case of any doubts before at -home administ ration, subject 
shoul d contact study  center.
If the subject reports an injection site react ion, the Invest igator or qualified designee will
complete the AE eCRF page and an addit ional eCRF quest ions about the inject ion site reaction.

Methods for return of used APFS/AI devices
Study  sites will be shipped an appropriate number of Bio -bottles (hard pl astic, wide -mouth 
bottles approved for containing and shipping bio hazardous and/or sharps materials). Subjects 
who are given IP to administer at home will also be given one Bio -bottle for each of the two 
doses to be administered at home. The Bio- bottle will be given at the time the IP is provided to 
the subject.
Instructi on for Use (IFU) is provi ded wi th each IP ki t. Subjects will be instructed on how to 
properly package the used APFS/AI device in the Bio -bottleand return i t along wi th the 
completed administrati on questi onnai re to the clinic during next center visit.
The completed administration quest ionnaire and the Bio -bottle containing the used APFS/AI will 
be returned to the Sponsor by  the clinical site fo llowing the APFS/AI Return Working 
Instructi on docum ent provi ded to the study  sites. Authori zed si te staff parti cipating in the study  
will receive training prior to study start.
Reporting product complaints
Any defects wi th the IP m ust be reported immediately to the Site Monitor. All defects will be 
communicated to the Sponsor and invest igated further with the AstraZeneca Supply Chain 
Group.
During the invest igation of the product complaint, all IP must be stor ed at labelled condit ions 
2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F), separated from other IP kits, unless otherwise instructed.
Reporting defects
Product defects may be related to component, product, or packaging and labelling issues prior to

Single Use APFS/AI device malfunction
An AI m alfuncti on is when the AI device appears normal during verificat ion of shipment and 
then does not work during administration, e.g., the autoinjector activated prematurely, the 
autoinjecto r stalled or did not expel the full vo lume, needle guard safet y feature did not deplo y or 
remain locked, glass sy ringe breakage, needle bent or broke upon use. 
An APFS malfunct ion is when the APFS appeared normal during verificatio n of shipment and 
then does not work during administration, e.g., the safet y feature activated prematurely, part of 
the device (finger flange, plunger rod, etc.) came off or broke, needle shield could not be 
removed only partial dose administered, needle guard safet y feature did not activate, needle bent 
or broke upon use.
Device malfunct ions should be reported using the Device Malfunct ion Return Form and the 
Study  Moni tor shoul d be notified.
If a device malfunct ion is ident ified at the study  center:
Before IP administration has started, another IP kit (replacement) should be dispensed to 
perform IP administration;
After IP administration has started and subject has been administered unknown dose of 
IP, another IP kit must not be dispensed, and subject must not be administered wit h 
another IP kit. The AstraZeneca study  physician and study  monitor shoul d be notified.  
If a device malfunct ion occurs during ho me administration at Week 12 or Week 16, the subject 
or caregiver should contact the study  site immediately. If it i s determined that a replacement 
shoul d be issued based on the same guidance for device malfunct ion at study  center described 
above, the subject will return to the study site to obtain the replacement device. 
Site staff will be asked to send all devices back to the depot or l ocal sponsor com pany according 
to local procedures. Address and attention for malfunct ioning device is available in the Device 
Malfunct ion Return Instruction.
Measures to minimize randomization bias
The Investigator(s) will:
1.Obtain signed informed consent or assent fro m the potential subject, or their 
guardi an/legal representative, before any study  specific procedures are performed.
2.Assign the potential subject a unique enrolment number (which begins with an ‘E’) via 
the Interactive Web Re sponse System/Interactive Voice Response System (IWRS).
3.Determine subject eligibilit y. 
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 AstraZeneca
Tezepelumab -D5180C00011
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 40(107) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc00174264.Assign the eligible subject unique rando mizat ion code via the Interactive Web Response 
System  (IWRS).
5.Subjects will be allocated to receive tezepelumab 210 mg via a single -use APFS or AI 
subcutaneously (SC) in a 1:1 ratio and stratified. by age (adults/adolescents) and country. 
Randomization numbers will be grouped in blocks. If a subject withdraws fro m the study , 
then his/her enro lment/randomization code cannot be re used. Wit hdrawn subjects will not 
be replaced.
Specific information concerning the use of the IWRS will be provided in a separate manual.
Procedures for handling incorrectly enrolled or randomized subjects
Subjects who fail to meet the eligibilit y criteria shoul d not, under any  circumstances, be 
rando mized or receive study medication. There can be no except ions to this rule. Subjects who 
are enrolled, but subsequent ly found not to m eet all  the eligibilit y criteria must not be 
rando mized or init iated on trea tment and m ust be wi thdrawn from the study .
Where a subject does not meet all the eligibilit y criteri a but i s rando mized in error, or incorrectly 
started on treatment, the Invest igator should inform the AstraZeneca study physician 
immediately, and a discus sion shoul d occur between the AstraZeneca study  physician and the 
Invest igator regarding whether to continue or discontinue the subject from treatment. Study 
treatm ent m ust be di scont inued in all cases where continued treatment is deemed to pose a safet y 
risk to the subject. In those cases where cont inuat ion of the study  therapy  is judged not to present 
a concern related to safet y and disease management, the rationale for continuing study therapy 
must be clearly documented. Regardless of what is decided abo ut IP, all rando mized subjects 
shoul d remain in the study  and the subjects should continue to be fo llowed up in accordance with 
defined study  procedures.
Methods for assigning treatment groups
Randomization codes will be assigned strict ly sequent ially within each stratum as subjects 
beco me eligible for randomizat ion.
The rando mizat ion code will be assigned fro m a rando mizat ion list prepared by a co mputerized 
system  provi ded by  PAREXEL Informatics on behalf o f AZ (AZRand). All subjects will be 
stratified at randomizat ion by age (adul ts/adolescents) and country . 
Treatment compliance
Any change fro m the dosing schedule or dose discontinuat ions should be recorded in the eCRF.
The IP Storage Manager is responsible for managing the IP from receipt by  the study  site unt il 
the destructi on or return of all unused IP. The date and time o f all IP administrations, as well as 
any missed doses, should be recorded in the appropriate section of the eCRF.

Procedures for discontinuation of study treatment
Subjects are free to discontinue IP or withdraw from the study  at any  time without prejudice to 
further treatment. Discont inuing study treatment is not the same as study withdrawal. Procedures 
to fo llow for study  withdrawal  are detailed bel ow. If  the subject deci des to wi thdraw consent, 
then the reason for this must be recorded separately in the eCRF. 
A subject that decides to discont inue IP should always be asked about the reason(s) and the 
presence of a ny adverse events. The reason for discontinuing treatment and the date of last IP 
administration should be recorded in the eCRF. Subjects permanent ly discont inuing IP 
administration should be given locally available standard of care therapy, at the discret ion of the 
Invest igator. However, treatment with marketed or invest igational biologics i s not allowed unt il 
week 36 even if the subject has discontinued IP. Interaction studies between tezepelumab and 
other bi ologics indicated for the treatment of asthma h ave not been conducted. For addit ional 
inform ation regarding pharmacokinet ic and pharmacodynamic effects of tezepelumab reference 
shoul d be made to the Investigator brochure. 
All subjects who prematurely discontinue IP and who do not withdraw their consen t from the 
study , shoul d return to the study  centre and complete the procedures described in the Premature 
IP Di scontinuati on (IPD) vi sit after 4 weeks (± 3 days) and the procedures for the Follow -up 
visits after 10 weeks (± 3 days) and 16 weeks (± 3 days) of the last IP administration. The reason 
for prem ature di scont inuat ion of IP should be recorded in the eCRF. 
If a subject discont inues IP due to a study specific discontinuat ion criterion, thi s shoul d always 
be recorded as ‘Development of study specific discontinuat ion criteria’ on the Di sposi tion (DS) 
form in the eCRF. 
Lost to follow -up
A subject will be considered potentially lost to fo llow-up if he or she fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be con tacted by  the study  site.  
The fo llowing acti ons m ust be taken if a subject fails to return to the clinic for a required study  
visit:
oThe site must attempt to contact the subject and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule.
oBefore a subject is deemed lost to fo llow
-up, the Investigator or designee must make every  
effort to regain contact with the subject or next of kin by either repeated telephone calls, 
certified letter to the subject´s last known m ailing address or l ocal equivalent methods. 
These contact attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical record. 
oEfforts to reach the subject should cont inue until the end of the study. Should the subject 
be unreachable at the end of the study , the subject should be considered to be lost to

A subject i s considered lost to follow -up when any of the fo llowing attempts of contact are 
failed: 3 attempts of eit her phone calls, faxes or emails; having sent 1 registered letter/certified 
mail; or one unsuccessful effort to check the status of the subject using publicly available 
sources, if allowed by local regulat ions.
Withdrawal from the study
A subject may  withdraw f rom the study  (e.g. wi thdraw consent), at any  time (IP and 
assessments) at his/her own request, without prejudice to further treatment. 
A subject who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of 
any adverse events (A E).  The Invest igator will fo llow-up subjects as medically  indicated. A 
withdrawal  visit is essent ial to collect as much data as possible for the subject as per EOT visit 
described in the SoA, Section 1.1.
If the subject withdraws consent for disclosure of future informat ion, the sponsor may  retain and 
continue to use any  data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.
If a subject withdraws fro m the study , he/she m ay request destructi on of  any samples taken, and 
the Invest igator must document this in the site study records.  
If the subject only wit hdraws consent for the retentio n of blood samples for future exploratory
use (e.g. DNA, study  of markers of asthma, ident ifying potential new drug targets for asthma, or 
for assay development purposes), the subject will not be withdrawn fro m the study .
Withdrawal o f consent fro m the study  must be ascertained and documented by  the Invest igator 
and recorded in the eCRF as well as in the Informed Consent Form (ICF) or assent form.
Withdrawal due to recruitment completion
When the required number of subjects are randomized in the study , ongoing subjects in run -in 
will not be random ized and will be withdrawn from the study . The reason of the withdrawal 
shoul d be docum ented in the source notes and eCRF. As wit h screen failures, no further study  
related fo llow-up of  these subjects i s requi red.
Discontinuation or suspension of the whole study program
If AstraZeneca decides to prematurely terminate or suspend the study , the PI, and regulatory  
authori ties shoul d receive wri tten notificat ion of the reasons for the premature terminat ion or 
suspension. The PI will immediately notify the decis ion to the subjects and if relevant give 
appropriate medical treatment; take necessary measures and document these in the source notes .

STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES
Study  procedures and thei r timing are summarized in the Schedule of Act ivities (SoA) .
The Investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs). 
The Web Based Data Capture (WBDC) system will be used for data collect ion and query  
handling.  
The Investigator ensures the accuracy, completeness, legibilit y and timeliness of the data 
recorded and of the provisio n of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study 
Agreement.  The Invest igator will sign the completed eC RFs.  A copy  of the com pleted eCRFs 
will be archived at the study  site.
Immediate safet y concerns shoul d be discussed wit h the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or 
awareness to determine if the subject should continue or discont inue study treatment.
Adherence to the study  design requi rements, including those specified in the Schedule o f 
Activities (SoA) , is essent ial and requi red for study conduct.
All screening evaluat ions m ust be com pleted and reviewed to confirm that potential subjects 
meet all eligibilit y criteria.  The Investi gator will maintain a screening log to record details o f all 
subjects screened and to confirm eligibilit y or record reasons for screening failu re, as applicable.  
The amount of blood collected from each subject over the duration of the study (excluding 
optional blood sam ples and any extra assessments that may  be requi red) will be approximately 
84 mL and will not exceed 180 mL. Repeat or unschedu led samples may  be taken for safet y 
reasons or for technical issues with the samples .
Efficacy assessments 
The primary  endpoint of interest is the proportion of HCPs and subjects/caregivers who 
successfully administered tezepelumab wit h an APFS/AI at the clinic and at home. A successful 
administration is defined as an injection co mpleted based on a user -recorde d answer of “Yes” to 
all 5 questions in the APFS/AI Questionnaire (please see Appendix I and Appendix J ) and 
satisfactory  in vitro eval uation (visual test + funct ional evaluat ion) of the returned devices.
Assessment of returned APFS/AI device through in vitro evaluation
In addi tion to the Questi onnaire filled out and returned to the Sponsor with each administered 
dose, the used APFS/AI will be returned to the Sponsor for in vitro evaluat ion. The data 
collected in the vitro evaluat ion of the APFS/AI devices falls into 2 categories: 1) Visual 
inspection, and 2) Funct ional evaluat ion.
The visual  inspect ion will assess the returned devices for any visible damage or disassembly, full 
plunger travel  indicating a co mplete dose was expelled, and needle guard deplo yment. The 
funct ional evaluation will challenge the needle safety guard to assess whether i t depl oyed 
correctly  and cont inued to provide protection against accidental needle st ick injuri es. As

completed questi onnaire wi th an answer of “Yes” to all 5 quest ions in the quest ionnaire will 
constitute a successful administration. Any device defects reported during the in vitro evaluat ion 
will result in a full pr oduct com plaint invest igation. 
In the event that the answers to one or more of the questions on the questionnaire indicate that 
the user was unable to complete a successful administration, an evaluat ion will be performed on 
the returned device. The evalua tion will  take into account informat ion provi ded on the 
administration quest ionnaire. If the in vitro evaluatio n of the device shows no observable device 
defect, then the unsuccessful administration may  be cl assified as a use error and not a device 
malfunc tion (e.g. user removes AI or APFS fro m the inject ion site before the inject ion is 
complete). 
Assessment of Product Complaints
Please refer to Sections 6.2.4 through t o 6.2.6.
Assessment of historical asthma exacerbations
The list below defines what is acceptable documentation for historical exacerbat ions:
•Discharge summaries from a hospi tal, emergency room , or an urgent care facilit y indicat ing 
that a subject was hospitalized/treated with systemic steroids for an asthma exacerbat ion.
•Signed and dated notes from a referring physician, including information regarding diagnosis 
andtreatment of an exacerbat ion with systemic steroi ds.
•Evidence of prescripti ons f or sy stemic steroi ds used during an exacerbat ion.
•A docum ented conversat ion that i s recorded in a timely  manner between the 
Invest igator/nurse or nurse practit ioner and a subject who is already on an OCS act ion plan, 
detailing the diagnosis and treatment of an asthma exacerbation.
•A docum ented conversat ion between the treating/referral physician or nurse/nurse practit ioner 
certifying that a subject was treated for an exac erbati on wi th steroi ds at thei r clinic or under 
their supervisi on. The dates (month/year) of the exacerbat ions and verbal confirmation that 
appropriate prescript ions were provided is necessary . This opti on shoul d be used only  if 
reasonable attempts to proc ure subject records have been unsuccessful.
During the study , asthma exacerbations should be treated with oral or other sy stemic 
corticosteroi ds according to standard practice.

Important!
Subjects should wit hhold their usual maintenance therapies on the day(s) when lung function 
testing is being performed as below:
SABAs or SAMAs should be withheld at least 6 hours prior to scheduled spiro metry at 
site. 
Twice daily LABA or LAMA -containing therapies should be withheld for at least 12 
hours prior to scheduled spiro metry at si te.
Once daily LABA or LAMA -containing therapies should be withheld for at least 24 
hours prior to sche duled spi rometry at si te.
LTRA should be restricted for at least 24 hours prior to scheduled spiro metry at si te.
Twice daily theophylline should be wit hheld for at least 12 hours prior to scheduled 
spirometry at si te.
Once daily theophylline for at least 2 4 hours prior to scheduled spiro metry at si te. 
Note: If any  of the above restrictions are not met, the spiro metry assessment shoul d be 
rescheduled within the allowed visit window.
Time of day for scheduled centre visit spirometry
Spirometry testing shoul d be done according to the Schedule of Activit ies (SoA) . For adult 
subjects, spiro metry testi ng must be init iated in the morning between 6:00 AM an d 11:00 AM 
during the screening or re -screening period and at rando mizat ion visit s (Vi sit 2). Spi rometry 
testing can be init iated during the who le day for adolescent subjects.

If this is not comfortable for the subject, standing is permitted. The same posit ion shoul d be used 
by the patient for each forced expiry maneuver. The head must not be tilted during maneuvers 
and the thorax shoul d be able t o move freely; hence ti ght cl othing shoul d be l oosened. A nose -
clip shoul d be used for the maneuver. 
The forced expiratory  maneuvers (FEV 1and FVC) should start with a maximal inspirat ion and 
then followed by  a fast and forceful  expirat ion that should las t for at l east 6 seconds. It is 
important to encourage the subject to continue the expirat ion to be fast and forceful throughout 
the maneuver. Ensure that none of the fo llowing has occurred: coughing during the first second, 
glottis closure, or l eak or obs tructi on of the m outhpi ece (by  the tongue). 
Multiple forced expiratory  efforts (at l east 3, but no more than 8) will be performed for each 
centre spi rometry  sessi on and the 1 best effort (highest FEV 1) that meet the ATS/ERS (or local 
guidelines) acceptabilit y and reproducibilit y criteria will be recorded in the eCRF. The abso lute 
measurement (for FEV 1and FVC), and the percentage of predicted normal value will be 
recorded. The best effort values will be based on the one with highest FEV 1.
Post-BDspirometry and FEV 1 reversibility assessment 
All subjects m ust m eet inclusio n criteria 5 ei ther by  having docum ented histori cal reversibili ty or 
by demo nstrating reversibilit y either at Vi sit 1, opti onal Visit 1A, or Visi t 2. Even if documented 
histori cal reversibilit y is available, the post -BD spirometry  procedures must be performed at 
Visit 1 to categori ze subjects (establish baseline characterist ic) prior to randomizat ion. The 
docum ented histori cal reversibili ty must be recorded in the eCRF/spiro meter prior to

Bronchodilatation can be induced using albuterol (90 μg metered dose), salbutamo l (100 μg 
metered dose) or levalbuterol (45 μg metered dose) up to a maximum o f 4 inhalations. It is 
highly  recommended to use a spacer device for thi s procedure. The algorithm for reversibilit y 
testing is outlined in Figure 3.

Vital signs
Vital signs (e.g. pul se, bl ood pressure, respi ration rate and body  temperature) will be obtained in 
accordance with the Schedule o f Activities (SoA) . 
Vital signs will  be taken pri or to bl ood drawing, IP administration, and, if possible, usual asthma 
controller medicat ion. 
Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed in sitt ing position wi th a com pletely  
autom ated device. Manual techniques will be used only  if an autom ated device is not available.
Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be preceded by  at least 5 minutes of rest for the 
subject in a quiet setting without dist ractions (e.g. tel evision, cell  phones). 
Pulse rate will be obtained before blood pressure if the manual measuring technique is used.
Respiration rate will be obtained after subject has been rest ing for at least 5 minutes, by  count ing 
number of breaths (i .e., how m any times the chest rises) for one minute.
Body  temperature will be measured in degrees Celsius prior to IP administration, in accordance 
with local standards.
Electrocardiograms
A 12 -lead (or 15 -lead) ECG will be taken with the subject in the su pine posi tion and after the 
subject has rested for at least 5 minutes. The assessment should be performed prior to blood draw 
and spiro metry. Measurem ents will be performed on site -supplied equipment.
The Investigator or authorized delegate will be respons ible for the overall interpretation and 
determinat ion of the clinical significance of any potential ECG findings. In case of any 
discrepancy  between the Invest igator's interpretation and that provided by the ECG machine (if 
applicable), the Invest igator's interpretati on will  take precedence and shoul d be noted on the 
printout and recorded in the eCRF. A copy  of the ECG will be produced, qualit y checked and 
kept i n case of further need for re- evaluation. The resul ts of the ECG evaluation will be recorded 
in the eCRF.
Weight, Height and BMI
Weight and height will be measured in accordance with the SoA. The subject’s weight will be 
recorded in kilograms, and height will be recorded in cent imetres. Weight and height 
measurements will be performed in light clothi ng and with shoes off. BMI will be automat ically 
calculated in the eCRF.

Patient Reported Outcomes
Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ -6)
Patient reported outcomes using ACQ -6 will  be perform ed at the study  site wi th paper 
questionnaires. Subjects will be given a paper questionnaire and be asked to complete and return 
these in accordance to the schedule provided in the Schedule of Activit ies (SoA) . ACQ -6 shoul d 
be co mpleted as a first procedure during the visit. The Investigator/authorized delegate will 
check the questionnaires for complet ion to minimize missing data and record responses in the 
eCRF. 
The ACQ- 6 captures asthma symptoms (night -time waking, symptoms on waking, activit y 
limitation, shortness of breath, wheezing) and short -acting β2 -agonist use. Questions are 
weighted equally  and scored from 0 (totally  controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). The mean 
ACQ -6 score i s the m ean of the responses. Mean scores of ≤ 0.7 5 indicate well -controlled 
asthma, scores between 0.75 and ≤1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, and a score >1.5 
indicates uncontrolled asthma (Juniper et al 2006). Individual changes o f at least 0.5 are 
considered to be clinically meaningful, and a dec rease of at l east 0.5 i s the responder definit ion 
for ACQ -6.
Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity
Collection of samples and drug concentration
Serum  determinat ion of tezepelumab will be collected pre -dose according to the SoA (Section 
1.1).
Samples will  be collected, l abelled, stored, and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory  Manual . 
Samples for determination of tezepelumab concentration in serum will be analyzed by a 
designated third party  on behalf o f AstraZeneca using a validated bioanalyt ical method. Details 
of the analy tical method used will be described in a bioanalyt ical report.
Full details of the analy tical method used will be described in a separate Bioanalyt ical Validati on 
Report.
Collection of samples to measure the presence of ADAs
The presence of ADA will be assessed in serum samples according to the SoA (Section 1.1).
Samples will  be measured for the presence of ADAs for tezepelumab using validated assays. 
Tiered analysis will be performed to include screening, confirmatory , and ti ter assay  
components, and posi tive-negative cut poi nts stati stically  determined from  drug -naïve samples 
will be emplo yed. Samples confirmed posit ive for ADA will be archived for possible testing for 
neutralizing antibodies (nAb).

Storage and destruction of pharmacokinetic/ADA samples
Any residual back- up PK and ADA samples may be used for fu ture expl oratory  biomarker 
research and retained for future use at AstraZeneca or designee for a maximum of 15 years 
following Last Subject’s Last Visit.
Pharmacokinet ic and ADA samples may be disposed of or destroyed and anonymized by 
pooling.  Addit ionalanalyses may  be conducted on the anonymized, pooled pharmacokinet ic 
samples to further evaluate and validate the analyt ical method.  Any results fro m such analyses 
may be reported separately fro m the Clinical Study Report (CSR).
Pharmacodynamics
Pharmacod ynamic parameters are not evaluated in this study.
Genetics
Optional exploratory genetic sample
The blood sample for DNA iso lation will  be collected from subjects who have consented to 
participate in the genet ic analysis co mponent of the study. Participati on is opti onal. Subjects who 
do not wi sh to parti cipate in the genet ic research may st ill part icipate in the study .
In the event of DNA extraction failure, a replacement genet ic blood sample may be requested 
from the subject. Si gned informed consent will b e requi red to obtain a replacement sample 
unless it was included in the original consent.
See Appendix D for Inform ationregarding genet ic research. Details on processe s for collect ion 
and shipment and destruction of these samples can be found in Appendix D or in the separate 
Laboratory  Manual provi ded to the si tes.
The results of th e analyses will be reported separately fro m the CSR in a scientific report or 
publicat ion.
Storage and destruction of genetic samples
The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genet ic analysis are important to 
maintain subject confide ntiality. Sam ples may be stored for a maximum of 15 y ears or as per 
local regulati ons f rom the date of the Last Subject’s Last Visit, after which they  will be 
destroy ed. DNA is a finite resource that may be used up during analyses. The results of any 
furth er analyses will be reported either in the CSR itself or as an addendum, or separately in a 
scientific report or publicat ion.
No personal details identifying the individual will be available to AstraZeneca or designated 
organi zations working wit h the DNA.

Collection of adverse events
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff invo lved in the study  are familiar with 
the content of this sect ion.
The definit ions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix B .
AEs will be reported by  the subject (or, when appropriate, by  a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
subject's legally  authori zed representative). 
The Investigator and any designees are responsib le for detecting, document ing, and recording 
events that meet the definit ion of an AE or SAE. For informat ion on how to fo llow-up AEs see 
Secti on 8.7.3 . 
Method of det ecting AEs and SAEs
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs.  Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal quest ioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about 
AEoccurrences.  
Time period and frequency for collecting AE and SAE information 
Adverse Events, including SAEs will be co llected fro m time o f signature of informed consent 
form throughout the treatment period and the follo w-up peri ods. 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated 
in Appendix B . The Invest igator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 
hours of i t being available.
Invest igators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE in former study subjects. However, if 
the Invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any t ime after a subject’s last visit and 
he/she cons iders the event to be reasonably related to the Study treatment or study participat ion, 
the Invest igator must notify the sponsor.
The m ethod of recording, evaluat ing, and assessing causalit y of AE and SAE and the procedures 
for com pleting and transmitt ing SAE reports are provided in Appendix B . 
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
After the init ial AE/SAE report, the Invest igator is required to proactively fo llow each subject at 
subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs/non -serious AEs/AEs of special  interest will be fo llowed 
until reso lution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up 
Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’ s last AE assessment or other assessment/visit as 
appropriate in the study  are f ollowed up by the Investigator for as long as medically indicated, 
but wi thout f urther recording in the CRF.  AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional 
inform ation for any  subject wi th ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study , if judged 
necessary .

Adverse event data collection
The fo llowing variables will be collected for each AE;
o AE (verbat im)
o The date when the AE started and stopped
o Whether the AE is serious or n ot
o Invest igator causalit y rating against the IP(s) (y es or no)
o Action taken with regard to IP(s)
o Select the appropri ate as requi red: AE caused subject’s withdrawal from 
study  (yes or no)
o Outcom e.
In addi tion, the fo llowing vari ables will be collected for SAEs:
o Date AE met criteria for serious AE
o Date Invest igator became aware of serious AE
o Reason of AE is being serious 
o Date of hospitalization
o Date of di scharge
o Probable cause of death
o Date of death
o Autopsy  performed
o Causalit y assessment in relat ion to Study  procedure(s)
o Causalit y assessment to other medicat ion'
Causality collection
The Investigator will assess causal relat ionship between IP and each Adverse Event, and answer 
‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possi bility that the event 
may have been caused by the IP?’

Tezepelumab -D5180C00011
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 59(107) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426For SAEs, causal relat ionship will also be assessed for other medicat ion and study  procedures.  
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study  procedure the causal relationship is 
implied a s ‘yes’.
A gui de to the interpretati on of  the causalit y quest ion is found in Appendix B to the Clinical 
Study  Protocol .
Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by  the subject or reported in response to the open question fro m 
the study  site staff : Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last 
asked? or reveal ed by  observati on will  be collected and recorded in th e CRF. When co llecting 
AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and 
symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not 
generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosi s and each sign or symptom will be recorded 
separately
Adverse events based on examinations and tests
The results from the Clinical Study  Protocol  mandated l aboratory  tests and vi tal signs will be 
summarized in the CSR. Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol -mandated l aboratory  
values/vital signs should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any o f the SAE criteria 
or are the reason for discontinuat ion of treatment with the IP.
If deteri oration in a laboratory  value/vi tal sign/ECG is as sociated wi th clinical  signs and 
symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory 
resul t/vital sign will  be considered as addi tional inform ation. Wherever possible the reporting 
Invest igator uses the clinical, rather th an the l aboratory  term  (e.g. anemia versus low hemoglo bin 
value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non -
mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal me dical  finding at a physical examinat ion as 
compared wi th the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally  related to 
the disease under study . 
Disease progression
Asthma signs or symptoms such as wheeze, cough, chest tightness, breathlessness, etc. will be 
recorded as AEs only when:
The sign or symptom is serious according to definition, see Appendix B
The pati ent di scont inues the study due to the sign or symptom.
The sign or symptom is new to the patient or is not consistent with the patient's pre -exist ing 
asthma history  as judged by the Investi gator. 
Asthma exacerbations should be recorded as an AE or SAE in the eCRF only if it fulfils any of 
the above criteria.

Adverse Events of Special Interest
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is an event of scient ific and medical interest towards 
improving the understanding of the IP. An AESI may be serious or non -serious. For this study, 
AESIs include:
o Anaphylactic reactions 
o Immune com plex disease (Ty pe III hy persensi tivity reacti ons)
o Malignancy
o Helmint h infect ions 
o Severe infect ions which are defined as:
SAEs or 
Requi ring treatm ent wi th antiviral medicat ions, intravenous ant ibiotics 
or medicat ions for helmint h parasit ic infect ion or
Requi ring a perm anent discont inuat ion of study  drug
o Inject ion site reactions 
o Opportuni stic infect ions
o Guillain Barre Syndrome
Hy’s law
Cases where a subject shows elevat ion in liver bio chemistry  may require further evaluat ion and 
occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3xULN together with total bilirubin ≥ 2xULN may n eed to be 
reported as SAEs.  Please refer to Appendix E for further instruction on cases of increases in 
liver biochemistry  and evaluat ion of Hy’s Law.
Safety report ing and medical management
Reporting of serious adverse events
All SAEs must be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the IP, or to the study 
procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF.
If any SAE occurs during the study , then In vestigators or other site personnel must inform the 
appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one day  e.g., immediately but no later than 24 
hours of when he or she beco mes aware of it.

necessary  informat ion is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safet y data entry  site wi thin 1 
calendar day  of initial receipt for fatal and life -threatening events and within 5 calendar days of 
initial receipt for all other S AEs.
For fatal  or life -threatening adverse events where important or relevant informat ion is missing, 
active fo llow-up will be undertaken immediately . Investi gators or other si te personnel will 
inform  AstraZeneca representatives o f any fo llow-up informat ion on a previously reported SAE 
within one calendar day  i.e., immediately but no l ater than 24 hours of when he or she beco mes 
aware of i t.
Once the Invest igators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC system, an 
autom ated em ail alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative(s).
If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or other study site staff must report a 
SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative(s) by telephone.
The AstraZeneca representative(s ) will  advise the Investi gator/study  site staff how to proceed.  
The reference document for definit ion of expectedness/listedness is the Investigator’s Brochure 
for the AstraZeneca IP.
For further guidance on the definit ion of a SAE, see Appendix B .
Pregnancy
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to AstraZeneca except if the 
pregnancy is discovered before the study  subject has received any study  drug. If a pregnancy  is 
reported, the Invest igator should inform the sponsor within 24 hours o f learning o f the 
pregnancy. 
Abnorm al pregnancy outcom es (e.g. spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, ectopi c pregnancy ) are considered SAEs.
Maternal exposure
If a subject beco mes pregnant during the course of the study, IP should be discont inued 
immediately.
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an adverse event unless there is a suspicio n that the IP under 
study  may have interfered wi th the effect iveness of a contraceptive medicat ion.  Congenital 
abnorm alities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as 
SAEs.  El ective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.  The outcome of 
all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth 
or congenital abnormalit y) shoul d be f ollowed up and documented even if the subject was 
discontinued fro m the study .

must inform the appropriate AstraZeneca repr esentatives within 1 day i.e., immediately but no 
later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it .
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all relevant 
inform ation is provided to the AstraZeneca Patien t Safet y data entry  site wi thin 1 or 5 cal endar 
days for SAEs (see Section 8.8.1 ) and wi thin 30 days for all other pregnancies.
The same timelines apply when outcome in formation is available.
The PREGREP module in the CRF is used to report the pregnancy and the paper -based 
pregnancy outcome report is used to report the outcome of the pregnancy. 
Paternal exposure 
Pregnancy of the subject’s partners will not be considere d an AE.  However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elect ive terminat ion, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or 
congenital abnormalit y) shoul d be fo llowed up and docum ented for conceptions occurring fro m 
the date of the first administ ration of  IP until 16 weeks (5 half -lives) after the last administration 
of IP.
Overdose
A dose in excess of 280 mg administered within a 2 -week period is considered an overdose.
There i s currently no specific treatment in the event of overdose of IP and p ossible symptoms of 
an overdose are not established.
An overdose wi th associ ated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the relevant AE 
modules in the CRF and on the Overdose CRF mo dule.
An overdose wi thout associ ated symptom s is only  reported on the Overdose CRF module.
If an overdose on an AstraZeneca study  drug occurs in the course of the study , then the 
Invest igator or other site personnel inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives immediately,
or no later than 24 hours of when he or she be comes aware of i t.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all relevant 
inform ation is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safet y data entry  site.
For overdoses associated with a SAE, the standard reporting t imelines apply , see Sect ion 8.8.3 .  
For other overdoses, reporting must occur within 30 day s.
Medication error
If a medicat ion error occurs in the course of the study , then the Invest igator or other site 
personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day i.e., immediately but 
no later than 24 hours of when he or she beco mes aware of it.

with the m edicat ion error (see Section 8.8.4 ) and within 30 days for all other medication errors.
The definit ion of a Medicat ion Error can b e found in Appendix B 8.
Management of IP -related reactions
Prior to the first 2 administrations, which will be performed at the study  center, subj ects will 
have had a pre -assessment (i.e., vital signs) prior to IP administration, and will be observed after 
IP administration for a minimum of 2 hours for the appeara nce of any acute drug reactions. 
Study  site personnel  shoul d inform  subjects that, for subsequent administrations, they  shoul d be 
observed for at least 1 hour after IP administration for the appearance of any such react ions. As 
with any medicat ion, in case of anaphylact ic reaction at home, the subject or caregiver should 
immediately contact an emergency care unit or emergency transportation as per standard medical 
practi ce, and contact study  site personnel . 
Appropriate drugs, such as epinephrine, H1 and H 2 antihistamines, and corticosteroids, as well 
as medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions, must be immediately available when 
IP is being administered at the study  site.  Study  site personnel must be trained to recognize and 
treat anaphylaxis ( Lieberman et al. 2010). Details on anaphylaxis management are provided in 
Appendix G.
Anaphylaxis will be defined as a serious reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death 
(Sampson et al . 2006 ). Anaphylaxis t ypically manifests as 1 of 3 clinical scenarios:
1. The acute onset of a reaction (minutes to hours) with invo lvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue or both and at least one of the fo llowing: a) respiratory  com promise; or b) 
reduced blood pressure or symptom s of end -organ dy sfunct ion.
2. Two or more of the fo llowing that occur rapidly  after exposure: involvement of the 
skin/mucosal t issue, respiratory  com promise, reduced blood pressure or associated 
symptoms and/or persistent gastrointest inal symptom s.
3. Reduced blood pressure after exposure.
If an anaphylact ic react ion occurs, a blood sample will be drawn fro m the subject as soon as 
possible after the event, at 60 minutes ± 30 minutes after the event, and at discharge for analysis 
of serum  tryptase. The sample will be tested at the local lab or central lab where applicable. In 
addition, in order to hel p understand the potential drug -relatedness o f any acute reaction, a blood 
sample should be drawn during the event for ADA testing (if not already scheduled for this 
visit).

STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS 
Statistical hypotheses
No stati stical hypotheses will be tested in this study .
Sample size determination 
A total o f 210 subjects will be rando mized, out of which 105 will receive a dose of tezepelumab 
210 mg via APFS injection and 105 will receive the same dose administered via AI. 
Approximately  20 adol escents aged ≥12 to <18 years will be included. It is ant icipated that 
approximately  5% of  subjects will drop out and thus it is estimated that approximately 10 0 
subjects will co mplete the study  for each device.
Populations for analyses
For purposes of analysis, the following populat ions are defined: 
Population Description
Enrolled All subjects who sign the ICF
Full Analysis Set All subjects rando mized to study treatment who received or 
attem pted to receive at least one dose of IP, irrespective of their 
protocol  adherence and cont inued participat ion in the study

Set All subjects in the full analysis set who received tezepelumab 
and fro m whom PK blood sam ples are assumed not to be 
affected by  factors such as protocol deviat ions (e.g. disallowed 
medicat ion or incorrect study  medicat ion received).
Safety Analysis Set All subjects who received tezepelumab
Statistical analyses
Analyses will be performed by AstraZeneca or its representatives. A comprehensive statist ical 
analysis plan (SAP) will be developed prior to first patient enter treatment period, and any 
subsequent amendments will be documented, with final amendments (if a ny) finalized before 
database lock. This sect ion is a summary o f the planned stati stical analyses of the primary  and 
secondary  endpoints. Any  deviat ions from this plan will be reported in the clinical study  report.
All analyses will be descriptive only an d no form al stati stical testing will be performed.
Efficacy analyses
The efficacy endpo ints will be summarized using the Full Analysis Set. To assess successful 
administration, functionalit y, and performance o f the tezepelumab 210 mg inject ion via APFS 
andAI both in clinic and at home, 3 outcomes will be measured for APFS and AI devices 
separately: 
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 AstraZeneca
Tezepelumab -D5180C00011
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 65(107) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426Primary endpo int: Proportion of HCPs and subjects/caregivers who successfully 
administer tezepelumab in clinic or at home. Successful administration is defined in 
Secti on8.1.The deno minator will be the number of subjects who received or attempted 
to receive an administration at each visit.
Secondary  endpoint: Proporti on of used/returned devices that pass funct ional tests and 
visual inspection and show no evidence of malfunction. The deno minator will be the 
number of used and returned devices at each visit. 
Secondary  endpoint: Proporti on of  devices that have been report ed as malfunctioning 
(Product Complaints). The deno minator will be the number of used and returned devices 
at each visit.
For each of these endpoints, proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be presented by 
visit for AI and APFS separately. For the primary endpo int specifically, the HCP and the 
subject/caregivers will be assessed separately, which is achieved through the by -visit 
presentations described above.  
In addi tion, summaries combining visits may  also be presented to assess at home use separately  
from clinic use as well as HCP use separately  from subject/caregiver use. The details will be 
presented in the SAP.
For the addi tional secondary  endpoint change from baseline in mean ACQ -6 score, the data will 
be summarized descript ively. Based on ACQ -6, subjects will  also be categorized according to 
their asthma control  and responder status. Number and percentage of subjects in these categories 
will be presented. 
Safety analyses
Safety variables will be summarized using Safety  Analysis Set. Adverse events will be coded 
using the Medical Dict ionary for Regul atory  Activit ies (MedDRA) versio n in force at database 
lock. The definit ion of on -treatm ent and post -treatment for adverse event analyses will be given 
in the SAP.
The number and percentag e of subjects wi th on-treatm ent and post -treatm ent adverse events will
be tabulated separately by  preferred term and system organ class. An event that occurred one or
more times during a period will contribute 1 observat ion to the numerator of the proporti on. The
deno minator of the proportion will co mprise all subjects in the safety populat ion. On -treatm ent
adverse events will also be summarized by intensit y/severit y and separately , by 
causalit y/relatedness (as determined by the investigator). Should a subj ect report the same 
preferred term/system organ class within mult iple intensit y/severi ty or causali ty/relatedness
categori es, the subject ’s worst occurrence (most severe/most related) will be tabulated. Serious
AEs, AEs leading to discont inuat ion from IP, and commo nly occurring AEs will  be summarized
in a generally similar manner. Adverse events, SAEs, AEs leading to death, and AEs leading to
study  discont inuat ion will be summarized for each treatment group as applicable.
AEs of Special Interest (AESIs) wi ll also be summarized descript ively by treatm ent group.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 66(107) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426Laboratory  data will be summarized by present ing shift tables using normal ranges (baseline to
most extrem e post -baseline value) and by presenting summary statist ics of observed and change 
from basel ine values (means, medians, quartiles, ranges). The incidence of clinically notable 
laboratory  abnorm alities will be summarized.
Other analyses 
PK vari ables will be summarized using Pharmacokinet ics Analysis Set. Tezepelumab serum 
concentrations will be summarized using descript ive statist ics at each visit for each device 
separately . No f ormal  PK data analysis is planned due to sparse sampling and variat ions of 
sampling t ime following tezepel umab self -administrati ons. Observed serum concentrations of 
tezepelumab for each individual will be listed by visit to confirm tezepelumab administration. 
The prevalence and incidence o f anti
-drug ant ibodies (ADA) will be reported for each device 
using the Safet y Analysis Set. ADA data will be summarized using descri ptive statist ics at each 
visit by  device. Sam ples confirmed posi tive for ADA will be archived for possible testing for 
neutralizing ant ibodies (nAb). The potential effects of ADA status and ADA t iter on 
pharmacokinet ics of tezepel umab will be evaluated. Th e potential associat ion of immunogenicit y 
with efficacy and safet y may be evaluated.
Interim analyses 
No interim analyses are planned in this trial.
Data safety monitoring board (DSMB)
A data safet y monitoring board will not be utilized for this study .

Adverse event definitions and additiona l safety information
B 1 Definition of adverse events
An adverse event is the development of any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical 
study  subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily  have a causal  
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavou rable and unintended sign 
(e.g.  an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or disease 
temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to 
the medicinal product.  
The term AE is u sed to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a deterioration 
of a pre -exist ing medical occurrence.  An AE may occur at any  time, including run -in or washout 
periods, even if no Study  treatm ent has been administered.
B 2 Definitions of seriou s adverse event
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., run -in, treatment, 
washout, follow -up), that fulfils one or more of the fo llowing cri teria:
Results in death
Is immediately life -threatening
Requi res in -subject hospi t
alisation or prolongat ion of exist ing hospitalisat ion 
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapaci ty.  
Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defect?
Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the subject or may require medical 
treatm ent to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
B 3 Life threatening
‘Life -threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AEas it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the subject ’s 
death.  ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AEoccurred in a more severe form it might 
have caused death (e.g., hepatit is that resolved without hepat ic failure).
B 4 Hospitalisation
Outpati ent treatm ent in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE , although the reasons for 
it may be (e.g., bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema).  Hospital admissio ns and/or surgical 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the subject
was enrolled in t he study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way  during the study .
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 AstraZeneca
Tezepelumab -D5180C00011
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 76 (107 ) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426B 5 Important medical event or medical treatment
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important m edical events may  not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, hospi talisat ion, disabili ty or incapaci ty but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical treatment to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of serious.  These 
should usually be considered as serious.
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgement must be used. Examples of such events are:
Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hyd rocortisone 
treatm ent
Hepatotoxicit y caused by paracetamo l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment 
with N-acetylcysteine
Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
Blood dy scrasias (e.g., neutropenia or anaemia requi ring bl ood transfusi on, etc.) or 
convulsio ns that do not result in hospitalisat ion
Development of drug dependency or drug abuse
B 6 Intensity rating scale:
1. mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)
2. moderate (di scomf ort sufficient to cause inter ference with normal act ivities)
3. severe (incapacitat ing, with inabilit y to perform norm al activities)
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severit y is a measure of intensit y 
whereas seriousness is defined by  the cri teria in Appendix B .  An AE of severe intensit y need not 
necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be 
considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Appendix B . On 
the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disabilit y may be considered a 
mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Appendix B .
B 7 A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question
When making an assessment of causalit y consi der the foll owing f actors when deciding if there is 
a ‘reasonable possibilit y’that an AE m ay have been caused by  the drug.
Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the subject actually received the suspect 
drug?  Di d the AE occur i n a reasonable temporal  relationship to the administration of the 
suspect drug?
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 AstraZeneca
Tezepelumab -D5180C00011
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 77 (107 ) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426Consistency wit h known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same 
pharmaco logical class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical 
properties?
De-challenge experience.  Di d the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the 
dose of the suspect drug?
No al ternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably  explained by another aetio logy such 
as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
Re-challenge experi ence.  Di d the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced 
after having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally  recommend or support a re-
challenge .
Laboratory  tests.  A specific laboratory  invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship .
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
Is this a recogni zedfeature of overdose of the drug?
Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit yof ‘related’ is m ade if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’of a causal relationship for the individual case.  The expressio n 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of acausal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including enough information 
to make an informed judgment.  With limited or insufficient information in the case, i t is likely  
that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to l ack of effect 
shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.
B 8 Medication Error
For the purpos es of this clinical study  a medicat ion error is an unintended failure or mistake in 
the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study  drug that ei ther causes harm to the participant or 
has the potential to cause harm to the participant.  
A medicat ion error i s not l ack of efficacy  of the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study  site staff or parti cipant.
Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error.

temperature 
Wrong participant received the medicat ion (excluding IWRS errors)
Wrong drug administered to participant (excluding IWRS errors)
Examples of events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
Errors related to or resulting fro m IWRS - including those which lead to one of the above 
listed events that would otherwise have been a medicat ion error 
Parti cipant acci dentally  missed drug d ose(s) e.g.  forgot to take medication
Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
Parti cipant f ailed to return unused medicat ion or empt y packaging
Errors related to background and rescue medicat ion, or standard of care medicat ion in 
open l abel studi es, even if an AZ product 
Medicat ion errors are not regarded as AEs, but AEs may occur as a consequence of the 
medicat ion error.

Handling of Human Biological Samples
C 1 Chain of custody of biological samples
A full chain o f custody  is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle.
The Principal Invest igator keeps full traceabilit y of collected bio logical samples from  the 
subjects while in storage at the centre until shipment or disposal (where appropriate).
The sample receiver keeps full traceabilit y of the sam ples while in storage and during use unt il 
used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps documentation of receipt of arrival.
AstraZeneca will keep oversight of the entire life cycle through internal procedures, monitoring 
of study  sites, audi ting or process checks, and contractual requirements of external laboratory 
provi ders
Samples retained for further use will be stored in the AZ -assigned bi obanks and will be 
registered by  the AstraZeneca Bio bank Team during the ent ire life cycle.
If required, AstraZeneca will ensure that remaining bio logical samples are returned to the site 
according to local regulations or at the end of the retention period, whichever is the sooner.
C 2 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for donated biological 
samples 
If a subject withdraws consent to the use of donated bio logical samples, the sam ples will  be 
disposed of/destroy ed, and the acti on documented.  If samples are already  analyzed ,AstraZeneca 
is not obliged to destroy  the resul ts of this research.
Ascollect ion of the bio logical sample(s) i s an integral  part of the study , then the subject i s 
withdrawn from further study  parti cipat ion.
The Investigator:
Ensures subjects’ wit hdrawal o f informed consent to the use of donated 
samples is notified immediately to AstraZeneca
Ensures that bio logical samples from that subject, if stored at the study  site, 
are immediately ident ified, disposed of /destroyed, and the action documented
Ensures the organizat ion(s) ho lding the samples is/are informed about t he 
withdrawn consent immediately and that samples are disposed of/destroy ed, 
the acti on docum ented, and the si gned docum ent returned to the study  site
Ensures that the subject and AstraZeneca are informed about the sample 
disposal .

LABELLING AND SHIPMENT OF BIOHAZARD SAMPLES
International Airline Transportation Associat ion (IATA) classifies bio hazardous agents into 3 
categori es(https://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dgr/Documents/infectious -substance -
classification -DGR56- en.pdf ). For transport purposes the classificat ion of infect ious substances 
according to risk groups was removed fro m the Dangerous Goods Regu lations in the 46th edition 
(2005). Infect ious substances are now classified either as Category  A, Category B or Exem pt. 
There i s no di rect relati onship between Risk Groups and Categories A and B.
Category A Infectious Substances are infect ious substances in a form that, when exposure to it 
occurs, is capable of causing permanent disabilit y, life- threatening or fatal  disease in otherwi se 
healt hy humans or animals. Category  A pathogens are (e.g. Ebola, Lassa fever virus):
are to be packed and shipped in accordance wit h IATA Instruction 602.
Category B Infectious Substances are infect ious Substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusio n in Category  A. Category  B pathogens are (e.g. Hepatit is A, B, C, D, and E viruses, 
Hum an immunodeficiency virus ty pes 1 and 2). They  are assigned the following UN number and 
proper shipping name:
UN 3373 –Biological Substance, Category  B
are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650
Exempt -all other materials wit h minimal risk of containing pathogens
Clini cal tri al samples will fall into Category  B or exempt under IATA regulations
Clinical trial samples will routinely be packed and transported at ambient
temperature in IATA 650 compliant packaging 
(https://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dgr/Documents/DGR -60-EN-PI650.pdf )
Biological samples transported in dry ice require additional dangerous goods

Genetics
D 1 Use/analysis of DNA
Genet ic variat ion may impact a subject’s response to therapy , susceptibilit y to, and severi ty and 
progression of disease.  Variable response to therapy  may be due to geneti c determinants that 
impact drug absorption, distribut ion, metabo lism, and excret ion; mechanism  of action of the 
drug; di sease et io
logy; and/or mo lecular subt ype of the disease being treated.  Therefore, where 
local regulati ons and IRB/IEC allow, blood samples will be co llected for DNA an alysis fro m 
consent ing subjects.
AstraZeneca intends to collect and store DNA for genet ic research to explore how genetic 
variat ions may affect clinical parameters, risk and prognosis o f diseases, and the response to 
medicat ions.  Genetic research may lead to better understanding of diseases, better diagnosis of 
diseases or other improvements in healt h care and to the discovery  of new diagnosti cs, 
treatm ents or m edicat ions.  
In addi tion, collect ion of DNA samples from populat ions wit h well described clinic al 
characterist ics may lead to improvements in the design and interpretation of clinical trials and, 
possibly , to geneti cally guided treatment strategies.
Genet ic research may consist of the analysis o f the structure of the subject ´s DNA, i.e. the entire 
genome. 
The results of genet ic analyses may be reported in the clinical study report (CSR) or in a separate 
study  summary .
The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to 
protect confident iality.
The samples will be retained while research on tezepelumab cont inues but no longer than 15
years or other period as per local requirements.
D 2 Genetic research plan and procedures
Selection of genetic research population
Study selection record
All subjects will be asked to participate in this genetic research.  Participat ion is vo luntary and if 
subject declines to participate there will be no penalt y or loss of benefit.  The subject will not be 
excluded fro m any aspect of the m ain study .
Inclusion criteria
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 AstraZeneca
Tezepelumab -D5180C00011
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 83 (107 ) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426For inclusio n in this genet ic research, subjects must fulfil all o f the inclusio n criteria 
described in the main body  of the Clinical Study  Protocol  and: Provide informed consent 
for the genet ic sampling and analyses.
Exclusion criteria
Exclusio n from this genet ic research may be for any  of the excl usion criteria specified in the 
main study  or any  of the fo llowing:
Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant
Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusio n in 120 days of genetic sample collection
Withdrawal of consent for genet ic research:  
Subjects m ay withdraw from  this genetic research at any  time, independent of any decisio n 
concerning participat ion in other aspects of the main study .  Vol untary  withdrawal will  not 
prejudice further treatment.  Procedures for withdrawal are outlined in Sect ion 7.3of the m ain 
Clinical Study  Protocol .
Collection of samples for genetic research
Blood sam ples f or geneti c research will be obtained from su bjects at randomisation visit and 
only after the consent is signed. Although DNA is stable, early  sample collect ion is preferred to 
avoid int roducing bias through excluding subjects who may  withdraw due to an adverse event 
(AE), such subjects would be impo rtant to include in any  genet ic analysis. If for any reason the 
sample i s not drawn at Randomisat ion Visit, i t may be taken at any  visit unt il the last study visit. 
Only one sample should be co llected per subject for genetics during the study. Samples will be 
collected, labelled, stored, and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory  Manual.
Coding and storage of DNA samples
The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genet ic analysis are important to 
maintain subject confident iality.  Sample s will be stored for a maximum o f 15years, from the 
date of l ast subject l ast visit, after which they  will be destroy ed.  DNA is a finite resource that is 
used up during analyses.  Samples will be stored and used until no further analyses are possible 
or the maximum  storage time has been reached.
An addit ional second code will be assigned to the blood either before or at the time of DNA 
extracti on repl acing the information on the sample tube.  Thereafter, the sample will be 
ident ifiable only by the second, unique number.  This number is used to ident ify the sample and 
corresponding data at the AstraZeneca genet ics laboratories, or at the designated organization.  
No personal details identifying the individual will be available to any person (AstraZeneca 
employee or designated organizat ions working with the DNA).
The link between the subject enrolment/randomization code and the second number will be 
maintained and stored in a secure environment, with restricted access at AstraZeneca or

analysis, facilitate correlat ion of genoty pic resul ts wi th clinical  data, all ow regulatory  audi t, and 
permit tracing of samples for destruction in the case of withdrawal o f consent.
Ethical and regulatory requirements
The principles for ethical and regulatory  requi rements for the study , incl uding this genet ics 
research component, are outlined in this appendix.
Informed consent
The genetic component of this study  is opti onal, and the subject may participate in other 
components of the m ain study  without parti cipat ing in the genet ic component. To participate in 
the genet ic component of the study the subject must sign and date both the consent form for the 
main study  and the genet ic component of the study as applicable. Copies of the signed and dated 
consent forms must be given to the subject and the original filed at the study  centre. The 
Principal Invest igator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is given freely and that the 
subject understands that they  may freely  withdraw fro m the genetic aspect of the study  at any  
time.
Subject data protection
AstraZeneca will not provide individual genoty pe resul ts to subjects, any  insura nce com pany, 
any emplo yer, their family members, general physician unless required to do so by  law.
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confident iality and prevent genetic data being linked to 
the identi ty of the subject. Regul atory  authori ties may req uire access to the relevant files, though 
the subject’s medical informat ion and the genetic files would remain physically separate.
Data management
Any genoty pe data generated in this study  will be stored at a secure system at AstraZeneca 
and/or designated organi zations to analyze the samples.
AstraZeneca and its designated organizat ions may share summary results (such as genet ic 
differences fro m groups of individuals with a disease) fro m this genetic research with other 
researchers, such as hospitals, acad emic organizat ions or health insurance co mpanies.  This can 
be done by placing the results in scientific databases, where they can be combined with the 
resul ts of similar studi es to l earn even m ore about healt h and disease.  The researchers can only 
use th is informat ion for health -related research purposes.  Researchers may  see summary  resul ts, 
but they  will not be able to see individual subject data or any  personal  identifiers.  
Some or all  of the clinical datasets from the main study  may be merged wi th the genet ic data in a 
suitable secure environment separate from the clinical database.

Actions required in cases of increases in liver biochemistry and 
evaluation of Hy’s Law
E 1 Introduction
This Appendix describes the process to be fo llowed in order to ident ify and appropriately report 
Potenti al Hy’s Law (PHL) cases and Hy’s Law (HL) cases.  It is not intended to be a 
comprehe nsive gui de to the m anagement of el evated liver biochemistries. 
Specific guidance on managing liver abnormalit ies can be found in Sect ion 7.1of the Clinical 
Study  Protocol .
During the course of the study  the Invest igator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry .  The Invest igator is responsible for determining whether a subject meets potential 
PHL cri teria at any  point during the study .
All sources o f laboratory  data are appropri ate for the determinat ion of PHL and HL events; this 
includes samples taken at scheduled study  visit s and other visits including central and all local 
laboratory  evaluat ions even if co llected outside of the study visits; for e xample, PHL criteria 
could be m et by  an elevated ALT from a central laboratory  and/or elevated TBL from a local 
laboratory .  
The Investigator will also review Adverse Event data (for example, for AEs that may indicate 
elevations in liver biochemistry ) forpossible PHL events.
The Investigator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria 
are met.  HL criteria are met if there is no alt ernat ive explanat ion for the el evations in liver 
biochemistry  other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by  the Invest igational 
Medicinal Product (IMP). 
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reportin g 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Adverse Events (AEs) according to the outcome o f the 
review and assessment in line wit h standard safet y reporting processes.
E 2 Definitions
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransfera se (ALT) ≥ 3x Upper Limit of 
Norm al (ULN) together wi th Total  Bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2xULN at any point during the study 
following the start of study  medicat ionirrespect ive of an increase in Alkaline Phosphatase 
(ALP).
Hy’s Law (HL)
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 AstraZeneca
Tezepelumab -D5180C00011
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 87 (107 ) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426AST or ALT ≥ 3x ULN togeth er wi th TBL ≥ 2xULN, where no other reason, other than the IMP, 
can be found to explain the combinat ion of increases, e.g., elevated ALP indicat ing cho lestasis, 
viral hepat itis, another drug. 
For PHL and HL the elevat ion in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (i.e. on the 
same day ) the el evati on in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevat ions 
in transaminases and TBL must occur.
E 3 Identification of potential Hy’s Law cases
In order to i dentify  cases of PHL i t is importan t to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory  
data for any  subject who m eets any of the fo llowing i dentificat ion criteria in iso lation or in 
combinat ion:
ALT ≥ 3xULN
AST ≥ 3xULN
TBL ≥ 2xULN
Central laboratories being used:
When a subject meets any o fthe PHL i dentificat ion criteria, in isol ation or in co mbinat ion, the 
central  laboratory  will immediately  send an alert to the Invest igator (also sent to AstraZeneca 
representative). 
The Investigator will also remain vigilant for any  local  laboratory  repo rts where the PHL 
ident ificat ion criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator will:
Notify  the AstraZeneca representative 
Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by  the central  laboratory without delay
Com plete the appropri ate unschedul ed laboratory  CRF m odule(s) wi th the ori ginal  local 
laboratory  test resul t
When the identificat ion criteria are m et from central  or local laboratory  resul ts the Invest igator 
will wit hout del ay:
Determine whether the subject meets PHL criteria (see Section E 2within this Appendix 
for definit ion) by reviewing laboratory  reports from all previous visits (including both 
central  and l ocal laboratory  resul ts)
E 4 Follow -up
E 4.1 Poten tial Hy’s Law criteria not met
If the subject does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:

Tezepelumab -D518 0C00011
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 88 (107 ) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426Inform  the AstraZeneca representative that the subject has not met PHL criteria. 
Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance provi ded 
in the Clinical Study  Protocol .
E 4.2 Potential Hy’s Law criteria met
If the subject does meet PHL criteria the Invest igator will:
Notify  the AstraZeneca representative who will then inform the central Study  Team .
Within 1 day of PHL criteria being met, the Invest igator will report the case as an SAE of 
Potenti al Hy’s Law; seri ous cri teria ‘Im portant m edical event’ and causalit y assessment 
‘yes/related’ according to CSP process for SAE reporting.
For subjects that m et PHL cri teria prior to starti ng IMP, the invest igator is not required to 
submit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change in the subject’s condit ion.
The Study  Physician contacts the Invest igator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach for the study  subjects’ foll ow-up (including any  further l aboratory  testing) and 
the continuous review o f data.
Subsequent to this contact the Invest igator will:
Moni tor the subject until liver biochemistry  parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated. 
Com pletes foll ow-up SAE Form as required.
Invest igate the aetiology o f the event and perform diagnostic investigat ions as discussed 
with the Study  Physician. This includes decid ing which the tests available in the Hy’s law 
lab kit should be used. 
Com plete the three Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available.
E 5 Review and assessment of potential Hy’s Law cases
The instructions in this sect ion shoul d be fo llowed for all  cases where PHL cri teria are m et.
As soon as possible after the biochemistry  abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the Study  
Physician contacts the Invest igator in order to review available data and agree on whether there 
is an alternative explanat ion for meet ing PHL criteria other than DILI caused by the IMP, to 
ensure timely  analysis and reporting to health authorities within 15 calendar days from date PHL 
criteria was m et.  The AstraZeneca Global Clinical Lead or equivalent and Global Safet y

Tezepelumab -D5180C00011
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 89 (107 ) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426Physician will al so be invo lved in this review together with other subject matter experts as 
appropriate.  
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Invest igator will fo llow the 
instructi ons bel ow.
Where there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, a 
determinat ion of whether the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE will be made and subsequent ly 
whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the
appropriate CRF.
If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE: update the previously submitted 
Potenti al Hy’s Law SAE and AE CRFs accordingly  with the new inform ation 
(reassessing event term; causalit y and seri ousness cri teria) fo llowing the AZ standard 
processes.
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
Send updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to AstraZeneca 
standard processes. 
–The ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous criterion should be used if no other 
serious cri teria apply.
–As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y 
assessment of ‘related’ should be assigned.
If, there i s an unavo idable delay, of over 15 calendar day s in obtaining the informat ion necessary  
to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no 
alternat ive explanat ion unt il such time as an informed decisio n can be made:
Provi des any  further update to the previously submitted SAE of Potenti al Hy’s Law, 
(report term now ‘Hy’s Law case’) ensuring causalit y assessment i s related to IMP and 
seriousness cri teria is m edically important, according to CSP process for SAE reporting.
Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary 
supplementary  informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine 
whether HL criteria are still met.  Update the previously submitted PHL SAE report 
following CSP process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome of the review and 
amending the reported term if an alternat ive explanat ion for the liver biochemistry  
elevations is determined.

Anaphylaxis: signs and symptoms, management
G 1 Introduction
As wi th any antibody , allergic reactions to dose administration are possible. The World Healt h 
Organizat ion has categorized anaphylaxis into 2 subgroups, which a re clinically 
indist inguishable: immuno logic [IgE -mediated and non -IgE-mediated (e.g. IgG and immune 
complex mediated) and nonimmuno logic (Johansson et al, 2004). The clinical criteria for 
defining anaphylaxis for thi s study  are listed in Appendix G 2. A gui de to the si gns and 
symptoms and management of acute anaphylaxis is provided in Appendix G 3. Appropri ate 
drugs, such as epinephrine, antihistamines, corticosteroids, etc., and medical equipment to treat 
anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available at study sites, and study personnel s hould 
be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis according to local guidelines. 
If an anaphylact ic react ion occurs, a blood sample will be drawn fro m the subject as soon as 
possible after the event, at 60 minutes ± 30 minutes after the event, and at di scharge for analysis 
of serum  tryptase.
G 2 Clinical Criteria for Defining Anaphylaxis and Immune 
Complex Disease
Anaphylaxis
In adul ts, anaphylaxis is highly likely  when any one of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled:
1.  Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with invo lvement of the skin, mucosal     
tissue, or both (e.g. generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swo llen lips -tongue -uvula)
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING
(a) Respiratory  com promise (e.g. dy spnea, wheeze- bronchospasm, stridor, hypoxemia).
(b) Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunct ion 
(e.g. hy potoni a [collapse], syncope, incont inence).
2.Two or more of the fo llowing that occur rapidly  after exposure to a likely allergen for 
that subject (minutes to sev eral hours):
a)Involvement of the skin -mucosal t issue (e.g. generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen lips -
tongue -uvula).
b)Respiratory  com promise (e.g. dy spnea, wheeze- bronchospasm, stridor, hy poxemia).
c)Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g. hypotonia [collapse ], syncope, incontinence).
d)Persi stent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. crampy abdo minal pain, vomit ing).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 94 (107 ) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc00174263. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that subject (minutes to several hours): 
Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease fro mthat 
subject’s baseline.
Immune Complex Disease
Immune com plex disease or Hy persensi tivity Type III i s evoked by  the deposi tion of  antigen-
antibody  or anti gen-antibody -complement com plexes on cell surfaces, with subsequent 
involvement of brea kdown products of complement, platelets, and polymorphonuclear 
leukocy tes, and development of vasculit is; serum sickness and nephrit is is co mmo n.
G 3 Signs and Symptoms and Management of Acute Anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is an acute and potentially lethal mult i-system  allergic reacti on in which som e or all  
of the fo llowing signs and symptoms occur: 
Diffuse ery thema
Pruri tus
Urticaria and/or angioedema
Bronchospasm
Laryngeal edema
Hypotensi on
Cardi ac arrhy thmias
Feeling of impending doom
Unconsciousness
Shock
Other earlier or concomitant signs and symptoms can include:
Itchy  nose, ey es, pharynx, genitalia, palms, and so les
Rhinorrhea
Change in voice
Metallic taste
Nausea, vo miting, di arrhea, abdominal cramps and bloating

Headache
Uterine cramps
Generalized warmt h
G 4 Management of Acute Anaphylaxis
Immediate intervention
1.Assessment of airway , breathing, ci rculation, and adequacy  of mentati on
2.Administer epinephrine intramuscularly  every  5-15 minutes, in appropriate doses, as 
necessary , depending on th e presenting signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, to control 
signs and symptoms and prevent progression to more severe symptoms such as 
respi ratory  distress, hypotension, shock and unconsciousness.
Possibly appropriate, subsequent measures depending on response to epinephrine
(a) Place subject in recumbent posit ion and elevate lower extremit ies.
(b) Establish and maintain airway.
(c) Administer oxy gen.
(d) Establish venous access.
(e) Norm al saline IV for fluid replacement.
Specific measures to consider after epinephrine injections, where appropriate
(a) Consider epinephrine infusio n.
(b) Consider H1 and H2 ant ihistamines.
(c) Consider nebulized β2 agonist [eg. albuterol (salbutamo l)] for bronchospasm 
resistant to epinephrine.
(d) Consider systemic corticosteroids.
(e) Consider vasopressor (e .g. dopamine).
(f) Consider glucagon for subject taking β -blocker.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 96 (107 ) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426(g) Consider atropine for symptomat ic bradycardia.
(h) Consider transportation to an emergency  depart ment or an intensive care facilit y.
(i)For cardi opulm onary arrest during anaphylaxis, high -dose epineph rine and prolonged 
resuscitat ion efforts are encouraged, if necessary .

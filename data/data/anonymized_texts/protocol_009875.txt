 Administration of Most Clo sely HLA-Matched Multivirus-
Specific Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes for the Treatment of 
EBV, CMV, Adenovirus, HHV6, and BK virus Infections 
post Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant  
 
Study Design:  The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate whether most 
closely HLA-matched multivirus-specific T cell lines obtained from a bank of allogeneic virus-specific T cell lines (VSTs) have antiviral activity against five viruses: BK virus, HHV6, EBV, CMV and adenovirus. 
   Reconstitution of anti-viral immunity by donor-derived VSTs has 
shown promise in preventing and treating infections associated with CMV, EBV and adenovirus post-transplant. More recently, an ongoing phase I/II study at our institution indicates that this 
approach can be extended to include additional viruses including 
BK virus and HHV6. However, the time taken to prepare patient-specific products and lack of virus-specific memory T cells in cord blood and seronegative donors, limits their value.  
  An alternative is to use banked partially HLA-matched allogeneic 
VSTs. A prior phase II study at our institution using trivirus-specific VSTs generated using monocytes and EBV-transformed B cells gene-modified with a clinical grade adenoviral vector expressing CMV-pp65 to activate and expand specific T cells showed the feasibility, safety and activity of this approach for the treatment of 
refractory CMV, EBV and Adenovirus infections. However, the 
production process was lengthy, requiring 8-12 weeks, with exposure to biohazards (B95.8 EBV viral strain and adenovector), while antigenic competition between different viral components precluded increasing the spectrum of specificity beyond these three 
viruses. 
 
 We have overcome these limitations and in the current trial, we will 
evaluate whether rapidly generated, allogeneic most closely HLA-matched multivirus-specific VSTs, activated using overlapping peptide libraries spanning immunogenic antigens from BK virus, 
HHV6, CMV, adenovirus and EBV will be safe and produce anti-
viral effects in allogeneic HSCT recipients infected with one of more of the targeted viruses that are persistent despite conventional anti-viral therapy. The study agent will be assessed for safety (stopping rules defined) and antiviral activity. 
 Primary Objective:  The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility 
and safety of administering partially HLA-matched VSTs specific for five virsues in HSCT recipients with persistent viral reactivations or

Page 5 of 45 infections. Patients will be closely monitored for any possible 
association between VST infusion and GVHD. 
 
 
Secondary Objectives: Secondary objectives are to determine: effects of partially HLA-
matched VST infusion on viral load and viral reactivations within 12 months, reconstitution of antiviral immunity, persistence of infused partially HLA-matched VSTs and effects on viral clinical signs and 
symptoms. Additional endpoints include secondary graft failure, 
development of chronic GVHD, clinical response to VST infusions, effects of HLA matching with clinical response and overall survival.  
 Eligibility:  Patients will be eligible following any type of allogeneic transplant if they have BK virus, HHV6, CMV, adenovirus and/or EBV infection 
persistent despite standard therapy (as defined in section 2.3). In 
addition patients with progressive or persistent JC virus infection (which is highly homologous to BK virus) may also be enrolled. If patients are receiving steroids for treatment of GVHD or for other reasons, dosage must have been tapered to 0.5 mg/kg/day 
Prednisone (or equivalent) prior to study enrollment. Patients may 
not have received ATG, or Campath or other immunosuppressive monoclonal antibodies in the last 28 days. 
 Treatment Description: The treatment schedule is as follows: 
 Patients will receive 2 x 10
7partially HLA-matched VSTs/m2 as a 
single infusion. In the rare case where insufficient banked cell 
product is available, a lower number of cells may be infused after discussion with the principal investigator, patient and/or guardian and the treatment team. If they have a partial response (as defined by a 50% fall in viral load) they are eligible to receive up to 4 
additional doses from day 28 after the initial infusion and at 2 weekly 
intervals thereafter. The viral load of the virus (or viruses) that patients are initially treated for must be monitored by viral PCR. GVHD scores will be recorded at the intervals defined.  
 
Accrual Objective:  A maximum of 80 patients will receive at least one infusion of VSTs. 
 
Accrual Period: The estimated accrual period is 4 years. 
 
Study Duration: Patients will be followed for toxicity for 28 days, acute GVHD for 6 
weeks; anti-viral responses for up to 12 months and long term follow 
up including chronic GVHD for 12 months following the final VST 
infusion.

Page 8 of 45 1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
 
1.1 Viral Infection Post Transplant 
Viral infections are normally controlled by T-cell immunity. Thus, in the immunocompromised setting (e.g. the period of immune recovery after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)) 
viral infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Risk for infection is dictated by the degree of tissue mismatch between donor and recipient, and the resultant degree of immunosuppression, and by the immune status of the donor. Reactivation of latent viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), BK virus, Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) 
are common and often cause symptomatic disease. Respiratory viruses such as adenovirus also 
frequently cause infection. Antiviral pharmacologic agents are only effective against some of these viruses; their use is costly, and associated with significant toxicities and the outgrowth of drug-resistant mutants. As delay in recovery of virus-specific cellular immune response is clearly 
associated with viral reactivation and disease in these patients, cellular immunotherapy to restore 
viral-specific immunity is an attractive option that has already been successfully used to target 
some of these viruses.  
1.2 CMV 
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a latent beta-herpesv irus that usually causes an asymptomatic 
infection in immunocompetent individuals. It persists in approximately 70% of healthy adults and replicates in epithelial cells, fibroblasts and monocytes. Reactivation of CMV in the stem cell 
recipient can result in significant morbidity and mortality, with clinical manifestations including interstitial pneumonitis, gastroenteritis, fevers, hepatitis, encephalitis and retinitis.
1 Cell-mediated 
immunity is considered the most important factor  in controlling CMV infection and CMV-specific 
CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes play an important role in immune protection from both primary 
infection and subsequent reactivations. The most frequently used drugs for prophylactic or preemptive therapy are ganciclovir and foscar net. These drugs have been successful in reducing 
mortality associated with CMV disease and in preventing early CMV disease in combination with intravenous immune globulin, but both have major side effects including neutropenia and nephrotoxocity.   1.3 Epstein-Barr Virus 
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a gamma-herpesvirus that infects more than 95% of the world's 
population. Primary infection usually produces a mild self-limiting disease, which is followed by latent infection in B cells and productive replication in B cells and mucosal epithelium. There are at least four types of viral latency, which differ in their viral antigen expression patterns.
2 In 
immunocompromised hosts, outgrowth of B cells expressing Type 3 latency (expression of all seven latency associated proteins)may l ead to the development of post-transplant 
lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). The overall incidence of PTLD after HSCT is approximately 1%, but the incidence is increased in recipients with an underlying diagnosis of immunodeficiency and for recipients of stem cells from unrel ated or human-leukocyte-antigen (HLA)-mismatched 
donors who receive grafts that are selectively depleted of T cells to prevent graft-versus-host 
disease (GVHD).
3-5PTLD is highly susceptible to control by virus-specific T cells6;7. 
 
Few small molecule drugs have any effect on  B cells already transformed by EBV and while 
nucleoside analogs including ganciclovir inhibit the vi ral explicative cycle their clinical benefit is 
questionable at best. Conventional chemotherapy, while  effective in some cases is associated 
with significant toxicity with high treatment related mortality in the HSCT patient population. One

Page 9 of 45 option for prophylaxis and treatment of PTLD afte r HSCT is rituximab, a monoclonal antibody 
against the B cell phenotypic antigen, CD20.5;8;9However, not all patients respond and rituximab 
depletes normal B-cells for more than 6 months, which can be problematic in a patient population 
that is already immunosuppressed.  
 
1.4 Adenovirus 
Adenovirus is a non-enveloped lytic DNA virus. Humans are susceptible to infection with 51 
serotypes forming six distinct adenovirus species (A to F), which differ in their tissue specificity 
and virulence. Although causing acute infections, adenoviruses may persist for many months after 
resolution of disease and therefore are frequently carried undetected into the transplant by donor or recipient. While acute infection is rarely fatal in healthy adults, it is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals, in whom it may produce pneumonia, hemorrhagic cystitis, nephritis, colitis, hepatitis, and encephalitis. Adenovirus has a particularly high incidence after pediatric HSCT.
10 Several reports have shown that clearance of adenovirus 
infection is associated with detection of adenovirus-specific T cells11;12 and recovery is 
significantly delayed in recipients of matched unrelated donor and haploidentical transplant who 
receive intensive immunosuppression such as Campath.12 The most frequently used drug for 
disease treatment is Cidofovir13, but the associated nephrotoxicity is a major concern. Moreover, 
in the absence of prospective, randomized, controlled trials, the efficacy of the drug is uncertain.  
 
1.5 BK virus 
Human polyomavirus type I, commonly called BK virus (BKV), infects 50% to 90% of humans 
worldwide before the age of 10 years, without k nown symptoms or signs. Polyomavirus disease 
in HSCT patients most often corresponds to secondary BKV replication with impaired 
polyomavirus-specific cellular immunity. Uri nary shedding of BKV occurs in 60-80% of HSCT 
recipients14. The major disease linked to high-level polyomavirus replication is BKV-associated 
hemorrhagic cystitis (PVHC), which affects 5-15% of HSCT recipients at 3-6 weeks post-
transplant. BKV viruria reaching high viral loads of>107 genome equivalents/mL is observed in 
20-80% of HSCT patients, but less than one fifth of HSCT recipients develop PVHC.  
No clear standard treatment is defined -cidofovir
15 has been administered intravenously in a low 
dose (i.e. up to 1 mg/kg 3 times weekly, without probenecid) or a high dose (i.e., 5 mg/kg per 
week with probenecid) to HSCT patients with BK infections but no randomized trials are available proving its clinical efficacy. Ther e is no evidence to support the use of cidofovir for pre-emptive 
treatment of asymptomatic HSCT patients who develop BK viruria or viremia.  Ciprofloxacin can 
inhibit BKV replication in tissue culture, but only scant data exists regarding its efficacy after 
HSCT
16, and is limited mostly to the prophylactic setting. In small trials leflunomide had some 
activity against BK virus17; therefore we will consider this agent an acceptable alternative to 
cidofovir, given the absence of a clear first line option.   1.6 HHV6 
Nearly all children are infected with Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) by 3 years of age and the 
viruses causes the classic childhood illness roseola. After primary infection, HHV-6 remains latent 
in lymphocytes and monocytes unless the immune sy stem is compromised, at which time the 
virus may reactivate
18;19. HHV6 is increasingly recognized as an important cause of morbidity and 
mortality in patients after HSCT, with viremia occurring in 40 to 60% of transplant recipients.

Page 10 of 45 HHV-6 infection generally occurs earlier than CMV infection. The median time to onset in 
accumulated studies has been shown to be 22 days and up to 70% of infections occur within the first 6 weeks of transplantation. 
 
This is an immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive virus that has been shown to facilitate superinfection with opportunistic infections, particularly fungal infections. It also has been shown to be a cofactor in CMV disease and concurrent infection with both these herpesviruses as opposed to CMV alone is strongly associated with CMV hepatitis and CMV viral syndrome.  
 
HHV6 reactivation is common during the early period post allogeneic HSCT transplant, with viremia occurring in approximately 40-60% of patients. In bone marrow transplant recipients, there is clearly an association between HHV6, marrow suppression and delayed engraftment and HHV6 very likely is a contributor to graft rejection. There are emerging data to show that it is an important cause of encephalitis in bone marrow transplant recipients. The presentation of HHV-6 
encephalitis in some ways is nonspecific. The mo st common clinical manifestation is mental 
status changes that can range anywhere from lethargy to more severe mental status depression. 
Seizures, headaches, speech disturbances, and fever have each been detected in about a quarter of the patients. Focal neurologic findings in HHV-6 encephalitis are somewhat unusual.  
Ganciclovir, cidofovir, and foscarnet have variable in vitro activity against HHV-6, and may have 
a role in treating HHV6-associated disease, however response is not consistent and the associated nephrotoxicity and myelosuppression remains a major concern.

1.7 Treatment of Patients with JC virus  
 
Human polyomavirus type I, commonly called BK virus (BKV), and the highly homologous human 
polyomavirus type II, commonly called JC virus (JCV), infect 50-90% of humans worldwide before 
the age of 10 years, without known symptoms or signs. Reactivation of JCV can occur with 
immunodeficiency, as occurs after HSCT.  
One of the most feared complications is the rare, but generally fatal progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is associated wi th the destruction of oligodendrocytes by JCV. 
Therapeutic options are limited and no recognized standard therapy exists. Isolated case reports 
had suggested a possible benefit of mefloquine, however a recent open-label, randomized, 
parallel-group, proof-of-concept study found no evidence of anti JCV activity by mefloquine in 
PML patients46.  
 
 
1.8  Adoptive Immunotherapy with virus-specific T cells 
Since recovery of virus-specific T cells is clearly associated with protection from infection with 
each of these viruses,11;20;21 adoptive immunotherapy to decrease the time to immune 
reconstitution is an attractive approach. Virus-specific T cells generated by repeated stimulation with antigen presenting cells (APCs) expressi ng viral antigens have been evaluated in clinical 
trials to prevent and treat viral infections in immunocompromised hosts.
22-26This approach 
eliminates alloreactive T cells.   There are several considerations in developing protocols for generating VSTs ex vivo. Knowledge of the immunodominant antigens that induce protective T cells specific for the targeted virus is

Page 11 of 45 required and a delivery system to transfer the antigen to effective APCs must be identified. The 
APC must be autologous, express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens presenting relevant virus-derived peptides as well as co-stimulatory molecules sufficient to induce T cell 
activation and expansion. These reagents all need to be suitable for GMP manufacturing, which 
limits the use of some types and sources of antigen.  
 1.8.1 Therapy with VSTs specific for CMV  
In the first study evaluating whether adoptively-transferred T cells could reconstitute anti-viral 
immunity, CMV-specific T-cell clones were derived from sibling donors after stimulation with 
autologous fibroblasts pulsed with CMV.
25 There were no adverse effects and CMV-specific 
immune responses were reconstituted, with none of the patients developing CMV disease or late recurrence. In another prophylaxis study, Peggs et al., generated CMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by stimulation of peripheral blood mononuc lear cells (PBMC) with dendritic cells pulsed 
with CMV antigens derived from a CMV-infected human lung fibroblast cell line
26. Small doses of 
VSTs were able to reconstitute immunity with considerable in vivo  expansion of CMV-specific 
VSTs. To avoid the use of live CMV during T cell manufacture, a more recent study stimulated 
VSTs with dendritic cells pulsed with the HLA-A2 restricted peptide NLV derived from the cytomegalovirus-pp65 protein.
27 While this approach also appeared effective, a concern is the 
restricted specificity of the infused VSTs, since targeting a single epitope may allow escape 
variants and limits the study to patients who are HLA A2-positive. 
 CMV-specific VSTs have also been used therapeutically in patients with CMV infection that has persisted or recurred despite prolonged antiviral medication.
28 The results were encouraging, with 
suppression of viral reactivation in 6 of 7 subjects. In this study, the source of antigen was a CMV 
lysate, which has the advantage of producing a broad immune response but which is unsuitable 
for Phase III studies because of the risk of infection from live virus in the lysate.   The VST cell therapies described above all employed methods of T cell production that require prolonged periods of activation and expansion in specialized GMP facilities with significant regulatory support. These requirements reduce the practicality of adoptive immunotherapy since 
VST lines must be made long in advance of disease and few centers have the facilities or infrastructure required for this type of cell processing. To overcome these problems, two direct T cell selection approaches have been used to isolate CMV-specific T cells from peripheral blood without the requirement for ex vivo expansion. The first approach is the interferon (IFN) γ-capture 
assay, which isolates IFN γ-secreting T cells after antigen exposure. Another approach is using a 
MHC-peptide-multimer-construct, e.g. streptamer selection.  
1.8.1.1 IFN γ-capture of CMV-specific T cells 
Feuchtinger and colleagues used IFNγ -captured CMV-specific T cells to treat chemorefractory 
CMV disease or reactivation after allogeneic HSCT . After short-term stimulation and selection a 
mean of 21.3 × 10
3 CD3+ cells per kg was infused to 18 patients, without acute side effects and 
only a single case of GVHD. In 15 of 18 infused patients clearance of CMV viremia or a significant 
reduction (>1 log) of viral load was associated with the adoptive transfer. Peggs et al also reported the clinical results associated with the adoptive transfer of IFN γ-captured CMV-specific T cells. In 
this prophylaxis/preemptive treatment study, pp65 protein or peptide pools were used to stimulate T cells. Post-selection a median of 2840 CD4+ and 630 CD8+ CMV-specific T cells/kg were 
infused early (median day 35) post-transplant and expansion of both populations was detected in

Page 12 of 45 vivo. However, unlike the Feuchtinger study, acute GVHD was observed in 8 of 18 patients, 
although this was mild in most cases with only 2 patients requiring systemic steroid therapy.  1.8.1.2 Multimer-based isolation of CMV-specific T cells 
Multimer techniques such as tetramers have also been developed for the direct selection of 
antigen-specific T cells. For example Cobbold and colleagues performed a clinical trial using 
tetramer selection of CMV peptide-specific T cells directly from peripheral blood. Cells were infused to patients within 4 hours of selection. Although exclusively CD8+ T cells were infused, 
they expanded by several logs after infusion, clearing infection in 8/9 cases.
29More recently 
streptamers have been used to clinically select distinct T cell populations for adoptive transfer. 
Streptamers, because of the biotin-streptavidin inte raction, detach from T cells over time and are 
thus not considered to be drugs, but rather adjuvant. This technical feature distinguishes streptamers from other multimers and facilitates th eir clinical use. Schmitt and colleagues recently 
reported the first clinical experience of streptamer-selected CMV-specific T cells
30. After a single 
infusion of 2.2 × 105 HLA-B7+/CMV pp65-specific CD8+ T cells/kg (purity of 97%), the frequency 
of CMV-specific T cells increased dramatically in vivo from 0% prior to infusion to a maximum of 27.1% of all T cells. These T cells were confirmed to be donor in origin by analysis of donor chimerism through single-tandem repeats, T cell receptor excision circles, and V β-chain typing. 
Clinically, the T cell infusion resulted in CMV clearance without alloreactivity. 
Though both approaches have been associated with clinical benefit, the multimer strategy is 
limited by the HLA restriction of antigen recognition, the availability of clinical grade multimers and lack of HLA class II multimers. Additionally, both the multimer and IFNγ  approaches require large 
numbers of starting peripheral blood material, which may not always be readily available (e.g. from an unrelated donor). 
 
1.8.2 Therapy with VSTs specific for EBV  
EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs)  generated by infecting peripheral blood B cells 
with a laboratory strain of EBV can be readily prepared from any donor, they have been used as 
APCs in clinical studies evaluating EBV specific VSTs.
6;7;9;31;32We have shown that adoptively 
transferred EBV-specific VSTs can survive for >10 years, expand up to 2-4 logs after infusion, 
and reduce the high virus load that is observed in about 20% of patients.6;7;24In a recent review of 
three studies targeting high-risk patient populations, none of 101 patients who received EBV VSTs as prophylaxis developed PTLD.
24Of 13 patients with active PTLD at the time of infusion, donor-
derived EBV-specific VST lines induced remission in 11,24 while in one of the non-responders, 
tumor virus had deleted the immunodominant epitopes in one of the viral antigens that were the 
targets of the infused effector T cells.33Numerous other studies have confirmed the activity of ex 
vivo expanded EBV-specific VSTs post transplant.9;32 
Rapid selection techniques have also been used to directly isolate EBV-specific populations for 
infusion. Indeed, Moosmann and colleagues isolated IFN  secreting cells following exposure to 
23 class I and II peptides derived from 11 EBV antigens , which were infused into 6 patients with 
EBV-PTLD34. While three patients responded, three with more advanced disease progressed.  
Whether these patients would have responded had they received higher numbers of effector T-
cells remains an important question for future development. Icheva and colleagues specifically targeted EBNA1 and pulsed APCs with either whole EBNA1 protein or EBNA1 overlapping peptide pools and then selected responding T cells by IFN γ capture. Ten patients with PTLD were 
treated and 7 had clinical responses. No significant toxicities were seen in these studies. Finally, Uhlin and colleagues isolated, using multimers, HLA A2-restricted T cells specific for epitopes in

recipient35. Post-infusion a small number of these directly selected cells expanded in vivo and 
produced a complete clinical response. At 12 months after transplant the EBV-PTLD recurred, 
but a second multimer selection and infusion induced a second response. 
 
1.8.3 Therapy with VSTs specific for Adenovirus. 
Feuchtinger et al. treated patients with adenovirus infection using CD4+ and CD8+ adenovirus-
specific T cells isolated from the donor after a short in vitro stimulation with adenovirus viral 
antigen followed by selection of IFN γ-secreting cells.36 Small numbers of adenovirus-specific 
donor T cells were infused into nine children with systemic adenovirus infection after HSCT. 
Adenovirus specific immune responses were detect ed in five of six evaluable patients, associated 
with a sustained decrease in viral load and clearance of infection.36 
 1.8.4 Trivirus-Specific Donor-Derived T Cells 
Most studies with VSTs have only targeted single viruses. To broaden the specificity of single 
VST lines to include three of the most common viral pathogens of stem cell recipients we previously generated virus-specific VSTs using a recombinant adenoviral vector encoding the CMV antigen pp65.
23 This method reliably produced VSTs with cytotoxic function specific for all 
three viruses in a process requiring 8-12 weeks for manufacture. When we infused these cells to 
14 stem cell recipients in a Phase I prophylaxis st udy we observed recovery of immunity to CMV 
and EBV in all patients but an increase in adenovirus-specific T cells was only seen in patients 
who had evidence of adenovirus infection pre-infusion.23 A follow-up study in which the frequency 
of adenovirus-specific T cells was increased in the infused VSTs produced similar results, thus highlighting the importance of endogenous antigen to  promote the expansion of infused T cells in 
vivo.
22 Nevertheless, all patients in both clinical trials with pre-infusion CMV, adenovirus or EBV 
infection or reactivation were able to clear the infection, including one patient with severe adenoviral pneumonia requiring ventilatory support.
23 
 More recently, our group has sought to simplify and accelerate T-cell expansion with minimal cell handling, while ensuring that T-cell specificity and function is maintained. The first step was to 
replace EBV-LCLs and adenovirus vectors as a s ource of antigen and APC. To eliminate the six 
weeks required for EBV-LCL manufacture, we inve stigated two alternate sources of biohazard-
free antigen sources (plasmids and overlapping peptide libraries) as well as dendritic cells (DCs) 
or APCs present in peripheral blood to activate virus-specific T cells. To first assess whether plasmids could substitute for EBV-LCL/adenovec tors we generate clinical grade plasmids 
encoding immunogenic EBV (EBNA1, LMP2, BZLF1), CMV (IE1, pp65) and adenovirus (Hexon, Penton) antigens and used DCs nucleofected with these plasmids to generate trivirus-specific T cells, which were expanded in vivo in the presence of the cytokines IL4+7 in a G-Rex device for 10 days before being cryopreserved for clinical use. To test the in vivo activity of these cells we have recently completed a phase I/II treatment study, achieving a response rate of 80% in patients 
with single or multiple active infections
37, without adverse effects. Thus, VSTs recognizing multiple 
antigens from 3 viruses can produce clinically relevant effects in vivo.  
1.8.5 Multivirus specific Donor-Derived VSTs targeting BK, HHV6, Adv, EBV and CMV 
BK virus and HHV6 are increasingly recognized as important contributors to morbidity and 
mortality in patients after HSCT and therefore including these two viruses in addition to adenovirus, 
EBV and CMV in a multivirus cellular immunotherapy strategy that targets all five of these viruses 
significantly increases clinical utility.

1.8.5.1 Generation of multivirus-directed VSTs by direct stimulation of PBMCs with clinical grade pepmixes. 
We have developed a 10-day GMP-compliant T cell production process to generate T cell lines 
with simultaneous specificity for 5 viruses (Adv, EBV, CMV, BK and HHV6). To activate PBMCs 
we expose PBMCs directly to a mastermix of pepmixes (peptide libraries of 15mer peptides 
overlapping by 11 amino acids) spanning imm unogenic antigens derived from each virus; - 
adenovirus (Hexon and Penton), CMV (IE1 and pp65), EBV (LMP2, EBNA1, BZLF1), BK virus 
(VP1 and large T), and HHV6 (U90,U11 and U14). After activation cells are transferred to a G-
Rex10 device for 9-11 days and cultured in media containing IL4 and IL7 to achieve maximal expansion of antigen-specific T cells without carry-over of alloreactive T cells
38. From starting cell 
numbers of 15x106 PBMCs/G-Rex we were reproducibly able to produce 1-1.2 x 108 antigen-
specific VSTs in the stated timeframe. These multivirus VST lines are polyclonal and polyfunctional, with activity against the stimulating viruses detectable in both the CD4+ and the 
CD8+ T cell fractions
38.  
 
1.8.5.2 Clinical activity of donor-derived multivirus-directed VSTs  
We evaluated the clinical utility of multivirusVSTs in recipients of matched related, matched 
unrelated, or haploidentical donor transplants. To date, 35 clinical-grade multivirus-directedVSTs 
have been generated from donor PBMCs.These lines were polyclonal, comprising both CD4+ 
(57±5%) and CD8+ (35±5%) cells and retained expression of the memory markers CD45RO+CD62L+ (58±8%). Their specificity was dependent on the prior viral exposure of the cell donor; 32/35 lines had activity against Adv, 20/35 against CMV, 26/35 against EBV, 18/35 against BK and 21/35 against HHV-6. None of the lines reacted against recipient PHA blasts – 
indicating lack of alloreactive potential in these rapidly generated lines. 
 We administered these multivirus-specific donor-derived VSTs to 10 allogeneic HSCT recipients in a dose escalation study; 4 on DL1 (5x10
6/m2), 4 on DL2 (1x107/m2) and 2 on DL3 (2x107/m2). 
There were no immediate infusion toxicities, and no de novo acute GvHD, demonstrating the in vivo safety of these mVST. Three patients received the cells as viral prophylaxis (days 38-43 post-
HSCT) and none developed viral infections at up to 3 months post-treatment. The other 7 patients 
received the cells as treatment for one or more active infections between days 59-139 post-HSCT. Based on viral load measurements by day 42 post-infusion, the VSTs were successful in controlling active infections with CMV (1 comp lete (CR) and 1 partial response (PR)), EBV (2 
CRs, including a case of frank PTLD); Adv (1 CR); HHV6 (1 CR); and BK (3 CR, 1 PR, 1NR). Of 
note, 3 BK virus responders had tissue disease with severe hemorrhagic cystitis and all had 
marked improvement or disappearance of hematuria following infusion. One patient subsequently had an episode of transient but severe bladder pain in association with inflammation seen on cytoscopy coincident with a 6 log fall in urine BK viral load. Our only non-responder was a patient with BK infection whose line lacked activity for this virus, likely reflecting the serostatus of the donor. In addition, 3 patients subsequently reactivated other viruses than those for which they 
were initially treated, but all cleared these infections by week 12, without the requirement for 
additional cell infusions (CMV: 1CR; EBV: 1CR; BK: 1CR; HHV6: 1CR). Finally, 1 patient received multivirus specific VSTs under a single patient protocol as an emergency treatment for widespread and bulky rituximab-resistant EBV-PTLD. Post VST treatment there was an immediate decline in the patient’s EBV viral load with complete and sustained resolution of PTLD, 
coincident with an increase in circulating EBV-specific T cells. However, the profound anti-tumor 
activity mediated by the rapidly-expanding EBV-directed T cells also produced a transient

antibody, with no long term adverse effects.  
Thus, infusion of donor-derived, multivirus specific VSTs generated with clinical grade pepmixes 
and infused either prophylactically or as treatment for one or more viral infections has been safe and is associated with the appearance of virus-reactive T cells in peripheral blood that have been able to control infection with all 5 targeted viruses.   1.9  Limitations of donor-derived virus specific VSTs 
Despite the successful use of donor-derived multivirus-directed VSTs in these trials, there are 
some limitations to this approach. One problem is that virus-specific VST lines can only be 
generated from donors who had previously been exposed to a virus and therefore cannot be 
generated from seronegative donors or cord blood. There is increasing evidence over the last 
years that the use of younger donors is associ ated with improved engraftment, decreased relapse 
rates and improvements in overall and ev ent-free survival in HSCT patients39. However younger 
donors are also more likely to be seronegative for several of the targeted virus, which along with 
the expanding use of cord blood transplants increases the number of patients for which donor-
derived VSTs cannot be generated. Another problem is that despite the significant decrease in 
the amount of time it takes to manufacture virus-specific VSTs with our pepmix-based method 
(decrease from ~3 months to just 10 days), this time frame is still too long for patients with more 
fulminant viral disease.  
 
1.10  Most closely matched allogeneic virus-specific VSTs 
An alternative approach that bypasses the need to grow VSTs for individual patients is to bank 
closely HLA-matched allogeneic VSTs that could be available as an “off the shelf” product. A 
concern with this approach is that the in vivo persistence of a mismatched product may be 
suboptimal after administration, as the recipient may generate an immune response to the non-shared HLA antigens. However, a number of studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach and reported clinical responses in the patients with EBV lymphoma arising after HSCT or solid organ transplant.
40;41In the first and largest multicenter study, Haque et al used banked 
polyclonal EBV-specific T-cell lines to treat EBV-PTLD after HSCT or solid organ transplantation 
and reported an overall response rate of 52% at 6 months. Similar results have been reported 
from Memorial Sloan Kettering with four of five PTLD patients achieving CR in response to third party EBV-specific T-cells. Of note none of these studies report an increased risk of GVHD. 
More recently our group has applied this approach to treat patients with refractory CMV, 
Adenovirus and EBV infections post allogeneic HSCT. Lines were generated using adenovector-
pp65 transduced monocytes and EBV-LCL and were either retained from our prior donor-specific 
clinical study or were newly generated from donors with known antiviral activity, including HLA 
homozygous donors identified by the National Marrow Donor Program. A total of 32 lines were 
produced and characterized, 18 of which were administered to the 50 study patients. The 
selection of lines for infusion was based on the specificity of the line for the target virus through a 
shared HLA allele, as well as the overall level of HLA match.  
This study was open to allogeneic HSCT recipients with CMV, AdV, or EBV infection that had 
persisted for at least 7 days despite standard therapy. Patients who had a suitable VST line

Page 16 of 45 received an intravenous infusion of up to 2 × 107VSTs/m2 and were eligible for additional infusions 
at intervals of at least 2 weeks, in the event of a partial response (PR). Of the 50 patients who 
received VST infusions 23 received VSTs for persistent CMV, 18 for persistent adenovirus, and 
9 for refractory EBV-PTLD. Five of the 50 treated patients withdrew from the study or died of their 
underlying disease. 
From the bank of 32 VST lines a suitable line was identified for 90% of the screened patients 
within 24 hours. Of the 50 patients who were treated with these VSTs 74.0% had a CR or PR 
(73.9% for CMV, 77.8% for AdV, and 66.7% for EBV), including responses in 6 of 9 patients with 
refractory EBV-PTLD, and most of these responses (89%) were durable. By contrast 8 patients 
in the study for whom a line was not ava ilable and who continued with “standard therapy” 
demonstrated a 13% response rate, and 6 (75%) died of viral disease.  
 
1.11Risks of Administering Virus specific VSTs 
1.11.1 Risk of Administering Donor-derived VSTs 
We recently reviewed the infusion-related adverse events (AE) following administration of ex vivo-
expanded T cell products (antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, allodepleted T cells, and 
genetically modified T cells) on investigational new drug (IND) studies in our center42. From 1998 
to 2008, we infused a total of 381 T cell products to 180 recipients, enrolled on 18 studies, 
receiving T cells targeting malignancies or post-transplant viral infections. There were no grade 
3-4 infusion reactions during initial monitoring or 24-h follow-up. Twenty-four mild (grade 1-2) AE 
occurred in 21 infusions either during or immediately following infusion (up to 6hrs), most 
commonly nausea and vomiting (41.6%), probably because of the dimethyl 
sulfoxidecryoprotectant, and hypotension (20.8%), attributable to diphenhydramine pre-
medication. Twenty-two additional non-severe events were reported within 24 h of infusion, most 
commonly culture-negative fever, chills and nausea. An increased risk of AEs was associated 
with age [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96-1.00, P = 0.05], while 
an increased risk of immediate infusion-related events was higher in patients reporting allergies 
(IRR 2.72, 95% CI 1.00-7.40, P = 0.05); sex, disease type and T cell source (allogeneic or 
autologous) had no effect on frequency of adverse events42.  
 
Focusing specifically on VSTs, over 125 patient s have been infused with EBV or multivirus VSTs 
in the donor-specific setting. The vast majority (123 ) occurred with no or minimal toxicity consisting 
mainly of localized swelling at sites of responsive disease. Two patients infused with donor-
specific products developed syndromes consist ent with systemic inflammatory response 
syndrome (SIRS). The first patient was infused with EBV VSTs as treatment for bulky disease 
including extensive pharyngeal disease. He had a vigorous inflammatory response with an 
immune infiltrate of genetically marked cells apparent on follow up biopsy. This response 
produced progressive airway obstruction and mucosal sloughing, ultimately requiring mechanical 
ventilation. He also had reversible cardiac impairment and fevers during this response. This 
patient subsequently made a full recovery and remains well more than 10 years later. He was 
treated in 1996 when cytokine panels were not available so we cannot conclude that this was a 
SIRS, but it seems likely. The second patient was infused with multivirus VSTs as treatment for 
rituximab-resistant EBV-PTLD, with bulky disease.  Approximately two weeks after receiving the 
VSTs she developed a fever, became tachycardic requiring fluid boluses and eventually required 
transfer to ICU with fever, tachycardia and hypotension for inotropic support. She required 
Dopamine and Norepinephrine to maintain her blood pressure and appeared to be in warm shock. 
The differential diagnosis of her treating physicians was sepsis or SIRS associated with VST

GVHD. As her blood cultures were negative and she continued to require inotropic support, was 
given empiric etanercept as well as methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg daily x2) and her symptoms 
resolved within a few hours. She remains well. 
 
In other reported studies none of the patients treated by Walter et al. with CMV VST developed 
GVHD25. In the cohort of patients treated by Peggs, MacKinnon et al., 3/13 patients developed 
mild (Grade I) GVHD; since immunosuppression had been withdrawn early in this study, it is 
unclear if this side effect was due to VST infusion.43 
 
1.11.2 Risk of 3rd party VSTs 
In a study at Memorial Sloan Kettering 5 patients received a median of 5 doses of third party virus 
specific VSTs for EBV after HSCT for EBV LPD, most at 1x106 EBV-VST/kg/infusion, and all 
infusions were well tolerated44. Updated data from the study was reported recently at the 
American Society of Hematology meeting 2012, with now 10 patients after HSCT enrolled in this 
study and among the 10 patients one patient developed mild skin GVHD after infusion with 3rd 
party EBV-VSTs, but tolerated a subsequent infusion of EBV-VSTs from an alternate 3rd party donor, with no other incidences of GVHD reported.
 
 In our study of third party VSTs specific for three viruses (AdV, CMV and EBV) a total of 50 
patients were infused with third party banked VSTs. All of the infusions were well tolerated. There 
were no immediate adverse effects, and despite the HLA disparity between the VSTs and 
recipients, de novo GVHD occurred in only 2 patients (grade I in each case). In the 8 patients in whom acute GVHD developed within 45 days of the first infusion (grade I in 6 patients, grade II in 1 patient, and grade III in 1 patient), 6 had a history of GVHD prior to receiving the VSTs. An additional patient had a flare of chronic skin GVHD. Two patients experienced transplant-
associated microangiopathy, a complication that occurs in up to 10% of HSCT recipients, 
particularly in those receiving sirolimus
45, as were both of our patients. Only 1 patient had 
secondary graft failure, concomitant with leukemic relapse.  In order to minimize the risk of infusing a VST product with alloreactive potential in our studies of donor-derived VSTs we have screened lines for reactivity against other host tissues such as 
fibroblasts and/or PHA blasts as a release criteria. However, there is no completely reliable in 
vitro assay for excluding the possibility of allor eactivity and performing such an assay in the 
current protocol would be difficult for two reason s. First, many recipients would not have residual 
pre-transplant lymphocytes available to make PHA blasts and their blood at the time of study eligibility determination would be of donor origin and therefore not a valid predictive target. 
Second, it would add 10 days to the release time which would adversely affect feasibility and 
perhaps outcome. We do not therefore propose this assay as a release criterion. We will, however, take several additional precautions to minimize the risk of GVHD.  First, any patient with pre-existing GVHD of ≥ Grade 2 will be excluded from the study. Second, we will administer VSTs 
at a dose of 2x10
7cells/m2. This is a much smaller number of T cells than administered at the time 
of an unmanipulated marrow infusion.

Page 18 of 45 1.11.3 Cytokine Release Syndrome 
 There have been several reported SAEs associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in 
patients who received T cells
46 or bispecific T-cell engagers47. The majority of CRS have been 
reported after the infusion of CAR T cells48-50, but CRS can also occur after the infusion of 
conventional antigen-specific T cells51 or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes52. Patients will be 
monitored closely as per study calendar and assessed for evidence of incipient CRS (onset of 
fever, malaise and dyspnea) and treated promptly. Management of CRS will follow published 
guidelines46,53, and is described in more detail in SOP F 05.11.XX and includes treatment options 
based on the clinical severity of the symptoms, such as oxygen, inotropic agents, IL-6 receptor 
antibody (4-8 mg/kg),TNF-α  antibody (5-10 mg/kg), and/or steroids (1-2 mg/kg/day of 
methylprednisolone or equivalent). 
 
1.12 Treatment of pati ents with JC Virus 
 
Recently the first use of ex vivo expanded polyo mavirus-specific CTLs has been reported with 
successful control of JCV-induced progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy post-HSCT54,. 
Balduzzi and colleagues treated an HSCT patient with resistant JCV-associated progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) using dono r-derived JCV-specific CTLs, which were 
generated in vitro after stimulation with 15-mer peptides derived from the BK virus VP1 and large 
T viral proteins55. After adoptive CTL infusion, virus-specific cytotoxic cells were detected in the 
peripheral blood, and coincided with JCV-DNA clearance in the cerebrospinal fluid. This case 
suggests that adoptive transfer of JCV-targeted CTLs may contribute to restore JCV-specific 
immune competence and control PML in transplanted patients. Given these promising results in 
the context of a complete lack of proven antivir al medications effective against JC virus and the 
potentially devastating complications associated with JC virus, patients with persistent JC virus 
infection will be eligible for this study.  
 
2 STUDY DESIGN 
2.1 Primary Objective 
This trial is designed to evaluate the feasibility andsafety of partially HLA-matched VSTs specific 
for five viruses in HSCT patients with persistent EBV, CMV, adenovirus, BK and/or HHV6 
infections.  
 
2.2 Rationale for Study Design 
The primary purpose of this pilot study is to as sess the safety of administering partially HLA-
matched VSTs in transplant patients with  BK virus, HHV6, EBV, CMV, and/or adenovirus 
infection. We have elected to use a dose of 2 x 107VSTs/m2, which has been shown to be safe 
and have clinical activity in a Phase I study using the same T cell product in the donor-specific 
setting. Because the persistence of adoptively transferred cells may be shorter using a partially HLA-matched banked VST product, we have included an option of administering additional doses in subjects that have a partial response after one dose.  
 
It is unclear what degree of matching will be needed for clinical activity so we propose to allow infusion of lines that match at only one antigen, with expected antiviral activity against the infecting

Page 19 of 45 virus through this single shared allele, although preference will be given to lines matching at the 
most loci where anti-viral activity through a shared allele has been confirmed.    
For CMV infection, standard therapy is well defined as antiviral agents with ganciclovir being the 
agent of choice and foscarnet or cidofovir being effective second line agents. For EBV infection, rituximab is the current treatment of choice for patients with CD20+ lymphoma. For patients with CD20- tumors there is no clear standard of therapy although most physicians would likely administer chemotherapy. There is also no clear standard therapy for adenovirus or BK virus, 
although there are reports of cidofovir having acti vity. We have therefore chosen to use cidofovir 
as standard therapy for both these infections although this requirement would be waived if the subject could not tolerate this agent due to nephrotoxicity. Ganciclovir, cidofovir, and foscarnet have variable in vitro activity against HHV-6, and may have a role in treating HHV-6-associated disease. Hence standard therapy will include treatment with one or more of these agents.  2.3 Eligibility 2.3.1 Inclusion Criteria 
For Initial VSTs and subsequent infusions: patients will be eligible following any type of allogeneic 
transplant ( as defined 2.3.1.1) if they have CMV, adenovirus, EBV, BK virus and/or HHV6

d. BK virus: Treatment of persistent BK virus infection or BK virus disease despite 
antiviral treatment with cidofovir or leflunom ide. No clear standard treatment is defined 
(section 1.1.5). Cidofovir15has been administered in low doses as well as high doses to 
HSCT patients with BK infections but no randomized trials are available proving its 
clinical efficacy. In small trials leflunomide had activity against BK virus17, therefore we 
will consider this agent an acceptable alternative to cidofovir, given the absence of a clear first line option.  
i. BK virus infection is defined as the presence of BK virus positivity as 
detected by PCR or culture in one site such as blood or urine.

may have a role in treating HHV-6-associated disease – therefore antiviral treatment with 
one or more of these agents will we acceptable initial therapy.  
 
i. HHV6 virus infection is defined as the presence of elevated HHV-6 levels 
as detected by PCR or positive culture in one site such as CSF or blood.

in peripheral blood or any site of dise ase (as measured by PCR or any other 
quantitative assay) after 7 days of antiviral therapy. 
  
f. JC virus: Treatment of progressive or persistent JC virus infection or disease without 
suitable alternative treatment option. Pepmixes specific for antigens on adenovirus, EBV, 
CMV, HHV6 and BK virus are used to generate our multivirus-specific VSTs. No pepmix specific for the rare JC virus is used for generation of these CTLs, however given the high homology (>90%) between JC and BK and the fact that BK virus-specific T cells targeting VP1 and Large T (as targeted in our multivirus VSTs) have been administered to treat JCV-PML, resulting in viral clearance from the ce rebrospinal fluid it is likely that our VSTs 
are efficacious against JC virus. Given the current lack of treatment options for JC virus infection or reactivation after HSCT and the risk of progression to JML, which is almost uniformly fatal, and the apparent activity of BK virus-directed T cells against JC virus infected cells, we propose including patients with progressive or persistent JC virus on this study, unless a suitable alternat ive therapy is available.  
 
i. JC virus infection is defined as the presence of elevated JC virus levels 
as detected by PCR or positive culture in one site such as CSF or blood.

by culture or PCR in one or more sites such as blood or CSF and symptoms 
of disease including symptoms of PML OR detectable JC virus by PCR or 
culture in more than one site. 
 
 3. Patients with multiple CMV, EBV, Adenovirus, HHV6 and BK virus infections are eligible

2.3.2 Exclusion Criteria 
1. Patients receiving ATG, Campath or other immunosuppressive T cell monoclonal antibodies 
within 28 days of screening for enrollment. 
 
2. Patients with other uncontrolled infections. For bacterial infections, patients must be 
receiving definitive therapy and have no signs of progressing infection for 72 hours prior to enrollment. For fungal infections patients must be receiving definitive systemic anti-fungal therapy and have no signs of progressing infe ction for 1 week prior to enrollment. 
 Progressing infection is defined as hemodynamic instability attributable to sepsis or new symptoms, worsening physical signs or radiographic findings attributable to infection. Persisting fever without other signs or symptoms will not be interpreted as progressing infection.  
3. Patients who are less than 28 days removed from their allogeneic hematopoieteic stem cell 
transplant or who have received donor lym phocyte infusions (DLI) within 28 days.. 
4. Patients with active acute GVHD grades II-IV.   
5. Active and uncontrolled relapse of malignancy 2.3.3 Informed Consent 
The informed consent process will begin at recognition of subject eligibility and consent will be 
obtained per institutional practices before study therapy is initiated. Consent process will consists of two parts: a) screening consent and b) treatment consent 
1. Screening consent: The screening portion consists of registering demographic data and 
patient eligibility data. The search for a suitable matched VST line is initiated if the patient is eligible. If a VST line is not available, the following data will be collected: demographic data, HLA type, infection type and outcome data. 
2. Treatment Consent: If a suitable matched VST line is available, the principal investigator 
or designee discusses the available line with the treating physician. After enrollment in the treatment portion of the protocol the patient can then receive the identified VST line if 
eligibility criteria are still met.  
 
2.3.4 Donor Eligibility

Page 23 of 45  
A) Lines that were previously manufactured for our IRB approved protocol H29966. These donors were initially chosen as transplant donors because they were the best match with 
the original transplant recipient and they met eligibility criteria. There are either additional 
vials available after the product was used in the donor-specific setting, or was not infused either because the original recipient did not need the VSTs or the original recipient was ineligible. These donors gave consent for lines not used for the original recipient to be used in the third party setting. 
 
B. Additional lines manufactured for third party use from individuals with common HLA types on an IRB approved protocol. Some of these individuals will be subjects who have previously enrolled on our IRB approved resear ch study (H7634) to manufacture CTL lines 
from normal donors for preclinical studies so that we know that their lines have broad antivirus reactivity. We will approach these don ors previously enrolled on this study to 
ascertain if they are willing to enroll and donate blood for the current study. We may also collaborate with the National Marrow Donor Program, which is a registry of HLA-typed donors who have volunteered for transplant donation to obtain additional donors. Those donors will be procured on a separate procurement protocol. 
 
For all third party lines, donors have been evaluated by the director of the donor center at BCM or an NMDP donor physician for NMDP donors. Donors must meet standard 
eligibility criteria for donation of blood or marrow. They have been screened with the standard blood bank donor questionnaire, medical history and testing for infectious disease markers by a physician who is experienced in screening transplant donors. Only 
donors who have cleared this process and were deemed to be eligible provided blood for 
VST generation. For lines that were previously manufactured for H29966, only those where the donor is eligible may be included in the third party bank. 
 
The results of the physician assessment and ID testing were reviewed by a CAGT laboratory director who gave the final eligibility determination according to the SOP for 
Donor Evaluation. 
 
The processes discussed in the protocol and related manufacturing SOPs are in 
compliance with 21CFR1271.   
 
 
2.4 Treatment Plan 
2.4.1 VST Line selection and availability 
2.4.1.1 VST Lines selection 
We will use multivirus-specific VSTs, generated initially for use on our donor-specific study. The lines were generated using a rapid protocol whereby clinical grade pepmixes spanning 
immunogenic antigens from each of our target viruses are used to directly stimulate PBMCs, 
followed by expansion in the presence of grow th promoting cytokines and the G-Rex culture 
device optimized for T cell expansion. Donor-specific VST lines generated according to this protocol were previously found to be safe and effective in a Phase I clinical trial as discussed.   
To initiate the multivirus-specific VSTs 15x10
6 PBMCs were pulsed with a master mix of pepmixes 
spanning Adv (Hexon and Penton), CMV (IE1 and pp65), EBV (LMP2, EBNA1, BZLF1), BK virus

Page 24 of 45 (VP1 and large T) and HHV6 (U90, U11 and U14). After 30mins the cells/pepmix combination 
was transferred directly to the G-Rex culture device. The VST media was supplemented with the cytokines IL7 and IL4 (10ng/ml and 400U/ml, respectively) in order to inhibit apoptosis and 
promote expansion of multivirus-specific T cells.  
 The VST lines were checked for identity, phenotype and sterility, and cryopreserved prior to administration according to our SOP. To test the functional antigen specificity of the VST we will use individual pepmixes spanning each of the viral antigens used in the initial stimulation as a 
stimulus in IFN ELIspot. Epitope mapping will be performed using known HLA epitope peptides 
or peptide mini-pools to identify novel immunogenic epitope peptides within our target antigens. 
 Products that meet study specific release criteria, as detailed on the CofA, will be infused as per 
Section 2.4.2. 
 If a positive sterility testing result is reported after the product is infused, the FDA and other relevant parties will be notified as per our manufacturing SOP B01.03.XX (Product Quality Assurance Program and Release and Return of Clinical GMP/GTP Products) and clinical research SOP J02.06.XX (Serious Adverse Experience and Unanticipated Problem 
Reporting).   Management of such a situation is further described in our SOP F05.09.XX 
(Management of Culture Positive Cell Therapy Products).   2.4.1.2  No Matched VST Line Available 
If no matched line is available the patient will be registered so that the feasibility of the approach 
can be assessed. 
 2.4.1.3 VST Line Available but Patient Status Changes
 
Patients with a clinical course that changes between screening and infusion and renders patient ineligible at time of infusion will not be given the VST.   
2.4.1.4 Criteria for Selection of VST Line 
In general preference will be assigned to the infusion of a line with confirmed virus-specific activity 
against the infecting virus through a shared HLA allele rather than the overall level of HLA match. For example for a patient with an adenovirus infection a line that matches at 2 loci but that has recognition of adenovirus mediated through those antigens would be preferable to a line matched 
at 3 loci but with no demonstrated activity agains t adenovirus. Patients with a partial response are 
eligible to receive up to 4 additional doses. 
 
2.4.2 Administration and Monitoring 
 2.4.2.1 Partially HLA-matched VSTs will be thawed and given by intravenous injection. Patients 
will receive 2 x 10
7partially HLA-matched VSTs/m2 as a single infusion. In the rare case where 
insufficient banked cell product is available, a lower number of cells may be infused after 
discussion with the principal investigator, patient and/or guardian and the treatment team. 
2.4.2.2 Premedications: Patients without prior history of reaction to blood products generally do     
not require premedication. If patients receive premedication, Benadryl 0.25-0.5mg/kg 
(max 25 mg) IV/po and/or Tylenol 5-10 mg/kg (max 650 mg) po/iv may be given.

2.4.2.3 Patients will be monitored according to institutional standards for administration of blood 
products and at a minimum will be monitored according to below:   
 Patients should remain in the clinic for at least one hour 
 Patients should remain on continuous pulse oximetry for at least 30 minutes 
 Vital signs should be monitored at the end of infusion then at 30 and 60 minutes 
 
2.4.2.4. Supportive Care: Patients will receive supportive care for acute or chronic toxicity, 
including blood components or antibiotics, and other intervention as appropriate. 
 2.4.2.5 If a patient 1) receives medication (such as steroids), which may affect the persistence or 
function of the infused VST, or 2) does not have a complete response to their initial infusion, did not experience a significant toxicity to their initial infusion, and if alternative treatment options are not available or associated with unacceptably high risk of side 
effects (e.g. count suppression or renal disease), they are eligible to receive up to 4 
additional doses at the same initial dose at day 28 post-infusion and at a minimum 2 week interval thereafter. If the additional doses are post steroid administration, the steroid dose must be decreased to a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day of Prednisone (or equivalent) or lower before the patient may receive additional doses.  
 
Additional doses may be from the same donor or a different donor  based on available cell 
lines and patient/disease factors. Decision to switch to a different donor can be made by the principal investigator based on factors that include sequential treatment of different viral infections, concerns for immune escape of the targeted virus and/or availability of a better matched or otherwise superior VST line. Additional treatments will only be given 
following the agreement of the patient, treating physician, and investigator.  This process 
can be repeated as needed.

2.5 Risks and Toxicities 
2.5.1 Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) 
The risk that adoptively transferred partially HLA-matched VSTs will cause Grade II or higher 
GVHD is low according to data from previous studies with 3rd party VSTs specific for adenovirus, 
EBV and CMV (Section 1.10).  If any subject develops GVHD they will receive our standard GVHD treatment as per SOP F08.03.  
2.5.2 GVHD Scoring 
GVHD will be monitored for 6 weeks following infu sion. Weekly GVHD organ stage scores, overall 
clinical grade, biopsy information for GVHD and relevant differential diagnosis will be recorded. The weekly score will encompass all informati on since the last assessment. Organ involvement, 
biopsy information, staging, differential diagnosis, and GVHD therapy will be documented in the medical record using the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) GVHD 
scoring stamp or equivalent.

Page 27 of 45 2.5.3 Chronic GVHD  
Chronic GVHD will be assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months  post-infusion. Assessment and a description 
of symptoms (only if GVHD is present) will be documented through completion of the GVHD 
symptom record (see Appendix I) .

2.5.4 Other toxicities 
Should unanticipated toxicities arise (e.g. severe local reactions or hepatorenal damage) they, 
too, will be graded by the NCI Common Terminol ogy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), 
Version 4.X with the exception of CRS that is related to T-cell infusions. CRS will be graded 
according to Appendix II.  
2.5.5 Management of Toxicity 
VSTs are susceptible to killing by steroids given at a dose of 1-2mg/kg. This is standard therapy 
for GVHD and could also be given if a recipient develops other complications considered possibly related to VST administration. Anti TNF-alpha receptor antibody and anti IL-6 also may have some efficacy in individuals that develop SIRS after T cell infusion and may be considered 
in patients with consistent clinical signs/symptoms (see 
SOP: F05.11.4 MANAGEMENT OF 
CHARMS Protocol v1.0 (10.30.13)  Version 5.0 (10.6.15)

would be per standard medical practice. 
3 STUDY ENDPOINTS 
3.1 Primary Endpoint 
The primary objectives for this pilot study are fe asibility and safety. Safety of administration 
of VSTs is 42 days for GVHD and 28 days for other toxicities. Except as noted below, the 
safety endpoint will be defined as  acute GvHD grades III-IV within 42 days of the last dose 
of VSTs or grades 3-5 non-hematologic adverse events related to the T cell product within 28 days of the last VST dose and that are not due to the pre-existing infection or the original malignancy or pre-existing co-morbidities as defined by the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.X.  
 
Grade 3 and 4 expected reactions seen with the use of T cell-based immunotherapy, such as fever and hypotension requiring pressor support, will not be considered a safety endpoint. Any other grade 3 or greater toxicity felt to be related to or resulting 
from Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) is included in the safety endpoint. Grade 3 
and 4 CRS infusion reactions that are persistent beyond 72 hours will be reported to the FDA in an expedited fashion, and will be considered a treatment-limiting toxicity. 
 Toxicities to consider include GI toxicity, renal toxicity, hemorrhagic toxicity, cardiovascular toxicity (hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia and left ventricular systolic dysfunction), 
neurological toxicity (somnolence and seizure), coagulation toxicity, vascular toxicity and 
pulmonary toxicity.

3.1.2 Antiviral Activity 
Peripheral blood and, where relevant, stool and urine will be monitored for CMV, EBV, adenovirus, BK virus, JC virus and/or HHV6 viral load. For the infection under treatment response in viral load 
will be defined as follows:  Complete response: Return to normal range as defined by specific assay used and clinical signs and symptoms.  
Partial response:  Decrease in viral load of at least 50% from baseline or 50% improvement of 
clinical signs and symptoms Mixed response : Decrease in viral load of at least 50% from baseline for one infection and an 
increase or no change in viral load for a second infection (only applicable for patients with two or more infections at baseline). Stable disease:  Changes insufficient to qualify as partial response or progression 
Progression:  Increase in viral load of at least 50% from baseline or dissemination to other sites 
of disease.  Viral response data will be reviewed by a consensus committee of investigators.  3.1.3 Reconstitution of Antiviral Immunity 
Patient serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be monitored for virus-specific activity 
by functional studies including ELIspot with appropriate viral specific peptide mixtures and available HLA-restricted epitope peptides, intracellular cytokine staining, serum cytokine profiling and/or other assays as they become available for immune profiling purposes. 
 
3.1.4 Persistence of infused VSTs 
Persistence of infused T cells will be monitored using deep sequencing and additional tests as 
indicated to track the TCR v-beta repertoire in the patient peripheral blood prior to and post-infusion. 
 
3.1.5 Effects on Clinical Signs of Viral Infection  
If a patient has organ involvement clinical response will be monitored. For patients with EBV lymphoma and measurable disease, respons e will be assessed by RECIST criteria. 
 
3.1.6 Survival 
Overall survival at 3, 6 and 12 months post VST infusion will be computed.
 
 
3.1.7 Chronic GVHD 
Chronic GVHD will be assessed 3, 6 and 12 months post VST infusion.  
 
3.1.8 Viral Reactivations 
All CMV, EBV, adenovirus, BK virus, JC virus and HHV6 infections/reactivations occurring within 12 months of VST infusion will be collected. Information about infection or reactivation with other 
viruses may be collected as well.

Secondary graft failure is defined as initial neutrophil engraftment followed by subsequent decline 
in the ANC to <500/mm3 for three consecutive measurements on different days, unresponsive to 
growth factor therapy that persists for at least 14 days in the absence of a known cause such as relapse. Secondary graft failure will be assessed at 30 days post VST infusion. 
 
 
4 PATIENT ENROLLMENT AND EVALUATION 
4.1 Enrollment 
The informed consent process will begin at recognition of subject eligibility and consent will be obtained per institutional practices before study ther apy is initiated. This protocol will be discussed 
with eligible patients and, when appropriate, their guardians. Only patients who receive their care 
in the integrated Cell and Gene Therapy Transplant program at Texas Children’s Hospital and Methodist Hospital are eligible for this study. Consent process will consists of two parts: a) screening consent and b) treatment consent 
1. The screening portion consists of registering demographic data and patient eligibility data. 
The search for a suitable matched virus VST line is initiated if the patient is eligible. If a VST line is not available, the following data will be collected: demographic data, HLA type, infection type and follow up data. 
2. If a suitable matched VST line is available, the principal investigator or designee discusses 
the available line with the treating physician. After enrollment in the treatment portion of 
the protocol patient can then receive the identified VST line if eligibility criteria are still met.  
3. Patients will be assessed for eligibility for subsequent infusions by completing the eligibility 
form. If the patient is deemed eligible, the search for a subsequent VST line will be 
initiated. 
 
All cell culture manipulations will be carried out  in the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy GMP 
facility using current standard operating procedures (SOPs). After Quality Assurance testing is 
complete a Certificate of Analysis will be issued.   
 
4.2 Study Monitoring 
4.2.1 Follow-up Schedule The Follow-up Schedule for scheduled study visits is outlined in Table 4.2.2 
 
Follow-up Assessments: The timing of follow-up visits is based on the date of VST infusion. If 
a patient has multiple VST doses the schedule resets again at the beginning so follow up relates to the last VST dose. Additional follow up assessments may be done based on clinical and laboratory responses.

the amount will be reduced to 3mls/kg. Depending on clinical and laboratory viral 
responses samples may be collected at additional time points.* 
 
Research laboratory studies will include: 
Assessment of virus-specific immunity as meas ured by serum profiling, ELIspot, intracellular 
cytokine staining, multimer assays and/or other assays as they become available. 
 
After the initial follow up for safety is complete at 30 days for toxicity and 42 days for GVHD, patients will continue to be followed per routine clinical care post transplant. We will perform laboratory follow-up studies for 3 months post-infusion or longer depending on clinical and laboratory viral responses and will assess these patients clinically at 3, 6 and 12 months to 
evaluate for any long term effects attributable to the VST infusion.

Page 34 of 45 4.3  Modified Follow-Up & Off Study Criteria  
 
4.3.1  Criteria for Modified Follow-Up 
The following criteria will result in the patient being ineligible for further treatment on the 
protocol, although response data will continue to be collected as applicable: 
 
4.3.1.1 Any patient who develops irreversible, life threatening, Grade 3-4 acute GvHD 
within 42 days, Grades 3-5 non-hematologic adverse event within 28 days from 
last VST dose and considered to be primarily related to VST injection. In such patients, the toxicities will be followed until resolution or until their off study date.  
4.3.1.2 Any patient who receives any other hematopoietic cell product. In such patients, 
adverse event data collection will cease. 
4.3.1.3 Any patient who receives therapy for relapse of their primary malignancy.In such 
patients adverse event data collection will cease. 
4.3.1.4 Any patient who experiences Grade 3 or 4 cytokine release syndrome that 
persists beyond 72 hours. In such patients, the toxicity will be followed until resolution or until their off study date.

5 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
 
5.1 Study Design Synopsis 
 
This study is designed as a single-arm pilot study to evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of most closely HLA matched multivirus specific  VST lines (CHM-VSTs) in HSCT patients with 
either of five viruses; BK virus, HHV6, EBV, CMV and adenovirus persistent despite of standard therapy.  The study first conducts a phase IIA trial to evaluate the clinical response rate. After the phase IIa trial, if the data suggests excellent clinical responses that warrant further investigation, the study will be expanded to recruit 30 additional patients to evaluate the role of HLA matching on viral outcomes.   
The total sample size of the study will be a maximum of 80 patients who receive at least one VST 
infusion. The sample size for the phase II A trial is 50 patients who receive at least one VST infusion. A larger number of potential subjects will be screened to assess the feasibility of the approach.

Page 35 of 45 We expect to enroll 15-20 patients per year and therefore expect the study to conclude within the 
estimated accrual period of 4 years.  5.2 Sample Size Determination and Design Characteristics 
 
Frist, the study will conduct a single arm poilt study using a phase IIa design. Simon's two-stage Minimax design
60 will be used to for the single-arm pilot study. Under the null hypothesis that the 
VST is not active, the data from previous trials suggest that the true response rate is 20% in anti-
viral activity, where a positive response is defined as the viral load reduction to the normal level 
for at least one of the 5 virus types (CMV, EBV, adenovirus, BK virus and HHV6) within 42 days following the initial treatment of VST.    Allowing a 5% type-I error and 90% power, the null hypothesis will be tested against a one-sided alternative that the true response rate is 40%.  The maximum size is 45 eligible patients, defined 
as the patients who receive the VST infusion and who can finish the 42 days follow-up.  We 
anticipate that most patients will finish the follow up and will allow a 10% drop out rate. Therefore, the maximum sample size is 50.  The phase IIa trial operates in two stages, where the first stage recruits 24 patients. The trial 
pauses at the end of the first stage to make the decision on whether to stop the trial early due to 
lack of enough efficacy for treating viral infection, according to the rule as follows. Of the 24 patients at the first stage, if 5 or fewer positive responses are observed, then the study will be stopped.  Otherwise, 21 additional patients will be accrued to reach the goal of 45 accruals.  At the end of the trial, the null hypothesis will be rejected, if 14 or more positive responses are 
observed in among the 45 patients. This design has 65.6% chance to stop early when the true 
response rate is 20%.   After the phase IIa trial suggests excellent clinical responses that warrant further investigation, the study will be expanded to recruit 30 additional patients to evaluate the viral reduction based HLA matching. We hypothesize the viral reduction among the low HLA matching group (1/8, 2/8, 
or 3/8 HLA matching) is not worse than the high HLA matching group (4/8, 5/8, 6/8, 7/8, or 8/8).  
 The sample size is calculated based on non-inferiority trial for comparing two-sample means. Based on the preliminary data, the standard deviation of viral reduction is about 18. We assume that the viral reduction in the low HLA matching group is not inferior to the high HLA matching 
group when the difference in the viral reduction between the two groups is no less than -10 (non-
inferiority margin). Preliminary data suggest that the ratio of sample size between the low and high HLA matching groups is 5 to 7.   A sample size of 30 patients with low HLA matching and 42 with high HLA match (total 72) would have at least 85% power to test the non-inferioirty hypothesis with 2-side 5% alpha level.  Assuming 10% of patients to be lost to follow-up, then the study will recruit up to a total of 80 patients. 
 
5.3 Stopping rule and data monitoring 
 
The phase IIa portion of the trial will be stopped for the lack of efficacy with one interim analysis to be conducted when the first 24 eligible patients have finished their 42 days follow up. The 
stopping rule is specified in Section 5.2.

Page 36 of 45 The phase IIa portion of the trial will monitor the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), defined as acute 
GvHD grades III-IV within 42 days following the administration of VSTs or grades 3-5 non-hematologic adverse events that are at least possibly related to the T cell product within 28 days 
of the last dose that are not due to the pre-existing infection or the original malignancy or pre-
existing co-morbidities as defined by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE), Version 4.X. *Note - Grade 3 and 4 expected reactions seen with the use of T cell-based immunotherapy, such as fever and hypotension requiring pressor support, will not be considered a DLT. Any other grade 
3 or greater toxicity felt to be related to or resulting from Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) is 
included in the DLT. Grade 3 and 4 CRS infusion reactions that are persistent beyond 72 hours will be reported to the FDA in an expedited fashion, and will be considered a treatment-limiting toxicity.  The proportion of events will be monitored using a stopping guideline based on a Pocock-type 
boundary for repeated testing for toxicity.
 61 The risk of DLT is considered to be moderate in this 
population, assumed to be 25%. The following sequential boundaries will be used to monitor 
dose-limiting toxicity rate:  
 
The trial will be stopped if the cumulative number of patients with DLT is equal to or exceeds the 
boundary listed in the above table.  This stopping rule yields the probability of crossing the 
boundary at most 5% when the true DLT rate is 25%, where the expected number of DLT is about 12.  The probability of crossing the boundary is 62.7% is when the true DLT rate is 40%.  If a patient experiences Grade 5 toxicity that is at least possibly related to the product, we will 
hold all infusions on the study until both the incident in question and the infused product have 
undergone a thorough internal review and the outcome discussed with the FDA.  
5.4 Data Analysis 
 Safety and toxicity outcomes including adverse event s, GvHD, clinical signs of viral infections, 
secondary graft failure and laboratory measurements will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics (frequency table, means, standard deviations, medians and ranges).  Toxicity 
information including the type, severity, time of onset, time of resolution, and the probable association with the study regimen will be tabulated and summarized.  
Response rate including complete response, partial response and mixed response will be 
summarized as frequency table. The response rate with 95% CI will be reported.  Reconstitution of antiviral immunity using multimer analysis an d ELIspot assays will also be summarized using 
descriptive statistics at each time point. Pairwise comparisons will be performed to compare changes of these immunological parameters from VST infusion to each time point of post-infusion 
measurements using paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests. The normality assumption will # pts 1-3 4 5-7 8-9 10-11 12-14 15-17 18-20

Page 37 of 45 be assessed and transformations to achieve approximate normality will be carried out if 
necessary.  Overall survival post VST infusion will be analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method.  
 
Viral load reduction will be compared between the low and high HLA using the two-sample t-test. 
Additionally, Viral load levels will be correlated with immunological parameters using correlation coefficients. Longitudinal analysis is empl oyed to model repeatedly-measured immunologic 
parameters. This will allow us to model patterns of immune response per patient while allowing for varying intercepts and slopes for a patient. Viral load levels will be correlated with 
immunological parameters using correlation coefficients. These modeling strategies will be 
considered exploratory in nature due to the limited patient numbers in this initial trial.   Overall survival since allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cumulative incidences to the time of complete/partial resolution of viral infection and viral load reduction, considering death a competing event, will be analyzed in 
univariate and multivariate model using the Fine and Gray method.

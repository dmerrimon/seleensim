CONFIDENTIAL  AMENDMENT HIS TORY  
Amendment 4  
The purpose of this amendment is to define the primary efficacy analysis based on approximately 122 subjects who 
up-dosed AR101 per the original protocol’s 24 -week up -dosing schedule (pre -COVID -19 restrictions) and to define a 
modified ana lysis set to differentiate these subjects. Changes were also made to clarify: rescue and prohibited 
medications, biomarker variables, visit windows, and adverse events of special interest (AESIs). The following table 
outlines changes made to the protocol a nd the rationale.  
  
Description of Change  Rationale  Section Changed  
Updated sample size for the 
primary analysis such that 
approximately 122 subjects who 
undergo the post up -dosing 
double -blind placebo -controlled 
food challenge (DBPCFC) at week 
28 (visit  16) or discontinue from 
study prior to week 28 (visit 16) 
will be included in the primary 
efficacy analysis.   
 
Added a new analysis set to the 
statistical plan to clarify that these 
subjects who up -dosed AR101 per 
the original protocol plan will be 
analyz ed in a modified full 
analysis set (mFAS), separate from 
the full analysis set (FAS), which 
includes all randomized subjects .  To differentiate the analysis 
of subjects who up -dosed 
AR101 per the original 
protocol plan from those 
subjects who attended 
optional visits 15a -f (added 
in amendment 3 to 
accommodate COVID -19 
restrictions), which extended 
up-dosing by up to 12 weeks. 
Subjects who attend optional 
visits  will have increased 
duration of exposure to 
AR101 and dupilumab.

suggest IgE -mediated allergic 
reactions to main peanut 
allergen components (eg, Ara 
h1, h2, h3) may correlate 
with clinical sensitivity to 
peanut exposure and the 
outcome of DBPCFC. It is 
important to understand how 
dupilumab as an adjunct to 
AR101 could modulate the

CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
The purpose of this protocol amendment is to protect subject safety and data integrity during the COVID -19 
pandemic by extending the screening and up -dosing periods, and by modifying requirements for FeNO 
(fractional exhaled nitric oxide) and spirometry assessments. All mechanisms utilized and deviat ions from 
planned study procedures are to be documented as being related to COVID -19 where applicable and will 
remain in effect for the duration of the public health emergency. The following table outlines the changes 
made to the protocol and the rationale .  
Description of Change  Rationale  Section Changed  
The up -dosing period for AR101 
peanut protein was permitted to be 
extended an additional 12  weeks for 
subjects impacted by the COVID -19 
pandemic, such that the up -dosing 
period is ideally 28 weeks but may 
be extended to a maximum of 
40 weeks (4 weeks pretr eatment, 
22 to 34 weeks up -dosing, and 
2 weeks at maximum dose).  
 
These changes are reflected in the 
Schedule of Events such that all 
subjects will complete up to visit 15, 
then visits 15a -f will be optional to 
reach 300 mg/day AR101 for a 
minimum of 2 we eks.  
 
Subsequently, the on -study double -
blind placebo -controlled food 
challenges (DBPCFCs) were re -
named to reference milestones rather 
than time points for operational 
consideration:  
• Screening DBPCFC  
(name unchanged)  
• Post up -dosing DBPCFC 
at visit 16  (formerly week 
28) is the first on -study 
food challenge after the 
up-dosing period (week  28 
to week 40). This will be 
considered visit  16 
regardless of whether a 
subject completes optional 
visits 15a -f. 
• Post maintenance 
DBPCFC at visit 22 
(formerly week 52) is the 
second on -study food 
challenge at the end of the 
maintenance period (week 
52 to week 64), 24 weeks The AR101 up -dosing 
period was extended to 
allow for in -clinic visit 
flexibility and thereby 
protect subject safety 
and data integrity in the 
context of the COVID -
19 pandemic.  
 
The DBPCFCs were 
subsequently re -named 
for clarification, as the 
time points may differ 
for subjects  affected by 
COVID -19. Clinical Study Protocol Synopsis:

weeks to 16 weeks for current 
subjects in screening. Screening was 
previously day -57 to day -17 and is 
now day -113 to day -17.

Decreased the level of serum peanut specific IgE required for 
inclusion from ≥24 kUA/L to ≥10  kUA/L and/or Skin Prick 
Test (SPT) to peanut of ≥10 mm to ≥8 mm, compared to SPT 
negative control, to expand the pool of subjects who may be 
eligible for the study . The previous criteria were too restrictive 
compared to similar oral immunotherapy (OIT) studies and the 
change will still enroll only severely allergic subjects who 
react to screening double -blind peanut challenge at ≤144 mg 
(cumulative).  Section  7.2.1  Inclusion Criteria, # 4  
Changed prohibited use to allow use of systemic (oral, 
intravenous [IV], intramuscular [IM], subcutaneous [SC]) 
corticosteroids during the study for no more than 5  continu ous

CONFIDENTIAL  CLINICAL STUDY PROTO COL SYNOPSIS  
Title  A Phase 2, Multicenter, Randomized, Double -Blind, P lacebo -Controlled, 
Study in Pediatric Subjects with Peanut Allergy to Evaluate the Efficacy and 
Safety of Dupilumab as Adjunct to AR101 (Peanut Oral Immunotherapy)  
Site Locations  
 Principal Investigator  Approximately 25 sites in the US  
To be determined  
Objectives  Primary objective:  
• To assess whether dupilumab as adjunct to AR101 compared to 
placebo improves desensitization at the completion of up -dosing, 
defined as an increase in the proportion of subjects who pass a post 
up-dosing double -blind placebo -controlled food challenge 
(DBPCFC) at visit 16  
Secondary objectives:  
• To assess whether dupilumab as adjunct to AR101 compared to 
placebo improves desensitization at the completion of up -dosing, 
defined as an increase in the cumulative tolerated dose (lo g 
transformed) of peanut protein during a post up -dosing DBPCFC 
at visit 16  
• To assess whether dupilumab as (indefinite [continuously]) 
adjunct to AR101 compared to placebo maintains desensitization, 
defined as an increase in the proportion of subjects wh o pass a 
post maintenance DBPCFC at visit 22  
• To assess whether dupilumab as (limited [previously]) adjunct to 
AR101 compared to placebo maintains desensitization, defined as 
an increase in the proportion of subjects who pass a post 
maintenance DBPCFC at visit 22

CONFIDENTIAL  Study Design  This is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, 
2-arm study in subjects aged 6 to 17 years inclusive who are allergic to 
peanut . The study consists of a screening period of up to 16 weeks; a 
28 to 40 week treatment period, which includes 4 weeks of pretreatment 
with dupilumab or placebo followed by 24 to 36 weeks of treatment with 
dupilumab or placebo in combination with a gradual up -dosing of AR101 to 
reach 300 mg/day (ideally 28 weeks in duration, including pretreatment, but 
may be extended to a ma ximum of 40 weeks to accommodate dose 
reductions and re -escalation as well as COVID -19 restrictions of in -clinic 
visits;  a 24 -week maintenance phase with 300 mg/day AR101 in 
combination with dupilumab or matching placebo (for subjects who achieve 
300 mg/da y AR101 for at least 2 weeks in the up -dosing period), and a 
12-week post -treatment follow -up period. Total duration is between 
64 and 76 weeks, excluding the screening period.  
After obtaining informed consent/assent, subjects will be assessed for 
eligibil ity during a 2 -part screening period . During screening visit 1 (day  -
113 to day -17), subjects will undergo a medical history, physical 
examination, spirometry, a standard peanut skin prick test (SPT), and 
laboratory testing (including peanut sIgE) and wil l be evaluated for the study 
eligibility criteria . Subjects must meet all eligibility for screening visit 1 
before proceeding with the DBPCFC in visit 1a.  
During screening visit 1a (must be before day -15), under direct study 
investigator monitoring, subje cts will undergo a DBPCFC to confirm peanut 
allergy . This will consist of 5 doses (1, 3, 10, 30 and 100 mg) of peanut 
protein given every 15 to 30  minutes in increasing amounts up to a 
cumulative total of 144 mg of peanut protein . Vital signs will be asses sed 
every 15 to 30 minutes . If the study team suspects a reaction may be 
developing, they may exercise their clinical judgement to separate doses by 
up to an additional 30 minutes (1 -hour maximum between doses) . The 
matching placebo challenge will consist of placebo material (oat protein) 
given also in 5 doses . The food challenges will be performed on different 
days (1 -day placebo [oat] protein, 1 -day peanut protein, with order 
determined at random) at least 24  hours apart . After the last dose of the 
DBPCFC , the subject will be monitored for 2 hours and then discharged 
from the clinic . Subjects will be considered to have tolerated the DBPCFC 
if they do not experience any objective Grade 1 (mild) reaction on the peanut 
protein days based on the Consortium of Food Allergy Research (CoFAR) 
grading system and will be excluded from the study.  
Double -Blind Treatment Period (28 to 40 weeks duration)  
Subjects with a history of confirmed peanut allergy who continue to meet 
eligibility criteria at baseline will undergo  day 1/baseline assessments and 
will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio stratified by screening peanut -specific IgE 
level (≤100 kUA/L or >100 kUA/L) and body weight (<30 kg, ≥30 kg and 
                                        VV-RIM-00116697-1.0 Approved - 23 Jul 2020 GMT-5:00

CONFIDENTIAL  <60 kg, or ≥60 kg) at randomization into one of 2 treatment arms (n=52 for 
placebo and n=104 for dupilumab) . A minimum of 15 subjects for each 
weight group will be enrolled.  
Dupilumab and placebo will be dosed subcutaneously (SC) as follows based 
on weight at randomization and dose will not be changed regardless of 
weight gain or l oss: 
• subjects weighing <30 kg will receive dupilumab 100 mg every 2 
weeks (Q2W) following a loading dose of 200 mg or matching 
placebo Q2W  
• subjects weighing ≥30 kg and <60 kg will receive dupilumab 200  mg 
Q2W following a loading dose of 400 mg or match ing placebo Q2W  
• subjects weighing ≥60 kg will receive dupilumab 300 mg Q2W 
following a loading dose of 600 mg or matching placebo Q2W  
After the first 4 weeks of pretreatment, subjects will begin AR101 with an 
up-dosing regimen to a maximum of 300 mg/day over the next 
24 to 36 weeks of the study, for a total of 28 to 40 weeks (including 
pretreatment) with 28 weeks being ideal and 40 weeks being the maximum. 
(The flexible up -dosing period is to accommodate dose reductions and 
re-escalation as well as COVID -19 restrictions of in -clinic visits. Thus, the 
up-dosing period will consist of 4 weeks pretreatment, 22 to 34 weeks of 
flexible up -dosing, and at least 2 weeks at the maximum dose of 
300 mg/day).  
During concomitant AR101, study drug will be administered S C at home (at 
least 24 hours after in -clinic AR101 dose escalation and at least 8 hours apart 
from the at -home daily AR101 dose) . After ingestion of AR101, subjects 
should be monitored for 2 hours for allergic reaction. A ll subjects will 
complete up to vis it 15. Visits 15a -f will be optional in order to reach 300 
mg/day AR101 for a minimum of 2 weeks. Subjects will undergo a post up -
dosing DBPCFC at visit 16 if they have reached 300 mg/day for at least 2 
weeks (on a day after the last dose of AR101). Dosing  with AR101 should 
continue on the days between the two parts of the DBPCFC .  
Placebo Group  
At day 1: Placebo (weight -based dose) Q2W SC for 28 to 40  weeks.  
At week 4: AR101 using a standardized regimen of single initial dose 
escalation day (IDED) from 0.5  mg to a maximum of 6 mg peanut protein 
(12 mg cumulative) over 5 hours in -clinic (home dosing will be 3 mg/day 
AR101 for the next 2 weeks until up -dosing) followed by bi -weekly (Q2W) 
in-clinic up -dosing from the highest tolerated initial day dose to a max imum 
of 300 mg/day at home for 22 to 34  additional weeks. If the scheduled 
bi-weekly up -dosing is not possible, the up -dosing period may be extended 
by up to 12 weeks (visits 15a -f, as needed) to accommodate dose reductions 
and re -escalation as well as COV ID-19 restrictions of in -clinic visits. Thus,

22 to 34  additional weeks. If the scheduled bi -weekly up -dosing is not 
possible, the up -dosing period may be extended by up to 12 weeks 
(visits  15a-f, as needed) to accommodate dose reductions and re -escalation 
as well as COVID -19 restrictions of in -clinic visits. Thus, the up -dosing 
period will end at week 28 to 40 (including 4 weeks pretreatment, 
22 to 34 weeks of flexible up -dosin g, and at least 2 weeks at the maximum

Double -Blind Maintenance Phase (Only for Subjects Who Reach 
300 mg/Day AR101)  
Subjects who achieve 300 mg/day AR101 for at least 2 weeks during the 
up-dosing period will enter a 24 -week maintenance phase in which all 
subjects will continue to receive AR101 300 mg/day at home . Subjects in 
the dupilumab treatment group will be re -randomized (1:1) to receive 
dupilumab or placebo . Subjects who received placebo during the up -dosing 
phase will continue to receive p lacebo in the maintenance phase. After 24 
weeks of AR101  and dupilumab or placebo, subjects will undergo a post 
maintenance DBPCFC to assess the level of peanut protein sensitivity at 
visit 22. Dosing with AR101 should continue on the days between the two 
parts of the DBPCFC.  
Subjects who do not achieve 300 mg/day AR101 for at least 2  weeks at 
visit 16 are not permitted to enter the maintenance phase and will enter a 
12-week follow -up period.  
Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Food Challenge  
At visit 16, all subjects who achieve 300 mg/day AR101 for at least 2 weeks 
in the up -dosing phase will undergo a post up -dosing DBPCFC up to 2044 
mg (cumulative) peanut protein or placebo to assess desensitization . At 
visit 22, all subjects who maintain 300 mg/day AR101 w ill undergo a post 
maintenance DBPCFC up to 2044 mg (cumulative) peanut protein or 
placebo to assess desensitization . Dosing with AR101 should continue on 
the days between the two parts of the DBPCFC . The subject’s sensitivity to 
peanut allergen is defined  as the dose at which the subject experiences

masks the taste . The food challenges will be performed on different days (1 -
day placebo [oat] protein, 1 -day peanut protein, with order determined at 
random) at leas t 24 hours, but not more than 7 days, apart and not within 24 
hours of a dose of study drug . After the last dose of the DBPCFC, the subject 
will be monitored for 2 hours and then discharged from the clinic . Subjects 
will be considered to have passed the DB PCFC if they do not experience 
any objective mild (Grade 1) reaction by CoFAR grading system . In 
addition, subjects will be considered to have passed the DBPCFC if they do 
not experience any mild subjective symptoms requiring pharmacological 
intervention a nd/or moderate or severe symptoms.  
Post-Treatment Follow -Up Period (12 weeks)  
All subjects will have a 12 -week follow -up period after the end of treatment 
and will undergo safety, laboratory and clinical assessments.  
At the end of the 12 -week follow -up per iod, subjects who passed a 444 mg 
(cumulative) post maintenance DBPCFC at visit 22 will be eligible to 
undergo a final end of study DBPCFC (up to 2044 mg cumulative) under 
intensive monitoring, at visit 25 to assess the level of peanut sensitivity after 
12 weeks off peanut and dupilumab to determine whether there is evidence 
of persistent effects and sustained unresponsiveness.  
Study Duration  The duration of the study for a subject is approximately 64 to 76 weeks, 
excluding the screening period.  
Population   
 Sample Size:  Approximately 156 subjects, 104 and 52 for the dupilumab and placebo

Procedures and Assessments  The efficacy of dupilumab will be assessed by 3 DBPCFCs to occur after 
the initial screening DBPCFC:  
• Post u p-dosing DBPCFC at visit 16 (after reaching 300 mg/day of 
AR101 for at least 2 weeks; week 28 to 40)  
• Post maintenance DBPCFC at visit 22 (24 weeks after the 
up-dosing DBPCFC; week 52 to 64)  
• End of study DBPCFC at visit 25 (12 weeks after the maintenance 
DBPCFC; week 64 to 76)  
Overall safety will be assessed by monitoring/evaluation of 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), physical examinations, vital 
signs, and clinical safety laboratory tests at prespecified time points.  
Statistical Plan  Sample Siz e 
It is assumed that the proportion of subjects who achieve a cumulative dose 
of 2044 mg of peanut protein during a post up -dosing DBPCFC at visit 16 
in the placebo plus AR101 arm will be 40%, b ased on the Aimmune 
presentation at the 2018  American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & 
Immunology –World Allergy Organization Joint Congress with the 
proportion of subjects in the dupilumab plus AR101 arm assumed to be 65%, 
which is considered to be clinical me aningful benefit by adding on 
dupilumab treatment . A sample size of approximately 156 subjects (104 in 
dupilumab plus AR101 and 52 in placebo plus AR101) will have 80% power 
to detect a treatment difference of 25% between placebo plus AR101 and 
dupilumab p lus AR101 at the 2 -sided Fisher exact test with 5% significance 
level (the minimum significant difference is approximately 17.8%).  
Approximately 122 subjects who undergo the post up -dosing DBPCFC at 
week 28 (visit 16 with a window of -7/+30 days) or disco ntinue from study 
prior to week 28 (visit 16 with a window of -7/+30 days) will be included in 
                                        VV-RIM-00116697-1.0 Approved - 23 Jul 2020 GMT-5:00

CONFIDENTIAL  the primary efficacy analysis. These subjects receive AR101 dose escalation 
per the original protocol’s 24 -week up -dosing schedule. The minimum 
significant diffe rence with approximately 122 subjects is approximately 
20.7% between placebo plus AR101 and dupilumab plus AR101 assuming 
the placebo plus AR101 treatment effect is 40% at the 2 -sided Fisher exact 
test with 5% significance level.  
Efficacy Analysis Set  
The full analysis set (FAS) includes all rando mized subjects . Efficacy 
analyses will be based on the treatment allocated at randomization (as 
randomized).  
The modified full analysis set (mFAS) includes all FAS subjects who 
undergo the post up -dosing DBPCFC at week 28 (visit 16 with a window of 
-7/+30 days) or discontinue from study prior to week 28 (visit 16 with a 
window of -7/+30 days).  
The mFAS will be used for primary analysis for all efficacy endpoints. 
Analysis of the FAS will also be done for supportive analyses.  
Safety Analysis Set  
The safety analysis set (SAF) includes all randomized subjects who received 
any study drug; it is based on the treatment received (as treated) . Treatment 
compliance/administration and all clinical safety variables will be analyzed 
using the SAF.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary endpoint will be analyzed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel 
test adjusted by randomization stratification factors to assess the treatment 
difference in the proportion of responders (ie, those wh o “pass” a post 
up-dosing DBPCFC with 2044 mg [cumulative] peanut protein at visit 16 
[week 28 with a window of -7/+30 days]) in the mFAS. In addition, the 
primary efficacy endpoint will be performed on the FAS as a supportive 
analysis.  
If a subject does n ot have available post up -dosing DBPCFC data at visit  16, 
the subject will be considered as a non -responder regardless of reasons for 
missing data.  
Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will include an analysis of the 
subset of subjects with availa ble visit 16 post up -dosing DBPCFC.  
Subgroup analysis (eg, by baseline weight group) will also be performed.  
Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
All secondary endpoints will be analyzed descriptively at given visits.  
Change in the cumulative tolerated dose (log transformed) of peanut protein 
during a DBPCFC from baseline to  the end of the up -dosing period  at 
visit 16 will be analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with

CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
Food allergy is a potentially life-threatening condition that affects up to 8% of young children and 
3% to 5% of the entire United States (US) population ( Gupta, 2011 ) (Sicherer, 2010 ). Unlike many 
other childhood allergies, peanut allerg y typically persists into adulthood and is associated with a 
higher incidence of severe anaphylaxis as compared with other food allergies ( Dyer 2015 ). The 
current remedies for food allergy are food avoidance and treatment with medic ations such as 
injectable epinephrine for accidental exposures associated with severe allergic symptoms . 
Although recent progress has been made in the treatment of food allergy through allergen -specific 
oral immunotherapy (OIT), there is an unmet need for a new therapy in food allergy . The aim of 
OIT is to induce desensitization and increase the threshold for peanut ingestion and reduce the 
risks of allergic reactions after accidental ingestion. However, many subjects in OIT trials continue 
to have side eff ects that can hinder their compliance and the overall efficacy of OIT, which is a 
concern as is the re -sensitization upon cessation of peanut intake . It is known that allergic response 
to food is an IgE -mediated event; however, recent data suggest that IL -4 and IL -13 may also play 
a significant role in food allergy pathogenesis . This clinical study proposes to examine the effect 
of dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody, which blocks the action of these cytokines, to enhance the 
safety, tolerability, and efficacy  of AR101 (oral biologic drug) in subjects with significant allergy 
to peanuts.  
The immune system in the gut actively induces an immune tolerant state to the proteins that are 
normally consumed . Food allergy occurs when the body has a break in this toleran ce, which results 
in an abnormal immune reaction to food . Peanut allergy is an immunoglobulin E (IgE) -mediated 
hypersensitivity reaction following the ingestion of normally innocuous peanut protein . 
Cross -linking of peanut -specific IgE (sIgE) bound to high  affinity IgE receptors on mast cells and 
basophils triggers immediate degranulation. Subsequent release of a diverse array of inflammatory 
mediators results in severe allergic symptoms such as hives, wheezing, vomiting and, in severe 
cases, anaphylactic s hock . Release of these mediators also initiates Type 2 T -helper cell (Th2) 
cytokine release, which results in eosinophil infiltration and creates a vicious cycle of chronic 
allergic inflammation . Like other forms of allergy immunotherapy, OIT to peanut inv olves a slow 
up-dosing of exposure to allergen, in this case peanut, over time to desensitize or increase the 
threshold of reactivity to peanut . Once reaching a target level of peanut protein, subjects are 
continued on a maintenance dose of peanut protein to maintain desensitization . Although many 
subjects on a maintenance dose of peanut protein have demonstrated desensitization to peanut 
(ie, the ability to tolerate a level of exposure to peanut without an allergic reaction), up to 80% of 
subjects exhibit related adverse events (AEs) during OIT, with 42% experiencing systemic 
reactions and 49% experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms; the majority of these are mild and 
decline with prolonged treatment ( Virkud, 2016 ). Up to 20% of su bjects, however, are unable to 
complete the up -dosing regimen due to side effects, which are primarily GI related . An additional 
issue with current OIT is its limited ability to induce clinical tolerance when subjects are taken off 
daily peanut intake ( Vickery, 2014 ). In many of the studies with peanut OIT, despite years of 
immunotherapy, subjects never achieve tolerance and are re -sensitized within weeks of halting 
daily peanut intake, with a small percentage (~10%) maintaining a sust ained unresponsiveness 
even after 3 months off OIT.

CONFIDENTIAL  Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against interleukin (IL) -4 receptor alpha 
(IL-4Rα), blocks the activity of IL -4 and IL -13. These 2 cytokines are critical to the induction and 
perpetu ation of the Type 2 response and have been implicated in multiple atopic diseases . 
Inhibiting both IL -4 and IL -13 signaling with dupilumab has demonstrated clinical efficacy in 
moderate -to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD), persistent, uncontrolled asthma, nas al polyposis, and 
is currently being investigated in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). It is known that oral allergen 
up-dosing during OIT induces up -regulation of IL -4 and IL -13 as well as other Type 2 
inflammatory cytokines and pathway activity, which cont ribute to dose -limiting side effects of 
OIT such as GI (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain), respiratory (wheezing and 
shortness of breath), and skin (generalized rash, pruritus, and angioedema) symptoms . In addition, 
IL-4 and IL -13 induce isoty pe class switching to IgE and production of allergen -specific IgE.  
This study will explore whether dupilumab has the ability to enhance immunomodulatory effects 
of OIT by decreasing Type 2 responses, decreasing production of peanut -specific IgE, which will  
result in improved safety and tolerability of OIT up -dosing as well as improved efficacy as 
determined by the ability to tolerate a higher cumulative dose of peanut protein during a double -
blind, placebo -controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) after 28 weeks o f dupilumab therapy 
compared to placebo . In addition, the study will evaluate whether dupilumab influences known 
biomarkers important in the allergic response such as a reduction in allergen -specific 
immunoglobulin sub -class switching to IgE, decrease in b asophil activation, and decreased 
Th2 cell activities and the associated cytokine/chemokine levels. A maintenance phase where 
subjects previously treated with dupilumab in the treatment period are randomized to continue to 
receive dupilumab (indefinite [co ntinuously]) with OIT or are re -randomized to placebo (limited 
[previously]) with OIT has been included.

CONFIDENTIAL  3. HYPOTHESIS AND RATIO NALE   
3.1. Hypothesis  
Treatment with dupilumab will improve the efficacy of OIT.  
3.2. Rationale  
3.2.1.  Rationale for Study  
This study will investigate whether addition of dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody 
directed against IL -4Rα, will improve OIT in subjects with peanut allergy . This study will seek to 
demonstrate that addition of dupilumab to AR101  will enhance the safety, tolerability, and efficacy 
of OIT . This will be determined by assessing whether treatment with dupilumab provides an 
enhanced ability to tolerate a higher cumulative dose of peanut protein during a food challenge 
after 6 months of treat ment compared to placebo, when given concomitantly with AR101 , and 
whether treatment with dupilumab allows for more rapid up -dosing of peanut during 
desensitization . The differences in safety and tolerability will be assessed through an evaluation of 
treatment differences in AEs and study drop -out rates.  
Oral immunotherapy has demonstrated efficacy in desensitizing food -allergic subjects by 
promoting physiologic changes, which suppress an allergic response to the ingested food antigen. 
Desensitization is de fined as the ability to tolerate a higher threshold of food allergen without an 
allergic reaction, while consuming the food regularly . The first open -label clinical trial of peanut 
protein OIT showed that OIT could successfully induce desensitization in pe anut-allergic subjects, 
with a favorable side -effect profile and low rates of anaphylaxis ( Jones 2009 ). A 20 -fold or greater 
improvement in DBPCFC -tolerated peanut dose compared to baseline after up -dosing to 800 mg 
per day over 6  months was demonstrated with minimal responses in placebo -treated subjects 
(Anagnostou  2014 ). A high proportion of individuals who achieve desensitization develop clinical 
reactivity within 3  months if peanut treatment is stopped ( Vickery, 2014 ) (Syed, 2014 ). Persistent 
adverse reactions, primarily GI related, lead to OIT termination in 20% of subjects ( Narisety, 2015 ) 
(Virkud, 2016 ). Three hundr ed mg/day of peanut protein can be safely ingested by 20  to 34  weeks 
and 1200 mg/day by 30 to 58 weeks . Most AEs occur in the first 12  weeks (76%  GI, 
7% respiratory, and 14% skin) delaying up -dosing to 300 mg/day in these subjects for 12  weeks . 
Peanut anti gen-specific Th2 cells express the highest levels of IL -4 and IL -13 in subjects with the 
highest rate of allergic AEs ( Syed,  2014 ). 
AR101 (Aimmune) is an immunotherapy that consists of an oral peanut protein formulation that 
was evalu ated in a double -blind placebo -controlled phase 2 study in 55 pediatric and adult subjects 
who were highly reactive to peanut . Subjects were started on an oral peanut dose of 3  mg on a 
single day and were then escalated to a maintenance dose of 300 mg/day by approximately 
week  22. After 22 weeks of treatment, 23 of the 29 subjects (79%, intent -to-treat [ITT]) assigned 
to OIT (6 dropped out because of GI side effects) tolerated 443 mg (cumulative) (equivalent to 
approximately 1.5 peanut kernels) of peanut pr otein, and 18 of the 29 subjects (62%, ITT) were 
able to tolerate 1043 mg (cumulative) (equivalent to 4 peanut kernels) . Among the 26 subjects in 
the placebo group, only 5 (19%, ITT) could tolerate 443 mg of peanut protein, and none was able 
to reach the 1 043 mg challenge dose ( Bird 2015 ).

CONFIDENTIAL  The open -label follow on study ARC002 evaluated the safety and efficacy of AR101 OIT in 
47 eligible peanut -allergic subjects who participated in the ARC001 originating study . Former 
placebo -treate d subjects began AR101 up -dosing to 300 mg/day, followed by 2 weeks of daily 
dosing at 300 mg/day, and a post up -dosing DBPCFC . At the post up -dosing DBPCFC, former 
placebo -treated subjects exhibited a high rate of desensitization, with 20 of 21 subjects (95%) 
tolerating the 443 mg cumulative dose of peanut protein . No moderate or severe AEs were 
reported, and no subject required epinephrine . These findings are consistent with those of the 
originating study exit DBPCFC in AR101 -treated subjects . A total of  40 subjects overall, in both 
the former placebo -treated and AR101 -treated groups, entered a 12 -week maintenance period at 
300 mg/day, followed by a post maintenance DBPCFC . After 9  months of AR101 treatment 
(6 months up -dosing, 3 additional months of 300 mg/day of maintenance), 73% of subjects (ITT) 
tolerated 443 mg (cumulative), 65% tolerated 1043 mg (cumulative) and 44% tolerated 2043 mg 
(cumulative) peanut protein DBPCFC . Moderate or severe AEs were reported in a minority of 
subjects at the 2 highest do ses. Two subjects each required a single dose of epinephrine 
(AR101  Investigator Brochure) .  
A retrospective cohort analysis was also performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy profile of 
AR101 in relation to baseline peanut -specific IgE . Subjects were grouped by peanut -specific 
IgE levels of ≤100 kUA/L or >100 kUA/L . All subjects in both groups tolerated at least 443 mg 
cumulative of peanut protein . However, the 2 groups had different tolerance to higher doses of 
peanut -specific protein:  1043 mg of cum ulative peanut protein was tolerated by 21 subjects (91%) 
in the ≤100 kUA/L group and 15  subjects (88%) in the >100 kUA/L group; 2043  mg of cumulative 
peanut protein was tolerated by 17 subjects (74%) in the ≤100 kUA/L group and 7  subjects (17%) 
in the >10 0 kUA/L group ( Wang 2016 ). 
In the phase 3 AR101 study (PALISADE) in which the prespecified primary analysis was children 
aged 4 to 17 years (n=496) with peanut allergy, subjects were started on an oral peanut dose of 
3 mg on a single day and were then escalated to a maintenance dose of 300 mg/day during an 
up-dosing period of approximately 6 months, which was followed by a 6 month double -blind 
maintenance phase. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects tolerating 1043 mg 
(cumulative) peanut protein in the exit DBPCFC; 67.2% of the 372 subjects (ITT) treated with 
peanut OIT tolerated 1043 mg (cumulative) peanut protein compared to 4.0% of the 124 subjects 
treated with placebo. Those tolerating 2043 mg (cumulative) peanut prote in, a key secondary 
efficacy endpoint, were 50.3% and 2.4% for peanut OIT and placebo, respectively. Of the 
AR101 -treated subjects, a total of 76 (20.4%) discontinued, with 46 (12.4%) related to AEs. 
Treatment with AR101 was associated with a marked reduct ion in the IgE/IgG4 ratio from 
approximately 100 to <10, whereas an increase was noted in the subjects treated with placebo. 
Similarly, wheal size in the skin prick test (SPT) was reduced compared to placebo by 
AR101  treatment ( PALISADE Group of Clinical Investigators, 2018 ). 
Other investigator -initiated studies have also demonstrated the safety and efficacy of peanut 
protein OIT . These studies suggest that higher levels of peanut protein tolerated at a maintenance 
dose provide a  greater protection in a DBPCFC . For example, a prospective cohort study of peanut 
OIT, in which 22  children received a maintenance dosing of 800 mg/day of peanut protein for 
32 weeks demonstrated a significant increase in peanut challenge threshold, with 86% of subjects 
tolerating up -dosing and 14/22 (64%) tolerating 6600 mg (cumulative) of peanut protein at the 
completion of treatment ( Anagnostou 2011 ).

CONFIDENTIAL  The mechanisms by which OIT leads to clinical protection may include mast cell and basophil 
exhaustion or suppression, development of food -specific IgA and IgG4 blocking antibodies, 
increase in the peanut -specific IgG4/IgE ratio, up -regulation and expansion of Treg cells, a 
skewing from a Th2 to a Type 1 T -helper cell (Th1) profile, and the development of anergy and/or 
exhaustion in Th2  antigen -specific cells  (Syed, 2014 ) (Vickery, 2013 ) (Gorelik,  2015 ) 
(Santos,  2015 ).  
The use of omalizumab (m onoclonal anti -IgE antibody) as an adjunct therapy to peanut protein 
OIT has been shown to significantly increase the threshold of reactivity in peanut -allergic subjects 
(MacGinnitie 2016 ). Omalizumab decreased the allergic r esponse by binding to free circulating 
IgE molecules and reducing IgE -mediated mast cell and basophil degranulation on allergen 
exposure . Omalizumab allows more rapid desensitization to higher doses of peanut but does not 
affect long -term efficacy ( MacGinnitie 2016 ). Therefore, there is an unmet need for a safer, more 
rapid, and more reliable adjunct to OIT treatment of peanut allergy that provides lasting protection.  
3.2.2.  Rationale for Study Design  
AR101, with and without dup ilumab, will be tested in a 2 -arm, double -blind, randomized, 
parallel -group study in subjects with confirmed peanut allergy . Pediatric subjects will be enrolled 
as children represent the majority of subjects with peanut allergy and are a greater risk for 
accidental ingestion of peanut. Dupilumab/placebo treatment for 28 to 40 weeks as an adjunct to 
24 to 36 weeks of daily AR101 treatment will be evaluated, followed by maintenance period of 
24 weeks of daily AR101 treatment with concomitant dupilumab or plac ebo. Two treatment 
groups are required to provide informative controls and minimize bias on clinical endpoints:  
dupilumab plus AR101  and placebo plus AR101 . Subjects will be treated for 28 to 40 weeks with 
either Q2W subcutaneous (SC) dupilumab or placebo . After the first 4  weeks of pretreatment, 
subjects will begin a 24 to 36 week up -dosing regimen of daily oral AR101 . The study will assess 
an up -dosing regimen up to a maximum of 300 mg/day over the following 24 to 36 weeks of the 
study. If the scheduled bi-weekly up -dosing is not possible, the up -dosing period may be extended 
by up to 12  weeks (optional visits 15a -f) if necessary to accommodate dose reductions and re -
escalation as well as COVID -19 restrictions of in -clinic visits. Thus, the up -dosing peri od will end 
at week  28 to 40 (including 4 weeks pretreatment, 22 to 34 weeks of flexible up -dosing, and at 
least 2 weeks at the maximum dose).  
Subjects who achieve 300 mg daily dose of AR101 for at least 2  weeks at visit 16 (ie, the end of 
the up -dosing pe riod, week 28 to 40) will enter a 24 -week maintenance period. Subjects treated 
with dupilumab during the up -dosing period and who achieve 300 mg/day AR101 for at least 
2 weeks  will be re -randomized to 2 groups, AR101 plus dupilumab (indefinite [continuousl y]) and 
AR101 plus placebo (limited [previously]); this will allow an assessment of a lasting or limited 
effect of dupilumab. Subjects treated with placebo during the up -dosing period and who achieve 
300 mg daily AR101 for at least 2 weeks will continue to  be treated with placebo plus AR101 
during  the maintenance period.  
This design allows for a direct comparison between adjunct dupilumab plus AR101 to placebo 
plus AR101 during the 28 to 40 week double -blind treatment period . It will also evaluate the effec t 
of dupilumab in maintaining the response to AR101 , defined as an increase in the proportion of 
subjects who pass a DBPCFC .

CONFIDENTIAL  3.2.3.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
3.2.3.1.  Dose and Regimen for Dupilumab  
The approved dosing regimen in the treatment of AD in adults is 300 mg  SC Q2W . The doses 
selected for this study are consistent with the approved AD pediatric study plan doses for this age 
group and the doses being tested in the ongoing AD pediatric study, R668 -AD-1652 (6 to 
<12 years of age) .  
In study R668 -AD-1412, 78 chil dren aged 6 to 17 years received doses up to 4 mg/kg SC every 
week (QW) for 4 doses, where exposures similar to those in adults receiving 300 mg SC Q2W 
were achieved . Significant improvements in measures of AD were noted in these children, with an 
acceptab le safety profile . As with many monoclonal antibodies, weight is the most significant 
covariate affecting dupilumab pharmacokinetics . The weight -based doses chosen for treatment in 
this study are chosen such that subjects should achieve similar dupilumab e xposure in serum to 
that observed at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved adult dose for 
moderate -severe AD (300 mg SC Q2W), based on pharmacokinetic modeling of the data from 
study R668 -AD-1412 . The dupilumab SC dose will be 300 mg Q2W in child ren >60 kg following 
a loading dose of 600 mg on day 1 . Children who weigh 30 kg or more but less than 60 kg, will 
receive 200 mg Q2W following a loading dose of 400 mg on day 1 . Children weighing less than 
30 kg will receive 100 mg SC Q2W following a load ing dose of 200 mg on day 1 . Regardless of 
subject weight gain or loss, the dupilumab dosing regimen assigned at randomization on day 1 will 
be maintained throughout the study.  
Subcutaneous study drug will be dosed at home by the subject or by their legal guardian after 
adequate training (for subjects under 12 years old, legal guardian injections will be required) and 
at least 8  hours apart from the AR101 daily dose in order to allow for an accurate attribution of 
AE relatedness to study drug or AR101 . In addition, dupilumab/placebo must be given at least 
24 hours after in -clinic AR101 up -dosing.  
The administration of the loading dose of dupilumab will allow systemic concentrations to reach 
steady -state faster . Rapid attainment of target -saturating concentra tions may yield a rapid clinical 
response within a 4 -week period of dupilumab pretreatment by suppressing Type 2 effector cell 
function, which is believed to be responsible for the allergic GI side effects of OIT . Dupilumab 
blockade of IL4/IL13 in AD, an i mmune -driven disease, reduced skin lesions and suppressed at 
4 weeks the mRNA expression of genes related to T -cells, dendritic cells, eosinophils, 
inflammatory pathways, and Th2 -inducing chemokines, whereas increases or insignificant 
decreases were observ ed with placebo . The correlation between these mechanistic changes and 
rapid improvement in clinical measures of disease activity in adults with AD, including Eczema 
Area and Severity Index (EASI) and SCORing AD, support an AR101 study design with only 
4 weeks of dupilumab SC pretreatment ( Hamilton, 2014 ). Rapid improvements in forced 
expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and FeNO have also been observed within 4 weeks 
in dupilumab studies in adults with asthma ( Wenzel, 2013 ) (Wenzel 2016 ). The results in other 
indications suggest 4  weeks of dupilumab treatment significantly suppresses Type 2 -mediated 
responses.

CONFIDENTIAL  3.2.3.2.  Dose and Regimen for AR101 Oral Immunotherapy  
Concurrent with dupilumab dosing, subjects in the placebo plus AR101 and the dupilumab plus 
AR101 groups will begin at week 4, with Q2W up -dosing of AR101  beginning at 3 mg/day up to 
a maximum of 300  mg/day over 24 to 36 weeks ( Baum ert 2017 ). This 300 mg/day maintenance 
dosing regimen has previously been shown to provide significant clinical efficacy and consistent 
kinetics of the sIgG4 and sIgE response ( Bird 2015 ). The AR101  regimen t arget of 300 mg/day 
may be clinically effective for desensitization for accidental peanut exposure . The majority of 
allergic side effects (GI) occur during bi -weekly up -dosing at a peanut dose less than 100 mg/day 
(Nadeau et al,  POISED Peanut OIT Study; un published data).  
3.3. Safety Considerations (Risk -Benefit)  
Unlike many other childhood allergies, peanut allergy typically persists into adulthood and is 
associated with a higher incidence of severe anaphylaxis as compared with other food allergies 
(Dyer 2015 ). Although recent progress has been made in the treatment of food allergy through 
allergen -specific OIT, side effects often limit its full efficacy in many subjects and there is an 
unmet need for a new therapy in food allergy . It is known that allergic response to food is an 
IgE-mediated event; however, recent data suggest that the role of IL -4 and IL -13 may also play a 
significant role in food allergy pathogenesis . Consequently, dupilumab treatment, either alone or 
as an adjunct trea tment to OIT, would be expected to provide benefit by blocking the activity of 
IL-4 and IL -13 and decreasing Type 2 responses, decreasing production of peanut -specific IgE, 
and potentially increasing the peanut -specific IgG4  response.  
Note: Recognizing th at the “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID -19) pandemic will have an 
impact on the conduct of clinical trials, the sponsor does not intend to screen any subjects in this 
study until the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic is deemed manageable and no longer inter fering 
with the conduct of trials at individual sites, and subjects can safely participate in this study.  
3.3.1.  Risk -Benefit for Dupilumab  
At the time of writing this protocol, dupilumab 300 mg SC Q2W had been approved in the US, the 
European Union (EU), and se veral countries ex -US including Japan for the treatment of adults 
with moderate -to-severe AD . Marketing applications are under review in additional countries . 
Fourteen clinical studies (phases 1 through 3) of repeated -doses of dupilumab in AD patients have  
been completed . Dupilumab has demonstrated robust and consistent efficacy in completed clinical 
trials, across a variety of clinical outcomes, reflecting clinically meaningful and statistically 
significant improvement in AD signs, symptoms, and quality of  life, with sustained efficacy 
demonstrated to 52 weeks.  
Short term (4 weeks), 12 - and 16 -week treatment with repeated QW doses of SC  dupilumab (75, 
150, or 300 mg) monotherapy was well tolerated in adult patients with moderate -to-severe AD not 
adequately controlled with topical medications . Similar results were observed with dupilumab 300 
mg SC QW administered concomitantly with topical corticosteroid in study  R668 -AD-1121.

CONFIDENTIAL  exacerbations are an important safety concern for immunotherapy . In these studies, treatment with 
dupilumab at all doses tested was generally well tolerated with a favorable safety profile.  
The first clinical study of dupilumab in pediatric patients aged 6 years to <18 years old with AD 
has been completed . Data generated from th is study showed that dupilumab administered as single 
and repeated weekly doses was generally well tolerated and had an acceptable safety profile similar 
to that for adults in both pediatric age groups included in this study (6 to 11 years and 12 to 
<18 years). There were no new safety signals detected with dupilumab in this pediatric population . 
Most of the AEs reported were mild in intensity, transient in nature, and not related to the study 
drug. Both SC dose regimens of dupilumab evaluated (2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg) showed significant 
clinical benefit in both pediatric age groups.  
As of March 2018, approximately 600 pediatric AD (n=407) and asthma (n=196) patients have 
been exposed to dupilumab in completed and ongoing clinical studies .  
3.3.2.  Risk -Benefit for Pea nut Protein  
AR101 has been approved in the US as a monotherapy for peanut allergy. Based on previously 
published studies, approximately 80%, 15%, and <1% of the subjects are expected to have a 
reversible mild, moderate, or severe allergic symptom, respecti vely, during dosing with peanut . 
Allergic symptoms may include sneezing, rhinorrhea, urticaria, angioedema, flushing, flares of 
eczema, ocular, nasal, oral and/or throat pruritus, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, 
stridor/laryngeal edema, cough, whee zing, and/or shortness of breath in addition to severe 
anaphylaxis.  
The only major atypical AE reported in the literature related to OIT has been several reported cases 
of EoE . In adult patients with EoE, treatment with dupilumab has shown clinical improv ement of 
dysphagia symptoms and histology.  
Oral food challenges may induce a severe life -threatening allergic reaction; however, the risk can 
be greatly mitigated by conducting the challenges in a highly monitored setting and by initiating 
the challenge wi th a very small amount of the food, gradually increasing the dose, and stopping 
the challenge at the first sign of a reaction . If subjects develop an allergic reaction during the 
challenges, they may need oral, intramuscular (IM), or intravenous (IV) medic ations . Additionally, 
IV catheters may be placed, at physician discretion for any visit, based on factors such as previous 
reactions, recent clinical history, and clinical status observed at the visit . Trained personnel, 
including a study physician, as wel l as medications and equipment, will be immediately available 
to treat any reaction . The anticipated rate of life -threatening anaphylactic reactions is <0.1% . There 
may be a risk that during the study, subjects may decrease their vigilance against accident al food 
allergen ingestion because they believe they are protected from it . Therefore, subjects will be 
warned that they should continue to practice their usual vigilance against accidental ingestion of 
food allergens or food allergen -containing foods and be reminded to carry their epinephrine 
autoinjector at all times.  
The potential benefit of peanut oral immunotherapy to desensitize peanut allergic subjects is 
outlined in Section  3.2.1 .

CONFIDENTIAL  5. STUDY VARIABLES  
5.1. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Baseline characteristics will include standard demography (eg, age, race, weight, height, 
co-morbid atopic conditions, year s with food allergy disease, sex, etc), disease characteristics 
including medical history, and medication history for each subject.  
5.2. Efficacy Variables  
Efficacy variables will include the DBPCFC, the peanut SPT, EASI for subjects with AD, 
asthma control que stionnaire (ACQ -5 or Juniper ACQ) for subjects with asthma, daily allergy 
symptoms (recorded in an e -diary), and food allergy quality of life questionnaires.  
5.3. Safety Variables  
Safety variables will include vital signs, spirometry (FEV1 and/or peak expirator y flow [PEF]), 
hematology and chemistry, urinalysis, and AEs.  
5.4. Pharmacokinetic Variables  
Concentration of functional dupilumab in serum at each time point, obtained prior to dosing, will 
be considered to be trough values (C trough.time point ) 
5.5. Anti -Drug Antib ody Variables  
Anti-drug antibody (ADA) variables include ADA status,  titer, NAb status, and  time point/visit.  
5.6. Pharmacodynamic and Biomarker Variables  
Pharmacodynamic and biomarker variables are:  
Serum Total IgE:  Serum total IgE is a marker of Type 2 activi ty. Dupilumab significantly 
suppressed total IgE in studies of adult AD, nasal polyposis, and asthma patients.  
Serum Peanut -Specific Antibody Assays (IgE,  IgG, IgG4 against peanut extract and peanut 
protein allergen components): The induction of peanut all ergen specific IgG4 during OIT has 
been reported in multiple studies . In a 5 -year peanut OIT study of 39 peanut -allergic children, 
increases in total peanut -specific IgG levels were reported during the 12 -month up -dosing period 
(Vickery 2014 ). In an open -label study of 29  peanut -allergic children, peanut -specific IgG4 
increased steadily during the first year of treatment, reaching 3.5 -fold increase over baseline after 
3 months of OIT and roughly 10 -fold increase at the end of firs t year ( Jones 2009 ). In the same 
study, peanut allergen specific IgE was seen to increase by ~3 -fold after 3 months of OIT and 
gradually return to baseline at one year.  
In study R668 -AD-1307 and other dupilumab studies in adults, dupi lumab suppressed both total 
and allergen -specific IgEs . In general, dupilumab suppresses total IgE by ~50% with 12 to 
16 weeks of treatment.

CONFIDENTIAL  Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide: Asthma is a common comorbidity in peanut allergic children, 
reported to be between  40%-60% by different groups . While peanut allergic children often 
outgrow co -existing asthma symptoms, eosinophilic airway inflammation usually persists and is 
directly associated with anaphylactic reactions to peanut . Fractional exhaled nitric oxide is a  
non-invasive marker that has been shown to correlate with allergic airway inflammation and IgE 
sensitization . In a study of 94 peanut -allergic children, elevated FeNO levels (>35 ppb) were found 
in over 75% of the subjects ( Hughes,  2010 ). Additionally, baseline FeNO level (pre -OFC) has 
been reported to be comparable to peanut SPT at predicting clinical outcomes in oral food 
challenge to peanut ( Preece, 2014 ). In a 12 -month study enrolling 56 subjects with pea nut allergy, 
FeNO measurement demonstrated superior reproducibility (Intra -class Correlation 
Coefficient  =0.73) in comparison to peanut SPT (Intra -class Correlation Coefficient =0.51) 
(Percival, 2016 ). In this study, we aim to use F eNO (pre -DBPCFC) as a measure of persistent 
airway eosinophilic inflammation in peanut -allergic children . In past asthma studies, dupilumab 
significantly lowered FeNO levels in adult and adolescent asthma patients, thus we hypothesize 
that dupilumab treatm ent will suppress FeNO levels in peanut allergic children . It is highly likely 
that peanut exposure during peanut DBPCFC in these subjects may trigger an increase in FeNO 
levels and asthmatic symptoms . Therefore, on the day of DBPCFC, FeNO levels will be m easured 
both before and after the oral challenge to assess whether dupilumab may suppress the airway 
inflammation associated with DBPCFC, as reflected by induction of FeNO after the oral challenge.  
During the COVID -19 pandemic, measurements of FeNO no long er need to be completed (at the 
discretion of the investigator).  
Basophil Sensitivity Test (optional): Basophils are one cell type involved in acute allergic 
reaction . CD203c and CD63 have been shown to be increased in basophils from peanut -allergic 
subje cts compared to non -allergic healthy controls . The utility of the Basophil Activation Test 
(BAT) was assessed for diagnosing peanut allergy in a well -characterized population of 
peanut -allergic, peanut -sensitized, and non -sensitized children . The BAT showe d high accuracy 
(97%) in diagnosing peanut allergy . In a study of omalizumab (anti -IgE) in peanut allergic 
subjects, CD203c expression in the BAT decreased during treatment and returned to pretreatment 
levels after cessation of treatment ( Gernez, 2011 ). However, as a flow cytometry -based test, the 
CD203c or CD63 median fluorescence intensity reading is intrinsically highly variable . As an 
improvement to the traditional BAT, the basophil sensitivity test measures the minimum amount 
of peanut extract required to activate basophils in subject whole blood, as measured by 
up-regulation of CD203c and CD63 . Basophil sensitivity to other allergens may also be tested . 
The results of these exploratory tests will not be presented in the clinical  study report (CSR).  
Peanut -reactive Th2A cells (Optional):  One important area of investigation is to determine the 
effect of dupilumab on allergic T -cell responses as an adjunct during AR101 treatment. At week 
4 (300 mg QW or Q2W) dupilumab effectively re duced CD3+ T -cells in AD skin lesions and 
suppressed Th2 inflammatory pathway genes (eg CCL13, CCL17 and CCL18), as shown by past 
studies in atopic dermatitis ( Hamilton, 2014 ; Guttman -Yassky, 2019 ). These data in dicate that 
dupilumab has direct suppressive effect on Th2 cells. However, due to the extreme low frequency 
of allergen -specific T -cells in circulation, conventional immunophenotyping of Th2 cells has not 
been successful in capturing changes in allergen -specific T -cells during specific immunotherapy. 
Th2A cells are allergen -specific Th2 cells with characteristic surface marker signatures (CRTH2+, 
CD27 -, CD154+, CD161+, CD45RB - and CD49d+) ( Wambre, 2017 ). Using these markers,

CONFIDENTIAL  Wambre et al showed a reduction in the frequency of pro -allergic Th2A cell subsets from subjects 
receiving AR101, but not in the placebo group in Aimmune's Phase II study. Th2A subset of T -
cells were also shown to be secreting higher levels of IL -4, IL -5, and IL -9, and were thus postulated 
to be a key pathogenic driver of allergic -T cell response. Therefore, monitoring peanut -reactive 
Th2A cells may reveal important mechanistic insight into the amelioration of allergic symptoms 
by dupilumab as an adjunct to AR101 (pe anut oral immunotherapy).  
5.7. Other Exploratory Research (Optional)  
Blood may be obtained for additional exploratory tests such as whole blood stimulation with 
CD3/CD28 in the TruCulture® system and flow cytometry -based immune -phenotyping on type -2 
allergic T -cells. Blood samples collected for exploratory research will be kept for up to 15 years 
for studying the allergen response ex -vivo. In subjects who consent/assent, peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells may be collected for RNA sequencing and RNA expression studies . The results 
of these exploratory tests will not be presented in the CSR.

CONFIDENTIAL  6. STUDY DESIGN  
6.1. Study Description and Duration  
This is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, p arallel -group, 2 -arm study in subjects 
aged 6 to 17 years inclusive who are allergic to peanut . The study consists of a screening period 
of up to 16 weeks; a 28 to 40 week double -blind treatment period, which includes 4 weeks of 
pretreatment with dupilumab  or placebo followed by 24 to 36 weeks of treatment with dupilumab 
or placebo in combination with a gradual up -dosing of AR101; a 24 -week maintenance phase with 
300 mg/day AR101 with concomitant dupilumab or matching placebo (for subjects who achieve 
300 m g/day AR101 for at least 2 weeks in the up -dosing period); and a 12 -week post -treatment 
follow -up period ( Figure  1). Subjects who do not achieve 300 mg/ day will still enter the 12 -week 
follow -up. Visit windows should be adhered to as per the schedule of events, which contains 
flexibility in the screening and up -dosing periods to accommodate dose reductions and re -
escalation as well as COVID -19 restriction s of in -clinic visits.  
All AR101 dose escalation will need to be done in -clinic. If the scheduled bi -weekly up -dosing is 
not possible, the up -dosing period may be extended by up to 12 weeks (optional visits 15a -f) if 
necessary to accommodate dose reductions and re -escalation as well as COVID -19 restrictions of 
in-clinic visits. If necessary, subjects may continue on a dose beyond the planned 2 -week duration 
during the up -dosing period. If a temporary hold on up -dosing of AR101 is needed (current do se 
maintained), the investigator should follow up with the subjects via telephone call to evaluate 
safety and administration at current dose .  
The duration of the study is approximately 64 to 76 weeks, excluding the screening period, for 
subjects who enter  the maintenance period, and 40 to 52 weeks, excluding the screening period, 
for subjects who do not achieve 300  mg/day AR101 for at least 2 weeks at visit 16 and do not enter 
the maintenance period.

CONFIDENTIAL  Screening  
After obtaining informed consent/assent, subjects will be assessed for eligibility during a 2 -part 
screening period . During screening visit 1 (day -113 to day -17), subjects will undergo a medical 
history, physical examin ation, spirometry, peanut SPT, and laboratory testing (including peanut 
sIgE), and will be evaluated for the study eligibility criteria. Subjects must meet all eligibility for 
screening visit 1 before proceeding with the DBPCFC in visit 1a.  
During screenin g visit 1a (must be before day -15), under direct study -investigator monitoring, 
subjects will undergo a screening DBPCFC to confirm current peanut allergy . This will consist of 
5 doses of peanut protein given every 15 to 30 minutes in increasing amounts u p to a cumulative 
total of 144 mg of peanut protein . Vital signs will be assessed every 15 to 30 minutes . If the study 
team suspects a reaction may be developing, they may exercise their clinical judgement to separate 
doses by up to an additional 30 minute s (1-hour maximum between doses) . The matching placebo 
challenge will consist of placebo material (oat protein) given also in 5 doses . The food challenges 
will be performed on different days (1 -day placebo [oat] protein, 1 -day peanut protein, with order 
determined at random) at least 24 hours apart . The doses will be 1, 3, 10, 30 and 100  mg of peanut 
protein (or placebo). Both food challenge days (placebo and peanut) must be done. Any subject 
who is assessed to have had dose -limiting symptoms to the placebo  part, or both parts, of the 
screening DBPCFC (ie, to oat flour as well as peanut flour) will be considered a screen failure and 
will not be randomized . Investigator/site personnel will be unblinded only to the results of the 
screening food challenge upon completion of the second part of the challenge to assess eligibility . 
All other food challenges in the study will remain blinded.  
Before each challenge, the subject will have a physical assessment by a trained physician’s 
assistant, registered nurse, nurse  practitioner, and/or physician of the study team who is blinded to 
the testing material . The supervising investigator will also be blinded to testing material.  
Reactions will be scored using the Consortium of Food Allergy Research (CoFAR) grading system 
(see Appendix  2). The DBPCFC will be stopped when the  blinded assessor finds symptoms and/or 
signs that indicate a definite objective allergic reaction (CoFAR grading system [see Appendix  2]) 
has occurred based on clinically significant changes in reported symptoms, physical findings, or 
vital signs that the subject is experiencing to the challenge material . The subject will be observed 
for a minimum of 2 hours after the final administered dose and discharged only when deemed 
clinically stable by a study physician . All food challenges will be performed under physician 
supervision . If the subject has no symptoms related to allergic reactions to the peanut ingestion 
with the DBPCFC ≤144 mg (cumulative) peanut protein or if he/she experiences any symptoms at 
any dose of placebo, he/she will not be enrolled in the study. A 2 -week washout period is needed 
after the peanut screening DBPCFC day, before subject can proceed with  randomization visit.  
Double -Blind Treatment Period (28 to 40 Weeks Duration)  
Subjects with a history of confirmed peanut allergy signs and symptoms who continue to meet 
eligibility criteria at baseline will undergo day 1/baseline assessments and will be randomized in 
a 2:1 ratio stratified by screening peanut -specific IgE level (≤100 kUA/L or >100 kUA/L) and 
body weight (<30 kg, ≥30 kg and <60 kg, or ≥60 kg) at randomization into 1 of 2 treatment arms

CONFIDENTIAL  (n=52 for placebo and 104 for dupilumab) . A minimum of  15 subjects for each weight group will 
be enrolled.  
Dupilumab and placebo will be dosed SC as follows based on weight at randomization and dose 
will not be changed regardless of weight gain or loss:  
• subjects weighing <30 kg will receive dupilumab 100 mg Q 2W following a loading dose 
of 200 mg on day 1 or matching placebo Q2W (including doubling the amount on day 1)  
• subjects weighing ≥30 kg and <60 kg will receive dupilumab 200 mg Q2W following a 
loading dose of 400 mg on day 1 or matching placebo Q2W (inclu ding doubling the 
amount on day 1)  
• subjects weighing ≥60 kg will receive dupilumab 300 mg Q2W following a loading dose 
of 600 mg on day 1 or matching placebo Q2W (including doubling the amount on day 1)  
After the first 4 weeks of pretreatment, subjects will begin AR101 with an up -dosing regimen to a 
maximum of 300 mg/day over the next 24 to 36 weeks of the study, for a total of 28 to 40 weeks 
(including pretreatment), with 28 weeks being ideal and 40 weeks being the maximum. The 
flexible up -dosing period  is to accommodate dose reductions and re -escalation as well as 
COVID -19 restrictions of in -clinic visits. Thus, the 28 to 40 week up -dosing period will consist of 
4 weeks pretreatment, 22 to 34 weeks of flexible up -dosing, and at least 2 weeks at the maxi mum 
dose of 300 mg/day.  
During concomitant AR101, study drug will be administered SC at home (at least 24 hours after 
in-clinic AR101 dose escalation and at least 8 hours apart from the at -home daily AR101 dose) . 
After ingestion of AR101, subject should be  monitored for 2 hours for allergic reaction. All 
subjects will complete up to visit 15 of the up -dosing period. Visits 15a -f will be conducted as 
needed in order to achieve 300 mg/day AR101 for 2 weeks. Subjects will undergo a post up -dosing 
DBPCFC at vis it 16 if they have reached 300 mg/day for at least 2 weeks (on a day after the last 
dose of AR101). Dosing with AR101 should continue on the days between the 2 parts of the 
DBPCFC .

After 28 to 40  weeks of dupilumab treatment and 24 to 36 weeks of AR101, subjects who 
achieve 300 mg/day of AR101 for at least 2 weeks will undergo a DBPCFC to assess the level of 
peanut sensitivity.  
Re-Randomization at Week 28 to 40 for Dupilumab Group  
Subjects in the dupilumab treatment group from the up -dosing phase will be re -randomized 
1:1 placebo or dupilumab regardless of whether they achieve 300 mg/day AR101 for at least 
2 weeks at visit 16 or discontinue . However, only those subjects who achieve 300 mg/day AR101  
at visit 16 will be eligible to enter the maintenance phase . Subjects who do not achieve 300  mg/day 
AR101 for at least 2 weeks will enter a 12 -week follow -up period. All subjects will have an 
interactive web response system (IWRS) transaction to maintain the blind.  
Double -Blind Maintenance Phase (Only for Subjects Who Reach 300 mg/Day AR101)  
Subjects who achieve 300 mg/day AR101 for at least 2 weeks during the up -dosing period will be 
eligible to enter a 24 -week maintenance phase in which all subjects will  continue to receive AR101 
300 mg/day at home. The 24 -week maintenance duration will start from when the subject has their 
day 1 of their post up -dosing DBPCFC at visit 16. (S afety analysis of the maintenance period starts 
after the second day of the visit  16 post up -dosing DBPCFC.) Subjects will have a monthly clinic 
visit. If the on -site clinic visit cannot occur, phone visits can take place as long as there are no 
changes to the subject’s AR101 dose. Subjects in the dupilumab treatment group will be rand omly 
assigned to either continue dupilumab at the same dose as administered during the up -dosing

CONFIDENTIAL  period or to receive placebo . Subjects who received placebo during the up -dosing phase will 
continue to receive placebo in the maintenance phase . After 24 week s of AR101 and 24 weeks of 
dupilumab or placebo, subjects will undergo a post maintenance DBPCFC to assess the level of 
peanut sensitivity at the end of the maintenance period.  
Subjects who do not achieve 300 mg/day AR101 for at least 2 weeks at visit 16 a nd are not 
permitted to enter the maintenance phase, will enter a 12 -week follow -up period (see below). The 
procedure for monitoring subjects for safety after in -clinic dosing is the same as for the up -dosing 
visits except that the initial period required for post -dose observation may be shortened to 
30 minutes.  
Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Food Challenge  
At visit 16 (the end of up -dosing) under intensive monitoring, all subjects who achieve 300 mg/day 
AR101 during the up -dosing phase for at least 2 wee ks will undergo a post up -dosing DBPCFC 
up to 2044 mg (cumulative) peanut protein or placebo (see Appendix  1) to assess desensitization . 
At visit 22  (the end of maintenance period), all subjects who maintain 300 mg/day AR101 will 
undergo a post maintenance DBPCFC up to 2044 mg (cumulative) peanut protein or placebo to 
assess desensitization . Dosing with AR101 should continue on the days between the 2 parts of the 
DBPCFC . The subject’s sensitivity to peanut allergen is defined as the dose at which the subject 
experiences allergic reactions . All symptoms and signs will be evaluated and rated based on a 
standardized oral food challenge scoring system (CoF AR) (see Appendix  2). Up-dosing during the 
DBPCFC will be stopped when the blinded assessor finds symptoms and/or signs that indicate a 
definite obje ctive (Grade 1 [mild]) allergic reaction (CoFAR grading system [see  Appendix  2]) 
has occurred based on clinically significant changes in reported sy mptoms, physical findings, or 
vital signs that the subject is experiencing to the challenge material . Vital signs will be assessed 
every 15 to 30 minutes . In addition, subjects will be considered to have dose -limiting reactions if 
they experience any mild subjective reactions requiring pharmacologic intervention and/or any 
moderate/severe reaction . The DBPCFC will consist of 8 doses (peanut protein or placebo), given 
every 15 to 30 minutes: 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 600, 1000 mg resulting in a total challenge  of up to 
2044  mg (cumulative) peanut protein . Both peanut and oat protein will be concealed in a food that 
masks the taste . The food challenges will be performed on different days (1 -day placebo [oat] 
protein, 1 -day peanut protein, with order determined a t random) at least 24  hours, but not more 
than 7 days, apart, and not within 24 hours of a dose of study drug . Subjects will be considered to 
have passed the DBPCFC if they do not experience any objective Grade 1 (mild) reaction by 
CoFAR grading system (se e Appendix  2). If the subject experiences reactions, he/she will be 
treated with the necessary rescue medications . In addition, subjects will be con sidered to have 
passed the DBPCFC if they do not experience any mild subjective symptoms requiring 
pharmacological intervention and/or moderate or severe symptoms . He/she will be observed for a 
minimum of 2  hours after the final administered dose and disch arged only when deemed clinically 
stable by a study physician . Symptom severity will be adjudicated by an independent, blinded 
assessor who is not involved in subject study visit conduct . When dosing elicits an acute reaction 
characterized by the appearanc e of only a mild subjective symptom or symptoms, the investigator 
will be required to assess whether the dose was or was not tolerated . The determination of 
tolerability must be made on the basis of clinical judgement . The following are presented as 
guidel ines for determining whether a dose associated with the emergence of a mild subjective

CONFIDENTIAL  symptom or symptoms was tolerated . A dose eliciting only mild subjective symptoms may be 
considered to be tolerated if the symptoms are:  
• Isolated to a single organ syste m except for airway (including tongue) or respiratory 
system  
• Resolve with no pharmaceutical intervention or with a single oral administration of an 
H1 antihistamine  
• Do not require administration of epinephrine  
• Are not worsening in intensity or distribution over time  
• Resolve, or shows definite signs of resolving, in under 1 hour  
On the day following DBPCFC, the site is to make telephone contact with the subject/subject’s 
parent or guardian to inquire if any AEs (including allergic symptoms) occurred subsequent to the 
subject leaving the clinic, and to provide assistance in the recording of any such events.  
Post-Treatment Follow -Up Period (12 Weeks)  
All subjects will have a 12 -week follow -up period after the end o f treatment and will undergo 
safety, laboratory, and clinical assessments.  
The duration of the 12 -week follow -up period is based on the time expected for drug levels to fall 
below the lower limit of quantification after the last dose of dupilumab . At the e nd of the 12 -week 
follow -up period, subjects who passed a 444 mg (cumulative) peanut protein DBPCFC at visit 22 
(the end of the maintenance period, week 52 to 64 will be eligible to undergo a final DBPCFC (up 
to 2044 mg cumulative), under intensive monitor ing, at visit 25 (end of study, week 64 to 76) to 
assess the level of peanut sensitivity after 12 weeks off peanut and dupilumab to determine whether 
there is evidence of persistent effects and sustained unresponsiveness.  
Subjects who do not achieve 300 mg /day peanut protein at visit 16, (ideally week 28, and up to a 
maximum of week 40) will enter a 12 week follow -up period.  
6.1.1.  Description of AR101 Dose Escalation, and Study Stopping Rules  
6.1.1.1.  AR101 Initial Dose Escalation Day at Week 4  
The IDED will be done in -clinic at week 4 and consist of AR101 dosing, beginning at 0.5 mg of 
AR101 with graduated doses every 30  minutes up to 6 mg (cumulative 12 mg) over 5 hours (see 
Table  1 and Appendix  4). Subjects must be stable, with stable lung function, FEV1  >80% 
predicted, without evidence of wheezing on exam, or act ive allergic symptoms such as AD or 
symptoms of allergic rhinitis or any other symptoms that in the clinical judgement of the study 
physician contradicts initial dosing.  
Trained clinical staff will be present at all times during all of the in -clinic AR101 dosing visits and 
will be available to respond within minutes to any allergic reaction . Allergic events ( Appendix  2) 
will be monitored for at least 2  hours after the last dose or for at least 2 hours after resolution of 
symptoms prior to discharge from the clinic . Subjects tolerating the escalation dose will continue 
to administer a 3  mg/day dose at home for the next 14 days . Subjects who do not tolera te the 6  mg 
single dose (12 mg cumulative) during IDED, due to moderate or severe allergic reactions

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 51 of 118 
CONFIDENTIAL  (Appendix  4), will be considered treatment failures and will not initiate home AR101 dosing and 
should be early terminated from the study.  
6.1.1.2.  AR101 Up -Dosing Regimen Starting at Week 6  
Subjects in the place bo and dupilumab treatment groups will have bi -weekly in -clinic visits with 
bi-weekly dose increases of the daily oral home AR101 dose from 3 mg/day up to a maximum of 
300 mg/day by week 24 to 36 (see Table  2) depending on safety (see Appendix  5). Subjects who 
exhibit moderate symptoms ( Appendix  2) may have the dose reduced by 1 dose level per visit (ie, 
go back to the previous dose prior to new up -dose) until dose tolerated with no or mild sym ptoms 
(see Appendix  5). A dose reduction, at the investigator’s discretion, may also be implemented for 
an intercurrent adverse event. Subjects who e xhibit severe allergic symptoms ( Appendix  2 ) must 
be discontinued from study drug (see Appendix  5). 
Note: As of Amendment 3, the up -dosing period has been extended to accommodate dose 
reductions and re -escalation as well as COVID -19 restrictions of in -clinic visits . This 
extension permits a maximum up -dosing period of 40 weeks, while 28 weeks is ideal 
(consisting of 4 weeks pretreatment, 22 to 34 weeks of up -dosing, and at least 2 weeks at 
the maximum dose.)  
For chronic or recurrent GI symptoms, especially upper GI symptoms, investigators are  advised to 
establish a low threshold for instituting a dose reduction and for considering early discontinuation 
of affected subjects from the study due to the potential for EoE (see Section  6.1.2.5 ) following 
discussion with the medical monitor.  
Each AR101 dosing increase will be administered in -clinic and monitored for adverse allergic 
events for at least 2 hours prior to discharge . If the current d ose is maintained (ie,  subject remains 
at the same dose and not escalated to the new dose during the clinic visit), then the observation 
period can be shortened to 1 hour with subject being discharged if deemed clinically stable. Vital 
signs will be monito red every 15 to 30 minutes . Subjects/legal guardians will be instructed not to 
exceed the specifically assigned doses at home . They will also be instructed not to introduce any 
new foods to the diet and to avoid accidental ingestions . Subjects/legal guardi ans will be supplied 
with epinephrine autoinjectors for treatment of allergic reactions and 24 -hour access to an 
emergency contact telephone number.  
On the day following in -clinic AR101 up -dosing, the site is to make telephone contact with the 
subject/subj ect’s parent or guardian to inquire if any AEs (including allergic symptoms) occurred 
subsequent to the subject leaving the clinic, and to provide assistance in the recording of any such 
events in the diary.

to accommodate dose reductions and re -escalation as well as COVID -19 restrictions of in -clinic visits.  
6.1.2.  Study Design Safety Considerations for AR101  
• All up -dosing visits will be supervised in an in -clinic setting where trained study 
physicians are available . Subjects who exhibit moderate allergic symptoms 
(Appendix  2 for grading and treatment) may have the dose reduced to the previous dose 
(see Appendix  5). For chronic or recurrent GI symptoms, especially upper GI 
symptoms, investigators are advised to establish a low threshold for institut ing a dose 
reduction and for considering early discontinuation of affected subjects from the study 
due to the potential for EoE.  
• Standing orders from a study physician will be provided for all clinical study personnel 
to immediately (ie, prior to study phy sician notification) initiate treatment of reactions, 
including IM administration of epinephrine, based on their own clinical judgement.  
• A crash cart with pediatric equipment will be available in close proximity (within 
50 feet) of all subject clinic rooms . 
• A code team will be available.  
• Will only escalate to a maximum 6 mg AR101 single dose during the IDED, which has 
been determined in Aimmune phase 2 and 3 peanut protein OIT trials to be a level 
safely achieved in most subjects.

CONFIDENTIAL  • Subjects will be dosed bi -weekly SC at home with dupilumab or placebo on separate 
days (at least 24 hours) from the in -clinic AR101 dose escalation and at least 8 hours 
apart from ingesting their daily oral AR101 dose.  
• Dosing allergic symptoms and AEs will be captured throughout th e study.  
• Subjects will be prescribed an epinephrine autoinjector (if not prescribed by a treating 
clinician previous to study entry) and all subjects/legal guardian will be trained in its 
use. Subjects will be advised to carry the autoinjector with them at  all times.  
• Subjects/legal guardians will be cautioned against consuming any peanuts or peanut -
containing foods other than study -supplied food allergen while on study.  
• Subjects/legal guardians will be cautioned against vigorous exercise or hot 
showers/bath s within 1 hour prior to and 3 hours after AR101.  
• During the in -clinic dosing days, home dosing of AR101 should not occur.  
• An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will have oversight of subject 
safety (see Section  6.3.1  for more details).  
6.1.2.1.  Guidance for Home Dosing  
The subject should take the AR101 at approximately the same time each day and it should be taken 
as part of a meal . Dosing at evening  meal is recommended to permit children to be observed and 
supervised in the home setting by their parents or guardian for several hours after dosing. Subjects 
are to be cautioned against activities likely to increase allergic reactivity (eg,  exercising or  taking 
hot showers or baths within 3 hours after dosing). Dosing should not occur within 2 hours of 
bedtime. If dosing cannot be done in the evening, then it can be done with other meals as long as 
the subject can be observed for 2 hours for allergic reac tion. Additionally, if a subject has been 
engaged in strenuous exercise prior to dosing, dosing should be delayed until signs of a 
hypermetabolic state (eg, flushing, sweating, rapid breathing and/or rapid heart rate) have abated . 
No attempt should be made  to make up a missed dose if greater than 6 hours has elapsed from the 
usual time of dosing.  
If moderate or severe allergic symptoms ( Appendix  2) occur during home dosing, the subject or 
parent/legal guardian should call the study site and the subject should immediately stop home 
dosing and return to the clinic the next day . Upon confirmation by the investigator of moderate 
symptoms, the next dose wil l be administered under medical supervision. Upon confirmation by 
the investigator of severe symptoms, subject will discontinue all study drugs ( Appendix  5) and 
return to the clinic for follow -up.  
6.1.2.2.  Missed Doses AR101  
No attempt should be made to make up a missed dose if greater than 6 hours has elapsed from the 
usual time of dosing and the subject should continue with the next scheduled dose, which may  be 
at home . If 2 consecutive doses are missed, the subject should continue with the next scheduled 
dose, which may be at home . If 3 to 7 consecutive doses are missed, the subject should return to 
the clinic for the next dose .

CONFIDENTIAL  6.1.2.3.  Individual Subject Stopping Rules  
1. Missing >2 consecutive doses of study drug (dupilumab or placebo)  
2. Missing >7 consecutive days of AR101 therapy (eg, concurrent illness such as 
gastroenteritis).  
3. Anaphylaxis resulting in severe hypotension ( Appendix  3), neurological compromise, or 
mechanical ventilation secondary to OIT dosing or any food challenge.  
4. Subject develops biopsy -documented EoE or other eosinophilic GI disease.  
5. Any subj ect deemed to have a severe allergic reaction or has a life -threatening reaction at 
any time will be discontinued from further therapy.  
6. Other circumstances including, but not limited to, the following:  
a. Poor control or persistent severe activation of second ary atopic disease (eg, AD, 
asthma)  
b. Started on beta -blockers  with no alternative medications available per the prescribing 
physician  
c. Pregnancy  
6.1.2.4.  Anaphylaxis  
The definition of anaphylaxis that has been adopted for this study is from the 2014 position paper 
by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Food Allergy and 
Anaphylaxis Guidelines Group ( Muraro, 2007 ), that in turn was based on the publications of 
Simons (2011 ) and Johansson (2004 ), and is consistent with the recently published “International 
consensus on (ICON) anaphylaxis” ( Simons, 2014 ). Accordingly, anaphylaxis is defined as a 
severe, potentially life -threatening systemic hypers ensitivity reaction, characterized by being rapid 
in onset with life -threatening airway, breathing, or circulatory problems that is usually, though not 
always, associated with skin and mucosal changes.  
When the diagnosis of anaphylaxis is made, the basis for having suspected the diagnosis must be 
documented, using the criteria established by the Second Symposium on the Definition and 
Management of Anaphylaxis ( Sampson, 2006 ). Reports of anaphylaxis will be collected in the 
electro nic data capture (EDC) . Reports of non -fatal and non -life-threatening anaphylaxis that do 
not require hospitalization (admitted for over 24 hours) will not require expedited safety reporting, 
as these are clinically anticipated events in the target populat ion. All reports of anaphylaxis will 
be periodically reviewed to ensure proper patient care and prompt identification of any clinically 
concerning safety issues.  
6.1.2.5.  Gastrointestinal Adverse Events and Disruption of Dosing  
At each study visit, the site must so licit specific symptoms from subjects that may indicate the 
development of EoE. These include symptoms of both advanced and early disease such as food 
impaction, dysphagia, and choking or gagging with meals, gastroesophageal reflux, nausea, 
vomiting, and a bdominal pain.  
Prolonged disruption of dosing is defined as withholding AR101 for >7 consecutive days and is 
an individual stopping rule that results in permanent discontinuation of dosing (see Section  8.3.2 ).

CONFIDENTIAL  Subjects that discontinue because of GI AEs will be asked to complete the Pediatric Eosinophilic 
Esophagitis Symptom Score (PEESS™) v2.0 questionnaire ( Franciosi,  2011 ), with the assistance 
of a parent or guardian, as appropriate, every month for 6  months.  
If a subject with chronic/recurrent GI AEs has not experienced complete resolution of symptoms 
within 6 weeks of discontinuation of dosing with the investigational produc t (peanut), the subject 
should be referred to a (pediatric) gastroenterologist.  
Subjects who discontinue dosing prematurely due to chronic/recurrent GI AEs are to be requested 
to return to the clinic for evaluation monthly for at least 6 months (if the sub ject is asymptomatic), 
telephone follow -up with a physician investigator may be substituted for an in -clinic visit, at the 
investigator’s discretion. If chronic/recurrent GI AEs persist beyond 6 months, subjects are to 
continue to be followed with monthly clinic visits until the symptoms have resolved or are assessed 
to have stabilized with optimal medical management.  
If a subject is seen by a pediatric gastroenterologist, the investigational site is to procure records 
of the visit, as well as any test resu lts, including those from endoscopy and endoscopic biopsy, if 
performed. These are to be retained with the subject’s source documentation.  
6.1.3.  Study Design Safety Considerations for DBPCFC  
The DBPCFC during screening and precautions taken are described in Sect ion 6.1 (Screening) . 
Similarly, the DBPCFCs at visits 16, 22, and 25, and as the stopping rules are described in 
Section  6.1 (Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Food Challenge) . Oral food challenges may 
induce an allergic response . Allergic reactions can be severe, including life -threatening allergic 
reactions; however, the risk of an allergic reaction is reduced by initiating the challenge with a 
very small amount of the food, gradually increasing the dose, and stopping the challenge at the 
first sign of a reaction . If subjects have an allerg ic reaction during the challenges, they may need 
oral, IM, or IV medications . Subjects will have an IV catheter placed before the food challenges if 
they have a medically documented history of anaphylaxis with hypotension requiring IV fluid 
resuscitation . Additionally, IV catheters may be placed, at physician discretion for any visit, based 
on factors such as previous reactions, recent clinical history, and clinical status observed at the 
visit. Trained personnel, including a study physician, as well as med ications and equipment, will 
be immediately available to treat any reaction . The anticipated rate of life -threatening anaphylactic 
reactions is  <0.1%.  
6.1.4.  End of Study Definition  
The end of study is defined as the last visit of the last subject .  
6.2. Planned Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis is planned . An unblinded primary analysis may be performed once all subjects 
in the study have completed the 28 to 40 week up -dosing treatment period as specified in the 
protocol (visit 16 or earlier for those subjects who are withdrawn prematurely from the study) . If 
performed, this primary analysis will be considered the final analysis for the primary endpoint and 
secondary efficacy endpoints up to the end of the up -dosing period at visit 16 (week 28 to 40) . A 
descript ion of the statistical methods to be employed and blinding implications are in 
Section  11.4.3 .

CONFIDENTIAL  6.3. Study Committees  
6.3.1.  Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
The dupilumab clinical development program in food allergy IDMC, composed of members who 
are independent from the sponsor and the study investigators, will provide oversight of subject 
safety by conducting formal reviews of accumulated safety data that wi ll be blinded by treatment 
group; if requested, the IDMC may have access to the treatment allocation code or any other 
requested data for the purposes of a risk -benefit assessment . The IDMC will provide Regeneron 
and Sanofi with appropriate recommendations  on the conduct of the food allergy clinical studies 
to ensure the protection and safety of the subjects enrolled in these studies.  
All activities and responsibilities of the IDMC are described in the IDMC charter.  
6.3.2.  Adjudication Committee  
The Adjudication Committee will review reports of specific serious adverse events (SAEs) and 
adverse events of special interest (AESI) to verify appropriate diagnosis as per protocol definitions 
(eg, anaphylaxis) and appropriate determination of event seriousness, severity , and causality . The 
Adjudication Committee will provide a complete assessment of the selected cases to help 
independently validate these reports . Adjudication Committee assessments will be reported in 
addition to the investigator’s assessments.

CONFIDENTIAL  7.3. Premature Withdrawal from the Study  
A subject has the right to withdraw from th e study at any time, for any reason, and without 
repercussion.  
The investigator and/or sponsor have the right to withdraw a subject from the study if it is no 
longer in the interest of the subject to continue in the study, or if the subject’s continuation in the 
study places the scientific outcome of the study at risk (eg, if a subject does not or cannot follow 
study procedures) . An excessive rate of withdrawals would render the study uninterpretable; 
therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of subjects should be avoided.  
Subjects who are withdrawn prematurely from the study will be asked to complete study 
assessments, as described in Section  13. 
Rules for di scontinuation of study treatment (permanent or temporary) are discussed in 
Section  8.3.2 .

CONFIDENTIAL  AR101 capsules will be provided in prepackaged thermoform blister wallet cards with features to 
allow access to each dose in dosing kits . Appropriate combinations of capsules are used to provide 
the required AR101 doses (eg, one 20 mg  capsule and one 100 mg capsule to provide a 120 mg 
dose) . For the escalation periods, each individual kit will contain 21 daily doses at a given dose 
level, enough to supply 2 weeks of dosing plus 7 -day coverage to accommodate potential visit 
scheduling i ssues.  
For the maintenance period dosing, a 300 mg AR101 dose will be provided in sealed, foil -laminate 
sachets (1 sachet/day) . Sachets will be provided in kits containing 35 individual doses.  
All AR101 will be packaged and labeled at the central packaging  facility, then inventoried for 
distribution from a drug depot for shipment to the clinical sites . AR101 will be dispensed, 
according to subject identification number using an IWRS according to site -specific institutional 
policies . AR101 will then be distr ibuted to each subject or parent(s)/guardian(s) by study site 
personnel.  
After 4 full weeks of either dupilumab or placebo treatment, subjects start using a standardized 
regimen of single IDED AR101 (0.5 mg to a maximum of 6 mg, 12 mg cumulative) over 
approximately 5 to 6 hours . Subjects will begin a 3 mg/day oral dose at home for the next 14  days 
followed by bi -weekly up -dosing to a maximum of 300 mg/day AR101 at home.

8.3. Dose Modification and Study Treatment Discontinuation Rules  
8.3.1.  Dose Modification  
Dose modification of dupilumab for an individual subject is not allowed.  
8.3.2.  Study Drug Discontinuation  
Subjects  who permanently discontinue from study drug and who do not withdraw f rom the study  
will be asked to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits per the visit schedule . If dupilumab 
study drug is permanently discontinued, subject will also discontinue AR101 and vice versa.  
Subjects  who permanently discontinue from st udy drug and who opt to withdraw from the study 
will be asked to complete study assessments, per Section  13. 
8.3.2.1.  Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of  Study Drug  
Study drug dosing will be permanently stopped in the event of:  
• Anaphylactic reaction or other severe systemic reaction to dupilumab  
• Any infection that is opportunistic, such as active tuberculosis and other infections 
whose nature or course ma y suggest an immuno -compromised status  
• Severe laboratory abnormalities that are deemed to be related to dupilumab:  
− Neutrophil count ≤0.5 x 103/µL 
− Platelet count ≤50 x 103/µL 
− Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values 
greater than 3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) with total bilirubin >2 × ULN 
(unless elevated bilirubin is related to confirmed Gilbert’s Syndrome)  
− Confirmed AST and/or ALT >5 × ULN (for more than 2 weeks)  
• Diagnosis of a malignancy during the study  
• Evidence of pregnancy  
• Treatmen t with certain rescue medications, as specified in Section  8.2 
• Missing >2 consecutive doses of study drug (dupilumab or placebo)

CONFIDENTIAL  − Neutrophil count <1.5 x 103/µL but >0.5 x 103/µL 
− ALT or AST 3 × ULN but ≤5 × ULN  
− Platelet count ≤100 × 103/µL but >50 × 103/µL 
− Creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) >2.5 x ULN  
− Serum creatinine >1.5 x ULN  
− Eosinophils >5000/ µL  
• Severe laboratory abnormalities (as noted in Section  8.3.2.1 ) where a causal 
relationship to dupilumab can be reasonably excluded (ie, an alternative cause is 
evident) . In these cases, study treatment will be discontinued while the clinical 
circumstances are being assessed but it may be resumed when the laboratory 
parameters normalize sufficiently . A decision to resume treatment will  be made jointly 
by the investigator and medical monitor  
• Other intercurrent illnesses or major surgery  
• An infection that requires parenteral treatment with antibiotic, antifungal, antiviral, 
antiparasitic, or antiprotozoal agents, or requires oral treatmen t with such agents for 
longer than 2 weeks  
After the condition leading to suspension of dosing normalizes sufficiently, study treatment may 
resume at the discretion of the principal investigator in consultation with the medical monitor . 
A decision to discontinue study drug and/or to reinstitute study treatment should be discussed with 
the medical monitor. Note that dosing may NOT be resumed if subject met conditions for 
permanently discontinuing study drug described in Section  8.3. The investigator may suspend 
study treatment at any time, even without consultation with the medical monitor, if the urgency of 
the situation requires immediate action and if this is determined to be in the subject’s best interest . 
However, the medical monitor should be contacted as soon as possible in any case of study drug 
discontinuation . Resumption of study treatment after temporary discontinuation should always be 
discussed with the medical monitor.  
8.4. Management of Acute Reactions  
8.4.1.  Acute Injection Reactions  
8.4.1.1.  Systemic Injection Reactions  
Acute systemic reactions following  injection of study drug should be treated using clinical 
judgement to determine the appropriate resp onse according to typical clinical practice.  
8.5. Method of Treatment Assignment  
28 to 40 Week Treatment Phase  
Approximately 156 subjects will be randomized at baseline in a 2:1 ratio into one of 2 treatment 
arms (n=104 to dupilumab and 52 to placebo, in combi nation with up -dosing of AR101) described 
in Section  6.1 according to a central randomization scheme provided by an IWRS to the designated 
                                        VV-RIM-00116697-1.0 Approved - 23 Jul 2020 GMT-5:00

CONFIDENTIAL  study pha rmacist (or qualified designee) . Randomization will be stratified by screening 
peanut -specific IgE level (≤100 kUA/L or >100 kUA/L) and body weight (<30, ≥30  kg and 
<60 kg, or ≥60 kg) at randomization . A minimum of 15 subjects for each weight group will be  
enrolled.  
Maintenance Treatment Phase  
At visit 16 (or at the early termination visit for those who discontinue from study prior to visit 16), 
subjects previously in the dupilumab plus AR101 arm will be re -randomized in a 1:1 ratio into one 
of 2 treatment arms (dupilumab versus placebo, in combination with AR101), according to a 
central randomization scheme provided by IWRS . Randomization will be stratified by whether 
subjects achieve 300 mg/day AR101 for at least 2 weeks by visit 16 (Yes or No) . For subjec ts not 
achieving 300 mg/day AR101 for at least 2  weeks at visit 16 or early discontinued from study 
before visit 16, the re -randomization is used to determine their hypothetical assigned treatment for 
the maintenance phase in order to include them in the i ntent -to-treatment analysis of visit  22 
endpoints. The 24 -week maintenance period will start from day 1 of the post up -dosing DBPCFC 
at visit 16.  
Subjects previously in the placebo plus AR101 arm will continue their treatment of placebo plus 
AR101 in the m aintenance phase if they achieve 300 mg/day AR101 for at least 2 weeks at visit 
16. To maintain the blinding of treatment assignment, an IWRS randomization call needs to take 
place for these subjects.  
8.5.1.  Blinding  
With the exception of the IDMC members and the  provisions in Section  8.5.2 , this study will 
remain blinded to all individuals until the prespecified unblinding to conduct the primary analyses. 
All study staff and study team will be blinded to all post -screening food challenge results until the 
end of the study (once all subjects study -wide have completed the study and the sites receive 
permission to unblind from the sponsor).  
Blinded study drug kits coded with a medication numbering system will be used . In order to 
maintain the blind, lists linking these codes with product lot numbers will not be accessible to 
individuals involved in study conduct.  
Anti-drug antibody and drug concentration result s will not be communicated to the sites, and the 
sponsor’s operational team will not have access to results associated with subject identification 
until after the final database lock.  
An unblinded pharmacist or designee will mix the peanut protein or oat p rotein in the food selected 
for masking taste for administration in the DBPCFC . For each subject, a “blinded” evaluating 
physician (Blinded Assessor) is to be designated to assess the tolerability of the challenge doses 
presented in the DBPCFC . The blinded  evaluating physician is not to be involved directly in the 
oversight of study product dosing (neither initial escalation, nor up -dosing, nor maintenance 
phase), nor the assessment or management of AEs (for details refer to the Study Manual) . The 
principal  investigator or sub -investigator involved in subject care should not perform the post -
screening food challenges as this may result in bias.

CONFIDENTIAL  8.5.2.  Emergency Unblinding  
Unblinding  of treatment assignment for a subject may be necessary due to a medical emergency 
or any other significant medical event (eg,  pregnancy).  
• If unblinding is required:  
− Only the investigator will make the decision to unblind the treatment assignment.  
− Only the  affected subjects will be unblinded.  
− The designated study pharmacist(s)/designee at the study site will provide the 
treatment assignment to the investigator . If there is no study pharmacist, the 
investigator for the site will unblind the subject.  
− The inv estigator will notify Regeneron and/or designee before unblinding the 
subject, whenever possible.  
Treatment assignment is not to be provided to site personnel, other than the unblinded study 
pharmacist (when applicable), at any time during the conduct of t he study, except in the case of a 
true emergency . In the event that there is no study pharmacist, the individual at the site fulfilling 
that role will be the only unblinded member of the site personnel.  
8.6. Treatment Logistics and Accountability  
8.6.1.  Packaging, Lab eling, and Storage  
A medication numbering system will be used to label blinded investigational study drug . Lists 
linking medication numbers with product lot numbers will be maintained by the groups 
(or companies) responsible for study drug packaging . In order to maintain the blind, these lists will 
not be accessible to individuals involved in study conduct.  
Study drug will be stored at the site at a temperature of 2  C to 8 C; storage instructions will be 
provided in the pharmacy manual.  
8.6.2.  Supply and Disposi tion of Treatments  
Study drug will be shipped at a temperature of 2  C to 8 C to the investigator or designee at 
regular intervals or as needed during the study . At specified time points during the study 
(eg, interim site monitoring visits), at the site c lose-out visit, and following drug reconciliation and 
documentation by the site monitor, all opened and unopened study drug will be destroyed or 
returned to the sponsor or designee.  
8.6.3.  Treatment Accountability  
All drug accountability records must be kept curr ent. 
The investigator must be able to account for all opened and unopened study drug . These records 
should contain the dates, quantity, and study medication

CONFIDENTIAL  9.1.1.  Footnotes for the Schedule of Events Table 3  
1. The subject/legal guardian will administer SC study drug as scheduled on dosing days . 
Subject/legal guardian will complete an injection log (e -diary) to document compliance 
with injection of study drug . On days when both dupilumab/placebo study drug and AR101 
are administered, the study drug will be administered at least 8 hours apart from the AR101 
and at least 24 hours after the start of in -clinic dosing.  
2. The subject/legal guardian will administer AR101  during the days in which no in -clinic 
visit is scheduled . Subject/legal guardian will complete a dosing diary to document 
compliance with AR101 . On the day following in -clinic up -dosing, the site is to make 
telephone contact to inquire if any AEs occurred and report appropriately.  
3. Starting at visit 4 (week 4), AR101  will be dispensed at the site to the subject/legal guardian 
for the doses that will be administered before the next clinic visit.  
4. Asse ssments will be performed before the administration of study drug.  
5. Subject will be observed for a minimum of 2 hours after the final administered dose and 
discharged only when deemed clinically stable by a study doctor . On the day following a 
food challeng e, the site must make telephone contact to inquire if the subject experienced 
any AEs and report appropriately. Before each challenge, the subject will have a physical 
assessment performed by a trained physician’s assistant, registered nurse, nurse 
practit ioner, and/or physician of the study team who is blinded to the testing material. 
Eczema Area and Severity Index and ACQ only needed be completed once during day 1 
of the food challenge.  
6. Subjects should not take anti -histamines for at least 5 days prior to  the SPT.  
7. Site should confirm subject compliance at each clinic visit.  
8. During DBPCFC, vital signs will be collected every 15 to 30 minutes. During maintenance 
phase for in -clinic office visits, the post -dose observation may be shortened to 30 minutes.  
9. Spirometry will be performed in -clinic on the same day whenever FeNO measurement is 
scheduled; however, spirometry will also be performed at other visits when FeNO is not 
collected . Fractional exhaled nitric oxide should be done prior to spirometry. If the 
DBP CFC is scheduled on the day of the visit, then both FeNO measurement and spirometry 
will be performed twice before the subject goes home: once before DBPCFC, once after 
DBPCFC.  
a. During the COVID -19 pandemic, measurements of FeNO no longer need to be 
complet ed (at the discretion of the investigator). Additionally, if spirometry cannot be 
completed after enrollment, peak flow may be performed instead at the discretion of 
the investigator (although spirometry is still required at screening).  
10. On the day of the D BPCFCs, blood draws for optional exploratory research  will be 
performed before the DBPCFC is performed. For the day 1 exploratory research sample, 
the peanut day for the DBPCFC must be ≥15 days before to ensure washout of peanut 
allergen.

CONFIDENTIAL  11. One optional DNA sample for the genomics analyses (buccal swab) can be collected on 
day 1 (visit 2) or any other visit.  
12. Must complete all visit 1 assessments and confirm eligibility before visit 1a.  
13. Visit 1a must occur at least 15 days before visit 2 to allow a 2 -week wash out after the 
peanut screening DBPCFC.  
14. The time points listed in this table correspond with the bi -weekly up -dosing schedule 
(Table  2). These time points may no longer be accurate following adjustments to the 
planned up -dosing period. As of Amendment 3, the up -dosing period has been permitted 
to be extended to accommodate d ose reductions and re -escalation as well as COVID -19 
restrictions of in -clinic visits . This extension permits a maximum up -dosing period of 
40 weeks, while 28 weeks is ideal (consisting of 4 weeks pretreatment, 22 to 34 weeks of 
up-dosing, and at least 2 w eeks at the maximum dose).  
15. Study drug administration at unscheduled and/or optional visits 15a -f is to be documented 
in the unscheduled visits folder.  
9.1.2.  Footnotes for the Schedule of Events Table 4  
1. The subject/legal guardian will administer SC study drug as  scheduled on dosing days . 
Subject/legal guardian will complete an injection log (e -diary) to document compliance 
with injection of study drug . On days when both dupilumab/placebo study drug and AR101 
are administered, the study drug will be administered a t least 8 hours apart from the AR101 
and at least 24 hours after the start of in -clinic dosing. Both days of the up -dosing DBPCFC 
at visit 16 should be completed before starting the visit 16 SC study drug as part of the 
maintenance phase.  
2. The subject/legal  guardian will administer AR101  during the days in which no clinic visit 
is scheduled . Subject/legal guardian will complete a dosing diary to document compliance 
with AR101 . 
3. Starting at visit 4 (week 4), site will account for the AR101 that is dispense to the 
subject/legal guardian.  
4. Assessments will be performed before the administration of study drug.  
5. The food challenges will be performed on different days (1 -day placebo [oat] protein, 1 -
day peanut protein, with order determined at random) at least 24 hour s, but not more than 
7 days, apart and not within 24 hours of a dose of SC study drug . Subject will be observed 
for a minimum of 2 hours after the final administered dose and discharged only when 
deemed clinically stable by a study physician . On the day fo llowing a food challenge, the 
site must make a telephone contact to inquire if the subject experienced any AEs and report 
appropriately. Before each challenge, the subject will have a physical assessment

CONFIDENTIAL  7. Site should confirm subject compliance at each clinic visit.  
8. During DBPCFC, vital signs will be collected every 15 to 30 minutes.  
9. Spirometry will be performed in -clinic on the same day whenever FeNO measurement is 
schedul ed; however, spirometry will also be performed at other visits when FeNO is not 
collected . Fractional exhaled nitric oxide should be done prior to spirometry. If the 
DBPCFC is scheduled on the day of the visit, then both FeNO measurement and spirometry 
will be performed twice before the subject goes home: once before DBPCFC, once after 
DBPCFC.  
a. During the COVID -19 pandemic, measurements of FeNO no longer need to be 
completed while on study (at the discretion of the investigator). Additionally, if 
spirometry cannot be completed after enrollment, peak flow may be performed instead 
at the discretion of the investigator (although spirometry is still required at screening).  
10. Only for subjects who discontinue for GI AEs. If applicable, after week 64 PEESS will be 
collected by phone.  
11. On the day of the DBPCFCs, blood draws for optional exploratory research  will be 
performed before the DBPCFC is performed.  
12. Clinic visits are monthly . However, SC study drug administration is Q2W and dosing 
diaries for AR101 and allergic s ymptoms are done daily.  
13. The time points listed in this table correspond with the bi -weekly up -dosing schedule 
(Table  2). These time points may no longer be accurate following adjustments to the 
planned up -dosing period. As of Amendment 3, the up -dosing period has been permitted 
to be extended to accommodate dose reductions and re -escalation as well as COVID -19 
restriction s of in -clinic visits . This extension permits a maximum up -dosing period of 
40 weeks, while 28 weeks is ideal (consisting of 4 weeks pretreatment, 22 to 34 weeks of 
up-dosing, and at least 2 weeks at the maximum dose).  
14. If subjects are not able to go into the clinic for the DBPCFC within the target time frame, 
the DBPCFC can be started up to 7 days before and 30  days after the target date for visit 
16, 22, and/or 25.  
15. Study drug administration at unscheduled and/or optional visits 15a -f is to be documented 
in the unscheduled visits folder.

CONFIDENTIAL  9.1.3.  Early Termination Visit  
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study before the primary endpoint visit (week 28 to 40) will 
be asked to return to the clinic for an early termination visit consisting of study assessments 
descri bed in  Table  4. Subjects who are withdrawn from the study after the primary endpoint visit 
will be asked to return to the clinic for early termination a ssessments only but the DBPCFC will 
not be required.  
9.1.4.  Unscheduled Visits  
All attempts should be made to keep subjects on the study schedule . Unscheduled visits may be 
necessary to repeat testing following abnormal laboratory results, for follow -up of AEs, o r for any 
other reason, as warranted.  
9.2. Study Procedures  
9.2.1.  Procedures Performed Only at the Screening/Baseline Visit  
The following procedures will be performed for the sole purpose of determining study eligibility 
or characterizing the baseline population: HIV  antibody, HBsAg, HBcAb, hepatitis C antibody, 
height . Demographics and medical history will be collected.  
9.2.2.  Efficacy Procedures  
9.2.2.1.  Double -Blind Placebo -Controlled Food Challenge  
The subject’s sensitivity to peanut allergen is defined as the dose at which the subject experiences 
allergic reactions . All symptoms and signs will be evaluated and rated based on a standardized oral 
food challenge scoring system (see Appendix  2). Up-dosing during the DBPCFC will be stopped 
when the principal investigator (or designee) finds symptoms and/or signs that indicate a definite 
objective allergic reaction (CoFAR grading system [see Appendix  2]) has occurred based on 
clinically significant changes in reported symptoms, physical findings, or vital signs that the 
subject is experiencing to the challenge material . The challenge will consist of 8 doses (peanut 
protein or placebo), given every 15 to 30 minutes: 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 600, 1000 mg, up to 
2044  mg peanut protein (cumulative) . Both peanut and oat protein will be concealed in a food that 
masks the taste . The food challenges will be performed on different days (1 -day placebo [oat] 
protein, 1 -day peanut protein, with order determined at random) at least 24 hours, but not more 
than 7 days apart, and not within 24 hours of a dose of study drug . After the last dose  of the 
DBPCFC, the subject will be monitored for at least 2 hours and then discharged from the clinic . 
Subjects will be considered to have tolerated the DBPCFC and passed if they do not experience 
any objective Grade 1 (mild) reaction by CoFAR grading sys tem (see Appendix  2). If the subject 
experiences reactions, they will be treated with the necessary rescue medications . Symptom 
severity will be adju dicated by an independent, blinded assessor who is not involved in performing 
the baseline food challenge.

CONFIDENTIAL  9.2.2.2.  Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide  
Fractional exhaled nitric oxide is a non -invasive marker that has been shown to correlate with 
allergic airway infla mmation and IgE sensitization . The measurement of FeNO has shown 
predictive value on the outcome of peanut oral food challenge ( Preece, 2014 ). Although no 
manufacturer has validated the FeNO device for children under 7 years old, due to inadequate 
exhalation force, there are no contraindications with the use of FeNO for 6 -year-old children . Also, 
specific guidance and reference ranges are available for collection in children as young as 6 years 
of age ( Brody, 2013 ) (Menou, 2017 ). As FeNO is an exploratory biomarker, it will be collected 
for children 6 years old unless the investigator declines to collect. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide 
will be performed prior to spirometry. Durin g the COVID -19 pandemic, measurements of FeNO 
no longer need to be completed (at the discretion of the investigator).  
9.2.2.3.  Peanut Skin Prick Test  
The standard SPT is performed on the volar surface of the subject’s forearm using standard whole 
peanut extract rea gent, 1:10 w/v (ALK -Abello) and will only be performed at screening . A positive 
result is ≥3 mm determined by averaging maximal perpendicular wheal diameters 15  minutes after 
applying the lancet . The positive control is histamine base, 6 mg/mL (ALK -Abello)  and with a 
wheal ≥3 mm indicating a valid test . The negative control is glycerol saline.  
The titrated SPT is the skin testing for atopic response at different concentrations of peanut extract 
with saline as negative control and histamine as positive cont rols. The test will be performed at 
time points shown in Table  3 and Table  4. Testing of peanut extract will be conducted at the 
following dilutions: Ne at, 1:20, 1:200, 1:2000, 1:20,000. The longest diameter and longest 
orthogonal diameter will be collected.  
Mean wheal size induced by peanut extract, histamine, and saline at each concentration will be 
calculated by adding the longest diameter to the long est orthogonal diameter and dividing by 2. 
Normalized SPT will be calculated by subtracting mean saline wheal size from mean peanut wheal 
size.  
9.2.2.4.  Eczema Area and Severity Index  
The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to  assess the severity 
and extent of AD ( Hanifin, 2001 ). The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 
72. Four AD disease characteristics (erythema, thickness [induration, papulation, edema], 
scratching [excoriation], a nd lichenification) will each be assessed for severity by the investigator 
or designee on a scale of “0” (absent) through “3” (severe) . In addition, the area of AD involvement 
will be assessed as a percentage by body area of head, trunk, upper limbs, and l ower limbs, and 
converted to a score of 0 to 6 . In each body region, the area is expressed as 0, 1 (1% to 9%), 2 
(10% to 29%), 3 (30% to 49%), 4 (50% to 69%), 5 (70% to 89%), or 6 (90% to 100%) . The EASI 
will be collected for subjects with AD at screening and at subsequent time points according to 
Table  3 and Table  4.

CONFIDENTIAL  9.2.2.5.  Asthma Control Questionnaire  
The Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) is a validated questionnaire to evaluate asthma control . 
The questionnaire will be administered only to the subset of subj ects with a medical history of 
asthma and who fluently speak a language in which the questionnaire is presented (based on 
availability of validated translations in participating countries), at time points according to Table  3 
and Table  4. The ACQ -5 is for subjects aged 11  years or more and the ACQ -interviewer 
administered (IA) is for subjects aged 6 to 10 years. The ACQ has been fully validated for all 
children 6 -17 years when the self -administered adult version is used by children 11 years and older 
and the interviewer -administered version is used for children 6 -10 years.  Subjects will continue 
using the ACQ version first administered at screening regardless of moving to the next age bracket.  
9.2.2.6.  Daily Allergy Symptom Diary  
The daily allergy symptom diary is a questionnaire that was designed to capture the daily signs 
and symptoms of peanut OIT . The measure was developed with input from patients currently or 
recently treated with peanut OIT as well as clinicians with experience treating patients with peanut 
OIT. The daily allergy symptom diary has also been cognitively debriefed within the target 
population . In addition to daily allergy symptoms, the e -diary will also collect data on dupilumab 
injections, peanut OIT dosing, use of medications to treat symptoms of peanut OIT, and health 
states. Compliance to e -diary will be tracked closely by sites and should be reviewed via IRT portal 
for follow -up. During clinic visit, sites should review entry and reconcile for missing data.  
9.2.2.7.  Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire  
The Food Allergy Quality of Life Question naire (FAQLQ) is a validated food allergy -specific 
health -related quality of life (HRQL) questionnaire, which measures the impact of social and 
dietary limitations and assesses the emotional impact of these restrictions on the lives of patients . 
Patients s elf-report the impact of food allergy on HRQL using different forms of FAQLQ 
depending on their age; the child form (FAQLQ -CF) is used by patients aged 8 to 12 years and the 
teenager form (FAQLQ -TF) is used for patients aged 13 to 17 . The parent form (FAQL Q-PF) is a 
measure of children’s HRQL that is reported by parent proxy from the child’s perspective and can 
be used for patients of ages 0 to 12 years . The FAQLQ will be administered to subject and, when 
appropriate, parents at time points in accordance wi th Table  3 and Table  4. Subjects will continue 
using the FAQLQ version first administered at baseline regardless of moving to the next age 
bracket.  
9.2.3.  Safety Procedures  
9.2.3.1.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including temperature, sitting blood pressure, pulse, and respiration rate will be 
collected pre -dose at time points according to Table  3 and Table  4. During the DBPCFC, IDE and 
up-dosing, vital signs will be monitored every 15 to 30 minutes. For post -dose monitoring, only 
pulse and blood pressure need to be taken as part of safety monitoring.

CONFIDENTIAL  9.2.3.2.  Physical Examination  
A thorough and complete physical examination will be performed at time points according to 
Table  3. Care should be taken to examine and assess any abnormalities that may be present, as 
indicated by the subject’s medical history.  
9.2.3.3.  Spirometry  
A spirometer that meets the 2005 American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society 
recommendations will be used to measure FEV1 and/or PEF . During DBPCFC, spirometry should 
be performed before and after the challenge . The same spirometer and standard spirometric 
techniques, including calibration, should be used to perform spirometry at different visits and, 
whenever possible, the same person should perform the measurements ( Pellegrino,  2005 ). FeNO 
should be done prior to spirometry. If spirometry cannot be completed after enrollment, peak flow 
may be performed instead at the discretion of the investigator.  
9.2.3.4.  Laboratory Testing  
Hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, and pregnancy testing samples will be analyzed by a central 
laboratory . Detailed instructions for blood sample collection are in the laboratory manual provided 
to study sites.  
Samples for laboratory testing will be collected at visits according to Table  3 and Table  4. Tests 
will include:

Other Laboratory Tests  
For female subjects of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test will be performed at 
screening and end of study visits . For other visits where a pregnancy test is scheduled, a urine 
pregnancy test will be performed.  
Abno rmal Laboratory Values and Laboratory Adverse Events  
• All laboratory values must be reviewed by the investigator or authorized designee.  
• Significantly abnormal test results that occur after start of treatment must be repeated 
to confirm the nature and degre e of the abnormality . When necessary, appropriate 
ancillary investigations should be initiated . If the abnormality fails to resolve or cannot 
be explained by events or conditions unrelated to the study medication or its 
administration, the medical monitor must be consulted .  
• The clinical significance of an abnormal test value, within the context of the disease 
under study, must be determined by the investigator.  
Criteria for reporting laboratory values as an AE are provided in Section  10.4.5 . 
9.2.3.5.  Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis Symptom Score Questionnaire  
The Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis Symptom Score PEESS v2.0 measures subj ect-relevant 
outcomes . The PEESS v2.0 holds promise for being a valuable tool to follow the clinical course 
of EoE or an EoE -like immune -mediated GI syndrome . However, it was not designed to establish 
a diagnosis of EoE and has not been validated for use i n subjects with GI symptoms of other 
etiologies . Furthermore, the discriminant validity of the questionnaire has not been reported in 
either longitudinal natural history or interventional studies . For these reasons, the use of the PEESS 
v2.0 to monitor the  clinical course of GI symptoms must be considered exploratory . Nevertheless, 
the PEESS v2.0 has shown good content and construct validity ( Franciosi, 2011 ) (Martin, 2015 ).  
9.2.4.  Pharmacokinetic and Anti -Drug An tibody Procedures  
9.2.4.1.  Drug Concentration Measurements and Samples  
Samples for drug concentration will be collected at time points listed in Table  3 and Table  4.  
Any unused samples may be used for exploratory biomarker research.

CONFIDENTIAL  9.2.5.  Pharmacodynamic and Other Biomarker Procedures  
Biomarker samples will be collected at time points according to Table  3 and Table  4. Biomarker 
measurements will be performed in serum or plasma to determine effects on biomarkers of relevant  
physiological and pathogenic processes.  
The biomarkers studied will be ones believed to be relevant to the pathophysiology of peanut 
allergy, mechanism of action of dupilumab,  and possible toxicities . Biomarkers studied may 
include but need not be limited to: Total IgE,  Thymus and Activation -Regulated Chemokine, 
specific IgE, IgG4, and IgG against peanut extract and main peanut allergen components 
(including but not limited to Ara h1, Ara h2, and Ara h3), blood stimulation in TruCulture 
(supernatant cytokine and chemokine profiling), b asophil sensitivity to allergen stimulation and 
peanut -specific T -cell profiling .  
Exploratory biomarker results not required for protocol -defined endpoint analyses will not be 
reported in the CSR.  
9.2.6.  Future Bi omedical Research (Optional)  
Research samples (serum/plasma/peripheral blood mononuclear cells) will be banked for future 
biomedical research related to Type 2/Th2 inflammation, allergic diseases, IL -4/IL-13, dupilumab 
(including mechanism of action, effic acy, toxicity), and circulating factors that inhibit allergen -
specific IgE from binding to allergen (eg, IgE blocking factor). Additional samples will be 
collected as detailed in the schedule of assessments for Future Biomedical Research . The research 
may also include, but is not limited to, the study of allergen epitope diversity recognized by 
allergen -specific antibodies (both IgE and IgG4), T -cell and B -cell receptor repertoire (requires 
DNA/RNA sequencing), and the effects of dupilumab treatment on non -peanut allergies . The list 
may be altered or expanded as it is recognized that more relevant or novel biomarkers may be 
discovered during the course of this study . Any unused samples for study -related research, as well 
as unused PK and ADA sam ples, will be stored for up to 15 years after the final date of the database 
lock. The unused samples may be utilized for future biomedical research (described below) . After 
15 years, any residual samples will be destroyed . Results of these future biomedic al research 
analyses will not be reported in the CSR.  
9.2.6.1.  Genomics Analysis (Optional)  
Parents or legal guardians who agree to participate in the genomics sub -study will be required to 
indicate their consent to participate in the sub -study on the informed con sent form (ICF) before 
collection of the samples . Subjects are not required to participate in the genomics sub -study in 
order to enroll in the primary study . Samples for DNA extraction is recommended to be collected 
on day 1/baseline (predose) but may be c ollected at any study visit.  
DNA samples for the genomics analyses will be single -coded as defined by the International 
Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guideline E15 . Samples will be stored for up to 15 years after 
the final date of the database lock and m ay be used for research purposes . The purpose of the 
genomic analyses is to identify genomic associations with clinical or biomarker response, other 
clinical outcome measures and possible AEs . In addition, associations between genomic variants 
and prognosi s or progression of peanut allergy,  as well as related diseases may also be studied .

CONFIDENTIAL  10. SAFETY DEFINITIONS, REPORTING, AND MONIT ORING  
10.1. Obligations of Investigator  
The investigator must promptly report to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) all unanticipated 
problems involving risks to subject . This includes death from any cause and all SAEs related to 
the use of the study drug . It is recommended that all SAEs be reported to the IRB, regardless of 
assessed  causality.  
10.2. Obligations of Sponsor  
During the course of the study, the sponsor will inform health authorities, IRBs, and the 
participat ing investigators of any suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction occurring in other 
study centers for dupilumab and AR101, and also other studies for dupilumab.  
Any AE not listed as an expected event in the Investigator’s Brochure or in this protoco l will be 
considered as unexpected . Any worsening of or new onset of symptoms related to peanut allergy 
which occur during the screening/washout period prior to study drug administration will be 
considered expected.  
In addition, the sponsor will report in an expedited manner all SAEs that are expected and at least 
reasonably related to the study drug to the health authorities, according to local regulations.  
At the completion of the study, the sponsor will report all safety observations made during the 
cond uct of the trial in the CSR to health authorities and IECs/IRB as appropriate.  
10.3. Definitions  
10.3.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a study drug, which may or 
may not have a causal relationship with the study drug . Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, which is 
temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.  
An AE also includes any w orsening (ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or 
intensity) of a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug.  
10.3.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Resul ts in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely 
unrelated to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a subject  is a passenger).  
• Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the subject  is at immediate risk 
of death at t he time of the event . This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization . In-
subject hospitalization is defined as admission to a hospital or an emergency room for 
                                        VV-RIM-00116697-1.0 Approved - 23 Jul 2020 GMT-5:00

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 88 of 118 
CONFIDENTIAL  longer than 24 hours . Prolongation of existing hospitalization is defined as a hospital 
stay that is longer than was originally anticipated for the event or is prolonged due to 
the development of a new AE as determined by the investigator or treating physician.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event - Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject  or 
may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above 
(eg, intensive treatment in an em ergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
Criteria for reporting SAEs must be followed for these events. See Section  10.4 for more 
information on recording and reporting SAEs.  
10.3.3.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AESI (serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical concern specific to the sponsor’s 
product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator 
to the sponsor can be appropriate . Such an event might warrant further investigation in order to 
characterize and underst and it . Depending on the nature of the event, rapid communication by the 
trial sponsor to other parties (eg, regulators) might also be warranted (Section  10.4.3 ). 
10.4. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
10.4.1.  Adverse Events  
The investigator (or designee) will record all AEs that occur from the time the informed 
consent/assent is signed until the end of study . However, allergic reactions to the DBPCFC during 
the Screening phase, at endpoint challenges (at visits 16, 22, and 25), during AR101 in -clinic 
dosing visits, and daily home dosing will be recorded as allergic signs and symptoms since they 
are anticipated to allergen . Refer to the study reference manual for the procedures to be followed.  
Information on follow -up for AEs is provided in Section  10.4.6 . Laboratory and vital signs 
abnormalities are to be  recorded as AEs as outlined in Section  10.4.5 . 
10.4.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs, regardless of assessment of causal relationship to study drug, must  be reported to the 
sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours . Refer to the study reference manual for the procedure to be 
followed.  
Information not available at the time of the initial report must be documented in a follow -up report . 
Substantiating data such as relevant hospital or medical records and diagnostic test reports may 
also be requested.

CONFIDENTIAL  In the event the investigator is informed of an SAE after the subject completes the study (ie, the 
follow -up period), the following will apply:  
• If the subject is an early termination from the study, SAE with an onset within 12  weeks  
of last study drug administration will be reported to the sponsor . The investigator 
should make every effort to obtain follow -up information on the outcome until the 
event is considered ch ronic and/or stable.  
• For SAEs with an onset day greater than 12 weeks from the last study drug 
administration, only those deemed by the investigator to be drug -related SAEs will be 
reported to the sponsor . The investigator should make every effort to obtain follow -up 
information on the outcome of a drug -related SAE until the event is considered chronic 
and/or stable.  
10.4.3.  Other Events that Require Accelerated Reporting to Sponsor  
The following events also require reporting to the sponsor (or designee) withi n 24 hours of learning 
of the event:  
Pregnancy:  Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the 
investigator to report to the sponsor (or designee), within 24  hours of identification, 
any pregnancy occurring in a female study su bject, during the study or within 12 
weeks of the last dose of study drug . Any complication of pregnancy affecting a 
female study subject, and/or fetus and/or newborn that meets the SAE criteria must 
be reported as an SAE . Outcome for all pregnancies shoul d be reported to the 
sponsor.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest:   All AESI, serious and non -serious, must be reported within 
24 hours of identification using the same reporting process as for SAE reporting, 
per Section  10.4.2 .  
Adverse events of special interest for dupilumab in this study include the following:   
• Anaphylactic reactions  
• Systemic or extensive hypersensitivity reactions  
• Helminthic inf ections  
• Conjunctivitis (any type or etiology), keratitis, or blepharitis (for all these AEs only 
events that are severe or serious or lasting ≥4 weeks will be reported as AESIs)  
Adverse events of special interest for AR101 in this study include:  
• Anaphylact ic reactions  
• Gastrointestinal AEs resulting in prolonged disruption of dosing  
Refer to the study manual for the procedures to be followed.  
10.4.4.  Reporting Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal from the Study  
All AEs that lead to a subject’s withdrawal from the study must be reported to the sponsor’s 
medical monitor within 30 days.

CONFIDENTIAL  Refer to the study reference manual for the procedures to be followed.  
10.4.5.  Abnormal Laboratory or Vital Signs Results  
Abnormal laboratory or vital signs will be graded according to the FDA  September 2007. The 
criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an AE 
include:  
• the test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
• the test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical /surgical intervention, 
and/or  
• the test result leads to a change in dosing (outside of protocol -stipulated dose 
adjustments), discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug 
treatment, or other therapy  
Contact the medical monitor in  the event the investigator feels that an abnormal test finding should 
be reported as an AE, although it does not meet any of the above criteria.  
Repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an 
AE. Any abno rmal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE.  
Please refer to FDA Guidance for Industry, Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and 
Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials for reporting severity of 
laboratory abnormalities:  
(https://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInfor
mation/Guidances/Vaccines/ucm091977.pdf ) 
10.4.6.  Follow -Up 
Adverse  event information will be collected until the subject’s last s tudy visit.  
Serious adverse event information will be collected until the event is considered chronic and/or 
stable.  
10.5. Evaluation of Severity and Causality  
10.5.1.  Evaluation of Severity  
The severity grading of allergic reactions will be according to the definitions  developed the 
CoFAR group ( Appendix  2) and the severity of anaphylactic reactions will be graded according to 
the EAACI system for grading the seve rity of anaphylactic reactions ( Appendix  3).  
The severity of other AEs will be graded according to the following scale:  
• Mild:  Does not interfere i n a significant manner with the subject normal functioning 
level . It may be an annoyance . Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief 
of symptoms but may be given because of personality of the subject.  
• Moderate:   Produces some impairment of fun ctioning but is not hazardous to health . 
It is uncomfortable or an embarrassment . Treatment for symptom may be needed.

CONFIDENTIAL  • Severe:   Produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a 
definite hazard to the subject’s health . Treatment for  symptom may be given and/or 
subject hospitalized.  
If a laboratory value is considered an AE, its severity should be based on the degree of 
physiological impairment the value indicates.  
Injection Site Reactions  
The severity of injection site reactions will  be graded according to the following scale (semi -colon 
indicates “or” within description of grade):  
• Mild :  Pain that does not interfere with activity; mild discomfort to touch; <5 cm of 
erythema or induration that does not interfere with activity  
• Moderate :  Pain that requires repeated use of non -narcotic pain reliever >24 hours or 
interferes with activity; discomfort with movement; 5.1 cm to 10 cm erythema or 
induration or induration that interferes with activity  
• Severe :  Pain that requires any use of narcotic pain reliever or that prevents daily 
activity; significant discomfort at rest; >10 cm erythema or induration; prevents daily 
activity; requires emergency room visit or hospitalization; necrosis; or exfoliative 
dermatitis

10.6. Safety Monitoring  
The investigator will monitor the safety of study subject at his/her site(s) as per the requirements 
of this protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP) . Any questions or 
concerns should be discussed with the sponsor in a timely fashi on. The sponsor will monitor the 
safety data from across all study sites . The medical monitor will have primary responsibility for 
the emerging safety profile of the compound, but will be supported by other departments (eg, 
Pharmacovigilance and Risk Manag ement; Biostatistics and Data Management) . Safety 
monitoring will be performed on an ongoing basis (eg, individual review of SAEs) and on a 
periodic cumulative aggregate basis.  
10.7. Investigator Alert Notification  
Regeneron (or designee) will inform all investi gators participating in this clinical trial, as well as 
in any other clinical trial using the same investigational drug, of any SAE that meets the relevant 
requirements for expedited reporting (an AE that is serious, unexpected based on the Investigator’s 
Brochure or this protocol, and has a reasonable suspected causal relationship to the study drug).

CONFIDENTIAL  11. STATISTICAL PLAN  
This section provides the basis for the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the study . The SAP may 
be revised during the study to accommodate  amendments to the clinical study protocol and to make 
changes to adapt to unexpected issues in study execution and data that may affect the planned 
analyses . The final SAP will be issued before the database is locked.  
Analysis variables are listed in Sect ion 5. 
Handling of missing data or delayed procedures due to COVID -19, and any additional analyses 
required to investigate the impact of COVID -19 to understand estimated treatment effect and 
safety, will be detailed in the SAP.  
11.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects who achieve a cumulative dose of 
2044  mg peanut protein during a post up -dosing DBPCFC at visi t 16. The comparison between 
the dupilumab plus AR101 arm and the placebo plus AR101 arm will be made.  
Let p D (and p P) be the true proportion of subjects who achieve a cumulative dose of 2044 mg of 
peanut protein during a post up -dosing DBPCFC at visit 16 in the treatment arms of dupilumab 
plus AR101 and placebo plus AR101, respectively . The following hypothesis for the superiority 
testing will be tested at the 5% 2 -sided significance level:  
H0: pD = p P, ie, the proportion of subjects who achieve a cumulative dose of 2044 mg peanut 
protein during a post up -dosing DBPCFC at visit 16 is the same between dupilumab plus AR101 
arm and the placebo plus AR101 arm  
against the alternative  
Ha: pD ≠ pP, ie, the proportion of subjects who achieve a cumulative do se of 2044 mg peanut protein 
during a post up -dosing DBPCFC at visit 16 are different between the dupilumab plus AR101 arm 
and the placebo plus AR101 arm  
11.2. Justification of Sample Size  
It is assumed that the proportion of subjects who achieve a cumulative do se of 2044 mg of peanut 
protein during a post up -dosing DBPCFC at visit 16 in the placebo plus AR101 arm will be 40%, 
based on an Aimmune presentation at the 2018 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & 
Immunology –World Allergy Organization Joint Congress; w ith the proportion of subjects in the 
dupilumab plus AR101 arm assumed to be 65%, which is considered to be clinical meaningful 
benefit by adding on dupilumab treatment . A sample size of approximately 156 subjects (104 in 
dupilumab plus AR101 and 52 in pla cebo plus AR101) will have 80% power to detect the treatment 
difference of 25 % between placebo plus AR101 and dupilumab plus AR101 at the 2 -sided 5% 
significance level (the minimum significant difference is approximately  17.8%) . The sample size 
calculation s were done by Fisher exact test using nQuery (7.0).  
Approximately 122 subjects who undergo the post up -dosing DBPCFC at week 28 (visit 16 with 
a window of -7/+30 days) or discontinue from study prior to week 28 (visit 16 with a window of -
7/+30 days) wil l be included in the primary efficacy analysis. These subjects receive AR101 dose 
escalation per the original protocol’s 24 -week up -dosing schedule. The minimum significant

CONFIDENTIAL  difference with approximately 122 subjects is approximately 20.7% between placebo p lus AR101 
and dupilumab plus AR101 assuming the placebo plus AR101 treatment effect is 40% at the 2 -
sided Fisher exact test with 5% significance level.  
11.3. Analysis Sets  
11.3.1.  Efficacy Analysis Sets  
The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized subjects . Effic acy analyses will be based on 
the treatment allocated at randomization (as randomized).  
The modified full analysis set (mFAS) includes all FAS subjects who undergo the post up -dosing 
DBPCFC at week 28 (visit 16 with a window of -7/+30 days) or discontinue from study prior to 
week 28 (visit 16 with a window of -7/+30 days).  
The mFAS will be used for primary analysis for all efficacy endpoints. Analysis of the FAS will 
also be done for supportive analyses.  
11.3.2.  Safety Analysis Set  
The safety analysis set (SAF) inc ludes all randomized subjects who received any study drug; it is 
based on the treatment received (as treated) . Treatment compliance/administration and all clinical 
safety variables will be analyzed using the SAF.  
11.3.3.  Other Analysis Sets  
The pharmacokinetic pop ulation includes all treated subjects who received any study drug and 
who had at least 1 non -missing drug concentration result following the first dose of study drug.  
The ADA analysis set includes all treated subjects who received any study drug and who had at 
least 1 non -missing ADA result following the first dose of study drug.  
The NAb analysis set includes all treated subjects who received any study drug and who are 
negative in the ADA assay or with at least 1 non -missing result in the NAb assay (subje cts who 
are ADA negative are set to negative in the NAb analysis set).  
11.4. Statistical Methods  
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics will include the following information:  the number 
of subjects reflected in the calculation (n), mean, median, firs t quartile (Q1), third quartile (Q3), 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum .  
For categorical or ordinal data, frequencies and percentages will be displayed for each category.  
All data will be summarized by treatment groups as outlined below:   
• Double -blind treatment period with pre -dosing and up -dosing of AR101 (28 to 
40 weeks):  placebo plus AR101 vs dupilumab plus AR101.  
• Double -blind maintenance phase (24 weeks):  continuously on placebo + AR101, 
previously on dupilumab + AR101 and re -randomiz ed to placebo + AR101, 
continuously on dupilumab + AR101.

The following will be provided:  
• The total number of screened subjects:  met the inclusion criteria regarding the target 
indication and signed the ICF  
• The total number of randomiz ed subjects:  received a randomization number  
• The total number of subjects in each analysis set ( eg, mFAS, FAS defined in 
Section  11.3.1  for all effica cy analysis sets) 
• The total number of subjects who discontinued the study, and the reasons for 
discontinuation  
• A listing of subjects treated but not randomized, subjects randomized but not treated, 
and subjects randomized but not treated as randomized  
• A listing of subjects prematurely discontinued from treatment, along with reasons for 
discontinuation  
11.4.2.  Demography and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively by treatment group, 
and by all subjects comb ined.  
11.4.3.  Efficacy Analyses  
The primary efficacy analyses for all the efficacy endpoints will be conducted using the mFAS 
population . As supportive evidence, the same analysis approach will be repeated with the FAS 
population.  
11.4.3.1.  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The pr imary endpoint will be analyzed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted by 
randomization stratification factors to assess the treatment difference in the proportion of 
responders (ie, those who “pass” a post up -dosing DBPCFC with 2044 mg [cumulativ e] peanut 
protein at visit 16 [week 28 with a visit window of -7/+30 days]) in the mFAS . Estimate of 
treatment difference, p -value, and the 2 -sided 95 % confidence interval will be provided.  
In addition, the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed on t he FAS as a supportive analysis.  
If a subject does not have available post up -dosing DBPCFC data at visit 16, the subject will be 
considered as a non -responder regardless of reasons for missing data.  
Sensitivity analyses will include an analysis of the su bset of subjects with available post up -dosing 
DBPCFC data from visit 16.  
Subgroup analysis (eg, by baseline weight group) will also be performed.

CONFIDENTIAL  11.4.3.2.  Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
Continuous Endpoints at Visit 16  
Change in the cumulative tolerated dose (log transformed) of peanut protein during a post 
up-dosing DBPCFC from baseline at visit 16 will be analyzed using analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) with treatment as the main effect, stratification variables and baseline tolerated 
cumulative amount of peanut pr otein DBPCFC as covariates . In addition, a non -parametric 
analysis using the Van Elteren test will be conducted to assess the sensitivity to the assumption 
about normality of response variable as required by ANCOVA.  
If a subject does not have an available post up -dosing DBPCFC at visit 16, their baseline value 
will be used to impute the missing DBPCFC data at visit 16 (ie, baseline observation carried 
forward) . Sensitivity analysis using complete cases will be conducted to assess the robustness of 
the resul t, with regard to handling of missing data . Other sensitivity analyses may be conducted 
and will be specified in the SAP.  
Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints that are measured repeatedly over time during the 
28 to 40 week double -blind treatment period (eg, EASI) will be analyzed using ANCOVA in a 
similar way to the endpoint of change in the cumulative tolerated dose of peanut protein . For these 
endpoints, missing data will be imputed by multiple imputations.  
Endpoints at Visit 22 or 25  
Secondary endpoin ts at visit 22 (the end of the maintenance period) or at visit 25 (the end of study) 
will be analyzed descriptively at given visits . These descriptive analyses may include statistical 
tests depending on the type of data in the same way as described above.  
11.4.3.3.  Multiplicity Considerations  
The overall Type -1 error rate of 0.05 (2 -sided) will be controlled for the primary endpoint and the 
first secondary endpoint (ie, change in the cumulative tolerated dose [log transformed] of peanut 
protein during a post up -dosin g DBPCFC from baseline to visit 16) using a hierarchical testing 
procedure . Inferential conclusions about the first secondary endpoint require statistical 
significance at the 2 -sided 0.05 significance level of the primary endpoint.  
11.4.3.4.  Timing of Analyses  
A pr imary analysis may be performed when the last subject completes 28 to 40 weeks of the 
double -blind treatment period as specified in the protocol (visit 16 or earlier for those subjects who 
are withdrawn prematurely from the study) . No changes in the conduc t of the study will be made 
based on this primary analysis . The assessment of primary and secondary endpoints up to visit  16 
as specified in Section  11.4.3.1   and Section  11.4.3.2   and performed during the analysis will be 
the final analysis of the primary endpoint and the secondary endpoints up to visit 16 . Hence there 
will be no need for alpha adjustment due to the primary analysis . If a decision is made to perform 
the primary analysis, in order to maintain study integrity with respect to the maintenance phase 
and the post -treatment follow -up vi sits, and analyses, a dissemination plan will be written . This 
plan will clearly identify the team (including the statistician) that will perform the primary analysis 
and all related activities, restrict other clinical team members and other sponsor person nel from 
access to individual subject treatment allocation and site level analysis results, and ensure that the 
                                        VV-RIM-00116697-1.0 Approved - 23 Jul 2020 GMT-5:00

CONFIDENTIAL  dedicated team will not participate in the data review or data decisions for the following 
post-treatment analyses . However, the dedicated team can participate in the analysis following the 
final database lock . In addition, an end of maintenance phase analysis may be performed when the 
last subject completes the maintenance treatment period (week 52 to 64 visit or earlier for those 
who are withdra wn prematurely from the study) . If a decision is made to perform the end of 
maintenance phase analysis, measures similar to those taken for the primary analysis will be used 
in order to maintain study integrity with respect to the post -treatment follow -up visits and analyses.

Pediatric Subjects  
The principles of informed consent are described in ICH guidelines for GCP.  
The ICF used by the investigator must be reviewed and approved by the sponsor prior to 
submission to the appropriate IRB . A copy of the IRB -approved ICF and documentation of 
approval must be provide d to the sponsor before study drug will be shipped to the study site.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee (if acceptable by local regulations) to obtain 
written informed consent from each subject and his/her parent(s) or legal guardian (s) prior to the 
subject’s participation in the study and after the aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards 
of the study have been explained to the fullest possible extent in language that the subject and the 
parent(s) or legal guardian(s) can und erstand . The ICF should be signed and dated by the subject’s 
parent(s) or legal guardian(s) and the same investigator or designee who explained the ICF.  
Local law must be observed in deciding whether 1 or both parents’/guardians’ consent is required . 
If on ly 1 parent or guardian signs the consent form, the investigator must document the reason the 
other parent or guardian did not sign, if both are required . The subject may also be required to sign 
and date the assent form, as determined by the IRB and in ac cordance with the local regulations 
and requirements.  
• Subjects who can write but cannot read will have the assent form read to them before 
writing their name on the form.  
• Subjects who can understand but who can neither write nor read will have the ICF read  
to them in presence of an impartial witness, who will sign and date the ICF to confirm 
that informed consent was given.  
The original ICF must be retained by the investigator as part of the subject’s study record, and a 
copy of the signed ICF must be given  to the subject’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s).  
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment, the ICF must 
be reviewed and updated appropriately . All study subjects and their parent(s) or legal guardian(s) 
must be informed of the new information and provide their written consent if they wish the subject 
to continue in the study . The original signed revised ICF must be maintained in the subject’s study 
record and a copy must be given to the subject’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s).

Note: The DBPCFC is to be conducted as 2 challenges, each on a separate day, using a placebo (artificially peanut -
flavored oat protein) for one challenge and peanut (as defatted peanut protein) for the other . The oral food challenge 
is to be performed under double -blind conditions so that neither the subject, nor the subject’s legal guardi an, nor any 
of the clinic staff (save for the unblinded preparer of the challenge foods) knows which challenge contains the peanut 
or the placebo . The clinic staff may not be unblinded as to the order of the 2 parts (peanut and placebo) of the DBPCFC 
until after completion of the observation period of the second part of the challenge for the screening challenge only.

CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX  2. ALLERGIC REACTION SE VERITY GRADING  
The CoFAR grading system for allergic reactions  
 
 
PRACTALL consensus report on DBPCFC, and with the CoFAR grading system for allergic 
reactions, are provided as a general guide.  
Mild Symptoms :  
• Skin – limited (few) or localized hives, swelling (eg, mild lip edema), skin flushing (eg, few areas of faint erythema) or 
pruritus (mild, eg, causing occasional scratching)  
• Respiratory – rhinorrhea (eg, occasional sniffling or sneezing), nasal con gestion, occasional cough, throat discomfort  
• Gastrointestinal (GI) – mild abdominal discomfort (including mild nausea), minor vomiting (typically a single episode) 
and/or a single episode of diarrhea  
Moderate Symptoms:  
• Skin – systemic hives (eg, numerous or widespread hives), swelling (eg, significant lip or face edema), pruritus 
causing protracted scratching, more than a few areas of erythema or pronounced erythema  
• Respiratory – throat tightness without hoarseness, persistent cough, wheezing without dyspnea  
• GI – persistent moderate abdominal pain/cramping/nausea, more than a single episode of vomiting and/or diarrhea 
Severe Symptoms:  
• Skin – severe generalized urticaria/angioedema/erythema  
• Respiratory – laryngeal edema, throat tightness with hoarseness, wheezing with dyspnea, stridor  
• GI – severe abdominal pain/cramping/repetitive vomiting and/or diarrhea  
• Neurological – change in mental status  
• Circulatory – clinically significant hypotension

CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX  3. CRITERIA FOR SUSPECT ED DIAGNOSIS AND 
SEVERITY GRADING OF ANAPHYLAXIS  
Anaphylaxis is likely when any one of the 3 following sets of criteria is fulfilled:  
1. Acute onset of an illness (min to h) with involvement of:  
• Skin/mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch or flush, swollen lips/tongue/uvula) 
AND  
• Airwa y compromise (eg, dyspnea, stridor, wheeze/ bronchospasm, hypoxia, reduced 
PEF) AND/OR  
• Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia, syncope, incontinence)  
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to the allergen (min to h):  
• Skin/mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch/flush, swollen lips/tongue/uvula)  
• Airway compromise (eg, dyspnea, stridor wheeze/bronchospasm, hypoxia, reduced 
PEF)  
• Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia, syncope, incontinence)  
• Persistent GI sympt oms (eg, nausea, vomiting, crampy abdominal pain)  
3. Reduced BP after exposure to the allergen (min to h):  
• Infants and Children: low systolic BP (age -specific) or > 30% drop in systolic BP*  
• Adults: systolic BP < 90 mm Hg or > 30% drop from their baseline  
* Low systolic BP for children is defined as < 70 mmHg from 1 month to 1 year; less than 
(70 mmHg + [2 x age]) from 1 to 10 years; and < 90 mmHg from age 11 to 17 years.  
Note: Isolated skin or mucosal lesions following the ingestion of a food constitute a “ food-
induced allergic reaction”.  
Criteria for Severity Grading ( Muraro 2007 ) 
Staging System of Severity of Anaphylaxis 
Stage Defined By 
1. Mild (skin & subcutaneous tissues, GI, 
&/or mild respiratory) Flushing, urticaria,  periorbital or facial  angioedema; mild 
dyspnea, wheeze,  or upper respiratory symptoms; mild 
abdominal pain and/or emesis 
2. Moderate (mild  symptoms + 
features suggesting moderate 
respiratory, cardiovascular, or GI 
symptoms) Marked dysphagia, hoarseness and/or stridor; shortness 
of breath, wheezing & retract ions; crampy abdominal 
pain, recurrent vomiting, and/or diarrhea; and/or mild 
dizziness 
3. Severe  (hypox ia, hypotension, or 
neurological compromise) Cyanosis or SpO2 ≤ 92% at any stage, hypotension, 
confusion, collapse, loss of consciousness; or 
incontinence

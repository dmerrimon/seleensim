STUDY DESIGN  This is a P hase 2 parallel - group, open label  study in  healthy adults 
18-65 years of age. A total of 
60 
subjects are planned to be  enrolled  
with 
up to 
30 at each of two sites.
 
This study has a screening period of 60 days, a treatment and 
observation period from Day 1  to Day 29, and a follow -up period 
through Day 182. Subjects enrolled at 
USAMRIID
 will be matched 
by age ( ±3 years ) and gender  (both birth and self -identified)  with 
alphavirus naïve subject s enrolled at WRAIR .
  
This 
matching is done 
to ensure that demographic characteristics are comparable between 
the groups, not to pair data between two specific individuals. 
Details of visits, v isit windows, and procedures are  provided in the 
Schedule of Events (
Appendix A ). After signing the informed 
consent form, subjects will under go screening procedures up to 6 0 
days before  the first injection. Subjects will be o bserved in clinic for 
30 
to
 60 
minutes after
 
injection
. 
Local
 
and
 
systemic
 
solicited events
 
occurring within 
7 
days after the injection will be recorded by the 
subject using a memory aid . Subjects will be specifically asked to 
record local 
injection site events (pain, redness, 
 swelling) and 
systemic events ( fever with oral temperature ≥ 100.4 º  F, chills, 
fatigue, malaise, headache, myalgia, arthralgia , and nausea).  Any 
other 
adverse events and
 medications used through 
Day 
29 
will also 
be reco rded. Blood will be collected at 
Day 1
 (before the injection) 
and Days 8, 22, 29, 57 
and 
182.   

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 of 81 A final analysis  of data collected throughout the study from all 
subjects will be performed after the last  subject has completed the 
study and the immunogenicity and 
safety data have 
 
been locked.
 
STATISTICAL 
METHODS  
 The primary immunogenicity analysis will compare prior alphavirus 
vaccine recipients to alphavirus -naïve controls on the proportion in 
each group 
 
who seroconvert at 
Day 
22 – three weeks after injection 
– where seroconversion is defined as a 4 -fold or greater rise over 
baseline in anti -CHIKV neutralizing antibodies as assessed by a 
luciferase - based assay. The statistical significance of the comparis on 
will be assess ed using a Fisher’s exact test. The percentage who 
seroconvert in each group will be presented along with its  95% CI 
calculated using the Wilson method. Similar methods will be used to 
compare groups on the percentage of subjects who achie ve 
a titer of 
at least 
40, 160, or 640 
 
at Day 22 (primary time point ) and on Days 
8, 57 and 182 
(secondary 
time
 points ). 
GMT will be assessed  using an analysis of co variance (AN COVA)  
with logarithmically -transformed, anti -CHIKV neutralizing titers 
(log 10) as the dependent variable and pre - exposure group , age, 
gender as fixed effect s and baseline titer as the covariate  in the 
model. The least square means and 95% CIs estimated from the 
model will be back -transformed and reported as the group GMT 
values.  The geometric mean ratio (GM R) of the two groups and its 
95% CI will be estimated from 
a
 model 
contrast
. 
Similar methods will be used to assess  neutralizing and total 
antibody titers to other alphaviruses (VEEV, WEEV, EEEV)  at other 
time points. Safety will be assessed 
primarily through the reporting 
of solicited and unsolicited AEs. S olicited AEs  will be summarized 
for the 7 -day period following the injection 
by the incidence 
of each 
type of AE , the first day of its onset , the number of days 
the 
AE was 
reported, and the maximum severity of the AE. 
Groups will be 
compared on the incidence of each type of solicited AE using 
pairwise Fisher’s exact tests  
Unsolicited AEs will be su mmarized by System Organ Class and 
Preferred Term, by severity and by potential relationship to the 
vaccine.  Additional displays will summarize any SAEs or AEs that 
lead to withdrawal or death. 

 EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 9 of 81 Displays  of solicited and unsolicited AEs will present data separately  
for prior alphavirus vaccine recipients , alphavirus -naïve controls , 
and for all subjects combined. 
 
Sample Size and Power Considerations  
The sample size for this trial was based on the number o f subjects in 
the Fort Detrick Special Immunization/Special Procedures Program  
who are available for screening  at USAMRIID .  Of the 
approximately 60 available subjects, up to 30 are expected to enroll 
in this trial along with an equal number of alphavirus naïve age - and 
gender -matched controls. Based on an interim analysis in Study 
PXVX0317 -001, at least 95% of the alphavirus -naïve controls are 
expected to seroconvert in this t rial. Assuming that the alphavirus -
naïve group 
has
 a 95% seroconversion rate, a total sample size of 60 
subjects has 80% power to detect a significant difference between 
groups if the seroconversion rate in the prior alphavirus vaccine 
recipients is 65% or  lower . Or, in other words, power is 80% to detect 
a difference between groups if the seroconversion rate in the prior 
alphavirus recipients is 
30 percentage points lower than in the 
alphavirus -naïve group.  
Previous studies have shown impaired immune respo nses to 
chikungunya vaccines in prior recipients of live attenuated and 
inactivated alphavirus vaccines .  The decrease in seroconversion in 
two of 
these trials was 
64% and 100% respectively
 (see section 1.3) . 
Therefore , this study i s adequately powered to 
detect 
immune 
interference on the order of one -half to one -third of what has  
previously been described.  
T
he power of other combinations 
of 
seroconversion rate and sample size can be seen in Table
 
3 in section 
9.1.   
With respect to safety as a study endpoint, this study will have 80% 
power to detect a 30% difference between pre 
-
exposure groups 
in 
the incidence of any single or aggregate solicited adverse  event  
expected to occur in 5% of the subjects in one of the grou 
ps
. With a 
total of 60 subjects receiving  PXVX0317 , there is a 95% chance that 
an uncommon AE 
– 
one expected to occur in 5% of 
v 
accine
 
recipient s – 
will be observed at least once in the trial.

1.1
 
Background  
1.1.1
 
Chikungunya Virus and 
Chikungunya Fever
 
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is  an arthropod 
-
borne alphavirus of the family 
Togaviridae
. The 
CHIKV  virion contains a positive -sense single -strand RNA genome with a long open reading 
frame coding for Capsid © and Envelope (E1, E2, E3 and 6K) structural proteins, together with 
four non 
-
structural proteins . Since the first  case reports of CHIKV in a 1952 
-
1953 outbreak in 
Tanzania (
Ross 1956 
)
, this disease has been endemic in Africa and parts of Asia with transmission 
occu rring through 
Aedes
 aegypti  and more recently via 
Aedes
 
albopictus
 (
Powers 2007 
).
   
Beginning in 2014, 
CHIKV 
 
disease cases were reported among U.S. travelers returning from 
affected areas in the Americas and local transmission was identified in Florida, Puerto Rico, and 
the U.S. Virgin Islands. As of May 29, 2018 
, 
over 80 countries or territories have documented 
 
cases of CHIKV infection excluding those countries where only imported cases have been 
documented 
, as shown in 
Figure 
1
 
(
CDC 2018 
). Although mosquitoes are the primary mode of 
transmission of CHIKV, blood 
-
borne transmission via needle stick is possible. Maternal -fetal 
transmission has been documented during pregnancy (
Staples 2017 
).
 
Following an incubation period of 2 to 12 
 
days, acute clinical manifestations include high fever, 
rash, gastrointestinal complications, headache, muscle pain, nausea, fatigue, myalgia, and joint 
pain (
Borgherini 2007 
, 
Taubitz 2007 
, 
Pialoux 2007 
). The most classic symptom of chikungunya 
is a debilitating polyarthralgia that is present in greater than 90% of cases. This acute phase 
resolves within several weeks, but joint pain and arthritis may persist for months or years in 
over 
30% of infected i ndividuals  (
Schilte 2013 
)
.  
There are currently n o approved vaccines to prevent  CHIKV infection or disease.  However, 
p
rotection against subsequent infection has been shown to correlate with the presence of anti
-
CHIKV antibodies 
that neutralize the virus 
in vitro
 (
Yoon 2015 
)
.  Such antibodies are readily 
induced by 
 
this and other vaccine candidates.  But 
a 
major challenge stands in the way of  licensing 
any chikungunya vaccine : the virtual impossibility 
of conducting a field efficacy trial
, because 
outbreaks of chikungunya are so sporadic and short -lived.  From the time the first case is detected 
until the epidemic begins to subside is often less than two months (
Beesoon  2008 
)
.

1.1.2
 
Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus and Vaccines  
Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is an  alphavirus related to CHIKV (
Figure 2). 
Humans infected with  VEEV develop a febrile illness, often with severe headache, averaging 1 –5 
days after exposure. Dissipation of febrile illness coincides with the production of neutralizin g 
antibodies. The average case fatality rate of VEEV is <1%.  Children have more severe disease, 
are more likely to develop encephalitis and can be left with severe neurological complications.  
VEEV has been recognized as a potential biological weapon beca use of its high attack rate with  a 
debilitating illness and its adaptability to aerosol dissemination.  Accordingly, the US Army has 
invested  much research i n this pathogen and developed experimental vaccines to protect those who 
handle VEEV in the laborat ory ( Wolfe 201 3 ).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 of 81  Figure 2 : Phylogenetic tree of alphaviruses showing the relative positions of CHIKV and 
the IAB strain of VEEV from which the TC83 vaccine was made.  
 
Two vaccines for VEEV administered to laboratory workers at USAMRIID under IND are a live  
attenuated virus vaccine  (TC83)  and an inactivated virus vaccine  (TC84).  TC-83 was created by 
serially passaging the Trinidad Donkey VEEV strain in guinea pig heart cells and poi nt 
mutations in E2 and the 5′ untranslated region are responsible for the attenuated phenotype of 
TC-83 (Taylor 2017 ).  TC83 is the most widely used but has a significant (26%) non- response 
rate.  Non -responders who require immunity are generally offered the inactivated TC84 vaccine.    
 
Laboratory workers at USAMRIID may have also received  investigational formalin -inacti vated 
vaccines for Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEEV) and /or Western Equine Encephalitis (WEEV) 
Viruses  (Reisler 2012 ) . 
 

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 81 1.1.3 Alphavirus Immune Interference  
Over the many decades of experience with alphavirus vaccines at USAMRIID a number of studies 
have demonstrated immune responses to an alphavirus vaccine may be impaired among 
individuals who previously received a vaccine for a heterologous alphavirus.  In one such study, 
recipients of the live attenuated chikungunya vaccine developed a GMT of neutralizing antibody 
of 300 (96.6% seroconversion) while those who received the TC83 vaccine a month prior 
developed only a GMT of 10 to CHIKV and only 36% seroconver ted (McClain 1998 ).  While the 
authors attributed this to impaired replication of the live attenuated CHIKV vaccine virus due to 
cross -reacting T cells or non-neutralizing antibodies, a similar phenomenon was also observed 
when a  formalin inactivated CHIKV vaccine was given to prior recipients of VEEV, EEEV and 
WEEV vaccines ( DeMeio 1979 ).  This phenomenon has been dubbed “alphavirus immune 
interference” . While antibody responses to chikungunya were impai red in these studies of prior 
recipients of TC83, there is no evidence  that the non-responders were more susceptible to 
chikungunya.  Horses also demonstrate d impaired immune responses to the second of two 
sequential alphavirus vaccines ( Van der Wagen 1975 )( Calisher 1973 ).  Challenge studies, though 
not consistently showing cross -protection, also do not show  evidence that clinical outcomes are 
worse in prior recipients of he terologous alphavirus vaccines (Jochim 1974 ) or experimental 
infections ( Byrne  1964 ). 
 
1.2 Name and Description of Investigational  Vaccine  
PXVX0317 is the Sponsor’s research name for this Chikungunya Virus -Like Particle Vaccine 
(CHIKV -VLP vaccine) . PXVX0317 is a field -formulated vaccine with two components: CHIKV -
VLP and Alhydrogel® adjuvant .  The final dose of the CHIK -VLP  is 40mcg per vaccine dose. This 
dose was selected from preliminary data generated by the on-going PXVX -CV-317-001 P hase 2 
study [unpublished data].  CHIKV -VLP s are comprised of three recombinant CHIKV structural 
proteins derived from CHIKV Senegal strain 37997: Capsid ( C, 35 kDa), E nvelope 1 (E1, 55 kDa), 
and Envelope 2 (E2, 50 kDa) in sterile aqueous buffer.  CHIKV -VLP is essentially identical to the 
VRC -CHKVLP059 -00-VP vaccine used in the studies described below. Alhydrogel is a 2% (w/w) 
aqueous  suspension of aluminum hydroxide. 
PXVX0317 is described further in 
Section 3
.

1.2.2 Summary of Findings from Clinical Studies  
1.2.2.1 
 
VRC 
 311
 
The safety and immunogenicity of CHKVLP059 were evaluated under BB -IND 14907 in 
VRC  
311, a Phase 1 open 
-
label, dose -escalation trial. (
Chang 2014 
, 
www.clinicaltrials.gov
: 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . Healthy adult participants 18 to 50 years old were assigned to sequential dose  
level groups to receive IM injections of 10 mcg, 20 mcg, or 40 mcg (without adjuvant) on weeks 
0, 4, and 20, with follow -up for 44 weeks after enrollment. The primary endpoints were safety and 
tolerability of the vaccine. Secondary endpoints were 
CHIKV
-specific immune responses assessed 
by neutralizing antibody assay and ELISA. Post -hoc analysis of neutralizing antibody 
 
(Nab)  by 
luciferase 
-
based assay was also performed  by 
Emergent
.  
All injections were well tolerated, with no serious adverse events report ed. The most common 
local reaction was mild injection site pain (36%) and the most common systemic reaction was mild 
malaise (24%). No moderate or severe reactogenicity was observed.  
Neutralizing antibodies were detected in all dose groups after the second 
 
vaccination . The 
geometric mean titer (GMT) of the half maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 2688 in the 
10 mcg group, 1775 in the 20 
mcg
 group, and 7246 in the 40 
mcg
 group, and a significant boost 
occurred after the third vaccination in all dose groups (10 
mcg
 group p=0·0197, 20 
 
mcg
 group 
p<0·0001, and 40 
mcg
 group p<0·0001). Four weeks after the third vaccination, the GMT of the 
IC50 was 8745 for the 10 
mcg
 group, 4525 for the 20 
mcg
 group, and 5390 for the 40 
mcg
 group. 
These findings were confirmed by the  Emergent  luciferase 
-
based assay to be used for 
the 
EBSI -
CV-317-002 
trial, demonstrating the suitability of the 
Emergent assay
 [Emergent , data on file] . 
1.2.2.2 
 
VRC 
 704
 
The NIH’s VRC 704 was a Phase 2 trial conducted at 
multiple CHIK
-endemic sites in the 
Caribbean (
Chen 2018 
).  The study was a double
-blind, placebo 
-
controlled study with 200 subjects 
receiving 20 µg of CHIKV -VLP and 200 receiving placebo in a 2 
-
dose series at Weeks 0 and 4.  
The stu dy was initiated in 2016 and completed in 2018.  Approximately 20% of subjects 
demonstrated detectable anti -CHIKV neutralizing antibodies at baseline.  CHIKV -VLP appeared 
safe and well tolerated in subjects who were followed through Week 72, with no relate d SAEs or 
other safety concerns. CHIKV -VLP appeared highly immunogenic, with a GMT of 2004.5 and 
99.5% of recipients having neutralizing antibodies at Week 8.  A boosting effect of CHIKV -VLP 
was also observed in subjects with baseline anti -CHIKV neutralizi ng antibodies. 
Specimens from VRC 704 were also analyzed at 
Emergent
, using the CHIKV 181/25 luciferase 
assay.  A sub 
-
analysis was performed on subjects without pre -existing anti -CHIKV neutralizing 
activity.  Using a more stringent 80% neutralization cutoff (NT 80), the GMT was 123 at Week 4 
and 1701 at Week 8.  Although antibody levels declined with time, as would be expected, the GMT 

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 of 81  remained ≥100 for at least 18 months, indicating that long - term protection can potentially be 
achieved w ithout the need for booster doses. These results demonstrated that CHIKV -VLP was 
safe and immunogenic in adults in CHIKV -endemic areas, including those with serologic evidence 
of previous CHIKV exposure. The most frequently reported local 
adverse event
 was 
pain/tenderness at the injection site reported as mild by 
58 
of 197 (29
%) 
vaccine recipients  who 
received at least one study injection and as moderate by 3/ 197 vaccine recipients  (2.0
%). The most 
frequently reported systemic 
adverse events
 were mild or moderate headache reported by 
53 
of 
197 (27
%) 
vaccine recipients , malaise ( 53/197
, 25.6%), and myalgia (
46/197, 23.4
%). 
Placebo 
recipients reported these systemic reactogenicity symptoms at similar frequencies. 
One vaccine 
recipient (0.5%) experienced a headache graded as severe following the second vaccination. A 
total of 16 SAEs in 15 (3.8%) subjects were reported, all were assessed as unrelated to the study 
vaccine. All potentially relate d 
AEs resolved without clinical sequelae.
 
Taken toget her, the findings from VRC 311 and 
VRC
 704 suggest that a  single  dose of 
4 
0 mcg 
CHKVLP059VP is well -tolerated and immunogenic in both CHIKV -exposed and CHI KV-naïve 
adults. 
1.2.2.3 
 
PXVX 
-
CV-317-001 
The Phase 2 
PXVX 
-
CV-317-001 trial
 
is being conducted at multiple clinical trial sites in the US 
and compare s multiple regimens of PXVX0317 in over 400 
health
y adults .  The dosages of 
CHIKV -VLP in th at study range from 6 mcg to 40 mcg. These doses are below or approximately 
equivalent to those used in VRC 311 and VRC 704 
. 
Adverse reactions to PXVX0317 following 
any injection included: injection site pain (41.4% subjects), injection site redness (1.0%), injection 
site swelling (0.5%), malaise (14.2%), nausea (13.0%), headache (27.2%), joint pain (9.6%), 
fatigue (19.5%), chill s (6.5%), fever (1.7%), and myalgia (22.7%). The majority of solicited AEs 
following any injection were mild 
or moderate; 6% of subjects reported at least one solicited AE 
that was graded as severe 
. No solicited events were potentially life threatening. 
 
Interim analys es 
of these data are the basis for the regimen proposed in this study: 40  mcg with alum adjuvant in 
a 
single dose .  See 
Section 1.3.1 
.

Rationale  
for the Current Study
 
and Military Relevance
 
This clinical trial is designed to develop our understanding of immunologic cross -reactivity 
between alphaviruses as it pertains to this chikungunya vaccine candidate.  Specifically, this study 
will help us determine: (1) Does previ ous exposure to heterologous alphavirus antigens 
diminish 
or enhance the immune response to this chikungunya vaccine candidate? And: (2) Does this 
chikungunya vaccine candidate boost pre -existing or induce de novo immune responses to other 
alphaviruses?   
If alphavirus immune interference is seen with this chikungunya vaccine, interpretation of post -
vaccination titers in field studies will have to account for previous alphavirus exposure, and 
additional studies will be required to determine if this 
diminish
ed response leads to decreased 

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 81  efficacy in preventing chikungunya disease.  The possibility of alphavirus immune interference is 
also of particular relevance to the US Department of Defense 
 
which has for years i nvested in the 
development of 
vaccines for VE
EV, EEE 
V
 and WEE V because of their potential use as biological 
weapons  (
Wolfe 2013 
)
.  If the entire force is to be vaccinated against these viruses, it will be 
important to know if and how concurrent or subsequent administration of  a chikungunya vaccine 
will be impacted.  
Regarding (2), the question of whether this vaccine candidate will boost or induce humoral and 
cellular immune responses to other alphaviruses is also relevant to the design of field studies.  
While conducting a fie ld efficacy study of a vaccine against CHIKV appears epidemiologically 
impossible, it may be possible to design a study of that same candidate to show 
whether it impacts 
immunity to related  alphavirus es that are considered  potential pandemic threats (
Hotez 2017 
)
 
(
Lwande 2015 
).
  
E
xperts have recommended Iquitos, Peru, as a suitable location for a field study 
of a chikungunya vaccine based on recurring epidemics of dengue , which shares the same 
mosquito vector  as CHIKV  (
Rezza 2019
). In addition, transmissi on of VEEV and Mayaro viruses 
occurs in some districts of Iquitos , making this a potential site for testing the vaccine’s impact on 
immunity to those viruses 
(
Forshey 2010
)(
Morrison 2008 
).
 
The population 
 
available to participate in this study at Fort Detrick 
(USAMRIID) 
provides a 
unique opportunity to study both whether pre -existing immunity to alphaviruses impacts the anti -
CHIKV immune response and whether the vaccine elicits cross -reactive immune respon ses to 
other alphaviruses. Researchers will have the opportunity to conduct in 
-
depth immune analyses on 
individuals serially exposed to antigens from multiple alphaviruses.  Serum 
w
ill
 
be collected for 
the determination of neutralizing, 
total 
, and cross
-reacting antibodies.  Resources are also available 
to collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for comparison 
s
 of cellular immune 
responses to this vaccine  among those with and without prior alphavirus immunity.  
In addition, this study allows us to closely study the safety of this vaccine in individuals with 
previous alphavirus immunity.  This vaccine has already been 
 
used in several hundred individuals, 
including about 70 with previous chikungunya exposure , and no concerning safety signals have 
emerged.  There is little reason to suspect that previous vaccination with a heterologous alphavirus 
will enhance the reactogenicity of this vaccine particularly amon g this group of participants , many 
of whom have already received multiple alphavirus vaccines without any unique safety signal 
emerging.  Nevertheless, this study will provide additional safety data on this vaccine among those 
previously exposed to live at tenuated VEEV to better assure the investigators and inform the 
consent of participants who will receive this vaccine in areas endemic for VEEV and other 
alphaviruses.  
 

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 of 81  1.3.1 Rationale for Dosage  and Route of Administration  
The regimen of PXVX -0317 selected for 
this study is 40 mcg of VLP plus alum adjuvant 
administered in 
a single 
IM dose on Day 1.  This regimen was selected by an interim analysis of 
the study PXVX -0317- 001 referenced above.  All regimens tested were given to groups of 50 to 
53 healthy adults an 
d all resulted in 1
00% seroconversion by Day 57 
.  The
 group receiving 40 
mcg plus alum showed the highest proportion developing and maintaining 
neutralization titers 
above 1:640 ( 44
%) 
at Day 182 
and was therefore selected for further development.

Benefits and Risks of Study Participation  
1.4.1
 
Benefits of Study Participation  
There is no expected benefit to subjects from this study.  A potential benefit of participation in 
this clinical trial might be protection against chikungunya virus infection, howeve r the clinical 
efficacy of this vaccine for that indication has not yet been proven.  This study will accumulate 
additional safety data on this vaccine and uniquely provide a first glimpse at the safety and 
immunogenicity of this vaccine in the context of prior alphavirus exposure.  This data will be 
important to the design of field studies.  If, for example, the vaccine is less immunogenic in those 
with prior alphavirus immunity, field studies in areas where other alphaviruses are endemic 
should 
account fo
r this in determin ing appropriate  immunogenicity end- points.  In addition, the 
in-depth immune analyses planned for the samples collected in this study may yield insights 
relevant to the VEEV vaccine development effort.  
 
1.4.2
 
Risks of Study Participation  
1.4.2.1 
 
Risks 
with 
PXVX0317
 
The injection of 
PXVX0317 
, like other injections, can cause pain, redness, or swelling at the 
injection site. These types of reactions are generally mild. Less commonly, it can cause itching, 
bruising, or infection.   
In an earlier study, the majority of side effects following any injection were mild (29.6%) or 
moderate (21%) and rarely were severe (7.2%). These types of reactions usually happen within a 
day after injection and typically last 1 to 3 days.  The most rece 
nt data on the incidence of adverse 
events following PXVX0317 are provided in Section 1.2.2.3.   
PXVX0317  does not contain any CHIKV virus and 
can
not cause CHIKV infection. There may be 
other side effects from PXVX0317  that are not common and that we do not yet know about. 
Participants will be advised to tell the study staff about any side effects they may think they are 
having. 
For the study population who will continue to require investigational vaccines for potential 
occupational exposures, there is a hypothetical risk that 
PXVX0317
 could influence the immune 

 EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 81  responses to subsequent alphavirus vaccines.  Whether this influence would be positive or 
negative is 
unknown 
.  Considerable experience has accumulated at USAMRIID with repeated 
administration of multiple alphavirus vaccines in this population with no evidence yet of 
clinically significant adverse health effects (
Pittman  2004 
). 
 
1.4.2.2 
 
Risk of Allergic Reaction  
With any vaccine, there is a risk of severe allergic reaction.  Although such reactions have not been 
reported with this vaccine, they have occurred with other vaccines containing some of the same 
ingredients.  Symptoms o f allergic reaction include:  
• Rash  
• Wheezing and difficulty breathing  
• Difficulty swallowing  
• Dizziness and fainting  
• Swelling around the mouth, throat or eyes  
• A fast pulse  
• Sweating  
 
Participants will be directed to inform study staff immediately if experienci 
ng any of these 
symptoms.  
1.4.2.3 
 
Risks with Blood Draws  
Blood drawing may cause pain, bruising, feeling faint, fainting, needle site infections, swelling, 
and rarely other infections. Bruising at the site of blood drawing can be prevented by applying 
pressure for 
 
several minutes. To reduce the risk of infection, we will wipe the area clean with 
alcohol and use sterile (germ -free) equipment.  
1.4.2.4 
 
Risks of Positive Screening Test for HIV, Hepatitis B and C  
At the Screening visit, participants will be tested for hepatitis  B and C and HIV. If blood tests 
show that a participant has HIV or hepatitis B or C, study staff are required by law to report this 
information to the Maryland Health Department. Participants will be informed of this.  The test 
results reported to Marylan 
d Health Department will contain the participant’s name, contact 
information, including address and telephone numbers, and the type of testing that was done. If 
the participant is in the military, study staff are required to report the same kind of informa tion to 
military preventive medicine service. As a result, this information may end up in the subject’s 
military medical record and may be reported to their chain of command.  
 
Receiving information that any health screening tests are abnormal or that tests for HIV and 
hepatitis B or C are positive may upset participants.  The study doctors will discuss their health 
results face -to-face (and notify their primary doctor at their r equest).  Counseling will be available 
to the study subject, if they wish. A positive HIV status could limit a participant’s ability to obtain 

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 30 of 81  future life and health insurance.  In rare circumstances, a positive HIV test has led to discrimination 
in employment and housing, etc.  Participants will be advised of this in the informed consent form.  
1.4.2.5 
 
Risks to Pregnancy  
If potential participants 
are 
females who can become pregnant and want to take part in this study, 
they will be informed that 
PXVX0317
 has not been thoroughly evaluated for potential risks to 
unborn or nursing children.  Participants will be instructed not to get pregnant or breastfeed while 
taking part in this study. Female participants must have a negative pregnancy test at screening a nd 
again immediately before vaccination, however pregnancy tests are not 100% accurate.  
Participants will be advised that the only completely reliable methods of birth control are not 
having sex or surgical removal of the uterus.  Other methods, such as t he use of condoms, a 
diaphragm or cervical cap, birth control pills, IUD, or sperm killing products are not totally 
effective in preventing pregnancy.   
If a participant becomes pregnant or feels she might be pregnant, she will be advised to contact 
her pe rsonal physician and the principal investigator of this study.  If a participant becomes 
pregnant, the study team will ask permission to contact her regarding the outcome of her 
pregnancy.  
1.4.2.6 
 
Risks to Confidentiality  
Efforts will be made to keep participants’  personal health information confidential.  In order to 
maintain confidentiality, paper study records will be stored in a secure location such as a locked 
office or locked cabinet. Electronic data will be password -protected. Electronic study records and 
samples taken will be coded with a number, not the participants’ names. Records will only be 
shared with authorized personnel and only in connection with carrying out the obligations relating 
to the study.  
Although efforts are made to protect the research s tudy records, there is always a risk that someone 
could get access to the personal information in research records or other information researchers 
have stored about participants.

3.1 Investigational Vaccine (PXVX0317)  
See also 
section 1.2
. 
3.1.1 CHIKV -VLP  
CHIKV -VLP refers to the  virus -like particle (VLP) component of PXVX -0317 produced by 
transient transfect ion of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells with a DNA expression 
plasmid encoding Capsid (C) and E3, E2, 6K, and E1 proteins. After expression of the plasmid -
encoded proteins, VLPs self -assemble and are released into the cell culture medium as ~70 nm 
particles. The 6K and E3 proteins have not been spec ifically detected in the VLPs . No replication -
capable viral genetic material is incorporated into the VLPs.  VLPs are then concentrated from the 
cell supernatant and purified.  After purification, the VLPs are diluted into a sucrose -containing 
aqueous buffer, sterile -filtered and filled into sterile single -dose glass vials to create the final 
CHIKV -VLP drug product.  The production process does not use animal -derived raw materials or 
antibiotics. Process res iduals (including host cell and recombinant DNA, host cell protein, and 
Benzonase®) were assessed to be at acceptable levels.  All excipients are generally regarded as 
safe (GRAS).  
The CHIK V-VLP drug product is a sterile aqueous buffered solution filled into 3 mL  single -use 
glass vials with a  0.8 mL fill volume. The vial is sealed with a rubber stopper and an aluminum 
seal with a blue flip -off cap.  The drug product is stored in a qualified, temperature -controlled 
freezer at ≤ –70°C . See the Pharma cy Manual for additional information on vaccine storage and 
preparation. 
The composition of CHIKV -VLP drug product  (Lot Number 1- FIN-2949) is shown in 
Table

4.1
 
Recruitment and compensation for study participation 
 
Informed consent will be obtained prior to any study procedures. Prior to agreeing to participate 
in the study, volunteers at either site will participate in an information session about the study. The 
investigator or designee will explain the study, outline participation requirem ents, review the 
consent form in detail with volunteers, and then answer any questions. Volunteers will then be 
afforded ample time to read the informed consent form and ask questions. If a volunteer decides 
to participate , he/she will sign and date the informed consent document.  
  
The recruitment process will in general be similar for both military and civilian personnel. 
However, special effort will be made to ensure that military personnel are not unduly influenced 
or coerced into participating by individuals of superior rank or position. A signed copy of the 
informed consent will be provided to the volunteer before any study procedure is performed.  
 
 
4.1.1
 
Recruitment at USAMRIID  
Recruitment will be done  via web -based advertising (USAMRIID E -news), recruitmen t flyers and 
email blasts . The target population for this study is not in the chain of command of the study team, 
and also very few (if any) Alpha -virus vaccinated personnel are active duty military.  Thus, group 
briefings of military members (e .g. in formation), where influence of rank would possibly be of 
concern, are not planned.   
 
4.1.2
 
Recruitment at WRAIR  
Subjects will be recruited by the WRAIR CTC through the use of newspaper ads, flyers, and 
posters along with ads on 
C
raigslist, Facebook , Instagra m or other social media websites. Web -
based advertising ( www. clinicaltrials. army.mil 
), word of mouth, and the 
WRAIR CTC database 
will be used to contact clinical trial volunteers. Potential volunteers of 
any
 ethnic background, 
education, and income will be  residents of the Washington, DC, metropolitan area. An institutional 
review board (IRB) -approved recruitment script will be read during all phone and face -to-face 
contacts with potential study subjects. All recruitment materials will be submitted to the W RAIR 
IRB for review and approval prior to use. Recruitment will be by non- coercive means.  
 
 
4.1.3
 
Volunteer compensation for participation  
Subjects will receive compensation for their participation in this study. Study volunteers will be 
provided a 
gift ca
rd for 
 
screening and debit card or direct deposit for enrolled visits 
from the 
WRAIR CTC 
or USAMRIID SIP study team as compensation.  The schedule for compensation is 
detailed in the ICF.

4.2
 
Informed Consent  
The Investigator must obtain informed consent from study participants prior to starting any study 
-
related activities. All prospective subjects must sign and date an Institutional Review Board (IRB) -
approved informed consent form (ICF)  following receipt of the study informational briefing and 
an opportunity for question and answer from study investigators and staff . In order to participate 
in the study, volunteers must also sign a separate consent form for HIV testing.  
For further details 
on informed consen 
t, refer to 
S
ection 10
.4
. 
4.3
 
Screening  
Screening procedures are listed in the Schedule of Events in 
Appendix A
. 
Each subject who signs an ICF will receive a sequential three -digit identificatio n number unique 
to the site 
(
e.g.
, 001, 002…). When screening information is entered into the EDC a subject will 
be assigned a subject 
identification 
number with the following format: C V317002- two-digit site 
number -three digit 
identification 
number, e.g., CV317002- 01-001. Subject numbers will also be 
sequential since screen failed subjects will be entered into the EDC system.  
Each site will maintain a screening 
enrollment 
log to record the enrollment or the reason(s) for 
screen failure for all subjects who receive a 
subject identification 
number. 
Reason for screen failure 
will also be captured in the EDC disposition eCRF.  
Re-screening : 
Subjects who 
meet exclusion criterion 
1 
(acute febrile illness) at the time of their scheduled 
enrollment may be re -screen ed after resolution of their acute illness . Subjects who meet exclusion 
criteria 6, 8, 14 
 
or 15 (prohibited travel, 
medications
, vaccines  or partic ipation in another clinical 
trial)  may be re -screened after the appropriate duration has passed.  
There may be situations in 
which an eligi ble subject is not able to be 
vaccina 
ted within 6
0 days of their screening period 
. 
Their participation  will requir e undergoing all screening procedures again 
, 
including re -consenting 
and use of the same subject ID number .   
4.4
 
Medical History  
Medical history information will be collected from subjects at the Screening Visit and 
confirmed 
at the Day 1  (Baseline) Visit and wi 
ll include (but not 
be 
limited to) demographic information, 
current and past medical conditions, and prior and concomitant 
medications taken within 
30 
days 
of Day 1 . For subjects at USAMRIID,  records of all  vaccines received through the SIP will also 
be included.  
4.5
 
Physical Examination  
A physical examination will be performed on subjects during the Screening Visit.  

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 of 81  The examination should include:  
•
 
Height  
•
 
Weight  
•
 
General physical exam 
 
A directed physical exam m ay be performed on subjects at additional time points if indicated by 
AE reporting.  
4.6
 
Vital Signs  
Vital signs collected from subjects will include blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature. 
The 
first set of screening vitals are to be collected and transcr ibed into the screening eCRF for inclusion 
 
of the subject into the study 
. 
 Vital signs will be checked up to the Day 29 visit and at the 
investigator’s discretion thereafter.  
4.7
 
Laboratory Tests  
The schedule of sample collection is shown in 
Appendix A
. Phlebotomy will observe the American 
Red Cross limit of no more than 450 mL in any 8 
-
week period. Further details regarding specimen 
collection, processing and shipping will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
4.7.1
 
Safety labs  
At screening, blood will be collected for serum testing for 
HBV 
, HCV and HIV
 and seropositive 
subjects excluded .  Overall health will be assessed with a complete blood count , creatinine, and 
liver associated enzymes (AST/ALT)  at screening and 
Days 
1 and 8.
 
4.7.2
 
Assays of humoral immunity  
Neutralizing antibody 
 
to CHIKV  will be 
assessed 
by a luciferase 
-
based anti -CHIKV neutralization 
assay  (NT 80) at Day 1  (pre-vaccination) and on Days 8, 22, 29, 57 and 182 . Total a ntibody to 
chikungunya will also be assess ed by immunoassay 
 
on Days 1 (pre-vaccination) , 22 and 29 
.
  
Neutralizing and total antibody to VEEV will be determined by PRNT 80 and an immunoassay, 
respectively, on Days 1, 22 
 
and 29
.  
Additional sera will be collected 
for exploratory analyses 
including assays of humoral immunity to EEEV and WEEV in selected subjects . Collected 
samples will also be used to evaluate neutralizing antibody titers to alphaviruses at Day 1 
 
(pre-
vaccination) , Day 22, and Day 182.   
4.7.3
 
Assays of cellular immunity  
PBMCs for assays of cell mediated -immunity will be collected on Days 1, 8, 29, 57 and 182.  
Cellular immune response characterization will focus on the magnitude and quality of anti -CHIKV 
and anti -VEEV responses. Peptides have been designed to cover the st ructural polyprotein 
(15mers, 10 overlap) of both pathogens. ELISPOT (Mabtech) analysis of samples will be 

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 of 81  conducted with large peptide pools in order to identify pools eliciting IFNγ  responses. Once 
immunogenic large pools have been identified, a more ref ined re -stimulation with overlapping 
peptide pools will be conducted to identify specific epitopes eliciting either response. Identification 
of those peptides will inform on immunogenic regions of the viral proteins, which may assist in 
determining whether  there are conserved epitopes in the alphaviruses that elicit a potentially cross -
reactive immune response. 
 
Concurrent with ELISPOT studies, supernatant will be collected after re -stimulation to assess a 
broader cytokine and chemokine panel in response to 
 
the peptide pools.   The panel will include 
IL4, IL15, and IL12, which are suggestive of Th2 and Th1 profile immune responses. A MagPix 
multiplex cytokine and chemokine array will be used for this analysis. These data will provide a 
preliminary readout of  virus -specific immunity and may help identify peptide pools with T helper 
epitopes missed by the IFNγ readout. 
 
4.7.4
 
Samples collected for future research  
Coded s era, plasma, and PBMCs collected but not used for the above assays will 
be retained for a 
minimum o f five years .  These will be stored at WRAIR , USAMRIID 
, 
and Emergent  Travel Health  
Inc. under  appropriate storage conditions. Samples will be labeled with, at a minimum, a subject 
ID, time point, and protocol information but will not be labeled with 
 
any personal identifying 
information. Samples  may be shared during the course of the study for protocol -defined analyses 
or storage.  Research not defined in the protocol or transfer  of samples after study completion or 
to other institutions , will only occur 
wit
h the approval of the 
storing institution’s 
appropriate 
oversight authority.  
4.8
 
Pregnancy Testing 
and Contraception
 
Female subjects of childbearing potential will undergo a 
urine 
pregnancy test at screening and 
prior to 
the 
injection , and again at Day 29 after the injection.  The Investigator must report any 
pregnancies as described in 
Sect
ion 6 
.7.1 
. 
Female subjects of childbearing potential must also 
use 
a highly effective method of contraception 
(failure rate <1% per year) 
throughout the study period.  
Highly effective forms of contraception 
include
 combined estrogen and progestogen containing or 
progestogen- only hormonal contraception associated with 
 
inhibition of ovulation, IUD, 
intrauterine hormone -releasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion, abstinence , or vasectomized 
partner.  The Investigator must confirm that contraception methods 
were initiated 
at least 30 days 
prior 
to 
Day 1
 (e.g. hormonal contraception) to be considered fully effective.  
4.9
 
Study Vaccine 
Administration
 
On Day 
1 
before study vaccine administration, the 
interim 
medical history  will be 
reviewed
 and 
updated in the subject file , a targeted clinical exam will be performed, 
blood 
samples  will be 
collected, and f emales of childbearing potential will
 
have a urine pregnancy test. Immediately p rior 
to study vaccine 
 
administration , staff 
will verify
 that the subject is still eligible. 
On
ce these 

 EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 of 81  procedures are performed  and if the subject is still eligible  study vaccine will be administered . 
Study vaccine is  0.8 mL in volume and 
 
administered by intramuscular injection as described in the 
Pharmacy Manual , using universal precautions and st erile technique. 
The 
injection will be 
administered into the deltoid muscle  by a staff member delegated by the Investigator . Which 
deltoid to use  will be at the discretion of the 
administering
 staff member  with consideration 
for 
 
subject preference and feat ures that may obscure interpretation of any local AEs such as tattoos, 
scars or other lesions.     
4.10
 
Acute 
 Observation
 
The subject  will be monitored by study staff  for signs of an acute adverse reaction 
for 30 minutes 
after 
the
 
injection
 and vital signs 
will be 
repeated
 between  30 and 60 
minutes after injection
. 
4.11
 
Solicited Adverse Events  
Solicited AEs will be collected for  7 days after 
the 
injection . AEs that correspond to solicited AE 
terms but occur outside of (or continue past) the soli cited AE collection period are also collected 
through the unsolicited AE reporting period. 
 
Solicited ad verse events for this study are  local events 
of pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site and systemic events 
of
 fever with 
oral 
temperature ≥ 100.4 F , 
chills, malaise, 
fatigue, 
headache,
 myalgia, 
arthralgia
, 
and
 nausea .  
Subjects will be trained to complete a memory aid to observe, measure, and  
record these 
 
solicited 
AEs. To measure oral temperature, a digital thermometer will be provided to the  subject to measure 
their temperature each day and record them in their memory aid. To record  injection site local 
reaction s, a ruler will be provided to the subject to measure the diameter of redness 
or
 
swelling 
at 
the largest point of the reaction 
each d
ay and record them in their memory aid.  
Study staff will review the signs and symptoms recorded on the memory aid 
and 
the action taken 
for the 
event
 at subsequent visits . 
The memory aid will be collected 
and maintained in the subject 
file but the final de termination of each adverse event name, onset and resolution dates, severity 
and causality will be made by the Investigator .  Severity will be graded according to the Toxicity 
Grading Scale (Appendix B).  
The
 results of the Investigator’s assessment will b e recorded as a 
separate source document from the memory aid 
and 
will be 
entered o
n the 
corresponding 
(solicited)  
adverse event eCRF
.  
4.12
 
Unsolicited 
Adverse 
E
vents  
Unsolicited adverse events (any AEs not listed 
on the memory aid) will be collected for 
this study 
and details on definition, evaluation, reporting periods and documentation are outlined in 
Section 
6.
  
4.13
 
Prior and Concomitant Medications  
At the screening visit, the details of prior and concomitant medications  (through 30 days 
prior 
to 
Day 1 ) usage will be collected. For subjects at USAMRIID, this will include all vaccines received 

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 of 81  through the SIP.  The details of all concomitant medications  taken fr om Day 1 through Day 29 
will be captured .
  
C
oncomitant medications associated with a SAE will be collected through 
the 
end of the study.  
4.14
 
Prohibited Medications  
Subjects m ust 
not have received o
r be planning to receive : 
•
 
Systemic immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory medications (e.g. 
chemotherapeuti cs, oral corticosteroids)  from 30 days prior to 
Day 1
 through 
Day 
29.
 
•
 
Licensed vacc 
ines from 
30 days
 
prior 
to 
Day 1
 through 
Day 
29.
 
•
 
Investigational agents from 30 days prior to 
Day 1
 through the duration of study 
participation .  
The history of a ll prohibited med 
ication
s at any time during study participation (regardl ess of 
association with an AE) will be collected.   
4.15
 
Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation 
 
(PD) 
 
is defined as any occurrence involving a procedure that did not follow 
the study protocol , applicable procedures, and/or regulatory requirements.  The Investigator is 
responsible for conducting the study in accordance with the protocol. Any deviation from the 
protocol must be documented in the study file. In addition, deviations must be report ed to the IRB 
as applicable. Subject -specific deviations must be recorded in the subject’s source documents and 
in the subject’s protocol deviation eCRF. The  Sponsor  will review all protocol deviations on an 
ongoing basis and will be responsible for categorizing protocol deviations as Impor tant Protocol 
Deviations (IPDs) 
-
 the subset of protocol deviations that may significantly impact the 
completeness, accuracy, and/ or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a 
subject's rights, safety, or well -being. PDs will be promptly reported to the Sponsor in accordance 
with the Clinical 
Monitoring Plan.  
All staff involved in the conduct of a clinical tria l will be aware of the specific protocol 
requirements for completing study visits and notify the PI in the event of any breach of protocol 
according to the following procedures.   
•
 
Notify the PI as soon as possible if they are not present when the deviation is discovered.  
 
•
 
Document in the volunteer’s study chart all protocol deviations directly involving or 
affecting the volunteer, and document a thorough explanation of the circumstances 
leading up to the deviation.   
 
•
 
The requirement and timeline for report ing protocol deviations to the HSP B/WRAIR IRB 
is determined by the categorization of the deviation: important  protocol deviation 
or 

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44 of 81  protocol deviation. 
 
•
 
Knowledge of any instances of serious or continuing non- compliance with the regulations 
or requirements  
will be reported immediately to the WRAIR IRB. 
 
 
•
 
Important protocol  deviations are departures from protocol that have a potential to affect 
the rights and the research participant, to increase the risk to the participant, to change the 
willingness of the volunteer to continue participation or to compromise the integrity of 
the study data in such a way that the study objectives may not be achieved.  
IPDs
 
that 
occur in greater than minimal risk protocol wi ll be reported to the WRAIR IRB  through 
HSPB by the P I or designate, within 48 hours of becoming aware of the event and 
recorded in the deviation study log, and a written report submitted within 10 working 
days of becoming aware of the deviation.  All reports will be submitted with a cover 
memo naming the pr otocol, description of the event, summary of any harm to study 
participant(s) and steps to prevent further deviations.  A summary of IPDs occurring 
within the reporting period should also be included in the continuing review reports.  
 
•
 
Protocol  deviations a re routine departures that typically involve a volunteer’s failure to 
comply with the protocol.  Example: missing scheduled visits.  Protocol  deviations that 
occur in greater than minimal risk protocols will be reported to the WRAIR IRB through 
HSPB in the  Continuing Review Report(s).   
 
4.16
 
Study 
Completion: For 
Individual Subjects
 
An individual subject is considered to 
have 
complete d study participatio n after completion of th 
e 
Day 
182 
visit 
 and any required safety follow
-up.  
4.17
 
Early Discontinuation  
An individual subject is considered to undergo Early Discontinuation if they stop study 
 
participation before 
the 
Day 
182 
visit 
. 
An enrolled subject may voluntarily withdraw consent for further participati 
on at any time before 
study completion. The Investigator will request (but cannot require) such subjects to provide the 
reason(s) for withdrawal of consent and to undergo an Early Discontinuation visit .
  
Samples and 
data already collected will be analyzed as part of the ITT population.  
In addition, the Investigator, at his or her discretion, may withdraw a subject from further 
vaccination or from any further participation in the study.   
4.17.1 
 
Criteria for withdrawal from further study particip ation  
The following are criteria for withdrawing subjects from further study participation. 

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 45 of 81  • Loss to follow -up – Loss to follow -up requires failure to show up for a visit, and unable 
to be reached to re -schedule.  D ocumentation 
will be made
 
of at least 3 unsuccessful 
attempts to contact subjects.  
 
•
 
Noncompliance with the protocol  
•
 
Other reason(s) which, in the opinion of the Investigator, indicate (s) 
that further 
participation in the study is not in the best interest of the subject or study s taff. 
 
4.18
 
Subject Replacement  
Subjects who undergo Early Discontinuation 
at either site 
before
 Day 29 may be replaced at the 
Sponsor’s discretion.  Should a subject who previously received an alphavirus vaccine withdraw, 
a replacement for this cohort will be 
enrolled.  If an age and gender
-matched alphavirus -naïve 
subject has already been enrolled for the withdrawn subject, they will not be compelled to leave 
the study.  Should an alphavirus naïve subject who has been age and gender -matched to a prior 
alphavir us vaccine recipient withdraw, they will be replaced by a new alphavirus naïve subject 
that is age and gender -matched to the same prior alphavirus vaccine recipient.  
4.19
 
Study Completion 
: Overall
 
The study is planned to be complete d after all su bjects have com pleted the Day 182 visit (or Early 
Discontinuation 
, as appropriate
), all necessary safety follow -up has been completed, and all data 
has been monitored and queries are resolved. The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study 
prior to the planned study completion.

6.1
 
Definition s 
6.1.1
 
Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant , regardless of 
the suspected causal relationship with study vaccine .  
The definition of an AE includes : 
•
 
A 
new
-onset symptom or disease  
•
 
An exacerbation of a pre -existing symptom or disease  
•
 
A new -onset laboratory abnormality considered by the Investigator to be clinically 
significant  
•
 
A new -onset symptom or disease that occurs as a result of a protocol -specified procedure  
The definition of an AE does 
not
 include:  
•
 
A pre -existing 
symptom or disease
 that does not worsen during the study 
(even if 
first 
disclosed by the subject after the start of the study)  
•
 
A 
medical or surgical 
intervention 
such as 
surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, or 
transfusion (although the condition leading to the procedure or a complication from the 
procedure 
may be an AE)
 
•
 
An uncomplicated pregnancy  
•
 
A dosing error without any resulting signs or symptoms  
•
 
Any other 
situation w
here an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred ( e.g. 
hospitalization  
for cosmetic 
or other 
elective
 
medical or
 
surg
ical procedure ) 
The Investigator 
will 
 
attempt to establish a diagnosis based on signs, symptoms, and other clinical 
information. Whenever possible, 
the Investigator will report 
a
n AE as a 
 
diagnosis rather than one 
or more 
signs
 or symptom s. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality meets the definiti 
on 
of an AE, a diagnosis or clinical signs and symptoms rather than the abnormal laboratory finding 
should be report ed if possible. If no diagnosis is known and clinical signs and symptoms are not 
present, but the laboratory abnormality is 
clinically significant by itself, 
then 
it should be report ed 
as the AE .  
6.1.2
 
Solicited Adverse Event  
A solic ited adverse event (solicited 
AE)
 is a protocol -specified AE about which the Investigator 
or designee proactively asks the subjects during a protocol -specified time period.  Solicited adverse 
events for this study are  local events of 
pain, redness, 
and 
swelling at the injection site and systemic 
events of fever with 
oral temperature ≥ 
100.4 F , fatigue, chills, malaise, 
headache,
 myalgia, 
arthralgia , and na usea.   

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 51 of 81  6.1.3 Unsolicited Adverse Event  
An unsolicited adverse event (unsolicited AE) is an AE that is spontaneously reported by the 
subject or discovered by the Investigator.  
6.1.4
 
Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is an AE 
(either solicited or unsolicited) which meets any of the following criteria:
 
•
 
Results in death  
•
 
Is life -threatening  
•
 
Requires hospitalization or prolongs an 
existing hospitalization 
 
•
 
Results in a persistent clinically significant disability or incapacity  
•
 
Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
•
 
Requires  medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes  
•
 
Important medical event  
The Investigator will evaluate all AEs for seriousness using  
the above criteria.
  
“Life-threatening ” means that , in the opinion of the Investigator, 
the subject was
 at immediate risk 
of death from the event as it occurred. It does not mean that the event  might have caused death 
had 
it occurred in a more severe form.  
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre 
-
existing condition that did not worsen during the 
study is not considered an S AE. 
 
Important medical events may be 
considered serious at the discretion of the Investigator
. 
These seriousness criteria also apply to the Study Stopping Rules in 
Section 
6.9 
. 
6.2
 
Severity 
Grading
 
The Investigator  will grade all adverse events for severity . Adverse event s listed in  the Toxicity 
Grading Scale in  
Appendix B
 will be graded according to the criteria in the table .
 
Adverse events 
not listed in the Toxicity Grading Scale will be graded as follows:  
•
 
Mild (Grade 1) 
– 
No interference with activity  
•
 
Moderate (Grade 2) 
– 
Some interf
erence with activity  
•
 
Severe (Grade 3) 
– 
Significant; prevents daily activity
 
•
 
Potentially Life -Threatening (Grade 4)

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 52 of 81  6.3 Causality Assessment  
The Investigator will assess all 
 
AEs, including solicited AEs,  for c ausa
lity 
(relationship to study 
vaccine), assigning one of these three categories: Not Related, Possibly Related, and Probably 
Related.  
An AE will be considered “ Not Related ” to study vaccine 
 
if any
 
of the following 
conditions
 are 
met:
 
•
 
An unreasonable temporal  relationship between administration of the study vaccine and 
the onset of  
the AE (
e.g., the event occurred either before, or too long after administration 
of the study vaccine  
for it to be considered related);
 
•
 
A causal relationship between the 
study vaccine
 and the AE is biologically implausible 
(e.g. injury as a passenger in an a utomobile accident);  
•
 
A clear alternative causality  for the AE is present ( e.g. 
typical adverse rea 
ction to a 
concomitant medication ). 
An AE will be considered 
“Possibly 
related ” if there 
is a reasonable possibility that the 
AE
 may 
have been caused by the study vaccine . 
An AE will be considered 
“Probably 
related ” if there is evidence  that the AE was caused  by the 
study vaccine . 
6.4
 
Follow -up 
of Adverse Events
 
The Investigator must follow a ll AEs until resolution, until the condition stabilizes  
or is
 no longer 
clinically significant, or until th e subject is lost to follow -up. 
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the conduct of any supplemental investigations 
considered necessary to 
evaluate 
the AE. These  may include additional laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other  health care 
professionals.  
Subjects will be instructed to contact the Investigator (or designee) 
immediately
 in the event of 
a 
non-fatal SAE .  All subjects experiencing an SAE will be 
evaluated
 by the Investigator or designee 
as soon as is feasible follow ing the report of the SAE  by the subject . In the event of a fatal SAE, 
the Investigator must provide the 
Sponsor with any 
available post-mortem findings, including 
histopathology.  
Additionally, the Sponsor  may request that the Investigator perform or arran ge for the conduct of 
supplemental  investigations  for one or more AEs . 
 

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 53 of 81  6.5 Reporting of Adverse Events  
6.5.1
 
Reporting Periods  
The reporting period for solicited AEs begin 
s
 immediately after the injection and continue s for 7 
days. The reporting period for 
unsolicited
 AEs begins  immediately  after study vaccine 
administration on 
Day 1
 and continues for 28 days after wards . AEs that correspond to solicited 
 
AE terms 
but 
occur outside of (or continue past)  the solicited AE  collection peri od are also  
collected  through the unsolicited AE reporting period 
. 
The reporting period for SAEs begins at the 
time of informed consent and continues for the duration of study participation. 
 
6.5.2
 
Documentation  
The Investigator or designee will document all AEs in the subject’s source documents and enter 
all AEs in the adverse event eCRF within 
3 
calendar days of awareness
. 
All 
AE
s should include:  
•
 
Event term , 
•
 
Start and stop date ,  
•
 
Severity , 
•
 
Serious and if so, 
by which criteria,
 
•
 
Relationship to study vaccine , 
•
 
If medical care required for the AE (medically attended).  
 
6.6
 
SAE  
Reporting
 
Serious Adverse Events will be reported in a prospective manner during the period starting from 
the day of the enrollment of each su 
bject until completion of the last study visit.  
T
he Investigator  
or designee  must report all 
SAEs to 
the Medical Monitor
 (MM) and DoD Research Monitor 
(DoDRM)  within 24 hours 
of their awareness
 of the event , using the SAE Form . 
The Investigator 
or designe e must also enter SAEs in the adverse event eCRF.   Related SAEs s hould be promptly 
(within 48 hours) reported by the I nvestigator to the WRAIR IRB as a UPIRTSO  (related SAEs 
are unexpected and are presumed to place 
subjects 
at risk until proven otherwise) and by the 
Sponsor to the FDA as a SUSAR .  Immediate and prompt notifications should be in the form of 
email, phone, or fax.   
The SAE F orm should be completed as thoroughly as possible and signe d by the Investigator or  
designee before 
reporting
 to the MM
. 
The SAE Form must include an assessment of causality  and 
should include a preliminary diagnosis if possible .
  
All SAEs assessed as not related must include 
an alternate causality.  

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 54 of 81  In order to avoid delays  in initial reporting , additional information  rega rding the SAE may be 
provided as a follow -up report. The Investigator may 
also 
modify the diagnosis, seriousness, 
and/or 
causality 
assessment 
based on this information. 
The investigator should not wait to receive additional information to fully document th 
e event 
before notifying the HSPB/WRAIR IRB of a related 
SAE
. In addition to fax, the complete report 
can be delivered to the address of the WRAIR HSPB 
at 
usarmy.detrick.medcom -
wrair.mbx.hspb@mail.mil . This initial notification should give sufficient infor mation to permit 
identification of: 
 
 
•
 
The reporter ; 
•
 
The subject identification number, 
age, gender;
 
•
 
Date of 
vaccination dose
, number ( first or second ) and group (previously vaccinated 
versus alphavirus 
na
ive); 
•
 
Diagnosis (MedDRA terminology) ; 
•
 
Description of adverse event (date of onset, signs/symptoms and severity) ; 
•
 
Assessment of relatedness to study vaccination;  
•
 
Action taken ; 
•
 
Outcome of the 
event
;
 
•
 
Concomitant medications (dose, route, duration) . 
 
As new information is obtained, updated reports should be submitted, and if available, should 
include copies of relevant hospital case records, autopsy reports, and other documents where 
applicable.  
The MM will
 
make the determination 
whether an SAE is a
 “suspected  unexpected serious  adverse 
reac
tion” (SUSAR) as defined in 21 CFR 312.32. 
•
 
Suspected adverse reaction  means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the AE.  
•
 
Unexpected adverse reaction  means an AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure 
or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.    
 
The Sponsor will report adverse events to FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32. 
 
Specifically, 
the Sponsor will report fatal or life -threatening 
SUSARs 
no later than 7 
calendar 
days after ini
tial 
receipt of the information and will report non 
-
life-threatening SUSARs  no later than 15 calendar 
days after determining that the information qualifies for expedited reporting. 
The MM will notify the Investigator of SUSARs and any other events that mee t criteria for  
expedited reporting to regulatory authorities. The 
Investigator
 will notify the applicable  IRB of 
these events and adhere to any other applicable local reporting requirements.

Other Events  
Requiring Immediate Reporting
 
6.7.1
 
Pregnancy  
The Investigator or designee must report all pregnancies to the 
MM 
 
or designee within 24 hours 
of their awareness of the pregnancy, using the Pregnancy Report Form. All pregnancies will be 
followed to outcome. Additional information regarding the pregnancy may be provided as a 
follow -up report.  
An uncomplicated pregnancy is not considered an AE.  Complications of pregnancy m ay qualify 
as AEs or SAEs and would therefore be documented and reported as specified above.    
The following should always be considered as an SAE:  
•
 
  Spontaneous pregnancy loss, including:  
− spontaneous abortion, (spontaneous pregnancy loss before/at 22 wee ks of gestation)  
− ectopic and molar pregnancy  
− stillbirth (intrauterine death of f etus after 22 weeks of gestation).  
•
 
Any early neonatal death (i.e. death of a live born infant occurring within the first 7 days of 
life).  
•
 
Any congenital anomaly or birth defec t (as per  
CDC MACDP 
guidelines) identified in the 
offspring of a study subject (either during pregnancy, at birth or later) regardless of whether 
the fetus is delivered dead or alive. This includes anomalies identified by prenatal 
ultrasound, amniocentesis  or examination of the products of conception after elective or 
spontaneous abortion.  
Furthermore, any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy AND considered by the 
investigator to be reasonably related to the investigational vaccine(s)/product (s) will be reported 
to the sponsor . While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information from 
former study participants, he/she may learn of a pregnancy through spontaneous reporting.  
The reports for pregnancies will be summarized in the continuing review reports that are submitted 
to the WRAIR IRB as well.  
 
6.7.2
 
Dosing Error s 
The Investigator or designee must report any error in the dosing of study vaccine to the 
MM 
 
or 
designee within 24 hours of their awareness of the error. Additional information regarding the 
dosing error may be provided as a follow -up report. A dosing error without signs or symptoms is 
not considered an AE but may be determined to be an important protocol deviation ( IPD). 

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 56 of 81  6.7.3 Early Discontinuation  for Safety Reasons  
The Inv estigator or designee must report any early discontinuation from study participation or 
further vaccination 
for safety reasons
 (as determined by the Principal Investigator)  to the 
MM 
 
or 
designee within 24 hours of discontinuation. Additional information regarding ongoing adverse 
events may be provided as a follow -up report.   
 
6.8
 
Study Stopping Rules  
Enrollment and dosing will be stopped for 
a
ny SAE  assessed by the Investigator as possibly or 
probabl y related to study vaccine.  
Enrollment may be resumed following review of available safety data by the Sponsor. 
For further information regarding stopping rule reporting procedures, please refer to the Safety 
Management Plan (SMP).  

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 57 of 81  7 STUDY MONITORING PROCEDURES  
The Sponsor has ethical, legal, and scientific obligations to conduct this study in accordance with 
established research principles and ICH GCP guidelines. As such, in order to fulfill these 
obligations, study monitors (CRAs), a DoD Research Monitor, a nd a 
Medical Monitor, will be 
employed for the duration of the study.   
 
7.1
 
Study Monitors  
Clini 
cal Research Associates (CRAs) 
will monitor study progress by scheduling and performing 
on-site study visits throughout the study.  A CRA will conduct 
site initiation visit 
s
, several 
interim monitoring visits and a site close out visit. They 
will communicate with the site
s 
via 
phone, email and formal visit confirmation and follow -up letters. 
The
 CRA will be responsible 
for 100% source document verification of study data , to include reviewing all UPIRTSOs 
associated with the protocol. The CRA may escalate any critical subject safety or GCP finding to 
the Investigator, Sponsor and Medical Monitor and direct the site to contact the IRB and the 
DoD Research Monitor 
immediate
ly if required. Regular inspection of the eCRFs will be 
conducted by the CRA in order to assess subject enrollment, compliance with protocol 
procedures, completeness and accuracy of data entered on the eCRFs, verification of eCRF data 
against original sour ce documents, and occurrence of AEs. A full description of the 
responsibilities of the CRA, which will include reviewing the Investigational Site File on a 
routine basis, will be documented in the Monitoring Plan.  
The
 
CRA will also verify appropriate 
accountability and storage of the IVP and ensure site pharmacy staff understand and conduct 
Study Vaccine preparation procedures according to 
the 
protocol.   
 
7.2
 
DoD Research Monitor  
The DoD Research Monitor is a physician independent of the Sponsor who is responsible for 
serving as advocate for the medical safety of volunteers in accordance with Department of 
Defense Instruction (DoDI) 3216.02. As such, 
he/she may:
 
•
 
Perform oversight functions and report their observations to the IRB or other designated 
officials on recruitment/enrollment procedures, the consent process, other study 
interventions and interactions, data matching, data collection, and analysis. 
•
 
Review ‘unanticipated problem involving risk to subjects or others’ (UPIRTSO) reports.  
 
The DoD Resea 
rch Monitor is authorized to:
 
•
 
Interview and examine subjects and their clinical data.  
•
 
Remove individual subjects from the study. 
•
 
Stop the research protocol in progress. 

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 58 of 81 • Promptly report their observations and findings to the IRB or other designated official  as 
required.  
• Take any other steps necessary to protect the safety and well -being of human subjects 
until the IRB can assess their report.  
 
The DoD Research Monitor must review all unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects 
or others (UPIRTSOs), se rious adverse event (SAE) reports, and all subject deaths.   The 
Research Monitor will provide an unbiased written report of these events promptly (within 48 
hours) to the WRAIR IRB by phone , or by email (
), or by facsimile . The DoD Research Monitor or their 
approved alternate will then submit written reports within 10 working days to the WRAIR IRB at 
the following address:  
  All DoD Research Monitor 
reports for unrelated SAEs and deaths should be kept with the corresponding SAE reports at the 
study site. 
 
The DoD Research Monitor or their approved alternate at a minimum must comment on the 
outcomes of the event or problem and in case of a serious adverse event or death, comments on 
the relationship to participation in the study.  They must also indicate whether he/she concurs 
with the details of the report provi ded by the principal investigator. 
 
The DoD Research Monitor or their approved alternate should review all initial, follow up, and 
final reports for SAEs, unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others, and all 
subject deaths in a timely mann er, and provide their own independent report to the study team. 
 
7.3 Medical Monitor  
The Medical Monitor (MM) will provide safety oversight for the study. The MM will review de -
identified (coded) adverse event reports and assess causality of SAEs on behalf of the Sponsor.  In 
addition, the MM will communicate safety signals detected in other studies of this vaccine that 
bear on the conduct of this study or the safety and consent of its participants.

8.1 Source Documentation  
The Investigator must maintain source documentation of all study conduct  data and obs ervations 
relevant to the study. This  source documentation includes, but is not limited to, ICFs, original 
medical records, progress notes from the Investigator and study staff, laboratory reports, memory 
aids for solicited adverse events, and documentation of study vaccine accountability.  
The paper source documents will be stored in locked cabinets in the respective clinical sites when 
not actively in use.  Only the study coordinators, clinical trial manager, and clinic senior enlisted 
officer will have access to the keys to the storage containers for paper documents at the clinical 
sites CTC.  Both clinical sites are loc ated on m ilitary installations with restricted access . 
 
8.2 Case Report Forms  
This study will employ eCRFs provided by the Sponsor.  Certain  clinical information requested in 
this p rotocol will be recorded on these e CRFs . The Investigator is responsible for the adequacy 
and accuracy of all data entered on the eC RFs. The Investigator is also responsible for signing all 
eCRFs, after which they will be locked by the Sponsor to prevent further data entry or 
modification.   When the Final Clinical Study Report is completed, the data manager/designee will 
initiate the p rocess for archiving the study data. 
For further information on eCRFs, please refer to the CRF Completion Guidelines. Details on data 
handling will be described in the Sponsor’s Data Management Plan (DMP).

9.1
 
Sample Size Calculation  
The sample size 
here was chosen based on the number of subjects in the 
Fort Detrick Special 
Immunization/Special Procedures Program  (USAMRIID) who are available for screening .  Of the 
approximately 60 
 
available , 30 
are expected
 to enroll in this trial 
 
along with 
an equal 
number of 
alphavirus naïve age - and gender -matched subjects. Based on an interim analysis of this vaccine 
lot and regimen in Study PXVX0317 
-
001, at least 95% of the alphavirus -naïve controls are 
expected to seroconvert 
in this trial 
. Assuming that the alph
avirus -naïve group 
has
 a 95% 
seroconversion rate, a total sample size of 60 
subjects 
affords  8
0% 
power to de tect a 
 
significant  
difference between groups if the seroconversion rate in the prior alphavirus vaccine recipients is 
65% or 
less
. Or, in other word s, power is 80% to detect a difference  between groups  if the 
seroconversion rate in the prior alphavirus recipients is 
30 
percentage points lower than in the 
alphavirus -naïve group.   Compared to the previously cited studies in which decrements in the 
propo 
rtion of seroconversion of 64%
 (
McClain  1998 
)
 and 100%  (
Harrison 1971 
)
 (
DeMeio 1979
) 
were seen, this study is adequately powered 
 
to detect  immune  interference on the order of one -half 
to one -third of what has previously been described. 
In the event that we have overestimated the willingness of this pool of eligible subjects to 
participate, the ability to detect differences in the proportion of seroconversion of the same order 
as was previously shown by McClain (36% versus  95% seroconversion), 10 subjects per group 
would afford 71% power to detect a 
significant 
difference. The power of other combinations of 
seroconversion rate and sample size can be 
seen in 
Table 3 . For example, 10 subjects per group 
afford 81% power to detect a difference between groups if the seroconversion rate is a low as 30% 
in the prior alphavirus vaccine recipients, while 20 subjects per group provide 89% power to detect 
a diff erence if the seroconversion rate is 50% or lower among prior alphavirus recipients.  
This is 
certainly less than ideal in terms of designing a field study in an area endemic for other 
alphaviruses.  The decision to conduct such a study will be dependent on many factors and the 
residual possibility that a lesser degree of immune interference may have gone undetected will 
have to be considered.  If, one the other hand, immune interference on the order of that reported 
by DeMeio is seen in which a neutralizin g antibody response is entirely abrogated, data from this 
study would be sufficiently compelling to avoid recruiting for field studies in areas co 
-
endemic for 
other alphaviruses.

Power of each combination estimated from a Fisher’s exact test comparing the seroconversion rate observed 
among prior alphavirus vaccine recipients to the rate observed among alphavirus -naïve vaccine recipients 
assuming the true rate in the latter group is 95%.  
With respect to safety as a study endpoint, this study will have 80% power to detect a 30 % 
difference between pre 
-
exposure  groups  in the incidence of any single or aggregate solicited 
adverse event  expected to  occur in 5% of the subjects 
in one of the groups
. With a total of 60 
subjects receiving 
PXVX0317 
, there is a 95% chance that an uncommon AE 
– 
one expected to 
occur in 5% of vaccinees 
– 
will be observed at least once in the trial.

Treatment Period  
The treatment 
and observation period begins at the time of 
vaccine administration 
and extends 
through the Day 
29 
visit. The 
f
ollow -up period spans the time following the Day 
29 
visit through 
the end -of-study visit on 
Day 
182 (±14)
.  
9.3
 
Treatment Groups  
Subjects will 
a
ll receive the same vaccine 
 
regimen in an open label fashion 
. 
  There will be no 
randomization and no blinding as the primary endpoint ( immune response 
at Day 
22 
) is not subject 
to subjective interpretation .  The participants themselves alrea 
dy know whether or not they have 
previously received another alphavirus vaccine as such vaccines have only been available through 
IND and their administration required informed consent .   
The safety profile of this vaccine is
 well-
established for a phase 2  candidate and is  not expected to differ between the two groups enough to 
justify the inclusion of a placebo group.  Laboratory workers at USAMRIID have been exposed to 
multiple alphavirus and other vaccines in the past without evidence of any clinically s ignificant 
adverse health effects (
Pittman 2004 
).  
 
Subject matching will be done by age ( ±3 years ) and gender, both of which have been shown to 
play roles in vaccine immunogenicity in general  (
Klein 2016 
)
 and alphavirus imm une interference 
in particular (
Reisler 2012 
)
, (
Pittman 2009 
)

With the exception of redness and swelling, all solicited AEs 
will 
be summarized according to 
severity grading scales defined in 
Section 
6.2 
 
from “mild” to
 
“potentially life
-threatening .” 
Solicited AEs 
will 
be recorded daily until 7 days  post-injection using a structured memory aid. 
The analyses of solicited AEs (any event, after any injection, and after each 
injec
ti
on
) will be 
performed by 
maxim 
um
 severity 
and by treatment group. In addition, 
solicited 
AEs ongoing after 
7 days  post -injection  
will 
also be recorded 
as unsolicited AEs.  
Summary tables 
tallying
 the incidence, timing, duration and severity 
 
of any local or systemic 
solicited AE will be 
presented.
 The pre-exposure groups will be compared on the incidence of each 
type of solicited AE using pairwise Fisher’s exact tests. 
The percentage 
 
of subjects experiencing 
each solicited AE will 
also 
be presented by maximum severity.  
The severity of 
re
dness and swelling 
recorded as diameters (mm) 
will be
 summarized according 
to categories based on 
the largest diameter 
linear measurement when the local reaction is present: 
 
•
 
Grade 0/absent = 
0 to 
24 mm. 
 
•

9.5.2
 
Unsolicited AEs  
All the unsolicited AEs occurring during the study, will be recorded 
, regardless of th

CRFs  will be mapped to 
preferred terms using the MedDRA dictionary. The unsolicited AEs will then be grouped by 
MedDRA preferred te rms into frequency tables according to system organ class (SOC). All 
reported AEs, as well as AEs judged by the 
I
nvestigator as at least possibly related to study 
vaccine, will be summarized by 
pre

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 69 of 81  9.6 Immunogenicity Analysis  
All tests will be carried out at a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05 and no adjustment for  multiplicity 
will be applied .
 
Seroconversion A nalysis:  
The primary immunogenicity analysis will compare prior alphavirus vaccine recipients to 
alphavirus -naïve controls on the proportion in each group who seroconvert by anti -CHIKV 
neutralizing antibody at  Day 22
. Seroconversion is defi
ned as a 4 -fold or greater rise over baseline 
in anti -CHIKV neutralizing antibodies as assessed by a luciferase 
-
based assay.  
Specifically, we will 
test
 the hypothes es: 
H0: P1 = P 2   vs.  H1: P1 ≠ P2   
where 
 P1 and P 2 denote the proportion of subjects who s eroconvert in the prior alphavirus vaccine 
recipients and the alphavirus -naïve controls, respectively. 
The significance of the comparison of the pre -exposure groups will be assess ed using a Fisher’s 
exact test. The percentage who seroconvert in each group will be presented along with it
s
 
95% CI 
calculated using the Wilson method. A sensitivity analysis of the comparison will be performed 
using a logistic regression model that incorporates age , gender , and baseline titer  as potential 
predictive factors.  Fisher’s test comparing seroconversion rates at other time points may also be 
performed.   Similar analyses of the proportion who seroconver t will be conducted on Days 8, 
29, 
57 and 182 for 
anti
-CHIKV neutralizing antibody and on Day 
s
 22 and 29 
 
for total 
anti
-CHIKV, 
total anti 
-
VEEV  and neutralizing anti -VEEV antibod 
ies
 (secondary endpoints). 
Threshold analyses : 
The percentage of subjects achieving specified thresholds (e.g., 
≥ 
40
, 
160, and 640 anti-CHIKV 
antibo 
dy titers
), and associated Wilson  95% CI s, will also be calculated 
for 
 
Days 1,
 
8, 22, 29, 57 
and 182 for neutralizing antibody 
and 
at Days 1 , 22 and 29 for total anti 
-
CHIKV , total anti 
-
VEEV  
and neutralizing anti -VEEV antibod 
ies 
(secondary end 
-
points) . The groups will be compared 
by 
pairwise Fisher’s exact tests 
on the 
percentage 
achieving each threshold.  
GMT  analyses : 
For the secondary comparisons based on GMT, the hypotheses tested will be  
H0: µ1 = µ2     vs.  H1: µ1 ≠ µ2   
where 
 
µ1 and µ2 denote the GMT  for the prior alphavirus vaccine recipients and the alphavirus -
naïve controls, respectively. 
The GMT s on Days 22 and 29 
will be 
compared for differences between the pre 
-
exposure groups . 
The GMTs and Geometric Mean Ratio s (GMR s) will be analyzed via lin ear model. The primary 
model is an analysis of 
co
variance (AN COVA), with 
logarithmically
-transformed titers (log 10) as 

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 70 of 81  the dependent variable and pre -exposure group , age , gender , as fixed effect s and baseline log -
transformed titer  as the covariate 
in the model. The least square means 
estimated from the 
AN
C
OVA 
 
and their 95% C Is will be back -transformed and reported as the group GMT values.  
The GMR comparing the pre -exposure groups will be calculated by back 
-
transforming the 
differenc e estimated 
from a linear contrast in
 the model. The 95% CI for the GMR will be 
calculated analogously.  
The 
GMT
s and GMRs based on antibody 
titers 
measured at 
all other protocol -specified time 
points will be analyzed as described above for Day 22. 
The
 
diff
erence in persistence of the 
antibody response induced after  
first vaccination at each time p
oint will be visually  
assessed.
 
Summaries of both seroconversion and GMT  
will be 
presented 
by age and gender.
 
Exploratory endpoints (both categorical and continuous) for the heterologous alphavirus  analys es 
will be analyzed descriptively.

10.1
 
Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The study will be performed in accordance with the protocol and consistent with ICH  Good 
Clinica l Practice (GCP) Guidelines and 
applicable 
 
DoD and  local regulatory requirements and 
laws.  
10.2
 
IRB Oversight  
The study (protocol, informed consent form, recruiting materials, 
and 
any documents seen by the 
subject) will be 
reviewed and approved by 
the WRAIR 
IRB
. Subjects will not be 
recruited, 
consented, screened, or enrolled  until the IRB has approved the required documentation. In 
addition, the IRB will review amendments to  
the pr
otocol 
before their implementation
.     
The Investigator will retain all correspondence with the IRB in the trial master file (TMF)  and 
forward c opies of all IRB approvals to the Sponsor.  
 
10.3
 
Informed Consent  
The Sponsor or designee will provide a master 
inf
ormed consent form ( ICF) 
template to each 
site 
for development of a 
site
-specific ICF.  
All site -specific ICFs must be 
approved 
by the Sponsor or designee and the IRB and must be in 
compliance with ICH GCP, DoD and local regulatory  and legal requirements. 
The 
Sponsor  or 
designee will advise the Site 
of required changes
 to the 
master 
ICF template during the course of 
the study.   
The Investigator will
 
ensure that each 
potential 
study participan t is fully informed about the nature 
and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with participation.  
Before inf
ormed 
consent is obtained, the I nvestigator, or a 
qualified 
person designated by the 
I
nvestigator, will
 
provide the 
potential 
study participan t with ample time and opportunity to inquire about the details 
of the trial, 
and will answer all relevant 
questions to the 
potential 
study participan t’s satisfaction .   
The potential 
study 
participan t will then  decide whether or not to particip ate in the trial. 
The 
Investigator, or a 
qualified 
person designated by the Investigator, will obtain written informed 
consent from each 
study participant
 before any study- specific activity is performed.   
The Investigator will retain the  original and any amended signed and dated Informed Consent 
Form(s) at the study site  and provide a copy 
to
 each study participant.  
All informed consent forms also address the subject of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination 
Act of 2008 (Pub. L. 110 -233), also known as GINA.  Participants will be advised that GINA is a 
federal law that prohibits discrimination in health insurance coverage and employment based on 
genetic information. However, GINA does not apply to employers with fewer than 15 employees. 

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 72 of 81  GINA's protections in employment do not extend to the US military. Nor does it apply to health 
insurance through the TRICARE military health system, the Indian Health Service, the Veterans 
Health Administration, or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Lastly, the  law does 
not cover long term care insurance, life insurance or disability insurance.  
The language in the study ICFs state as follows: “Though not currently planned, some future 
research studies may include genetic testing of research samples.  This means 
that some of your 
DNA may be sequenced in order to, for example, learn how our DNA influences how we respond 
to vaccines.  Using new technology, information about your DNA structure (genetic information) 
gained from your samples could be used to indicate your risk for developing certain diseases.  This 
genetic information is unique to you and may indicate changes in your future health status or life 
expectancy, or that of your children and other relatives.  There is growing concern that such 
information could be used by employers or insurance companies to discriminate against you.  
However, if we do this sort of testing, we will not share the results with you or knowingly make 
your samples available to your future employers or insurance companies.”  
10.4
 
Subject C onfidentiality  
The Investigator will
 
ensure that each subject’s anonymity 
is maintained
. On eCRFs and  other 
documents submitted to the Sponsor and/or its designee , subjects must be identified by subje ct 
number only. 
 
For d ocuments that are not  for submissio n to the Sponsor and/or its designee 
(e.g., 
signed ICFs) , the Investigator must maintain these documents securely and 
in compliance with 
all 
federal laws and regulations , and ICH GCP Guideline s.  
The Investigator  will be responsible for retaining sufficient information about each subject, i .e.
, 
name, address, telephone number, Social Security number, and subject identifier i n the study, so 
that the S ponsor’s representative, the WRAIR IRB, the FDA, employees of 
USAMRDC
, or other 
regulatory authorities may have access to this information should the need arise.  
It is the policy of the 
USAMRDC
 that data sheets are to be completed for all subjects participating 
in research (Form 60 -R, Volunteer Registry Data Sheet). Th 
e data sheets will be entered into this 
Command’s Volunteer Registry Database. The information to be entered into this confidential data 
base includes the subject’s name, address, and Social Security Number; study title; and dates of 
participation. The int ent of this data base is twofold: first, to readily answer questions concerning 
an individual’s participation in research sponsored by 
USAMRDC
; and second, to ensure that 
USAMRDC  can exercise its obligation to ensure research subjects are adequately warned  (duty to 
warn) of risks and to provide new information as it becomes available. The information will be 
stored at 
USAMRDC
 for a minimum of 75 years. The Volunteer Registry Database is a separate 
entity and is not linked to the study database.  
 

 EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 73 of 81  10.5 Compensatio n for Injury  
All nonexempt research involving human subjects shall, at a minimum, meet the requirement of 
32 CFR 219.116(a)(6).   Namely, the Informed Consent document will not “ include any 
exculpatory language through which the subject or the legally autho 
rized representative is made 
to waive or appear to waive any of the subject ’s legal rights, or releases or appears to release the 
investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agents from liability for negligence.”  
If a subject is injured because of participation in this research, whether or not they are a DoD 
healthcare beneficiary, the subject is entitled to medical care for that injury at a military hospital 
or clinic; medical care charges for care at a military hospital or clinic will b e waived. It cannot be 
determined in advance which military hospital or clinic will provide care. If the subject obtains 
care for research -related injuries outside of a military hospital or clinic, the subject or the subject’s 
insurance will be responsible  for medical expenses.  Transportation to and from DoD hospitals or 
clinics will not be provided, except in emergencies or situations where a non 
-
DoD healthcare 
beneficiary requires a military escort for access to said hospitals or clinics. No reimbursement 
 
is 
available if the subject incurs medical expenses to treat research -related injuries. No compensation 
is available for research -related injuries. The subject is not waiving any legal rights. The subject 
should contact the PI if the subject believes he o 
r she has sustained a research
-related injury. The 
subject should contact the PI for any questions.

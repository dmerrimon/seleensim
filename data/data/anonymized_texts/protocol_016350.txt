Brief Summary of Research (250 -400 words):  
Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA) is an effective modality for the treatment of advanced 
osteoarthritis of the knee joint with excellen t outcomes. With 719,000 cases being 
performed as of 2010, the incidence is expected to increase up to 3.48 millio n 
procedures annually by 2030.  Multimodal analgesia is the cornerstone  intervention  
in TKA that is utilized to minimize post operative pain an d improve functional 
outcomes in pa tients. Pain management in peri operative period enhances recovery 
and rehabil itation that improves length of stay and facilitates faster discharge with 
improvements in  patient satisfaction score s.  Numerous strategies  devised as a part 
of multimodal analgesia after TKA are epidural anesthesia, femoral nerve block, 
adductor canal block, intra articular epidural catheter ( Caledonian protocol), intra 
articular cocktail, intra venous patient control analgesia along with IV ana lgesics 
and combinations.  The goal to minimize narcotics has been based on several studies 
demonstrating opioid related adverse events , increased leng th of stay as well as 
hospitalization costs.  
 
Local infiltrative analgesia administered by the surgeon aro und the joint capsule has 
been an emerging adjunct to multimodal analgesia advocated by surgeons claiming 
improved  rehabilitation by reducing venous stasis  and maximizing motor strength. 
Periarticular analgesia ( PAI) primarily targets the mechanoreceptors and the free 
nerve endings in the intra articular area.

Revised 9/2/14 IPACK block is a novel technique gaining popularity where one injects local 
anesthesia safely under ultrasound guidance in the interspace between the popliteal 
artery and capsule of the knee. It pri marily targets genicular nerves innervating the 
knee joint. It does not affect  the sciatic nerve  hence motor blockade  is avoided 
promising enhanced recovery .  
 
There have been no studies till date comparing the efficacy between IPACK  block 
and PAI. 
 
The purpose of our study is to evaluate the difference in quality of analgesia 
between efficacy of IPACK  block and PAI performed by surgeon as measured by 
patient’s opioid consumption and pain scores.  
 
 
1)Objectives  
Research Question : Does IPACK  block provide s uperior analgesia  in comparison 
with surgeon performed periarticular infiltrate (PAI) in TKA patients?  
 Primary outcome: The amount of opioid consumption (in mg IV morphine 
equivalents) postoperatively during the first 24  hours after the procedu re. VAS pain 
scores on arrival and departure from PACU.  
Secondary outcome:  
The degree of postoperative pain in terms of VAS scores from arrival to the floors to 
the first 24 hours after surgery.  
Time to first dose of narcotic admi nistration, PACU length of stay , location of pain,              
ambulation distance with assistance on POD 1 as assessed by PT and activities of 
daily living(ADL’s) on POD 1 as assessed by OT.  
 
2)Background  
See above.  There have been several stu dies regarding efficacy of peri -articular 
infiltration. IPACK block is a novel technique gaining popularity where one injects

 5) Study Design 
Prospective triple blinded randomized control trial . Recruitment will be done 
through a coordination of the operating schedule and the surgeon’s office.  Patients 
presenting for preoperative visits at the preoper ative joint clinic will be approached. 
Patients routinely are seen by anesthesiologists at the pre operative testing clinic as 
part of pre operative anesthetic evaluation. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria 
will be approached by research personnel an d details of the study will be explained. 
The consent will be obtained in the pre operative testing clinic after all questions are 
thoroughly answered. The team will finalize participation and ask the subject to sign 
study consent forms.  All patients will  be provided with copies of the IRB protocol 
and consent if they wish to have it. Copy of the consent form will be sent in a 
secured email to the potential subject. The email will be secured by entering in 
[SECURE] in the e -mail subject line.  Once recruit ed blinding assessments will be 
done by the study team.  
Patients will be assigned randomly using a computer - generated  table of numbers to 
either IPACK block (IPACK group) or Periarticular infiltration  (PAI group). Block 
team will perform all blocks. Resident anesthesiologist will know the group 
allocation but will not be involv ed in the study. Patients assigned to I PACK block 
group will receive 2 0cc 0.25% bupivacaine under USG guidance on the side of

Revised 9/2/14 surgery. At the conclusion of the surgery prior to skin  closure, all  patients in the PAI 
group will  receive 100cc of joint cocktail  infiltrated by the surgeon.  Patients in both 
groups will receive a post operative adductor canal catheter in the PACU,  with 
Bupivacaine 0.1% 8 -12 cc/hr with demand dose of 3 -5 cc q20 min.  Otherwise, the 
patient, surgeon, and anesthesiologist in the case will be blinded .   
 
a) Recruitment  methods:  Patients will be recruited and consented in pre operative 
testing/Joint clinic. 
b) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
   Inclusion criteri a: ASA (American Society of Anesthesiology) class I -IV, age 18-     
75. 
Exclusion criteria: ASA class V, morbid obesity, patient refusal, patients  with 
chronic pain or on pain medications , allergy to LA, patients receiving any additional 
regional technique s, coagulopathy , patients receiving  systemic anticoagulation, local 
infection, and procedures  anticipated  to last more than 5 hours.   
     c)Number of Subjects  
We intend to recruit 2 00 patients.  
Based on a confidence level of 99% with a Z score of 2.58 , standard deviation of .5 
and a confidence interval of 10% our sample size should be 166 . For ease of 
statistical calculations we rounded up to 2 00 patients. Based on previous literature 
pertaining to local articular infiltration in total knee arthroplasty an d postoperative 
femoral nerve block , we found s tudies included anywhere from 40 to 100 patients. 
We intend to use a higher sample size to see any statistical significance.

c = confidence interval, expressed as decimal   (e.g., .01= ±1)  
 
Sample size= [(2.58^2)(.5)(.5)]/(.1^2)=16 6 subjects  
For effect size, we expect a Cos d medium effect of 0.5. The estimate for sample 
sizes was obtained by using the first set of pain scores obtained in the PACU.  A 
previous study of 45  patients undergoing knee arthroplasty treated with a femoral 
nerve block reported a mean visual analog scale score of 3.6 (SD 1.1) upon 
movement, at 24 h (Singelyn et al. 1998). In an earlier study on total knee 
arthroplasties (Axelsson et al. 2005), the mean morphine consumption over 48 hours 
postoperatively was 64.6 (SD 36.3) mg in the placebo group.  
 
The aim of this study  was to investigate whether the IPACK technique could r educe 
the morphine consumption.  The Mann -Whitney U test will be used for the analysis 
of the primary endpoint (morphine consumption). Mann -Whitney U test will be used 
to assess pain scores and the Bon ferroni-Holm method was used to correct for 
multiple measures. Hospital stay, time to fulfill discharge criteria, knee function 
scores, and pati ent satisfaction scores will be  analyzed using the Mann -Whitney U 
test. Dichotomous data will be analyzed using the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact 
test, as appropriate. Values of p < 0.05 were considered to be statistically 
significant.  
 
 
d)Study Timelines  
     2017-2018 and subsequent data analysis. The subject’s participation will be from 
time of enrollment in  the pre-operative period until first  24 hours after surgery . 
Estimated date of enrollment completion will be wh en 200 eligible subjects are 
enrolled in final data analysis .  Estimate date for study completion will be June 
2018.

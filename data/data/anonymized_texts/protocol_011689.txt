Amendment 3 ( 03 Oct 2022)  
Overall Rationale for the Amendment  
The primary reason for this protocol amendment is to provide an update on the safety 
information in line with the updated Investigator ’s Brochure (IB) dated Sep 2022 and updates on 
the adverse event s of special monitoring (AESM). The criteria for study medication 
discontinuation due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) and the requirements for male 
contraception were also updated.  
This amendment is considered to be substantial base d on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of 
Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.  
Section # and Name  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  
Global  Minor editorial and formatting 
changes have been made.  To provide clarity and remain 
consistent with remainder of 
protocol.  
1.3 Schedule of activities,  
Table 1 -2, 
Table 1 -3 New footnotes “k” (Table 1 -2) 
and “h” (Table 1 -3): Added to 
clarify that a full neurological 
examination should be performed 
in the event  of severe and/or 
serious headache or suspected 
aseptic meningitis. Subsequent 
footnotes have been reordered.  The accumulated safety data on 
rozanolixizumab led to an 
update of the adverse events 
requiring special monitoring.  
As of the cut -off date of  the IB 
(13 Jul 2022), the following 
serious adverse events (SAEs) 
Headache and Meningitis

and text (Section 8.9): Updated to 
remove the former AESM of  
severe  GI disorders, to add the 
new AESM of suspected aseptic 
meningitis, and to further detail 
the sampling time.  Aseptic (PT terms) suggest a 
possible causal relationship to 
rozanolixizumab; based on both 
their temporal association with 
investigational medicinal 
product (IMP) i nfusion 
(primarily initial infusion) and 
given the events have occurred 
more than once in the 
rozanolixizumab clinical 
development program.  1.3.1 Additional study 
assessments  New section added to detail 
additional study assessments in 
case of AESM of severe and/or 
serious headache or the new

adverse drug reactions, safety 
concerns, a nd other safety topics 
of interest .

1.1 Synopsis  
Protocol title:  
An open -label extension study to evaluate rozanolixizumab in study participants with 
generalized myasthenia gravis.  
Short Title:  
A Phase 3 open -label extension study to evaluate 6-week treatment cycles of rozanolixizumab in 
study participants with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG).  
Rationale:  
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a serious, sometimes life threatening, debilitating condition 
associated with numerous symptoms including muscul ar weakness and fatigue. The major 
pathophysiology leading to MG is the abnormal production of immunoglobulin (Ig)G 
autoantibodies directed toward nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), or muscle -specific 
kinase (MuSK) protein. Several commonly prescribe d treatments act, at least in part, by reducing 
the quantity of such circulating IgG autoantibodies. While the standard of care for MG involves 
the utilization of a variety of therapeutic agents including cholinesterase inhibitors, 
immunomodulators, cortic osteroid, biologics, high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), 
plasmapheresis or immunoadsorption, there remains a need for a safe and effective treatment 
devoid of significant side effects to conveniently treat patients with MG.  
By blocking the activit y of neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), rozanolixizumab accelerates the 
catabolism of antibodies and reduces the serum IgG concentration, including pathogenic IgG in 
MG patients, thus offering a potentially , effective, and convenient alternative to existing  
treatments. This Phase 3 study will provide the required data to establish the safety and efficacy 
of rozanolixizumab in anti -AChR or anti -MuSK autoantibody -positive patients with generalized 
MG who experience moderate to severe symptoms and are being con sidered for additional 
treatment such as IVIg or plasma exchange (PEX).  
MG0007 is a Phase 3, 2 -arm, randomized, open -label extension (OLE) study to evaluate the 
long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of repeated 6 -week treatment cycles of 
rozanolixiz umab based on MG worsening in study participants with gMG. This OLE study will 
provide the opportunity for study participants who participated in MG0003 and MG0004 to 
benefit from long -term rozanolixizumab treatment based on their MG symptom needs.

Overall Design  
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, 2 -arm, OLE study to evaluate 6 -week treatment cycles of 
rozanolixizumab in study participants with gMG. MG0007 is an extension study of MG0003.  
Eligible study participants from the lead -in study, MG0003, will  be randomized to receive an 
initial fixed 6 -week treatment cycle of a subcutaneous (sc) dose of rozanolixizumab equivalent to 
approximately 7mg/kg or 10mg/kg weekly (QW) ( Table  1-1 and Figure  1-2), followed by an 
Observation Period that begins after the last dose of the current treatment cycle as per 
assessments described in the Schedule of Activities (Section  1.3).  
Eligible study participants from MG0004 who have completed at least 6 scheduled visits in the 
Treatment Period and the premature end of treatment  (PEOT) visit can move directly into the 
Observation Period in MG0007 of the initial fixed cycle. Additionally,  eligible study participants 
from MG0004 who are in the Observation Period and have completed the EOS visit can move 
directly into the Observation Period in MG0007 of the initial fixed cycle ( Figure  1-1 and 
Figure  1-2). If IMP treatment was withheld for low IgG in MG0004, study participant's missed 
dose(s ) can be counted as part of the total 6 visits for completion of MG0004 and meet eligibility

with rozanolixizumab upon worsening of gMG symptoms. For the first MG00 07 treatment with 
rozanolixizumab, participants will continue on their last treatment dose from MG0004. Dose 
adjustments may be applied in future cycles as per description below.  
The rollover into MG0007 must be completed within 4 weeks after the End of S tudy (EOS) visit 
from MG0003, or the PEOT or EOS (as appropriate) visit from MG0004. In the event a study 
participant has a gap period (>4 weeks) between the EOS or PEOT visit from the lead -in study 
and the start of MG0007, a Screening Period (see Appendix  11 [Section  10.11 ]) of up to 4  weeks 
will be applicable to confirm that the study participant still meets the eligibility criteria for entry 
into MG00 07 (see Appendix 12 [ Section  10.12 ]).

MG=myasthenia gravis  
In case of symptom worsening (eg, an increas e of 2.0 points on the MG -ADL or 3.0 points on 
the QMG scale) between assessments, resulting in a need for additional treatment, study 
participants will undergo another 6 -week treatment cycle followed by an Observation Period, 
based on the Investigator's d iscretion. The dose may be adjusted to 7mg/kg or 10mg/kg at the 
beginning of each treatment cycle based on the Investigator's discretion.  The minimal time to 
start the next treatment cycle is 4 weeks following the last dose of the Treatment Period of the 
previous cycle. If a study participant requires treatment earlier than 4 weeks, IgG levels from the 
previous cycle should be considered and discussed with the Medical Monitor . A new treatment 
cycle should not  be initiated until total IgG level is ≥2g/L.  
Participants in MG0007 will remain on their gMG background medications. With the exception 
of steroids and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, all gMG medication doses should be 
maintained during each respective 6 -week treatment cycle and efforts should b e made to 
maintain a stable dose during the first 8 weeks of the Observation Period.  
Study participants who receive rescue therapy (intravenous immunoglobulin [IVIg], plasma 
exchange [PEX], subcutaneous immunoglobulin [SCIg], or iv corticosteroid) during t he 
Treatment Period are not eligible to receive any further treatment with rozanolixizumab. Study 
participants must complete the first 8 weeks of the Observation Period after the last dose of 
rozanolixizumab prior to completing the EOS visit assessments , and subsequently will be 
withdrawn from the study (Section  4.4).  
Those patients who received rescue therapy (IVIg, PEX, SCIg, or iv corticosteroid) during the 
observation or no treatment with rozanolixizumab  periods may continue in the study at the 
Investigator’s discretion and after discussion with Medical Monitor and/ or UCB Study

weeks following the last dose of IVIg, SCIg, or iv corticosteroids or the last PEX session, unless 
there is a medical reason, and an earlier treatment  initiation is being considered  for the study 
participant as agreed upon with the Medical Monitor and/or UCB Study physician.  
Study participants (not withdrawn from the study) will continue in MG0007 until product 
approval or until transition to a man aged access program (MAP), if available, as indicated per 
the Sponsor, and according to local guidance. For country -specific requirements, see Appendix 
8, Section  10.8.  
Number of Participants  
No formal sample size calculation can be performed . All eligible study participants from 
MG0003 and MG0004 will be invited to participate in MG0007. It will be assumed that 
approximately 200 study participants wil l be enrolled into MG0007 .  
Treatment Groups and Duration  
Fixed unit doses across body weight tiers and study arms will be employed in MG0007. This 
OLE study will continue treatment with rozanolixizumab sc fixed doses equivalent to 
approximately 7mg/kg and  10mg/kg administered QW for 6 -week treatment cycles.

If a dose arm is determined to be futile and is discontinued after the interim analysis in MG0003, 
then that dose arm will be dropped from MG0007, and study participants in the affected dose 
arm will be transferred to the continuing dose arm. An independent Data Monitoring Committee 
(IDMC) will monitor the ongoing safety and efficacy of the study. Further details of the IDMC 
will be provided in an IDMC charter.

2 INTRODUCTION  
Rozanolixizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that is being developed as an 
inhibitor of the activity of the FcRn for IgG.  
By blocking the activity of FcRn, rozanolixizumab accelerates the catabolism of IgG antibodies, 
including IgG pathogenic autoantibodies. The aim is to reduce the concentration of pathogen ic 
IgG in patients with autoimmune diseases mediated by the action of IgG autoantibodies.  
The FcRn recycles IgG and albumin and transports it bidirectionally across epithelial barriers. 
Recent studies have shown that FcRn rescues both IgG and albumin from intracellular lysosomal 
degradation by recycling it from the sorting endosome to the cell surface ( Roopenian and 
Akilesh, 2007 ). FcRn may also mediate transcytosis of IgG to facilitate its distribution within 
tissues. Rozanolixizumab has been specifically designed to block IgG binding to FcRn without 
blocking the binding and recycling of albumin.  
Rozanolixizumab binds with high affinity to FcRn at both neutral and acidic pH. 
Immunoglobulin G that is constitutively taken up by pinocytosis into cells fails to  bind to FcRn, 
even at the acidic pH found in the endosome. It is therefore not recycled and is trafficked to the 
lysosomes for degradation.  
Production of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies is the major pathophysiology leading to a number 
of autoimmune diseases , which include MG, pemphigus vulgaris,  
, Goodpasture’s syndrome, neuromyelitis optica, Guillain -Barré Syndrome, and chronic 
inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy.  
As individual disease entities, IgG autoantibody -mediated conditions are relatively rare. 
Treatment of these disorders remains a difficult clinical problem, requiring in many of these 
conditions the long -term use of corticosteroids alone or combined with other immunomodulatory 
therapy. These therapeutic ap proaches are not effective in all patients and conditions and have 
broad immunosuppressive effects causing considerable toxicity and treatment -related morbidity.  
Treatments aimed at reducing the quantity of circulating IgG autoantibodies, including 
plasmap heresis, immunoadsorption, or high dose IVIg, are being used for primary and secondary 
therapy of autoimmune diseases. The therapeutic approach of these treatments is thought in part 
to be based on lowering levels of pathogenic autoantibodies, which repres ents rational and 
effective treatment modalities of autoimmune diseases.  
Therefore, specific removal of the IgG autoantibodies by FcRn blockade may provide an 
effective therapeutic option for IgG autoantibody -mediated autoimmune disorders.  
More detailed in formation regarding the nonclinical and clinical development programs for 
rozanolixizumab, including all completed and ongoing studies, can be found in the latest version 
of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).

Confidential  Page 33 of 140 2.1 Study rationale   
MG0007 will complement the ongo ing Phase 3 study, MG0003, and replace the open -label 
extension (OLE) study, MG0004. The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 
rozanolixizumab over the initial 6 -week treatment cycle and subsequent treatment cycles when 
given as nee ded based on worsening of gMG symptoms. The study will gather information on 
the efficacy response of subsequent treatment cycles and the duration until next treatment is 
needed. The study will support the intended use of rozanolixizumab in study participa nts with 
gMG, (ie, repeated 6 -week treatment cycles based on worsening of symptoms).  
MG0003 is a Phase 3 study of rozanolixizumab in anti -acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or 
anti-muscle -specific kinase (MuSK) autoantibody -positive participants with gMG who 
experience moderate to severe symptoms and are being considered for additional treatment such 
as IVIg or PEX. The primary objective is to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of rozanolixizumab 
in study participants with gMG. The study consists of a Screening Period of up to 4 weeks, 
followed by a 6 -week double blind Treatment Period, and a blinded Observation Period of 8 
weeks. MG0003 will provide the core data to support marketing authorization application 
globally. The current OLE study, MG0004, is a Phase 3 , randomized study to evaluate the long -
term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of rozanolixizumab in study participants with gMG.  
The MG0007 study has been designed with the following considerations:   
1. Double -blind placebo -controlled data will be collect ed on a single cycle as part of the 
MG0003 study. MG0007 will provide data on subsequent treatment cycles when given as 
needed based on worsening of gMG symptoms.  
2. An open -label design is deemed appropriate since a placebo controlled long -term extension 
study may raise ethical concerns  
3. The dose and treatment regimen for rozanolixizumab (equivalent to approximately 7mg/kg or 
10mg/kg QW for 6 -week treatment cycle) in MG0007 are identical to that used in MG0003.  
4. For comprehensive data collection, an extended 16-week Observation Period was chosen to 
investigate maintenance of effect after a 6 -week treatment cycle.  
2.2 Background  
Rozanolixizumab is a humanized anti -FcRn monoclonal antibody that has been specifically 
designed to inhibit IgG binding to FcRn without in hibiting albumin binding to FcRn. 
Rozanolixizumab is being developed as an inhibitor of FcRn activity with the aim to reduce the 
concentration of pathogenic IgG in patients with IgG autoantibody -mediated diseases.  
To date, rozanolixizumab has been administ ered to human study participants in 8 completed 
clinical studies (UP0018, UP0060, MG0002, MG0003, MG0004, CIDP01, CIDP04, TP0001) 
and 6 ongoing studies ( UP0106, TP0003, TP0006, TP0004, MOG001, and AIE001). UP0018 is 
a completed first -in-human study, MG0002  is a completed Phase 2 study in study participants 
with gMG, and  is a completed Phase 2 study in study participants with primary , and 
UP0060 is a completed Phase  1 study comparing the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), 
and pharmacodyn amics (PD) of rozanolixizumab in Chinese, Japanese and Caucasian healthy 
volunteers.

Confidential  Page 34 of 140 In MG0002, clinically relevant improvements in day -to-day functioning, as measured by change 
from Baseline to Day 29 in myasthenia gravis -activities of daily living (MG -ADL) (secondary 
endpoint), were observed following treatment with rozanolixizumab 7mg/kg compared with 
placebo (p=0.036). Numerical differences numerical in favor of rozanolixizumab 7mg/kg 
compared with placebo were observed in reductions from Baseline in qu antitative myasthenia 
gravis (QMG) (p=0.221) and MG -C score (p=0.089). Overall, repeated administrations of 
rozanolixizumab at dose levels of 7mg/kg and 4mg/kg sc have been generally well tolerated, 
with an acceptable safety profile. No new safety concerns  were identified. The treatment -
emergent adverse event (TEAE) profile was similar between rozanolixizumab and placebo 
except for headaches where increased frequency and severity was observed in the 
rozanolixizumab study participants.  
Final data from the proof -of-concept  demonstrated that rozanolixizumab was 
tolerated with an acceptable safety profile after multiple (4, 7, and 10mg/kg) and single (15  and 
20mg/kg) doses.  
MG0003 is a Phase  3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled stud y to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of 2 doses of rozanolixizumab (equivalent to approximately 7mg/kg and 
10mg/kg) in study participants with gMG who experience moderate to severe symptoms and are 
being considered for additional treatment such as IVIg or  PEX.  
MG0004 is an open -label extension study for the lead -in study, MG0003, evaluating the long -
term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of rozanolixizumab in study participants with gMG. Study 
participants in MG0004 are randomized to receive weekly doses of rozanolixizumab (equivalent 
to approximately 7mg/kg and 10mg/kg, respectively) over a 52 -week Treatment Period.  
MG0007 is a Phase 3 OLE study to evaluate the long -term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 
repeated 6 -week treatment cycles of rozanolixiz umab based on MG worsening in study 
participants with gMG. This OLE study will provide the opportunity for study participants from 
the MG0003 and MG0004 to receive long -term rozanolixizumab treatment based on their MG 
symptom needs.  
Once the OLE study MG00 07 is activated at sites and ongoing study participants have had the 
opportunity to rollover into MG0007, MG0004 will be closed.  
2.3 Benefit/Risk assessment  
Generalized MG is a rare, debilitating, chronic autoimmune disease driven by, in large part, IgG 
autoan tibodies that target neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Most current treatment approaches 
are not targeted treatments to the specific underlying pathology of IgG autoantibody formation, 
but rather they produce a broad cascade of immune suppression, which resu lts in undesirable 
side effects such as those seen with high -dose chronic steroid use. Many treatments of choice 
often require invasive, expensive, and time -consuming inpatient procedures such as PEX, or 
intravenous (IV) administration of immunoglobulins a t a healthcare facility.  
Rozanolixizumab represents an innovative, subcutaneous (sc) anti -FcRn monoclonal antibody 
that may provide a novel and specific targeted therapeutic approach for the treatment of patients 
with MG. Data show that rozanolixizumab mar kedly lowers serum IgG and IgG autoantibody 
levels in patients with generalized MG. The completed Phase 2 study MG0002 established 
supportive evidence of efficacy for the treatment of MG, achieving significant and clinically

placebo (p=0.036). Repeated administrations of rozanolixizumab were generally and well 
tolerated, with an acceptable safety profile and in line with sc dosing in the Phase 1 program and 
the safety  profile observed in TP0001.  
In MG0003, a Phase 3 study evaluating efficacy and safety of sc rozanolixizumab in adult study 
participants with gMG, the  clinical efficacy of rozanolixizumab was demonstrated by 
improvements versus placebo in all effica cy endpoints tested in the study. There were clinically 
meaningful and statistically significant reductions from Baseline in the primary endpoint, 
MG-ADL score, at Day 43 for both rozanolixizumab dose groups versus placebo.  
The identified adverse drug reac tions (ADRs) associated with sc administration of 
rozanolixizumab are headaches, diarrhoea, pyrexia, nausea, upper respiratory tract infections, 
arthralgia, rash, injections site reactions, vomiting, myalgia , and herpes simplex infections. 
Headache is the most commonly reported ADR. Headaches were mostly mild to moderate and 
easily managed with over -the-counter medications. Serious infections and hypersensitivity 
reactions are the safety concerns with rozanolixizumab. Other safety topics of interest include  
effects on vaccination response, effects on the kidney, reductions in albumin and plasma 
proteins, drug -induced aseptic meningitis (DIAM) , and . These risks can 
be mitigated by careful monitoring, exclusion of at -risk study partic ipants, and appropriate 
protocol withdrawal and stopping criteria. Additionally, protocol guidance for management of 
severe and/or serious headaches  (AESM) , suspected aseptic meningitis (AESM) , hypersensitivity 
reactions, and  infection is also provided as well as expedited reporting requirements of AESM to 
UCB.  
Restrictions on use of live vaccines have been defined in the exclusion criterion 6 (Section  5.2) 
(exclusion criteria 7 in Gap Period Eligibility Criteria [Section  10.12 ]). If vaccination with non -
live vaccines (including COVID -19 vaccines) i s considered necessary once a study participant 
has started therapy with IMP, the degree of protection afforded with a vaccine may be 
compromised while the participant is being treated with IMP.  
Based on its mechanism of action, rozanolixizumab will reduce  total IgG levels including 
vaccine specific IgG. However, it is unlikely that the immunogenicity of the vaccine will be 
compromised by FcRn inhibition. Given the study population characteristics (eg, status of the 
underlying disease, concomitant immunosup pressive therapies, etc.) it is recommended to 
perform individualized benefit risk assessment for vaccination and specifically vaccination 
against COVID -19 infection. If COVID -19 vaccination is planned, information regarding 
vaccine should be recorded (Sec tion 6.5.1 ). Coronavirus Disease 2019 vaccination should be 
scheduled, if at all possible, to allow differentiation of safety profiles of IMP and vaccine (eg, a 
minimum window of 72 hours between COVID -19 vaccination and IMP administration). If any 
AEs were to occur, they should be handled as described in (Section  8.3) with causality 
assessment provided for both IMP and vaccine. Additionally, to further characterize the effect of 
rozanolixizumab on COVID -19 vaccination response, measurement of vaccine titers are being 
tested in rozanolixizumab de velopment programs.  
More detailed information about the known safety profile and expected adverse events (AEs) of 
rozanolixizumab may be found in the IB.

4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Overall design  
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, 2 -arm, OLE study to evaluate 6 -week treatment cycles of 
rozanolixizumab in study participants with gMG. MG0007 is an extension study of MG0003 and 
will be open for study participants from MG0003and MG0004 (see Section  4.1.1 ).  
Eligible study participants from MG0003 will be randomized to receive an initial fixed 6 -week 
treatment cycle of a subcutaneous dose of rozanolixizumab equivalent to approximately 7mg/kg 
or 10mg/kg Q W (see Figure  1-1 and Figure  1-2), followed by an O bservation Period that begins 
after the last dose of that treatment cycle as per assessments described in the Schedule of 
Activities (Section  1.3). 
Eligible study participants from MG0004 who have completed at least 6 scheduled visits for 
rozanolixizumab treatment and the PEOT visit can move directly into the Observation Period in 
MG0007. Additionally, eligible study participants from MG0004 who are i n the Observation

Confidential  Page 40 of 140 Period can complete the EOS visit and move directly into the Observation Period in MG0007 
(see Figure  1-1 and Figure  1-2). If IMP treatment was withheld for low IgG in MG0004, study 
participant's missed dose(s) can be counted as part of the total 6 visits for completion of MG0004 
and meet  eligibility requirements for MG0007. These study participants will undergo their first 
MG0007 treatment with rozanolixizumab upon worsening of gMG symptoms. Participants will 
continue on their last treatment dose from MG0004. Dose adjustments may be appli ed in future 
cycles as per description below.  
The rollover into MG0007 must be completed within 4 weeks after the EOS visit from MG0003, 
or the PEOT or EOS (as appropriate) visit from MG0004. In the event a study participant has a 
gap period (>4 weeks) bet ween the EOS or PEOT visit from the lead -in study and the start of 
MG0007, a Screening Period (see Appendix 11, Section  10.11 ) of up to 4 weeks will b e 
applicable to confirm that the study participant still meets the eligibility criteria for entry into 
MG0007 (see Appendix 12, Section  10.12 ). 
In cas e of symptom worsening (eg, an increase of 2.0 points on the MG -ADL or 3.0 points on 
the QMG scale) between assessments, resulting in a need for additional treatment, study 
participants will undergo another 6 -week treatment cycle followed by an Observation  Period, 
based on the Investigator's discretion.  
The dose may be adjusted to 7mg/kg or 10mg/kg at the beginning of each treatment cycle based 
on the Investigator's discretion. Rules for dose modification and temporary treatment hold are 
described in Sectio n 6.6 and Section  6.7. The minimal time to start the next treatment cycle is 4 
weeks followi ng the last dose of the treatment period of the previous cycle. If a study participant 
requires treatment earlier than 4 weeks, IgG levels from the previous cycle should be considered 
and discussed with the Medical Monitor . A new treatment cycle should not  be initiated until total 
IgG level is ≥2g/L.  
Participants in MG0007 will remain on their gMG background medications ( Table  6-3). With the 
exception of  corticosteroids and AChE inhibitors, all gMG medication doses should be 
maintained during each respective 6 -week treatment cycle and efforts should be made to 
maintain a stable dose during the first 8 weeks of the Observation Period.  
Study participants wh o receive rescue therapy (IVIg, PEX, SCIg, or iv corticosteroid) during the 
Treatment Period are not eligible to receive any further treatment with rozanolixizumab, must 
complete an additional 8  weeks of follow up after the last dose of rozanolixizumab. St udy 
participants must complete the first 8 weeks of the Observation Period after the last dose of 
rozanolixizumab prior to completing the EOS visit assessments , and subsequently will be 
withdrawn from the study (Section  4.4).  
Those patients who received rescue therapy (IVIg, PEX, SCIg, or iv corticosteroid) during the 
observation or no treatment with rozanolixizumab  periods may continue in the study at the 
Investigator’s discretion and after discussion with Medical Monitor and/or UCB Study 
Physician. The following cycle of rozanolixizumab should in general not start earlier than 4 
weeks following the last dose of IVI g, SCIg, or iv corticosteroids or the last PEX session, unless 
there is a medical reason, and an earlier treatment initiation is being considered  for the study 
participant as agreed upon with the Medical Monitor and/or UCB Study physician.  
Study parti cipants (not withdrawn from the study; criteria outlined in Section  7.2) will continue 
in the study and until product approval or until transition to a managed access program (MAP), if

In exceptional circumstances (eg, pandemic, hurricanes, etc) where study -specific investigations 
may not be conducted according to study protocol, contingency measures will be in place (see 
Section  8). 
4.1.1  Study population  
Study participants will enter from MG0003, or MG0004. Participants eligible for enrollment in 
this study completed MG0003, required rescue therapy during the Obse rvation Period in 
MG0003 (except for study participants who opted to receive IVIg or PEX in MG0003), or 
completed at least 6 treatment visits in MG0004.  
Study participants directly enrolling from MG0003 can use the EOS assessments as the Baseline 
(Day 1) in MG0007.   
Study participants directly enrolling from MG0004 who have completed at least 6 visits 
regardless of the number of infusions (due to low IgG resulting in IMP treatment hold) will 
complete the PEOT visit (if entering from Treatment Period of MG 0004) or EOS visit (if 
entering from Observation Period of MG0004) assessments from MG0004 and will directly enter 
the Observation Period (Visit 9 [Day 71]) of the initial fixed cycle.  
A study participant who had to discontinue receiving treatment under th e MG0003, or MG0004 
due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic (ie, due to logistic reasons, 
resolution of suspected or confirmed COVID -19 infection, or fulfillment of quarantine period 
due to exposure) and provided no parameter(s) meeting the  protocol -defined study drug 
discontinuation criteria can potentially enter MG0007. The Investigator should assess all 
available medical information prior to the study participant joining MG0007. The Investigator 
must discuss the eligibility for the study participant to join the MG0007 study based on a 
thorough individualized benefit -risk evaluation (ie, disease status, alternative options, AE profile, 
laboratory assessments), the regional situation, and protocol criteria and treatment schema with 
the Spons or’s Study Physician. Study participants with a gap of >4 weeks between the EOS visit 
from the lead -in study and the start of MG0007 must have an eligibility assessment performed 
during a 4 -week Screening Period (see Section  10.11 ). 
No formal sample size calculation can be performed. Approximately 200 study participants will 
be enrolled at approximately 130 sites from North America, Europe, and Asia (including Japan).  
4.1.2  Dosing  
The doses and regimen selected for the rozanolixizumab Phase 3 study, MG0003, was based on 
data from the Phase 2 studies in the MG and ), and Phase 1 data 
in healthy study participants. To date, there h as not been any data to indicate that the doses used 
in MG0003 should be modified. Therefore, this OLE study will continue treatment with 
rozanolixizumab sc fixed doses across body weight tiers equivalent to approximately 7mg/kg and 
10mg/kg administered QW  for 6  weeks ( Table  1-1). Weight -based dose adjustments should be 
limited to a maximum of every 6 months during the study.

study (see Section  6.6). 
4.2 Scientific rationale for stud y design  
MG0007 will complement the ongoing Phase 3 study, MG0003, and replace the chronic 
treatment OLE study, MG0004. The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 
rozanolixizumab over the initial 6 -week treatment cycle and subsequent  treatment cycles when 
given as needed based on worsening of gMG symptoms. The study will gather information on 
the efficacy response of subsequent treatment cycles and the duration until next treatment is 
needed. The study will support the intended use of  rozanolixizumab in study participants with 
gMG, (ie, repeated 6 -week treatment cycles based on worsening of symptoms).  
MG0003 is a Phase 3 study of rozanolixizumab in anti -acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or 
anti-muscle -specific kinase (MuSK) autoantibody -positive participants with gMG who 
experience moderate to severe symptoms and are being considered for additional treatment such 
as IVIg or PEX. The primary objective is to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of rozanolixizumab 
in study participants with gMG.  The study consists of a Screening Period of up to 4 weeks, 
followed by a 6 -week double blind Treatment Period, and a blinded Observation Period of 8 
weeks. MG0003 will provide the core data to support marketing authorization application 
globally. The OLE study, MG0004, is a Phase 3, randomized study to evaluate the long -term 
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of rozanolixizumab in study participants with gMG.  
The MG0007 study has been designed with the following considerations:   
1. Double -blind placebo -controlled data will be collected on a single cycle as part of MG0003. 
MG0007 will provide data on subsequent treatment cycles when given as needed based on 
worsening of gMG symptoms.  
2. An open -label design is deemed appropriate since a  placebo controlled long -term extension 
study may raise ethical concerns  
3. The dose and treatment regimen for rozanolixizumab (equivalent to approximately 7mg/kg or 
10mg/kg QW and for 6 -week treatment cycle) in MG0007 are identical to that used in 
MG0003.  
4. For comprehensive data collection, a 16 -week Observation Period was chosen to investigate 
maintenance of effect after the 6 -week treatment cycle.  
4.3 Justification for dose  
The dose and regimen of rozanolixizumab (equivalent to approximately 10mg/kg or 7mg/kg, 
administered sc QW) is selected based on the results from first -in-human study UP0018, the 
Phase 2 clinical studies in MG and  (MG0002 and ) as well as the doses selected for 
use in the pivotal Phase 3 study, MG0003; fixed -unit doses equivalent to approximately 7mg/kg 
or 10mg/kg QW. UP0018 was a randomized, investigator - and study participant -blind, placebo -
controlled, single dose -escalating study to evaluate the safety and PK and to explore the PD of 
rozanolixizumab doses of 1mg/kg, 4mg/kg, and 7mg /kg administered as an iv or sc infusion over 
 in 49 healthy male and female volunteers. Data indicate that mean absolute decreases 
in IgG and mean percent change from Baseline IgG were greater in the active dose groups (n=6 
each) compared to the  pooled iv and sc placebo group (n=12) with median maximum decreases

dose. Rozanolixizumab was tolerated with an acceptable safety profile after the single 
administ ration of a 7mg/kg sc dose, and all participant reported TEAEs were mild or moderate in 
severity.  
MG0002 was a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, investigator - and study participant -blind, 
placebo -controlled, 2 -arm repeat dose, treatment sequence study eval uating the safety and 
efficacy of rozanolixizumab sc (4mg/kg and 7mg/kg) in 43 study participants with generalized 
MG. Marked improvements in patient -reported MG symptoms and disability, as measured by 
change from Baseline to Day 29 in MG -ADL, were observe d following treatment with 
rozanolixizumab 7mg/kg compared with placebo. The least squares (LS) mean (standard error 
[SE]) change from Baseline was -1.8 (0.5) for the Rozanolixizumab 7mg/kg Group and -0.4 (0.5) 
for the Placebo Group. The difference between  treatment groups was -1.4 (p=0.036 [95% upper 
confidence interval (CI): -0.4]). Smaller but numerical differences in favor of rozanolixizumab 
7mg/kg vs placebo were observed in reductions from Baseline in QMG on Day 29 with the LS 
mean (SE) change from Ba seline of -1.8 (0.6) for the Rozanolixizumab 7mg/kg Group and -1.2 
(0.6) for the Placebo Group. The LS mean (SE) change from Baseline in MG -C score to Day 29 
was -3.1 (0.9) for the Rozanolixizumab 7mg/kg Group and -1.2 (0.9) for the Placebo Group. In 
gener al, responder rates for QMG score, MG -C score, and MG -ADL score were higher for the 
rozanolixizumab 7mg/kg group than the placebo group. Serum total IgG concentrations and 
AChR autoantibodies rapidly decreased from Baseline in the rozanolixizumab 7mg/kg gr oup in 
Dosing Period 1 and continued to decline on further dosing with 7mg/kg to a mean nadir of 
3.3g/L for total IgG (  reduction from Baseline). Overall, repeated administrations of 
rozanolixizumab at dose levels of 7mg/kg and 4mg/kg sc have been gene rally  and well 
tolerated, with an acceptable safety profile. The TEAE profile was similar between 
rozanolixizumab and placebo, except for headaches where increased frequency and severity was 
observed in the rozanolixizumab -treated study participants.  
Consistent with the mechanism of action of rozanolixizumab, an increased catabolism of IgG 
will reduce disease -specific autoantibodies with corresponding improvements in clinical signs 
and symptoms. Two sc treatment arms, equivalent to individual 7mg/kg a nd 10mg/kg dosing, 
have been selected to provide maximal reduction in autoantibody concentration and result in 
clinically significant improvements in the primary endpoint. A dose of 7mg/kg has demonstrated 
clinical improvements in MG -ADL in MG0002 (as desc ribed above). Additional data from the 
Phase 2 study in study participants with  demonstrated that rozanolixizumab was 
well tolerated at 2 doses of 10mg/kg with further IgG reduction achieved. An individual 
equivalent dose of 10mg/kg has been i ncluded to assess if further improvements in MG -ADL 
(magnitude of response and time to onset of symptom relief) can be achieved at a higher dose 
level with greater and more rapid IgG reduction.  
A population PKPD model that characterizes the dose -exposure -IgG relationship was used to 
guide, through simulation, the choice of fixed -unit doses at each weight bracket that achieved 
equivalent IgG reductions (mean and 90% prediction interval) to the weight -based (mg/kg) 
dosing regimens studied previously. These mo dels-based simulations demonstrate that the 
proposed weekly doses of rozanolixizumab for 6 consecutive weeks are expected to produce 
mean maximum IgG reductions of . These reductions will be achieved rapidly and 
maintained consistently over the Treatme nt Period.

6.2 Preparation, handling, storage, and accountability requirements  
The Investigator or  designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study treatment received and any discrepancies are reported and 
resolved before use of the study treatment.  
Only participants enrolled in the study may re ceive study treatment and only authorized site staff 
may supply or administer study treatment. All study treatments must be stored in a secure, 
environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the 
labeled storage cond itions with access limited to the Investigator and authorized site staff.  
The Investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study treatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance 
(ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).  
In case an out -of-range temperature is noted, it must be immediately reported as per instructions 
contained in the IMP Handling Manual.  
Further guidance and information for the final disposition of  unused study treatment are provided 
in the IMP Handling Manual.  
6.2.1  Drug accountability  
A Drug Accountability form will be used to record study medication dispensing and return 
information on a by -participant basis and will serve as source documentation dur ing the course 
of the study. Details of any study medication lost, damaged (due to breakage or wastage), not 
used, partially used, disposed of at the study site, or returned to the Sponsor or designee must

Confidential  Page 49 of 140 also be recorded on the appropriate forms. All sup plies and pharmacy documentation must be 
made available throughout the study for UCB (or designee) to review.  
The Investigator (or designee) is responsible for retaining all used, unused, and partially used 
containers of study medication until returned or destroyed.  
The Investigator may assign some of the Investigator’s duties for drug accountability at the study 
site to an appropriate pharmacist/designee.  
The Investigator must ensure that the study medication is used only in accordance with the 
protocol.  
Periodically, and/or after completion of the clinical phase of the study, all used (including empty 
containers)/partially used, unused, damaged, and/or expired study medication must be reconciled 
and either destroyed at the site according to local laws, reg ulations, and UCB and/or site SOPs or 
returned to UCB (or designee). Investigational medicinal product intended for the study cannot 
be used for any other purpose than that described in this protocol.  
6.3 Measures to minimize bias: randomization and blinding  
An interactive response technology (IRT) will be used for assigning eligible participants to a  
treatment regimen (as applicable) based on a predetermined production randomization and/or  
packaging schedule provided by UCB (or designee). The randomization sc hedule will be  
produced by the IRT vendor. The IRT will generate individual assignments for kits of study  
medication, as appropriate, according to the visit schedule. Study participants from MG0003 
who complete the EOS visit will be rerandomized in MG0007.  Randomization in MG0007 is to a 
ratio of 1:1. Study participants from MG0004 will not be rerandomized upon entering MG0007, 
but will continue their last treatment regimen received in MG0004 for their first treatment cycle 
in MG0007.  
To enroll a study participant (Visit 1), the Investigator or designee will contact the IRT and 
provide brief details about the participant to be enrolled. Study participants will retain the same 
5-digit number assigned at Screening in MG0003 that serves as the participant i dentifier 
throughout the study. The participant number will be required in all communication between the 
Investigator or designee and the IRT regarding a particular participant. Participant numbers and 
kit numbers will be tracked via the IRT.  
6.3.1  Procedures fo r maintaining and breaking the treatment blind  
6.3.1.1  Maintenance of study treatment blind  
This is an OLE study and treatment details (ie, dose arm) will not be blinded.  
To maintain study integrity, IgG level will remain blinded to the study sites and the UCB stu dy 
team for the first 4 weeks of the study.  
6.3.1.2  Breaking the treatment blind in an emergency situation  
Not applicable.

(where possible) discuss with the Medical Monitor and/or the Sponsor’s Study Physician and a 
decision will be made whether the study participant can continue in the study or be withdrawn . 
6.5.3  Treatments specific to NMJ interference  
Treatments could interfere  with the function of the NMJ (and which therefore could impair study 
participants with MG), such as, but not limited to, include the following medications:  
− botulinum toxin  
− aminoglycoside antibiotics  
− tetracycline antibiotics  
− penicillamine  
− magnesium  
For a  more detailed list please refer to the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) 
medication list ( https://myasthenia.org/What -is-MG/MG -Management/Cautionary -Drugs ). The 
benefit -risk of starting these medications should be carefully considered by the Investigator, and 
where possible, the Investigator will discuss with the Medical Monitor and/or sponsor’s Study 
Physician prior to initiating therapy that can affect the NMJ.  
6.5.4  Rescue medication  
The study site will supply rescue therapy that will be obtained  locally. Rescue therapy will be 
given as per standard of care and at the discretion of the Investigator. Study participants who 
continue to experience moderate to severe symptoms despite treatment with rozanolixizumab 
may be treated with the following as rescue therapy:  
• IVIg  
• SCIg  
• PEX, or plasmapheresis  
• iv corticosteroids at a higher dose than previous oral dose  
Participants who are treated with rescue therapy during the Treatment Period are not eligible to 
receive any further treatment with rozanolixizumab . Study participants must complete the first 8 
weeks of the Observation Period after the last dose of rozanolixizumab prior to completing the 
EOS visit assessments , and subsequently will be withdrawn from the study (Section  4.4).  
Those patients who received rescue therapy during the observation or no treatment with 
rozanolixizumab periods may continue in the study at the Investigator’s discretion and after 
discussion with Medical Monitor and/or UCB Study Physician. The following cycle of 
rozanolixizumab should in general not start earlier than 4 weeks following the last dose of IVIg, 
SCIg, or iv corticosteroids or the last PEX session, unless there is a medical reason, and an 
earlier treatment initiation is being considered  for the study participant as agreed upon with 
the Medical Monitor and/or UCB Study physician.  
The date and time of rescue medication administration as well as the name and dosag e regimen 
of the rescue medication must be recorded.

Dose modifications from 10mg/kg to 7mg/kg equivalent and vice versa is permitted at the 
beginning of the treatment cycles at the Investigator’s discretion, and if the benefit -risk rema ins 
favorable for the study participant. Recommended dose modifications from 10mg/kg to 7mg/kg 
equivalent due to drug -related adverse events which may include but not limited to:  
• Moderate to severe headaches that are considered to be related to rozanolixiz umab  
• Moderate to severe GI disturbances that are considered to be related to rozanolixizumab  
• Moderate to severe toxicities (≥Grade 2 as defined by Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events [CTCAE], version 5.0) for which rozanolixizumab cannot be ex cluded as a 
cause  
• Recurrent hypogammaglobulinemia with a serum total IgG level of <2g/L.  
6.7 Home (or Virtual) visits  
During the Treatment Period, the at -home visits will be conducted by fully trained healthcare 
professional visiting the study participant at h is or her home. Alternatively, these visits can be 
conducted at the site as deemed necessary by site personnel and/or the study participant. For 
home dosing, the same safety monitoring schedule will be followed as per onsite dosing. The 
home nurse will be present during the full duration of the visit. Home visits can be conducted if 
the following conditions are met:  
• The study participant is willing to be dosed and monitored at home by a home nurse.  
• The study participant has shown good acute tolerability to previous administrations of IMP 
(namely, he or she must have had no moderate or severe infusion reactions or other AEs that 
the Investigator considers could increase the risk of home administration).  
The Investigator should complete a checklist to confirm that criteria for home nurse and/or self - 
administration have been fully evaluated.  
Virtual visits will be conducted with study participants during the Observation Period and 
between cycles (see Schedule of Activities (Section  1.3); no treatment with rozanolixizumab) by 
site personnel. Alternatively, these visits can be conducted at the site as deemed necessary by site 
personnel and/or the study participant.  
6.8 Treatment after the end of the study  
Study participants who complete participation in MG0007 may have the possibility to continue 
receiving rozanolixizumab through a MAP if available, as indicated per the Sponsor and 
applicable per local regulations.  
In the case of prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia after treatment discontinuation, study 
participants must be followed up until IgG levels return to values within the normal range or to 
individual Baseline values.

Study participant must be  TEMPORARILY discontinued from the IMP  if any of the following 
events occur:  
1. The study participant develops an event of hypogammaglobulinemia with a serum total IgG 
of <1g/L irrespective of infection. When the IgG level reaches ≥2g/L, the study participant 
may be allowed to continue treatment with IMP (see Appendix 13; Section  10.13.1 ). 
2. Symptomatic cases of confirmed COVID -19 infection. The IMP may be restarted if clinically 
appropriate when signs and symptoms have resolved and in agreement with local guidelines.  
3. Study pa rticipant has a suspected DIAM. The IMP may be restarted if clinically appropriate 
when signs and symptoms have resolved.  Refer to Section  7.1.4  for permanent 
discontinuation criteria  (criterion #10) . 
Study participants may be TEMPORARILY discontinued from the IMP  if the following events 
occur:  
1. The study participant develops a nonserious persisting or recurrent infection with serum total 
IgG level between ≥1 and <2g/L. Upon resolution of infection and the IgG returning to level 
of ≥2g/L, the study participant may be allowed to resume treatment with the IMP (see 
Appendix 13; Section  10.13.1 ).  
2. Asymptomatic or suspected cases of COVID -19 infection. The IMP may be restarted when 
clinically appropriate as deemed by the Investigator and in agreement with local guidelines.  
3. Study participant has a moderate to severe infection (Grade 2 to 3) that may or may not result 
in hospitalization, unless the discontinuation criterion #3  is met. Decision to start a new 
treatment cycle should be based on careful evaluation by the Principa l Investigator of the 
Benefit -Risk for the individual study participant and provided a full recovery from infection 
has occurred, an acceptable level of total IgG (≥2g/L) has been reached and no other 
discontinuation criteria were met.  
The Investigator sho uld discuss with  the Medical Monitor and/or  Sponsor’s study physician prior 
to reinitiating the IMP. As appropriate, virtual assessments could continue (eg, AE collection, 
patient -reported outcome [ PRO ] assessments  as per contingency measures described in 
Section  8). 
If IMP treatment is resumed, continue the next dose as previously scheduled. No “make up” dose 
is permitted.

The date and reason for dose modification/hold of rozanolixizumab is to be recorded on each 
study participant’s eCRF.  
7.1.4  Study medication permanent discontinuation criteria  
Study participants must  permanently discontinue study medication if any of the following events 
occur:  
1. Study participant develops an illness that would interfere with his or her continued 
participation.  
2. Study participant has new onset or recurrent neoplastic disease (except for superficial basal 
or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin not requiring targeted biological therapy, 
chemotherapy or radiation).  
3. Study participant experiences a significant infective ep isode including but not limited to 
bacteremia/sepsis, infectious meningitis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, complicated 
pneumonia, or visceral abscess, which may or may not result in hospitalization during a 
treatment period. This list is not intended to  be all inclusive and the investigator is expected 
to apply his/her judgement on continuing IMP based on the clinical situation.  
However , if a significant infective episode is reported during observation and no treatment 
with rozanolixizumab period, the de cision to start a new treatment cycle should be based on 
careful evaluation by the Principal Investigator of the Benefit -Risk for the individual study 
participant and provided a full recovery from infection, an acceptable level of total IgG 
(≥2g/L) and no other discontinuation criteria were met.  
4. Study participant meets potential drug -induced liver injury (PDILI) permanent 
discontinuation criteria.  
5. Study participant has a TB test that is confirmed positive or any further evidence suggestive 
of potential TB i nfection (ie, exposure) and further examinations result in a diagnosis of 
active TB or latent TB infection (LTBI).  
6. If a nontuberculosis mycobacterium infection (NTMBI) is identified during a study, the same 
withdrawal procedures as those used for an active  TB infection identified during the study 
should be followed.  
7. Removed.  
8. Study participant has an AE of severe or serious infusion or anaphylactic reaction requiring 
corticosteroid and/or epinephrine therapy (Sampson et al, 2006).  
9. Study participant  is treate d with rescue therapy (IVIg, SCIg, PEX, or iv corticosteroids; see 
Section  6.5.4 ) during the Treatment Period. Those patients who received rescue therapy 
during the observation or no treatment with rozanolixizumab periods may continue in the 
study at the investigator’s discretion and after discussion with Medical Monitor and/or UCB 
Study Physician. The following cycle of rozanolixizumab should in general not start earlier 
than 4 weeks following the last dose of IVIg, SCIg, or iv corticosteroids or the last PEX

[Section  10.14 ]). 
Study participants may permanently discontinue rozanolixizumab and move into the 
Observation Period at the discretion of the Investigator, Medical Monitor, and Study Physician if 
any of the following events occur:  
1. Study participant  is noncompliant with the study procedures or medications in the opinion of 
the Investigator.  
2. Study participant  takes prohibited concomitant medications as defined in this protocol.  
Investigators should contac t the Medical Monitor , whenever possible, to discuss the withdrawal 
of a participant in advance. Investigators should attempt to obtain information on study 
participants in the event of withdrawal (eg, reason for withdrawal, any safety information).  
In the  event of study participant early withdrawal,  the scenarios as described in Section  4.4 need 
to be considered.  
7.2 Participant discontinuation/Withdrawal  from the study  
Participants are free to withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice to their continued 
care.  
Study participant s must  be withdrawn from the study if any of the following events occur:  
1. Study participant  withdraws his/her consent.  
2. The Sponsor or a regulatory agency requests withdrawal of the study participant.  
3. There is confirmation of a pregnancy during the study, as evidenced by a positive pregnancy 
test. 
4. Study participant has active suicidal ideation as indicated by a positive res ponse (Yes) to 
either Question 4 or Question 5 of the "Since Last Visit" version of the C -SSRS. The study 
participants should be referred immediately to a Mental Healthcare Professional.  
A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request, or may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, or 
administrative reasons.  
If the study participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may 
retain and contin ue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.  
If a study participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples 
taken and not tested, and the Investigator must document this in the site study records.  
See th e Schedule of Activities (Section  1.3) and Section  4.4 for data to be collected at the time of 
study discontinuation and follow -up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed.

A participant  will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.  
The following actions must be taken if a participant  fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and asc ertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the 
study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact with the participant (at least 1 phone call and 1 w ritten message 
to the participant), and document his/her effort (date and summary of the phone call and copy 
of the written message in the source documents), to complete the final evaluation . All results 
of these evaluations and observations, together with  a narrative description of the reason(s) 
for removing the participant, must be recorded in the source documents. The eCRF must 
document the primary reason for withdrawal.  
Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have  withdrawn 
from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up documented in the eCRF.

Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the Schedule of Activities (Section  1.3).  
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed.  
Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon occurrence 
or awareness to determine if the participan t should continue or discontinue study treatment.  
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of 
Activities (Section  1.3), is essential and required for study conduct.  
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants 
meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all 
participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as 
applicable.  
Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood count)  
and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for Screening or Baseline purposes 
provided the procedures met the protocol -specified criteria and were performed within the time 
frame defined in the Schedule of Activities (Section  1.3). 
An Unscheduled Visit can be conducted at the discretion of the Investigator (eg, due to an AE).  
During the Unscheduled Visit, the following assessments will be  performed:  
• AE reporting  
• Concomitant medications  
• Review of withdrawal criteria  
• Physical examination  
• Vital signs  
Blood samples for PK, IgG, hematology, biochemistry, other laboratory testing and assessments 
may be performed as clinically indicated at the discretion of the Investigator.  
Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the 
samples.  
Some study -specific investigations may not be conducted according to the study protocol during 
a pandemic or other excep tional circumstances (eg, hurricanes) due to the need to implement 
safety measures and guidance from regulatory authorities. In such a situation, which may be 
accompanied by local or global containment or other measures, sites may need to prohibit access 
to study participants and study -related personnel. Study participants visits to the study site may 
be replaced by contingency measures. These measures are primarily established to ensure the 
safety of study participants during the course of the study and to  maintain the study participants 
treatment schedule, if the Investigator considers it appropriate. These measures include but are 
not limited to virtual visits or home -nursing visits replacing site visits, eg, telemedicine contacts 
or home -nursing visits w hen treatment and/or blood sampling is scheduled. The contingency 
measures are described in a contingency plan and will be implemented as required.

Planned timepoints for all efficacy assessments are provided in the Schedule of Activit ies 
(Section  1.3). 
8.1.1  MGFA Classification  
The Investigator will classify the study participant’s MG using the MGFA Clinical Classification 
(Jaretzki e t al, 2000 ). This is a 5 -stage classification (I to V), with a higher class indicating more 
severe disease. To be eligible for this study, a participant with a gap period must be graded 
MGFA CLASS II to IVa at Visit 1, as per inclusion criteria (see Append ix 12 [Section  10.12 ]). 
8.1.2  Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis scale  
For assessment of the QMG scale, Investigators or qualified designee will follow the MGFA’s 
QMG Manual instructions. Clinical personnel must complete mandatory training to assess study 
participants’ QMG score (details are provided in the Study Procedures Manual). If not medically 
appropriate, then the treatment can be continued but the tes ting should be performed as best as 
possible at the same timeframe post last acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibitor dosing for each 
evaluation during the study. Study participants should not take pyridostigmine (or other AChE 
inhibitor medication) from midnig ht before testing when medically safe to do so to standardize 
testing (ie, if AChE inhibitors cannot be stopped). The scale tests 13 items, including ocular and 
facial involvement, swallowing, speech, limb strength, and forced vital capacity (FVC). For the  
assessment of FVC, the same spirometer should be used each time a study participant is tested, 
and if possible, the same person should carry out the assessment. The QMG is a validated 
assessment ( Barnett et al, 2012 ), with a higher score indicating more s evere disease. Scoring for 
each item ranges from no weakness (0) to severe weakness (3), with an overall score range from 
0 to 39. A 3 -point change in the total score is considered clinically relevant. Where possible, the 
same person should carry out the a ssessment at each visit.  
8.1.3  MG-Composite scale  
For assessment of the MG -C scale, the Investigator or qualified designee will examine the study 
participant to score all items, except for talking, chewing, and swallowing for which the study 
participant will sel f-assess. Study participants should not take pyridostigmine (or other AChE 
inhibitor medication) from midnight before testing when medically safe to do so to standardize 
testing. The MG -C scale is a validated assessment ( Burns et al, 2010 ), with a higher s core 
indicating more severe disease and a 3 -point change being of clinical relevance ( Muppidi et al, 
2011 ). The scale tests 10 items, with individual items being weighted differently. The overall 
score ranges from 0 to 50. Clinical personnel must complete mandatory training to assess study 
participants’ MG -C score (details are provided in the Study Procedures Manual). Where 
possible, the same person should carry out the assessment at each visit.  
8.1.4  Patient -reported outcomes  
Patient -repoted outcomes must be com pleted as per time points mentioned in the Schedule of 
Activities (Section  1.3). The PROs should be completed prior to any intrusive procedures in a  
quiet place.  
The PROs should be completed in the following order: MG -ADL, MG Symptoms PRO, EQ -5D-
5L, and MG -QOL15r. The PROs should only be checked for completeness. On dosing days, the

other AChE inhibitor medication) from midnight before the days when efficacy assessments are 
performed, when medically safe to do so to standardize testing.  
8.1.4.1  MG-Activities of Daily Living  
The MG -ADL is an 8 -item PRO instrument deve loped on the basis of the QMG ( Wolfe et al, 
1999 ). The MG -ADL targets symptoms and disability across ocular, bulbar, respiratory, and 
axial symptoms. In a recent study, reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the MG -ADL were 
further assessed. The ques tionnaire showed strong construct validity when evaluated against the 
MG-C as well as against the MG -QOL15r; high test -retest reliability in a 1 -week interval; and it 
was demonstrated that a 2 -point improvement indicates clinical improvement ( Muppidi, 2012 ; 
Muppidi et al, 2011 ). The total MG -ADL score ranges from 0 to 24, with a higher score 
indicating more disability.  
Independently of study visit type (site, home, or virtual), the MG -ADL must be completed by 
study participants in a quiet place by themselv es without the help of a partner or caregiver, 
before any clinical examination takes place. Study participants should be informed of the 
importance of this questionnaire and instructed to read the items and instructions carefully. They 
should be informed t hat there are no correct or incorrect answers.  
Study personnel are not allowed to interpret the items for the participant. If a participant asks for 
guidance, study personnel should instruct him/her to respond according to their best 
understanding of the i tem. The MG -ADL should only be checked for completeness by study 
personnel. In the event a few questionnaire items have not been completed, study personnel 
should only query this with the study participant, if this results from an omission. Study 
personnel  shall neither complete missing data nor suggest changes to participant responses. As 
with other study data, responses to the questionnaire should be treated as confidential 
information. Data privacy considerations apply.  
In the specific context of virtual  and home visits, paper copies of MG -ADL should be made 
available to study participants ahead of the visit. Site coordinators or study personnel (or an 
automatic alert mechanism) should remind study participants to complete MG -ADL before visit 
start and to  record the date upon completion of the questionnaire. Once they have completed 
MG-ADL, study participants should transfer it electronically to site personnel. In the event study 
personnel finds out that MG -ADL has not been completed before the visit, stud y participants 
should be allowed some additional time to complete the questionnaire before any study related 
assessment is initiated.  
8.1.4.2  MG Symptoms PRO  
The MG Symptoms PRO instrument consists of 42 items across 5 scales: ocular symptoms 
(items 1 -5); bulbar s ymptoms (items 6 -15); respiratory symptoms (items 16 -18); physical fatigue 
(items 19 -33) and muscle weakness fatigability (items 34 -42). 
The study participant will be asked to choose the response option that best describes the severity 
of ocular, bulbar, a nd respiratory symptoms over the past 7  days using a 4 -point Likert scale 
(“none” to “severe”) and how frequently they experience physical fatigue and muscle weakness 
fatigability over the past 7 days using a 5 -point Likert scale (“none of the time” to “al l of the

higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.  
8.1.4.3  EQ-5D-5L 
The 5 -level EQ -5D (EQ -5D-5L) is designed to improve the instrument’s sensitivity and to 
reduce ceiling effects.  
The EQ -5D-5L essentially consists of 2 pages: the EQ -5D descriptive system and the EuroQol 
visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).  
The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight 
problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to 
indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of 
the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1 -digit number that expresses the level selected for 
that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5 -digit number that 
describes the patient’s health state.  
The EQ VAS records t he patient’s self -rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the 
endpoints are labelled ‘The best health you can imagine’ and ‘The worst health you can 
imagine’. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the 
patient’s own judgement.  
8.1.4.4  MG-QOL15r  
The MG -QOL15r is a brief survey, completed by the study participant, that is designed to assess 
some aspects of "quality of life" related to MG. The MG -QOL15r was designed to assess the 
"patient perspective" in the everyday clinic setting or in a clinical study.  
When completing the 15 -item MG -QOL15r, MG study participant should consider only how 
their MG affects these items. For example, if a study participant has no leg weakness but has a 
painful hip (unrelated to t he MG) that causes walking trouble, the study participant should report 
"not at all" to the item of, "I have trouble walking.” This is because any hip -related walking 
trouble is unrelated to the MG. One other note of clarification: if the study participant  is retired 
(unrelated to MG), he or she should report “not at all” to the item about whether the MG 
negatively impacts job/occupational status.  
8.2 Safety assessments  
Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the Schedule of Activities 
(Section  1.3). 
8.2.1  Physical examination  
A complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, general appearance; ear, nose, and 
throat; eyes, hair,  and skin; and assessments of the of the cardiovascular, respiratory, GI, 
neurological, and musculoskeletal systems. Height and weight will also be measured and 
recorded. Body weight will be measured with the study participant wearing light clothing and 
without wearing shoes.  
A brief physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the skin, respiratory 
system, cardiovascular system, and abdomen (liver and spleen).

severe and/or serious headache and for any study participant who experiences suspected aseptic 
meningitis  (Appendix 14 [ Section  10.14 ]). A full neurological assessment will include: 
(1) General appearance, including posture, motor activity and meningeal signs and, if indicated, 
the following assessments will be performed; (2)  Cranial nerves examination; (3)  Motor system 
examination, including muscle tone and power and sensory system examination – light touch; 
(4) Reflexes, including deep tendon reflexes; (5)  Coordination, gait (if possible); and (6) 
Fundoscopy.  
Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to pr evious serious illnesses.  
Clinically relevant findings or worsening of previous findings will be recorded as AEs.  
8.2.2  Vital signs  
Oral, tympanic, temporal or axillary temperature,  pulse rate, and blood pressure will be assessed.  
Blood pressure and pulse measu rements should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest for the 
participant in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, television, cell phones). All measurements 
will be assessed in a sitting position with a completely automated device. Manual technique s will 
be used only if an automated device is not available.  
All vital signs should be taken before any blood sampling and IMP administration, unless 
otherwise indicated . 
In case of untoward event, additional vitals (unscheduled assessment) should be taken  at the 
discretion of the investigator and post observation time can be extended. These recommendations 
are applicable for dosing at site and at home.  
For the initial 2 infusions after switching to manual push, vital signs will be measured prior to 
IMP adm inistration, at the end of the infusion (±15 minutes), and 1 hour after the end of the 
infusion (±15 minutes). For the subsequent infusions, vital signs are not collected after IMP 
administration.  
8.2.3  Electrocardiograms  
Twelve -lead ECG will be obtained as outl ined in the Schedule of Activities (see Section  1.3) 
using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, 
and QTc intervals. Refer to Section  7.1.2  for QTc withdrawal criteria and any additional [QTc] 
readings that may be necessary.  
All ECG recordings should be taken with the study participant resting in the supine position for 
at least 5  minutes before the recording.  
In cases of abnormal ECG reading, triplicate ECG will be required, three individual ECG 
tracings should be obtained as closely as possible in succession.

laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged 
by the Investigator to be more severe than expected  for the participant's condition.  
All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during the 6 -week 
treatment period or within 8 weeks  after the last dose of study medication should be repeated 
until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by 
the Investigator or Medical Monitor.  
If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by the 
Investigator, the etiology should be identified, and the Sponsor notified.  
All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2 (Section  10.2), must be 
conducted in accordance with t he laboratory manual and the Schedule of Activities ( Section  1.3).  
If laboratory values from non -protocol specified laboratory assessments performe d at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered 
clinically significant by the Investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the results 
must be recorded in the eCRF.  
8.2.5  Suicidal risk monitoring  
Study participants being treated with rozanolixizumab should be monitored appropriately for 
suicidal ideation and behavior or any other unusual changes in behavior. Consideration should be 
given to discontinuing rozanolixizumab in study participants who expe rience signs of suicidal 
ideation or behavior.  
Families and caregivers of study participants being treated with rozanolixizumab should be 
instructed to monitor participants for the emergence of unusual changes in behavior, as well as 
the emergence of suic idal ideation and behavior, and to report such symptoms immediately to the 
study Investigator.  
Suicidality will be assessed by trained study personnel using the Columbia Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale (C -SSRS) (Columbia Univerity Medical Center, 2008). The C-SSRS will be 
performed at the scheduled timepoints as described in the Schedule of Activities ( Section  1.3). 
8.2.6  Assessment and management of TB and TB risk factors  
Precautions are being taken within this protocol to monitor the risk of TB infection in this study 
(see Section  5.2). Any presumptive diagnosis or diagnosis of a TB infection is a reportable event.  
Assessment and management of TB and TB risk factors should follow local/national guidel ines. 
Physical Examination  
The Investigator should consider all potential sites of infection when assessing for TB during the 
physical examination, and other evaluations, and based on the study participant’s medical or 
social history. Sites commonly infect ed by TB include: the lungs, larynx, lymph glands, pleura, 
GI system, genito urinary tract (including renal), bones and joints, meninges, peritoneum, 
pericardium, and skin. This is not an exhaustive list and unusual presentations and areas of 
involvement s hould always be considered.  
Some common symptoms that the study participant may present are dependent on the primary 
focus of infection and may include cough, blood in sputum, night sweats, lymphadenitis, joint

(Center for Disease Control and Prevent ion diagnosis of LTB infection 
[http://www.cdc.gov/TB/topic/testing/default.htm]).  
TB signs and symptoms questionnaire  
In addition to a physical examination done intermittently throughout the study, study participants 
will be evaluated both for signs and symptoms of latent or active TB infection and for risk 
factors for exposure to TB using the TB questionnaire as indicated in the schedule of study 
assessments (cross reference to table of schedule of study assessment).  
The TB questionnaire should be comple ted accurately and filed as a critical source document. 
The questionnaire will assist with the identification of study participants who may require 
therapy for TB.  
A “Yes” response to any of the questions in the TB questionnaire during the  study may trigg er 
further assessment  to determine  if the  study participant has either  LTBI and must receive  
prophylactic  LTBI therapy or active  TB infection and must be withdrawn from  the study. As an 
example, a  study participant  who answers  “Yes” at Screening to  the question “Has the subject 
been  in close (eg, sleeping in the same room) contact with an individual with active  TB, or an 
individual who  has rece ntly been treated  for TB?” should not be allowed into the study pending 
further assessments (including TB specia list consult) as outlined previously.  
TB assessment by IGRA  
The TB test interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) is performed at Screening in MG0003, and 
the final visit in MG0004 (Visit 52 [PEOT] or Visit 53 [EOS]) will serve as Baseline in 
MG0007. The TB screening is mandatory both before study entry and at study completion 
(EOS). The preferred screening test is interferon -gamma release assay (IGRA) performed at a 
Central Laboratory by QuantiFERON tube test (for Japan -specific regulations, see Appendix 8 
[Section  10.8]). Additional IGRA test will be performed if indicated ( eg, presence of signs and 
symptoms suggestive of TB, recent exposure ).  
In high TB  incidence countries, it is recommended that the IGRA be the first test performed at 
screening to reduce the number of unnecessary screening procedures on any IGRA positive study 
participants that may need to be treated for TB prophylaxis or potentially wi thdrawn from the 
study.  
The test results will be reported as positive, negative, or indeterminate.  
If an IGRA is positive or indeterminate the study participant must be evaluated by a TB 
specialist.  
• Positive IGRA  
The positive IGRA may represent new LTBI or active TB infection. The positive IGRA result 
may also reflect positivity from a recently diagnosed and adequately treated (in progress or 
completed within the past 12 months) LTBI or from adequately treated past TB infection. In such 
cases, the study p articipants must be evaluated by a TB specialist.

Confidential  Page 66 of 140 • Indeterminate IGRA  
If the IGRA test result is indeterminate, the IGRA previously performed may be repeated once. 
If the test is positive or indeterminate on retest, the study participant must be evaluated b y a TB 
specialist.  
TB assessment by chest X -ray  
A Screening chest X -ray is not required for MG0007. However, a chest X -ray or other imaging 
test should be performed only if indicated (eg, presence of signs and symptoms suggestive of 
TB, close exposure to persons with TB), and interpreted by a qualified specialist (ie, radiologist 
or pulmonologist).  
Test Conversion  
Tuberculosis test conversion is defined as a positive or indeterminate (and confirmed 
indeterminate on repeat) IGRA result for the current test when previous IGRA test results were 
negative. During the study, all study participants with positive or indeter minate IGRA test results 
must immediately stop study drug administration.  
In case of a IGRA test conversion, the study participant must be considered as having either a 
suspected new latent or an active TB infection and be promptly referred to an appropriate 
specialist (eg, pulmonologist, infectious disease specialist) for further evaluation. If test 
conversion indicates LTBI, active TB, or NTMB then, TB test conversion (confirmed) should be 
classified adequately, either as due to LTBI, active TB i nfection, or NTMB, respectively. 
Additional assessments (eg, blood tests or IGRA, chest X -rays, or other imaging) should be 
performed where medically relevant and documented. Such conversions should be reported as 
AEs as described in the protocol. The AE t erm would need to be updated with final diagnosis 
once available.  
Latent TB  
Latent TB infection is defined as the absence of signs, symptoms (eg, evidence of organ specific 
involvement), or physical findings suggestive of TB infection with a positive IGRA test (or 2 
indeterminate IGRA test results) and a chest X -ray (or other imaging) without evidence of TB 
infection.  
LTBI must be reported as an AE and graded appropriately as described in the protocol. Follow -
up reports should be completed as per protocol r equirement until such time as the LTBI resolves.  
Active TB or non -tuberculosis mycobacterium infection  
Study participants who develop active TB or NTMB infection during the study (conversion 
demonstrated by IGRA) must be withdrawn from the study. The stud y participant must be 
immediately permanently discontinued from study medication and a PEOT Visit must be 
scheduled as soon as possible, but no later than the next scheduled visit. Treatment for active TB 
or NTMB should be started immediately based on loca l guidelines.  
Confirmed active TB is always considered Serious Adverse Event. UCB’s process requires that 
these must be captured on an SAE report form and provided to the Sponsor in accordance with 
SAE reporting requirements. Follow -up reports should be co mpleted as per protocol requirement 
until such time as the TB infection resolves.

During the study, study participants who develop evidence of LTBI, active TB or NTMB 
infection must immediately stop fur ther administration of study medication and will be referred 
to an appropriate TB specialist (pulmonologist or infectious disease specialist) for further 
evaluation. Study participants diagnosed with active TB or LTBI should receive appropriate TB 
or proph ylaxis therapy. The study participant should be transferred to the care of their Physician 
and managed according to the standard of care.  
If infection with NTMB is identified during the study, the same procedure as for active TB 
acquired during the study and compliant TB treatment shall be followed.  
Follow -up information of suspected and confirmed TB cases should be provided to UCB at least 
after 3, 9, and 12 months of the start date of anti TB treatment, including hematological and 
biochemical safety par ameters, X -ray evolution data, and TB diagnostic procedures used to 
follow -up and confirm recovery of TB.  
8.3 Adverse events and serious adverse events  
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 3 (Section  10.3). The definitions of 
device -related safety events, (adverse device effects [ADEs] and serious adverse device effects 
[SADEs]), can be found in Appendix 8 (Section  10.8). Device deficiencies are addressed in 
Appendix 8 ( Section  10.8). 
Adverse events will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, 
surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized representative).  
The Investigator and any design ees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs 
that are serious, considered related to the study treatment or study procedures, or that caused the 
participant to discontinue study treatment or MG0007 (see Section  7). 
8.3.1  Time period and frequency for collecting AE and SAE information  
All SAEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF until the EOS visit at the time points 
specified in the Schedule of Activities ( Section  1.3). 
All AEs will be c ollected from the signing of the ICF  until the EOS visit at the time points 
specified in the Schedule of Activities ( Section  1.3). 
In order to ensur e complete safety data collection, all AEs occurring during the study (ie,  after 
the signing of the ICF), including any pretreatment and posttreatment periods required by the 
protocol, must be reported in the eCRF even if no study medication was taken but specific study 
procedures were conducted. This includes all AEs not present prior to the initial visit and all AEs 
that recurred or worsened after the initial visit.  
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor  or designee within 24 hours, as indicated 
in Appendix 3. The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 
24 hours of it being available.  
The Investigator is specifically requested to collect and report to UCB (or its representative) any 
SAEs (even if the Investiga tor is certain that they are in no way associated with the study 
medication), up to 30 days from the end of the study for each participant, and to also inform

that the Investigator thinks may be associated with the study medication must be reported to 
UCB regardless of the time between the event and the end of the study.  
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures 
for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3 (Section  10.3). 
8.3.2  Method of detecting AEs and SAEs  
Care will be taken not to introd uce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences.  
8.3.3  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to p roactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and non -serious AEs of special interest 
(AESI) or adverse events of special monitoring (AESM) (as defined in Section  8.3.6  and 
Section  8.3.7 , respectively ), will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the Investigator 
determines that it is no longer clinically significant, the event is otherwise explained, or the 
participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section  7.3). Further information on follow -up 
procedures is given in Appendix 3 (Section  10.3). 
8.3.4  Regulatory reporting requirements for SAEs  
Prompt notification (24 hours) by the Investigator to the Sponsor of a SAE is essential so that 
legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a 
study treatment under clinical investigation are met.  
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relati ng to safety reporting to 
the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees 
(IEC) , and investigators.  
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to 
investigators as necessary.  
An Investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific 
safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Spon sor will review and then file it 
along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
8.3.5  Pregnancy  
Details of all pregnancies in female participants and, if indicated, female partners of male 
participants will be collected after the start of study treatment and until 90 days after the last 
dose.  
If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator must immediately inform the Sponsor within 24 hours 
of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in A ppendix 4 
(Section  10.4).

pregnancy test), and the foll owing should be completed:  
• The participant should return for an early discontinuation (PEOT) visit.  
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.  
8.3.6  Adverse events  of special interest  
An AESI is any AE that a regulatory authority has mandated be reported on an expedited basis, 
regardless of the seriousness, expectedness, or relatedness of the AE to the administration of a 
UCB product/compound. For rozanolixizumab, t he following events require immediate reporting 
(within 24 hours regardless of seriousness) to UCB:  
• Hy’s Law  
− Potential Hy’s Law, defined as >3xULN ALT or AST with coexisting >2xULN total 
bilirubin in the absence of <2xULN ALP, with no alternative explanati on for the 
biochemical abnormality (ie, without waiting for any additional etiologic investigations 
to have been concluded). Follow -up information should be reported if an alternative 
etiology is identified during investigation and monitoring of the partic ipant.  
All AESIs will follow the SAE recording and reporting procedures as indicated in Appendix 3 
(Section  10.3). 
8.3.7  Adverse events of special monitoring  
An AE of special monitoring (AESM) is a product -specific AE, adverse reaction, or safety topic 
requiring special monitoring by UCB.  
For rozanolixizumab, the following events require immediate reporting (within 24 hours 
regardless of seriousness) to UCB:  
• Severe and/or serious headache  
• Suspected aseptic meningitis  
Procedures for the management of AESM are provided in Appendix 14 (Section  10.14 ).  
Althou gh infections and infusion -related reactions as well as hypersensitivity reactions or 
anaphylaxis are not classified as AESM, these AEs will be monitored by the Investigator. If such 
an event is suspected it should be managed according to the guidance prov ided in Appendix 13  
(Section  10.13 ). In case of suspected anaphylaxis, the Sampson’s Criteria (Sampson et al, 2006) 
in Appendix 15 ( Section  10.15 ) should be completed.  
All AESM will follow the SAE recording and reporting procedures as indicated in Appendix 3 
(Section  10.3). 
8.3.8  Treatment -emergent adverse events  
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as AEs starting after the time of first IMP administration up 
to and includi ng 8 weeks after the final dose.

Confidential  Page 70 of 140 8.4 Safety signal detection  
Selected data from this study will be reviewed periodically to detect as early as possible any 
safety concern(s) related to the study medication so that investigators, clinical study participants, 
regulatory authorities, and IRBs/IECs will be informed appropriately and as early as possible.  
In addition, an IDMC will periodically review and monitor safety data from this study and advise 
UCB. Details are provided in the IDMC Charter.  
The Study Physician  or medically qualified designee/equivalent will conduct an ongoing review 
of SAEs and perform ongoing SAE reconciliations in collaboration with the Patient Safety 
representative.  
As appropriate for the stage of development and accumulated experience with the study 
medication, medically qualified personnel at UCB may identify additional safety measures 
(eg, AEs, vital signs, laboratory or ECG results) for which data will be periodically reviewed 
during the course of the study.  
8.5 Treatment of overdose  
For this  study, any dose of increase of 10% greater than the assigned dose for each administered 
dose of IMP will be considered an overdose, irrespective of the weight tier band.  Overdose 
events are only considered AEs or SAEs if there are associated clinical sign s and symptoms or if 
the act of taking the excess IMP itself is an AE or SAE (eg, suicide attempt).  
UCB does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose . 
In the event of an overdose, the Investigator or treating Physician should:  
1. Contact the Medical Monitor immediately.  
2. Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities for at least 5 
days.  
3. Obtain a plasma sample for PK analysis within 3 days from the date of the last dose of study 
treatment if requested by the Medical Monitor  (determined on a case -by-case basis).  
4. Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose in the 
eCRF.  
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the Investigator in 
consultation with  the Medical M onitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant.  
8.6 Pharmacokinetics and antidrug antibodies  
Whole blood samples will be collected for measurement of plasma concentrations of 
rozanolixizumab and ADA as specified in the Schedule of Activities  (Secti on 1.3). Blood 
samples may be collected at additional time points during the study if warranted and agreed upon 
between the Investigator and the Spo nsor. Instructions for the collection and handling of 
biological samples will be provided in the laboratory manual for this study. The actual date and 
time (24 -hour clock time) of each sample will be recorded.  
Samples will be used to evaluate the PK of roz anolixizumab and ADA and may be used for 
establishing assay parameters (eg, ADA cut point setting and PK selectivity assessment).

after the onset of the event  in case of AESM of severe and/or serious headache or suspected 
aseptic meningitis.  
If not used immediately, these samples will be stored at -80°C for up to 20 years for later 
exploratory an alyses. Any exploratory biomarker will only ever be related to the exploration of 
cause, progression, and appropriate treatment of MG. They may also be used to develop 
tests/assays including diagnostic tests related to rozanolixizumab and/or FcRn inhibitor  and MG.  
The nature and format of these tentative additional analyses will be determined at a later time.

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
A description of statistical methods follows and will be described in more detail in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).  
9.1 Definition of analysis sets  
The definition of analyses sets are as follows:  
• The Enrolled Set: All study participants who have signed the ICF.  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS): All enrolled study participants who were randomized in this study 
or in MG0004. Study participants enrolling from MG0004 will utilize their last assigne d dose 
level from MG0004 as their planned dose in MG0007.  
• Safety Set (SS): All study participants  in the FAS who received at least one dose of IMP.  
9.2 General statistical considerations  
Statistical evaluation will be performed by the Sponsor or designee and s upervised by the 
Exploratory Statistics Department of UCB. For safety analyses, data will be summarized by dose 
levels of rozanolixizumab at the time of the event or measurement. For efficacy, data will be 
summarized by the dose first received in the study . Additionally, efficacy data will be 
summarized by dose levels of rozanolixizumab received in each treatment cycle.  
All analyses will be performed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS®) version 9.3 or later 
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Continuous var iables will be summarized by visit (where 
applicable) with the statistics including the number of study participants (n), mean, standard 
deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized by 
visit (where applicable) with  frequency counts and percentages.  
If not otherwise stated, Baseline values will be the last available predose value, or in the case of 
analyses done by 6 -week treatment cycle, Baseline will be defined as the Baseline (Day 1) value 
for that cycle. This wil l be clearly defined in the SAP. All relevant data will be listed by 
treatment group and study participant.

Confidential  Page 73 of 140 9.2.1  Intercurrent event handling rationale and impact on the study  
In MG0007, every study participant, except those coming from MG0004, will start with an initial 
fixed mandatory cycle. Prior to dosing in the initial fixed treatment cycle, the study participant 
will be assessed for MG worsening (eg, an increase of 2.0 points on the MG -ADL or 3.0 points 
on the QMG scale). The study participant will be init ially randomized to rozanolixizumab 
equivalent to approximately 7mg/kg or 10mg/kg weekly (QW). After the first treatment cycle, 
dose adjustments may be applied at the start of each treatment cycle based on Investigator's 
discretion. Dose adjustments may no t be applied during a treatment cycle.  
For the assessment of safety and tolerability, adverse events (AEs) recorded up to 8 weeks after 
the last sc infusion will be utilized for main analyses, regardless of study participants receiving 
treatment with rescu e therapy.  
For the analyses of efficacy endpoints, the intercurrent events to be considered are the use of 
rescue therapy prior to Day 43 and permanent treatment discontinuation (or withdrawal from 
study) due to TEAEs. Efficacy endpoints will be summarized  in line with a treatment policy 
approach. With this approach, rozanolixizumab results will be analyzed regardless of study 
participants receiving treatment with rescue therapy. Summaries will also be presented for the 
efficacy endpoints where participants  will be censored at the time that they take rescue 
medication.  
Missing values will not be imputed.  
9.3 Planned safety analyses  
9.3.1  Analysis of the primary safety endpoint  
The frequency and severity of all TEAEs will be presented for each treatment group separatel y 
and overall by System Organ Class, high level term, and preferred term (Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities [MedDRA®]). The data will be displayed as number of participants 
experiencing the TEAE, percentage of participants, and number of TEAEs. All safety analyses 
will be based on the SS (Section  9.1). 
For each cycle, a TEAE is defined as any event that was not present prior to the first 
administration of rozanolixizumab or any unresolved event already present before the first 
administration of rozanolixizumab that worsens in intensity following exposure to treatment up 
to and including 8 weeks after the last dose of each treatment cycle. Adverse events occurring 
after the 8 -week TEAE period, prior to the next cycle, will be defined as intermittent period AEs. 
Any AEs that occurred during the study will be defined as “any AE”.  
The occurrence of TEAEs and TEAEs leading to withdrawal of IMP w ill be summarized for the 
entire study by dose at AE onset. This will include all TEAEs that occurred during and between 
treatment cycles.  
These analyses will display the TEAEs (including any TEAEs occurring up to 1 week after the 
last infusion) and intermittent period AEs separately. For intermittent period AEs, the summaries 
will be displayed as “Off -treatment”.  
Further analyses will be described in the SAP.

Laboratory evaluations and vital signs as well as ECG data will be analyzed over time. All safety 
analyses will be listed and summarized for the SS . 
9.4 Planned efficacy and other an alyses  
9.4.1  Efficacy analyses  
The main efficacy endpoint is the "Change from Baseline (Day 1) to Day 43 in MG -ADL score," 
for each of the first three 6 -week treatment cycles where the Baseline of the respective cycle will 
be used as reference.  
The summaries wil l be provided overall and by randomized treatment in -line with a treatment 
policy approach. Observed results will be presented for the different cycles (1 to n) regardless of 
the first cycle being mandatory or not. Missing values will not be imputed. Furth er summaries 
will be presented by the treatment received in each cycle.  
The other secondary efficacy endpoints, Change from Baseline (Day 1) to Day 43 in QMG score, 
Change from Baseline (Day 1) to Day 43 in MG -C score, Change from Baseline (Day 1) to Day 
43 in MG Symptoms PRO ‘Muscle Weakness Fatigability’ score, Change from Baseline (Day 1) 
to Day 43 in MG Symptoms PRO ‘Physical Fatigue’ score, and Change from Baseline (Day 1) to 
Day 43 in MG Symptoms PRO ‘Bulbar symptoms’ score, will be analyzed in the sa me way as 
the main secondary endpoint based on the MG -ADL.  
Time to MG -ADL response (≥2.0 -point improvement from Baseline [Day 1]) for each treatment 
cycle will be summarized using time -to-event methodology (Kaplan Meier).  
The time between consecutive trea tment cycles will be summarized in order to provide 
information on how long the effect of rozanolixizumab lasts, ie, how long it will take to 
introduce a new cycle.  
The number and percentage of participants achieving Minimal Symptom Expression (MG -ADL 
score of 0 or 1) at any time during the Treatment and Observation Periods will be summarized by 
cycle and by dose administration in that cycle.  
Additionally, the number of treatment cycles will be summarized by treatment group.  
Further summaries will be descr ibed in the SAP.

Plasma concentration data of rozanolixizumab will be summarized by dose arm for each cycle, 
and time point using the number of available observations, mean, median, SD, minimum, 
maximum, geometric m ean (and associated 95% confidence intervals), and geometric coefficient 
of variation (assuming log -normally distributed data) for the SS. Values below the lower limit of

and the measurements of study participants, which have been excluded from the summary tables. 
In cases where a study participant drops out, no mis sing value imputation will be performed for 
the IgG. Absolute and relative IgG reduction for a cycle will be calculated with the cycle 
Baseline value as reference. As for safety, the IgG reduction analyses will be compared between 
cycles.  
Population PD or population PK/PD analyses may be conducted for the PD variables of interest. 
Details of such PD or PK/PD analyses will be described in a separate DAP. The results of the 
analyses will not be reported in the CSR but in a separate report.  
9.4.2.3  Immunological analy ses 
For all endpoints relating to immunological assessments, descriptive statistics for the value, 
change from Baseline, and percentage change from Baseline will be tabulated by dose arm, and 
time point for the SS. The immunological assessments will includ e  
 Baseline values from 
MG0003 will serve as the Baseline value for MG0007.  
For complement where data has been collected post adverse event, individual patient data ma y 
be correlated with infusion reaction or hypersensitivity reaction.   
9.4.2.4  Anti-drug antibodies analyses  
Samples will first be evaluated in the screening assay using a false positivity rate of 5% (reported 
as negative screen or positive screen), followed by analysis of screened positive samples in the 
confirmatory assay (which is a drug depletion assay) to confirm the true positivity of the samples 
(reported as negative immunodepletion or positive immunodepletion). Samples that are 
confirmed as positive will be evaluated in a titration assay to quantify the ADA level and will be 
reported as titer (reciprocal dilution factor including minimum required dilution). For ADA -
positive immunodepletion samples (or subset of), further characterization for neutralizing A DA 
potential in vitro will be performed.

incidence and emergency of  ADA positivity. Graphical summaries may also be presented. 
Associations between ADA and PK, PD, efficacy and safety endpoints may be explored if 
warranted. Full details will be provided in the SAP.  
9.5 Handling of protocol deviations  
Important protocol deviat ions are identified as part of the data cleaning process in the Data 
Cleaning Plan (DCP). Ongoing data cleaning meetings will be held throughout the duration of 
the study. Objectives of these meetings include to review and update (if necessary) the importa nt 
protocol deviations in the DCP. Furthermore, overall trends in protocol deviations will be 
discussed at the Data Evaluation Meeting. Through this ongoing data cleaning and evaluation 
process, all decisions regarding important protocol deviations are mad e on an ongoing basis.  
9.6 Handling of dropouts or missing data  
All imputation of missing or partial dates for safety assessments, as well as handling missing 
efficacy data (where applicable), will be detailed in the SAP.  
9.7 Planned interim analysis and data moni toring  
No formal interim analysis is planned for this study.  
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be established. The IDMC will 
oversee the safety of the study by reviewing safety and efficacy data at periodic data reviews to 
assess the ben efit-risk of rozanolixizumab. The objectives and procedures for the IDMC will be 
detailed in the IDMC Charter.  
In addition, based on data cutoffs, safety and efficacy data for submission purposes will be 
summarized.  
9.8 Determination of sample size  
No formal s ample size calculation can be performed. All eligible study participants from 
MG0003, and MG0004 will be invited to participate in MG0007. It will be assumed that 
approximately 200 study participants will be enrolled into MG0007.  
The number of 200 study p articipants is assuming a drop -out rate from the lead -in study of 
approximately 15% (including participants who opt not to continue in MG0007).

CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Appendix 1: Regulatory, ethical, and study oversight 
considerations  
10.1.1  Regulatory and ethical considerations  
The study will be conducted under the auspices of an IRB/IEC, as defined in local regulations, 
ICH-GCP, and in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration 
of Helsinki.  
The Investigator/UCB will ensure that an appropriately constituted IRB/IEC that complies with 
the requirements of the current ICH -GCP version or applicable country -specific regulations will 
be responsible for the initial and continuing review and approval o f the clinical study. Prior to 
initiation of the study, the Investigator/UCB will forward copies of the protocol, ICF, IB, 
Investigator’s curriculum vitae (if applicable), advertisement (if applicable), and all other 
participant -related documents to be use d for the study to the IRB/IEC for its review and 
approval.  
Before initiating a study, the Investigator will have written and dated full approval from the 
responsible IRB/IEC for the protocol.  
The Investigator will also promptly report to the IRB/IEC all c hanges in the study, all 
unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others, and any protocol deviations, to 
eliminate immediate hazards to participants.  
The Investigator will not make any changes in the study or study conduct without IRB/IEC  
approval, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the participants. 
For minor changes to a previously approved protocol during the period covered by the original 
approval, it may be possible for the Investigator to obtain an expe dited review by the IRB/IEC as 
allowed.  
As part of the IRB/IEC requirements for continuing review of approved studies, the Investigator 
will be responsible for submitting periodic progress reports to the IRB/IEC (based on IRB/IEC 
requirements), at interval s appropriate to the degree of participant risk involved, but no less than 
once per year. The Investigator should provide a final report to the IRB/IEC following study 
completion.  
UCB (or its representative) will communicate safety information to the appro priate regulatory 
authorities and all active investigators in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. 
The appropriate IRB/IEC will also be informed by the Investigator or the Sponsor, as specified 
by the applicable regulatory requirements in ea ch concerned country. Where applicable, 
Investigators are to provide the Sponsor (or its representative) with evidence of such IRB/IEC 
notification.

Participant’s informed consent must be obtained and documented in accordance with local 
regulations, ICH -GCP requirements, and the ethical principles that have their origin in the 
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.  
Prior to obtaining informed consent, information should be given in a language and at a level of 
complexity understandable to the participant in both oral and written form by the Investiga tor (or 
designee). Each participant will have the opportunity to discuss the study and its alternatives 
with the Investigator.  
Prior to participation in the study, the Informed Consent form should be signed and personally 
dated by the participant, or his/her legal representative, and by the person who conducted the 
informed consent discussion (Investigator or designee). The participant or his/her legal 
representative must receive a copy of the signed and dated Informed Consent form. As part of 
the cons ent process, each participant must consent to direct access to his/her medical records for 
study -related monitoring, auditing, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory inspection. For local 
regulations, see Appendix 8 (Section  10.8). 
If the Informed Consent form is amended during the study, the Investigator (or the Sponsor, if 
applicable) must follow all applicable regulatory requirements pertaining to the approval of the 
amended Informed Consent form by the IRB/IEC and use of the amended form.  
All studies conducted at centers in the United States must include the use of a Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act Authorization form.  
The participan t may withdraw his/her consent to participate in the study at any time. A 
participant is considered as enrolled in the study when he/she has signed the Informed Consent 
form. A CRF must not be started, nor may any study specific procedure be performed for a given 
participant, without having obtained his/her written consent to participate in the study.  
10.1.4  Data protection  
UCB staff (or designee) will affirm and uphold the participant’s confidentiality. Throughout this 
study, all data forwarded to UCB (or designe e) will be identified only by the participant number 
assigned at Screening.

organization, and have no conflict of interest related to the conduct or the  outcomes of the study.  
10.1.6  Data quality assurance  
All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on printed or electronic CRF unless 
transmitted to the Sponsor or designee electronically (eg, laboratory data). The Investigator is 
responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by physically or electronically 
signing the CRF.  
The Investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the 
information entered in the CRF.  
The Investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory 
agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents.  
The Sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study including quality 
checking of the data.  
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification, encompassing remote source data 
verification and source data review in accordance with applicable regulatory guidance. Source 
data verification is performed to confirm that data entered into the CRF b y authorized site 
personnel are accurate, legible, contemporaneous, original, and attributable from source 
documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that the study is 
being conducted in accordance with the currently app roved protocol and any other study 
agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements, including national and local 
regulations.  
All essential documents must be retained by the Investigator for the minimum retention period 
mandatory under the  applicable local laws and regulations. The Investigator will contact UCB 
for authorization prior to the destruction of any study records or in the event of accidental loss or 
destruction of any study records. The Investigator will also notify UCB should h e/she relocate or 
move the study -related files to a location other than that specified in the Sponsor’s trial master 
file. 
Quality tolerance limits will be established for the study using parameters related to patient 
safety reporting and reliability of st udy results. The parameters will be monitored throughout the 
study to identify systematic issues. Parameters used, parameter values, important deviations from 
the quality tolerance limits, and actions taken will be summarized in the clinical study report.

Confidential  Page 84 of 140 10.3 Appendix 3: Adverse Events – Definitions and Procedures for 
Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting  
Definition of AE  
AE Definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, 
temporally associated with the use of study medication, whether or not considered related 
to the study medication.  
• NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laborator y finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of study medication.  
 
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical 
and scientific judgment of the Investigator (ie, not related to progression of underlying 
disea se). 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study medication administration even though 
it may have been prese nt before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
medication or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will  not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming 
intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.  
• "Lack of efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will no t be 
reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. 
However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy 
will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE.  
• The signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be 
reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE. Also, "lack of 
efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" also constitutes an AE or SAE.  
 
Events NOT  Meeting the AE Definition  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the 
Investigator to be more severe than expected f or the participant’s condition.  
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the study 
participant’s condition.

Confidential  Page 85 of 140 • Medical or surgical procedure (eg,  endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing diseas e(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
Definition of SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to 
progression of disease).  
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening  
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in wh ich the participant 
was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically 
might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
c. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at 
least an overnight stay) at the hospital  or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that 
would not have been appropriate in the Physician’s office or  outpatient setting. Complications 
that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills 
any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” 
occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.  
d. Results in persistent disability/incapacity  
• The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions.  
• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
f. Important medical events:  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding  whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
participant or may require medical or surgical intervention  to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered 
serious.  
• Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, potential Hy’s law, invasive or 
malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an e mergency room or at home for allergic

development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Recording and Follow -Up of AE and/or SAE  
AE and SAE Recording  
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event.  
• The Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF.  
• It is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s 
medical records to UCB in lieu of completion of the UCB AE/SAE eCRF page.  
• There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by 
UCB. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, 
will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to UCB.  
• The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
sympto ms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
Assessment of Intensity  
The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study and assign it to 1 of the following categories:   
• Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and 
not interfering with everyday activities.  
• Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday 
activities.  
• Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with a SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the 
intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  
• An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe (eg, a severe AE 
may be either serious or not serious, depending o n whether these criteria are also met).  
The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE) 
should be used as a supportive standardization instrument to evaluate AEs and SAEs but the final 
intensity grading by the Inves tigator must be mild, moderate, or severe.  
 
Assessment of Causality  
• The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study medication and 
each occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
• A "reasonable possibility" of a relationship conveys that there are  facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.  
• The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.

Confidential  Page 87 of 140 • Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant t herapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study medication 
administration will be considered and investigated.  
• The Investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for ma rketed products, in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the Investigator must  document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the Inves tigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to UCB. However, it is very important that 
the Investigator  always make an assessment of causality for every event before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to UCB.  
• The Investigator may  change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up 
information and send a SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.  
 
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
• The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by UCB to 
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.  
• An AE should be followed until it has resolved, has a stable sequelae, the Investigator 
determin es that it is no longer clinically significant, the event is otherwise explained, or 
the participant is lost to follow up. This follow -up requirement applies to AEs, SAEs, and 
AEs of special interest.  
• If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up 
period, the Investigator will provide UCB with a copy of any post -mortem findings 
including histopathology.  
• New or updated information will be recorded in the original ly completed CRF.  
• The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.  
Reporting of SAEs  
SAE Reporting to UCB via an Electronic Data Collection Tool  
• The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to UCB will be the electronic data 
collection tool.  
• If the electronic system is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use the 
paper SAE data collection tool (see next section).  
• The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as so on as it becomes 
available.  
• After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be 
taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.

SAE Reporting to UCB via Paper CRF  
• Facsimile transmission of the SAE paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this 
information to UCB . 
• In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by 
telephone is acceptable with a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight 
mail or courier service.

Pregnancy Information  
Definitions  
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below).  
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP : 
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
− Documented hysterectomy  
− Documented bilatera l salpingectomy  
− Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
3. Postmenopausal female  
− A postmenopausal state is define d as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal 
range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement t herapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 
months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
− Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of 
the non -estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to 
continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.  
Contraception Guidance  
Female participants  
Female participants of childbearing potenti al are eligible to participate if they agree to use a 
highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly as described in the table 
below.

• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterin e hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
Vasectomized partner  
A vasectomy is a highly effective contraception method provided that the vasectomized partner is the sole 
male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been c onfirmed. If not, an additional 
highly effective method of contraception should be used (eg, proper use of condom in combination with 
spermicide)  
Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study medication. The reliability of sexual 
abstinence needs to be evaluated in relat ion to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the participant.  
NOTES:  
a) In case of newly started contraception pills/IUDs, the investigator should consider the correct timing of 
starting/applying such methods in relation to the menstrual cycle and the manufacturing instruction as 
when these newly started methods would become effective.  
b) Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be 
consistent with local regulations regar ding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating 
in clinical studies.  
c) Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study medication, which may 
reduce the efficacy of the contraceptive method. In this case, two h ighly effective methods of 
contraception should be utilized during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of 
study medication  
Pregnancy testing  
• WOCBP should only be included after a confirmed menstrual period and a negative highly 
sensitive urine pregnancy test.  
• Additional pregnancy testing should be performed during the Treatment Period ( Section  1.3), 
at the EOS visit, corresponding to protocol -defined time frame in Section  10.4 after the last 
dose of study medication and as required locally . 
• Pregnancy testing will be performed whenever a menstrual cycle is missed or when 
pregnancy is otherwise suspected  
• Pregnancy testing, with a sensitivity of ≥25mIU/mL will be performed. Urine pre gnancy tests 
will be performed at all other visits.

female partner who becomes pregnant while the male participant is in this study. This applies 
only to male participants who receive study medication . If the study participant is later found 
to be on placebo, then pregnancy data collection can stop.  
• After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnan t female partner 
directly, the Investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and 
submit it to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. The female 
partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the 
status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, the follow -up will 
be at least 12 months after the delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be 
reported regardless of fetal status (pr esence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the 
procedure.  
Female Participants who become pregnant  
• Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will be 
withdrawn from the study .  
• The Investigator will collect pregnancy  information on any female participant who becomes 
pregnant while participating in this study. Information will be recorded on the appropriate 
form and submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of a participant's pregnancy. 
The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The Investigator 
will collect follow -up information on the participant and the neonate and the information will 
be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, the follow -up will be at least 12 months after th e 
delivery date. Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status 
(presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
electi ve termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous 
abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. Any post -study 
pregnancy related SAE considered reasonably related to the study medication by the 
Investi gator will be reported to the Sponsor as described in Section  8.3.5 . While the 
Investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in for mer study participants, he 
or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.

Assessments  
Participants with potential drug -induced liver injury must be assessed to determine if study 
medication must be discontinued. In addition, all concomitant medications and herbal 
supplements that are not medically necessary should also be discontinued.  
Investigators should attempt to obtain information on study partic ipants in the case of study 
medication disconintuation to complete the final evaluation.  
Study participants with potential drug -induced liver injury should not be withdrawn from the 
study until investigation and monitoring are complete. All results of the se evaluations and 
observations, as well as the reason(s) for study medication discontinuation and/or participant 
withdrawal (if applicable), must be recorded in the source documents. The CRF must document 
the primary reason for discontinuation of study me dication.  
A specific monitoring plan must be agreed between the UCB Study Physician and the 
Investigator for study participants who have ALT >5 ULN. The monitoring plan should include 
any necessary follow -up assessments (until resolution of the abnormal l ab values).  
Phase 3 -4 liver chemistry stopping criteria are designed to assure participant safety and to 
evaluate liver event etiology.

will be obtained from both the participant and the legal representative.  
• In reference to Section  5.3, the use of medicinal cannabidiols and medicinal marijuana are 
prohibited by law.  
• In reference to Section  8.2.6 , TB assessment by IGRA; the prefer red screening test is IGRA 
performed at a Central Laboratory by QuantiFERON tube test, or using a T -SPOT.TB test  
at each site . 
• The country -specific requirements for Japan align ed with J apan  GCP will be provided 
separately in Protocol Exhibit.  
For medical d evices used, locally approved devices are to be used during the study. If a pump 
and infusion set are used that are regarded in Japan as investigational devices, then additional 
adherence to specific reporting obligations will be required. All adverse devi ce effects (ADEs), 
serious adverse device effects (SADEs), and medical device deficiency (including malfunction 
use error, and inadequate labeling) of these investigational devices shall be documented and 
reported by the Investigator throughout the study a nd appropriately managed by the Sponsor.  
This reporting requirement is not applicable for locally approved devices for the purpose of sc 
infusions or other purposes in the course of this study, regardless if provided by the sponsor or 
not. 
Furthermore, specific rules for repetition of an ADE and device deficiency should be followed 
by all study sites in Japan; this requirement is not applicable for locally approved devices, 
regardless if provided by the sponsor or not.   
For ADEs and/or devic e deficiencies that are not related to the natural course of the disease 
under study, an increase in the intensity of the original ADE, and/or device deficiency should 
lead to the repetition of the original ADE and/or device deficiency with the following g uidelines:  
• The outcome date of the original ADE and/or device deficiency must be the same as the start 
date of the repeated ADE and/or device deficiency.  
• The outcome of the original ADE and/or device deficiency must be recorded as “worsening.”  
• The verbatim  term for the repeated ADE and/or device deficiency must be the same as the 
verbatim term for the original ADE and/or device deficiency so that the repeated ADE and/or 
device deficiency is obviously a worsening of the original.  
As per local requirements in  Japan, SAEs associated to an investigational device, and device 
deficiencies (eg, infusion pump product provided from Sponsor) should be reported in 
accordance with the following:

Definition of AE and ADE  
AE and ADE Definition  
• An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or 
untoward clinical signs (including abnorma l laboratory finding) in study participants, users, or 
other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device. This definition 
includes events related to the investigational medical device or comparator and events related 
to the proced ures involved except for events in users or other persons, which only include 
events related to investigational devices.  
• An adverse device effect (ADE) is defined as an adverse event related to the use of an 
investigational medical device. This definition includes any adverse events resulting from 
insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or 
operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device as well as any event 
resulting from use error or from  intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.  
Definition of SAE, SADE and USADE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met (e.g., hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the diseas e under study, death due to 
progression of disease).  
An SAE is an AE that:  
a. Led to death  
b. Led to serious deterioration in the health of the participant, that either resulted in:  
1. A life -threatening illness or injury. The term ‘life -threatening' in the definition of serious' refers to 
an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe  
2. A permanent impairment of a body structure  or a body function,  
3. Inpatient or prolonged hospitalization, Planned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition, or a 
procedure required by the protocol, without serious deterioration in health, is not considered an 
SAE

SADE definition  
• A SADE is defined as an adverse device effect that  has resulted in any of the consequences 
characteristic of a serious adverse event.  
USADE definition  
• A USADE is a serious adverse device effect which by its nature, incidence, severity, or 
outcome has not been identified in the current version of the risk analysis report (see 
Section  8.3.8 ). 
Definition of Device Deficiency  
Device Deficiency definition  
• A device deficiency is an inadequacy of a medica l device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety, or performance. Device deficiencies include malfunctions, use 
errors, and inadequate labeling.  
Recording and Follow -Up of AE and/or SAE and Device Deficiencies  
AE, SAE and De vice Deficiency Recording  
• When an AE/SAE/device deficiency occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review 
all documentation (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event.  
• The Investigator  will then record all relevant AE/SAE/device deficiency information in the 
participant’s medical records, in accordance with the Investigator’s normal clinical practice 
and on the appropriate form of the CRF.  
• It is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical records 
to UCB in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE/device deficiency CRF page.  
• There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by 
UCB. I n this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will 
be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to UCB.  
• The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symp toms, 
and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual 
signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
• For device deficiencies, it is very important that the Investigator describes any corrective or 
remedial actions  taken to prevent recurrence of the deficiency  
o A remedial action is any action other than routine maintenance or servicing of a 
medical device where such action is necessary to prevent recurrence of a device 
deficiency. This includes any amendment to the d evice design to prevent recurrence. 
The Investigator should complete a Product Complaint Form for all reported device 
deficiencies.  
Assessment of Intensity  
The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE/SAE/device deficiency reported 
during the study and assign it to one of the following categories:

Confidential  Page 101 of 140 • Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with everyday activities.  
• Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday 
activities.  
• Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as severe 
should not be confuse d with a SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an 
event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  
• An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE , NOT when it is rated as severe.  
 
Assessment of Causality  
• The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE/device deficiency  
• A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.  
• The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), conc omitant therapy, and other risk factors, 
as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration will be 
considered and investigated.  
• The Investigator will also consult the IB  in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE/device def iciency, the Investigator must  document in the medical notes that 
he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE/device deficiency and has provided an assessment of 
causality.  
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the Investigator has minimal 
informatio n to include in the initial report to UCB. However, it is very important that the 
Investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to UCB.  
• The Investigator may change his/her opinion of cau sality in light of follow -up information and 
send a SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.  
 
Follow -up of AE/SAE/device deficiency  
• The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by UCB to elucidate 
the nature and/or causality of the AE/SAE/device deficiency as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.  
• If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up period,  
the Investigator will provide UCB with a copy of any post -mortem findings including 
histopathology.  
• New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF.

information.  
Reporting of SAEs  
SAE Reporting to UCB via an Electronic Data Collection Tool  
• The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to UCB will be the electronic data collection 
tool. 
• If the electronic system is unavailable, then the site  will use the paper SAE data collection tool 
(see next section) in order to report the event within 24 hours.  
• The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes available.  
• After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken off -
line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
• If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data on a 
previously reported SAE after the electroni c data collection tool has been taken off -line, then 
the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next section) or to the Medical 
Monitor/SAE coordinator  by telephone.  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in this protocol.  
 
SAE Reporti ng to UCB via Paper CRF  
• Facsimile transmission of the SAE paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this 
information to the UCB.  
• In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by telephone is 
acceptable with a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight mail or courier 
service.  
• Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the Investigator to complete and 
sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time frames.  
• Contacts for SAE r eporting can be found in this protocol . 
Reporting of SADEs  
SADE Reporting to UCB  
NOTE: There are additional reporting obligations for medical device deficiencies that are potentially 
related to SAEs that must fulfil the legal responsibility to notify app ropriate regulatory authorities and 
other entities about certain safety information relating to medical devices being used in clinical studies.  
• Any device deficiency that is associated with an SAE  must be reported to the Sponsor within 
24 hours after the Investigator determines that the event meets the definition of a device 
deficiency.  
• The Sponsor shall review all device deficiencies and determine and document in writing 
whether they could have le d to an SAE. These shall be reported to the regulatory authorities 
and IRBs/IECs as required by national regulations.  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in this protocol .

10.13.1  Management of infections and hypogammaglobulinemia  
Study participants who have signs or symptoms of  any infection should be monitored closely and 
managed according to local guidelines. This may include tests for specific organisms if clinically 
indicated.  
Study participants  MUST discontinue IMP AND move into the SFU Period if he/she develop 
a significan t infective episode including but not limited to bacteremia/sepsis, infectious 
meningitis, or septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, complicated pneumonia, or visceral abscess which 
may or may not result in hospitalization during a treatment period.  
If a signif icant infective episode is reported during observation period, the decision to start a new 
treatment cycle should be based on careful evaluation by the Principal Investigator of the 
Benefit -Risk for the individual study participant and provided a full reco very from infection, an 
acceptable level of total IgG (≥2g/L) and no other discontinuation criteria were met.  
To maintain the study integrity, IgG level will remain blinded to the study sites and the UCB 
study team for the first 4 weeks of the study. To en sure patient safety, serum IgG level will be 
monitored by an independent Medical Monitor external to UCB including signs and symptoms 
of infection and associated laboratory parameters. The IMP may be temporarily discontinued as 
requested by the independent  Medical Monitor when deemed appropriate.  
In the event of a non -serious infection, the Benefit -Risk of continuing treatment with IMP must 
be carefully evaluated by the Investigator in collaboration with the Medical Monitor. Treatment 
may be temporarily discontinued for the study participant who develops a non -serious persisting 
or recurrent infection with a serum total IgG level between ≥1g/L and <2g/L. Upon resolution of 
infection and the IgGs returning to the level of ≥2g/L, the study participant may b e allowed to 
resume treatment with the IMP. Ad hoc assessment can be performed to monitor the recovery of 
IgG levels.  
Treatment must be temporarily discontinued for the study participant who develops an event of 
hypogammaglobulinemia with a serum total IgG  of <1g/L irrespective of infection. When the 
IgG level reaches ≥2g/L, the study participant may be allowed to continue treatment with IMP.

to sc infusion complications. Suggested management guidelines for infusion -related reactions 
and anaphylaxis at the study site are provided in Table  10-3. Definitions of mild, moderate, and 
severe events will be consistent with CTCAE version 5.0 (Section  10.3).

Confidential  Page 136 of 140 10.14  Appendix 14: Management of adverse event of special 
monitoring  
Adverse events of special monitoring are defined as product -specific AEs, adverse reactions, or 
safety topics requiring special monitoring by one o r more regulatory authorities or by UCB.  
For rozanolixizumab, AESMs (defined by UCB) are:  
• Severe and/or serious headache  
• Suspected aseptic meningitis  
Occurrence of AESM require immediate reporting (within 24  hours regardless of seriousness) to 
UCB. Upon r eception of AESM by UCB a standard medical follow -up query (SMFQ) will be 
sent to the site to gather extensive medical information about the AESM. See Table  1-6 for 
additional assessments that may be required in case of AESM .  
Aseptic meningitis (suspected)  
Drug -induced aseptic meningitis is a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out infectious causes 
(Jolles et al, 2000 ). A few cases of aseptic meningitis (drug -induced) have been reported in the 
rozanolixizumab  program. Consequently, aseptic meningitis (suspected) is being managed as an 
AESM ( see Section  8.3.7 ).  
Participants should be monitored for signs and symptoms suggestive of  central nervous system  
(CNS ) involvement and evaluated immediately if meningitis is suspected. A full neurological 
workup should be strongly considered including, but not limited to imaging , eg, computed 
tomography (CT) scan, or preferably gadolinium -enhanced magnetic resonance imagi ng (MRI), 
a lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis inclusive of glucose, protein, 
differential  complete blood count  (CBC) , cultures, gram stain, and/or viral polymerase chain 
reactions (PCRs) as appropriate. Whenever  possible , CSF should b e stored  for assessment  of 
rozanolixizumab PK , PD, specific antibody titers , or other biomarkers. A concurrent blood 
sample should be collected as per local practice. The ultimate investigative procedures are at the 
discretion of the Investigator or the tr eating physician. For studies where a neurologist is not the 
Investigator, a neurological consultation is also recommended to aid in decision making and 
patient management. In addition, blood samples for exploratory safety biomarkers 
(see Section  8.9) should be collected for participants with a diagnosis of DIAM preferably within 
72 hours after onset of symptoms . These investigations will be performed  to further understand 
the potential mechanisms of DIAM in the participants.  
All procedures related to the diagnosis, treatment , and investigation of meningitis should be 
recorded in the eCRF , and preliminary data should be included on the SAE form used for 
reporting the event as an AESM within 24 hours (ie, preliminary data reported on the first 
reporting may not have CSF results yet , but the reporting should occur as soon as there is a 
suspec ted diagnosis. Full results should be communicated in subsequent exchanges with the 
sponsor).  
Treatment must be temporarily held if a participant has a diagnosis of suspected meningitis of 
any cause until the diagnostic workup is complete. Based on CSF fi ndings, negative cultures, 
absence of other disease causes, and relationship with IMP , a diagnosis of DIAM can be made. If 
deemed appropriate by the Investigator and agreed upon by the participant and the Sponsor, the

Confidential  Page 137 of 140 study treatment can resume upon the co mplete resolution of symptoms. The benefit and risk of 
the treatment should be carefully considered prior to reinitiating the IMP. If a participant 
experiences a second episode of similar symptoms suggestive of DIAM, then the participant 
must permanently discontinue the IMP.  
Participants experiencing an event of DIAM should be strongly encouraged to remain in the 
study regardless of IMP discontinuation. This will allow for monitoring and follow -up of the 
participant including a complete neurological exam on  subsequent physical examinations. 
Longer term follow -up on any AEs related to DIAM that are ongoing may be warranted until 
resolution.  
Associated symptoms with aseptic meningitis should be managed at the Investigator’s discretion.  
Severe and/or serious headache  
Based on current available clinical data, headache is the most commonly reported ADR in study 
participants treated with rozanolixizumab. Study participants should be well informed of this 
potential ADR and should be instructed on how to manage it.  
Determination of the severity of headache will be consistent with National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Severe headache is 
defined as severe pain limiting self-care activities of daily living (ADL). Self-care ADL refers to 
bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, and taking medications.  
In the event of a headache, the Investigators should take the medical history of previous 
headaches, concomitant medication, and co -morbiditie s (eg, asthma) in consideration.  
If the severe and/or serious headache is initially reported at a home visit or during a telephone 
call, the study participant should be evaluated by a healthcare professional as soon as possible for 
further investigations. Study participants should be monitored for signs and symptoms suggestive 
of CNS involvement and evaluated immediately if other causes (eg, meningitis, intracranial 
bleeding) are suspected (please see Section  1.3.1  [Table  1-6]). In addition, samples for 
exploratory safety biomarkers should be collected for study participants experiencing severe or 
serious headache when possible. These investigations will be perfor med to further understand the 
mechanism of headaches in the study participants.  
If deemed appropriate by the Investigator and agreed upon by the study participant and the 
Sponsor, the study treatment can resume upon the resolution of the severe and/or seri ous 
headache event. The benefit and risk of the treatment should be carefully considered prior to 
reinitiating the IMP.  
Headaches will be treated as clinically indicated according to national guidelines. It is 
recommended that the study participants have a n analgesic available in case of headache with the 
instruction for frequency and dosage provided by a healthcare professional. The analgesic can be 
started at the early onset of headache. Study participants experiencing any treatment -related 
headache will be followed until resolution of the event.  
Prophylactic treatment of headaches may be permitted for study participants who have 
experienced previous episodes of treatment -related headache after discussion with the Medical 
Monitor. The benefit risk of conti nuing treatment with IMP and chronic prophylactic with 
analgesics must be carefully evaluated by the Investigator.

Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled (Sampson et al, 
2006):  
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips -tongue -uvula)  
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING  
a. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea,  wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expiratory flow [PEF], hypoxemia)  
b. Reduced blood pressure [BP] or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction (eg, 
hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly afte r exposure to a likely allergen for that 
patient (minutes to several hours):  
a. Involvement of the skin -mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen lips 
tongue -uvula)  
b. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PE F, 
hypoxemia)  
c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
d. Persistent GI symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)  
Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen for that subject (minutes to several 
hours): Systolic BP of less than 90mmHg or greater than 30% decrease from the subject’s 
Baseline systolic BP value.

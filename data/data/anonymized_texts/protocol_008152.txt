Title: A Study of Neratinib Plus Capecitabine Versus Lapatinib Plus Capecitabine in Patients With HER2 + 
Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Have Received Two or More Prior HER2 -Directed Regimens  in the Metastatic 
Setting (NALA)  
Condition or Disease: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive ( HER2+) metastatic breast cancer  
(MBC) 
Phase of Development  3 
Approximate Values  
Number of Patients 600 Duration of  Patient Participation  28 Months 
Number of Centers  200 Duration of Study  50 Months 
Objectives:  
Primary: The co-primary objective s of this study are  
 to compare independently  adjudicated  progression -free survival (PFS) following treatment with neratinib plus 
capecitabine versus lapatinib plus capecitabine in patients with HER2 -positive (HER2 +) MBC who have 
received two or more prior HER2-directed regimens in the metastatic setting . 
 to compare  overall survival ( OS) following treatment with neratinib plus capecitabine versus lapatinib plus 
capecitabine in this population . 
Secondary:  The secondary objectives of this study are  to compare between the two treatment groups :  
 Investigator -assessed PFS . 
 Objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR) and clinical benefit (CB R) (complete response 
[CR] or partial response [PR] or stable disease [SD ] ≥24 weeks).  
 Time to intervention for symptomatic metastatic central nervous system (CNS) disease.  
 Safety (adverse events [AEs], serious adverse events [SAEs]).  
 Health outcomes assessment s. 
Exploratory : 
The exploratory objective of this study is:  
 To assess the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of neratinib  when administered in combination with 
capecitabine . 
Study Design:  
This is a randomized, multi -center, multinational, open -label, active-controlled, parallel design  study of the 
combination of neratinib plus capecitabine versus the combination of lapatinib plus capecitabine in HER2+ MBC 
patients who have received two or more  prior HER2 -directed regimens in the metastatic setting . Patients will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following treatment arms:  
 Arm A: neratinib (240 mg  once daily) + capecitabine (1500 mg/m2 daily, 750  mg/m2 twice daily [ BID]) 
 Arm B: lapatinib (1250 mg  once daily) + capecitabine (2000 mg/m2 daily, 1000  mg/m2 BID) 
Patients will receive either  neratinib plus capecitabine combination or lapatinib plus capecitabine combination until 
the occurrence of death, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other specified withdrawal  criterion.  
Patient randomization will be stratified according to:  
 The number of previous HER2 -directed regimens in the metastatic setting  (N = 2 or N  ≥3).

 Visceral vs. non-visceral-only disease.  
 Estrogen receptor  + (ER+) and/or progesterone receptor ( PR+) (i.e., hormone receptor +) versus ER - and 
PR- (i.e., hormone receptor  -). 
Patients are anticipated to participate in the study for an average of 28 months. This includes approximately 
0.5 months for screening, an estimated average of 9.5 months for the active treatment phase, and an estimated 
average of 18 months for the long -term follow -up phase. Treatment is to be given for as long as tolerated and while 
there is no disease progression.  Patients who permanently discontinue  treatment will enter the long-term follow-up 
phase until death  or withdrawal of consent . 
Investigational Product, Dose and Administration:  
Neratinib + Capecitabine Combination:  
 Neratinib  dosing: six 40 mg tablets (total daily dose 240 mg) orally, once daily with food, preferably in the 
morning, continuously  in 21-day cycles, with no rest between cycles.  
 Capecitabine  dosing: 150 mg or 500 mg tablets (total dose of 1500 mg/m2 daily in 2 approximately evenly 
divided doses), orally with water within 30 minu tes after a meal. Dose s are to be  taken daily for Days 1 to 14 
of a 21-day cycle.  
Lapatinib + Capecitabine Combination:  
 Lapatinib  dosing: five 250 mg tablets (total dose 1250 mg) orally, once daily, 1 hour before or after breakfast, 
continuously  in 21-day cycles, with no rest between cycles . 
 Capecitabine  dosing: 150 mg or 500 mg tablets (total dose of 2000 mg/m2 daily, in 2 approximately evenly

Efficacy Assessm ents: 
There are 2 co -primary endpoints : independently adjudicated  PFS and OS. All patients randomized will be 
evaluated.  
 PFS is defined as disease progression (radiographic or other appropriate modality) or death due to any cause.  
o Efficacy assessment for PFS will be assessed by a blinded, independent, central review of tumor 
assessments for all patients at screening , and then after every 6 weeks from first dose of investigational 
product, regardless of treatment schedule modification (e.g. , dose delay), un til documented disease 
progression  or death due to any cause . Progressive disease ( PD) will be independent ly-assessed using 
RECIST v1.1. 
 Overall survival, defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause.  
o Survival data will be collected throughout the active treatment phase and during the long -term follow -up 
phase. Survival follow -up after patient discontinuation of investigational product will be conducted 
approximately every 12 weeks to assess for survival until patient death or withdrawal of consent . 
The secondary endpoints include:  
 Comparison of clinically relevant improvements in breast cancer patients with respect to radiographic 
changes or changes in other appropriate modalities , including  (see footnote *): 
o “Investigator -assessed” PFS, assessed by tumor assessments that  will occur for all patients at screening, 
and then after every 6  weeks from first dose of investigational product, regardless of treatment schedule 
modification (e.g., dose delay), until documented disease progression  or death due to any cause ; 
o Objective response rate , defined as the proportion of patients demonstrating either a CR or PR during the 
study; 
o Duration of response  is measured from the time at which response criteria were met for CR or PR 
(whichever status w as recorded first) until the first date of recurrence or  PD or death;  
o Clinical benefit  rate, defined as the proportion of patients who achieved overall tumor response (CR or 
PR) or SD for at least 24 weeks.  
 Time to intervention for  symptomatic metastatic CNS disease, defined as date of initiation of  intervention or 
therapy for symptomatic CNS disease determined by the investigator to be due to CNS metasta sis. This may 
include brain, leptomeningeal and epidural metastases including epidural spinal cord comp ression arising 
from tumor growth in the epidural space.  
 
* All of the secondary efficacy endpoints  including  CR, PR, and SD will be assessed by the investigator and by the independent 
review committee utilizing RECIST v1.1.

PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 7 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL Safety Assessments:  
Patients receiving at least 1 dose of investigational product will be evaluable for safety. Safety will be assessed 
based on medical history, vital sign measurements, physical examination findings, electrocardiogram ( ECG) results, 
MUGA or ECHO and laboratory assessments. Adverse event s will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v.4.0. 
AEs and SAEs will be reported until 28  days after the last dose of investigational product(s) and will be followed 
until resolution or until condition stabilizes. Should an Investigator be made aware of any SAE occurring any time 
after the reporting period, it must be promptly reported.  
Other Assessments:  
Pharmacokinetics :  
A population PK study with sparse sampling will be included in the st udy to assess the variability of neratinib 
concentration when administered in combination with capecitabine  among individuals in the target patient 
population.  At selected study centers, PK samples will be collected from approximately 100  patients in the n eratinib 
plus capecitabine arm (Arm A) at Cycle 1, on Days  1 and 15. 
Health Outcomes Assessment:  
The following health outcomes assessments will be completed by patients : 
 European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire -C30 (EORTC 
QLQ-C30), version 3  
 EORTC QLQ -BR23 (breast cancer -specific questionnaire)  
 The EuroQol (EQ -5D-5L) multi-dimensional health status questionnaire  
Health outcomes assessments will be performed at screening , every 6 weeks during the active treatment period  and 
at treatment discontinuation . 
Criteria for Patient Withdrawal:  
A patient must be discontinued from i nvestigational product (s) (IP) in the following circumstances : 
 if more than 2 dose reductions are required  (Appendix 2) 
 if IP is withheld >28 days due to AE  
 disease progression  
 initiation of alternative anti -cancer therapy , including chemotherapy, radiothera py, and cancer -related surgery 
 pregnancy  
 investigator or patient request  
A patient may withdraw from the entire study, including follow -up, at any time at the discretion of the investigator , 
at the patient’s request , if the patient is lost to follow-up, or if the study is terminated prematurely.  
Statistical Methods:  
The co-primary endpoint s are OS and  independently adjudicated  PFS, which will be determined by disease 
progression (disease progression demonstrated by radiographic imaging or other appropriate modality) or death 
due to any cause. Tumor evaluations for PD will be performed by a central review vendor.  
Secondary effic acy endpoints include  Investigator -assessed PFS,  ORR, DOR, and CBR (CR, PR or 
SD ≥24 weeks). Other secondary endpoints include  time to intervention for symptomatic CNS disease, AEs and 
SAEs, and health outcomes assessments.  
Sample Size:  
The co-primary endpoints will be analyzed using a n overall Type I error rate of 0.01 for PFS and 0.04 for OS. 
To detect a hazard ratio (control versus treatment) of 0. 70 with approximately 85% power, 419 PFS events 
(PD/deaths) are required to be observed; this assumes a median (intent -to-treat [ITT]) PFS of  8.0 months (34.7 
Neratinib Tablets (PB- 272) 13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 8 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL weeks) for the experimental arm (neratinib plus capecitabine) and 5.6 months (24.3 weeks) for the control arm 
(lapatinib plus capecitabine).  It is expected that the 419th event will be observed at approximately 26 months 
after the first subject is enrolled. At this time, an interim analysis on OS will also be performed. For the OS 
endpoint, a group sequential method will be employed to maintain the over all Type I error rate at 0.04. 
Specifically, O’ Brien-Fleming boundaries will be calculated to create appropriate critical values to which the 
log rank statistic will be compared.  To detect a hazard ratio (control versus treatment) of 0.725 with 
approximately 85% power, 37 8 events (deaths) are required to be observed ; this assumes a median ITT  OS of 
30.3 months for the experimental arm (nerat inib plus capecitabine) and 22.0  months for the control arm 
(lapatinib plus capecitabine). Approximately  600 patients will be enrolled and randomized equally between  the 
two treatment arms.  
Patients will be stratified according to whether they are hormone receptor positive or negative , the number of 
previous HER2 -directed regimens in the metastatic setting (N = 2 or N ≥3), their geographic region  (North 
America vs. E urope, including Israel vs. Rest of World) , and disease category (visceral vs. non -visceral only).  
Statistical Analysis:  
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the ITT population defined as all patients randomized into 
the study. Patients rece iving at least one dose of investigational product will be evaluable for safety.  
Efficacy 
When 419 PFS events have occurred the primary PFS analysis will be performed. The median time to PFS and 
corresponding two -sided 95% confidence intervals will be calculated using the product limit estimator and 
displayed using a Kaplan -Meier graph, by treatment group. A log -rank test stratified by hormone receptor 
status, number of prior  HER2-directed regimens in the metastatic setting , visceral disease, and geogra phic 
region will be used to test the null hypothesis of no difference in the time to PFS between the two treatment 
groups at the alpha level of 0.01. When 37 8 deaths have occurred, the primary OS analysis  (final analysis)  will 
be performed, using similar m ethods. A log -rank test controlling for hormone receptor status, number of prior 
HER2-directed regimens in the metastatic setting , visceral disease, and geographic region strata will be used to 
test the null hypothesis of no difference in the hazard betwee n the two treatment groups at the alpha level of 
0.038. 
The treatment difference in the secondary efficacy endpoints of ORR and CB R will be analyzed using a 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel (CMH) Chi -square test, stratified by  the hormone receptor status,  number of prior 
HER2-directed regimens in the metastatic setting , geographic region , and disease category (visceral vs. 
non-visceral only). The treatment difference in the secondary efficacy endpoints of DOR, and Investigator -
assessed PFS will be analyzed using a product limit estimate of the median time to event.  Differences between 
treatment groups will be examined using a log rank test  statistic stratified by hormone receptor status,  prior 
HER2-directed regimens in the metastatic setting , geographic region, and d isease category (v isceral vs. non 
visceral only) similar to the an alysis for the primary endpoint . All time-to-event endpoints , including time to 
intervention for symptomatic CNS disease,  will be displayed using Kaplan -Meier survival plot s. Health 
outcomes assessment s (EORTC QLQ -C30, EORTC QLQ -BR23 and EQ-5D-5L) will be analyzed using a 
random effects mixed model with treatment, time, number of prior  HER2-directed regimens in the metastatic 
setting (binary), geographic region, site of metastases , and the treatment by time interaction.    
Subjects who discontinue therapy early will be censored at their last available time point. Sensitivity analyses 
will be performed to investigate the impact of differential dropout between the 2 treatment groups on th e 
treatment effect estimate.  
Safety 
All safety endpoints will be summarized by treatment group and visit when appropriate. Adverse events and 
Neratinib Tablets (PB- 272) 13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 9 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL serious adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding 
system v.15 or later , and they will be tabulated by organ system and preferred term. All AEs will be graded 
according to the  NCI CTCAE v.4.0. Differences in the incidence of the most common AEs and SAEs between 
the two treatment groups will be investigated using a CMH chi -square test, stratified on  hormone receptor 
status, number of prior HER2-directed regimens in the metastatic se tting, geographic region , and disease 
category (visceral vs. non -visceral only).  
Interim Analysis : 
No interim PFS  or OS analysis for early stopping is planned.  An interim analysis of OS will be conducted at the 
time of the final PFS analysis  (at the alpha level of 0.002 at the interim analysis and 0.038 for the final analysis ).  
Final Analysis :  
A final PFS analysis will be conducted when 419 PFS events have occurred . 
A final OS analys is will be conducted when 37 8 deaths have occurred . 
An analysis of all efficacy and safety endpoints will occur after the long -term follow -up phase has been completed.

2.1 Background 
2.1.1 General Therapeutic Area 
Approximately 15-20% ( Ahn et al., 2012; Saini et al, 2011 ) of women with breast cancer have 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) cancer, which is associated with 
aggressive disease and poor prognosis ( Slamon et al, 1987 ). The human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 (HER2)/neu gene is a member of the family of EGFR/ErbB genes : amplification or 
overexpression is associated with an aggressive disease biology, including enhanced cell 
proliferation and reduced progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) ( Slamon et 
al, 1987; Zhang et al, 2007 ; Badache and Goncalves 2006 ; Slamon et al., 1989 ). Compared with 
female breast cancer, male breast cancer cases are more often hormonal receptor (estrogen 
receptor/progesterone receptor) positive and HER2 negative, but treatment of male breast cancer 
patients follows the same indications as female postmenopausal breast cancer with surgery, 
systemic therapy and radiotherapy ( Ottini et al., 2010 ). 
2.2 Current Therapies 
2.2.1 The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Family (ErbB Receptors) 
Members of the epidermal growth factor family of trans-membrane receptors (ErbB family) are 
potent mediators of normal cell growth and development and are expressed in various tissues of 
epithelial, mesenchymal and neuronal origin (Baselga and Swain, 2009 ). The ErbB family 
consists of four closely related type 1 trans-membrane tyrosine kinase receptors: epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR; also known as ErbB1 and HER1), ErbB2 (HER2), ErbB3 
(HER3), and ErbB4 (HER4).  
Aberrant expression of HER1, HER2 and HER3 are linked to development of many epithelial 
cancers including colorectal, gastric, breast and head and neck cancers. These 
membrane-spanning proteins receive extracellular signals from small peptide ligand molecules, 
including epidermal growth factor-like molecules, transforming growth factor-α and neuregulins. 
Under normal physiological conditions, activation of the HER receptors is controlled by the 
spatial and temporal expression of their ligands ( Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001 ). Ligand binding 
triggers intracellular signaling through a complex and tightly controlled array of signaling 
pathways that together drive and regulate many cellular functions, including cell proliferation 
and organ development and repair. Binding of ligands to extracellular parts of HER1, HER3 and 
HER4 will result in dimerization and initiates a series of signaling cascades that includes

Puma Biotechnology 20 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide-3kinase (PI3K), Akt, and mammalian target 
of rapamycin ( Garrett and Arteaga, 2011 ).  
Each receptor comprises an extracellular domain (ECD) at which ligand binding occurs: an 
alpha
-helical trans-membrane segment and an intracellular protein tyrosine kinase domain 
(Olayioye et al., 2000) . Receptor dimerization is an essential requirement for signaling activity of 
these receptors and can occur between two different HER receptors (hetero-dimerization) or 
between two molecules of the same receptor (homo-dimerization) ( Olayioye et al., 2000; 
Ferguson et al., 2003) . HER homodimers weakly perpetuate signals compared with heterodimers 
(Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001 ). As the natural ligand for HER2 has not been identified, the 
receptor is presumed to exert its effects via formation of heterodimers with other HER family 
members, and is thought to be the preferred dimerization partner for the other receptors ( Rosen et 
al., 2010). In fact, heterodimer formation with HER2 has been shown to increase the affinity of 
ligand binding to the dimerization partner ( Graus-Porta et al., 1997 ). Dimerization of HER3, 
which lacks intrinsic kinase activity, with HER2 induces phosphorylation of HER3, which then 
activates the PI3K and Akt pathways ( Graus-Porta et al., 1997 ).  
2.2.2 Cancer Therapies Targeting HER Receptors 
2.2.2.1 Trastuzumab  
Trastuzumab, the first agent approved for treatment of HER2+ breast cancer, is a monoclonal 
antibody that binds to the juxtamembrane portion of the HER2/neu receptor, resulting in 
inhibition of tumor proliferation (Goldenberg 1999 ). Possible mechanisms by which trastuzumab 
might decrease signaling include prevention of HER2-receptor dimerization, increased 
endocytotic destruction of the receptor, inhibition of shedding the extra-cellular domain, and 
immune activation (Valabrega et al., 2007 ). Preclinical models suggest that trastuzumab recruits 
immune effector cells that are responsible for antibody-dependent cytotoxicity ( Weiner and 
Adams, 2000 ). Trastuzumab was first approved for use in the treatment of HER2-amplified 
breast cancer in the US in 1998. 
2.2.2.2 Pertuzumab [Perjeta™]  
Pertuzumab ( Perjeta)  is  a monoclonal antibody that binds HER2 at a different epitope of the 
HER2 extracellular domain (subdomain II) than that at which trastuzumab binds ( Baselga et al., 
2012) and prevents HER2 from dimerizing with other ligand-activated HER receptors, most 
notably
 HER3 (Baselga and Swain, 2009 ; Agus et al., 2002 ). The HER2-HER3 heterodimer is 
considered to be the most potent signaling pair ( Agus et al., 2002 ), driving cell proliferation in 
HER2+ cancer ( Lee-Hoeflich et al., 2008 ;  Hsieh and Moasser, 2007 ). In recent studies, the 
addition of pertuzumab to combination therapy has led to improvements in PFS in patients with

PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 21 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and higher response rates in the preoperative setting 
(Murphy
 and Morris, 2012 ). 
2.2.2.3 Pertuzumab in Combination with Trastuzumab 
Although treatment with trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy (as compared with 
chemotherapy alone) significantly improves PFS and OS among patients with HER2+ MBC, in 
most patients, the disease progresses ( Nahta and Esteva 2007 ). Because pertuzumab and 
trastuzumab bind to different HER2 epitopes and have complementary mechanisms of action, the 
combination of these two agents, provide a more comprehensive blockade of HER2 signaling 
and result in greater antitumor activity than either agent alone in HER2+ tumor models (Lee-
Hoeflich et al., 2008; Scheuer et al., 2009 ). In Phase 2 studies, a pertuzumab-trastuzumab 
regimen showed activity in patients with HER2+ MBC ( Baselga et al. 2010 ; Portera et al., 2008 ) 
and in patients with early breast cancer (Gianni et al., 2010 ).  
The Clinical Evaluation of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab (CLEOPATRA) study assessed the 
efficacy and safety of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel, as compared with placebo 
plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel (control group), as first-line treatment for patients with HER2+ 
MBC who had not received chemotherapy or biologic therapy for their metastatic disease 
(Baselga et al., 2012 ). Based on an interim analysis (on 43% of the total number of events 
planned for the final analysis), treatment with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel 
compared with the control group resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of progression or 
death and an increase of 6.1 months in median PFS ( Baselga et al., 2012). The median PFS in the 
control group (12.4 months) was similar to that among HER2+ MBC patients in two other 
randomized studies, who were treated with the combination of trastuzumab and docetaxel 
(11.7 months (Marty et al., 2005 ) and 11.1 months (Valero et al., 2011 ). CLEOPATRA findings 
suggest that targeting HER2+ tumors with two anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies that have 
complementary mechanisms of action results in a more comprehensive blockade of HER2 and 
highlights the clinical importance of preventing the ligand-dependent formation of HER2 dimers 
in order to silence HER2 signaling to the greatest extent possible ( Baselga and Swain, 2009 ; 
Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001 ). 
Pertuzumab received approval in the US in 2012 for use in combination with trastuzumab and 
docetaxel for the treatment of patients with HER2+ MBC who have not received prior 
anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy for metastatic disease.  
2.2.2.4 Ado-trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1 [Kadcyla™]) 
Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1 [Kadcyla]) is an antibody-drug conjugate that combines 
HER2-targeted delivery of the potent antimicrotubule agent emtansine (DM1), a derivative of the 
antimicrotubule agent maytansine, with the antitumor activity of trastuzumab ( Lewis Phillips et 
Neratinib Tablets (PB- 272) 13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 22 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL al., 2008; Remillard et al., 1975; Cassady et al., 2004 ; Widdison et al., 2006 ; Junttila et al., 
2011). In T-DM1, trastuzumab and DM1 are covalently linked via a stable thioether linker 
(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1 -carboxylate, which is thought to limit the exposure of 
normal tissue to DM1 ( Krop et al., 2010 ; Burris et al., 2011 ). Antitumor activity was established 
in a proof-of-concept Phase 2 study of single-agent T-DM1 in patients with HER2+ MBC, who 
had progressed while receiving HER2-directed therapy ( Burris et al., 2011 ). Furthermore, in a 
single-arm Phase 2 study, T-DM1 demonstrated efficacy in patients with HER2+ MBC who 
previously received all standard HER2-directed therapies (trastuzumab, lapatinib, an 
anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine) ( Krop et al., 2012 ).

compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine in patients with HER2+ locally advanced or MBC, 
previously treated with a trastuzumab-based regimen and a taxane) showed a significant and 
clinically meaningful improvement with T-DM1 in PFS compared with lapatinib plus 
capecitabine ( Blackwell et al., 2012 ). Other end points supported T-DM1 as an active and well-
tolerated novel therapy for HER2+ advanced breast cancer. T-DM1 is approved in the US for 
patients with HER2-positive MBC who have previously received trastuzumab and a taxane 
separately or in combination. 
2.2.2.5 Lapatinib 
Another HER2-targeted agent is lapatinib, an oral, selective, reversible, small molecule tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor that targets the tyrosine kinase domains of both HER1 and HER2 ( Rusnak et al., 
2011; Gomez et al., 2008 ). In vitro studies confirmed that lapatinib inhibits growth ( Rusnak et 
al., 2011; Xia et al., 2002 ) and can lead to cell arrest or apoptosis ( Rusnak et al., 2001 ; Xia et al., 
2002; Konecny et al., 2006 ) in human tumor cells overexpressing HER1 or HER2. Furthermore, 
lapatinib treatment has been shown to inhibit the growth of HER2-overexpressing human breast 
cancer cells that do not respond to trastuzumab after long-term conditioning ( Konecny et al., 
2006). Investigations of lapatinib monotherapy conducted in highly refractory MBC patients 
showed modest cytoreduction and disease stabilization in a trastuzumab-refractory setting 
(Blackwell et al., 2005 ). 
2.2.2.6 Lapatinib in Combination with Capecitabine  
Lapatinib was first approved in the US in 2007 for use in combination with capecitabine for the 
treatment of patients with advanced or MBC whose tumors overexpress HER2 and who have 
received prior therapy including an anthracycline, a taxane and trastuzumab. 
The efficacy of lapatinib in combination with capecitabine is summarized in  Table 1.

2.2.3 Neratinib 
2.2.3.1 Preclinical Data 
Neratinib is an orally available small molecule that inhibits HER1, HER2 and HER4 at the 
intracellular tyrosine kinase domains, a mechanism of action that is different from trastuzumab 
as well as lapatinib. Neratinib reduces HER1 and HER2 autophosphorylation, downstream 
signaling, and the growth of HER 1 and HER2 dependent cell lines. Neratinib most likely inhibits 
kinase activity through irreversible binding at a targeted cysteine residue in the adenosine 
triphosphate binding pocket of the receptor. Preclinical data suggest that neratinib will have 
antitumor activity in HER1 and/or HER 2-expressing carcinoma cell lines, with cellular 
IC50 <100 nM ( Rabindran et al., 2004 ) . 
Neratinib may have advantages over other HER2 inhibitors, due to its ability to inhibit both 
HER1 and HER2, and to inhibit irreversibly. Breast cancer cells may become resistant to 
trastuz
umab on the basis of ECD truncated HER 2 receptor, which can no longer be recognized 
by the antibody ( Xia et al., 2004 ), or because of co-activation of HER1 signaling ( Rampaul et al., 
2005; Zaczek et al., 2005 ). However, since neratinib acts on the intracellular tyrosine kinase 
domain, such cells are likely to maintain sensitivity to neratinib ( Mosesson and Yarden, 2004 ). 
In vivo, neratinib is active in HER 2 and HER1-dependent tumor xenograft models, when 
administered orally on a once daily schedule. Overall, neratinib is less potent against 
HER1-dependent tumors than HER2-dependent tumors in viv o, although it has equivalent 
activity against the two  kinases in vitro. 
Further pre-clinical information on neratinib is provided in the current Investigator's Brochure.

PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 24 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL 2.2.3.3  Neratinib Single-Agent Activity in Patients with HER2+ Breast Cancer 
Both the ability of neratinib to concurrently block signal transduction through the three active 
tyrosine kinase HER  receptors and its irreversible binding and prolonged inhibition of these 
growth-promoting pathways provide the opportunity to further improve the clinical benefit of 
this therapeutic approach in HER2+ MBC patients. Early clinical data have demonstrated the 
activity of neratinib in patients who have already failed other small molecule or antibody-
based anti-HER receptor therapies, suggesting the ability of this agent to overcome drug 
resistance in this refractory patient population. 
In the single-agent, first in human, Phase 1 study (3144A1-102-US) of neratinib in solid tumor, a 
32% objective response rate (ORR) was observed among patients with trastuzumab refractory 
HER2 overexpressing disease (Wong et al., 2009) . Specifically, 8 of 25 patients had partial 
response (PR). Among the responders, 2 PRs occurred at neratinib doses of 120 or 180 mg per 
day, which was below the recommended monotherapy dose. All of these responders had prior 
trastuzumab therapy, notably 6 patients had received at least four trastuzumab-based therapies. 
Additionally, all had received prior anthracycline and gemcitabine,  and the majority (7/8) had 
received prior taxane therapy. Six patients had also received prior capecitabine therapy and 3 had 
received prior 5% fluorouracil treatment. This activity in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancers in 
the Phase 1 setting compares favorably to the response rates reported in two Phase 2 studies of 
the reversible dual kinase inhibitor, lapatinib, in a similar patient population ( Blackwell et al, 
2005). 
An open-label, multicenter, Phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of neratinib 240 mg 
dail
y, in patients with and without prior trastuzumab treatment, who had advanced HER2+ breast 
ca
ncer. The primary end point, the 16-week PFS rates, was 59% and 78% in prior 
trastuzumab-treated patients and trastuzumab-naïve cohorts, respectively ( Burstein et al., 2010 ). 
The ORR was 24% and 56%, respectively, and the median PFS times were 22.3 and 39.6 weeks, 
respectively. Mean steady-state trough concentrations for the 240 mg daily dose exceeded 
concentrations needed to inhibit autophosphorylation of HER2 in preclinical models ( Rabindran 
et al., 2004).  
The most common adverse events (AE) were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. Diarrhea 
was the most frequent Grade 3 to 4 AE, occurring in 30% of patients with prior trastuzumab 
treatment and in 13% of trastuzumab-naïve patients, which resulted in dose reductions of 29% 
and 4% of patients, respectively. However, treatment discontinuation (TD) occurred in only one 
patient due to diarrhea (Grade 2). No neratinib-related Grade 3 or 4 cardiotoxicity was reported.  
Additional information regarding previous clinical studies of neratinib for treatment of HER2+ 
breast cancer is provided in the current Investigator’s Brochure.

Puma Biotechnology 25 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL 2.2.3.4 Neratinib in Combination with Capecitabine  
In a Phase 1/2 clinical study ( 3144A1-2206- WW) investigating the combination of neratinib plus 
capecitabine, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of neratinib 240 mg was established in 
combination with capecitabine 1500 mg/m2 in patients with solid tumors. Subsequent 
investigation of this dose regimen in patients with HER2+ advanced breast cancer demonstrated 
that this combination treatment was clinically active and has a manageable toxicity profile. 
In the study, clinical responses at the MTD were observed in 63% of patients (64% of those with 
no prior lapatinib exposure and 57% of those with prior lapatinib), while median durations of 
response were 46 and 48 weeks, respectively. This is a slightly higher response rate and similar 
duration of response (DOR) to that observed in previous neratinib monotherapy studies, but in a 
full study population previously treated with trastuzumab ( Burstein et al., 2010 ; Wong et al., 
2009); an ORR of 29 % with neratinib monotherapy has also been reported ( Martin et al., 2011 ). 
In this study, all patients progressed to previous trastuzumab-based therapy, and median PFS 
with neratinib plus capecitabine was 40 weeks in the lapatinib-naive cohort and 36 weeks in the 
lapatinib-treated cohort. These results compare favorably with those previously observed in the 
monotherapy study for patients who received prior trastuzumab (22 weeks) ( Geyer et al., 2006 ). 
The results of this study suggest that the combination of neratinib plus capecitabine may have 
superior efficacy in patients with prior therapy with anti HER2-targeted therapies.  
The results of this Phase 1/2 study also compare favorably with results obtained from the 
combination of lapatinib plus capecitabine in an indirect comparison. In a Phase 3 study, ORR 
(44.2%), clinical benefit rate ( CBR) (57.7%), and PFS (6.34 months) with lapatinib plus 
capecitabine were lower than was observed with neratinib plus capecitabine in the Phase 
1/2 study (Xu et al., 2011 ).  
The combination of neratinib plus capecitabine was associated with an acceptable safety and 
tolerability profile in the Phase 1/2 study. Diarrhea was the most common Grade 3/4 AE in the 
study (reported by 23% of patients), although only 4 patients discontinued treatment due to the 
event (6%), which is similar to previous experience in neratinib monotherapy studies ( Burstein et 
al., 2010; Wong et al., 2009 ). Diarrhea typically occurred within a few days of neratinib 
initiation (median, 2 days) and was most often managed by a dose delay or reduction. Across 
previous neratinib studies, diarrhea typically occurred within 2-8.5 days of neratinib initiation 
and was generally managed with dose adjustments or antidiarrheal medications ( Burstein et al., 
2010; Wong et al., 2009 ).  
The most frequent toxicities reported  with capecitabine monotherapy are palmar-plantar 
erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPE) and gastrointestinal events. While the incidence of PPE (all 
grades, 47%) in this study was similar to the range reported in capecitabine monotherapy studies 
(37% to 60%), the incidence of diarrhea was higher (all grades, 88% compared with 5% to 58% 
Neratinib Tablets (PB- 272) 13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 26 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL reported in monotherapy studies) ( B urstein et al., 2010 ; Wong et al., 2009 ), as may be expected 
from the combination of two  drugs that are associated with gastrointestinal effects. Overall, no 
unexpected toxicity was observed in patients receiving neratinib plus capecitabine, and few 
patients discontinu ed treatment due to toxicity. 
Further details can be found in the current Investigator's Brochure which contains comprehensive 
information on the investigational product. 
2.3 Study Rationale 
The use of taxanes, anthracyclines,  and trastuzumab early in the treatment of HER2+ MBC has 
become standard practice. In patients whose HER2 disease recurs after adjuvant/neoadjuvant 
trastuzumab therapy and in patients who initially present with advanced metastatic HER2 
disease, treatment with trastuzumab in combination with a chemotherapy regimen is usually 
prescribed. Almost all patients receiving trastuzumab alon e or in combination with other drugs 
for HER2 overexpressing MBC ultimately progress. The clinical  benefit of continuing 
trastuzumab after progression in the first-line metastatic setting has not  been definitively 
established in prospective clinical studies. It is hypothesized that sensitivity to  trastuzumab may 
be retained and that the combination of trastuzumab plus another chemotherapy  agent may be 
preferable to chemotherapy alone in the second-line setting ( Pusztai and Esteva 2006 ; 
vonMinckwitz et al., 2009 ). This may explain  the widespread acceptance and use of trastuzumab 
plus a different cytotoxic agent in the second-line setting ( Love, 2004 ).  
After multiple treatment regimens with  trastuzumab and possibly lapatinib, it is hypothesized 
that the tumor may no longer be sensitive  to the existing HER 2 agents. Consequently,  the 
continuing development of new anti-HER2 strategies is needed, particularly for patients whose 
disease has progressed on prior regimens. 
The current multicenter, multinational, randomized, controlled clinical study is designed to 
compare OS and independently-assessed PFS following treatment with neratinib plus 
capecitabine versus lapatinib plus capecitabine in patients with HER2+ MBC who have received 
two or more  prior HER2-directed regimens in the metastatic setting.  
Further information on the benefits and risks of neratinib in this patient population is provided in 
the current Investigator's Brochure.

Puma Biotechnology 28 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL 4 OVERALL DESIGN AND PLAN OF THE STUDY 
4.1 Study Design 
This is a randomized, multi-center, multinational, open-label, active-controlled, parallel design 
study of the combination of neratinib plus capecitabine versus the combination of lapatinib plus 
capecitabine in HER2+ MBC patients, who have received two or more pr i or HER2-directed 
regimens in the metastatic setting.  
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms: 
 Arm A: neratinib (240 mg once daily) + capecitabine (1500 mg/m2 orally daily, 750 mg/m2 
twice daily [BID]) 
 Arm B: lapatinib (1250 mg once daily) + capecitabine (2000 mg/m2 orally daily, 1000 mg/m2 
BID) 
Following a 21-day screening period (Section  9.1), eligible patients will be randomized to 
Arm A or Arm B. Baseline assessments will be performed prior to randomization. Following 
randomization, patients will participate in the active treatment phase, consisting of 21-day 
treatment cycles (Section  9.2). Investigational products will be administered orally by patients as 
described in Section 6.1. Neratinib and lapatinib are to be taken continuously, in 21-day cycles, 
with no rest between cycles. Capecitabine will be taken on Days 1 to 14 of each 21-day cycle. 
Clinic visits during the active treatment phase are planned on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1 and 
on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle. Assessments required throughout the study are summarized 
in the Schedule of Procedures ( Appendix 1 ) and a diagram of the study schema is provided in 
Figure 1.  
Patients may be discontinued from investigational product(s) or from the study, as described in 
Sections 10.1, 10.2 and 11.  
The co-primary endpoints are independently adjudicated PFS and OS. The secondary endpoints 
are investigator-assessed PFS, ORR, DOR, CBR (CR, PR or SD ≥24 weeks), health outcomes 
assessments, time to intervention for symptomatic metastatic CNS disease, AEs and SAEs 
(graded according to the National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events Version 4.0 [CTCAE v.4.0]). An  interim analysis of OS will be performed at the 
time of final PFS analysis (Section  12.6).  
Approximately 600  patients will be enrolled at approximately 200 centers in North America, 
Europe including Israel,  and the Rest of World (RoW). See Section  12.7 for a discussion of 
sample size.

Puma Biotechnology 29 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL Patients are anticipated to participate in the study for an average of 28 months. This includes 
approximately 0.5 months for screening, an estimated average of 9.5 months for the active 
treatment phase, and an estimated average of 18 months for the long-term follow-up phase. 
Patients who permanently discontinue treatment will enter the long-term follow-up phase 
(Section 9.5 until death or withdrawal of consent (Section 10.2).  
The approximate duration of the study is 50 months, which is the time estimated to reach the 
required 378 OS events. The end of study (EOS) will occur as of the date of the last visit of the 
last pati
ent undergoing the study. In the event that the EOS is declared earlier (e.g.,  OS primary 
endpoint is met), patients who continue to receive clinical benefit from neratinib plus 
capecitabine will be offered the opportunity to continue to receive this combination via a 
treatment extension study or expanded access protocol. Patients who continue to derive clinical 
benefit from lapatinib plus capecitabine will be provided the opportunity to receive these 
marketed therapies as well. 
4.2 Randomization and Blinding 
4.2.1 Randomization Scheme 
Randomization will be managed and maintained centrally through an automated Interactive 
Voice Response System/Interactive Web Response System. Patients will be randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment arms. 
Randomization will be stratified according to: 
 The number of previous HER2-directed regimens in the metastatic setting (N = 2 or 
N ≥3). 
 Geographic region (North America vs. Europe, including Israel vs. RoW) 
 Visceral vs.  non-visceral only disease  
 Estrogen receptor+ (ER+) and/or progesterone receptor (PR+) (i.e., hormone receptor +) 
versus ER- and PR - (i.e., hormone receptor -). 
4.2.2 Enrollment and Randomization of Patients to Treatment 
Once eligibility is confirmed, patients will be randomized to a treatment group according to the 
randomization schedule. All patients must commence treatment with investigational products no 
later than 14 days after randomization. Patients who do not meet the eligibility criteria will not 
be r
andomized in the study,  but may be rescreened up to two times at the Investigator’s 
discretion.

Puma Biotechnology 34 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL Refer to the lapatinib (Tykerb®) US Package Insert and/or the  (Tyverb®) SPC for further 
information on dosing  
Capecitabine  
Capecitabine investigational product is available as 150 mg and 500 mg film-coated tablets. 
Capecitabine (total dose of 2000 mg/m2 daily, in 2 approximately evenly divided doses) will be 
self-administered orally by patients, starting with Cycle 1/Day 1. Doses are to be taken daily on 
Days 1 to 14 of each 21-day cycle. Capecitabine  should be taken with water within 30 minutes 
after a meal.  
During treatment with lapatinib plus capecitabine, patients should be monitored for conditions 
that may require dose to be held or discontinu ed, as described in Appendix 2 . Careful attention 
should be paid to the onset of diarrhea or hand-foot syndrome in particular, and early dose 
adjustment or prophylactic therapy should be implemented as described in Appendix 2 . 
Daily dosing of lapatinib plus capecitabine should continue until a criterion for treatment 
withdrawal or study withdrawal is met (see Sections  10.1 and 10.2, respectively).  
Refer to the capecitabine (Xeloda®) US Package Insert and/or the  SPC for further information on 
dosing. 
6.1.3 Dose Adjustment 
Investigational product dose adjustment and/or discontinuation should be performed according to 
Appendix 2  and Section 10.1.  
Recommended dose reductions for the -1 and -2 dose levels of neratinib are listed in Table 2.

Abbreviation: BID: twice daily 
a Since capecitabine is provided as 150 mg or 500 mg tablets, it is recommended that the capecitabine dose 
reduction(s) (to 75% [level -1] or 50% [level -2] of the starting dose) is rounded down to the nearest 500 mg or 
multiple of 150 mg for the BID dose. If the patient’s body surface area is >2.0, the standard of care for the study 
center can be utilized for capecitabine mg/m2 dosing. 
 
The recommended dose reduction for the -1 dose level of lapatinib is listed in Table 4. Lapatinib 
doses should be held in patients with an LVEF that is Grade ≥2 and in patients with an LVEF 
that decreases below the institution’s lower limit of normal (LLN; <50% if not specified). 
Lapatinib (in combination with capecitabine) may be restarted at a reduced dose of 1000 mg/day 
after a minimum of 2 weeks, if the LVEF recovers to normal and the patient is asymptomatic. 
Lapatinib doses should be held in patients with Grade ≥2 NCI CTCAE toxicity, until the toxicity 
improves to Grade ≤1; lapatinib may be restarted at 1250 mg/day. If the toxicity recurs, then 
lapatinib (in combination with capecitabine) should be restarted at a reduced dose of 
1000 mg/day.

If doses of investigational product are held, study procedures for that cycle will proceed on 
schedule as planned, without any delay. This also applies to tumor assessments, which should 
continue to be done every 6  weeks, starting from the first dose of investigational product until 
the first planned tumor assessment at 6 weeks (±3 days), and then after every subsequent 
6 weeks (±3 days) of treatment regardless of any changes in dose or occurrence of AEs. Missed 
dose(s) of investigational product (i.e., any dose that is not administered within the protocol-
defined administration window) will not be made up. The dose adjustment guidelines represent 
the minimum set of measures that Investigators must follow. However, additional measures may 
be taken, as necessary, for certain patients per the Investigator’s medical judgment. All dose 
modifications/adjustments should be documented in the patient’s source file. 
Once an investigational product dose has been reduced for a patient, all subsequent cycles must 
be administered at that dose, unless further dose reduction is required. Dose re-escalation is not 
permitted. 
Patients must discontinue an investigational product if a criterion for investigational product 
withdrawal is met (see Section  10.1 and Appendix 2 ).  
Once an investigational product has been discontinued, patients who had been receiving 
combination therapy may continue to receive the other investigational product as monotherapy, 
at the Investigator’s discretion. This is applicable to both treatment arms of the study. 
Reintroduction of the discontinued investigational product at a later time during the active 
treatment phase is not permitted. 
Detailed rules for dose adjustments of neratinib, lapatinib, and capecitabine in case of toxicity 
are provided in Appendix 2 . 
6.2 Packaging, Labeling and Storage 
Detailed packaging information for all investigational products is available in a study reference 
manual(s). All investigational products will be labeled according to local regulations.

PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 37 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL The Sponsor will supply all investigational products (as required), which  should be stored at the 
study sites in a secure location with limited access.  
All investigational products should be stored at 25°C (77°F) or below; do not freeze. Excursions 
are permitted to 30°C (86°F). Neratinib should be stored with desiccant. Keep containers closed 
tightly. 
6.3 Drug Accountability 
The study site must maintain accurate records documenting dates and quantities of 
investigational product received from the Sponsor. On a per patient basis, records must be 
maintained documenting dates and quantities of investigational product dispensed and returned 
at each study visit. Any investigational product accidentally or deliberately destroyed must be 
documented.  
Throughout the study, reconciliation will be made between the amount of investigational product 
supplied, dispensed, returned, and subsequently destroyed or returned to Sponsor. All 
investigational products that were supplied by the Sponsor will be returned to Sponsor or its 
representative, or destroyed at the site in accordance with Sponsor guidelines. 
Individual patient dosing compliance should be reviewed at each study visit by study site staff. If 
patient non-compliance is noted, the patient should be re-instructed regarding proper dosing 
procedures in order to continue in the study. If repeated non-compliance is noted, additional 
steps may be taken, including withdrawal of the patient from the study (see Section  10.2).

Puma Biotechnology 38 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL 7 CONCOMITANT TREATMENT 
All concomitant treatments, therapies and medications will be captured  from the signing of the 
ICF until the end of the treatment. This will include the start date, stop date, generic name, route 
of administration, dose and indication for treatment.  
At screening, patients will be asked what medications they have taken during the last 30 days, 
which medications are ongoing at the time of screening, any medical conditions that require 
medication, and all prior cancer therapies. At each subsequent study visit, patients will be asked 
what concomitant medications they are currently taking.  
7.1 Required Concomitant Treatment 
7.1.1 Loperamide Antidiarrheal Therapy 
Diarrhea is the major dose-limiting toxicity of neratinib with onset typically occurring early in 
the course of treatment (during the first few weeks of treatment). Primary prophylactic use of 
antidiarrheal medication is mandatory  for all enrolled patients in the neratinib treatment arm. 
Loperamide is the recommended standard therapy to treat diarrhea in this study. If alternative 
antidiarrheal medication is proposed, this should be discussed with the Medical Monitor and the 
reason documented in the source documents. Second-line antidiarrheal treatments and adjunctive 
therapies (i.e., octreotide [SANDOSTATIN®]) (or equivalent as approved by the Sponsor) are 
also recommended for use when appropriate. 
The Investigator must review with the patient the Patient Instructions  for the management of 
diarrhea and the Patient Diary  for the patient’s daily recording of investigational product during 
the first 2  cycles, number of stools, and use of loperamide and/or other anti-diarrheals for 
patients in the neratinib treatment arm. Both the patient and the Investigator must sign the patient 
instructions for the management of diarrhea. The Patient Instructions and Patient Diary are to be 
handed to the patient before leaving the site with investigational product on or before Cycle 
1/Day 1, with clear instructions to contact the Investigator in the event of de nov o onset or 
persistent Grade ≥2 diarrhea to discuss the appropriate course of treatment. The Investigator 
must also complete and sign the Investigator Checklist  on or before Cycle 1/Day 1.  
Documentation of any occurrences of stools or diarrhea must be as precise as possible and 
captured in the Patient Diary. For AE recording, documentation of “Intermittent” events of 
diarrhea is limited to Grade 1. If events of Grade 1 diarrhea are separated by 3 days without any 
diarrhea, then each event must be documented as separate AEs with corresponding start and stop 
dates. 
The entries on the Patient Diary should be reviewed together with the patient for the first 
2 cycles. If the patient has experienced diarrhea since the last visit, details of the daily number of 
Neratinib Tablets (PB- 272) 13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 39 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL stools provided on the diary help to grade the diarrhea as precisely as possible (per NCI CTCAE 
v.4.0). Also, the daily dose of loperamide (or other anti-diarrheals, if applicable) noted on the 
diary for patients in the neratinib treatment arm will be reviewed and recorded on the CRF. 
Loperamide will be dispensed directly by the site on or before Cycle 1/Day 1 with neratinib. It is 
very important to initiate treatment with loperamide concomitantly with the first dose of 
neratinib to minimize occurrence and severity of diarrhea.  
Prophylactic dosing instructions (Cycle 1) 
 Inform patients that they will experience diarrhea while taking neratinib. 
 Administer loperamide: initial dose of 4 mg (2 tablets/capsules) with the first dose of 
neratinib, followed by 2 mg (1 tablet/capsule) every 4 hours for the first 3 days. After the 
first 3 days, take loperamide 2 mg every 6 to 8 hours until the end of the first cycle of 
therapy regardless of whether the patient is experiencing diarrhea or not.  
 For patients with persistent Grade 1 diarrhea (<4 stools per day above baseline) on 
loperamide, Lomotil® (diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate) 1 tablet (2.5 mg) 
every 6 to 8 hours may be added (or equivalent as approved by Sponsor). 
 For Grade 2 diarrhea during Cycle 1 (4 to 6 stools per day above baseline, despite intensive 
anti-diarrheal therapy), consider adding octreotide (short-acting) 150 µg subcutaneous [SC] 
injection 3 times a day, or after initial dose of short-acting octreotide, if well tolerated, a 
single dose of octreotide LAR 20 mg by intramuscular injection (equivalent medication 
may be used with approval of the Sponsor). 
 The sites must contact the patient by phone at 1 day, 2 days, and 3 days after the first dose 
of ne
ratinib to inquire about any diarrhea. 
(These phone calls are mandatory and must be recorded in the study chart together with 
response from the patient and action taken.) 
 Instruct patients to promptly report diarrhea symptoms. 
 Instruct patient to record the number of stools per day (see Patient Diary, Section 8.5) and 
the dose of anti-diarrheal medication taken each day (for patients in the neratinib treatment 
arm)
 for the first 2 cycles. 
For new onset uncomplicated Grade 1 or Grade 2 diarrhea (Cycle 2 and beyond) 
Dietetic measures 
 Stop all lactose-containing products.  
 Drink 8 to 10 large glasses of clear liquids per day. 
 Eat frequent small meals.  
Neratinib Tablets (PB- 272) 13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 40 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL  Recommend low fat regimen enriched with bananas, rice, applesauce and toast until 
resolution of diarrhea. 
Pharmacological Treatment 
 Administer loperamide: initial dose of 4 mg (2 tablets/cap sules) with the first bout of 
diarrhea followed by 2 mg (1 tablet/capsule) every 4 hours or after every unformed stool 
(maximum 16 mg a day) and continue loperamide at this frequency until diarrhea free for 
12 hours.  
 F
or patients with persistent Grade 1 diarrhea on loperamide, Lomotil (diphenoxylate 
hydrochloride and atropine sulfate) 1 tablet (2.5 mg) every 6 to 8 hours may be added (or 
equivalent as approved by the Sponsor). 
 For Grade 2 diarrhea  (4 to 6 stools per day above baseline, despite intensive antidiarrheal 
therapy), consider adding octreotide (short-acting) 150 µg SC three times daily (TID); or 
after initial dose of short-acting octreotide, if well tolerated, a single dose of octreotide 
LAR 20 mg intramuscular ( IM) (equivalent medication may be used with approval of the 
Sponsor). 
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 diarrhea with complicating features (dehydration, fever, and/or 
Grade 3-4 neutropenia) 
Dietetic measures (same as above) 
Pharmacological treatment 
 Administer loperamide: initial dose of 4 mg (2 tablets/capsules) with the first bout of 
diarrhea followed by 2 mg (1 tablet/capsule) every 4 hours or after every unformed stool 
(maximum 16 mg a day) and continue loperamide at this frequency until diarrhea free for 
12 hours. Then titrate the amount of loperamide used to keep diarrhea controlled 
(<4 stool
s/day). 
 Administer octreotide (100-150 µg SC BID or intravenously ( IV) (25-50 µg/h) if 
dehydration is severe, with dose escalation up to 500 µg SC TID). 
 Use IV fluids as appropriate. 
 Consider prophylactic antibiotics as needed (e.g., fluoroquinolones) especially if diarrhea is 
persistent beyond 24 hours or there is fever or Grade 3-4 neutropenia. 
Stool cultures should be done to exclude infectious causes of Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea or diarrhea of 
any grade with complicating features (dehydration, fever, and/or Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia) per 
the Investigator’s discretion. Results from occult blood, fecal leukocyte stain, Clostridium 
difficile, Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella testing, when performed, should be reported 
using the appropriate CRF.

PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 41 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL Patients with significant diarrhea who are unresponsive to medical treatment may require 
treatment interruption or dose reduction.  
7.2 Permitted Concomitant Treatment 
Any palliative and /or supportive care for cancer-related symptoms, which are not otherwise 
specified in the list of prohibited medications (Section  7.3), or drugs with potential for drug-drug 
interactions (Section  7.4), or in the associated Appendices ( Appendix 4, Appendix 5, and 
Appendix 6 ), is permitted at the Investigator’s discretion. 
Specifically, the following treatments are permitted during the study:  
 Standard therapies for preexisting medical conditions, medical and/or surgical 
complications and palliation. All medication(s) as well as previous hormonal therapy, dose 
and length of therapy should be recorded in the CRF. 
 Bisphosphonates , regardless of indication, provided patients have been on stable doses for 
at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment. The stable dose should be maintained during the 
investigational product treatment period. Patients requiring initiation of bisphosphonate 
treatment during the course of the study should be discontinued due to progressive disease 
(PD), unless disease progression can be completely ruled out and clearly documented in the 
patient’s source documentation. 
 Secondary prophylactic use of growth factors (e.g., granulocyte colony stimulating 
factor or granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor) may be implemented per the 
American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines  at the Investigator’s discretion,  if 
significant neutropenia or febrile neutropenia/infection is observed. 
7.3 Prohibited Concomitant Treatment 
The following treatments are prohibited throughout the duration of the active (treatment) phase 
of the study:  
 Any concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy (including palliative radiotherapy), surgery 
related to cancer, anticancer immunotherapy, or other anticancer treatments including other 
investigational agents, megestrol and hormonal agents. 
7.4 Potential for Drug-Drug Interactions 
Patients should avoid agents known to be strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inducers or 
inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) for the duration of the active phase of the study. Patients should 
also avoid grapefruit/grapefruit juice and herbal remedies, including St John's Wort. Refer to 
Neratinib Tablets (PB- 272) 13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 42 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL Appendix 4 for a list of inhibitors and inducers of CYP isoenzymes. If unavoidable, patients 
taking such agents should be monitored closely. 
Concomitant treatment with inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided due to risk of decreased 
exposure to lapatinib. Concomitant treatment with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be 
avoided due to risk of increased exposure to lapatinib. Coadministration of lapatinib with orally 
administered medicines with narrow therapeutic windows that are substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., 
cisapride, pimozide and quinidine) and/or substrates of CYP2C8 (e.g., repaglinide) should be 
avoided. 
Clinically significant drug-drug interaction between sorivudine and 5-fluorouracil (5 -FU), 
resulting from the inhibition of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase by sorivudine, has been 
described. This interaction, which leads to increased fluoropyrimidine toxicity, is potentially 
fatal. Therefore, capecitabine must not be administered concomitantly with sorivudine or its 
chemically related analogues, such as brivudine. There must be at least a 4-week waiting period 
between end of treatment with sorivudine or its chemically related analogues such as brivudine 
and start of capecitabine therapy. Interactions with allopurinol have been observed for 5-FU that 
may result in possible decreased efficacy of 5-FU. Concomitant use of allopurinol with 
capecitabine should be avoided. 
Chronic immunosuppressive therapies should be avoided, including systemic corticosteroids. If 
unavoidable, patients taking such agents should be monitored closely. Steroids given for 
physiological replacement, as anti-emetics, or inhaled as well as short course of oral/topical 
steroids given for allergic reactions or asthma flares, are allowed. 
Patients using drugs known to cause QT/QTc prolongation should be monitored closely with 
serial electrocardiograms (ECG ) at the Investigator’s discretion. Refer to Appendix 6  for a 
summary of drugs known to have a risk of causing QT/QTc prolongation, potentially causing 
Torsade de Pointes (TdP). 
Pa
tients taking digoxin, a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate with a narrow therapeutic window, 
should be monitored closely. The digoxin dose should be adjusted as needed, since neratinib and 
lapatinib are inhibitors of P- gp. Co-administration of neratinib or lapatinib with digoxin could 
result in increased digoxin levels and associated digoxin toxicity. Refer to Appendix 5 for a list 
of substrates and inhibitors of P- gp. 
In addition to CYP3A4 and P-gp, lapatinib inhibits CYP2C8 in vitro at clinically relevant 
concentrations.  
Patients taking oral coumarin-derivative anticoagulants (i.e., warfarin and phenprocoumon ) 
should be monitored closely and their anticoagulant dose adjusted as needed.

PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 43 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL Patients taking concomitant capecitabine and phenytoin should be carefully monitored. The 
phenytoin dose may need to be reduced, as some patients receiving both drugs had toxicity 
associated with elevated phenytoin levels.  
The solubility of lapatinib is pH-dependent; thus, concomitant treatment with substances that 
increase gastric pH (e.g., esomeprazole, lansoprazole) should be avoided, as lapatinib solubility 
and absorption may decrease.

Puma Biotechnology 44 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL 8 EFFICACY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
8.1 Efficacy Assessment 
8.1.1 Clinical Endpoints and Definitions 
There are 2 co-primary endpoints in this study: independently-adjudicated PFS and OS. All 
patients randomized will be evaluated. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints include  Investigator-assessed PFS, ORR, DOR, and CB R (CR, 
PR or SD ≥24 weeks), time to intervention for symptomatic metastatic CNS disease, and health 
outcomes assessments.  
Progression-free Survival 
Progression-free survival is determined programmatically from adjudicated PD, defined as the 
interval from the date of randomization until the first date on which recurrence, progression (per 
RECIST v1.1 [Appendix 7 ]) or death due to any cause, is documented, censored at the last 
assessable evaluation, or at the initiation of new anticancer therapy. It is not necessary to confirm 
disease progression.  
Overall Survival 
Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause.  
Objective Response Rate 
The ORR is defined as the proportion of patients demonstrating either a CR or PR per RECIST 
v1.1 (Appendix 7 ) as their best overall response during the study. It is not necessary to confirm 
response. 
Duration of Response 
The DOR is measured from the time at which measurement criteria are first met for CR or PR 
(whichever status is recorded first) until the first date on which recurrence or PD or death is 
objectively documented, taking as a reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since 
enrollment, per RECIST v1.1 ( Appendix 7 ). The duration of overall complete response is 
measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that 
recurrent disease is objectively documented. 
Clinical Benefit Rate  
The CBR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieved overall tumor response (CR or 
PR) or SD for at least 24 weeks. Stable disease is measured from enrollment until the criteria for 
disease progression or response are met, per RECIST v1.1 ( Appendix 7 ). 
Neratinib Tablets (PB- 272) 13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 45 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL Time to Intervention for Symptomatic CNS Disease 
Time to intervention for symptomatic metastatic CNS disease is defined as the date of initiation 
of intervention or therapy for symptomatic CNS disease determined by the investigator to be due 
to CNS metastasis. This may include brain, leptomeningeal and epidural metastases including 
epidural spinal cord compression arising from tumor growth in the epidural space.  
8.1.2 Tumor A ssessments  
Tumor assessments will be performed in accordance with the Schedule of Procedures 
(Appendix 1 ). Computerized tomography ( CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other 
forms of baseline tumor assessments must be performed within 28 days prior to randomization. 
Tumor assessments will be performed every 6 weeks from the first day of study treatment 
(Cycle 1/Day 1).  
For patients who end therapy for any reason other than radiologically documented progression, 
every effort should be made to perform radiological tumor assessment until radiologic 
progression is documented. 
Tumor scans and other appropriate tumor assessments must be obtained prior to the start of the 
next treatment cycle. Overall response will be determined by the Investigator at each visit 
according to RECIST v1.1 ( Appendix 7).   
8.1.2.1 General Information 
All target and non-target sites of disease (see Appendix 7) identified at screening must be 
followed for the duration of the study. Their presence and absence should be noted throughout 
follow-up. Overall response for each patient is based on the combined results of target and 
non-target lesions and the presence or absence of new lesions.  
Tumor-based efficacy endpoints (i.e., PFS and ORR) will be based on tumor assessments, which 
are performed by the Investigators. Response and progression will be evaluated using RECIST 
v1.1 (Appendix 7). 
Tumor assessments will be performed for all patients at 6-week intervals throughout the active 
treatment phase,  starting from Cycle 1/Day 1 until documented disease progression, death, or 
withdrawal of consent, regardless of whether the patient is continuing or has discontinued study 
treatment.  Additional tumor evaluations will be performed as clinically indicated. Missed tumor 
assessments must be performed as soon as possible. As soon as evaluations for each tumor 
assessment are completed, the Investigator should assess the patient’s overall response (target 
plus non-target lesions) based on criteria and overall response algorithms as defined in RECIST 
v1.1 (Appendix 7). Scans (and/or good color photographs with a ruler for skin lesions) must be 
assessable for all evaluations.  
Neratinib Tablets (PB- 272) 13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 46 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL The longest diameters (LD) for all non-nodal target lesions and the short axis diameter (SAD) of 
nodal target lesions will be recorded. The LD for all non -nodal target lesions and the SAD of 
nodal target lesions will be added and reported as the baseline sum longest diameter (SLD). Per 
REC
IST v1.1, for determining CR or PR, all post-baseline tumor measurements will be 
compared with the baseline SLD; for determining PD, the post-baseline measurement is 
c
ompared with the smallest SLD recorded since initiation of treatment, including baseline (see 
Appendix 7).  
Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than PD per RECIST will continue to 
be followed up by protocol for scheduled tumor assessments until PD, and long-term for OS (see 
Section 10.3).  
For patients who show a CR on one scan and on a confirmatory scan obtained 6 weeks later, the 
frequency of subsequent scans may be reduced at the discretion of the investigator to no less than 
one scan every 12 weeks.  
The
 same method of measurement (CT/M RI) and the same technique of assessment should be 
used to characterize each identified and reported lesion from baseline through the final visit. All 
measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers. The 
screening CT/MRI must be performed within 28 days prior to randomization, and preferably no 
more than 28 days before the initiation of treatment. As often as possible, lesions should be 
assessed by the same Investigator using the same method of measurement. Physical examination 
may not be the sole method of assessment for a solitary lesion.  
8.1.2.2 Computerized Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
Computerized tomography and MRI are the recommended methods to measure target lesions 
selected for response assessment. Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with cuts of 
10 mm or less in slice thickness contiguously. Spiral CT should be performed using a 5 mm 
contiguous reconstruction algorithm. The size of CT/MRI scan interval cuts must not change for 
a patient after screening.  
Computerized tomography scans of th e chest, abdomen and/or pelvis should be obtained as 
clinically indicated. Alternatively, CT scans of the chest and separate CT scans of the abdomen 
and/or pelvis may be obtained. Radiographs may be used during the study to follow lesions seen 
on a bone scan and confirmed by radiographs at screening. In cases of CT contrast media allergy 
or renal insufficiency (creatinine >2 mg/dL [176.8 μmol/L]), in which CT scans with contrast 
cannot be done, enhanced MRIs (for pelvis or abdomen) or CT without contrast (for chest) may 
be used instead, but the same method of assessment must be used throughout the course of the 
study. Ultrasound should not be used for the purposes of measuring or evaluating tumors in this 
study.

8.1.2.3 Caliper measurement by clinical examination when lesions are superficial  
Skin lesions that can be measured with calipers as defined in RECIST v1.1 ( Appendix 7) or 
documented using color photography (with ruler) can be considered target or non-target lesions . 
Skin lesions which cannot be measured with calipers or documented using color photography 
(with ruler) should be recorded as non-measurable. Otherwise, this clinical measurement should 
be recorded in the CRF. Documentation by color photography in good light and including a ruler 
to estimate the size of the lesion is required, and will be provided to the central review vendor for 
independent evaluation by an oncologist. 
Note that when lesions can be evaluated both clinically and radiographically, the radiologic 
imaging evaluation (by CT or MRI as appropriate) should take precedence.  
8.2 Safety Assessment 
Refer to the Schedule of Procedures ( Appendix 1) for time points. Safety will be assessed with 
the following procedures: medical history, AEs, vital signs, detailed/brief (system-guided) 
physical examinations, 12-lead ECGs, LVEF (ECHO or MUGA), and laboratory evaluations. 
Adverse events will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v.4.0. Serious adverse events will 
be reported until 28 days after the last dose of the investigational product and will be followed 
until resolution or until condition stabilizes. Should an Investigator be made aware of an SAE 
occurring any time after the reporting period, it must be promptly reported. More details on AEs 
can be found in Section  13. 
The Patient Diary will be used for recording investigational product intake during the first two 
cycles. In the case of diarrhea, it also serves to document the number of stools per day and use of 
loperamide/other antidiarrheal treatments taken.  
8.2.1 Laboratory Assessments 
Laboratory testing will be performed in accordance with the Schedule of Procedures 
(Appendix 1).  
The institutional laboratory will analyze all hematology, routine blood chemistry and urine 
samples collected. Samples will be analyzed at a facility meeting Good Laboratory Practice 
requirements and using methods documented in a methods validation report.  
Screening laboratory results may be accepted as the baseline assessment if they are performed 
within 72 hours before randomization and there are no clinically significant findings.

Puma Biotechnology 49 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL All laboratory tests that result in clinically important abnormal results that occur during the study 
will be repeated at appropriate intervals,  until results return either to baseline or to a level 
deemed acceptable by the Investigator  and the Sponsor ’s medical monitor (or his/her designated 
representative), or until a diagnosis that provides an explanation is made.  
Criteria for reporting abnormal laboratory values as AEs are summarized in Section  13.1.2. 
The total volume of blood collected from each patient during the course of the study will be 
dependent upon the number of treatment cycles a patient completes. Approximately 17 mL of 
blood will be collected during screening and 15 mL  of blood will be collected at subsequent 
visits (plus 6 mL at each of two visits during Cycle 1 if PK samples are collected). 
8.2.1.1 Immunohistochemistry and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization Testing of HER2 and 
ER/PR Status 
Tumor samples will be evaluated for HER2 expression by IHC (HercepTest™) and if required 
for gene amplification by FISH analysis (IQFISH pharmDx™) as below.  
 If IHC 3+, no further testing required to confirm HER2+ status. 
 If IHC 2+, further testing required by FISH to confirm HER2+ status.  
 If IHC 0 or 1+, sample is considered negative for HER2 status and no further testing will 
be conducted. 
Either primary breast cancer tissue (e.g.,  from prior surgical resection) or other breast cancer-
containing tissue (e.g., from biopsy or excision of cancer-containing lymph node or metastatic 
lesion) is acceptable for central HER2 testing. Further, breast cancer-containing specimens 
submitted for central HER2 testing may have been obtained at any time in the patient’s breast 
cancer treatment history, including the period before the development of metastatic disease. 
Wherever possible tissue from the time of recurrence or metastasis should be submitted. 
If there is not enough tissue available, and the IHC result is 2+ and there is no FISH result, or the 
IHC and FISH both fail to give a result, the site will be asked to ship another sample for re-
testing.  
Patients may have a fresh tissue biopsy in order to assess eligibility if there is no available tissue 
for central HER2 testing or i f the available tissue (regardless of whether from primary lesion or 
metastatic site, and regardless of when it was obtained in their disease course) cannot be 
confirmed to have been fixed with formalin as the fixative.  
ER/PR status will be determined using a pharmDx™ kit.

Puma Biotechnology 57 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL 10 PATIENT WITHDRAWAL AND REPLACEMENT 
10.1 Investigational Product Discontinuation 
Withdrawal due to an AE should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes and 
recorded on the appropriate AE CRF page.  
If one of the two investigational products given in combination has been discontinued, patients 
may continue to receive the other investigational product as monotherapy, at the Investigator’s 
discretion. This is applicable to both treatment arms of the study. Reintroduction of the 
discontinued investigational product at a later time during the active treatment phase is not 
permitted. 
Patients must be discontinued from investigational product(s)  (but may remain in the study, if 
appropriate) under the circumstances listed below and in Appendix 2, unless otherwise agreed 
with the Medical Monitor. 
 If the patient requires more than two dose reductions of the investigational product(s) 
(see Appendix 2 ). 
 If investigational product(s) is withheld due to an AE for >28 days. 
 Disease progression. 
 Initiation of alternative anti-cancer therapy. Any concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy 
(including palliative radiotherapy), surgery related to cancer, anticancer immunotherapy, or 
other anticancer treatments including other investigational agents, megestrol and hormonal 
agents are prohibited (see Section  7.3). 
 Pregnancy (see Section  13.4). 
 Investigator request. 
 Patient request (i.e., withdrawal of consent for treatment). 
10.2 Withdrawal from the Study 
Patients may withdraw from the entire study, including follow- up, at any time without penalty 
and for any reason without prejudice to his or her future medical care. Study withdrawal may 
occur for the following reasons:  
 At the discretion of the Investigator. 
 At the patient’s request (withdrawal of consent for the study).  
Neratinib Tablets (PB- 272) 13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 58 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL  Lost to follow-up (defined as three failed attempts to contact by phone,  followed by one 
attempt by sending a certified letter). 
 If the entire study is terminated prematurely as described in Section  11. 
A patient may also be withdrawn from  investigational product/study  by the Sponsor, 
Regulatory Authorities, or Independent Ethics Committees (IEC)/IRBs.  
10.3 Procedures for Patient Withdrawal 
When a patient is withdrawn from the study, the Investigator will notify the Sponsor. In all cases, 
the reason(s) for premature discontinuation/withdrawal and the primary reason must be recorded 
on the CRF. If a patient is prematurely withdrawn from the investigational product or the study 
for any reason, the Investigator must make every effort to perform the evaluations described for 
the TD visit, the safety follow-up contact 28 days later,  and a follow-up visit 12 weeks later. If a 
patient discontinues due to an AE, he/she should continue to be under medical supervision until 
symptoms cease or the condition becomes stable. 
If a patient withdraws consent but agrees to undergo a final examination, this will be documented 
on the CRF and the Investigator’s copy of the ICF, which will be countersigned and dated by the 
patient.  
If a patient is lost to follow-up  or voluntarily withdraws from study participation, every effort 
should be made to determine why the patient was lost to follow-up or withdrew consent. This 
information, including the date, should also be recorded on the patient's conclusion of patient 
participation CRF. 
All patients will remain on active study treatment until treatment or study discontinuation, death, 
or withdrawal of consent. Upon confirmed disease progression, or discontinuation of randomly 
assigned investigational product for any other reason, all further anti-cancer treatment will be at 
the Investigator’s discretion.  All patients will remain in the long-term follow-up phase for 
survival unless consent has been withdrawn or until death.

The statistical considerations summarized in this section outline the plan for data analysis of this 
study. Additional details of the analysis will be provided in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), 
which will be finalized prior to unblinding the data. Any deviations from the protocol or 
SAP-specified analyses will be identified in the clinical study report.  
A final PFS analysis will be conducted when 419 PFS events have occurred and a final OS 
analysis will be conducted when 378 deaths have occurred. An interim analysis of OS will be 
conducted at the time of the final PFS analysis.  
12.1 General Considerations 
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the intent to treat (ITT) population,  defined 
as all patients randomized into the study. Formal definitions of the analyses populations are 
provided in the SAP. 
12.2 Study Patients

be summarized. 
12.2.2 Demographics, Medical History, Baseline Characteristics, and Concomitant 
Medications 
Demographic data, medical history, baseline characteristics including predictive and prognostic 
biomarkers, concomitant disease, and concomitant medication will be summarized by means of 
descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) or 
frequency tables, overall and stratified by treatment.  
12.2.3 Treatment Compliance 
Duration of treatment will be summarized separately for each investigational product by 
treatment group. In addition, the cumulative quantity, dose intensity (quantity per time unit) and 
the relative dose intensity (dose intensity/scheduled dose per time unit) will be summarized. The 
number of patients with dose holds or dose reductions will be tabulated for each investigational 
product by treatment group.

Puma Biotechnology 61 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL 12.3 Efficacy Analyses 
12.3.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The co-primary endpoints are independently adjudicated PFS and OS. PFS is defined as disease 
progression demonstrated by radiographic imaging or other appropriate modality, or death due to 
any cause. Tumor evaluations will be performed by a central review vendor.  
Patients will be stratified at randomization by whether they had 2 or ≥3 prior HER2+ MBC 
regimens in the metastatic setting,  their geographic region (North America vs. Europe including 
Israel vs. Rest of World), disease category (visceral vs. non-visceral only), and hormone receptor 
status (ER and/or PR positive vs. ER and PR negative). All efficacy endpoints will be 
summarized by treatment group and visit when appropriate. 
The efficacy assessment in PFS will be assessed by a blinded, independent, central review of 
tumor assessments for all patients at screening, and then after every 6 weeks from first dose of 
investigational product, regardless of treatment schedule modification (e.g., dose delay), until 
documented disease progression or death. PFS will be independently-assessed using 
RECIST v1.1.  
Missed tumor assessments must be performed as soon as possible. Patients who discontinue from 
study treatment for a reason other than radiographically confirmed (or confirmation by other 
appropriate modality) objective disease progression will have radiological tumor assessments 
performed approximately every 6 weeks from the date of the last tumor assessment until 
documented disease progression or death. 
Survival data will be collected throughout the active treatment phase and during the long term 
follow-up phase. Survival follow-up after patient discontinuation of investigational product will 
be conducted approximately every 12 weeks to assess for survival until patient ’s death, 
withdrawal of consent,  or the EOS.  
12.3.1.1 Statistical Methods 
When 419 PFS events have occurred the primary PFS analysis will be performed. The median 
time to PFS and corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals will be calculated using the 
product limit estimator and displayed using a Kaplan-Meier graph, by treatment group. A 
log-rank test controlling for hormone receptor status, number of prior HER2-directed regimens 
in the metastatic setting, visceral disease, and geographic region strata will be used to test the 
null hypothesis of no difference in the time to PFS between the two treatment groups at the alpha 
level of 0.01. Subjects who discontinue therapy early will be censored at their last available time 
point. Sensitivity analyses will be performed to investigate the impact of differential dropout 
between the two treatment groups on the treatment effect estimate.

PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 62 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL When the PFS analysis is performed, an interim analysis will be performed on the OS endpoint. 
When 378 deaths have occurred, primary OS analysis (final analysis)  will be performed. The 
median time to PFS and corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals will be calculated 
using the product limit estimator and displayed using a Kaplan-Meier graph, by treatment group. 
A log-rank test controlling for hormone receptor status, number of prior HER2-directed regimens 
in the metastatic setting, visceral disease status, and geographic region strata will be used to test 
the null hypothesis of no difference in the hazard between the two treatment groups at the alpha 
level of 0.002 at the interim analysis and 0.038 for the final analysis.   
12.3.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
The secondary efficacy endpoints include Investigator-assessed PFS, ORR, DOR, and CBR (CR, 
PR or SD ≥24 weeks).  
The secondary efficacy assessments include: 
 The comparison of clinically relevant improvements in breast cancer patients with respect 
to radiographic changes or changes in other appropriate modalities, including ORR, DOR 
and CBR (CR or PR or SD ≥24 weeks). 
 In addition, time to onset of symptomatic metastatic CNS disease and the quality of life 
instruments EORTC QLQ-C30, BR23, and EuroQol EQ-5D- 5L will be analyzed. 
12.3.2.1 Statistical Methods 
The treatment difference in the secondary efficacy endpoints of ORR and CBR will be analyzed 
using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel (CMH) Chi-square test, stratified by hormone receptor status, 
number of prior HER2-directed regimens in the metastatic setting, geographic region,  and 
disease state (visceral vs. non-visceral only). The treatment difference in the secondary efficacy 
endpoints of DOR  and PFS from Investigator-assessed PD will be analyzed using a product limit 
estimate of the median time to event. Differences between treatment groups will be examined 
using a log-rank test statistic stratified by hormone receptor status, number of prior HER2-
directed regimens in the metastatic setting,  visceral disease status, and geographic region strata 
(similar to the analysis for the primary endpoints ). All time- to-event endpoints, including time to 
intervention for symptomatic CNS disease, will be displayed using a Kaplan-Meier survival plot. 
Health outcomes assessments (EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-BR23 and EQ-5D- 5L) will be 
analyzed using a random effects mixed model with treatment, time, number of prior HER2-
directed regimens in the metastatic setting (binary), geographic region, disease category, and the 
treatment by time interaction. Endpoints that could be affected by missing values (e.g., health 
outcomes assessments) will be analyzed using a sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of 
missing values in the results.

Puma Biotechnology 63 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL 12.4 Safety Analyses 
Patients receiving at least 1 dose of investigational product will be evaluable for safety.  
12.4.1 Investigational Product Exposu re 
Extent of
 exposure to each investigational product will be summarized by total dose, number of 
cycles, number of missed doses, number of dose delays, number of dose reductions. 
12.4.2 Adverse Events 
Safety will be assessed based on medical history, vital sign measurements, physical examination 
findings, ECG results, MUGA or ECHO, liver function test results, ECOG performance status, 
and laboratory assessments. Adverse events and SAEs will be reported until 28 days after the last 
dose of investigational product(s) and will be followed until resolution or until condition 
stabilizes. Should an Investigator be made aware of any SAE occurring any time after the 
reporting period, it must be promptly reported.  
All safety endpoints will be summarized by treatment group and visit when appropriate. Adverse 
events and SAEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) coding system v.15 or later and will be tabulated by system organ class (SOC) and 
preferred term. All AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE  v.4.0. Differences in the 
incidence of the most common AEs and SAEs between the two treatment groups will be 
investigated using a CMH chi-square test, stratified on hormone receptor status, prior number of 
HER2-directed regimens in the metastatic setting, geographic region, and visceral or non-
visceral only disease.  
A patient who experiences the same AE more than once within a SOC or preferred term category 
will be counted only once, using the worst toxicity grade for that event.  
Serious adverse events and deaths will be provided in a listing.  Treatment-emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) leading to treatment discontinuation, dose modification, dose hold, and/or delay 
of investigational product will be tabulated by SOC, PT, and treatment group. 
12.4.3 Laboratory Results 
Laboratory test results will be collected pretreatment and on day 1 of each treatment cycle until 
the TD visit. Standard reference ranges will be used for missing or discrepant normal ranges. 
Mean change from baseline in laboratory test values at each visit will be provided. On -study 
laboratory test abnormalities will be summarized. Shifts in laboratory test values will also be 
summarized.

Puma Biotechnology 64 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL 12.5 Other Analyses 
12.5.1 PK analysis 
A population PK study, with sparse sampling at a subset of study sites, will be included in the 
study to assess the variability of neratinib concentrations when administered in combination with 
capecitabine among individuals in the target patient population. Blood samples will be collected 
as specified in Appendix 1, and they will be processed and stored until analysis.  
Concentrations of neratinib will be measured in plasma with a validated assay method. 
NONMEM, a statistical software program that uses non-linear, mixed effects models to 
determine PK parameters (clearance and volume of distribution), the inter- and intra-patient 
variability and the population variability in the parameter estimates will be used for this analysis. 
Random sources of error, intrinsic factors (e.g., age, sex, race, body weight, liver function and 
renal function) and extrinsic factors (e.g., capecitabine, diarrhea frequency, smoking status) will 
be evaluated to identify factors that contribute to the observed variability in the PK parameter 
estimates.  
The concentrations in this study will be used in the development of a structural model,  and it will 
include results from other neratinib studies that included intensive sampling. The best model will 
be evaluated by goodness of fit statistics, reduction in the objective function and posterior 
predictive checks. 
A population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis of neratinib efficacy and tolerability 
endpoints will be performed in this patient population. The final PK model will be used to 
generate post-hoc neratinib patient-level plasma PK profiles, from which patient-level neratinib 
area under the curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (C max) exposure metrics will be 
estimated. Neratinib dose and estimated AUC and C max exposure metrics will then be used to 
complete an exploratory data analysis of potential exposure-response relationships for efficacy 
and safety endpoints. 
12.5.2 Health Outcomes Assessments 
Health outcomes assessments will include the EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-BR23 and the 
EQ-5D-5L. Questionnaires will be completed by patients at time points specified in  Appendix 1.  
12.6 Interim Analyses 
No interim PFS analysis for early stopping is planned. An interim OS analysis will be performed 
at the time of final PFS analysis.  
Neratinib Tablets (PB- 272) 13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 65 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL The Lan-DeMets alpha spending function approach will be used to adjust the O’Brien-Fleming 
boundary if the timing based on the final PFS analysis does not correspond to the expected 
information time of half of the OS events ( DeMets and Gordon Lan 1994 ; Cook 2003 ).  
The hazard rate in the control arm for survival will be assessed to determine if the sample size or 
duration of follow-up or both should be adjusted to ensure timely achievement of the required 
378 death events. 
12.7 Determination of Sample Size 
The co-primary endpoints will be analyzed using an overall Type I error rate of 0.01 for PFS and 
0.04 for OS. To detect a hazard ratio (control versus treatment) of 0.70 with approximately 85% 
power, 419 PFS events (PD/deaths) are required to be observed; this assumes a median (ITT ) 
PFS of 8.0 months (34.7 weeks) for the experimental arm (neratinib plus capecitabine) and 
5.6 months (24.3 weeks) for the control arm (lapatinib plus capecitabine). It is expected that the 
419th event will be observed at approximately 26 months after the first patient is enrolled, which 
would correspond to approximately half of the death events needed to be observed. At this time, 
an interim analysis on OS will also be performed. For the OS endpoint, a group sequential 
method will be employed to maintain the overall Type I error rate at 0.04. Specifically, O’Brien-
Fleming boundaries will be calculated to create appropriate critical values to which the log rank 
statistic will be compared.

These boundaries are designed to detect a hazard ratio (control versus treatment) of 0.725 with 
approximately 85% power.  Overall, 37 8 events (deaths) are required to be observed; this 
assumes a median (ITT) OS of 30.3 months for the experimental arm (neratinib plus 
c
apecitabine) and 22.0 months for the control arm (lapatinib plus capecitabine). Approximately 
600 patients will be enrolled and randomized equally between the two treatment arms.

Puma Biotechnology 66 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL 13 SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING AND REPORTING 
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or causal relationship to 
investigational product will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF. 
13.1 Definitions 
13.1.1 Adverse Events 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in a patient or clinical investigation 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product 
(definition per International Conference on Harmonisation [ICH] E2A and E6 R1). 
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to study therapy, must be 
recorded using medical terminology on the AE CRF page. Whenever possible, diagnoses should 
be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (e.g., cough, runny nose, 
sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as “upper respiratory infection”). 
All measures required for AE management must be recorded in the source document and 
reported according to Sponsor instructions. 
For all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate to both determine the 
outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a SAE 
(see Section on SAEs) requiring immediate notification to the Sponsor or its designated 
representative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the Investigator to 
determine the causality of the AE.  
Interventions for pretreatment conditions (e.g., elective cosmetic surgery) or medical procedures 
that were planned before study enrollment are not considered AE. 
TEAEs are those events that occur or worsen on or after first dose of investigational product and 
up to 28 days after the last dose.  
13.1.2 Abnormal Laboratory Results 
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal laboratory test result should be reported as an 
AE are as follows: 
 Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or, 
Neratinib Tablets (PB- 272) 13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 67 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL  Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention (merely 
repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not meet 
criteria for reporting and an AE), and/or 
 Test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, significant 
additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy, and/or 
 Test result leads to any of the outcomes included in the definition of a SAE, and/or, 
 Test result is considered to be an AE by the Investigator or by the Sponsor 
Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE, 
even if it did meet one of the above criteria except for when the test result leads to any of the 
outcomes included in the definition of a SAE. Clinically significant laboratory results must be 
recorded in the patient’s CRF. 
13.1.3 Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose (ICH E2A and E6 R1): 
 Results in death. 
 Is life-threatening. 
This means that the patient is at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not mean that 
the event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical event(s) that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but that may jeopardize the patient or require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should 
also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE or SAE term; instead, signs and symptoms 
of clinical sequelae resulting from disease progression will be reported if they fulfill the SAE 
definition. 
Neratinib Tablets (PB- 272) 13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 68 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL 13.1.4 Hospitalization 
Any inpatient hospital admission that includes a minimum of an overnight stay to a healthcare 
facility meets the criteria for ‘hospitalization’. Admission also includes transfer within the 
hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (e.g., from the psychiatric wing to a medical floor, 
medical floor to a coronary care unit, neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit). 
The following are not considered to be hospitalization: 
 Rehabilitation facilities. 
 Hospice facilities. 
 Respite care (e.g., caregiver relief). 
 Skilled nursing facilities. 
 Nursing homes. 
 Routine emergency room admissions. 
 Same day surgeries (as outpatient /same day/ambulatory procedures). 
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical AE is 
not in itself a SAE. Examples include:  
 Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the development of 
a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (e.g., for work-up of persistent 
pre-treatment lab abnormality). 
 Social admission (e.g., patient has no place to sleep). 
 Administrative admission (e.g., for yearly physical examination). 
 Protocol-specified admission during a study (e.g., for a procedure required by the study 
protocol). 
 Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE (e.g., for elective 
cosmetic surgery). 
 Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE. 
 Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline 
documentation or the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient. 
 Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products. 
Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be 
reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should 
Neratinib Tablets (PB- 272) 13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 69 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis that begins 
during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting appendectomy 
should be recorded as treatment of the AE. 
13.1.5 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR) are events which are serious as per 
the above criteria, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product 
information (e.g., current Investigator’s Brochure) and are judged by the Investigator or by the 
Sponsor to be related to investigational product. For a non-Sponsored investigational product 
(e.g., a comparator product) with a marketing authorization, the expectedness of an AE will be 
determined by whether or not it is listed in the package insert/ SPC. 
13.1.6 Severity Assessment 
Adverse events will be graded by the Investigator according to the NCI CTCAE v.4.03 (Publish 
Date: June 14, 2010, http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html), according to the following 
ge
neral categories: 
Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living.  
Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; 
limiting self -care activities of daily living.  
Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5: Death related to AE.  
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not 
necessarily a serious event. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with 
patient's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it meets one of the criteria 
for SAEs, listed above. 
13.1.7 Causality Assessment 
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the Investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF and report such an 
assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements, if applicable. A 
Neratinib Tablets (PB- 272) 13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 70 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
investigational product caused the AE. An Investigator’s causality assessment is the 
determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product 
caused or contributed to an AE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship should be provided. If the Investigator does not know whether or not the 
investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to 
investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined by the Sponsor (see Section on 
Reporting Requirements). If the Investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related 
to investigational product”, this should be clearly documented on study records. 
For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the Investigator to determine the 
causality of the AE (e.g., investigational product or other illness). The relationship of the AE to 
the study treatment (investigational product, comparator or placebo [as applicable]) will be 
assessed following the definitions below: 
 ‘No’ (unrelated): Any event that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of investigational product AND is likely to have been produced by the 
patient’s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the patient. 
 ‘Yes’ (related): Any reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of investigational product AND follows a known response pattern to the 
suspected investigational product AND recurs with re-challenge, AND/OR is improved by 
stopping the investigational product or reducing the dose. 
In addition, if the Investigator determines an AE is associated with study procedures, the 
Inv
estigator must record this causal relationship on the AE CRF page and report such an 
assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable. 
13.1.8 Special Reporting Situations 
Safety events of interest on the Sponsor ’s investigational product that may require expedited 
reporting and/or safety evaluation include, but are not limited to: 
 Overdose of an investigational product. 
 Suspected abuse/misuse of an investigational product. 
 Inadvertent or accidental exposure to an investigational product. 
 Medication error that may result from the administration or consumption of the wrong 
drug, by the wrong patient, at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength. 
 Suspected transmission via an investigational product of an infectious agent. 
Neratinib Tablets (PB- 272) 13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 71 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL Special reporting situations should be recorded on the AE CRF page. Any special reporting 
situation that meets the criteria of a SAE should be recorded on the SAE form and reported a s 
required (see Section 13.3 ). 
13.2 Reporting Adverse Events 
For serious and non-serious AEs, the reporting period to the Sponsor (or its designated 
representative) begins from the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is 
obtained prior to the patient’s participation in the study, i.e., prior to undergoing any 
study-related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through 28 calendar days after 
the last administration of the investigational product.  
For all AEs with causal relationship to the investigational product, follow-up by the Investigator 
may be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at the level acceptable to the 
Investigator, and the Sponsor concurs with that assessment. 
If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AE reporting period for non-serious AEs ends at 
the time the new treatment is started. Death must be reported if it occurs during the SAE 
reporting period after the last dose of investigational product, irrespective of any intervening 
treatment. 
The Sponsor will evaluate any safety information that is spontaneously reported by an 
Investigator beyond the time frame specified in the protocol. 
13.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs, irrespective of relationship to investigational product, must be reported within 
24 hours of discovery or notification of the event to the Sponsor or designated representative 
using the SAE form. The SAE form must be signed by the Investigator. In particular, if the SAE 
is fatal or life-threatening, notification to the Sponsor must be made immediately, irrespective of 
the extent of available AE information. This timeframe also applies to follow-up information on 
previously forwarded SAE reports as well as to the initial and follow-up reporting of exposure 
during pregnancy and exposure via breast feeding cases. For SAE reporting information, please 
refer to the Study Contact List which is provided as a separate document. 
Relevant medical records should be provided to the Sponsor or its designated representative as 
soon as they become available; autopsy reports should be provided for deaths if available.  
Should an Investigator be made aware of an SAE occurring any time after the reporting period, it 
must be promptly reported. 
Neratinib Tablets (PB- 272) 13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 72 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL All SAEs that have not resolved by the end of the study, or that have not resolved upon 
discontinuation of the patient's participation in the study, must be followed until any of the 
following occurs: 
 The event resolves. 
 The event stabilizes. 
 The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available. 
 The event can be attributed to agents other than the investigational product or to factors 
unrelated to study conduct. 
 It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (patient or health care 
practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow-up after demonstration 
of due diligence with follow-up efforts). 
13.4 Pregnancy  
All initial reports of pregnancy must be reported to the Sponsor by the investigational staff 
within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event using the appropriate Exposure- In-Utero (EIU) 
form. 
For investigational products and for marketed products used as investigational product in 
neratinib studies, an exposure during pregnancy occurs if: 
 A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
directly exposed (e.g., environmental exposure) to the investigational product, or the 
female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant after discontinuing and/or being directly 
exposed to the investigational product (maternal exposure) for 28 days after last dose of or 
exposure to investigational product. 
 A male partner of a pregnant female has been exposed to the investigational product, either 
due to treatment or environmental exposure, within 3 months prior to the time of 
conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy (paternal exposure). 
If any study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study patient’s treatment with the investigational product or exposure as defined above, the 
Investigator must submit this information on an EIU form to the Sponsor (or its designated 
representative). In addition, the Investigator must submit information regarding environmental 
exposure to an investigational product in a pregnant woman (e.g., a patient reports that she is 
pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EIU 
form. This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of 
Neratinib Tablets (PB- 272) 13-FEB-2014

Puma Biotechnology 73 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL awareness of the pregnancy. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of 
delivery (see following information related to induced termination of pregnancy). 
Follow-up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information on all exposure during 
pregnancy reports with an unknown outcome. The Investigator will follow the pregnancy until 
completion or until pregnancy termination (e.g., induced abortion) and then notify the Sponsor or 
its designated representative of the outcome as a follow-up to the initial EIU form. In the case of 
a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the 
event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically 
possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual 
inspection (unless pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the 
findings are reported). 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE 
(e.g., ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or 
congenital anomaly [including that in a live born, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, 
or a neonatal death]), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. 
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are classified as SAEs follows:  
 “Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion. 
 All neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to 
causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs 
when the Investigator assesses the neonatal death as related to exposure to investigational 
product. 
Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy may be requested by the 
Investigator. Follow-up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal 
sequelae in the infant will be required. 
13.5 Sponsor Reporting Requirements to Health Authorities and IRB/IEC 
The Sponsor assumes responsibility for reporting of AEs including SUSARs according to local 
and international regulations, as appropriate. The Investigator (or the Sponsor where required) 
must report these events to the appropriate IEC/IRB that approved the protocol unless otherwise 
required and documented by the IEC/IRB.

The Sponsor of this study may delegate some administrative aspects of this study to a duly 
authorized representative including, but not limited to, study initiation, monitoring and 
management of SAE reports. 
14.1 Data Collection, Processing and Monitoring 
14.1.1 Case Report Forms and Source Documentation 
All data captured for the study is planned to be electronic. However, if necessary, data captured 
may be performed using paper CRFs. 
CRFs will be provided by the Sponsor or its representative and should be handled in accordance 
with the instructions provided by the Sponsor or designated representative.  
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining adequate and accurate CRFs which have been 
desig
ned to record all observations and other data pertinent to the clinical investigation. Each 
CRF should be filled out completely by the Investigator or delegate as stated in the Site 
Delegation List.  
If paper CRFs are used, then all CRFs should be completed in a neat legible manner to ensure 
accurate interpretation of the data; a black ball-point pen should be used to ensure the clarity of 
reproduced copies of all CRFs. Incorrect entries should be crossed with a single line. Corrections 
must be made adjacent to the item to be altered, initialed and dated with the reason for the 
correction if necessary, by an authorized (Investigator/co-worker) person.  Overwriting of this 
information or use of liquid correcting fluid is not allowed. 
Once the site monitor has verified the contents of the completed CRF pages against the source 
data, queries may be raised if the data are unclear or contradictory. These queries must be 
addressed by the Investigator and verified by the clinical research associate. After all the data 
issues are resolved, these CRFs may be locked to prevent any further data changes. At the end of 
the study or prior to the site closeout visit, the Investigator will review and approve the data for 
completeness and accuracy.  
14.1.2 Study Monitoring and Access to Source Documentation 
To ensure compliance with relevant regulations, data generated by this study must be available 
for inspection upon request by representatives of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA), other national authorities,  and local health authorities, 
the Sponsor and representatives, and the IRB/  Ethics Committee  (EC) for each study site. The 
Investigator will permit authorized representatives of the Sponsor, the respective national or 
local health authorities and auditors to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study. 
Neratinib Tablets (PB- 272) 13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
 
Puma Biotechnology 75 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL The Sponsor or representative’s monitor is responsible for verifying the CRFs at regular intervals 
throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy and consistency 
of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research. Source data to 
be reviewed and/or during this study will include, but is not restricted to: patient’s medical file, 
patient’s diary (if applicable), and original laboratory test, histology and pathology reports. All 
key data must be recorded in the patient’s hospital notes. 
Auditors, IEC/IRB and/or regulatory inspectors will also have access to the CRFs and source 
documents. The ICF will include a statement by which the patient allows the 
monitor/auditor/inspector from the IEC/IRB or regulatory authority access to source data 
(e.g., patient’s medical file, appointment books, original laboratory test reports, X-rays, etc.) that 
substantiate information in the CRFs. These personnel, bound by professional secrecy, will not 
disclose any personal information or personal drug information. 
14.1.3 Data Monitoring Committee 
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be convened for this study and will act in an advisory 
capacity to the Sponsor with respect to safeguarding the interests of study subjects, assessing 
interim safety and efficacy data, and for monitoring the overall conduct of the study. The 
membership criteria, meeting schedule, and other details of the DMC are described in the DMC 
Charter.  
14.1.4 Data Quality Assurance 
During and/or after completion of the study, quality assurance auditor (s) named by the Sponsor 
or the regulatory authorities may wish to perform on-site audits. The Investigators will be 
expected to cooperate with any audit and provide assistance and documentation (including 
source data) as requested. 
The Sponsor’s representatives are responsible for contacting and visiting the Investigator for the 
purpose of inspecting the facilities and, upon request, inspecting the various records of the 
clinical study (e.g., CRFs and other pertinent data) provided that patient confidentiality is 
respected.

a. Screening activities are to be conducted within 21 days before randomization . Tumor scans (CT and MRI) and ECHO/MUGA must be performed within 
28 days prior to randomization, and preferably no more than 28 days before initiation of treatment. 
Randomization should occur after all baseline assessments have been completed and the site confirms that the patient still meets all eligibility requiremen ts.  
b. Informed consent must be obtained before any screening procedures begin. 
c. Collect demographic information, relevant medical history, medical conditions or symptoms experienced during the previous 30 days as well as those 
ongoing at the time of screening, any medical conditions that require medication, and all prior cancer therapies. Identify the start of current medical 
conditions by at least the month/year; identify the start of significant preexisting conditions by at least the year .  
d. Full physical exam at screening and brief physical exams at all subsequent time points to assess changes from the screening exam. 
Neratinib Tablets (PB-272)  13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
Puma Biotechnology  93 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL e. Baseline physical exam, vital signs, ECOG status, laboratory assessments, and health outcomes assessments must all be done within 72 hours prior to 
randomization. However, if screening laboratory assessments and ECOG status were performed within 72 hours before randomization and there were no 
clinically significant findings, these procedures do not need to be repeated. 
f. Vital signs include pulse, blood pressure (after 5 min rest), and temperature (°C or °F; oral, core [rectal], axillary or tympanic); also measure height 
(screening only) and weight.  
g. ECGs should be performed at Cycle 3/Day 1, Cycle 6/Day 1 and Day 1 of every 6th subsequent cycle during the active treatment phase . ECG should also be 
performed at Treatment Discontinuation if not done within the previous 12 weeks. Patients using drugs known to cause QT/QTc prolongation should be 
monitored closely with serial ECGs at the Investigator’s discretion. Refer to Appendix 6  for a summary of drugs known to have a risk of causing QT/QTc 
prolongation, potentially causing Torsade de Pointes (TdP). 
h. For LVEF during the active treatment phase , MUGA/ECHO should be repeated at Cycle 3/Day 1, Cycle 6/Day 1 and Day 1 of every 6th subsequent cycle . 
MUGA/ECHO should also be performed at Treatment Discontinuation if not done within the previous 12 weeks.  
i. Timing for tumor assessments and health outcomes assessments (EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-BR23 and EQ- 5D-5L) at the end of every 6 weeks 
(±3 days)  is intended to reflect the end of every second cycle of study treatment. However, if cycles move off schedule for any reason, these assessments 
should remain every 6 weeks starting from Cycle 1/Day 1 during the active treatment phase. Tumor assessments will continue every 6 weeks until 
documented disease progression or death, regardless of whether the patient is continuing study treatment or has discontinued study treatment . The scans 
must be obtained and reviewed prior to start of the next cycle. For patients who show a CR on one scan and on a confirmatory scan obtained 6 weeks later, 
the frequency of subsequent scans may be reduced at the discretion of the investigator to no less than one scan every 12 weeks. 
j. Serious adverse events (SAEs) must be reported starting at the time of signing informed consent. All AEs including SAEs must be reported from initiation of 
study treatment and must continue to be followed for 28 days after last administration of investigational product.  
k. Cancer therapies evaluated at the safety follow-up contact and at the long-term follow-up contact include anti-cancer medications, cancer-related 
radiotherapy and cancer-related surgery/procedures since last contact. 
l. Tumor testing for HER2 gene amplification or overexpression will be performed by a central laboratory using HercepTest™ and possibly FISH analysis 
using IQFISH pharmDx™. ER/PR status will be determined using pharmDx™ kit. Either primary breast cancer tissue (e.g., from prior surgical resection) or 
other breast cancer-containing tissue (e.g., from biopsy or excision of cancer-containing lymph node or metastatic lesion) is acceptable for central HER2 
testing (see Section 8.2.1.1).  
m. If
 a pregnancy test needs to be repeated during screening, a urine pregnancy test will suffice. 
n. Hematology panel: differentials (basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils), hematocrit, hemoglobin (Hb), international normalized ratio 
(INR), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), platelet count, 
prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), red blood cell count (RBC), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), white blood cell 
count (WBC) with differential. 
o. Serum chemistry includes at least the following: albumin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total 
bilirubin, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), calcium, chloride, creatinine, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), magnesium, phosphorous, 
potassium, total protein, and sodium. Creatinine clearance will be calculated by the Cockroft-Gault  Formula or Modification of Diet in Renal Disease 
(MDRD) formula ( Levey et al., 1999 ) within 14 days of enrollment.

Puma Biotechnology  94 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL p. Urinalysis by dipstick (blood, protein, glucose, and microscopic examination, if abnormal). 
q. Post-treatment disease assessment by CT scan or MRI of the chest, abdomen and pelvis will be conducted every 6 weeks (±3 days). Tumor assessments will 
continue every 6 weeks until documented disease progression or death, regardless of whether the patient is continuing or has discontinued study treatment. 
Overall response will be scored by the Investigator according to RECIST v1.1 using the algorithms defined in Appendix 7 . For patients who show a CR on 
one scan and on a confirmatory scan obtained 6 weeks later, the frequency of subsequent scans may be reduced at the discretion of the investigator to no less 
than one scan every 12 weeks. 
r. Long-term follow- up for survival status will occur via telephone call if the site is unable to confirm via chart review. 
s. Antidiarrheal treatment should be dispensed with the initial supply of neratinib. 
t. At select study centers only: PK samples should be collected on Cycle 1, Day 1 and Day 15, at 6 hours post-dose (±20 minutes) and 8 hours post-dose 
(±60 minutes). Patients should be instructed to record the exact minute that the dose was taken on these day s. PK samples will be taken from approximately 
100 patients on the neratinib arm (Arm A).

Liver Toxicity 
Guidelines for dose adjustment of neratinib  and capecitabine  in the event of liver toxicity are 
shown in Table A2. 4. 
Abnormal values in ALT concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin that meet the 
criteria outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential 
cases of drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should always be considered 
important medical events. 
Patients who experience Grade ≥3 diarrhea requiring IV fluid treatment or any signs or 
symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as worsening of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
pain or tenderness, fever, rash or eosinophilia should be evaluated for changes in liver function 
tests. Fractionated bilirubin and PT must also be collected during hepatotoxicity evaluation.

(potential Hy’s law indicators of 
drug-induced liver damage)   Hold neratinib  and capecitabine . 
The patient should return to the investigational site and be evaluated 
as soon as possible, preferably within 48 hours from awareness of 
the abnormal results. This evaluation should include laboratory tests, 
detailed history and physical assessment and for oncology studies, 
the possibility of hepatic neoplasm (primary or secondary) should be 
considered. In additio n to repeating AST and ALT, laboratory tests 
should include albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, PT and 
alkaline phosphatase. A detailed history, including relevant 
information, such as review of ethanol, concomitant medications, 
recreational drug a nd supplement consumption, family history, 
sexual history, travel history, history of contact with a jaundiced 
patient, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic 
disease, and work exposure, should be collected. Further testing for 
acute hepa titis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging ( e.g., biliary 
tract) may be warranted. All cases confirmed on repeat testing as 
meeting the criteria mentioned above ( i.e., ALT >3 x ULN 
associated with bilirubin >2  x ULN and alkaline phosphatase 
<2 x ULN), wi th no other cause for liver function test abnormalities 
identified at the time should be considered potential Hy’s Law cases , 
irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations 
performed to determine etiology of the abnormal liver functi on tests. 
Such potential Hy’s Law cases should be reported as SAEs.  
 Contact the Sponsor immediately to discuss next steps, including 
evaluation of alternative causes, and management of investigational 
product. 
 These events must be reported as SAEs.  
Abbreviations: ALT: alanine aminotransferase; AST: aspartate aminotransferase; BID: twice daily; PT: prothrombin

If a patient has a second episode of asymptomatic decline in LVEF that meets either of the above 
criteria, permanently discontinue neratinib , repeat LVEF in 3-4  weeks and consider cardiology 
consult. 
Note that, for AEs other than asymptomatic LVEF decline, if neratinib  is held for >28 days, the 
patient should be withdrawn from the active treatment phase of the study (see Section 10.1). In 
case of asymptomatic LVEF decline, patients may resume neratinib  within 1 week after LVEF 
recovery is documented as above, even if the timeframe exceeds 3 weeks. If a site does not 
provide normal ranges for ECHO or MUGA, a LLN of 50% should be used.

RECIST v1.1 Criteria (Eisenhauer et al., 2009 ) 
Patient Eligibility 
Only patients with measurable disease at baseline should be included in this study. Changes in 
only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the 
RECIST v1.1 criteria.  
Note: Lesions are either measurable or nonmeasurable using the criteria provided below. The 
term “evaluable” in reference to measurability provides neither additional meaning nor accuracy 
and will not be used. 
Measurable Disease 
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 
 10 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)  

 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be accurately measured 
with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable). 
 20 mm by chest X-ray. 
Nonmeasurable Disease 
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes 
with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis) as well as truly non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly 
non-measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, 
inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable by 
reproducible imaging techniques. 
Target Lesions 
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of five 
lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs 
should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline (this means 
in instances where patients have only one or two organ sites involved a maximum of two and 
four lesions respectively will be recorded). Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their 
size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition 
should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. Target and/or non-
target lesions should be selected from organs/sites that have not received local/focal therapy 
Neratinib Tablets (PB-272)  13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
Puma Biotechnology 115 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL (e.g., radiation therapy or radiofrequency ablation), unless disease progression has subsequently 
been radiologically confirmed after focal/local therapy. It may be the case that, on occasion, the 
largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next 
largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. Lymph nodes merit 
special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be visible by imaging 
even if not involved by tumor. Pathological nodes which are defined as  measurable and may be 
identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥15 mm by CT scan. Only 
the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. The short axis of the node is the 
diameter normally used by radiologists to judge if a node is involved by solid tumor. Nodal size 
is normally reported as two dimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT scan 
this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal or 
coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For example, an abdominal node which 
is reported as being 20 mm x 30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, 
measurable node. In this example, 20 mm should be recorded as the node measurement. All other 
pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥10 mm but <15 mm) should be considered non-target 
lesions. Nodes that have a short axis <10 mm are considered non-pathological and should not be 
recorded or followed. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal 
lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If 
lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into 
the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any 
objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
Non-Target Lesions 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ 
(more details to follow). In addition, it is possible to record multiple nontarget lesions involving 
the same organ as a single item on the case record form (e.g., ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph 
nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’). 
Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All 
baseline evaluations must be performed within 28 days prior to randomization, and preferably no 
more than 28 days before the initiation of treatment. 
Method of assessment 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging based evaluation should 
Neratinib Tablets (PB-272)  13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
Puma Biotechnology 116 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by clinical exam. 
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by color photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is 
suggested. As noted above, when lesions can be evaluated by both clinical exam and imaging, 
imaging evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at 
the end of the study. 
Chest X-ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particularly when progression is an 
important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X-ray, particularly in identifying new 
lesions. However, lesions on chest X-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  
CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected 
for response assessment. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. When CT scans have slice thickne ss 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. 
MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g., for body scans).  
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for 
independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the 
next. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or 
MRI is advised. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of 
CT in selected instances. 
Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not 
advised. However, they can be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies 
are obtained or to determine relapse in studies where recurrence following CR or surgical 
resection is an endpoint. 
Tumor markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response. If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, however, they must normalize for a patient to 
be considered in CR. Because tumor markers are disease specific, instructions for their 
measurement should be incorporated into protocols on a disease specific basis. Specific 
guidelines for both CA-125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in 
recurrent prostate cancer), have been published.  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup 
Neratinib Tablets (PB-272)  13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
Puma Biotechnology 117 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL has developed CA125 progression criteria which are to be integrated with objective tumor 
assessment for use in first-line studies in ovarian cancer. 
Cytology, histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare 
cases if required by protocol (for example, residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell 
tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). When effusions are known to be a 
potential adverse effect of treatment (e.g., with certain taxane compounds or angiogenesis 
inhibitors), the cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment can be considered if the measurable tumor has met criteria for response 
or SD in order to differentiate between response (or SD) and PD. 
Evaluation of target lesions 
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor response 
for target lesions. 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters. 
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression). 
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. 
Evaluation of non-target lesions 
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for the 
group of non-target lesions. 
While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and 
instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in the protocol. 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis). 
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits. 
Neratinib Tablets (PB-272)  13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
Puma Biotechnology 118 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. (Note: the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).

Abbreviations: CR: complete response; NE: not evaluated; PD: progressive disease; PR: partial response; SD: stable 
disease. 
Note: Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
investigational product without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
classified as having “symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progression, even after discontinuation of investigational product. In some 
circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When the 
evaluation of CR depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be 
investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) before confirming the CR status. 
Confirmatory Measurement/Duration of Response 
Confirmation 
In non-randomized studies where response is the primary endpoint, confirmation of PR and CR 
is required to ensure responses identified are not the result of measurement error. This will also 
permit appropriate interpretation of results in the context of historical data where response has 
traditionally required confirmation in such studies. However, in all other circumstances, i.e., in 
randomized studies (phase II or III) or studies where SD or progression are the primary 
endpoints, confirmation of response is not required since it will not add value to the 
interpretation of study results. However, elimination of the requirement for response 
confir
mation may increase the importance of central review to protect against bias, in particular 
Neratinib Tablets (PB-272)  13-FEB-2014 
PUMA-NER- 1301 Amendment 3 
Puma Biotechnology 119 of 128 CONFIDENTIAL in studies which are not blinded. In the case of SD, measurements must have met the SD criteria 
at least once after study entry at a minimum interval (in general not less than 6–8 weeks) that is 
defined in the study protocol. 
Duration of overall response 
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for 
CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or PD is objectively 
documented (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded on study). The 
duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until 
the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented. 
Duration of stable disease 
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment (in randomized studies, from date of 
randomization) until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum on 
study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the reference for calculation of PD). The clinical 
relevance of the duration of SD varies in different studies and diseases. If the proportion of 
patients achieving SD for a minimum period of time is an endpoint of importance in a particular 
study, the protocol should specify the minimal time interval required between two measurements 
for determination of SD. Note: The DOR and SD as well as the PFS are influenced by the 
frequency of follow-up after baseline evaluation. It is not in the scope of this guideline to define 
a standard follow-up frequency. The frequency should take into account many parameters 
including disease types and stages, treatment periodicity and standard practice. However, these 
limitations of the precision of the measured endpoint should be taken into account if comparisons 
between studies are to be made.

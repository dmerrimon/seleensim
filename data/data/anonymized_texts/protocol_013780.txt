Kidney Disease)
Clinical study phase III
Study objectives The primary objective of this study is to:
Dem onstrate whether, in addition to standard of care (SoC), 
finerenone issuperior to pla cebo in delaying the progression of 
kidney disease, as measured by the composite endpoint of time to first 
occurrence of kidney failure, a sustained decrease of eGFR ≥ 40% from 
baseline over at least 4 w eeks or renal death 
The secondary objectives of this study are to determine whether, in addition 
toSoC, finerenone compared to placebo:
Delays the time to first occurrence of the following composite endpoint: cardiovascular (CV) death or non -fatal CV events 
(i.e.non-fatal myocardial infarction, non -fatal stroke, hospitalization for 
heart failure [HF])
Delays the time to all -cause mortality
Delays the time to all -cause hospitalizations
Change in UACR from baseline to Month 4
Delays the time to first occurrence of the following composite endpoint:
onset of k idney failure, a sustained decrease in eGFR of ≥57% from 
baseline over at least 4 w eeks or renal death.

Study design Randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, multicenter, 
event -driven
Methodology Randomized subjects will be treated w ith finerenone or placebo OD in a 
blinded fashion.  The starting dose of study drug will depend on the subject’s 
eGFR level at the Screening Visit: a lower dose of 10 mg OD i feGFR was 
                                                
1High albuminuria (previously known as ‘micro -albuminuria’) is defined as 300 mg/g > UACR  ≥ 30mg/g in 2outof3first 
morning void samples .
2Very  high albuminuria (previously known as ‘macro -albuminuria’) is defined as UACR  ≥ 300m g/g in 2out of 3 first 
morning void samples .

betw een 25 to < 60 mL /min/1.73m², or the higher (target) dose of 20 mg OD if 
eGFR was ≥60 m L/min/1.73m².  Study drug may be up -titrated from Visit 2 
(Month1) onwards provided potassium is ≤4.8mmo l/L and eGFR decrease is 
less than 30% below  the value last measured.  Down -titration or int erruption of 
study drug is permitted at any time during the study for safety reasons.
Type of control Placebo
Data Monitoring Committee Yes
Number of subjects Planned 9600 subjects screened, 4800 subjects randomized to achieve 
approximately 106 8primary efficacy events
Prim ary variable Time to first occurrence of the composite endpoint of onset of kidney failure, 
asustained decrease of eGFR ≥ 40% from baseline over at least 4 weeks,
orrenal death
Time point/fram e of 
measurement for 
primary va riablesEvents for inclusion in the primary variable (above) w ill be counted from the 
day of randomization (Visit 1) onw ards until the End -of-Study (EOS) visit 
following the study termination decision.  In the case of premature termination 
from the study with no subsequent follow -up information, events will be 
counted up to the day of premature termination
Plan for statistical analysis The log -rank test for the difference of the survival function of finerenone 
compared to placebo, stratified by the strati fication factors region, type of 
albuminuria and eGFR category will be used, a n overall two-sided significance 
level of 5.0% or 3.333% if the CV composite endpoint is not statistically significant according to the weighted Bonferoni -Holm  procedure , with a small 
adjustment for an interim analysis

Protocol amendment summary of changes
Amendment 4 ( 26 FEB 2019)
This amendment is considered to be nonsubstantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 
10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European 
Union because it neither significantl y impacts the safet y or ph ysical/mental integrit y of 
participants nor the scientific value of the stud y.
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:
This amendment summarizes minor changes in the conduct of the study  and planned anal yses. 
The main change is that the PT V isit will be performed as a telephone contact for all patients 
except those participating in the iohex ol clearance sub- study . The PT V isit is to be performed 
within 4 weeks + 5days after last study  drug intake for those patie nts still on treatment at the 
EOS V isit (Sections 9.1, 9.2.10, and 9.2.11). The rationale for the change is that a telephone 
call is considered a dequate to inquire about possible AEs and concomitant medication usage. 
This change neither compromises patient safet y nor scientific value. The performance as a 
telephone contact will minimize the burden on patients, sites, and the sponsor. Procedures tha t 
would require the presence of the patient at the study  site have been adapted accordingly . The 
following activities will no longer be performed: phy sical examination, ECG, recording of 
body  weight and vital signs, and laboratory  sampling.
All other minor changes with their brief rationale are summarized in the table below.
Table 1 Protocol amendment summary of minor changes
Section number 
and nameDescription of change Brief rationale
10.1 General 
considerations
10.3.2 Treatment 
duration, extent of exposure, up -
titration status and complianceSpecification of baseline values .This was added to clarify the handling of 
subjects who did not immediately start 
with study drug treatment at 
randomization , because all analyses 
follow the intent- to-treat principle.
10.1 General 
considerations
10.3.3.2 Primary 
efficacy  variable: 
supportiveFor on-treatment efficacy  
analyses, the time window after last study  drug administration is 
increased from 3 to 30 days .The time window was increased to better 
reflect the mo reprotracted nature of the 
development and diagnosis of clinical 
outcome events of interest in relation to 
treatment exposure .

Section number 
and nameDescription of change Brief rationale
10.3.4 Provision of more precise 
wording about the type of discontinuation .Considering the nature of the underlying disease and the long duration of the 
study, it is the impact of permanent 
discontinuation of the study drug that is of particular interest.
10.3.4.1 Adverse 
eventsNew definition of treatment -
emergent AEs .The definition of TEAEs was specified to account for permitted study drug 
interruptions (i.e. temporary 
discontinuations) which may occur over extended periods.
10.3.4.2 Laborator y 
dataSpecification regarding interruption of study treatment .This was updated to consider treatment interruptions in a similar manner as done 
for the AE presentation.
10.3.3.5.2 
Decrease in 
eGFR
10.3.4.2 Laborator y 
dataDeletion of the following 
analyses:
Absolute value of serum 
potassium >5.0 mmol/L
Relative decrease from 
baseline in eGFR of ≥25%
Increase from baseline in serum creatinine >0.3 mg/dL 
and >0.5 mg/dLPatients remain on study  drug treatment
with potassium values up to 5.5 mmol/L. 
Safety specific information will be 
obtained by analyzing the remaining 
thresholds of >5.5mmol/L (moderate 
hyperkalemia) and >6.0 mmol/L (severe 
hyperkalemia) for serum potassium .
In this long -term trial r elative eGFR 
decrease from baseline ≥ 25% does not 
provid e clinically relevant information. The 
same applies to analy ses of change in 
serum creatinine, which is already incorporated in the currently planned 
analyses of change in eGFR.
Throughout Section 
10 Statistical 
methods and 
determination of sample sizeMore precise wording . Specifications changed for correctness.
Where applicable Minor editorial and t ypographical 
errors , updated information on 
responsible persons.Unsubstantial changes for correctness.

3. Introduction
3.1 Background
Diabetic kidney  disease (DKD) is the most frequent cause of end -stage renal disease (ESRD) 
in western countries (1). In addition, the risk of cardiovascular (C V) disease and death 
increases in patients with DKD with decreasing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and 
increasing albuminuria levels (2, 3).
As the ty pe 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) population rapidly  grows throughout the world within 
the next y ears (4),and with it the DKD population, there is an increasing need for new 
therapeutic agents that effectivel y target underl ying disease mechanisms and slow or halt the 
progression of kidney  disease, whilst also addressing the high CV morbidity  and mortality  in 
this population.
DKD is a clinical sy ndrome affecting individuals with diabetes that is characterized by  
albuminuria on at least 2 occasions separated by  3 to 6 months (5). DKD is usuall y 
accompanied by  hypertension, progressive rise in proteinuria, and decline in renal function (3). 
DKD is categorized based on the level of urinary albumin excretion (UAE), either 
high albuminuria (formerl y micro -albuminuria, urinary  albumin -to-creatinine ratio [UACR] 
30to<300 mg/g) or very high albuminuria (formerly macro -albuminuria, UACR ≥ 300 mg/g).
As indicated in Figure 3–1, increased UAE and decreased GFR are both associated with a 
worse prognosis, with an increase in all -cause and CV mortality . Additionally , increased UAE 
and decreased GFR are also risk factors for ESRD, acute kidney  injury  and progressive CKD, 
independent of each other and of other cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in general as 
well as in high- risk populations ( 2, 6, 7) .
Figure 3–1 Prognosis of CKD by GFR and albuminuria category (3)
Interventions to improve outcomes related to DKD focus on reducing risk ( Figure 3–2), 
including counseling on lifesty le modifications (i.e. smoking cessation and dietary  
GFR = glomerular filtration rate.

modifications to reduce p roteinuria and aid in weight loss) and interventions aimed at 
glycemic control, d yslipidemia, and h ypertension (8).
Figure 3–2 Approaches to improving outcomes related to DKD (8)
Treatment with renin -angiotensin sy stem (RAS) inhibitors has been of particular interest 
given the ability  of these drugs to reduce the rate of progression of renal disease, 
independentl y and in addition to their antihypertensive effects, as evidenced in the Heart 
Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial (9), the Reduction of Endpoints in NI DDM 
with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) trial (10), and the Irbesartan DN 
Trial (IDNT) (11). 
Therefore, angiotensin -converting -enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin -receptor 
blockers (ARBs) can be considered as standard of care (SoC) therap y in patients with DKD 
and are often prescribed to patients with DKD at early  stages (8). However, they  slow but 
neither halt n or reverse kidney  disease progression (12). 
In addition, in placebo controlled studies in patients with earl y DKD (i.e. patients with high 
albuminuria at baseline), only  ACEIs were found to significantl y reduce the ri sk of all -cause 
and CV mortality  and morbidity (9). In patients with advanced DKD (i.e. patients with 
decreased kidney  function and very  high albuminuria at baseline) an impact on overall 
survival has not y et been demonstrated with ARBs (10, 11). ACEIs have not been 
investigated in outcome studies in the advanced DKD population y et. 
Animal studies have shown that aldosterone has an independent role in the development of 
hypertensive kidney  disease and vascular injury  resulting in my ocardial and renal fibrosis 
(Figure 3–3) and its blockade reduces proteinuria ( 13-16 ). Long -term RAS blockade with 
ACEI s and ARBs results in incomplete suppression of serum aldosterone levels and is known 
as the ‘aldosterone escape ’ phenomenon (17). Exploratory  clinical studies in adults have 
shown that in adults with CKD exhibiting the ‘ aldosterone escape ’ phenomenon, treatment 
with mineralocorticoid -receptor antagonists (MRAs) improves kidney  outcomes such as 
proteinuria (18). However, there is also evidence for possible therapeutic utility  of 
CVD =cardiovascular disease; ESRD =end-stage renal disease;
RAA S = renin -angiotensin -aldosterone system.

mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blockade in conditions of tissue and organ damage with 
normal aldosterone levels (19).
Figure 3–3 Mechanisms of cardiac and renal damage induced by aldosterone 
excess ( 20)
The results of several short- term studies support the proposal of Shavit et al. that aldosterone 
should be considered a novel therapeutic renal target in CKD patients with the added potential 
‘off-target’ effects on heart and vasculature ( 21). Nevertheless, large- scale, long -term 
outcome trials examining whether MRAs can slow progression of kidney  disease or prevent 
CV events in this population are missing.
Moreover, the use of curren tly available steroidal MRAs is known to increase the risk of 
hyperkalemia, particularly  in patients with T2DM and decreased kidney function (20, 22).
Finerenone (BAY 94 -8862) is a next -generation, oral, selective, non -steroidal MRA. In 
animal models, finerenone reduced cardiac and renal hy pertrophy , plasma prohormone of 
brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and proteinuria more efficientl y than in those treated with the 
steroidal MRA eplerenone, when comparing equi -natriuretic doses.  Finer enone’s tissue 
distribution pattern in rats was found to differ from the steroidal MRAs, i.e. spironolactone 
and eplerenone, which showed a higher accumulation of the drug equivalent concentration in kidney  than in heart tissue, in contrast to finerenone w hich was found to be equall y distributed 
in both the kidney and heart tissue (23).  Steroidal MRAs are known to interfere with the 
steroid hormone receptor, which can cause sexual side effects such as gy necomastia in men.  
However, finerenone is a non- steroidal and selective MRA in vitro , without any  detectable 
affinity  for the related androgen receptor; sexual side effects are therefore not expected to 
occur with finerenone at therapeutic dose levels.  These characteristics may  translate to a drug 
with a positive benefit -risk ratio in patients with DKD.
In a Phase IIa stud y, finerenone was studied in individuals with stable HFrEF and mild (eGFR 
60 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m
2) -to-moderate (30 –60 mL /min/ 1.73 m2) CKD. In this

26 FEB 2019 Version 3.0 Page:  23of 139
minerAlocorticoid Receptor Antagonist Tolerability  Study  (ARTS ; IMPACT No. 14563, 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), finerenone doses of 2. 5 to 10 mg/day  safel y reduced albuminuria and doses 
of 5.0 –10.0 mg/day  reduced plasma natriuretic peptides levels to the same magnitude as 
spironolactone 25 –50 mg/day . All doses of finerenone were associated with a statistically  
significantl y smaller mean increase in serum potassium concentration and clinically  
significantl y smaller decreases in eGFR compared to spironolactone (24). 
The MinerAlocorticoid Receptor Antagonist Tolerability  Study -Diabetic Nephropathy  
(ARTS -DN; IMPACT No. 16243; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) was a multicentre, randomized, 
double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, Phase IIb study  investigating the safet y and 
efficacy  of several oral dos es of finerenone in patients with T2DM and a clinical diagnosis of 
DKD, based on either high albuminuria (UACR 30 to 299 mg/g) or very  high albuminuria 
(UACR 300 to 3000 mg/g), and with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 
30mL/min/1.73 m2ormore. Finerenone doses of 1.25 mg up to 20 mg once dail y (OD) were 
investigated in 823 randomized patients over 90 day s of treatment compared to placebo in 
addition to SoC, including a RAS -inhibitor. Finerenone statisticall y significantly  reduced 
albuminu ria by 21 to 38%, compared to placebo, at doses of 7.5 mg to 20 mg OD when added 
to RAS blockade. All doses of finerenone were safe and well -tolerated. Incidences of 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were similar between placebo and all finerenone 
dose groups .
Based on the aforementioned properties and in itial results of finerenone in P hase II clinical 
trials, finerenone has the potential to address the unmet medical needs in patients with the clinical diagnosis of DKD. When added to SoC therap y inc luding a RAS blocker, 10 or 20mg 
finerenone given OD might demonstrate a reduction of CV mortality  and morbidity  and also 
delay  the progression of renal disease compared to placebo in addition to SoC. 
Further details can be found in the latest available v ersion of the Investigator’s B rochure (IB), 
which contains comprehensive information on the study  drug.
In this stud y (16244), finerenone will be investigated in patients at high risk of progressing to 
kidney  failure and at high risk of CV events.  A secon d study  of the Phase III program of 
finerenone in DKD, Study 17530, will investigate finerenone in patients at lower risk of progressing to kidney  failure but still at a high-risk of developing a first or recurrent CV 
event.  Accordingly , in Study  16244, t he primary  endpoint will focus on renal outcomes 
whereas in Study  17530, the primary  endpoint will focus on CV outcomes.

3.2 Rationale of the study
Study  16244 will be the first large -scale, long -term outcome trial examining whether the 
non-steroidal MRA finer enone can slow the progression of kidney  disease in patients with the 
clinical diagnosis of DKD.  Secondary  endpoints will focus on CV outcomes, all -cause 
mortality , all-cause hospitalizations and change in UACR.
The risk for CKD progression and ESRD is elevated in this population of patients with 
advanced DKD, with lower eGFR and higher levels of albuminuria being independent risk factors (6).
Together with Study  17530, which will be the first large -scale, long -term outcome trial 
examining wh ether the non- steroidal MRA finerenone can decrease CV mortality  and 
morbidity  in patients with the clinical diagnosis of DKD, Study  16244 is part of the Phase III 
trial program to evaluate if finerenone in addition to SoC can reduce the incidence of impor tant clinical outcomes in patients with the clinical diagnosis of DKD. 
An inappropriate release of aldosterone contributes to target organ damage found in heart failure, m yocardial infarction, chronic renal failure and hypertension. The extensive 
expression of the MR in the CV sy stem including the heart, endothelial cells, vascular smooth 
muscle cells and kidney  mesangial cells gives further evidence for the role of aldosterone in 
CV and renal injury .
Blockade of the action of aldosterone and poten tially  other MR ligands such as cortisol has 
been demonstrated to be of benefit in different forms of CVD (25-27 ).  Results from several 
short -term studies show that treatment with MRAs in addition to RAS blockade with an ACEI 
or ARB improves albuminuria; however, long- term outcome trials examining whether MRAs 
can prevent CV events or slow progression of kidney  disease in a diabetic or non -diabetic 
CKD population are still lacking. The Phase III progra m with finerenone in DKD will be the 
first program addressing both questions: Study  16244 will investigate the effects of the 
non-steroidal MRA finerenone on renal outcomes and Study  17530 will investigate the effects 
of finerenone on CV outcomes. 
The act ual mechanisms behind the pathological effects of aldosterone in DKD have not y et 
been full y elucidated; however, aldosterone seems to be a key player in the progression of 
kidney  disease, and also contributes to the accompany ing high CV morbidity  and mort ality of 
these patients. Potent and selective MR blockade with finerenone may  therefore provide 
protection against the burden of CVD and also slow or halt the progression of kidney disease 
in the targeted DKD population. 
3.3 Benefit -risk assessment
Among pati ents with diabetes, those with kidney  disease are consistentl y observed to have 
substantiall y elevated mortalit y rates. Much of this mortalit y is due to CVD, although non -CV 
mortalit y is also increased. Albuminuria and eGFR are independentl y and additivel yassociated 
with increased risks of CV events, CV mortalit y, and all -cause mortalit y (28). There is a high 
unmet medical need for treatments that can reduce the extensive burden of CV mortalit y and 
morbidit y and the progression of kidney disease in patients with DKD .

The population for Study  16244 has been chosen to adequately  define a study  population at high 
risk of developing renal events.  Meta -analyses have shown that very  high albuminuria is 
associated with a 3- to 5-fold increased risk for the development of ESRD compared with those 
with normal levels of albuminuria (29, 30).  Another analy sis of > 10000 individuals with T2DM 
have shown that patients with very  high albuminuria and an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2had a 
16-fold higher risk for renal events compared to patients with neither of these risk factors (31).  
Patients with very  high albuminuria and reduced eGFR have a substantially  increased risk of 
subsequent renal events and rapidly  progress to ESRD (6).  In patients with high albuminuria, the 
presence of diabetic retinopathy  may  indicate rapid loss of renal function and thus may  be an 
additional predictive prognostic factor for the progression of CKD secondary  to diabetes (32).
Therefore, Stud y 16244 will include a majority of patients with very high albuminuria and an 
eGFR< 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.  However, there are patients with advanced renal disease with 
very high albuminuria and an eGFR up to 75 mL /min/1.73m2who may  also benefit.  Patients 
with high albuminuria and a history  of diabetic retinopathy  have a higher risk within the 
patient population of high albuminuric patients to progress to ESRD and have therefore also 
been chosen as part of the target population for this study .
The presence of albuminuria in an individual is highl y predictive of CV events and 
progression of kidney  disease. In ARTS -DN (study  16243) in patients with T2DM and D KD 
treated with finerenone in combination with SoC therap y using a RAS inhibitor, a 
dose-dependent reduction in UACR from baseline to Day  90 was demonstrated.  Statistically  
significant reductions in UACR of 21%, 25%, 33% and 38% at Day  90 compared to base line 
were observed for the 4 highest doses of finerenone (7.5, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg od, 
respectivel y) compared to placebo.  In a post hoc anal ysis, UACR decreases of≥ 30% from 
baseline to Day  90 in the placebo, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg groups wer e seen for 
23.9%, 40.2%, 46.0%, 51.3% and 62.5% of subjects, respectivel y, and UACR decreases of 
≥50% in the same groups were seen for 13.6%, 17.2%, 17.2%, 33.6% and 40.2% of subjects, 
respectivel y. Post -hoc analy ses of randomized clinical trials (33, 34)suggest that a meaningful 
reduction in albuminuria may  translate to protection from CV events and declining renal 
function in patients with diabetic and non -diabetic renal disease with albuminuria.  For every  
30% reduction in al buminuria, the risk of ESRD decreased by  23.7% (95% confidence interval, 
11.4% to 34.2%; p=0.001) (33); there was an 18% reduction in CV risk and 27% reduction in 
HF risk for every  50% reduction in albuminuria (34).
Due to finerenone’s mode of action, h yperkalemia is an important identified risk which was 
also identified from previous studies with finerenone. Patients with pre- existing impairment 
of their renal function are likely  to have a greate r risk of experiencing clinically  significant 
hyperkalemia. A greater risk for hy perkalemia may  also occur if drugs which raise the 
potassium concentration (e.g. ACEI, ARBs or potassium -sparing diuretics) are used 
concomitantly . 
Worsening of renal function has been shown to occur with the steroidal MRAs, i.e.spironolactone and eplerenone , as well as RAS blocker in general.
The risk for such adverse events with finerenone is not ruled out.  However, in ARTS -DN, 
theincidence of h yperkalemia was low, and th e incidence of eGFR decline ≥30% relative to

baseline was similar between placebo and finerenone groups, with no imbalance in reported 
AEs related to the MedDRA primary  system organ class ‘ Renal and urinary disorders ’. In 
ARTS (study  14563), all doses of finerenone resulted in significantl y lower potassium 
increase and less eGFR reduction compared to spironolactone.
Thus, potassium levels and renal function will be closely  monitored in this study . 
Tominimize safet y risks to the patient, starting doses of study  medication will be chosen 
according to baseline renal function, and subsequent dose up -titration will be performed on 
the basis of measured potassium and eGFR values.  A 2- step up -titration is consistent with 
current clinical practice to initiate tre atment with a RAS blocker at a low dose, and 
toup-titrate the drug only if tolerated in order to avoid adverse effects on potassium and renal 
parameters. Stopping rules for temporary  and permanent discontinuation or dose reduction of 
study  drug based on p otassium values will minimize the risk of hy perkalemia. At an y time 
during the stud y, the investigator has the option to also down -titrate the study  drug, depending 
on serum potassium and the progression of the underly ing disease.  
All protocol -related pr ocedures, including vital signs measurements, 12 -lead electrocardiograms 
(ECGs), echocardiography  and blood and urine sampling, are non -invasive orestablished 
routine assessments in the management of patients with DKD with or without CVD. The high risk for progression of kidney  disease and fatal and non- fatal CV events in the study  
population of Study  16244, taken together with the beneficial results of MRAs on CVD in 
previous clinical trials and the results of finerenone in the Phase II studies all point towards a 
positive risk -benefit assessment that is in favor of the participation of subjects in this study .

placebo in delay ing the progression of kidney  disease, as measured b y the 
composite endpoint of time to first occurrence of kidney  failure, a sustained decrease 
of eGFR ≥ 40% from baseline over at least 4 weeks ,or renal death. 
The seconda ry objectives of this study  are to determine whether, in addition to SoC, 
finerenone compared to placebo:

CV death or non -fatal CV events (i.e. non -fatal my ocardial infarction, non -fatal stroke, 
hospitalization for heart failure [HF])
Delay s the time to all -cause mortality
Delay s the time to all -cause hospitalization 
Change in UACR from baseline to Month 4
Delay s the time to first occurrence of the following composite endpoint: onset of 
kidney failure , a sustained decrease of eGFR ≥ 57% from baseline over at least

5. Study design -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section 15.1.2.3 .
Design overview
Study  16244 is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, multicenter, 
event -driven Phase III study . Figure 5–1display s the overall study  design.
Patients from approximatel y 900 study  centers worldwide will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
either finerenone or placebo in addition to SoC therapy . Assumi ng a screening failure rate of 
approximatel y 50%,9600 patients will have to be screened to randomize approximately  
4800 patients. 
The anticipated duration of the study  is approximately  4years: this includes an anticipated 
recruitment period of 2 .75years followed by  a study  drug treatment period of 1year after the 
enrolment of the last patient into the trial anda maximum of 4.5 months for the run- in and 
screening period and 1 month for the follow- up period . However, as an event- driven trial, the 
actual length of the trial will depend on the observed event rates, the patient recruitment rate, 
and length of the recruitment period. Since all randomized subjects belong to the Full Anal ysis Set (FAS) on which the efficacy  
analyses are based, it is important to avoid randomization of non -eligible subjects into the study . 
Run- in Period (4 up to 16 weeks)
Subjects with written informed consent who complete the Run -in Visit and meet all
eligibility3criteria will be enrolled into a mandatory Run -in Period, the purpose of which is to 
ensure that the subject’s SoC therapy  including treatment with ACEIs or ARBs is optimized 
and that all inclusion and exclusion criteria are met at the Screening Visit.  The Run -in Period 
will last for a minimum of 4 weeks and a maximum of 16 weeks.
In the absence of documentation of diagnosis of high or very  high albuminuria (see Section 3.1
for definition), the subject may  still be enrolled into the study  as albuminuria will be 
measured at the Run -in Visit; in this case, the Run -in Period must last for a minimum of 
12weeks and a maximum of 16 weeks.
Screening Period (up to 2 weeks)
At the end of the Run -in Period, a Screening Visit to confirm the subject’s eligibility  will take 
place within ≤ 2weeks prior to the planned randomization. At this visit, it will be assessed 
whether the subject still meets all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria .3
For those subjects without a prior documented diagnosis of high or very  high albuminuria, the 
Screening Visit must be performed at least 12 weeks after the Run -in Visi t, and albuminuria 
should then be re- evaluated. If the subject still suffers from high or very  high albuminuria 
                                                
3Eligibility criteria related to central laboratory evaluation will be assessed once results are available.

Treatment Period
Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive once dail y (OD) oral doses of finerenone 
(10mg or 20 mg) or placebo in addition to their SoC therapy .
There will be up to 4 planned visits (including randomization at Visit 1) in the first 4 months; 
thereaft er visits will take place every  4months until the end of the study . Study  drug dose can 
be up- titrated from Visit 2 (Month 1) onwards or down -titrated at an y point (even between 
scheduled visits); guidance on dose adjustment is provided in Section 7.4. Subjects may  be 
seen at an y time throughout the study , in addition to scheduled visits, at the discretion of the 
investigator.
It is planned that all randomized subjects will remain in the trial until either: 
a.the projected number of primary  endpoints (see Sections 9.4.1 and 10.4) is reached, or 
b.the trial is terminated prematurely at the recommendation of the independent Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC) (see Section 13.1.3). 
All randomized subjects, including any subject who experienced a health event considered for the pre -specified primary or secondary  endpoints, should continue to receive study  drug until 
the trial is completed (see definition for end of study  below) provided there are no safet y 
grounds for discontinuing treatment.
Discontinuation of study  drug (for any  reason) does not constitute the subject’s withdrawal 
from the s tudy, except if the investigator believes that it is in the best interest of the subject or 
if the subject withdraws consent (see Section 6.4.1 fordetails).  
Details on procedures that are important to ensure the safet y of the individual study  subject 
are provided in the relevant sections of this protocol (i.e. medical management , control of 
blood pressure and use of potassium supplements/lowering agents in Section 8.1, and 
monitoring blood potassium in Section 9.7.1). 
Follow -up Period
The period between the subject’s last intake of study  drug and last visit in the study  is referred 
to as the ‘ Follow -up Period’. If a subject withdraws from study  drug permanently  but does 
not withdraw f rom the study , this would appl y to the period between the Premature 
Discontinuation (PD) Visit, which should take place as soon as possible following permanent 
discontinuation of study  drug, and the EOS Visit. In the case where a subject discontinues 
treatment at the EOS Visit, the Follow -up Period applies to the period between the EOS visit 
and PT visit.
All subjects who had withdrawn consent can be followed up for vital status if they do not sign 
the ‘Declaration of Objection’ form. In addition, vital status can be obtained by  the 
investigator from publicly available data sources. The collection of vital status must be obtained within the timelines provided b y Bayer.

End of study
The end of the stud y as a whole will be reached as soon as the last visit of the last subject of 
Study  16244 has been reached in all centers in all participating countries (EU and non -EU).
The study  will terminate either when:
(1)the targeted number of primary  efficacy  endpoint events have been positively  adjudicated
OR
(2)at a recommendation of the DMC, whichever is earlier.
After notification of study termination, for all subjects still participating in the study , 
anEnd-of- Study  (EOS) Visit should be scheduled as soon as possible ( within 4weeks of 
notification at the latest) to determine whether the subject had an event for inclusion in the 
primary  or secondary  endpoints.
Subjects who are still on treatment will discontinue study  drug treatment at the EOS Visit and 
must perform the Post -Treatment (PT) Visit (4 weeks + 5 days) after their last dose of study  
drug.
The primary  completion event for this study  is the last visit for the last subject.
The primary  completion date for this study  according to the FDA Amendment Act is specified 
in a separate do cument (not part of this study  protocol).
6. Study population
Subjects with T2DM and a clinical diagnosis of DKD treated with the individual maximum 
tolerated labeled dose of either an ACEI or an ARB (but not both), who meet all the inclusion criteria and non e of the exclusion criteria will be eligible for enrollment in this study . Subjects 
switching over from Study 17530 to this study  at the Screening Visit must only  meet all the 
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria at the Screening Visit to be eligible for 
enrollment in this study  (16244).

contraception is defined a s any combination of at least 2 effective methods of birth 
control, of which at least one is a ph ysical barrier (e.g. condoms with hormonal 
contraception or implants or combined oral contraceptives, certain intrauterine devices). 
Women are considered p ost-menopausal and not of child- bearing potential if they  have 
had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate) or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with seru m FSH levels 
> 40 mIU/mL  [for US only : FSH levels > 40mIU/mL  and estradiol < 20pg/mL ] or have

Note: One re -assessment of eGFR and UACR is allowed at the Run- in Visit and the 
Screening Visit. If one of the 3 UACR measurements is missing but the other 
2 are valid, these values can be used to assess subject’ s eligibility  for this study .
                                                
4Note: The number of subjects with high albuminuria and presence of diabetic retinopathy in the medical 
history will be capped at approximately 10% of the total population at screening.
5Note: The number of subjects with eGFR ≥60 to 75mL/min/1.73m2and very high albuminuria will be capped 
at approximately 10% of the total population with very high albuminuria at screening.

6.4 Withdraw al of subjects from study
6.4.1 Withdrawal
6.4.1.1 Discontinuation of study drug -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section 15.1.2.6.
After randomization, discontinuation of study drug (for any  reason) does notconstitute the 
subject’s withdrawal from the study (see also Section 6.4.1.2 ).
Study  drug must be permanently discontinued if any  of the following occurs:
Pregnancy  of the study  subject (see also Section 9.6.2)
The investigator is of the opinion that continuation of treatment with study drug is 
harmful to the subject’s well- being
The randomization code is broken bytheinvestigator, or other responsible person, 
when knowledge of the subject’s treatment is required
Any investigational drug other than the study drug is used.
Study  drug may be permanently discontinued if any  of the following occurs:
Any suspected drug- related AE or SAE
If any exclusion cr iterion applies during treatment
If a significant violation of the protocol occurs, as defined b y the sponsor and the 
coordinating investigator.
In general, subjects who permanentl y discontinue study  drug are expected to continue in the 
follow -up period and to attend all protocol- specified study  visits, and should be encouraged to 
perform all assessments described in the visit schedule (see Section 9.2).
If a subject no longer on study  drug is unable to attend the clinic for a study visit, a 
telephone consultation may be performed to determine if relevant health events /endpoints (e.g. development of CV or renal complications) have occurred. I deally , a face -to-face visit 
should be performed at least once a year .Expected frequency  of telephone contacts should be 
in line with the standard visit schedule, and therefore performed every  4 months. Ad hoc 
additional telephone contacts may  also be requested (e.g. prior to the interim analy sis)and 
made to the subject themselves or to other contact as provided by  the patient, e.g. a next of 
kin, primary  physician (or local equivalent).
Note that study  drug may be temporaril y discontinued (i.e. interrupted), a s described in 
Section 7.4.

6.4.1.2 Discontinuation of study
Subjects must be withdrawn from the study if the following occurs:
At their own request or at the request of their legally  acceptable representative. 
Atanytime during the study  and without giving reasons, a subject may  decline to 
participate further. The subject will not suffer an y disadvantage as a result (see also 
Section 13.4).
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study if either of the following occurs:
If, in the investigator's opinion, continuation of the study  would be harmful to the 
subject’s well -being 
At the specific request of the sponsor and in liaison with the investigator.
Should a subject withdraw consent to participate in the study , he/she may  either:
Agree to continue releasing information for the study (for details, see Section 9.1),
or
Refuse to allow further release of information.
Depending on the time point of withdrawal: 
A subject who discontinues study  parti cipation prematurely  for any  reason is defined 
as ‘dropout ’ if the subject has alread y been randomized
A subject who, for an y reason (e.g. failure to satisfy the selection criteria), terminates 
the study  before randomization is regarded as a ‘ screening failure’.
General procedures
In all cases, the reason for withdrawal of study  drug and/or of study  participation must be 
recorded in the eCRF and in the subject’s medical records.
As specified in Section 13.4, the subject may  object to the generation and processing of 
post-withdrawal data.
Details for the premature termination of the study  as a whole (or components thereof) are 
provided in Section 12.
6.4.2 Replacement
Randomized subjects who withdraw prematurel y will not be replaced.
If applicable, a subject who is not eligible at the Run -in or S creening Visit may be re -screened 
at a later time (see Section 6.4.2.1 ) or switch over to Study  17530 (see Section 6.4.2.2 ) 
provided the pre -requisites are met .

6.4.2.1 Re-screening -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section 15.1.2.7.
If a subject is not eligible at the Run -in or Screening Visit for either this study  (16244 ) or 
Study 17530 , the subject may be re- screened at a later time .
The following conditions are pre -requisites of re -screening:
Before re -screening, new written informed consent must be obtained
Allocation of a new subject identification number 
Allassessments for the study  must be repeated
A minimum of 3 months between the initial Run -in Visit and re- screening .
A subject may  be re -screened onl y once and after being declared as a screening failure.  
During r e-screening ,a switch over between studies is allowed (see Section 6.4.2.2).
6.4.2.2 Switch over between studies
DKD is a disease continuum characterized by  2 highl y variable parameters, eGFR and UACR. 
The thresholds of these parameters for these studies ( 16244 and 17530) were chosen in order 
to define a high risk population.  I t should be noted these parameters may  vary  in daily  life 
making the patient eligible for one or the other study .  Nevertheless, these variations still reflect 
the disease continuum and do not alter the high risk. The reason for allowing switch over is to 
account for these intrinsic variations.  In addition, it also serves the purpose of reducing the 
burden on the subjects due to not needing to repeat the run -in and screening assessme nts.  
Subjects are permitted to switch from Study  16244 to Study 17530, or vice versa. 
Aswitch over from either study  is permitted onl y once and should take place during the 
respective Run -in and Screening periods.
An example is as follows:
If a subject initially  enrolled in Study  16244 is found to be not eligible during the Run- in 
or Screening Period of Study  16244, the investigator may  consider enrolling this subject 
into Study  17530 if the subject meets the eligibility  criteria at run -in or screening f or 
Study  17530. Prior to the subject being enrolled in Study  17530, the subject must provide 
written informed consent.
The subject will be transferred to Stud y 17530 in the I xRS sy stem as outlined in the 
Investigator Guide. The subject will continue with their originally  assigned subject 
identification (SID) into Study  17530. Within the SI D, the stud y identifier will indicate 
the subject has switched from Study  16244 to Study  17530 (see Section 6.5 ). The 
procedures and assessments from the Run -in and/or Screening Visit(s) of Study 16244 do 
not have to be repeated for Study  17530; the data, including laboratory  data, will be 
transferred from Study  16244 to Study  17530.
If a subject switches from Study  16244 to Study  17530 in the Run -in period but is found 
not to meet the in -and exclusion criteria of Study 17530 at the end of the Screening Period, 
CONFIDENTIAL Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

this subject is not permitted to switch b ack into Study  16244 and must be registered as a 
screening failure of study  17530. If this is the case, the subject may  still be re -screened for 
either of the studies if he or she fulfills th e criteria mentioned in Section 6.4.2.1 .
6.5 Subject identification
Upon signing the informed consent form and registering the subject in I xRS, each subject will 
automatically  be assigned a unique 9 digit subject identification (SID) number by  the I xRS for 
unambiguous identification throughout the stud y.  The SID number is constructed as follows:
Digits 1 -2: Unique country  number
Digits 3 -5: Study  center number, unique within any  country
Digit 6: Study -specific identifier
Digits 7 -9: Subject number, unique within any  study  center of a given country  for the study .
7. Treatment(s)
7.1 Treatments to be administered
Finerenone immediate -release (IR) tablets are light orange film -coated tablets, oval 
(modified oblong), containing 10 mg or 20 mg finerenone ( Table 7–1 ). Matching placebo 
tablets will be supplied.
Following a Screening Visit, eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to either finerenone or 
placebo, and stud y drug will be dispensed according to the visit schedule (see Section 9.1).
The subject will receive the following:
Finerenone
−10mg finerenone tablet once dail y (OD)
(starting dose for subjects with an eGFR between 25 to < 60 mL/min/1.73m² 
at the Screening Visit) 
−20mg finerenone tablet OD
(starting dose for subjects with an eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m² 
at the Screening Visit) 
or
Placebo tablet OD. 
Following randomization of the subject, the I xRS will determine the bottle number for the 
study site investigator or designee to select for the subject. The investigator at the study  site is 
to instruct subjects to take 1 tablet OD, preferabl y in the morning. The first dose of study  drug 
should be taken at the site on the same day  as Visit 1 (Day 1), preferabl y in the morning.

7.3 Treatment assignment
Eligible subjects will be randomized within ≤ 2 weeks after the Screening Visit. The 
randomization will be stratified by  region (North America, Europe, Asia, Latin America and 
others), t ype of albuminuria at screening (high or very high albuminuria) and eG FR at 
screening (25 to <45, 45 to <60, ≥60mL/min/1.73m²). The eGFR will be calculated by  the 
Central Laboratory  appl ying the CKD -EPI formula (36).
The number of subjects with eGFR ≥60 to <75 mL/min/1.73 m2and very  high albuminuria 
willbe capped at approximatel y 10% of the total population with very  high albuminuria at 
screening. The number of subjects with high albuminuria and presence of diabetic retinopathy  
in the medical history will be c apped at approximatel y 10% of the total population at screening .

7.4 Dosage and administration -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section 15.1.2.8.
As shown in Table 7–2, the starting dose of finerenone will depend on the eGFR value at the 
Screening Visit.Thus, at randomization, subjects wi th an eGFR between 25 to < 60mL/min/1.73m² at the 
Screening Visit (c entral laboratory  results) will be assigned to the lower dose of finerenone 
(10mg) or placebo in addition to SoC, whilst subjects with an eGFR ≥60mL/min/1.73m² will 
be assigned to the higher dose of finerenone (20 mg) or placebo in addition to SoC .

Missed intake of study drug
If the subject misses his/her scheduled dail y intake of study drug, he/she should consider the 
following 2 options before continuing stud y drug intake:
(1)If intake of the missed tablet is discovered >8 hours before the next scheduled dose, the 
subject should take the study  drug as soon as possible
(2)If the missed intake is discovered within 8 hours of the next scheduled dose, 
thesubject should wait and take the next tablet at the usual time.
Up-and down -titration of study dr ug
The investigator is encouraged to up-titrate the dose of study  drug at an y time once the patient 
has been on a stable dose for 4 weeks (± 7 day s)(e.g. from Visit 2 onwards for patient starting 
study  drug on the lower dose) either at a regular visit or an Up -titration Visit.  Up- titration can 
be performed provided:
the potassium concentration (local laboratory  value) is ≤ 4.8 mmol/L ,
AND
eGFR decrease (local laboratory  value) is less than 30% below the value measured at 
the last regular visit. 
Subjects who started with or were up -titrated to the target dose (20 mg OD) of the study  drug 
but who do not tolerate this dose may  be down- titrated at an y point during the study , 
including between -scheduled visits if required for safet y reasons. These subjects may be 
up-titrated again based on the rules provided above. If the subject is already  at the lower dose, 
the study  drug can be interrupted at the investigator’s discretion (refer to Section 9.7.1 for 
guidance). If the stud y drug is interrupted for more than 7 days, the stud y drug should be re -
started at the lower dose (10 mg OD).
Subsequent to an up -titration or re -start of stud y drug after interruption of study  drug intake
for more than 7 day s, the investigator should perform an Up -titration V isit 4 weeks (±7days) 
after titration or restart, in order to monitor potassium levels and renal function (see
Table 9–1). If a regular study  visit will be scheduled to take place 4 weeks (± 7days) after up-
titration, the monitoring of potassium and renal function is assured and no Up -titration Visit 
has to be performed in addition .  With down -titrations, the unscheduled safety  visit may  need 
a smaller time window and should be performed at the investigator’s discretion.At any  point during study  drug treatment, if blood potassium is found to be elevated, 
study drug treatment should be adjusted according to guidance provided in Section 9.7.1.
Both up- and down -titrations will be at the investigator’s discretion and will depend on the 
general clinical condition of the individual subject. The investigator should attempt to reach 
the maximum (target) dose of study  drug as long as safet y is not compromised.
All titrations, including the reasons for down -titrati onor for not dispensing the 20 mg dose , 
must be documented in the eCRF.

7.5 Blinding
7.5.1 Blinding measures
Finerenone IR tablets (10 mg and 20 mg) and placebo tablets will be identical in appearance 
(size, shape, color). The packaging and labeling will be designe d to maintain the blinding of 
the investigator’s team and the subjects. The study  data will remain blinded until database 
lock and authorization of data release according to standard operating procedures.
Appropriate measures will be taken to maintain blin ding while bioanal ysis is ongoing.
7.5.2 Unblinding -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section 15.1.2.9.
In compliance with applicable regulations, in the event of a SUSAR (see Section 9.6.1.4) 
related to the blinded treatment, the subject’s treatment code will usually  beunblinded before 
reporting to the health authorities andethic committees.
In order to maintain the integrit y of the study, SUSARs will be waived from unblinding and 
expedited safet y reporting if it represent sone of the pre -specified disease -related effi cacy 
endpoints (see also Section 9.6.1.4).
7.5.3 Emergency unblinding by the investigator
In the event of an emergency  or any  finding that requires unblin ding, the investigator may  
break the blind for an individual subject via the IxRS according to the unblinding procedure 
outlined in the I nvestigator’s Guide. This s ystem allows the investigator, or other responsible 
person, to identify  the study  drug if th ere is an emergency , without jeopardizing the 
double -blind integrit y of the remainder of the study.
The code can be broken by  the investigator, or other responsible person, when knowledge of 
the subject’s treatment is required for the clinical management o f the subject. If it becomes 
necessary  to know the individual treatment during the study  and thus to break the code for 
that subject, the date and reason for unblinding are to be recorded on the relevant eCRF page. The investigator is required to promptly  document and explain to the sponsor any  premature 
unblinding (e.g. unblinding due to a serious adverse event [SAE]) of the study  drug), 
andstudy  drug must be discontinued permanentl y.
7.6 Drug logistics and accountability
All study  drugs will be stored at the investigational site in accordance with GCP and GMP 
requirements and the instructions given b y the clinical supplies department of the sponsor (or 
its affiliate/CRO), and will be inaccessible to unauthorized personnel. Special storage 
conditions and a complete record of batch numbers and expiry  dates can be found in the 
sponsor’s study  file; the site -relevant elements of this information will be available in the 
investigator site file. On the day  of receipt, the responsible site personnel will confirm receipt of 
study  drug via I xRS. The personnel will use the study  drug only  within the framework of this 
clinical study  and in accordance with this protocol. Receipt, distribution, return and destruction 
CONFIDENTIAL Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  BAY 94 -8862 (finerenone) / 16244
26 FEB 2019 Version 3.0 Page:  44of 139
(if any ) of the stud y drug must be properl y documented according to the sponsor’s agreed and 
specified procedures .
Written instructions on study  drug destruction will be made available to affected parties as 
applicable.
7.7 Treatment compliance
To monitor compliance, the investigator will be required to complete a drug dispensing log 
for each subject. The date of dispensing the study  drug to the subject will be documented.
Study  drug will be dispensed at each scheduled visit starting from Visit 1 (Day  1), as applicable.
Subjects will be instructed to return all of the study drug packaging including unused stud y 
drug and empt y packaging.  Accountability must be performed at each visit (if applicable). 
Any discrepancies between actual and expected amount of returned study  medication must be 
discussed with the subject at the time of the visit, and any  explanation must be documented in 
the source records.
8. Non-study therapy
8.1 Prior and concomitant therapy
8.1.1 General considerations for prior and concomitant therapy
Figure 8–1depicts the conditions of prior therapy  on ACEI s and ARBs during the time 
leading up to the Screening Visit.  
For at least 4 weeks prior to the Run -inVisit, all subjects must be treated with  
either anACEI orARB, orboth
Starting with the Run -in Visit, subjects should be treated with only an ACEI or ARB
For at least 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit, subjects should be treated with the 
maximum tolerated labeled dose (but not below the minimal labeled dose) of 
only anACEI or an ARB (not both), preferab ly without any  adjustments to dose or 
choice of agent or to an y other antihy pertensive or antigl ycemic treatment.

‡If applicable
*During the maintenance phase, there should preferab ly be no adjustments to dose of ACEI or ARB or to any other 
antihypertensive or antiglycemic treatment
The maximum tolerated labeled dose for ACEIs or ARBs should be the highest dose within
the ranges shown in Table 8–1or according to local labels, as applicable, which the subject 
can safel y tolerate. This dose should not be below the minimum labeled dose in order to 
maximize therapeutic benefit of background SoC.

Variations to these recommended dose ranges may  exist in local clinical guidelines or labels. 
If the maximum labeled dose cannot be reached, the reason(s) should be documented in the 
eCRF. Antihy pertens ive therapy  for renal and CVD protection will be administered according 
to local guidelines (see also Section 8.1.2 on medical management).
Depending on blood pressure, serum creatinine or eGFR, subjects may  need to have their study  
drug dose or the dose of another concomitant medication reduced or discont inued. The dosage 
of SoC therapies should not be reduced in order to solely facilitate maintenance of study  drug .
Prior medication that was discontinued to comply with the eligibility  criteria of the study  
should also be recorded in the eCRF.
All concomitant medication including therap y for T2DM and DKD until the PT Visit will be 
recorded in the eCRF.The following therapies are NOT permitted:
Concomitant therap y with eplerenone, spironolactone, an y renin inhibitor, or 
potassium -sparing diureti c which cannot be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to the 
Screening Visit and during stud y drug treatment
Concomitant therapy  with both an ACEI andan ARB during the Run -in and Screening
periods, and during stud y drug treatment
Concomitant therap y with potent cy tochrome P450 isoenzy me 3A4 (CYP3A4) 
inhibitors or inducers must be stopped at least 7 days before randomization and
is not allowed to be started during study  drug treatment
A list of the most common medication regarded as potent CYP3A4 inhibitor s or inducers is 
provided in Section 16.1.
Caution :Increases in finerenone exposure in combination with the following moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors c annot be excluded: amiodarone, aprepitant, bicalutamide, 
chloramphenicol, imatinib, mifepristone, norfloxacine, tacrolimus, verapamil, lapatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. Caution should also be exercised with concomitant use of high -dose acet ylsalicy lic acid (>500 mg/day ), non- steroidal 
anti-inflammatory  agents or trimethoprim or trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole.
8.1.2 Medical management
ACEs and ARBs are considered as SoC therap y in patients with DKD and often prescribed to 
patients with DKD at early  stages (8).
It is advisable to follow the recommendations of local guidelines for the management of CVD and CKD, the use of statins, anti- platelets and beta -blockers, and for gl ycemic control.

8.1.3 Control of blood pressure -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section 15.1.2.10.
According to international guidelines, the recommended target blood pressure for subjects 
with T2DM and albuminuria, who are at increased risk of CVD and CKD progression, is 
<130/80 mmHg (39-41). However, this value may vary  for the individual subject depending 
on concomitant diseases and well -being.
If blood pressure is considered uncontrolled b y the investigator during the study period, 
non-potassium -sparing diuretics may  be added as first choice to the treatment regimen if this 
was not alread y don e. Thereafter, the addition of antihy pertensive medication can be 
performed according to local guideline recommendations.
Allconcomitant medication added to the treatment regimen during the course of the stud y 
must be recorded in the eCRF .
8.1.4 Use of potassium supplements and lowering agents
If needed, potassium supplementation can be prescribed during the course of the study . 
Investigators are advised to monitor potassium carefully  at each visit and to adapt the dose of 
any potassium supplementation in accordance with the potassium value measured at each visit 
or discontinue potassium supplementation once the potassium is within the normal range.Potassium -lowering agents (e.g. sodium pol ystyrene sulfonate, calcium poly styrene sulfonate) 
are allowed to be started during treatment with study  drug.
Any use of potassium supplementation and potassium -lowering agents must be documented 
in the eCRF.
8.2 Post-study therapy
The investigator will decide in consultation with the individual subject if additional treatment 
is required and choose from existing treatment options.
The investigator must provide follow -up medical care for all subjects who complete the study  
or who are prematurel y withdrawn from the study, or must refer them for appropriate ongoing 
care as required.

9. Procedures and variables
9.1 Tabular schedule of evaluations -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section 15.1.2.11 and Section 15.1.2.12.
Table 9–1 depicts the schedule of activities and evaluations for this study  (16244).
An overview of the procedures for sub -studies of 1 6244 is provided in Table 9–2.
All randomized subjects will remain in the study until its termination, either:
(1)after positive adjudication of the targeted number of primary  efficacy  endpoint events, 
or
(2)at a recommendation of the DMC.
Thus, all subjects, including those who stopped taking study  drug, should be asked to attend 
all the protocol- specified study  visits in order to perform all assessments as stipulated in the 
visit schedule ( Table 9–1 ).
If any subject refuses to return for the defined assessments or is unable to do so, every  effort 
should be made to contact him/her or a knowledgeable informant b y telephone to ask if an y of 
the primary , secondary , or other endpoints have been reached at the scheduled visits for the
remaining duration of the study  (see Section 6.4.1.1 for details).  Attempts to contact the 
subject should be documented in the subject’s records. If any subject refuses to be contacted 
by telephone (e.g. the subject withdrew consent to release further information), every  effort 
should be made to obtain vital status (alive or dead) information through consultation of 
public databases, wherever allow ed by local regulations.

This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section 15.1.2.25.
The parameters in Section 9.4.1 (primary ), Section 9.4.2 (secondary ) and Section 9.4.3
(exploratory ) will be used to assess the efficacy  of the study  drug.
Efficacy  endpoints will be evaluated by  a Clinical Event Committee (CEC) ( see Section 13.1.2 ).
Kidney  failure is defined as either the occurrence of ESRD or an eGFR of less than 15 
mL/min/1.73 m², confirmed by  a second measurement at the earliest 4 weeks after the initial 
measurement . ESRD is defined as the initiation of chronic dial ysis (haemo -or peritoneal -
dialy sis) for at least 90 day s or renal transplantation. In addition, the eGFR threshold of 15 
mL/min/1.73 m² is consistent with the definition of kidney  failure from KDIGO (Kidn ey 
Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) (3)and was chosen in order to include an objective 
component to the endpoint becaus e the decision to initiate dialy sis therap y or kidney  
transplantation may  be affected b y factors other than the eGFR. All other definitions of 
individual endpoints (e.g. CV death) will be p rovided in the Endpoint Manual.
9.4.1 Primary efficacy variable
The primary  efficacy  variable will be the time to the first occurrence of the composite endpoint
of onset of kidney  failure, a sustained decrease of eGFR ≥ 40% from baseline over at least 
4weeks , orrenal death.
9.4.2 Secondary efficacy variables
Secondary  efficacy variables will be as follows:
Time to first occurrence of the following composite endpoint:  cardiovascular (CV) 
death or non- fatal CV events (i.e. non- fatal my ocardial infarction, non -fatal stroke, or 
hospitalization for HF)
Time to all- cause mortality
Time to all -cause hospitalization

9.5 Pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section 15.1.2.27.
For the investigation of systemic exposure to finerenone and its relationship with treatment 
effects, the plasma concentrations of finerenone will be determined at different time points using a sparse sampling approach in all participating subjects.  Details about the collection, 
processing, storage and shipment of samples will be provided separatel y (Laboratory  Manual).
The plasma concentration versus time data of Visit 3 (Month 4) and at su bsequent y early  
visits will be evaluated descriptivel y, separated b y dose. Plots will be prepared of all 
individual plasma concentrations vs. actual relative study times (time of sample collection after time of stud y drug administration). 
The PK data will be evaluated using non -linear mixed effect modeling (NONMEM). In 
addition, attempts will be made to identify  whether the PK of finerenone is influenced by  
covariates and to explore exposure-response relationships. This evaluation will be described in a se parate analy sis plan and will be reported separatel y.
At Visit 3 (Month 4), a trough sample for the determination of finerenone plasma concentrations will be drawn before intake of study drug (if the sample could not be obtained 
at Visit 3, it can be drawn at Visit 4). At this visit, study  drug will be administered at the study  
center b y stud y personnel and the exact time of study drug intake on the day before the visit 
and on the day  of the visit and the exact sampling time will be recorded in the eCRF. Id eally , 
the study  personnel should contact the subject prior to Visit 3 to remind them not to take the 
study  drug as usual in the morning at home.
At each of the yearl y visits, one blood sample for the determination of finerenone plasma 
concentrations will be drawn during the visit after intake of study drug at home. The subjects should be advised to take their drug as usual in the morning at home and recall the time of drug intake. The exact time of study  drug intake and the exact sampling times will be 
recorded in the eCRF.

9.6 Safety
9.6.1 Adverse events
9.6.1.1 Definitions -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section 15.1.2.28.
Definition of adverse event (AE)
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence (i.e. any unfavorable and unintended sign 
[including abnormal laboratory  findings], sy mptom or disease) in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject. Therefore, an AE may  or may  not be temporall y or causally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product.
All diagnoses, sy mptom(s), sign(s) or finding(s) with a start date from randomization 
onwards must be recorded as (S)AEs, except those related to stud y procedure. The latter have 
to be recorded as (S)AEs after informed consent has been obtained (see also end of this 
section for definition of SAE).
A surgical procedure that was planned prior to randomization by any physician treating the 
subject should not be recorded as an AE (however, the condition for which the surgery  is 
required may be an AE).In the following differentiation between medical history  and AEs, the term 
‘condition ’may include abnormal physical examination findings, s ymptoms, diseases, 
laboratory  or ECG findings:
Conditions that were present before randomization and for which 
nosymptoms or treatment are present until randomization arerecorded as medical 
history  (e.g. seasonal allergy  without acute complaints)
Conditions that started before randomization and for which s ymptoms ortreatment are 
present after randomization , at unchanged intensity , are recorded as medical history  
(e.g. allergic pollinosis)
Conditions that started or deteriorated after randomization will be documented as 
(S)AEs
Conditions assessed as related to study  procedure (such as invasive procedures 
andadjustm ent of SoC therap y [see Section 8.1.1 for guidance]) that 
start ordeteriorate after signed informed consent must be documented as (S)AEs.

26 FEB 2019 Version 3.0 Page:  64of 139
Definition of serious adverse event (SAE)
An SAE is classified as any  untoward medical occurrence that, at any  dose, meets any  of the 
following criteria (a –f):
a. Results in death
b. Is life -threatening
The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the subject was 
at risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically  might have caused death if it were more severe.
c. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
A hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization will not be regarded as an SAE if 
atleast one of the following exceptions is met:
The admission results in a hospital stay  of less than 12 hours
The admission is pre- planned
(e.g. elective or scheduled surgery  arranged prior to the first dose of stud y drug ; 
admission is part of the study  procedures as described in Section 9.2)
The admission is not associated with an AE
(e.g. social hospitalization for purposes of respite care).
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during an y hospitalization may 
fulfill the criterion of ‘ medically important ’ and as such may  be reportable as an SAE 
dependent on clinical judgment. In addition, where local regulatory  authorities 
specif ically require a more stringent definition, the local regulation takes precedence.
d. Results in persistent or significant disability  / incapacity
Disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct normal life’s 
functions.
e. Is a congeni tal anomal y / birth defect
f. Is another serious or important medical event as judged b y the investigator.
9.6.1.2 Classifications for adverse event assessment
All AEs will be assessed and documented b y the investigator according to the categories 
detailed below.
9.6.1.2.1 Seriousness
For each AE, the seriousness must be determined according to the criteria given in 
Section 9.6.1.2.
CONFIDENT IAL Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  BAY 94 -8862 (finerenone) / 16244
26 FEB 2019 Version 3.0 Page:  65of 139
9.6.1.2.2 Intensity
The intensity  of an AE is cl assified according to the following categories:
Mild: usually  transient in nature and generally  not interfering with normal activities
Moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities
Severe: prevents normal activities.
9.6.1.2.3 Causal relationship 
The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the administration of treatment 
is a decision to be made by  the investigator, who is a qualified phy sician, based on all 
information available at the time of the completion of the eC RF.
The assessment is based on the question whether there was a ‘ reasonable causal relationship’ 
to the study  treatment in question.
Possible answers are ‘ yes’ or ‘ no’.
An assessment of ‘ no’ would include:
1.The existence of a highl y likely  alternative explanation, e.g. mechanical bleeding at 
surgical site.
or
2.Non-plausibility , e.g. the subject is struck by  an automobile when there is no 
indication that the drug caused disorientation that may  have caused the event; cancer 
developing a few day s after t he first drug administration.
An assessment of ‘ yes’ indicates that that the AE is reasonabl y associated with the use of the 
study  treatment.
Important factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to study  treatment 
include the followin g:
– The temporal sequence from drug administration:
The event should occur after the drug is given. The length of time from drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.
–Recovery  on drug discontinuation (de -challenge), rec urrence on drug re -introduction 
(re-challenge):
Subject’s response after de -challenge or re -challenge should be considered in view of 
the usual clinical course of the event in question.
–Underl ying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases:
Each event should be e valuated in the context of the natural history  and course of the 
disease being treated and any  other disease the subject may  have.
–Concomitant medication or treatment:The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives should be examined to determine whether an y of them might have caused the event in question.
CONFIDENT IAL Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  BAY 94 -8862 (finerenone) / 16244
26 FEB 2019 Version 3.0 Page:  66of 139
–The pharmacology  and pharmacokinetics of the study  treatment:
The pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) 
of the study  treatment, coupl ed with the individual subject’s pharmacod ynamics 
should be considered.
– The assessment is not possible.
Causal relationship to protocol- required procedure(s)
The assessment of a possible causal relationship between the AE and protocol -required 
procedure(s) is based on the question whether there was a ‘ reasonable causal relationship ’ to 
protocol -required procedure(s). 
Possible answers are ‘ yes’ or ‘ no’.
9.6.1.2.4 Action taken with study treatment 
Any action on study  treatment to resolve the AE is to be documented using the categories 
listed below as follows:
Drug withdrawn
Drug interrupted
Dose reduced
Dose not changed
Dose increased
Not applicable
Unknown.
9.6.1.2.5 Other specific treatment(s) of adverse events
Specific treatment of AE(s), if given, is to be documented foll ows:
None
Remedial drug therap y
Other.

9.6.1.2.6 Outcome
The outcome of the AE is to be documented as follows: 
Recovered/resolved
Recovering/resolving
Recovered/resolved with sequelae
Not recovered/not resolved
Fatal
Unknown.
9.6.1.3 Assessments and documentation of adverse events (AEs) -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section 15.1.2.29.
Attention is to be paid to the time of occurrence of AEs at all stages o f the examination. Thus, 
the subject should be closely  observed by  the investigator.
AEs observed, mentioned upon open questioning by  a member of the investigator’s team or 
spontaneousl y reported by  the patient will be documented. The observation period fo r AEs will 
start with randomization and will end with the last visit of follow -up except for AEs related to 
study  procedures; the observation period for the latter AEs will start with signed informed 
consent and will end with the last visit of follow -up. In the event of ongoing study -related 
AEs and medicall y relevant AEs at the end of the study, the investigator is urged to monitor 
the subject and document the outcome on the subject’s source document. After the end of the 
follow -up phase, there is no requirement to actively  collect AEs including deaths. The t ype of 
information that should be assessed and recorded by  the investigator for each AE is listed in 
Section 9.6.1.2.
See also Section 9.6.1.1 above for the differentiation between medical history  and AEs.
The investigator is responsible fo r the grading of each category  mentioned. An assessment of 
the seriousness of the event will be made b y the investigator .  SAEs will be recorded on the 
AE page of the eCRF.
Emerging AEs will be allocated to the period in which they  have started, e.g. a s ymptom 
starting in the treatment period and continuing in the follow-up period without deterioration 
will only  be documented for that treatment period.
When assigning its cause, ‘death’ should notbe recorded as an AE on the AE page.  
Instead, ‘death’ is the outcome of underly ing AE(s).
For all serious adverse events (SAEs), the sponsor has to carry out a separate assessment for expectedness, seriousness and causal relationship to study  drug.

9.6.1.3.1 Event versus outcome
The efficacy  and pre -defined disease -related outcome events specified in Figure 9–1 will 
notbe documented as (S)AEs.  Instead, these events will be docume nted only  on the 
Outcome Event pages of the eCRF. In addition, they  will not be reported as SAEs and will 
neither be unblinded, nor reported to regulatory  authorities, I ECs, or investigators (see also 
Section 9.6.1.4 for details). 
However, they  will be collected in the eCRF, monitored by  the DMC during the study  and 
analyzed in the clinical report after study  termination. I f unexpected safet y issues are 
identified, specific amendments will be implemented.

9.6.1.4 Reporting of serious adverse events (SAEs) -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section 15.1.2.30.
The definition of SAEs is provided in Section 9.6.1.1. Each SAE must be followed up until 
resolution or stabilization by  submission of updated reports to the designated recipient.
The pre -defined disease -related efficacy  events (see Table 13–1) will not be subject to AE 
documentation and expedited reporting as SAE because they  are not unexpected in this study  
population. Thus, they will not be recorded as SAEs on the AE page and will not be sent to

Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance department.  Instead, these events will be recorded on the eCRF 
as outcome events. Consequently , they  will neither be unblinded, nor reported to regulatory  
authorities, IECs or investigators. However, they  will be collected in the eCRF, evaluated b y 
the CEC, monitored by the independent DMC during the study  and anal yzed in the clinical 
study  report after termi nation of the study . The independent DMC will periodically  review 
and assess all safety data for imbalances in safet y outcomes. I t is believed that in this way , 
patient safet y can continue to be monitored throughout the duration of the trial, without 
affec ting the integrity  of the study .  Should unexpected safet y issues be identified, specific 
amendments will be implemented.
All other SAEs that fulfill the seriousness criteria provided in Section 9.6.1.1 must be 
collected on the AE page of the eCRF and reported as SAEs to the Sponsor’s 
Pharmacovigilance department. All SAEs that fulfill SUSAR criteria as defined by the 
ICH E2A Guideline will be reporte d to the concerned authorities b y expedited means (see 
details below ).
The investigator is responsible for continuing to follow-up on all SAE reports (whether or not the event is related to study  drug) until resolution of the event, or until the event is c onsidered 
chronic and/or stable b y the investigator and/or other ph ysician who is responsible for the 
subject’s medical care. Follow -up SAE reports will be reported according to the same 
timelines as initial reports, as soon as new significant information becomes available.
Investigator’s notification of the sponsor
All investigators will be thoroughly instructed and trained on all relevant aspects of the 
investigator’s reporting obligations for SAEs. This information, including all relevant contact details, will be summarized in the investigator site file and updated as needed.
The investigator must report immediately  (within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness) 
allSAEs that are not exempted from SAE reporting occurring during the observation period 
defined in Section 9.6.1.3 to the recipient detailed in the instructions for SAE reporting 
included in the Investigator File.Each SAE must be follo wed up until resolution or stabilization by  submission of updated 
reports to the designated recipient.SAEs occurring after the protocol- defined observation period will be processed by  the 
sponsor according to all applicable regulations.The efficacy and pre-defined disease -related outcome events as described in Section 9.6.1.3.1
will not be subject to AE documentation. Thus they  will neither be unblinded, nor reported to 
regulatory  authorities, IECs, or investigators in the event of fulfilling criteria for a SUSAR .
Notification of the IECs / IRBs
Notification of the IECs / I RBs about all relevant events (e.g. SAEs, suspected, unexpected, 
serious adve rse reactions [SUSARs]) will be performed by  the sponsor and/or by  the 
investigator according to all applicable regulations.
CONFIDENT IAL Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  BAY 94 -8862 (finerenone) / 16244
26 FEB 2019 Version 3.0 Page:  70of 139
In compliance with applicable regulations, in the event of a SUSAR, the subject’s treatment 
code will usually  be unblinded before r eporting to the competent authorities, I ECs/IRBs. For 
reporting to investigators the treatment blind will be kept.
Notification of the authorities
The processing and reporting of all relevant events (e.g. SAEs, SUSARs) to the authorities 
will be done by  the sponsor according to all applicable regulations.
Sponsor’s notification of the investigational site
The sponsor will inform all investigational sites about reported relevant events (e.g. SUSARs) 
according to all applicable regulations.
9.6.1.5 Expected adverse e vents
For this study , the applicable reference document is the most current version of the IB for 
finerenone.
Overview listings of frequent events that have occurred so far in the clinical development are 
shown in the current IB. If relevant new safet y information is identified, the information will 
be integrated into an update of the IB and distributed to all participating sites.
The expectedness of AEs will be determined b y the sponsor according to the applicable 
reference document and according to all lo cal regulations.
9.6.2 Pregnancies
Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy  test 
at screening and at yearly-intervals during study  participation. If required by  
national/institutional regulations, a serological or urine pregnancy  test in subjec ts of 
childbearing potential should be performed more often (e.g. at every  visit). 
The investigator must report to the sponsor an y pregnancy occurring in a female study subject 
during her participation in this study . The outcome of the pregnancy  should be followed up 
carefully , and any  outcome of the mother and the child at delivery  should be reported.
The child’s health should be followed up until birth.For a pregnancy  in the partner of a male study  subject, all efforts should be made to obtain 
similar i nformation on course and outcome of the pregnancy and the health of the child, 
subject to the partner’s consent.For all reports, the forms provided are to be used. The investigator should submit them within 
the same timelines as an SAE, i.e. within 24 hours of his/her awareness.

9.7 Other procedures and variables
9.7.1 Monitoring of potassiu m -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section 15.1.2.31.
Hyperkalemia is a frequent event in subjects with DKD progressing to ESRD and one of the 
main risks identified from previous studies with MRAs including finerenone. Potassium will 
be monitored closel y during this study, with assessments of potassium concentration 
scheduled at all visits (see Table 9–1 for schedule).
During treatment with study  drug, all assessments of potassium, including re -tests, will be 
performed at both local and central laboratories.  Due to sample handling and extended transportation time to the central laboratory , falsely  elevated serum potassium values in 
centrall y (but not locall y) anal yzed samples have been observed in pr evious studies with 
finerenone.  Since the value of potassium in the local sample is usually  notaffected b y this 
andresults from the local laboratory  are available earlier, local samples will be taken not only  
for safety  purposes but also for dose adjustments.
Re-checking of potassium values must be done at the latest within 72 hours of the investigator 
being aware of results that need confirmation.  The investigator can perform a re -test at any  
time if they  consider it necessary  to confirm the potassium concentration of the local or the 
central sample.
Adjustment of dose after start of study  drug intake based on blood potassium levels is 
provided in Table 9–3. 
Table 9–3 Blood potassium: guidance for dose adjustment at Visit 2 and 
subsequent visits
Blood potassium (mmol/L) Action
First sample:
≤4.8 If on lower dose of study drug, up -titrate to higher dose.
If on higher dose of study drug, continue on the same dose.
4.9 to 5.5 Continue on the same dose.
>5.5 Withhold study drug and re -check potassium within 72 hours.
Second and subsequent samples:
≤5.0 Re-start study drug at lower dose.
>5.0 Continue to withhold study drug; continue to monitor potassium and restart 
study drug at the lower dose only if potassium is ≤5.0
NOTE: lower dose =10mg once daily; higher dose =20mg once daily.

26 FEB 2019 Version 3.0 Page:  72of 139
The following aspects have also to be taken into consideration:
Blood potassium should be measured 4 weeks (± 7 days) after re -starting treatment or 
dose adjustment, especially  after up- titration
If central laboratory  results for blood potassium differ from local laboratory results to 
such an extent that the investigator is uncomfortable with the dose adjustment guidance 
shown in Table 9–3 , blood sampling may  be repeated at the investigator’s discretion
If the subject is alread y on the lower dose of study drug but h yperkalemia recurs soon 
after a previous event of hy perkalemia with interruption of study  drug, and there is 
noexplanation for the recurring h yperkalemia event other than intake of study  drug, 
permanent discontinuation of study  drug is recommended
If blood potassium is > 6.5mmol/L , an ECG should be obtained
Subjects will maintain their normal diet throughout the study  and will not be given an y 
specific advice on dietary  potassium restrictions.
9.7.2 Laboratory assessments
9.7.2.1 Central laboratory
The name and the address for the central laboratory  service provider can be found in the 
documenta tion supplied by  the vendor. Onl y centrally anal yzed blood samples will be 
considered for statistical anal ysis, unless otherwise specified. Details of the collections, 
shipment of samples and reporting of results by  the central laboratory  will be provided to the 
investigators in the Laboratory  Manual.
Laboratory  evaluations ( hematology, HbA1 c,clinical chemistry andurinalysis parameters) 
are shown in Table 9–4. Hematology , HbA1 c and (full) clinical chemistry  are considered as

9.7.2.2 Local laboratory -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section 15.1.2.32.
In addition to samples for the central laboratory , other blood safety samples will be taken 
from Visit 1 (Day  1;baseline) onwards (see Table 9–1) for analy sis at the local laboratory . 
These samples may be obtained up to 72 hours before a scheduled visit .
Thefollowing clinical chemistry  parameters must be measured for aslong as subject is not 
prematurel y discontinued from the study drug:
Blood potassium
Blood creatinine (eGFR will be calculated automatically  in the eCRF using the 
CKD -EPI formula (36)).
Up-titration of the study  drug will be based on local potassium and eGFR values and must be 
documented in the eCRF. Down -titration of the study  drug will occur for safety  reasons onl y 
(for guidance, see Section 9.7.1 and Table 7–2).
Potassium values should be recorded using a single decimal point (e.g. 4.5 mmol/L  or mEq/L).
In the event of h yperkalemia, please see Section 9.7.1 for guidance on t reatment.
In women of childbearing potential, a pregnancy test will be performed locall y, at the 
Screening Visit and following randomization at yearly visits as long as the subject is not 
permanentl y discontinued from the study  drug (since more than 7 day s). However, pregnancy  
tests in subjects of childbearing potential should be performed more frequently  (e.g. at every  
visit) if this is required by national /institutional regulations. Both serological and urine tests are 
acceptable .

9.7.3 Physical examination
Abnormal ph ysical examination findings are recorded either as medical history  or as an AE 
(see Section 9.6.1.1).
A complete ph ysical examination will be performed at the Run -In and Screening Visits, at the 
yearly visits and again at the PD and EOS Visits (see Table 9–1 ).  
9.7.4 Weight and height
Body weight (to the nearest 0.1 kg in indoor clothing without shoes) will be mea sured at 
allscheduled visits except the PT V isit(see Table 9–1). Height as well as hip and waist 
circumference in centimeters will be only measured at the Run -in Visit.
9.7.5 Measurement of vital signs
Vital si gns will be assessed at all scheduled visit sexcept the PT V isit(see Table 9–1). This 
will include blood pressure (BP) and pulse measurements.
BP will be measured b y using a standard sph ygmomanometer with an appropriate size cuff in 
the sitting position after 5 minutes of rest.
There must be 3 consecutive BP readings with at least a 1 -minute interval between each reading
(all 3 readings should be obtained within a maximum of 20 minutes).
The same arm and the appropriate size cuff should be used for measurements at each visit. 
9.7.6 Electrocardiogram (ECG) -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section 15.1.2.33.
A standard 12- lead ECG will be performed locally at the Run -In Visit, Screening Visit, at 
Visit 1 (Day  1; baseline), at the y early visits, and again at the PD and EOS Visits (see Table 
9–1). If there is an y clinical indication, unscheduled 12- lead ECGs can be performed at an y 
point during the stud y.
In addition, an ECG should be obtained if potassium >6.5 mmol/L .
The interpretation of the tracing must be made locally  by a qualified phy sician.
The date of the recording must be documented on the ECG section of the eCRF. Each ECG 
tracing should be labeled with the study  number, subject number, and date and kept in the 
source documents at the study  site.
Clinicall y significant abnormalities should be reported as AEs or outcome event as appropriate
(e.g. new onset atrial fibrillation) when not already reported in the medical histor y or in one of 
the previous recordings and in case of worsening of previous findings.
9.7.7 Health -related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaires
HRQoL  questionnaires will be completed by  the subject at Visit 1 (Day 1; baseline) , the 
yearlyvisits and at the PD and EOS Visits (see Table 9–1). The following HRQoL  
questionnaires will be used: ▪Kidney  Disease Quality  of Life (KDQOL -36) and ▪ EuroQol

questionnaires is provided in Section 16.3.
Thesubject will be instructed t o fill in the questionnaires himself / herself before any  other 
procedure of each visit. Subsequently , a member of the site investigator’s team will enter the 
responses into the eCRF.
9.7.8 Planned optional sub-studies
9.7.8.1 Sub-studies
The results of the sub -studies for Study  16244 will not be presented in its main clinical study  
report (CSR) but will be provided as separate reports.
9.7.8.1.1 Echocardiography sub-study - amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section 15.1.2.34.
At selected centers, approximately 500 subjects per study  consenting to participate in 
Studies 16244 and 17530 will be invited to take part in an echocardiography sub -study . 
Subjects will be asked to sign a separate informed consent to participate in this sub -study . 
Diabetes mellitus, hy pertension and dy slipidemia are CV risk factors which contribute to the 
CVD continuum and potentiall y results in a sequence of CV events. The develop ment of HF in 
subjects with DKD is the most common CV complication and imposes significant morbidit y 
and mortalit y (42, 43). Patients with sy mptomatic HF rEF are excluded from the P hase III 
program of finerenone in DKD. However, before becoming s ymptomatic, sub -clinical cardiac 
dysfunction and abnormal leftventricular structure including leftventricular hy pertrophy  can 
be demonstrated in the majority  of subjects with moderate CKD. Imaging plays a central role 
in the diagnosis of structural heart disease. Of the various imaging modalities available, for 
reasons of accuracy , availability , safet y and cost, echocardiograph y is the method of choice in 
subjects wi th suspected or the beginnings of structural heart disease.
In all participating sites, echocardiograph y will be performed according to a study -specific 
protocol at Visit 1 (Day 1; baseline), at yearly visits and at the end of the study  (either at the 
PDVisit or the EOS Visit) .If a baseline assessment is not available or analy sable , the subject 
will not continue in to undergo echocardiograph y assessments due to inability  to perform a 
comparison against baseline.
Echocardiography  examinations, data collec tion and procedures for central blinded adjudication 
in the echo core laboratory  are given in the Echocardiography  Manual. In addition, each time an 
echocardiography  is performed, one blood sample should be drawn to assess the following 
biomarkers shown in Table 9–5.

NT-proBNP myocardial 
pressure -volume 
overloadNT-proBNP is typically increased in patients with asymptomatic or 
symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction and is associated with coronary 
artery disease and myocardial ischemia.
Galectin -3 (Cardiac) fibroblast / 
cardiomyocyte stressGal-3 is barely detectable in cardiomyocytes but cardiac fibroblasts 
express high levels of this protein Serum Gal -3 predicts short-, mid -and 
long-term mortality and HF -associated hospitali zation in early and late 
stage HFpEF and HFrEF
sST2 Myocardial stress In HF, ST2 mRNA and protein are upregulated and protein becomes 
detectable in serum. In severe chronic HF, change in serum sST2 
independently predicts mortality or transplant.
PIIINP Tissue remodeling / 
collagen synthesisPIIINP is produced and secreted into the circulation upon collagen 
synthesis Increased baseline PIIINP levels are associated with increased 
risk of death in CHF patients and decreased in response to spironolactone or eplerenone
OPN Inflammation / tissue remodellingOPN mRNA and protein are hardly detectable in healthy myocardium, but becomes detectable upon cardiomyocyte and fibroblast injury. 
Abbreviations: CHF = chronic heart failure;  CRT = cardiac resynchronization therapy;  HFp/rEF = heart failure 
with preserved/reduced ejection fraction; NT -proBNP = N-terminal pro -peptide of brain 
natriuretic peptide; OPN = osteopontin;  PIIINP = N-terminal pro -peptide of collagen III
Local echocardiograph yexaminations will be performed to capture at least all of the variables 
listed in Table 9–6. The recordings of echocardiography examinations will be digitall y 
transferred to the vendor / echo core laboratory  (ECL ) for centralized interpretation and 
reporting. Echocardiography from videotape will be digitized, and analy ses will be performed 
on an offline anal ysis workstation. Quantitative measures on all study  echocardiographies will 
be performed b y dedicated anal ysts at the core laboratory , who will be blinded to clinical 
information and randomized treatment assignment. The echocardiograph y results will not be 
provided to sites.

The variables for evaluation in this sub -study  are as follows:
Primary  variable:
Chronic GFR slope, i.e. the rate of GFR decline from Visit 3 (Month 4) after 
randomization to the end of the treatment period.
As previously  addressed in the AASK trial, this approach is needed to address the 
biphasic change in GFR decline that is expected aft er exposure to the study drug. 
TheGFR slope will be determined separatel y during the first 4 months following 
randomization ( acute slope) and a fter 4 months (chronic slope). The acute and chronic 
phases are differentiated because the study  treatment might have acute effects on 
GFR that may  differ from its long term effects on disease progression ( 45, 46)
(anapproach approved by the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and 
Kidney  Diseases (47)).
Exploratory  variable:
oChange in GFR from Visit 1 (baseline) and at the PT Visit (recovery )
oAcute GFR changes from baseline to Visit 3 (Month 4)
oAcute GFR changes from the end of the treatment period until the end of the 
recovery  period
oCorrelation anal yses between short term GFR changes between Visit 1 (baseline) 
and Visit 3 (Month 4) after randomization, and long term GFR decline (chronic 
slope).
An ANCOVA model will be fitted to the GFR efficacy  variables including the factors 
treatment group, the stratification factors (ty pe of albuminuria, eGFR category ) and the 
baseline GFR as covariate.  Corresponding two- sided 95% confidence intervals will be 
computed. In addition, correlation analy ses between short t erm GFR changes between 
Visit 1 (baseline) and Visit 3 (Month 4) after randomization, and long term GFR decline (chronic slope).
9.8 Appropriateness of procedures / measurements
All parameters and their methods of measurement are standard variables / methods in clinical studies and / or clinical practice. They  are widely  used and generally recognized as 
reliable, accurate and relevant.

10. Statistical methods and determination of sample size
10.1 General considerations
Statistical analy sis will be performed using SAS; the version used will be specified in the 
statistical analy sis plan (SAP).
A log- normal distribution is assumed for serum creatinine and UACR. For all other metric 
variables, a normal distribution is assumed. The distributional assumptions will be 
investig ated and if necessary , nonparametric methods or transformation of the data will be 
considered. 
All variables will be analyzed b y descriptive statistical methods. The number of data 
available, mean, standard deviation (SDv), minimum, median, and maximum will be 
calculated for metric data. The geometric mean andSDvwill be provided instead of the 
arithmetic mean and SD vfor the variables where lognormal distributions are assumed. 
Frequency  tables will be generated for categorical data.
Baseline values will be defined as the last non- missing measurement before randomization
(Visit 1) . If the last observation available prior to randomization is the measurement from the 
Screening Visit, this would be used as the baseline value. This also includes assessments fr om 
a local laboratory , in case that prior to randomization, no assessment from the central 
laboratory  is available. Otherwise baseline will be missing. The measurement from the Run -in 
Visit will not be used as a baseline value. If more than one measurement was planned for a 
scheduled time point, for example blood pressure measurements and heart rate, the mean value of the last set of measurements per time point prior to randomization will be used as the 
baseline value.
Only  the data provided by  the central laboratory  will be used for analy sis, values from local 
laboratories will not be used in the statistical analy sis and listed only . 
In the event of repeated measurements for Pre- treatment Visits and the Visit 1 (Day  1; baseline),
the closest measurement prior to randomization will be used for anal ysis instead of the 
scheduled measurements. At all visits post -randomization and unless stated otherwise, onl y 
the values at scheduled measurements will be used for anal ysis.
The derived visit ‘ Any time post baseli ne’ (applicable for efficacy ) will include any  measurement 
after randomization , including unscheduled assessments. For the derived visit ‘ Any time on 
treatment ’, onl y assessments up to 30 day s after last study  drug administration, including 
unscheduled assessments, will be considered (applicable for efficacy ; for safety assessments 
within 3 day s after last study  drug administration will be considered) .
Further details on the statistical analyses will be provided in the SAP that will be approved 
before da tabase release.

of treatment are available will be classified as LOS.  Their data will be presented in the individual subject data listings but will not be included in an y statistical 
analysis.
All subjects will be anal yzed according t o the planned treatment in FAS (the intent- to-treat or 
ITTprinciple). All subjects will be anal yzed according to the actual treatment in SAF and 
PPS. If a subject receives both treatments due to a bottle error, the treatment actuall y received 
for the majo rity of the time in the study  will be used in SAF and PPS.
The stratum variable ty pe of albuminuria and eGFR category  used in the statistical analy sis 
will be derived based on the screening UACR and eGFR assessment, respectively . All 
subjects will be ana lyzed according to their correct stratification category . In the event of 
stratification errors, the primary  anal ysis will also be repeated based on the stratification 
category  used in the randomization as a sensitivity  anal ysis.

10.3.2 Treatment du ration, extent of exposure, up -titration status and 
compliance -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section 15.1.2.39.
The anal yses described in this section will be repeated for the SAF and PPS if they  differ in 
sample size from the FAS.
Treatment duration (number of months with study drug intake) will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics by  treatment group and overall. I n addition, treatment duration will be 
categorized and presented with the corresponding number and percentage of subjects b y 
treatment group and overall. Further specification of the categories will be provided in the 
SAP.
A table will be presented with the absolute and relative frequencies of subjects still in the

The extent of exposure to study  drug (total amount of intake in grams) will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics by  treatment group. 
The up -titration status (y es/no), regardless of actual or sham up -titration, will be summarized 
with absolute and relative frequencies per treatment group for each visit as well as subjects 
never up -titrated, up -titrated once, and up -titrated more than once. Compliance (as a percentage)
will be calculated as follows: 
100 * Number of taken tablets / Number of planned tablets.
The number of planned tablets will be calculated as follows:
(Day s from randomization to last intake of study  drug + 1) * Number of planned tablets per 
day.
All tablets, including the dummy  placebo tablets, will be counted. For subjects who withdraw 
prematurel y from the study drug, compliance will be calculated up to the time of last dose.
The compliance will be summarized descriptively  by treatment group and overall. In addition, 
percent of compliance will be categorized into three groups, <80%, ≥80 to ≤120% and 
>120%, and the categories will be summarized by  treatm ent group and overall.
10.3.3 Efficacy variables
The primary  and secondary  variables of efficacy  are defined in Section 9.4.
10.3.3.1 Primary efficacy variable: pri mary analysis
The primary  anal ysis of the primary  efficacy  variable will be performed in FAS.
CONFIDENT IAL Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

Randomized subjects without an event of the primary composite endpoint at the time of 
analysis will be censored at the date of their last visit or date of non -renal death. Subjects 
without information about the primary  composite endpoint after baseline will be censored at 
Day 1.
The weighted Bonferroni -Holm procedure will be used for the hierarchical testing of the 
primary  and secondary  efficacy  endpoints. 
If the primary  renal composite endpoint achieves statistical significance at a two -sided 
p-value ≤ 0.03333 (z 0.9833 = 2.128) , the secondary  CV endpoint will be tested at the 
two-sided 0.05 level. 
Alternativel y, if the secondary  CV endpoint achieves statistical significance at a 
two-sided p- value ≤ 0.01667 (z0.99167 = 2.394), the primary  renal composite endpoint 
will be tested at the two -sided 0.05 level.
Only  if both the renal and CV endpoints achieve formal statistical significance, 
canfurther secondary  endpoi nts be tested.
In order to evaluate whether finerenone is superior to placebo in prolonging the time to the 
first event of the primary composite endpoint, the following null hy pothesis will be tested 
using the log -rank test at the significance level given above:
H0: Sfinerenone (t) = S placebo (t) for all time points t ≥ 0
The alternative hy pothesis will be:
H1: Sfinerenone (t) > S placebo (t) for at least one time point t ≥ 0 and 
Sfinerenone (t) ≥Splacebo (t) for all time points t ≥ 0,
where Sfinerenone denotes the ‘ survival ’ function of the finerenone treatment group and 
Splacebo denotes the ‘ survival ’ function of the placebo treatment group. ‘ Survival ’ means 
‘noevent of the primary composite endpoint ’ in this context. 
The following decision rule to t est the null hy pothesis will be applied:
According to the size of this study  it is justified to assume under H 0a sufficiently  close 
approximation of the log- rank test ( 48) to the normal distribution. If the z- value from the 
log-rank test (for the difference Sfinerenone –Splacebo ), stratified b y the stratification factors 
(typeof albuminuria, region, eGFR category ) is larger than the critical quantile from the 
normal distribution (z 0.975= 1.960 or z 0.9833 = 2.128), the null hy pothesis will be rejected in 
favor of the alternative hy pothesis.
The nominal significance levels and the critical values at the final analy sis will be adjusted to 
account for the interim analy sis, see Section 10.5 for more details.
In order to provide a point estimate of the hazard ratio and a corresponding two-sided 95% or 96.67% confidence interval, a stratified Cox proportional regression model 
will be used. Kaplan -Meier curves will be provided for the cumulativ e proportions of events 
by treatment groups.

10.3.3.2 Primary efficacy variable: supportive analyses
The primary  anal ysis of the primary  efficacy  variable will be repeated in the PPS as a 
supportive anal ysis. Further supportive analy ses of the primary  efficacy  variable will be 
performed in the FAS and PPS .
The absolute and relative frequency  of subjects with an event of the primary  composite 
endpoint until 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months will be display ed overall and by  treatment 
group. The number of individual eve nts of the primary  composite endpoint until 6, 12, 18, 24, 
30 and 36 months will be display ed overall and by treatment group. Frequencies will be 
calculated for the number of individual events of the primary  composite endpoint per subject 
until 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months overall and by  treatment group.
Kaplan -Meier estimates (the 25th, 50th and 75thpercentile) of the time to the first event of the 
primary  composite endpoint (including 95% or 96.67% confidence interval), overall 
‘survival ’ rates at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months and Kaplan-Meier curves will be presented 
for each treatment group. These analyses will be presented in total and for each level of the 
stratification factors (t ype of albuminuria, region, eGFR category ). 
The censoring mechani sm of subjects without an event of the primary  composite endpoint at 
the time of anal ysis is assumed to be non- informative for the primary  efficacy  anal ysis. 
Sensitivity  analy ses will be performed, assessing the impact of potential informative 
censoring of such subjects. These will include the use of different imputation rules for 
considering subjects without an event of the primary  composite endpoint as having an event 
or being censored, and will be further outlined in the SAP. 
For the individual events o f the primary  composite endpoint, the number of events per patient 
year will be presented overall and by treatment group. The frequency  of events per patient 
year for a treatment group will be calculated as the number of events observed for a treatment 
group (counting all events, not only  the first one) divided by  the sum of the day s from first 
intake of study  drug for all subjects within a treatment group and multiplied by  365.25.
An ‘on-treatment ’ anal ysis will be performed, including onl y events occurring while taking 
study  drug or until 30 days after stop of study  drug. This analy sis will be performed in the 
FAS.
10.3.3.3 Secondary efficacy variables: primary analysis
The primary  anal ysis of the secondary  efficacy  variables will be anal yzed in FAS.
The testing pr ocedure for the secondary  CV composite endpoint is described in 
Section 10.3.3.1. If the null hy pothesis of both the primary  renal composite endpoint anal ysis 
and the secondary  CV composite endpoint analy sis are rejected using the Bonferroni- Holm 
procedure as described in Section 10.3.3.1, the further secondary  efficacy  variables will be 
tested hierarchicall y in the order as they  are listed in Section 9.4.2, while keeping the 
two-sided significance level of 5.0%. Otherwise, the testing of the secondary  efficacy  
variables will be performed in an explorative man ner only . 
The primary  anal ysis of the secondary  time -to-event endpoints will be analy zed analogousl y 
to the primary  anal ysis of the primary  composite endpoint.

An ANCOVA model will be fitted to the logarithmized ratios of UACR at Month 4 to UACR 
at baseli ne including the factors treatment group, the stratification factors (ty pe of 
albuminuria, region, eGFR category ) and the logarithmized baseline UACR as covariate.  
Corresponding two -sided 95% confidence intervals will be computed.  This is consistent with
the primary  analy sis of the Phase II Study  16243.
10.3.3.4 Secondary efficacy variables: supportive analyses
The primary  anal ysis of the secondary  efficacy  variables will be repeated in the PPS as a 
supportive anal ysis. Further supportive analy ses of the secondary efficacy  variables will be 
performed in FAS and PPS.
The supportive anal ysis of the secondary  time -to-event endpoints will be analy zed in the same 
way as that for the primary  composite endpoint, UACR at Month 4 will be anal yzed using an 
ANCOVA as described above. 
10.3.3.5 Analysis of other exploratory efficacy varia bles
All other efficacy  variables will be anal yzed in FAS and PPS in an explorative manner. 
10.3.3.5.1 UACR and albuminuria -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section 15.1.2.40.
UACR during the stud y will be summarized descriptively  by treatment group and visit 
including ratios to baseline. These anal yses will be performed overall and separated by  the 
stratificatio n factors (t ype of albuminuria, region and eGFR category ). 
The log-transformed ratio of UACR to baseline at each visit up to Month 24 will be anal yzed 
by a mixed model with the factors treatment group, visit, treatment by  visit interaction, 
factors for th e stratification levels (type of albuminuria, region and eGFR category ), 
log-transformed baseline value as covariate nested within ty pe of albuminuria and 
log-transformed baseline value by  visit interaction. Pairwise ratios between the finerenone 
and the placebo treatment group will be calculated and corresponding two -sided 95% 
confidence intervals will be computed.Frequency  tables will be generated for the number of subjects with a relative decrease and 
increase in UACR of ≥30%, ≥40% and ≥50% from baseline UACR. The analy sis will be 
performed for each visit and for any time post baseline. The analysis will also be performed 
stratified for each level of the stratification factors (ty pe of albuminuria, region and eGFR 
category ).
A shift table will be provide d display ing the number of subjects who changed from baseline 
to each visit from very  high albuminuria to high albuminuria, from very  high albuminuria to 
UACR < 30mg/g, from high albuminuria to UACR < 30mg/g, from high albuminuria to very  
high albuminuria and from UACR < 30mg/g to high and very  high albuminuria by  treatment 
group and overall. The albuminuria category  changes will only  be considered as shifts, if they  
are accompanied b y a UACR decrease of at least 30% from baseline to each visit.
The additio nal categorical UACR efficacy  variables listed in Section 9.4.3 will be summarized 
for presence or absence of the event using logistic regression w ith the factors treatment group

and stratification levels (type of albuminuria, region and eGFR category ). Pairwise differences 
between the finerenone and the placebo treatment group will be calculated and corresponding 
two-sided 95% confidence intervals will be computed .
10.3.3.5.2 Decrease in eGFR
eGFR will be summarized descriptivel y by treatment group and visit including absolute and 
relative changes to baseli ne. These anal yses will be performed overall and separated by  the 
stratification factors (type of albuminuria, region and eGFR category ). 
The absolute change of eGFR to baseline at each visit until Month 24 will be anal yzed by a 
mixed model with the facto rs treatment group, visit, treatment by visit interaction, factors for 
the stratification levels (type of albuminuria, region and eGFR category ), baseline value as 
covariate nested within eGFR category  and baseline by  visit interaction. Pairwise difference s 
between the finerenone and the placebo treatment group will be calculated and corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals will be computed.
Frequency  tables will be generated for the number of subjects with a relative decrease in 
eGFR of ≥30%, ≥40%, ≥50% and ≥57% from baseline eGFR. The analy sis will be performed 
for each visit and for an y time post baseline. I n addition, for each patient, the annual change 
in eGFR will be calculated by  fitting the patient’s eGFR assessments into a linear regression 
model with time as the independent variable. The derived annual change will be analy zed 
using an ANCOVA model including baseline, treatment group and stratification factors as 
fixed -effects.
10.3.3.5.3 Health -related quality of life (HR -QoL)
Domain scores for each of the 5 domains (PCS, MCS, Burden of Kidney  Disease, S ymptoms / 
Problems, and Effects of Kidney  Disease) will be calculated according to the KDQOL scoring 
instruction (http://www.rand.org/health/surveys_tools/kdqol.html [6th September 2013]). The KDQOL -36 domain scores will be presented by  visit and treatment group by  means of 
number of observations, number of missing values, minimum, first quartile, mean, SD v, 
median, third quartile, and maximum, including the changes from baseline. 
Summary  scores will be calculated out of the 5 dimensions according to the scoring 
instructions from Europe and the US [refer to the EQ-5D- 5L User Guide (49)and to the 
EQ-5D Value Sets ( 50)]. The values and the changes f rom baseline of the summary  scores 
and the EQ Visual Analogue scale (VAS) will be summarized by treatment group and visit 
using the same descriptive statistics as for KDQOL. 
For details on HR -QoL questionnaires, see Section 16.3.
10.3.3.5.4 New diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, new diagnosis of heart failure and 
regression of albuminuria
These other exploratory  efficacy  variables will be summarized for presence or absence of the 
event using logistic regression with the factors treatment group and stratification levels (type 
of albuminuria, region and eGFR category ). Pairwise differences be tween the finerenone and 
the placebo treatment group will be calculated and corresponding two -sided 95% confidence 
intervals will be computed.

10.3.3.6 Subgroup analyses
Exploratory  subgroup analy ses are planned for the primary  efficacy  variable, also the 
secondary efficacy  variables.   This will include descriptive statistics and a statistical test for 
interaction.
The following subgroups will be considered for exploratory  subgroup analyses:
Region (North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Others)
eGFR category  at screening and baseline (eGFR 25 to < 45, 45 to < 60 and 
≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2)
Type of albuminuria at screening and baseline (high albuminuria vs very  high 
albuminuria) 
History  of CVD (present, absent)
Baseline serum potassium ( ≤ 4.5 vs. > 4.5 m mol/L)
Systolic blood pressure at baseline (90 to <130 , 130 to <160 and ≥ 160 mmHg).
It is anticipated that in these proposed subgroups for anal ysis, differences in treatment effects 
may be observed according to the screening or baseline characteristics d efined, due in part to 
the differences in the risk of clinical events expected in the different subgroups.Furthermore, subgroup analy sis usuall y required will be performed, including the following 
subgroups:
Race
Gender
Age group.
10.3.4 Safety variables
All ana lyses on safety  and tolerability  data will be performed in the SAF.
The following safet y variables will be assessed during the stud y:
SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment with study  drug
Change in bod y weight
Change in serum potassium from baseline
Number of subjects with hy perkalemia (serum potassium > 5.5 mmol/L)
Number of subjects with severe h yperkalemia (serum potassium > 6.0 mmol/L )
Number of subjects with hospitalization for hy perkalemia
Number of subjects discontinuing study  drug permanently  due to hy perkalemia
Change in vital signs from baseline

Change in renal function measured b y eGFR (CKD -EPI) change from baseline
Number of subjects with hospitalization for worsening of renal function
Number of subjects discontinuing study  drug permanently  due to worsening of 
renal function
Changes in laboratory  values.
10.3.4.1 Adverse events
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA, latest version available prior to data base freeze). A listing will be provided 
linking the original investigator terms and the coded terms. AEs will also be presented 
grouped b y SMQs. 
AEs that started or worsened after the first dose of study  drug up to 3 days after any  
temporary  or permanent interruption of study  drug will be considered as treatment emergent 
AEs (TEAEs).
An overall summary of all AEs and TEAEs will be generated by  treatment group. 
The number of subjects with TEAEs, post- treatment AEs occurring more than 3 days after 
stop of study  drug, tre atment- emergent SAEs, treatment -emergent study  drug -related AEs, 
treatment -emergent study  drug -related SAEs, TEAEs causing permanent discontinuation of 
study  drug, treatment-emergent non- serious AEs, non- serious AEs, TEAEs by maximum 
intensity , treatment -emergent SAEs by  maximum intensity , drug -related TEAEs by  maximum 
intensity , TEAEs by  worst outcome and treatment -emergent SAEs by worst outcome will be 
summarized by  treatment group using MedDRA terms grouped by  Primary  System Organ 
Class and Preferred Ter m. 
In case of events with different intensit y within a subject, the maximum reported intensity  
will be used. If intensity  is missing, the event will be considered as severe. If the same event 
is reported as both unrelated and related to the study  drug wit hin a subject, the event will be 
reported as related to study  drug. If the drug relationship is missing, the event will be 
considered as being related to the study  drug.
Separate tables summarizing TEAEs, treatment- emergent study  drug -related AEs, and SAEs
that occurred in more than 5% of the subjects will be provided.Deaths, SAEs and AEs leading to permanent study drug discontinua tion will be listed 
separately .
10.3.4.2 Laboratory data
The number of subjects with treatment emergent (until 3 days after an y temporar y or 
permanent interruption of study  drug) abnormal laboratory  values above or below the normal 
range will be tabulated by  the laboratory  parameter and treatment group. 
Summary  statistics including changes to baseline will be calculated b y treatment group and 
visit for all quantitative laboratory  parameters, e.g. for hematology ,HbA1 c,clinical chemistry  
and urinal ysis. Geometric statistics and ratios to baseline will be presented for creatinine 
CONFIDENT IAL Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

instead of arithmetic statistics with changes from baseline. For eGFR the relative change will 
be display ed in addition to the absolute change from baseline.
Summary  statistics for serum potassium, eGFR and serum creatinine will also be repeated b y 
treatme nt group and visit separately  for each level of the stratification factors (ty pe of 
albuminuria, region and eGFR category ). 
The following special safety  parameters will be further assessed by  display ing the number of 
subjects with safet y events as described below by  treatment group, visit and for any  time on 
treatment (including unscheduled assessments) and up to 3 day s after last study  drug 
administration. This will also be performed by stratification factors. The summaries will be 
performed for the numbe r of subjects with
Absolute value of serum potassium >5.5 mmol/L  and >6 mmol/L  
Relative decrease from baseline in eGFR of ≥30%, ≥40%, ≥50% and ≥57%, also 
sustained decrease over 4 weeks
Absolute value of eGFR < 30 m L/min/1.73m² 
The percentage of subjects with the respective events (non- stratified) at an y time 
post-baseline (including unscheduled assessments) and within 3 day s after last study  drug 
administration will be compared between the finerenone and the placebo treatment group b y 
apply ing separate e xplorative χ² tests with continuity  correction. If the expected number of 
subjects in at least 1 cell of the 2x2 contingency  table is <5 ( 51), Fisher’s exact test will be 
applied instead of the ²test. Estimates and two- sided 95% confidence intervals will be 
provided for each treatment group and the treatment differences. Clopper Pearson confidence interva ls will be calculated for each treatment group, while for treatment differences the exact 
unconditional confidence limits will be calculated.
10.3.4.3 Vital signs
At the corresponding visits, 3 measurements of vital signs parameters will be taken in sitting 
positio n with at least a 1 -minute interval between each reading. Averages of 
non-missing values of these three measurements will be calculated and used for the statistical 
analysis. If onl y one of the planned measurements is available, this value will be used.
Vital signs values will be summarized by treatment group and visit using descriptive statistics including absolute changes from baseline. The analy sis will be repeated for SBP stratified by  
baseline SBP >90 to <130 mmHg, 130 to <160 mmHg and ≥160 mmHg.
10.3.4.4 Weight and BMI
The values and the changes from baseline will be summarized by  treatment group and visit 
using descriptive statistics for weight and BMI. 
10.3.4.5 Further safety variables
All safet y variables are listed at the start of this section.  Not covered in th e above sections is 
the presence or absence of events associated with hy perkalemia and renal failure. These will 
be summarized by  treatment group using frequency  counts.

10.3.5 Missing data / drop outs
A subject who has been randomized and discontinues study  participation prematurel y for an y 
reason, either from stud y treatment or from follow -up, is defined as a ‘ dropout’, even if 
nostudy  drug has been taken. Dropouts will not be replaced. 
Data from subjects who prematurel y terminated the study  will be used to the maximum extent 
possible.
All missing or partial data will be presented in the subject data listing as they  are recorded on 
the electronic eCRF.Sensitivity  analy ses using other imputation methods will be performed for the primary  
endpoint.For further information on missing data, please refer to Section 11.4.
10.4 Determination of sample size -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Sect ion 15.1.2.41.
This is an event -driven study . A total of 106 8primary  efficacy  endpoint events will have a 
minimum 90% power to demonstrate superiorit y of finerenone to placebo using a logrank test at 
a two -sided significance level of 3.3333%, assuming a 20% relative risk reduction, i.e. a true 
hazard ratio of 0.80 (the hazard ratio that will be observed in the study  will be different, i.e. 
closer to 1 due to treatment discontinuations ).The study  will stop when at least 106 8primary  
efficacy  endpoints accrue across both treatment arms.
With an assumed treatment duration of 44 months ( duration of recruitment period: 33 months, 
equal recruitment pattern during the accrual period, maximum treatment period of the last 
subject recruited: 1 1months), the planned total number of subjects to be randomized is 
estimated to be 4690 subjects, assuming an a nnual placebo event rate of 12%, a common 
annual lost -to-follow -uprate of 0.7% in both treatment groups, an annual finerenone 
discontinuation rate of 5% and assuming that placebo discontinuation will not change the 
hazard. 4800 subjects are planned to be randomized taking a certain ramp- up during 
recruitment into account. Assuming a screening failure rate of 50%, 9600 subjects are planned 
to be screened. 
Due to the minimal effect of the interim anal ysis on the overall power of the study , an 
adjustment of sample size would be negligible.The assumption of the annual placebo event rate of 12% is based on a recent analy sis of the 
results from the IDNT and RENAAL trials using alternative endpoints defined by  smaller 
declines in eGFR , similar to those proposed in Study  16244. Event rates were obtained from 
the respective studies in the arms where treatment would more closel y resemble that in the 
placebo population of study  16244 who will be on standard of care treatment for DKD. 
Annua l event rates for the composite renal endpoint range from 11-16% for these studies. The 
planned population of study  16244 will have some differences compared to IDNT and 
RENAAL, with a likely  lower median UACR value but comparable mean eGFR. The 
comorbidit y of diabetic retinopathy in subjects with high albuminuria may predict a higher 
CONFIDENT IAL Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  BAY 94 -8862 (finerenone) / 16244
26 FEB 2019 Version 3.0 Page:  92of 139
rate of renal events. Consequently , the assumed annual placebo event rate of 12% is assumed 
to be appropriate for this Phase III setting (10, 11 ). 
The calculations of the required total number of events and subjects to be randomized were 
performed using PASS 11 ( 52).
10.5 Planned interim analyses -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section 15.1.2.42.
One formal interim anal ysis is planned when 2/3 of the required total number of primary 
efficacy  endpoint events have been observed. Based on the assumptions fro m sample size 
determination the interim anal ysis will take place about 3 4months after start of study  
treatment . As an event -driven trial, the actual timing of the interim anal ysis will depend on the 
observed event rate, the patient recruitment rate, and length of the recruitment period.
If the interim anal ysis shows clear and consistent benefit in the finerenone treatment group, 
the DMC may  recommend earl y stud y termination. The Haybittle -Peto rule will be used to 
guide the decision regarding earl y stoppin g of the study  for success: a reduction of 3 standard 
deviations in the anal ysis of the primary  efficacy  endpoint and the secondary  CV composite 
endpoint at the interim analy sis (two- sided p -value < 0.00270). 
If the decision will be to stop the study  early for success, the final primary anal yses, both for 
the primary  and secondary  efficacy  endpoints, will be performed at an overall two -sided 
significance level of 0.270%. A group sequential design with a single interim analy sis when 
2/3 of the information i s available with a stopping rule of two- sided p < 0.00270 would 
require a final p < 0.04967 (p < 0.03283, p < 0.01576) to maintain the overall significance 
level at 5% (3.333%, 1.667%). Consequentl y, if the decision will be to continue the study 
without st opping earl y for success, the following testing procedure at the final anal ysis will 
control the overall familywise error rate at 5% according to Tang and Geller (1999) (53).
If the primary  renal composite endpoint achieves statistical significance at a two -sided 
p value ≤ 0.03283 (z 0.9836 = 2.134), the secondary  CV endpoint will be tested at the 
two sided level of 0.04967 (z 0.9752 = 1.963)
Alternativel y, if the secondary  CV endpoint achieves statistical significance at a two 
sided p value ≤ 0.01576 (z 0.9921 = 2.414), the primary  renal composite endpoint will be 
tested at the two -sided level of 0.04967 (z 0.9752 = 1.963)
Only  if both the renal and CV endpoints achieve formal statistical significance, the 
remaining secondary  endpoints wi ll be tested hierarchically  at a two -sided level of 
0.04967 (z 0.9752 = 1.963).
For a lack of efficacy , a non -binding futility  approach will be utilized at the time of the 
planned interim anal ysis. If the conditional probability of rejecting the null hy pothesis for the 
primary  comparison, given the assumed and current event rates, falls to an unacceptabl y low 
level (as will be specified in the DMC Charter), the DMC may  consider recommending earl y 
termination of the study .

The Executive Committee will oversee overall blinded event rates to ensure that they  meet 
protocol projections. If overall event rates are lower than expected, consideration will be 
given to altering the trial design, such as increasing the sample size or extending the study  
duration without knowledge of an y treatment effect.
11. Data handling and quality assurance
11.1 Data recording
The data collection tool for this study  will be a validated electronic data capture sy stem called 
RAVE. Subject data necessary  for anal ysis and reporting will be entered /transmitted into a 
validated database or data sy stem. 
Data required according to this protocol will be recorded b y investigational site personnel via 
data entry  into the internet based EDC software sy stem RAVE, which Bayer has licensed 
from Medidata Solutions Worldwide. RAVE has been validated b y Medidata Solutions 
Worldwide and Bay er for use in its clinical studies. RAVE allows for the application of 
software logic to set -up data entry  screens and data checks to ensure the completeness and 
accuracy  of th e data entered b y the site personnel. Bayer extensively applies the logic to 
ensure data are complete and reflect the clinical data requirements of the study . Data queries 
resulting from the application of the software logic are resolved b y the site personnel. The 
data are stored at a secure host facility  maintained by  Medidata Solutions Worldwide and 
transferred on a periodic basis to Bay er's internal computer sy stem via a secure Virtual Private 
Network.
All access to the RAVE system is through a password- protected security  system that is part of 
the RAVE software. All internal Bay er and external investigator site personnel seeking access 
must go through a thorough RAVE training process before they  are granted access to RAVE 
for use in Bay er's clinical studies. Training records are maintained.
All personnel with access to the RAVE sy stem are supported by  a Service Desk staffed with 
trained personnel to answer questions and ensure access is maintained such that data entry  can 
proceed in a timely  manner.
The R AVE Sy stem contains a sy stem -generated audit trail that captures any changes made to 
a data field, including who made the change, wh y the change was made and the date and time 
it was made. This information is available both at the investigator’s site and a t Bay er. Data 
entries made in the RAVE EDC screens are supported by source documents maintained for all 
subjects enrolled in this study .
Source documentation
It is the expectation of the sponsor that key  data entered into the eCRF has source 
documentation available at the site.
Study -specific data (race and ethnic group) may  be entered directl y into the CRF, without 
availability  of corresponding source documentation.  For all other data, source documentation 
must be available at the site.
CONFIDENT IAL Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  BAY 94 -8862 (finerenone) / 16244
26 FEB 2019 Version 3.0 Page:  94of 139
The site must impl ement processes to ensure availability  of all required source 
documentation. A source document checklist (not part of this protocol) will be used at the site 
to identify  the source data for key  data points collected and the monitor will work with the site 
to complete this.
Data recorded from screening failures
Data of ‘ only screened subjects ’ will be recorded at least as source data, as far as the reason 
for the premature discontinuation is identifiable. At minimum, the following data should be 
recorded in the eCRF:
Demographic information (subject number; year of birth /age; sex; if applicable race / 
ethnicity )
Date of informed consent
Reason for premature discontinuation
Date of last visit.
These data will be transferred to the respective database.
11.2 Monitoring
In accordance with applicable regulations, GCP, and sponsor’s/CRO’s procedures, monitors will contact the site prior to the start of the study  to review with the site staff the protocol, 
study  requirements, and their responsibilities to satisfy  regulatory , ethical, and sponsor’s 
requirements. When reviewing data collection procedures, the discussion will also include identification and documentation of source data items.
The sponsor/designee will monitor the site activity  to verify  that the:
Data are authentic, accurate and complete. 
Safety  and rights of subjects are being protected
Study  is conducted in accordance with the currently  approved protocol 
(including stud y treatment being used in accordance with the protocol)
Any other study  agreemen ts, GCP, and all applicable regulatory  requirements are met.
The investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to allow the 
monitor direct access to all relevant documents.
11.3 Data processing
Data will be collected as described in Section 11.1. Clinical data management will be 
performed in accordance with applicable sponsor’s/CRO’s standards and data cleaning procedures. This is applicable for data recorded on eCRF as well as for data from other 
sources (e.g. I xRS, laboratory , adjudication committees).
CONFIDENT IAL Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

26 FEB 2019 Version 3.0 Page:  95of 139
For data coding (e.g. AEs, medication), internationally  recognized and accepted dictionaries 
will be used.
11.4 Missin g data 
All efforts will be made to collect complete data for all subjects randomized in this study . 
Subjects will be followed until the end of the study, and all required data will be collected, 
regardless of their compliance with study  medication use or visit schedule.
After randomization, study  drug discontinuation for any  reason does not constitute withdrawal 
from the study  and should not lead to the subject being withdrawn from the study . On the 
contrary , even subjects who have stopped taking study  drug are expected to attend all the 
protocol specified stud y visits and will be encouraged to perform all assessments as stipulated 
in the visit schedule.
If it is not possible for a subject who has withdrawn from study  drug to attend any  visit(s) in 
person, the site staff will keep in touch with the subject by means of phone contact to the 
subject himself/herself, or to a person pre -designated by  the subject, in accordance with the 
subject’s study  visit schedule. Data will continue to be collected about the s ubject’s health 
status, including information on developing of renal or CV complications and vital status. This information may  be provided either by  the subject himself/herself, his/her general 
practitioner or a famil y relative (if allowed in the respecti ve country ). Data, such as 
information on survival and potential protocol- specified endpoints, might be also collected 
from a healthcare provider, from public or medical records, or other sources as available according to local guidelines and as allowed b ylocal regulations. These data will be collected 
until the study  is concluded, even if the subject no longer attends study  visits in person, 
unless the subject withdrew consent and did not agree to release further information.
When an event date is not kn own, the site investigator will be asked to provide a best- estimate 
as to when the event occurred. Even though the exact date of an event is unknown, the investigator often has some information that would give an approximate date (e.g. the first week of a month, the fall of a year, or the middle of a particular y ear) or at least the 
date when the subject was last seen or contacted. This information can be meaningfully  
incorporated into the estimated date recorded, as this is likely  to be closer to the true date than 
any produced by  an uninformed computer algorithm. This estimated date should be the 
middle date within the period that the event is known to have occurred. If the event is known to have occurred in the first week of a month, then the date in the middle of that week should 
be recorded as the estimate. If it occurred in the fall of a y ear, then the middle date in the fall 
is the appropriate estimate. If no information is known, then the date in the middle of the plausible time period should be given , based on the last contact with the subject prior to the 
event and the date of contact when information about the event was known.
Data from subjects who prematurel y terminate the study  will be used to the maximum extent 
possible. All missing or partial d ata will be presented in the subject data listing as they  are 
recorded on the eCRF. Data are collected primarily  through an EDC sy stem, which allows 
ongoing data entry  and monitoring.

For those subjects who withdraw consent, sensitivity  analy ses will be pe rformed to assess the 
impact of potential informative censoring of such subjects. These will include the use of 
different imputation rules for considering subjects without an event of the primary  composite 
endpoint as having an event or being censored.
11.5 Audit and inspection
To ensure compliance with GCP and regulatory  requirements, a member of the sponsor’s (or a 
designated CRO’s) quality  assurance unit may  arrange to conduct an audit to assess the 
performance of the study at the study  site and of the study  documents originating there. The 
investigator/institution will be informed of the audit outcome.
In addition, inspections by regulatory  health authority  representatives and IEC(s)/I RB(s) are 
possible. The investigator should notify  the sponsor immediate ly of any  such inspection.
The investigator/institution agrees to allow the auditor or inspector direct access to all relevant 
documents and allocate his/her time and the time of his/her staff to the auditor/inspector to discuss findings and an y issues. Audits and inspections may  occur at an y time during or after 
completion of the study .
11.6 Archiving
Essential documents shall be archived safel y and securel y in such a way that ensures that they  
are readil y available upon authorities’ request.
Patient (hospital) files will be archived according to local regulations and in accordance with 
the maximum period of time permitted by the hospital, institution or private practice. Where the archiving procedures do not meet the minimum timelines required b y the sponsor, 
alternative arrangements must be made to ensure the availability of the source documents for 
the required period.
The investigator/institution notifies the sponsor if the archival arrangements change (e.g. 
relocation or transfer of ownership).
The investiga tor site file is not to be destroy ed without the sponsor’s approval.
The contract with the investigator/institution will contain all regulations relevant for the study  site.

12. Premature termination of the study
The sponsor has the right to close this study  (or, if applicable, individual segments thereof 
[e.g. centers]) at an y time, which may  be due but not limited to the following reasons: 
If risk -benefit ratio becomes unacceptable owing to, for example,
Safety  findings from this study  (e.g. SAEs)
Results of any interim analy sis
Results of parallel clinical studies
Results of parallel animal studies 
(on e.g. toxicity , teratogenicity , carcinogenicity  or reproduction toxicity ).
If the study  conduct (e.g. recruitment rate; drop -out rate; data quality; protocol compliance) 
does not suggest a proper completion of the trial within a reasonable time frame .
The investigator has the right to close his/her center at an y time.
For an y of the above closures, the following applies:
Closures should occur only  after consultation between involved parties. Final decision 
on the closure must be in writing.
All affected institutions (e.g. IEC(s)/IRB(s); competent authority(ies); study center; head of stud y center) must be informed as applicable according to local law.
Allstudy  materials (except documentation that has to remain stored at site) must be 
returned to the sponsor. The investigator will retain all other documents until 
notification is given b y the sponsor for destruction.
In the event of a partial study  closure, ongoing subjects must be taken care of in an 
ethical manner.

13.1.1 Executive Committee
The Executive Committee, which consists of external experts in the area of nephrology , 
diabetology  and cardiology , will ensure the overarching integrit y of the study. 
TheExecu tiveCommittee will be established for Study  16244 and Study  17530. The 
committee’s responsibilities include the following: 
Review feedback from the independent DMC
Input into the Clinical Event Committee (CEC) charter
Provision of recommendations regarding sub- studies and amendments to the protocol
Contribution to and oversight of publications and communication of study  results
Projecting stud y termination, and other study -related activities as appropriate
Overseeing overall blinded event rates to ensure that they  meet protocol projections.
Decisions will be made by  consensus; in the absence of consensus, the co -Chairs of the 
Executive Committee will provide their recommendation to the Sponsor for final determination.
13.1.2 Clinical Event Committee (CEC)
A Clinical Event Committee (CEC), blinded to study treatment assignment, will adjudicate all events that could potentially  fulfill the criteria for the primary , secondary  or other endpoints 
during the stud y.

No.  BAY 94 -8862 (finerenone) / 16244
26 FEB 2019 Version 3.0 Page:  99of 139
The CEC Charter will describe the roles and res ponsibilities of the CEC and define the events to 
be adjudicated and the manner in which they  will be adjudicated. The CEC will judge whether 
an event meets the predetermined definitions. The co -Chairs of the CEC will be members of the 
Executive Committee established for Study  16244 and Study  17530.
All of the endpoint events shown in Table 13–1 will be reported to the CEC.
Table 13–1 Endpoint events to be reported to the Clinical Event Committee (CEC)
●  Kidney failure
●  Decrease of eGFR of ≥40% from baseline, confirmed by at least one additional standardized 
measurement at least 4 weeks after the initial measurement
●  Decrease of eGFR of ≥57% from baseline, confirmed by at least one additional standardized 
measurement at least 4 weeks after the initial measurement
●  Decrease of eGFR to l ess than 15 mL/min/1.73m², confirmed by at least one additional 
standardized measurement at least 4 weeks after the initial measurement
●  CV and renal death events
●  Non -fatal m yocardial infarction
●  Non -fatal stroke
●  Hospitalization for heart failure
●  Other CV hospitalization
●  New onset of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter
Note: Other endpoints of interest may be added. These will be specified in the CEC Charter.
The CEC will be responsible for classify ing all death and hospitalization events and for 
determining whether pre -specified endpoint criteria were met for CV, renal or other fatal and 
non-fatal events. Sites are instructed to take a conservative approach when reporting 
endpoints; if the investigator suspects an endpoint may  have occurred, it is best to report the 
event to the CEC for a final determination.
Reporting guidelines for AEs and SAEs as outlined in Sections 9.6.1.1 and9.6.1.4 must 
be followed if the event is not a defined endpoint (see Table 13–1).

13.1.3 Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)
Ongoing safet y monitoring during the conduct of the study will be performed by an external 
and independent DMC. An independent statistical analy sis center (SAC) will be involved in 
processing unblinded safety  data for the DMC. Analy sis periods and procedur es will be 
defined in an operational charter (DMC charter) filed in the study  file. 
Outcome events as defined in Section 9.6.1.3.1 will not be rep orted as AEs or SAEs by  the 
investigators; however, they  will be collected in the eCRF. The independent DMC will 
periodicall y review and assess all outcome events as well as safet y data from the study  for 
imbalances in safet y outcomes in an unblinded manne r. It is believed that in this way , patient 
safety can continue to be monitored throughout the duration of the trial, and the integrit y of the 
study  maintained. If unexpected safet y issues are identified, specific amendments will be 
implemented based on th e recommendation of the DMC .
Following data review, the DMC will provide written recommendations that will be 
transferred to the chairmen of the Executive Committee and Bay er. DMC opinions and 
recommendations will be notified by  Bayer as soon as possible t o the competent authorities 
and the IECs where they  qualify  for expedited reporting.
13.1.4 Steering Committee 
The Steering Committee will consist of country  representative(s) and will be led by  the 
Executive Committee. The Steering Committee will be blinded to the study  data while the 
trial is ongoing. Their main responsibilities are as follows: 
Provide input to protocol- related issues and protocol amendments that may  arise 
during the course of the study
Oversee study  progress and provide recommendations to Exe cutive Committee in 
regards to an y necessary  modifications that may  be required in study  conduct or study  
monitoring
Transmission of information to individual investigators
Serve as resource for scientific review of sub -studies, publications, presentations
and/or educational material as applicable.
13.2 Funding and financial disclosure
Funding
This study  will be funded by  its sponsor.
Financial disclosure Each investigator (including principal and/or an y sub investigators) who is directly  involved 
in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects has to provide a financial disclosure 
according to all applicable legal requirements. All relevant documentation will be filed in the trial master file.

13.3 Ethical and legal conduct of the study
The procedures set out in this protocol, pertaining to the conduct, evaluation, and 
documentation of this study , are designed to ensure that the sponsor and investigator abide by  
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and the guiding principles detailed in the Declaration o f Helsinki. The study  will also be carried out in keeping with applicable local 
law(s) and regulation(s).
Documented approval from appropriate IEC(s)/IRBs will be obtained for all participating 
centers/countries before start of the study , according to GCP, local laws, regulations and 
organizations. When necessary , an extension, amendment or renewal of the I EC/IRB approval 
must be obtained and also forwarded to the sponsor. The responsible unit (e.g. IEC/I RB, head 
of the study  center/medical institution) mus t supply to the sponsor, upon request, a list of the 
EC/I RB members involved in the vote and a statement to confirm that the IEC/IRB is 
organized and operates according to GCP and applicable laws and regulations.
Strict adherence to all specifications laid down in this protocol is required for all aspects of 
study  conduct; the investigator may  not modify  or alter the procedures described in this 
protocol. Modifications to the study  protocol will not be implemented by  either the sponsor or the 
investigator without agreement by  both parties. However, the investigator or the sponsor may  
implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) 
to the trial subjects without prior IEC/I RB/sponsor approval/favorable opinion. As soon as 
possible, the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it and if appropriate the proposed protocol amendment should be submitted to the I EC/IRB/head of medical 
institution/sponsor. Any  deviations from the protocol must be explained and documented b y 
the investigator.
Details on discontinuation of the entire stud y or parts thereof can be found in Section 12.
13.4 Subject information and cons ent
All relevant information on the study  will be summarized in an integrated subject information 
sheet and informed consent form provided b y the sponsor or the study center. A sample 
subject information and informed consent form will be provided as a docu ment separate to 
this protocol.Based on this subject information sheet, the investigator or designee will explain all relevant 
aspects of the stud y to each subject / legal representative or prox y consenter (if the subject is 
under legal protection), prior to his/her entry  into the study  (i.e. before an y examinations and 
procedures associated with the selection for the study  are performed or an y study -specific data 
is recorded on study -specific forms).
The investigator will also mention that written approval of the IRB/IEC has been obtained.
CONFIDENT IAL Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

26 FEB 2019 Version 3.0 Page:  102of 139
Each subject / legal representative or prox y consenter will be informed about the following 
aspects of premature withdrawal:
Each subject has the right to withdraw from the study  at any  time without any  
disadvantage and without having to provide reasons for this decision. 
The subject’s consent covers end -of-study  examinations as specified in the visit 
description described in Section 9.2to be conducted after withdrawal of consent. 
The subject’s data that have been collected until the time of withdrawal will be 
retained and statistically  anal yzed in accordance with the statistical analy sis plan. 
Subject -specific data on the basis of material obtained before withdrawal may  be 
generated after withdrawal (e.g. image reading, analysis of biological specimen such 
as blood, urine or tissues); these data would also be retained and statistically anal yzed 
in accordance with the statistical anal ysis plan. The subject has the right to object to 
the generation and processing of this post-withdrawal data. For this, he/she needs to sign a corresponding declaration of objection; alternatively , the subject’s oral 
objection m ay be documented in the subject’s source data.
Each subject / legal representative or prox y consenter will have ample time and opportunity  to 
ask questions.
Only  if the subject / legal representative or proxy  consenter voluntaril y agrees to sign the 
inform ed consent form and has done so, may  he/she enter the stud y. Additionally , the 
investigator will personally  sign and date the form. The subject / legal representative or prox y 
consenter will receive a copy  of the signed and dated form.
The signed informed consent statement is to remain in the investigator site file or, if locall y 
required, in the subject’s note/file of the medical institution.In the event that informed consent is obtained on the date that baseline study procedures are 
performed, the study  record or subject’s clinical record must clearl y show that informed 
consent was obtained prior to these procedures.
If the subject is not capable of providing a signature, a verbal statement of consent can 
also be given in the presence of an impartial witness (independent of the sponsor and 
the investigator). This is to be documented b y a signature from the informing 
physician as well as by  a signature from the witness.
For adults under legal protection, consent shall be given b y the legal guardian(s). The 
consent of an adult under legal protection shall also be requested where such a person is able to express his/her own will. His/her refusal or the withdrawal of his/her consent may not be disregarded.
The informed consent form and an y other written informa tion provided to subjects / legal 
representatives or prox y consenters will be revised whenever important new information 
becomes available that may  be relevant to the subject’s consent, or there is an amendment to 
the protocol that necessitates a change to the content of the subject information and / or the 
written informed consent form. The investigator will inform the subject / legal representative 
CONFIDENT IAL Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  BAY 94 -8862 (finerenone) / 16244
26 FEB 2019 Version 3.0 Page:  103of 139
or prox y consenter of changes in a timel y manner and will ask the subject to confirm his/her 
participation in the study  by signing the revised informed consent form. Any  revised written 
informed consent form and written information must receive the IEC/I RB`s approval / 
favorable opinion in advance of use.
13.5 Publication policy and use of data
The sponsor has made the information regarding the study  protocol publicly  available on the 
internet at www.clinicaltrials.gov. 
All data and results and all intellectual propert y rights in the data and results derived from the 
study  will be the property  of the sponsor who may  utilize them in various way s, such as for 
submission to government regulatory  authorities or disclosure to other investigators.
Regarding public disclosure of study results, the sponsor will fulfill its obligations according 
to all applicable laws and regulations. The sponsor is interested in the publication of the results of every  study  it performs. 
The sponsor recognizes the right of the investigator to publish the results upon completion of the study . However, the investigator, whi lst free to utilize study  data derived from his/her 
center for scientific purposes, must obtain written consent of the sponsor on the intended publication manuscript before its submission. To this end, the investigator must send a draft of the publication manuscript to the sponsor within a time period specified in the contract. 
The sponsor will review the manuscript promptly  and will discuss its content with the 
investigator to reach a mutually  agreeable final manuscript. 
13.6 Compensation for health damage of subjects / insurance
The sponsor maintains clinical trial insurance coverage for this study  in accordance with the 
laws and regulations of the country  in which the study  is performed.
13.7 Confidentiality
All records identify ing the subject will be kept confidential and, to the extent permitted by  the 
applicable laws and/or regulations, will not be made publicly available.
Subject names will not be supplied to the sponsor. Only the subject number will be recorded 
in the eCRF, and if the subject name appears on a ny other document (e.g. pathologist report), 
it must be obliterated before a cop y of the document is supplied to the sponsor. Study findings 
stored on a computer will be stored in accordance with local data protection laws. As part of the informed consent process, the subjects will be informed in writing that representatives of 
the sponsor, IEC/I RB, or regulatory  authorities may  inspect their medical records to verify  the 
information collected, and that all personal information made available for inspection will be 
handled in strictest confidence and in accordance with local data protection laws.

15.Protocol amendments
15.1 Amendment 3
Amendment 3 is the first global amendment dated 02 MAY 2017.  The following is an 
overview of the changes made to the original Protocol Versio n 1.0.
15.1.1 Overview of changes to the study
The original protocol for this study  was amended for the following reasons:
1)To account for the lower than expected recruitment rate, the duration of study  and the 
number of sites required worldwide were increased.
2)Toallow re -screening at an earlier stage and even if the reason for initial screen failure 
was an elevated blood potassium value, the re -screening rules were amended.
3)To allow randomization of patients with a recent CVD episode (i.e. those suffering 
from st roke, transient ischemic cerebral attack, acute coronary  syndrome or 
hospitalization for worsening heart failure in the last 30 day s prior to the Screening 
visit), the respective Exclusion criterion (#7) was modified.
4)In order to allow up -titration of stud y drug at an y time during the stud y (from Visit 2 
onwards), the instructions for up- titration were modified. Additionally , a requirement 
to specify  the reason for not dispensing the 20 mg dose in the eCRF was added.
5)The recommended blood pressure targets after randomization were updated according 
to the most recent literature.
6)The definition of the endpoint “kidney failure” was added.
7)Administrative changes: Sponsor name was updated (Bay er AG became the sponsor for ongoing Bay er 
HealthCare AG sponsored studies on 1
stJuly 2016), Sponsor for US territory  was 
added, contact details for Sponsor’s medical expert were updated, and terminology  
changes due to updated Operating Instructions (“protocol deviation” was replaced b y 
“validity  finding”) were made. 
8)Toimprove clarit y and correct t ypographical errors or inconsistencies.

15.1.2 Changes to the protocol text
In the sections on changes to the protocol text, all protocol sections affected by  the respective 
amendment are detailed; the sequence of the sectio ns follows the structure of the most recent 
previous protocol version. As applicable, changes to the protocol text are highlighted as 
follows:
Addition of a whole new portion Brief identification of the new portion
Removal of a whole portion Complete display  of the removed portion, formatted 
as crossed out
Editing of an existing portion Comparative presentation of “old text” versus “new 
text”, with “old text” referring to the most recent 
previous protocol version. Deletions are crossed out
inthe “old text”. Additions are underlined in the 
“new text”. 
Tables / figures The term “amended” is added to the caption.
Terminological changes Brief specification of the terminological change
Thus, in this section, a terminological change (e.g. 
“period” versus “epoch”) is defined only  once, 
without display ing “old text” versus “new text” for 
each appearance.
Corrections of typos or omissions are not highlighted in this section.

before the visit and on the day of the visit and the exact sampling time will have to be recorded in the eCRF. If the trough sample was not taken at Visit 3 it 
should be obtained at Visit 4 (see Section 9.5).
oStudy drug will be taken as usual , ideally in the morning at home. One PK sample will be drawn during the visit. The exact time of study drug intake and the 
exact sampling times will have to be recorded in the eCRF.

measurement.  ESRD is defined as the initiation of chronic dial ysis (haemo - or peritoneal-
dialy sis) for at least 90 day s or renal transplantation. I n addition, t he eGFR threshold of 15 
mL/min/1.73 m² is consistent with the definition of kidney  failure from KDIGO (Kidney  
Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) (3) and was chosen in order to include an objective 
component to the endpoint because the decision to initiate dialy sis therap y or kidney  
transplantation may  be affected b y factors other than the eGFR. All other definitions of

15.1.2.41 Section 10.4 Determination of sample size
Old text:
This is an event -driven study . A total of 1061 primary  efficacy  endpoint events will have 
90% power to demonstrate superiorit y of finerenone to placebo using a logrank test at a two -
sided significance level of 3.3333%, assuming a 20% relative risk reduction, i.e. a true hazard 
ratio of 0.80 (t he hazard ratio that will be observed in the study  will be different, i.e. closer to 1 
due to treatment discontinuations). The study  will stop when at least 1061 primary  efficacy  
endpoints accrue across both treatment arms.
With an assumed study duration of 39 months (duration of recruitment period: 24months, 
equal recruitment pattern during the accrual period, maximum treatment period of the last 
subject recruited: 15months), the planned total number of subjects to be randomized is 
estimated to be 4701 subjects, assuming an a nnual placebo event rate of 12%, a common 
annual lost -to-follow -uprate of 0.7% in both treatment groups, an annual finerenone 
discontinuation rate of 5% and assuming that placebo discontinuation will not change the 
hazard. [...]
The assumption of the annual placebo event rate of 12% is based on the results from the 
MICRO -HOPE, RENAAL, IDNT, ALTITUDE and SAVOR -TIMI 53 trials. The l atter 2 are 
more recent studies. Event rates were obtained from the respective studies in the arms where 
treatment would more closely  resemble that in the placebo population of the CV -DKD study  
who will be on standard of care treatment for DKD. Annual even t rates for the composite CV
endpoint range from 7-10% for older studies and 5- 6% for more recent studies. As the 
anticipated population of Study  16244 will be more enriched for CV outcomes than 
ALTITUDE and SAVOR -TIMI 53 with regard to the requirement for CV history  or CV risk 
factors for subjects with high albuminuria, a likely  lower mean eGFR and higher median 
UACR value, the assumed annual placebo event rate of 12% is assumed to be appropriate for 
this Phase III setting.

The assumption of the annual placebo event rate of 12% is based on a recent analy sis of the 
results from the IDNT and RENAAL trials using alternative endpoints defined by  smaller 
declines in eGFR, similar to those proposed in Study  16244. Event rates were obtained from 
the respective studies in the arms where treatment would more closel y resemble that in the 
placebo population of study  16244 who will be on standard of care treatment for DKD. 
Annual event rates for the composite renal endpoint range from 11-16% for these studies. The 
planned population of study  16244 will have some differences compared to IDNT and 
RENAAL, with a likely  lower median UACR value but comparable mean eGFR. The 
comorbidity  of diabetic retinopathy  in subjects with high albuminuria may  predict a higher 
rate of renal events. Consequently , the assumed annual placebo event rate of 12% is assumed 
to be appropriate for this Phase III setting
15.1.2.42 Section 10.5 Planned interim analyses
Old text:
One formal interim anal ysis is planned when 2/3 (707) of the required total number of 
primary  efficacy  endpoint events have been observed. Based on the assumptions from sample 
size determination the interim anal ysis will take place about 30 months after stud y initiation .
New text:One formal interim anal ysis is planned when 2/3 of the required total number of primary 
efficacy  endpoint events have been observed. Based on the assumptions from sample size 
determination the interim anal ysis will take place about 34 months after start of study  
treatment. As an event -driven trial, the actual timing of the interim anal ysis will depend on the 
observed event rate, the patient recruitment rate, and length of the recruitment period.

16.3 HR-QoL questionnaires
KDQOL-36 is a specific measure of health- related quality  of life for CKD that includes 
effects and burden of kidney  disease as well as phy sical and mental health scores. 
Two forms of the KDQOL exist: the KDQOL- SF and th e KDQOL -36. Both were developed
by the Kidney Disease Quality  of Life Working Group at RAND Corporation. Th e 
KDQOL -SF is based on the SF -36 with additional questions specific to kidney  disease 
concerning s ymptoms and problems, effects of kidney  disease on daily  life, burden of 
kidney disease, cognitive function, work status, sexual function, quality  of social interaction, 
and sleep ( 55). It was developed for use with a dialy sis patient populati on but it has also been 
found to be valid and reliable in a kidney  transplant patient population (56). Studies using the 
KDQOL revealed that psychological factors, including depression, were a much stronger 
determinant of qualit y of life than biological me asures like dial ysis adequacy  (57). While the 
KDQOL -SF has 134 questions the shorter form KDQOL -36 consists of 36 questions and 
contains the SF- 12. The items of the KDQOL -36 are grouped as shown in Table 16–4.
The EQ-5D-5L was introduced in 2005. The EQ -5D-5L still consists of 2 pages: the 
EQ-5D- 5L descriptive s ystem and the EQ Visual Analogue scale (EQ VAS). 
Thedescriptive system comprises the same 5 dimensions as the EQ- 5D-3 L (mobility , 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Ho wever, each dimension 
now has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and 
extreme problems.

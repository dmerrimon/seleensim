Page 9 of 63 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
  1.1 Disease Background 
In the United States, bladder cancer is a common malignancy with an estimated 74,690 new 
cases and 15,580 deaths projected for the year 20141. Although a chemo-sensitive disease 
initially, the median overall survival of patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) treated 
with first-line cisplatin-based combination c hemotherapy is only approximately 15 months 2. 
Outcomes for cisplatin-ineligible patients is even more disappointing with median overall survival 
around 8 months3. Hence, patients with advanced UC who ar e ineligible for cisplatin represent an 
area of unmet need in urothelial cancer. Platinum-refractory urothelial cancer also continues to be exceedingly lethal disease despite the recent  data on activity of checkpoint inhibitor 
immunotherapy as the response ra tes are approximately 16-20% only. 
Pembrolizumab (also known as MPDL3280A; anti-PDL1) is a blocking monoclonal antibody 
against anti-PDL1 and PD1 respectively designed to disrupt the interactions of PD1 with PDL1. 
By inhibiting PDL1-PD1 interaction, such therapies, PDL1 may enable the activation of T cells. 
1.1.1 Activity of anti-PD therapy in UC:  
Recently, checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy ha s been clinically validated in metastatic UC as 
well in other cancer types4,5. The PD-1 receptor-ligand interaction is a major immune checkpoint 
hijacked by tumors to suppress  immune control. The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the 
cell surface of activated T-cells under healthy conditions, is to down-modulate unwanted or 
excessive immune responses, including autoi mmune reactions. PD-1 (encoded by the gene 
Pdcd1) is an immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily member related to cluster of differentiation 28 
(CD28) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associat ed protein 4 (CTLA-4), which has been shown to 
negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or 
PDL2).  
On May 18, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted regular approval to 
pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA, Merck and Co., Inc.) for patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have dise ase progression during or following platinum 
containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum 
containing chemotherapy. 
FDA also granted approval to pembrolizumab for patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
urothelial carcinoma who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. The FDA 
approval was based on a single-arm trial in 370 patients (KEYNOTE-052) wi th locally advanced 
or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who were deemed not eligible for cisplatin-containing 
chemotherapy. 
1.1.2 Activity of anti-PD therapy in cispla tin-ineligible patients with advanced UC – 
Pembrolizumab 
The regular approval for the second-line indicati on was based on data from Trial KEYNOTE-045, 
a multicenter, randomized, active-controlled trial in  patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
urothelial carcinoma with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. 
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (n=270) or investigator’s choice of a chemother apy regimen (paclitaxel [n=84], docetaxel [n=84], 
or vinflunine [n=87]) every 3 weeks (n=272). The trial demonstrated statistically significant improvements in overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR) for patients assigned to 
pembrolizumab as compared to chemotherapy. Median OS was 10.3 and 7.4 months in the 
pembrolizumab and chemotherapy arms, respectively  (HR 0.73; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.91, p=0.004). 
ORR was 21% for pembrolizumab and 11% for chemotherapy (p=0.002). No statistically significant difference in progression-free su rvival between the two arms was observed. 
UMCC 2017.077  
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 10 of 63 The accelerated approval for the first-line i ndication was based on data from KEYNOTE-052, a 
single-arm, open-label trial in 370 patients wi th locally advanced or metastatic urothelial 
carcinoma who were deemed not eligible for cisp latin-containing chemotherapy. Patients received 
pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. With a m edian follow-up time of 7.8 months, the ORR 
was 28.6% (95% CI 24, 34) and the median response duration was not reached (range 1.4+, 
17.8+ months). 
1.1.3 Chemoimmunotherapy: 
For many tumors, checkpoint blockade alone has not provided significant benefits or been 
suboptimal6,7. It has been suggested that the immune syst em could be potentiated with “priming” 
prior to or in conjunction with an immunotherapy agent8. Although numerous chemotherapy 
agents have known immunosuppressive adverse events,  some may possess this “priming” effect 
to the host immune system, helping to elicit an antitumor T-cell response. Cytotoxic killing of 
tumors provides a natural source of cancer -associated antigens. Therefore, combining 
chemotherapy with a checkpoint inhibitor could create an immunogenic “feedback loop”, 
increasing antigen presentation and immune response8. 
In addition to direct cytotoxic killing of tumor cells, standard chemotherapeutic agents can elicit 
immunogenicity through various mechanisms8-10. In brief, many cytotoxic agents have been 
shown to recruit immune cells (i.e., dendritic ce lls, macrophages, and natural killer cells) to the 
tumor microenvironment, enhance tumor-cell deat h by converting dying tumor cells into 
endogenous vaccines, stimulate natural kille r-dependent antitumor immunity and T-cell 
responses, induce phagocytosis of cell debris by  dendritic cells and antigen presentation to T 
cells, sensitize tumor cells to cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and disrupt immune suppressor 
mechanisms by selectively depleting myeloid- derived suppressor cells and suppressing 
regulatory T cells. These immunomodulatory pr operties make chemotherapy agents ideal 
candidates for combination with immunotherapies. 
Although high doses of chemotherapy can be i mmunosuppressive, chemotherapy agents can 
enhance the antitumor activity of immunotherapy wh en given at an optimal dose (i.e., lower dose 
such as weekly regimens)11-13. In a preclinical mouse model of relapsed ovarian cancer, a dose 
dense regimen of low-dose paclitaxel/carboplatin  versus the maximum-tolerated-dose regimen 
was less toxic to the immune system, reduced i mmunosuppression by components of the tumor 
microenvironment, and stimulated recruitment of macrophages and CD8+ T cells to tumors14. 
Preclinical evidence also supports giving chemotherapy prior to immunotherapy and at doses 
slightly higher than the dose levels that begin to induce cytopenias12. In a clinical study of patients 
with metastatic breast cancer, low doses of  cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin enhanced the immune 
response to an allogeneic, HER2-positive, GM CSF-secreting breast-tum or vaccine in patients 
with breast cancer15. In the same study, higher doses of cyclophosphamide were shown to 
suppress immunity. Therefore, when given at an optimal dose (such as weekly lower doses rather 
than higher monthly dose), chemotherapy ma y enhance the immune response rather than 
suppress it.  
1.1.4 Immunomodulatory properties of taxanes: 
Taxanes may provide long-term immune benefits, have been shown to increase tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes, and have demonstrated a positive effect  on T-cell proliferation and natural killer 
mediated tumor-cell lysis in breast cancer tumors16,17. Paclitaxel may be a particularly strong 
immune stimulant, as it is able to both activa te CD8+ T cells and reduce immunosuppressive 
cells, such as regulatory T cells18. Docetaxel has been shown to increase CD8+ T-cell production 
RI,)1ȖDVWLPXODWRURIWXPRU-cell killin g), but docetaxel does not appear to inhibit the 
suppressor function of regulatory T cells19. In a preclinical model, lower-dose taxanes appeared 
to induce maturation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells into more mature dendritic cells 
UMCC 2017.077  
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 11 of 63 independently of TLR420. In patients with advanced breast ca ncer, treatment with paclitaxel or 
docetaxel was also asso ciated with enhanced natural killer-cell activity21. In addition, a study 
showed that the antitumor effects of paclitax el may be mediated by my eloid-derived suppressor 
cells22. Taxanes regulate many aspects of immune function, including lymphocyte recruitment 
and activation and production of immune-enhan cing cytokines, including IL-12, IFN γ, TNFα, and 
GMCSF, all of which may augment the antitumor activity of immunotherapies23. Tumor cell-
derived TGF β has been shown to inhibit paclitaxel-induced macrophage activation; therefore, 
depletion of TGF β may provide a mechanism for restoring the immunomodulatory properties of 
taxanes24. 
1.1.5 Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel): nab-Paclitaxel (ABRAXANE® for Injectable Suspension [Abraxis 
BioScience, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene Corporation, Summit, New Jersey, 
United States; hereafter referred to as “Celgene”], ABI-007) is a proprietary solvent-free, protein-
stabilized formulation of paclitaxel comprised of  paclitaxel in a noncrystalline amorphous state 
and human albumin with a mean particle size of  approximately 130 nanometers. nab-Paclitaxel 
has been developed to improve the therapeutic index of paclitaxel, also reducing the toxicities 
associated with Taxol and the CrEL and ethanol vehi cle.  This may be achieved in part by taking 
advantage of endogenous transport pathways to deliver  higher doses of paclitaxel to the tumor. 
Because nab-paclitaxel does not contain a solv ent vehicle, micellar entrapment observed with 
Taxol does not occur 25-27. nabPaclitaxel displays linear pharmacok inetic (PK) characteristics. The 
novel albumin-bound particle formulation of paclit axel in nab-paclitaxel conferred the ability to 
achieve a higher maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on every 3-weeks dosing: 300 mg/m2 for 
nab-paclitaxel (Study DM97-123) versus 175 mg/m2 for Taxol (Nyman, 2004)28. The use of 
albumin-bound paclitaxel also enables nab-paclitax el to be given in a shorter, more convenient 
infusion time of 30 - 40 minutes compared with 3 hours to 24 hours with Taxol.  Due to its distinct 
pharmacological and PK properties and therapeutic  index, nab-paclitaxel has been approved by 
regulatory authorities worldwide in over 40 countri es/regions as a new product, rather than as a 
generic formulation of Taxol. nab-Paclitaxel ma y be given without steroid and anti-histamine 
premedication, which is required for Taxol to prev ent solvent-related HSRs (Taxol US prescribing 
information). Cremophor EL has been shown to  leach plasticizers, specifically di(2-
ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), from polyvinyl chlo ride (PVC) bags and polyethylene-lined tubing 29-
34. Although no controlled epidemiologic toxicity studies have been conducted in humans exposed 
to DEHP, severe effects (e.g., carcinogenicit y, cardiopulmonary toxicity, hepatotoxicity, and 
nephrotoxicity) have been observed in experimental models.  The Taxol prescribing information 
instructs users to prepare, store,  and administer solutions in glass, polypropylene, or polyolefin 
containers; nonPVC-containing infusion sets (e.g., those with polyethylene lining) should be used (Taxol US prescribing information). By comp arison, standard tubing and intravenous (IV) bags 
may be used for the IV administration of nab-paclitaxel 
25,28. 
As of October 2016, nab-paclitaxel is appro ved under the trade name of ABRAXANE in 65 
countries worldwide for the treatment of pati ents with metastatic breast cancer. ABRAXANE is 
also approved in 54 countries worldwide for the first-line treatment of locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), in 57 countries for the first-line treatment of 
metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, and in Japan for treatment of advanced gastric cancer. 
1.1.6 Activity of Abraxane in platinum-refractory UC: 
The activity of Abraxane (ABI-007) against platinum-refractory advanced UC was recently 
described35. The multi-institutional phase II study eval uated the efficacy and tolerability of abraxane 
as a single agent in patients with  platinum-refractory metastatic  UC. Abraxane was given at 260 
mg/m2 IV q3weekly until progression to the 48 patie nts enrolled. Baseline ch aracteristics included 
40 being male; median age of 68 years; ECOG Perfor mance Status 0:1:2 was present in 15:24:8 
UMCC 2017.077

Page 12 of 63 patients respectively. A median of  5.5 cycles was administered per patient with 17/48 pts (35%) 
requiring dose reductions. Most frequent adverse events (AE) were alopecia (12%), fatigue (12%), 
pain (12%), neuropathy (9%) and nausea (4%). The most frequent grade > 3 AEs were pain (45%), 
hypertension (14%), fatigue (8%), joint stiffne ss (5%), neuropathy (4%) and weakness (4%). Forty 
patients are evaluable for response: 1 (2.5%) complete response (CR), 11 (28%) partial responses 
(PR), 9 (23%) stable disease (SD) and 20 (49%) pr ogressive disease. One patient was inevaluable 
for response, 7 patients are too early for evalua tion. Single agent abraxane was therefore well 
tolerated with a response rate (CR+PR) of 33% ( 12/36) and a clinical benefit rate (CR+PR+SD) of 
58% (21/36), representing one of the highest reported response rates to date in the second-line UC setting. A NCIC Clinical Trials Group (NCIC CT G) led intergroup trial with the Australian and 
New Zealand Urogenital and Prostate Cancer Trials Group (ANZUP) comparing abraxane to 
paclitaxel in platinum-refractory advanced urothelial cancer ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is ongoing. 
 
1.1.7 Taxane-based chemotherapy with immune-checkpoint inhibitors: 
Experience with nab-paclitaxel in combination with  checkpoint inhibitors are emerging, but early 
data suggest that nab-paclitaxel-based therapy c ould augment the antitumor activity of these 
agents. In a preliminary analysis of a Phase IB tria l of patients with various solid tumors, a cohort 
of 16 efficacy-evaluable patients with advanc ed NSCLC treated with the combination of 
atezolizumab (15 mg/kg q3w) plus nab-paclitaxel  (100 mg/m2 weekly) plus carboplatin achieved 
an ORR of 56% and a complete response rate of 25% 36,37. Two other trial arms of atezolizumab 
plus either paclitaxel/carboplatin (efficacy eval uable, n=8) or pemetrexed/carboplatin (efficacy 
evaluable, n=17) also demonstrated favorable ORRs of 50% and 76%, respectively, but no 
patients receiving the paclitaxel- or pemetrexed- containing regimens have achieved a complete 
response to date. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse event was neutropenia (35% in the 
nab-paclitaxel arm, 29% in the paclitaxel arm, and 25% in the pemetrexed arm). Initial analysis of 
a cohort of patients with triple-negative breas t cancer treated with atezolizumab (800 mg q2w) 
plus nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2 weekly for first 3 of 4 weeks) within the same Phase IB trial 
demonstrated a best ORR of 71% (42% confir med) in 24 patients evaluable for efficacy38. 
Patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer who received the atezolizumab plus nab-
paclitaxel regimen as first-line therapy derived t he greatest benefit (best ORR, 46% confirmed). A 
total of 32 patients with triple-negative breast ca ncer were evaluable for safety. Neutropenia and 
decreased neutrophil count were the most comm on grade 3/4 AE, occurring in 47% of patients 
receiving atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel. The investigators also found that expression of PDL1 
was mostly restricted to immune cells in excis ed tumors, but the level of expression did not 
appear to correlate with response. Based on the po sitive results of this Phase IB trial, the 
combination of atezolizumab and n ab-paclitaxel is being evaluated in  Phase III trials in triple 
negative breast cancer and NSCLC. 
Interim analysis from a triple negative breast cancer  study of a microtubule inhibitor eribulin in 
combination with pembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 drug,  was recently presented at the San Antonio 
Breast Cancer Symposium 201639. Study 218 is a Phase Ib/II clinical study which examined the 
activity and safety of eribulin in combination with pembrolizumab in 95 patients with metastatic 
triple-negative breast cancer prev iously treated with 0-2 lines of chemotherapy in the metastatic 
setting. The primary objective of the Phase Ib part was safety and tolerability, and the primary 
objective of the Phase II part was objective respon se rate (ORR). At the time of the interim 
analysis of 39 evaluable patients out of the 89 patients enrolled in the study as of July 2016, ORR 
was 33.3% (1 patient experienced a complete response and 12 patients experienced a partial 
response). In addition, the ORR was similar between PD-L1 positive and negative cohorts. 
Treatment with the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizum ab (MPDL3280A) plus nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) 
showed a confirmed objective response rate (ORR ) of 66.7% in patients with metastatic triple 
negative breast cancer (TNBC), according to data presented at the 2015 San Antonio Breast 
Cancer Symposium40. In the phase Ib study, atezolizum ab plus nab-paclitaxel was explored 
across several lines of treatment regardless of PD-L1 status for pa tients with metastatic TNBC. In 
the second-line setting, the confirmed ORR wa s 25% and in the third-line and beyond the ORR 
UMCC 2017.077  
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 13 of 63 was 28.6%. Across the full trial, the ORR was 41 .7%. In the ongoing study, 32 patients received 
concurrent treatment with nab-paclitaxel at 125 mg /m2 and atezolizumab at 800 mg. In the initial 
safety cohort of the study (n = 8), atezolizum ab was administered on days 1 and 15 along with 
nab-paclitaxel on days 1, 8, and 15 in a 28-day cycle. In a serial biopsy cohort, 24 patients 
received nab-paclitaxel on days 1 and 8 for the first cycle followed by concurrent treatment with 
both agents using the safety cohort schedule. In the serial biopsy arm, a pretreatment biopsy was 
taken > 7 days before the first cycle. Additional biopsies were obtained between days 10 and 15 
during the first cycle then again 4 weeks after t he first dose of atezolizumab. Responses were 
confirmed if seen on two or more sequential scans. The primary endpoint of the study was safety, 
with key secondary endpoints focused on ORR, dur ation of response, progression-free survival, 
and biomarker analyses. The median age of patients in the study was 55.5 years, and most had 
an ECOG PS of 0 (19%) or 1 (81%). The number of prior systemic ther apies received was 5, 
although a group of patients were enrolled in the frontline setting (n = 9). Prior to entering the 
study, 87% of patients had received a taxane. At the time of t he data cutoff, 24 patients with a 
minimum follow-up of > 3 months were ev aluable for efficacy. Across all groups, when 
considering unconfirmed responses, the ORR was 70.8%, which included a complete response 
rate of 4.2%. Additionally, the stable disease rate  was 20.8%, for an overall disease control rate 
of 91.6%. At the time of the analysis, 11 of 17 responses (65%) remained ongoing.  
  1.2 Rationale 
Given the dire unmet clinical need to improve outco mes for patients who are cisplatin ineligible as 
well as those who are platinum-refractory in advanced urothelial cancer, the preliminary evidence 
of robust activity of abraxane in advanced urot helial cancer, the proven activity of pembrolizumab 
in both platinum-refractory and cisplatin-ineligib le patients with advanced urothelial cancer, and 
the emerging data from ongoing studies showing ex cellent tolerance and promising combinatorial 
activity of the two agents when combined in other cancer types incl uding potential synergy 
between the two agents, we hypothesize that the addition of abraxane to pembrolizumab in 
advanced urothelial cancer would augment the anti-cancer immune response to 
pembrolizumab and result in gr eater clinical efficacy and benefit to patients from both 
agents in a synergistic manner . 
We therefore propose a single arm phase 2 study of abraxane in combination with 
pembrolizumab in cisplatin ineligible as well as platinum-refractory patients with advanced 
urothelial cancer (metastatic or locally advanced unresectable).  
Rationale for reduction in starting dose of abraxane: Experience in the first 17 subjects enrolled 
revealed: Grade ≥3 adverse events (AE) occurred in 15/17 pts including fatigue (n=5), peripheral 
neuropathy (n=3), anemia (n=3), and oral mucositis (n=3). Five pts discontinued treatment due to 
AEs, all attributed to abraxane. Hence, we believe  a dose reduction in starting dose of abraxane 
to 100 mg/m2/dose down from 125 mg/m2/dose is appropriate. 
1.3 Correlative Studies41  
PD-L1 expression is prevalent in many human tumors, and elevated PD-L1 expression on tumor 
cells is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with UBC 41, 42. Tumor tissue will be archived 
for future testing including PD-L1 status by IHC.  
In the IM vigor 210 trial of atezolizumab in ur othelial cancer, PD-L1 expression on immune cells 
infiltrating tumor tissue did correlate with resp onse. Twenty-six percent of patients whose tumor 
immune cells were highly positive by IHC resp onded whereas only 8% of patients whose tumor 
UMCC 2017.077  
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 14 of 63 immune cells were PDL1 negative had a response. While displaying an important trend, PD-L1 
expression is not an optimal discri minatory biomarker by itself, as  evidenced by the fact that 2% 
of patients in the PD-L1 negative group did have a complete response to atezolizumab. Data for 
pembrolizumab PD-L1 is similar5. 
We would like to correlate response with PD -L1 status in patients treated with abraxane and 
pembrolizumab. We plan to test for PD-L1 ex pression with the corresponding PD-L1 IHC 22C3 
pharmDx assay per the commercial assay specificat ions in the future after trial accrual is 
complete.

4.0 SUBJECT SCREENING AND REGISTRATION PROCEDURES 
After informed consent is obtained and PRIOR to the initiation of protocol therapy all patients 
satisfying the inclusion/exclusion criteria must have eligibility confirmed by the Oncology Clinical 
Trials Support Unit (OCTSU). The patient will not be considered registered and enrolled in the 
study until all information is confir med by the OCTSU Data Manager. 
A potential study subject who has been screened for the trial and who has signed the Informed 
Consent document will be assigned a Patient Study ID number and documented on a Screening 
and Enrollment Log. 
It is the responsibility of the principal investigator  to determine patient eligibility prior to submitting 
patient registration request to the OCTSU. The eligibility worksheet and all pertinent source 
documents will be maintained in the patient’s chart. 
Patients found to be ineligible for participati on after being consented will be considered screen 
failures and documented as such in the Screening and Enrollment Log.

Page 23 of 63 •     No dose delays for pembrolizumab are needed for hematologic changes. 
•     Doses that are held will be skipped, not made up later. 
•  With any grade 2 or higher non-hematologic toxicity deemed to be related to 
pembrolizumab, hold pembrolizumab and refer to section 5.2.1. If adverse event is not an 
event of interest and improves to grade 1 or better, pembrolizumab may be resumed. 
•  If non-hematologic toxicity does not improve to gr ade 1 or better in 12 weeks from prior dose, 
discontinue pembrolizumab. 
•  Infusion-Related Reaction: Pembrolizumab can cause severe or life-threatening infusion 
related reactions, including hypersensitivit y and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 6 
(0.2%) of 2799 patients receiving pembrolizumab. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of  
infusion-related reactions including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, 
hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For severe  (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) 
infusion-related reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue Pembrolizumab.

  5.3 Concomitant Medications/Treatments 
Systemic corticosteroids greater than the equi valent of 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent 
alternative steroid (except physiologic dose for adrenal replacement therapy) or other 
immunosuppressive agents (such as cyclos porine or methotrexate) and any other 
medications that could potentially impact the e fficacy or safety of the study as judged by 
the treating investigator are NOT permitted from time of registration to subjects 
completing protocol therapy unless clinically  indicated to manage adverse events or life 
threatening or serious conditions as det ermined by the treating investigator. 
Use caution when concomitantly administeri ng ABRAXANE with inhibitors or inducers of 
either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4. 
  5.4 Other Modalities or Procedures 
Pembrolizumab should be held (no specified time period, at discretion of treating 
investigator) for any surgery until subject is  judged to be stable to resume by treating

Page 31 of 63 investigator as adequate information does not  exist on its effects on wound healing. 
When resumed, same dose level will be maintained.  
Abraxane should be held (no specified time peri od, at discretion of treating investigator) 
for any surgery until subject is judged to be stable to resume by treating investigator. 
When resumed, same dose level will be maintained.  
Percutaneous procedures like imaging guided biopsies and central line placements do 
not require pembrolizumab or abraxane  to be necessarily held unless treating 
investigator judges it may increase risk of complications. 
  5.5 Duration of Therapy 
Treatment may continue until one of the following criteria apply: 
• Disease progression by RECIST1.1 as defined in Section 7.1.4. Subject may 
be continued on same regimen beyond one objective progression by 
RECIST 1.1 if clinically stable at t he discretion of treating investigator and 
with the permission of the principal investigator. 
• Inter-current illness that prevents fu rther administration of treatment 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
• Patient voluntarily withdraws from treatment  
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator 
  5.6 Off Treatment Criteria  
Patients will be removed from pr otocol therapy when any of t he criteria listed in Section 
5.5 apply. Document in the source the reason for ending protocol therapy and the date the patient was removed from treatment. A ll patients who discontinue treatment should 
comply with protocol specific follow-up pr ocedures as outlined in Section 5.7 and in 
section 6.0. The only exception to this requi rement is when a subject withdraws consent 
for all study procedures or loses the ability to cons ent freely (Section 5.8). 
  5.7 Duration of Follow-Up 
Patients will be followed for up to 24 months after removal from treatment or until death, 
whichever occurs first. Patients removed fr om treatment for unacceptable adverse events 
will be followed with a phone call or clinic visit until resolution or stabilization of the 
adverse events.  
  5.8 Off Study Criteria 
Patients can be taken off study at any time at their own request, or they may be 
withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral or administrative 
reasons. The reason(s) for discontinuation from study  will be documented and may 
include: 
  5.8.1 Patient withdraws consent (termina tion of treatment and follow-up); 
5.8.2  Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or 
involuntary incarceration for treatment; 
  5.8.3 Patient is unable to comply with protocol requirements; 
5.8.4 Treating physician determines continuation on the study would not be in the patient’s best interest;

An Optional Tumor Biopsy would be performed, if subject has been consented to it, at progression. 
7.0 MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT 
  7.1 Antitumor Effect- Solid Tumors  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by the Response Evaluat ion Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
Committee [ JNCI 92(3):205-216, 2000]. Changes in only the largest diameter  
(unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST v1.1 criteria. 
  7.1.1 Definitions 
Evaluable for toxicity. All patients will be ev aluable for toxicity from the time of 
their first treatment with study drug. 
Response Evaluable Population for prim ary endpoint: Only those patients who 
have had their disease re-evaluated by im aging after 2 cycles of therapy OR 
exhibit objective or unequivocal clinical disease progression prior to the end of 
cycle 2 will be considered evaluable for the primary endpoint. These patients will 
have their response classified accordin g to the definitions stated below. 
  7.1.2 Disease Parameters 
Measurable disease. Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dim ension (longest diameter in the plane of 
measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 
• 10mm by CT scan (irrespective of scanner type) for studies with a slice 
thickness of <5mm or twice the slice thickness or MRI 
   • 10mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be 
UMCC 2017.077  
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 35 of 63          accurately measured with calipers shou ld be recorded as non-measurable)          
 • 20mm by chest X-ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung) 
                           
All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of                             
centimeters). 
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, assessed by CT  scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be 
no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be 
measured and followed. 
Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or 
might not be considered measurable, and the conditions under which such 
lesions should be considered may be defi ned in the protocol when appropriate. 
Non-measurable disease. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions (longest diameter <20 mm with conventional techniques or <10 mm using 
CT scan), are considered non-me asurable disease. Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by 
CT or MRI), and cystic lesions are all non-measurable. 
Target lesions. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ 
and 5 lesions in total should be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their 
size (lesions with the longest diameter),  be representative of all involved organ, 
but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements. 
Lymph nodes merit special mention since t hey are normal anatomical structures 
which may be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathological 
nodes which are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions 
must meet the criterion of a short axis of  >15mm by CT scan. Only the short axis 
of these nodes will contribute to the base line sum. The short axis of the node is 
the diameter normally used by radiologists to judge if a node is involved by solid 
tumor. Nodal size is normally reported as two dimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI 
the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal or coronal). The smaller of these 
measures is the short axis. For example, an abdominal node which is reported 
as being 20mm x 30mm has a short axis of 20mm and qualifies as a malignant, 
measurable node. In this example, 20mm should be recorded as the node 
measurement. All other pathological nodes (t hose with short axis >10mm but <15 
mm) should be considered non-target le sions. Nodes that have a short axis 
<10mm are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal 
lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum 
diameters. If lymph nodes are to be incl uded in the sum, then as noted above, 
only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be 
used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. 
Non-target lesions. All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological 
lymph nodes should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements ar e not required and these lesions should 
UMCC 2017.077  
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 36 of 63 be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ 
(more details to follow). In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-target 
lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form (e.g. 
‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’). 
  7.1.3 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if 
clinically assessed. All baseline evaluat ions should be performed as close as 
possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the 
beginning of the treatment. 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. 
Imaging based evaluation should always be done rather than clinical examination 
unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by 
clinical exam. 
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions w ill only be considered measurable when they 
are superficial and >10mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin 
nodules). For the case of skin lesions,  documentation by color photography 
including a ruler to estimate the size of  the lesion is suggested. As noted above, 
when lesions can be evaluated by both clinical exam and imaging, imaging 
evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may also be 
reviewed at the end of the study. 
Chest X-ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particularly when 
progression is an important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X-ray, 
particularly in identifying new lesions. However, lesions on chest X-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated 
lung. 
CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure 
lesions selected for response assessment. This guideline has defined 
measurability of lesions on CT scan ba sed on the assumption that CT slice 
thickness is 5mm or less. When CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurabl e lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans). 
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not 
be used as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be 
reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because 
they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique 
and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course  of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI 
is advised. If there is concern about radi ation exposure at CT, MRI may be used 
instead of CT in selected instances. 
Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised. However, they can be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in 
trials where recurrence following complete response or surgical resection is an 
endpoint. 
UMCC 2017.077  
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 37 of 63 Tumor markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor 
response. If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, however, they 
must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete response. Because 
tumor markers are disease specific, instructions for their measurement should be 
incorporated into protocols on a disease specific basis. Specific guidelines for 
both CA-125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer ) and PSA response (in 
recurrent prostate cancer), have been p ublished. In addition, the Gynecologic 
Cancer Intergroup has developed CA125 progression criteria which are to be integrated with objective tumor assessment for use in first-line trials in ovarian 
cancer. 
Cytology, Histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR 
and CR in rare cases if required by protocol (for example, residual lesions in 
tumor types such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can 
remain). When effusions are known to be  a potential adverse effect of treatment 
(e.g. with certain taxane compounds or angiogenesis inhibitors), the cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment can be considered if t he measurable tumor has met criteria for 
response or stable disease in order to differentiate between response (or stable 
disease) and progressive disease. 
  7.1.4 Response Criteria 
7.1.4.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions, 
determined by two separate observations conducted not less than 4 weeks apart. There can be no appearance of new lesions. 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline 
sum LD. There can be no appearance of new lesions. 
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD 
of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions. 
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum 
LD since the treatment started. 
7.1.4.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level. 
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD): Persistence of one or more 
non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the 
normal limits. 
Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions 
and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. 
UMCC 2017.077  
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 38 of 63 7.1.4.3 Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
The best overall response is the best  response recorded from the start of 
the treatment until disease progressi on/recurrence (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will depend 
on the achievement of both measur ement and confirmation criteria.

Note: Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of 
disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration” . Every effort should be made to 
document the objective progression even after discontinuation of 
treatment. 
Note: If subjects respond to treatment and are able to have their disease 
resected, the patient’s response will be assessed prior to the surgery. 
  7.1.5 Duration of Response 
Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever  is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive  disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started). 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented. 
Duration of stable disease: Stable diseas e is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progres sion are met, taking as reference the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
UMCC 2017.077  
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 39 of 63   7.1.6 Progression-Free Survival 
Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of 
treatment to time of progression or death. 
  7.2 Safety/Tolerability  
Analyses will be performed for all patients hav ing received at least one dose of study 
drug. The study will use the CTCAE version 4.0 for reporting of n on-hematologic adverse 
events (http://ctep.cancer.gov/r eporting/ctc.html) and modified criteria for hematologic 
adverse events. 
8.0 ADVERSE EVENTS 
For the most recent safety update, please refer to the current package inserts for nab-paclitaxel 
and pembrolizumab. 
Overdose 
Overdose, as defined for this protocol, refers to ABRAXANE®, combination products and 
comparator dosing only.   
On a per dose basis, an overdose is defined as  10% over the protocol-specified dose of 
Abraxane® assigned to a given patient, regardless of any  associated adverse events or sequelae. 
IV 
On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as anything more frequent than the 
protocol required schedule or frequency.   
On an infusion rate basis, an overdose is defined  as any rate faster than the protocol-specified 
rate. For nab-paclitaxel, an infusion completed in less than 25 minutes may increase Cmax by 
approximately 20%, therefore a nab-paclitaxel infusion completed in less than 25 minutes 
will meet the infusion rate criterion for an overdose.  
Complete data about drug administration, including any overdose, regardless of whether the 
overdose was accidental or intentional, should  be reported in the case report form.    
Pregnancies 
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or 
disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on IP, or within 60 days are 
considered immediately reportable events.  IP is  to be discontinued immediately. The pregnancy, 
suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy te st must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety 
immediately by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the Pregnancy Initial Report Form, 
or approved equivalent form. The female subject may be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist 
(not necessarily one with reproductive toxicity  experience) or another appropriate healthcare 
professional for further evaluation. 
The principal investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and 
must notify Celgene Drug Safety immediately about  the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal 
or abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow-up Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  
UMCC 2017.077  
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 40 of 63 If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (e .g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion), the 
principal investigator should report the abnor mal outcome as an AE.  If the abnormal outcome 
meets any of the serious crit eria, it must be reported as  an SAE to Celgene Drug Safety 
immediately by facsimile, or other appropriate  method, within 24 hours of the principal 
investigator’s knowledge of the event using t he SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form. 
All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported, without regard to 
causality, as SAEs. In addition, any infant death after 28 days that the Inve stigator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safety 
immediately by facsimile, or other appropriate  method, within 24 hours of the principal 
investigator’s knowledge of the event using t he SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form. 
  8.1 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial and is 
done to ensure the safety of subjects enroll ed in the studies as well as those who will 
enroll in future studies usin g similar agents. Data on adverse events will be collected 
from the time of the initial study treatment administration or intervention through 30 days 
after the last dose of study treatment or study intervention. Any serious adverse event 
that occurs more than 30 days after the last study treatment or intervention and is 
considered related to the study treatment or intervention must also be reported. Serious 
Adverse Events (SAEs) will cont inue to be followed until: 
• Resolution or the symptoms or signs that  constitute the serious adverse event 
return to baseline; 
• There is satisfactory explanation other than the study treatment or intervention for   
the changes observed; or  
• Death. 
The investigator is responsible for the dete ction, documentation,  grading and assignment 
of attribution of events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE. The definitions 
of AEs and SAEs are given below. It is the responsibility of t he principal investigator to 
ensure that all staff involved in the trial is familiar with the content  of this section. 
Any medical condition or laboratory abnorma lity with an onset date before initial study 
treatment administration or intervention is considered to be pre-existing in nature. Any known pre-existing conditions that are on going at time of study entry should be 
considered medical history. 
All events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE, as defined in Section 8.2, 
occurring from the initial study treatment adm inistration or intervention through 30 days 
following the last dose of the study treatm ent or study intervention must be recorded as 
an adverse event in the pati ent’s source documents and on the CRF regardless of 
frequency, severity (grade) or assessed re lationship to the study treatment or 
intervention.  
In addition to new events, any increase in the fr equency or severity (i.e., toxicity grade) of 
a pre-existing condition that occurs after the patient begins study treatment or 
intervention is also considered an adverse event. 
UMCC 2017.077  
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 41 of 63   8.2 Definitions  
  8.2.1 Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward m edical occurrence in a patient receiving 
study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of an experimental intervention, whether  or not related to the intervention.  
• Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive (i.e., surgical) procedures 
will not be reported as adverse events. However, the medical condition for 
which the procedure was performed must be reported if it meets the 
definition of an adverse event unless it is a pre-existing (prior to protocol 
treatment) condition. 
• Abnormal laboratory values or test resu lts constitute adverse events if they 
induce clinical signs or symptoms or require therapy. They are to be captured 
under the signs, symptoms or di agnoses associated with them. 
  8.2.2 Serious Adverse Event 
An adverse event is considered “serious ” if, in the view of the principal 
investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
o Death 
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease should be 
reported as event (SAE) itself. 
o A life-threatening adverse event 
An adverse even is consider ed ‘life-threatening’ if, in the view of either the 
investigator, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an adverse ev ent that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
o Inpatient hospitalization or prolongati on of existing hospitalization for > 24 
hours. 
o A persistent or significant incapacity or  substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
o Important medical event 
Any event that may not result in deat h, be life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of  the outcomes listed in this definition 
of “Serious Adverse Event”. Exampl es of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; convulsions t hat do not result in inpati ent hospitalization or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
UMCC 2017.077  
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 42 of 63 Previously planned (prior to signing the informed consent form) surgeries should 
not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condition has worsened 
during the course of the study. Preplan ned hospitalizations or procedures for 
preexisting conditions that are already recorded in the patient’s medical history at the time of study enrollment should not be considered SAEs. Hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitalization without a precipitating clinical AE (for example, for the administration of study therapy or other protocol-required procedure) should 
not be considered SAEs. However, if t he preexisting condition worsened during 
the course of the study, it should be reported as an SAE. 
  8.2.3 Expected Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is considered “expected” if: 
• For approved and marketed drugs or de vices, those adverse events are 
described in the approved Package Insert (Label).  
• For investigational new drugs or devices, those adverse events are 
described in the FDA Investigator’s Brochure.  
• In clinical research studies, informat ion on expected adverse events is also 
summarized in the protocol and in the consent document.  See section 9.1 for the list of expected adverse events related to the drug under 
study. 
  8.2.4 Unexpected Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is considered “une xpected” if it is not described in the 
Package Insert, Investigator’s Brochure, in published medical literature, in the 
protocol, or in the informed consent document.  
  8.3 Adverse Event Characteristics  
  8.3.1 CTCAE Term 
(AE description) and grade: The descript ions and grading scales found in the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adve rse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be 
utilized for AE reporting. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be down 
loaded from the CTEP web si te. (http://ctep.cancer.gov) 
  8.3.2 Attribution of the AE 
The principal investigator or co-investi gator is responsible for assignment of 
attribution. 
Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study [treatment/intervention]. 
Probable – The AE is likely related to the study [treatment/intervention]. 
Possible – The AE may be related to the study [treatment/intervention]. 
Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study [treatment/intervention]. 
Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study [treatment/intervention]. 
  8.4 Serious Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines  
All serious adverse events (SAEs) and unant icipated problems (UPs ), regardless of 
causality to study drug, will be reported to t he principal investigator  within 2 business 
days of study team’s knowledge of any event meeting the criteria and definition of a 
UMCC 2017.077  
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 43 of 63 serious adverse event, regardless of attribution, occurring during the study or within 30 
days of the last administration of the study related treatment. 
The investigator must report all events meet ing the criteria and definition of a serious 
adverse events that are unex pected and possibly related (definite, probable or possible) 
to study treatment to the local IRB with in 7 days of study team’s knowledge.  
All Serious Adverse Events that are unexpect ed and possibly related (definite, probable 
or possible) to study treatment will be reported to the IRB using the MEDWATCH 3500A form.

  8.5 Expedited Reporting by Investigator to Celgene  
Serious adverse events (SAE) are defined above.   The investigator must inform Celgene 
in writing using a Celgene SAE form or MEDWATCH 3500A form of any SAE within 24 
hours of being aware of the event.  The wri tten report must be completed and supplied 
to Celgene by facsimile within 24 hours . The initial report must be as complete as 
possible, including an assessment of the causal relationship between the event and the 
investigational product(s).  Information not available at the time of the initial report (e.g., 
an end date for the adverse event or laboratory  values received after the report) must be 
documented on a follow-up report.  A final re port to document resolution of the SAE is 
required.  The Celgene tracking number (AX- BLD-12813- PI-Alva) and the institutional 
protocol number should be included on SAE r eports (or on the fax cover letter) sent to 
Celgene.  A copy of the fax transmission confirmation of the SAE report to Celgene 
should be attached to the SAE and reta ined with the pat ient records. 
For the purpose of regulatory reporting, Celgene Drug Safety will determine the 
expectedness of events of being related to ABRAXANE® based on the Investigator 
Brochure.  In the United States, all susp ected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(SUSARs) will be reported in an expedited m anner in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32. 
Report of Adverse Events to the Institutional Review Board 
The principal Investigator is required to not ify his/her Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
of a serious adverse event accord ing to institutional policy.   
Investigator Reporting to the FDA 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) that are unlisted/unexpected, and at least possibly 
associated to the drug, and that have not previously been reported in the 
Investigators brochure, or reference safe ty information document should be reported 
promptly to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by telephone or by fax.  Fatal or life threatening SAEs that meet the criteria for reporting to the FDA must be reported to 
the FDA within 7 calendar days after awareness of the event.  All other SAEs that meet 
UMCC 2017.077  
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 44 of 63 the criteria for reporting to the FDA must be reported to the FDA within 15 calendar 
days after awareness of the event.  A clear  description of the suspected reaction 
should be provided along with an assessment as to whether the event is drug or 
disease related.  
Adverse event updates/IND safety reports 
Celgene shall notify the Investigator via an IND Safety Report of the following 
information: 
• Any AE suspected of being related to the us e of drug in this study or in other 
studies that is both serious and unexpected. 
• Any finding from tests in laboratory animals  that suggests a significant risk for 
human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity. 
The Investigator shall notify his/her IR B/EC promptly of these new serious and 
unexpected AE(s) or signific ant risks to subjects. 
The Investigator must keep copies of all pertinent safety information on file, including 
correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/EC. 
8.6       Routine Reporting  
All other adverse events- such as those that are expected, or are unlikely or definitely not 
related to the study participation- are to be reported annually as part of regular data submission. 
  8.7 Reporting of Unanticipated Problems  
There are types of incidents, experiences and outcomes that occur during the conduct of 
human subjects research that represent unanticipated problems but are not considered 
adverse events. For example, some unanticipat ed problems involve social or economic 
harm instead of the physical or psychologica l harm associated with adverse events. In 
other cases, unanticipated problems place subjec ts or others at increased risk of harm, 
but no harm occurs . 
Upon becoming aware of any incident, experienc e, or outcome (not related to an adverse 
event) that may represent an unanticipated problem, the investigator should assess 
whether the incident, experience, or outcome represents an unanticipated problem. The incident, experience or outcomes is considered unanticipated if it meets all of the 
following criteria: 
1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency); 
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research; and 3. Suggests that the research  places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
than was previously kn own or recognized. 
If the investigator determines that the incident, experience, or outcome represents an 
unanticipated problem, the investigator must repor t it to the IRB within 7 calendar days of 
the study team becoming aware of the problem.

9.0 DRUG INFORMATION 
9.1 nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®) - Investigational  
Overview nab-Paclitaxel (ABRAXANE® for Injectable Suspension [Abraxis BioScience, LLC, a 
wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene Corporat ion, Summit, New Jersey, United States; hereafter 
referred to as “Celgene”], ABI-007) is a proprietar y solvent-free, protein-st abilized formulation of 
paclitaxel comprised of paclitaxel in a noncry stalline amorphous state and human albumin with a 
UMCC 2017.077  
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 51 of 63 mean particle size of approximately 130 nanom eters. nab-Paclitaxel has been developed to 
improve the therapeutic index of paclitaxel, also reducing the toxicities associated with Taxol and 
the CrEL and ethanol vehicle.  This may be achieved in part by taking advantage of endogenous 
transport pathways to deliver higher doses of pac litaxel to the tumor. Because nab-paclitaxel 
does not contain a solvent vehicle, micellar entrapment observed with Taxol does not occur 25-27. 
nabPaclitaxel displays linear pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics. The novel albumin-bound 
particle formulation of paclitaxel in nab-paclitax el conferred the ability to achieve a higher 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on every 3-weeks dosing: 300 mg/m2 for nab-paclitaxel 
(Study DM97-123) versus 175 mg/m2 for Taxol 28. The use of albumin-bound paclitaxel also 
enables nab-paclitaxel to be given in a shorter, more convenient infusion time of 30 - 40 minutes 
compared with 3 hours to 24 hours with Taxol.   Due to its distinct pharmacological and PK 
properties and therapeutic index, nab-paclitaxel has been approved by regulatory authorities 
worldwide in over 40 countries/regions as a new product, rather than as a generic formulation of 
Taxol.   nab-Paclitaxel may be given without st eroid and anti-histamine premedication, which is 
required for Taxol to prevent solvent-related HSRs (Taxol US prescribing information). 
Cremophor EL has been shown to leach plastici zers, specifically di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate 
(DEHP), from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags and polyethylene-lined tubing 29-34.  Although no 
controlled epidemiologic toxicity studies have been conducted in humans exposed to DEHP, severe effects (e.g., carcinogenicity, cardiopulm onary toxicity, hepatotoxic ity, and nephrotoxicity) 
have been observed in experimental models.  The Taxol prescribing informat ion instructs users to 
prepare, store, and administer solutions in gl ass, polypropylene, or polyolefin containers; 
nonPVC-containing infusion sets (e.g., those with  polyethylene lining) should be used (Taxol US 
prescribing information).  By comparison, standard tubing and intravenous (IV) bags may be used 
for the IV administration of nab-paclitaxel 
25,28. 
As of October 2016, nab-paclitaxel is appro ved under the trade name of ABRAXANE in 65 
countries worldwide for the treatment of pati ents with metastatic breast cancer. ABRAXANE is 
also approved in 54 countries worldwide for the first-line treatment of locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), in 57 countries for the first-line treatment of 
metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, and in Japan for treatment of advanced gastric 
cancer. 
Indications and Usage: 
In the United States, ABRAXANE® for Injectable Suspension (paclitaxel protein-bound particles 
for injectable suspension) (albumin bound) is i ndicated for the treatment of metastatic breast 
cancer after failure of combination chemotherapy  for metastatic disease or relapse within 6 
months of adjuvant chemotherapy.  Prior therapy should have included an anthracycline unless 
clinically contraindicated. 
It is also indicated for the first-line treatment of  locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC (non-small 
cell lung cancer), in combination with carboplatin, in patients who are not candidates for curative 
surgery or radiation therapy, and is indicated for t he first-line treatment of patients with metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, in  combination with gemcitabine. 
Other names for the drug: Abraxane (ABI-007 
ABRAXANE® Description 
ABRAXANE® for Injectable Suspen sion (paclitaxel protein-b ound particles for injectable 
suspension) (albumin-bound) is paclitaxel formulated as albumin-bound nanoparticles with a 
mean particle size of approximately 130 nanometers.  Paclitaxel exists in the particles in a non-
crystalline, amorphous state.  ABRAXANE® is suppl ied as a white to yellow, sterile, lyophilized 
powder for reconstitution with 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP prior to intravenous infusion.

Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism 
Absorption 
The pharmacokinetics of total pac litaxel following 30 and 180-min ute infusions of ABRAXANE® at 
dose levels of 80 to 375 mg/m2 were determined in cl inical studies. Dose levels of mg/m2 refer to 
mg of paclitaxel in ABRAXANE®.  Following intravenous administration of ABRAXANE®, 
paclitaxel plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic manner, the initial rapid decline 
representing distribution to the peripheral compartment and the slower second phase 
representing drug elimination. 
The drug exposure (AUCs) was dose proportional over 80 to 300 mg/m2 and the 
pharmacokinetics of paclit axel for ABRAXANE® were independent of the duration of intravenous 
administration.  The pharmacokinetic data of 260 mg/m2 ABRAXANE® administered over a 
30minute infusion was compared to the pharmacokine tics of 175 mg/m2 paclitaxel injection over 
a 3-hour infusion. Clearance was larger (43%) and the volume of distribution was higher (53%) 
for ABRAXANE® than for paclitaxel injection. There were no differences in terminal half-lives. 
Pharmacokinetic Parameters 
Distribution 
Following ABRAXANE® administration to patients with solid tumors, paclitaxel is evenly 
distributed into blood cells and plasma and is high ly bound to plasma proteins (94%). In a within 
patient comparison study, the fraction of unbound paclitaxel in plasma was 
significantly higher with ABRAXANE® (6.2%) than with solvent-based paclitaxel (2.3%). This 
contributes to significantly higher exposure to unbound paclitaxel with ABRAXANE® compared 
with solvent-based paclitaxel, when the total exposur e is comparable. In vitro studies of binding to 
human serum proteins, using paclitaxel concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 50 μg/mL, indicated 
that the presence of cimetidine, ranitidine, dexamethasone, or diphenhydramine did not affect 
protein binding of paclitaxel. The total volume of  distribution is approximately 1741 L; the large 
volume of distribution indicates extensive extr avascular distribution and/or tissue binding of 
paclitaxel. 
Metabolism  
In vitro studies with human liver microsomes and tissue slices showed that paclitaxel was  
metabolized primarily to 6 α-hydroxypaclitaxel by CYP2C8; and to two minor metabolites, 3’-p-
hydroxypaclitaxel and 6 α, 3’-p-dihydroxypaclitaxel by CYP3A4. In vitro, the metabolism of 
paclitaxel to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel was inhibited by a numb er of agents (ketoconazole, verapamil, 
diazepam, quinidine, dexamethasone, cyclosporin, t eniposide, etoposide, and vincristine), but the 
concentrations used exceeded those found in vivo following normal therapeutic doses. 
Testosterone, 17 α-ethinyl estradiol, retinoic acid, and querce tin, a specific inhibitor of CYP2C8, 
also inhibited the formation of 6 α-hydroxypaclitaxel in vitro. The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel 
may also be altered in vivo as a result of in teractions with compounds that are substrates, 
inducers, or inhibitors of CYP2C8 and/or CYP3A4. 
Elimination 
At the clinical dose range of 80 to 300 mg/m2, t he mean total clearance of paclitaxel ranges from 
13 to 30 L/h/m2, and the mean terminal half-life ranges from 13 to 27 hours.  After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg/m2 doses of ABRAXANE®, the mean values for cumulative urinary recovery 
of unchanged drug (4%) indicated extensive non -renal clearance. Less than 1% of the total 
administered dose was excreted in urine as the metabolites 6 α-hydroxypaclitaxel and 3’-p-
hydropaclitaxel. Fecal excretion was approxim ately 20% of the total dose administered.

Pharmacokinetics in Hepatic Impairment 
The effect of hepatic impairment  on the pharmacokinetics of pa clitaxel following ABRAXANE® 
administration was studied in patients with advanc ed solid tumors. The results showed that mild 
hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1 to <1.5 x ULN, AST <10 x ULN, n=8) had no clinically 
important effect on pharmacokineti cs of paclitaxel. Patients with mo derate (total bilirubin >1.5 to 
<3 x ULN, AST <10 x ULN, n=7) or severe (tot al bilirubin >3 to <5 x ULN, n=5) hepatic 
impairment had a 22% to 26% decrease in the maximum elimination rate of paclitaxel and 
approximately 20% increase in mean paclitaxel A UC compared with patients with normal hepatic 
function (total bilirubin < ULN, AST < ULN, n=130)   
 
Elimination of paclitaxel shows an inverse correlation with total bilirubin and a positive correlation 
with serum albumin.  Pharmacokinetic/pharmac odynamics modeling indicates that there is no 
correlation between hepatic function (as indicated by the baseline albumin or total bilirubin level) 
and neutropenia after adjusting for ABRAXANE® exposure. Pharmacokinetic data are not 
available for patients with total bilirubin >5 x UL N or for patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma 
of the pancreas. 
Pharmacokinetics in Renal Impairment 
The effect of pre-existing mild (creatinine cl earance >60 to <90 mL/min, n=61) or moderate 
(creatinine clearance >30 to <60 mL/min, n=23 ) renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of 
paclitaxel following ABRAXANE® administration wa s studied in patients with advanced solid 
tumors. Mild to moderate renal impairment had no clinically important effect on the maximum 
elimination rate and systemic expo sure (AUC and Cmax) of paclitaxel. 
Other Intrinsic Factors 
Population pharmacokinetic analys es for ABRAXANE® show that b ody weight (40 to 143 kg), 
body surface area (1.3 to 2.4 m2), gender, race (Asian vs. White), age (24 to 85 years) and type 
of solid tumors do not have a clinically importa nt effect on the maximum elimination rate and 
systemic exposure (AUC and Cmax) of paclitaxel. 
Pharmacokinetic Interactions between ABRAXANE® and Carboplatin 
Administration of carboplatin immediately a fter the completion of the ABRAXANE® infusion to 
patients with NSCLC did not cause clinically meaningful changes in paclitaxel exposure. The observed mean AUCinf of free carboplatin was appro ximately 23% higher than the targeted value 
(6 min*mg/mL), but its mean half-life and clearance were consistent with those reported in the absence of paclitaxel. 
Description 
Each single-use vial contains 100 mg of paclit axel and approximately 900 mg of human albumin. 
Each milliliter (mL) of reconstituted suspension contains 5 mg paclitaxel.  
Classification - type of agent: Antineoplastic Agent 
Mode of action: 
Paclitaxel protein-bound, an albumin-bound form of paclitaxel (a natural product obtained from 
Taxus media), works as an anti-microtubule age nt by promoting microtubule assembly from 
tubulin dimers and stabilizing microtubules. Stab ilizing microtubules prevents depolymerization 
and causes an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubules which is 
necessary for important interphase and mitotic f unctions in the cell. Paclitaxel causes the 
formation of abnormal bundles of microtubules in many phases of the cell cycle and multiple 
asters of microtubules during mitosis

Page 54 of 63 Pharmacokinetics: nab-Paclitaxel displays linear pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics. 
Hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion are likely routes of paclitaxel elimination in 
humans. 
Patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubi n > 1 to <1.5 x Upper limit of normal [ULN]) 
have no clinically important changes in pharmacoki netics (PK) of paclitaxel while patients with 
moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to <3 x ULN) or severe (total bilirubin >3  to <5 x ULN) hepatic 
impairment have a 22% to 26% decrease in the maximum elimination rate of paclitaxel and 
approximately 20% increase in mean paclitaxel A UC compared with patients with normal hepatic 
function. Mild to moderate renal impairment (c reatinine clearance >30 and < 90 mL/min) has no 
clinically important effect on the maximum e limination rate and systemic exposure (AUC and 
Cmax) of paclitaxel.

Drug Interactions 
The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalyzed by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. Pharmacokinetic drug-drug 
interactions between nab-paclitaxel and inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 have not 
been evaluated in humans. 
Storage and stability 
Unopened vials of nab-paclitaxel are stable until the date indicated on the package when stored 
in the original cartons at United States P harmacopeia (USP) Controlled Room Temperature 
(20°C to 25°C, excursions permitted between 15° to 30°C), or as specified on the vial label and 
as per the country requirements. 
Preparation and Dispensing 
nab-Paclitaxel is supplied as a sterile lyophilized powd er for reconstitution before use. Each mL of 
the reconstituted formulation will co ntain 5 mg/mL paclitaxel. Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject 
20 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection to a vial of nab-paclitaxel. Direct 
the solution flow onto the inside wall of the vial and take at least 1 minute for the introduction. Do 
not inject the solution directly onto the lyophilisate as this will result in foaming. Once the addition 
is complete, allow the vial to stand for a minimum of 5 minutes to ensure proper wetting of the 
solid. Then, gently swirl and/or invert the vial slowly for at least 2 minutes until complete 
dissolution of any lyophilisate occu rs. Avoid the generation of foam. 
Calculate the exact total dosing volume of 5 mg/mL suspension required for the patient and 
slowly withdraw the dosing volume of the reconstituted nab-paclitaxel suspension from the vial(s) 
into a syringe. The exact total dosing volume of  5 mg/mL suspension required for the patient is 
calculated using the following formula: 
Dosing volume (mL) = Total dose (mg) / 5 (mg/mL) 
Administration 
Inject the appropriate amount of reconstituted nab-paclitaxel into an empty, sterile, intravenous 
bag (PVC or non-PVC type IV bag). The use of sp ecialized DEHP-free solution containers or 
administration sets is not necessary to prepare or administer nab-paclitaxel infusions. The use of 
medical devices containing silicone oil as a lubr icant (i.e., syringes and IV bags) to reconstitute 
and administer nab -paclitaxel may result in the formati on of proteinaceous strands. Visually 
inspect the reconstituted nab-paclitaxel suspension in the IV bag prior to administration. If strands 
are observed, administer reconstituted nab -paclitaxel suspension through a 15 micron filter. Do 
not use a filter with a pore size less than  15 microns. A similar phenomenon has also been 
UMCC 2017.077  
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 56 of 63 observed with other protein-containing in jectable products. Filtration of the nab-paclitaxel 
suspension using a 15 micron filter removes t he proteinaceous strands and does not change the 
physical or chemical properties of nab-paclitaxel suspension. Based on data from clinical trials 
and post-marketing surveillance, t here is no indication of an increased risk of embolic events 
should these strands be administered to patients. Refer to local product label or study notebook, 
as applicable, for complete directions regarding the use of a filter. 
Parenteral drug products should be inspected vi sually for particulate matter and discoloration 
before administration whenever the solution and container permit. The reconstituted sample 
should be milky and homogenous without visible particulates. If particulates or settling are visible, 
the vial should be gently inverted again to ensure complete resuspension prior to use. 
Following administration of nab-paclitaxel, the intravenous line should be flushed with sodium 
chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure administration of the complete dose, 
according to local practice. 
Dose Reduction / Discontinuation Recommendations 
Dose reductions or discontinuation may be needed based on severe hematologic, neurologic, 
cutaneous, or gastrointestinal toxicities.  Please refer to the Prescribing Information which can be 
found in Section 2.5.

9.2 Pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) – Standard of Care 
Other names for the drug: Keytruda® 
Please refer to the package insert for pembrolizumab for details of storage, administration 
etc. 
Availability/ordering 
Commercially available. Standard of care. 
10.0 CORRELATIVES/SPECIAL STUDIES 
We will archive patient tumor, plasma and serum samples for future unspecified testing including 
but not limited to PD-L1 and anti-drug antibody te sting. Submission of samples for correlative 
studies is expected of all subjects at baseline and optional tumor biopsy will be performed for 
those who consent to it. 
  10.1 Sample Collection Guidelines  
Tumor Tissue 
An archived tissue block must be identified to s ubmit unstained slides prior to registration. 
Unstained slides from an archived formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue block are to be submitted for each subject from prior cyst ectomy or biopsy of metastatic lesion 
(estimated tumor content >30% of nucleated cells  in specimen) to create a tissue archive 
of these patients. 
Representative tumor specimens in paraffin blocks (preferred) or at least 15 unstained 
slides, with an associated pathology report, must be identified to submit for determination 
of sufficient viable tumor content prior to  study enrollment. Tumor specimens will be 
evaluated for PD-L1 expression at a future time when funding is secured. 
Blood Collection for Banking 
Whole blood samples (20 mL)  
UMCC 2017.077  
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 58 of 63 Serum samples (5-10 mL)  
Serum processing: Collect whole blood in a co vered test tube. If commercially available 
tubes are to be used, the researcher should use the red topped tubes. These are 
available from Becton Dickinson (BD). BD’s trade name for the blood handling tubes is 
Vacutainer. After collection of the whole blood,  allow the blood to clot by leaving it 
undisturbed at room temperature. This usually  takes 15-30 minutes. Remove the clot by 
centrifuging at 1,000-2,000 x g for 10 mi nutes in a refrigerated centrifuge. 
The resulting supernatant is designated serum. Following centrifugation, it is important to 
immediately transfer the liquid component (serum) into a clean polypropylene tube using a Pasteur pipette. The samples should be maintained at 2-8°C while handling. The serum 
should be apportioned into 0.5 ml aliquots, stored, and transported at –20°C or lower. It is 
important to avoid freeze-thaw cycles because this is detrimental to many serum 
components. Samples which are hemolyzed, ic teric or lipemic can invalidate tests. 
Plasma samples (5-10 mL) 
Plasma Collect whole blood into commercia lly available anticoagulant-treated tubes e.g., 
EDTA-treated (lavender tops) or citrate-tr eated (light blue tops). Heparinized tubes 
(green tops) are not permitted. Cells are re moved from plasma by centrifugation for 10 
minutes at 1,000-2,000 x g using a refrigerat ed centrifuge. Centrifugation for 15 minutes 
at 2,000 x g depletes platelets in the plasma sample. 
The resulting supernatant is designated plasma . Following centrifugation, it is important 
to immediately transfer the liquid component (plasma) into a clean polypropylene tube 
using a Pasteur pipette. The samples should be maintained at 2-8°C while handling. If 
the plasma is not analyzed immediately, the plasma should be apportioned into 0.5 ml 
aliquots, stored, and transported at –20°C or lower. It is important to avoid freeze-thaw 
cycles. 
  10.2 Specimen Banking 
Patient samples (plasma and serum) collect ed for this study will be retained at the 
University of Michigan. Specim ens will be stored indefinitely or until they are used up. If 
future use is denied or withdrawn by the patient, best efforts will be made to stop any additional studies and to destroy the specimens. 
Specimens being stored long-term for potential use not outlined in the protocol are subject 
to University Policy Governing Tissue Sa mple Collection, Ownership, Usage, and 
Disposition within all UMMS Research Repositories  
 
11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
The primary aim of this single-arm phase 2 trial is  to determine the efficacy of the combination of 
pembrolizumab and abraxane in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma. The primary endpoint is the ORR (Overall Response Rate = Complete Response + Partial Response per 
RECIST 1.1) proportion. 
  11.1 Study Design 
Historical ORR in these subjects  (both platinum-refractory and cisplatin- ineligible) treated with 
anti-PD1/PDL1 is 16-23%. For stud y design purposes, we state t hat an ORR of <25% with the 
combination of pembrolizumab and abraxane w ould be uninteresting and an ORR of 45% or 
greater would be interesting for furthe r investigation. We will utilize a Simon’s two-stage 
minimax design with 17 response evaluable patients in stage 1 and 19 additional response 
evaluable patients possible in stage 2 for a total sample size of 36 response evaluable 
UMCC 2017.077  
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 59 of 63 patients.  This design will provide 80% power with a 5%  type I error.  If 4 or less responses are 
found in stage 1, then the combination will be cons idered uninteresting for further study.  If 5 or 
more responses are in stage 1, then stage 2 will be opened to accrual.  After accrual of 36 
response evaluable patients, if 14 or more responses are observed then the combination 
treatment will be declared interesting for further study.  This tria l design has a 57 % probability of 
terminating early if the true response rate is < 25% and only 6% pr obability of early termination if 
the true response rate is 45% or greater.  Response evaluable is defined below. 
Interim Analysis in the Simon’s two-stage mini-max design:   
After 17 response evaluable pati ents have been accrued in stage 1, an interim efficacy analysis 
will be done.  If 4 or fewer responses are observ ed, then the trial will stop and the combination 
will be deemed uninteresting for further investigat ion. If 5 or more responses are observed, then 
stage 2 will be opened and 19 more response  evaluable patients will be accrued. 
Populations for Analysis 
Intent-to-Treat Population: All patients consented and enrolled in the trial. 
Response Evaluable Population: Only those patients who have had their disease re-evaluated by 
imaging after 2 cycles of therapy OR exhibit objective or unequivocal clinical disease progression 
prior to the end of cycle 2 will be considered evaluable for the primary endpoint. 
Safety Evaluable Population: Patients who receive any treatment  on protocol will be considered 
evaluable for safety. 
  11.2 Sample Size and Accrual 
The planned accrual for Stage 1 of the Simon tw o-stage trial is 17 subjects. If the criterion 
for the interim efficacy analysis (as above) is met, the study will move on to Stage 2 for 
an additional accrual of 19 subjects more. 
Accrual for Stage 1 is expected to be over 12 months at the University of Michigan. 
Accrual for Stage 2 (if applicable) will be over an additional 12 months at the University of 
Michigan. 
  11.3 Data Analyses Plans 
Primary Analysis:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is best over all response rate. The primary analysis will 
include the response count and proportion with the associated exact 95% binomial 
confidence interval in the response evaluable population.  If stage 2 is initiated, then the 
efficacy analysis methods fo r the reported respon se confidence interval will be as 
described by Koyama and Chen [32]. A seco ndary analysis in the intent-to-treat 
population will be reported.  Patients who are unable to receive 2 cycles of treatment due 
to toxicity will be considered non-respon ders in the intent-to-treat analysis. 
Secondary Endpoint Analysis: 
Safety and Toxicity of pembrolizumab and abraxane will be listed and tabulated by organ 
system per CTCAE grade version 4.03. The number of cycles, dose reductions and dose 
delays will be described.  All safety and toxicity analyses will be done on the Safety 
evaluable population.   
Time-to-event endpoints including PFS (Progression-Free Survival), DOR (Duration of 
Response) and OS (Overall Survival) will be described using Kaplan-Meier methods.   
Kaplan-Meier plots and median, 12-month and 24-month product limit estimates with 
95% confidence interv als will be reported. DO T (Duration of Therap y) will be described 
UMCC 2017.077  
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 60 of 63 using a median and inter-quartile range. CR (Complete Response) proportion will be 
reported with a count, proportion and associat ed 95% exact binomial confidence interval. 
Correlative analysis:  
PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue and TILs at baseline (and in optional tumor biopsy at 
progression) will be reported when such testing is performed with count and proportions 
and 95% confidence intervals, and correlated with response using chi-square tests and logistic models. 
Exploratory analysis:  
Development of a Therapy Response Predictor based on baseline (and separately in 
optional tumor biopsy tissue at progression wh en available) immune parameters in tissue 
will be explored using logistic models.  Elastic net and random forest methods will be 
used and compared to develop the predictor m odel. Quality of Life with patient-reported 
outcomes (EQ-5D-5L) will be described using m eans or medians and associated 
measures of variability.

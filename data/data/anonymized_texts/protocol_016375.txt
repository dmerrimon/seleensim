RATIONA LE
Changes to the protocol, along with a rationale for each change, are summarized as 
follows and are reflected as applicable in the protocol:
The Medical Monitor has been updated.
The study design figure has been modified without changes to the overall desig n 
(Figure 1) .
The British Isles Lupus Activity Group ( BILAG )and Physician’s Global Assessment
(PGA) components of the SRI-4 have been removed from the secondary endpoints 
because those components are not standalone endpoints . The reduction of at least 
4 points from baseline in the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 
(SLEDAI )-2K remains an exploratory endpoint because it is the only component 
within the SRI -4 thatshows clinical improvement (Section 2) .
The endpoint to evaluate SRI-4 response at Week 48 with and without oral 
corticosteroid (OCS) taper to evaluate patients with high plasmablast signature 
levels to have an enhanced clinical response to GDC -0853 relative to patients with 
low levels remains a secondary endpoint. The ot her corresponding endpoints to 
evaluate SRI -4 response at W eek 24 with and without OCS taper have been 
re-categorized as exploratory endpoints (Section 2 , Section 6.4.2, and 
Section 6.4.3 ).
To better characterize the progression of lupus in patients on tri al and provide other 
endpoints that may be less sensitive to placebo response, the BILAG -based 
Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) and SRI -6 endpoints have been re-
categorized from exploratory to secondary endpoints (Section 2) .
Pharmacokinetic (PK) objecti ves and endpoints have been updated to clarify that 
the stated analysis will be conducted solely on pharmacokinetic data gener ated from 
the current study. PKanalyses that incorporate data from multiple clinical studies 
(potentially including GS39684), including population PK analyses using models that 
incorporate pooled data, may be conducted separately (Section 2) .
The length of the study has been updated from 62 to 61 we eks to reflect the sum of 
the 5 -week screening period, 48 -week study conduct period, and 8 -week safety 
follow -up period (Section 3.2.1). 
Language has been added to clarify the reference for nonclinical efficacy data for 
the BTK inhibitor GDC -0834 (Section 3.3.1) .
The minimum SLEDAI -2K score requirement for subjects to enroll in the study has 
been increased from a 6 to an 8 to ensure severity of lupus is appropriate for the 
study (Section 4.1.1) .
The requirements for at least one standard oral treatment for SLE within the dose 
ranges specified in the inclusion criteria have been clarified . Additional SLE 
treatments do not need to be above t he lower limits of doses listed (Section 4.1.1) .
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
3/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3The maximum doses of mycophenolate mofetil and mycophenolic sodium have
been increased to allow for patients with stable renal function or patients with more 
active lupus disease to be included in the study (Section 4.1.1) .
The lupus nephritis exclusion criteri ahave been updated to allow for patients with 
mild renal dysfunction , similar to other recent lupus trials, to enrich for patients with 
more serologic activity who might be expected to respond better to study treatment
(Section 4.1.2) .
The exclusion criterion regarding history of anti -phospholipid antibody syndrome has 
been further clarified to exp lain that low doses of aspirin or clopidogrel for 
anti-coagulation are not excluded but s hould follow local regulations (Section 4.1.2) .
Langua ge has been added to clarify tuberculosis exclusion criteria (Section 4.1.2) .
Time -specific medications that cann ot be taken prior to screening have been 
clarified from days to weeks (Section 4.1.2) .
Language has been added to clarify how sites should document study drug 
administration (Section 4.3.2.2).
Language has been added to clarify that anti -malarial dose s should remain stable 
on study (Section 4.3.2.3.1) .
Steroid burst treatment and t apering requirement language has been clarified 
(Section 4.3.2.3.3) .
Clarification has been provided for steroid doses that areconsidered escape 
therapy (Section 4.3.2.3.4) .
Language has been added to clarify that low doses of aspirin may not be taken at 
the same time as anti -platelet agents (Section 4.4.1.5). 
Anti-platelet agents have been removed from the list of prohibited therapies as there 
have been no bleeding events to date and there does not appear to be an increased
risk from anti -platelet agents (Section 4.4.2) .
Leflunomide, penicillamine, and sulfasalazine were primarily considered 
exclusionary since they affect the progression of rheumatoid arthritis (another 
indica tion being assessed with GDC -0853). Since these medications are unlikely to 
be used in l upus, they have been removed from the prohibited medications list
(Section 4.4.2) .
IV and IM steroids (except as escape therapy )have been added to the prohibited 
therapies section (Section 4.4.2) .
The CYP3A drug -drug interaction section was updated based on new data from 
clinical pharmacology studies (Section 4.4.2.2) .
Clarifying language has been added to patient preparation for electrocardiograms 
(Section 4.5.10.2) .
The hepatotoxicity language has been updated to clarify the expected AST/ALT 
values required for eligibility on study do not depend on creatinine kinase ( CK), 
aldolase, and lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH)values obtained at screening
(Section 5.1.1.6) .
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.  
4/Protocol GA30044, Version 3 • Language has been revised to account for the fact that some sites may not allow 
follow -up on partner pregnancies (Section 5.4.3.2). 
• Language has been updated to clarify the analysis method for the primary endpoint (Section 6.4.1). 
• Language has been revised to clarify the PK analysis details (Section 6.6). 
• Language has been added to clarify that the Sponsor will review all protocol deviations as per the Sponsor’s Standard Operating Procedures, and prospective requests to deviate from the protocol are not allowed (Section 9.2). 
• The Web site URL for the "Roche Global Policy on Sharing of Clinical Trials Data" has been corrected (Section 9.5).  
• Height measurement has been added to the Week 48 visit to align with the 
open-label extension study and to allow for comparison to baseline (Appendix 1). 
• CK, a ldolase, and LDH have been added to the Week 48 visit to align with the 
open-label extension study and to allow for comparison to baseline (Appendix 1) . 
• T, B, and natural killer cells ( TBNK ) has been added at screening to allow the 
adjudication committee to review CD19 count during screening (Appendix 1) . 
• The blood sample for pharmacodynamics ( PD) RNA, PD biomarker serum and 
plasma, exploratory urinary biomarker collection, and peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMC) will no longer be collected at the early termination visit in order to 
reduce study procedure related burden for patients  as these samples are not 
necessary  for safety follow-up (Appendix 1). 
• The Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics ( SLICC ) Damage  Index has 
been updated to the 1997 version including pancreatic insufficiency and tendon 
rupture (Appendix 7) . 
• Appendix 19 has been updated based on new clinical pharmacology data. 
 
Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency.  
Substantive new information appears in italics.  This amendment represents cumulative 
changes to the original protocol.

Study Design
Description of Study
This is a multicenter, Phase II, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, 
dose -ranging study to evaluate the safety  and efficacy of GDC -0853 in combination with SOC 
therapy in patients with moderate to severe active SLE.  Moderate to severe SLE will be defined 
at screening and baseline (i.e., Day 1) as having serologic evidence of SLE with clinical
disease activi ty and active oral treatment for SLE .
The study will consist of a screening period (up to 35 days) and a 48 -week treatment period, 
followed by either an 8 -week safety  follow -up visit at W eek56 or possible enrollment into an 
open- label extension (OLE) stud y.  Approximately 240 patients, meeting all eligibility criteria, will 
be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the following 3 arms: 
Arm A:  GDC -0853 200 mg twice daily (BID)
Arm B:  GDC -0853 150 mg once daily (QD)
Arm C:  placebo 
All 3 arms will receiv e blinded study drug in combination with background SOC therapy.  
Randomization will be stratified by disease activity at screening, entry dose of oral 
corticosteroids (OCS), and geographic region. All patients will receive blinded study drug twice 
daily (GDC -0853, placebo, or both to maintain the blind) from baseline to W eek48 and will be 
assessed at site visits every 4 weeks (including a site -initiated phone call at Week1) during the 
treatment period.  
Pre-enrollment adjudication by the Medical Monito r and his/her designees will occur for all 
patients who complete screening prior to their randomization into the study.  The Medical 
Monitor or assigned designee will make the final decision whether or not a patient is eligible for 
randomization.  
Backgro und SOC therapy may consist of an OCS (which must be stable for 2 weeks prior to 
screening, dose not to exceed 40 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) and/or certain oral 
immunosuppression regimens (which must be stable for 2 months prior to screening ).All 
immunosuppressive and anti -malarial m edication will be kept stable throughout the trial unless 
dose reductions are necessary due to toxicity.  All patients receiving immunosuppressive 
treatments are also encouraged to be on supportive therapy (e.g., foli c acid, calcium, vitamin D). 
For patients who are on angiotensin converting enzy me (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor 
blockers (ARBs) at study entry , doses of ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be kept stable for at 
least 10 days prior to randomization a nd throughout the trial whenever possible.  It is strongly 
recommended that ACE inhibitors or ARBs not be initiated during the OCS stability windows .
For patients on an OCS at baseline, there will be two, 12 -week, OCS taper windows available to 
achieve the pre-specified OCS taper of 10 mg/d ay prednisone or equivalent .  The dose at the 
end of each OCS -stability window (i.e., the 12 -week period immediately following the 12- week 
OCS taper window) will then be kept stable for an additional 12 weeks.   
In the case of increased SLE disease activity, there can be two temporary increases in the 
corticosteroid dose, called “bursts,” that may be administered if needed .  A burst may only be 
administered during a burst window (defined as the first 10 weeks of e ach OCS taper window)
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
19/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3and only once per window .  A burst is defined as a temporary increase in corticosteroid dose 
(up to 40 mg/d prednisone or equivalent for Burst Window 1, and up to 20 mg/d prednisone or 
equivalent for Burst W indow 2) with a taper back down to the dose immediately preceding the 
burst, all within a 2 -week period.
If additional treatment is needed beyond the permitted burst therapy because of active SLE, as 
identified by the investigator, the patient may receive escape therapy; however, su ch patients 
will be considered trial -defined non -responders for the purposes of the primary analy sis.
During taper, burst, and permitted escape therapies, patients will continue to receive their 
designated dose of study treatment .
Starting at the screening period, all patients must record their actual OCS use weekly , as 
instructed by study staff .
An unblinded IMC and Scientific Oversight Committee will be used to monitor multiple safety
assessments .  In addition, an interim analysis will be conducted after 50 -80 patients in each 
treatment arm have completed 24 weeks of treatment and have been evaluated for SLE 
Responder Index (SRI) -4 response, in order to conduct a prelim inary assessment of the 
benefit -risk profile of GDC 0853 and potentially enable early st opping for futility and/or safety 
issues .
Number of Patients
Approximately 240 patients, who meet all eligibility criteria, will be enrolled into the study. 
Target Population
Inclusion Criteria
Patients must meet the following criteria for study entry:
Signed Informed Consent Form
Age 18 75 years, inclusive

Rheumatology (ACR) or Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Cli nics (SLICC) criteria 
at any time prior to or at screening 
At least one serologic marker of SLE at screening as follows:
– Positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test by immunofluorescent assay with titer 
1:80; OR
– Positive anti-double -stranded DNA (anti -dsDNA) antibodies; OR 
– Positive anti -Smith antibody 
At both screening and Day 1, moderate to severe active SLE, defined as meeting allof the

anti-malarials, and/or immunosuppressants) for SLE within the dose ranges, as 
specified below
If on an OCS, the dose must be 40 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) and must 
have been stable for at least 2 weeks prior to screening as well as during screening
If on anti -malarial or immunosuppressant therapie s, may  only be receiving 
medications from the following list within the specified dose range; dose and route 
of administration must be stable for 8 weeks prior to screening as well as during 
screening :
– Azathioprine:  1 to 2.5 mg/kg/day 
– Methotrexate:  7. 5 to 25 mg/week 
– Mycophenolate mofetil:  500 to 3000 mg/day
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
20/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3– Mycophenolic sodium:  360 to 2160mg/day
– Hydroxychloroquine:  200 to 400 mg/day
– Chloroquine:  100 to 250 mg/day 
– Quinacrine: 100 to 200 mg/day
– Other:  Consult with Medical Monitor
Note:  Any combination of azathioprine, methotrexate, my cophenolate mofetil, or 
mycophenolic sodium is prohibited.
For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from 
heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of 1% 
per year during the study treatment period and for a minimum of 60 days after the last dose 
of study drug or longer as required by local requirements for other standard of care 
medications.  W omen using estrogen -containing hormonal contraceptives as a method of 
contraception mustalso use a barrier.
– A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has not 
reached a postmenopausal state ( 12continuous months of amenorrhea with no 
identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization 
(removal of ovaries and/or uterus).
– Example s of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of  1%per year include bilateral 
tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormone -releasing intrauterine devices, and copper 
intrauterine devices.  Established proper use of hormonal contraceptives that inhibit 
ovulation also have a failure rate of 1%per year; however, women using estrogen -
containing hormonal contraceptives as a method of contraception must also use a 
barrier, such as a male condom, in conjunction with the hormonal contraceptives.
– The reliabili ty of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic abstinence 
(e.g., calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, or post -ovulation methods) and withdrawal 
are not acceptable methods of contraception.
For men:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use 
contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm as defined below:
– Men with female partners of childbearing potential must remain abstinent or use a 
condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of 
1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 120 days (16 weeks) after 
the last dose of study treatment.  Men must refrain from donating sperm during this 
same period.
– Men with pregnant female partners must remain abstinent or use a condom during the 
treatment period and for at least 28 days after the last dose of study treat ment to avoid 
exposing the embryo.
– The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic abstinence 
(e.g., calendar, ovulation, sy mptotherm al, or post -ovulation methods) and withdrawal 
are not acceptable methods of contraception.

screened using the QFT test only.
Iftheinitial QFT test is indeterminate, a confirmatory test with either a QFT or T -SPOT® TB 
test (performed locally if available).  The PI may  consult with the Medical Monitor to discuss 
selection of confirmatory  test based on the patient’s disease status and baseline 
immunosuppression .
– An indeterminate QFT test followed by a negative QFT or negative T -SPOTtest 
should be considered a negative di agnostic TB test.
– An indeterminate QFT test followed by an indeterminate QFT test or indeterminate 
T-SPOTtest should be considered a positive diagnostic TB test

End of Stud y
The end of study is defined as the last patient, last safety follow -up visit in this protocol, last 
patient to discontinue from the study, or the last patient enrolled into an OLE, if initiated, 
whichever occurs latest.
Length of Study
The maximum length of time on study for a patient is 61weeks, including screening for up to 
35days, treatment for 48 weeks, and a safety follow -up period for 8 weeks (unless enrolled into 
an OLE study ). 
Investigational Medicinal Products
Test Product (Investigational Drug)
The investigational medicinal product (IMP) for this study is GDC -0853 50 -mg tablets.
Comparator
The comparator will comprise corresponding matching placebo tablets, which will be 
indistinguishable in appearance.
Non-Investigational Medicinal Product s
All patients who enter the study on oral immunosuppressant therapy (not including 
corticosteroids) or anti -malarial medications will be instructed to maintain their medications 
and doses from screening throughout the rest of the study treatment period.  After entering the 
study, patients may  not begin taking a new oral immunosuppressant except in the case of 
increased clinical activity requiring escape therapy .
Corticosteroids
For all patients who enter the study on oral prednisone (or permitted equivalen t OCS), there will 
be two, 12 -week, OCS taper windows (W eeks 0to 12, and W eeks 24 to 36) where their dose, if 
10 mg/day, will be tapered to 10 mg/day.  During a taper window, patients will continue to 
receive their designated dose of study treatment. 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
25/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3TheOCS rules are as follows:  the OCS dose level achieved at the end of each OCS taper 
window will be maintained during the 12 -week, OCS stability windows (W eeks 12 to 24 and 
Weeks 36 to 48), whether or not the target OCS dose was achieved.  Patients will be instructed 
not to deviate from this dose level achieved at the end of the OCS taper window, unless 
considered clinically appropriate by the investigator.  
Patients should follow the appropriate tapering schedule as determined by the investigator, 
taking into account the taper window timing and the target OCS dose ( 10mg/day and Day1 
dose).  The investigator may modify a tapering schedule based on the patient’s response to the 
reduction in corticosteroid dose.  A suggested prednisone tapering schedule is provided; in 
addition, the investigator may consult the Medical Monitor.  O nce 10 mg/day is achieved, 
tapering completely off corticosteroids is allowed if this is deemed clinically appropriate by the 
investigator (i.e., if there is minimal risk of inducing flare). 
It is recommended that all patients receiving corticosteroids should receive appropriate 
supportive therapy to help prevent steroid -induced osteoporosis (e.g., calcium, vitamin D 
supplements, bisphosphonates) as per local guidelines and physician preference.  
Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia prophylaxis is also recomm ended to be used as per local 
SOC.
Intra-articular injections and intra -lesional cutaneous injections of corticosteroids must be 
avoided during the study if possible ,as these interventions will confound the efficacy  
assessments .
If a patient entered the s tudy on low potenc y topical steroids (e.g., Class VI and Class VII), the 
steroid can be continued during the course of the study at a stable dose
Burst Treatment
In the case of increased disease activity, the patient will have the opportunity to receive burst 
treatment, in addition to the study treatment, during the defined burst treatment window.  The 
patient should return to the clinic, either at a scheduled study visit or unscheduled flare visit, to 
be evaluated and to receive an increase or new dose of oral prednisone as follows:
Burst Window 1 (W eeks 0to 10):  An increase or new dose of oral prednisone up to 
40mg/day (or equivalent)
Burst Window 2 (W eeks 24 to 34):  An increase or new dose in oral prednisone up to 20 
mg/day (or equivalent)
When using corticosteroids as a burst treatment, the investigator will temporarily increase the 
dose of corticosteroids and then taper the patient back down to their previous corticosteroid 
dose used prior to the initiation of the burst , all over the course of 2 week s.  Patients will 
continue to receive their designated dose of study treatment during the burst treatment.  The 
previous corticosteroid dose is defined as the dose of corticosteroids taken for the 2 weeks prior 
to the burst (if the dose changed during the 2weeks, the investigator may choose which dose to 
use).  If the patient was not previously on corticosteroids, the investigator will taper the patient 
back off corticosteroids completely.  If the patient was on a corticosteroid -tapering schedule at 
the ti me of the burst treatment, the investigator will revise the tapering schedule as necessary to 
meet the target OCS dose ( 10mg/day and  Day1 dose) by the end of the taper window, if 
clinically appropriate .
Patients may receive corticosteroids for emergent illness other than SLE (e.g., trauma, asthma) 
or if clinically warranted to prevent adrenal crisis (e.g., prior to surger y).  If possible, treatment in 
these cases should last no more than 7 days.
Escape Therapy
If an increase in immunosuppressive therapy (referred to as “escape therapy ”) is deemed 
medically necessary due to increased SLE disease activity, the patient will be given escape 
therapy, which will be recorded on the Steroid and Immunosuppressant eCRF.  Patients 
receiving the following es cape therapies, may be allowed to remain on study drug after 
discussion with the Medical Monitor but will be considered a protocol -defined “non -responder” 
in the primary  analysis:  
IVor IM steroids (at doses greater than 40 mg prednisone PO or equivalent )
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
26/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3OCS doses exceeding the limits described elsewhere in the protocol (e.g., prednisone (or 
equivalent) doses of > 40 mg/day during the first 24 weeks of the study, or > 20 mg/day 
between Weeks 24 and 48)
New or increased doses of an immunosuppressant or an ti-malarial medication up to the 
maximum allowed in the study 
NOTE:  Combinations of immunosuppressant medications that are not allowed in the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria are prohibited during the study.
Statistical Methods
Primary A nalysis
The primary  efficac y endpoint for this study is SRI -4 response at Week 48.
The primary  endpoint will be compared between each of the two GDC -0853 arms and the 
placebo arm by using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test statistic, stratified by the factors 
used at ra ndomization. The absolute difference in remission rates and 95% CI for the point 
estimate will be provided .  
Determination of Sample Size  
The purpose of this study is estimation and hypothesis generation regarding the effect of 
GDC -0853 on W eek 48SRI-4response rate relative to placebo in moderate to severe active 
SLE patients and a biomarker -defined subgroup of patients.  A total of 240 patients will be 
randomly allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive one of two doses of GDC -0853 (200 mg BID 
GDC -0853 [Ar m A] or 150 mg QD GDC -0853 [Arm B]) or placebo (Arm C).  This sample size 
will provide approximately 88% power at a 2 -sided 0. 05significance level to detect a 25% 
absolute improvement in the response rate for a GDC -0853 containing arm relative to the 
placebo arm assuming a placebo response -rate of 50%.  Patients without post -baseline 
response assessments will be treated as non -responders.  For an evaluation of efficacy in a 
subgroup defined by a predictive biomarker with 50% prevalence, the total sample -size of 
80patients per arm provides approximately 80% power to detect a 25% improvement with 2-
sided 0.20 significance level , using the Fisher’s Exact Test.  No adjustment for multiple 
comparisons will be made .
Interim A nalyses
An interim analy sis will be performed after 50 80patients in each of treatment arm have 
completed their 24 -week SRI-4 response evaluation.  The purpose of the interim analysis is to 
conduct a preliminary benefit -riskassessment of GDC- 0853 treated arms compared with the 
placebo -treated arm and enable potential stopping for futility and/or safety concerns or to 
potentially inform the clinical development plan for GDC -0853. The interim analysis will be 
performed and interpreted by the IMC in conjunction with a Scientific Oversight Committee who 
will be unblinded at the treatment group level.  Additional personnel, such as Clinical 
Pharmacology and biomarker scientists , may  be unblinded in order to prepare additional data 
displays relevant for IMC and Scient ific Oversight Committee review.  
The study will continue to enroll while the interim analysis is being performed.  If the interim 
analysis indicates that one of the two dose levels of GDC -0853 does not have an appropriate 
safety profile or meets futility criteria as defined in the interim analysis plan in the DAP which will 
be written prior to conducting the interim analysis , the Sponsor may  discontinue enrollment into 
that dose arm and switch patients to the other dose arm for the remainder of the study.   The 
Sponsor may  also elect to amend the protocol to change the dose level of GDC -0853.   
Given the hypothesis -generating nature of this study, the Sponsor may  choose to conduct an 
additional efficacy interim efficacy  analy sis in order to further guide i nternal decision making 
around issues such as the adequacy of dose ranging, the adequacy of sample sizes for safety  
and/or efficacy  analyses, or to inform the clinical development plan for GDC -0853.  The study 
will not be stopped for any other reason other than futility or safety concerns at the time of the 
interim analysis.  The interim analysis will be performed and interpreted by the IMC in 
conjunction with a Scientific Oversight Committee who will be unblinded at the treatment group 
level.  Additional p ersonnel, such as Clinical Pharmacology and biomarker scientists, may  be 
unblinded in order to prepare additional data displays relevant for IMC and Scientific Oversight 
Committee review.  The decision to conduct an additional interim analy sis and the timi ng of the 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
27/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3analysis will be documented in the Sponsor’s trial master file and updated DAP prior to the 
conduct of the interim analysis .

32/Protocol GA30044 , Version 31. BACKGROUND
1.1 BACKGROUND
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune rheumatic disease that occurs 
primarily in women of childbearing age.  It is characterized by multisystem involvement 
and immunological abnormalities, and much of the tissue damage is thought to occur 
through autoantibody formation and immune complex deposition.  The disease is 
heterogeneous in its clinical presentation, course, and prognosis.  However, most 
patients present with joint involvement, skin rashes, mouth u lcers, Raynaud’s 
phenomenon, and/or severe fatigue.  Inflammation of pericardial and pleural tissues may 
also be present.  The most serious manifestations include central nervous system and 
renal involvement, which correlate with poor outcomes that include temporary or 
permanent disability or death.  Typically, the disease follows a relapsing -remitting course 
with intermittent periods of disease activity (flare) interspersed with periods of relative 
quiescence.
The incidence and prevalence of SLE varies wit h sex, race, and ethnicity.  The 
estimated prevalence of SLE ranges between 65 and 155 per 100,000 
(Walshetal.2001 ; Ward2004 ;Naleway etal.2005 ; Chakravarty etal.2007 ; 
Molinaetal.2007 ; Sacks etal.2010 ;Feldman etal.2013 ; Furst etal.2013 ; 
Limetal.2014 ).  In adulthood, approximately nine times as many women as men are 
affected.  The disease has a higher incidence and worse outcome among 
African -Americans, Afro -Caribbeans, Hispanics, and Asians compared with Caucasians.
Medications for the successful treatment of SLE as measured by long -term remission 
are limited, and on ly one new medication for SLE treatment has been approved in more 
than 50 years ( Burness and McCormack 2011 ).  Analgesics and nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) provide partial symptomatic relief.  Anti-malarial drugs 
aregenerally well tolerated by patients with SLE and appear to have a beneficial effect 
on the prevention of lupus flares, increasing long -term survival, and possibly 
ameliorating certain types of organ damage ( Ruiz-Irastorza etal.2009 ).  However, the se 
agents are generally regarded as having insufficient efficacy for moderate to severe 
manifestations of SLE.
The mainstays of therapy for more significant manifestations of SLE are corticosteroids 
and off -label use of immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., metho trexate, mycophenolic acid 
[as either mycophenolate mofetil or Myf ortic(mycophenolic acid as sodium salt)], 
azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide), which have profound and diverse effects on the 
immune system in patients with lupus ( Tunnicliffe et al. 2015 ).  However, the use of 
these immunosuppressant agents is limited by their safety profiles.  Corticosteroids, for 
example, are effective for many of the manifestations of SLE but have significant 
short- and long -term adverse effects, including infections, osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, 
hypertension, osteonecrosis, cataracts, and hyperlipidemia.
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
33/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3As a measure of unmet need, the risk of mortality remains elevated for patients with 
lupus.  In the modern era, on t he basis of a multisite international cohort of 9500 patients 
with lupus, the standardized mortality ratio was 2.4, with particularly high mortality seen 
with renal disease ( Fors Nieves and Izmirly 2016 ).  The development of new treatments 
for SLE patients with increased efficacy and decreased toxicity remains an important 
and a necessary area of investigation . 
1.2 BACKGROUND ON BRUTON’S TYROSINE KI NASE A ND 
GDC- 0853
1.2.1 Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase
Discove ryof the g eneticbasis for prima ryimmunodeficiencies hasbeen the source 
ofnew therap eutic targets i n immunomodulatory therapies ( Puri et al. 2013 ; 
Bugatti et al. 2014 ;Whang and C hang2014 ). In humans,inactivating mutati ons in the
gene f or Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (B TK), which is locate d on the X chromosome, can
result in the development ofan immunod eficiency state c haracterize d bya significan t
absence of ci rculatin g B c ells (Bruton 1952 ;Tsuk ada et al . 1993 ; Vetrie e t al. 1993;
Conley et al. 2005 )and verylow immuno globulin (Ig) levels due to adefect in B-cel l 
differentiatio n at the pro- t o pre-B cell stage that pre
cludes assembly of th e B-cell 
receptor ( BCR) complex and Iggene expression ( Reth andNielsen 2014 ).  Affected mal e 
patientshave a prima ry immune de ficiency ca lled X-linked aga mmaglobulinemia (XLA) 
and a re suscep tible to recurr ent infecti onsstarting shortly after birth .  XLA patients can 
live relatively normal lives on a standard therapy of intravenous (IV) Ig ( Kaveri et al. 
2011 ), suggesting that BTK can be safely inhibited especially in people with established 
immune systems.
BTK isa tyrosine kinase essenti alfor signaling events required for thedifferentiation and
activity of B ce llsduring immune system ontolog
yand nor mal ad aptive immune
response s. In addition, BTK is required for signaling associated with Fc R, expressed 
on a variety of myeloid cells.  BTK isactivated by phosphatidyli nositol 
3-kinase depende nt plas mamembrane r
ecruitment and phosphor ylation on tyrosine 
Y551 by theSrc-fam ily kinase L yn. Autophos phorylation and activati on also occurs on
tyrosine Y223 in aBTK-s pecificmanner.  Once ac tivated, B TK induces PLC2- an d 
Ca2-dependent s ignaling, whi ch leads to the activati on of NF-κB andNFAT- dependent
pathways leading to cellular activation and differentiation ( Niiro and Clark 2002 ). 
Thetherapeu ticpotenti al of BTK i nhibit orsasanti-cancer agents has been es tablished in 
clinical trials wit h agents ,including ibrutinib,a coval entinhibit orof BTK, which has been 
approved in the United States and Europe for use in patients with mantle -cell lymphoma, 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia.
1.2.2 Nonclinical Experience with GDC -0853
GDC- 0853 isa highly sel ective,orallyadministered, reversible inhibit orof BTK that is 
being devel oped by Genentech, Inc. as apotenti al therapeutic f or autoim mune di seases, 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
34/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and SLE.  GDC -0853 has unde rgoneextensive 
investigation in nonc linicalin vitroandin vivo st udies to characterize itspharm acological , 
metabolic, an d toxicologi cal prop erties (see the GDC- 0853 Investigator’s Brochure) .
In vitrocell-ba sed experim ents sugges t that antag onism of BT K leads to inhibitio n of 
BCR-dependen t cell proliferatio n and areduction of infla mmatorycytokine pr oduction 
f
rom myeloi d cells (incl uding tumor necrosis factor alpha [ TNF- , interleukin [ IL]-1, and
IL-6) by prev enting sig naling through t he FcRIII receptor ( di Paolo et al.2011;Liu e t al.
2011).  GDC- 0853 effectively block s BCR-and CD40-m ediate d activatio n and 
proliferatio n ofB cells. BTK i n Bcells also plays a role in TLR4-mediate d B-cel l 
proliferation and class switching .  In monocytes, GDC -0853 inh ibits TLR4- and i mmune 
complex-m ediate d inflammato rycytoki ne production, including TNF- , which contributes
to disea se pathog enesis in SLE (Mina -Osorio et al. 2013 ; Bender et al. 2016 ). In 
dend ritic ce lls, BTK contributes to TLR8-m ediated cytokin e production (TNF- and IL-6) 
(Sochorová et al. 2007 ). Inbasoph ils, BTK- dependen t activatio n of the Fc R leads t o 
activatio n and up-regula tion ofCD63 .  In addition, GDC -0853 has been shown to inhibit 
the differentiation of human plasmablasts into plasma cells in vitro (see the GDC -0853 
Investigator’s Brochure).  Patients with lupus have multiple abnormalities in the blood ,
including increased levels of pl asmablasts ( Anolik et al. 2004 ).  Together, these data 
suggest that lupus patients with elevated levels of plasmablasts might demonstrate a 
more robust clinical response to GDC -0853.  Therefore, an RNA signature biomarker 
encompassing genes preferentially expressed in plasmablasts was developed to detect 
the presence of elevated plasmablasts in the peripheral blood.  In addition , efficacy in 
patients with high or low levels of the plasmablast signature will be compared for 
potential increased or decreased efficacy, res pectively (see Table 1 ). 
The efficacy of GDC -0853 has been investigated in inflammatory models of arthritis as 
well as immune -complex mediated renal -injury models similar to the manifestations of 
human SLE.  Arthritis was investigated in female Lewis rats with developing Type II 
collagen- induced arthritis (CIA).  GDC -0853 treatment was well tolerated and resulted in 
significant and dose -dependent reduction in ankle swelling.   GDC- 0853 was effective at 
significantly reducing anti -rat collagen II IgG antibod ies in the serum (obtained on 
Day16) with daily (QD) doses 0.25 mg/kg/day.  However, there was no effect of 
GDC- 0853 treatment on total anti -rat IgG antibodies in the serum.  Findings from the 
histopathology evaluation were consistent withthe clinical findings.  Immune -complex 
mediated inflammation (induced by autoantibodies) and tissue injury is central to the 
pathogenesis and the majority of clinical manifestations of SLE.  GDC -0853 in 
nonclinical studies is a potent inhibitor of these processes.  Studies in interferon -alpha 
(IFN-)accelerated, New Zealand Black (NZB)/New Zealand W hite (NZW ), lupus -prone 
mice have shown that BTK -inhibition resulted in dose -dependent improvement in 
survival (see the GDC -0853 Investigator’s Brochure).  In addition, B TK inhibition reduces 
the development and levels of splenic plasmablasts, a pool of activated 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
35/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3antibody -producing B -cells, and systemic inflammation as evidenced by a decrease in 
the Type- 1 interferon (IFN) signature in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).  
The GDC -0853 safety profile has been assessed in repeat -dose, general toxicology 
studies (daily oral dosing) ranging from 1 week to 9 months in rats and dogs; in vitro and 
in vivo genetic toxicology studies; in vitro phototoxicity evaluation; in v itro and in vivo 
safety pharmacology studies of the central nervous, respiratory, and cardiovascular 
system; and embryo- fetal development (Seg II) studies in rats and rabbits.  Overall, 
GDC- 0853 was well tolerated for 6 months in rats (up to 104 Mhr) and 9 months in 
dogs (up to 36 Mhr).  Notable findings identified in nonclinical toxicology studies 
include vascular inflammation in dogs ( 56 Mhr), hepatotoxicity in dogs (180 Mhr), 
and a minimal increase in corrected QT interval in dogs (QTc; 7 ms ecor 3%; 
extrapolated unbound maximum observed concentration [C max] of 3.17 M). Fetal 
malformations in rats (at 627Mhr) and rabbits ( 10.6Mhr)warrant the continued 
use of contraception in clinical trials. On the basis of the nonclinical and clinical safety 
data to date, GDC -0853 is expected to be well tolerated at the doses and duration 
administered in the current study, GA30044.
1.2.3 Clinical Experience with GDC -0853
As of January 2016, GDC -0853 has been administered to 179 subjec ts (i.e., 155 healthy 
subjects ,and 24 patients with hematological malignancies ,at doses ranging from 0.5 to 
600mg, and has been well tolerated with no safety signals.  In the single -ascending 
dose (SAD; GP29318), multiple -ascending dose (MAD; GA29347), ongoing relative 
bioavailability (GP29832), and oncology (GO29089) studies, GDC- 0853 was generally 
well tolerated with adverse events being mostly non-serious, mild, and self -limited and 
with no dose -limiting adverse events (DLAEs) or dose- limiting toxicit ies.  
In healthy volunteer studies, there were no DLAEs, serious adverse events, study drug 
discontinuations for adverse events, or concerning patterns of adverse events that would 
preclude further development of GDC -0853.  Adverse events in healthy volun teers were 
all mild and included skin reactions (rash, contact dermatitis, andskin irritation from 
electrocardiogram [ECG] leads; 1 subject each), nausea (2 subjects), headache, 
toothache, contusion, and asymptomatic bacteriuria (1 subject each). 
In pat ients with hematological malignancies, the majority of adverse events were 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI 
CTCAE) Grade 1 or Grade 2 and included fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, headache, 
abdominal pain, dizziness, cough, and thrombocytopenia.  There were nine serious 
adverse events reported in 5 patients: abdominal pain, lung infiltration, lung infection 
and pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage and upper GI 
hemorrhage, and H1N1 influenza andinfluenza pneumonia.  There were two deaths 
during the study due to complications of confirmed influenza (H1N1 influenza and 
influenza pneumonia). As of March 2016, 7 patients remain on GDC -0853 (400 mg QD)

1.3 STUDY RA TIONA LE A ND BENEFIT -RISK A SSESSMENT
The resul ts from the Phase I studies, nonclinical toxicology studies, and studies in a 
nonclinical model of SLE support further evaluation of GDC -0853 as a potential 
treatment for SLE.  The goal of this Phase II study (GA30044) i
s to evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of GDC -0853 in combination with standard of care (SO C; see Section 2) in 
patients with moderate to severe SLE.  The study will test two dose levels of GDC -0853 
in comparison to placebo when added to background SOC.  The study is powered to 
detect a meaningful clinical benefit, in a composite measure of disease activity across 
multiple organ systems (see Section 3.3.6.2 ), and includes multiple safety assessments 
and monitoring by an unblinded Internal Monitoring Committee (IMC) and a Scientific 
Oversight Committee . 
Inhibition o f BTK offers a promising mechanism for the treatment of autoimmune 
diseases, such as RA and SLE ( Section 1.2.1 );however, data from clinical studies are 
lacking.  Humans with a mutation in the XLA gene and who, therefore, lack functional 
BTK from birth , can live relatively normal lives on a standard therapy of IV Ig ( Kaveri et 
al. 2011 ), suggesting that BTK can be safely inhibited, especially in people with 
established immune systems.  GDC -0853 did not deplete IgG substantially during short 
term treatment of healthy subjects in Phase I studies ( see GDC -0853 Investigator’s 
Brochure ), but it is not known whether longer term treatment of patients will induce 
depletion, therefore IgG levels will be monitored in this study.  Clinical data to date 
sugg est that IgG levels in patients with an established immune system may not be 
significantly depleted, perhaps because BTK inhibitors target only the kinase domain 
and other BTK activities remain intact ( Byrd et al. 2013 ). 
Overall, GDC -0853 has been well tolerated in Phase I hea lthy subjects and oncology 
studies.  Based on the compelling mechanism for BTK inhibition in SLE and the 
promising results in NZB/NZ W lupus -prone mice, the risk -benefit ratio for this study is 
considered appropriate (see the GDC -0853 Investigator’s Brochur e).  The safety profile 
of GDC -0853 will be further characterized in this Phas e II study, and a robust 
safety-monitoring plan that describes the potential risks for GDC -0853 and the 
risk-mitigation strategies to minimize risks for the patients in this tria l is provided in 
Section 5.1.  
Clinical experience with GDC -0853 to date has not generated safety concerns that 
would preclude further evaluation in patients with autoimmune diseases (see the 
GDC- 0853 Investigator’s Brochure ).  
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
38/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3monitorable by changes in plasma transaminases and bilirubin that occurred at 
doses lower than those producing histopathology findings .No adverse live r findings 
were observed in the chronic toxicity studies in rats ( 104 Mhr) and dogs 
(36Mhr).See Section 4 of the GDC -0853 Investigator’s Brochure for further 
details .
Fetal malformations were observed in rats (i.e., cleft palate observed at 627 Mhr) 
and rabbits (i.e., domed -shaped heads with enlarged lateral/third ventricles at 
10.6Mhr).  Thus, highly effective contraception will be mandatory for trial 
participation, and pregnancy monitoring will be performed at least monthly in 
Study GA30044.
Pancreatic findings observed in rats administered GDC -0853, and other BTK 
inhibitors, were considered t o be an on- target, species -specific effect, supported by 
a number of investigative studies (see the GDC -0853 Investigator’s Brochure for 
details).  
1.3.2 Potential Risks for Clinical Toxicities
GDC- 0853 is in early clinical development and there is limited saf ety experience, so the 
actual risks in patients with SLE are unknown.  However, there are several potential 
risks on the basis of the expected mechanism of action of GDC -0853, published 
literature for similar molecules, nonclinical and clinical studies. Several measures will be 
taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study based on these potential 
risks (see Section 5.1for details).  In addition, guidelines for the management of study 
treatment in patients who experience specific adve rse events ha vebeen established 
(see Section 5.1.2 and Table 4).  Eligibility criteria in this study have been designed to 
exclude patients at higher risk for potential toxicities (see Section 4.1).  
1.3.2.1 Infections
GDC- 0853 is a targeted immunomodulator and the degree to which GDC -0853 
antagonism of BTK signaling may suppress immune activity is unknown.  Patients 
participating in this study may be at risk for infections, including opportunistic infections.  
Therefore, the eligibility criteria are intended to protect patient safety and exclude 
patients that may be at a particularly increased risk of infection including those with 
marked baseline lymphopenia.  Total Ig concentrations will also be measured regularly 
throughout the study.  During the study, any se rious infection, any infection requiring IV 
antimicrobials, or any opportunistic infection is considered an adverse event of special 
interest (AESI) with expedited reporting requirements to the Sponsor.
1.3.2.2 Vaccinations
The effect of GDC -0853 upon the efficacy of vaccinations is unknown.  It is 
recommended that appropriate vaccinations per European League Against Rheumatism 
(EULAR) recommendations ( vanAssen et al. 2010 ) or local guidelines be up to date 
before study participation.   Howe ver,as a safety measure ,patients will be excluded from 
study participation and will not be dosed with GDC -0853 if they have been vaccinated 
with live, attenuated vaccines (e.g., the intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccines, 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
39/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3Bacillus Calmette -Guérin virus [BCG], and varicella ) within 6 weeks before planned 
dosing.  
1.3.2.3 Bleeding
BTK is expressed in platelets and is involved in platelet function via GPVI/Collagen 
receptor signaling and GP1b receptor signaling.  Platelets from patients with XLA 
demonstrate decreased activation in response to submaximal collagen stimulation but 
normal response to thrombin.  However, clinically, there is no reported bleeding 
propensity in XLA patients ( Howard et al. 2006 ).  In the GDC -0853 clinical study 
involving patients with cancer, two patients experienced Grade 3 GI bleeding.  These 
events were not dose related and occurred in patients on NSAIDs/acetylsalicylic acid 
with a history of gastroesophageal or peptic ulcer disease.
It is unknown if GDC -0853 will increase the risk of bleeding in SLE patients receiving 
antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies.   Therefore, the e ligibility criteria will exclude 
patients at highest risk for GI bleeding.  P atients at high risk for NSAID -related GI injury 
are advised to follow local or recognized guidelines, including concomitant use of proton 
pump inhibitors (PPIs), if indicated.  Any bleeding event of Grade 2 or above is 
considered an AESI with expedited reporting r equirements to the Sponsor (s ee 
Section 5.4.2 ).
1.3.2.4 Cytopenias
Neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia have been observed in patients with 
hematologi c malignancies who received GDC- 0853.  Events have been monitorable and 
clinically manageable without dose discontinuations.  As patients with SLE may have 
cytopenias as a result of their intrinsic SLE disease activity, study eligibility criteria are 
designed to exclude those patients with more marked baseline cytopenias that may 
affect patient safety, and complete blood counts (CBCs) will b e monitored regularly 
throughout the study.
1.3.2.5 Gastrointestinal Effects
Healthy subjects in the multiple ascending -dose study, GA29347, reported events of 
mild self -limited nausea.  In addition, Grade 1 diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain 
have been reported in patients with hematological malignancies treated with GDC -0853; 
however, the events resolved and have not led to study drug discontinuation.  
Throughout the study, patients will be monitored for GI side effects.  
1.3.2.6 Hepatotoxicity
Evidence of hepatobiliary injury was observed in animals administered relatively high 
doses of GDC -0853 in repeat -dose toxicity studies.  In clinical studies to date, including 
single dose and multiple dosing for 14 days in healthy subjects and daily dosing for over 
1year in patients with hematological malignancies, there have been no adverse event s 
of liver enzyme elevations or trends towards elevations in laboratory evaluations.  For 
inclusion in this study, AST and ALT levels should be no more than 1.5 times the upper 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
40/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3limit of normal (ULN) ,and total bilirubin levels should be normal at screening.   Baseline 
and routine evaluations of AST/ALT and total bilirubin levels will be performed 
throughout the study.  Elevated AST or ALT levels of Grade 3 (5ULN) or cases of 
potential drug- induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST level in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin level or clinical jaundice, as defined by Hy’s 
law ( see Section 5.3.5.6), are AESIs with expedited reporting requirements to the 
Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ).  
1.3.2.7 Cardiovascular Effects
GDC- 0853 is considered to have a low potential to cause QT interval prolongation or to 
directly affect other cardiovascular parameters at therapeutic exposures.  Aminimal 
increase in corrected QT (QTc; 7 ms ecor 3%) interval was noted at 45 mg/kg in the 
single -dose cardiovascular safety pharmacology study in telemetry -instrumented dogs 
that was not considered to be clinically significant/meaningful.  Analysis of ECG data 
from the SAD and MAD studies in healthy subjects did not demonstrate any significant 
increase in either QRS interval or QTcF intervals.   Cardiac safety will be evaluated in all 
patients at baseline and throughout the study with routine monitoring of vital signs, 
including heart rate and blood pressure, collection of ECGs, and reporting of cardiac 
adverse event s.  Patients with high cardiovascular risk will be excluded from study 
participation.
1.3.2.8 Vascular Inflammation
The risk to human safety based on toxicological findings of vascular inflammation in 
animal studies is uncertain.  As a safety risk -mitigation measure, CBC results, creatinine 
levels, and urinalysis findings will be moni tored in all patients during the study.  Any 
patient that develops treatment -emergent vasculitis should be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor.
1.3.2.9 Malignancy
The impact of BTK inhibition on the development of malignancies is not known; however, 
malignancies ar e considered a potential concern for all immunomodulatory agents.  
Patients with a history of cancer within 10 years of screening will be excluded from study 
participation, except for basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has been 
excised and i s considered cured and in situ carcinoma of the cervix treated with 
apparent success by curative therapy more than 1 year prior to screening.  All 
malignancies are AESIs with expedited reporting requirements to the Sponsor.  
2. OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINT S
This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of GDC -0853
compared with placebo in patients with moderately to severely active SLE.  Specific 
objectives and corresponding endpoints for the study are outlined in Table 1 .
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
44/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3The study will consist of a screening period (up to 35days) and a 48 -week treatment 
period, followed by either an 8 -week safety follow -up visit at Week56 or possibl e
enrollment into an open -label extension (OLE) study.  Approximately 240 patients, 
meeting all eligibility criteria, will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive GDC -0853 at 
one of two doses (200 mg BID [Arm A] or 150 mg QD [Arm B]) or placebo (Arm C), in 
combination with background SOC therapy.  Randomization will be stratified by disease 
activity at screening, entry dose of oral corticosteroids ( OCS) , and geographic region.
All patients will receive blinded study drug twice daily (GDC- 0853, placebo, or both to 
maintain the blind )from baseline to Week48 and will be assessed at site visits every 
4weeks ( including a site -initiated phone call at Week 1) during the treatment period (see
Figure 1).  
Pre-enrollment adjudication by the Medical Monitor and his/her designees will occur for 
all patients who complete screening prior to their randomization into the study ( see
Appendix 3).  The Medical Monitor or assigned designee will make the final decision 
whether or not a patient is eligible for randomization.  
Background SOC therapy may consist of an OCS (which must be stable for 2 weeks 
prior to screening, dose not to exceed 40 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) and/or 
certain oral immunosuppression regimens (which m ust be stable for 2 months prior to 
screening; see Section 4.1.1 ).All immunosuppressive and anti -malarial medication will 
be kept stable throughout the trial unless dose reductions are necessary due to toxicity.
All patients receiving immunosuppressive treatments are also encouraged to be on 
supportive therapy (e.g., folic acid, calcium, vitamin D). For p atients who are on 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)
atstudy entry , doses of ACE inhibitors or AR Bs should be kept stable for at least 
10days prior to randomization and throughout the trial whenever possible .  It is strongly 
recommended that ACE inhibitors or ARBs not be initiated during the OCS stability 
windows.
For patients on an OCS at baseline, there will be two,12-week ,OCS taper windows
available to achieve the pre -specified OCS taper of 10 mg/day prednisone or 
equivalent (see Appendix 4andFigure 1).  The dose at the end of each OCS -stability 
window (i.e., the 12 -week peri od immediately following the 12 -week OCS taper window) 
will then be kept stable for an additional 12 weeks.  See Section 4.3.2.3 for more details.  
In the case of increased SLE disease activity, there canbe two temporary increase sin 
the corticosteroid dose, called “burst s,” that may be administered if needed ( Figure 1).  A 
burst may only be administered during a burst window (defined as the first 10 weeks of 
each OCS taper window) and only once per window (see Section 4.3.2.3.3 ).A burst is 
defined as a temporary increase in corticosteroid dose (up to 40 mg/d prednisone or 
equivalent for Burst W indow 1, and up to 20 mg/d prednisone or equivalent for Burst 
Window 2) with a taper back down to the dose immediately preceding the bu rst, all 
within a 2 -week period.  
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
45/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3If additional treatment is needed beyond the permitted burst therapy because of active 
SLE, as identified by the investigator, the patient may receive escape therapy; however, 
such patients will be considered trial-defined non -responder sfor the purposes of the 
primary analysis (see Section 4.3.2.3.4 ).
During taper, burst, and permitted escape therapies, patients will continue to receive 
their designated dose of study treatment (see Section 4.3.2 ).
Starting at the screening period, all patients must record their actual OCS use weekly, as 
instructed by study staff (see Section 4.3.2.4 ).
An unblinded IMC and Scientific Oversight Committee will be used to monitor multiple 
safety assessments (see Section 3.1.2 ).  In addition, a n interim analysis will be 
conducted after 5080 patients in each treatment armhave completed 24 weeks of 
treatment and have been evaluated for SLE Responder Index (SRI)-4 response , in order
to conduct a preliminary assessment of the benefit -risk profile of GDC -0853 and 
potentially enable early stopping for futility and/or safety issues (see Figure 1and 
Section 6.8for details).
The study schema is displayed in Figure 1, and a schedule of activities is provided in 
Appendix 1.

3.1.2 Internal  Monitoring Committee and Scientific Oversight 
Committee  
Regular safety reviews and the interim analysis  will be performed by the Sponsor’s IMC.  
This committee will be unblinded to treatment assignments and will include a clinical 
scientist, in conjunction with a safety scientist, biostatistician, and statistical programmer 
from the Sponsor who are not members of the study management team.  The IMC members will not have direct contact with investigational staff or site monitors.  The IMC may request that additional Sponsor scientists (e.g., clinical pharmacology, biomarker) participate in data analysis.  The IMC members will also be part of a companion Scientific Oversight Committee.  This committee will review safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD)  data and make recommendations to the Sponsor regarding 
continuation of the study and/or study drug dose modifications.  For further information, please see the Internal Monitoring Committee Charter. 
The Scientific Oversight Committee will be unblinded to treatment assignments and will 
include the IMC members and at least two external SLE experts who are not 
investigators in this study.  The Scientific Oversight Committee will meet periodically to review the study data.   

GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
47/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3After each meeting, either the IMC or Scientific Oversight Committee will recommend 
that the Sponsor proceed with one of the four f ollowing actions:  1) continue the study 
unchanged, 2) discontinue the study for safety reasons, 3) discontinue the study for 
futility (at the interim analysis), or 4) amend the study protocol.  For further information, 
please see the IMC and Scientific Ov ersight Committee Charter.  
3.2 END OF STUDY AND LENGTH OF STUDY
3.2.1 Length of Study
The maximum length of time on study for a patient is 61weeks, including screening for 
up to 35days, treatment for 48 weeks, and a safety follow -up period for 8 weeks (unless 
enrolled into an OLE study ).  
3.2.2 End of Study
The end of study is defined as the last patient, last safety follow -up visit in this protocol, 
last patient to discontinue from the study, or the last patient enrolled into an OLE, 
whichever occurs latest.
3.3 RATIONA LE FOR STUDY DESIGN
3.3.1 Rationale for GDC- 0853 Dose and Schedule
The proposed GDC -0853 doses of 150 mg QD and 200 mg BID for 48 weeks are 
expected to be well tolerated and to demonstrate BTK inhibition on the basis of the 
available safety, PK, a nd PD results from Phase I studies, nonclinical toxicology studies, 
and studies in nonclinical inflammatory models. 
These doses are expected to achieve exposures (i.e., area under the concentration time 
curve [AUC] and C max) below those achieved at the hi ghest doses evaluated in the 
Phase I SAD and MAD studies (GP29318 and GA29347, respectively) and 5 -fold below 
the exposures at the NOAEL of the nonclinical chronic toxicity studies (see the 
GDC- 0853 Investigator’s Brochure).  In healthy subjects, doses up to 600 mg in Study 
GP29318 and 250 mg BID and 500 mg QD in Study GA29347 were well tolerated; all 
adverse event s were Grade 1 (mild) and transient, there were no DLAEs, and no 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was identified.  
Dose -dependent BTK inhibition was demonstrated in the Phase I SAD and MAD studies 
(GP29318 and GA29347, respectively) through use of PD biomarker assays (e.g., CD63 
expression in basophils, phosphorylated -BTK inhibition).  PK and PD data from these 
studies were used to model the relations hip between GDC -0853 systemic exposures 
and BTK -dependent biomarker inhibition.

GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
48/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3  
 
  
The efficacy of GDC -0853, as well as GDC -0834 (Liuetal.2011) and G -744 ( related 
small -molecule BTK inhibitors used to demonstrate the effect of BTK inhibition in 
nonclinical studies), was evaluated in nonclinical inflammatory models of arthritis and 
immune complex mediated renal injury ( see Liuetal.2011 for GDC -0834, and the 
GDC- 0853 Investigator’s Brochure for GDC -0853 and G -744), in which disease 
manifestations are similar to those of human SLE.  In female Lewis rats with developing 
Type II CIA, GDC ‑0853 treatment was well tolerated and resulted in significant and 
beneficial dose
-dependent effects on ankle swelling .  Doses 0.25 mg/kg/day of 
GDC- 0853 significantly reduced serum levels of anti -rat collagen II IgG, whereas total 
anti-rat IgG antibody serum levels did not change.  The histopathology findings were 
consistent with the clinical findings.  Studies in NZB/NZW  lupus -prone mice with G -744 
have shown that BTK inhibition resulted in dose -dependent improvement in survival (see 
GDC- 0853 Investigator’s Brochure).
These nonclinical studies suggest that 70% BTK inhibition, as measured by 
phosphorylated -BTK inhibition, is required for half -maximal activity in disease models 
(see the GDC -0853 Inve stigator’s Brochure; Liuetal.2011 ).   
 
 however, whether BTK inhibition in the rat CIA 
or the mouse SLE model accurately predicts efficacy in human SLE is currently unknown.
The Sponsor believes that the existing clinical and nonclinical data support the proposed 
GDC- 0853 doses of 150 mg QD and 200 mg BID for 48 weeks.  In addition, the Sponsor 
believes that these doses will enable robust characterization of exposure -response 
relationships across a wide range of exposures because of inter -individual PK variability.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.3.2 Rationale for Patient Population
A substantial number of SLE patients fail to achieve an adequate response on the 
current SOC therapy and often the patients experien ce flares despite their current 

GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
49/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3treatment and medical compliance.  Furthermore, the mainstay of therapy for SLE is 
systemic corticosteroids, which can lead to significant morbidities.  Given the limitations 
with the current therapeutic options for SLE, the re remains a need for therapies that 
provide a higher degree of both safety and efficacy.  
BTK inhibition should target several pathways and cell types central to SLE 
pathogenesis.  B -cell activation and differentiation into plasma cells is central to the
development of pathogenic autoantibodies (see the GDC -0853 Investigator’s Brochure 
for details).  BTK activity is central to B -cell activation and autoantibody production.  In 
addition, autoantigen- containing immune complexes are bound to Fc receptors on 
myeloid cells and their activation can lead to both inflammatory cytokine production as 
well as the presentation of additional autoantigens.  These processes can lead to a cycle 
of tissue injury, inflammation, and new autoantibody production.  BTK inhibiti on of both 
Bcells and myeloid cells may contribute to efficacy ( Chang et al. 2011 ; diPaolo et al. 
2011 ).  In addition, the reversible inhibition of BTK by GDC -0853 may allow for more 
rapid removal of suppression if infection occurs.  
This Pha se II study will evaluate patients with unmet need due to active SLE despite 
being treated with SOC, including corticosteroids and/or concomitant 
immunosuppression.  Eligibility criteria for this study are similar to other Phase II 
proof -of-concept SLE stu dies and have been customized in some cases for patient 
safety (see Section 4.1). 
3.3.3 Rationale for Control Group
All patients in this study will receive SOC therapy for SLE.  Arm C is treated with placebo 
in combination with SOC in order to maintain the blin d.  It is not known whether 
GDC- 0853 will be better or worse than placebo in combination with SOC. 
The placebo- treated control group in Arm C is required for this study to achieve the 
safety and efficacy objectives.  Historical control groups are not sufficiently comparable 
given changes in SLE populations and treatment patterns over time and around the 
world.  Furthermore, refinements in study conduct, inherent variability in the subjective 
assessments and regional differences in the management of SLE patients require a 
placebo -treated control group to accurately determine the safety and efficacy of 
GDC- 0853 relative to current SOCs.  The study treatment period, including the 
placebo -treatment period, will be 48 weeks, which has been the time necessary to 
establish the peak -level efficacy of SLE therapeutics, based on prior SLE studies.  
Multiple recent Phase II and Phase III studies incorporate 48 -week placebo -comparator 
groups (Furie et al. 2017 ; Khamashta et al. 2016 ; Navarra et al. 2011 ).  If placebo patients 
have increased SLE disease activity, burst therapy, escape therapy, or both will be 
available (see Section 4.3.2.3.3 and Section 4.3.2.3.4 for details).
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
50/Protocol GA30044 , Version 33.3.4 Rationale for Biomarker A ssessments
Diagnostic b iomarker assessments aim to identify a biomarker that predicts response to 
GDC0853, which would be valuable to patients and treating physicians as an aid in 
identifying patients with increased likelihood to achieve clinical benefit, thus guiding 
treatment decisions.  In addition, a t various tim epoints after treatment, 
pharmacodynamic biomarker samples will be collected and used to advance the 
understanding of the mechanism of action of GDC -0853 and define PK/PD relationships 
in SLE patients aiding in dose evaluation in this study as well as dose- regimen selection 
for future studies (see Appendix 2).  
3.3.5 Rationale for PK Sample Collection Schedule
PK results will be used to perform robust exposure -response and exposure -safety 
analyses, which will help to characterize how safety and efficacy are impacted by drug 
exposure and, thus, inform appropriate doses and regimens for future studies of 
GDC- 0853.  The PK sampling schedule is designed to capture data at several points 
during the study in order to enable the estimation of systemic GDC -0853 exposures and
subsequent exposure -response evaluations and dose -regimen selection for future 
studies (see Appendix 2), which may be reported separately .  
3.3.6 Rationale for Other Study Design Elements
3.3.6.1 Pre-Enrollment A djudication
Enrollment into this trial is subject to adjudication by the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or 
medically qualified designee.  The objective of the adjudication process is to ensure that 
eligibility is based on objectively ascertained, well -documented, and clini cally important 
disease activity.  The scope and detailed procedures for the adjudication process are 
described in Appendix 3.
3.3.6.2 Efficacy  Measurements
The primary efficacy endpoint in this study is a composite of the Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus Responder In dex (SRI) -4 at Week 48(seeTable 1 ).  The SRI -4 
response criterion is commonly used in SLE studies, is accepted by health authorities to 
measure reduction in SLE disease activity, and it is a composite measure that includes 
the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI -2K), British Isles Lupus Activity Group (BILAG) 
2004, and Physician Global Assessment.  SRI responses have been detect edat 
timepoints as early as 12 weeks in prior clinical trials ; however, therapeutic benefit is 
often measured at 24 weeks with maximal benefit seen as late as 48 -52 weeks post -
treatment intervention ( Burgess and McCormack 2011 ;Furie et al. 2017 ; Khamashta et al. 
2016 ; Navarra et al. 2011 ).  SRI -4 alone is the primary efficacy endpoint. Achievement 
of a low, stable, corticosteroid dose has been added to the SRI -4 in the secondary 
endpoint in order to minimize the confounding effect of corticosteroids, includ ing inflation 
of the response rates in the comparator arm that can obscure detection of an efficacy 
signal .The BILAG -based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) and the SRI -6 are also 
secondary endpoints as they provide a meaningful metric of SLE disease ac tivity.
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
51/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3In addition to the primary and secondary SRI endpoints, SRI 5, 7, and8 are exploratory 
efficacy endpoints.  Furthermore, several other clinically meaningful and exploratory 
aspects of SLE disease activity will be evaluated, using the Cutaneous Lup us 
Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI), SLICC/ACR Damage Index,
Physician Global Assessment, SELENA -SLEDAI Flare Index (SFI), 28 -joint count, and 
patient -reported outcome (PRO) measures (i.e., Functional Assessment of Chronic 
Illness Therapy [FACIT] -Fatigue and Patient Global Assessment).  Each of these 
measures has been well established and validated in previous studies.  
3.3.6.3 Corticosteroid Taper
There is a substantial unmet need for effective corticosteroid -sparing treatments for SLE 
and this study will assess the corticosteroid sparing potential of GDC -0853.  Chronic 
corticosteroid use has many adverse short -and long -term consequences, so reducing 
corticosteroid doses in patients with SLE will decrease the incidence of short -and 
long-term co -morbidities and potential adverse event s, including in patients in this trial. 
The Glucocorticoid Toxicity Change Index ( GTCI) will be used to determine the potential 
of GDC -0853 to reduce steroid -induced systemic side effects (see Appendix 12).  In 
addition, the unrestricted use of corticosteroids in SLE clinical trials can confound safety 
and efficacy measurements and decrease the ability to detect the biologic 
activity/efficacy of the experimental drug ( Reddy et al. 2013 ).  Thus, to best determine 
the safety and efficacy of GDC -0853, corticosteroids should be tapered according to a 
suggested taper schedule, as tolerated (see Appendix 4).  Furthermore, if a patient 
requires a corticosteroid burst during the Burst Windows, corticosteroids should be 
tapered back down to baseline (either the Day 1 dose or lowest stable dose the patient 
achieves) using the suggested taper schedule.  Study patients with disease activity that 
precludes tapering corticosteroid to the target level w ill be considered trial defined 
non-responders for the analysis of secondary and exploratory endpoints that incorporate 
the requirement for OCS tapering .
3.3.6.4 Clinical Outcomes Assessments
PROand clinician -reported outcome data will be collected to more fully characterize the 
clinical profile of GDC -0853.  To minimize the confounding of PRO assessments that 
evaluate pain, any potentially painful procedures (e.g., blood draws) should be 
performed after the pain assessment.  
3.3.6.5 Stratification
Randomization will be stratified by disease activity based on the SLEDAI -2Kscore, entry 
dose of OCS, and geographic region obtained at screening.
Levels of baseline disease activity (SLEDAI -2K score) and corticosteroid use as well as 
geographic region independently impact a patient’s ability to achieve response on the 
primary efficacy endpoint.  Specifically, a reduction of 4points in the SLEDAI -2Kmust 
be achieved to be classified as a responder.  In addition, use of corticosteroids in SLE 
clinical trials can confound efficacy measurements and decrease the ability to detect the 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
52/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3biologic activity/efficacy of the experimental drug.  For this reason ,it is important to 
prevent treatment imbalan ces in these factors at baseline and thus randomization will be 
stratified by both SLEDAI -2Kscore ( 10 or 10) and baseline corticosteroid use.  
Geographic region was chosen as the third strata, because regional variations in the 
management of SLE can m anifest as variability in response rates, including differences 
in placebo rates ( Kalunian et al. 2016 ; Khamashta et al. 2016 ).  The stratification is 
intended to balance the proportion of patients from different regions across the study 
arms in order to limit any confounding of the study results. 
3.3.6.6 Concomitant Medication Rationale
Patients in this study will continue on their bac kground SOC therapy in order to ensure 
that all patients receive effective therapy for SLE. GDC- 0853 or placebo will be added to 
determine if GDC -0853 improves clinical response and/or reduces the need for systemic 
steroids in combination with SOC.  The e ligibility criteria exclude patients on certain SLE 
therapies in order to reduce the risk of participation in this study.  Concomitant SLE 
therapies other than OCS will not be changed during the study (except in the event of 
toxicity), in order to reduce c onfounding effects on the safety and efficacy results of the 
study.  OCS doses may be changed during certain time windows to minimize toxicity or 
for short -term treatment of increased SLE disease activity (see Section 4.3.2.3.3 ).  
For guidance on concomit ant medications that are unrelated to background SOC
therapy, please refer to Section 4.4.

–The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post -ovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.
For men:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or 
use contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm as 
defined below.  Please also see Appendix 8for details:
–Men with female partners of childbearing potential must remain abstinent or 
use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a 
failure rate of 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 
120 days (16 weeks) after the last dose of study treatment.  Men must refrain 
from donating sperm during this same period.
–Men with pregnant female partners must remain abstinent or use a condom 
during the treatment period and for at least 28 days after the last dose of study 
treatment to avoid exposing the embryo.
–The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post -ovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

will be made by the adjudicati on committee and Medical Monitor .
4.2 METHOD OF TREA TMENT ASSIGNMENT A ND BLIND ING 
The Sponsor will define the randomization algorithm for implementation by the IxRS 
vendor.  Randomization will be stratified by region, entry dose of OCS , and disease 
activity at screening.  
To minimize bias in safety and efficacy assessments, this study uses a blinded, 
matching placebo for GDC -0853.  
To maintain the blind, after screening, sites will not receive data related to selected 
laboratory parameters, including but n ot limited immunophenotyping .
PK samples will be collected from patients assigned to all arms in order to maintain the 
blinding of the treatment assignments.  Since PK assay results for patients in the 
placebo arm are generally not needed for the safe conduct or proper interpretation of 
this trial, samples from patients assigned to the placebo arm will not be analyzed except 
by request (e.g., to evaluate a possible error in dosing).  Sponsor personnel responsible 
for performing PK assays and PK/PD assessmen ts, which may include contracted 
laboratory personnel, will be unblinded to patients’ treatment assignment to identify 
appropriate samples to be analyzed.
Additional Sponsor staff will be unblinded to patients’ treatment assignments in order to 
support the IMC and Scientific Oversight Committee , including a clinician, statistician, 
statistical programming analyst, biomarker scientist, clinical pharmacologist, and others 
at the request of the IMC.  Certain Sponsor representatives not involved with study 
conduct or the study team (e.g., governance committee members) may review unblinded 
safety data or interim efficacy data to enable decision -making.
If unblinding is necessary for patient management (e.g., in the case of a serious adverse 
event or unanticip ated pregnancy for which patient management might be affected by 
knowledge of treatment assignment), the investigator will be able to break the treatment 
code by contacting the IxRS.  Treatment codes should not be broken except in 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
60/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3emergency situations.  If the investigator wishes to know the identity of the study drug for 
any other reasons, he or she should contact the medical monitor directly to discuss the 
rationale for unblinding and further management plan for the patient (e.g., discontinuing 
drug treat ment), prior to contacting the IxRS for unblinding.  The Medical Monitor is not 
allowed to break the blinding on the investigator’s behalf.  The investigator should 
document and provide an explanation for any premature unblinding (e.g., accidental 
unblindi ng and unblinding due to a serious adverse event), without disclosing the 
treatment assignment in the documentation.
For regulatory reporting purposes, and if required by local health authorities, the 
Sponsor will break the treatment code for all serious, unexpected suspected adverse 
reactions (SUSARs, see Section 5.7) that are considered by the investigator or Sponsor 
to be related to study drug.
4.3 STUDY TRE ATMENT 
The investigational medicinal product (IMP) for this study is GDC -0853 50 -mg tablets .
4.3.1 Formul ation, Packaging, and Handling
4.3.1.1 GDC- 0853 50 -mg Tablet and Placebo Tablet
GDC- 0853 will be provided by the Sponsor as 50 -mg dose strength tablets with 
corresponding matching placebo tablets, which will be indistinguishable in appearance.  
Tablets will be supplied in blister wallets for the treatment arm to which the patient is 
randomized.  GDC- 0853 and placebo tablets should be stored at 2 C8C.
For information on the formulation and handling of GDC- 0853, see the GDC -0853 
Investigator’s Brochure.
4.3.1.2 Backgroun d Standard of Care Therapy
For information on the formulation, packaging, and handling of background SOC therapy 
(i.e., immunosuppressive therapy and corticosteroids) see the local prescribing 
information.
4.3.2 Dosage, A dministration, and Compliance
4.3.2.1 GDC- 0853 and Placebo Dose and A dministration
The GDC -0853 dose levels are 150 mg QD and 200 mg BID with matching placebo (see 
Table 2 ).  Patients will receive GDC -0853/placebo BID approximately every 12 hours 
starting on Day 1 and ending on the evening ( p.m. dose) prior to the W eek48 visit.  
Patients should be directed to take one dose (a total of 4 tablets) BID (total of 8 tablets 
each day).  On clinic visit days when PK assessments are performed (Day 1, Week 4, 
and W eek 24) ,patients should be instructed t hat study drug will be administered in the 
clinic.  
In general, a dosing window of 2 hours is acceptable. If a dose is taken more than 
2hours late or is missed altogether, the patient should resume normal dosing with the 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
61/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3next scheduled dose.   Patients should record the dose that was missed on the blister 
wallet.  Doses that are vomited will be considered missed doses.
GDC- 0853 or placebo will be orally administered and may be taken with or without food, 
except the dose of oral study drug taken at the clinic visit on Day 1and Week 24(see 
Section 4.4.4 and Appendix 1and Appendix 2),which will be administered at the clinic 
visit while fasting.  The dates and times of the most recent prior meal, last dose of oral 
study drug (prior to clinic visit), and timing of oral study drug administration in clinic 
should be recorded at clinic visits with PK and/or fasting lipid assessments .  In addition, 
any use of PPIs, H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), and/or short -acting antacids ( e.g., 
Maalox®, Pepto -Bismol®, Rolaids®)should be recorded as concomitant medications, 
including date and time of last administration prior to the PK clinic visit s.  Administration 
of study drug should be staggered with short
-acting antacid use (i.e., oral study drug 
should be taken 2 hours before or 2 hours after the short -acting antacid).  Staggering is 
not required for PPIs or H2RAs; however, PPI and H2RA medications are recommended 
to be maintained at a constant dose and regimen throughout the stud y if possible.

Note:  All patients will take 4 tablets BID (i.e., 8 tablets daily ) regardless of assigned 
GDC -0853 dose regimen in order to maintain the blind.
At study visits, sufficient study medication will be dispensed to complete dosing until the 
next scheduled visit.  W hen study medication is administered at the site, it will be 
administered under supervision of study personnel, and the amount of study medi cation 
dispensed must be recorded.  
Any overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be noted on the 
Study Drug Administration electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) .  Adverse event s 
associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.
4.3.2.2 GDC- 0853 and Placebo Compliance
The following measures will be taken to assess patient compliance with study drug: 
Sites will be responsible for prepopulating the dates on the blister wallets for when 
patients are scheduled to take study drug. Under the corresponding dates listed, the 
patients will record the times (a.m. orp.m.) that they take each dose directly on the 
blister wallet.  Patients should only remove tablets from the wallet at the time they take 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
62/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3the tablets (e.g., patients should not transfer the tablets to another container with their 
other medications for future us e).  Patients will be instructed by the site staff on how to 
properly take the study drug, including recording the IP intake time on the blister 
wallet and a reminder to bring all blister wallets (used and unused) to each study visit for 
assessment of comp liance (based on the tablets remaining in the wallets as well as the 
recorded dates andtimes) and for medication disposal.
Compliance will be documented on the source record.  If compliance is 80% (correct 
dosage at the correct time), the investigator or designee is to counsel the patient and 
ensure steps are taken to improve compliance.  
In order to maintain the proper source documentation of subjects’ IP compliance, the 
investigator should follow one of the two processes listed below:
1. The site will keep the blister wallets on- site, together with all other subject source 
documents (e.g. signed ICFs, medical notes, completed PROs, etc.). Blister wallets 
may not be destroyed until all trial related documents are approved to be discarded 
if this process is followed.
2. Site staff will generate certified copies of the blister wallets, showing IP intake 
times recorded by the subjects on the wallets .  After PI accountability is performed, 
blister packs are checked by the site monitor, and sponsor approval is ob tained, the 
blister packs may be destroyed at the site or returned for destruction. If the 
investigator chooses to follow this process, all copies of blister wallets must be 
signed and dated by the person making the copy and noted with a statement such as 
“I certify that this is the true and co rrect copy of the original.”  For this trial, only 
printed copies of bl ister wallets will be accepted.  Electronic copies are not allowed .
Any overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be noted on the Study 
Drug Administration eCRF.  Adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect 
administration of study drug should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.
4.3.2.3 Background Standard of Care Therapy
4.3.2.3.1 Immunosuppressant Therapy
All patients who enter the study on oral immunosuppressant therapy (not including 
corticosteroids) or anti -malarial medications will be instructed to maintain their 
medications and doses from screening throughout the rest of the study treatment period.  
After entering the study, patients may not begin taking anew oralimmunosuppressant 
except in the case of increased clinical acti vity requiring escape therapy , as described in 
Section 4.3.2.3.4 .
If dose reduction of an immunosuppressant is required because of toxicity, this must be 
recorded as an adverse event on the Adverse Event eCRF, and the dose modification 
must be recorded in the Immunosuppressant Review eCRF. 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
63/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3Any overdose or incorrect administration of an immunosuppressant should be noted on 
the Immunosuppressant Review eCRF.  Adverse event s associated with an overdose or 
incorrect administration of an immunosuppressant should be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.
4.3.2.3.2 Corticosteroid 
For all patients who enter the study on oral prednisone (or permitted equivalent OCS; 
see Appendix 18), there will be two,12-week, OCS taper window s(Weeks 0to 12 and 
Weeks 24 to 36) where their dose, if 10 mg/day, will be tapered to 10 mg/day.  During 
taper window s, patients will continue to receive their designated dose of study treatment 
(see Section 4.3.2 ).  
The OCS rules are as follows:  the OCS dose level achieved at the end of each OCS 
taper window will be maintained during the 12
-week, OCS stability window s(Weeks 12 
to 24 and Weeks 36to 48; see Figure 1), whether or not the target OCS dose was 
achieved.  Patients will be instructed not to deviate from this dose level achieved at t he 
end of the OCS taper window, unless considered clinically appropriate by the 
investigator.  
Patients should follow the appropriate tapering schedule as determined by the 
investigator, taking into account the taper window timing and the target OCS dose 
(10mg/day and Day1 dose).  The investigator may modify a tapering schedule 
based on the patient’s response to the reduction in corticosteroid dose.  A suggested 
prednisone tapering schedule is provided in Appendix 4; in addition, the investigator may
consult the Medical Monitor.  Once 10 mg/day is achieved, t apering completely off 
corticosteroids is allowed if this is deemed clinically appropriate by the investigator (i.e., 
if there is minimal risk of inducing flare).
Inability to comply with any of the OCS rules and any change in steroid dose must be 
recorded on the Corticosteroid Medication eCRF.  In addition, the patient will be 
considered a non- responder for the analysis that requires the steroid taper criteria to be 
satisfied ( see Section 3.3.6.3 ).   
It is recommended that all patients receiving corticosteroids should receive appropriate 
supportive therapy to help prevent steroid -induced osteoporosis (e.g., calcium, vitamin D 
supplements, bisphosphonates) as per local guidelines and physic ian preference.  
Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia prophylaxis is also recommended to be used as per 
local SOC.
Intra-articular injections and intra -lesional cutaneous injections of corticosteroids must be 
avoided during the study if possible ,as these interventions willconfound the efficacy 
assessment s.  
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
64/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3If a patient entered the study on low potency topical steroids (e.g., Class VI and 
Class VII) , the steroid can be continued during the course of the study at a stable dose. 
4.3.2.3.3 Burst Treatment
In the case of increased disease activity, the patient will have the opportunity to receive 
burst treatment, in addition to the study treatment, during the defined burst treatment 
window ( seeFigure 1).  The patient should return to the clinic, either at a scheduled 
study visit or unscheduled flare visit, to be evaluated and to receive an increase or new 
dose of oral prednisone as follows:
Burst W indow 1 ( Weeks 0to 10):  An increase or new dose of oral prednisone up to 
40mg/day (or equivalent ;see Appendix 18)
Burst W indow 2 ( Weeks24 to 34):  An increase or new dose in oral prednisone up 
to 20 mg/day (or equivalent ;see Appendix 18)
When using corticosteroids as a burst treatment, the investigator w ill temporarily 
increase the dose of corticosteroids and then taper the patient back down to their 
previous corticosteroid dose used prior to the initiation of the burst , allover the course 
of 2 weeks.   Patients will continue to receive their designated dose of study treatment 
(see Section 4.3.2 ) during the burst treatment.  The previous corticosteroid dose is 
defined as the dose of corticosteroids taken for the 2 weeks prior to the burst (if the dose 
changed during the 2 weeks, the investigator may choose which dose to use).  If the 
patient was not previously on corticosteroids, the investigator will taper the patient back 
off corticosteroids completely.  If the patient was on a corticosteroid -tapering schedule at 
the time of the burst treatment, the investigator will revise the tapering schedule as 
necessary to meet the target OCS dose ( 10mg/day and Day1 dose) by the end of 
the taper window , if clinically appropriate .  
Patients may receive corticosteroids for emergent illness other than SLE (e.g., trauma, 
asthma) or if clinically warranted to prevent adrenal crisis (e.g., prior to surgery).  If 
possible, treatment in these cases should last no more than 7 days. 
Any dose of steroid higher than the maximum burst levels above, any failure to taper the 
burst down to the previous level over the course of 2 weeks, or any necessity for 
additional burst treatments for increased SLE -related activity (either a second treatment 
within the burst window or a burst treatment outside the burst window), as determined by 
the investigator, will be recorded in the Steroid and immunosuppressant eCRF.  
Use of burst therapy to treat worsening of lupus will be captured on the Adverse Event 
eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.9).  If any patient needs additional corticosteroids for any 
reason that falls outside the permitted OCS rules stated above (Sections 4.3.2.3.2 and 
4.3.2.3.3) , the Medical Monitor needs to be informed and the reason recorded on the 
Corticosteroid Medication eCRF.   
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
65/Protocol GA30044 , Version 34.3.2.3.4 Escape Therapy
If an increase in immunosuppressive therapy (referred to as “escape therapy ”)is 
deemed medically necessary due to increased SLE disease activity, the patient will be 
given escape therapy, which will be recorded on the Steroid and Immunosuppressant 
eCRF.  Patients receiving the following escape therapies may be allowed to remain on 
study drug after discussion with the Medical Monitor but will be consider ed a 
protocol -defined “non -responder” in the primary analysis:  
IVor IM steroids (at doses greater than 40 mg prednisone PO or equivalent)
OCS doses exceeding the limits described elsewhere in the protocol (e.g., 
prednisone (or equivalent) doses of > 40 mg/day during the first 24 weeks of the 
study, or > 20 mg/day between Weeks 24 and 48) 
New or increased doses of an immunosuppressant or anti -malarial medication up 
to the maximum allowed in the study (see Section 4.3.2.3 )
NOTE: Combination s of immunosuppressant medications that are not allowed in the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Section 4.1) are prohibited during the study (see
Section 4.6.2 ).
Whenever possible, a patient being evaluated for escape therapy will undergo 
assessment at ei ther an unscheduled or flare visit prior to the increase in 
immunosuppression in order to quantify and record the increased disease activity, 
unless this occurs at a scheduled study visit (see Appendix 1).  
If the patient requires any further treatment fo r SLE activity beyond the escape therapy 
described above (e.g., prohibited medications as defined in Section 4.4.2 or any 
accepted immunosuppressive that exceeds the maximum dose as defined by the 
protocol, or any increase in therapy not approved by the Me dical Monitor ), the patient 
should stay  in the study but will be discontinued from study treatment (see Section 4.6.2 ).  
Use of escape therapy to treat worsening of lupus will be captured on the Adverse Event 
eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.9).  If any patient needs additional corticosteroids for this or 
any other reason, the Medical Monitor needs to be informed and the reason recorded on 
the Corticosteroid Medication eCRF.  
4.3.2.4 Background Standard of Care Therapy  Compliance
Starting at the screening period, all patients must keep a weekly diary of their actual 
OCS use as instructed by study staff.  Patients will record their actual OCS dose on a 
weekly basis using a paper diary and as instructed by study staff .  OCS usage will be 
recorded in the Corticosteroid Medication eCRF.
4.3.3 Investigational Medicinal Product A ccountability
All IMPs required for completion of this study (GDC -0853 50- mg tablet and placebo 
tablet) will be provided by the Sponsor where required by local health authority 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
66/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3regulations.  The study site will acknowledge receipt of IMPs using the IxRS to confirm 
the shipment condition and content.  Any damaged shipments will be replaced. 
IMPs either will be disposed of at the study site according to the study site’s institutio nal 
standard operating procedure or will be returned to the Sponsor with the appropriate 
documentation.  The site’s method of IMP destruction must be agreed to by the Sponsor.  
The site must obtain written authorization from the Sponsor before any IMP is destroyed, 
and IMP destruction must be documented on the appropriate form.
Accurate records of all IMPs received at, dispensed from, returned to, and disposed of 
by the study site should be recorded on the Drug Inventory Log.
4.3.4 Post -Trial A ccess to GDC- 0853
Patients may be screened for enrollment in toan OLE study . If they meet all OLE 
eligibility criteria, they may be enrolled if considered appropriate for participation , 
according to the investigator.
Currently, the Sponsor (Genentech, a member of the Roche Group) does not have any 
plans to provide GDC -0853 or any other study treatments or interventions to patients 
who have completed the study and are not qualified or elect not to enter an OLE study , if 
available , in accordance with the Roche Global Policy on Continued Access to 
Investigational Medicinal Product, available at the following W eb site:

4.4 CONCOMITA NT THERA PY,PROHIBITED FOOD, A ND
ADDITIONA L RESTRICTI ONS
Concomitant therap
y includes any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter 
drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a 
patient from 7 days prior to initiation of study drug through 8 weeks after the last dose of 
study dru g or entrance into an OLE, if initiated , whichever occurs first. All concomitant 
medication taken during the study must be documented on the eCRF along with 
indication, daily dose, and start and stop dates of administration.  Adverse event s related 
to the administration of a concomitant medication or the performance of a procedure 
must also be documented on the appropriate adverse event page of the eCRF.
It is recommended that patients avoid changing other concomitant prescription or non-
prescription drugs , vitamins, and dietary supplements within 7 days or 5 half -lives, 
whichever is longer, prior to the first dose of study medication and throughout the study.
4.4.1 Permitted Therapy  
Note for all concomitant immunosuppressive and anti- malarial medications:  reductions 
to the concomitant immunosuppressive medication dose will not be allowed except in the 
case of intolerance or toxicity or for the safety of the patient, as determined by the 
investigator; any changes in the doses of concomitant immunosuppressive and anti -
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
67/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3malarial medications must be discussed in advance with the Medical Monitor unless 
medically emergent.  Patients who require a new or increased dose of concomitant 
immunosu ppressive medications will be considered protocol -defined non -responders 
(see Section 4.3.2.3). 
Addition, discontinuation, and dose adjustment of concomitant medications for 
conditions other than SLE are discouraged but permitted when required for the saf e and 
effective treatment of patients. 
Any case of medication intolerance or toxicity must be recorded as an adverse event
and any dose modification recorded in the eCRF.  
Certain combinations of the SLE therapies below are not permitted (see Section 4.1)
4.4.1.1 Anti-malarials ( E.g., Hydroxychloroquine, Chloroquine)
Patients taking anti -malarial medications at study entry should be on a stable dose for at 
least 8 weeks prior to screening and should maintain a constant dosage throughout the 
study.  Patients not previously on anti -malarial medications may be enrolled in the study 
but should not initiate anti -malarial medications during the course of the blinded study.  
Replacement of one anti -malarial with another may be allowed in case swhere there is 
limited supply of the original medication , or if there are issues with toxicity or intolerance ; 
however, the change must be discussed with the Medical Monitor.  Refer to Appendix 18
for anti -malarial list.
4.4.1.2 Mycophenolate Mofetil /Mycophenolic A cid
All patients who are taking mycophenolate mofetil (or mycophenolic acid ) should be on a 
stable dose for 8 weeks prior to screening.  When mycophenolic acid is used instead of 
mycophenolate mofetil , a 360 -mg dose of mycophenolic acid is considered to be 
equivalent to a 500 -mg dose of mycophenolate mofetil .  Mycophenolate mofetil may 
have an interaction with oral contraceptives that may decrease their effectiveness; 
however, patients enrolling in this study and using hormonal contraceptives as a method 
of contraception are required to also use a barrier ,such as a male condom.
4.4.1.3 Azathioprine 
It is strongly recommended that prior to starting azathioprine, patients should have been 
evaluated for thiopurine methyltransferase variant alleles that have been associat ed with 
decreased activity in vitro and lead to the accumulation of the drug and/or its metabolites.  
A stable dose used for at least 8 weeks duration prior to screening of up to 2.5 
mg/kg/day is allowed. 
4.4.1.4 Methotrexate
Treatment must have been stable for at least the 8 weeks before screening.   Patients 
taking methotrexate (oral or parenteral) must stay on the same dose delivered by the 
same route for the duration of their participation in this study.  To prevent methotre xate-
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
68/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3associated adverse event s, all patients on methotrexate are required to take folic acid 
(e.g., 1 mg/day) or equivalent at a stable dose of at least 5 mg/week or equivalent as per 
local standard of care .
4.4.1.5 Non-Steroidal A nti-inflammatory  Drugs
As needed use of NSAIDs should be avoided within 24 hours before a visit where clinical 
efficacy assessments are scheduled to be performed and recorded.   
Aspirin can be taken to reduce cardiovascular risk, but the dose is not to exceed 
325mg/day.  
In order to pr event NSAID -related GI complications in high -risk patients, concomitant 
acid reducing agents (e.g., PPIs) should be used according to local guidelines (see 
Section 5.1.1.3 ).
Note that patients on anti -platelet agents may not be taking aspirin at the same t ime.
4.4.1.6 ACE Inhibitors and A RBs 
For patients who are on ACE inhibitors or ARBs atstudy entry , it is strongly 
recommended that doses of ACE inhibitors or ARBs be kept stable for at least 10 days 
prior to randomization and throughout the trial whenever possible . It is strongly 
recommended that ACE inhibitors or ARBs not be initiated during the OCS stability 
windows.
4.4.1.7 Dietary  Supplements 
For the purposes of this protocol, dietary supplements are defined as vitamins, minerals, 
purified food subst ances, and herbals with pharmaceutical properties.  Vitamins, 
minerals, and purified food substances are allowed in amounts not known to be 
associated with adverse event s (e.g., hypervitaminosis). Herbals with pharmaceutical 
properties are allowed only if there is acceptable evidence of no CYP3A inhibition or 
induction (refer to Appendix 19).
for a list of prohibited concomitant medications, including herbal products).  Otherwise, 
herbals with pharmaceutical properties must be discontinued for at least 4 w eeks prior to 
the first dose of study medication, unless there is sufficient data available regarding the 
duration of an herbal medication’s PK and PD effects to allow a shorter washout to be 
specified (e.g., 5 half-lives).  Please direct any questions to the Medical Monitor.
4.4.1.8 Acid Reducing A gents 
Patients who use short -acting antacids (e.g., Maalox®, Pepto -Bismol®, Rolaids®for 
symptomatic relief of heartburn) should take GDC -0853 or matching placebo 2 hours 
before or 2 hours after short -acting antacid administration because gastric acid improves 
GDC- 0853 absorption.  Patients may be treated with PPIs or H2RAs at up to the 
maximum recommended dose according to local labeling.  The dose should remain 
stable for at least the 2 weeks before randomization an d throughout the study.  At visits 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
69/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3with scheduled PK assessments (see Appendix 1and Appendix 2), the date and time of 
last administration of any PPIs, H2RA, and/or short -acting antacids taken should be 
recorded on the concomitant medication eCRF .
4.4.2 Prohibit ed Therapy
A listing of concomitant medications and foods that are prohibited or should be used with 
caution due to potential PK drug -drug interactions is provided in Appendix 19.  Biologic 
response modifiers and disease -modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) other than 
those mentioned above are not allowed during this study and any use will require 
discontinuation of study treatment.  
Specifically, the use of the following therapies is prohibited in conjunction with study drug 
treatment:
All biosimilar and biological agents (e.g., TNF inhibitors, IL -17, IL- 12/23, abatacept, 
denosumab) as well as biosimilars (investigational or approved)
Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody
Belimumab (Benlys ta)
Chlorambucil
Cyclophosphamide
Heparin, low molecular weight heparin, and other injectable systemic anticoagulants
Immunosorbent column
Investigational therapy other than study drug
IV Ig
Oral anticoagulants, including but not limited to warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, 
and apixaban 
Sirolimus
Systemic calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus, cyclosporine)
Tocilizumab and other anti -IL6R or anti -IL6 agents 
Tofacitinib and other JAK inhi bitors
 IV or IM steroids at doses greater than 40 mg prednisone PO or equivalent with 
the exception of use as escape therapy
Please see Appendix 19for additional prohibited therapies during this study.
4.4.2.1 Live or Attenuated Vaccinations
Immunization with a live or attenuated vaccine is prohibited within 6 weeks prior to
randomization and for the duration of study participation, including the 8 -week follow -up 
period after the administration of the last dose.  See Section 5.1.1.2 for further details 
and precau tions around vaccinations.
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
70/Protocol GA30044 , Version 34.4.2.2 CYP3A  and BCRP -Mediated Drug Interactions
Preliminary data from a clinical drug -drug interaction study (Study GP39616) suggest 
that GDC -0853 may be classified as a mild inhibitor of CYP3A at clinically relevant 
doses.  It is possible that GDC -0853 inhibition of CYP3A may alter the metabolism of 
CYP3A substrates and result in increased plasma concentrations of CYP3A substrates.
Therefore, medications in the following categories (listed in detail in Appendix 19) 
should be used w ith caution in consultation with the Medical Monitor (or delegate) as 
necessary unless otherwise specified in Section 4.4.2 :
Sensitive CYP3A substrates
CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index 
The use of hormone -replacement therapy or hormonal co ntraceptives containing the 
CYP3A substrate ethinylestradiol (with the concomitant use of a barrier method) is 
permitted; however, patients should be counseled regarding the potential risks and 
benefit of these medications per the local prescribing informa tion.   Any increase in 
ethinylestradiol plasma concentrations is anticipated to be modest at most due to the 
relatively minor contribution of CYP -mediated oxidation in the clearance of orally 
administered ethinylestradiol ( Zhang et al. 2007 ); however, increased ethinylestradiol 
plasma concentrations may lead to an increase in common side effects (e.g. nausea, 
breast tenderness, and headaches) and a theoretical increase in rare dose -relate d events 
(e.g. thromboembolism; Inman et al. 1970 ).
Preliminary data from Study GP39616 also suggest that GDC -0853 may be classified 
as a moderately sensitive substrate of CYP3A at clinically relevant doses. There is a 
moderate potential for a drug-drug interaction with any medication that strongly inhibits or 
induces this enzyme. Therefore, medications in the following categories (listed in detail 
inAppendix 19) should be avoided for 7 days or 5 half -lives, whichever is longer, prior to 
the first dose of study drug until the last dose of study drug , unless otherwise advised by 
the Medical Monitor (or delegate) .  If use of one of these medications is necessary, the 
risks and benefits should be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to concomitant 
administration with study drug.
 Strong CYP3A inhibitors
Moderate or strong CYP3A inducers 
Lastly, preliminary data from Study GP39616 suggest that GDC- 0853 is a moderate 
inhibitor of the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) (also known as ABCG2) 
transporter protein at clinically relevant doses. There is a potential for increased 
plasma concentrations of drugs known to be substrates of the BCRP transporter.  
Plasma concentrations of the medications in the following category (listed in detail in 
Appendix 19) may increase; therefore, they should be used with caution in consultation 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
71/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3with the Medi cal Monitor (or delegate) as necessary unless otherwise specified in 
Section 4.4.2:
 BCRP substrates with a narrow therapeutic index
The medications listed in Appendix 19are not necessarily comprehensive.  Thus, the 
investigator should consult the prescri bing information for concomitant medication sas 
well as the Internet references provided below when determining whether a certain 
medication is metabolized by or strongly inhibits or induces CYP3A or is a sensitive 
substrate of BCRP .  The investigator shou ld contact the Medical Monitor if questions 
arise regarding medications that may interact with CYP3A or BCRP .

DrugInteractionsLabeling/ucm093664.htm (Tables 3- 1, 3- 2, 3- 3, and 5 -1)
http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx
4.4.3 Prohibited Food 
Use of the following foods is prohibited during the study and for at least 7 days prior to 
initiation of study treatment due to their effects on the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme, 
which is involved in GDC -0853 metabolism:  furanocoumarin derivatives as found in 
grapefruit, Seville orange, pomegrana te, or star fruit juice or products. Please refer to
Appendix 19for additional information.
4.4.4 Additional Restrictions
Patients should be fasting for 4hours prior to pre -dose PK draw sat Day 1 and 
Week24, and also when fasting lipids are drawn (Day 1, Week 12 , Week 24 ,Week 36, 
and W eek 48) .  At W eek24, patients should also remain fasting for the 2 -hour PK 
timepoint (see Appendix 1and Appendix 2).  The morning dose of oral study drug will be 
administered at the strongly recommended morning clinic visi t while fasting.
4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS
Please see Appendix 1and Appendix 2for the schedule of activities to be performed 
during the study.
The screening visit can occur up to 35days prior to the first dose of study drug.  The 
screening period may be extended upon the approval of the Medical Monitor.  The Day 1 
(baseline and randomization) visit occurs on the first day of study drug administration.  
At applicable sites (United States only), if the patient is unable to return to the clinic at 
the Week24 visit for the PK blood draw at the 8 -to 10 -hour timepoint, then this sample 
may be collected by a home nurse (HN) professional at the patient's home or another 
suitable location to improve access and convenience for patients participating in the 
study.  The S ponsor will select a healthcare company that will be responsible for 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
72/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3providing HN services for participating sites (the HN vendor).  The HN vendor is 
responsible for ensuring that all HN professionals are licensed, qualified, and in good 
standing, as per a pplicable regulations, and that appropriate background checks have 
been performed.  If the investigator at a participating site determines that HN services 
are appropriate for a patient and the patient gives written informed consent to participate 
in HN vi sits, the HN network will communicate with the patient and the patient’s site.  HN 
visits will be scheduled on specified visit days, to allow for relevant assessments to be 
performed by the HN professional.  The schedule of activities will specify the 
asse ssments that may be performed by an HN professional (see Appendix 1and 
Appendix 2).
4.5.1 Informed Consent Forms and Screening Log
Patients will be screened within a period of up to 35days prior to administration of study 
medication to confirm that they meet the entrance criteria for the study.  The study 
investigator or sub -investigator will discuss with each patient the nature of the study, its 
requirements, and its restrictions and potential risks.
Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before 
performing any study -related procedures.  Informed Consent Forms for enrolled patients 
and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be maintained at the study site.
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that patients meet 
all eligibility criteria before enrollment.  Pre -enrollment adjudication by the Medical 
Monitor and his/her designees will occur for all patients who co mplete screening prior to 
their randomization into the study (see Appendix 3).  The investigator will maintain a 
screening log to record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.
4.5.2 Eligibility  Assessment at Screening
At screening, patient s who fail to meet any laboratory inclusion/exclusion criteria or other 
eligibility criteria may be retested or rescreen edper the instructions in Section 4.5.2.1
andSection 4.5.2.2 , respectively .
4.5.2.1 Re-Testing:  Laboratory  Inclusion/Exclusion
If a patient fails certain laboratory inclusion/exclusion criteria at screening, the 
investigator may repeat the test once within the screening period; see Section 4.1.2 for a 
list of laboratory tests and levels that can be retested.  If the patient passes the 
laboratory eligibility criteria on the second assessment, he/she will be adjudicated and 
may enter the study.  It will not be considered a re -testing if blood samples have to be 
redrawn due to sample handling pr oblems, breakage, sample integrity, or laboratory 
error.
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
73/Protocol GA30044 , Version 34.5.2.2 Re-Screening
Re-screening refers to repeating the whole screening process.  Re -screening is required 
if a patient has not met all of the eligibility criteria within the original screening period 
(Note:  patients who have failed two laboratory testing attempts as described in 
Section 4.5.2.1 cannot be re -screened).  Patients are only allowed to be re -screened 
once.  Each patient must be re- consented before re -screening occurs.  It will not be 
considered a re -screening if blood samples have to be redrawn due to sample handling 
problems, breakage, sample integrity, or laboratory error.
4.5.3 Medical History  and Demographic Data
A complete medical history will be taken at the screening visit and should include details 
of past and current manifestations of SLE, past and current concomitant medical 
conditions, previous surgical procedures, and previous treatment regimens for SLE 
including any history of adverse drug reactions.  In addition, all medications 
(e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic 
remedies, nutritional supplements) used by the patients within 7 days prior to screening
will be recorded.
Particular emphasis should be placed on manifestations of active SLE as well as the 
clinical and laboratory findings that identified the patient as having SLE (ACR or SLICC 
criteria) and onidentifying any medical conditions ( e.g., active or latent infection) that 
might place the patient at increased risk or which might confound the interpretation of 
safety or efficacy signals.  At subsequent visits, the investigator will focus on changes in 
the patient’s symptoms since the previous visit, including but not limited to features 
indicating current SLE activity, changes in disease activity since the previous visit, and 
potential adverse events.
The medical history must also include clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer 
history (including prior cancer therapies and procedures), reproductive status, family 
history of aut oimmunity, vaccine history, smoking history, use of alcohol, and drugs of 
abuse.
A detailed history of medication used for SLE is required.  All prior immunosuppressant 
drugs used to treat lupus 12 months prior to screening (including drug name, maximum 
dose used, and start and stop dates, as applicable) will be recorded.  The year of onset 
as well as the symptoms that lead to the diagnosis of SLE in the patient as defined by 
either the ACR or SLICC inclusion criteria should be captured. 
Demographic data w ill include age, sex, and self -reported race/ethnicity.
4.5.4 Physical Examinations
A complete physical examination should be performed at screening and should include 
an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, and the cardiovascular, 
dermatological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, GI, genitourinary, and neurological systems.  
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
74/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical 
History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.  Particular attention should be given to 
evaluation of pot ential manifestations of active SLE and of infections or other medical 
conditions, which could place the patient at increased risk. 
At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), limited, efficacy assessment directed or 
symptom -directed physical exami nations should be performed.  Changes from baseline 
abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes.  New orworsened clinically significant 
abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.
4.5.5 Vital Signs
Vital signs will includ e measurements of respiratory rate, pulse rate, temperature, and 
systolic and diastolic blood pressures while the patient is in a seated position for at least 
5 minutes.
4.5.6 Chest Radiograph 
Chest radiographs of appropriate quality (to adhere to local standar ds for the exclusion 
of active TB) and with formal readings by a radiologist will be obtained at screening.  If 
chest radiographs have been taken and read by a radiologist within 12 weeks prior to 
screening and documented results (as read by a radiologist) show no clinically 
significant abnormality as determined by the investigator, the chest radiograph does not 
need to be repeated.
4.5.7 Tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative Skin Test
The QuantiFERON TB-Gold(QFT) should be used as the initial screening test for 
tuberculosis and, if indeterminate, this QFT test should be followed by a repeat QFT or a 
T-SPOTtest.  If QFT is not available, a Mantoux PPD skin test will be performed at the 
screening visit or wi thin the 12 weeks prior to screening and read locally.  The PPD skin 
test will be performed per the CDC guidelines using 5 tuberculin units per 0.1 mL [5TU] .  
An intradermal injection into flexor or dorsal surface of forearm will be performed .
4.5.8 SLE D isease Activity A ssessments
The following applicable SLE disease activity assessments will be used in this study: 
BILAG -2004 , SLEDAI -2K, SELENA- SLEDAI Flare Index (S FI), Glucocorticoid Toxicity 
Change Index [GTCI], SLICC /ACR Damage Index (SDI) , 28-Joint Count, CLASI, 
Physician’s Global Assessment, and Patient’s Global Assessment .  In addition, the SRI 
and BICLA composite endpoints will be evaluated.  Throughout the study, each
assessment ideally should be conducted by the same assessor, if possible (e.g., the 
same assessor should conduct the 28 -joint count at each visit for a particular patient, if 
possible). Detailed instructions and training on the use of clinical instruments performed 
by the investigators in this study will be provided by the Sponsor or Spons or designee.
Investigators must demonstrate the ability to perform disease activity assessments 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
75/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3and/or they must provide valid training certificates obtained within 2 years of the start of 
the study for versions used in this study.
4.5.8.1 BILA G 2004 Index
The BILAG 2004 index (BILAG) will be used as a method to assess disease activity in 
this study .
The BILAG assesses 97clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory parameters across 
nine organ o r system domains:  constitutional, mucocutaneous, neuropsychiatric,
musculoskeletal, cardiorespiratory, GI, ophthalmic, renal, and hematological.  The 
97symptoms are rated with respect to severity over the previous month (4weeks) and 
with respect to any change from the previous examination (new, improving, stable, 
worse ning, absent).  For each of the nine domains, a single , alphabetic score (i.e., 
Athrough E) is then derived from the examination results in each organ category.  
Detailed instructions and training on the use of the BILAG will be provided as described 
inAppendix 9.
4.5.8.2 Systemic Lupus Ery thematosus Disease A ctivity Index 2000
(SLEDA I-2K)andSELENA -SLEDA I Flare Index (SFI)
The SLEDAI -2Kwill be used to approximate disease activity for entry into the study and 
at every subsequent study visit (see Appendix 10).  
SLEDAI -2Kmeasures disease activity at the visit or within the preceding 28 days.  
Detailed instructions and training on the use of the SLEDAI -2Kwill be provided during 
training sessions at each investigator meeting, and through online resources. Itis critical 
that investigators have a thorough understanding of both the BILAG and SLEDAI -2K
instruments and the differences between them.
The SFI categorizes SLE flare as “mild or moderate” or “severe” based on 6 variables 
(Buyon et al, 2005 ; Petri et al. 1999 ; Petri et al. 2005 ):
Change in SELENA -SLEDAI (or SLEDAI -2K) score fr om the most recent 
assessment to current
Change in signs or symptoms of disease activity
Change in prednisone dosage
Use of new medications for disease activity or hospitalization
Change in PGA score 
Hospitalization for activity (severe flare only)
The SFIwill be modified such that severe flares defined only bythe occurrence of an 
increase in SLEDAI -2Kscore to 12 w ill be excluded. One or more other items defining 
severe flare in the SFI needed to be present for a severe flare to be recorded. This 
modification was made because patients entering the trial with high disease activity 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
76/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3(e.g., 11) could too easily trigger a severe flare by minor increases in the SLEDAI -2K 
score.
4.5.8.3 Glucocorticoid Toxicity Change Index
The GTCI is an exploratory standardized measure of damage related to use of 
glucocorticoids (see Appendix 12).  The GTCI will be incorporated into this study to 
better quantify the accrual of damage linked to corticosteroid use in patients with lupus 
and may allow for an improved understanding of standard of care and patient phenotype.
4.5.8.4 Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Cli nics (SLICC) / 
ACR Damage Index for Sy stemic Lupus Erythematosus
The SLICC /ACR Damage Index (SDI) for SLE will be utilized to assess organ damage 
as opposed to the collection of disease activity (see Appendix 7).  Damage is defined as 
non-reversible change not related to active inflammation.
4.5.8.5 28-Joint Count
For all patients, 28 -joint counts should be performed at the intervals specified in the 
Schedule of Activities (see Appendix 1).  The joint counts must be performed by an 
assessor with experience in perfor ming these assessments; this may be the Principal 
Investigator, subinvestigator, or another trained individual approved by the Sponsor.  
The joint counts on a given patient are strongly recommended to be performed by the 
same assessor , whenever possible, at each study visit. 
The 28 joints included in this assessment are listed in Appendix 13. 
4.5.8.6 Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease A rea and Severity 
Index (CLA SI)
The CLASI is an instrument designed to capture SLE -specific mucocutaneous disease 
manifestations (see Appendix 14).  It comprises a score for the activity of the disease 
and a score for the damage caused by the disease.  The CLASI should be completed at 
intervals as indicated in the schedule of assessments for any patient who h as 
mucocutaneous manifestations of SLE at a given study visit and at all subsequent visits.  
The CLASI will be used to capture mucocutaneous disease in any patient with 
mucocutaneous disease manifestations beginning on the visit that the mucocutaneous 
mani festation is first observed and periodically thereafter as outlined in the Schedule of 
Activities (see Appendix 1).  
It is important that only SLE -specific lesions are included in this assessment.  Training in 
the use of the CLASI will be available online and will be required for any new investigator 
from the beginning of Study GA30044.
4.5.8.7 Physician’s Global A ssessment
The Physician’s Global Assessment (see Appendix 15) is a visual analog scale
(VAS) . Physicians are to rate the patient’s disease activity ov er the past 28 days and place 
a vertical tick mark on a 100- mm analog scale from 0 to 3. The left -hand extreme of the 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
77/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3line is described as “None” and the right –hand extreme as “Severe.”  Patient history, 
results of the physical examination, as well as per tinent laboratory values should be taken 
into account when rating the patient’s disease activity. Physicians should also refer to the 
value recorded at the previous visit and move the tick mark as appropriate.
4.5.8.8 Patient’s Global A ssessment
The Patient’s Glo bal Assessment is a VAS (see Appendix 16).  The patient’s overall 
assessment of their current disease activity is measured using a vertical tick mark on a 
100-mm VAS.  The left -hand extreme of the line is described as “ None ” and the right –
hand extreme as “ Maximum.”
4.5.8.9 Systemic Lupus Ery thematosus Responder Index
The SRI is a categorical assessment that evaluates disease activity in SLE based on the 
different organ systems.  This index utilizes a combined evaluation of the SLEDAI -2K, 
BILAG, and Physician Global Assessment to measure response to treatment (see 
Sections 4.5.8.2, 4.5.8.1 ; 4.5.8.7 ).  The SRI -4 primary endpoint defines response as 
meeting all of the following criteria at Week 48 compared with baseline: 
  4 point reduction in SLEDAI -2K score
No new BILAG A organ domain score or 2 new BILAG B organ domain scores
No worsening (worsening defined as a > 0.3 point increase) in the Physician’s 
Global Assessment.
4.5.8.10 BICLA
The BICLA is a composite index that was originally derived by expert consensus of 
diseas e activity indices ( Wallace et al. 2011 ).  BICLA response is defined as follows :
At least one gradation of improvement in baseline BILAG scores in all body systems 
with moderate or severe disease activity at entry (e.g., all A (severe disease) scores 
falling to B (moderate), C (mild), or D (no activity) and all B scores falling to C or D
No new BILAG A or more than one new BILAG B scores
No worsening of total SLEDAI -2K score from baseline
No signif icant deterioration ( 10%) in physician’s global assessment, and
No treatment failure (initiation of non- protocol treatment)
4.5.8.11 Optional Photography (for U nited States only , as applicable )
For patients with cutaneous manifestations of SLE, optional photographs of the affected 
areas may be taken to document change over time while the patient is receiving study 
treatment. Photography is an optional assessment for patients (United States only ,as 
applicable ) who sign the optional photography consent and is contingent on EC/IRB 
approval.

81/Protocol GA30044 , Version 34.5.10 Electrocardiograms
All ECG recordings must be performe d using a standard, high -quality, high- fidelity, 
digital ECG machine equipped with computer -based interval measurements.  Lead 
placement should be as consistent as possible.  
4.5.10.1 Timing of Electrocardiograms
Triplicate or single ECG recordings will be obtaine d at specified timepoints, as outlined 
in the Schedule of Activities (see Appendix 1). Triplicate ECG recordings will be obtained 
within approximately 2 -5 minutes of each other.
When triplicate ECGs are required ,three interpretable ECG recordings (e.g., without 
artifacts) must be obtained.  Triplicate ECGs will be captured as follows: 
Day 1: Triplicate ECG (pre- dose)
Week 24: Triplicate ECG (2 hours 30 min utes, post -dose)
The ECG intervals (e.g., PR, QRS, QT , QTcF, and RR) and heart rate from these three 
ECGs will be entered into the eCRF: in addition, these triplicate readings will be stored 
for future analysis, if needed .  
Single ECG recordings may be obtained at unscheduled and other timepoints as 
indicated. 
4.5.10.2 Patient Preparation for Electrocardio gram
ECG recordings are recommended to not be obtained within 3 hours after any meal , 
whenever possible .  ECG recordings must be performed after the patient has been 
resting in a supine position for at least 10 minutes.  All ECGs are strongly recommended 
to be obtained prior to other procedures scheduled at that same time (e.g., vital sign 
measurements, blood draws) , whenever possible , except for PROs which should 
generally be collected first at a visit .  Circumstances that may induce changes in heart 
rate, including environmental distractions (e.g., television, radio, conversation) should be 
avoided during the pre- ECG resting period and during ECG recording.
4.5.10.3 Monitoring and Reporting of Electrocardiograms
For safety monitoring purposes, the investigator must review, sign, and date all ECG 
tracings.  Paper copies of ECG tracings will be kept as part of the patient's permanent 
study file at the site.  Digital recordings will be stored at a central laboratory.  The 
following should be recorded in the appropriate eCRF:  heart rate, RR interval, QRS 
interval, PR duration, uncorrected QT interval, and QTcF based on the machine 
readings of the individual ECG tracings.  Any morphologic waveform changes or other 
ECG abnormalities must be documented on the eCRF.  If con sidered appropriate by the 
Sponsor, ECGs may be analyzed retrospectively at a central laboratory.
If at a particular post -dose timepoint ,the mean QTcF is 500 ms ecand/or 60 ms ec
longer than the baseline value, another triplicate ECG must be recorded, ideally within 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
82/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3the next 5 minutes, and triplicate ECG monitoring should continue at least hourly until 
the QTcF has stabilized on two successive ECGs.  The Medical Monitor should be 
notified.  SOC treatment may be instituted per the discretion of the investigator.  If a PK 
sample is not scheduled for that timepoint, an unscheduled PK sample should be 
obtained.  A decision on study drug discontinuation should be made, as described in 
Section 5.1.  The investigator should also evaluate the patient for potential concurrent 
risk factors (e.g., electrolyte abnormalities, co -medications known to prolong the QT 
interval, severe bradycardia).
4.5.11 Patient -Reported Outcomes
PRO data will be collected via questionnaires to more fully characterize the clinical 
profile of GDC- 0853 .  The questionnaires, translated into the local language as required, 
will be completed in their entirety at specified timepoints during the study.  T o ensure 
instrument validity and that data standards meet health authority requirements, 
questionnaires will be self -administered before the patient or clinician receives any 
information on disease status, prior to the performance of non- PRO assessments, a nd 
prior to the administration of study treatment, unless otherwise specified.  
Patients and clinicians will use paper based questionnaires to capture PRO data.  The 
instructions for completing the questionnaires will be provided by the investigator staff .  
4.5.11.1 Functional A ssessment of Chronic Illness Therapy -Fatigue 
Scale (FA CIT Fatigue)
The FACIT -Fatigue scale will be used to assess patients’ fatigue ( Cella et al. 2005 ).  The 
13-item questionnaire has been validated for use wi th SLE patients and has a 7 -day 
recall period.  Items are assessed on a 5 -point Likert scale with responses ranging from 
0 “not at all” to 4 “very much” and possible total scores range from 0 to 52.  A higher 
score indicates less fatigue, and the minimal i mportant different has been identified at a 
change of 3 points ( Lai et al. 2011 ).  See Appendix 17for a list of questions in the 
FACIT -Fatigue. 
4.5.12 Mandatory  Samples for Whole Genome Sequencing
At participating sites, a blood sample will be collected for DNA extraction to enable 
whole genome sequencing ( WGS).  This sample may be sent to one or more 
laboratories for analysis .
Collection and submission of W GS samples is contingent upon the review and approval 
of the exploratory research and the WGS  portion of the ICFby each site's Institutional 
Review Board or Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) and, if applicable, an appropriate 
regulatory body.  If a site has not been granted approval for WGS  sampl ing, this section 
of the protocol ( i.e., Section 4.5.12) will not be applicable at that site.
Genomics are increasingly informing researcher s' understanding of disease 
pathobiology.  W GS provides a comprehensive characterization of the genome and, 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
83/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3along wi th clinical data collected in this study, may increase the opportunity for 
developing new therapeutic approaches.  Data will be analyzed in the context of this 
study but will also be explored in aggregate with data from other studies.  The availability 
of a larger dataset will assist in theidentification of important pathways, thus guiding the 
development of new targeted agents.
For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the 
laboratory manual.  
Blood samples collected for WGS are to be stored until they are no longer needed or 
until they are exhausted.  However, the storage period will be in accordance with the 
IRB/EC -approved ICF and applicable laws (e.g., health authority requirements).
Patient medical information associa ted with W GS specimens is confidential and may be 
disclosed to third parties only as permitted by the ICF (orseparate authorization for use 
and disclosure of personal health information) signed by the patient, unless permitted or 
required by law.
Given th e complexity and exploratory nature of the analyses, data derived from WGS 
specimens will ,generally ,not be provided to study investigators or patients unless 
required by law.  The aggregate results of any conducted research will be available in 
accordanc e with the effective Sponsor policy on study data publication.
4.5.13 Optional Samples for Research Biosample Repository
4.5.13.1 Overview  of the Research Biosample Repository
The Research Biosample Repository (RBR) is a centrally administered group of facilities 
used for the long -term storage of human biologic specimens, including body fluids, solid 
tissues, and derivatives thereof (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides).  The collection, 
storage, and analysis of RBR specimens will facilitate the rational design of new 
pharm aceutical agents and the development of diagnostic tests, which may allow for 
individualized drug therapy for patients in the future.
Specimens for the RBR will be collected from patients who give specific consent to 
participate in this optional research. RBR specimens will be used to achieve the 
following objectives:
To study the association of biomarkers with efficacy, adverse event s, or disease 
progression
To increase knowledge and understanding of disease biology
To study drug response, including drug effects and the processes of drug absorption 
and disposition
To develop biomarker or diagnostic assays and establish the performance 
characteristics of these assays
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
84/Protocol GA30044 , Version 34.5.13.2 Approval by the Institutional Review  Board or Ethics 
Committee
Collection and submission o f biological samples to the RBR is contingent upon the 
review and approval of the exploratory research and the RBR portion of the Informed 
Consent Form by each site's Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) 
and, if applicable, an appropriat e regulatory body.  If a site has not been granted 
approval for RBR sampling, this section of the protocol ( see Section 4.5.13 ) will not be 
applicable at that site.
4.5.13.3 Sample Collection
The following samples will be stored in the RBR and used for research purposes, 
including, but not limited to, research on biomarkers related to GDC -0853 and lupus:
Serum and blood for RNA samples collected at screening; Day 1 (pre -dose); 
Weeks12, 24, and 48; and flare visit . 
For sampling procedures, storage conditions, a nd shipment instructions, see the 
laboratory manual.  
RBR specimens are to be stored until they are no longer needed or until they are 
exhausted.  However, the RBR storage period will be in accordance with the 
IRB/EC -approved Informed Consent Form and applicable laws (e.g., health authority 
requirements).
4.5.13.4 Confidentiality
Specimens and associated data will be labeled with a unique patient identification 
number.
Patient medical information associated with RBR specimens is confidential and may be 
disclosed to third parties only as permitted by the Informed Consent Form (or separate 
authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by the patient, 
unless permitted or required by law.
Given the complexity and exploratory nature of the analyses, data derived from RBR 
specimens will generally not be provided to study investigators or patients unless 
required by law.  The aggregate results of any conducted research will be available in 
accordance with the effective Sponsor policy on study data publication.
Data generated from RBR specimens must be available for inspection upon request by 
representatives of national and local health authorities, and Sponsor monitors, 
representatives, and collaborators, as appropriate.
Any inventions and resul ting patents, improvements, and/or know -how originating from 
the use of the RBR data will become and remain the exclusive and unburdened property 
of the Sponsor, except where agreed otherwise.
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
85/Protocol GA30044 , Version 34.5.13.5 Consent to Participate in the Research Biosample Repository
TheInformed Consent Form will contain a separate section that addresses participation 
in the RBR.  The investigator or authorized designee will explain to each patient the 
objectives, methods, and potential hazards of participation in the RBR.  Patients will be 
told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their specimens at any 
time and for any reason during the storage period.  A separate, specific signature will be 
required to document a patient's agreement to provide optional RBR speci mens.  
Patients who decline to participate will not provide a separate signature.
The investigator should document whether or not the patient has given consent to 
participate and (if applicable) the date(s) of consent, by completing the RBR Research 
Sample Informed Consent eCRF.
In the event of an RBR participant's death or loss of competence, the participant's 
specimens and data will continue to be used as part of the RBR research.
4.5.13.6 Withdrawal from the Research Biosample Repository
Patients who give consent to provide RBR specimens have the right to withdraw their 
specimens from the RBR at any time for any reason.  If a patient wishes to withdraw 
consent to the testing of his or her specimens, the investigator must inform the Medical 
Monitor in writing of th e patient's wishes through use of the appropriate RBR Subject 
Withdrawal Form and, if the trial is ongoing, must enter the date of withdrawal on the 
RBR Research Sample W ithdrawal of Informed Consent eCRF.  The patient will be 
provided with instructions on how to withdraw consent after the trial is closed.  A 
patient's withdrawal from Study GA30044 does not, by itself, constitute withdrawal of 
specimens from the RBR.  Likewise, a patient's withdrawal from the RBR does not 
constitute withdrawal from Study GA 30044.
4.5.13.7 Monitoring and Oversight
RBR specimens will be tracked in a manner consistent with Good Clinical Practice by a 
quality -controlled, auditable, and appropriately validated laboratory information 
management system, to ensure compliance with data confid entiality as well as 
adherence to authorized use of specimens as specified in this protocol and in the 
Informed Consent Form.  Sponsor monitors and auditors will have direct access to 
appropriate parts of records relating to patient participation in the RB R for the purposes 
of verifying the data provided to the Sponsor.  The site will permit monitoring, audits, 
IRB/EC review, and health authority inspections by providing direct access to source 
data and documents related to the RBR samples.

5. ASSESSMENT OF SA FETY
5.1 SAFETY PLA N
To protect patient safety ,an unblinded IMC in collaboration with a Scientific Oversight 
Committee will monitor safety throughout the study (see Section 3.1.2 ).
The safety risk management plan for patients in this study is based on nonclinical and 
clinical experience with GDC -0853 in completed and ongoing studies as well as 
published literature on other BTK inhibitors and takes into account the population under 
study.  The important potential safety risks for GDC -0853 are outlined below.  Please
refer to the GDC- 0853 Investigator’s Brochure for a complete summary of safety 
information. 
Several measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study .  
Eligibility criteria have been designed to exclude patients at high er risk for potential 
toxicities.  Patients will undergo safety monitoring during the study, including monitoring 
of vital signs, physical examination, ECGs, and routine laboratory safety assessments 
(hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) and assessment o f the nature, frequency, and 
severity of adverse events.  In addition, guidelines for managing potential adverse 
events, including criteria for treatment interruption or discontinuation, and enhanced 
safety reporting are provided below and in Table 5 .  
5.1.1 Safety Plan for Potential Risks Associated with GDC -0853 
5.1.1.1 Infections
On the basis of the well described phenotype of patients with XLA, a primary 
immunodeficiency of B cells and immunoglobulin production, it is anticipated that 
inhibitors of BTK may raise the risk for certain bacterial infections 
(Lederman andWinkelstein 1985 ; Broides et al .2006 ), enteroviral infections ( Misbah et 
al. 1992 ; Ziegner et al. 2002 ), intestinal infections with Giardia and Campylobacter 
species (Winkelstein etal.2006 ; van den Bruele et al. 2010 ), or other opportunistic 
infections which are primarily cleared by B -cell adaptive immune responses.  This risk is 
likely independent of sex f or patients exogenously administered GDC -0853.  
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
89/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3Unlike XLA, GDC -0853 is a reversible inhibitor of BTK that will be initiated after the 
immune system has developed, and so the degree to which GDC- 0853 antagonism of 
BTK signaling may suppress immune acti vity or resemble XLA is unknown.  However, 
data to date suggest that since BTK inhibitors target only the kinase domain, other BTK 
activities may remain intact and IgG levels in patients with an established immune 
system may not be significantly depleted ( Byrd et al. 2013).  
Effects on lymphocytes and immunoglobulins in rats and dogs were reversible and 
considered to be related to pharmacological activity involving BTK inhibition.  See 
Section 1.3.1 for related primary nonclinical toxicity findings and Section 4 of the 
GDC- 0853 Investigator’s Brochure for further details.  
To date, no immune -challenge experiments (e.g., T-dependent antigen response test 
[TDAR] ) have been conducted in animals.  It is not known if these effects on B cells and 
IgG concentrations in animals will tr anslate to humans ,or if such changes would have 
functional/deleterious impact on immune function.
Infections, including pneumonia and fatal influenza, have occurred in patients with B -cell 
malignancies treated with GDC -0853.  In studies with healthy subje ctswith single doses 
and with dosing for 14 days, self -limited Grade 1 events of nasopharyngitis were 
reported but did not lead to any change in study drug dosing.  One subject had 
asymptomatic bacteriuria, which resolved while study drug dosing continued.
Patients will be excluded from the study if they have a history of any major episode of 
infection requiring hospitalization or treatment with IV or IM antimicrobials within 4 weeks 
prior to or during screening or treatment with oral antimicrobia ls within 2 weeks prior to 
and during screening, evidence of active or latent or inadequately treated infection with 
TB, known active infection (current) or history of recurrent infection, or any known 
immunodeficiency including IgG 500 mg/dL (see Sectio n4.1.2 ).
Total Ig concentrations will be measured regularly throughout the study. All patients in 
the study should be monitored for fever and potential infectious complications, including 
opportunistic infections and tuberculosis, and should be evaluated promptly. Physicians 
or a health care provider should give patients advice to prevent potential transmission of 
and exposure to endemic infections according to local or CDC guidelines. Patients 
should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and 
symptoms suggestive of an infection.   All infections occurring during the study that 
require treatment, including, but not limited to, respiratory infections, cutaneous 
infections, urinary tract infections and systemic viral infections and episodes of 
suspicious or febrile diarrhea, should be evaluated using serology or PCR (if available , 
and as appropriate) and cultured if feasible and any identified organisms noted in the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  Any serious infection, any infection req uiring IV antimicrobials 
(i.e., any Grade 3 infection), or any opportunistic infection is considered an adverse

90/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3event of special interest (AESI) and should reported to the Sponsor in an expedited 
manner as outlined in Section 5.2.3 .
Guidelines for manageme nt of study treatment in the event that a patient experiences an 
infection are provided in Table 4 .
5.1.1.2 Vaccinations
The effect of GDC -0853 upon the efficacy of vaccinations is unknown. It is 
recommended that appropriate vaccinations per EULAR ( vanAssen et al. 2011 ) 
recommendations or local guidelines be up to date before study participation.  Patients 
will be excluded from study participation and will not be dosed with GDC -0853 if they 
have been vaccinated with live, atten uated vaccines (e.g., the intranasal live attenuated 
influenza vaccines, BCG , varicella) within 6 weeks before planned dosing.  Immunization 
with a live or attenuated vaccine is prohibited for the duration of study participation, 
including the safety follo w-up period after the administration of the last dose however 
inactivated vaccine formulations are permitted (e.g., seasonal influenza).   
In addition, current routine household contact with children or others who have been 
vaccinated with live vaccine com ponents may pose an unknown risk to the patient during 
study treatment with GDC-0853.  Some of these vaccines include varicella (“chickenpox”) 
vaccine, oral polio vaccine, and the inhaled flu vaccine.  Following vaccination with live 
component vaccines, th e virus may be shed in bodily fluids, including stool, and there is 
a potential risk that the virus may be transmitted to the patient. 
General guidelines for immunosuppressed patients suggest that exposure to vaccinated 
individuals should be avoided follo wing vaccination with these vaccines for the stated 
time periods:
Varicella or attenuated typhoid fever vaccination for 4 weeks following vaccination;
Oral polio vaccination for 6 weeks following vaccination;
Attenuated rotavirus vaccine for 10 days follow ing vaccination;
FluMist(inhaled flu vaccine) for 1 week following vaccination.
5.1.1.3 Bleeding
No decrease in platelets, changes in coagulation parameters or bleeding events were 
observed in nonclinical studies with GDC -0853.  Bleeding events, including non- serious 
CTCAE Grade 1 bruising and serious Grade 3 GI bleeding have been reported in 
patients with hematological malignancies treated with GDC -0853 in Study GO29089.  
The GI bleeding events have not been dose related, and the events occurred in patients 
who were taking concomitant NSAIDs/ acetylsalicylic acid and who had a history of 
gastroesophageal or peptic ulcer disease.  The impact of BTK inhibition as a potential 
risk factor for bleeding is unknown.  BTK is expressed in platelets and is involved in 
platelet function via GPVI/Collagen receptor signaling and GP1b receptor signaling.  
Platelets from patients with XLA , a genetic deficiency of BTK, demonstrate decreased 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
91/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3activation in response to submaximal collagen stimulation but normal response to 
thromb in; clinically, there is no reported bleeding propensity of XLA patients (Howard et 
al. 2006 ).
Bruising or bleeding events related to GDC -0853 have not been reported in healthy 
subjects .
It is unknown if GDC -0853 will increase the risk of bleeding in patients, especially in 
those receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies.  As a precautionary safety 
measure, patients will be excluded from study participation if they have a need for 
systemic anticoagulation with w arfarin or other oral or injectable anti -coagulants or 
anti-platelet agents (other than NSAIDs, aspirin, and other salicylates) , any history of 
hospitalizations or transfusion for a GI bleed, any history of a hemorrhagic CVA, any 
history of spontaneous int racranial hemorrhage, traumatic intracranial hemorrhage within 
10 years prior to the study or a known bleeding diathesis.  Patients should be advised to 
seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of 
clinically significan t bleeding.  
Several risk factors including patient age, co -morbidities, concurrent medications, prior 
medical history, and Helicobacter pylori infection have been demonstrated in a variety of 
studies to increase the risk of NSAID -related GI injury ( Lanza et al. 2009).  It is u nknown 
if GDC -0853 will increase the risk of bleeding in patients receiving NSAIDs.  Therefore, 
in order to prevent NSAID -related GI complications in high -risk patients, concomitant use 
of PPI should be considered ( Bhatt et al. 2008 ) and used according to local or 
recognized guidelines (e.g., ACCF/ACG/AHA 2008 Expert Consensus Document).
Patients at high risk for NSAID -related GI toxicity include the following:
Patients using both aspirin and an NSAID
Patients with a history of ulcer disease
Patients with one or more of the following:
–Age 60years
–High-dose NSAID use
–Concurrent corticosteroid use
–Dyspepsia or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms
Any bleeding event Grade 2 is considered an adverse event of special interest and 
should be reported to the Sponsor in an expedited manner as outlined in Section 5.2.3 .  
Guidelines for management of study treatment in the event that bleeding is observed in 
patients are provided in Table 4 .
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
92/Protocol GA30044 , Version 35.1.1.4 Cytopenias
Cytopenias have been observed in patients with hematological malignancies who 
received GDC -0853, including neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia; events have 
been monitorable and clinically manageable (see the GDC -0853 Investigator’s Brochure 
for furt her details).  
Patients should be monitored regularly with hematology laboratory evaluations as 
outlined in the schedule of assessments and should receive appropriate supportive care 
as clinically indicated.  Patients should be advised to seek immediate m edical attention if 
they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of cytopenias (e.g., persistent fever, 
bruising, bleeding, pallor). 
Guidelines for the management of study treatment, including dose holding, in the event 
of cytopenias in patients are provide d inTable 4 .  
5.1.1.5 Gastrointestinal Effects
Body weight gain and food consumption changes have been observed in animals, 
including nonsignificant increases in male W istar-Han rats administered 2 mg/kg/day 
(4.3 Mhr) for 6 months, and significant reductions in rats administered 100 mg/kg/day 
(1438 Mhr) and dogs administered 25 mg/kg (180 Mhr) for 4 weeks.  These effects 
on body weight gain and food consumption were reversible following discontinuation of 
GDC- 0853 dosing.
Grade 1 diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain have been reported in patients with 
hematological malignancies treated with GDC- 0853; however, the events resolved and 
have not led to study drug discontinuation.  Healthy subjects in the multiple 
ascending -dose study, GA29347, reported events of mild self -limited nausea.  
Throughout the study, patients will be monitored for GI side effects.  Guidelines for 
management of study treatment in the event of GI side effects in patients are provided in
Table 4 .
5.1.1.6 Hepatotoxicity
Evidence of hepatobiliary injury was observed in animals administered relatively high 
doses of GDC -0853 in repeat -dose toxicity studies (see Section 1.3.1 for related primary 
nonclinical toxicity findings) .  
In clinical studies to date, including single dosing and multiple dosing for 14 days in 
healthy subjects and daily dosing for up to 2 years in patients with hematological 
malignancies, there have been no adverse events of liver enzyme elevations or trends 
towards elevations in laboratory evaluations.  
As a safety risk mitigation measure, to be eligible for the study, AST and/or ALT levels 
should be no more than 1.5 times the ULN and total bilirubin levels should be 1.2ULN 
at screening.   Safety monitor ing for potential hepatotoxicity includes baseline and routine 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
93/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3evaluations of AST/ALT and total bilirubin levels throughout the study as outlined in the 
schedule of assessments .  
Laboratory results of Grade 3 (5ULN) AST or ALT elevation, or ALT or AST 
elevations 3ULN in combination with clinical jaundice (total bilirubin 2ULN) are 
considered AESI sand should be reported to the Sponsor in an expedited manner as 
outlined in Section 5.2.3 . 
Guidelines for the management of study tr eatment in the event of hepatotoxicity in 
patients are provided in Table 4 .  
5.1.1.7 Cardiovascular Effects
GDC- 0853 is considered to have a low potential to cause QT interval prolongation or to 
directly affect other cardiovascular parameters, at therapeutic exposures.  Aminimal 
increase in corrected QT (QTc; 7 ms ecor 3%) interval was noted at 45 mg/kg in the 
single dose cardiovascular safety pharmacology study in telemetry -instrumented dogs .  
Based on extrapolated/interpolated toxicokinetic data, the unbound C maxat 45 mg/kg 
(considered a NOAEL)  
  There were no GDC -0853 -related changes in ECG parameters in the 
repeat -dose 4 -week or 9 -month dog toxicity studies . 
Analys is of ECG data from the SAD and MAD studies in healthy subjects did not 
demonstrate any significant increase in either QRS interval or QTcF intervals.   However, 
cardiac safety will continue to be evaluated in all patients at baseline and throughout the 
study, with routine monitoring of vital signs (including heart rate and blood pressure), 
collection of routine safety ECGs, triplicate ECGs with appropriate PK -matched
timepoints , and collection of adverse events (see Appendix 1).
Management of patients with sustained QTcF prolongation (QTcF that is 500 msec 
and/or 60msec longer than the baseline value on at least two ECG measurements 
30 minutes apart) should include close monitoring, with ECGs repeated at least hourly 
until two successive ECGs show sta bilization of the findings, correction of any electrolyte 
abnormalities, and possible discontinuation of other concomitant medications that are 
known to prolong the QT interval.  Consultation with a cardiologist or electrophysiologist 
is recommended, to help in the management of such patients.  The Medical Monitor 
should be notified as soon as possible (see Section 4.5.8.11 and Section 4.5.10 )
Guidelines for management of study treatment in the event of cardiovascular effects in 
patients are provided in Table 4 .
5.1.1.8 Vascular Inflammation
 
  The translatability of the nonclinical findings to 

 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.  
94/Protocol GA30044, Version 3 humans is unknown; however, Beagle dogs are susceptible to spontaneous 
development of polyarteritis syndrome ( Snyder et al. 1995) and may be more sensitive 
to any drug-induced effects.  Further, there are several examples of approved therapies 
for which there is no correlation between the finding of vasculitis in dogs or rats at clinically relevant exposures and adverse outcomes in patients ( FDA 2003; FDA 2011).   
As a safety risk -mitigation measure, CBC, creatinine, and urinalysis will be monitored in 
all patients during the study.   
Guidelines for management of study treatment in the event of a new treatment emergent 
vasculitis in patients are provided in Table 4 . 
5.1.1.9 Malignancy 
The impact of BTK inhibition on the development of malignancies is not known; however, malignancies have been identified as a potential concern for immunomodulatory agents.  Malignancies have been reported in patients with XLA, including lymphoreticular malignancies, gastric and colorectal adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of 
the lung.  
Patients with a history of cancer, including hematologic malignancy and solid tumors, within 10 years of screening will be excluded from the study.  Basal or squamous  cell 
carcinoma of the skin that has been excised and is considered cured and in situ carcinoma of the cervix treated with apparent success by curative therapy more than 1 year prior to screening are not exclusionary. 
All malignancies are considered adverse events of special interest for this study and should be reported to the Sponsor in an expedited manner as outlined in Section 5.2.3.   
Guidelines for management of study treatment in the event of malignancies in patients 
are provided in Table 4 .  Please refer to the GDC -0853 Investigator’s Brochure for 
further details.

5.2 SAFETY PA RAMETERS A NDDEFINITIONS
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording adverse events, including 
serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest, performing 
protocol -specified safety laboratory assessments, measuring protocol -specified vital 
signs, and conducting other protocol -specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety 
evaluation of the study.
Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in 
Section 5.4. 
5.2.1 Adverse Events
According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event is any 
untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution.  An adverse event can 
therefore be any of the following:
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
99/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3Any new disease or exacerbation of an exis ting disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in 
Section 5.3.5.9 .  
Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline
Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug
Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, includ ing those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive 
procedures such as biopsies)
5.2.2 Serious A dverse Events (Immediately  Reportable to the 
Sponsor)
A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria:
Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death)
Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death)
This does not include any adverse event that had it occurred in a more severe 
form or was allowed to continue might have caused death.
Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section 5.3.5.10)
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substan tial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions)
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug
Is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize t he 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above)
The terms "severe" and "serious" are notsynonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or a ccording to NCI CTCAE; 
see Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such 
as severe headache without any further findings).
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF.
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor 
immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for 
reporting instructions).
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
100/Protocol GA30044 , Version 35.2.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately  Reportable to 
the Sponsor)
Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by the investigator to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see 
Section 5.4.2for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of special interest for this study 
include the following:
Adverse Events of Special Interest for GDC -0853
Any serious infection, any infections requiring IV antimicrobials and any 
opportunistic infections
Any bleeding event Grade 2 or above
All malignancies
A laboratory result of Grade 3 (i.e., 5ULN) AST or ALT elevation
Adverse Events of Special Interest for General Drug Development
Cases of potential drug- induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by Hy’s 
law (see Section 5.3.5.6)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study drug, as defined below
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an 
infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies only
when a contamination of the study drug is suspected.
5.3 METHODS A ND TIMING F OR CA PTURING A ND ASSESSING 
SAFETYPARAMETERS
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in 
accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Section 5.4Section 5.6.  
For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see 
Section 5.3.3 ), and causality (see Section 5.3.4 ).  
5.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period
Investigators will seek information on adverse events at each patient contact.  All 
adverse events, whether reported by the patient or noted by study personnel, will be 
recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Eve nt eCRF.
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study  drug , only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
101/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported 
(see Section 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events).
After initiation of study drug , alladverse events will be reported until 8 weeks after the 
last dose of study drug the patients receives, either in this study or in an OLE, if init iated.
Instructions for reporting adverse events that occur after the adverse event reporting 
period are provided in Section 5.6.
5.3.2 Eliciting A dverse Ev ent Information
A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adve rse event information at all patient evaluation timepoints.  Examples of non -directive 
questions include the following:
"How have you felt since your last clinic visit?"
"Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?" 
5.3.3 Assessme nt of Severity  of A dverse Events
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v4.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table 5 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.

aInstrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or 
clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc.
bExamples of self -care activities of daily living include bathing, dressing and undressing, 
feeding oneself, using the toilet, and taking medications, as performed by patients who are 
notbedridden.
cIf an event is assessed as a "significant medical event," it must be reported as a serious 
adverse event (see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions), per the definition of serious 
adverse event in Section 5.2.2 .
dGrade 4 and 5 events must be reported as serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for 
reporting instructions), per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 .
5.3.4 Assessment of Causality  of Adverse Events
Investigators should use their knowle dge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether an 
adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or "no" 
accordingly.  The following gui dance should be taken into consideration (see also
Table 6 ):
Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug
Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduc tion of study drug (as applicable)
Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments
Known association of the event with the disease under study
Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event
Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
103/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3Table 6Causal A ttribution Guidance
Is the adverse event suspected to be caused by the study  drug on the basis of facts, evidence, 
science -based rationales, and clinical judgment?
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of the study drug, and the adverse event cannot be readil y explained by 
the patient's clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapies; and/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the 
adverse event abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose 
reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re -challenge.
NO An adverse event will be considered related, unless it fulfills the criteria specified below .  
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, 
orconcomitant medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after 
firstdose of study drug).
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol -mandated therapy.
5.3.5 Procedures for Recording A dverse Events
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording a dverse 
events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.
5.3.5.1 Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptoms
A diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than 
individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than 
jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs 
and/or symptoms cannot be medically character ized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events 
based on signs and symptoms should be n ullified and replaced by one adverse event 
report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting 
date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.
5.3.5.2 Adverse Events That A reSecondary  to Other Events
In general, advers e events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of 
severe or serious secondary events.  A medically significant secondary adverse event 
that is separate d in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent 
event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:
If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF.
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
104/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF.
If a severe GI hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.
If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.
If neutropenia is accompanied by an infection, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated.
5.3.5.3 Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between 
patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be 
recorded at the time the event is first reported.  If a persistent adverse event becomes 
more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF. If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see 
Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated 
bychanging the event from "non- serious" to "serious," providing the date that the event 
became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events.
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a 
separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF.
5.3.5.4 Abnormal Laboratory Values
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Is accompanied by clinical symptoms
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy
Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be ex ercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
105/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., ALP and bilirubin 5 ULN associated with cholestasis), o nly the diagnosis 
(i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a
descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range 
(e.g., "elevated potassium," as opposed to "abnormal potassium").  If the laboratory 
abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the
clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum 
potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as "hyperkalemia."
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should onl y be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.3 for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).
5.3.5.5 Abnormal Vital Sign Values
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must 
be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Is accompanied by clinical symptoms
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention or a chang e in concomitant therapy
Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be classified as an adverse event.
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF.
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.5 for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
106/Protocol GA30044 , Version 35.3.5.6 Abnormal Liver Function Tests
The fin ding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3ULN) in combination with either an elevated 
total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other 
causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as 
defined by Hy's law).  Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the 
occurrence of either of the following:
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with total bilirubin 
2ULN
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with clinical jaundice
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.4) 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event), either as a serious adverse event or an adverse event of special interest (see 
Section 5.4.2 ).
5.3.5.7 Deaths
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see 
Section 5.3.1 ), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ).  This 
includes death attributed to progression of lupus.
Death should be considered an outcome and not a disti nct event.  The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be 
reported.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of 
reporting, "unexplained death" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should 
be replaced by the established cause of death.   The term "sudden death" should not be 
used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac death").
If the death is attributed to progression of lupus, " systemic lupus erythematosus
progression" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as 
described in Section 5.6.
5.3.5.8 Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present a t the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  W hen 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
107/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept 
that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors 
(e.g., "more frequent headaches").
5.3.5.9 Lack of Ef ficacy  or Worsening of Lupus
Medical occurrences or symptoms of deterioration that are anticipated as part of lupus 
should be recorded as an adverse event if judged by the investigator to have 
unexpectedly worsened in severity or frequency or changed in na ture at any time during 
the study.  W hen recording an unanticipated worsening of lupus on the Adverse Event 
eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the condition has changed by including 
applicable descriptors (e.g., " accelerated systemic lupus erythematosus ").
5.3.5.10 Hospitalization or Prolonged Hospitalization
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization (i.e., inpatient admission to a hospital) 
or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse 
event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 ), except as outlined 
below.  
An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances should not be 
reported as an adverse event or a serious adverse event:
Hospitalization for respite care
Hospitalization for a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met:
The hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled during the 
study when elective surgery became necessary because of the expected 
normal pro gression of the disease
The patient has not experienced an adverse event
An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances is not 
considered to be a serious adverse event, but should be reported as an adverse event 
instead:
Hospitalization that was necessary because of patient requirement for outpatient 
care outside of normal outpatient clinic operating hours
5.3.5.11 Adverse Events A ssociated with an Overdose or Error in Drug 
Administration
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use o f a drug in an amount higher than the 
dose being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not itself 
an adverse event, but it may result in an adverse event.  All adverse events associated with 
an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be recorded on the Adverse 
Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills seriousness criteria, the event should 
be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the 
event; see Secti on5.4.2 ).  No safety data related to overdosing of GDC -0853 are available.
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
108/Protocol GA30044 , Version 35.3.5.12 Patient -Reported Outcome Data
Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data by the Sponsor, and safety 
analyses will not be performed using PRO data.  However, if any PRO responses 
suggestive of a possible adverse event are identified during site review of the PRO data, 
the investigator will determine whether the criteria for an adverse event have been met 
and, if so, will report the event on the Adverse Event eCRF.
5.4 IMMEDI ATE REPORTING REQUIR EMENTS FROM 
INVESTIGA TOR TO SPON SOR
Certain events require immediate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate 
measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial.  The investigator must report 
such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take 
place more than 24 hours after the investigator learns of the event.  The following is a list 
of events that the investigator must report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning 
of the event , regardless of relationship to study drug:
Serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for further details)
Adverse events of special interest (see Section 5.4.2 for further details)
Pregnancies (see Section 5.4.3 for further details)
The investigator must report new significant follow -up information for these events to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the 
information).  New significant information includes the following:
New signs or symptoms or a change in the d iagnosis
Significant new diagnostic test results
Change in causality based on new information
Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery
Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event
Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse 
events to the local health authority and IRB/EC.

5.4.2 Reporting Requirements for Serious A dverse Ev ents and 
Adverse Events of Special Interest
5.4.2.1 Events That Occur prior to Study  Drug Initiation
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention should be reported.  
The Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provided 
to investigators should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee 
immedi ately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either by faxing or 
by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to 
investigators.
5.4.2.2 Events That Occur after Study  Drug Initiation
After initiation of study drug, serious adverse events and adverse events of special 
interest will be reported until 8 weeks after the last dose of study drug the patients 
receives, either in this study or an OLE, if initiated. Investigators should record all case 
details that can be gathered immediately (i.e., within 24 hours after learning of the event) 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and submit the report via the electronic data capture (EDC) 
system.  A report will be generated and sent to Safety Risk Management by the EDC 
system.
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, the Serious Adverse Event/Adverse 
Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provided to investigators should be completed 
and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours 
after learning of the event), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using 
the fax number or email address provided to investigators.  Once the EDC system is 
available, all information will need to be entered and submitted via the EDC system.  
Instructions for reporting serious adverse events that occur after the last dose of study 
treatment are provided in Section 5.6.
5.4.3 Reporting Requirements for Pregnancies
5.4.3.1 Pregnancies in Female Patients
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed to immediately inform the 
investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within or within 8 weeks after 
the last dose of study drug, either in this study or an OLE, if initiated .  A Clinical Trial 
Pregnancy Reporting Form should be com pleted and submitted to the Sponsor or its 
designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), 
either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email 

GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
110/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3address provided to investigators.  Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse 
Event eCRF.  The investigator should discontinue study drug and counsel the patient, 
discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring 
of the patient should continue until conclu sion of the pregnancy.  Any serious adverse 
events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in the mother 
during or after the pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be 
reported on the Adverse Event eCRF.  In addition, the investigator will submit a Clinical 
Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated information on the course and outcome 
of the pregnancy becomes available.  
5.4.3.2 Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients
Male patients will be instru cted through the Informed Consent Form to immediately 
inform the investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the study or within 
120days (4 months) after the last dose of study drug.  A Clinical Trial Pregnancy 
Reporting Form should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee 
immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by 
faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address 
provided to investigators.  Attempts should be made to collect and report details of the 
course and outcome of any pregnancy in the partner of a male patient exposed to study 
drug.  When permitted by the site , the pregnant partner would need to sign an 
Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Pregna ncy Health Information to allow for 
follow -up on her pregnancy.  Ifthe authorization has been signed, the investigator 
should submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated information on 
the course and outcome of the pregnancy becomes avai lable.  An investigator who is 
contacted by the male patient or his pregnant partner may provide information on the 
risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus, to support an informed 
decision in cooperation with the treating physician and /or obstetrician.
5.4.3.3 Congenital A nomalies /Birth Defects and A bortions
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to study 
drug or the female partner of a male patient exposed to study drug should be classified 
as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see 
Section 5.4.2 ).  Any abortion should be reported in the same fashion (as the Sponsor 
considers abortio ns to be medically significant).
5.5 FOLLOW -UP OF PA TIENTS A FTER ADVERSE EVENTS
5.5.1 Investigator Follow -Up
The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline 
grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigat or, the patient is lost to 
follow -up, or the patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to follow all 
serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial -related procedures 
until a final outcome can be reported.
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
111/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3During the s tudy period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilitate source data 
verification.
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy o utcome.
5.5.2 Sponsor Follow -Up
For serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest, and pregnancies, the 
Sponsor or a designee may follow up by telephone, fax, electronic mail, and/or a 
monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome i nformation (e.g., from 
hospital discharge summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform 
an independent medical assessment of the reported case.
5.6 ADVERSE EVENTS THA T OCCUR AFTER THE A DVERSE 
EVENT REPORTING PERI OD
The Sponsor should be n otified if the investigator becomes aware of any serious 
adverse event that occurs after the end of the adverse event reporting period (defined as 
8 weeks after the last dose of study drug the patients receives, either in this study or an 
OLE, if initiated ), if the event is believed to be related to prior study drug treatment.  
These events should be reported through use of the Adverse Event eCRF.  However, if 
the EDC system is not available, the investigator should report these events directly to 
the Sponsor or its designee, either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the Serious 
Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form using the fax number 
or email address provided to investigators.
5.7 EXPEDITED REPORTING TO HEA LTH AUTHORITIE S, 
INVESTIG ATORS, INSTITUTIONA LREVIEW BOA RDS, A ND 
ETHICS COMMITTEES
The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all serious adverse events and adverse events of 
special interest against cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously 
communicate possible new safe ty findings to investigators, IRBs, ECs, and applicable 
health authorities based on applicable legislation.
To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events using the GDC -0853 I nvestigator’s Brochure.
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event 
frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the 
applicable reference document.
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed.
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
112/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3An unblinded IMC and Scientific Oversight Committee will monitor the incidence of 
adverse events during the study.  An aggregate report of an y clinically relevant 
imbalances that do not favor the test product will be submitted to health authorities.
6. STATISTICA L CONSIDERA TIONS AND ANAL YSIS PLA N
Details of all statistical methods (including scoring of disease -activity or PRO 
instruments and missing data handling) will be provided in the Data Analysis Plan (DAP) .
6.1 DETERMINA TION OF SA MPLE SIZE
The purpose of this study is estimation and hypothesis generation regarding the effect of 
GDC- 0853 on W eek 48SRI-4 response rate relative to placebo in m oderate to severe 
active SLE patients and a biomarker -defined subgroup of patients . A total of 
240patients will be randomly allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive one of two doses of 
GDC- 0853 (200 mg BID GDC -0853 [Arm A ] or 150 mg QD GDC -0853 [Arm B ]) or 
placebo (Arm C).  This sample size will provide approximately 88% power at a 2-sided 
0.05 significance level to detect a 25% absolute improvement in the response rate for a 
GDC- 0853 containing arm relative to the placebo arm assuming a placebo 
response -rate of 50 %.Patients without post -baseline response assessments will be 
treated as non -responders.  For an evaluation of efficacy in a subgroup defined by a 
predictive biomarker with 50% prevalence, the total sample -size of 80 patients per arm 
provides approximately 80% power to detect a 25% improvement with 2-sided 0.20
significance level , using the Fisher’s Exact Test. No adjustment for multiple 
comparisons will be made.
6.2 SUMMA RIES OF CONDUCT OF STUDY
The final analysis will be based upon patient data collected through patient 
discontinuation or study discontinuation, whichever occurs first.  The number of patients 
who enroll, discontinue, or complete the study will be summarized.  Reasons for 
premature study withdrawal will be listed and summarized.  En rollment and major 
protocol deviations will be listed and evaluated for their potential effects on the 
interpretation of study results.  All summaries will be presented according to randomized 
treatment assignment.
6.3 SUMMA RIES OF TREA TME NT GROUP COMPA RABILITY
Treatment group comparability will be analyzed.  Demographic and baseline 
characteristics such as age, sex, weight, and disease activity will be summarized by 
treatment group.  For categorical variables, the descriptive statistics will include counts 
andproportions.  For continuous variables, the descriptive statistics will include the 
number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum 
values.  
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
113/Protocol GA30044 , Version 36.4 EFFICA CY ANAL YSES
Efficacy analysis will be conducted for the intent -to-treat population, defined as all 
randomly allocated patients.  Sensitivity analyses of additional study population (e.g., 
completers, or per protocol [excluding major protocol violators]) may also be performed
for the primary endpoint or key secondary endpoints and will be detailed in the DAP .  
Biomarker -defined subgroup analyses will also be performed to identify subsets of 
patients who derive enhanced clinical benefit from GDC -0583.  The focus of the 
subgroup efficacy analyses is on ,but not limited to,subgroups defined by plasmablast 
signature levels.
Statistical tests will be conducted at the 0.05 significance level for the intent -to-treat (ITT)
population and at the 0.20 significance level for plasmablast -signature defined 
subgroups.  No multiplicity adjustments will be made to control the overall Type I error, 
and positive tests will be viewed as hypothesis generating rather than confirmatory.
6.4.1 Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint
The primary efficac y endpoint for this study is SRI -4 response at Week 48.
The p rimary endpoint will be compared between each of the two GDC -0853 arms and 
the placebo arm by using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test statistic, stratified by the 
factors used at randomization. The absolute difference in remission rates and 95% CI 
for the p oint estimate will be provided.
6.4.2 Secondary  Efficacy Endpoints
The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are as follows:
 SRI-4 response at Week 48 with a sustained reduction of OCS dose to 10mg/day 
and Day 1 dose during Week 36 through Week 48
 SRI-4 response at Week 24 with a sustained reduction of OCS dose to 10mg/day 
and Day 1 dose during Week 12 through Week 24

Exploratory endpoints will be evaluated for the ITT population.  Time -to-event endpoints 
will be analyzed using the Kaplan -Meier methodology.  Continuous endpoints will be 
analyzed using an appropriate analysis method, such as analysis of covariance, or 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
115/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3mixed -model repeated measures.  Categorical endpoints will be analyzed using an 
appropriate statistical method, such as Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel or Fisher’s exact test.
6.5 SAFETY ANAL YSES
Safety analyses will include all patients who receive at least one dose of study drug 
(GDC -0853 or placebo) with patients grouped according to the treatment they received.  
Safety will be assessed through summaries of adverse events, laboratory test results, 
ECGs, and vital signs.  Verbatim descriptions of treatment -emergent adverse events will 
be coded, and their incidence will be summarized by treatment arm.  A 
treatment -emergent adverse event is defined as any new adverse eve nt reported or 
worsening of an existing condition on or after the first dose of study drug during AE 
reporting period.  In addition, separate summaries will be generated for serious adverse 
events, AESI, deaths, pregnancies, malignancies, adverse events le ading to 
discontinuation from the study, and adverse events leading to discontinuation of study 
drug.
6.6 PHA RMA COKINETIC A NALYSES
The PK analyses will include tabulation of plasma concentration data and 
summarization of plasma concentrations by visits, with p atients grouped according to 
treatment received.  Descriptive summary statistics will include the arithmetic mean, 
median, range, SD, and coefficient of variation, as appropriate.
The extent of inter -patient variability will be evaluated, and potential sou rces of variability 
may be assessed.  Relationships between PK and PD, efficacy, and safety endpoints 
may be explored.
Additional PK analyses will be conducted during and/or at the end of the study as 
appropriate and may be reported separately .
6.7 BIOMA RKER ANAL YSES
PD biomarkers (e.g., but not limited to CCL3, CCL4, and plasmablast signature) will be 
analyzed to assess the pharmacological activity and mechanism of action of GDC -0853 in 
patients with moderate to severe active SLE.  Data will be summarized by absolute 
levels of the biomarker, as well as absolute and relative changes from baseline levels for 
each treatment group. Additional PD analyses may be conducted as appropriate.  
6.8 INTERIM A NALYSIS
An interim analysis will be performed after 5080 patient s in each of treatment arm have
completed their 24- week SRI-4 response evaluation.  The purpose of the interim 
analysis is to conduct a preliminary benefit -risk assessment of GDC -0853 treated arms 
compared with the placebo -treated arm and enable potential stopping for futility and/or 
safety concerns or to potentially inform the clinical development plan for GDC- 0853 .The 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
116/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3interim analysis will be performed and interpreted by the IMC in conjunction with a 
Scientific Oversight Committee who will be unblinded at the treatment group level.  
Additional personnel ,such as Clinical Pharmacology and biomarker scientists ,may be 
unblinded in order to prepare additional data displays relevant for IMC and Scientific 
Oversight Committee review.
The study will continue to enroll while the interim analysis is being performed.  If the 
interim analysis indicates that one of the two dose levels of GDC -0853 does not have an 
appropriate safety profile or meets futility criteria as defined in the interim analysis plan 
in the DA P which will be written prior to conducting the interim analysis, the Sponsor 
may discontinue enrollment into that dose arm and switch patients to the other dose arm 
for the remainder of the study.  The Sponsor may also elect to amend the protocol to 
change the dose level of GDC -0853.   
Given the hypothesis -generating nature of this study, the Sponsor may choose to 
conduct an additional efficacy interim efficacy analysis in order to further guide internal 
decision making around issues such a sthe adeq uacy of dose ranging, the adequacy of 
sample sizes for safety and/or efficacy analyses, or to inform the clinical development 
plan for GDC -0853 . The study will not be stopped for any other reason other than futility 
or safety concerns at the time of the i nterim analysis.   The interim analysis will be 
performed and interpreted by the IMC in conjunction with a Scientific Oversight 
Committee who will be unblinded at the treatment group level.  Additional personnel, 
such as Clinical Pharmacology and biomarker scientists, may be unblinded in order to 
prepare additional data displays relevant for IMC and Scientific Oversight Committee
review.   The decision to conduct an additio nal interim analysis and the timing of the 
analysis will be documented in the Sponsor’s trial master file and updated DAP prior to 
the conduct of the interim analysis .
Further details about the interim analyses , including the IMC and Scientific Oversight 
Committee responsibilities and decision criteria, will be specified in the IMC and 
Scientific Oversight Committee Charter.  
7. DATA COLLECTION A ND M ANAG EMENT
7.1 DATA QUA LITY ASSURA NCE
The Sponsor will be responsible for data management of this study, including quality 
checking of the data.  Data entered manually will be collected via EDC thro ugh use of 
eCRFs.  Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system.  In the event of 
discrepant data, the Sponsor or its designee will request data clarification from the sites, 
which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system.
The Sponsor or functional service provider will produce an EDC Study Specification 
document that describes the quality checking to be performed on the data.  Central 
laboratory data and any other electronic data will be sent directly to the Sponsor, using 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
117/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3the Sponsor’s standard procedures to handle and process the electronic transfer of 
these data.
eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail.  
System backups for data stored by the Sponsor and records retention for the study data 
will be consistent with the Sponsor’s standard procedures.
PRO data will be collected on paper questionnaires.  The data from the questionnaires 
will be entered into the EDC system by site staff.
7.2 ELECTRONIC CA SE REPO RT FORMS 
eCRFs are to be completed through use of a Sponsor -designated EDC system.  Sites 
will receive training and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion.  
eCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in 
accordance with instructions from the Sponsor.
All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff.  eCRFs should be 
reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee.
At the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a 
readable format on a compact disc that must be kept with the study records.  
Acknowledgement of receipt of the compact disc is required.
7.3 SOURCE DA TA DOCUMENT ATION
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm tha t critical 
protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site personnel are 
accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents. 
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded 
and document ed for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, PROs , evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies of 
transcrip tions that are certified after verification as being accurate and complete, 
microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, patient files, 
and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico- technical departments 
involved in a clinical trial.
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan.  This includes any protocol data to be 
entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electro nic record of the data) and 
considered source data.
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
118/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per 
the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.5.
To facilitate source data verification, the investigators and institutions must provide the 
Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial -related 
monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The stu dy site must also allow 
inspection by applicable health authorities.
7.4 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS
When clinical observations are entered directly into a study site’s computerized medical 
record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electr onic record can serve 
as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health 
authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research.  An 
acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservat ion of the original entry 
of data.  If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail 
that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name of the person 
making the change, and date of the change.
7.5 RETENTION OF RECORDS
Records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of 
IMP, including eCRFs, electronic PRO data (if applicable), Informed Consent Forms, 
laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by the 
Principal Investigator for at least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the 
study or for the length of time required by relevant national or local health authorities, 
whichever is longer.  After that period of time, the documents may be destroyed, subject 
to local regulations.  
No records may be disposed of without the written approval of the Sponsor.  W ritten 
notification should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to 
another party or moving them to another locat ion.

European Union (E.U.) Clinical Trial Directive (2001/20/EC).
8.2 INFORMED CONSENT
The Sponsor’s sample Informed Consent Form (and ancillary sample Informed Consent 
Forms such as a Child’s Informe d Assent Form or Mobile Nursing Informed Consent 
Form, if applicable) will be provided to each site.  If applicable, it will be provided in a 
certified translation of the local language.  The Sponsor or its designee must review and 
approve any proposed dev iations from the Sponsor's sample Informed Consent Forms 
or any alternate consent forms proposed by the site (collectively, the "Consent Forms") 
before IRB/EC submission.  The final IRB/EC approved Consent Forms must be 
provided to the Sponsor for health authority submission purposes according to local 
requirements.
If applicable, the Informed Consent Form will contain separate sections for any optional 
procedures.  The investigator or authorized designee will explain to each patient the 
objectives, method s, and potential risks associated with each optional procedure.  
Patients will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their 
consent at any time for any reason.  A separate, specific signature will be required to 
document a pat ient's agreement to participate in optional procedures.  Patients who 
decline to participate will not provide a separate signature.
The Consent Forms must be signed and dated by the patient before his or her 
participation in the study.  The case history or clinical records for each patient shall 
document the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained 
prior to participation in the study.
The Consent Forms should be revised whenever there are changes to study procedures 
or when new information becomes available that may affect the willingness of the patient 
to participate.  The final revised IRB/EC -approved Consent Forms must be provided to 
the Sponsor for health authority submission purposes.
Patients must be re -consented to the m ost current version of the Consent Forms (or to a 
significant new information/findings addendum in accordance with applicable laws and 
IRB/EC policy) during their participation in the study.  For any updated or revised 
Consent Forms, the case history or cl inical records for each patient shall document the 
informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained using the 
updated/revised Consent Forms for continued participation in the study.
A copy of each signed Consent Form must be provided to the patient or the patient’s 
legally authorized representative.  All signed and dated Consent Forms must remain in 
each patient’s study file or in the site file and must be available for verification by study 
monitors at any time.
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
120/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3For sites in the United States, each Consent Form may also include patient authorization 
to allow use and disclosure of personal health information in compliance with the U.S. 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996.  If the site utilizes a 
separate Authorization Form for patient authorization for use and disclosure of personal 
health information under the HIPAA regulations, the review, approval, and other 
processes outlined above apply except that IRB review and approval may not be 
required per study site policies.
8.3 INSTITUTIONA L REVIEW BOA RD OR ETHICS COMMITTEE
This protocol, the Informed Consent Forms, any information to be given to the patient, 
and relevant supporting information must be submitted to the IRB/EC by the Principal 
Investigator and reviewed and approved by the IRB/EC before the study is initiated.  
Inaddition, any patient recruitment materials must be approved by the IRB/EC. 
The Principal Investigator is responsible for providing written summaries of the status of 
the study to the IRB/EC annually or more frequently in accordance with the requirements, 
policies, and procedures established by the IRB/EC.  Investigators are also responsible 
for promptly informing the IRB/EC of any protocol amendments (see Section 9.6).
In addition to the requirements for reporting all adverse events to the Sponsor, 
investigators must comply with requirements for reporting serious adverse events to the 
local health authority and IRB/EC.  Investigators may receive written IND safety reports 
or other safe ty-related communications from the Sponsor.  Investigators are responsible 
for ensuring that such reports are reviewed and processed in accordance with health 
authority requirements and the policies and procedures established by their IRB/EC, and 
archived in the site’s study file. 
8.4 CONFIDENTIA LITY
The Sponsor maintains confidentiality standards by coding each patient enrolled in the 
study through assignment of a unique patient identification number.  This means that 
patient names are not included in data se ts that are transmitted to any Sponsor location.
Patient medical information obtained by this study is confidential and may be disclosed 
to third parties only as permitted by the Informed Consent Form (or separate 
authorization for use and disclosure of pe rsonal health information) signed by the patient, 
unless permitted or required by law.
Medical information may be given to a patient’s personal physician or other appropriate 
medical personnel responsible for the patient’s welfare, for treatment purposes.
Given the complexity and exploratory nature of the analyses, data derived from 
exploratory biomarker specimens will generally not be provided to study investigators or 
patients unless required by law.  The aggregate results of any conducted research will 
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
121/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3be available in accordance with the effective Sponsor policy on study data publication 
(see Section 9.5).
Data generated by this study must be available for inspection upon request by 
representatives of national and local health authorities, Sponsor monitor s, 
representatives, and collaborators, and the IRB/EC for each study site, as appropriate.
8.5 FINA NCIA L DISCLOSURE
Investigators will provide the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial information in 
accordance with local regulations to allow the Sponsor to submit complete and accurate 
financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate health authorities.  
Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the 
course of the study and for 1 year after com pletion of the study (i.e., last patient, last visit 
[LPLV]).
9. STUDY DOCUMENTATION, MONITORING, A ND 
ADMINISTRA TION
9.1 STUDY DOCUMENTATION
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of 
the study to be fully documented, including, but not limited to, the protocol, protocol 
amendments, Informed Consent Forms, and documentation of IRB/EC and 
governmental approval.  In addition, at the end of the study, the investigator will receive 
the patient data, including an audit trail c ontaining a complete record of all changes to 
data.
9.2 PROTOCOL DEVIA TION S
The investigator should document and explain any protocol deviation s.  The investigator 
should promptly report any deviation s that might have an impact on patient safety and 
data integ rity to the Sponsor and to the IRB/EC in accordance with established IRB/EC 
policies and procedures.   The Sponsor will review all protocol deviations and assess 
whether any represent a serious breach of Good Clinical Practice guidelines and require 
reporti ng to health authorities. As per the Sponsor's standard operating procedures, 
prospective requests to deviate from the protocol, including requests to waive protocol 
eligibility criteria, are not allowed.
9.3 SITE INSPECTIONS
Site visits will be conducted by the Sponsor or an authorized representative for 
inspection of study data, subjects’ medical records, and eCRFs.  The investigator will 
permit national and local health authorities; Sponsor monitors, representatives, and 
collaborators; and the IRBs/ECs to i nspect facilities and records relevant to this study.
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
122/Protocol GA30044 , Version 39.4 ADMINISTRA TIVE STRUC TURE
The study will be conducted globally and include approximately 240 patients.  The 
contract research organization  will be responsible for submission to IRB/ECs 
for appr oval of the study protocol, patient recruitment, study conduct, data collection, 
and reporting.
9.5 PUBLICA TION OF DATA  AND PROTECTION OF TR ADE 
SECRETS
Regardless of the outcome of a trial, the Sponsor is dedicated to openly providing 
information on the trial to healthcare professionals and to the public, both at scientific 
congresses and in peer -reviewed journals. The Sponsor will comply with all 
requirements for publication of study results.  For more information, refer to the Roche 
Global Policy on Sharing of Clinical Trials Data at the following W eb site:
http://www.roche.com/roche_global_policy_on_sharing_of_clinical_study_information.p
df
The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific congresses.  For all 
clinical trials in patients involving an IMP for which a marketing authorization ap plication 
has been filed or approved in any country, the Sponsor aims to submit a journal 
manuscript reporting primary clinical trial results within 6 months after the availability of 
the respective CSR.  In addition, for all clinical trials in patients in volving an IMP for 
which a marketing authorization application has been filed or approved in any country, 
the Sponsor aims to publish results from analyses of additional endpoints and 
exploratory data that are clinically meaningful and statistically sound.
The investigator must agree to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the Sponsor prior 
to submission for publication or presentation.  This allows the Sponsor to protect 
proprietary information and to provide comments based on information from other 
studies that may not yet be available to the investigator.
In accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the Sponsor will generally 
support publication of multicenter trials only in their entirety and not as individual center 
data.  In this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement.
Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with International 
Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements.  Any formal publication 
of the study in whic h contribution of Sponsor personnel exceeded that of conventional 
monitoring will be considered as a joint publication by the investigator and the 
appropriate Sponsor personnel.
Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know -how originatin g from 
the use of data from this study will become and remain the exclusive and unburdened 
property of the Sponsor, except where agreed otherwise.

return for the SFU visit on W eek 56 (8 weeks after last dose of study drug). For patients enrollng i nto the OLE Study GA30066, Day 1 is the same day 
as the W eek 48 visit of Study GA30044.
dAt an unscheduled visit (UV), adverse events and concomitant medications must be assessed. All other assessments are to be pe rformed only if 
medically indicated based on the reason for the UV. If the patient returns for an unscheduled visit or regular study visit and has any evidence of 
increased SLE -activity requiring treatment, perform assessments required for a flare visit (FV).   
eA flare visit (FV) is any unscheduled visit where the patient may require escalation of treatment for increased SLE activity.   Assessments are to be 
performed only if medically indicated based on the reason for the FV.
fPatients will receive a telephone call from study staff to follow up for assessment of adverse events.
gEither the ACR or SLICC diagnostic criteria for SLE may be used at screening to determine study inclusion.
hStarting at the screening period, all patients must record their actual OCS use on a weekly basis and as instructed by study staff (see Section 4.3.2.4 ).
iThe OCS taper windows occur during Weeks 0- 12 and Weeks 24-36 (tapering may be initiated after the Week 24 assessments are completed).  For 
complete instructions on OCS tapering, see Section 3.3.6 and Appendix 4.
jAfter informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only serious adverse events caused by a proto col-mandated intervention 
should be reported.  After initiation of study drug, all adverse events will be reported until 8 weeks after the last dose of study drug.  After this period, 
the Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any serious adver se event that is believed to be related to prior study drug 
treatment (see Section 5.6).  The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, th e event is 
assessed as stable by the investigator, the p atient is lost to follow -up, or the patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to follow all 
serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial -related procedures until a final outcome can be reported.
kIncludes respiratory rate, pulse rate, temperature, and sy stolic and diastolic blood pressures while the patient is in a seated positi on for at least 
5minutes.

genitourinar y, and neurological s ystems.  Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical Hi story  and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.  Particular attention should be given to evaluation of potential manifestations of active SLE (see Appendix 9BILAG 2004 Index; 
Appendix 10, SLEDAI -2K; Appendix 14, CLASI; and Appendix 13, 28-Joint Counts , Appendix 11, SFI ) and of infections or other medical conditions, 
which could place the patient at increased risk.
mLimited, efficacy assessment directed or sy mptom-directed physical examinations should be performed that also allow for completion of SLEDAI -2K 
and BILAG -2004 assessments .  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in pat ient notes.  New orworsened clinically significant 
abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.
nFor visits at which study drug is administered, the ECG will be recorded pre -dose (Day 1, W eek 4 and W eek 48) .  ECG recordin gs must be performed 
after the patient has been resting in a supine position for at least 10 minutes prior to beginning the first ECG recording.  All ECGs should be obtained 
prior to the other procedures scheduled at that same time (e.g., vital sign measurements, blood draws).  Body position should be consistently

Pre-Enrollment A djudication 
Enrollment into this trial is subject to adjudication by the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or 
designated staff.  
The purpose of the adjudication process is to ensure that clinical manifestations 
qualifying the patient for entry to the study (i) are adequately documented, (ii) are 
attributable to SLE, and (iii) are of sufficient severity to mandate significant 
immunomodulatory therapy.
The Medical Monitor will make the final decision regarding whether or not a patient is 
eligible for enrollment. Every effort will be made to complete the adjudication process as 
quickly as possible.   In exceptional circumstances the screening period may, at the 
Medical Monitor’s discretion, be extended to allow for completion of the adjudication 
process. 
Steps in A djudication Process
3.Investigative site identifies a potentially eligible patient.
4.Following informed consent, the Investigator reviews the patient for eligibility based 
on SLE diagnostic criteria, trial inclusion criteria (see Section 4.1.1 ), and the 
absence of exclusion criteria.
5. As soon as screening procedures are complete th e Investigator completes the forms 
required for screening and adjudication .  
6.The Investigator or Study Coordinator transmits the completed forms to the Sponsor 
or designated contract research organization.  
7. The Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or designee will perform an initial triage of the 
disease manifestations contributing to eligibility for entry.  The triage decision will be 
based on the information suppl ied by the Investigator .  This period may be extended 
if there is a delay in the availability of key s creening laboratory results from the 
central laboratory. 
8.The Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or designee will review the patient’s clinical and 
laboratory data, including additional data requested from the site, and reach a 
decision on the patient’s eligibility for the study. This decision will be conveyed to 
the Investigator within approximately 3 working days of receipt of the requested 
additional data by the Sponsor.
Training in the Adjudication process will be provided to Investigators.

Childbearing Potential, Pregnancy  Testing, and Contraception
For Women
All women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation) will 
have a serum pregnancy test at screening and a urine pregnancy test on study day 1 
prior to administration of study drug and at subsequent clinic visits.  If a urine pregnancy 
test result is positive, study drug will not be administered until pregnancy is ruled out.  
The result must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test (conducted by the local 
laboratory).
Refer to Section 5.4.3 of the protocol for management of a patient with a confirmed 
pregnancy.
All female patients are considered to be of childbearing potential unless they meet one 
of the following criteria:
The patient has been postmenopausal (non −therapy -induced amenorrhea) for at 
least 12 continuous months with no other identified cause
The patient had a surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) 
more than 6 weeks prior to enrollment
The patient had a hysterectomy
Female patients of reproductive or childbearing potential who are unwilling to use a
method of contraception that results in a failure rate of 1 % per year or remain 
abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) during the treatment period and for at 
least 60 days afte r the last dose of study drug, or longer as required by local 
requirements for other standard of care medications, will be excluded from study 
participation.
Abstinence is acceptable only if it is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
patient.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post -ovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.
Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 1% per year include the
following:
Sterilization, bilateral surgical tubal ligation
Intrauterine device
Combined oral contraceptive pill*
Contraceptive transdermal patch (estrogen and progestin containing)*
Hormonal vaginal device
Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation
Implants for contraception
Appendix 8
Childbearing Potential, Pregnancy  Testing, and Contraception
(cont.)
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
150/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3Injections for contraception (with prolonged release)
Sole sexual partner consisting of surgically sterilized male partner with appropriate 
postsurgical verification of the absence of spermatozoa in the ejacul ate.  Patients 
may provide verbal confirmation that the partner completed appropriate follow -up 
after vasectomy.  Sites are not required to obtain partner medical records.
Same sex partner
*Women using estrogen containing hormonal contraceptives as a met hod of 
contraception must also use a barrier such as a male condom in conjunction 
with the hormonal contraceptives.
For Men
All men must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use 
contraceptive measures and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined 
below:
With female partners of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal 
ligation), men must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional 
contraceptiv e method that together result in a failure rate of 1% per year during the 
treatment period and for at least 120 days (4 months) after the last dose of study 
treatment.  Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.
With pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during 
the treatment period and for at least 28 days after the last dose of study treatment to 
avoid exposing the embryo.
For Men and Women
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., 
calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, and post -ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not 
acceptable methods of contraception.

     only record features that are attributable to SLE disease activity and not due to 
        damage, infection, thrombosis (in absence of inflammatory process) or other 
        conditions
     assessment refers to manifestations occurring in the last 4 weeks compared with the 
        previous 4 weeks
     activity r efers to disease process which is reversible while damage refers to permanent 
        process/scarring (irreversible)
     damage due to SLE should be considered as a cause of features that are fixed/persistent 
        (SLICC/ACR damage index uses pe rsistence 6 months to define damage)
     in some manifestations, it may be difficult to differentiate SLE from other 
conditions as there may not be any specific test and the decision would then lies with the 
physician’s judgement on the balance of probabilities
     ophthalmic manifestations usually need to be assessed by an ophthalmologist and these 
        items would need to be recorded after receiving the response from the ophthalmologist
     guidance for recording:
          (4) NEW 
                 manifestations are recorded as new when it is a new episode occurring in the last  
                    4 weeks (compared to the previous 4 weeks) that has not improved and this 
                    includes new episodes (recurrence) of old manifestations 
                 new episode occurring in the last 4 weeks but also satisfying the criteria for    
                    improvement (below) would be classified as improving instead of new
          (3) WORSE
                 this refers to manifestations that have deteriorated/worsened significantly in the 
                    last 4 weeks compared to the previous 4 weeks, sufficient for consideration of 
                    increase in therapy
          (2) SAME
                 this refers to manifestations that have been present for the last 4 weeks and the

171/Protocol GA30044, Version 3 GUIDELINES FOR USE OF SLEDAI -2K MODIFIED FOR ASSESSMENT OVER 
28 DAYS: TO ASSESS DISEASE ACTIVITY  
General guidelines for filling out the SLEDAI -2K: 
• The main principle to keep in mind is that this instrument is intended to 
evaluate current lupus activity and not chronic damage, severity is 
accounted for in part by the "weightedness" of the scale.  
• Points are given exactly as defined.  
• A descriptor is either scored the exact points allotted or not scored, i.e. 
given a zero. Descriptors are scored only if they are present at the time of 
the physician encounter or in the preceding 28 days. Windows acceptable 
in a clinical trial are acceptable in scoring the SLEDAI. However, it is 
never acceptable to fill in gaps which cover activity over 2- 3 months or 
more. The reason for this is that disease activity at the visit might have 
changed several times in such intervals and the recording of distant 
activity becomes meaningless.  
 
Please note that in the original SLEDAI the disease activity being scored 
was meant to cover only a ten day period, the modification to 28 days is a 
more useful assessment for use in clinical trials, in order to capture 
disease activity between monthly visits.  
• The descriptor must be documented by the notes written in the physician 
encounter form and generally applies to the clinical data and not to the 
laboratory data. The laboratory data is strictly defined as per cutoffs  and 
documentation is provided by the reports from the commercial laboratory.  
• Descriptors do not have to be new but can be. They can be ongoing, 
recurrent, or initial events. Each would be scored the same way. An 
example would be a malar rash or mucosal ulcer. In these situations a 
malar rash observed at the initial visit but which remains unchanged for 
the next six months, irrespective of any treatment, is scored 2 points each 
time the SLEDAI is completed. Since the nature of lupus is that 
manifestations are not usually fleeting it would be rare for descriptors to 
appear transiently during the month and not at the time of the encounter. 
This is discussed in more detail for each descriptor but is especially 
relevant for the neurologic (except for seizure or  CVA), pulmonary, and 
cutaneous manifestations.  
 
 
Appendix  10  
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index  
(SLEDAI -2K) (cont.)  
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.  
172/Protocol GA30044, Version 3 • In some descriptors the exclusions written may not be exhaustive. The 
intent of the SLEDAI is that the descriptor be attributed to SLE. If the 
physician does not attribute the descriptor to SLE it should not  be scored, 
but full documentation must be provided.  
Written in italics is the definition for each descriptor precisely provided in the 
SLEDAI SCORE  
SEIZURE  
Definition: Recent onset (last 28 days). Exclude metabolic, infectious or drug 
cause, or seizure due to past irreversible CNS damage.  
This descriptor is scored if the patient has had a witnessed seizure or convincing 
description (such as tongue biting or incontinence) within 30 days of the current 
encounter. The patient need not have a positive EEG, CT scan, PET scan, 
QEEG, or MRI. The CSF may be totally normal.  
A seizure is also not counted:  
1. If a metabolic cause is determined.  
2. In the presence of a proven infectious meningitis, brain abscess, or fungal 
foci. 
3. If there is a history of recent head trauma.  
4. In the presence of an offending drug.  
5. In the presence of severe hyperthermia or hypothermia.  
6. If the patient has stopped taking anticonvulsant medication.  
7. If the patient has a documented sub- therapeutic anticonvulsant drug level.  
PSYCHOSIS 
Definition: Altered ability to function in normal activity due to severe disturbance 
in the perception of reality. Include hallucinations, incoherence, marked loose 
associations, impoverished thought content, marked illogical thinking, bizarre, 
disorganized, or catatonic behavior. Exclude uremia and drug causes.  
This descriptor is scored if any of the criteria above are met.  
With regard to drug causes the most problematic situation is glucocorticoids. If 
the treating physician attributes the psychosis to glucocorticoids this descriptor 
should not be counted.

(SLEDAI-2K) (cont.)  
GDC-0853—Genentech, Inc. 
173/Protocol GA30044, Version 3 ORGANIC BRAIN SYNDROME  
Definition: Altered mental function with impaired orientation, memory or other 
intellectual function, with rapid onset and fluctuating clinical features. Include 
clouding of consciousness with reduced capacity  to focus, and inability to sustain 
attention to environment, plus at l east two of the following: perceptual 
disturbance, incoherent speech, insomnia or  daytime drowsiness, or increased or 
decreased psychomotor activity. Exclude me tabolic, infectious or drug causes. 
a. reduced capacity to focus as exemp lified by new inability to perform 
everyday mathematical computations or disorientation to person, place, 
time, or purpose 
 
OR 
b. inability to carry on a conversation 
 
OR 
c. reduction in s hort term memory 
PLUS: Documented abnormality on neuropsychiatric testing  
Neuropsychiatric testing may take the form  of a "mini-mental-status exam" or a 
formal neuropsychiatric examination. T he important aspect for scoring OBS is 
that it be reversible. Cons ideration should be given to  the improvement of OBS 
after institution of glucocorticoids. 
This descriptor is not scored in the pres ence of a metabolic, infectious, or drug 
cause. If the problem is chronic this de scriptor is not scored in SLEDAI but is 
scored on the damage index.  
VISUAL DISTURBANCE  
Definition: Retinal and eye changes of  SLE. Include cytoid bodies, retinal 
hemorrhages, serous exudate or hemorrhages in the choroid, or optic neuritis. 
Exclude hypertension, infection or drug causes. 
This is scored exactly as defined wit h the understanding that it must be 
supported by objective evidence. 
CRANIAL NERVE DISORDER  
Definition: New onset of sensory or mo tor neuropathy involving cranial nerves. 
Include vertigo due to lupus. 
 
 
Appendix 10  
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index  
(SLEDAI-2K) (cont.)  
GDC-0853—Genentech, Inc. 
174/Protocol GA30044, Version 3 This is scored exactly as defined wit h the understanding that it must be 
supported by objective evidence. However, it should be noted that 
hydroxychloroquine can affect  the eighth cranial nerve. 
LUPUS HEADACHE  
Definition: Severe persistent headache:  may be migrainous, but must be non-
responsive to narcotic analgesia. 
For this descriptor to be counted, the headache must be present for greater than 
24 hours and must not be responsive to narcotic analgesia. Objective 
documentation need not be present although it is expected that such a complaint, 
given the severity, would prompt forma l testing such as MRI, CT, LP, etc. 
Furthermore, the headache should be of suff icient severity to warrant the 
initiation of glucocorticoids or additi onal immunosuppressive agents. Scoring of 
this descriptor means attribut ion of the headache to CNS lupus. 
Most headaches, including most severe and/or migrainous headaches are 
not attributable to lupus  and this descriptor should only be scored very 
rarely. 
CVA  
Definition: New onset of cerebrovascular accident (s). Exclude arteriosclerosis or 
hypertensive causes. 
This descriptor is scored if the pati ent has had a CVA within 28 days of the 
current encounter. A patient recovering from a CVA that was documented more 
than 28 days prior to the curr ent encounter is not given poi nts for this descriptor. 
A patient may have had a previous CVA but  to be scored the current CVA must 
be new. 
This descriptor is scored in the pr esence or absence of anti-phospholipid 
antibodies, i.e., the precise pathophysiologic mec hanism need not be known. 
The CVA is scored even in the presence of  a normal CT or MRI. A TIA is also 
scored if the patient gives a convincing hi story. To exclude atherosclerosis the 
patient has to have a normal carotid and/ or vertebral Doppler and cannot have 
uncontrolled hypertension.

175/Protocol GA30044, Version 3 VASCULITIS:  
Definition: Ulceration, gangrene, tender finger nodules, periungual infarction, 
splinter hemorrhages, or biopsy or angiogram proof of vasculitis.  
To score this descriptor the above definitions must be present. For example, 
erythematous lesions on the hands or feet which may be characteristically 
considered "leukocytoclastic vasculitis" but do not fulfill at least one of the above 
definitions and if not biopsied, are not counted. Similarly livedo reticularis is not 
counted. Healed ulcers with residual scar are not to be counted, but be sure to 
count these in the damage index. A lesion consistent with erythema nodosum 
should be counted regardless of whether it is biopsied or not. Purpura in the 
presence of a normal platelet count should be counted regardless of whether it 
has been biopsied or not.  
ARTHRITIS 
Definition: Two or more joints with pain and signs of inflammation, i.e., 
tenderness, swelling, or effusion.  
Arthritis is scored if it is ongoing; it need not be new or recurrent.  
Arthritis  is scored only if at least two  joints manifest signs of inflammation. The 
rheumatologist must be convinced that this is active arthritis due to lupus.  
Inflammation of the tendons, ligaments, bursae, and other periarticular structures 
are not scored. For example subacromial bursitis and trochanteric bursitis are not 
scored. If further evaluation reveals osteonecrosis or osteoarthritis, this 
descriptor is not counted.  
MYOSITIS  
Definition: Proximal muscle aching/weakness, associated with elevated creatine 
phosphokinase/aldolase or electromyogram changes or a biopsy showing 
myositis. 
The patient complains of muscle aching and/or weakness in the proximal 
muscles PLUS one of the following must be present:  
1. elevated serum creati nine phosphokinase and/or aldolase 
2. abnormalities on electromyogram consistent with myositis

176/Protocol GA30044, Version 3 RENAL: Note that the following domains (urinary casts, hematuria, 
proteinuria, and pyuria) can only be evaluated on clean catch urinalysis 
specimens.   
URINARY CASTS  
Definition:  Heme -granular or red blood cell casts.  
This is scored if red blood cell casts are seen, even if it is only one. Pigmented 
casts are counted but non- pigmented granular casts, hyaline or waxy casts are 
not counted.  
HEMATURIA 
Definition: >5 red blood cells/high power field. Exclude stone, infection or other 
cause.  
With regard to this descriptor, every attempt should be made to see patients 
when they are not menstruating. If this is not possible the urinalysis should be 
deferred until the next visit.  
This descriptor is not scored if there is documented renal calculi or infection. The 
latter must be confirmed by a positive urinary culture. However it is 
acknowledged that associated conditions such as chlamydia or urethral irritation 
may result in mild hematuria and the physician's best judgment is warranted. The 
important point is attribution: there must be other evidence of nephritis and 
other causes of hematuria must be excluded.  
In the complete absence of proteinuria, attribution of hematuria to active nephritis 
would be very unlikely unless pathology is limited to the mesangium.  
PROTEINURIA  
Definition: proteinuria of more than 0.5 g/24 hours  (or equivalent by spot urine 
protein to creatinine ratio) . 
Must be attributed to active lupus nephritis.  
PYURIA  
Definition: >5 white blood cells/high power field. Exclude infection.

(SLEDAI -2K) (cont.)  
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.  
177/Protocol GA30044, Version 3 This descriptor is not scored if there is evidence of vaginal contamination 
(presence of any squamous epithelial cells) or a documented infection. The latter 
must be confirmed by a positive urinary culture. However, it is acknowledged that 
associated conditions such as chlamydia, trichomonas or urethral irritation may 
result in mild pyuria and the physician's best judgment is warranted. The 
important point is attribution; there must be other evidence of nephritis, 
and other causes of pyuria should be excluded.  In the complete absence of 
proteinuria, attribution of hematuria to active nephritis would be very unlikely 
unless pathology is limited to the interstitium.  
RASH  
Definition: Ongoing inflammatory lupus rash.  
A rash is scored if it is ongoing, new or recurrent. Even if it is identical in terms of 
distribution and character to that observed on the last visit and the intensity is 
improved, it is counted. Therefore, despite improvement in a rash, if it is still 
ongoing it represents disease activity. The rash must be attributable to SLE. A 
description of the rash must appear in the physical exam and should include 
distribution, characteristics such as macular or papular, and size.  
The following should not be scored:  
1. Chronic scarred discoid plaques in any location.  
2. Transient malar flush, i.e., it is not raised and is evanescent  
A common problem one may encounter is the differentiation between scoring a 
lesion as "rash" and/or "vasculitis". If a lesion meets the descriptive criteria of the 
latter it should not also be counted as rash, i.e., the score would be 8 points not 
10 points. If a separate rash characteristic of SLE is present only then would 
"rash" also be scored.  
ALOPECIA:  
Definition:  Ongoing abnormal, patchy or diffuse loss of hair due to active lupus.  
This should be scored if any of the following conditions are present:  
1. There is temporal thinning which is newly present for less than six months 
(if temporal alopecia is present for more than six months with no change it 
should not be counted)

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index  
(SLEDAI -2K) (cont.)  
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.  
178/Protocol GA30044, Version 3 2. Areas of scalp with total bald spots if present for less than six months 
(does not need to have accompanying discoid lesion or follicular plugging)  
3. The presence of "lupus frizz" i.e., short of strands of unruly hair in the 
frontal or temporal area 
If a patient complains of hair loss and there is nothing apparent on exam this 
descriptor  is not scored.  
MUCOSAL ULCERS:  
Definition: Ongoing oral or nasal ulcerations due to active lupus.  
An ulcer is scored if it is ongoing, it need not be new or recurrent. Ulcers can be 
present in either the nose or oral cavity. Erythema alone without frank ulceration 
is not sufficient to be scored, even if the erythema is present on the upper palate. 
Ulcers on the buccal mucosa and tongue are counted.  
Mucosal ulcers are not counted as vasculitis.  
PLEURISY  
Definition: Classic and severe pleuritic chest pain or  pleural rub with effusion or 
new pleural thickening due to lupus.  
This descriptor is scored if the patient complains of pleuritic chest pain lasting 
greater than 12 hours. The pain should be classic, i.e., exacerbated by 
inspiration, to help distinguish it from musculoskeletal conditions such as 
costochondritis, which could be confused with pleurisy. The symptom must also 
be accompanied by objective findings.  
PERICARDITIS:  
Definition: Classic and severe pericardial pain with rub or effusion, or 
electrocar diogram or echocardiogram confirmation.  
The symptom must be accompanied by objective findings.  
LOW COMPLEMENT:  
Definition: Decrease in CH50, C3 or C4 below the lower limit of normal for testing 
laboratory.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index  
(SLEDAI -2K) (cont.)  
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.  
179/Protocol GA30044, Version 3 Exclude a low C4 or CH50 in patients with known i nherited deficiency of C4.  
INCREASED DNA BINDING  
Definition: >25% binding by Farr assay or above normal range for testing 
laboratory.  
FEVER:  
Definition: >38°C. Exclude infectious cause.  
This would be scored if one of the following conditions are present:  
1. A documented temperature elevation >100.4°F or >38°C at the time of the 
visit. 
2. A convincing history from the patient that she/he has been febrile within 
the preceding 10 days prior to the visit without any signs or symptoms 
suggestive of infection. Febrile is defined as above and not simply that the 
patient felt feverish. In this case the patient need not be febrile at the time 
of the visit for a score of 2 to be given.  
As stated in the SLEDAI, fever secondary to infection is not to be scored 
although it is  acknowledged that concomitant lupus activity and infection can 
occur. Fever in the presence of infection should only be scored on the SLEDAI if 
other evidence of lupus activity is present.  
THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  
Definition: <100,000 platelets/mm3. 
LEUKOPENIA:  
Definition: <3,000 white blood cells/mm3. Exclude drug causes.  
This is exactly as described, WBC <3,000/mm3. The presence of an absolute 
lymphopenia does not count in the SLEDAI. A note of caution, do not confuse 
this WBC with that used to satisfy the ACR  criteria for SLE which is WBC 
<3,500/mm3. 
With regard to current use of possible offending drugs, the following guidelines 
are to be considered:

receiving cyclophosphamide in a patient known to have a WBC ≥ 3,000 at 
the time of receiving cyclophosphamide should not be counted.  
2. Do not score leukopenia appearing after initiation of a new medication 
known to be associated with leukopenia, such as azathioprine or sulfa 
drugs. If the patient develops a WBC <3000 while taking drugs which may 
cause leukopenia, score this only if the dosage of medication is 
unchanged since the last WBC determination.

GLUCOCORTICOID- INDUCED MYOPA THY DEF INITIONS
Glucocorticoid -induced myopathy is defined as mild symmetrical weakness of the 
proximal muscles and/or neck flexors associated with steroid therapy and notdue to 
any other apparent cause.  Muscle enzymes are typically within normal limits.
Mild and modera te myopathy are defined by muscle strength of 4 on the standard 
Medical Research Council strength testing scale.  A 4 means weaker than normal 
but greater than anti -gravity strength. 
“Mild” is Grade 4 weakness that does notfunctionally limit the patient.
”Moderate” is Grade 4 weakness that does impose functional limitations on the 
patient, interfering with normal daily activities.
Note that inability to rise from a chair without assistance constitutes severe
glucocorticoid- induced myopathy (Specific Doma in)

28-Joint Count
The number of tender joints and the number of swollen joints will be assessed on any 
patient in whom arthritis is present at the current visit or in whom arthritis has been 
present at any previous visit during the study. 
The joint counts must be performed by an assessor with experience in performing these 
assessments; this may be the Principal Investigator, subinvestigator, the study 
coordinator, or another trained individual approved by the Sponsor.  The joint counts on 
a given patient should be performed by the same assessor at each study visit. 
The 28 joints to be assessed for tenderness and swelling are as follows:
Shoulders (2 joints )
Elbows (2 joints)
Wrists (2 joints)
Interphalangeal of each thumb (2 joints )
Proximal interphalangeal joints on finger s 25 (8joints)
Metacarpophalangeal joints on digits 1 5 (10 joints)
Knees (2 joints )
The choice of joints included in this assessment is based on the 28 -joint count 
performed as part of the Disease Activity Score (DAS) -28 for assessment of disease 
activity in rheumatoid arthritis.

Cutaneous Lupus Ery thematosus Disease Area and Severity 
Index (CLA SI)
The Cutaneous Lupus Area and Severity Index (CLASI) comprises a score for the
activity of the disease and a score for the damage caused by the disease 
(see Scoresheet in this appendix).  The CLASI should be completed at intervals as
indicated in the SOA ( Appendix 1) for any patient who has mucocutaneous 
manifestations of SLE at a given study visit and then at all subsequent visits. 
With the exception of alopecia, only skin lesions that are specific to SLE are included in 
this assessment.  The cutaneous manifestations of SLE (e.g., vasculitis) are not scored 
for the CLASI.
1.localized and gene ralized manifestations of acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus 
(malar rash, maculopapular rash, photosensitive rash, bullous lupus erythematosus);
2.subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (annular / polycyclic or papulosquamous / 
psoriasiform); and
3.chronic cu taneous lupus erythematosus (localized and generalized discoid lupus, 
verruccous/hyperkeratotic discoid lupus, mucosal discoid lupus, tumid lupus, 
perniotic/chilblain lupus, and lupus profundus/lupus panniculitis). 
Training in the use of the CLASI will b e provided to Investigators .
Activity 
Lesion activity is scored for 13 specified anatomical areas in terms of erythema 
(absent 0; pink or faint erythema 1; red 2; dark red, purple, violaceous, crusted, or 
hemorrhagic 3) and scale/hypertrophy (absent 0; scale 1; verruccous or 
hypertrophic 2).  The severity score for each area is based on the worst lesion within 
that area.  
The patient is asked about mucous membrane involvement and if this is reported the 
affected areas are examined (absent 0, present 1). 
The patient is asked about hair loss in the past 30 days (patient -reported absence 0, 
presence 1).Non-scarring alopecia on examination is scored by examining the scalp in 
quadrants (absent 0; diffuse, non -inflammatory 1; focal or patchy in one quadrant 2; 
focal or patchy in more than one quadrant 3).  The scores for the various anatomical 
areas are summed.
The maximum possible score for the Activity component of the CLASI is 70. 
Appendix 14
Cutaneous Lupus Ery thematosus Disease Area and Severity 
Index (CLA SI)(cont.)
GDC -0853 —Genentech, Inc.
191/Protocol GA30044 , Version 3Damage 
Skin damage is scored for 12 specif ied anatomical areas (as for the Activity score but 
excluding the scalp which is scored separately, see below).  Damage in each area is 
scored for dyspigmentation (absent 0; present 1) and for scarring, atrophy and 
panniculitis (absent 0; scarring 1; severe atrophic scarring or panniculitis 2).  As for 
the Activity component of the index, the damage severity score for each area is based 
on the worst lesion within that area.  The scores for the various anatomical areas are 
then summed.
The patie nt is asked whether the dyspigmented cutaneous lesions usually remain visible 
for more than 12 months.  If so, this is taken to indicate that the lesions are permanent, 
and the dyspigmentation score is doubled. 
The scalp is examined for scarring, again by dividing into quadrants (absent 0; scarring 
in one quadrant 3; two quadrants 4; three quadrants 5; whole skull scarred 6). 
The maximum possible score for the Damage component of the CLASI is 56.

Physician’s Global A ssessment
The Investigator’s global assessment of the patient’s current disease activity (PGA) will 
be marked on a 100 mm horizontal visual analogue scale (VAS) marked from ‘none’ to 
‘severe’ and graded from 0 to 3 (see example of follo wing page).  The Investigator 
should refer to assessments at prior visits and move the tick mark according to his or her 
assessment of the patient’s disease activity over the preceding 28 days.  The PGA 
should be done after the Investigator has done the cl inical history and examination of the 
patient and has completed the BILAG -2004 and SLEDAI -2Kindices and (where 
appropriate) the CLASI and 28 -joint counts. 
Pertinent laboratory values should be taken into account before completing the PGA 
rating. If rele vant laboratory results are pending, investigator may make a provisional 
marking on a local paper copy of the PGA case record form and finalize the assessment 
when all pertinent data areavailable.

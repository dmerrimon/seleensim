10 Study Design Overview and Schema:  
This Phase 3 study is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of MIRV vs. IC Chemo in patients 
with platinum -resistant high- grade epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), primary peritoneal, or fallopian 
tube cancer, whose tumors express a high- level of FRα. Patients will be, in the opinion of the 
Investigator, appropriate for single -agent therapy for their next line of therapy. Folate receptor alpha 
(FRα) positivity will be defined by the Ventana FOLR1 (FOLR1- 2.1) CDx assay.  
Eligible patients (N = 430), who have provided informed consent and meet study entry criteria will be randomized (1:1) to one of two arms:  
• Arm 1 (n = 215): MIRV 6  mg/kg adjusted ideal body weight (AIBW) every 3 weeks (Q3W)  
• Arm 2 (n = 215): IC Chemo, at one of the following regimens as determined by the Investiga tor prior to randomization:  
– Paclitaxel (Pac; 80  mg/m
2) administered QW within a 4 -week cycle  
– Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD; 40 mg/m2) administered Q4W  
– Topotecan (Topo; 4  mg/m2) administered either on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 4  weeks or for 
5 consecutive days (1.25 mg/m2 Days 1 –5) Q3W  
Patients will be stratified by:  
• Number of prior lines of therapy (1 vs. 2 vs. 3)  
• IC Chemo (Pac vs. PLD vs. Topo) chosen prior to randomization  
The table below shows the dose and schedule of the study drugs.  
Group  Drug  Dose  Dosing Schedule  
Arm 1  MIRV  6 mg/kg AIBW  IV Day 1 of a 3- week cycle  
Arm 2  Pac 80 mg/m2 IV Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 4- week cycle 
PLD  40 mg/m2 IV Day 1 of a 4- week cycle 
Topo  4 mg/m2 IV Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 4- week cycle 
Topo  1.25 mg/m2 IV  Days 1 to 5 of a 3- week cycle  
Disease progression will be evaluated by the Investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1 , Appendix B ). Computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) scans will be collected and held for sensitivity analysis by a blinded independent central review (BICR).  
Patients will continue to receive study drug until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, death, or until the Sponsor terminates the study (whichever comes first).  
Tumor assessments, including radiological assessments by CT/MRI  scans will be performed at 
Screening and subsequently every 6 weeks (± 1 week) from Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) (for all regimens) 
for the first 36 weeks then every 12 weeks (± 3 weeks)  until disease progression, death, the initiation of 
subsequent anticancer th erapy, or patient’s withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first.  
Patients who dis continue study treatment for reasons other than progressive disease (PD ) will continue  
with tumor assessments until documentatio n of PD or the start of a new anticancer therapy, whichever 
comes first. Prior to Week 36 (from Cycle 1, Day 1) , assessments should occur every 6 weeks 
(± 1 week) as allowed by local requirements  but m ust occur at an interval of no more than 12 weeks. 
After Week 36, assessment will oc cur every 12 we eks (± 3 weeks)  until documentation of PD or the 
start of new anticancer therapy.

11 All patients who discontinue study drug will be followed for survival every 3 months (±  1 month ) until 
death, lost to follow -up, withdrawal of consent for survival follow -up, or end of study (EOS) 
whichever comes first. Additional survival follow -up calls may occur periodically if needed. All 
patients will be followed for progression and survival.  
Two interim analyses will be conducted, (1) an interim futility analysis (PFS only) when at least 110 
PFS events have occurred, and (2) an interim analysis for OS at the time of final analysis of PFS when at least 330 PFS events have occurred. The final an alysis for OS will be conducted when at least 300 
deaths have occurred.

a Must be within 28 days before C1D1.  
b Confirm before first dose.  
c Must be within 14 days before C1D1.  
d ECG and PRO assessment may be performed predose at C1D1 if not performed previously during screening.  
e Testing for FRα expression is required for all patients. Those who do not have archival tumor tissue to submit will be requir ed to undergo procedures to obtain a  new biopsy 
during the Pre -Screening period to confirm eligibility. If the archival tumor tissue does not meet FRα criteria, a new biopsy tumor sample m ay be submitted and used to meet this 
criterion.  
f Full physical examination (PE) is required at Screening  and the 30 -day Follow -up visit. Symptom -directed PEs while on study drug.  
g ECOG, PE, pregnancy, hematology, and chemistry labs (if all parameters are within normal range) do not need to be repeated at C1D1 if performed within the previous 4 days 
during Screening.  
h Vital signs (BP and temperature) will be measured before start of infusion; post infusion vital signs should be collected as clinically indicated for potential infusion related 
reaction.  
i Hematology and chemistry labs may be performed up to 4 days prior Day 1 of each cycle, and as clinically indicated while on t reatment, with results reviewed before each  drug 
administration. In the event of severe toxicity, laboratory tests must be repeated as clinically necessary until the toxicity  resolves or stabilizes to baseline level.  
j For women of childbearing potential (WCBP), a urine or serum pregnancy test will be performed within 4 days prior to D ay 1 of each cycle and at the 30 -day Follow -Up visit. It 
is recommended to perform monthly pregnancy tests for 3 months after the last dose of MIRV . Additional testing may be performed in accordance with institutional 
requirements or local regulation.  
k Baseline ophthalmic exams will be performed by an ophthalmologist within 14 days before C1D1 and will include the following: visual acuity (with/without corrective lens; 
whichever best reflects the patient’s usual functioni ng), slit lamp examination, intraocular pressure measurement, and indirect fundoscopy. All patients who had an ophthalmic 
exam on study treatment (post -baseline) will have a complete ophthalmological examination performed at EOT visit or 30 day follow -up visit.  
l Ocular symptoms assessment will be performed by the treating physician or other qualified individual before the start of each  cycle. For patients reporting >  CTCAE Grade 1 
ocular symptoms, treatment will be held until the patient is evaluated by an ophthalmologist for a complete examination.  
m Radiologic tumor assessment by CT/MRI scan.  
n If a patient discontinues before documentation of progressive disease (PD), a tumor assessment and CA -125 will be assessed at the EOT visit or 30 -day Follow -up visit, if not 
performed within the previous 6 weeks. Tumor assessments and CA -125 will continue to be performed. Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than 
progressive disease (PD) will continue tumor assessments until documentation of PD or the start of a new anticancer therapy, whichever comes first. Prior to Week 36 (from 
Cycle 1, Day 1), assessments should occur every 6 weeks (± 1 week) as allowed by local requirements but must occur at an interval of no more than 12 weeks. After Week 36, assessment will occur every 12 weeks (± 3 weeks) until documentation of PD , death,  the start of new anticancer therapy , or patient’s withdrawal of consent (whichever comes 
first) . 
o CA-125 responses will be confirmed according to GCIG criteria.  
p Includes the  EQ5D- 5L, QLQ -C30, QLQ- OV28 , and PGIS  assessments. At visits where administered, the PROs should be completed before other procedures at the beginning of 
clinic visit. PRO assessments will occur Day 1 of every cycle up to Week 24 and then approximately every 12 weeks (±  3 weeks), at the time of tumor assessment, until 
documentation of PD or the start of new anticancer therapy.  
q Only AEs/SAEs which are considered related to a study procedure (ie blood draw or fresh tumor biopsy) will be captured during the Pre -screening period, ie from the time of 
signing the Pre -screening consent (if one is utilized) until the signing of the main study informed consent, or until the patient is determined to be a screen failure.  
r All ocular AEs will be followed  until resolution, stabilization, or return to baseline.  
s Blood samples for PK analysis will be taken within 1 hour after MIRV infusion on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 3, and on Day 8 (± 24  hours) of Cycles 1 and 3. Samples will also be 
collected on the day of MIR V infusion prior to dosing on Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 4, EOT, and also at the 30 -Day Follow -up if feasible.  
t Immunogenicity will be assessed in PK samples collected prior to dosing (predose) on C2D1, C4D1, and anytime at EOT, and 30 -day Follow -up.  There will  be an ADA only 
collection prior to dosing on Day 1 of Cycle  1.

18 u Survival follow -up assessments will occur every 3 months (± 1 month ) until death, the patient is lost to follow -up or withdraws of consent for survival follow -up, or EOS, 
whichever comes first.  These assessments may be conducted by telephone. Information on initiation of other anticancer therapy (including start date,  therapy type/name, and 
response on treatment) should be collected. Additional survival follow -up calls may occur periodically if needed. 
Note: A patient’s  BRCA  mutational status (germline or somatic mutation in tumor tissue) will be collected as part of her medical history if availabl e. Patients without a known 
mutation will be classified as unknown. Testing may be performed to support exploratory endpoints at the end of the trial; however, results will not be communicated to treating 
physicians or patients.

21 d ECG and PRO assessment may be performed predose at C1D1 if not performed previously during screening.  
e Testing for FRα expression is required for all patients. Those who do not have archival tumor tissue to submit will be requir ed to undergo procedures to obtain a new  biopsy 
during the Pre -Screening period to confirm eligibility. If the archival tumor tissue does not meet FRα criteria, a new biopsy tumor sample m ay be submitted and used to meet this 
criterion.  
f Full examination (PE) is required at Screening and the 30-day Follow -up visit. Symptom- directed PEs while on study drug.  
g PE, pregnancy, hematology, and chemistry labs (if all parameters are within normal range) do not need to be repeated at C1D1 if performed within the previous 4 days d uring 
Screening.  
h Vital signs (BP and temperature) will be measured before start of infusion; post infusion vital signs should be collected as clinic ally indicated for potential infusion related 
reaction.  
i ECOG does not need to be repeated at C1D1 if performed within the previous 4 days during Screening.  
j Hematology and chemistry labs may be performed up to 4 days prior Day 1 of each cycle, and as clinically indicated while on t reatment, with results reviewed prior to each drug 
administration. In the event of severe toxicity, labor atory tests must be repeated as clinically necessary until the toxicity resolves or stabilizes to baseline level.  
k For WCBP, a urine or serum pregnancy test will be performed within 4 days prior to D ay 1 of each cycle  and at the 30 -day Follow -Up visit. It is recommended to perform 
monthly pregnancy tests for 6 months after the last dose of chemotherapy. Additional testing may be performed in accordance with institutional requirements or local regulation.  
l Baseline ophthalmic exams will be performed by an oph thalmologist within 14 days before C1D1 and will include the following: visual acuity (with/without corrective lens; 
whichever best reflects the patient’s usual functioning), slit lamp examination, intraocular pressure measurement, and indirect fundoscopy.  All patients who had an ophthalmic 
exam on study treatment (post -baseline) will have a complete ophthalmologic exam performed at the EOT visit or 30 -Day Follow -up visit.  
m Ocular symptoms assessment will be performed by the treating physician or other quali fied individual at screening and as clinically indicated if  symptoms appear  on study. For 
patients reporting >  CTCAE Grade 1 ocular symptoms, treatment will be held until the patient is evaluated by an ophthalmologist for a complete exa mination.  
n Radiologi c tumor assessment by CT/MRI scan.  
o If a patient discontinues before documentation of PD, a tumor assessment and CA -125 will be assessed at the EOT visit or 30- day Follow -up visit, if not performed within the 
previous 6 weeks. Tumor assessments and CA -125 will continue to be performed. Patie nts who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than progressive disease (PD) will 
continue tumor assessments until documentation of PD or the start of a new anticancer therapy, whichever comes first. Prior t o Week 36 (from Cycle 1, Day 1), assessmen ts 
should occur every 6 weeks (± 1 week) as allowed by local requirements but must occur at an interval of no more than 12 weeks . After Week 36, assessment will occur every 12 
weeks (± 3 weeks) until documentation of PD , death,  the start of new anticancer therapy , or patient’s withdrawal of consent (whichever comes first) .  
p CA-125 responses will be confirmed according to GCIG criteria.  
q Includes the EQ5D -5L, QLQ -C30, QLQ- OV28 , and PGIS  assessments. At visits where administered, the PROs should be completed before other procedures at the beginning of 
clinic visit. PRO assessments will occur Day 1 of every cycle up to Week 24 and then approximately every 12 weeks (±  3 weeks), at the time of tumor assessment, until 
documentation of PD or the start of new anticancer therapy . 
r Topo administered daily on Days 1 -5; no assessments are required on Days 2- 5 unless clinically indicated.  
s Only AEs/SAEs which are considered related to a study procedure (ie blood draw or fresh tumor biopsy) will be captured during the Pre -screening period, ie from the time of 
signing the Pre -screening consent (if one is utilized) until the signing of the main study informed consent, or until the patient is determined to be a screen failure.  
t Survival follow -up assessments will occur every 3 months (± 1 month ) until death, the patient is lost to follow -up or withdraws of consent for survival follow -up, or EOS, 
whichever comes first. These assessments may be conducted by telephone. Information on initiation of other anticancer therapy (including start date, therapy type/name, and

34 1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Target Background  
Folate receptor α (FRα) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol -anchored cell surface protein encoded 
by the folate receptor 1 ( FOLR1 ) gene. FRα internalizes folate, which is an essential co -factor for 
one-carbon transfer reactions that are required for DNA and RNA synthesis, cell growth and 
proliferation. Marked upregulation of FRα occurs during neonatal development and in cancer, 
suggesting that the receptor functions primarily under conditions of high folate demand. In 
contrast, normal adult tissues generally lack FRα expression and employ alternative transporters 
such as folate receptor β, reduced folate carrier and proton- coupled folate transporter for folate 
uptake ( Weitman  1992,  Mantovani  1994,  Elnakat  2004,  Kelemen  2006 , Investigator Brochure ).  
Published studies have demonstrated FRα overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in various epithelial tumors, particularly serous and endometrioid ovarian cancers and serous and endom etrioid endometrial cancers ( Scorer  2010,  Garin -Chesa  1993,  Kalli  2008,  Crane  2012,  
Dainty  2007,  Jones  2008,  Ab 2015 , and Allard  2007). IHC results obtained from patients 
screened or enrolled in the Phase 1 Study IMGN853- 0401 and Phase 3 Study IMGN853- 403 are 
generally consistent with the literature ( Investigator Brochure ). While assessing the FRα 
distribution in the PROC (platinum- resistant ovarian cancer)  expansion cohort, approximately 
40% of patients had high expression.  
Several additional studies have further validated FRα as a target in serous epithelial ovarian 
cancer (EOC). First, quantitative polymerase chain reaction studies show ubiquitous FRα mRNA expression in serous EOC ( Hanker  2012 , Hoskins  1998, Hough 2001 ) and high levels of FRα 
mRNA corre late with poor response to chemotherapy and decreased disease free survival 
(Chen  2012). Second, both Kalli et al and Crane et al have demonstrated that recurrent  tumors 
retain FRα expression comparably to primary tumors as shown by serial biopsy sampling and IHC ( Kalli 2008 , Crane  2012 ). Third, studies with FRα -specific imaging agents have 
demonstrated real -time FRα expression at primary and metastatic tumor sites (Fisher  2008,  
Garcia 2013, Garin -Chesa  1993, and van Dam  2011). Finally, a truncated form of FRα has been 
detected in ascites and b lood of EOC patients (Basal  2009, Mantovani  1994 ), furt her confirming 
expression in this disease and suggesting that the receptor may serve as a circulating biomarker. 
Collectively, these data suggest that FRα is a promising target in solid tumors, particularly EOC.  
1.2. Mirvetuximab Soravtansine  
Because of its tumor specific expression and capacity to internalize small and large molecule 
ligands, FRα has emerged as a promising target for antibody drug conjugate (ADC) therapy. ADCs combine the specificity of mAb to tumor antigens with the extraordinary cytotoxicity of 
maytansine derivatives, which are potent anti -microtubule agents that target proliferating cells. 
MIRV is an ADC designed to target FRα. It consists of the humanized anti - FRα mAb M9346A 
attached via a cleavable disulfide linker to the cytotoxic maytans inoid, DM4 ( Figure 1 ).

DM4 is ~2% by weight relative to mAb.  
Due to the nature of the conjugation process, the number of DM4 molecules attached to the mAb 
ranges from one to seven molecules per Ab, with an average of three or four DM4 molecules per Ab. Conjugation of the maytansinoid to the t umor- targeting Ab ensures that the cytotoxic 
component remains inactive in the circulation. Release of the cytotoxic payload requires binding, internalization, and degradation of the Ab. The released payload then kills the cell by inducing G2-M arrest and cell death. Cellular processing of maytansinoid conjugates can also generate 
lipophilic catabolites that cross cell membranes and kill neighboring cells ( Erickson 2006 ).  
In vitro , MIRV binds cell surface FRα with high apparent affinity (≤ 0.1 nM) and shows potent 
(IC
50 ≤ 1 nM) and selective cytotoxicity against tumor cells expressing FRα. Cytotoxic effects of 
MIRV in vitro is related to level of cell -surface expression of FRα ( Ab 2015). MIRV 
additionally demonstrates significant activity against FRα positive xenografts, with partial and complete remissions observed in ovarian models ( Ab 2015). Together with the selective 
upregulation of FRα in solid tumors, these results provide the rationale for exploring the clinical 
utility of MIRV.  
1.3. Epithelial Ovarian Cancer  
Ovarian cancer is a lethal disease with 22,530 new cases and 13,930 deaths expected in 2019 in the US ( SEER  Cancer Statistics Fact sheet 2019). The estimated number of new EOC cases in the 
EU (EU27) in 2012 was 44,149 with 29,758 deaths ( EUCAN Cancer Fact Sheet: Ovary 2019 ). 
The overall 5 -year survival for EOC patients is only 48% (SEER  Cancer Statistics Factsheet 
2019).  
Recent studies indicate that ovarian, peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancers are not distinct 
entities, but represent a spectrum of diagnoses that originate in t he Mullerian tissue. Primary 
fallopian tube carcinoma and peritoneal cancers are now included in the ovarian cancer staging classification (Cobb 2015, Grant  2010, Naumann  2011, O’Shannessy 2013), and are considered 
to be part of EOC with the same treatment and outcomes.

36 Despite considerable improvements in primary therapy, 80% of the patients with advanced EOC 
are expected to relapse during or after treatment with platinum -containing regimens 
(Armstrong 2019 ). Disease recu rring within 6 months of platinum -based chemotherapy is 
classified as platinum resistant , whereas, disease recurring longer than 6 months after therapy is 
termed platinum sensitive.  Patients with platinum- resistant disease typically receive single -agent  
chemotherapy (eg, PLD, topotecan [Topo], gemcitabine, paclitaxel [Pac],  or other) at relapse. 
Unfortunately, response rates (RR) are modest (~15%) and duration of response (DOR) is typically 4 to 8 months ( Cannistra  2010,  Matsuo  2010). Similarly, overall survival (OS) is poor 
(median OS ~11 months). Bevacizumab was approved for use in combination with chemotherapy for recurrent EOC in the platinum -resistant setting ( Pujade- Lauraine 2014). 
Because platinum -resistant EOC (PROC) remains a significant unmet medical need, the National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidel ines recommend that platinum resistant patients 
participate in clinical trials ( NCCN  Guidelines 2019).  
Commonly used agents for PROC are Pac, Topo and PLD, all of which have modest levels of 
activity, which underscores the need for improved therapies.  
In addition to single -agent cytotoxic chemotherapy, bevacizumab combinations and poly- ADP 
ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (eg, olaparib, niraparib, and rucaparib) are approved for 
treatment of previously treated EOC. These agents, however, are subject to treatment limitations. 
In particular, bevacizumab combinations are limited to patients who have received no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens and are not at  risk for bowel perforations (recto-sigmoid 
involvement, bowel involvement and/or history of bowel obstruction) (Aghajanian  2012,  Pujade-
Lauraine 2014) . Those patients with PROC who receive bevacizumab + chemotherapy typically 
receive subsequent single -agent chemotherapy if they remain eligible for further treatment.  
PARP inhibitors ( eg, olaparib and rucaparib) are approved as single -agent treatment for patients 
with breast cancer susceptibility gene ( BRCA ) mutated EOC (~15% of EOC) and have received 
≥ 2 prior regimens (Moore  2019) based on the durable responses seen in this subset of EOC. The 
activity of PARP inhibitors in BRCA  wild-type patients with PROC is negligible, with response 
rates of approximately 5% ( Gelmon  2011 , Moore  2019,  Sandhu  2013).  
1.4. Current Therapies  
Current management of advanced stage disease includes surgical tumor debulking, followed by 
adjuvant platinum - and taxane -based chemotherapy. However, the majority of the patients will 
recur ( Garcia 2013 ). Patients with relapsed platinum sensitive disease are often treated with 
carboplatin alone or as part of a combination regimen ( Pfisterer  2006), whereas those with 
platinum- resistant disease may be treated with a variety of agents, including Pac, Topo and PLD .  
See Section  1.7.2  for more information on the background and doses/regimens of Pac, Topo, and 
PLD selected for this study.

37 1.5. Non- Clinical Studies of Mirvetuximab Soravtansine  
1.5.1.  Correlation of FRα Expression  with MIRV Activity  
Studies assessing the potency and specificity of MIRV were conducted on a panel of FRα -
positive cell lines with a wide range of FRα expression, as well as on FRα -negative cell lines. 
These studies revealed a positive correlation between the level of FRα ex pression on the cell 
surface, the amount of maytansinoid catabolites generated, and the degree of sensitivity of the 
cells to MIRV in vitro. MIRV is not active against low and negative FRα expressing cells.  
1.5.2.  Pharmacology 
Results of nonclinical pharmacology studies demonstrate the following:  
• FRα has limited normal tissue expression and marked expression in solid tumors, 
particularly cancers of the ovary and endometrium ( Investigator Brochure ). In vitro 
studies demonstrated that MIRV binds cell surface FRα wit h high apparent affinity 
(≤ 0.1 nM) and shows potent (IC 50 ≤ 1 nM) and selective cytotoxicity against cells 
expressing FRα. MIRV -mediated cytotoxicity involves binding, internalization, and 
degradation of MIRV, which releases DM4. DM4 can be methylated to yield S -
methyl- DM4. Both DM4 and S -methyl- DM4 can inhibit tubulin polymerization and 
microtubule assembly, causing cell death. The lipophilic molecules S -methyl DM4 
and DM4 can also diffuse to neighboring cells and induce bystander killing.  
• In vitro cytotoxicity studies suggest that cells sensitive to MIRV express higher levels of FRα and release 10 - to 100- fold more cytotoxic maytansinoid than cells resistant to 
MIRV.  
• MIRV retains the inherent activities of its Ab moiety, M9346A, including binding affinity (apparent affinity ≤ 0.1 nM) and selectivity for FRα, capacity for uptake, internalization and degradation by FRα -positive target cells, and ability to induce Ab -
depe ndent cell -mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro.  
• MIRV demonstrates significant activity against FRα -positive xenografts. Partial 
and/or complete regressions in xenograft models of EOC were seen at doses of MIRV 
well below its maximum tolerated dose (MTD ).  
1.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics  
Nonclinical studies with MIRV cross -reactive (monkey) and non- cross- reactive (mouse) species 
were conducted to define pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters and to determine the stability of the linker and impact of conjugation on Ab clearance. An additional PK study with free DM4 was 
conducted in monkey. PK studies demonstrated the stability of MIRV in circulation after IV administration, with a distribution phase lasting about 24 hours followed by a slower terminal 
elimination phase. The da ta indicated that the PK of MIRV were approximately dose 
proportional within the ranges evaluated (1 mg/kg – 10 mg/kg). These studies are further detailed 
in the Investigator Brochure .

38 1.5.4.  Toxicology 
MIRV was evaluated for toxicity after a single IV injection  in cross -reactive (monkey) and non-
cross- reactive (mouse) species. Results of these studies supported the FIH (FIH) study exploring 
the safety and tolerability of MIRV when administered once every three weeks to patients with 
advanced solid tumors. Potent ial risks suggested by these studies as well as clinical experience 
with other maytansinoid ADCs include hematologic abnormalities, electrolyte alterations, injection site reactions, infusion reactions, immunogenicity, hepatic abnormalities, and 
peripheral  neuropathy. Toxicology studies are further detailed in the Investigator Brochure . 
1.6. Clinical Studies of Mirvetuximab Soravtansine  
1.6.1.  First -in-Human Phase 1 Clinical Trial: Study IMGN853-0401 
The first -in-human (FIH) Phase 1 study evaluated the safety, PK and pharmacodynamics of 
single- agent MIRV in patients with EOC and other FRα -positive tumors. The recommended 
Phase 2 dose for single agent MIRV administered once every three weeks was determined to be 
6.0 mg/kg adjusted ideal body weight (AIBW). Data from this  study, including PK and 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported by patients enrolled in the dose escalation 
cohorts are detailed in the Investigator Brochure .  
The initial antitumor activity observed with MIRV monotherapy in Study IMGN853-0401, 
particularly in those patients with PROC, no more than 3 prior lines of therapy and FRα medium 
or high expression per the original “PS2+” scoring method ( defined by 2+ intensity staining of 
tumor cells with medium ≥50% to <75% of tumor cells and high ≥75% of tumor cells, as 
detailed in the Investigator Brochure ) suggested the potential for a significant improvement over 
single- agent chemotherapy (Pac, PLD, or Topo). Specifi cally, in the 36 patients with PROC, who 
had received no more than 3 prior lines of therapy, and had FRα medium or high expression, MIRV was associated with a confirmed Investigator -assessed ORR of 47%, median DOR of 5.8 
months, and median progression- free survival (PFS) of 6.7 months, which compared favorably 
with what would be expected with single -agent chemotherapy. Similarly, in the subset of 27 
patients with FRα -high expression, the confirmed Investigator -assessed ORR was 44%, with 
median DOR of 7.8 months and median PFS of 6.7 months.  
The initial safety profile of MIRV suggested that it was well tolerated, with a safety profile primarily consisting of low grade gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) and blurred vision 
related to corneal keratopathy. The TEAEs were manageable with standard medical care and/or dose modification, with a low rate (10%) of patients discontinuing MIRV due to a treatment -
related TEAE.  
Safety data are further detailed in the MIRV Investigator Brochure . 
1.6.2.  Phase 3 Monotherapy Trial in Patients with Platinum -resistant EOC, Peritoneal, 
and Fallopian Tube Cancer: Study IMGN853 -0403 
IMGN853 -0403 was a Phase 3 study with the objective to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
single- agent MIRV vs. Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (IC  Chemo) in patients with 
platinum- resistant EOC, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer, and whose tumor

39 was FRα -positive (medium or high expression) by the Ventana IHC assay. The study was 
designed to compare the efficacy of MIRV to that of approved single -agent selected standard of 
care chemotherapy (Pac, PLD, or Topo) in patients with PROC who have received no more than 
3 prior systemic treatment regimens and for whom single -agent chemotherapy is appropriate as 
the next line of therapy.  
A total of 366 patients were randomized and assigned to the MIRV group or the IC Chemo 
groups (248 and 118, respectively) and were included in the ITT analysis. A total of 352 patients received at least 1 dose of MIRV or IC Chemo (243 and 109, respectively), and were included in 
the Safety population analysis. All patients in the MIRV group of the Safety population received 
a dose of 6  mg/kg AIBW every 3 weeks (Q3W). The patients in the IC Chemo group received a 
dose of single -agent chemotherapy.  
The primary endpoint was PFS by a blinded independent review committee, which was assessed using the Hochberg procedure in the entire study population and in the FRα -high population. The 
Hochberg procedure enables the simultaneous testing of 2 overlapping populations. Under this 
statistical analysis plan, if the p -value of the primary endpoint in either population is greater than 
0.05, the p- value in the other population needs to be less than or equal to 0.025 to achieve 
statistical significance. The primary endpoint , PFS, did not reach statistical significance in either 
the overall ITT population (p-value = 0.897; HR = 0.981) or in the pre -specified FRα-high 
population (p-value = 0.049; HR  = 0.693).  
This is the first study to evaluate available chemotherapy specifically in patients with high FRα expression. An examination of efficacy in the FRα -high population showed clinically meaningful 
advantage for those patients randomized to MIRV vs. IC Chemo across all endpoints. MIRV 
treatment in PROC patients with high FRα e xpression resulted in an ORR of 24% (95% CI: 17.2, 
31.5) compared with 10% (95% CI: 4.1, 19.3) for patients randomized to IC Chemo (p- value = 
0.014), median PFS of 4.8 months (95% CI: 4.11, 5.68) vs. 3.3  months (95% CI: 1.97, 5.59) for 
patients randomized to IC Chemo (p- value = 0.049; HR = 0.693), median OS in patients 
randomized to MIRV was not reached (95% CI: 12.58, not estimable) vs. 11.8 months (95% CI: 9.20, not estimable) for patients randomized to IC Chemotherapy (p- value = 0.033; HR = 0.618). 
OS re sults are not confounded by an imbalance in subsequent anti -cancer therapy. The median 
DOR using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1 per BIRC in the FRα-high population in patients randomized to MIRV was 5.7 months (95% CI: 4.17, - ) vs. 4.2 
months (95% CI: 3.22, 8.71) for patients randomized to IC Chemo. Consistent with the observed 
tumor shrinkage, CA -125 responses per the Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG) criteria 
occurred in 53% of FR α response- evaluable patients treated with MI RV (compared with 25% in 
the IC Chemotherapy group). Analysis of time to second disease progression (PFS2) suggests that the clinical benefit observed with MIRV does not diminish the efficacy of subsequent 
therapy (patient randomized to MIRV median 10.1 months [95% CI: 9.03, 11.20] vs. 8.4 months 
[95% CI: 7.10, 9.46] for patients randomized to IC Chemo [p- value < 0.001; HR = 0.557]).  
The efficacy and safety of MIRV from this Phase 3 study were supported by PRO data, which 
showed a larger proportion of patie nts with a ≥  15 point improvement in the European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) -QLQ -OV28 Abdominal/GI 
symptom subscale from baseline to Week 8/9 compared to IC Chemo (32% vs 13.7% respectively, p=0.011).

40 For MIRV the mean half -life (t ½,) was 115.1 hour (4.8 days), with little evidence of accumulation 
(mean accumulation ratio of 1.102).  
There was no apparent relationship between patients testing positive for ADA and MIRV 
exposure.  
The MIRV safety profile was predominantly characterized by low -grade nausea (51%), diarrhea 
(40%), and blurred vision (40%). These TEAEs are generally managed and mitigated with 
antiemetics, antidiarrheals, and lubricating/steroid eye drops. In the MIRV group, there were fewer ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs, and fewer  TEAEs leading to dose reduction or delay and treatment 
discontinuation (46%, 37%, and 12%, respectively) compared with the IC Chemo group (61%, 45%, and 19%, respectively). While myelosuppression is an important safety issue with PLD and Topo, MIRV is associated with less myelosuppression compared to IC Chemo, with lower rates 
of neutropenia (7% vs. 39% all grade; 0% vs. 21% Grade 3+), thrombocytopenia (11% vs. 16% 
all grade; 0% vs. 4% Grade 3+) and anemia (14% vs. 29% all grade; 2% vs. 11% Grade 3+). Similarly, neurotoxicity is an important safety issue with Pac; MIRV, an ADC with the tubulin -
directed payload DM4, is associated with less peripheral neuropathy than Pac (15% vs. 28% Grade 2+) and less alopecia (3% vs. 22% all grades). The safety profile of MIRV in the high 
FRα subset is consistent with that observed in the overall MIRV safety population.  
Please see the Investigator Brochure  for information on Study IMGN853-0403.  
1.6.3.  Conclusion 
The available safety and efficacy data from the 455 patients treated with single -agent MIRV  in 
previous clinical studies are consistent with a positive risk benefit assessment. The potential 
benefit of the anti -tumor activity demonstrated by MIRV  in patients with FRα high platinum 
resistant ovarian cancer, a population with  high unmet need, outweighs the risks associated with 
the well tolerated safety profile, as summarized above.
 
1.7. Rationale for the Selection of Drug Dose Levels and Dosing 
Schedules  
1.7.1.  Mirvetuximab Soravtansine  
The selection of the Phase 3 dose of 6 mg/kg AIBW IV Q3W was based on data obtained from 
Study IMGN853- 0401, a FIH study designed to establish the MTD and determine the 
recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MIRV when administered IV as a single agent in adult 
patients with FRα -positive solid tumors who have r elapsed or are refractory to standard 
therapies. The appropriateness of this dose and regimen in patients with PROC was further 
supported by the results of the Phase 3 study IMGN853- 0403. For more information please see 
the Investigator Brochure .  
1.7.2.  Chemothe rapeutic Agents in the Investigator’s Choice Arm  
The t hree drugs most commonly used in the setting of platinum resistance are PLD, Pac and 
Topo (Ledermann  2013 [ESMO Guidelines] , NCCN  Guidelines 2019 and Luvero  2014 ). The 
ability of patients to tolerate the bone marrow suppressive effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy  is

41 less than that of patients receiving initial therapy. Modified doses and administration schedules 
(outside of the label for first line or second- line EOC) are therefore, typically used to treat EOC 
in such settings.  
1.7.2.1.  Paclitaxel 
Pac is a taxane that can stab ilize microtubules to inhibit cell division. The drug was approved for 
treatment of recurrent EOC when response rates (RR) of 25% to 37% were observed in multiple 
Phase 2 trials testing the 3 -weekly schedule ( McGuire  1989, Thigpen  1994, Rowinsky 1995). In 
the study by Thigpen et al, a median PFS of 4.2 months and an OS of 16 months were observed. 
A Phase 2 trial showed that weekly dosing could lead to a 20.9% ORR in platinum - and Pac-
resistant EOC patients ( Gynecologic Oncology Group 2006). This alternative weekly dosing 
schedule for Pac was studied in many trials in refractory, persistent, or recurrent EOC patients, as reviewed by Baird et al ( Baird  2010). A randomized Phase  3 study comparing weekly vs. 
3-weekly Pac in recurrent EOC patients (of whom half were platinum -resistant) showed no 
difference in RR, PFS, or OS. However, the weekly schedule had a better safety p rofile than the 
3-weekly schedule, as considerably less neutropenia, neuropathy, and myalgia were observed 
(Rustin  2004). Of note, the occurrence of neutropenia was also reduced when Pac was infused  
over 3 hours instead of 24  hours ( Eisenhauer  1994 ). A recent randomized Phase 2 clinical trial 
(CARTAXHY) tested the efficacy of weekly Pac as a single agent, or in combination with 
carboplatin, or weekly Topo in patients with PROC. The results showed that the combination treatments increased hypersensitivity reactions, febrile neutropenia, and anemia, and did not 
improve ORR or median PFS when compared to single agent weekly Pac ( Lortholary 2012 ). 
The approved schedule of Pac Q3W for second- line treatment of EOC is associated with a high 
rate of myelosuppression, particularly neutropenia, and peripheral neuropathy. Investigators 
therefore developed interest in evaluating the antitumor activity and tolerability of Pac 
administered on a weekly schedule, exploring it in  several Phase 2 studies ( Rustin  2004,  
Markman  2002) . The weekly schedul e is associated with similar efficacy and an improved 
toxicity profile, with less bone marrow suppression and neuropathy, as summarized by Baird et al (Baird  2010 ). Toxicities  are managed with dose reductions and/or holding the D22 dosing on 
the weekly schedule. In the Phase 3 AURELIA study, the weekly Pac regimen resulted in an 
ORR of 30.2% in patients with PROC with 1 to 2 prior lines of therapy ( Poveda 2015).  
1.7.2.2.  Topotecan 
Topo’s mechanism of action is different from that of Pac, as it does not directly block cell 
division, but instead induces irreversible DNA damage. Topo inhibits topoisomerase 1, leading to both single and double stranded DNA breaks that eventually promote apoptosis. Topo 
(administered QD the first 5 days of 21- day cycles) was approved for treatment of EOC after 
failure of initial or subsequent chemotherapy. This approval was based on a Phase 3 trial that 
showed it to be at least as effective as Pac, with ORR of 21% vs. 13%, and median PFS of 23 
weeks vs. 14 weeks, respectively ( ten Bokkel Huinink 1997). Unfortunately, Topo treatment led 
to severe bone marrow suppression with 80% Grade 4 neutropenia, 25% Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, and 41% Grade 3 or 4 anemia ( ten Bokkel Huinink 1997 ).

42 As such toxicities are often dose limiting, multiple clinical trials have studied alternative dosing 
schedules to improve the tolerability of Topo treatment ( Armstrong  2019,  Armstrong  2004, 
Hoskins  1998, Markman  2000). For example, one Phase 2 trial tested the effect of the “standard” 
dosing of Topo (1.5 mg/m2, daily the first 5 days of 21- day cycles) compared with an alternative 
dosing regimen (1.75 mg/m2, QW for 4 weeks, repeated every six weeks) in patients with 
recurrent EOC. The alternative dosing regimen led to a lower ORR (9.6% compared with 22.6% 
in the standard dosing arm), but also decreased myelotoxicity (52% of patients had Grade 3 or 4 granuloc ytopenia in comparison with 94% in the standard dosing arm) ( Hoskins  1998). A 
subsequent Phase 2 trial tested the effect of yet another dosing schedule (1.5  mg/m
2, daily the 
first three days of 21- day cycles) ( Markman  2000 ). Compared to historical controls, this 
alternative dosing regimen seemed to decreas e the toxicity of Topo  (Armstrong  2004) . In a meta-
analysis of various clinical trials, it was concluded that modification of the Topo dose, and potent ially the dosing schedule, can indeed reduce hematologic  toxicity without decreasing the 
efficacy of the drug ( Armstrong  2019).  
The approved Topo dosing for relapsed EOC is 1.5  mg/ m
2/d, administered on days 1 to 5 of a 3-
week schedule. However, reduced doses (ie, 1.25  mg/m2/d) are associated with decreased 
toxicity and similar outcome, thereby being widely used in routine clinical pr actice 
(Sehouli  2009). Results from several studies suggest that women with relapsed EOC may benefit 
from similar effectiveness but significantly lower hematologic toxicity if Topo is administered in a weekly schedule. A Phase 2 trial of the North -Eastern German Society of Gynaecology 
Oncology Ovarian Cancer Study Group, has compared weekly schedule vs. the conventional 5-day schedule, reporting comparable OS rates and a favorable toxicity profile for weekly 4.0 mg/m
2/week Topo, making it another viable option in PROC ( Sehouli  2011 ). Based on this 
evidence fro m the literature, a conventional (1.25 mg/m2/d, on days 1 to 5 of a 3- week schedule) 
and an alternative (4.0  mg/m2/week, days 1, 8, and 15 of a 4 week cycle)  schedules of Topo were 
selected for the study.  
1.7.2.3.  Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin  
PLD is approved as monotherapy in recurrent PROC. The approved dose and schedule of 50 mg/m
2 every 28- days of PLD results in a substantial incidence (approximately 20% –30%) of 
Grade 3 “hand -foot- syndrome” ( Markman  2011). Considerable clinical experience generated 
since the initial regulatory approval of PLD has revealed equivalent clinical activity with substantially less severe adverse events when this agent is administered at a dose of 40  mg/m
2 
(rather than 50  mg/m2) on a 4- week schedule ( Markman  2011) . Results of two randomized Phase 
2 trials ( Markman  2000,  Wilailak  2004) provide strong support for the conclus ion that the 
40 mg/m2 dose level of PLD is therapeutically equivalent to the higher (and more toxic) dose 
approved for standard use in the second- line management of EOC. Recently a study was 
conducted to show equivalence in efficacy of PLD 40 mg/m2 and PLD  50 mg/m2 
(Yoshizawa 2015). This randomized controlled study also supports the use of an initial dose of 
40 mg/m2 PLD.  
PLD is another standard chemotherapy regimen used for treating PROC. The active component of this drug (doxorubicin) is an anthracycline that intercalates DNA, leading to inhibition of 
replication and, subsequently, the inhibition of proper cell division. Efficacy of PLD in PROC

43 EOC has been confirmed in several Phase 2 trials. In detail, the trial by Muggia et al reported a 
26% RR, median PFS of 5.7 months, and OS of 11 months ( Muggia  1997). A subsequent trial 
showed a 17% ORR and median PFS of 4.5 months ( Gelmon  2011). Of note, a Phase 3 trial 
testing Topo treatment vs. PLD treatment showed a trend toward a higher ORR in the PROC patients subset treated with PLD, although there was no improvement of PFS or OS 
(Gordon 2001 , Gordon  2004).  
1.8. Rationale for the Study Plan  
The design of this study is based on data obtained from Phase 3 study (IMGN853- 0403), which 
showed a potential for a clinically meaningful advantage for MIRV over IC Chemo (the same 
therapies selected for this study) in patients with high FRα expression. While that prior study did 
not reach statistical significance in the entire population (patients with medium and high FRα), 
those patients with  high FRα expression showed promising results.  
This Phase 3, open- label, randomized study is designed to compare the efficacy of MIRV to 
selected standard IC Chemo in patients with platinum- resistant high -grade EOC, primary 
peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer, whose tumors express a high level of FR α. 
This study will compare the safety and efficacy of MIRV administered at 6  mg/kg AIBW Q3W 
with IC Chemo (Pac, PLD or Topo). Patients will be enrolled 1:1 into one of two arms as follows:  
• Arm 1:  MIRV 6  mg/kg AIBW Q3W  
• Arm 2:  IC Chemo  
1.9. Rationale for the Study Population  
The study population included in this study was initially based on clinical observations from a 
Phase  1 study of MIRV (Study IMGN853- 0401), which showed promising clinical activity in 
patients with PROC. Results from that study suggested that higher FRα  levels correlated with 
response to treatment ( Martin  2015). Based on those results, a large, randomized Phase 3 study 
in patients with platinum- resistant advanced high- grade EOC, primary peritoneal, or fallopian 
tube cancers was initiated. Eligible patients were required to have tumors expressing what was 
considered a medium or high level FR α expression per the Ventana IHC assay using a newly 
implemented “10x” scoring method. Results from this study showed that while the study did not 
meet the primary endpoint per Hochberg procedure, MIRV showed consistently favorable 
efficacy when compared t o IC Chemo in measures of PFS, ORR, OS, DOR, PFS2, CA -125, and 
PRO endpoints in patients high FRα expression. Subsequent review demonstrated that the “10x” 
scoring method for the FOLR1 IHC assay misclassified a significant percentage of patients, and 
thus further impacted the study results. Ad hoc analyses of the PS2+ high FRα patients revealed 
enhanced benefit from MIRV for ORR, PFS and OS compared to IC Chemo controls.  These 
findings warranted a follow -up study focusing solely on patients with high FRα expression using 
the original “PS2+” scoring method. Thus, the present study will enroll a similar PROC 
population to the prior Phase 3 study, with the exception that patients are required to have high FRα expression by PS2+ scoring as determined by the Vent ana FOLR1 (FOLR -2.1) CDx assay.

50 This study will be opened/active at approximately 200 sites globally. Eligible patients (N = 430), 
who have provided informed consent and meet study entry criteria will be randomized (1:1) to 
one of two arms:  
• Arm 1 (n = 215): MIRV 6 mg/kg AIBW Q3W  
• Arm 2 (n = 215): IC Chemo, at one of the following regimens as determined by the 
Investigator prior to randomization:  
− Paclitaxel (Pac; 80  mg/m2) administered QW  
− Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD; 40  mg/m2) administered Q4W  
− Topotecan (Topo; 4 mg/m2) administered either on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 
4 weeks (Q4W) or for 5 consecutive days (1.25 mg/m2 Days 1 –5) Q3W  
Patients will be stra tified by the following variable at baseline:  
• Number of prior lines of therapy (1 vs. 2 vs. 3)  
• IC Chemo (Pac vs. PLD vs. Topo) chosen prior to randomization  
Disease progression will be evaluated by the Investigator using RECIST v 1.1  (Appendix B ). CT 
or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans will be collected and held for sensitivity analysis by a BICR.  
Patients will continue to receive study drug until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, death, or until the Sponsor terminates the study (whichever comes first).  
Tumor assessments, including radiological assessments by CT/MRI scans will be performed at Screening and subsequently every 6 weeks (± 1 week ) from C1D1 (for all regimens) for the first 
36 weeks then every 12 weeks (± 3 weeks ) until disease progression, death, the initiation of 
subsequent anticancer therapy, or patient’s withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first .  
Patients who discontinue  study treatment for reasons other than progressive disease (PD) will 
continue with tumor assessments until documentation of PD or the start of a new anticancer 
therapy, whichever comes first. Prior to Week 36 (from Cycle 1, Day 1), assessments should 
occur ever y 6 weeks (± 1 week) as allowed by local requirements but must occur at an interval of 
no more than 12 weeks. After Week 36, assessment will occur every 12 weeks (±  3 weeks) until 
documentation of PD, death,  the start of new anticancer therapy  or patient’s  withdrawal of 
consent (whichever comes first) . 
All patients who discontinue study drug will be followed every 3 months (±1 month) until death, 
lost to follow -up, withdrawal of consent for survival follow -up, or end of study (EOS), 
whichever comes first. A ll patients will be followed for PFS2 and survival until 300 deaths have 
occurred.  
Two interim analyses will be conducted, (1) an interim futility analysis (PFS only) when at least 
110 PFS events have occurred, and (2) an interim analysis for OS at the time of final analysis of 
PFS when at least 330 PFS events have occurred. The final analysis for OS will be conducted 
when at least 300 deaths have occurred.

5. STUDY TREATMENT  
5.1. Mirvetuximab Soravtansine  
The investigational study drug, MIRV, will be provided by ImmunoGen, at a protein 
concentration of 5.0 mg/mL in an aqueous pH 5.0 buffered solution. See the Investigator 
Brochure  for complete list of excipients.  
5.1.1.  Mirvetuximab Soravtansine Packaging  
MIRV wil l be provided in a 20 mL glass, single -use Type I vial. The container closure for the 
Type I glass vials will consist of a 20 mm ETFE -coated serum stopper (Flurotec®) on the top and 
product contact surface with a 20 mm aluminum TruEdge® seal with blue Flip -off® top. Refer to 
the Pharmacy Manual for labeling information.  
5.1.2.  Mirvetuximab Soravtansine Accountability  
Specific details regarding storage and handling of MIRV can be found in the Pharmacy Manual.  
Accountability and shipping documents for MIRV must be maintained by the Principal 
Investigator (PI) or designee (eg, the study pharmacist , contract research organization  
representative, or auditor ). The Investigator or designee must maintain an accurate record of all 
MIRV received, stored, dispensed, destroyed, and used in an Investigational Product Dispensing/Accountability Log or equivalent. These records must always be available for 
inspection, and a copy will be supplied to ImmunoGen on request. Information recorded on the Accountability Log will include dates and quantities of drug received, dates and quantities of 
drug dispensed, patient number and initials to whom drug is administered, lot number of drug 
administered, the recorder’s initials, and dates and quantities of drug destroyed or returned. Upon

ImmunoGen, Inc.  
52 receipt, vials should be visually inspected for vial integrity (ie, cracks or leaks) and a record of 
any damaged or suspect drug should be kept on the Accountability Log.  
Upon completion of the study, all MIRV dispatched to a site must be accounted for and unused 
supplies destroyed according to the site’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) or returned to depot (refer to Pharmacy Manual). The original drug reconciliation records shall be maintained 
at the site and a copy collected and sent to ImmunoGen or de signee once a representative of the 
company has confirmed the drug accountability. The clinical trial database shall also record details of MIRV administration such as date and time of administration.  
Drug accountability will be monitored.  
5.1.3.  MIRV Study Treatment Compliance 
The MIRV supplied for the study may not be used for any purpose other than the study or 
administered other than as described in this protocol.  
If necessary, MIRV from different drug lots may be mixed in a single -dose administration.  
Under no circumstances is the Investigator allowed to release study drug supplies to any 
physician not named in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Form 1572 or equivalent form, 
or to administer these supplies to a patient not enrolled in this study. If investigational supplies are to be dispensed from any facility other than that supervised directly by the PI (ie, hospital 
pharmacy, satellite pharmacy), it is the responsibility of the PI to ensure that all study drug is stored and admini stered as described (refer to Pharmacy Manual for instructions).  
5.2. Investigator’s Choice Chemotherapeutic Agents  
Since the type of IC Chemo received is one of the stratification factors, it is required that the 
choice of the chemotherapy agent, Pac or PLD or  Topo, be made prior to randomization. Pac, 
PLD and Topo are supplied as commercially available formulations. Refer to the prescribing 
information or SmPC for complete information.  
A separate Investigational Product Dispensing/Accountability Log or equiva lent must be 
maintained for Pac, PLD, and Topo. Vials should be visually inspected for vial integrity (ie, 
cracks or leaks) and a record of any damaged or suspect drug should be kept on the Investigational Product Dispensing/Accountability Log or equivalent.  
5.3. Assignment of Patient Number  
Patient numbers are assigned in sequential order as patients sign the pre -screening informed 
consent to participate.  
The Investigator will certify that the patient satisfies all eligibility criteria at Screening and continues to satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria on Cycle 1, Day 1 prior to dosing.  
5.3.1.  Enrolled Patient Definition  
Patients who have consented to the study and randomized, are considered enrolled. Patients who 
are issued a patient number, but who do not successfully complete the screening process and are

53 not randomized will be considered screen failures. Patient numbers for patients who screen fail 
will not be re -issued.  
5.3.2.  Patient Assignment to Dosing Regimens  
Eligible patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 t o MIRV 6  mg/kg AIBW Q3W (Arm 1) or IC 
Chemo (Arm 2; Pac, PLD or Topo).  
Cycle 1 Day 1 must occur within seven calendar days from randomization.  
Patients will be stratified as follows:  
• Number of prior therapies (1 vs. 2 vs. 3)  
• IC of chemotherapy (Pac, PLD , or Topo)  
5.4. Blinding Methods  
Not applicable as this is an open- label study. A Data Access Plan will describe procedures to 
restrict access to efficacy data for certain team members.  
5.5. Study Treatment Administration  
5.5.1.  Premedication for Study Treatment  
5.5.1.1.  Mirvetuximab Soravtansine  
All patients receiving MIRV must receive 325 -650 mg of acetaminophen/paracetamol (PO or 
IV), 10  mg IV dexamethasone, and 25-50 mg diphenhydramine (IV or PO) (equivalent drugs of 
similar drug classes is also acceptable) approximately 30 min before each infusion of MIRV. If 
individual patients require more intensive treatment to prevent infusion -related reactions (IRRs), 
investigators may modify the regimen accordingly. An antiemetic  medication  (eg, 5-HT 3 
serotonin receptor antagonists such as palonosetron, granisetron or ondansetron or appropriate alternatives) is recommended before each MIRV dose and may be used any time at the discretion 
of the treating physician.  
5.5.2.  Prophylactic use of Corticosteroid Eye Drops  
Patients receiving MIRV  will be mandated to use corticosteroid eye drops as prescribed by the 
treating physician unless the risk outweighs the benefit as per the ophthalmologist/physician. All 
patients receiving MIRV will be instructed to self -administer 1% prednisolone (Pred Forte
® or 
generic equivalent) 6 times daily on Days - 1 to 4 and QID on Days 5 to 8 of each cycle during 
the study. For individual patients who cannot tolerate the preservative contained in 1% prednisolone, other corticosteroid eye drops may be substituted (eg, difluprednate 0.05%; 
Durezol
®) and administered on Days - 1 to 8 of each cycle at a frequency prescribed by the 
ophthalmologist. Given the lack of availability in some regions, if prednisolone eye drops cannot 
be obtained, alternate steroid eye drops are  acceptable.

54 5.5.2.1.1. Lubricating Artificial Tears  
Patients receiving MIRV will be mandated to use lubricating artificial tears on a daily basis (as 
directed by the product label or the treating physician). Preservative- free lubricating drops are 
recommended. Patie nts should be advised to wait at least 15 minutes after corticosteroid eye 
drop administration before instilling lubricating eye drops.  
5.5.2.2.  IC Chemotherapy  
Patients receiving Pac, PLD or Topo may receive premedication at the discretion of the 
Investigator or according to institutional guidelines.  
5.5.3.  Preparation and Administration of Mirvetuximab Soravtansine  
5.5.3.1.  Calculation for Adjusted Ideal Body Weight  
The total dose of drug is calculated based on each patient’s AIBW using the following formula  
(Appendix E ): 
Adjusted Ideal Body Weight (AIBW)  
AIBW = IBW1 + 0.4 (Actual weight – IBW1) 
Where:  
Ideal Body Weight (IBW)  
IBW1 (female) = 0.9H1-92 
(1H=height in cm; W=weight in kg)  
The weight used for calculation should be obtained before study drug administration on C1D1 
(-14 days) and thereafter should only be modified for significant (≥ 10%) changes in body 
weight (not influenced by weight gain or loss attributed to fluid retention).  
5.5.3.1.1. Preparation  
MIRV is an experimental anticancer drug, and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be exercised when handling this compound. It is recommended that gloves and 
protective garments be worn during preparation. The desired amount of drug should be 
withdrawn from the vial(s) and diluted using 5% dextrose to a final concentration as outlined in the Pharmacy Manual.  
Note: MIRV is incompatible with saline (0.9% sodium chlo ride). Therefore, dilutions 
should be made using 5% dextrose. Infusion bags must be labeled with the protocol number, 
patient number, storage temperature, dose, and volume of MIRV filtered into the bag, or labeled 
according to institutional protocol. Once the solution is prepared, the infusion bag should be 
stored at room temperature protected from direct sunlight, and the infusion must be completed 
within eight  hours of preparation. Please refer to Pharmacy Manual for further details.  
If necessary s tudy drug from different drug lots may be mixed in a single -dose administration.

55 5.5.3.1.2. Administration  
MIRV is administered at 6  mg/k g as an IV infusion following preparation as outlined in the 
Pharmacy Manual. Details on required and compatible infusion materials are also included in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
At C1D1 MIRV study drug should be administered at a rate of 1 mg/min; after 30 min, the rate 
can be increased to 3  mg/min if well tolerated. If well tolerated after 30  min at 3  mg/min, the 
MIRV infusion rate may be inc reased to 5  mg/min. Subsequent infusions may be delivered at the 
tolerated rate. Therefore, the overall length of infusion will vary depending on dose and patient tolerability. After infusion, the IV line should be flushed with 5% dextrose prn to ensure de livery 
of the full dose.  
Patients are carefully observed during each infusion and vital signs are taken as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2, Table 3,  and Table  4). Patients will remain in the clinic under 
observation for four  hours after the first infusion, and for at least one hour after each subsequent 
infusion. While in the treatment area, patients are closely monitored for AEs.  
5.5.3.2.  Preparation and Administration of IC Chemotherapy 
Precautions should be taken when handling Pac, PLD, and Topo. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual 
and package inserts for more information.  
5.5.3.3.  Preparation and Administration of Paclitaxel  
Pac will be administered at 80  mg/m
2 as a 1 -hour IV infusion on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 4-
week cycle. Pac will be prepared as described in the prescribing information and administered IV 
at 80  mg/m2. Body weight at C1D1 ( -14 days) is to be used to ca lculate BSA to determine the 
required dose. No dose modifications are foreseen unless the patient’s body weight changes by 
±10% from baseline.  
5.5.3.4.  Preparation and Administration of Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin  
PLD will be prepared as described in the prescr ibing information and administered at 40  mg/m2 
as a 1  mg/min IV infusion on Day 1 of a 4- week cycle. After Cycle 1, if tolerated, PLD can be 
delivered as a 1 -hour IV infusion. Body weight at C1D1 ( -14 days) is to be used to calculate 
BSA to determine the r equired dose. No dose modifications are foreseen unless the patient’s 
body weight changes by ± 10% from baseline.  
5.5.3.5.  Preparation and Administration of Topotecan  
Topo will be prepared as described in the prescribing information and administered at 4  mg/m2 
as a 30-min IV infusion on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 4 -week cycle. Alternatively, Topo may also be 
administered at 1.25  mg/m2 as a 30 -min IV infusion on Days 1 to 5 of a 3- week cycle.  Body 
weight at C1D1 ( -14 days) is to be used to calculate BSA to determine the required dose. No 
dose modifications are foreseen unless the patient’s body weight changes by ± 10% from 
baseline.

Detailed MIRV and chemotherapy -specific dose modification guidelines are described below.  
5.6.1.  Mirvetuximab Soravtansine  
5.6.1.1.  Treatment Criteria  
In the absence of a TEAE that requires dose modification  (as specified in the management 
guidance for a particular toxicity, see Section  5.6.1.2 ), a patient must meet the following criteria 
to receive study drug at any cycle:  
• ANC must be ≥ 1.5 x 109/L (1,500/ µL) 
• Platelet count must be ≥ 100 x 109/L (100,000/ µL)

Abbreviations : AIBW = adjusted ideal body weight; MIRV = mirvetuximab soravtansine.  
5.6.1.4.  Monitoring and Management of Nausea and Vomiting  
Treatment -related nausea (46% all grade; 1% Grade 3+) and vomiting (16% all grade; 
1% Grade 3+) have been reported in patients treated with MIRV, despite premedication with 
dexamethasone. Therefore, it is recommended that an antiemetic  (eg, 5-HT 3 serotonin receptor 
antagonists such as palonosetron, granisetron or ondansetron) medication is provided before each 
MIRV dose ( Section  5.9.1 ). Additional antie metics may be used any time at the discretion of the 
treating physician, according to institutional or other practice guidelines American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), ESMO, and NCCN. Patients should be advised to contact their 
treating physician at  the first sign of vomiting or worsening nausea.  
5.6.1.5.  Monitoring and Management of Diarrhea  
Mild to moderate diarrhea has been reported in patients treated with MIRV. Patients should be advised to contact their treating physician at the first sign of diarrhea.  Patients may then be 
treated according to standard institutional practice. One suggested regimen would be the 
administration of 2  mg loperamide at the first sign of loose stool, with repeat dosing every 
two hours until symptoms resolve ( Wadler  1998).  
5.6.1.6.  Ocular Disorders  
Changes in visual acuity resulting from reversible keratopathy have been reported in other 
studies of DM4 -containing immunoconjugates that use the SPDB linker ( Younes  2012 ). Patients 
receiving MIRV in the Phase 1 and 3 trials (IMGN853- 0401, IMGN853- 0403) reported ocular 
AEs consistent with reversible keratopathy/corneal epitheliopathy. At the 6  mg/kg AIBW Q3W  
dose level Grade 3 TEAEs of dry eye, keratopathy, vision blurred, eye pain, and photophobia were reported in Phase 3 Study IMGN853-403.  
5.6.1.6.1.  Monitoring and Preventive Measures  
In early dose escalation, there was a relationship between MIRV plasma exposure with increased 
likelihood of an ocular event as well as with response. Exposure -response modeling suggested 
that a dose of 6.0  mg/kg AIBW provided adequate exposure for response while also maintaining 
overall exposure within a range that decreased the potential for ocular adverse events. Due to the observation of ocular disorders consistent with reversible keratopathy/corneal epitheliopathy in patients treated with MIRV, ocular function will be carefully monitored. Ocular symptom 
assessments will be performed  at baseline and at Day 1 of every cycle thereafter ( Table 2 , 
Mirvetuximab Soravtansine (IMGN853)  Dated 04 December 2020  
Protocol Number IMGN853-0416 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  
ImmunoGen, Inc.  
59 Table 3,  and Table  4). Complete ophthalmologic exams will be performed in all patients at 
baseline and every other cycle thereafter if there is a TEAE reported.  
Patients are advised to avoid using contact lenses while on MIRV. Baby shampoo and a soft 
cloth should be used to clean the eyes, and a warm compress at bedtime may be used to decrease any possible inflammation on the eyelid’s surface. Please refer to  Section  5.5.2  and 
Section  5.5.2.1.1  for details on the prophylactic use of steroid eye drops and lubricating artificial 
tears. The use of UVA/UVB sunglasses is recommended in full daylight during the study. The use of temporary lower punctal plugs to increase lubrication of the eyes is optional if lubricating 
artificial tears and corticosteroid eye drops are not sufficient. If patients report signs or 
symptoms of ocular disorders, including, but not limited to, blurred vision or eye irritation, the 
management and dose modification guidelines outlined in Table 8 should be followed.  
5.6.1.6.2. Management and Dose Modification Guidelines  
If a patient develops ocular symptoms of any grade, the patient is required to have a complete 
examination by an ophthalmologist. If a patient develops ≥ CTCAE Grade 2 ocular symptoms, 
treatment with MIRV must be interrupted. Treatment should not be interrupted  solely for Grade 
2 ocular signs (eg, Grade 2 keratopathy) unless they are also associated with Grade 2 ocular 
symptoms. Treatment with MIRV may resume if ocular symptoms improve to Grade 1 or 
baseline within 28 days of the next scheduled MIRV dose (refer to Table 8  for details). If ocular 
symptoms last longer than 28 days, resumption of MIRV may be considered for those patients 
who have experienced clinical benefit if agreed upon between the Sponsor and the Investigator . 
Subsequent eye examinations will be scheduled to occur in every other cycle going forward, from the time that the AE was initially reported, and at either the EOT visit or 30 -day follow -up 
visit after treatment discontinuation, even if the results of the patient’s ocular exam shows no 
obvious clinical findings. Management of treatment -emergent ocular AEs with inflammatory 
characteristics should include corticosteroid eye drops and/or other measures as indicated by an ophthalmologist.

Non-infectious pneumonitis has been observed after the administration of MIRV. Non-infectious 
pneumonitis may result in fatigue, shortness of breath, cough or respiratory distress. Drug-
induced pneumonitis may be immediately life threatening. If a patient presents with signs or symptoms consistent with pneumonitis and/or other clinically meaningful signs or symptom s of 
pulmonary toxicity, the patient should be immediately evaluated. Patients are advised to notify their treating physician immediately if they experience new or worsening shortness of breath, cough or respiratory distress. Patients who are asymptomatic may continue dosing of MIRV with 
close monitoring.  
The management and treatment guidelines outlined in Table 9 should be followed.

63 5.6.1.9.  Potential Infusion -related Reactions  
Some patients treated with IV infusions of therapeutic drugs have experienced concurrent 
infusion- related reactions (IRR) (see CTCAE Version 5.0). The signs and symptoms may vary 
and include for example, headache, fever, facial flushing, pruritus, myalgia, nausea, chest 
tightness, dyspnea, vomiting, erythema, abdominal discomfort, diaphoresis, shivers, 
lightheadedness, hypotension, palpitations, and somnolence. Anaphylaxis might occur at any 
time during an infusion. Before any infusion is started, appropriate medical personnel, medication (eg, epinephrine, inhaled beta agonists, antihistamines, and corticosteroids), and 
other required resources to treat anaphylaxis must be readily available. In general, Investigators 
should manage acute allergic or hypersensitivity reactions according to Institutional practices. General guidelines for the management of acute IRRs and for subsequent retreatment are 
provided in Table 10 . Delayed IRRs may occur; therefore, patients should be advised to seek 
immediate  medical treatment if symptoms newly develop and/or recur after discharge from 
clinic.  
Patients who experience ≥ Grade 2 IRR during or immediately after administration of MIRV will 
have blood drawn for determination of drug concentration and antibodies to MIRV (ADA). The sample should be obtained within three  hours of the onset of the reaction and one week later. 
Such patients should undergo all scheduled efficacy and safety evaluations.

Infusion Reaction 
CTCAE v5.0 Severity Grade Management  
Grade 1: Mild, transient reaction  • Maintain infusion rate unless progression of symptoms to ≥  Grade 2; if 
symptoms worsen, refer to guidelines below.  
• Promethazine (or equivalent) 150  mg PO per day (Q4h) prn for nausea  
• Diphenhydramine (or equivalent) 25-50 mg PO or IV prn  
• Methylprednisolone (or equivalent) 125  mg IV prn  
Grade 2: Moderate  • Interrupt infusion and disconnect infusion tubing from patient

• Diphenhydramine (or equivalent) 25-50 mg PO or IV prn  
• Acetaminophen (or equivalent) 650  mg PO prn  
• Methylpr ednisolone (or equivalent) 125  mg IV prn  
• After recovery from symptoms, resume the infusion at 50% of the previous rate and if no further symptoms appear, gradually increase rate until infusion is completed.  
• For subsequent dosing in future cycles, patients should be pre -
medicated with Dex (or equivalent) 8  mg PO BID the day before drug 
administration and acetaminophen (or equivalent) 650  mg PO and 
diphenhydramine (or equivalent) 25-50 mg PO 30 -60 min before 
dosing.  
Grade 3: Severe, prolonged reaction not 
rapidly responsive to symptomatic medication 
and/or brief interruption 
of infusion; recurrence of symptoms after initial 
improvement; 
hospitalization indicated for clinical sequelae 
OR 
Grade 4: Life-
threatening consequences, urgent interventio n indicated  • Immediately stop infusion and disconnect infusion tubing from patient.  
• Administer diphenhydramine (25-50 mg) IV (or equivalent)  
• Administer IV steroids (methylprednisolone (or equivalent) up to 0.5mg/kg Q 6h) to treat ongoing reaction and prevent recurrence  
• Administer bronchodilators (nebulized albuterol/salbutamol, 2.5-5 mg 
in 3 mL of saline or equivalent) as medically indicated  
• Administer normal saline as medically indicated  
• Administer epinephrine (0.2- 0.5 mL of a 1:1000 dilution (0.2- 0.5 mg) 
SQ or IM) as medically indicated. Epinephrine should only be used if 
all other treatment methods fail to manage the IRR.  
• Advise patient to seek emergency treatment and notify 
Investigator/clinic if the infusion -related symptoms recur after 
discharge from cl inic. 
• Report as an SAE (see Section  9.1.1.2 ). 
• Permanently discontinue study medication treatment

5.7. Discontinuation of the Patients from the Study or Study Treatment  
5.7.1.  End of Treatment  
Patients will continue to receive study drug until they present with PD per RECIST 1.1, as 
assessed by study Investigator, unacceptable toxicity, withdraw consent, or death, whichever 
comes first, or until the Sponsor terminates the study. Study treatment and/or participation in the 
study may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Investigator. The following may be 
reasons for the Investigator to remove a patient from the study drug:  
• The patient suffers an intolerable AE  
• Noncompliance, including failure to appear at one or more study visits  
• The patient was erroneously included in the st udy 
The reason for treatment discontinuation must be captured in the EOT electronic case report 
form (eCRF). Any AEs experienced up to the point of discontinuation and 30 days thereafter 
must be documented on the AE eCRF. All serious adverse events (SAEs),  and those AEs 
assessed by the Investigator as at least possibly related to study drug should continue to be 
followed until they resolve or stabilize, whichever comes first. Patients will continue to be followed for PFS2 and OS, after discontinuing study drug ( Section  10.3.3 ).  
5.7.2.  End of Study  
Discontinuation from participation in the study will be documented on the EOS eCRF. Reasons 
for EOS include withdrawal of consent, lost to follow -up, death, or study termination by 
Sponsor.  
5.7.3.  Withdrawal of Consent  
The patient or legally authorized represent ative  acting on behalf of the patient is free to withdraw 
consent to study treatment and/or participation in the study at any time irrespective of the reason.

72 The Investigator must make every effort (eg, telephone, email, letter) to determine the primary 
reason for this decision and record this information. Study treatment must be discontinued, and 
no further assessments conducted. Further attempts to contact the patient are not allowed unless safety findings require communication or follow -up. If the patient or legally authorized 
representative withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain 
and continue to use any data collected before withdrawal of consent. All biological samples that have been already collected will be retained and analyzed at a later date. The patient or legally authorized representative may request destruction of any samples, and the Investigator must 
document this in the site study records. The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will specify how 
early withdr awals from treatment will be accounted for in the analyses of efficacy endpoints. 
Patients who have withdrawn from the study cannot be re -treated in the study and their inclusion 
and patient number must not be reused.  
5.7.4.  Lost to Follow -up 
A study patient  will be considered lost to follow -up if the patient repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. The Investigator should make all efforts to contact the patient and to determine the patient’s health status, including at least her vital status (in accordance with applicable regulations related to privacy and confidentiality). A 
patient should not be considered lost to follow -up until due diligence has been completed and 
documented. The following actions must be  taken if a patient  fails to return to the clinic for a 
required study visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact the patient and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the patient on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the patient  wishes to and/or should continue in 
the study.  
• In cases in which the patient is deemed lost to follow -up, the Investigator or designee 
must make every eff ort to regain contact with the patient (where possible, 3 telephone 
calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address or 
local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the patient’s medical r ecord.  
Should the patient continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from 
the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up. 
5.8. Period of Observation  
For purposes of this study, the period of safety observation extends from the  time of pre-
screening informed consent until the 30- day follow -up safety visit unless additional follow -up 
safety information is requested as described in Section  9.1 and Section  10.3.1. Short -term 
follow- up for patients who discontinue study drug without documented PD will be followed per 
RECIST  1.1 every 6 weeks (±  1 week)  from C1D1 for the first 36 weeks then every 12  weeks 
(± 3 weeks)  until PD, until the patient begins subsequent anticancer treatment, the patient dies, or 
the patient withdraws consent, whichever comes first. All patients will be followed every 3

73 months (± 1 month) for survival until death, lost to follow -up, withdrawal of consent for survival 
or until EOS, whichever comes first.  
5.9. Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
All concomitant medications and supportive therapy taken within four weeks of Cycle 1, Day 1 
and through 30 days after last study treatment must be recorded on the appropriate electronic 
case report form (eCRF). The identity of all medications, dosage, and route of administration, 
frequency, duration of administration, and indication for use will be recorded in the appropriate sections of the eCRF.  
5.9.1.  Antiemetic and Antidiarrheal Medications  
An antiemetic  (eg, 5-HT
3 serotonin receptor antagonists such as palonosetron, granisetron or 
ondansetron) medication is recommended before each MIRV dose; additional antiemetics and/or antidiarrheal (eg, loperamide) medications may be used any time at the discretion of the treating physician. 
5.9.2.  Folate- Containing Supplements  
Folate -containing supplements should not be taken during the study.  
5.9.3.  Antineoplastic Therapy  
All non- study related antineoplastic therapy including but not limited to cytotoxic, 
immunotherapy, and VEGF -targeted therapy
, is prohibited while on study drug.  
5.9.4.  Hematopoietic Growth Factors  
Patients receiving recombinant EPO or darbepoetin- α before study start may continue to receive 
pretreatment doses.  
The use of erythropoietic and granulocyte growth factors in accordance with ASCO guidelines 
may be implemented at the discretion of the treating physician.  
5.9.5.  Anticoagulants 
The use of anticoagulant agents is allowed. Please see Section  5.9.8  if using apixaban and 
rivaroxaban due to CYP3A interaction potential.  
5.9.6.  Methods of Contraception  
Women of childbearing potential must agree to use highly effective contraceptive method(s) while on study drug and for at least 3 months a fter the last dose of MIRV or at least 6 months 
after the last dose of Pac, PLD, or Topo.  A woman of childbearing potential is a woman who is 
considered fertile, following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless permanently 
sterile. Permanent st erilization  methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and 
bilateral oophorectomy.

74 The following birth control methods may be considered highly effective (failure rate of less than 
1% per year):  
• Combined (estrogen and progesterone) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
o Oral  
o Intravaginal  
o Transdermal  
• Progesterone- only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:  
o Oral  
o Injectable  
o Implantable  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone- releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized partner  
• Sexual abstinence  
Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of contraception if 
it is consistently employed as the patient’s preferred and us ual lifestyle and if considered 
acceptable by local regulatory agencies and IECs /IRBs. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptom -thermal, post -ovulation methods, etc) and withdrawal are not acceptable 
methods of contraception.  
If a contracept ive method listed above is restricted by local regulations/guidelines, then it does 
not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for patients participating at sites in this 
country/region. 
Patients should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the 
fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study. To participate in the study WCBP must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) from the day of study 
medication initiation (or 14 days before the initiation of study medication for oral contraception) 
through the duration of study treatment. Contraception requirements must be adhered to for at least 3 months after the last dose of MIRV and at least six months after the last dose of Pac, 
Topo and PLD. If there is any question that a WCBP will not reliably comply with the 
requirements for contraception, that patient should not be entered into the study.  
5.9.7.  Other Concomitant Medications  
Medications for the treatment of AEs or cancer symptoms (eg, packed red blood cells and pain 
medications), are allowed. Prophylactic use of steroids and/or antihistamines will be considered if needed to alleviate mild -moderate infusion reactions. Additionally, medications (not addressed

antidiarrheals will be allowed to continue.  
5.9.8.  Medications that are CYP3A or MDR1 Substrates or CYP3A Substrates with 
Narrow Therapeutic Index  
In vitro metabolism studies demonstrated that DM4 is predominantly metabolized by thiol s -
methyltransferase (TMT) to form S -methyl DM4, which is further metabolized into sulfoxide -
methyl- DM4. As S -methyl DM4 has been shown to be primarily metabolized by CYP3A, its 
exposure could potentially be increased in the presence of strong CYP3A inhibitors. Drinking 
greater than one serving (250 mL) of grapefruit juice per day should be avoided.  
Both DM4 and S -methyl DM4 are substrates for MDR1 efflux transporter. Their exposure could 
potentially increase in the presence of MDR1 efflux transporter. In vitro metabolism data also 
indicates that DM4 is a time -dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4. The risk of a significant in vivo 
drug- drug interaction caused by inhibition of CYP3A4 or MDR1 is unknown. Treatment of 
patients with con comitant medications that are inhibitors of MDR1, sensitive substrates of 
CYP3A, or are CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index should be carefully monitored (Appendix D ).  
5.10. Overdose and Medication Error 
5.10.1.  Overdose  
There is no known treatment/antidote available for MIRV. For IC Chemo agents, please follow management guidelines for overdose as described in the prescribing information and/or 
institutional guidelines. Supportive measures should be instituted if an instance arises in which a 
patient suffers an overdose of any study drug.  
5.10.2.  Medication Error 
The Sponsor must be notified within 24 hours of any error leading to the administration of either 
10% more or 10% less than the intended dose; in such cases, the event must be reported on the 
eCRF. If an error resulted in a SAE, a Serious Adverse Event for m must be submitted within 
24 hours of the event (see Section  9.2.1 ).

the administration of MIRV will have blood drawn within three  hours of the onset of the reaction 
and one week later for determination of drug concentration and antibodies to MIRV (ADA).  
PK samples may also be obtained as feasible at any time during the treatment period for 
assessment of treatment -related SAEs if deemed appropriate by the Investigator and Sponsor.  
Procedures for collection, storage and shipment of samples are provided in the applicable 
Laboratory Manual.  
6.2. Immunogenicity Assessments – Mirvetuximab Soravtansine  
The potential immunogenicity against MIRV will be assessed at C1D1, C2D1, C4D1, EOT, and 
30-Day Follow -up, as outlined in Table 2 . The potential impact of immunogenicity on PK, 
safety, and efficacy of MIRV and total Ab will be explored.  
The sample for ADA analysis is taken from the PK tube predose on Day 1 of Cycles 2, and 4 and at the EOT and 30- day Follow -up visits. There will be an ADA only collection prior to dosing on 
Day 1 of Cycle 1.  
7. BIOMARKER RESEARCH STUDIES  
7.1. Evaluation of FR α Expression in Tumor Tissue  
FRα expression varies with tumor histology, as reported in the literature and demonstrated in 
preclinical studies ( Section  1.1 and Investigator Brochure ). FRα expression in tumor  samples  
will be analyzed using the Ventana FOLR1 (FOLR1 -2.1) CDx assay  an immunohistochemical 
assay developed to detect FRα in cut slide specimens of formalin -fixed, paraffin embedded 
(FFPE) epithelial ovarian cancer tissue stained on the BenchMark ULTRA automated staining 
instrument using the Ventana OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit. This assay will be conducted at a central laboratory . All patients must submit tumor tissue, or FFPE slides for analysis of FRα

77 expression prior to enrollment. PS2+ is the terminology used to reference a scoring method 
based on membrane stain intensity level of 2 or greater. The PS2+ scoring method requires the 
pathologist (at the central laboratory) to assess the percentage of tumor cells with moderate (2) 
and/or strong (3)membrane staining compared to the total number of viable tumor cells. To be considered positive for FRα expression and eligibility for the study, ≥ 75% of viable tumor cells 
must exhibit level 2 and/or 3 membrane staining intensity
. 
Only patients with the required FRα expression levels by Vent ana FOLR1 (FOLR1 -2.1) CDx 
assay are eligible to enroll in the study (see the Investigator Brochure  Section 5 for details on the 
assay and the FRα expression threshold selected for this study). If a patient wishes to enroll and 
does not have archival materi al available for analysis, she must undergo a biopsy to assess FRα 
expression. Patients for whom the only sites of disease would require biopsy procedures 
considered to be of significant risk must not be enrolled in the study. These procedures include 
(but are not limited to) biopsies of the brain, lung/mediastinum, pancreas, or endoscopic 
procedures extending beyond the esophagus, stomach or bowel.  
Instructions regarding processing and shipment of all samples for FRα testing are detailed in the 
applicable Laboratory Manual.  
7.2. Exploratory Biomarker Studies  
Studies in tumor tissue and blood will be performed to explore potential biomarkers of MIRV 
sensitivity and resistance. The sections below describe activities that are planned, but other 
additional biomarkers/biological pathways may be investigated based on emerging data.  
7.2.1.  Soluble FRα  
An exploratory endpoint of the study is to assess if Soluble FRα levels in blood at  pre-screening 
are predictive or prognostic of response to MIRV or IC Chemo.  The blood sample collected 
during pre -screening will only be used for the measurement of Soluble FRα.  
7.2.2.  Potential Predictive Markers of Drug Response 
The molecular characterization of enrolled patient’s  tumor tissue may be conducted to determine 
the relatio nship between molecular alterations and clinical response, which may help identify 
patients who are most likely to benefit from treatment with MIRV or IC Chemo. Next-generation 
sequencing techniques may be used to evaluate somatic mutations, copy number va riations, 
rearrangements, and expression patterns of multiple genes and/or proteins commonly altered in 
solid tumors.  
New assays for candidate biomarkers associated with sensitivity or resistance to MIRV or IC 
Chemo, identified in the current study or earlier studies, may also be developed and tested on 
patient samples.  
7.2.3.  Future Use of Biomarker Samples  
For patients who consent to it, unused tumor tissue after biomarker testing may be used for other 
research purposes. These other research analyses will help t o understand either disease subtypes 
or drug responses, to develop and/or validate a bioassay method, or to identify new drug targets

78 or biomarkers. These samples will remain labeled with the same identifiers used during the 
study, ie, patient ID. They will be transferred to the Sponsor (or a subcontractor site), which can 
be located outside of the country where the study is conducted. The Sponsor has included safeguards for protecting patient confidentiality and personal data ( Section 13.3). 
8. STUDY PROCEDURES  
8.1. Informed Consent  
Each patient or legally authorized representative will sign an IRB/IEC -approved ICF before any 
study- required procedures are conducted, unless those procedures are performed as part of the 
patient’s standard care ( Table 2, Table  3, and Table  4). Patient  must be re -consented to the most 
current version of the ICF(s) per IRB/IEC guidelines during their participation in the study.  
Patients will sign a pre -screening ICF to allow testing of fresh or archival tumor tissue by the 
assay required for study inclusion and collection of a blood sample for the measurement of 
Soluble FRα . If patients meet entry criteria for FRα positivity (high FRα)  they will sign the main 
study ICF and proceed with remaining screening procedures per the Schedule of Assessments. In 
some cases, the pre- screening ICF and main study ICF may be merged into a single ICF based on 
site-specific guidelines or preference . 
8.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are assessed during Screening (within 28 days before the first dose of any study drug on Cycle 1, Day 1). All screening evaluations  must be completed and 
reviewed  prior to first dose  to confirm that potential patients meet all eligibility criteria. The 
Investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all patients  screened and to confirm 
eligibility or record reasons for  screening failure, as applicable. Procedures conducted as part of 
the patient’s routine clinical management and obtained before signing an ICF may be utilized for 
screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure met the protocol -specified criteria an d 
were performed within the timeframe defined in the Schedule of Assessments. A patient is considered enrolled when randomized to a study treatment ( Table 2 , Table 3 , and Table 4) . 
8.3. Confirmation of Disease Diagnosis  
At Screening, disease diagnosis, and current disease status are confirmed from information in the source record ( Table 2, Table  3, and Table  4). 
8.4. BRCA M utation Status  
The BRCA  mutation status from prior testing (information in the source record) will be recorded 
(Table 2 , Table 3,  and Table 4) . Patients with a BRCA  mutation (germline mutation or somatic 
mutation in tumor tissue) are classified as positive and patients who were tested and shown to not 
have a BRCA  mutation will be classified as negative. Patients without known BRCA  mutation 
status  in the source record are classified as unknown. If a patient with unknown status is tested

79 and is found to have a BRCA  mutation, this patient is considered BRCA  mutation positive in 
analyses.  
8.5. Demographic/Medical History  
The age, race, and gender of the patient are to be recorded during Screening for all patients who 
consent to the study ( Table 2 , Table 3,  and Table 4 ). 
During the Screening period, a complete medical history will be compiled for each pati ent. The 
history will include the background and progress of the patient’s primary malignancy and include a description of all prior therapies for the primary malignancy.  
8.6. Physical Examination, Weight, and Height  
Physical examination (PE), height (Screening only) and weight must be performed as indicated 
in the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 2, Table 3,  and Table 4) . A complete PE, including 
assessments of general appearance, skin, head (eyes, ears, nose, and throat), neck, lungs, heart, 
abdomen, back, lymph nodes, extremities, and neurological system, w ill be completed at 
Screening and at the 30- day Follow -up Visit. Directed PEs will be completed at additional time 
points as specified in the Schedule of Assessments.  
8.7. Vital Signs  
Vital signs include BP and body temperature. These signs are measured as outlined in  Table 2 , 
Table 3,  and Table  4. 
8.8. Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
A standard, single 12- lead ECG will be performed within 14 days  prior to first dose to determine 
study eligibility.  
8.9. Ocular Symptom Assessment and Ophthalmic Examination  
8.9.1.  Ocular Symptom Assessment  
Ocular symptom assessment will be performed at screening for all treatment arms. Ocular symptom assessment will be performe d before the start of each cycle for patients in Arm 1 by the 
treating physician or other qualified individual. For patients reporting > CTCAE Grade 1 ocular 
symptoms, study drug will be held until the patient is evaluated by an ophthalmologist for a 
compl ete examination. The ocular symptom assessment will also be performed at EOT and the 
30-day Follow -up (Table 2, Table  3, and Table  4). 
8.9.2.  Ophthalmic Examination  
An ophthalmic examination will be performed at Screening (within 14 days prior to first dose of study drug) by an ophthalmologist and will include the following: distant visual acuity, best 
corrected visual acuity, slit lamp examination, intraocular pressure me asurement, and indirect 
fundoscopy. Patients who experience ocular TEAEs while on study will have a complete 
ophthalmologic exam performed at the emergence of the symptoms and at every other cycle

80 thereafter. All patients who had an ophthalmic exam on study treatment (post -baseline) will have 
a complete ophthalmologic exam performed at the EOT visit or 30- day follow -up visit ( Table 2 , 
Table 3,  and Table  4). 
8.10. Laboratory Assessments  
Local laboratories will be used for the analysis of scheduled hematology, biochemistry, 
coagulation and other tests collected as part of safety monitoring. Screening labs ( Table 21)  will 
be performed within 14 days of first dose. Repeat testing on Cycle 1, Day 1 is not required if 
tests were obtained within 4  days of dosing and are within acceptable ranges. Repeat testing will 
be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 , Table 3,  and Table 4)  and as 
clinically indicated.  
Note that before each administration of study drug, laboratory results must be reviewed to 
evaluate for potential toxicit y.

81 8.11. Pregnancy S creen  
All WCBP will complete a serum beta -human chorionic gonadotropin (β -hCG) or urine 
pregnancy test within 4  days before the first dose of study drug and urine or serum pregnancy 
tests within 4 days prior to D ay 1 of each cycle and at the 30 -day Follow -Up visit. It is 
recommended to perform monthly pregnancy tests for 3 months after the last dose of MIRV  and 
for 6 months after the last dose of chemotherapy . Additional testing may be performed in 
accordance with institutional requirements or local regulation. Pregnancy tests must be negative 
for the patient to be enrolled and to continue to receive the study drug ( Table 2, Table 3 , and 
Table 4).  
If a patient becomes pregnan t or suspects pregnancy while participating in this study, the 
Investigator and Sponsor must be informed immediately ( Section  9.2.2 ) and the patient will be 
withdrawn from study drug. See  Section  9.2.2  for more details.  
8.12. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status  
ECOG PS ( Appendix A ) will be assessed during Screening and at other times specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2, Table 3,  and Table  4). An assessment is not necessary on Day 
1 of Cycle 1 if the Screening assessment was obtained within the prior 4 days.  
8.13. ECHO/MUGA Scan  
ECHO or MUGA scans will be performed only in patients receiving PLD ( Table  4). ECHO or 
MUGA scans will be performed at Screening and as clinically indicated. The same test should be 
performed throughout the tria l.  
8.14. Tumor Response Assessment  
8.14.1.  Radiological Imaging  
Radiologic tumor evaluation by CT or MRI of chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be performed 
within 28 days before first dose of study drug and every 6 weeks (±1 week) from C1D1 for the 
first 36 weeks on study and every 12 weeks (± 3 week s) thereafter ( Table 2 , Table 3,  and 
Table 4). Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than progressive disease 
(PD) will continue with tumor assessments until documentation of PD or the start of a new anticancer therapy, whichever comes first. Prior to Week 36 (from Cycle 1, Day 1), assessments should occur every 6 weeks (± 1 week) as allowed by local requirements but must occur at an 
interval of no more tha n 12 weeks. After Week 36, assessment will occur every 12 weeks (± 3 
weeks) until documentation of PD  or the start of new anticancer therapy. The same method of 
radiographic assessment used at Screening must be used at all subsequent radiographic 
evaluations. Copies of all imaging scans must be obtained and sent to a central imaging vendor 
designated by ImmunoGen as outlined in the Imaging Manual. The central imaging vendor will assess the quality of the images. The imaging vendor will  be responsible for the formation and 
management of the blinded independent central review (BICR).  
Tumor response will be assessed by the Investigator using RECIST 1.1 (Eisenhauer  2009). 
Response as determined by the Investigator will be recorded in the clinical trial database. If the

ImmunoGen, Inc.  
82 primary endpoint (PFS by Investigator) is statistically significant at the final analy sis, the BICR 
assessment will be used for a sensitivity analysis of PFS and objective response rate (ORR).  
The central imaging vendor will ensure that the central radiologists remain blinded to the local 
assessment from the Investigator and other unblinding information. This and all other imaging procedures will be documented in an independent review charter agreed upon between 
ImmunoGen and the imaging vendor before initiation of any BICR reviews.  
Note: It is very important that the same method of radiolo gic assessment be used 
throughout the study and that the same lesions are followed.  
8.14.2.  CA-125 
Serum CA -125 assessments ( Appendix C ) will be performed within 14 days prior to the first 
dose of study drug, and at each radiologic tumor assessment (± 4 days
) (Table 2 , Table 3 , and 
Table 4). CA -125 should be assessed by the same laboratory throughout the study.  
8.15. Quality of Life Questionnaires  
Quality of life (QOL) questionnaires EORTC QLQ -C30, EORTC QLQ -OV28, EQ-5D- 5L, and 
PGIS  (Greimel  2003 , Osoba  1994) will be used in this trial. The questionnaires should be give n 
to the patient and completed during their Screening visit and at other times specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2, Table 3,  and Table  4). At visits where administered, the 
questionnaires should be completed before other procedures at the beginning of clinic visit. The 
patient should not be sent home with the questionnaires to complete and return at their next visit.  
QOL questionnaires assessments are to continue to be administered for patients in response 
follow- up. Assessment will occur at the time of tumor assessments approximately every 12 
weeks (±  3 weeks) until documentation of PD or the start of new anticancer therapy.  
The EORTC QLQ -OV28 abdominal/GI subscale at week 8/9 is a key secondary endpoint, and 
thus this time point is the most critical, in addition to screening.  
All questionnaires should be provided in the patient’s local language at the beginning of the study visit before any interaction with the study Investigator, including procedures and treatmen ts, and receipt of results from any tests to avoid bias to patient’s response to the study 
questionnaire. Patients should be given sufficient space and time to complete all study 
questionnaires at each visit and should be encouraged to complete any missing responses.  
8.16. Health -care Resource Utilization  
Resource Utilization Data will be collected on the following healthcare resources: hospitalizations, unscheduled office visits, and admission to hospice care or nursing home facility.

83 9. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
9.1. Recording Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs), including those attributed to study procedures, will be documented on the 
AE eCRF and monitored continuously throughout the study from the time of informed consent 
until 30 days after the  patient’s last study treatment.  
Only AEs/SAEs which are considered related to a study procedure (ie blood draw or fresh tumor 
biopsy) will be captured during the pre -screening period, ie from the time of signing of the pre -
screening informed consent (if one is utilized) until the time of signing of the main study informed consent, or until the patient is determined to be a screen failure. All AEs and SAEs, 
regardless of causality, will be captured after the main study ICF has been signed.
 
In patients recei ving MIRV , all ocular AEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or 
return to baseline.  
SAEs will be followed up by ImmunoGen Pharmacovigilance until resolution, stabilization or return to baseline. Beyond this defined reporting period, any unsolicited SAE assessed as related 
to the study drug by the Investigator and reported to ImmunoGen will be collected and processed. Additional information obtained after database lock, will reside solely in the safety 
database.  
The Investigator should follow and provide updates for all AEs until clinical recovery is 
complete, laboratory values return to normal, the patient stabilizes, or death occurs, to ensure the 
safety of the patients. This may mean that observations continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol and that additional investigations may be requested by the Sponsor.  
9.1.1.  Definition of Adverse Events  
9.1.1.1.  Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any noxious, pathologic, or unintended change in anatomical, physiologic, or metabolic function as indicated by physical signs, symptoms, or laboratory changes occurring in 
any phase of a clinical study, whether or not considered study drug- related. This includes an 
exacerbation of a pre- existing condition. AEs include:  
• Worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of conditions present at the 
onset of the study  
• Intercurrent illnesses  
• Drug interactions  
• Events related to or possibly related to concomitant medications  
• Abnormal laboratory values (this includes significant shifts from baseline within the 
range of normal that the Investigator considers to be clinically important)  
• Clinically significant abnormalities in PE, vital signs, and weight  
Mirvetuximab Soravtansine (IMGN853)  Dated 04 December 2020  
Protocol Number IMGN853-0416 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  
ImmunoGen, Inc.  
84 Note that PD should not be reported as an AE unless it is considered to be drug- related by the 
Investigator. 
All AEs, including AEs attributed to study procedures, occurring from the time of study 
informed consent until 30 days after last study treatment must be reported on the AE eCRF, regardless of the severity or relationship to study drug. Only AEs which are considered related to 
a study procedure (ie blood draw or fresh tumor biopsy) will be captured during the pre -
screening period, ie from the  time of signing the pre -screening consent (if one is utilized) until 
the signing of the main study informed consent, or until the patient is determined to be a screen 
failure
. The Investigator should treat patients with AEs appropriately and observe them at 
suitable intervals until the events stabilize, return to baseline or resolve. AEs may be discovered 
through observation or examination of the patient, questioning of the patient, complaint by the 
patient, or by abnormal clinical laboratory values.  
In addition, AEs may also include laboratory values that become significantly out of range. Such 
abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute AEs if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant (eg, cause study drug discontinuation or 
constitutes in and of itself an SAE, or require therapy, and should be recorded on the AE eCRF 
under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis associated with them. In the event of an out -of-range 
value, the laboratory test should be repeated until it returns to normal or baseline or can be 
explained and the patient’s safety is not at risk.  
9.1.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Is life -threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization  
• Requires prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• A persistent or significant disability o r incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalization  
Note that hospitalization is defined as admission to treat a clinical AE. The following events 
would not be considered hospitalizations for SAE reporting purposes: 23- hour hold for 
observation, admission to a hospice facility or nursing home, respite care, outpatient surgery,

85 social admission (eg, a homeless patient) or admission not associated with a precipitating clinical 
AE ( eg, elective or pre- planned surgery, or in- patient administration of subsequent 
chemotherapy, etc).  
9.1.1.3.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
There are no AEs of special interest (serious or nonserious) associated with MIRV.  
9.1.2.  Classification of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0 (effective 27 November 2017). If 
the AE is not listed in the CTCAE v5.0, it should be graded based on the description given in 
Table 22.  
Table  22: Adverse Event Severity  
Severity  Definition  
Grade 1 (Mild)  No limitation of usual activities.  
Grade 2 (Moderate)  Some limitation of usual activities.  
Grade 3 (Severe)  Inability to carry out usual activities.  
Grade 4 (Life -threatening) Immediate risk of death.  
Grade 5 (Fatal)  Resulting in death.  
Relationship of an AE or SAE to study medication is to be determined by the Investigator based on the definitions i n Table 23.

86 Table  23: Adverse Event Causal Relatedness  
Relationship to Product(s) Definition  
Not Related  No relationship between the event, including laboratory test 
abnormality, and the administration of study drug. There is no temporal relationship and there is unambiguous evidence supporting another cause.  
Unlikely Related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to study drug administration which makes a causal relationship improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide plausible explanations.  
Possibly Related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to administration of study drug, but which could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or 
chemicals. Information on study drug withdrawal may be lacking or 
unclear.  
Probably Related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to administration of study drug, unlikely to 
be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and 
which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal of study drug. The association of the clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, must also have some biologic plausibility, at least on theoretical grounds.  
Definitely Related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality occurring in a plausible time relationship to study drug administration, and which 
cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. 
The response to withdrawal of the study drug should be clinically plaus ible. The event must be definitive pharmacologically or 
phenomenologically, using a satisfactory re -challenge procedure if 
necessary.  
9.2. Adverse Events  
9.2.1.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Any SAE, regardless of relationship to study medication, which occurs in  a patient from the time 
of study informed consent until 30 days after the last study treatment, must be recorded by the 
clinical site on an SAE report form. Only SAEs which are considered related to a study 
procedure (ie blood draw or fresh tumor biopsy) will be captured during the pre -screening 
period, ie from the time of signing the pre -screening consent (if one is utilized) until the signing 
of the main study informed consent, or until the patient is determined to be a screen failure.  The 
SAE must also be recorded on the patient’s AE eCRF, including the Investigator’s assessment 
regarding the relationship of the SAE to the study drug (MIRV, Pac, PLD, or Topo). The 
Investigator will promptly supply all information requested by the Sponsor (or contract res earch 
organization [ CRO ]) regarding the SAE.

87 The Investigator must submit the SAE Report Form to ImmunoGen Pharmacovigilance (or 
designee). This form must be completed and submitted within 24  hours of the Investigator’s 
learning of the event using the contact information printed on the SAE form and contained within the SAE form completion instructions. Follow -up information must also be submitted 
using a new SAE Report Form.  
When reporting SAEs, the following additional points should be noted:  
• The underlying diagnosis or syndrome should be reported as the primary SAE term, rather than the signs or symptoms (signs and symptoms may be described in the 
narrative).  
• An event term of “Death” should not be reported as an SAE, but rather be recorded as 
an outcome of a specific SAE term. Initially, the event term of “death” can be used 
until the actual cause of death is known. If an autopsy was performed, the autopsy 
report should be provided.  
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to ensure that each Inves tigator receives a copy of any 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) report (CIOMS/MedWatch) regarding the study drug and that the report is submitted to the appropriate national regulatory agencies.  
The Investigator (or Sponsor or contracted designee) must promptly report all SUSARs to the 
Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) for review in accordance 
with national regulations. IRB/IEC notification of the SUSAR may take the form of a submission 
of a copy of the CIOMS/MedWatch report or other format accepted by the IRB/IEC. A copy of the CIOMS/MedWatch report and notification to IRB/IEC should be retained in the site’s study 
files.  
In addition to CIOMS/MedWatch reports, the Sponsor will also notify (through annual updates 
to the IB) the Investigators and IRBs/IECs of all deaths that occur during the study, irrespective 
of relationship to study medication.  
9.2.1.1.  Reporting of Disease Progression  
Disease progression is an anticipated occurrence in oncology drug development  and is not an AE 
unto itself.  
Progression of disease should not be reported as an SAE term; any serious medical 
event/condition that results from progression of underlying disease, if untoward, should be 
reported as the SAE.  
Progression of disease with a fatal outcome does not need to be reported as an AE term. The 
applicable protocol CRF page(s) pertaining to death should be appropriately completed however, 
as disease progression.  
9.2.2.  Reporting a Pregnancy  
Pregnancy and lactation are exclusion criteria. Wom en of child bearing potential (WCBP), 
defined as a sexually mature woman who has not undergone surgical sterilization or who has not 
been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (ie, who has had menses any

88 time in the preceding 12  conse cutive months) must agree to use highly effective contraceptive 
methods (as defined in Section  5.9.6 ) while on study drug and for at least 3 months after the last 
dose of MIRV and for at least 6 months after the last dose of IC Chemo (Pac, PLD, and Topo).  
In addition, it is recommended that patients undergo monthly pregnancy test s for at least 
3 months a fter the last dose of MIRV.  
The Sponsor must be immediately notified in the event of a pregnancy occurring during the 
study and through 30 days after a patient’s last dose of study drug. Pregnancy is not an AE unto 
itself and therefore should not be report ed as an AE.  
All pregnancies will be recorded on a Pregnancy Report and submitted according to the contact information on the form and in the completion guidelines.  
Pregnancies, with the permission of the mother, will be followed to completion or terminati on 
using the designated sections of the Pregnancy report form.  
Any SAE, occurring during the pregnancy to the mother or fetus, would require that a study SAE form also be completed/submitted.  
10. STUDY ACTIVITIES  
All study visits and assessments that must be p erformed during the study and follow -up are 
included in Table  2, Table 3 , and Table 4 . 
10.1. Screening Visit  
The Investigator is responsible for keeping a record of all patients screened for entry into the study, including those who are subsequently excluded. The reason(s) for exclusion must be 
recorded.  
10.1.1.  Standard of Care Assessments  
In some cases, clinical assessments performed before obtaining informed consent may be used to 
qualify the patient for the study if performed within the screening window. These include 
radiologic tumor assessment, PEs, hematology results, serum chemistry results, coagulation 
results, urinalysis, or other assessments which may be considered part of standard of care. In these cases, repeat assessments may not be necessary before enrollment, unless individual 
parameters require further study or confirmation and are clinically appropriate.  
Note that safety blood tests, and PE do not need to be repeated if normal and conducted within 4 
days prior to C1D1.  
10.2. End of Treatment Visit  
Patients may voluntarily withdraw from the study drug at any time for any reason, and without 
prejudice to further treatment. In addition, patients may be with drawn by the Investigator if they 
do not feel the patient is deriving clinical benefit or because the patient is experiencing 
unacceptable toxicity. The reasons for which a patient may be prematurely discontinued are listed in  Section  5.6.2.2 , Section  5.6.3.2 , and Section  5.6.4.3 .

89 Patients who withdraw or are removed from the study treatment will have an EOT visit within 7 
days of the decision to discontinue study drug.  
Additionally, these patients will undergo a 30- day follow -up safety visit. The eCRF will capture 
reasons for withdrawal.  
10.3. Follow -up Assessments  
10.3.1.  Safety Follow -up 
A safety follow -up visit will occur 30 days (+14 days) after last dose of study drug .  
In some cases, nonserious AE observations may continue beyond the safety visit. All ocular AEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or return to baseline. In these instances, additional information may be requested by ImmunoGen to adequately categorize the nature of the toxicity.  
All serious adverse events will be followed until they resolve, stabilize or return to baseline, 
regardless of time from last dose or last visit.  
10.3.2.  Response Follow -up 
Patients who discontinued study treatment for reasons other than PD will continue with tumor 
assessments until documentation of PD or the start of a new anticancer therapy, whichever 
comes first. Prior to Week 36 (from Cycle 1, Day 1), assessments should occur every 6 weeks (± 1 week) as allowed by local requirements but must occur at an interval of no more than 12 
weeks. After Week 36, assessment will occur every 12 weeks (± 3 weeks) until documentation of 
PD or the start of new anticancer therapy.  Additional survival follow -up calls may occur 
periodically if needed.  
10.3.3.  PFS2 and Survival Follow -up 
All patients who discontinue study treatment for any reason will be followed for survival after 
disease progression a s per Investigator, or after start of anticancer therapy. All patients will be 
followed for survival every 3 months (± 1 month) until death, lost to follow -up, withdrawal of 
consent for survival follow -up or until EOS, whichever comes first. Additional survival follow -
up calls may occur periodically if needed.  
For the purposes of evaluating PFS2, information related to subsequent anticancer therapies and disease progression during survival follow -up will be collected.  
11. STATISTICAL METHODS  
This is a Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy of MIRV compared with that of 
standard of care IC Chemo in patients with in high FRα expressing, platinum- resistant, advanced 
high- grade epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancers.  
All randomized patients will comprise the intent- to-treat (ITT) population. Efficacy will be 
evaluated using the ITT population. Safety will be evaluated in the population of randomized 
patients who have received at least one dose of study drug.

90 All statistical analyses will be performed using the most recently released SAS statistical 
software, unless otherwise noted. For categorical variables, the number (n) and percent of each 
category within a parameter will be presented. For continuous variables, the sample size (n ), 
mean, median, and standard deviation, as well as the minimum and maximum values, will be 
presented. Missing data will not be imputed unless otherwise stated. There will be a detailed 
description of patient disposition, patient demographics, and baseline  characteristics.  
A SAP will fully describe the planned analyses for this trial and will be finalized prior to 
database lock. The safety analyses will be based on patients who receive at least one dose of 
MIRV or IC Chemo.  
11.1. Sample Size  
Primary endpoint is PFS per Investigator assessment. The study is designed to test the null 
hypothesis that the survival function for PFS is the same between the MIRV arm and the IC 
Chemo arm vs. the alternative hypothesis that the survival function of PFS is different betwee n 
MIRV and IC Chemo arm. Approximately 430 patients will be randomized 1:1 (approximately 
215 patients each in the MIRV and IC Chemo arms, respectively) over a period of approximately 
18 months. The final analysis of PFS will be conducted when at least 330 events have occurred. 
The study will have 90% power to detect a PFS HR of 0.7. An interim futility analysis for PFS 
will be conducted when at least 110 events have occurred. The study may stop if the observed 
HR for PFS at the futility interim analysis is  > 1. No alpha -spending is needed for this futility 
only analysis.  
The final analysis of OS will be conducted when at least 300 events have occurred. There will be one interim analysis (IA) for OS at the time of final analysis of PFS, at which time 
approxi mately 200 (60%) deaths will have been observed. A Lan- DeMets alpha-spending 
function using an O’Brien- Fleming stopping boundary will be used to control overall type I error 
for OS at 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05. The study will have 90% power to detect an OS HR of 
0.6857.  
Only if the primary endpoint of PFS is statistically significant, a hierarchical testing procedure 
will be used to control the study- wise error rate (SWER) for key secondary endpoints of ORR, 
OS, and the primary PRO, in that order.  
Sample  size and power was determined using R gsDesign and gsSurv packages with the 
following assumptions:  
• Median PFS for the IC Chemo arm is 3.5 months  
• Median PFS for the MIRV arm is 5 months  
• Overall attrition rate for PFS event is 13%  
• Median OS for the IC Chemo arm is 12 months  
• Median OS for the MIRV arm is 17.5 months

91 11.2. Stratification  
Randomization will be stratified by:  
• Number of prior lines of therapy (1 vs. 2 vs. 3)  
• IC Chemo (Pac vs. PLD vs. Topo)  
Since the type of IC Chemo received is one of the stratificati on factors, it is required that the 
choice of the chemotherapy agent (Pac, PLD, or Topo) be made prior to randomization.  
11.3. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
PK parameters will not be calculated due to the sparse sampling scheme in this study. Summary 
statistics of the concentration at each time point (nominal time) will be presented. Graphical presentation of the data may also be completed using nominal time.  
11.4. Safety Analyses  
Safety analyses will be based on patients who receive at least one dose of MIRV or IC Chemo.  
Adverse events and concomitant medication will be listed.  
Adverse events will be coded using the latest Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activit ies 
(MedDRA) version and summarized per system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary 
(WHO -DD; 01 September 2019 or later version). A dictionary listing of all unique concomitant 
medications used in the study will be provided.  
All hematology, blood chemistry, and vital signs will be listed per patient for each assessment and descriptive statistics will be tabulated for select criteria. Changes from baseline in hematology, blood chemistry, and vital signs will be summarized by treatment. Shifts in 
hematology and blood chemistry from Baseline values will be summarized. Plasma also will be evaluated for the presence of ADA.  
11.5. Efficacy  
Unless stated otherwise in the SAP,  efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population. 
The ITT population is defined as all randomized patients.  
11.5.1.  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
11.5.1.1.  Progression -Free Survival  
Primary endpoint is PFS per Investigator assessment. The study is designed to test the  null 
hypothesis that the survival function for PFS is the same between the MIRV arm and the IC Chemo arm vs. the alternative hypothesis that the survival function of PFS is different between MIRV and the IC Chemo arm.  
The final analysis of PFS will be co nducted when at least 330 events have occurred. The study 
will have 90% power to detect a PFS HR of 0.7. An interim futility analysis for PFS will be

ImmunoGen, Inc.  
92 conducted when at least 110 events have occurred. The study may stop if the observed HR for 
PFS at the fut ility IA is > 1. No alpha -spending is needed for this futility only analysis.  
The primary endpoint of Investigator -assessed PFS, will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier 
method. Comparison between treatment arms will be conducted using Cox proportional hazard regression and log rank test.  
The null hypothesis is:  
• H0: the survival function for PFS is the same between MIRV arm and IC Chemo arm  
And the alternative hypothesis is:  
• Ha: the survival function for PFS is different between MIRV arm and IC Chemo arm  
The primary endpoint of PFS will be tested using stratified log- rank test (stratified by the 
stratification factors used in randomization).  
11.5.2.  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
11.5.2.1.  Object ive Response Rate  
Objective response includes best response of CR or PR.  
The secondary endpoint of ORR (objective response = CR + PR) will be estimated along with a 95% CI. The ORR of the MIRV arm and that of the IC Chemo arm will be compared using the 
Stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test for treatment comparison and Clopper -Pearson 
method for 95% CI estimation.  
11.5.2.2.  Overall Survival  
The secondary endpoints of OS, DOR, and PFS (as assessed by the Investigator) will be 
estimated using Kaplan -Meier metho d for survival function estimate. Comparison between 
treatment arms will be conducted using Cox proportional hazard regression and log rank test and a stratified log -rank test for hypothesis testing.  
The final analysis of OS will be conducted when at least  300 events have occurred. There will be 
one IA for OS at the time of final analysis of PFS, at which time approximately 200 (60%) 
deaths will have been observed. A Lan- DeMets alpha- spending function using an O’Brien-
Fleming stopping boundary will be used to control overall type I error for OS at 2- sided alpha 
level of 0.05. The study will have 90% power to detect an OS HR of 0.6857.  
11.5.2.3.  Patient Reported Outcomes  
The abdominal/GI scale of EORTC QLQ -OV28 PRO will be a key secondary endpoint and will 
include the  number of patients achieving at least a 15  point absolute improvement at Week 8/9 
assessment.  
11.6. Interim Analysis  
Two IAs will be conducted during the study.  
Mirvetuximab Soravtansine (IMGN853)  Dated 04 December 2020  
Protocol Number IMGN853-0416

ImmunoGen, Inc.  
93 The first interim analysis is futility only and will be conducted when at least 110 PFS events 
have occurred. The study may stop for futility if the observed PFS HR is >  1. This IA applies to 
PFS only.  
The second IA will be conducted at the final analysis of PFS when at least 330  PFS events have 
occurred. This IA applies to OS only and will be the first interim look of OS. A Lan -DeMets 
alpha- spending function using an O’Brien- Fleming stopping boundary is used to control overall 
type I error for OS at 2- sided alpha level of 0.05. It is projected that approximately 200 deaths 
will have occurred at this IA.  
The final analysis of OS will be conducted when at least 300 deaths have occurred. It is projected 
that the final analysis for OS will be approximately 1 year after the final analysis of PFS.  
If the primary endpoint of PFS is statistically sign ificant and preliminary data suggest that 300 
deaths will not occur within 1 year after the final analysis of PFS, another IA of OS may be 
conducted 1 year after the final analysis of PFS and the stopping boundary will be adjusted 
according to the prespeci fied alpha -spending method.  
11.7. Patient -reported Outcomes  
The EORTC QLQ -C30, EORTC QLQ -OV28, EQ-5D-5L , and PGIS  questionnaires will be used 
to collect data on the patient’s functioning, health- related QOL, disease symptoms and health 
status.  
The primary PRO endpoint is the number of patients achieving at least a 15% (  ≥ 15-point) 
absolute improvement on the QLQ -OV28 abdominal/GI symptom subscale (items 31- 36) at the 
Week 8/9 assessment ( Stockler  2014 ). Patients with missing week 8/9 questionnaires will be 
excluded from analysis unless they have PD or death prior to week 8/9 assessment in which case they will be included as unimproved.  
Results will be summarized  and presented by each treatment arm. Comparison between the two 
treatment arms will be carried out using appropriate statistical tests. Details of the analysis methods for PRO endpoints will be described in a PRO Statistical Analysis Plan.  
11.8. Multiple Compar isons  
11.8.1.  Multiple Comparisons for Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
No multiple comparisons are needed for a single primary efficacy endpoint.  
11.8.2.  Multiple Comparisons for Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
If the primary endpoint of PFS is statistically significant at 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05, the 
hierarchical testing procedure will be used to test the key secondary endpoints in the following order at 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05 to control the study- wise type I error.  
• ORR per RECIST 1.1 criteria as assessed by the Investigator  
• OS (time from randomization to death from any cause)  
• Primary PRO endpoint of abdominal/GI Symptom Scale of EORTC QLQ -OV28

95 made to the IRB/IEC, including a list of all reports and documents submitted. AEs, which are 
subject to expedited reporting to the FDA or other regulatory agencies (SUSARs), must be 
submitted promptly to the IRB/IEC.  
13.1.2.  Patient Information and Consent  
An ICF that includes information about the study will be prepared and given to the patient, or the 
patient’s legally authorized  representative(s). The ICF will contain all FDA and ICH -required 
elements and be approved by an IRB/IEC. The ICF must be in a language understandable to the 
patient or the patient’s legally authorized representative(s). Before enrolling in the clinical study, 
the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the clinical study will be explained to the patient 
or the patient’s legally authorized representative(s) in a form understandable to him or her. After the patient or the patient’s legally authorized rep resentative(s) has been given ample time to read 
and ask questions regarding the ICF and has been informed that participation is voluntary, the patient or the patient’s legally authorized representative(s) must give consent in writing. If the patient or th e patient’s legally authorized representative(s) is unable to read, oral presentation 
and explanation of the written ICF and information to be supplied must take place in the presence of an impartial witness. Consent must be confirmed orally and by the personally dated signature of the patient or by the patient’s legally authorized representative(s). The witness and 
the person conducting the informed consent discussions must also sign and personally date the 
informed consent document. The informed consent process must  be recorded and dated in the 
patient’s source document.  
A copy of the signed and dated consent document(s) must be given to the patient or the patient’s legally authorized representative(s). The original signed and dated consent document will be retained by the Investigator. Patient confidentiality will be maintained as outlined in 
Section  13.3. 
The Investigator must not undertake any measures specifically required solely for the clinical  
study until valid informed consent has been obtained.  
A model of the pre -screening and the main study ICF will be provided to the sites separately for 
this protocol. The main study consent can be used to confirm a patient’s consent to all study 
procedures and all study- specific screening tests. The pre- screening ICF can be used to pre -
screen patients for FRα status before performing any additional study related tests , as well as 
collect a blood sample f or Soluble FRα . If a patient is eligible based on FRα expression level, the 
patient will be provided the main study consent and only after signing the main study ICF will 
additional study- specific screening tests be performed. Alternatively, the patient can be 
consented on both pre -screening and main study ICF at the same time; and FRα testing and 
study- specific screening assessments can be carried out in parallel.  
Patients must be consented to the most current version of the ICF during their participation  in the 
study.  
13.2. Investigators and Study Administrative Structure  
Before initiation of the study, the Investigators at US sites must provide the Sponsor with a 
completed Form FDA 1572 or equivalent form. Study medications must be administered only

Protocol Number IMGN853-0416 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  
ImmunoGen, Inc.  
96 under the  supervision of the Investigators listed on this form. Curriculum vitae must be provided 
for the Investigators and sub- investigators listed on Form FDA 1572 or equivalent form.  
The Investigator must ensure that all persons assisting with the study are adequately informed 
about the protocol, any amendments to the protocol, the study treatments, and their study related duties and functions. The Investigator must maintain a list of sub- investigators and other 
appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she has delegated significant study related duties.  
13.3. Patient Confidentiality  
Patient names will not be supplied to the Sponsor. If the patient name appears on any documents, it must be redacted before a copy of the document is supplied to the Sponsor. Study findings 
stored on a computer will be stored in accordance with local data protection laws. Patient blood 
and tissue samples, and radiographic images sent to outside laboratories and/or CROs are 
identified by study patient number only to ensure maintenance of confidentiality. The patient 
consent form will state publications resulting from this study will not refer to patient name or 
include any other information that might disclose the identity of the patient. The patients will be told that representatives of the Sponsor, a designated CRO, the IRB/IEC, or regulatory 
authorities may inspect their medical records to verify the information collected, and that all 
personal information made available for inspection will be handled in strictest confidence and in accor dance with local data protection laws. The Investigator will maintain a personal patient 
identification list (patient numbers with the corresponding patient names) to enable records to be 
identified.  
13.4. Study Monitoring  
Sponsor or its designee will monitor the conduct of the trial on a regular basis throughout the duration of the study, according to the monitoring plan and in compliance with ICH -GCP 
E6(R2). Monitoring of the study will serve to ensure: (a) The rights and well -being of human 
subjects are protected; (b) The reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documentation; and (c) The conduct of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), with GCP, and with applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
The study monitor will train site personnel on the conduct of the trial. The monitor will assess the trial site’s compliance with the protocol and will periodically review and verify a sample of 
the patient data recorded on CRFs against source documentati on. The study monitor will also 
review documents that provide evidence of the proper consent and eligibility of enrolled patients, 
the compliant conduct of study procedures, the administration and disposition of investigational 
product(s), the reporting of  serious adverse events and adverse reactions, and the continued 
maintenance of trial records.   
The Investigator will allocate adequate time to support such monitoring activities. The Investigator will also ensure that the monitor is given reasonable remote and/or on- site access to 
study- related documents, source documents (regardless of media) and study- related facilities (eg, 
investigational pharmacy, etc). Queries may be raised if any datum is unclear or contradictory. 
The Investigator and site personnel  must address all queries in a timely manner .

Electronic case report forms (eCRFs) are provided for each patient. All forms must be filled out 
by authorized study personnel. The Investigator is required to sign/e -sign the eCRF after all data 
have been captured for each patient. If corrections are made after review and signature by the 
Investigator, he or she must be made aware of the changes, and his or her awareness documented by re -signing the eCRF.  
13.7. Critical Documents  
Before ImmunoGe n initiates the study at a given site, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to 
ensure that the following documents are made available to ImmunoGen or their designee:  
• Curricula vitae of Investigator and sub- Investigator(s) (current, dated and signed or 
supported by an official regulatory document)  
• Signed and dated agreement of the final protocol  
• Signed and dated agreement of any amendment(s), if applicable  
• Approval/favorable opinion from the IRB/IEC clearly identifying the document and 
document revision reviewed, including but not limited to, the protocol, any protocol amendments, Investigator Brochure, Patient Information/ICF,  and any other written 
information to be provided regarding patient recruitment procedures  
• Copy of IRB/IEC approved Patient Information/ICF/any other written 
information/advertisement

98 • List of IRB/IEC Committee members/constitution or equivalent compliance statement  
• Study and Financial agreement(s)  
• Completed Form FDA 1572 or equivalent form  
• Completed Financial Disclo sure Form  
Additional documents such as laboratory reference ranges and certifications will be collected 
during the study. Ongoing regulatory approvals and notifications, as required, must also be made available to ImmunoGen.  
13.8. Protocol Adherence  
Each Investi gator must adhere to the protocol as detailed in this document and agree that any 
changes to the protocol must be approved by ImmunoGen’s authorized representative in writing 
before seeking approval, where necessary, from the IRB/IEC, Research Ethics Commi ttee 
(REC), or Ethics Review Board (ERB). Each Investigator will be responsible for allowing only 
those patients who have met protocol eligibility criteria to be enrolled.  
Modifications to the protocol should not be made without agreement of the Investigators and 
ImmunoGen. Changes to the protocol will require written IRB/IEC, REC, or ERB 
approval/favorable opinion before implementation, except when the modification is needed to 
eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to patients. The IRB/IEC/REC/ERB may provide e xpedited 
review and approval/favorable opinion for minor change(s) in ongoing studies that have the 
approval/favorable opinion of the IRB/IEC/REC/ERB. ImmunoGen will submit all protocol 
modifications to the appropriate regulatory authorities in accordance with the governing 
regulations. 
When immediate deviation from the protocol is required to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to 
patients, the Investigator will contact ImmunoGen, if circumstances permit, to discuss the planned course of action. Any departures from the protocol must be fully documented in the 
source documentation.  
Prospective waivers or exemptions are not permitted.  
13.9. End of Study  
EOS will occur after the final analysis of OS, which will be conducted when at least 300 deaths 
have occurred. It is projected that the final analysis for OS will be approximately 1 year after the 
final analysis of PFS. After the final analysis of OS, the last survival follow -up visit for the last 
patient will be performed and the study will close. At the time of the f inal analysis for OS, if 
patients are still receiving clinical benefit from study treatment at EOS, either the study will be 
amended to allow those patients to  continue to receive treatment  with limited data collection (eg 
SAEs, dosing information) until they are no longer  benefiting or patients will be given the option 
to roll -over to  a long- term extension study.

99 13.10.  Study Termination  
If the Sponsor, an Investigator, or Clinical Study Monitor discovers conditions arising during the 
study that indicate that th e clinical investigation should be halted due to an unacceptable patient 
risk, the study must be terminated after appropriate consultation between ImmunoGen and the Investigators. In addition, a decision on the part of ImmunoGen to suspend or discontinue 
development of the study drug may be made at any time.  
Within 15 days of premature closure, ImmunoGen must notify the competent authorities and 
IECs/IRBs of any member state where the study is being conducted, providing the reasons for 
study closure.  
13.11.  Site Termination  
If ImmunoGen, an Investigator, or regulatory authorities discover conditions during the study 
that indicate that the study or related activities at a particular center should be terminated, this action may be taken after appropriate consultatio n between ImmunoGen and the Investigator. 
Conditions that may warrant study or center termination include but are not limited to:  
• Discovery of an unexpected, serious, and/or unacceptable risk to patients enrolled in 
the study 
• Decision on the part of ImmunoGen to suspend or discontinue testing, evaluation, or development of the clinical program  
• Unacceptable benefit -risk relationship of the investigational product  
• Recommendations of the IDMC or regulatory body 
• Investigator failure to comply with applicable re gulatory authority requirements or 
protocol requirements  
• Submission of knowingly false information from the center to ImmunoGen or regulatory authorities  
Study or center termination and follow -up will be performed in compliance with the conditions 
set fort h in 21 CFR Section 312 and in compliance with the principles set forth in International 
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practices (GCPs).  
13.12.  Access to Source Documentation  
According to the ICH E6 GCP, the monitoring team must check the clinic al trial database entries 
against the source documents. The ICF will include a statement by which the patient allows the Sponsor’s duly authorized personnel, the IRB/IEC, and the regulatory authorities to have direct 
access to original medical records which support the data in the clinical trial database (eg, patient's medical file, appointment books, original laboratory records, etc). These personnel, 
bound by professional secrecy, must maintain the confidentiality of all personal identity or personal medical information (according to confidentiality and personal data protection rules).

108 APPENDIX  B. RESPONSE DEFINITIONS (RECIST 1.1)  
(Eisenhauer  2009) 
DEFINITIONS  
Baseline:  Baseline is defined as the most recent assessment performed before the first dose of 
study treatment. Baseline assessments must be performed within the period defined in the 
protocol eligibility criteria.  
Measurable Lesions:  Except for lymph nodes (described below), measurable lesions are defined 
as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be 
recorded) as ≥ 10 mm with CT scan (if CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the 
minimum size of a measurable lesion is twice the slice thickness).  
• To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥ 15 
mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be 
measured and recorded.  
• MRI may be substituted for contrast -enhanced CT for lesions at some anatomical 
sites, but not for lesions in the lungs. The minimum size for measurability is the same 
as fo r CT (10 mm) as long as the scans are performed with slice thickness of 5 mm 
and no gap. If MRI is performed with thicker slices, the size of a measurable lesion at 
baseline should be twice the slice thickness. In the event there are inter -slice gaps, 
this also needs to be considered in determining the size of measurable lesions at 
baseline.  
Non-measurable Lesions:  all other lesions (or sites of disease) including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis), are considered 
non-measurable.  
• Lymph nodes that have a short axis < 10mm are considered non- pathological and are 
not to be recorded or followed.  
• Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pneum onitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses 
(not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non- measurable.  
Target Lesions:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per organ and five 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, are to be identified as target lesions and 
measured and recorded at baseline.  
• Target lesions are to be selected on the basis  of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter) to represent all involved organs, and to be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements.  
• It may be the case that on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to 
reproducible m easurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be selected.

109 • Target lesions will be measured at each assessment (longest axis for non -nodal 
lesions, shortest axis for measurable malignant nodal lesions).  
Non- target Lesions:  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including all non- measurable lesions 
(including pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis) and all measurable lesions 
over and above the five target lesions are to be identified as non- target lesions and recorded at 
baseline.  
• Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, 
unequivocal progression of each is to be recorded throughout follow -up.  
• Lymph nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered non-pathological and are not to be recorded or followed.  
Special Considerations  
Clinical Examination of Lesions:  Superficial or visible lesions that cannot be assessed by CT 
scan or MRI will only be considered for response assessment if these lesions are biopsy-proven metastatic lesions and ≥ 10 mm in diameter. These lesions will be considered non -measurable 
and thus non- target for response assessment.  
Cystic Lesions:  Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if 
non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesion.  
Bone Lesions:  Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are not considered adequate imaging 
techniques to measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the 
presence or disappearance of bone lesions.  
• Lytic bone lesions or  mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by cross -sectional imaging techniques such as CT 
or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability  described above.  
• Blastic bone lesions are non- measurable.  
Lesions with Prior Local Treatment:  Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an 
area subjected to other locoregional therapy, are usually not considered measurable; however, if they meet the following criteria, they may be considered for study:  
• there has been prior documented progression in the lesion by at least 2 sequential CT or MRI scans performed after the completion of radiation, or  
• histopathological evidence of progression 
Additionally, if such lesions meet the criteria for measurability, they may be considered target 
lesions.  
Imaging Methods  
The same method of assessment and the same technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline should be used during each follow -up assessment. Imaging- based

110 evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed 
cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam (referring to biopsy- proven visible 
lesions(s) at the vaginal apex).  
Chest X -ray:  Lesions that are identified on chest X -ray must be confirmed and followed by CT 
scan. If there is/are pre- existing chest lesion(s) before the baseline tumor assessment, a chest X -
ray is not necessary to assess those lesions. The pre -existing chest lesion(s) must be assessed at 
baseline and followed by CT scans.  
Conventional CT or MRI:  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan 
based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. If CT scans have slic e thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion is twice the slice thickness. MRI is 
also acceptable in certain situations (eg, for body scan) except for lung.  
CA-125:  Tumor marker CA -125 alone cannot be used to assess response or determine 
progression; however, it will be followed. CA -125 measurements will be performed as indicated 
in Table 2 , Table 3 , and Table 4 . Patients whose CA -125 is above the upper normal limit at 
baseline will need to have their values normalize to ≤ upper normal limit, in addition to complete 
disappearance of measurable or evaluable disease, to be considered in complete response.  
Other methods of assessment, PET -CT, ultrasound and FDG -PET should not be used for 
response assessment in this study.  
Time Point Assessments  
Patients will have tumor measurements performed within 28 days before first dose of study drug and every 6 weeks (±1 week) from C1D1 for the first 36 weeks on study and every 12 weeks (±  
3 week s) thereafter.  
At baseline, tumors and lymph nodes are classified and documented as target or non- target per 
the definitions provided above. It is possible to record multiple non- target lesions involving the 
same organ as a single item (eg, ‘multiple liver metastases’).  
At all post- baseline evaluations, the baseline classification (target, non -target) is to be maintained 
and lesions are to be documented and described in a consistent fashion over time (eg, recorded in the same order on source documents  and CRFs).  
For target lesions, measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation. All tumor 
measurements must be recorded in millimeters.  
At each assessment, a sum of the diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short axis for nodal 
lesions) f or all target lesions will be calculated and reported. The baseline sum of the longest 
diameters (SLD) will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression 
in the measurable dimension of the disease. The lowest SLD (nadir) since, and including, the 
baseline value will be used as reference for evaluating progression.  
After baseline, the actual size of the target lesion should be documented, if possible, even if the 
lesions become very small. If in the opinion of the radiologist, the lesion has likely disappeared, 0 mm should be recorded. If the lesion is present but too small to measure, an indicator of “too 
small to measure” will be provided on the CRF (a default value of 5 mm will be imputed during analysis).

111 Non-target lesions are to be assessed qualitatively (present, resolved, or unequivocal 
progression) and new l esion, if any, are to be documented separately.  
At each evaluation, a time point response is to be determined for target lesions, non- target 
lesions, new lesions and overall.  
Time Point Response Criteria  
Target Lesion Time Point Response (TPR)  
Complete Re sponse 
(CR)  Disappearance of all target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10mm.  
Partial Response (PR)  At least 30% decrease in the sum of diameters (SoD of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline SoD  
Progressive Disease 
(PD) At least a 20% increase in the SoD of target lesion, taken as reference the 
smallest (nadir) SoD since and including baseline. In addition to the relative 
increase of 20%, the SoD must also demonstrate  an absolute increase of at 
least 5 mm.  
Stable Disease (SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.  
Not Applicable (N/A)  No target lesions identified at baseline  
Unable to Evaluate 
(UE)  One or more target lesions are not imaged and the remainder of the SoD 
compared with the nadir SoD does not meet the criteria for PD  
If the target lesion for a patient meets the criteria for both PR and PD at a given time point, the target 
lesion response is PD.  
If the nadir SoD is 0 (ie, the patient had a prior target lesion CR), the re -appearance of any prior target 
lesions to any degree constitutes PD.  
Non-target Lesion TPR  
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor marker 
level if tumor marker at baseline is above the upper normal limit. All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis)  
Non-CR/Non -PD Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of CA -
125 above the normal li mits if CA -125 at baseline is above the upper 
normal limit  
Progressive Disease 
(PD) Unequivocal progression of non -target lesions. Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.  
Not Applicable (N/A)  No non- target lesions identified at baseline  
Unable to Evaluate (UE)  One or more non- target lesions are not imaged and the remaining non- target 
lesions do not meet the criteria for PD  
If the target lesion for a patient meets the criteria for both PR and PD at a given time point, the target 
lesion response is PD.  
If the nadir SoD is 0 (ie, the patient had a prior target lesion CR), the re -appearance of any prior target 
lesions to any degree  constitutes PD.

The overall response at a given time point does not depend upon the overall response assigned at any 
prior time point.  
*Patients with an overall response of CR or PR must have a repeat tumor assessment performed no less 
than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met.  
Confirmation:  The main goal of confirmation of objective response is to avoid overestimating 
the observed response rate. For patients with an overall response of PR or CR a given time point, 
changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments that should be performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. However, the 
presence or absence of confirmation is not considered when assigning a time point response.  
Best Overall Response:  Best overall response, incorporating confirmation requirements, will be 
derived during statistical analysis from the series of time point responses and need not be 
considered when assigning response at any time point.

113 APPENDIX  C. GYNECOLOGIC CANCER INTERGROUP (GCIG) 
CRITERIA FOR E VALUATION OF CA-125 
(Rustin  2004) 
On the basis of the available data and extensive discussions among the cooperative groups within 
the GCIG, it is recommended that the following definition of response be used in ovarian canc er 
trials so that response can be measured by either RECIST or CA -125 criteria. If the response is 
evaluable by both criteria, then the date of response will be the date of the earlier of the two 
events.  
Definition of response:  
•  ≥ 50% reduction in CA -125 l evels from baseline  
• the response must be confirmed and maintained for at least 28 days  
• the pretreatment sample must be ≥ 2.0 times the ULN and within two weeks before 
starting treatment  
• the date of response corresponds to the date when the CA -125 level is first reduced by 
50%  
To calculate CA -125 responses accurately, the following rules apply:  
• Intervening samples and the 28- day confirmatory sample must be less than or equal to 
(within an assay variability of 10%) the previous sample  
• Variations within the normal range of CA -125 levels will not interfere with the 
response definition.  
Evaluation of Progression  
Progression or Recurrence based on serum CA -125 levels will be defined on the basis of a 
progressive serial elevation of serum CA -125, according to the following criteria:  
a. Patients with elevated CA -125 pretreatment and normalisation of CA -125 must show 
evidence of CA -125 greater than, or equal to, two times the upper normal limit on 
two occasions at least one week apart, or  
b. Patients with elevated CA -125 pretreatment, which never normalises must show 
evidence of CA -125 greater than, or equal to, two times the nadir value on two 
occasions at least one week apart, or  
c. Patients with CA -125 in the normal range pretreatment must show evidence of 
CA125 greater than, or equal to, two times the upper normal limit on two occasions at 
least one week apart.  
Elevated values must be confirmed by two separate measurements obtained at least one week apart. CA -125 progression will be assigned the date of the first meas urement that meets the 
criteria as noted. Patients are not evaluable by CA -125 if they have received mouse antibodies 
(unless the assay used has been shown not to be influenced by HAMA [ Taylor 2005  and Rustin 
2005] ) or if there has been medical and/or surgical interference with their peritoneum or pleura 
during the previous 28 days.

114 A patient may be declared to have progressive disease on the basis of either the objective 
RECIST criteria or the CA -125 criteria. The date of progression will be the date of t he earlier of

b Rustin GJS. J Natl Cancer Inst 2005, 97:152, Re: new guidelines to evaluate the response to treatment in solid 
tumors [ovarian cancer].  
Timing of CA -125 assessments:  
The GCIG recommends that CA -125 measurements be taken at specific time intervals.  
• The first sample would be collected within two weeks before treatment is started  
• CA-125 measurements will be performed as indicated in Table 2, Table 3 , and 
Table 4.

115 • For each patient, the same assay method must be used and the assay must be  tested in 
a quality -control scheme. Patients are not evaluable by CA -125 if they have received 
mouse antibodies or if there has been medical and/or surgical interference with their 
peritoneum or pleura during the previous 28 days.  
This CA -125 response definition has been produced to evaluate relapse therapy. If assessing 
therapy that includes two treatment modalities for relapse (eg, surgery and chemotherapy), any 
CA-125 response results from both treatments. CA -125 cannot distinguish between the effects of 
each treatment. To calculate response rates in protocols, an ITT analysis should be used that 
includes all patients with an initial CA -125 level of at least twice the ULN as eligible and 
evaluable. In addition to calculating response rates in protocols,  it is advisable to record those 
patients who have both a CA -125 response and whose CA -125 level falls to within the normal 
range.

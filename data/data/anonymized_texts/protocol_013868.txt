 2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1. Differentiat ed Thyroid Cancer  
 
The annual incidence of thyroid cancer is between 14.2 cases per 100,000 in women 
and 4.9 per 100,000 in  men.1  There will be an estimated 37,200 new cases of thyroid 
cancer (27,200 in wo men, and 10,000 in men) in the United States  alone in 200 9.2    
In 2008, thyroid cancer became the 6th most diagnosed cancer in women.2  Although 
several types of cancer are  derived from the thyroid gland, differentiated thyroid 
cancer (DTC) account s for up to  90% of cases.  DTC arises from thyr oid follicular 
cells and co mprises both papillary and follicular histologies.    Papillary thyroid 
cancer is by far the most common s ubtype, accounted for 70 -80% of thyroid cancer 
overall.  The prognosis  for DTC  is extremely good, with overall 10 -year surv ival 
rates of greater than 90%.  
 
Total thyroidectomy  is the recommended initial treatment for thyroid carcinoma .  Several 
retrospecti ve studies have suggested that near -total or total thyroidectomy improves 
disease -free survival and reduces recurrence rate s.3-5 Following surgery, radioactive 
iodine  (131I) treatment has been shown to decrease recu rrence and mortality in high  risk 
patients.6-8  Radioactive iodine is effective because w ell-differentiated DTCs are able to 
concentrate iodine. 131I emits short path -length (1 -2 mm) -radiation that is cytotoxic to  
thyroid cells. The success of 131I ablation is dependent on the amount of resid ual thyroid 
tissue that is present after surgery  (131I is more effective with less tissue)  and its ability to 
concent rate iodine in the setting of TSH stimulation .  
 
Patients w ho develop recurrent disease are offered surgery if possible. For locoregional 
recurrences that are not surgically resectable, repeat radioactive iodine and/or external 
beam radiation can be considered . For metastatic disease, palliative surgery can be 
performed especially if the tumor involves weight -bearing bones. Other options incl ude 
131I if the radioiodine scan is positive  and/or external beam radiation.6 
 
Post surgical radioactive iodine is not effective in patients whose tum ors do not 
concentrat e iodine.  These tumors have become less differentiated and have lost the 
ability to express thyroid -specific markers, specifically, the sodium iodine symp orter, 
which allows iodine into the thyroid follicle.  Tumors that are not amena ble to surgical 
resection that have lost the ability to concentrate iodine currently have no effective 
therapeutic options.  
 
VEGF and thyroid cancer:  
Thyroid carcinomas are cha racteristically vascular .  Therefore, anti-angiogenic strategies 
have bee n postu lated to be effective in DTCs . Preclinical and anecdotal clinical evidence 
has accumulated suggesting that anti -angiogenic strategies indeed have efficacy.7, 8  
Vascular  endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key com ponent in angiogenesis and is 
important in the pathogenesis of thyroid carcinomas. Viglietto et al. have shown that 
elevated VEGF expression was associated with a high tumorige nic potential in human 
16 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 thyroid tumor cell lines.12 Viglietto et al. also showed that the VEGF receptors, FLT -1 
and flk/KDR, were expressed in endothelial cells that lined tumor -embedded 
microvascular vessels, sugges ting that VEGF, contributes to thyroid tumor development. 
There is now mounting clinical evidence from Phase II trials that the inhibition of VEGF 
signaling has activity in thyroid cancers. Phase II studies of axitinib and motesanib 
diphosphate, two tyrosi ne kinase inhibitors with specific activity against VEGFR, 
showed 30% and 14% pa rtial tumor response, respectively.13, 14  A large number of 
patients also had stable disease (42% and 67%, respectively).  Cediranib is a potent and 
selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3. 
Although it has not been studied in thyroid cancer,  the efficacy of axitinib and motesanib 
diphosphate in thyroid cancer suggests that cediranib may have anti -thyroid cancer activity.  
 
Thalidomides and thyroid cancer:  
Thalidomide was originally developed as a sedative in the 1950s, but its teratogenic 
effects led to its discontinued usage in that setting.  Thalidomide, however, was noted to  
have anti -angiogenic effects.  It has been shown to be an effective therapy for multiple 
myeloma; in addition, it is currently under evaluation for treatment of a variet y of other 
cancers although its exact mechanism remains uncertain. Because thalidomide is not 
activated in rodent models, preclinical efficacy s tudies have not been useful.  Ain and 
colleagues assessed thalidomide’s effectiveness in patients with progressi ve thyroid 
cancer in a Phase II trial.9  A total of 36 patients (11 PTC, 2 tall cell PTC, 4 FTC, 8 HCC, 
4 insular, 7 MTC) with radioiodine -unresponsive progressive disease were recruited.  
Daily oral thalidomide was administered at a starting dose of 200 mg and increased over 
6 weeks to 800 m g or to the maximum tolerated dose.  Of 28 patients available for 
evaluation, 5 had partial responses with a median duration of 4 months and 9 had stable 
disease for a median duration of 6 months.  Fatigue was the most commonly reported 
side effect.  Serio us adverse events included infection, pericardial effusion, and 
pulmonary embolus.  A Phase II study with lenalidomide, a derivative of thalidomide 
with less toxicity, also showed anti -cancer activity.  Data from a Phase II study of 
lenalidomide in patient s with progressive iodine -refractory thyroid cancer has been 
presented.10  A total of 25 patients were initiated on 25 mg of oral lenalidomide daily.  
Of 18 evaluable patients, 67% were responders (22% with part ial response and 44% with 
stable disease.)   Grade 3 toxicities, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia responded to dose 
reduction.  The mean daily dose was 20 mg.  
 
Patient Population:  
Patients with iodine refractory DTC have few therapeutic options. Cytotoxic 
chemotherapy is often ineffective and the most studied agent, doxorubicin, is associated 
with significant toxicity.  
 
Study Design:  
This is a phase I study followed by a phase II, 2 arm, open -label, randomized trial of 
cediranib alone or in combination with lenalidomide.   
 
Patients should have measurable disease (papillary, follicular, Hürthle cell type, or other 
17 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 papillary/follicular variants) and evidence of disease progression (objective growth of 
existing tumors within the last 12 months).  
 
Prior to the r andomized phase II portion of this study, we will evaluate  cediranib plus 
lenalidomide in a phase I  trial at three dose levels of lenalidomide (10, 15, and 20 mg).  
Cediranib will be administered at a starting dose of 2 0 mg daily. Dose escalation will not 
exceed 30 mg cediranib with 20 mg of lenalidomide.   The MTD from the Phase I was 
determined at cediranib 30 mg day 1 -28 and lenalidomide 15 mg on day 1 -21 of the 28 
day cycle.  
After determining the MTD , we will initiate recruitment for a Phase II trial com paring 
cedirinib alone to cedirinib plus lenalidomide. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:2 ratio 
to one of two arms. Randomized stratification will employ prior therapy with a VEGF -
pathway inhibitor (yes vs. no) and performance sta tus (0 and 1 vs. 2).  Su bjects i n Arm A 
will receive cediranib alone at 30 mg daily .  Subjects on Arm B will receive cediranib  30 
mg daily  and lenalidomide 15 mg on day 1 -21 of  the 28 day cycle (as determined abo ve 
in the Phase I trial ).  
 
Each cycle will be 4 weeks in length.  Disease re -evaluation will occur every 8 weeks 
using RECIST guidelines .*  The primary endpoint will be progression -free survival .  
Patients without evidence of anti -thyroglobulin antibodies will continue to have 
thyroglobulin levels measured at each respon se assessment (usually every 8 weeks).  All 
patients are expected to be on thyroxine suppression therapy and thyroid stimul ating  
hormone (TSH) levels will be monitored pre -therapy and every 8 weeks.  
 
*After 1 8 cycles , radiologic disease re -evaluation will occur every 16 weeks.

2.2.1.  Cediran ib 
 
Cediranib is a potent inhibitor of all three vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)  
receptors (VEGFR -1, -2 and -3) at nanomolar concentrations. Inhibition of VEGF 
signaling  leads to the inhibition of angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, neovascular 
survival and vascular  permeability. Cediranib also inhibits c -Kit tyrosine kinase, 
which could be relevant in c -Kit-dependent  tumors .  Cediran ib inhibited the growth 
of tumo rs in preclinical  models in a dose -dependent manner.   A reduction in micro -
vessel density and metastasis was also observed in these preclinical  mode ls. 
Collectively, these changes indica te that cediranib inhibits tumo r growth,  metastases 
and vascular permeability .11  Cediranib is in Phase III clinical development in 
colorectal cancer (CRC) and recurrent  glioblastoma (GBM) and is being evaluated in 
a Phase II program against a broad range of  tumo rs. 
 
Mechanism of Action  
Angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation, is an essential step in tumor  
growth and metastasis.  The inhibition of angiogenesis has therefore emerged as a ke y

 strategy for the treatment of cancer. Although it is possible to disrupt blood vessel 
formation a t several stages in the angiogenic process, VEGF and its receptor 
(VEGFR) provide a promising targe t since VEGF is known to be the most important 
proangiogenic factor.12, 13  Two high -affinity rec eptors for VEGF wit h associated 
tyrosine kinase activity have been  identified on human vascular endothelium: 
VEGFR -1 and V EGFR -2. VEGFR -3, a third  member of the VEGFR gene family, is 
thought to be important for lymphangiogenesis and activated by the ligands, VEGF -C 
and VEGF -D. Although their relative contributions in  mediating tumor  progression 
have not been resolved, a number of studies suggest VEGFR -2 performs a 
predominant role .13 
 
Cediranib is a potent inhibitor of all three vascul ar endothelial growth factor (VEGF)  
receptors (VEGFR -1, -2 and -3) at nanomolar concentrations. Inhibition of VEGF 
signaling leads to the inhibition of angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, neovascular 
survival and vascular  permeability. Cediranib also inhibits  c-Kit tyrosine kinase, 
which could be relevant in c -Kit dependent tumors . 
 
Cediranib inhibited the growth of tumors  in preclinical models in a dose -dependent 
manner.  A reduction in micro -vessel density and metastasis was also observed in 
these preclinica l models . Collectively, these changes indicate that cediranib inhibits 
tumor  growth, metastases and vascular permeability.11 
 
Nonclinical Specificity and Efficacy Studies  
Usin g enzyme -linked immunoabsorbent assays o r scintillation proximity based 
assays ,11 cediranib potently inhibited the tyrosine kinase activity associated with  the 
VEGF receptors, VEGFR -2 (IC50 <0.001 μM), VEGFR -1 (IC50=0.005 μM) and 
VEGFR -3 (IC50 ≤0.003). Cediranib was also found to have activity versus additional 
structurally -related  Class III RTKs (c -Kit, PDGF R)
  at nanomolar concentrations, 
but demonstrated selectivity  versus other tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases 
examined .  The ability of cediranib to directly inhibit tumor  cell growt h in vitro  was 
examined using a variety of histologically distinct tumor  cell types. The IC50 values 
(mean ±SE ) for the inhibition  of tumor  cell growth were 3.0 ±0.4 μM(SKOV -3), 3.8 
±0.5 μM (MDA -MB-231),5.8 ±0.2 μM (PC -3), 6.4± 0.6 μM (Calu -6) and 7.4 ±0.7 μM 
(SW620) .11  These concentrations a re between 7500 - and 18500 -fold greater than 
those required to inhibit VEGF -stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cell  
proliferation .  The data are consistent with cediranib anti-tumor  activity in vivo  being 
attributa ble to inhibition of VEGF signa ling in endothelial cells, rather than a direct 
anti-proliferative effect on tum or cells.  
 
Nonclinical Toxicology Studies  
Single - and multiple -dose toxicology studies were conducted in rats, dogs, and 
monkeys (Investigator’s Brochure , Cediranib (AZD2171) , 2009 ).  Cediranib has not 
shown mutagenic or clastogenic potential.  
 
19 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 Hypertensio n after dosing with cediranib has been observed  in rat s, dog s, and  primate s. 
These changes were  thought to be mechanistically  related  to VEGF.  Hist opathologic 
changes seen in rat s treated with cediranib included choroid plexus vasculitis, ventricular 
myoc arditis and coronary arteritis; these findings were consistent with systemic 
hypertension.  Other changes were seen in the adrenal glands, pancreas , thyroid, liver and 
biliary system.  
 
In primates, doses of 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 mg/kg/day were not tolerated.  P athologic changes were 
observed in the choroid plexus and kidney; these changes were consistent with hypertension 
although a direct effect on these tissues could not be excluded.  In addition, mucosal 
hypertrophy of the gall bladder and bile duct hyperplas ia in the liver were seen.  A dose of 
0.2 mg/kg/day given to primates for 6 months produced minimal changes in the choroid 
plexus and kidney; the majority of changes  showed reversibility after a 3 -month off -
treatment. A dose of 0.025 mg/kg/day was consider ed to be the no adverse effect level.  
 
As anticipated, cediranib showed  reversible effects on female fertility and s ignificant 
findings on embryo -fetal development, consistent with its pharmacological activity.  
 
Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacolog y 
Bioavailability of cediranib after oral administration was high: 70% to 75% in rat and 24% to 
74% in dog.  Absorption was relatively slow with peak concentrations occurring 4 to 6 h 
after dosing. Cediranib pharmacokinetics  indicate high clearance and ver y high volume of 
distribution.   
 
Over the dose ranges examined in rat, plasma concentrations and exposure generally 
increased in proportion to dose; however, in monkey, plasma cediranib concentration -time 
profiles obtained following a single oral dose ind icated that systemic exposure increased in a 
greater than dose -proportional manner over the  dose range 0.05 to 2.5 mg/kg.   On multiple 
dosing, there was limited accumulation (<2 -fold) and no evidence of auto -induction in rat, 
but a slightly greater degree  of accumulation (2 - to 3-fold) was observed in monkey at higher 
dose levels.  
 
Protein binding of cediranib (90% to 95%) was relatively high across all species examined.  
In the rat and monkey, cediranib was extensively metabol ized and considerable amounts  of 
metabolites plus unchanged cediranib were present in the f eces (the major route of 
elimination) and urine.   
 
Cediranib did not induce rat hepatic microsomal P450 activities, but caused a 40% to 60% 
reduction in CYP1A activity at the 5 mg/kg dose level .  Cediranib showed minimal 
inhibitory effects on the activity of human P450  CYP2D6 and  CYP3A4 in vitro ; the IC 50 
values were far in excess of clinically relevant concentrations.  
 
Clinical Experience  
Cediranib has been in evaluated in a number of clinic tr ials.    Phase I studies with cediranib 
were designed primarily to identify the safety, tolerability, and PK profiles of the drug rather 
20 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 than to determine efficacy; however, encouraging evidence of biological and anti -tumour 
activity has also been seen in  these studies.   In Phase I studies, cediranib has shown single 
agent activity in a wide variety of tumors including prostate, renal, colorectal, lung, liver, 
breast, skin/soft tissue, stomach, head and neck, ovarian, biliary duct, thyroid, thymus, 
pancreat ic tumors, acute myeloid leukemia.16-20  A number of Phase II/III studies have been 
completed or are underway.  
 
Phase I experience .  Several  dose escalation and pharma cokinetic studies have assessed the 
MTD for c edirinib.  The MTD is reported between 20 mg and 45 mg daily, depending on  the 
study.   
 
In one study, 83 patients with advanced solid tumors received cedirinib.18  After a 
single dose, maxi mum plasma  (peak) drug co ncentration after a single -dose 
administration (Cmax) was achieved 1 to 8 hours postdosing with  a mean half -life of 
22 hours.  Cedirinib doses of less than 45 mg/d were generally well -tolerated.  The 
most frequently dose related adverse events were fatigue, diarrhea, dysphonia and 
hypertension.  Preliminary results  showed t wo confirmed partial responses and 22 
patients with stable disease.    
 
In a second study in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors, cediranib 30 
mg/day was considered the MTD since 50% of evaluable patients rece ived 45 mg/day 
experienced dose limiting tox icities (proteinuria, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia).14  Of  
32 evaluable patients, two had partial responses and 24 had stable disease greate r than 
8 weeks.   
 
Cediranib has been eval uated in Phase I studies of particular tumors.  In a study of 
patients with  hormone refractory prostate can cer, the MTD was found to be 20 
mg/day .15  One objective response and several PS A declines were noted after the 
discontinuation of therapy .  A Phase I study of cediranib in patients with acute 
myeloid leukem ia reported that cediranib was generally well -tolerated at doses less 
than 30 mg/day.16  Six of 35 patients had an objective response . Cedir anib at two 
doses (30 mg and 45 mg) was evaluated in combination with cisplatin and 
gemcitabine  in a Phase I study of patients with advanced non -small cell lung cancer.23 
 At 45 mg/day, tox icity was increased compared to the 30 mg/day dose.  Confirmed 
responses were observed in four of 12 evaluable patients.   
 
Cediranib is being evaluated in a number of other Phase I stu dies.  Cedinanib in 
combination with gefitinib  is under evaluation in patients with advanced solid tumors  
to determine the MTD of combination therapy .  It is also being evaluated in patients 
with advanced solid tumors in combination with different standard chemotherapy 
regimen s.  Another study is look ing at cediranib in combination with AZD0530.  
 
Phase II and III Experience  
To determine the optimal timing of cediranib administration, 34 patients with 
advanced solid tumors were randomized to receive cediranib 45 mg in a fed or fasted 
21 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 state.17  Both the AUC and C max of cediranib were lower in the presence of food by a 
mean of 24% and 33% respectively.  Therefore, it is recommende d that cediranib be 
administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hour s after f ood.   
 
Because hypertension is a main adverse effect of cediranib, a Phase II study 
investigated hypertension management strategies in 125 patients.  Cediranib 30 mg or 
45 mg daily was administered with or without anti -hypertension prophylaxis.   The 
overall response rate was similar across the treatment groups with evidence of anti -
tumor activity apparent at both 30 mg and 45 mg dose levels, and irrespective of 
whether the patient was receiving prophylaxis.  
 
A Phase II randomized, double -blind, parallel -group study compa ring the efficacy of 
cediranib to placebo in patients with renal cell cancer  showed promising anticancer 
activity.18  At 12 weeks, 20.8% of the  53 patients randomized  to cediranib had a 
partial response compared with none on placebo. The disease  control rate (responders 
+ SD) at this stage was 81% in the cediranib arm versus 22% in the  placebo arm. 
Overall, for patients originally randomized  to cediranib: 34% had partial response, 
47.2% had stable disease, 17%  had disease progression, and 1 was not evaluable.  
Some 78% of the 18 patients with partial response had responses lasting ≥10 months, 
and 61%  had responses lasting for ≥1 year.  
 
A total of 36 patients were enrolled in a Phase II, open -labeled study  of cediranib 45 
mg in patients with metastatic gastroi ntestinal  stromal tumors  (GIST)  or soft tissue 
sarcomas  (STS) .   Some 62.5%  of GIST patients had stable disease.  In the 6 alveolar 
soft part sarcoma  patients, 3 had partial response and 3 had stable disease.  
 
Efficacy of cediranib has also been evaluated in 8 Phase II NCI -sponsored 
monotherapy studies.  Anti-cancer activity has been observed in some patients with a 
wide range of cancer types including recurrent glioblastoma, recurrent epithelial 
ovarian cancer, recurrent or persistent ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer, 
docetaxel -resistant, castrate -resistant prostate c ancer, malignant pleural 
mesothelioma, and progressive stage IV breast cancer.  In some trials, the initial dose 
of cediranib 45 mg daily was decreased to 30 mg daily due to toxicity.   
 
Cediranib is under evaluation in both Phase II/III studies and Phase III studies.  The 
efficacy of cediranib in combination with FOLFOX versus bevacizumab in 
combination with FOLFOX  in patients with metastatic colorectal cance r is under 
evaluation (HORIZON III) .  Following the Phase II portion, patients in the Phase III 
portion received the selected dose of cediranib 20 mg.   In another  Phase III study 
(HORIZON II ), patients with previously untreated  metastatic colorectal cancer are 
being randomized to receive cediranib + FOLFOX or XELOX with placebo + 
FOLFOX or XELOX.  Cediranib 20 mg was the dose selected for the Phase III 
portion  in this study as well .

 Another Phase III study is looking at the efficacy of cediranib monotherapy, cediranib 
in combination with lomustine, or lomustine with placebo in patients with recurrent  
glioblastoma.    A Phase II/I II study of cediranib in combination with standard 
paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy in patients with Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC was 
halted following a recommendation by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee p rior 
to the Phase II I portion as discussed below.  
 
Safety Profile  
Commonly reported adverse events (AEs)  include fatigue, hypertension, diarrhea, 
nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. (Investigator’s Brochure, Cediranib (AZD2171), 
2009) Although cediranib 45 mg daily was determined  as the MTD in early studies, 
later studies have found that 30 mg or 20 mg daily are better tolerated.17, 19, 20 
 
Hypertension has emerged as an important AE and serious adverse event (SAE)  with 
cediranib therapy.  It is the major cardiovascular adverse event associated with 
cediranib therapy.  Hypertension is an expected AE with  agents that inhibit VEGF 
signa ling. In cediranib  studies, increases in blood pressure have been observed, 
including CTC Grade 4 hypertensio n and end -organ damage related to hypertension,  
such as cerebrovascular events.   A Phase II study with looked at cediranib 30 mg or 
45 mg +/ - hypertension prophylaxis found that no single treatment st rategy emerged 
as clearly better managing high blood pre ssure.  Overall, treatment of  hypertension in 
a stepwise fashion  with rigorous monitoring of blood pressure appears to be effective 
in managing cediranib -induced hypertension.   
 
Left ventricular dysfunction, in some cases leading to cardiac failure, has b een 
observed in  patients receiving cediranib with risk factors for left ventricular 
dysfunction (including  previous or concomitant anthracycline treatment).   To 
investigate left ventricular dysfunction, two Phase II studies of cediranib included 
serial echocardiogram/MUGA  studies.  (Investigator’s Brochure, Cediranib 
(AZD2171), 2009 )  The changes in LVEF observed in these two studies appeared to  
be mild and occurred more frequently in patients who had received prior 
anthracyclines. Based on these findings, i t was not considered necessary to implement 
additional monitoring of LVEF dysfunction in studies with cediranib.  
 
A number of events of bleeding and hemorrhage  have occurred. Some events of  
hemorrhage  were fatal but causality could not be unequivocally ass igned to cediranib.  
Gastrointestinal perforation, sometimes associated with fistula formation, has been 
observed  in patients receiving cediranib. Some events of gastrointestinal perforation 
have been fatal but  causality could n ot be unequivocally assigned to cediranib.  
 
Fatigue, hand and foot syndrome, diarrhea , headache, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and 
weight  loss are commonly occurring AEs in cediranib studies. Dehydration has been 
observed in  clinical studies as a consequence of cediranib -related or chemo therapy -
related diarrhea , vomiting, anorexia, or reduced oral intake.    
 
23 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 Hoarseness (dysphonia) has been reported as common and dose -related.  
 
Muscle weakness, proteinuria, dry mouth and oral mucosal inflammation have been 
observed  in cediranib studies.  
 
Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) has been observed in 
patients  receiving cediranib in clinical studies.   RPLS is a rare syndrome affecting 
vascular endothelial cells in the brain that may lead to capillary leak and edema. It has 
been  associated with a number of conditions, including renal failure, hypertension, 
fluid retention, and the use of cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs. RPLS also been 
reported in association with the use of VEGF inhibitors including bevacizumab, 
sunitinib, a nd sorafenib.  
 
Increases in transaminases, which are sometimes associated with increases in total 
bilirubin,  have been seen. Thrombocytopenia, of CTC Grade 1 or 2 in the majority of 
cases, has been seen with  monotherapy and combination cediranib treatment.  In 
addition, cediranib has been associated with increases in TSH  which may be 
associated with clinical hypothyroidism .  
 
A Phase II/II study of cediranib in combination with standard paclitaxel/carboplatin 
chemotherapy in patients with Stage IIIB or IV NS CLC was halted following a 
recommendation by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee prior to the Phase III 
portion.   There was a significantly higher  response rate seen in cediranib patients.19 
However, a lthough the overall number of deaths in each arm was similar, there  
appeared to be an imbalance in the number of fatal SAEs that were reported, with 
more  patients on cediranib having been reported as expe riencing fatal SAEs than on 
placebo (11  patients vs 1 patient). While some of these reported fatal SAEs appeared 
to be drug -related,  others appeared to be a  consequence of disease progression.  
 
Clinical Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacology, and Pharmacodynamics  
Cediranib has a PK profile that supports once -daily oral dosing.  Although absolute 
bioavailability has not been determined, cediranib appears well absorbed with 
apparently linear PK for single and multiple doses ranging from 0.5 to 60 mg. After 
multiple once -daily oral doses, steady -state plasma concentrations are attained after 
approximately 7 days. There is limited accumulation, consistent with the t ½λz observed 
following single doses, and steady -state plasma concentrations are predicted by the 
single  dose PK, indicating no time -dependent changes in PK.  
 
In vitro  protein binding studies showed that cediranib binds to human plasma proteins 
(95.4%), including serum albumin and α1 -acid glycoprotein, and was independent of 
concentration over the range 0.06 to 22 μM (30 to 1000 ng/mL)  
 
Cediranib showed minimal inhibitory effects on the activity of human P450 CYP2D6 
and CYP3A4 (testosterone and midazolam) in vitro ; the IC 50 values were far in excess 
of clinically relevant concentrations. Cediranib had no inhib itory effect on the activity 
24 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1.   Co-
administration of known inhibitors or inducers of hepatic CYP enzymes would not be 
expected to have significant effects on the clearance of cediranib. However, since 
potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP enzymes can also affect drug disposition by 
interaction with transporter proteins and phase II metabolism, two clinical studies are 
currently ongoing to investigate the PK of cediranib when co -administered with a 
potent inhibitor ketoconazole and the potent inducer rifampin.   
 
Clearance of cediranib is moderate, approximating 64% of nominal hepatic plasma flow. 
Following a single dose of 14C-labelled cediranib, the ratios of whole blood to plasma 
radioactivity suggest th at the radioactive components in whole blood are confined to plasma. 
Concentrations of total radioactive material in plasma were also higher than those measured 
for cediranib itself, particularly at later times, demonstrating the presence of circulating 
metabolites. In patients able to provide samples during the entire collection period, the  
majority of the radioactivity was eliminated in f eces.   The large number of metabolites 
detected in the feces  and urine show that cediranib is cleared extensively by me tabolism. 
Less than 1% of the administered dose of cediranib was excreted unchanged in the urine.  
 
Cediranib has been administered in combination with a number of chemotherapy 
regimens.  There was little or no apparent effect (<1.5 -fold change) on exposure  to 
paclitaxel, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, 5 -FU (given as  mFOLFOX6), docetaxel, 
pemetrexed, irinotecan +SN38, gefitin ib, gemcitabine or fulvestrant, when given in 
the presence of cediranib steady  state plasma concentrati ons. Steady -state PK 
parameters of ce diranib in combination with the chemotherapy agents are compar able 
with those seen previously with cediranib monotherapy.  
 
Data obtained following a single 45 -mg cediranib dose in the presence and absence of 
a standard high -fat meal, showed that food decre ases the C max by 33% and AUC by 
24%. Cediranib should be administered at least 1 h before or 2 h after food.  
 
Initial pharmacodynamic assessments indicated potential biological activity of 
cediranib in clinical  studies. Reductions in blood flow in hepatic metastases have 
been detected by DCE -MRI in patients with solid tumors  and metastatic liver disease, 
and initial biomarker assessments have shown increases in serum VEGF, bFGF, and 
PLGF and reductions in sVEGFR -2 levels. Decreases in sVEGFR -2 levels may be  a 
surrogate for decreased angiogenesis and changes in VEGF could potentially indicate 
acute vascular effects. The general trends for soluble biomarkers of angiogenesis 
(increases in serum VEGF and decreases in sVEGFR -2) were also observed in a 
Phase II study in patients  with renal cell ca rcinoma.  
 
Proposed Dose and Schedule for  Phase 2 Clinical Trials  
Based on the totality of the safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynamic 
data that  are currently available from both AZ -sponsored and collaborati ve group 
studies with  cediranib, at daily dose of cediranib 30 mg is the recommended dose for 
25 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 monotherapy. Cediranib 20 mg is the recommended dose in combination with 
chemotherapy agents.    
 
2.2.2.  Lenalidomide  
 
Lenalidomide is the lead compound in a new class o f immunomodulatory drugs known as the  
IMiDs ®. The IMiDs are characterized by a wide range of effects, including the enhancement 
of T cells and natural killer (NK) cell activity, the inhibition of angiogenesis, the inhibition of  
tumor cell proliferation, th e modulation of stem cell differentiation, and inhibition of  
inflammation and hyperalgesia. On the basis of this varied pharmacological profile,  
lenalidomide is under investigation as a treatment for a range of oncologic and non -oncologic  
indications.  
 
On 27 December 2005, the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
approved  lenalidomide for the treatment of patients with transfusion -dependent anemia due 
to low - or intermediate -1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) associated with a deletion 
5q cytogenetic  abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. 
Lenalidomide also received  approval for MDS from Argentina (on 15 February 2008) and 
conditional approval from Canada  (on 17 January 2008). Subsequently, the FDA (on 29 June 
2006) and the European Commission  (on 14 June 2007) approved lenalidomide in 
combination with dexamethasone for the treatment  of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) 
who received at least 1 prior therapy.  
 
Mechanism of Action  
Although lenalidomide shows immu nomodulatory activity both in vitro  and in vivo , its exact 
mechanism is  uncertain.   
 
Nonclinical Specificity and Efficacy Studies  
The pharmacologic activity of lenalidomide has been characterized in an extensive series of  
nonclinical studies. In several in vitro  assays, lenalidomide was shown to inhibit monocyte  
production of various proinflammatory cytokines; inhibit expression of cyclooxygenase -2 
(COX -2) and release of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2); and elevate interleukin (IL) -10 production. 
Both in vitro  and in vivo , lenalidomide increased the proliferation and production of IL -2 and 
interferon  gamma  (IFN -γ) by T cells and enhanced T cell and natural killer (NK) cell -
mediated killing of  tumors. The proliferation of various hematopoietic tumor cell lines was 
also inhibited by  lenalidomide in vitro . In vivo  tumor growth models have  demonstrated that 
lenalidomide inhibits growth of MM cells. In a model of hematopoietic progenitor 
differentiation, lenalidomide increased expression of fetal hemoglobin in CD34+ stem  cells. 
Lenalidomide also suppressed edema and mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in a model of 
inflammatory pain.  
 
The antiangiogenic activity of lenalidomide, demonstrated using  human endothelial cells and 
arterial explant models in vitro , has also been  shown to result in  reduced growth of solid 
tumors. As a single agent, lenalidomide has demonstrated some activity  toward a prostate 
tumor xenograft and had an additive effect in combination with docetaxel  (Investigator’s 
26 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 Brochure , Lenalidomide , 2008 ).  Lenalidomide, in combination with sorafenib, inhibited  
angiogenesis in vitro  and reduced tumor growth in an ocular melanoma xenograft model .20 
Lenalidomide, in combination with sunitinib and cyclophosphamide, also inhib ited 
angiogenesis in vitro  and effectively blocked tumor growth in ocular melanoma, colon 
cancer, pancreatic cancer, and cutaneous melanoma models .21  
 
Nonclinical Toxicology Studies  
Lenalidomide has been evaluated in rats, rabbits and monkeys  (Investigator’s Brochure, 
Lenalidomide , 2008 ). Lenalidomide has a low potential for acute toxicity; minimum lethal 
doses after oral administration were > 2000 mg/kg in rodents. Chronic administration of 
lenalidomide to rats  resulted in kidney pelvis mineralization, most notably in females. The no 
observed adverse  effect level (NOAEL) in rats is considered to be < 75 mg/kg.  
 
In monkeys, repeated oral  administration resulted in a dose -dependent decrease in neutrophil 
count, an ef fect that is related  to the pharmacodynamic effects of the drug. Repeated oral 
administration of 4 and 6 mg/kg to  monkeys for up to 52 weeks produced mortality and 
significant toxicity (marked weight loss,  reduced red and white blood cell and platelet coun ts, 
multiple organ hemorrhage, gastrointestinal  tract inflammation, lymphoid, and bone marrow 
atrophy). Monkeys dosed with 1 and 2  mg/kg/day exhibited changes in bone marrow 
cellularity, a slight decrease in the myeloid:  erythroid cell ratio, and thymic at rophy. Mild 
suppression of white blood cell count was  observed at 1 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL in monkeys 
was identified as 1 mg/kg/day.  
 
Studies in rats administered up to 500 mg/kg/day of lenalidomid e indicate it has no effects on 
male or female reproductive p erformance or fertility or prenatal and postnatal reproductive  
toxicity. Lenalidomide is not genotoxic.   
 
An embryofetal  development study was conducted in monkeys administered lenalidomide at 
doses up to 4 mg/kg/day.  Findings from this ongoing study indic ate that lenalidomide 
produced malformations in the  offspring of female monkeys who received the drug during 
pregnancy.   
 
In rats, lenalidomide was not teratogenic at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day. In rabbits 
administered  3, 10, and 20 mg/kg/day orally, develo pmental toxicity at the 10 and 20 
mg/kg/day dose levels  was characterized by slightly reduced fetal body weights, increased 
incidences of  postimplantation loss (early and late resorptions and intrauterine deaths), and 
gross external  findings  in the fetuses  associated with morbidity and pharmacotoxic effects of 
lenalidomide  (purple discoloration of the skin on the entire body). In rabbits, the maternal 
and developmental  NOAELs for lenalidomide were 3 mg/kg/day.  
 
Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacology  
Pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide was evaluated in male beagle dogs, male cynomolgus  
monkeys, and male Sprague -Dawley rats  (Investigator’s Brochure, Lenalidomide, 2008) .  
Following oral administration, lenalidomide was absorbed rapidly, with t max achieved a t 0.5, 
1.3, and 1.5 hours postdose in rats, dogs, and monkeys, respectively.  High plasma 
27

 concentrations were achieved, with good oral bioavailability in all the species examined (≥ 
50%).  
 
Protein binding was low in all species,  including humans (19% to 29%). Lenalidomide is not 
a substrate of  human cytochrome P450 enzymes .  Lenalidomide was  excreted largely as 
unchanged drug (approximately 55% of the dose) in both rats and monkeys.  Hydrolysis of 
the glutarimide ring of lenalidomide was another important clearance mechanism in  animal 
models. In both rats and monkeys, the major route of elimination of radioacti vity following 
intravenous (IV) administration was renal. Excretion of radioactivity following oral  
administration to rats and monkeys was also similar; radioactivity was eliminated in almost 
equal  proportions in the urine and feces for both species.  
 
Clinical Experience  
Phase I Experience .   
Several Phase I studies in healthy volunteers have investigated the single -dose safety, 
tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide.   Lenalidomide had an acceptable safety 
profile in healthy male subjects at dos es of 5 to 400  mg.  The most frequently report ed 
adverse events were rhinitis, headache, pruritus, rash, and cough.  Analysis of CD4 blood 
counts showed a significant decrease from baseline CD4 levels at 24 hours postdose for the 
5-, 200 -, and 400 -mg lenal idomide dose levels, each administered in the fasted state, with the 
greatest decrease being observed at the 200 -mg dose level.  
 
Two phase I/II, single -center, open -label, and dose -escalation studies were performed  to 
determine the MTD and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of  lenalidomide  in subjects with 
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM).  In the Phase I portion, subjects received 
lenalidomide at a dose of 5, 10, 25, or 50 mg/day for the first 28 days under fasting 
conditions. Subjects who tol erated the therapy were allowed to continue on treatment after 
Day 28 until disease progression occurred.   The MTD of lenalidomide  was determined to be 
25 mg/day.  
 
The safety of lenalidomide in patients with solid tumors refractory to conventional treatme nt 
has been evaluated  in several Phase I studies . Tumor types have included metastatic 
melanoma, pancreatic cancer, NSCLC, lymphoma, and high grade gliomas.   The majority 
(85.6%) of subjects in the pooled Phase I studies received doses between 25 -150 mg.  The 
most frequently reported adverse events in patients who received these doses  were fatigue, 
nausea, and constipation. Other clinically  relevant events occurring in fewer than 2 0% of 
subjects  who received lenalidomide at any dose  included  anemia, thromb ocytopenia, DVT, 
thrombosis and thrombophlebitis.   
 
Lenalidomide has also been evaluated in a Phase I study in combination with docetaxel in 
patients with advanced solid tumors.  Diarrhea, fatigue, and nausea were the most frequently 
reported adverse even ts.  Other clinically relevant events occurring in fewer tha n 20% of 
subjects included DVT, febrile neutropenia, and jugular vein thrombosis .  The recommended 
Phase II dosing was doxetaxel 75 mg/m2 on Day 1, lenalidomide 25 mg on days 1 -14, and 
pegfilgrast im 6 mg on day 2, given every three weeks.22

Phase II and III Experience  
The safety and efficacy of lenalidomide has been explored in a number of oncologic 
indications.  
 
Thirteen studies of lenalidomide in the treatment of MM h ave been undertaken to evaluate 
lenalidomide as monotherapy, in combination with high -dose dexamethas one therapy, and as  
part of a lenalidomide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and dexamethasone (DVd) regimen. As a 
result,  lenalidomide has been shown to be an effective treatment for MM with a favorable 
safety profile,  and has been approved by a number of regula tory agencies for use in 
combination with  dexamethasone for the treatment of MM in patients who have had at least 1 
prior therapy.  Cytopenias are the primary adverse events associated with the administration 
of lenalidomide,  particularly in subjects with c ompromised bone marrow. These, however, 
are manageable with  dose interruptions and reductions.  
 
Three multicenter, single -arm, open -label studies of lenalidomide in subjects with red blood 
cell transfusion -dependent anemia and Low - or Intermediate -1-risk M DS are ongoing: one 
phase I/II study in subjects with or without a del 5 (q31 -33) cytogenic abnormality, one phase 
2 study in  subjects without a del 5 (q31 -33), and one phase 2 study in subjects with a del 5 
(q31-33). In the  del 5 (q31 -33) population, hema tological improvement, manifested clinically 
as transfusion  independence, is supported objectively by sustained elevations and 
improvements in hemoglobin  values, cytogenetic responses, and bone marrow. More 
recently, a phase III, multicenter,  randomized, d ouble -blind, placebo -controlled study of the 
efficacy and safety of 2 doses of  lenalidomide versus placebo has been initiated in red blood 
cell (RBC) transfusion —dependent  subjects with Low - or Intermediate -1-risk MDS 
associated with a del 5 (q31 -33). 
 
Several studies of lenalidomide in the treatment of solid tumors have been completed, and 
data for others are currently being analyzed.  
 
Lenalidomide has been evaluated in a Phase II study of patients with progressive, iodine -
resistant thyroid cancer.10  Some 25 patients received lenalidomide 25 mg daily.  Of 18 
evaluable patients, 22% had a partial response and 44% had stable disease.  Main toxicities 
were hematological and responded to dose reduction.  The mean da ily dosage was 20 mg.   
 
A phase II open -label study to evaluated  the safety and efficacy of lenalidomide in subjects 
with androgen independent prostate cancer. These subjects had increasing serum prostate -
specific antigen (PSA) levels but did not have det ectable metastatic disease. The study was 
terminated for lack of efficacy. Two Phase I/II studies of lenalidomide in patients with  
advanced ovarian and primary peritoneal carcinoma were terminated prematurely.  The first 
was to evaluate lenalidomide in com bination with liposomal doxorubicin.  A Grade 1 adverse 
event of left  ventricular systolic dysfunction was reported in Subject 1. The event was 
suspected as study  drug related and resulted in study discontinuation  prior to establishing the 
MTD .  A second s tudy intended to determine the MTD of oral lenalidomide given on Days 1 
to 14 and topotecan given on Days 1 to 5 every 21 days as combination therapy for subjects 
29

 with advanced ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma. The study was prematurely 
terminated d ue to toxicity. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia  and anemia were the most 
commonly experienced treatment –related adverse events. One subject experienced a 
pulmonary embolism considered to be related to study drug.  
 
Lenalidomide has been evaluated in a Phase  II/III  and Phase III trial in patients with  
refractory  metastatic melanoma.  A phase II/III, controlled, randomized, parallel -group study 
compare d the efficacy and safety of 2 dose regimens  (5 mg daily for 28 days or 25 mg daily 
for 21 days, followed by a  7-day rest).  No significant differences in res ponse rates were 
observed between the two doses.  A phase III, multicenter, controlled, randomized, placebo -
controlled, parallel  group  study  evaluated  the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide in subjects 
with previously treated  metastatic malignant melanoma. Subjects were randomized to receive 
either 25 mg/day of  lenalidomide or placebo for 21 days of a 28 -day cycle. There were n o 
significant differences between lenalidomide and placebo in overall survival, tim e to 
progression, or RECIST  criteria .    In contrast with those seen in the MDS studies, the  
incidences of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were low (≤ 8% and ≤ 3%, respectively) 
among  subjects treated with lenalidomide in these melanoma studies.  
 
Safety Profile  
Data on the safety of lenalidomide had developed from over 6000 subjects from clinical trials 
(Investigator’s Brochure, Lenalidomide, 2008) .  
 
Lenalidomide is associated with anemia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia,  
and pancytope nia. Grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are the most common, dose  
limiting  adverse events associated with the administration of lenalidomide.   The adverse 
event profile of lenalidomide, particularly with regard to cytopenias, is milder in patients 
with MM, malignant melanoma, solid tumors or gliomas, CRPS, or Crohn’s disease than that 
in patients with MDS, likely reflecting the underlying bone marrow disease of the MDS 
patients.  
 
Lenalidomide, in combination with dexamethasone, has be en associated w ith an increased 
incidence in thrombotic or thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT),  
pulmonary embolism, thrombosis, and thromboembolism, particularly among MM patients  
receiving concomitant therapy with an erythropoietic agent. DVT has  been reported with 
both indications but is more frequent in MM than in MDS.  
 
Constipation, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting were the most commonly reported  
gastrointestinal adverse events during treatment with lenalidomide. Occasional treatment -
emergent ad verse events like atrial fibrillat ion, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart 
failure have been reported with the use of lenalidomide from clinical studies.  Treatment -
emergent adverse events of infections specifically pneumonia are commonly seen with 
lenalidomide.   The rare treatment -emergent adverse event of rhabdomyolysis has been 
observed with lenalidomide.  
 
30 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 Rare treatment -emergent adverse events of angioedema and serious dermatologic reactions 
including Stevens -Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported with 
lenalidomide during commercial use. These events have the potential to be fatal. Permanent 
discontinuation o f lenalidomide should be considered if skin rash ≥Grade 2 is exfoliative or 
bullous or if Stevens -Johnson syndrom e or toxic epidermal necrolysis is suspected.  
 
Considering an unclear, temporal relationship of angioedema to lenalidomide, clinicians 
should  exercise caution when prescribing lenalidomide for pat ients who have had a history of 
hypersensitivity adverse reactions, specifically to thalidomide. Clearly, once angioedema has  
been identified, the risks and benefits of lenalidomide therapy should be con sidered.  Review 
of current postmarketing data, which consists of thousands of patient exposure, did not  
identify any additional significant safety signal.  
 
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomi de is a known human 
teratogenic active  substance that causes severe life -threatening birth defects. If  lenalidomide 
is taken during pregnancy, a teratogenic effect of lenalidomide in humans cannot  be ruled 
out. 
 
Clinical Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacology, and Pharmacodynamics  
The clinical pharmac ology experience with lenalidomide includes 9 completed studies (8 in  
healthy subjects and 1 in subjects with renal impairment); 2 ongoing studies in healthy 
subjects;  and 3 completed pharmacokinetic reports (2 in subjects with  MM and 1 in subject 
with MDS ). 
 
Single doses of lenalidomide over the dose range of 5 to 400 mg and multiple doses of 200 
mg/day (administered as 100 mg twice daily) had a favorable safety profile in healthy 
subjects. No clinically significant changes in ECGs, blood pressure, or puls e rate were 
observed.  
 
In healthy subjects, lenalidomide was rapidly absorbed following single - and multiple -dose 
oral administration, with the maximum concentration (C max) occurring between 0.5 and 1.5 
hours  postdose. The C max and area under the concentra tion-time curve (AUC) values 
increased  proportionally from 5 to 400 mg/day in single -dose studies. Steady -state levels 
were observed  within 4 days of multiple dosing. There was no accumulation of drug with 
multiple dosing. Coadministration  with food delaye d absorption somewhat, but did not alter 
the extent of absorption.  
 
Approximately, 65% to 85% of lenalidomide was eliminated unchanged through urinary  
excretion. The mean renal clearance of lenalidomide was approximately 180 to 220 mL/min  
across all doses,  which exceeded the glomerular filtration rate, and therefore is at least 
partially  active. The mean total clearance of lenalidomide was approximately 300 mL/min, 
and it was  independent of time and dose. The mean half -life of elimination (t 1/2) was 
approxi mately 3 to  4 hours on all study days at the clinically relevant doses (5 to 50 mg/day).  
 
31 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 Following a single 25 -mg dose of of [ 14C]-lenalidomide as an oral suspension, total recovery 
of urinary radioactivity indicated that approximately 90% of the administ ered dose was 
absorbed  systemically. The mean AUC ∞ ratio of unchanged lenalidomide to the radioactivity 
in plasma  was about 92%, suggesting that the parent compound was the primary radioactive 
component  circulating in plasma. The total recovery of the radi oactivity over 10 days 
averaged  approximately 94% of the administered dose, with approximately 90% in urine, 4% 
in feces, and  0.006% in semen. Two identified metabolites are hydroxy -lenalidomide 
(pharmacological  activity unknown) and N -acetyl -lenalidomide (CC-15656; 
pharmacologically inactive), with  either being less than 5% of the parent in plasma and urine.  
 
No pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed between lenalidomide 
and warfarin; therefore, lenalidomide and warfarin may be co -administered. The effects of  
lenalidomide on digoxin pharmacokinetics (if any) are small, but a drug interaction cannot be  
excluded based on the available data.  
 
Proposed Dose and Schedule for  Phase 2 Clinical Trials  
 
Lenalidomide doses between 5 mg and 25 m g per day have  commonly  been used in 
clinical trials.  Because the optimal dose of lenalidomide when given in combination 
with cediranib is unknown, we will perform a Phase I escalation study.  Because 
lenalidomide 20 mg daily was the mean tolerated dose i n the Phase II study of single 
agent lenalidomide in thyroid cancer,10 we will start our dose escalation of 
lenalidomide at 15 mg on 21 days of a 28 day cycle and designate 20 mg daily as the 
maximal possible do se.   
 
2.3. Rationale  
 
Patients with DTC have few therapeutic options once surgery and RAI have proven 
ineffective. There are currently no widely accepted standards of care for patients in 
this setting.  Doxorubicin is approved for patients with iodine -refracto ry thyroid 
cancer, but response rates are poor and short -lived.  There is now mounting clinical 
data that inhibition of VEGF stimulated angiogenesis has anti -cancer activity.  
Although cediranib has not been evaluated in thyroid cancer, clinical trials wit h other 
VEGFR inhibitors have shown promising results.  Likewise, clinical trials with 
thalidomide and its derivative lenalidomide also show anti -cancer activity.  The 
rationale for combination therapy is to simultaneously target different aberrant 
pathway s implicated in thyroid cancer.  We hypothesize that this will limit resistance 
as seen in single agent therapy and improve response rates.  
 
2.4. Correlative Studies Background   
 
2.4.1.  MAPK pathway   
 
RET/PTC  rearrangements and B-RAF mutations are the most commonly r eported 
molecular aberrations reported in papillary thyroid cancer.  B-RAF mutations have 
32 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 been associated with more aggressive iodine -resistant cancers.  Additionally, RAS 
mutations have commonly been document in follicular thyroid cancers.  When 
available , patients enrolled in the phase II study will have archival tumor tissue 
analyzed for B-RAF and K-RAS mutations.  Testing for these mutations will be done 
at the University of Chicago.  
 
2.4.2.  Plasma  
 
TSH and thyroglobulin measurements will be performed at the r espective institution 
of the enrollee. TSH can stimulate thyroid cancer growth.  Par ticipants will have TSH 
measured pretherapy and every 8 weeks to assess for adequate TSH suppression.  
Thyroglobulin serves as a tumor marker in thyroid cancer.  It is not always reliable 
because some patients have anti -thyroglobulin antibodies that falsely alter the 
thyroglobulin measurement and because some advance cancers lose the ability to 
make thyroglobulin effectively.  However, in patients with cancers that make 
thyroglobulin, this protein can serve as a useful surrogate of targeted agent activity.  
Patients who do not have anti -thyroglobulin antibodies will have thyroglobulin 
measurements pretherapy and at 8 week intervals.

3.2.10.  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness includi ng, but not 
limited to, ongoing or active infections or psychiatric illness/social situations that 
would limit compliance with study requirements are ineligible.  
 
3.2.11.  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because cediranib and 
lenalidomide are agents wi th the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.  
Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants 
secondary to treatment of the mother with cediranib or lenalidomide, breastfeeding 
should be discontinued if th e mother is treated with cediranib with or without  
lenalidomide.  
 
3.2.12.  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are 
ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with cediranib or 
cediranib with lenalidomide.  In additi on, these patients are at increased risk of lethal 
infections when treated with marrow -suppressive therapy.  Appropriate studies will 
be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when 
indicated.  
 
3.3. Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
 
Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this 
trial.  Below is an estimate of expected accrual targets for this trial.

Cancer Research Center website.    
 
• http://uccrc.uchicago.edu/current/home.html  
• Click on the Staff Resources  link and scroll down to “UC Phase II Consortium 
Forms” section.  
 
Except in very unusual circumstances, each participating institution will order 
DCTD-supplied agents directly from CTEP.  Agents may be ordered by a 
participating site only after the initial IRB approval for the site has been forwarded by 
the Coordinating Center to the CTEP PIO ( PIO@ctep.nci.n ih.gov ) except for Group 
studies. Eligible patients will be entered on study centrally at the University of 
Chicago by the Registrar.  All sites should call the Registrar at (773) 834 -3095 to 
verify agent availability.   
 
Following registration, patients should begin protocol treatment within 14 days.  
Issues that would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal 
Investigator.  If a patient does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the 
patient’s registration on the study m ay be canceled.  The Registrar should be notified 
of cancellations as soon as possible.  
 
4.2. Registration Process  
 
All patients must be registered with the University of Chicago Registrar  at least 48 
hours prior to the commencement of  treatment.  The following documents should be 
completed by the research nurse or data manager and faxed (773) 702 -4889 or 
emailed PhaseIICRA@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu  to the Registrar:  
 
• Provider of information  
• Treating Physician  
• Patient name and hospital ID number  
• Patient's zip cod e of residence  
• Date & copy of signed informed consent  
• Race, gender, date of birth of patient

Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 • Assign a patient study number  
• Register the patient on the study  
• Fax or e -mail the patient study number and dose to the participating site  
 
Call the research nurse or data manager at the participating site and verbally confirm 
registration.  
 
Each site must have two trained counselors available for counseling all patients 
receiving lenalidomide supplied by the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis.  
Trained  counselors must complete training using the online program provided free by 
Celgene, the Lenalidomide Counseling Program (LCP).   Registration for LCP is done by 
completing the form f ound in Appendix K  and following the directions provided in the 
email not ification. After the training is complete, the counselors must generate a training 
certifi cate and provide it to the PMB for documentation. Sites may not order 
lenalidomide until documentation for two trained counselors is provided to the 
appropriate offic e. 
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1. Agent Administration  
 
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient  basis. Cediranib tablets should be taken 
either 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals.   Cediranib will be taken daily on a continuous 
basis  for each 28 day cycle .  If a dose of cediranib is missed, it should be taken as soon as 
possible on the same day.  If it is missed for the entire day, it should not be made up.  
Lenalidomide will either be taken for 21 days of the 28 day cycle or daily, depending on the 
level of dos e escalation .  Lenalidomide can be taken with or without food.  Lenalidomide 
capsules should be swallowed whole, and should not be broken, chewed or opened.   If a 
dose of lenalidomide is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day.  If it 
is missed for the entire day, it should not be made up.    Patients who take more than the 
prescribed dose of lenalidomide should be instructed to seek emergency medical care if 
needed and contact study staff immediately.   
 
Lenalidomide capsules should be swallowed whole.  For patients who are unable to swallow 
lenalidomide whole, lenalidomide can be administered via gastrostomy feeding tube  
following the instructions in Appendix M.    
 
For  patients who are unable to swallow cediranib tablets, cediranib tablets may be 
administered as a dispersion in water (ie, either drinking water, sterile water [for injection] or 
purified water).  The following procedure is recommended:  
 
Cediranib tablets may be dispersed in half a glass (2 fluid ounces or 50 ml) of non -
carbonated drinking water. No other liquids should be used. The tablet is dropped in water, 
without crushing, stirred until dispersed (approximately 10 minutes) and the resultant 
dispersion swallowed immediately. Any residues in the glass are mixed with h alf a glass of 
39 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 water and swallowed. The liquid can also be administered through nasogastric or 
gastrostomy tubes. Where patients require the dose to be administered by nasogastric or 
gastrostomy tubes,  cediranib tablet(s) dispersed in water can be dosed wi th: Polyurethane 
(PUR) or Poly vinylchloride (PVC) naso -gastric, naso -intestinal or  percutaneous endoscopic 
gastrostomy (PEG) feeding systems in conjunction with  PUR syringes.  PVC syringes are not 
recommended for use.  Two system washes are conducted throug h the giving set to ensure the 
correct dose is obtained.  
 
Only one cycle of therapy may be dispensed to the patient each month . 
 
 
Reported adverse events and potential risks for cediranib and lenalidomide are 
described in Section  7.  Appropriate dose modif ications for cediranib and 
lenalidomide are described in Section 6.  No investigational or commercial agents or 
therapies other than those described below may be administered with the intent to 
treat the patient's malignancy.    
 
All patients on lenalidomid e should receive prophylactic anti -coagulation.  See 5.1.3 
Anticoagulation Consideration.

 5.1.1.  Phase I  
 
To determine the MTD, a 3+3 design will be used (see below).  Dose modifications 
are listed below.  Three patients will be enrolled with a starting dose of  cediranib 20 
mg daily  (28 days of 28 day cycle)  with lenalidomide 15 mg on day 1 -21 of the 28 
day cycle.   If cediranib 20 mg daily  is not tolerated with lenalidomide  15 mg on day 
1-21 of a 28 day cycle , a new cohort will be added with  cediranib 20 mg daily (28 
days of 28 day cycle)  and lenalidomide 10 mg  on day 1 -21 of 28 day cycle.  After 4 
weeks of therapy, i f no DLT s are observed, 3 patients will be enrolled at the next 
dose, cediranib 30 mg daily  (28 days of 28 day cycle) with lenalidomide 15 mg on 
day 1-21 of 28 day cycle . If no DLTs are observed after 4 weeks, 3 addition patients 
will be enrolled with cediranib 30 mg daily  (28 days of 28 day cycle)   and 
lenalidomide 15 mg daily  (28 days of 28 day cycle ). After 4 weeks of therapy, if no 
DLTs are obser ved, 3 patients will be enrolled at the next dose, cediranib 30 mg daily  
(28 days of 28 day cycle) with lenalidomide 20 mg on day 1 -21 of  the 28 days cycle . 
After 4 weeks, if no DLTs are observed, 3 patients will be enrolled at the next dose, 
cediranib 30 mg daily  (28 days of 28 day cycle)  with lenalidomide 20  mg daily (28 
days of 28 day cycle ).  Dose escalation beyond cediranib 30 mg daily and 
lenalidomide 20 mg daily will not be performed.  At any level, if more than 2 patients 
experience a DLT, this dose  will declared the maximally administered dose.  Three 
additional patients will be entered at the next lowest dose level if only 3 patients were 
treated previously at that dose.  If 1 out of 3 patients develop a DLT at a certain dose, 
3 additional subjects  will be entered at this dose.  If 0 of 3 patients develop a DLT, an 
additional 3 patients will proceed to the next dose.  If 1 of 3 patients develops a DLT, 
dose escalation will stop.  Three additional patients will be entered at the next lowest 
dose leve l if only 3 patients were treated previously at that dose.

Number of Patients with 
DLT at a Given Dose Level  Escalation Decision Rule  
 
0 out of 3   
Enter 3 patients at the next dose level  
 
> 2  
Dose escalation will be stopped.   This dose level will be declared the 
maximally administered d ose (highest dose administered).   Three (3) additional 
patients will be entered at the next lowest dose level if only 3 patients were 
treated previously at that dose.  
 
1 out of 3   
Enter at least 3 more patients at this dose level.  
If 0 of these 3 patients  experience DLT, proceed to the next dose level.  
If 1 or more of this group suffer DLT, then dose escalation is stopped, and this 
dose is declared the maximally administered dose.   Three (3) additional patients 
will be entered at the next lowest dose level  if only 3 patients were treated 
previously at that dose.  
 
≤1 out of 6 at highest dose 
level below the maximally 
administered dose   
This is generally the recommended phase 2 dose.   At least 6 patients must be 
entered at the recommended phase 2 dose.  
 
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) will be determined during the firs t cycle for dose 
escalation.  Toxicity occurring in subsequent cycles will not be consid ered dose 
limiting but will require dose modification.  (See Section  6.0 for Dose Modification ) 
 
DLT  will be defined as follows:  
 
• Hematological toxicities:  
o Any grade 4 neutropenia (ANC < 500) lasting more than 5 days  
o Any grade 4 neutropenia with concomitant fever (temperature > 38.5)  
o Any grade 4 neutropenia and sepsis or other severe infection  
o Any grade 4 thrombocytopenia  
 
• Any other grade 3 -4 non -hematological adverse dr ug reactions, except untreated 
nausea/vomiting, or hypersensitivity reactions.  
 
• Grade 4 hypertension  
 
• Grade 4 proteinuria  
 
• Delay in the administration of a subsequent dose of cediranib and lenalidomide 
exceeding 2 weeks, due to an adverse drug reaction.  
 
For patients in the Phase I trial, disease re -evaluation will occur every 8 weeks using 
42 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 RECIST guideline s.* Patients without evidence of anti -thyroglobulin antibodies will 
continue to have thyroglobulin levels measured at each response assessment (usually 
every 8 weeks). All patients are expected to be on thyroxine suppression therapy and 
thyroid stimulation hormone (TSH) levels will be monitored pre -therapy and every 8 
weeks during therapy.  
 
*After 1 8 cycles, radiologic disease re -evaluation will occur  every 16 weeks.  
 
Phase I toxicity:  In the Phase I study,  of 15 evaluable patients,  4 were enrolled at 
the starting dose (cediranib 20 mg daily with lenalidomide 15 mg on days1 - 21 of 28 
days), 6 were enrolled in the +1 dose modification, 5 in the + 2 dose m odification.  
DLTs in the +2 dose modification were Grade 3 fatigue and Grade 3 mucocitis.   The 
DLT in the +1 modification was Grade 3 fatigue.  Since 1 of 6 patients in the +1 
group (cediranib 30 mg daily and lenalidomide 15 mg on day 1 -21,) this was 
determined to be the starting dose for the Phase II trial.    
 
5.1.2.  Cediranib and lenalidomide administration  
 
Please note, as of April 10, 2015 , patients assigned to Arm B (Combination of 
cediranib and lenalidomide) are to discontinue lenalidomide and may continue  on 
cediranib alone.   
 
After determining the MTD or reaching t he maximum dose specified above of 
cediranib with lenalidomide in the Phase I portion of this study, the Phase II study 
will be initiated.   
 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:2 ratio to one of  two arms. Randomized stratification 
will employ prior therapy with a VEGF -pathway inhibitor (yes vs. no) and performance 
status (0 and 1 vs. 2).  In Cohort A, subjects  (n = 36) will receive cediranib alone at 30 
mg daily.  In Cohort B, subjects  (n = 74) will receive cediranib and lenalidomide at the  
dose determined in the Phase I study.  Each cycle will be 4 weeks in length.  Disease re -
evaluation will occur every 8 weeks using RECIST guidelines .  After 18 cycles, disease 
re-evaluation will occur every 16 weeks.   Patients without evidence of anti -thyroglobulin 
antibodies will continue to have thyroglobulin levels measured at each response 
assessment (usually every 8 weeks). All patients are expected to be on thyroxine 
suppression therapy and thyroid stimula tion hormone (TSH) levels will be monitored 
pre-therapy and every 8 weeks during therapy.  
 
• Patients will take cediranib or cediranib and  lenalidomide .  Cediranib will be 
taken daily  at 30 mg .  Lenalidomide will be taken on day 1 -21 of the 28 day cycle  
at 15 mg .   Proper administration of cediranib and lenalidomide is described in 
Section 5.1.  A 4-week period constitutes one cycle of treatment.  
 
• Patients will be provided with a Medication Diary for cediranib and lenalidomide 
(Appendix B), instructed in its use, and asked to bring the diary with them to each 
43 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 appointment.  A new copy of the Medication Diary will be given to patients each 
cycle and for those whose dose is reduced due to adverse events.  
 
• Because hypertension is a known and potentially serious bu t rare adverse event 
associated with cediranib treatment, patients will have their blood pressure 
monitored and recorded at least weekly during the first cycle of therapy  and then 
at least every two weeks for the duration of the study , either at the doctor ’s office 
or using any calibrated electronic device (such as those found at a local drug store 
or pharmacy).  The health care team may request for more frequent blood pressure 
checks  as clinically indicated .  Patients will be provided a Blood Pressure Diar y 
(Appendix L) to record blood pressure.  Patients should be asked to bring the 
diary with them to each appointment.  (See Section 6.1 for hypertension 
management and dose reduction guidelines.)   
 
• Routine monitoring for cardiac function (ECHO/MUGA) should be performed at 
baseline and every other cycle of treatment in the following groups of patients:  
(1) those entering the trial with NYHA Class II cardiac dysfunction (see 
Appendix G), (2) those with a history of Class II heart failure who are 
asymptomatic on treatment, and (3) in those previously exposed to anthracyclines 
or thoracic irradiation if the heart was included in the radiotherapy port.  Routine 
cardiac monitoring is not required in patients with no known cardiac dysfunction 
at entry or in the abs ence of clinically observed adverse cardiac events.  
 
• Patients with bulky solid tumors should be monitored closely for pneumothorax, 
intestinal fistulae, or intestinal perforation in the event of rapid tumor destruction.  
 
• Subjects who have been on protocol for 12 months or more can be  evaluated 
every 2 cycles ( 8 weeks) .  (However, only one cycle of therapy may be 
dispensed to the patient each month)  
 
  
• Subjects who have been on protocol for 18 months or more will have r adiographic  
tumor response assessed  every 4 cycles  (16 weeks) .   
 
5.1.3.  Anticoagulation Consideration  
 
Lenalidomide increases the risk of thrombotic events in patients who are at high risk or with 
a history a thrombosis, in particular when combined with other drugs known to cause 
thrombosis. When len alidomide is combined with other agents such as steroids (e.g. 
dexamethasone, prednisone), anthracyclines (Doxil, Adriamycin) and erythropoietin the risk 
of thrombosis is increased.  
 
• All patients receiving lenalidomide should receive prophylactic anti -coagulation.  
Aspirin (81 or 325 mg) is the recommended agent for anti -coagulation prophylaxis.  
44 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 Low molecular weight heparin may be utilized in patients that are intolerant to ASA. 
Coumadin should be used with caution and close monitoring of INR.  
 
• Prophylact ic anti -coagulation should be held for platelet counts < 50,000 /mm³and then 
restarted when platelet counts are above this level.  
 
• Full therapeutic anti -coagulation should be considered for patients who have a history of 
venous thromboembolism.  Whether th erapeutic anti -coagulation is used or not, patients 
with a history of venous thromboembolism should be closely monitored throughout the 
study, especially during periods of fluctuating platelet counts.  
   
5.2. General  Concomitant Medication and  Supportive Care G uidelines  
 
The case report form (CRF) must capture the concurrent use of all other drugs, over -
the-counter medications, or alternative therapies including herbal supplements, 
specifically, St. John’s wort.   
 
45 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 5.2.1.  Concomitant Medications  
 
The use of coumarin -derivative anticoagulants  such as warfarin (Coumadin®) is not 
recommended .  It may be used for both thrombosis prophylaxis and treatment.  However, 
coumadin should be used with caution and close monitoring of INR.  When possible, low 
molecular weight hepari n should be used instead of coumadin.  
 
5.2.2.  Supportive Care  
 
• Nausea/vomiting   Patients with treatment -related nausea should be treated 
initially with a phenothiazine (prochlorperazine – 10 mg every 8 hours orally as 
needed or promethazine – 12.5-25 mg IV every 6 hours as needed).  If this is 
inadequate, a benzodiazepine should be added until acute nausea is controlled or 
toxicity is limiting.  Should this prove inadequate acutely, a steroid may be 
added ( e.g., dexamethasone 4 mg every 6 hours as needed).  (Sterio d use must be 
limited to 5 consecutive days within a 4 week cycle.)  
 
After acute nausea has resolved, consideration should be given to initiation of 
prophylactic antiemetic therapy.  If nausea recurs despite reasonable medical 
intervention (as outlined abo ve), dose reduction will be needed as described in 
Section 6.  
 
• Diarrhea  should be managed with loperamide:  4 mg at first onset, then 2 mg 
every 2 -4 hours until diarrhea is controlled (maximum = 16 mg loperamide per 
day).  
 
• Hand -foot syndrome may be treate d with topical emollients (such as 
Aquaphor), topical/systemic steroids, and/or antihistamine agents.  Vitamin B6 
(pyridoxine; 50 -150 mg orally each day) may also be used.  
 
• Patients with neutropenic fever  or infection should be evaluated promptly and 
treated with IV antibiotic therapy plus/minus  therapeutic colony -stimulating 
factors as appropriate following the ASCO guidelines .24 Packed red blood cell 
and platelet transfusion should be administered as clinically ind icated. GCSF  
may be used at the discretion of the treating physician.  
 
5.3. Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue 
until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
• Disease progression,  
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
 
46 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 • Unacceptable adverse events(s),  
 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or  
 
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the  judgment of the investigator.  
 
5.4. Duration of Follow Up  
 
Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until 
resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.  Unless the patient withdraws from the 
study, the subject will be fo llowed un til disease progression or death, w hichever 
comes first.  
 
5.5. Criteria for Removal from Study  
 
Patients will be removed from study when any of the criteria listed in Section 5.3 
applies.  The reason for study removal and the date the patient was remov ed will be  
documented in the Case Report Form.  
 
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
The dose levels and the general approach to dose modification of cediranib and lenalidomide 
on this trial are shown below.  Managing patients on combination therapy will be d iscussed 
below.  Adverse events (AEs) should be treated with the appropriate maximum supportive 
care, and dose reductions should be clearly documented in the case report form (CRF).   
 
The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be 
utilized for AE reporting.

6.1. Management of Treatment -Emergent Hypertension  
 
Hypertension is more frequently associated with cediranib than lenalidomide.  Increases in 
blood pressure  (BP) and cases of hypertension have been associated with many drugs acting 
on the VEGF pathway.  The proposed mechanism for this increase is through inhibition of 
VEGF -induced peripheral vasodilation.  Specific guidelines for management of this adverse 
event and a table of various antihypertensive medications are provided in Appendix C.  In 
addition, guidance on the collection and recording of BP information is provided in 
Appendix D.

• While patients are receiving t reatment with cediranib, the early initiation of 
antihypertensive treatment for grade 1 or 2 hypertension to minimize more 
severe or persistent hypertension is not considered a grade 3 adverse event.  
 
• Decisions to hold or decrease the cediranib dose during  treatment must be 
based on BP readings taken in the clinic by a medical professional.  
 
6.2. Other Hematologic and Non -Hematologic Adverse Events  
 
In the setting of combination therapy, it may be difficult to identify the agent causing 
the adverse event. When t he adverse event could be due to either agent, the dose of 
lenalidomide should be decreased.   When an adverse event is more commonly 
associated with a particular agent, that drug will be decreased.

7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a rout ine part of every clinical trial.  
The following list of AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE 
(Section 7.2) will determine whether the event requires expedited (via  CTEP -AERS ) 
reporting in addition  to routine (via CDUS) reporting .   
 
7.1. Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks List s (CAEPRs)  
 
 
 
7.1.1.  CAEPR for Cediranib  (AZD2171, NSC 732208)  
 
The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of reported and/or 
potential adverse events (AE) associa ted with an agent using a uniform presentation of events by body 
system. In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset, the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited 
Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and is identified with bold and italiciz ed text. This subset of 
AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI (except as 
noted below).  Refer to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf   for further 
clarification. Frequency is provided based on 1608 patients. Below is the CAEPR f or Cediranib (AZD2171).  
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in parentheses next to the AE 
in the SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple investigational agents and 
has an AE listed on different S PEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is

7.1.2.  CAEPR for Lenalidomide  (CC-5013, NSC 703813)  
 
Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR)  
for 
Lenalidomide (CC -5013, NSC 703813)  
The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of reported and/or potential 
adverse events (AE)  associated with an agent using a uniform presentation of events by body system. In addition to the 
comprehensive list, a subset, the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate 
column and is identified with bold and italicized text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are protocol 
specific exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI (except as noted below).  Refer to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse 
Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf   for further clarification. 
Frequency is provided based on 4081 patients. Below is the  CAEPR for Lenalidomide (CC -5013).  
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in parentheses next to the AE in the 
SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple investigational agents and has an AE listed 
on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is required.

Your name, the name of the inves tigator, the protocol and the agent should be included in the e -mail.  
 
2Myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident (stroke) have been observed in multiple myeloma patients treated 
with lenalidomde and dexamethasone.  
 
3Graft vs. host disease has bee n observed in subjects who have received lenalidomide in the setting of allo -
transplantation.  
 
4Infection includes all 75 sites of infection under the INFECTIONS AND INFESTATIONS SOC.  
 
5The rare adverse event of rhabdomyolysis has been observed with lenali domide. The reports of rhabdomyolysis were 
confounded by concurrent use of statins and dexamethasone, concurrent viral and bacterial infections, trauma, and 
62 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B

Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 serotonin syndrome. Statins, infections, trauma, and serotonin syndrome are known risk factors for rhabdomyolysis.  
 
6There has been an increased frequency of secondary malignancies (SPM) including ALL, AML, and MDS, and certain 
other types of cancers of the skin and other organs in multiple myeloma (MM) patients being treated with melphalan, 
prednisone,   and lenalidomide post bone marrow transplant.  The use of lenalidomide in cancers other than MM, shows 
that invasive SPMs occurred in a small number of patients.  Patients treated with lenalidomide should be closely 
followed for the occurance of SPMs.  
 
7Serious tumor flare reactions have been observed in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and lymphoma.  
 
8A decrease in the number of stem cells (CD34+ cells) collected from patients treated with >4 cycles of lenalidomide has 
been reported.  
 
9Significantly increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and arterial thrombosis has 
been observed in patients with multiple myeloma receiving lenalidomide with dexamethasone.  
 
10Gastrointestinal hemorrhage includes: Anal hemorrha ge, Cecal hemorrhage, Colonic hemorrhage, Duodenal 
hemorrhage, Esophageal hemorrhage, Esophageal varices hemorrhage, Gastric hemorrhage, Hemorrhoidal hemorrhage, 
Ileal hemorrhage, Intra -abdominal hemorrhage, Jejunal hemorrhage, Lower gastrointestinal hemor rhage, Oral 
hemorrhage, Pancreatic hemorrhage, Rectal hemorrhage, Retroperitoneal hemorrhage, and Upper gastrointestinal 
hemorrhage under the GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS SOC.  
 
11Gastrointestinal obstruction includes:  Colonic obstruction, Duodenal obstructi on, Esophageal obstruction, Ileal 
obstruction, Jejunal obstruction, Obstruction gastric, Rectal obstruction, and Small intestinal obstruction under the 
GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS SOC.  
 
12Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been seen with increased frequency when lenalidomide is used in combination with 
bevacizumab, docetaxel (Taxotere®), prednisone, and zolendronic acid (Zometa®).  
 
NOTE :  While not observed in human subjects, l enalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, caused limb abnormalities in a 
developmental monke y study similar to birth defects caused by thalidomide in humans. If lenalidomide is used during 
pregnancy, it may cause birth defects or embryo -fetal death. Pregnancy must be excluded before start of treatment. 
Prevent pregnancy during treatment by the us e of two reliable methods of contraception.  
 
NOTE : In a trial of first line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), single agent lenalidomide 
(CC-5013) increased the risk of death as compared to control arm (chlorambucil).  
 
NOTE : In two randomized trials of patients with multiple myeloma (MM), the addition of MK -3475 (pembrolizumab) 
to a thalidomide analog plus dexamethasone, resulted in increased mortality.  Treatment of patients with MM with a PD -
1 or PD -L1 blocking antibody, such a s MK -3475 (pembrolizumab), in combination with a thalidomide analog, such as 
lenalidomide, is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.  
 
NOTE :  In a clinical trial in patients with Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), there was an increase in early dea ths (within 20 
weeks); 12.9% in the lenalidomide (CC -5013) arm vs. 7.1% in the control arm.

7.2. Adverse Event Characteristics  
 
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and g rading scales found in the 
revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be 
utilized for AE reporting.  All appropriate treatment areas should have access  to a copy of the 
CTCAE  version 5.0.  
•  CTCAE v5.0 documents, inc luding a mapping document, are available on the CTEP website: 
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  
 
• ‘Expectedness’ : AEs can be ‘Unexpected’ or ‘Expected’  (see Section 7.1 
above) for expedited reporting purposes only.  ‘Expected’ AEs (the ASAEL) 
are bold and italicized  in the CAEPR (Section 7.1.1).  
 
• Attribution  of the AE:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is like ly related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be rela ted to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
 
7.3. Expedited Adverse Event Reporting  
 
7.3.1.  Expedited AE reporting for this study must use CTEP -AERS (Adve rse Event Expedited 
Reporting System), accessed via the CTEP home page ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ).  The 
reporting procedures to be followed are presented in the “CTEP, NCI Guidelines: 
Adverse Event Reporting Requiremen ts” which can be downloaded from the CTEP home 
page ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ).  These requirements are briefly outlined in the tabl e below 
(Section 7.3.3).  
 
In the rare occurrence when Internet c onnectivity is disrupted a 24 -hour 
notification is to be made to NCI by telephone at 301 -897-7497 . An electronic 
report MUST  be submitted immediately upon reestablishment of internet 
connectio n. Please note that all paper CTEP -AERS  forms have been removed 
from the CTEP website.   
 
7.3.2.  CTEP -AERS  is programmed for automatic electronic distribution of reports to the 
following individuals:  Study Coordinator of the Lead Organization, Principal 
Investiga tor, and the local treating physician.  CTEP -AERS  provides a cop y feature for 
other e -mail recipients.

1 Adverse events with attribution of possible, probable, or definite that occur greater  than 30 days after the last dose 
of treatment with an agent under a CTEP IND require reporting as follows:  
CTEP -AERS  24-hour notification followed by complete report within 5 calendar days for:  
• Grade 3 unexpected events with hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
• Grade 4  unexpected events  
• Grade 5 expected events and unexpected events  
 
1. Although an CTEP -AERS  24-hour notification is not required for death clearly related to progressive disease, a full report 
is required as outlined in the table.  
3 Pregnancy is Grade 4/5 unexpected event.  
 
December 1 5, 2004  
 
Note:  All deaths on study require both routine and ex pedited reporting 
regardless of causality.  Attribution to treatment or other cause must be provided.  
 
• Expedited AE reporting timelines defined:  
➢ “24 hours; 5 calendar days” – The investigator must initially report the AE via 
CTEP -AERS  within 24 hours  of learning of the event followed by a complete 
CTEP -AERS  report within 5 calendar days  of the initial 24 -hour report.  
➢ “10 calendar days” - A complete CTEP -AERS  report on the AE must be 
submitted w ithin 10 calendar days of the investigator learning of the event .  
 
• Any medical event equivalent to CTCAE grade 3, 4, or 5 that precipitates 
hospitalization (or prolongation of existing hospitalization) must be reported 
regardless of attribution and design ation as expected or unexpected with the exception 
of any events  identified as protocol -specific expedited adverse event reporting 
exclusions.   
 
• Any event that results in persistent or significant disabilities/incapacities, congenital 
anomalies, or birth defects must be reported via CTEP -AERS  if the event occurs 
follo wing treatment with an agent under a CTEP IND.  
66 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
  
• Pregnancy (Grade 4/5 unexpected event) must be reported within 24 hour of learning 
of the event.   This applies to patients on cediranib alone o r cediranib and 
lenalidomide.  
 
For patients who become pregnant while on cediranib alone.  Discontinue cediranib 
immediately.  The Investigator will follow the subject until completion of the 
pregnancy, and must notify CTEP -AERS  reporting system of the out come as specified 
below.  The Investigator will provide this inf ormation as a follow -up to the initial 
SAE.  All neonatal deaths that occur within 30 days of birth should be reported, 
without regard to causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death aft er 30 days that 
the Investigator suspects is related to the in utero exposure to cediranib should also be 
reported.  
 
Females of Childbearing Potential:  
• Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test 
regardless of age or disease state) of a female subject or the partner of a male 
subject occu rring while the subject is on lenalidomide  or within 28 days after the 
subject’s last dose,  are considered immediately reportable events. Lenalidomide  is 
to be discontinued immediately. The pr egnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive 
pregnancy test must be  reported via CTEP -AERS  as a grade 4  event under: SOC 
pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions; adverse event: pregnancy, 
puerperium and perinatal conditions -other, fetal exposure.  
o The f emale subject should be referred to an obstetrician -gynecologist , 
preferably one experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation 
and counseling.  
• The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, 
and must make an  amendment to the initial pregnancy report immediately 
regarding  the outcome of the pregnancy  and neonatal status  (either normal or 
abnormal outcome).  
• If the outcome of th e pregnancy was abnormal (including spontaneous or 
therapeutic abortion , fetal demise  and congenital abnormalities ), the Investigator 
should report t he abnormal outcome as an amendment to the initial pregnancy 
report as soon as the as the Investigator has knowledge of the outcome .  
• All neonatal deaths  and neonatal complications  that occur within 28 days of birth 
should be reported, without regard to ca usality, as an amendment to the initial 
pregnancy report.  In addition, any infant death after 28 days that the Investigator 
suspects is related to the in utero  exposure to the lenalidomide  should also be 
reported as an amendment within 24 hours of the Inve stigator’s knowledge of the 
event.  
 
Male Subjects  
• If a female partner of a male subject taking investigational product becomes 
pregnant, the male subject taking lenalidomide  should notify the Investigator, and 
the pregnant female partne r should be advised to call he r healthcare provider

1 Adverse events with attribution of possible, probable, or definite that occur greater  than 30 days after the last dose of 
treatme nt with an agent under a CTEP IND require reporting as follows:  
CTEP -AERS  24-hour notification followed by complete report within 5 calendar days for:  
• Grade 4 and Grade 5 unexpected events  
 CTEP -AERS  10 calendar day report:  
• Grade 3 unexpected events with hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
• Grade 5 expec ted events  
2 Although an CTEP -AERS  24-hour notification is not required for death clearly related to progressive disease, a full report is required 
as outlined in the table.  
3 Pregnancy is Gra de 4/5 unexpected event.  
 
December 15, 2004  
 
Note:  All deaths on study require both routine and expedited reporting regardless of 
causality.  Attribution to treatment or other cause must be provided.  
 
• Expedited AE reporting timelines defined:  
➢ “24 hours; 5 calendar days” – The investigator must initially report the AE  via 
CTEP -AERS  within 24 hours  of learning of the event followed by a complete 
CTEP -AERS  report within 5 calendar days  of the initial 24 -hour report.  
➢ “10 calendar days” - A complete CTEP -AERS  report on the AE must be 
submitted within 10 calendar days  of the investigator learning of the event.  
 
• Any medical event equivalent to CTCAE grade 3, 4, or 5 that precipitates 
hospitalization (or prolongation of existing hospitalization) must be reported 
regardless of attribution and designation as expected or unexpec ted with the 
exception of any events identified as protocol -specific expedited adverse event 
reporting exclusions.

Version Date:    09/25/2019  
  
• Any event that results in persistent or significant disabilities/incapacit ies, 
congenital anomalies, or birth defects must be reported via  CTEP -AERS  if the 
event occurs following treatment with an agent under a CTEP IND.  
 
• Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID assigned during 
trial registration on all r eports.  
 
• Pregnancy (Grade 4/5 unexpected event) must be reported  within 24 hour of 
learning of the event.   This includes pregnancies while on cediranib or 
lenalidomide or within 4 weeks after a subjects last dose of cediranib or 
lenalidomide.   
 
For patie nts who become pregnant while on cediranib alone.  Discontinue 
cediranib immediately.  The Investigator will follow the subject until completion 
of the pregnancy, and must notify CTEP -AERS  reporting system of the outcome 
as specified below.  The Investigat or will provide this information as a follow -up 
to the initial S AE.  All neonatal deaths that occur within 30 days of birth should 
be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death 
after 30 days that the Investigator suspect s is related to the in utero  exposure to 
cediranib should also b e reported.  
 
Females of Childbearing Potential:  
• Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test 
regardless of age or disease state) of a female subject or the partne r of a male 
subject occurring while the subject is on lenalidomi de or within 28 days after the 
subject’s last dose,  are considered immediately reportable events. Lenalidomide  is 
to be discontinued immediately. The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positiv e 
pregnancy test must be reported via CTEP -AERS  as a grade 4  event under: SOC 
pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions; adverse event: pregnancy, 
puerperium and perinatal conditions -other, fetal exposure.  
o The female subject should be referred to an o bstetrician -gynecologist, 
preferably one experienced in reproduc tive toxicity for further evaluation 
and counseling.  
• The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, 
and must make an amendment to the initial pregnancy repo rt immediately 
regarding  the outcome of the pregnancy  and neonat al status  (either normal or 
abnormal outcome).  
• If the outcome of th e pregnancy was abnormal (including spontaneous or 
therapeutic abortion , fetal demise and congenital abnormalities ), the Inve stigator 
should report the abnormal outcome as an amendment to t he initial pregnancy 
report as soon as the as the Investigator has knowledge of the outcome .  
• All neonatal deaths  and neonatal complications  that occur within 28 days of birth 
should be report ed, without regard to causality, as an amendment to the initial 
pregnancy report.  In addition, any infant death after 28 days that the Investigator 
69

NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 suspects is related to the in utero  exposure to the lenalidomide  should also be 
reported as an amendment within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the 
event.  
 
Male  Subjects  
• If a female partner of a male subject taking investigational product becomes 
pregnant, the male subject taking lenalidomide  should notify the Investigator, and 
the pregnant female pa rtner should be advised to call he r healthcare provider 
immediat ely. 
 
 
 
7.5. Routine Adverse Event Reporting  
 
All Adverse Events must  be reported in routine study data submissions.  AEs 
reported through CTEP -AERS  must also be reported in routine study data 
subm issions.  
 
7.6. Secondary  Malignancies (including  AML  and MDS ) 
 
Invest igators are required to report cases of secondary malignancies, including 
AML/MDS , occurring on or following treatment on NCI -sponsored chemotherapy 
protocols via CTEP -AERS with CTCAE 5.0.  Refer to the CTEP web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov ) for additional information about secondary AML/MDS 
reporting.  
o In addition to all routine AE reporting mechanisms and any 
Cooperative Group -speci fic second/secondary malignancy reporting 
requirements, all new malignant tumors must be reported through CTEP -
AERS  whether or not they are thought to be related to either previous or 
current treatment.    All new malignancies should be reported including 
solid tumors (including non -melanoma skin malignancies),  hematolo gic 
malignancies, Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)/Acute Myelogenous 
Leukemia (AML), and in situ  tumors.

 commercial agents administered in this study can be found in Section 7.1.  
 
8.1.       CTEP -Supplied Investigational  Agent s 
 
8.1.1.  Cediranib  (AZD2171 , NSC 732208)  
 
Chemical Name:  4-[(4-Fluoro -2-methyl -1H-indol -5-yl)oxy] -6-methoxy -7-[3-(pyrrolidin -1- yl)propoxy] quina zoline 
maleate  
 
Other Names: cediranib, AZD2171 maleate  
 
CAS Registry Number:  288383 -20-0 (for the free base)  
 
Molecular Formula: C25H27FN 4O3 · C 4H4O4        M W: 566.59 (maleate salt), 450.5 2 (free base)  
 
Approximate Solubility:  The aqueous solubility of  AZD2171 (cediranib) is 0.0006 mg/mL for the free base (distilled water, 
pH 8.1 at 25°C) and 1.76 mg/mL for the maleate salt (distilled water, at 25°C).  
 
Mode of Action:  AZD2171 (cediranib) i s a highly potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor of all three vascula r endothelial growth 
factor receptors (VEGFR -1, -2 and -3). Inhibition of VEGF signaling leads to inhibition of angiogenesis, 
neovascular survival and vascular permeability. Pre -clinical tumor  models show that AZD2171 (cediranib) reduces 
micro -vessel densi ty and metastasis, indicating that it limits tumor growth.  
 
How Supplied:   Astra -Zeneca supplies and CTEP, NCI, DCTD distributes AZD2171 (cediranib) . The agent is available as 
beige, round, bi convex, film -coated tablets containing 15 mg, and 20 mg of AZD21 71 (cediranib)  free base.   The 15 
mg and 20 mg tablets are 7 mm and 8 mm in diameter, respectively.   Each high -density polyethylene bottle contains 
35 tablets.  
 
Tablet excipients include manni tol, dibasic calcium phosphate anhydrous, sodium starch glycolat e, microcrystalline 
cellulose, and magnesium stearate with a film coat containing hypromellose 2910, polyethylene glycol 400, red iron 
oxide, yellow iron oxide, black iron oxide, and titanium dioxide.  
 
Storage: Store intact bottles at controlled room temp erature 20°C to 25°C (68 to 77°F)  and protect from light and 
moisture.  
 
Stability: Stability studies are ongoing. Dispense AZD2171 (cediranib) tablets in their original containers. Alternativ ely, 
if exact quantity is dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, the su pply should be assigned a 30 -day expiration.  
 
If a storage temperature excursion is identified, promptly return AZD2171 (cediranib) to room temperature and 
quarantine the supplies.  Provide a detailed report of the excursion (including documentation of tem perature 
monitoring and duration of the excursion) to PMBAfterHours@mail.nih.gov  for determination of suitability.    
 
Route  and Method  of Admi nistration:   Oral.   AZD2171 (cediranib) tablets should be taken  either one hour before or two 
hours after meals.  
 
 If the study sponsor determines appropriate, cediranib tablets may be administered as a dispersion in plain water. 
Liquids other than non -carbonated water should not be used and the tablets should not be  crushed or ground. The 
following procedure is recommended by the manufacturer for patients who can swallow liquids:  
 
Drop the appropriate dose of cediranib tablet/s into a glass containing 50 -60 mL non -carbonated water. Stir 
the tablet/s until dispersed i n the water, about 10 minutes (no crushing). Swallow the liquid immediately 
after dispersion is completed. Any residue in the glass is mixed with a half glass of water and swallowed.

NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
  
The manu facturer recommends the following for naso -gastric or gastrostom y tube administration:  
 
Follow the dispersion instructions above. Administer the dispersion using polyurethane or PVC naso -
gastric, naso -intestinal or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feedi ng systems in conjunction with 
polyurethane syringes. PVC syring es are not recommended. Conduct two system washes to ensure the 
patient receives the full dose.  
 
Potential Drug Interactions: AZD2171 (cediranib) is primarily metabolized by flavin -containing monooxygenase enzymes 
(FMO1 and FMO3) and UGT1A4. It is not a su bstrate of CYP450 enzymes. In vitro studies suggest that AZD2171 
(cediranib) is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (Pgp), but not breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Since 
clinically relevant  induction or inhibition of FMO enzymes is uncommon , use caution  in patients taking 
concomitant medications that are strong inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole) or strong inducers (e.g. rifampicin, 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin and St. John’s Wort) of UGT1A4 or Pgp in particular. If chronic 
concomitant administrati on of strong inducers or inhibitors is unavoidable, consult the protocol document 
and/or the principal investigator before making any dose adjustments.  
 In vitro  studies show that AZD2171 (cediranib) did not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and 2E1 and  
showed no induction of CYP 1A2, 2B6 and 3A4/5. It did weakly inhibit CYP 2D6 and 3A4/5, but this 
inhibition not expected to cause any clinically relevant drug interactions.  
 
In vitro  studies show that AZD2171 (cediranib)  is a weak inhibitor of BCRP, but n ot Pgp. Use caution in 
patients who are taking concomitant medications that are sensitive substrates of  BCRP transporters since there 
is a potential for drug -drug interactions.  
 
AZD2171 (cediranib) is approximately 95% bound to human plasma proteins, wit h human serum albumin and 
α1-acid glycoprotein accounting for most of this binding. Use caution in patients taking concomitant 
medications with narrow therapeutic ranges that are also highly protein -bound.  
 
Oral anticoagulants are not absolutely contraindi cated during treatment with AZD2171 (cediranib) ; however, 
use AZD2171 (cediranib) with caution and increase monitoring in patients while on study. Patients who receive 
VEGF inhibitors are at increased  risk of bleeding and hemorrhage.  
 
Patient Care Implicat ions:  Agents that inhibit VEGF signaling have the potential to affect wound healing. For patients 
already enrolled onto the protocol, the manufacturer recommends holding AZD2171 (cediranib)  for 2 week s 
prior to elective surgery and restarting when the surg ical wound is healed. Protocol exclusion criteria should 
include patients who have had major thoracic or abdominal surgery within 2 weeks prior to start of study or 
patients with any surgical incision  that is not fully healed.  
 
 
 
 
8.1.2.  Lenalidomide  (CC-5013 , NSC 703813)  
NOTE:  
Before lenalidomide is dispensed, patients must 1) have a negative pregnancy test (if 
applicable) and 2) be counseled by a trained counselor. Pharmacists may be trained 
counselors (se e Lenalidomide Counselor Program Site Counselor Identifi cation Form in 
the protocol). The counseling requirements for investigational -use lenalidomide are 
separate from  the RevAssist program. Only a 28 -day supply may be dispensed to a 
patient at one time.

Chemical Name:    3-(4’aminoisoindoline -1’-one)-1-piperidine -2,6-dione;    
   α-(3-aminothalamido) glucaride.  
 
Other Names:          Lenalidomide ,  Revlimid™ (formerly known as 
Revimid™), CDC -501 
 
Classification:       Immunomodulatory Agent  
 
CAS Registry Number:        191732 -72-6 
 
Molecular Formula:    C13H13N303   M.W.:   259.26  
 
Mode of Action:    CC-5013, a thalidomide analog, is an immunomodulatory 
agent with a spectrum of activity that is not fully 
characterized.  In vitro, it inhibits  secretion of the pro -
inflammatory cytokines TNF -α, IL -1β, and IL -6 and 
increases secretion o f the anti -inflammatory cytokine IL -10. 
 It also induces T -cell proliferation, IL -2 and IFN -γ 
production in vitro.  
 
How Supplied:       Celgene supplies and CTEP, NCI, DCTD distributes lenalidomide 
5 mg (size 2) hard gelatin capsules in tamper -evident, chi ld-
resistant, opaque, high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with 
HDPE caps. Bottles contain 100 capsules per container. The 21 -
count and 28 -count bottles are no longer available.  
The capsules also contain anhydrous lactose, microcrystalline 
cellulose, c roscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate.  
. 
Storage:     The capsules should be stored at room temperature (15 -
30°C) away from moisture and direct sunlight.   
 
Stability:     Refer to the package labeling for expiration date.  
Lenalidomide stability is adequate for at least 28 days after 
transferring to a pharmacy vial. ”  
 
Route  of Administration:   Take lenalidomide by mouth with or without food. Do not 
crush, chew or open capsules.   See Section 5.1 and 
Appendix M for patients who cannot swallow lenalido mide.   
 
Dispensing:    Only a 28 -day supply may be dispensed at one time.  Sites 
may not mail lenalidomide to patients.  
 
Patient Care Implications and Counseling:   
Risks Associated with Pregnancy  
73 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomi de is a known human 
teratogenic active substance that causes severe life -threatening birth defects.  An embryo  
fetal development study in animals indicates that lenalidomide produced malformations in 
the offspring of female monkeys who received the drug du ring pregnancy.  The teratogenic 
effect of lenalidomide in humans cannot be ruled out.  Therefore, a risk minimization plan to 
prevent pregnancy must be observed.  
  
Definition of female of childbearing potential (FCBP)  
This protocol defines a female of chi ldbearing potential as a sexually mature woman who: 1) 
has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 2) has not been naturally 
postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing 
potential) for at least 24 con secutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the 
preceding 24 consecutive months).  
 
Before starting study drug:   
Female Subjects:    
• FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests ( minimum sensitivity of  25 mI  U/mL) 
prior to starting study drug.  The first pregnancy test must be performed within 10 -14 
days prior to the start of study drug and the second pregnancy test must be performed 
within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug.  The subject may not receive study 
drug until the Investigator has v erified that the results of these pregnancy tests are 
negative.  
 
Male Subjects:    
• Must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with females of childbearing 
potential while participating in the study and for at least 28 days following 
discontinuat ion from the study even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.  
 
All Subjects:  
• Only enough lenalidomide for one cycle of therapy may be dispensed with each cycle 
of therapy .  
 
• If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in a study subject or the partner 
of a male study subject during study participation, lenalidomide must be immediately 
discontinued.  
 
Counseling  
• In investigational studies where lenalidomide is supplied by the NCI,  patients will be 
counseled by a qualified healthcare profession al (including but not limited to, nurses, 
pharmacists and physicians).   Two healthcare professionals at each site will be trained 
by Celgene in requirements specific to counseling of subjects (investigators cannot 
counsel patients as part of this requireme nt). Refer to specific protocol sections for 
more information about training requirements.  
 
74 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 • Once trained, these healthcare staff will counsel subjects prior to  medication being 
dispensed to ensure that the subject has complied with all requirements includi ng use 
of birth control and pregnancy testing (FCBP) and that the subject understands the 
risks associated with lenalidomide.  This step will be documented with a completed 
Lenalidomide Education and Counselin g Guidance Document (Appendix I ) and no 
drug wi ll be dispensed until this step occurs. Counseling includes verification with 
the female patient that required pregnancy testing was performed and results were 
negative. A  Lenalidomid e Information Sheet  (Appendix J ) will be supplied with each 
medication di spense. ” 
 
 
 
 
 
If a dose of lenalidomide is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day.  If 
it is missed for the entire day, it should not be made up.  Patients who take more than the 
prescribed dose of lenalidomide should be instructed t o seek emergency medical care if 
needed and contact study staff immediately.     
 
Potential Drug Interactions:    
Periodic monitoring of digoxin levels is recommended during coadministration with  CC -
5013.  Digoxin levels were slightly higher when digoxin wa s administered with CC -5013 in 
a clinical study.  There was no effect on CC -5013 pharmacokinetics.  
 
Warfarin and CC -5013 may be co -administered without additional monitoring.  No 
pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed between CC -5013 and 
warfarin.  
 
Nonclinical in vitro metabolism studies suggest that CC -5013 is not likely to result in 
metabolic drug interactions in humans.  In vitro, CC -5013 did not significantly inhibit 
marker enzyme activities for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or 
CYP3A4.  In rats, no induction of any CYP450 enzymes was observed. Administration of 
CC-5013 in monkeys showed no effects on the activities of CYP1A, CYP2B, CYP2C, 
CYP2E, CYP3A, or CYP4A.

9. CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES  
 
All sub jects will be asked to provide archival tumor tissue.  
 
9.1. Rationale  
 
Archival tumor tissue:  
B-RAF gene  
K-RAS gene  
 
Pharmacogenomics:  
Advanced thyroid carcinoma is a heterogenous group of diseases likely caused by a 
variety of molecular defects.  Variable res ponses in previous clinic al trials are likely 
due in part to differences in the underlying disease processes.  Data from studies with 
other targeted agents suggest that different molecular aberrations may affect clinical 
response.  For example, in the Phas e II clinical trial with motesanib diphosphate  with 
advanced DTC, DNA from 33 tumors of trial patients was screened for mutations 
often observed in DTC.  Six of the 10 patients (60%) whose tumor contained the B-
RAFV600E mutation had either a partial respon se or durable stable disease.  In contrast 
5 of 15 patients without the mutation (33%) had a partial response or durable stable 
disease.25  While the number of tumor samples was too small to show significance, 
the findings do suggest that B-RAF mutations may affect response.  In addition, in a 
Phase II study of the multi -target tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib, of sixteen DTC 
patients who had genotype testing, those with B-RAFV600E mutations had significantly 
longer PFS compared to those who did not (84+ weeks versus weeks).26  B-RAF 
mutations have been reported in 29 -83% of PTCs and K-RAS mutations have been 
found in 21 -50% of FTCs.27 We plan to  evaluate B-RAF mutations and K-RAS 
mutations  in available tumor samples  to assess whether these mutation s predict 
response.  This study will provide an exc ellent opportunity to further clarify the r ole 
of the previously described polymorphisms in thyroid carcinoma.

On arrival, each sample will be assigned a Study Number .  All subsequent handling of 
the tissue samples will be blinded to the investigators performing various tes ts, except for 
the clinical pathologists. Only biopsy samples determined by the pathologist to contain 
tumor will be subjected to immunohistochemical analysis. For all immunohistochemical 
studies, samples will only be marked with an assigned study number.  Patient name, 
diagnosis and other information will be unknown to the laboratory/clinical investigators 
involved and will be revealed only after studies are completed for further data analysis 
and statistics.  
 
 9.2 Laboratory Correlative Studies  
 
B-RAF and K-RAS mutations  
Formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks and H&E stained slides will be 
collected at the site of the enrollee when available and packed and shipped by FedEX to the 
University of Chicago as described above.  H&E stained slides will be reviewed and the 
optimal block will be picked for molecular analysis.   It should have a contiguous convex 
area at least 3 mm in minimum dimension with at least 50% involvement by tumor.   DNA 
will be prepared from the FFPE  tissue blocks. Ten unstai ned 5 micron  sections are then cut, 
the 5th slide in the set is stained (H&E) to confirm pathology and guide macrodissection (if 
necessary) of the other slides.   Following deparaffinization DNA is extracted and quantified 
using either the Nanodrop(TM -superscript) or a Picogreen dye binding assay.  
 
DNA is analysed for any K-RAS mutation in codons 12 or 13 following the procedure 
described by Nikiforova et a.l28 This is a real -time hybridization probe polymerase chai n 
reaction assay run on a LightCyclerTM 2.0. To increase sensitivity (when tumor involves less 
than 20% of section) a modified form of this assay LightMix® Kit  k-ras Mutations Codons

 12/1 3  TM from TIB -MolBiol  may be used.  This uses a ‘blocking’ probe modi fied with locked 
nucleic acids to block amplification of the normal sequence at codons 12 and 13. At present 
this modification is for research use only.  
 
Detection of B-RAFV600E mutation will be performed using real -time PCR and fluorescence 
melting curve analysis (FMCA) from DNA as previously reported by our group. Briefly, a 
pair of oligonucleotide primers flanking the mutation site have been designed, together with 
two fluorescent probes, with the sensor probe spanning the nucleotide position 1799. 
Ampli fication will be performed in a glass capillary using 50 ng of DNA in a 20 microliter 
volume. The reaction mixture is then to 45 cycles of rapid PCR consisting of denaturation at 
94 degrees C for 1 sec, annealing at 55 degrees C for 20 sec, and extension a t 72 degrees C 
for 10 sec. Post -amplification FMCA is performed by gradual heating of samples at a rate of 
0.2degreesC/sec from 45 degrees C to 95 degrees C. All PCR products that showed deviation 
from the wild -type (placental DNA) melting peak are sequenc ed to verify the presence of 
mutation.  
 
 
10. STUDY CALENDAR  
Baseline evaluations are to be conducted within  2 week prior to start of protocol therapy.  Scans 
and x -rays must be done 
 4 weeks prior to the start of therapy.  In the event that the patient's 
condi tion is deteriorating, laboratory evaluations should be repeated within 48 hours prior to 
initiation of the next cycle of therapy.

hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been na turally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the 
preceding 24 consecutive months).   
g: Pregnancy tests must occur within 10 – 14 days and again within 24 hours prior to initiation of lenalidomide.  FCBP with regular or no menstruation must have a 
pregnancy test weekly for the first 28 days and then every 28 days while on therapy (including breaks in therapy); at discont inuation of lenalidomide and at Day 28 
post the last dose of lenalidomide.  Females with irr egular menstruation must have a pregnancy test weekly for the first 28 days and then every 14 days while on 
therapy (including breaks in therapy), at discontinuation of lenalidomide and at Day 14 and Day 28 post the last dose of lena lidomide (see Appendix H: Lenalidomide

11. MEASUREMENT OF EF FECT  
 
11.1. Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response every   8   weeks.   
In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained  8 weeks following 
initial documentation of o bjective response.   Subjects who have been on treatment for 1 8 
months or more will have radiological evaluation every 4 cycles.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
80 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline 
(version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228 -247, 2009].   Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph 
nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
11.1.1.  Definitions  
 
Evaluable for toxicity .  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first 
treatment with cediranib or cediranib in combination with lenalidomide.  
 
Evaluable for objective response.   Only those pati ents who have measurable disease present 
at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -
evaluated will be considered evaluable for response.   These patients will have their response 
classified according to the defin itions stated below.   (Note:   Patients who exhibit objective 
disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response .  Patients who have lesions present at baseline that 
are evaluable but d o not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least 
one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for 
non-target disease.   The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or 
unequ ivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
11.1.2.  Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease .  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured 
in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non -nodal lesions and short 
axis for nodal lesions) as >20 mm by chest x -ray, as >10 mm with CT scan, or >10 mm with 
calipers by clinical exam.  All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters  (or 
decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note:   Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irra diated area are not considered 
measurable.    
 
Malignant lymph nodes.   To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be >15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 m m).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis 
will be measured and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), are 
considered non -measurable disease.   Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and 
abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non -measurable.  
 
Note:   Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should 
81 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they 
are, by definition, simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ though t to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic 
lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions 
in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and 
recorded and measured at baseline.   Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their 
size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.   It may 
be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion doe s not lend itself to reproducible 
measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured 
reproducibly should be selected.   A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short 
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline 
sum diameters.   If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is 
added into the sum.   The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further 
characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions 
over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also 
be recorded  at baseline.   Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, 
absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -
up.  
 
11.1.3.  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
All measurements should be take n and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.   
All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 
The same method of assessmen t and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged b ut are assessable by clinical exam.  
 
Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 
 10 mm diameter as assessed 
using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).   In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color 
photograph y, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.   However, CT is preferable.  
 
82 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 Conventional CT and MRI   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan 
based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.   If CT scans have slice 
thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the 
slice thickness.   MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).    
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.   MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, whic h 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement.   Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally.   As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical 
specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the ev aluation of the 
type and site of disease.   Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should be 
the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same 
pulse sequence.   It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guid elines to prescribe specific MRI 
pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.   Ideally, the same type 
of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely 
as possible to prior scans.   Body  
scans should be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
 
PET-CT  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET -
CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.   
However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical 
diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the 
PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with  
conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.   Note, however, that the 
PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not 
routinely or serially performed.    
 
Ultrasound   Ultrasound is not usefu l in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement.   Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for 
independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to 
the next.   If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation 
by CT or MRI is advised.   If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may b e 
used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation 
is not advised.   However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological 
response when biopsies are obta ined or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence 
following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 
Tumor markers   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.   If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, th ey must normalize for a patient to be considered in 
complete clinical response.   Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [ JNCI  
96:487 -488, 2004; J Clin O ncol 17, 3461 -3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  26:1148 -1159, 2008].   In 
83 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -125 progression criteria 
which are to be integrated with objective tumor assessment for use in first -line trials in 
ovarian cancer [JNCI  92:1534 -1535, 2000].  
 
Cytology, Histology   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses 
(PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as 
germ cell tumors, where known residual b enign tumors can remain).  
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between respon se or stable disease (an effusion may be a side 
effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
FDG -PET  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT sca nning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).   New lesions on the basis of 
FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive FDG -
PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD.   If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new si te of disease on CT, 
additional follow -up CT   scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal 
FDG -PET scan).   If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up correspond s to a pre -existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this 
is not PD.  
c. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy 
in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is t hought to represent fibrosis or 
scarring.   The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively 
described in the protocol and supported by disease -specific medical literature for the 
indication.   However, it must be acknowledged that both approa ches may lead to false 
positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
  
 Note:   A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation c orrected image.  
 
11.1.4.  Response Criteria  
 
11.1.4.1.  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :     Disappearance of all target lesions.   Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in 
short axis to <10 mm.  
 
84 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 Partial Response ( PR):    At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :      At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the sma llest sum on study (this 
includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).   In 
addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.   (Note:   the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is a lso considered 
progressions).  
 
Stable Disease (SD) :               Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum 
diameters while on study  
 
11.1.4.2.  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Com plete Response (CR) :      Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level.   All lymph nodes must be non -pathological 
in size (<10 mm short axis)  
 
Note:   If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal 
limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in 
complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:                   Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :      Appea rance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression  of existing non -target lesions.   Unequivocal 
progression  should not normally trump target lesion status.   It 
must be representative of overall disease status change, not a 
single lesion increa se.     
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of the 
treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator).  
 
11.1.4.3.  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorde d since the treatment started).   The patient's best response assignment 
will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

11.1.5.  Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date 
that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for 
progressive di sease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for 
CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.     
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until 
the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
11.1.6.  Progression -Free Survival  
 
Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to 
time of progression or death of any cause.  
 
11.1.7.  Response Review  
 
All responses will be reviewed by an expert(s) independent of the study at the study’s 
completion.

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
13.1. Study Design/Endpoints  
 
13.1.1.  Phase I.  
 
The phase I trial will use a 3+3 design with the MTD defined as the highest dose level such 
that <2 of 6 patients experience d ose-limiting toxicity .   
 
90 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 13.1.2.  Phase II.  
 
There is no standard therapy for differentiated thyroid cancer that is refractory to radioactive 
iodine.  The best studied agent in this disease, doxorubicin, has an estimated response rate of 
10%.  Although cediranib has not been studied in thyroid cancer, a phase II study of the 
VEGF inhibitor motesanib diphospate showed a median progression -free survival  (PFS)  of 
40 weeks.  Because we hypothesis that combination therapy will be more effective than 
single agent treatm ent, we will randomize in a 1:2 ratio, which should enhance recruitment.   
The randomization will be stratified by  prior therapy with a VEGF -pathway inhibitor (yes vs. 
no) and performance sta tus (0 -1 vs. 2)  
 
The primary endpoint will be PFS, which will be compared between  the two  treatment arms 
using a stratified logrank test. T o determine the sample size, we noted that the  median PFS in 
93 patients with radioiodine -resistant thyroid cancer treated with motesanib diphosphate25 
was 40 weeks. We therefore assu me a median of 40 weeks for the cediranib alone arm. In 
order to have 85% power to detect a 75% improvement in the median to 70 weeks with 
combination therapy  (hazard ratio [HR]=1.75) , 110 patients will be required (3 6 randomized 
to cediranib and 7 4 to ced iranib plus lenalidomide), based on a one -sided test at the 
alpha=0.10 significance level.  This calculation assumes 1 year of accrual (9 patients per 
month) and 1.5 years of additional follow -up for a total study duration of 2.5 years.   Kaplan -
Meier30 curves will be generated for each treatment arm and the median PFS times estimated 
using the Brookmeyer and Crowley method31.  In addition to the logrank test, PFS in the two 
groups will be analyzed  by fitting a Cox32 proportional hazards regression model, ad justing 
for prior VEGF inhibitor use, performance status, and other baseline risk factors.  The 
goodness of fit of the Cox model and the appropriate functional form for continuous 
covariates will be assessed using graphical techniques , including inspection  of martingale 
residual plots.   
 
An interim futility analysis will be performed after half of the total number of projected 
events ( 40 of 80 projected  events ). The trial will stopped for futility if the conditional power 
at this time point is  15% or less,  reducing the power by 2-3%.  
 
 
13.2. Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
 Phase I1: 9-18 patient s.  Accrual 3 patient/mo  
Phase II: Sample size 110 patients.  Accrual 9-10 patient s/mo. 
 
13.3. Stratification Factors  
 
Phase II.  Patients will be stratified on prior use of VEGF -pathway inhibitors (yes vs 
no) and performance status (0 and 1 vs 2).    
 
13.4. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
 
91 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 13.4.1.  Phase I.   
 
The objective response rate of cediranib in combination with lenalidomide in patients with 
iodine refractory, unresectable DTC who have evid ence of disease progression within 6 
months of study enrollment will be estimated.  In addition, the toxicity, duration of response, 
progression free survival, and overall survival in patients with DTC treated with cediranib 
plus lenalidomide will be evalu ated.  
 
13.4.2.  Phase II.   
 
Overall survival (OS) rates will be estimated and compared between groups using 
methods similar to that described above for PFS    Response rates will be compared 
using a chisquare test followed by logistic regression analysis to adjust for covariates. 
  
 
The percent change in tumor size from baseline to the end of cycle 2 ( two months ) 
will be compared between the two groups using a two -sample t test33.  The post -
treatment total sum of lengths for a patient with a new lesion will be score d as 
1.2*max(pre -sum, post -sum) to ensure that the appearance of new lesions 
corresponds to a disease progression per RECIST criteria.   In the event of any early 
deaths prior to two months, a nonparametric rank sum test will be used in place of the 
t test,  with deaths ranked at the extreme end of the distribution.   
 
Adverse events will be summarized by type and grade.  Adverse event rates will be 
compared between the two treatment groups using a chisquare test for common 
toxicities and Fisher’s exact test for less frequent events.   
 
Repeated measures analysis of variance (RM ANOVA) will be performed to 
determine the effect of the treatments on serial measurements of TSH and 
thyroglobulin.  It is hypothesized that these levels will decrease over time.  Base line 
tissue biomarker expression, scored as present or absent, of B-RAF and RAS 
mutations will be correlated with response rates using Fisher’s exact test, and with 
PFS and OS by fitting a Cox proportional hazards regression model.    
 
 
 
13.5. Reporting and Excl usions 
 
13.5.1.  Evaluation of toxicity.  All patients  (Phase I and II)  will be evaluable for toxicity 
from the time of their first treatment with cediranib or cediranib plus lenalidomide.  
 
13.5.2.  Evaluation of response.   All patients included in the study  (Phase I and II ) will be 
assessed for response to treatment, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations 
or if they are ineligible.  Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories:  1) 
complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4)  progressive disease, 5) early 
92 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 death from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death because of 
other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data).   
 
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of 
those who received no study medication) will be included in the main analysis of 
the response rate.  Patients in response categories 4 -9 will be considered to have a 
treatment failure  (disease progression).  Thus, an incorrect treatment schedu le or 
drug administration will not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response 
rate.   
 
All conclusions will be based on all eligible patients.  Subanalyses may then be 
performed on the basis of a subset of patients, excluding those for whom majo r 
protocol deviations have been identified (e.g., early death due to other reasons, 
early discontinuation of treatment, major protocol violations, etc.).  However, 
these subanalyses will not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning 
treatment e fficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis will 
be clearly reported. Data will be reported to CTEP using CDUS -Complete.

 APPENDIX E  
CTEP MULTICENTER GUIDELINES  
 
If an institution wishes to collaborate with other participating institutions in performing a 
CTEP sponsor ed research protocol, then the following guidelines must be followed.  
 
Responsibility of the Protocol Chair  
• The Protocol Chair will be the single liaison with the CTEP Protocol and Information 
Office (PIO).  The Protocol Chair is responsible for the coord ination, development, 
submission, and approval of the protocol as well as its subsequent amendments.  The 
protocol must not be rewritten or modified by anyone other than the Protocol Chair.  
There will be only one version of the protocol, and each particip ating institution will use 
that document.  The Protocol Chair is responsible for assuring that all participating 
institutions are using the correct version of the protocol.  
• The Protocol Chair is responsible for the overall conduct of the study at all parti cipating 
institutions and for monitoring its progress.  All reporting requirements to CTEP are the 
responsibility of the Protocol Chair.  
• The Protocol Chair is responsible for the timely review of Adverse Events (AE) to assure 
safety of the patients.  
• The P rotocol Chair will be responsible for the review of and timely submission of data 
for study analysis.  
 
Responsibilities of the Coordinating Center  
• Each participating institution will have an appropriate assurance on file with the Office 
for Human Research Protection (OHRP), NIH.   The Coordinating Center is responsible 
for assuring that each participating institution has an OHRP assurance and must maintain 
copies of IRB approvals from each participating site.  
•  Prior to the activation of the protocol at each  participating institution, an OHRP form 
310 (documentation of IRB approval) must be submitted to the CTEP PIO.  
• The Coordinating Center is responsible for central patient registration.  The Coordinating 
Center is responsible for assuring that IRB approval has been obtained at each 
participating site prior to the first patient registration from that site.  
• The Coordinating Center is responsible for the preparation of all submitted data for 
review by the Protocol Chair.  
• The Coordinating Center will maintain do cumentation of AE reports.  There are two 
options for AE reporting: (1) participating institutions may report directly to CTEP with a 
copy to the Coordinating Center, or (2) participating institutions report to the 
Coordinating Center who in turn report to  CTEP.  The Coordinating Center will submit 
AE reports to the Protocol Chair for timely review.  
 
104 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 • Audits may be accomplished in one of two ways:  (1) source documents and research 
records for selected patients are brought from participating sites to the Co ordinating 
Center for audit, or (2) selected patient records may be audited on -site at participating 
sites.  If the NCI chooses to have an audit at the Coordinating Center, then the 
Coordinating Center is responsible for having all source documents, resear ch records, all 
IRB approval documents, NCI Drug Accountability Record forms, patient registration 
lists, response assessments scans, x -rays, etc. available for the audit.  
 
Inclusion of Multicenter Guidelines in the Protocol  
• The protocol must include the f ollowing minimum information:  
➢ The title page must include the name and address of each participating institution and 
the name, telephone number and e -mail address of the responsible investigator at each 
participating institution.  
➢ The Coordinating Center m ust be designated on the title page.  
➢ Central registration of patients is required.  The procedures for registration must be 
stated in the protocol.  
➢ Data collection forms should be of a common format.  Sample forms should be 
submitted with the protocol.  Th e frequency and timing of data submission forms to 
the Coordinating Center should be stated.  
➢ Describe how AEs will be reported from the participating institutions, either directly 
to CTEP or through the Coordinating Center.  
➢ Describe how Safety Reports and Action Letters from CTEP will be distributed to 
participating institutions.   
 
Agent Ordering  
• Except in very unusual circumstances, each participating institution will order DCTD -
supplied agents directly from CTEP.  Agents may be ordered by a participating site only 
after the initial IRB approval for the site has been forwarded by the Coordinating Center 
to the CTEP PIO.

 APPENDIX H  
 
Lenalidomide Risk s of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable 
Birth Control Methods  
Risks Associated with Pregnancy  
Lenal idomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic 
active substance that causes severe life -threatening birth defects.  An embryofetal development 
study in animals indicates that lenalidomide produced malformations in the offspring of female 
monkeys who received the drug during pregnancy.  The teratogenic effect of lenalidomide in 
humans cannot be ruled out.  Therefore, a risk minimization plan to prevent pregnancy must be 
observed.  
Criteria for females of childbearing potential (FCBP)  
This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a sexually mature woman who: 1) has 
not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 2) has not been naturally 
postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does no t rule out childbearing potential) 
for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 
consecutive months).  
Counseling  
For a female of childbearing potential, lenalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the following 
are met (i.e., all females of childbearing potential must be counseled concerning the following 
risks and requirements prior to t he start of lenalidomide ):  
• She understands the potential teratogenic risk to the unborn child  
• She understands the need for eff ective contraception, without interruption, 4 
weeks before starting study treatment, throughout the entire duration of study 
treatment, dose interruption and 28 days after the end of study treatment  
• She should be capable of complying with effective contrac eptive measures  
• She is informed and understands the potential consequences of pregnancy and the 
need to notify her study doctor immediately if there is a risk of pregnancy  
• She understands the need to commence the study treatment as soon as study drug 
is dispensed following a negative pregnancy test  
• She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing based on the 
frequency outlined in this proto col 
• She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions 
associated with the u se of lenalidomide  
108 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 The investigator must ensure that for females of childbearing potential:  
• Complies with the conditions for pregnancy risk minimization, including 
confirmation that she has an adequate level of understanding  
• Acknowledge the aforementioned requirements  
For a female NOT of childbearing potential, lenalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the 
following are met (i.e., all females NOT of childbearing potential must be counseled concerning 
the following risks and requirements prior to  the sta rt of lenalidomide ):  
• She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions 
associated with the use of lenalidomide  
Traces of lenalidomide have been found in semen.  Male patients taking lenalidomide must meet 
the following conditions  (i.e., all males must be counseled concerning the following risks and 
requirements prior to the sta rt of lenalidomide ): 
• Understand the potential teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a 
pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential  
• Understand the need for the use of a condom even if he has had a vasectomy, if 
engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing 
potential.   
Contraception  
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) enrolled in this protocol must ag ree to use two reliable 
forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual 
contact during the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at least 28 days before 
starting study drug; 2) while participating i n the study; 3) during dose interruptions; and 4) for at 
least 28 days after study treatment discontinuation.  
The two methods of reliable contraception must include one highly effective method and one 
additional effective (barrier) method. FCBP must be re ferred to a qualified provider of 
contraceptive methods if needed. The following are examples of highly effective and additional 
effective methods of contraception:    
• Highly effective methods:  
− Intrauterine device (IUD)  
− Hormonal (birth control pills, inject ions, implants)  
− Tubal ligation  
109 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 − Partner’s vasectomy  
• Additional effective methods:  
− Male condom  
− Diaphragm  
− Cervical Cap  
 
Implants and levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an increased risk 
of infection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. Prophylactic antibiotics 
should be considered particularly in patients with neutropenia.  
Pregnancy testing  
Medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 25  mIU/mL must be 
performed for females of childbeari ng potential, including females of childbearing potential who 
commit to complete abstinence, as outlined below.  
Before starting study drug  
Female Patients:  
FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests ( minimum sensitivity of 25  mIU/mL) prior to 
starting stu dy drug.  The first pregnancy test must be performed within 10 to 14 days prior to the 
start of study drug and the second pregnancy test must be performed within 24 hours prior to the 
start of study drug.  The patient may not receive study drug until the s tudy doctor has verified 
that the results of these pregnancy tests are negative.  
Male Patients : 
Must practice complete abstinence or  agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a 
pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while participati ng in the study, during 
dose interruptions and for at least 28 days following study drug discontinuation, even if he has 
undergone a successful vasectomy.   
During study participation and for 28 days following study drug discontinuation  
Female Patients:  
• FCBP with regular or no menstrual cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests 
weekly for the first 28 days of study participation and then every 28 days while on 
study, at study discontinuation, and at day 28 following study drug 
discontinuation. If menstrual  cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing must 
110 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 occur weekly for the first 28 days and then every 14 days while on study, at study 
discontinuation, and at days 14 and 28 following study drug discontinuation.   
• At each visit, the Investigator must confirm  with the FCBP that she is continuing 
to use two reliable methods of birth control.   
• Counseling about pregnancy precautions and the potential risks of fetal exposure 
must be conducted at a minimum of every 28 days.  
• If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy te st does occur in a study patient, study drug 
must be immediately discontinued.  
• Pregnancy testing and counseling must be performed if a patient misses her period 
or if her pregnancy test or her menstrual bl eeding is abnormal.  Study treatment 
must be discon tinued during this evaluation.  
• Females must agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and 
for at least 28 days after study drug discontinuation.  
Male Patients:  
Counseling about the requirement for complete abstinence or condom use duri ng sexual contact 
with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential and the potential  risks of fetal 
exposure to lenalidomide must be conducted at a minimum of every 28 days.   
• If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in the partner of a male study 
patient during study participation, the investigator must be notified immediately.  
Additional precautions  
• Patients should be instructed never to give this medicinal product to another 
person and to return any unused capsules to the study do ctor at the end of 
treatment.  
• Female patients should not donate blood during treatment  and for at least 28 days 
following discontinuation of lenalidomide . 
• Male patients should not donate blood, semen or sperm during treatment  or for at 
least 28 days follow ing discontinuation of lenalidomide . 
• Only enough study drug for 28 days or one cycle of therapy (whichever is shorter) 
may be dispensed with each cycle of therapy.

undergone a hysterectomy (the surgical removal of the uterus) or bilateral 
oophorectomy (the surgical removal of both ovaries) or 2) has not been naturally 
postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out 
childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at 
any time during the preceding 24 consecutive months)  
□ NOT FCBP  
Male:  □ 
 
Do Not Dispense study drug if:  
• The patient is pregnant.  
• No pregnancy tests were conducted for a FCBP.  
• The patient states she did not use TWO reliable methods of birth control (unless 
practicing complete abstinence of heterosexual contact) [at least 28 days prior to 
treatment , during treatment  and during dose interruption].  
FCBP:  
1. I verified that the required pregnancy tests performed are negative.

UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 2. I counseled FCBP regarding the following:  
• Potential risk of fetal exposure to lenalidomide:  If lenalidomide is taken during 
pregnancy, it may  cause birth defects or death to any unborn baby.  Females are 
advised to avoid pregnancy while taking lenalidomide. The teratogenic potential of 
lenalidomide in humans cannot be ruled out.  FCBP must agree not to become 
pregnant while taking lenalidomide.   
• Using TWO reliable methods of birth control at the same time or complete abstinence 
from heterosexual contact [at least 28 days prior to treatment , during treatment , 
during dose interruption and 28 days after discontinuation of lenalidomide ]. 
• That even i f she has amenorrhea she must comply with advice on contraception   
• Use of one highly effective method and one additional method of birth control AT 
THE SAME TIME. The following are examples of highly effective and additional 
effective methods of contracep tion:   
− Highly effective methods:  
o Intrauterine device (IUD)  
o Hormonal (birth control pills, injections, implants)  
o Tubal ligation  
o Partner’s vasectomy  
− Additional effective methods:  
o Male condom  
o Diaphragm  
o Cervical Cap  
• Pregnancy tests before , during , and after  treatment, even if the patient agrees not to 
have reproductive heterosexual contact.  Two pregnancy tests will be performed prior 
to receiving study drug, one within 10 to 14 days and the second within 24 hours of 
the start of study drug.  
• Frequency of pregn ancy tests to be done:  
− Every week  during the first 28 days of this study and a pregnancy test every 28 
days during the patient’s participation in this study if menstrual cycles are regular 
or every 14 days  if cycles are irregular.    
113

 APPENDIX J  
Lenalidomide Information Sheet  
FOR SUBJECTS  ENROLLED IN CLINICAL RESEARCH STUDIES  
Please read this Lenalidomide Information Sheet before you start taking study drug and each 
time you get a new supply. This Lenalidomi de Information Sheet does not take the place of an 
informed consent to participate in clinical research or talking to your study doctor or healthcare 
provider about your medical condition or your treatment.    
What is the most important information I should  know about lenalidomide?  
8. Lenalidomide may cause birth defects (deformed babies) or death of an unborn 
baby.  Lenalidomide is similar to the medicine thalidomide. It is known that thalidomide 
causes life -threatening birth defects. Lenalidomide has not been tested in pregnant 
women but may also cause birth defects. Findings from a monkey study indicate that 
lenalidomide caused birth defects in the babies of female monkeys who received the drug 
during pregnancy . 
If you are a woman  who is able to become pregnan t: 
• Do not take study drug if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant  
• Either do not have sexual intercourse at all  or use two reliable, separate forms of 
effective birth control at the same time:  
− for 28 days before starting lenalidomide  
− while taking lenalidomide  
− during dose interruptions of lenalidomide  
− for 28 days after stopping lenalidomide  
• You must have pregnancy testing done at the following times:  
− within 10 to 14 days and again 24 hours prior to the first dose of lenalidomide  
− weekly for the first 2 8 days  
− every 28 days after the first month or every 14 days if you have irregular 
menstrual periods  
− if you miss your period or have unusual menstrual bleeding  
− 28 days after the last dose of lenalidomide  (14 and 28 days after the last dose if 
menstrual peri ods are irregular)  
116 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 • Stop taking study drug if you become pregnant during treatment  
− If you suspect you are pregnant at any time during the study, you must stop 
lenalidomide  immediately and immediately inform your study doctor. Your study 
doctor will report a ll cases of pregnancy to the National Cancer Institute and the 
pharmaceutical collaborator, Celgene Corporation .  
• Do not breastfeed while taking study drug  
• The study doctor will be able to advise you where to get additional advice on 
contraception.  
If you are a female not of childbearing potential:  
In order to ensure that an unborn baby is not exposed to lenalidomide, your study doctor 
will confirm that you are not able to become pregnant.  
If you are a man : 
Lenalidomide is detected in trace quantities in  human semen. The risk to the f etus in 
females of child bearing potential whose male partner is receiving lenalidomide is 
unknown at this time.   
• Men (including those who have  had a vasectomy) must either abstain from sexual 
intercourse or use a condom during  sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female 
that can become pregnant:  
− While you are taking lenalidomide  
− During dose interruptions of lenalidomide  
− For 28 days after you stop taking lenalidomide  
• Men  should not donate sperm or semen  while taking study drug and for 28 days 
after stopping lenalidomide .  
• If you suspect that your partner is pregnant any time during the study, you must 
immediately inform your study doctor. The study doctor will report all cases of 
pregnancy to the National Cancer Institute a nd the pharmaceutical collaborator, 
Celgene Corporation. Your partner should call their healthcare provider 
immediately if she gets pregnant.  
9. Restrictions in sharing  lenalidomide  and donating blood:  
• Do not share lenalidomide  with other people. It must be k ept out of the reach of 
children and should never be given to any other person.  
117 
UC IRB # 10 -182-B 
NCI # 8317  
Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 • Do not donate blood  while you take lenalidomide  and for 28 days after stopping 
study drug.  
• Do not break, chew, or open study drug capsules.  
• You will get no more than a 28 -day supply of lenalidomide at one time.  
• Return unused study drug capsules to your study doctor.  
Additional information is provided in the informed consent form and you can ask your

Version Date:    09/25/2019  
 INSTRUCTIONS TO THE SUBJECT: 1. Your blood pressure readings have two numbers.  The first number is the 
pressure in your blood vessels during a heart beat (systolic), and the second number is the pressure in the vessels when 
the heart rests in between beats (diastolic).  These numbers are usually written with a slash in between them (for 
example, normal blood pressure is 120/80). 2. Record the date, then record your blood pressure using a home blood 
pressure monitor.  You should c heck you blood pressure at least once a week for your first cycle but more often 
depending on your doctor’s instructions 3. If you take your blood pressure at other times of the day, please record the 
numbers and time under “Other readings.” 4. If your sys tolic pressure is greater than 150 or your diastolic blood 
pressure is greater than 90, repeat after several hours.  If it remains elevated, please contact your doctor’s office at 
_______________________________ for instructions. 5. Please bring this form to every clinic visit or appointment.

Procedure for Dosing Lenalidomide Via Gastrostomy Feeding Tube  
 
1) Obtain One (1) cup of HOT  water.  
 
2) Arrange the required articles for dose administration  
• One (1) clean 20cc disposable syringe with plunger rod.  
• One (1) clean 10cc disposable syringe with plunger rod.  
• One (1) 3 -way Stop Cock valve  
o 3-Way Stop Cock valve – Qosina Part # 99729  
o All Plastic Disposa ble Syringe 20mL capacity Luer Lock Syringe – 
National Scientific Target Part # 03 -377-24  
• One (1) adapter (for use from valve to tube)  
o Adapter – Qosina Part # 11519  
 
3) Using the 20CC syringe, place the luer -lock end in the cup of hot water and fill the 
syringe completely by pulling back on the plunger rod until it stops.  This syringe will 
be designated as the “RINSE SYRINGE.”  Set “RINSE SYRINGE” down and allow 
water to cool .   
 
4) Connect the 3 -way valve to the 10CC syringe via the luer -lock at the “C’ posit ion 
(luer -lock opposite the Fixed Male Luer leaving the second luer lock to the right @ 
the “B” position) (see Figure 1).   
 
5) Position the valve handle @ the “B” position (see Figure 1).   
 
6) Pull back on the plunger rod and remove the plunger rod from the syringe barrel.  
This will be the “DOSING SYRINGE.”  
 
7) Insert the required dose (capsules) into the barrel of the “DOSING SYRINGE.”  
 
8) Replace the plunger rod into the syringe ba rrel and slowly depress the plunger rod 
until it touches the capsules.  
 
9) Place the Fixed Luer (“A”) end of the valve into the cup of HOT  water and draw the 
plunger rod back filling the syringe with hot water until it stops (see Figure 1).   
 
10) Immediately position the valve handle to the “C” position (see Figure 1).  This 
will prevent any leakage from the syringe as the capsules begin to dissolve.  Note: a 
few drops may leak fr om the Fixed Luer end of the valve.  This will only be water 
downstream of the closed valve.  
  
11) Gently swirl the syringe to assist in the hot water dissolving the gelatin capsules.  
Verify that the capsules have dissolved and allow the solution to come to a  suitable 
temperature for dosing.  The temperature in the “RINSE SYRINGE” should be 
checked as well (warm to the touch on the exterior of the syringe body).  
 
122 
  
12) Once a suitable temperature (warm to the touch on the exterior of the syringe body) is 
reached and  the capsules appear dissolved, connect the “RINSE SYRINGE” to the 2nd 
luer-lock fitting on the 3 -way valve (Position “B”) (see Figure 1).   
 
13) Attach the adapter to the Fixed Male Luer end (position “A”) of the valv e (see Figure 
1).   
   
14) The daily dose is now ready to be administered (see Figure 2).   
 
15) Insert the adapter into the port on the Feeding Tube, making sure it is a tight fit  that 
will not allow leaking.  
 
16) Turn the valve handle on the 3 -way valve to the “B” position (see Figure 1).  Depress 
the plunger rod on the “DOSING  SYRINGE” until it stops.  
   
17) Turn the valve handle to the “A” posi tion (see Figure 1).  Gently pull back on the 
plunger rod of the “DOSING SYRINGE” allowing approximately 1/3 (7cc) of rinse 
water to enter the “DOSING SYRINGE” from the “RINSE SYRINGE.”  
   
18) Turn the 3 -way valve back  to the “B” position and depress the plunger rod on the 
“DOSING SYRINGE” until it stops (see Figure 1).  
 
19) Turn the valve handle to the “A” position (see Figure 1).  Gently pull back on the 
plunger rod of the “DOSING SYRINGE” allowing approximately 1/3 (7cc) of rinse 
water to enter the “DOSING SYRINGE” from the “RINSE SYRINGE.”  
 
20) Turn the 3 -way valve back to the “B” position and depress the plunger rod on the 
“DOSING SYRINGE” until it stops (see Figure 1).  
 
21) Turn the valve handle to the “A” position (see Figure 1).  Gently pull back on the 
plunger rod of the “DOSING SYRINGE” allowing the remaini ng rinse water to enter 
the “DOSING SYRINGE” from the “RINSE SYRINGE.”  
 
22) Turn the 3 -way valve back to the “B” position and depress the plunger rod on the 
“DOSING SYRINGE” until it stops (see Figure 1).  
 
23) Visually ve rify that the three (3) rinse steps have removed the entire dose from the 
“DOSING SYRINGE” and the Feeding Tube is clear.  If additional rinse water is 
needed remove the “RINSE SYRINGE” from the 3 -way valve.  Draw additional 
WARM  water into the syringe.  R econnect the “RINSE SYRINGE” to the 3 -way 
valve and repeat Steps #17 through #22 or until the “DOSING SYRINGE” and 
Feeding Tube are clear.  
        
24) Disconnect the adapter from the Feeding Tube, secure the port on the Feeding Tube.  
 
 
123 
 25) Dissemble the adapter, 3 -way Stop Cock Valve and both the “DOSING” and “RINSE 
SYRINGES”.  Thoroughly rinse all items in clean water and allow them to air dry 
before returning them to the storage container.

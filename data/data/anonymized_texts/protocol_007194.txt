Study Duration  7 months   
Study Center(s)  Single -center  
Objectives   
Our central hypothesis is that the attending nurse will enhance critical 
patient -centered elements of care that will in turn improve patient 
education and shared decision -making, medication adherence, stroke -
related health literacy, and reduce early readmissions to ultimately yield 
improved patient quality of life. Our primary objective is to determine 
whether the attending nurse model of care improves str oke patients’ 
health  at 7 days, 30 days , and 90 days  after hospital disc harge as 
assessed through  questionnaires .    
Number of 
Patients  372 patients

 Main Inclusion and 
Exclusion Criteria  We will include all adult patients admitted to the Vascular Neurology 
Service  with a clinical diagnosis of stroke, brain hemorrhage , or transient 
ischemic attack.  
 
 
We will exclude patients whose level of care is limited to comfort care or 
hospice, those with severe dementia prior to admission, and those who 
are both non -communicative and have no family or other social support.  
Investigational 
Product   
None  
This is a comparative effectiveness study comparing two models of 
nursing care delivery to stroke patients (attending nurse model vs. 
conventional inpatient  nursing care)   
Duration of 
administration (if 
applicable)  The dur ation of the intervention phase will depend on the duration of a 
patient ’s hospital admission . 
Reference therapy  The reference therapy is standard inpatient nursing  care. 
Statistical 
Methodology  Our primar y outcome will be scores on scales  of medication adheren ce 
and stroke education retention. The scores on these tests will be 
compared between patients who were assigned  to the attending nurse 
model of care versus standard nursing care .  
 
Seco ndary ou tcomes will include  comparisons between groups of  the 
thirty day readmission  rate, scores on a patient -centered stroke impact 
scale , 2 modified quality of life scale s, results of  a newly designed 
series of 13  Likert style questions , and a global statistic that includes the 
results of all sc ales.  
Safety Evaluations   
All enrolled patients will be evaluated via telephone interview  at 7, 30 , 
and 90  days  following hospital discharge  and screened for major 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events . While in the hospital, 
subject safety will be assured via already existent quality assurance 
mechanisms.  
Data and Safety 
Monitoring Plan   
The PIs  will be responsible for monitoring the data quality and the 
ongoing safety of patients .

 1   BACKGROUND AND STUDY  RATIONALE  
This document is a clinical research protocol and the described study will be conducted in compliance 
with the protocol , Good Cl inical Practice standards , associated federal regulations, and all applicable 
University of Pennsylvania Research Policies and Procedures and all applicable Federal and state laws 
and regulations . 
Introduction  
 
Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Hospital units dedicated to 
stroke care have been shown to improve patient outcomes compared to other units ,1 but the optimal 
models of care delivery within stroke units have not been well studied, particularly in a pa tient-centered 
context. We pro pose to study the role  of an attending nurse in the inpatient stroke unit  compared to  
standard nursing care . The attending nurse will serve as a continuous source of support for stroke 
patient s and families, communicate the  plan of care, and provide education.  
1.1 Background and Relevant Literature  
Every year, approximately 610,000 people experience a first stroke and another 185,000 have a recurrent 
stroke in the United States .2 Further, among 307,887 ischemic stroke patients in a Medicare database, 
14% we re readmitted to hospit als within 30 days of discharge.3 Stroke patients are thus a high risk 
population worthy of increased treatment interventions to prevent early complications. P atients  with 
recurrent stroke have poorer outcomes and higher healthcare costs than those with first stroke.4 Despite 
the substantial burden of recurrent stroke, many patients with pri or strokes are ill informed about stroke 
risk factors and have suboptimal personal health behaviors .5,6 Existing  care delivery models thus may  not 
optimally aligned with stroke patient s’ needs and goals.  
 
Poor adherence to prescribed medications following hospital discharge likely plays  an important role in 
stroke recurrence, disability, other complications, and death.7 In the largest observational study of 
medication compliance following stroke, the Adherence eValuation After Ischemic stroke –Longitudinal 
(AVAIL) registry, indep endent predictors of 1 -year medication persistence included fewer medications 
prescribed at discharge, having an adequate income, having an appointment with a provider, and a 
greater understanding of why medications were prescribed and possible  side effect s.8 Earlier studies 
have also noted that inadequate care transitions and poor patient –provider communications contribute to 
medication non -adheren ce.9 Unfortunately, no educational or organizational interventions have clearly 
been shown to eff ectively improve adherence to secondary stroke prevention strategies.10  
 
 
Attending Nurse  
 
The attending nurse model of in -hospital care delivery may work to improve patient understanding, 
shared decision -making, medication adherence,  and reduce early readmissions after discharge to 
ultimately yield improved patient quality of life. The care delivered and directed by the attending nurse will 
be guid ed by the principles of relationship based nursing developed by Koloroutis in which commitment to 
care and service to patients  hinges upon a therapeutic relationship.11 On the inpatient stroke unit, t he 
attending nurse will take ownership of essential aspects of an individual stroke patient’s care, education, 
and transition out of the hospital. By serving as the patient care coo rdinator, advocate, and educator, t he 
attending nurse will be able to creat e a deep and meaningful therapeutic relationship with patients.  To 
further contribute to the patient’s plan of care, t he attending nurse will be present on daily teaching 
rounds . 
 
Allowing nurses to function as attending nurses is in keeping with the dicta tes of the Institute of Medicine  
recommendation to have nurses practice to the full extent of their education and training as well as 
treating nurses as full partners in redesigning health care.12 Though an attending nurse has been studied 
in outpatient settings,12 this model of care has not been used extensively for inpatient care.13 Quantitative 
data for the effect of an attending nurse on inpatient care are lacking , but qualitative data suggest that 
8 
 attending nurses ameliorated shared decision making with patients, resulting in a more proactive, 
confident and informed relationship between patients and providers.13,14 Feedback from nursing staff and 
administrators after an attending nurse model was launched at other institutions revealed no negative 
consequences.13,14 To our knowledge, t he attending nurse model has not been studied in any disease -
specific inpatient population. Stroke is potentially an ideal disorder for this model of care because of its 
medical complexity, individual patient burden, and high early risk of recurrence, yet is amenable to  
aggressive preventative and rehabilitative measures.    
 
1.2 Name and Description of the Investigational Product  
There is no investigational product.  We are investigating which model of nursing care is most effective:  
the attending nurse model , as detailed a bove , or the standard care model . The tasks performed by the 
attending n urse for each patient will be documented during the patients’ hospitalization to assure 
individual patient goals are  being  met. Patients who receive care from the attending nurse will be 
compared to those who are cared for by staff nurses alone.  
1.2.1  Clinical Data to Date :  
For 3 -4 months, the attending nurse model has been in u se on the vascular Neurology inpatient service  
for some patients . No patient has ever refused care from the attending nurse and we have noticed no in-
house  complications from attending nurse  care as evaluated by standard quality metrics. Additionally, w e 
have piloted our survey instruments . The instruments take a media n of 15 minutes  to administer .  
 
Stroke readmissions at our institution over the past 2 years were estimated from the GWTG registry at our 
center. Our readmission rates (~10%) are lower than the national average (~15%) for stroke patients.  
 
2 Study Objectives  
2.1 Primary Objective  
 To determine whether patients report better understanding of stroke facts and medication 
adherence  when cared for by an attending nurse compared to routine nursing care. 
2.2 Secondary Objectives (if applicable)  
 To determine whether a nurse attending model of care improves overall outcome following 
stroke or TIA  
 To determine whether newly devised questions focused on the inpatient experience as well 
as patient satisfaction can detect valid differences between tre atment groups .  
 To assess whether an attending nurse improves patient  perception of deficits  and quality of 
life compared to routine nursing care. 
 To assess whether an attending nurse reduces pati ent readmission rates compared to 
standard nursing care. 
 
 
3 Investigational Plan  
3.1 General Design  
We propose a phase III comparative effectiveness study  to evaluate the added value of a n attending 
nurse to the inpatient care of stroke patients  compared to routine care . Both types of care are currently 
available on the inpatient Vascular Neurology service at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania a s 
well as a t other institutions. Currently , the nurse attending works ra ndomly with patient she selects based 
on her availability .  
 
9 
 In the standard mo del of inpatient  nursing  care, stroke education is provided largely in the form of 
pamphlets distributed to patients and their families. Patients are cared for by a team of physicians and 
staff nurses with access to social worker s and case managers, howeve r, staff nurses do not routinely 
round on their patients with other members of the care team.   
 
Screening of patients  for this trial  will occur once the clinical decision to admit a patient to the Vascular 
Neurology  service has been made . All patients who meet inclus ion criteria will be assigned to a study 
arm, addition of an attending nurse versus  routine  nursing care, according to  the day of the week they  are 
admitted to the hospital. Patients who are  admitted o n even  numbered week days will ha ve their care 
supplemented by the attending nurse. This is effectively a stratified random assignment, as there are no 
clinical or systematic features that otherwise are associated with odd or even numbered days.  The 
duration of the intervention will depen d on the duration of a patient’s hospital admission . 
 
To compare the  two models of nursing care, we will survey  all patients directly about the care they receive 
in the hospital  once they are discharged . Surveys  tools  designed to ascertain medication adherence, 
disease specific knowledge , as well as  satisfaction with care and hospital readmissions will be assessed 
at 7, 30, and 90 days via follow -up structured telephone interviews . We will consider the 7 day follow -up 
phone call the baseline assessment . The Morizky scale  (MMAS -4),15 a well validat ed tool that has been 
studied in stroke victims ,16 will be used to determine medication adherence . The Stroke Patient Education 
Retention (SPER )17 tool will be used to assess  patient knowledge. T he Stroke Impact Scale ( SIS)18 will be 
used to evaluate self -perception of stroke deficits  by patients . Thirteen  other survey questions designed 
specifically for this study will also be posed to patients at 7, 30 and 90 days from follow up  along with two 
overall quality of life questions at 7 and 90 days . As a secondary outcome, w e will calculate and then use  
a global statistic as a general marker for success to compare the effectiveness of each nursing care 
model  in improving patient s’ overall outcomes .19 All interviews will be performed by a trained research 
assistant who will not be involved in the inpatient care of patients and will be blinded to study  allocation. 
Subject participation will conclude after 90 days.  
 
We will request a waiver of consent for initial enrollment in this study. Follow -up calls to patients will 
explicitly state according to an IRB -approved script that the questio ns are part of a research study. 
Patients will a lso be asked if they consent to collection  of data from the ir medical record  as part of the 
study . Patients will have the o ption to participate or decline.  If they choose to participate  in the interview 
survey  and allow collection of data from their recent hospitalization,  then the study will proc eed with their 
verbal consent.  
 
If they decline to participate  in the interview survey, then no further study specific tools will be used , but 
they will be asked if  they consent to  chart abstract ion. However, patients cannot participate in interviews 
without agreeing to data collection. Patients can decline to participate in both the interviews and allow for 
data collection. If they fully decline  to participate  in the study , their data will be expunged and no further 
data collected.   
3.1.1  Screening Phase  
Patients  will be screened upon admission to the Vascular Neurology non -intensive care unit service. A s 
part of standard intake procedures, a physician on the admitting team will determine patient study 
eligibility.  There will be no extra evaluations or laboratory tests needed at the screening visit.   
 
As this is a comparison of two effective nursing models, both of which are available and employed in 
clinical practice, the study is of minimal risk to patients . All patients will receive a standard treatment 
currently in use at our facility. Patients  may be unaware of our ongoing  comparative effectiveness trial  
while they are hospitalized. However, informed consent will be obtained at the time of fol low up phone 
calls.  
3.1.2  Study Intervention Phase  
All of the sta ndard medical  care will be identical in both arms of the study. Health literacy will be assessed 
in all patients  upon admission to assure  educational interventions are directed accordingly. Patients  who 
10 
 are assigned to standard nursing care will receive st andard care which includes educational interventions 
from staff nurses in keeping with current Joint commission and AHA/ASA guidelines  Patients  assigned to 
routine care will not interact with the attending nurse. Patients  who are assigned  to the intervention will 
receive additional patient -centered supplementary care and education from the attending nurse.  
 
3.1.2   Follow Up Phase  
Patients  will be followed for a total of 90 days following discharge  from the hospital . Patients  will be 
contacted at 7 , 30, and 90 days following discharge  via telephone  call. When patients  are unable to 
communicate their own views due to aphasia or other disability, caregivers will be asked to answer the 
applicable survey questions.  
3.1.3  Allocation to Interventional Group  
Stroke patients who are admitted on even -numbered weekd ays and enrolled in this trial will be assigned 
to care with an attending nurse; patients  admitted on odd -numbered weekdays w ill get usual routine care. 
The attending nurse will query the electronic medical record as well as communicate with the physician 
team so that all incoming admissions on even -numbered days  to the Vascular Neurology  service  are 
known to the attending nurse.  
 
3.2 Study Endpoints  
3.2.1  Primary Study Endpoints  
- Primary endpoints will be stroke education retention as measured by the SPER and medication 
adherence as measured by MMAS -4 as these are the areas where we anticipate the largest 
potential effect of the nurse atten ding. The mean scores on these two tests will be compared 
between groups at each time interval that they are administered.  
3.2.2  Secondary Study Endpoints  
- We will compare the results of the newly designed survey questionnaire to capture patient 
impression  of their in -hospital care, transition home, and quality of life .  
- The results of the SIS will be captured at 30 days and compared between groups.  
- The proportion o f patients with readmissions within 30 days will be compared  between g roups  at 
30 days.  
- A global statistic  that incorporates all survey measures to determine whether the attending nurse 
model of care is consistent ly and persuasively more effective than routine nursing care  will be 
compared between groups.  
 
3.2.3  Primary Safety Endpoint s [if applicable]  
As this is a comparative  effectiveness  study of two models of nursing care that are currently both in use 
so there are no safety endpoints.  Safety  data will be collected during patients in hospital stay in keeping 
with current quality control process.   
4 Study Population and Duration of Participation  
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
 
 > 18 years of age  
 Admission to the  Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania Vascular Neurology  service  
 Incident or recurrent:  
o Ischemic stroke : focal neurological deficit of likely ischemic vascular origin  
o Intracerebral hemorrhage : blood  seen  on initial head CT  
11 
 o Transient Ischemic attack: focal neurological deficit of likely isch emic vascular origin 
that has  clinically  resolved  
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 Pregnancy  
 Comfort or hospice  care 
 Severe dementia prior to stroke  
 Non-communicative and have no family/social support   
4.3 Subject Recruitment  
Patients  will not be formally recruited for this study, but instead enrolled upon admi ssion to the Vascular 
Neurology inpatient service . 
4.4 Duration of Study Participation  
For each subject , the study intervention phase  will vary as this phase will depend  on the durat ion of each 
individual inpatient adm ission. The follow up time period will extend to 90 days a fter discharge for all 
patients.    
4.5 Total Number of Patients  and Sites  
The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania will be our only enrollment site. We plan to enroll 180 
patients  in each arm of the trial. At this site, there are approximately 700 -800 stroke patients admitted per 
year, so we anticipate recruitment will require approximately 7 months.  
4.6 Vulnerable Populations:  
 Children, pregnant women, fetuses, neonates, or prisoners are not i ncluded in this research study.  
5 Study Intervention (Study drug, device, biologic, vaccine, food etc.)  
There is no  investigational product for this trial as it is a comparative effectiveness study designed to 
determine whether an attendin g nurse or standard nursing care improves outcomes for  stoke patients. .  
5.1 Description  
The Attend ing Nurse will meet patients and their families within the first 24 hours of their admission to 
begin the integrated care process and follow them until discharge. If assigned to the attending nurse 
model, patients will be followed by her if they are transferred to another service or unit rather than drop 
out of the study.  The attending nurse will record the tasks she completes with each patient and the time 
each task required. This record will then become a part of the patient’s medical record . 
 
The Attending Nurse will have, in addition to a BSN and RN, at least 5 years of experience managing 
stroke an d other neuroscience patients at the Hospita l of the University of Pennsyl vania. Additionally, she 
will also have trainin g specific to the role of attending n urse through mentorship by nurses who currently 
work in this role at our institutions and at other institutions .  
   
5.2 Intervention Regimen  
The attending nurse  will spend 30 minutes to 45 minutes upon initial eval uation t o determine the patient s’ 
goals , barriers,  and needs. The amount of time spent with each subject following the initial visit will vary 
based on the patient . To limit the demands on the attending nurse, she will never carry a case load of 
more than 8 patients at a single time. If on an even -numbered weekday the attending nurse has 8 
patients, than the subject will be assigned to the routine care arm of the trial. Patients  who are assigned 
to the attending nurse model of care will be seen by that nurse on a daily (weekday) basis in addition to 
being cared for by their regular care team of physicians and rotating staff nurses.  All staff nurses as well 
12 
 as the attending nurse will participate in morning interdisciplinary table rounds in keeping with preexistent 
quality processes.  
 
5.3 Blinding  
The 7, 30, and 90 phone surveys will be blinded to patients ’ group assignment. Staff nurses will not be 
blinded as to which patient the attending nurse is caring for. T he PIs will not be blinded to subject 
treatment assignment as they will need to assure subject assignment is preformed correctly.  Patients  will 
not be formally blinded to their arm assignment, though patients  may not realize that alternative model s of 
care exist  on the Vascular Neurology  service.  Waiving consent upon admission will help maintain 
patient s’ blinding. During  the first  follow up phone call , as part of the consenting proc ess, we will specify 
that we are comparing different nursing styles of care.  The interviewer preforming follow up phone calls 
and collecting  data from the patient electronic medical record  will be blinded to study group assignment.  
5.4 Administration and Acco untability    
The survey questionnaires  will be administ ered by trained staff that will be blinded to group assignment . 
Responses will be inputted by a study coordinator into a secure electronic database . All data will be 
monitored periodically to assure accuracy.  
 
Patients  will be assigned case numb ers at the time of enrollment . The key explaining the linkage between 
patients ’ PHI and case number will be kept in another password protected computer so that  each 
patients ’ PHI is well protected . Surveys responders will be identified via a case assignment number. 
Subject responses will be recorded on a standard form that will be kept on a password protected 
computer during the study period. Any clinical data that is abstract from the electronic medical record  for 
each patient will also be recorded in a standard form which identifies patients  only by their case numbers.  
5.5 Subject Compliance Monitoring  
Patients  will be called at 7, 30 , and 90 days  following discha rge to evaluate their response to the 
questionnaires. Incomplete response at 7 days  will not preclude a phone call directed to patients  at 30 
and 90 days. Patients  who are not reachable via phone interview will not undergo an analysis of their 
clinical data due to lack of consent.   
5.5.1  Return or Destruction of Investigational Product  
Completion of data collection will occur when all patients enrolled in the study have completed the study 
and are  greater than 90 days from discharge. All response data as well as clinical data will be destroyed 
after data analysis . Study completion will be defined as completion of the analysis.  
 
6 Study Procedures  
At follow up phone call s, interviews will be conducted with results of questionnaires recorded after 
consent is obtai ned. Consent for abstraction of clinical data collected during routine care from the 
electronic medical record will also be obtained.

6.1 Screening  
Patients  will be screened for trial enrollment upon arrival to the floor. All of the below are obtained at 
admission for all patients as part of standard of care procedures.  
 Physical Exam  including mental status evaluation (standard of care )   
 Diagnosis (standard of care)  
 Baseline functional status (standard of care)  
 
6.2 Study Intervention Phase  
If patients satisfy inclusion criteria and lack exclusion criteria they will be assigned  to the intervention arm 
or the control arm depending on their admission date. The intervention phase will be the duration of the 
patient ’s hospital stay .  
 
No research related procedures that differ from standard of care will be conducted as this is a 
comparative effectiveness trial.  
 
6.3 Follow Up Phase of the Study  
 
14 
 Follow -up visits will be conducted by telephone  only. Informed c onsent for phone interviews will be 
obtained prior to the interview . Consent will also be obtained for data collection from the p atients Hospital 
of the University of Pennsylvania electronic medical record. Whether the patient, a family member, or 
other person is answering the  pertinent survey questions will be recorded.  Patients may become fatigued 
when answering the survey  questions in which case they can simply ask to stop and the phone 
conversation  will end.   
 
6.3.1  7 days following discharge  
 
At 7 day s after hospital discharge , the MMAS -4, SPER, the exploratory 1 3 Likert -style questions  and two 
modified overall health questions  will be administered . There are no well validated surveys regarding the 
inpatient experience that are patient centered and stroke specific  so we designed 13 questions which 
focus on subject’s perception of their inpatient stay as well questions designed to assess qua lity of life  
following stroke . The newly devised Likert -style questions as well as the 2 modified overall quality of 
health questions have been reviewed by a stroke -survivor i n her role as patient advocate who was cared 
for at our institution . The single health literacy question will also be repeated at the 7 day follow up visit 
and interviewees  will be asked about readmission.  Though ideally patients will answer all survey 
questions  themselves , responses to survey questions will be accepted  from a legal representative 
provided they can answer accurately. Each interviewee will be identified based on their relationship to the 
patient  on survey collection forms . 
6.3.2  30 days following discharge  
 
At 30 days following hospital discharge, the SIS  and the MMAS -4 will be administered . Inquiry as to 
whether or not the patient  has been readmitted will occur.  
6.3.3  90 days following discharge  
 
At 90 days following hospital discharge, t he MMAS -4, SPER, the exploratory 1 3 Likert -style questions 
and the 2 modified global quality of health questions  will be administered  again . Patients  will also be 
asked about any readmission s. 
6.4 Unscheduled Visits  
Clinic visits and other unscheduled visits will not replace phone interviews and will be entirely separate 
from this study.   
6.5 Subject Withdrawal  
Patients  may withdraw from the study at any tim e without impact to their care . Patients  may also be 
discontinue d from the study at the discretion of the PIs  for lack of adherence to intervention or study 
procedures or difficul ty obtaining follow up or unexpected events . The PI may also withdraw patients  who 
violate the study plan, or to protect the subject for r easons of safety or for administrative reaso ns. It will 
be documented whether or not eac h subject completes the  study.  
 
6.5.1  Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Patients  
If patients  decide to stop participating in inpatient care when recommended  by the treating t eam,  
documentation for patient decisions against medical advice ( AMA ), this will be documented  in keeping 
with standard practice. Follow up phone calls will still be sought on patients who leave AMA. Patients who  
are lost to follow up or decline  to participate in follow up phone calls  and do not consent to data 
abstraction from the inpatient record  will not have any further data collected.  
 
Patients who request to be removed from the study will have all available data expunged.  
15 
 6.6 Early Term ination Visits   
We will not perform  early termination visits or early phone calls .  
7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for this stud y will be a comparison of the mean scores on the SPER and the rate of 
adherence on the MM AS-4 (score < 2) and the SPER between groups  at 7 and again at 90 days.  
 
Scores on the MMAS -4 and SPER will be calculated per protocol. On the MMAS -4, affirmative answers 
will receive a point and negative answers will be assigned zero. The total score will be the sum of the 
answer to all four questions. The SPER, question 1 and 2 are scored as follows: 0  = no correct content in 
response to the question, 1= the patient provided some but not all of the correct content in r esponse to 
the question, and 2 = patient provided  all key content in response to th e question. Question 3 -5 were 
scored as follows as 0 =  no correct content in response to the question and 2  = the patient provided the 
correct response to the questions. A score of 10 indicates all correct responses to the  key content.  
 
The SIS is a patient -based, self -report scale in which each item is rated in a 5 - point Likert scale in terms 
of the difficulty the patient has experienced in completing each item. A score of 1 = an inability to 
complete the item and a score  of 5 = no difficulty experienced at all. Using an algorithm, summative 
scores are generated for each domain.  
 
7.2 Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints for this stud y are the  SIS at 30 days, newly devised patient centered outcome 
survey scales at 7 and  90 days, as well as hospital readmission at 30 days in each group.  
 
The SIS is a patient -based, self -report scale in which each item is rated in a 5 - point Likert scale in terms 
of the difficulty the patient has experienced in completing each item. A sco re of 1 = an inability to 
complete the item and a score of 5 = no difficulty experienced at all. Using an algorithm, summative 
scores are generated for each domain. The SIS is scored in the following way, for each domain: 
Transformed Scale = [(Actual raw s core - lowest possible raw score) / Possible raw score range] x 100.  
 
The newly devised  13 Likert -questions are all scaled 1 to 5 with 1=strongly disagree and 5 = strongly 
agree . We have also included two modified  global  quality of health  questions based on  the EuroQol 
instrument where scales range from 1 to 100 and are described in the stem of the question.20 Scores on  
each set of quest ions will be added together to compute a total score that can be compared between 
groups. The overall quality of health questions have scales ranging from 1 to 100 and are described in the 
stem of the question. Scores on these two questions will be compared between the two groups. These 
newly devised survey tools  were reviewed by a stroke patient representative  to assure relevance .  
 
We will likely be underpowered to detect differences i n readmission rates between the two groups, given 
the aforementioned currently low rates of readmission here. However, given the high clinical relevance of 
readmission we will evaluate this as a secondary outcome in our study.  
  
7.3 Sample Size and Power Determination  
 
For this pilot project, we anticipate that 65% of patients  in the control arm will be adherent to medications 
(MMAS -4 < 2) based on literature reporting 60%16 adherence as evaluated using these scales in stroke 
patients and 70%21 adherence in patients with hypertension. To achieve success on the primary endpoint , 
we estimate that patients must improve to by 15% in order to make this intervention worthy of f uture 
investigation in a larger study. Assuming an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80%, with a 1:1 assignment to 
each arm , we will require 186 patients  in each arm for a total of 372 patients . With that number of patients  
16 
 we will be able to powered to detect a very small difference of 0.3 (delta = .15 (SD=2)) in the mean scores 
of the SPER based on the published data.17 Each outcome will be evaluated independently so that we will 
not need to make any power readjustments. Readmission rates at 30 days are typical ly low4 and likely 
lower at our institution based on prior d ata so we will be underpowered for this outcome. Clinically 
difference s on the SIS will depend on the initial stroke severity of patients within each group and therefore 
the study cannot be powered for this secondary endpoint.  
7.4 Statistical Methods  
In our primary analysis, w e will first compare baseline demographics between groups. For our results 
section, we will compare all patients in the  control group to all patients in the intervention arm  for 
outcomes.  Mean scores on the SPER will be compared between groups using student t -tests . We will 
compare proportions of a dherent patients  on the MMSA -4 between groups using the Pearson chi -square 
test. Total scores on the SIS , quality of life questions,  and the 1 3 newly devised questions will be 
compared between g roups using t -tests .  
7.4.1  Baseline Data  
Baseline and demographic characteristics will be summarized by standard descriptive statistics (including 
mean and standard deviation for continuous variables such as age and standard percentages for 
categorical variabl es such as gender).  Stroke severity and PMH will also be collected and compared 
between the groups.  
7.4.2  Efficacy Analysis  
Our efficacy endpoint is the same as our primary endpoints  as this is a comparative effectiveness study . 
 
7.4.3  Safety Analysis  
Given that we  are comparing two models  of nursing  care, safety  of subjects  will be tracked via the general 
quality controls already in place for inpatient safety. There are no unique safety outcomes for this trial.   
 
7.5 Subject Population(s) for Analysis  
The entire subject population who undergo treatment assignment will be studied primarily via intention to 
treat analysis comparing data from follow up phone calls between groups. An as -treated analysis will also 
be performed .  
 
Analysis will be p erformed on some pre-defined subgroups  where we may expect to see effect 
modification: m ajor stroke  vs. minor strokes  (NIHSS ≤ 5), multiple medications vs. few medications, 
patients who were admitted fol lowing a recurrent stroke v s. a new stroke , and hemorrhagic stroke vs. 
ischemic stroke  subtypes .   
 
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
This protocol is extremely low risk as it assigns patients to already existent forms of inpatient care.  This 
study does not include any experimental treatment. Given there is no proposed intervention or proposed 
management beyond two existing forms o f standard clinical care, the routine collection of adverse events 
is not relevant, as those will be part of routine care.   However, there may be a difference between the two 
arms in terms of specific events of interest.   These specific events of interest i nclude falls, aspiration 
pneumonia, and subsequent (post -discharge) major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) 
including stroke (ischemic, hemorrhagic, or unknown), myocardial infarction, and death of any 
cause.  Transfers to a higher level of care (e.g. to the Neuro ICU or medical ICU from the floor) that occur 
as part of routine care will also be considered events of interest. We will also report any unanticipated 
events.    
 
17 
 All of the aforementioned events of particular interest will be asses sed while the subject is in the hospital 
in keeping with standard clinical care. During follow up phone calls, the interviewee will ask patients 
and/or their family members specifically a bout the occurrence of MACCEs including and death of any 
caus e.  
 
 The safety of each mode of nursing care while the subject is in -house will be tracked using the quality 
control processes that are already in place as part of standard inpatient care.  
 
9 Study Administration, Data Handling and Record Keeping  
9.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study patients  will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accou ntability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  
9.2 Data Collection and Management  
Data  will be abstracted regarding d emographics,  medical/surgical history, stroke location, and dates of 
hospital stay . The results of follow -up pho ne calls will be recorded by the interviewer and directly inputted  
into the RedCap database. The database will be kept in RedCap prior to data cleaning. Hard copies of 
survey results will be kept in locked file cabinets.  
 
Data will be managed and stored using REDCap, the software toolset and workflow methodology for 
electronic collection and management of research data,  developed  specifically around HIPAA -Security 
guidelines. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web -based application that is 
flexible enough to be used for a variety of types of research. REDCap provides an intuitive user interface 
that streamlines project development and i mproves data entry through real -time validation rules (with 
automated data type and range checks). REDCap also provides easy data manipulation (with audit trails 
for reporting, monitoring and querying patient records) and an automated export mechanism to c ommon 
statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R/S -Plus). In addition to traditional data capture functionality, 
REDCap’s survey capabilities are a powerful tool for building and managing online surveys. The research 
team can create and design surveys in a web browser and engage potential respondents using a variety 
of notification methods. All data collection projects rely on a thorough, study -specific data dictionary, 
defined by all members of the research team in an iterative, self -documenting process. Th is iterative 
development and testing process results in a well -planned and individualized data collection strategy.  
The REDCap MySQL database is replicated in real time to a completely redundant instance of 
MySQL.   The redundant instance is available for r estoration of the primary database or for manual 
failover in the cas e of primary database failure.  Time -stamped backup files are made from the replicated 
database daily by HUP Research Information Systems using automated backup routines.      
  
Data and bac kups are stored in the HUP Research Information Systems Storage Area Network 
(SAN).   Access to the SAN directories where data are stored will be limited to Research Information 
Systems personnel, with authentication performed using HUP’s enterprise Active Directory service. De-
identified d ata will be analyzed using STATA  or SPSS .  
 
The data that is collected will have a unique code assigned by the investigator  when it is acquired  to code 
each subject at the time of data harvesting to ensure duplicate data i s not collected and PHI is protected. 
This unique case number will not be possible to link to any other information pertaining to each subject. 
By doing this, the patients ’ privacy will be protected. Patients ’ names and medical record numbers will be 
coded  and kept separately from the database in a password protect ed file.  The PI will ensure that data is 
coded correctly so that PHI is protected.  
 
18 
 All data will be maintained on a password protected computerized database on a computer that will have 
a prote cted login. No data in the database will contain PHI as each subject will have been assigned a 
unique code at the time of data acquisition. The coded identifiers list will be stored in a password 
protected file separate from the main database in a computer  that requires a unique university ID to 
access.  
  
Only the PIs and the clinical research team will have access to the database. Only the PIs will have 
access to the coded identifier list so as to minimize the risk of a confidentiality breach.  Confidentia lity of 
the data will be ensured for as long as it is kept.  
 
9.3 Records Retention  
Any p atient data will be held only until data analysis is complete . Once data is no longer needed for 
research, it will be electronically destroyed in a way that leaves no trace. Both the coded -identifiers list as 
well as t he data set will be destroyed.  
 
10 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
Results of follow up phone calls will be discussed with the PIs on a weekly basis.  The PI will review all 
data that is collected via REDCap.  Data will be collected over the course of 6 months, cleaned for a 
month and analyzed for another month. The Investigator will also ensure that the monitor or other 
compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given access to all the above noted study -related documents 
and has adequate space to conduct the monitoring visit.  
 
10.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by the EC/IRB, the sponsor, 
government regulatory  bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study 
related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data 
etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of appl icable study -related facilities .  
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by government 
regulatory authorities and applicable University compliance and quality assurance offices.  
11 Ethical Considerations  
This study is to be conducted in accordance with applicable US government regulations and international 
standards of Good Clinical Practice, and applicable institutional research policies and procedures.  
 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted independent Ethics 
Committee (EC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal 
approval of the study conduct.  The decision of the EC/IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be 
made in writing to the investigator and a copy of this decision will be provided to the sponsor before 
commencement of this study.  
 
11.1 Risks  
The major risk of this study is a breach in PHI. Data will be protected as detailed above to avoid the 
damaging effects of a PHI breech. If patients or their family find follow up interview questionnaires  too 
burdensome  or psychologically straining during phone interviews , they can simply stop a nswering them.  
 
19 
 11.2 Benefits  
The potential benefit  of this comparative effectiveness study is improved inpatient care  for stroke 
patients —an area that is not well understood . Regardless of whether or not the individual patients ’ 
benefits f rom care, gaining knowledge about the best modality of inpatient nursing care for stroke patients 
will help society as a whole in the future.  
 
11.3 Risk Benefit Assessment  
The potential societal and individual benefits of this  study  out way the minor risks. This study is low risk as 
both the standard model of inpatient  nursing  care as well as the nurse attending model of care are 
currently used in clinical practice; we are merely comparing the effectiveness of one to the other. The 
risks of breach of PHI will be guarded against by use of de -identified data, a secure data collection and 
storage plan, as well as good clinical practices. The risk of emotional stres s associated with survey 
questions is also minimal as patients can simply refuse or stop answering these questions.  
 
11.4 Informed Consent Process / HIPAA Authorization  
A waiver of consent will be obtained for the initial intervention  as detailed below. We will obtain  informed 
consent using a verbal process, detailed below,  for data abstraction from the medi cal record as well as 
follow up phone questionnaires at the 7 day phone call. We will thus request a waiver of written consent.  
 
Consent will be obtained by the interviewer administering the questionnaires to the patient following 
verbatim a script approved by the IRB. Consent for all follow up phone surveys as well as chart 
abstraction from the inpatie nt stay will be obtained at th e 7 day phone call . The consent process will take 
place over the phone. Subject privacy will be assured as all data will be stored securely  and interviews 
will be conducted in private space .  
 
Patients  will be permitted to provide consent at the time of th e consent discussion over the phone (e .g. 
verbal consent) given the low risks associ ated with this study. Patients  can ask the interviewer  to call 
back at a later time to avoid an y coercion associated with time pressures. The subject will be informed 
that  they can withdraw their consent at any point. Investigators will confirm that the patient  understands  
the study by asking them if they have any questions or need any points clarified in keeping with the phone 
call transcript . 
 
Documentati on of informed consent  (e.g. date and time, who obtained consent, who gave consent and 
subject ID number)  will be made by the interviewer on the case report form as consent will be verbal. If 
the subject is unable to provide consent, their legally authoriz ed representative may.  
 
11.4.1  Alterations to Typical Consent Process (only include if applicable)  
11.4.1.1  Waiver of Consent (In some cases for screening/portions of that study that qualify as 
minimal risk, a waiver of documentation of consent may be permissible  per IRB SOP s) 
The research involves no more than minimal risk to the patients  as this is a comparative effectiveness trial 
of two modalities of inpatient care that are already  in use at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. 
Medical care itself will b e no different between the two study groups . A major goal of this study is 
assessment of each individual patient’s (and family’s) perception of their care and their clinical outcomes. 
If patients  or their family members  know that they did or did not receiv e an attending nurse  model of care , 
knowledge of that fact alone may bias their expectations and their satisfaction with their care. Blinded 
allocation is  essential for unbiased assessment. T he risk of patients  not initially consenting or knowing 
that we are comparing the effects of two nursing modalities is minimal. It would be impractical to carry out 
this research without an initial waiver of consent.  
 
After discharge from the hospital, all subjects will receive a 7 day follow up phone call.  At that tim e, they  
will be provided with additional pertinent information, including the fact that they received one of two 
20 
 mode s of nursing care whose effectiveness we are comparing. At this follow up phone call  subjects will 
be asked if they are willing to proceed  with the administration of research -specific questionnaires and the 
abstraction of clinical information recorded in the medical record , and a verbal informed consent script will 
be employed . There will be no more than minimal risk for continued participation, which at this point will 
be limited to the collection of PHI as well as with the administration of surveys . If the patient consents, 
then the protocol will continue as outlined.  For patients who do  not consent to the questionnaires, they 
will be asked if they would consent to review of medical records alone. For patients who do not consent to 
either, no further research will occur.  
 
Study  subject s who agree to ongoing participation  will be identified by a subject ID number for the 
questionnaires. This ID will be linked to their name and medical record number to allow for medical record 
data collection, and this linkage document will be password protected through REDCap and and 
destroyed when the study is completed.    
 
11.4.1.2  Waiver of Written Documentation of Consent  
 
There are  no scheduled in-person follow up  visits for our subjects, therefore  obtaining a signed consent 
form would be impractical.  We will obtain verbal consent as discussed above according to a prespecified 
script.  
 
11.4.1.3  Waiver of HIPAA Authorization  
 
We will ask for a HIPAA waiver for the screening stage of this study, but obtain verbal consent as 
discussed above to administer questionnaires as well as to collect data from the medical record.  
 
12 Study Finances  
12.1 Funding Source  
The study is not funded , but will be supported on an  as needed basis by the Stroke Team.   
12.2 Conflict of Interest  
All University of Pennsylvania Investigators will follow the University of Pennsylvania Policy on Conflicts of 
Interest Related to Research .  
12.3 Subject Stipends or Payments  
There is no subject stipend/payment .  
13 Publication Plan  
All publications will be reviewed by the PIs. Data publication will not depend on whether the trial is 
positive or negative. Approval from the PIs must be obtained before any information can be used or 
passed on to a third party.

DOCUMENT HISTORY
Document Date of Issue Overall Rationale
Amendment 01 10-AUG- 2023 The original protocol was amended to change 
the collection of dialysate samples from spot 
collections to interval collections, in an effort to 
align with standard practice.
Original Protocol 17-MAY -2023 Not applicable
PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY OF CHANGES
Amendment: 01
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:
This protocol was amended to change spot collections for dialysate samples to interval 
collections .
Summary of Changes Table
Section Number 
and Name Description of Change Brief Rationale
Primary Reason for Amendment
Section 1. 3, 
Schedule of 
Activities for 
Panel CUpdated original footnote ‘j’, now footnote ‘h’,
to reflect that the Dialysate Samples for MK -
0616 and/or Metabolites Assay are to be 
collected at the end of every 30 -minute interval 
from the start of hemodialysis until immediately 
before completion of hemodialysis.This change was made to address 
investigator/site feedback: It is understood that 
the collection of dialysate samples is typically an 
interval collection, rather than a spot collection, 
therefore, this update was made to comply with 
standard practice.
Section Number 
and Name Description of Change Brief Rationale
Additional Changes
Section 1. 3, 
Sche dule of 
Activities for 
Panels A, B, and DAll reference sto BDS/UDS w erechanged to 
Drug ScreenTo allow flexibility for sites to conduct a drug 
screen that is in alignment with their standard 
practice , given the participant population
Section 1.3, 
Schedule of 
Activities for 
Panels A, B, and DModified original footnote ‘g’, now footnote 
‘e’To emphasize that the Day 1 Predose Scheduled 
Time is the only timepoint when triplicate 
semirecumbent VS (HR, BP) and 12 -lead ECGs 
are taken
Section 1.3,

Section Number 
and Name Description of Change Brief Rationale
Section 1.3, 
Schedule of 
Activities for Panel 
CRemoved Screening Visit 2 This visit isno longer necessary, given the 
removal of the need to calculate baseline eGFR 
value sfor participants in Panel C
Section 1.3, 
Schedule of 
Activities for Panel 
CRemove d original footnotes ‘b’ and ‘c’; 
Footnotes ‘d’ through ‘k’ are now ‘b’ through 
‘i’Thesefootnotes areno longer necessary, given 
the removal of the need to calculate baseline
eGFR value sfor participants in Panel C
Section 1.3, 
Schedule of 
Activities fo r Panel 
CRemoved ‘(ie, ~8 am in both periods) ’from 
notesfor Study Intervention AdministrationTo allow flexibility for sites regarding timing of 
study drug administration
Section 1.3, 
Schedule of 
Activities for Panel 
CUpdates were made to the notes for both ‘On -
site HD’ entries (ie, Period 1 only and Period 2 
only)To reflect the fact that the length and timing of 
hemodialysis sessions varies from participant to 
participant and from session to session but 
needs to last a minimum of 3 hours
Section 1.3, 
Schedule of 
Activities for Panel 
CAll reference sto BDS/UDS w erechanged to 
Drug ScreenTo allow flexibility for sites to conduct a drug 
screen that is in alignment with standard 
practice, given the participant populatio n
Section 1 .3, 
Schedule of 
Activities for Panel 
CSpecified in the Notes for Urinalysis that the 
urine sample is only to be collected if the 
participant canproduce urineTo reflect that some participants with ESRD on 
HD are unable to produce urine and un der those 
circumstances, would not be expected to 
produce urine for a urinalysis
Section 1.3, 
Schedule of 
Activities for Panel 
CRemoved ‘Plasma’ from ‘Dialysate Samples 
for Plasma MK -0616 and/or Metabolites Assay 
–Period 2 Only’Correction of a typo where ‘Plasma’ was 
included in error
Section 1.3, 
Schedule of 
Activities for Panel 
CModified original footnote ‘g’, now footnote 
‘e’To emphasize that the Day 1 Predose Scheduled 
Time is the only timepoint when triplicate 
semirecumbent VS (HR, BP) and 12-lead ECGs 
are taken
Section 1.3,
Schedule of 
Activities for Panel 
CModified original footnote ‘k’,now footnote ‘i’ To reflect that some participants with ESRD on 
HD are unable to produce urine and under those 
circumstances, would not be expected to 
produce interval urine samples for PK analysis.
Section 4.1, 
Overall DesignReplaced ‘< 15 requiring HD’ with ‘Not 
applicable ’ inTable 1 Renal Function Group 
for participants in Panel CTo reflect that th e calculated eGFR value is not
relevant in participants with ESRD on HD ,due 
to the fluctuation in the creatinine values 
between hemodialysis sessions
Section 4.1, 
Overall DesignRemoved all reference to the timing of 
hemodialysis sessionsTo allow flexibility in the timing of 
hemodialysis sessions to reflect the fact that the 
length and timing of hemodialysis sessions 
varies from participant to participant and from 
session to session
Section 4.1, 
Overall DesignModified wording regarding dialysate sample 
collection, emphasizin g collection at the end of 
every 30 -minute interval from the start of 
hemodialysis until immediately before 
hemodialysis completionTo comply with standard practice regarding 
collection of dialysate sample for PK analysis

2 INTRODUCTIO N
2.1 Study Rationale
MK-0616 is a small molecule cyclic peptide inhibitor of PCSK9 being developed for the 
treatment of hypercholesterolemia . MK -0616 is a low clearance drug which is excreted as 
unchanged parent peptide in rat and cynomolgus monkeys predominately by renal clearance. 
As such, this study is being conducted to assess the impact of moderate renal impairment, 
severe renal impairment, and end- stage renal disease on the PK of MK- 0616.
2.2 Background
Refer to the IB for detailed background inform ation on MK -0616.
2.2.1 Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background
MK-0616 is a cyclic peptide inhibitor of PCSK9 being developed for reduction of LDL-C.
2.2.2 Information on Other Study -related Therapy
There is no other study -related therapy in this protocol.
2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
Participants in clinical studies will not receive direct benefit from treatment during 
participation as clinical studies are designed to provide information about the safety and 
properties of an investigational medicine.
Additional details regarding specific benefits and risks for participants participating in this 
clinical study may be found in the accompanying IB and informed consent documents.

3 HYPOTHESES, OBJECTIVES, AND ENDPOINTS
Hypotheses are aligned with objectives in the Obje ctives and Endpoints table.
The following objectives will be evaluated in male and female participants, 18 to 85 years of 
age (inclusive), with moderate RI , severe RI, ESRD on HD, and healthy adults.
Primary Objective Primary Endpoint
To compare the plasma PK of MK -0616 
following a single 20 mg dose in 
participants on a background of statin 
therapy with varying degrees of renal 
impairment (moderate, severe, ESRD) to 
those of healthy mean matched control 
participants on a background of statin 
therapy.
Estimation: MK -0616 AUC0 -inf following 
a single dose of MK -0616 administered to 
participants with varying degrees of renal 
impairment (moderate, severe, ESRD) will 
be estimated and compared to MK -0616

4 STUDY DESIGN
4.1 Overall Design
This is a nonrandomized, parallel -group, multi -site, open- label study of MK -0616 in adult
male and female participant s with moderate renal impairment (Panel A; n=8), severe renal 
impairment (Panel B; n=8 ), end -stage renal disease on HD (Panel C; n=8), and healthy mean 
match edcontrol participants (Panel D; n=8 to 12), all on a background of statin therapy. 
Healthy control participants will be matched for mean age (± 15 years) and BMI 
(±3.5kg/m2) of part icipants with RI. In addition, the ratio of males and females of the 
healthy participants will be generally matched to the ratio of males and females of RI 
participants. Enrollment into the healthy mean matched control panel (Panel D) will begin 
once 8 par ticipants with RI have been enrolled across all RI panels ( 8 participants from 
Panels A, B, and C combined). Up to an additional 4 healthy participants may be enrolled as 
needed, to maintain the mean- matching of the healthy participant panel to the RI pane ls. If 
additional healthy matched control participants are enrolled (beyond the minimum 
8participants), the overall ratio of males and females in the healthy panel should be as close 
as possible to the overall ratio of males and females in the RI panels. 
The study will evaluate safety, PK, and pharmacodynamic effects of a single oral 20 mg dose 
of MK -0616. The dose of MK -0616 will be administered in a fasted state (ie, following an 
overnight fast of at least 8 hours , with no food for at least 30 minutes f ollowing the oral 
dose).
Assignment to a renal function group will be as shown in Table 1 :
Table 1 Renal Function Group
Panel Renal Impairment Stage n eGFR (mL/min)a,b
A Moderate 8 ≥ 30 but ≤ 60c
B Severe 8 ≥ 15 but < 30 not on dialysis
C ESRD requiring HD 8 N ot applicable
D Healthy 8 to 12d≥ 90
BSA=body surface area; CKD- EPI=Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration; cr=creatinine; 
eGFR=estimated glomerular filtration rate; ESRD=end -stage renal disease; HD=hemodialysis
aeGFR based on the 2021 CKD -EPI Creatinine (CKD -EPIcr_R) equation that does not require use of race. Baseline 
eGFR will be obtained twice (at least 72 h ours apart as part of participant screening) and the mean of the 2 values 
will be used for group assignment. The second baseline eGFR sample may be obtained on Day -1 but within 24 
hours of study intervention administration, as long as data are available i n time to confirm eligibility.
beGFR criteria will use de -indexed values to correct for participant BSA. To convert indexed eGFR expressed as 
mL/min/1.73 m2, this value will be divided by 1.73 and multiplied by participant BSA.
cReasonable efforts will be made to enroll at least 2 participants in the moderate renal impairment group who have 
eGFR values of 30 to 40 mL/min.
dMay need to enroll more than 8 to enable mean matching of the healthy mean match controls to the participants with 
RI.

MK-0616 -020-01FINAL PROTOCOL 10-AUG- 2023
Participants with moderate RI (Panel A), participants with severe RI (Panel B), and healthy 
mean matched control participants (Panel D), will receive a single oral dose of 20 mg 
MK-0616, followed by PK sampling until 48 hours postdose in the clinic. There will be 
additional outpatient visits through 240 hours postdose for PK assessments and a follow up 
visit approximately 14 days postdose. Safety will be monitored throughout the study by 
repeated clinical and laboratory evaluations.
ESRD participants (Panel C), will receive a single oral dose of 20 mg MK -0616 on 2 
separate occasions. In Period 1 on Day 1 , ESRD participants will receive a single oral dose of 
20 mg MK -0616 immediately following completion of the scheduled HD, followed by PK 
sampling until 48 hours postdose in the clinic. There will be additional outpatient visits 
through 240 hours postdose for PK assessments and HD sessions. For participants following 
a Monday, Wednesday, Friday HD schedule, MK -0616 will be administered immediately 
following the Friday HD session (Study Day 1). For participants following a Tuesday, 
Thursday, Saturday HD schedule, study intervention will be administered immediately 
following their Saturday HD session (Study Day 1) . The participant’s next scheduled HD 
session s will occur e ither Monday or Tuesday (Study Day 4) andeither Wednesday or 
Thursday (Study Day 6 ).A PK sample for MK -0616 analysis will be collected prior to HD
(Pre- HD) and after HD (Post -HD) on Study Days 4 and 6. There will be a washout period of 
at least 14 days between MK -0616 administrations in each period, due to the need to collect 
PK samples out to 240- hours postdose in each period and to stay on the HD schedule .
In Period 2 on Day 1 , ESRD participants (Panel C) will receive a single oral dose of 20 m g 
MK-0616 approximately 0.5 hours prior to their scheduled HDfollowed by PK sampling 
until 48 hours postdose in the clinic. There will be additional outpatient visits through 240 
hours postdose for PK assessments of MK- 0616 and HD sessions. For participan ts following 
a Monday, Wednesday, Friday HD schedule, MK -0616 will be administered approximately 
0.5 hours prior to the Friday HD session (Study Day 1) . For participants following a 
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday HD schedule, MK -0616 will be administered appr oximately 
0.5 hours prior to the Saturday HD session (Study Day 1) . The HD session should initiate 
immediately following the 0.5- hour PK blood draw. The participant’s next scheduled HD 
sessions will occur either Monday or Tuesday (Study Day 4) and either W ednesday or 
Thursday (Study Day 6). A PK sample for MK -0616 analysis will be collected prior to HD
(Pre- HD) and after HD (Post -HD) on Study Days 1, 4 , and 6 . A Pre-HD dialysate sample 
will be collected at the start of HD. During the HDsession, dialysate samples will be 
collected at the end of every 30-minute interval from the start of HD until immediately 
before HD completion, for MK -0616 analysis.
Because this i s a Phase 1 assessment of MK- 0616 in humans, the PK, pharmacodynamic, and 
safety profiles of the compound are still being elucidated. This protocol is therefore written 
with flexibility to accommodate the inherent dynamic nature of Phase 1 clinical studies . 
Refer to Section 8.11.6 for examples of modifications permitted within the protocol 
parameters.
Specific procedures to be performed during the study, including prescribed times and 
associated visit windows, are outlined in Section 1.3of the SoA. Details of each procedure 
are provided in Section 8.

4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
MK-0616 is likely to be used in patients with varying degrees of RI. The primary purpose of 
this trial is to understand the impact of moderate RI, severe RI and ESRD on the PK of 
MK-0616.
This study will evaluate and compare MK -0616 PK 
in participants with moderate RI, severe RI and ESRD patients requiring HDto healthy 
control participants with normal renal function that are reasonably matched to the mean 
demographic parameters of participants with varying degrees of RI to control for the 
influence of covariates. In addition, the impact of HD on MK -0616 PK will also be assessed.
4.2.1 Rationale for Endpoints
4.2.1.1 Efficacy Endpoints
No efficacy endpoints will be evaluated.
4.2.1.2 Safety Endpoints
Safety will be assessed by monitoring AEs, physical examinations, VS, 12 -lead ECGs, and 
laboratory safety tests (chemistry, hematology, urinalysis). Based on the data from preclinical 
safety studies and clinical studies to date, no specific concerns or target organ toxicities have 
been identified. Therefore, standard safety monitoring has been deemed adequate.
4.2.1.3 Pharm acokinetic Endpoints
Pharmacokinetic parameters selected for evaluation in this study will effectively inform the 
pharmacokinetic profile of MK -0616 and include the following: AUC0- inf, AUClast, Cmax, 
Tmax, t1/2, CL/F, Vz/F, CLr (renal clearance), Ae (amou nt excreted).
4.2.1.4 Pharmacodynamic Endpoints
Reduction of free PCSK9 relative to baseline will be included as an exploratory endpoint. 
Inhibition of PCSK9 results in reduction of plasma LDL -C, therefore the percent reduction of 
plasma LDL- C from baseline/pre -dose levels will be used as a pharmacodynamic endpoint.
4.2.1.5 Planned Exploratory Biomarker Research
4.2.1.5.1 Planned Genetic Analysis
Genetic variation may impact a participant’s response to therapy, susceptibility to, severity, 
and progression of disease. Variable response to therapy may be due to genetic determinants 
that impact drug ADME ,mechanism of action of the drug ,disease etiology, and/or molecular 
subtype of the disease being treated. Therefore, where local regulations and IRB/IEC allow, a 
sample will be collected for DNA analysis from consenting participants.
DNA samples may be used for research related to the study intervention(s), the disease under 
study, or related diseases. They may also be used to develop tests/assays including diagnostic

tests related to the disease under study, related diseases, and study intervention(s). Genetic 
research may consist of the analysis of 1 or more candidate genes, the analysis of genetic 
markers throughout the genome, or analysis of the entire genome. Analysis may be 
conducted if it is hypothesized that this may help further understand the clinical data.
The samples may be analyzed as part of a multistudy assessment of genetic factors involved 
in the response to understand study disease or related conditions.
4.2.1.6 Future Biomedical Research
The Sponsor will conduct FBR on DNA specimens for which consent was provided during 
this clinical study.
Such research is for biomarker testing to address emergent questions not described elsewhere 
in the protocol and will only be conducted on specimens from appropriately consented 
participants. The objective of collecting/retaining specimens for FBR is to explore and 
identify biomarkers that inform the scientific understanding of diseases and/or their 
therapeutic treatments. The o verarching goal is to use such information to develop safer, 
more effective drugs/vaccines, and/or to ensure participants receive the correct dose of the 
correct drug/vaccine at the correct time. The details of FBR are presented in Appendix 6 .
4.2.2 Rationale fo r Control
Healthy participants with normal renal function, matched by mean age, mean BMI, and sex, 
will serve as the control group. Comparison of data from participants with renal impairment 
to data from healthy participants will effectively inform the dif ferences of safety and PK 
between the groups.
4.3 Justification for Dose
The proposed clinical dose for MK -0616 is 20 mg taken once daily, which will be evaluated 
in this study. S ingle doses of 20 mg MK-0616 will be sufficient to characterize the impact of 
RIon the PK of MK -0616.
In healthy controls, a single oral dose of 20 mg is anticipated to result in plasma AUC0 -inf of 
This projection is based upon observed 18 to 20 mg fasted PK in 
normal healthy participants from previous Phase 1 studies (ie, P005, P009), with the 
additional assumption of
 With above 
assumptions regarding severe/ESRD, the MK -0616 AUC0 -inf could be up to
with a 20 mg single dose . In the FIH study (P001), single doses of 300 mg 
were associated with mean plasma AUC0 -inf of 2260 nM*hr and were well -tolerated, so it is

anticipated that existing clinical safety is sufficient to justify the 20 mg dose in this study 
across all renally impaired groups.
In the Phase 2b study, plasma levels of
The target population for MK -0616 will be on 
standard of care/statin therapy, and a large proportion of renally impaired patients are 
receiving concomitant medications, including statins .
Participants will not be limited to any particular type of statin (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, etc), 
which is a similar approach as used in previous studies with MK -0616. In P008 (Ph2b study), 
at the 18 mg dose,
 Therefore, we do not plan to limit or restrict 
participants to a partic ular dose level (ie, high/medium/low intensity statin).
As this is a Phase 1 assessment of MK- 0616 in humans, and the PK, pharmacodynamic and 
safety profiles of the compound are still being evaluated, modifications to the dose or dosing 
regimen may be required to achieve the scientific goals of the study objectives and/or to 
ensure appropriate safety m onitoring of the study participants. Details of allowed 
modifications are provided in Section 8.11.6.
4.4 Beginning and End -of-Study Definition
The overall study begins when the first participant (or their legally acceptable representative) 
provides documented informed consent. The overall study ends when the last participant 
completes the last study -related contact, withdraws consent, or is lost to follow- up (Section 
7.3).For purposes of analysis and reporting, the overall study ends when the Sponsor 
receives the last laboratory test result or at the time of final contact with the last participant, 
whichever comes last.
If the study includes countries in the European Economic Area (EEA), the local start of the 
study in the EEA is defined as First Site Ready (F SR) in any Member State.
A study may be paused during review of newly available preclinical/clinical safety, PK, 
pharmacodynamic, efficacy, or biologic data or other items of interest, prior to a final 
decision on continuation or termination of the study. It may be necessary to keep the study 
open for gathering/reviewing of additional supportive data to optimally complete the 
objective(s) of the study. If necessary, the appropriate amendment(s) to the protocol and/or 
appropriate communication(s) will be generated. If the decision has been made to end the 
study following this review period, the study end will be defined as the date of the Sponsor 
decision, and this end of study date supersedes the definitions outlined above. The 
Competent Authority(ies) and IRB(s)/IEC(s) will be apprised of the maximum duration of 
the study beyond the last participant out and the justification for keeping the study open.

intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long- term and 
persistent basis), as described in Appendix 5 during the intervention period and for at 
least 8 weeks after the last dose of study intervention. The investigator should 
evaluate the potential for contraceptive method failure (ie, noncompliance, recently 
initiated) in relationship to the first dose of study intervention. Contraceptive use by 
POCBPs should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of 
contraception for those participating in clinical studies. If the contraception 
requirements in the local label for any of the study interventions are more stringent 
than the requirements above, the local label requirements are to be followed.

regulations within 24 hours (for a urine test) or 72 hours (for a serum test) before the 
first dose of study intervention. If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative (eg, an 
ambiguous result), a serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the participant 
must be excluded from participation if the serum pregnancy result is positive.
Additional requirements for pregna ncy testing during and after study intervention are 
in Section 8.3.5.
-Medical history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity has been reviewed by 
the investigator to decrease the risk for inclusion of a POCBP with an early 
undetected pregnancy.

All supplies indicated in Table 2will be provided per the “Sourcing” column depending on 
local country operational requirements. If local sourcing, every attempt should be made to 
source these supplies from a single lot/batch number where possible (eg, not applicable in the 
case where multiple lots or batches may be required due to the length of the study, etc) .
Refer to Section 8.1.8 for details regarding administration of the study intervention.
6.2 Preparation/H andling/Storage/Accountability
6.2.1 Dose Preparation
There are no specific calculations or evaluations required to be performed to administer the 
proper dose to each participant. The rationale for selection of doses to be used in this study is 
in Section 4.3.
6.2.2 Handling, Storage, and Accountability
The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study intervention received, and any discrepancies are 
reported and resolved before use of the stu dy intervention.
Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study intervention, and only authorized 
site staff may supply or administer study intervention. All study interventions must be stored 
in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitor ed (manual or automated) area in 
accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and 
authorized site staff.
The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for s tudy intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, 
receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).
For all study sites, the local country Sponsor personnel or designee will provide appropriate 
documentation that must be completed for drug accountability and return, or local discard 
and destruction if appropriate. Where local discard and destruction is appropriate, the 
investigator is responsible for ensuring that a local discard/destruction procedure is 
documented.
The st udy site is responsible for recording the lot number, manufacturer, and expiry date for 
any locally purchased product (if applicable) as per local guidelines unless otherwise 
instructed by the Sponsor.
The investigator shall take responsibility for and sha ll take all steps to maintain appropriate 
records and ensure appropriate supply, storage, handling, distribution, and usage of study 
interventions in accordance with the protocol and any applicable laws and regulations.

aThere will be at least 14 days of washout between study intervention administration in each period
6.3.2 Stratification
No stratification based on age, sex, or other characteristics will be used in this study.
6.3.3 Blinding
This is an open -label study ; therefore, the Sponsor, investigator, and participant will know 
theintervention administered.
6.4 Study Intervention Compliance
Interruptions from the protocol -specified treatment plan require consultation between the 
investigator and the Sponsor and written documentation of the collaborative decision on 
participant management.
When the individual dose for a participant is prepared from a bulk supply, the preparation of 
the dose will be confirmed by a second member of the study -site staff.
When participants ar e dosed at the site, they will receive study intervention directly from the 
investigator or designee, under medical supervision. The date and time of each dose 
administered in the clinic will be recorded in the source documents and recorded in the CRF. 
Thedose of study intervention and study participant ID will be confirmed at the time of 
dosing by a member of the study -site staff other than the person administering the study 
intervention. Study- site personnel will examine each participant’s mouth to ensur e that the 
study intervention was ingested.

6.5 Concomitant Therapy
If a participant does not discontinue all prior medications within 14 days or 5 half-lives of the 
first dose of study intervention, they may be included in the study if the investigator can 
rationalize that the specific use of a prior medication is not clinically relevant within the 
context of the study.
Concurrent use of any prescription or nonprescription medication, or concurrent vaccination, 
during the ongoing study (ie, after intervention allocation) must first be discussed between 
the investigator and Sponsor before administration, unless appropriate medical care 
necessitates that therapy or vaccination should begin before the investigator and Sponsor can 
consult. The participant will be a llowed to continue in the study if both the Sponsor and the 
investigator agree.
Paracetamol/acetaminophen (up to 2 g total per day for participants with RI or up to 4 g total 
per day for healthy participants) may be used for minor ailments without prior co nsultation 
with the Sponsor.
Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not to be used without prior consultation 
with the Sponsor.
In addition, the following concomitant medications/vaccinations are permitted:
•COVID- 19 vaccine may be administered. Study intervention must be given at least 
72hours following or at least 48 hours prior to any COVID -19 vaccination.
•Hormone replacement therapy
•Contraceptives
•Statins (any statin, any dose) , but must be on a stable, unchanged dose for at least 
2months prior to screening
In addition, f or participants with RI (Panels A, B, and C):
Medications specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during the 
ongoing study. If there is a clinical indication for any medications specifically prohi bited, 
discontinuation from study intervention may be required. The investigator should discuss any 
questions regarding this with the Sponsor. The final decision on any supportive therapy rests 
with the investigator and/or the participant’s primary physici an. For ESRD participants 
(Panel C), however, the decision to continue the participant on study intervention requires the 
mutual agreement of the investigator, the Sponsor, and the participant.
Participants who are taking certain prescription medications t o treat m anifestations of renal 
disease or medications needed to treat stable diseases ( eg, angiotensin converting enzyme 
inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, beta -blockers, diuretics) may be allowed to 
participate in the study at the discretio n of the investigator. Participants must be on a stable 
regimen for at least 2 weeks (or 5 half -lives of the concomitant medication, whichever is 
longer) prior to administration of study intervention and be able to withhold the use for 4

hours prior to and 4 hours afterstudy intervention administration . If a participant is 
prescribed prohibited medication, upon discussion between the Sponsor and the investigator, 
the investigator may substitute the previously prescribed medication to an allowed one for 
thepurpose of this study. Examples of the types of medications that would be allowed 
include (but are not limited to) the following:
•Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, diuretics
•Beta blockers
•Metformin, thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, DPP -4 inhibitors, alpha -glucosidase 
inhibitors, incretin mimetics
•Synthroid
•Colchicine, allopurinol
•SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants
•Proton pump inhibitors
Participants using medical marijuana will be allowed to particip ate in the study at the 
discretion of the investigator, however, the use of medical marijuana should be restricted 
during study particip ation.
Any medication (including over -the-counter) that would significantly alter eGFR, which, by 
the determination of t he investigator, might interfere with the study (eg, cimetidine) must be 
discontinued at least 2 weeks (or 5 half -lives of the compound, whichever is longer) prior to 
administration of study intervention .
The Sponsor should be contacted if there are any questions regarding concomitant or prior 
therapy.
6.5.1 Rescue Medications and Supportive Care
No rescue or supportive medications are specified for use in this study.
CRUs will be staffed with medically trained personnel with appropriate access to full -service 
acute care hospitals to facilitate rapid institution of medical intervention.
6.6 Dose Modification
Dose modifications are not applicable to this study.
6.6.1 Stopping Rules
The following stopping rules will be used during the conduct of this study.
If any of the below stopping rules are met, the study will be paused, and no further dosing

7 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND PARTICIPANT 
WITHDRAWAL
7.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention
In clinical studies with a single intervention, discontinuation of study intervention can only 
occur before the intervention. Therefore, participants who receive a single -dose intervention 
cannot discontinue study intervention (ie, participants in Panels A, B, and D) .
For ESRD Participants only (Panel C):
Discontinuation of study intervention does not represent withdrawal from the study. As 
certain data on clinical events beyond study intervention discontinuation may be important to 
the study, they must be collected through the participant’s last scheduled follow -up, even if 
the participant has discontinued study intervention. Therefore, all participants who 
discontinue study intervention before completion of the protocol -specified treatment period
will still continue to participate in the study as specified in Section 1.3 and Section 8.1.9, or 
if availa ble, a PCL.
Participants may discontinue study intervention at any time for any reason or be discontinued 
from the study intervention at the discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect 
occur. In addition, a participant may be discontinued fro m study intervention by the 
investigator or the Sponsor if study intervention is inappropriate, the study plan is violated, or 
for administrative and/or other safety reasons. Specific details regarding procedures to be 
performed at study intervention discontinuation are provided in Section 8.1.9 .
A participant must be discontinued from study intervention, but continue to be monitored in 
the study, for any of the following reasons:
•The participant or participant’s legally acceptable representative requests t o discontinue 
study intervention.
•The participant has a medical condition or personal circumstance which, in the opinion of 
the investigator and/or Sponsor, placed the participant at unnecessary risk from continued 
administration of study intervention.
•Theparticipant has a positive drug screen at any time during the course of the study (with 
the exception for positive drug screen due to prescription drug use that is approved by the 
investigator and Sponsor) . The drug screen can be confirmed by a recheck at the 
discretion of the investigator after discussion with the Sponsor.
7.2 Participant Withdrawal From the Study
A participant must be withdrawn from the study if the participant or participant’s legally 
acceptable representative withdraws consent from the study.
If a participant withdraws from the study, they will no longer receive study intervention or be 
followed at scheduled protocol visits.
08NZV3
PRODUCT: MK-0616 56
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 020-01

Specific details regarding procedures to be performed at the time of withdrawal from the 
study, as well as specific details regarding withdrawal from FBR, are outlined in 
Section 8.1.9. The procedures to be performed should a participant repeatedly fail to return 
for scheduled visits and/or if the study site is unable to contact the participant are outlined in
Section 7.3.
7.3 Lost to Follow -up
If a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit and/or if the site is unable 
to contact the participant, the following procedures are to be performed:
•The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit. If the 
participant is contacted, the participant should be counseled on the importance of 
maintaining the protocol -specified visit schedule.
•The investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant 
at each missed visit (eg, telephone calls and/or a certified letter to the participant’s last 
known mailing address or locally equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be 
documented in the participant’s medical record.

8 STUD Y ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
•Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA.
•Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is 
essential and required for study conduct.
•The investigator is responsible for ens uring that procedures are conducted by 
appropriately qualified (by education, training, and experience) staff. Delegation of 
study- site personnel responsibilities will be documented in the Investigator Trial File 
Binder (or equivalent).
•All study- related m edical decisions must be made by an investigator who is a qualified 
physician.
•All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.
•Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood 
count) and obtained before providing doc umented informed consent may be used for 
screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure s meet the protocol -specified 
criteria and were performed within the time frame defined in the SoA.
•Additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by the investigator and or the 
Sponsor for reasons related to participant safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing 
may be potentially sensitive in nature (eg, HIV, hepatitis C), and thus local regulations 
may require that additional informed consent be obta ined from the participant. In these 
cases, such evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations.
•The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the 
study will not exceed the volume mentioned in Appendix 8.
•Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues 
with the samples.
8.1 Administrative and General Procedures
8.1.1 Informed Consent
Informed consent will adhere to IRB/IEC requirements, applicable laws and regulations, and 
Sponsor requirements. The ICF, any subsequent revised ICF, and any written information 
provided to the participant must receive the IRB/IEC’s approval/favorable opinion in 
advance of use.
Informed consent given by the participant (or their legally acceptable representative )must be 
documented on a consent form. The form must include the study protocol number, study 
protocol title, dated signature, and agreement of the participant (or their legally acceptable 
representative) and of the perso n conducting the consent discussion.

A copy of the signed and dated ICFshould be given to the participant (or their legally 
acceptable representative) before participation in the study.
The investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent with loc al requirements) must 
obtain documented informed consent from each potential participant (or their legally 
acceptable representative) prior to participating in this clinical study or FBR . If there are 
changes to the participant’s status during the study (e g, health or age of majority 
requirements), the investigator or medically qualified designee must ensure the appropriate 
documented informed consent is in place.
8.1.1.1 General Informed Consent
Specifics about the study and the study population are to be included in the ICF.
The participant (or their legally acceptable representative )should be informed in a timely 
manner if new information becomes available that may be relevant to the participant’s 
willingness to continue participation in the study. The communica tion of this information 
will be provided and documented via a revised consent form or addendum to the original 
consent form that captures the participant’s or the participant’s legally acceptable 
representative’s dated signature.
8.1.1.2 Consent and Collection of Specimens for Future Biomedical Research
The investigator or medically qualified designee will explain the FBR consent to the 
participant, or the participant’s legally acceptable representative, answer all of his/her 
questions, and obtain documented informed consent before performing any procedure related 
to FBR. A copy of the informed consent will be given to the participant before performing 
any procedure related to FBR.
8.1.2 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
All inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed by the investigator, who is a qualified 
physician, to ensure that the participant qualifies for the study.
8.1.3 Participant Identification Card
All participants will be given a participant identification card identifying them as participants 
in a research study. The card will contain study -site contact information (including direct 
telephone numbers) to be used in the event of an emergency. The investigator or qualified 
designee will provide the participant with a participant identification card immediately after
the participant provides documented informed consent. At the time of intervention allocation,
site personnel will add the treatment/ allocation number to the participant identification card.
The participant identification card also contains contact information for the emergency 
unblinding call center so that a health care provider can obtain information about study 
intervention in emergency situations where the investigator is not available.

8.1.4 Medical History
A medical history will be obtained by the investigator or qualified designee.
8.1.5 Prior and Concomitant Medications Review
8.1.5.1 Prior Medications
The investigator or qualified designee will review before medication use, including any 
protocol -specified washout requirement, and record prior medication taken by the participant 
within 14 days before first dose of study intervention.
8.1.5.2 Concomitant Medications
The investigator or qualified designee will record medication, if any, taken by the participant 
during the study.
8.1.6 Assignment of Screening Number
All consented participants will be given a unique screening number that will be used to 
identify the participant for all procedures that occur before intervention allocation . Each 
participant will be assigned only 1 screening number. Screening numbers must not be reused 
for different participants.
Any participant who is screened multiple times will retain the original screening number 
assigned at the Screening Visit. Specific details on the screening/rescreening visit 
requirements are in Section 8.11.1. Pre-trial screening logs may be collected for review by 
the Sponsor. If applicable, any information that would make the participant identifiable will 
be removed .
8.1.7 Assignment of Treatment/ Alloc ation Number
All eligible participants will be allocated, by nonrandom assignment, and will receive a 
treatment/ allocation number. The treatment/ allocation number identifies the participant for 
all procedures occurring after treatment /allocation. Once a treatment/ allocation number is 
assigned to a participant, it ca n never be reassigned to another participant.
A single participant cannot be assigned more than 1 treatment/ allocation number.
8.1.8 Study Intervention Administration

8.1.8.1 Timing of Dose Administration
Participants with moderate RI (Panel A), severe RI (Panel B), and healthy participants 
(Panel D) :
On Day 1, 20 mg (1 x 20 mg tablet) MK- 0616 will be given to participants at Hour 0.
Participants with ESRD:
On Day 1 of Period 1, 20 mg (1 x 20 mg tablet) MK -0616 will be given to participants at 
Hour 0, immediately following completion of the scheduled HD session .On Day 1 of Period 
2, 20 mg (1 x 20 mg tablet) MK -0616 will be given to participants at Hour 0, approximately 
0.5 hours prior to the scheduled HD session .
All participants :
The study interventions will be administered with approximately 240 mL of water following 
at least an 8- hour fast and participants will continue to fast for at least 30 minutes postdos e.
See Section 5.3.1 for additional information on meal restrictions throughout the study.
The exact clock time of study intervention administration will be recorded.
8.1.9 Discontinuation and Withdrawal
The investigator or study coordinator must notify the Spon sor when a participant has been 
discontinued/withdrawn from the study and/or intervention. If a participant discontinues for 
any reason at any time during the course of the study and/or intervention ,the participant may 
be asked to return to the clinic (or be contacted) for a poststudy visit as per the number of 
days described in Section 1.3 to have the applicable procedures conducted. However, the 
investigator may decide to perform the poststudy procedures at the time of discontinuation or 
as soon as possi ble after discontinuation. If the poststudy visit occurs prior to the safety 
follow -up time frame as specified in Section 8.4.1 , the investigator should perform a 
follow -up telephone call at the end of the follow -up period ( Section 8.4.1) to confirm if any 
AEs have occurred since the poststudy clinic visit. Any AEs that are present at the time of 
discontinuation/withdrawal should be followed in accordance with the safety requirements 
outlined in Section 8.4.
8.1.9.1 Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Research
Participants may withdraw their consent for FBR. Participants may withdraw consent at any 
time by contacting the study investigator. If medical records for the study are still available, 
the investigator will contact the Sponsor using the designated mailbox 
(clinical.specimen.management@MSD.com). Subsequently, the participant’s consent for 
FBR will be withdrawn. A letter will be sent from the Sponsor to the investigator confirming 
the withdrawal. It is the responsibility of the investigator to inform the pa rticipant of 
completion of withdrawal. Any analyses in progress at the time of request for withdrawal or 
already performed before the request being received by the Sponsor will continue to be used 
08NZV3

MK-0616 -020-01FINAL PROTOCOL 10-AUG- 2023
as part of the overall research study data and results. No new analyses would be generated 
after the request is received.
If the medical records for the study are no longer available (eg, if the investigator is no longer 
required by regulatory authorities to retain the study records) or the specimens have been 
completely anonymized, there will no longer be a link between the participant’s personal 
information and their specimens. In this situation, the request for specimen withdrawal 
cannot be processed.
8.1.10 Participant Blinding/Unblinding
This is an open -label study; there is no blinding for this study. The emergency unblinding 
call center will be ava ilable so that a health care provider can obtain information about study 
intervention in emergency situations where the investigator is not available.
8.1.11 Domiciling
All participants (Panels A to D) will be admitted to the CRU on Day - 1, at the time indicated 
by the CRU, and will be housed until after the 48 hours postdose study procedures are 
completed on Day 3. Panel C participants with ESRD will follow the same domiciling 
schedule in a 2ndtreatment period.
At all times, a participant may be required to remain at the CRU for longer at the discretion 
of the investigator or designee.
8.1.12 Calibration of Equipment
The investigator or qualified designee has the responsibility to ensur e that any device or 
instrument used for a clinical evaluation/test during a clinical study that provides information 
about inclusion/exclusion criteria and/or safety or efficacy parameters shall be suitably 
calibrated and/or maintained to ensure that the data obtained are reliable and/or reproducible. 
Documentation of equipment calibration must be retained as source documentation at the 
study site.
8.2 Efficacy/Immunogenicity Assessments
There are no direct efficacy or immunogenicity assessments in this study.
8.3 Safety Assessments
Details regarding specific safety procedures/assessments to be performed in this study are 
provided. The total amount of blood to be drawn/collected over the course of the study (from 
prestudy to poststudy visits), including approximate blood volumes drawn by visit and by 
sample type per participant, can be found in Appendix 8 .

8.3.1 Physical Examinations
A complete physical examination will be conducted by an investigator or medically qualified 
designee (consistent with local requirements) per institutional standard. Height and weight 
will also be measured and recorded at the timepoints listed in the SoA (Section 1.3) .
Symptom -driven physical examination smay be performed at other times, if deemed 
necessary by the investigator or designee .
Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious 
illnesses.
BMI
BMI equals a person’s weight in kilograms divided by height in meters s quared 
(BMI =kg/m2). BMI will be rounded to the nearest whole number according to the standard 
convention of 0.1 to 0.4 round down and 0.5 to 0.9 round up.
Body weight and height will be obtained with the participant’s shoes off and jacket or coat 
removed.
BSA
In order to correct eGFR for individual BSA, the DuBois formula will be used to calculate 
BSA:
BSA (m2) = Weight (kg)0.425x Height (cm)0.725x 0.007184
8.3.2 Vital Signs
•Body temperature, HR, RR, and BP will be assessed.
•Body temperature will be measured with an appropriate thermometer.
•BP and HR measurements will be assessed in a semirecumbent position with a 
completely automated device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated 
device is not available.
•BP and HR measurements should be preceded by at least 10minutes of rest for the 
participant in a quiet setting without distractions.
8.3.2.1 Resting Vital Signs
Vital Sign Measurements (Heart Rate and Blood Pressure)
Participants should be resting in a quiet setting without distractions in a semirecumbent 
position for at least 10 minutes before having VS measurements obtained. Semirecumbent 
VS will include HR, systolic and diastolic BP, RR, and body temperature at timepoints

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 020-01
MK-0616 -020-01FINAL PROTOCOL 10-AUG- 2023
indicated in the SoA. The correct size of the BP cuff and the correct positioning on the 
participant’ s arm is essential to increase the accuracy of BP measurements.
The predose (ba seline) HR and BP will be triplicate measurements, obtained at least 1 to 2 
minutes apart within 3 hours of dosing MK- 0616. The mean of these measurements will be 
used as the baseline to calculate change from baseline for safety evaluations (and for 
rechec ks, if needed). Screening and p ostdose VS measurements will be single measurements.
Participants will continue to rest semirecumbent from dosing until 4 hours postdose except to 
stand for the measurement of orthostatic VS (if needed) or other study- related procedure.
Body Temperature
Body temperature will be measured. The same method must be used for all measurements for 
each individual participant and should be the same for all participants.
8.3.2.2 Orthostatic Vital Signs
Orthostatic VS (HR and systolic and diast olic BP) will also be obtained. Participants should 
be semirecumbent for at least 10 minutes and then stand upright for approximately 2 minutes 
before measurement of orthostatic VS.
8.3.3 Electrocardiograms
•Triplicate 12- lead ECG will be obtained and reviewed by an investigator or medically 
qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) as outlined in the SoA using an 
ECG machine that automatically calculates the HR and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc 
intervals. For healthy participants (Panel D), refer to Appendix 9 for evaluation and 
potentially significant findings.
•At each time point when triplicate ECG are required, 3 individual ECG tracings should 
be obtained at least 1 minute apart. The full set of triplicates should be completed in no 
more than 6 minutes.
Special care must be taken for proper lead placement by qualified personnel. Skin should be 
clean and dry before lead placement. Participants may need to be shaved to ensure proper 
lead placement. Female participants may need to remove interfering garments.
Participants should be resting in the semirecumbent position for at least 10 minutes before 
each ECG measurement.
The correction formula to be used for QTc is Fridericia.
If repeat ECGs are required, the clinical site will decide whether to leave the electrodes in 
place or mark the position of the electrodes for subsequent ECGs. To mark the position of the 
electrodes, 12 -lead electrode sites will be marked on the skin of each participant with an 
ECG skin- marker pen to ensure reproducible elec trode placement.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 020-01
MK-0616 -020-01FINAL PROTOCOL 10-AUG- 2023
Before each period, predose ECGs will be obtained in triplicate at least 1 minute apart within 
3hours before dosing MK- 0616. The mean of these measurements will be used as the 
baseline to calculate change from baseline for safety evaluati ons (and for rechecks, if 
needed).
During the treatment period, if a participant demonstrates an increase in QTc interval 
≥60msec compared with mean predose baseline measurement, the ECG will be repeated 
twice within 5 minutes. The mean value of the QTc i nterval from the 3 ECGs will represent 
the value at that time point. If the mean QTc interval increase from baseline for any postdose 
time point is ≥60msec, the participant will continue to be monitored by repeat 12 -lead ECGs 
every 15 minutes for at least 1hour or until the QTc interval is within 60 msec of baseline. If 
prolongation of the QTc interval ≥60msec persists, a consultation with a study cardiologist 
may be appropriate and the Sponsor should be notified.
During each treatment period, if a participant demonstrates a QTc interval ≥500 msec on a 
postdose ECG, the ECG will be repeated twice within 5 minutes. The mean value of the QTc 
interval from the 3 ECGs will represent the value at that time point. If the mean QTc interval 
is ≥500 msec, the Sponsor should be notified, and the ECGs should be reviewed by a 
cardiologist. The participant should be telemetry monitored (until the QTc interval is 
<500 msec) or should be considered for transfer to a location where closer monitoring and 
definitive care (e g, a CCU or ICU) is available.
If at any time the QRS interval is prolonged ≥200 msec (and change is not considered rate 
related or pacing induced), then the Sponsor should be notified. The ECGs should be 
reviewed by a cardiologist and the participant should be considered for transfer to a location 
where closer monitoring and definitive care (eg, a CCU or ICU) is available.
If the participant has unstable hemodynamics, or has any clinically significant dysrhythmias 
noted, the participant sho uld be immediately transferred to an acute care setting for definitive 
therapy.
If prolongation of the QTc interval is noted, concomitant medications that prolong QTc 
interval should be held until the QTc interval is within 60 msec of baseline and the QTc 
interval is <500 msec.
A cardiologist will be consulted by the investigator as needed to review ECG tracings with 
significant abnormalities.

8.3.4 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
Refer to Appendix 2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performe d and to the SoA for 
the timing and frequency.
•The investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) 
must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically 
relevant changes occurring during the st udy in the AE section of the CRF. The laboratory 
reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless 
judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.
•All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2 , must be 
conducted in accordance with the SoA .
•If laboratory values from nonprotocol -specified laboratory assessments performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in study participant management or are 
considered clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose 
modification), then the results must be recorded in the appropriate CRF (eg, SLAB).
•For any laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation in the study or within 14days after the last dose of study intervention, every 
attempt should be made to perform repeat assessments until the values return to normal or 
baseline or if a new baseline is established as determined by the investigator .
8.3.5 Pregnancy Testing
•Pregnancy testing:
-Pregnancy testing requirements for study inclusion are described in Section 5.1 .
-Additional serum or urine pregnancy tests may be performed, as determined 
necessary by the investigator or required by local regulation, to establish the absence 
of pregnancy at any time during the participant’ s participation in the study.
8.3.6 Photograph of Rash
Photographs of the rash are highly recommended to be taken immediately, along with any 
additional information that may assist the investigator to evaluate the skin reaction, skin 
eruption ,or rash occurrence in determining etiology and study intervention r elationship. See 
Investigator Site Binder for additional guidance.
8.4 Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Other Reportable Safety Events
The definitions of an AE or SAE, as well as the method of recording, evaluating, and 
assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures for completing and transmitting AE, 
SAE, and other reportable safety event reports can be found in Appendix 3 .
08NZV3
PRODUCT: MK-0616 66
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 020-01
MK-0616 -020-01FINAL PROTOCOL 10-AUG- 2023
Adverse events, SAEs, and oth er reportable safety events will be reported by the participant 
(or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant ’s legally authorized 
representative).
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and re porting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE as well as other reportable safety events. 
Investigators need to document if an SAE was associated with a medication error, misuse, or 
abuse.
Investigators remain responsible for following up AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety 
events for outcome according to Section 8.4.3. The investigator, who is a qualified physician, 
will assess events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE as well as o ther reportable safety 
events with respect to seriousness, intensity/toxicity ,and causality.
8.4.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE, SAE, and Other Reportable 
Safety Event Information
AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events that occur after the participant provides 
documented informed consent, but before intervention allocation, must be reported by the 
investigator under any of the following circumstances:
•if the participant is receiving placebo run -in or other run -in treatment,
•if the event cau ses the participant to be excluded from the study,
•if it is the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including, but not limited to washout 
or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo, or a procedure.
From the time of intervention allocation through 14 days after cessation of intervention, all 
AEs, SAEs ,and other reportable safety events must be reported by the investigator.
Additionally, any SAE brought to the attention of an investigator any time outside the period 
specified in the previou s paragraph also must be reported immediately to the Sponsor if the 
event is considered related to study intervention.
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs or other reportable safety events 
in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a 
death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and the investigator 
considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, 
the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.
All initial and follow -up AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be recorded and 
reported to the Spons or or designee within the time frames as indicated in Table 4.
Exception: A positive pregnancy test at the time of initial screening is not a reportable event 
unless the participant has received study intervention.

8.4.2 Method of Detecting AEs, SAEs, and Other Reportable Safety Events
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs and other 
reportable safety events . Open- ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is 
the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence.
8.4.3 Follow -up of AE, SAE, and Other Reportable Safety Event Information
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs, SAEs, and other rep ortable safety events, 
including pregnancy and exposure during breastfeeding, ECIs, cancer, and overdose will be 
followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is otherwise explained, or the 
participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Sectio n7.3). In addition, the investigator will 
make every attempt to follow all nonserious AEs that occur in allocated participants for 
outcome. Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 3.
8.4.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAE
Promp t notification (within 24 hours ) by the investigator to the Sponsor of SAE is essential 
so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities toward the safety of participants and the 
safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply with country- specific regulatory requirements and global laws and 
regulations relating to safety reporting to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs, and investigators.
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for SUSARs according to local regulatory 
requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary.
08NZV3
PRODUCT: MK-0616 69
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 020-01
MK-0616 -020-01FINAL PROTOCOL 10-AUG- 2023
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAE s) from the Sponsor will file it 
along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropr iate according to local requirements.
8.4.5 Pregnancy and Exposure During Breastfeeding
Although pregnancy and infant exposure during breastfeeding are not considered AEs, any 
pregnancy or infant exposure during breastfeeding (spontaneously reported to the 
investigator or their designee) that occurs in a participant during the study are reportable to 
the Sponsor.
All reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy.
Any pregnancy complication will be reported as an AE or S AE.
The medical reason (example: maternal health or fetal disease) for an elective termination of 
a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE. Prenatal testing showing fetus will be born 
with severe abnormalities/congenital anomalies that leads to an elec tive termination of a 
pregnancy will be reported as an SAE for the fetus.
Pregnancy outcomes of ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign 
hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage, and stillbirth 
must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to 
term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported.
8.4.6 Disease -related Events and/or Disease -related Outcomes Not Qualifying as 
AEs or SAEs
Not applicable to this study.
8.4.7 Events of Clinical Interest
Selected serious and nonserious AEs are also known as ECIs and must be reported to the 
Sponsor.
Events of clinical interest for this study include:
1.An overdose of Sponsor ’s product, as defined in Section 8.5.
2.Potential DILI events defined as an elevated AST or ALT laboratory value that is greater 
than or equal to 3 ×the ULN and an elevated total bilirubin laboratory value that is greater 
than or equal to 2 ×the ULN and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase laboratory 
value that is less than 2× the ULN, as determined by way of protocol -specified laboratory 
testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.*
*Note: These criteria are based on available regulatory guidance documents. The purpose 
of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an 
additional evaluation for an underlying etiology. The study -site guidance for assessment 
and follow -up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator Study File Binder (or
equivalent).

It may also be appropriate to conduct additional evaluation for an underlying etiology in the 
setting of abnormalities of liver blood tests including AST, ALT, bilirubin, and alkaline 
phosphatase that do not meet the criteria noted above. In these cases, the decision to proceed 
with additional evaluation will be made through consultation between the study investigators 
and the Sponsor Clinical Director. However, abnormalities of liver blood tests that do not 
meet the criteria noted above are n ot ECIs for this study.
8.5 Treatment of Overdose
For purposes of this study, an overdose will be defined as any dose of any drug administered 
as part of the study exceeding the dose prescribed by the protocol. It is up to the investigator 
or the reporting phy sician to decide whether a dose is to be considered an overdose, in 
consultation with the Sponsor.
Sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose. Decisions regarding dose 
interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the 
Sponsor Clinical Director based on the clinical evaluation of the participant.
8.6 Pharmacokinetics
The decision as to which plasma and/or urine samples collected will be measured for 
evaluation of PK/pharmacodynamics will be collaboratively determined by the Sponsor. If 
indicated, these samples may also be measured and/or pooled for assay in an exploratory 
manner for metabolites and/or additional pharmacodynamic markers.
Blood samples collected may be stored and further analysis may be perf ormed, if required.
8.6.1 Blood Collection for Plasma MK -0616 and/or Metabolites

samples for biomarker research will be collected from all participants as specified in the 
SoA:
•Blood for genetic analysis
•Blood for Plasma for PCSK9 (free) Assay
8.8.1 Planned Genetic Analysis Sample Collection
The planned genetic analysis sample should be drawn for planned analysis of the association 
between genetic variants in DNA and drug response. This sample will not be collected at the 
site if there is either a local law or regulation prohibiting collection, or if the IRB/IEC does 
not approve the collection of the sample for these purposes . If the sample is collected, 
leftover extracted DNA will be stored for FBR if the participant provides documented 
informed consent for FBR. If the planned genetic analysis is not approved, bu t FBR is 
approved and consent is given, this sample will be collected for the purpose of FBR.
The planned genetic analysis sample should be obtained pre -dose on Day 1 but may be 
collected at the next scheduled blood draw, if needed. Sample collection, stor age, and 
shipment instructions for planned genetic analysis samples will be in the 
Operations/Laboratory Manual.
8.9 Future Biomedical Research Sample Collection

communicated in an of ficial memo. 
8.11.4 Poststudy
Participants will be required to return to clinic approximately 14 days after the last dose of 
study intervention for the poststudy visit. If the poststudy visit occurs less than 14 days after 
the last dose of study intervention, a subsequent follow -up telephone call should be made at 
14days post the last dose of study intervention to determine if any AEs have occurred since 
the poststudy clinic visit.
8.11.5 Critical Procedures Based on Study Objectives: Timing of Procedur e
For this study, the blood sample for MK- 0616 is the critical procedure.
At any postdose time point, the blood sample for MK- 0616 needs to be collected as close to 
the exact time point as possible. All other procedures should be completed as close to the 
prescribed/scheduled time as possible. Study procedures can be performed before or after the 
prescribed/scheduled time.
The order of priority can be changed during the study with joint agreement of the investigator 
and the Sponsor Clinical Dire ctor.
Any no nscheduled procedures required for urgent evaluation of safety concerns take 
precedence over all routine scheduled procedures.
The following variance in procedure collection times will be permitted.

8.11.6 Study Design/Dosing/Procedures Modifications Permitted Within Protocol 
Parameters
This is a Phase 1 assessment of MK- 0616 in humans, and the PK, pharmacodynamic, and 
safety profiles of the compound are still being elucidated. This protocol is wr itten with some 
flexibility to accommodate the inherent dynamic nature of Phase 1 clinical studies. 
Modifications to the dose, dosing regimen, and/or clinical or laboratory procedures currently 
outlined may be required to achieve the scientific goals of th e study objectives and/or to 
ensure appropriate safety monitoring of the study participants.
As such, some alterations from the currently outlined dose and/or dosing regimen may be 
permitted based on newly available data, but the maximum daily dose may not exceed those 
currently outlined in the protocol.
•Decrease in the dose of the study intervention administered in any given period/panel
•Entire period(s) or panel(s) may be omitted
•Lengthening of the washout period between doses
•Addition of PK pause

•Instruc tions to take study intervention with or without food or drink may also be modified 
based on newly available data
•Modification of the PK/pharmacodynamic sample processing and shipping details based 
on newly available data
The PK/pharmacodynamic sampling s cheme currently outlined in the protocol may be 
modified during the study based on newly available PK or pharmacodynamic data (eg, to 
obtain data closer to the time of peak plasma concentrations). If indicated, these collected 
samples may also be assayed i n an exploratory manner for metabolites and/or additional 
pharmacodynamic markers.
Up to an additional 50mL of blood may be drawn for safety, PK, and/or pharmacodynamic 
analyses. The total blood volume withdrawn from any single participant will not exceed the 
maximum allowable volume during his/her participation in the entire study (Appendix 8).
The timing of procedures for assessment of safety procedures (eg, vital signs, ECG, safety 
laboratory tests, etc) may be modified during the study based on newly available data. 
Additional laboratory safety tests may be added to blood samples previously drawn to obtain 
additional safety information. These changes will not increase the number of study 
procedures for a given participant during his/her participa tion in the entire study.
It is understood that the current study may use some or none of the alterations described 
above. Any alteration made to this protocol to meet the study objectives must be detailed by 
the Sponsor in a letter to the Study File and f orwarded to the investigator for retention. The 
letter may be forwarded to the IRB/IEC at the discretion of the investigator.

9 KEY STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
This section contains a brief summary of the statistical analyses for this trial. Full detail is in 
the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) (Section 9.2 through 9.9).
If a different group of healthy matched control participants is needed to match the mean age 
and BMI for the RI and ESRD groups, then separate analyses will be performed for the 
populations as follows:
• Moderate RI versus an appropriate group of healthy matched control participants;
• Severe RI versus an appropriate group of healthy matched control participants;
• ESRD participants versus an appropriate group of healthy matched control parti cipants.
If a single set of healthy matched control participants can be used for comparison with all RI 
and ESRD groups, the following analysis pooled over all populations will be used.
Separately for each pharmacokinetic parameter, individual values of pl asma MK -0616 
AUC0 -inf and Cmax will be natural log- transformed and evaluated with a linear mixed -
effects model containing a fixed effect for populations. An unstructured covariance matrix 
will be used to allow for unequal population variances and to model the correlation between 
repeated measures (before and after HD) within each ESRD participant via the REPEATED 
statement in SAS PROC MIXED.
Ninety- five percent (95%) CIs for the least squares means for each population will be 
constructed on the natural log scale and will reference the t -distribution. Exponentiating the 
least-squares means and their corresponding 95% CIs will yield estimates for the population 
GMs and CIs about the GMs on the original scale.
To compare participants with RI in each of the rena l categories (moderate RI, severe RI, 
ESRD before HD and ESRD after HD) to matching participants with normal renal function, a 
2-sided 90% CI for the true difference in means (RI -normal renal function) will be 
calculated for each PK parameter (AUC0- inf and Cmax) using the mean square error from 
the model and referencing a t -distribution. For each of the RI populations, these confidence 
limits will be exponentiated to obtain the 90% CI for the true GMRs (RI/normal renal 
function) for each PK parameter.
The same approach will be used to address the secondary estimation objective. The extent to 
which MK -0616 is removed from plasma by HD will be evaluated with the difference in 
means (ESRD before HD –ESRD after HD), the geometric mean ratio (ESRD before 
HD/E
SRD after HD) and their 90% CIs.
A natural log transformation will be applied to AUC0- inf and Cmax. For each PK parameter, 
95% confidence intervals for the least squares means will be constructed on the natural log 
scale and will reference the t -distributi on. Exponentiating the least -squares means and their 
corresponding 95% CIs will yield estimates for the population GMs and CIs about the GMs 
on the original scale. A 2 -sided 90% CI for the true difference in means (before HD –after

HD) will be calculated f or each pharmacokinetic parameter (AUC0 -inf and Cmax) using the 
mean square error from the model and referencing a t -distribution. These confidence limits 
will be exponentiated to obtain the 90% confidence interval for the true ratio (GMR) of 
geometric mea ns (before HD/ after HD) for each PK parameter. A scatter plot of AUC0- inf 
and Cmax by renal function will also be provided.
Urine PK: MK -0616 Ae0- 24, Fe, and CLr following a single dose of MK -0616 administered 
to participants with moderate and severe rena l impairment and ESRD, will be estimated and 
compared to those estimated in healthy matched control participants.
Separately for each urine PK parameter, where possible, individual values of Ae0 -24, Fe and 
CLr will be natural log- transformed and evaluated with a linear fixed- effects model, which is 
described in the primary analysis. Ninety five percent CIs intervals for the least square means 
for each population will be constructed. To compare participants with varying degrees of RI 
(moderate, severe and ES RD) to matching participants with normal renal function, a 2 -sided 
90% CI for the true ratio of means (RI/normal renal function) will be calculated for each 
urine PK parameter (Ae0 -24, Fe and CLr).
9.1 Responsibility for Analyses
The statistical analysis of the data obtained from this study will be conducted by, or under the 
direct auspices of, t he Early Clinical Development Statistics Department in collaboration

9.4 Analysis Populations
The following populations are defined for the analysis and reporting of data. All participants 
will be reported, and their data analyzed, according to the treatment(s) they actuall y received.
9.4.1 All Participants as Treated (APaT) Population
The All Participants as Treated Population  consists of all participants who received at least 
one dose of treatment. This population will be used for assessments of safety and tolerability.
9.4.2 Per-Protocol (PP) Population
The Per -Protocol Population consists of the set of data generated by the subset of participants 
who comply with the protocol sufficiently to ensure that these data will be likely to exhibit 
the effects of treatment, according to the underlying scientific model. Compliance covers 
such considerations as exposure to treatment, availability of measurements and absence of 
important protocol deviations. Important protocol deviations will be identified to the extent 
possible prior to unblindi ng by individuals responsible for data collection/compliance, and its 
analysis and interpretation. Any participant or data value excluded from analysis will be 
identified, along with their reason for exclusion, in the CSR. At the end of the study, all 
participants who are compliant with the study procedure as aforementioned and have 
available data from at least one treatment will be included in the Per -Protocol dataset. This 
population will be used for the PK analyses.
9.5 Statistical Methods
9.5.1 Statistical Method s for Pharmacokinetic Analyses
If a different group of healthy matched control participants is needed to match the mean age

• Severe RI versus an appropriate group of healthy matched control participants;
• ESRD participants versus an appropriate group of healthy matched control participants.
If a single set of healthy matched control participants can be used for comparison with all RI 
and ESRD groups, the following analysis pooled over all populations will be used.
Separately for each pharmacokinetic parameter, individual values of plasma MK -0616 
AUC0 -inf and Cmax will be natural log- transformed and evaluated with a linear mixed -

10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Appendix 1: Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations
10.1.1 Code of Conduct for Interventional Clinical Trials
Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, Rahway, NJ, USA (MSD)
I.Introduction
A.Purpose
Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, Rahway, NJ, USA (MSD), through its subsidiaries, 
conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our 
products. As such, we are committed to designing, planning, conducting, analyzing, 
and reporting these trials in compliance with the highest ethical and scientific 
standards. Protection of participants in clinical trials is the ov erriding concern in the 
design and conduct of clinical trials. In all cases, MSD clinical trials will be 
conducted in compliance with MSD’s global standards, local and/or national 
regulations (including all applicable data protection laws and regulations), and 
International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) E6 and 
ICH General Considerations for Clinical Studies E8, and in accordance with the 
ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
B.Scope
Highest ethical and scientific standards shall be endorsed for all clinical 
interventional investigations sponsored by MSD irrespective of the party (parties) 
employed for their execution (e.g., contract research organizations, collaborative 
research efforts). This Code is not intended to apply to trials that are observational in 
nature, or which are retrospective. Further, this Code does not apply to investigator -
initiated trials, which are not under the full control of MSD.
II.Scientific Issues
A.Trial Conduct
1.Trial Design
Except for pilot or estimation trials, clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -
driven to assess safety, efficacy, and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic 
indices of MSD or comparator products. Alternatively, MSD may conduct 
outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint measures, or 
trials to determine patient preferences, etc.
The design (i.e., participant population, duration, statistical power) must be 
adequate to address the specific purpose of the trial and shall respect the data 
protection rights of all participants, trial site staff and, where applicable, third 
parties. Input may be considered from a broad range of stakeholders, including 
patient advocacy groups/patients representing the trial population, caregivers, and 
healthcare providers to ensure operational feasibility. Trial design also includes 
08NZV3
PRODUCT: MK-0616 81
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 020-01
MK-0616 -020-01FINAL PROTOCOL 10-AUG- 2023
proactive identification of critical to quality factors utilizing a risk -based 
approach. Plans are then developed to assess and mitigate risks to those factors as 
appropriate during the trial. All trial protocols are and will be assessed for the 
need and capability to enroll underrepresented groups. Participants must meet 
protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial.
2.Site Selection
MSD’s clinical trials are conducted globally in many different countries and in 
diverse populations, including people of varying age, race, ethnicity, gender, and 
accounting for other potential disease related factors. MSD selects investigative 
sites based on medic al expertise, access to appropriate participants, adequacy of 
facilities and staff, previous performance in clinical trials, as well as budgetary 
considerations. Prior to trial initiation, sites are evaluated by MSD personnel (or 
individuals acting on beha lf of MSD) to assess the ability to successfully conduct 
the trial. Individuals involved in trial conduct receive training commensurate with 
their role prior to their becoming involved in the trial.
Where appropriate, and in accordance with regulatory auth ority guidance, MSD 
will make concerted efforts to raise awareness of clinical trial opportunities in 
various communities. MSD will seek to engage underrepresented groups and 
those disproportionately impacted by the disease under study. MSD will support 
clinical trial investigators to enroll underrepresented groups and expand access to 
those who will ultimately use the products under investigation.
3.Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity
Investigative trial sites are monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol 
and Good Clinical Practice (GCP). MSD reviews clinical data for accuracy, 
completeness, and consistency. Data are verified versus source documentation 
according to standard operating procedures. Per MSD policies and procedures, if 
potential fraud, scientific/research misconduct, privacy incidents/breaches or 
Clinical Trial -related Significant Quality Issues are reported, such matters are 
investigated. When necessary, appropriate corrective and/or preventative actions 
are defined and regulator y authorities and/or ethics review committees are 
notified.
B.Publication and Authorship
Regardless of trial outcome, MSD commits to publish the primary and secondary 
results of its registered trials of marketed products in which treatment is assigned, 
according to the pre -specified plans for data analysis. To the extent scientifically 
appropriate, MSD seeks to publish the results of other analyses it conducts that are 
important to patients, physicians, and payers. Some early phase or pilot trials are 
intended to be hypothesis generating rather than hypothesis testing; in such cases, 
publication of results may not be appropriate since the trial may be underpowered and 
the analyses complicated by statistical issues such as multiplicity.
08NZV3
PRODUCT: MK-0616 82
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 020-01
MK-0616 -020-01FINAL PROTOCOL 10-AUG- 2023
MSD’s policy on autho rship is consistent with the recommendations published by the 
International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). In summary, 
authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and conduct of the 
trial, performance or interpretation o f the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript. 
All named authors must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. MSD 
funding of a trial will be acknowledged in publications.
III.Participant Protection
A.Regulatory Authority and Ethics Commit tee Review (Institutional Review Board 
[IRB]/Independent Ethics Committee [IEC])
All protocols and protocol amendments will be submitted by MSD for regulatory 
authority acceptance/authorization prior to implementation of the trial or amendment, 
in compliance with local and/or national regulations.
The protocol, protocol amendment(s), informed consent form, investigator’s 
brochure, and other relevant trial documents must be reviewed and approved by an 
IRB/IEC before being implemented at each site, in complia nce with local and/or 
national regulations and ICH Guidelines. Changes to the protocol that are required 
urgently to eliminate an immediate hazard and to protect participant safety may be 
enacted in anticipation of ethics committee approval. MSD will infor m regulatory 
authorities of such new measures to protect participant safety, in compliance with 
local and/or national regulations.
B.Safety
The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical trials is that participant welfare is 
of primary importance. Potential participants will be informed of the risks and 
benefits of, as well as alternatives to, trial participation. At a minimum, trial designs 
will take into account the local standard of care.
All participation in MSD clinical trials is voluntary. Participants enter the trial only 
after informed consent is obtained. Trial designs include procedures and systems for 
the identification, monitoring, and reporting of safety concerns. Participants may 
withdraw from an MSD trial at any time, without any influence on their access to, or 
receipt of, medical care that may otherwise be available to them.
During trial planning, the need for an independent Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC) is assessed. DMC review of data accumulated during the conduct of t he trial 
is integral to the well -being of trial participants.
C.Confidentiality
MSD is committed to safeguarding participant confidentiality, to the greatest extent 
possible, as well as all applicable data protection rights. Unless required by law, only 
the investigator, Sponsor (or individuals acting on behalf of MSD), ethics committee, 
and/or regulatory authorities will have access to confidential medical records that 
might identify the participant by name.
08NZV3
PRODUCT: MK-0616 83
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 020-01
MK-0616 -020-01FINAL PROTOCOL 10-AUG- 2023
D.Genomic Research
Genomic research will only be conducted in accordance with a protocol and informed 
consent authorized by an ethics committee.
E.Trial Results
At the time of providing informed consent and in accordance with local laws and 
regulations, participants should be informed about the plans for availability of trial 
results.
IV.Financial Considerations
A.Payments to Investigators
Clinical trials are time -and labor -intensive. It is MSD’s policy to compensate 
investigators (or the sponsoring institution) in a fair manner for the work p erformed 
in support of MSD trials. MSD does not pay incentives to enroll participants in its 
trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challenging, additional payments 
may be made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts.
MSD doe s not pay for participant referrals. However, MSD may compensate 
referring physicians for time spent on medical record review and medical evaluation 
to identify potentially eligible participants.
B.Clinical Research Funding
Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by MSD, and that the 
investigator or sponsoring institution is being paid or provided a grant for performing 
the trial. However, the local ethics committee may wish to alter the wording of the 
disclosure statement to be co nsistent with financial practices at that institution. As 
noted above, all publications resulting from MSD trials will indicate MSD as a source 
of funding.
C.Funding for Travel and Other Requests
Funding of travel by investigators and support staff (e.g., to scientific meetings, 
investigator meetings, etc) will be consistent with local guidelines and practices.
V.Investigator Commitment
Investigators will be expected to review MSD’s Code of Conduct as an appendix to the 
trial protocol, and in signing the protocol, agree to support these ethical and scientific 
standards.
10.1.2 Financial Disclosure
Financial disclosure requirements are outlined in the US Food and Drug Administration 
Regulations, Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators (21 CFR Part 54). It i s the 
Sponsor’s responsibility to determine, based on these regulations, whether a request for

10.2 Appendix 2: Clinical Laboratory Tests
•The tests detailed in Table 6will be performed by the local laboratory.
•Protocol -specific requirements for inclusion or exclusion of participants are detailed in 
Section 5 of the protocol.
•Additional tests may be performed at any time during the study as determined necessary 
by the investigator or required by local regulations.
•Because the glucose is part of the standard chemistry laboratory tests and requires fasting, 
participants should fast (approximately 8hours) prior to all chemistry laboratory 
collections. If the individual comes to the screening visit and is not fasting, a recheck 
may be needed at the discretion of the investigator and the participant may be asked to 
return at a later time for the safety laboratory collection.

10.3 Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
10.3.1 Definitions of Medication Error, Misuse, and Abuse
Medication e rror
This is an unintended failure in the drug treatment process that leads to or has the potential to 
lead to harm to the patient.
Misuse
This refers to si tuations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately used 
not in accordance with the terms of the product information.
Abuse
This corresponds to the persistent or sporadic intentional ,excessive use of a medicinal 
product for a perceiv ed psychological or physiological reward or desired nontherapeutic 
effect.
10.3.2 Definition of AE
AE definition
•An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not con sidered related to the 
study intervention.
•Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a study intervention.
•Note: For purposes of AE definition, study intervention includes any pharmaceutical 
product, biological product, vaccine, diagnostic agent, medical device, combination 
product, or protocol -specified procedure whether investigational or marketed (including 
placebo, active comparator product, or run -in intervention), manufactured by, licensed 
by, provided by, or distributed by the Sponsor for human use in this study.
Events meeting the AE definition
•Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical 
and scientific judgment of the investigato r.
•Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
08NZV3
PRODUCT: MK-0616 91
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 020-01
MK-0616 -020-01FINAL PROTOCOL 10-AUG- 2023
•New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication.
•For all reports of overdose (whether accidental or intentional) with an associated AE, the 
AE term should reflect the clinical symptoms or abnormal test result. An overdose 
without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results is reported using 
the terminol ogy “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”
•Any new cancer or progression of existing cancer.
Events NOT meeting the AE definition
•Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
•Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
•Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
•Surgical procedure(s) planned prior to informed consent to treat a preexisting condition 
that has not worsened.
•Refer to Section 8.4.6 for protocol -specific exceptions.
10.3.3 Definition of SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, the n it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met.
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
- The term “life- threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.
08NZV3
PRODUCT: MK-0616 92
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 020-01
MK-0616 -020-01FINAL PROTOCOL 10-AUG- 2023
c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
-Hosp italization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay, even 
if the hospitalization is a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: 
Hospitalization for an elective procedure to treat a preexisting condition that has not
worsened is not an SAE.) A preexisting condition is a clinical condition that is 
diagnosed prior to the use of an MSD product and is documented in the participant’s 
medical history.
d.Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
-The term di sability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.
-This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, infl uenza, 
and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) that may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
-In offspring of participant taking the product regardless o f time to diagnosis.
f.Other important medical events
-Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 
of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be 
considered serious.
-Examples of such eve nts include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias ,or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.
10.3.4 Additional E vents Reported
Additional events that require reporting
In addition to the above criteria, AEs meeting either of the below criteria, although not 
serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the Sponsor.
•Is a cancer .
•Is associated with an overdose .

10.3.5 Recording AE and SAE
AE and SAE recording
•When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to 
the event.
•The investigator will record all relevant AE/SAE information on the AE 
CRFs/worksheets at each examination.
•It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical 
records to the Sponsor in lieu of completion of the AE CRF page.
•There may be i nstances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by 
the Sponsor. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant 
number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records before submission to the 
Sponsor.
•The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Assessment of inten sity/toxicity
•An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, not when it is rated as severe.
•The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE (and oth er 
reportable safety event) reported during the study and assign it to 1 of the following 
categories:
-Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort, 
and not interfering with everyday activities (for pediatric studie s, awareness of 
symptoms, but easily tolerated).
-Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort to interfere with normal 
everyday activities (for pediatric studies, definitely acting like something is wrong).
-Severe: An event that prevents normal eve ryday activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category used for rating the 
intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe (for pediatric 
studies, extremely distressed or unable to d o usual activities).

Assessment of causality
•Did the study intervention cause the AE?
•The determination of the likelihood that the study intervention caused the AE will be 
provided by an investigator who is a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed /dated 
initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE 
form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed 
document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are 
intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a 
relationship between the test product and the AE based upon the available information.
•The following components are to be used to assess the rel ationship between the 
study intervention and the AE; the greater the correlation with the components and 
their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely the study 
intervention caused the AE:
-Exposure: Is there evidence that the participant was actually exposed to the study 
interventi onsuch as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (pill count, 
diary, etc), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in 
bodily specimen?
-Time Course: Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study intervention? Is the time of onset of the AE compatible 
with a drug -induced effect (applies to studies with investigational medicinal product)?
-Likely Cause: Is the AE no t reasonably explained by another etiology such as 
underlying disease, other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental factors.
-Dechallenge: Was the study intervention discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency 
reduced?
◦If yes, did the AE resolve or improve?
◦If yes, this is a positive dechallenge.
◦If no, this is a negative dechallenge.
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or permanent 
disability; (2) the AE resolved/improved despite continuation of the study 
interve ntion ; (3) the study is a single -dose drug study; or (4) study intervention (s) 
is/are only used 1 time.)
-Rechallenge: Was the participant reexposed to the study intervention in this study?
◦If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?
◦If yes, this is a positive rec hallenge.
◦Ifno, this is a negative rechallenge.
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or 
permanent disability; (2)the study is a single -dose drug study; or (3) study 
intervention (s) is/are used only 1 time.)
NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN AE THAT WAS SERIOUS AND 
MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE STUDY INTERVENTION, OR IF RE EXPOSURE 
TO THE STUDY INTERVENTION POSES ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT

RISK TO THE PARTICIPANT THEN THE RECHALLENGE MUST BE A PPROVED IN 
ADVANCE BY THE SPONSOR CLINICAL DIRECTOR, AND IF REQUIRED, THE 
IRB/IEC.
•Consistency with study intervention profile: Isthe clinical/pathological presentation of 
the AE consistent with previous knowledge regarding the study intervention or drug class 
pharmacology or toxicology?
•The assessment of relationship will be reported on the CRFs/worksheets by an 
investigator who is a qualified physician according to their best clinical judgment, 
including consideration of the above elements.
•Use the follo wing scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteria must be present to be 
indicative of a study intervention relationship).
-Yes, there is a reasonable possibility of study intervention relationship:
◦There is evidence of exposure to the study intervention. The temporal sequence of 
the AE onset relative to the administration of the study intervention is reasonable. 
The AE is more likely explained by the study intervention than by another cause.
-No, there is not a reasonable possibility of study intervention relationship:
◦Participant did not receive the study intervention OR temporal sequence of the AE 
onset relative to administration of the study intervention is not reasonable OR the 
AE is more likely explained by another cause than the study intervention. (Also 
entered for a participant with overdose without an associated AE.)
•The investigator must review and provide an assessment of causality for e ach AE/SAE
and document this in the medical notes.
•There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, it is very important 
that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor.
•The investigator may change their opinion of causality in light of follow -up information 
and send an SAE follow- up report with the updated causality assessment.
•The causality assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requi rements.
Follow -up of AE and SAE
•The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by Sponsor to 
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.
•New or updated information will be recorded in the CRF.

PRODUCT: MK-0616 96
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 020-01
MK-0616 -020-01FINAL PROTOCOL 10-AUG- 2023
•The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.
10.3.6 Reporting of AEs, SAEs, and Other Reportable Safety Events to the Sponsor
AE, SAE, and other reportable safety event reporting to Sponsor via electronic data 
collection tool
•The primary mechanism for reporting to the Sponsor will be the EDC tool.
-Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry guidelines (or 
equivalent).
-If the electronic system is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use 
the paper AE Reporting form.
-Reference Section 8.4.1 for reporting time requirements.
•The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available.
•After the study is completed at a given site, the EDC tool will be take n off- line to prevent 
the entry of new data or changes to existing data.
•If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data 
on a previously reported SAE after the EDC tool has been taken off -line, then the site can 
report this information on a paper SAE form or by telephone (see next section).
•Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator Study File Binder (or 
equivalent).
SAE reporting to the Sponsor via paper CRF
•If the EDC tool is not operational, fa csimile transmission or secure email of the SAE 
paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this information to the Sponsor.
•In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by 
telephone is acceptable with a copy of the SAE d ata collection tool sent by overnight 
mail or courier service.
•Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to 
complete and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time frames.
•Contacts and instructions f or SAE reporting and paper reporting procedures can be found 
in the Investigator Study File Binder (or equivalent).

10.5.1 Definitions
Participants of Nonchildbearing Potential ( PONCBP)
Participants assigned female sex at birth who are inthe following categories are not capable 
of becoming pregnant and, therefore, are considered PONCBP:
•Premenopausal with 1 of the following:
-Documented hysterectomy
-Documented bilateral salpingectomy
-Documented bilateral oophorectomy
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above (eg, Müllerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be 
applied to determining study entry.
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s revie w of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.
•Postmenopausal
-A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause.
◦A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in participants assigned female sex at birth not using 
hormonal contraception or HRT. However, in the absence of 12 months of 
amenorrhea, confirmation with 2 FSH measurements in the postmenopausal range 
is required.
-Participants assigned female sex at birth on HRT and whose menopausal status is in 
doubt must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before 
study enrollment.
Participants of Childbearing Potential ( POCBP)
A participant assigned female sex at birth is considered fertile following menarche and 
capable of becoming pregnant until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile 
(see below):
If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot 
be confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be 
considered.

Combined (estrogen -and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraceptionb
-Oral
-Intravaginal
-Transdermal
-Injectable
Progestogen -only hormonal contraceptionb
-Oral
-Injectable
Sexual Abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from penile -
vaginal intercourse with a partner capable of producing sperm, during the entire period of risk associated 
with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant .
Methods That Are Not Considered Highly Effective
Failure rate of >1% per year when used consistently and correctly.
Progesterone- only hormonal contraception where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of 
action
Penile/external or vaginal/internal condom with or without spermicided
Cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide
A combination of penile/external condom with either cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide 
(double barrier methods)
aTypical use failure rates are higher than perfect- use failure rates (ie, when used consistently and correctly)
bIf locally required, in accordance with CTFG guidelines, acceptable contraceptives are limited to those which inhibit 
ovulation
cIUS is a progestin releasing IUD
dVaginal/internal condom used for contraceptive purposes
Note: The following are not acceptable methods of contraception:
Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, postovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides 
only, and LAM
Penile/external and vaginal/internal condom should not be used together (due to risk of failure with friction)d

Research
1.Definitions
a.Biomarker: A biological molecule found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that is 
a sign of a normal or abnormal process or of a condition or disease. A biomarker may 
be used to see how well the body responds to a treatment for a disease or condition.1
b.Pharmacogenomics: The investigation of variations of DNA and RNA characteristics 
as related to drug/vaccine response.2
c.Pharmacogenetics: A subset of pharmacogenomics, pharmacogenetics is the influence 
of variations in DNA sequence on drug/vaccine response.2
d.DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid.
e.RNA: Ribonucleic acid.
2.Scope of Future Biomedical Research3, 4
The specimens consented and/or collected in this study as outlined in Section 8.9will be 
used in various experiments to understand :
-The biology of how drugs/vaccines work
-Biomarkers responsible for how a drug/vaccine enters and is removed by the body
-Other pathways with which drugs/vaccines may interact
-The biology of disease
The specimen(s) may be used for future assay development a nd/or drug/vaccine 
development.
It is now well recognized that information obtained from studying and testing clinical 
specimens offers unique opportunities to enhance our understanding of how individuals 
respond to drugs/vaccines, enhance our understandin g of human disease ,and ultimately 
improve public health through development of novel treatments targeted to populations 
with the greatest need. All specimens will be used by the Sponsor or those working for or 
with the Sponsor.
3.Summary of Procedures f or Future Biomedical Research3, 4
a.Participants for Enrollment
All participants enrolled in the clinical study will be considered for enrollment in 
future biomedical research.
b.Informed Consent
Informed consent for specimens (ie, DNA, RNA, protein, etc) will be obtained during 
screening for protocol enrollment from all participants, at a study visit by the 
investigator or his or her designate. Informed consent for future biomedical research 
should be presented to the participants on the visi t designated in the SoA. If delayed, 
present consent at next possible Participant Visit. Consent forms signed by the 
participant will be kept at the clinical study site under secure storage for regulatory 
reasons.

PRODUCT: MK-0616 102
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 020-01
MK-0616 -020-01FINAL PROTOCOL 10-AUG- 2023
A template of each study site’s approved i nformed consent will be stored in the 
Sponsor’s clinical document repository.
c.eCRF Documentation for Future Biomedical Research Specimens
Documentation of participant consent for future biomedical research will be captured 
in the eCRFs. Any specimens for which such an informed consent cannot be verified 
will be destroyed.
d.Future Biomedical Research Specimen(s)
Collection of specimens for future biomedical research will be performed as outlined 
in the SoA. In general, if additional blood specimens are being collected for future 
biomedical research, these will usually be obtained at a time when the participant is 
having blood drawn for other study purposes.
4.Confidential Participant Information for Future Biomedical Research3, 4
In order to optimize t he research that can be conducted with future biomedical research 
specimens, it is critical to link participants ’clinical information with future test results. In 
fact, little or no research can be conducted without connecting the clinical study data to 
the specimen. The clinical data allow specific analyses to be conducted. Knowing 
participant characteristics like sex, age, medical history ,and intervention outcomes is
critical to understanding clinical context of analytical results.
To maintain privacy of information collected from specimens obtained for future 
biomedical research, the Sponsor has developed secure policies and procedures. All 
specimens will be single coded per ICH E15 guidelines as described below.
At the clinical study site, unique codes will be placed on the future biomedical research 
specimens. This code is a random number thatdoes not contain any personally 
identifying information embedded within it. The link (or key) between participant 
identifiers and this unique code will be held a t the study site. No personal identifiers will 
appear on the specimen tube.
5.Biorepository Specimen Usage3, 4
Specimens obtained for the Sponsor will be used for analyses using good scientific 
practices. Analyses using the future biomedical research spe cimens may be performed by 
the Sponsor, or an additional third party (eg, a university investigator) designated by the 
Sponsor. The investigator conducting the analysis will follow the Sponsor’s privacy and 
confidentiality requirements. Any contracted thir d-party analyses will conform to the 
specific scope of analysis outlined in future biomedical research protocol and consent. 
Future biomedical research specimens remaining with the third party after specific 
analysis is performed will be reported to the Sponsor.
6.Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Research3, 4
Participants may withdraw their consent for FBR and ask that their biospecimens not be 
used for FBR. Participants may withdraw consent at any time by contacting the study 
investigator. If medical records for the study are still available, the investigator will 
contact the Sponsor using the designated mailbox 
08NZV3
PRODUCT: MK-0616 103
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 020-01
MK-0616 -020-01FINAL PROTOCOL 10-AUG- 2023
(clinical.specimen.management@ MSD .com). Subsequently, the participant's specimens 
will be flagged in the biorepository and restricted to study u se only. If specimens were 
collected from study participants specifically for FBR, these specimens will be removed 
from the biorepository and destroyed. Documentation will be sent to the investigator 
confirming withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the 
investigator to inform the participant of completion of the withdrawal and/or destruction, 
if applicable. Any analyses in progress at the time of request for withdrawal/destruction 
or already performed before the request be ing received by the Sponsor will continue to be 
used as part of the overall research study data and results. No new analyses would be 
generated after the request is received.
If the medical records for the study are no longer available (eg, if the investigator is no 
longer required by regulatory authorities to retain the study records) or the specimens 
have been completely anonymized, there will no longer be a link between the 
participant’s personal information and their specimens. In this situation, the re quest for 
withdrawal of consent and/or destruction cannot be processed.
7.Retention of Specimens3, 4
Future biomedical research specimens will be stored in the biorepository for potential 
analysis for up to 20 years from the end of the study. Specimens may be stored for longer 
if a regulatory or governmental authority has active questions that are being answered. In 
this special circumstance, specimens will be stored until these questions have been 
adequately addressed.
Specimens from the study site will be shipped to a central laboratory and then shipped to 
the Sponsor -designated biorepository. If a central laboratory is not used in a particular 
study, the study site will ship directly to the Sponsor -designated biorepository. The 
specimens will be stored under strict supervision in a limited access facility ,which 
operates to assure the integrity of the specimens. Specimens will be destroyed according 
to Sponsor policies and procedures and this destruction will be documented in the 
biorepository database.
8.Data Security3, 4
Databases containing specimen information and test results are accessible only to the 
authorized Sponsor representatives and the designated study administrator research 
personnel and/or collaborators. Database user authentication is highly secure, and is 
accomplished using network security policies and practices based on international 
standards to protect against unauthorized access.
9.Reporting of Future Biomedical Research Data to Participants3, 4
No information obtained from exploratory laboratory studies will be reported to the 
participant, family, or physicians. Principle reasons not to inform or return results to the 
participant include lack of relevance to participant health, limitations of predictive 
capabil ity, and concerns regarding misinterpretation.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 020-01
MK-0616 -020-01FINAL PROTOCOL 10-AUG- 2023
If important research findings are discovered, the Sponsor may publish results, present 
results in national meetings, and make results accessible on a public website in order to 
rapidly report this information to doctors and participants. Participants will not be 
identified by name in any published reports about this study or in any other scientific 
publication or presentation.
10. Future Biomedical Research Study Population3, 4
Every effort will be made to re cruit all participants diagnosed and treated on Sponsor 
clinical studies for future biomedical research.
11.Risks Versus Benefits of Future Biomedical Research3, 4
For future biomedical research, risks to the participant have been minimized and are 
descr ibed in the future biomedical research informed consent.
The Sponsor has developed strict security, policies, and procedures to address participant 
data privacy concerns. Data privacy risks are largely limited to rare situations involving 
possible breach o f confidentiality. In this highly unlikely situation, there is risk that the 
information, like all medical information, may be misused.

10.10 Appendix 10: Algorithm for Assessing Out of Range Laboratory Values
For all laboratory values obtained at prestudy (screening) visit and/or predose evaluation:
A.If all protocol -specified laboratory values are normal, the participant may enter the study.
B.If a protocol -specified laboratory value is outside the parameter(s) outlined in the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria (including repeat sif performed), the participant will be 
excluded from the study.
C.If ≥1 protocol -specified laboratory value not specified in the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
is outside the normal range, the following choices are available:
-The abnormal test may be repea ted (refer to items below for continuation of 
algorithm for repeated values).
◦If the repeat test value is within the normal range, the participant may enter the 
study.
◦If the repeat test value is still abnormal, the study investigator will evaluate the 
potential participant with a complete history and physical examination, looking 
especially for diseases that could result in the abnormal laboratory value in 
question. If such diseases can be ruled out, and if the abnormal laboratory value is 
not clinically r elevant, then the participant may enter the study.
D.If there is any clinical uncertainty regarding the significance of an abnormal value, the 
participant will be excluded from the study.

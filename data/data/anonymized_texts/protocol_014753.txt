2. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROU ND 
 
Wire localization (WL) has been the standard localization technique for guiding 
surgical excision of non -palpable breast lesions for over 20 years (1-3 ). It is effective in 
localizing the intended target with failure rates between 1 -6.7% (4- 6) but it carries risks 
inherent in the technique of placing a wire into a patient’s breast. For one, a portion of 
the wire must reside outside of the breast so the surgeon can use the trajectory of the 
wire to guide the surgical resection . In this case, the wire can be inadvertently dislodged 
at any point following the wire placement and before  the ultimate wire removal in the 
operating room (7) . Also, given its external component, the WL procedure must be 
                LOCALIZER003  STUDY PROTOCOL  
 
Page 5 of 22 
 performed on the same day of surgery , which can delay  surgical start times and impede 
operating room efficiency . 
 
The WL procedure is performed by the breast radiologist in the Imaging Center on 
the morning of surgery. The procedure is performed under local anesthesia in either the 
upright, supine or prone position, depending on the lesion location and the method of 
image guidance for wire insertion.  Patients arrive at the facility on an empty stomach 
given that they are having surgery that same day. It is not uncommon for patients to 
experience lightheadedn ess and become vasovagal from the localization procedure.   
Despite these  inconveniences for patients , WL has remained the primary method for 
localizing non -palpable breast lesions for surgery  for both benign and malignant disease.  
 With s creening mammography , the rates at which breast cancers are being 
diagnosed at a non -palpable, early stage has grown considerably, increasing the number 
of breast cancers that requir e image-guidance for excision. Although WL remains the 
most utilized method for localizing no n-palpable breast cancers, the rate s of positive 
margins varies widely with this approach ranging from 12 -60% (8-10). Given this and the 
technical difficulties associated with WL, alternatives have been sought  that may 
improve outcome  for patients with breast c ancer treated with  breast conservation 
surgery.  
 
Radioactive  seed localization (RSL) has emerged as an alternate and possibly more 
favorable option for localization and has been a widely studied  alternative . Unlike the 
wire, the radioactive seed is implanted entirely within the breast and this can be performed at any time within 5  days of surgery . Studies have demonstrated the 
effectiveness of RSL in appropriately targeting the lesion for removal ( 10,11). In 
addition, RSL appea rs to equal if not improve the negative margin rate and re- excision 
rate for lumpectomies for breast cancer compared to WL ( 12-14) . Nonetheless, RSL has 
not been easy to adopt given the regulations necessary to manage and track the radioactive seeds , the s pecial licensing necessary for handling radioactive material,  and 
the coordination necessary between the different departments .  
Other alternatives for lesion localization are  under active investigation. A magnetic 
seed called the Magseed is currently being evaluated in a clinical trial at MD Anderson (Clinicaltrials.gov) . Preliminary concerns include difficulty with the large size of the 
probe compared to incision size for seed detection and the interference from the metal 
surgical instruments which are used during surgery. In addition, presence of the magnetic seed is a contraindication for the higher power 3T MRI’s used to evaluate 
breast lesions and may impose significant artifact if used with the 1.5T MRI’s.  For these 
reasons, we are seeking an alternative for lesion localization.

 Our proposed study is a pilot study to evaluate  a recently FDA-approved 
radiofrequency tag for Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)  of non -palpable breast 
lesions for surgery. RFID technology is already widely used outside of medicine, most 
commonly in the microchip  for pet identification . The radiofrequency tag (or microchip) 
is passive and  has no internal energy source unlike the radioactive seed. The LOCalizer 
probe used to read the tag  in the operating room emits a  signal that then completes a 
circuit with the tag that allows for localization and detection. Similar to the radioactive 
seed and unlike the wire, the RFID tag is inserted completely within the breast allowing 
uncoupling of the localization procedure from the day of  surgery . But, unlike the 
radioactive seed, there is no concern for signal decay so the RFID tag can be inserted up 
to 30 days prior to surgery. This allows for more flexible scheduling for tag insertion and 
allows for scheduling o f surgeries for  first case start times, improving overall operating 
room efficiency . Also, since the RFID tag is not radioactive, it does not require special 
handling and tracking. And, unlike any other localization method currently avai lable, 
RFID with th e LOCalizer can read distan ce in millimeters from the tag, which in theory 
will help guide surgical dissection and possibly reduce rates of positive margins.  
 
Radiofrequency technology has been approved by the FDA for implantation in 
humans for purposes of identification. Further studies have expanded this technology for use as a localization method as well. In the medical field, RFID tags have been evaluated for their use in  guiding  positioning of endotracheal tubes for intubation (15 ) 
and locating surgic al sponges in body cavities (16 ). Proof of concept studies have also 
been performed demonstrating the feasibility of using RFID tech nology for localizing 
tumors (17 ). 
 A prospective clinical study evaluating the safety of RFID technology  for localization 
of non-palpable lesions in the breast  was performed  at Harbor UCLA (18 ). In this safety 
analysis study, 20 patients underwent both wire placement and radiofrequency tag insertion for the localization of non- palpable breast lesions. T he radiofrequency tag wa s 
successfully identified in vivo  with the LOCalizer device and the tag and targeted lesion s 
were  removed successfully in all 20 patients. All cases were performed with IRB 
approval as a N on-Significant Risk device.   
 We believe that a pilot study evaluating this new t echnology without concomitant 
placement of a wire is necessary to ensure that surgeons can successfully use RFID 
technology alone t o locate  non-palpable breast lesions. In addition, a preliminary 
assessment of patient experience  and ph ysician experience, evaluation of positive 
margin rates for malignant lesions and determination of volume of tissue removed 
would be helpful for initial evaluation of this technology as a non -inferior alternative to 
WL. Results from this study will i nform study design for a larger prospective institutional 
study.

3. STRATEGY  
 
We plan to enroll 5 0 patients with non -palpable breast lesions that require surgical 
removal through the UCLA Health System . The patients may have a diagnosis of breast 
cancer and be u ndergoing a lumpectomy or they may have a benign lesion requiring 
localization for surgical excisional biopsy. Patients will undergo image -guided placement 
of the radiofrequency tag  by our breast radiologists by either mammographic or 
sonographic guidance within 30 days of surgery rather than a wire localization on the 
morning of surgery. The RFID tag will be provided at no cost to the patient. The patients 
will undergo surgery as planned and the surgeons will  use a handheld device (LOCalizer) 
to localize t he tag during surgery .  Retrieval of the marker will be confirmed by  
specimen radiograph y performed per standard protocol at the time of surgery. Three 
breast surgeons will be participating and enrolling through 2 UCLA sites.

Page 9 of 22 
 6. STUDY PROCEDURE  
 
a) Questionnaires : Each subject will complete a  patient  questionnaire 
(attachment 12.1) following placement of the radiofrequency tag. The 
questionnaires will be completed in a private room immediately following the procedure and no later than 24 hours. The questionnaires will be 
labeled with the unique patient identifying number so that clin ical outcome 
can be associated with patient reported outcome for data analysis.  The 
radiologist will also complete a questionnaire (attachment 12. 2) following 
placement of the marker, and the surgeon will complete a questionnaire (attachment 12.3) followi ng the breast surgery.  
         7.   DATA MANAGEMENT AND EVALUATION  
 7.1 Sample Size Determination 
 
Sample size for this pilot study was selected at 50 patients. Since this is not a 
comparative study, the sample size is based on the width of the confidence interval, not power. Our primary outcomes are successful placement and successful retrieval of the RFID tag. We anticipate 100% success for both 
outcomes. Assuming this is true, a sample size of n=50 allows establishment of 
the lower 95% confidence bound a t 94.2%.  
 The sample size is also b ased on pragmatics of recruitment and patient flow and 
budgetary constraints. This is a pilot study to determine feasibility of patient 
recruitment for a larger study, implementation of a new FDA-cleared device, and modification of the logistics of the study protocol.

 For binary outcomes, exact confidence bounds will be reported for all proportions . For the three Likert questionnaires, a total score will be computed 
for each and summa ry statistics (mean, median, range, proportion who are 
1,2,3,4,5) will be reported for the total score and for each item as well as confidence bounds for the median or mean.  
 
7.3 Safety Analysis of Individual Adverse Experience Reporting  
 
The procedure involved in placing the radiofrequency  marker  for the research 
study will b e included in the safety analysis for adverse event reporting by the 
participant. All adverse events due to these procedures will be recorded and reported to the IRB.  
 Image -guided localization is standard for localizing breast lesions that are not 
palpable and that require surgical removal. The most common localizing device is a hooked wire. We are studying a radiofrequency  marker  as an alternative . 
The pa tient and/or h er insurance will  be billed for the standard of care 
procedure of insertion of the localizing device, the localization mammogram, the specimen mammogram and the surgery  but there will be no cost to the 
patient or her insurance for the RFID tag  itself .  
 Some r isks associated with the localization procedure (regardless of the device 
placed) include pain, bruising, bleeding, swelling , infecti on, lightheadedn ess and 
dizziness . Less common risks include implant rupture, pneumothorax 
(punctured/collapsed lung) or movement (migration) of the marker after placement and before surgery.  The placement of marker may not be successful 
due to inadequate visualization of the abnormality or difficult location of the 
abnormality (too close to the skin surface or too deep in the breast) which precludes safe and accurate placement of the marker. In this case, if placement 
of the standard wire is also considered technically impossible then the breast imager and surgeon will discuss alternatives for lesion localization, such a s 
intraoperative ultrasound localization, placement of skin marker, etc. such as is standard protocol when wire placement is unsuccessful.  
 Failure in this study is defined as inability to localize the lesion with the RFID tag but successful localization with the wire. If both approaches are unsuccessful 
then this would reflect an ability to localize the lesion in general, which is a risk 
of image-guided localizations but not a failure of the tag itself. In the case of defined failure, the patient will req uire a second procedure for wire placement 
prior to surgery.  Failure would also be defined as inability to retrieve the tag 
and/or the lesion. In this case, the patient would require a second localization 
procedure and surgery.  
 
The risks from participation in this study are minimal. Participation is voluntary 
and participants can withdraw any  time after consent but prior to placement of 
the research device without fear of any change in medical treatment.  
 
                LOCALIZER003  STUDY PROTOCOL  
 
Page 11 of 22 
 An interval analysis will be performed after enro llment of the first 20 patients to 
ensure that the radiologists are able to successfully place the device for 
appropriate lesion localization, surgeons are able to successfully retrieve the 
device, and pati ents do not experience significant adverse side ef fects from 
placement of the tag . 
 The assessment of safety will be based primarily on the frequency of AE’s. The 
research device will most likely be placed within 7 days of surgery but can be 
placed on the morning of surgery out to 30 days prior to surgery . The patient 
will be contacted by study personnel on the day following device insertion (unless within 24 hours of surgery) to inquire about adverse events and an AE report form will be completed (attachment 12.4). A follow -up visit within 2 
weeks of surg ery will also occur and will be the final study visit.  
 This study will involve two sites, and study personnel will be notified immediately regarding any documented AE’s or concerns that impact patient safety or continuation of the study.  
 Given the low risk of this study, there is no anticipated toxicity.  
 
7.4 Data Collection  
 
All subjects will be assigned a unique identifying number upon signing their 
consent. All data will be identified using this number. No data will be collected or stored attached to any identifying information.  P ersonal/medical history 
data will be kept unidentified according to HIPAA. Personal information and the 
codes associated with the personal information w ill be maintained in a 
password protected file by the PI, on her comput er that is password protected 
and located in a secure office with limited access. The random unique number will be used to identify subjects in all electronic spreadsheet collating results.  
 
7.5 Privacy and Confidentiality  
 
No information that identifies a subject will be released without separate consent except as specifically required by law. Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the 
Health Insurance Portabil ity and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and in 
accordance with all institutional review board requirements, and all applicable 
policies of the institution . Participants will be assigned a unique study 
identification number which will be the only marker attached to their data 
collection forms. Participants will complete questionnaires in the privacy of a closed room . Only the PI will have access to the key linking names and contact 
information with the primary and complete set of data collected, by study 
identification number, and this key will be kept in a password protected computer file. All paper records for individual participants will be coded as noted above, handled with privacy and confidentiality in mind, and kept in a 
locked file cabinet in the PI’s office. All participant identifiers are removed from 
                LOCALIZER003  STUDY PROTOCOL

 2 PRECIS 
 
Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) are a gro up of lymphoproliferative disorders characterized by 
localization of neoplastic T cells to the skin at pres entation. Mycosis fungoides (MF) and its leukemic variant 
Sezary syndrome (SS) are the most prevalent forms of CTCL. While early stage MF is restricted to patches 
and plaques involving the skin, most patients eventually develop cutaneous tumors, generalized erythroderma, 
or dissemination to peripheral blood, lymph nodes or vi sceral organs. Currently existing therapy of tumor-
stage and disseminated CTCL is palliative, with most patients dying within 1-5 years. The presence of CD8+ 
cells in close proximity to dermal neoplastic infiltrates in early stages of the disease, and the clinical response 
seen with some immunomodulatory agents suggests that CTCL may be potential targets for immunotherapy-
based interventions. 
 
Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a curative treatment modality successfully employed in a number of 
hematologic malignancies. The curative effect of this approach is in part mediated by donor-derived T 
lymphocytes with reactivity for patient leukemic cells. The power of this graft versus leukemia effect (GVL) 
is best illustrated in patients with relapsed Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) after an allogeneic bone 
marrow transplant, in whom a single donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) can induce remission. We hypothesize 
that neoplastic T cells in MF/SS may similarly be susceptible to a graft vs. tumor (GVT) effect. 
Unfortunately, advanced patient age and a 25% to 35% risk of transplant related mortality (TRM) preclude 
the use of conventional “dose - intensive” a llogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) in 
patients with advanced CTCL who might otherwise benefit from this approach. The risk of TRM related to 
conditioning can be circumvented at least partially by using a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen to 
prepare the patient for transplantation. 
 
In this study, we will treat male and non-pregnant female subjects between the ages of 18 and 70 years (both 
inclusive) suffering from advanced MF/SS with an al logeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant 
from an HLA-matched family donor or an HLA matche d (10/10 allele level match) unrelated donor. A low 
intensity, nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen employing the anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody Campath-
1H (alemtuzumab) and fludarabine will be used to  induce host immunosuppression to facilitate donor 
hematopoietic and lymphoid engraftment. We antici pate minimal host myelosuppression and consequently 
reduced early transplant toxicity with this conditio ning regimen. Immune and hematopoietic reconstitution 
will be achieved by infusion of unmanipulated donor-derived granulocyte colony stimulation factor (G-CSF) 
mobilized peripheral blood stem cells. Infusions of donor lymphocytes in incremental doses will be used to 
promote engraftment or disease regression when indicated. Cyclosporine A (CSA) will be used as prophylaxis 
against graft vs. host disease (GVHD), with dose adjustments made as necessary to favor complete donor 
chimerism and disease regression.  
 
A total of up to 25 subjects (transplant recipients) will be treated on this protocol. The primary end point of 
this study is efficacy (proportion of subjects achieving a complete response). Other end points include 
assessment of donor-host chimerism in various hematopoi etic and lymphoid cells, overall response, incidence 
of acute and chronic GVHD, graft failure, assessment of lymphoid subset reconstitution, transplant related 
morbidity and mortality and disease-free and overall su rvival and the outcomes of transplantation by the 
donor type (related vs. unrelated).

2. BACKGROUND 
 
2.1 Introduction 
 
Although MF/SS is a relatively rare neoplasm, the disease appears to be on the increase, with a 3.2 
fold increase being observed between 1973 and 1984 [1-3]. The majority of the patients are between 
40 and 60 years of age and the disease is more common in males (M: F =2.2:1) and African 
Americans. 
 
The disease often presents as an indolent dermatologic affliction which may go unrecognized for 
years. Characteristically, MF evolves through several clinical stages. The earliest stage is the patch 
phase typified by the presence of scaly, erythematous patches, which evolve into plaques and then 
into ulcerated or exophytic tumors with progressivel y more neoplastic infiltration. Sezary syndrome is 
characterized by the presence of large, atypical lymphocytes with cerebriform nuclei in the peripheral 
circulation, often accompanied by generalized er ythroderma. Extracutaneous involvement becomes 
evident as the stage or extent of MF increases,  with lymph nodes, spleen, lung and liver being 
involved most often. Bone marrow involvement occurs in later stages, being less common than 
visceral and lymph node involvement. 
 
The malignant cell in MF/SS is of T-cell origin [4]. MF cells characteristically express the pan-T cell 
markers CD2, CD3 and CD5 [5-9]. The early T cell marker, CD7 is present in a third of cases [10]. 
The vast majority of the malignant cells are of the CD45+RO+CD4+ phenotype [8-11]. These cells 
also express a skin homing signal called cuta neous lymphoid antigen (CLA) [12]. Approximately 
50% of cases express CD25 [13], an observation that has led to the evaluation of targeted 
immunotherapeutic approaches against this antigen. Expression of CD52 (the target of the 
monoclonal antibody Campath) by the malignant cells has not been widely studied, but 7/7 patients 
with SS expressed CD52 in one analysis [14] as did 3/3 patients in another analysis [15].

The prognosis of MF patients is stage-depende nt (Section 19, Tables 1 and 2), with stage Ia 
patients exhibiting virtually norm al life expectancies [16, 17]. Patients who progress to the 
tumor or erythrodermic phase, and those with  lymph node or peripheral blood involvement 
(SS), or visceral metastases, however, are consid ered incurable. These patients often undergo 
a series of palliative treatments, eventually dyin g from their disease or related complications 
[16-18]. Five-year survival rates for stages IIb to IVb range from 10-50% [1,2,17,18], and in 
one series of 152 patients, those with visc eral disease or lymph node effacement had a 
median survival of 2.5 years [19]. 
 
2.2 Current therapies for MF/SS 
 
2.2.1 Skin Directed Therapy 
 
Topical Chemotherapy  with either mechlorethamine or carmustine (BCNU) is effective in controlling 
disease in patch or plaque- stage disease. Overall response rates of 88% and complete response (CR) 
rates of 51% for T1 disease and 70% overall response and 26% CR rates for T2 disease was reported 
in one series of patients by Hoppe et al [20]. This therapy is relatively safe and results in long-term 
remissions in 10-15% of patients with early stage disease [21]. 
 
Total Skin Electron Beam Therapy (TSEBT) results in a 56% to 96% CR rate in patients with stage Ia 
to IIa disease. However, relapse free survival for stage Ib and above is only 16% at 10 years [22, 23]. 
TSEBT is also an excellent palliative option for patients with diffuse involvement with thick plaques 
or tumors and for those with generalized erythroderma. In patients with T3 or T4 disease, disease free 
survival and overall survival at 5 years is 20% a nd 50% respectively [24]. Use of adjuvant systemic 
chemotherapy after TSEBT appears to prolong disease-free survival (DFS) without impacting on 
overall survival [25]. However, a preliminary study of  the use of photopheresis in an adjuvant setting 
in T3 and T4 patients achieving a CR with TSEBT has shown promise and is being further 
investigated [26,27]. 
  
PUVA therapy  consists of ingestion of 8-methoxypsoral en followed by exposure to UV radiation. 
Stage-dependant response rates of 60% to 95% have been reported with this therapy [28]. 
 
2.2.2 Systemic Therapies 
 
Systemic Chemotherapy is used as palliation for patients with relapsed or refractory disease following 
treatment with skin directed therapies or for patients with advanced disease at presentation. Single 
agent therapy with several agents including methotrexate, glucocorticoids, nitrogen mustard, 
cyclophosphamide, cisplatin and the purine analogs (2-deoxycoformycin, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, 
and fludarabine) has been studied. Short lived remissions ranging from 30% to 50% have been 
reported with these agents [29-33]. 
 
The Interferons : Alpha interferon has been used with fair success. In previously untreated patients, 
doses between 3,000,000 units/day to 15,000,000 units/day have yielded response rates of around 
80% [34, 35]. In contrast, previously treated pati ents showed objective response rates of 45-64%, 
although these responses were short-lived (mean durations of 4.5 to 5.5 months) [35]. Other cytokines 
such as IL-2 have resulted in short-liv ed responses in small case series [2].

 6 Retinoids are vitamin A derivatives with antiproliferative and differentiating effects in several 
malignancies. Molin et al have reported on a series of 28 patients with MF/SS undergoing therapy 
with oral retinoids; a response rate of 68% was observed, although most responses were of short 
duration [36]. 
 
Ontak is a fusion protein that combines active componen ts of the diphtheria toxin with recombinant 
IL-2, thus targeting cells expressing CD25. A phase III trial of this drug in heavily pretreated patients 
with CTCL demonstrated an overall response rate of 30%, with a median duration of response of 
around 7 months [37]. 
 
Photopheresis involves ingestion of 8 methoxypsoralen, fo llowed by isolation and UVA radiation of 
the mononuclear fraction, and is believed to act by both direct toxic effects on neoplastic T cells and 
by inducing cytotoxic T cells against malignant T ce lls via stimulation of antigen presenting cells. 
Edelson et al. [38] reported a 73% response rate using this approach in patients refractory to previous 
therapies. This cohort of patients, consisting larg ely of T4 patients with SS, has a reported median 
survival of 60 months, compared with a median survival of 30 months in stage-matched historic 
controls. This study, however, did not require genoty pic evidence of clonality in peripheral blood T 
cells to make a diagnosis of SS; in fact, when this issue was addressed in a retrospective comparison 
of patients treated with photopheresis vs untreated controls, the survival advantage vanished [39]. 
This modality is currently being investig ated in combination with chemotherapy. 
 
Alemtuzumab has been used in the treatment of both advanced MF and the Sezary syndrome. Several 
recent reports detail the results in small groups of patients treated with this monoclonal antibody. 
Foukanelli et al. [40] treated three patients with SS  resistant to prior single agent chemotherapy, all of 
whom experienced clinical responses (2CRs and 1PR) of varying durations (3-27 months). Ferrajoli 
et al [41] treated 68 patients with refractory hematologic malignancies expressing CD52. 2/6 CTCL 
patients treated in this study were reported to have undergone a partial remission. A third study, by 
Lundin et al [42], reported that 4 of 8 patients with MF/SS showed disease regression (2 cutaneous 
CRs and 2 PRs). Based on these data, alemtuzumab appears to have clinical efficacy in MF/SS, 
although larger studies are required to define its role in the management of these malignancies. 
 
Cyclosporine A (CSA):  The anti-proliferative effects of cyclosporine on T-cells make it an attractive 
option in T-cell malignancies. However, in clinical studies of refractory MF/SS patients, less than a 
third obtained a partial remission [43-45]. 
  
In summary, although several skin-directed and systemic therapies exist for MF/SS, these are largely 
palliative and have little impact on survival of patients with advanced CTCL. 
 
2.3 MF/SS as a potential target for immunotherapy 
 
Several lines of evidence suggest that immune mech anisms may play a significant role in the control 
of MF/SS. First, the presence of CD8+ T cells in epidermal infiltrates in close proximity to neoplastic 
T cells suggests that these tumor infiltrating T cells may contribute to immune surveillance against 
the tumor [46]. Consistent with this hypothesis are the observations that the circulating CD4+/CD8+ 
ratio is often inverted with advancing disease, particularly in those patients with SS, and that the 
proportion of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ cells diminishes with progression of cutaneous disease [47]. 
The observation by Hoppe et al. [46] that within each T stage, survival correlates positively with the 
proportion of infiltrating T cells lends further credence to the hypothesis that immune mechanisms 
may play a critical role in disease progression. Second, a study of Langerhans’ cells by Meissner et al. 
[48] revealed that increased density of these potent antigen-presenting cells in tumor infiltrates 
02-H-0250

Georg Aue, M.D. December 28, 2017
 7 correlated with a better prognosis. Third, cytoki ne therapies used to enhance cellular immune 
responses have yielded clinical responses, albeit short-lived, in 40-80% of CTCL patients [49]. 
Lastly, recent case reports of clinical remission of refractory CTCL following allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation provide evidence for the existenc e of a graft vs. CTCL effect [50-52]. The most 
impressive of these reports details 5 patients with refractory CTCL (4 patients with SS and 1 patient 
with MF), all of whom achieved a CR after undergoing an allogeneic PBSC transplant from 6/6 HLA-
matched sibling (4/5) or unrelated (1/5) donors [52].  
 
2.4 Allogeneic stem cell transplantation as immunotherapy 
 
The potent antitumor effects associated with allogeneic  stem cell transplantation are largely due to the 
generation of graft vs. tumor effects mediated by hos t T cells. The existence of a graft vs. malignancy 
effect was first elucidated in patients with leukemias who were cured after an allogeneic 
transplantation, and is supported by several lines of evidence: 1) The observation that patients 
developing moderate to severe GVHD had lower relapse rates than those who did not develop GVHD 
[53,54] 2) Higher rates of leukemic relapse in CML patients receiving T-cell depleted as opposed to 
T-cell replete grafts [54-57] 3) Higher rates of CML relapse in recipients of syngeneic transplants 
when compared with those receiving transplants from HLA-matched non-twin siblings [54] 4) 
Complete and durable PCR remission of relapsed CML in 70-80% of patients treated with a single, 
unmanipulated, donor lymphocyte infusion [58]  5) Complete remission of EBV-associated 
lymphoproliferative disorder with a single infusion of donor derived lymphocytes [59,60]. 
 
These observations are further strengthened by durable clinical remissions seen in patients with other 
malignancies, including non- Hodgkin’s lymphoma and multiple myeloma, who undergo allogeneic  
bone marrow transplantation (BMT) [61-65]. An und erlying alloimmune mechanism is inferred in 
these patients from temporal relations between immune manipulations (such as withdrawal of 
cyclosporine, donor lymphocyte infusions) and disease regression. More recently, non-myeloablative 
peripheral blood stem cell transplants, which utilize allogeneic graft vs. tumor effects rather than high 
dose chemotherapy as the basis for tumor eradication, have demonstrated success in both hematologic 
[66-68] and solid malignancies [69-71]. Our recent study showing disease regression in patients with 
metastatic renal cell carcinoma following nonmyeloablative PBSCT amply supports the arguments 
favoring the existence of a graft vs. solid tumor ef fect [69]. Patients in this study had responses 
associated with withdrawal of cyclosporine, donor lymphocyte infusions, acute graft vs. host disease, 
and other immune manipulations such as treatment with D-interferon, IL-2 and GM-CSF 
(unpublished data). Laboratory data suggest that these responses are mediated at least in part by CD8 
lymphocytes derived from the donor and directed against shared minor histocompatibility antigens 
and/or against tumor specific antigens. 
 
Most updated data from Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) 
and European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) provided a clearer picture of 
the value of allogeneic HCT as a therapeutic stra tegy for high-risk patients with advanced-stage 
MF/SS [99-100]. In particular, a large CIBMTR seri es with 129 cases of MF/SS reported an OS of 
44% 2 years after HCT [99]. This large series of al logeneic HCT in MF/SS also confirmed feasibility, 
acceptable NRM (19 –28%) and evidence of benefit in an advanced cohort of MF/SS patients. EBMT 
data showed that patients with advanced-stage MF/ SS continue to benefit fr om allogeneic HCT over 
time, with an OS of 46% at 5 years and 44% at 7 years, and a PFS of 32% at 5 years and 30% at 7 
years [100].  
 
Recent data from large clinical trials have shown outcomes for patients suffering from a variety of 
different diseases (malignant and non-malignant ) undergoing transplantation from HLA matched 
02-H-0250 
Amendment V 
Georg Aue, M.D. December 28, 2017
 8 unrelated donors molecularly matched at 10/10 alleles are similar to those of patients receiving a 
transplant from an HLA matched relative [93-95]. Retrospective data from 1997 to 2007 have shown 
transplants using unrelated donors can cure patients  with MF/SS, although there was a statistically 
borderline increase in NRM and a lower PFS and OS [99, 100]. However, no prospective data 
describing outcome differences between the 2 gr oups based on related vs unrelated donors currently 
exists in the modern era where matched unrelate d donors are typed using high resolution molecular 
typing to assure a perfect match at 10/10 alleles. There is also no current data comparing remission 
achievement in MF/SS patients who had a matche d related donor versus a matched unrelated donor 
allogeneic transplant. Duarte et al [96] reported a total of only 21 MF/SS patients, 11 men and 10 
women, from 1994 to 2008. Fourteen of these patients had advanced MF (stage IIB in 2, stage III in 
1, stage IVA in 10, stage IVB in 1), 5 had SS and 2 others had high-grade lymphoma transformed 
from MF. Patients were very heavily pretreated, with a median of seven lines of treatment prior to 
allogeneic HSCT. Sixteen donors were HLA-identical siblings and five were matched unrelated 
donors. 15 out of 16 patients achieved CR and 1 achieved PR with matched related donor 
transplantation. All 5 patients who underwent matched unrelated transplantation achieved a complete 
clinical remission. Detailed data describing the outcomes of a cohort of 8 of the above mentioned 
MF/SS patients were published by Molina et al. [97], including 4 patients who underwent an HCT 
from a matched related donor and 4 patients who received a transplant from unrelated donors (4 
patients). All patients achieved complete clinic al remission and resolution of molecular and 
cytogenetic markers of disease within 30 –60 days after HCT. Two patients died from transplantation-
related complications. A comparison of matched re lated vs matched unrelated donor groups was not 
done  in this study due to small patient numbers. With a median follow-up of 56 months, six patients 
remain alive and without evidence of lymphoma. The results suggest that allogeneic HSCT from both 
HLA –matched siblings and unrelated donors can induce durable clinical remissions in patients with 
advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that is refractory to standard therapies.  
 
2.5 Campath -1H ( Alemtuzumab)  
 
Alemtuzumab is a humanized rat monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 directed against CD52 [72]. 
CD52 is a heavily glycosylated glycoprotein of molecular weight 21-28kD and in humans is 
expressed in over 95% of peripheral blood lym phocytes, monocytes and macrophages [73, 74]. A 
small proportion of NK cells, and neutrophils express CD52, but the antigen is absent from 
hematopoietic stem cells [15]. The activity of alemtuzumab derives from its ability to induce cell lysis 
by complement fixation and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, upon engagement of its cognate antigen 
[75]. A variety of clinical applications have been studied in conditions ranging from autoimmune 
disorders, to B-CLL, T-CLL, low grade lymphomas, as well as in allograft T cell depletion for stem 
cell transplantation [42, 76-84]. The major toxici ties of alemtuzumab are infusion-related adverse 
events, and infectious complications stemming  from the profound immunosuppression induced by the 
drug [85]. 
 
Alemtuzumab is a potentially useful drug in nonmyeloablative conditioning, given its profound 
lymphotoxicity but relatively minor effects on cells of  myeloid lineage. A recent study by Kottaridis 
et al. employed alemtuzumab as part of a nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen; patients in this 
study had a high rate of engraftment and very low incidence of severe GVHD [84]. Alemtuzumab 
also has activity against MF/SS, as demonstrated in several recent clinical trials [40-42]. 
 
 
3. STUDY DESIGN 
 
3.1 Peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant (PBPC) 
02-H-0250 
Amendment V 
Georg Aue, M.D. December 28, 2017
 9  
T cell replete PBPC allograft: Subjects will re ceive a nonmyeloablative preparative regimen of 
alemtuzumab 30mg iv three times a week for two weeks  followed by fludarabine 25mg/m2/day for 
five days followed by a PBPC graft targeted to deliver t 5x106 CD34+ cells/kg.  Cyclosporine A 
(CSA) for GVHD prophylaxis will be used initially with target CSA levels in the therapeutic range 
(200 -400 ng/ml).   
 
The HLA matched related or unrelated donor (10/10 allele level match) will receive G-CSF as 
indicated in Section 8.3 with an apheresis collection of PBSC on day 5. G-CSF may be continued and 
additional leukapheresis performed after day 5 if required as outlined in Section 8.3.  
 
3.2 Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) and cyclosporine A 
 
On day 30, and subsequently, extent of donor T-cell chimerism will be assessed. On day +30, +60, 
and +100 disease status will be assessed in all recipients by clinical and radiographic examination. 
CSA management and DLI administration will follow the scheme outlined in section 7.10. 
 
 
4. SCIENTIFIC AND CLINICAL JUSTIFICATION 
 
This study will evaluate the efficacy of alemtuzumab and fludarabine based nonmyeloablative PBSC 
transplantation in subjects with advanced MF/SS. Th e study will also evaluate engraftment, safety 
and toxicity of this transplant approach.  
 
Advanced MF/SS is an incurable disease and progression to tumor or erythrodermic phase, as well as 
presence of extracutaneous disease carries a poor prognosis.  
 
MF/SS is amenable to immunotherapy as demonstrated by clinical remissions induced by cytokine 
therapy and by allogeneic stem cell transplantation.  
 
Sufficient evidence exists to indicate that a gr aft versus tumor effect can be generated against a 
variety of malignant diseases following transplant s utilizing low-intensity conditioning, with the 
added benefit of reduced transplant-related toxicity and mortality. 
 
Thus, the investigation of nonmyeloablative peri pheral blood stem cell transplantation in advanced 
MF/SS is justified. The subjects selected for the protocol will only include those for whom no 
reasonable curative alternative exists. The conditioning  regimen has resulted in complete engraftment 
accompanied by CRs in both subjects transpla nted on the initial version of the protocol

7.8 Hospital Discharge 
 
Recipients will receive the first three doses of alemtuzumab as inpatients or outpatients. All other 
doses of Campath and fludarabine can be administered on an outpatient basis unless severe reactions 
requiring close monitoring occur. 
 . 
7.9  Donor Lymphocyte Infusions and Cyclosporine A 
 
1)   No DLI or withdrawal of immunosuppression if recipient has t grade II GVHD (See Supportive 
Care Guidelines for grading). 
 
2) Failure to engraft- For the purposes of this protocol, sustained donor immune engraftment will be 
defined as the presence of detectable donor T cells on day 100.  Those recipients with no 
detectable donor cells at any time > 30 days will be deemed to have graft rejection and will be 
taken off study.   
 
3) Impending graft rejection- Declining donor T-cell chimerism below 50% despite at least 2 DLIs. 
Immunosuppression will be withdrawn in these recipients and disease status monitored without 
further manipulations to alter chimerism. 
 
4) Any change in chimerism d 5% will be considered stable. Changes > 5% will be considered 
increases or decreases as the case may be. 
 
5) Recipients with stable mixed chimerism (50- 100% donor T-cell chimerism after 3 DLIs and 
withdrawal of immunosuppression) or complete donor chimerism AND stable or progressive 
disease after day 100 can receive immunomodulatory agents such as GM-CSF, IFN- D, IL-2 or 
additional DLIs at the discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI).

circulating T-cells. 
 
7.10  Guidelines for withdrawal of CSA and for administration of DLI: 
 
Donor T-cell chimerism will be assessed on day 30  +/- 7 days and will guide changes. 
 
  
1) 100% donor T cell chimerism 
CSA will be tapered from approximately day 60 in the absence of  t grade II GVHD. 
 
2) dd  5% donor T cell chimerism   
 
a. No detectable (< 1%) donor T or myeloid cells- Results will be confirmed and the subject 
taken off study. 
b. Detectable ( t 1%) donor T or myeloid cells- In the absence of t grade II GVHD, 
subjects will be maintained on CSA and receive a DLI. Chimerism will be rechecked in  
1 month +/- 1 week.  
– Subjects with > 5% donor T cells at this time will receive dose escalated DLIs or 
have their immunosuppression altered as outlined below in sections 3 and 4.  
– Subjects who continue to have detectable donor T or myeloid cells with d 5% donor 
T cell chimerism will be eligible to receive another DLI. Chimerism studies will be 
repeated in 30 days (approximately day 100) to monitor the effects of the DLI. If 
after these maneuvers donor T cell chimerism continues to be < 5% additional DLIs 
with or without immunosuppression may be ad ministered at the discretion of the PI. 
 
3) > 5% and < 50% donor T cell chimerism  
Recipients will be maintained on CSA and a DLI  will be administered in the absence of t grade 
II GVHD. Chimerism will be rechecked in a month.  
 
a. If donor T cell chimerism continues to be >5% and <50%, up to two more, dose escalated 
DLIs will be administered to try and convert recipients to complete donor chimerism in 
the absence of t grade II GVHD.  
– Those recipients  whose donor T cell chimerism remains between 5% and 50%, can 
receive additional DLIs (either alone or preceded by immunosuppressive 
chemotherapy) at the discretion of the PI.  
 
b. If donor T cell chimerism becomes t 50% at any point, CSA will be tapered over two 
weeks, and dose escalated DLIs administered at intervals of approximately one month or 
more (up to a total of three) as required to achieve full donor T cell chimerism (in the 
absence of t grade II GVHD). If, after these interventions, donor T cell chimerism 
remains t 50% but < 100%, further DLIs (beyond a total of 3- either alone or preceded 
by immunosuppressive chemotherapy) can be ad ministered based on disease status at the 
discretion of the PI and GVHD 
 
4) t 50% but < 100% donor T cell chimerism  
In the absence of t grade II GVHD CSA will be withdrawn over a period of 2 weeks and 
chimerism repeated.

Amendment V 
Georg Aue, M.D. December 28, 2017
 16 a. If donor chimerism remains between 50% and 100%, up to three dose-escalated DLIs 
will be administered, usually at monthly intervals - in the absence of t grade II GVHD  
b. If, after these interventions, chimerism remains t 50% but < 100%, further DLIs (beyond 
a total of 3-either alone or preceded by immunosuppressive chemotherapy) will be 
administered based on disease status at the discretion of the PI. 
 
5) Threatened graft rejection – Those recipients whose donor T-cell chimerism falls below 
50% after having been tt 50%. 
Recipients restart CSA or other appropriate immunosuppression and may- receive up to three 
doses of escalated DLIs at monthly intervals (in the absence of t grade II GVHD) in a bid to 
circumvent graft rejection. Additional DLIs  with or without immunosuppression may be 
administered at the discretion of the PI.

8.1.2 Pre-study unrelated donor evaluation  
 
• Unrelated donor matched at HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 loci by high resolution (10/10 allele 
match) 
• Evaluation of donor suitability and eligibility will be performed by National Marrow Donor 
Program (NMDP) network or cooperative centers, in accordance with the most recent NMDP 
Standards  (http://bethematch.org/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=1960) and according to the 
strictest interpretation of the latest FDA and AABB guidelines.  
02-H-0250 
Amendment V 
Georg Aue, M.D. December 28, 2017
 17 • Donor source documents are maintained at the NMDP Donor Center.  Donor eligibility, 
clearance, consent, and any exceptions will be documented under the donor’s NMDP Donor ID 
number.   
• Additional studies performed on blood sample at the time of donor collection include EBV IgG & 
IgM, EBV Early Antigen, Adenovirus Antibody, HSV Antibody, Toxoplasmosis Antibody, 
Hepatitis A Antibody, and Hepatitis A IgM.  The results of these tests are for clinical post-
transplant care of the patient, and do not impact donor selection. 
 
8.2  First apheresis - Donor lymphocyte collection (pre-transplant)  
 
 To collect PBMC for DLI and for in vitro CTL activity assays. 
 
8.3  Donor mobilization with G-CSF  
8.3.1 Matched related Donor mobilization with G-CSF – per supportive care guidelines 
 
After medical evaluation and clearance for suitability as an allogeneic donor by the BMT service in 
consultation with DTM, the donor will undergo mobilization with filgrastim (G-CSF) as an 
outpatient. Filgrastim (G-CSF) will be administered subcutaneously based on body weight (see 
below) starting day 4 before the apheresis. Dosing will be based on actual body weight unless the 
subject is “obese” (BMI > 35) when practical weight will be used.   Filgrastim (G -CSF) will be 
administered according to a vial based algorithm to reduce wastage, improve donor compliance, and 
optimize CD34 yields. The doses for days 1-4 may be given at any time of day, but the doses for days 
5 (and days 6 and 7 if needed) must be given very early in the morning, prior to apheresis.  
Predictable side effects of filgrastim (G-CSF), including headache, bone pain, and myalgia, will be 
treated with acetaminophen. Prophylactic treatment of these side effects with the same medications 
may be elected.  Other side effects will be evaluated and treated accordingly. 
Dose algorithms:  Two dosing algorithms are recommended for use in the Clinical Center. The 
standard dose algorithm uses doses in the range of 10 to 12 mcg/kg /day, with a higher dose given 
to lighter weight adult donors to improve CD34+ yields. The higher dose algorithm is intended for 
use in (1) adult autologous donors who have received prior myelotoxic agents; (2) adult donors whose 
components will undergo further processing; (3) protocols in which a high transplant cell dose is 
required (CD34 > 8 x106); and (4) situations with large weight discrepancy between the adult donor 
and recipient (recipient > donor) (as assessed by the PI). The total dose in both regimens is capped at 
1200 mcg/day. The PI or his designee will determine the dosing algorithm to be utilized. 
I. Standard-Dose Filgrastim Algorithm  
Donor Weight    Total Daily Filgrastim   Dose (range)  
38 - 60 kg    600 mcg    (10.0 to 15.8 mcg/kg) 
61 - 78 kg    780 mcg    (10.0 to 12.8 mcg/kg) 
79 - 90 kg    900 mcg   (10.0 to 11.4 mcg/kg) 
91 - 96 kg    960 mcg    (10.0 to 10.5 mcg/kg) 
97 - 108 kg    1080 mcg    (10.0 to 11.0 mcg/kg) 
 > 109 kg    1200 mcg    (11.0 or less)

49 - 56 kg   780 mcg   (13.9 to 15.9 mcg/kg) 
57 - 60 kg   900 mcg   (15.0 to 15.8 mcg/kg) 
61 - 67 kg   960 mcg   (14.3 to 15.7 mcg/kg) 
68 - 108 kg   1080 mcg   (10.0 to 15.9 mcg/kg) 
 > 109 kg   1200 mcg   (11.0 or less)  
 
 
 
 
8.3.2 Adult donor mobilization with G-CSF (> 18 years old) / matched unrelated donor – per NMDP 
Guidelines  
 
Unrelated donors will be mobilized using G-CSF per NMDP guidelines. Apheresis will be completed per 
NMDP standards and in accordance with most recent and stringent FDA guidelines. 
 
8.4 Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Collection & Processing 
8.4.1 Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Collection & Processing for matched related donor 
 
Donors will receive divalent cation prophylaxis to prevent citrate toxicity during apheresis, in 
accordance with standard DTM policies.  The volume processed per apheresis procedure will be 
determined by DTM medical staff on the day of apheresis, based on peak CD34+ cell mobilization 
response to GCSF and the CD34+ cell dose needed, based on kilogram weight of recipient.  In 
pediatric subjects, defined as less than 40 kg, a maximum of 8 blood volumes will be processed per 
day, for up to 2-3 days. Filgrastim may be continued and apheresis may be repeated on days 2 and 3 if 
needed to meet the target dose of CD34+ cell dose. 
 
The volume of the leukapheresis procedure will be targeted to obtain a progenitor cell dose of 5x106 
CD34+ cells/kg.  Obtaining a CD34+ dose of > 3x106 cells/kg will be considered adequate and no 
further apheresis will be performed. If after the first day of apheresis, the product contains < 3x106/kg 
CD34+ cells, a decision regarding further apheresis will be made at the discretion of the PI, in 
consultation with DTM. The minimum acceptable CD34+ cell dose to proceed with the protocol is 
2x106/kg.  
 
If the minimum CD34+ cell dose is not achieved with one mobilization and 3 apheresis  
collections (i.e.2 x 106 CD 34/kg), then the PI will consider options of a bone marrow collection, a 
second course of mobilization and apheresis, or no further donor collections and taking the subject off 
protocol. 
 
The PBSC collections will not be manipulated except for plasma removal or red blood cell depletion 
as needed for ABO or other red blood cell antigen incompatibility.  PBSC will be either 
cryopreserved for later thawing and infusion, or infused as fresh products within 48 hours of 
collection. 
 
On rare occasions, subjects (recipients) may develop marrow failure as a consequence of graft vs. 
host hematopoiesis (GVH) or from post transplant drug treatment (i.e. ganciclovir).  When such 
situations arise, subjects may require a stem cell “boost”. Donors will undergo a repeat mobilization

 19 with G-CSF (as outlined above) followed by CD34+ selection of hematopoietic progenator cells prior 
to being infused.  
 
8.4.2 Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Collection & Processing for matched unrelated donors 
 
Unrelated donors will be collected per NMDP polici es and procedures.  Donors will not be collected 
prior to patient screening and enrollment on the protocol.  
 
The unrelated donor will undergo G-CSF mobilization and Peripheral Blood Stem Cell (PBSC) 
collection. The volume of the leukapheresis procedure will be targeted to obtain a progenitor cell dose 
of 5x106 CD34+ cells/kg.  Obtaining a CD34+ dose of > 3x106 cells/kg will be considered adequate. 
The minimum acceptable CD34+ cell dose at the NMDP center to proceed with the protocol is 
2x106/kg.  
 
The product will be collected at the NMDP Donor  Center and transported by courier to NIH per 
NMDP guidelines.  The product will be processed at NIH and cryopreserved (see 8.4.1).  
 
 
9 MANAGEMENT OF RECIPIENT COMPLICATIONS  
 
The major complications are CMV reactivation, acut e and chronic GVHD, disease progression, graft 
failure, and opportunistic infections (bacterial/fungal). Subjects with these complications will be 
treated according to the BMT consortium Supportiv e Care Guidelines or as outlined below:  
 
9.1 CMV reactivation (See Supportive Care Guidelines)    
 
9.2 Acute GVHD (grade 3 or 4) (See Supportive Care Guidelines)  
  
9.3 Chronic GVHD (see Supportive Care Guidelines)  
  
x Continue or restart cyclos porine at standard dose 
x Prednisone, dose according to severity 
x Penicillin V 500mg PO BID for bacterial prophylaxis 
 Bactrim three times a week while the subject is on prednisone therapy for chronic GVHD 
x Change to alternate day steroid and CSA therapy when response is established. 
x Non-responding subjects may be treated with other standard of care therapies such as 
azathioprine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, mycophenolate,  basiliximab,  lenalidomide infliximab, 
PUVA, thalidomide and/or other agents at the discretion of the attending physician. 
Antifungal prophylaxis with voriconazole with prednisone will be started at the discretion of 
the PI depending on the dosage and duration of therapy with steroids 
 
9.4 Disease  Progression  
  
 Subjects demonstrating disease progression may be treated with donor lymphocyte transfusions as 
outlined in section 7.9. 
   
 Subjects with progressive disease may be treated with interferon-alpha, IL-2, GM-CSF and or 
chemotherapy at the discretion of the attending physician.

 20 9.5 Graft Rejection 
 
This transplant protocol uses a nonmyeloablative preparative regimen. Therefore, auto-recovery is 
anticipated in recipients who fail to engraft.  Recipients who fail to demonstrate donor engraftment 
despite all reasonable attempts (Section 7.9 and 7.10) will be taken off study and referred back to 
their primary physicians for further therapy.  
                 
9.6 Graft Failure 
 
If the marrow becomes aplastic the recipient will receive another G-CSF mobilized, CD34 selected 
PBPC transplant from the same donor.  The recipient will receive G-CSF after this PBPC infusion to 
expedite hematologic recovery. 
 
 
 
9.7 Donor-recipient ABO incompatibility (See Supportive Care Guidelines) 
 
Minor ABO incompatibility can cause profound hemolysis of recipient red cells in the first two weeks 
after transplant because of the rapid production of donor anti-A and anti-B antibodies. 
 
9.8      Pulmonary Engraftment Syndrome 
 
Recipients who develop pulmonary engraftment syndrome (around 10-14 days post-transplant) will 
be treated with steroids.  
 
 
10 STUDY MODIFICATIONS 
 
10.1. Use of donor lymphocytes following development of acute GVHD 
 
Recipients developing grade II or greater GVHD afte r transplant or after lymphocyte infusion will not 
receive further lymphocyte infusions unless GVHD has been successfully treated (i.e. off steroids) 
and tumor progression is documented.  
 
 
11 RESPONSE CRITERIA   
 
Complete response (CR) - disappearance of all signs and symptoms of CTCL for a period of at least 
one month.  
 
Partial response (PR) - a 50% or greater decrease in the sum of the products of the longest 
perpendicular diameters of all measured lesions (a greater than 50% reduction in area of disease 
involvement in the case of cutaneous disease) lasting for a period of at least one month. No new 
metastatic lesions may appear. 
 
 Stable disease (SD) - tumor measurements not meeting the criteria of CR, PR, or PD  
 
Progressive disease (PD ) - increase of 25% or greater in the sum of the products of the longest 
perpendicular diameters of all measured lesions (a greater than 25% increase in area of disease 
02-H-0250

the development of any new metastatic or cutaneous disease. 
 
 
12  ANCILLARY LABORATORY RESEARCH STUDIES 
12.1 Intended use:  During the course of participating on this study, blood and tissue will be collected for 
correlative laboratory research studies.  These specim ens will not be read by a pathologist or used for 
diagnostic purposes.   Studies will not be used in assessing the primary endpoint but are undertaken 
for descriptive or exploratory ancillary research, wh ich are approved by the NHLBI IRB and listed in 
the Appendix E of the protocol. 
 GVT and GVH studies :  Blood and serum from recipients and donors will be obtained by 
leukapheresis to study genomic and proteomic pathways involved in mediating GVHD and in 
vitro donor T- cell responses to the recipient’s tumor as well as normal cells. Biopsies of 
accessible lesions and/or apheresis of recipi ents with circulating Sezary cells will be 
performed to aid in GVT studies. Regressing tumors will be biopsied when accessible, to 
investigate the presence of donor derived TIL.  
 
 Engraftment :  PCR-based microsatellite analysis will be performed at various time points 
after the transplant to assess the degree of donor lymphoid and myeloid chimerism 
 
 Immune Reconstitution:  Lymphocyte subset analysis and T cell repertoire studies will be 
performed at various time points after the transplant to assess immune reconstitution 
 
 Pharmacokinetic studies on alemtuzumab:  Circulating alemtuzumab levels may be 
measured at multiple time points after alemtuzumab administration to assess the half-life of 
the drug.  The alemtuzumab assays will be sent for batch processing to the laboratory of Dr. 
Geoff Hale, BioAnaLab Limited, Oxford BioBusiness Centre, Littlemore Park, Littlemore, 
Oxford OX4 4SS.  No transfer of material will be accomplished until a Material Transfer 
Agreement is fully executed through the NHLBI Office of Technology Transfer and 
Development (OTTAD).  
  
 Chimerism studies :  PCR of microsatellites of post-transplant peripheral blood T-
lymphocytes, B-cells, NK cells and blood myeloid cells will be assessed in serial fashion to 
determine the chimeric status of the patient as a function of time. These studies will be 
repeated after lymphocyte infusions to assess thei r effect on host chimeric status as well. The 
relationship between degrees of donor host chimerism, GVHD and tumor response will be 
analyzed.  
 
 Pulmonary function tests:   Pulmonary status at baseline, day 30 and after day 100 will be 
analyzed to see if reduced intensity conditioni ng (RIC) effects lung function before day 100 
or if the decline in lung function is only seen later consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans 
syndrome (BOS).  
 
 Other research labs as described on the List of Laboratory Studies Using Human Subject 
and Normal Volunteer Samples in the Hematology Branch submitted to and reviewed by the 
IRB (See Appendix E)

 22 12.2 Storage:   Research samples will be stored with identifiers in the secure laboratory of Dr. Richard 
Childs, Senior Investigator, Hematology Branch, NHLBI. 
12.3 Tracking:   Samples will be ordered and tracked through the CRIS Research Screens.  Should a CRIS 
screen not be available, the NIH form 2803-1 will be completed and will accompany the specimen 
and be filed in the medical record.  Specimens will be entered in the NHLBI Biospecimen Inventory 
System (BSI). Samples will not be sent outside NI H without IRB notification and an executed MTA.  
12.4 End of study procedures :  Samples from consenting subjects will be stored until they are no longer 
of scientific value or if a subject withdraws consent for their continued use, at which time they will be 
destroyed.  
12.5 Loss or destruction of samples :  Should we become aware that a major breech in our plan for 
tracking and storage of samples has occurred, the IRB will be notified. 
 
12.6 Technology Transfer:  This protocol has no associated patents, CRADAs or CTAs.     
 
If done, the alemtuzumab (Campath®) assays will be sent for batch processing to the laboratory of 
Dr. Geoff Hale, BioAnaLab Limited, Oxford BioBusiness Centre, Littlemore Park, Littlemore, 
Oxford OX4 4SS.  No transfer of material will be accomplished until a Material Transfer Agreement 
is fully executed through the NHLBI Office of Technology Transfer and Development (OTTAD).

13.3 Goals   
 
This trial was originally designed as a Phase I-II study.  The primary goal was to find the minimal 
dose of conditioning regimen (of the two considered) which would have resulted in engraftment in 
greater than 80% of patients.  If such a dose were found, our goal was to assess efficacy and our plan 
was to accrue enough subjects to estimate the proportion of response (CR or PR) to within ± 20% and 
to rule out a proportion of response of 10% or less if no subjects responded. 
 
In May 2009, the sample size of the study was decreased and the study was redesigned to assess the 
confidence interval for efficacy as detailed be low.  The sample size was reduced from 58 to 25 
recipients and the plans for multiple testing procedure for engraftment and dose escalation were 
eliminated. 
 
 Confidence interval for efficacy 
 
 Given the slow accrual in this rare disease, we wish to assess efficacy and we will accrue enough 
subjects to estimate the proportion of complete response (CR) with a two-sided 95% confidence 
interval of a width less than 40%. We will use the two-stage design of Gehan [90] to estimate the 
proportion of CRs. Initially we will accrue 14 subjects and then add up to 11 more subjects, 
depending on the number of CRs achieved.  
 
The numbers of subjects needed in the second st age of the study are summarized in the following 
table: 
Number of CRs observed 
among 14 subjects in 
Stage 1 Number of  subjects 
 needed in Stage  2 Total number of subjects  
in the study 
0-1 CR + 0 subject 14 subjects 
2 CRs + 1 subject 15 subjects 
3 CRs + 5 subjects 19 subjects 
4 CRs + 8 subjects 22 subjects 
5-9 CRs  + 11 subjects  25 subjects  
10 CRs  + 8 subjects 22 subjects 
11 CRs + 5 subjects 19 subjects 
12 CRs + 1 subject 15 subjects 
13-14 CRs + 0 subject 14 subjects 
 
02-H-0250 
Amendment V 
Georg Aue, M.D. December 28, 2017
 24  The above design will allow us to estimate a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of CRs with 
a width <40%.  We plan to include the first two subjec ts accrued to the earlier version of this protocol 
in the total sample size. 
 
Statistical methods: 
The planned analyses will include descriptive statistics on the proportions of response and time to 
response. The response probabilities will be estimated using the sample proportions and their 
inferences including confidence in tervals and hypotheses testing will be evaluated using exact method 
based on Binomial distributions or normal approximation, if appropriate. The transplant outcome by 
donor type (related vs. unrelated) will be compared. Analyses based on survival analysis and 
regression methods will also be employed if deemed appropriate. 
 
13.4 Bayesian Stopping Rule for Day 100 Transplant-Related Mortality (TRM)  
 
To monitor TRM, we adopt a Bayesian approach that formally incorporates our “prior” expectations 
about 100-day TRM (Geller et al. 2004 [98]).  From prior experience we anticipate the 100-day NRM 
rate should not be higher than 20%.  A stopping boundary is reached if the true rate exceeds the 
anticipated rate with a probability at least 0.90. We take our prior distribution to be a beta distribution 
with a mean of 0.20 and the sum of the two beta parameters to be 6, meaning that we take our prior 
beliefs to be “worth” 6 patients. This implies that the parameters of the beta prior distribution are 1.2 
and 4.8 (mean 0.20 and variance 0.0229).   The st opping boundaries are given in the table below.
 
Number of transplant 
recipients Stop if # of NRM by day 100 
reaches or exceeds 
Up to  5 3 
6-8 4 
9-12 5 
13-16 6 
17-20 7 
21- 25 8 
 
This stopping rule was assessed by simulation.  Based on 100,000 repetitions, the probability of 
meeting the stopping boundary was .19 under the null hypothesis of p TRM = 0.20 and 0.88 under the 
alternative hypothesis that p TRM = 0.40.  We concluded that the likelihood of stopping was satisfactory 
to protect patient safety for 100 day TRM. 
 
13.5 Drop outs   
 
Once recipients undergo the stem cell transplantation they will be evaluated for engraftment and 100 
day TRM.  Anyone treated on this protocol will be counted.   
 
 
14 REMOVAL FROM THE STUDY  
 
14.1 Withdrawal from the transplant procedure 
  
 Recipients and their donors will be given ample time to withdraw from the study prior to admission 
for transplant. Thereafter, the nature of the procedure does not permit safe withdrawal from the 
protocol. 
02-H-0250 
Amendment V 
Georg Aue, M.D. December 28, 2017
 25  
14.2  Withdrawal from Experimental Protocol 
The recipient and donor have the right at any time to el ect not to participate in the research aspects of 
the protocol. 
 
Recipients who fail to achieve allogeneic marrow engraftment (donor chimerism or mixed 
chimerism) will be removed from study after full autologous marrow recovery is achieved. 
 
Recipients with disease progression associated with  a significant decline in performance status which 
negates further treatment on protocol (i.e. donor lymphocyte infusion) will be removed from study.  
 
 
15 DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING PLAN 
 
15.1 Safety Monitoring 
  
Principal Investigator :  Accrual, efficacy and safety data will be monitored by the PI  
 
NHLBI IRB . Accrual and safety data will be reviewed annually by the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB). Prior to implementation of this study, the prot ocol and the proposed subject consent and assent 
forms will be reviewed and approved by the properly constituted Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
operating according to the  45 Code of Fede ral Regulations (CFR) 46 (Protection of Human 
Subjects).  This committee will also approve all amen dments to the protocol or informed consent, and 
conduct continuing annual review so long as the protocol is open to accrual or follow up of subjects.  
 
DSMB : The NHLBI Data safety and Monitoring Board will review the protocol at six or twelve 
month intervals.  A progress report will be fo rwarded to the DSMB at these times and their 
recommendations will be expeditiously implemented. The DSMB may recommend early termination 
of the study for considerations of safety and efficacy.   
 
15.2 Characterization and Reporting 
Events include adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), protocol deviations (PD), unanticipated 
problems (UP), and non-compliance.  
  
The principal investigator will review all events (AEs , protocol deviations, UPs, SAEs) to determine the 
seriousness, expectedness, and reportability of the event.   
 
15.2.1 Definitions 
Adverse Event (AE):  Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including any 
abnormal sign (e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally 
associated with the subject’s participation in the res earch, whether or not considered related to the research. 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):   A serious adverse event that: 
results in death; 
is life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred); 
results in in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in a persistent or significant incapacity; 
results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
02-H-0250 
Amendment V 
Georg Aue, M.D. December 28, 2017
 26 based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition. 
 
Suspected adverse reaction:  Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, 
‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a less er degree of certainty about causality than adverse 
reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
 
Serious event:  An event is serious if it meets the definition of a serious adverse event (above) or if it requires 
immediate corrective action by a PI and/or IRB to protect the safety, welfare or rights of subjects.  
Unexpected adverse reaction:  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it 
is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, 
if an investigator brochure is not required or available,  is not consistent with the risk information described in 
the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. "Unexpected”, also refers to adverse 
events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class 
of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
 
Unanticipated Problem (UP):   Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: 
unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to 
the research risks that are described in the IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; Investigator’s Brochure or other study documents; and  
the characteristics of the subject population being studied; and 
related or possibly related to participation in the research; and 
places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social 
harm) than was previously known or recognized. 
 
Unanticipated Problem that is not an Adverse Event:   An unanticipated problem that does not fit the 
definition of an adverse event, but which may, in the opinion of the investigator, involves risk to the subject, 
affect others in the research study, or significantly impa ct the integrity of research data.  For example, report 
occurrences of breaches of confidentiality, accidental destruction of study records, or unaccounted-for study 
drug. 
 
Protocol Deviation (PD):   Any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB approved research protocol. 
 
Non-compliance:  The failure to comply with applicable NIH HRPP policies, IRB requirements, or regulatory 
requirements for the protection of human research. Noncompliance may be further characterized as: 
 
Serious non-compliance: Non-compliance that: 
Increases risks, or causes harm, to participants. 
Decreases potential benefits to participants. 
Compromises the integrity of the NIH HRPP. 
Invalidates the study data.  
Continuing non-compliance: Non-compliance that is recurring. An example may be a pattern of non-
compliance that suggests a likelihood that, absent an intervention, non-compliance will continue. Continuing 
noncompliance could also include a failure to respond to IRB requests to resolve previous allegations of non-
compliance. 
02-H-0250 
Amendment V 
Georg Aue, M.D. December 28, 2017
 27  
Minor (non-serious) non-compliance: Non-compliance that, is neither serious nor continuing.

Approved by HSRAC on September 30, 2013 
Date effective: October 28, 2013 
 
All adverse events occurring during the study, including those observed by or reported to the research team, 
will be recorded.  Serious unanticipated problems, and serious protocol deviations, will be reported to the IRB 
and Clinical Director as soon as possible but not more than 7 days after the PI first learns of the event.  Not 
serious unanticipated problems will be reported to the IRB and Clinical Director as soon as possible but not more than 14 days after the PI first learns of the event.   Not serious protocol deviations will be reported to the 
IRB as soon as possible but not more than 14 days after the PI first learns of the event.  SAEs that do not meet 
the criteria of Unanticipated Problem (UP) must be reported to the IRB Chair and Clinical Director through 
the NHLBI Protocol Tracking Management System (PTMS) within 14 days of learning of the event using the 
SAE form in PTMS. 
 
Deaths will be reported to the Clinical Director within 7 days after the PI first learns of the event. 
 
15.3 Adverse Events for transplant recipients

15.5 Data management 
 
The PI will be responsible for overseeing entry of data into an in-house password protected electronic 
system and ensuring data accuracy, consistency a nd timeliness. The principa l investigator, associate 
investigators/research nurses and/or a contracted da ta manager will assist with the data management 
efforts. 
  
All human subjects personally identifiable information (PII) as defined in accordance to the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act,  eligib ility and consent verification will  be recorded in 
DIR’s C linical Data System (CDS) or the Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics (LCE) database.  Primary 
data obtained during the conduct of the protocol will be kept in secure network drives or in approved 
alternative sites that comply with NIH security sta ndards.  Primary and final analyzed data will have 
identifiers so that research data can be attributed to an individual human subject participant, e.g., 
study-specific identifying number (SSPIN) generated by CDS or other unique code or minimum PII 
required for subject identification.  
 
CIBMTR : For the purposes of quality assurance (i.e. accreditation of the Transplant program), 
anonymized data will be released to the Cent er for International Blood and Marrow Transplant 
Research (CIBMTR) according to federally mandated policies and procedures. 
 
End of study procedures :  Data will be stored in locked cabinets and in a password protected 
database until it is no longer of scientific value.  
 
Loss or destruction of data :  Should we become aware that a major breech in our plan to protect 
subject confidentiality and trial data has occurred, the IRB will be notified. 
 
Publication Policy : Given the research mandate of the NIH, subject data including the results of 
testing and responses to treatment will be entered into an NIH-authorized and controlled research 
database. Any future research use will occur only after appropriate human subject protection 
institutional approval such as prospective NIH IRB review and approval or an exemption from the 
NIH Office of Human Subjects Research (OHSR) . 
 
 
16 HUMAN SUBJECT PROTECTIONS 
 
16.1 Rationale for Subject Selection 
 
No subjects will be excluded from participation based on gender, race or ethnicity.  All patients with 
mycosis fungoides (MF) or Sezary syndrome (SS) staged as outlined in section 5.1 will be considered for 
the protocol. Only patients that are considered unfit to withstand a nonmyeloablative transplant as 
outlined in section 5.3, will be excluded.

Strategies for subject recruitment: Hematologists and oncologists throughout the country will be 
informed about our protocol by letter.. Information about the protocol will be posted on the NHLBI 
patient recruitment website, NCI website (cance r.gov), Cutaneous Lymphoma Foundation website 
and on ClinicalTrials.gov. We are also in the process of initiating collaboration with the CTCL Clinic, 
Washington Hospital Center, to serve as a source of patient referrals. Additionally, we will also 
advertise in relevant medical journals.   
 
Reimbursement for protocol participation, travel, food, and lodging will be consistent with NIH 
guidelines.  In determining reimbursement, the following factors are considered applicable to this 
protocol:   the subjects are diagnosed with a rare disease; the subject population is sick; the protocol 
offers the potential for direct benefit; the protocol regimen is demanding; and in order to complete 
accrual in a reasonable timeframe a geographicall y dispersed participant population is required.  
 
Payment for participation:  $0 
 
16.2 Participation of children  
 
In principle, age is not a consideration, but in practice we are limiting the protocol to subjects 18-70 
years of age (both inclusive) as MF/SS  are diseases largely afflicting adults, with most patients being 
40-60 years at diagnosis. 
  
16.3 Risks and Discomforts 
 
16.3.1  The recipient 
 
Related to the transplant procedure:  Bone marrow stem cell transplantation is a major procedure, which 
entails serious discomforts and hazards for the recipient. Although we anticipate that this protocol is 
relatively safe, the mortality from conventional BMT may be as high as 40%. It is therefore only 
appropriate to carry out this experimental procedure in  the context of a life threatening condition and with 
full informed consent from the recipient, and donor.  The major hazards (GVHD, infection, graft failure, 
and disease progression) have already been discussed.  The major discomforts are those of nausea, 
mucositis, anorexia, diarrhea, fever and malaise. The specific hazards of this study using a 
nonmyeloablative preparative regimen in the context of a PBPC transplant are: graft rejection, GVHD, 
and disease progression.   
 
Transplant recipients have been reported to have an  increased risk of solid cancers but most studies are 
small and have limited ability to evaluate the interaction of host, disease, and treatment-related factors. In 
the largest study to date to evaluate risk factors for solid cancers, we studied a multi-institutional cohort of 
28874 allogeneic transplant recipients with 189 solid malignancies. Overall, patients developed new solid 
cancers at twice the rate expected based on general population rates (observed-to-expected ratio 2.1; 95% 
confidence interval 1.8-2.5), with the risk increasing over time (P trend < 0.001); the risk reached 3-fold 
among patients followed for 15 years or more after transplantation. New findings showed that the risk of 
developing a non-squamous cell carcinoma (non-SCC) following conditioning radiation was highly 
dependent on age at exposure. Among patients irradiated at ages under 30 years, the relative risk of non-
SCC was 9 times that of non-irradiated patients, while the comparable risk for older patients was 1.1 (P 
interaction <.01). Chronic graft-versus-host disease and male sex were the main determinants for risk of 
SCC. These data indicate that allogeneic transplant survivors, particularly those irradiated at young ages, 
face increased risks of solid cancers, supporting strategies to promote lifelong surveillance among these 
patients. (Blood. 2009; 113:1175-1183).

Secondary MDS/AML of donor origin is also a know n but rare complication following allo-transplant 
[101-104]. This phenomenon is increasingly being realiz ed given our ability to do chimerism assays to 
distinguish donor from patient cells.  
 
Side effects of common drugs used in this transplant regimen include: 
 
Alemtuzumab: Adverse events noted on trials utilizing alemtuzumab and occurring in >5% of 
patients include  nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, rigors, hypotension, rash, headaches, abdominal pain, 
myalgias, arthralgia, diarrhea, dyspnea, bronchospasm, angioedema, tumor lysis syndrome, 
infections, loss of appetite, hypertension, heart rhythm abnormalities including supraventricular 
tachycardia, dizziness,  dysesthias, tremors, stomatitis, insomnia, depression, cough, impaired sperm 
motility and/or EBV related lymphoproliferative disease.   
 
The following is the black box warning for Campath-1 H 
 
WARNING: CYTOPENIAS, INFUSION REACTIONS, and INFECTIONS 
Cytopenias : Serious, including fatal, pancytopenia/marrow hypoplasia, autoimmune idiopathic 
thrombocytopenia, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia can occur in patients receiving Campath. 
Single doses of Campath greater than 30 mg or cumulative doses greater than 90 mg per week 
increase the incidence of pancytopenia. 
Infusion Reactions : Campath administration can result in serious, including fatal, infusion reactions. 
Carefully monitor patients during infusions and withhold Campath for Grade 3 or 4 infusion 
reactions. Gradually escalate Campath to the recommended dose at the initiation of therapy and after 
interruption of therapy for 7 or more days. 
Infections : Serious, including fatal, bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoan infections can occur in 
patients receiving Campath. Administer prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia  (PCP) 
and herpes virus infections  
  
Infusion reactions : Alemtuzumab can result in serious, and in some instances fatal, infusion 
reactions. Patients should be carefully monitore d during infusions and alemtuzumab discontinued 
if indicated. 
Cardiac:  Potential cardiac toxicity might be irreversible. For this reason, we will monitor subjects 
with an echocardiogram, 24 hour holter, and serum troponin level before treatment begins and 
after the last dose of Campath.  The ECHO and the serum troponin will be repeated 90 days (+/- 7 
days) after the last dose of alemtuzumab.  
  
Hematologic : Myelosuppression involves all 3 cell lineages (transient neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia)/ Serious and in rare instances fatal pancytopenia/marrow 
hypoplasia, autoimmune idiopathic thrombocytopenia, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia have 
occurred in patients receiving Campath. 
 
Infections, opportunistic infections : Serious, sometimes fatal bacterial, viral, fungal, and 
protozoan infections have been reported in patients receiving alemtuzumab therapy. 
   
Numerous other adverse events have occurred in patients receiving therapy with single agent 
alemtuzumab, albeit at lower frequencies and with uncertain attributability to the agent. Of note, 
published case reports describe transformation of low-grade/indolent lymphomas to more 
aggressive variants, and occurrence of disord ers related to immune dysregulation such as 
sarcoidosis.

Cyclosporine A:  CSA is metabolized primarily in liver but th e major toxicity is renal. Side effects 
include renal impairment, reversible renal insuff iciency, hemolytic uremic syndrome, elevated 
bilirubin and transaminases that normalize wi th continued administration or reduced dose, 
hypertrichosis, headaches, nausea, gingival hypertrophy, parasthesias (painful hands and feet), 
hypertension, hypomagnesium, bilirubinemia, tremor, and seizure.  An extremely rare complication 
of cyclosporine is blindness, which may be irreversible. Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy 
Syndrome (PRES) is an increasingly recognized neurologic disorder seen in 1% of patients on 
cyclosporine which manifest with acute to subacute hypertension and/or seizures [91].  In the event of 
hypertension, subjects will be prescribed 1 or more medications to control blood pressure in an effort 
to decrease the risk of this complication.- 
 
Fludarabine : Myelosuppression, fever and chills, nausea and vomiting, malaise, fatigue, anorexia, 
weakness, and rarely hemolysis and pulmonary toxici ty, hemolytic anemia and interstitial pneumonitis. 
Serious opportunistic infections have occurred in CLL patients treated with fludarabine.   
 
The following is the black box warning for fludarabine 
 
WARNING: CNS TOXICITY, HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, AND PULMONARY TOXICITY 
Severe central nervous system toxicity occurred in 36% of patients treated with doses approximately 
four times greater (96 mg/m2/day for 5 to 7 days) than the reco mmended dose. This toxicity was seen 
in <0.2% of patients treated at the recommended dose levels (25 mg/ m2). Instances of life-threatening 
and sometimes fatal autoimmune hemolytic anemia have been reported after one or more cycles of 
treatment. In a clinical investigation of the combination of fludarabine phosphate with pentostatin 
(deoxycoformycin) for the treatment of refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), there was an 
unacceptably high incidence of fatal pulmonary toxicity.  
 
Risks related to pregnancy and breastfeeding:  Pregnant and nursing women are excluded from 
accrual. Subjects are required to  use effective contraceptive measures to prevent pregnancy during 
protocol participation to eliminate the possibility of drug effects on a developing fetus. Following 
transplantation, woman of childbearing age will be counseled regarding when it is safe to consider 
becoming pregnant should they so choose.  Female subjects will be advised that should pregnancy 
occur, the research team must be informed immedi ately.  An SAE will be filed on any pregnancy and 
this report will be followed up with information on the outcome of the pregnancy and complications 
of (should there be any).  
  
 16.3.2   The donor 
 
Related to filgrastim (G-CSF):  The hazard to the donor is low. The discomfort from G-CSF 
mobilization and leukapheresis for collection of PBPC are probably lower than those associated with 
marrow harvesting. G-CSF has been given to large numbers of donors without major side effects or 
long-term consequences. The immediate side effe cts of G-CSF are bone pain, fatigue, insomnia, 
myalgia and headache which are usually mild and self-limiting.  Reversible thrombocytopenia, with 
platelet counts falling to the range of 100,000 / mm3 is common. Two patients have been reported to 
experience non-fatal splenic rupture after more prolonged treatment with higher doses of G-CSF.  
One of these two patients had concurrent mononucleosis, a second cause for splenic rupture.  Donors 
will be asked to avoid vigorous activities and to re port any left upper abdominal and/or shoulder pain 
to the research team or the on-call physician for the NIH Department of Transfusion Medicine at 301-
496-1211.  Other side effects include fever (rare, less than 1% of patients), worsening of pre-existing 
skin rashes and transient and reversible elevation of liver enzymes in the blood (suggesting transient 
02-H-0250 
Amendment V 
Georg Aue, M.D. December 28, 2017
 33 inflammation of the liver). 
 
Patients with ongoing ischemic heart disease have be en reported to have angina seemingly temporally 
related to G-CSF administration and apheresis. (In addition, a rare occurrence of pulmonary 
hemorrhage has been reported in a healthy donor who was a cigarette smoker and had underlying 
pulmonary disease [92]. 
 
Related to central line placement: It is estimated that approximately 50% of donors will require 
central venous line placement to successfully complete apheresis. Intravenous line placement in a 
large - vein using a temporary - catheter carries a small risk of bleeding, bruising or pain and a very 
low risk of accidental injury to the adjacent artery or nerve. These risks are minimized by using only 
trained, experienced MICU or interventional radiology staff for this procedure. 
 
Related to leukapheresis: Adverse reactions related to leukapheresis include hypotension resulting from 
transient blood volume loss and cutaneous paresthesia from the use of anticoagulant.  The former toxicity 
can be corrected by postural changes and volume replacement.  The latter is manageable with slowing the 
rate of anticoagulant   and/or providing calcium supplement. In exceptional circumstances the donor will 
be required to donate PBPC a third time or to give bone marrow. There is a minimal additional risk that 
the donation of PBPC on three successive days can increase the possibility of thrombocytopenia. This 
thrombocytopenia is transient and unlikely to cause clin ical sequelae. There is no additional risk to giving 
bone marrow after PBPC donation (than would normally be associated with bone marrow harvesting). 
 
Related to skin biopsies:  Punch biopsies will be performed by the principal investigator or by a 
credentialed associate investigator  or member of the Dept. of Dermatology or Surgery. Risks include 
pain, bleeding, hematoma, and infection at the site of biopsy.  
 
16.4 Risks in Relation to Benefit  
  
 For Transplant Patients 
 
Allogeneic PBSCT is curative in many patients with a variety of hematologic malignancies. However, 
conventional dose intensive transplantation is fraught with risks, including a mortality rate that can 
approach 50%. By utilizing a reduced intensity conditioning regimen, we aim to decrease morbidity 
and mortality associated with conditioni ng, thereby potentially improving outcome. 
 
The approach outlined in this protocol is ethically acceptable because we will target a group of 
patients with an incurable malignancy who have made an informed decision to opt for a procedure 
which they understand may offer a chance of disease remission but with a risk of death from 
treatment failure or treatment-related causes. Implic it in this decision is the opportunity to weigh all 
treatment options after full information has been provided to them by the NIH team and the referring 
physician. Stopping rules will minimize the risk of untoward or unexpected side effects. 
 
Therefore, in this study, the research involves greater than minimal risk but presents the prospect of 
direct benefit to the individual subjects (45CFR 46). 
 
As of February 21, 2017, this study is now closed to  new subject accrual and continues in subject 
follow up only.  Follow up under this protocol in volves procedures that are more than minimal 
risk; therefore, the risk remains unchanged.  
 
For Adult Donors : 
02-H-0250 
Amendment V 
Georg Aue, M.D. December 28, 2017
 34  
Healthy HLA matched family members will be co-enr olled into this study as stem cell donors. The 
stem cell collection aspect of this protocol is not investigational.  Despite the risks associated with 
this procedure (section 16.3.2), potential benefit does exist for family donors. The donor derives 
psychosocial benefit from donating stem cells both at the time of donation and possibly into the 
future, especially in view of the reduced life expe ctancy due to this disease in a family member.  
Other potential benefits include detection of il lnesses, determination of blood cell counts, and 
evaluation of kidney and liver function in the potential donor at the time of screening.  
 
Therefore, in this study, the research involves greater than minimal risk but presents the prospect of 
direct benefit to the individual subjects (45CFR 46). 
  
16.5 Consent Processes and Procedures 
 
The investigational nature and research objectives of this trial, the procedure and its attendant risks 
and discomforts will be carefully explained to the subject and a signed informed consent document 
will be obtained prior to entry onto this study.  Dr. Aue will lead this discussion. 
 
At any time during participation in the protocol that new information becomes available relating to 
risks, adverse events, or toxicities, this information will be provided orally or in writing to all enrolled 
or prospective patient participants.  Documentation will be provided to the IRB and if necessary the 
informed consent amended to reflect relevant information. 
 
We anticipate the enrollment of non-English speaking research participants into our study. The IRB 
approved full consent document will be translated into that language in accordance with the Clinical 
MAS Policy M77-2. If there is an unexpected enrollment of a research participant for which there is 
no translated extant IRB approved consent document, the principal investigator and or those 
authorized to obtain informed consent will use th e Short Form Oral Consent Process as described in 
MAS Policy M77-2, 45 CFR 46.117 ( b) (2),. The summary that will be used is the English version of 
the extant IRB approved consent document.  
 
We request prospective IRB approval of the use of the short form for up to a maximum of 3 
participants in a given language and will notify the IRB at the time of continuing review of the 
frequency of the use of the Short Form.  Should we reach the threshold of 3, we will notify the IRB of 
the need for an additional use of the Short Form and that we will have that consent document 
translated into the given inherent language. 
16.7 Conflict of Interest 
 
The Principal Investigator ensured that each associate investigator listed on the protocol title page 
received a copy of the NIH’s Guide to preventing conflict of interest.  In vestigators added subsequent to 
the initial circulation were provided a copy of the document when they were added. Copies of the 
Conflict of Interest Statement were forwarded to the Clinical Director.  No initial or subsequent 
members of the research team reported a potential conflict of interest.

 44 APPENDIX  D DONOR STEM CELL MOBILIZATION, AND APHERESIS 
 
 
 
I.  Donor stem cell mobilization with G-CSF and donor stem cell apheresis 
 
After medical evaluation and clearance for suitability as an allogeneic donor, each donor will undergo 
mobilization with G-CSF as an outpatient. The donor will receive 10 Pg/kg G-CSF s.c. daily starting 
day –4 before apheresis. On day 0, a large volume leukapheresis of 15- 25 liters will be performed. 
The volume of the leukapheresis procedure will be targeted to obtain a progenitor cell dose of 5x106 
CD34+ cells/kg. Obtaining a dose of > 3x106 CD34+ cells/kg will be considered adequate and no 
further apheresis will be performed. If after the first day of apheresis, the product contains < 3x106/kg 
CD34+ cells, a decision regarding further apheresis will be made at the discretion of the PI, in 
consultation with Department of Transfusion Medi cine. The minimum acceptable CD34+ cell dose to 
proceed with the protocol is 2x106/kg.  
 
Predictable side effects of G-CSF, including headache, bone pain, and myalgia, will be treated with 
acetaminophen or ibuprofen.  Prophylactic treatment of these side effects may also be carried out with 
the same medications. Other side effects will be evaluated and treated accordingly. 
 
Leukapheresis procedures will be carried out in the Apheresis Unit, Department of Transfusion 
Medicine. These procedures will be done via a 2-armed approach or by temporary central venous 
catheter.  These procedures will use ACD-A anticoagulant, routinely used in normal donors.  If the 
donor is very small or relatively intolerant to ACD-A, and the adverse effects cannot be controlled by 
usual means, consideration will be given to using partial anticoagulation with heparin. 
 
 
II.       Leukapheresis PBPC product 
 
The processing goals for this protocol are to provide a product with a maximum dose of CD34+ cells. 
ABO or other erythrocyte incompatibility is not an issue because the resulting number of 
contaminating erythrocytes is well below 1 ml using this system. The final cell suspension will be 
prepared for infusion by transferring the cells into a 50-150 ml volume of an infusible solution 
(Plasmalyte A with 1% human serum albumin), suitable for intravenous infusion over 15 minutes to 1 
hour, depending on clinical circumstances.

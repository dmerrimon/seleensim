Version Number 1.2 
Version Date 1/10/13  
Summary of Revisions Made:      
 
Version Number 1.3 
Version Date 3/8/13  
Summary of Revisions Made (Changes in italics) :  
1. Added List of Case Report Forms to be used as source documents (sectio n 10.2) 
2. Updated Consent Form to include time of consent to investigator signature line  
3. Provided updated Case Report Forms in Appendix F  
Version Number 1.4 
Version Date 3/21/2013  
Summary of Revisions Made:  
1. Changed the timing of long -term follow -up from 18-22 month s to 22- 26 months adjusted 
age 
2. In response to FDA Drug Safety Communication dated 3/12/2013 concerning 
Azithromycin and the risk of potentially fatal heart rhythms, have added conditions  that 
may increase the risk for prolonged QT  in stopping rules for individual subjects 
(summarized in Background p. 14- 15 and Section 5.1.4) . 
3. Consent form  procedures section  revised to include the conditions  that may increase the 
risk for prolonged QT  that would cause delay in drug receipt or discon tinuation of the 
drug.  
4. Corrected the timing of the hearing screen and physiologic BPD assessment to 36 
weeks or pre- discharge in study schedule (Table 3).  
5. Revised consent process, to include parental consent for banking (storage) of Ureaplasma samples isol ated from positive subjects and contact for future studies  
(sections 4.3 and 6.2.2) . 
Version Number 2.0 
Version Date 4/14/2014  
Summary of Revisions Made:  
1. Change in eligibility criteria: Eliminated appropriate for gestational age (AGA) from inclusion crite ria. Ten percent of potential subjects <29 weeks gestation are small for 
gestational age (SGA). Based on 2 prior prospective studies  of Ureaplasma respiratory 
colonization , the risk of Ureaplasma respiratory colonization and BPD are similar for 
AGA and SGA  infants<29 weeks when delivery for maternal indications are excluded. 
This should not impact risks for subjects and should not significantly change the 
anticipated respiratory colonization rate of enrolled subjects.  
2. Added additional pulmonary follow -up at  12 mo nths adjusted age to section 6.3.5 , study 
schedule and consent form procedures section.  
3. Clarify calculation of dosing volumes for study drug (Section 5.2.4) 
4. Revised serious adverse event reporting procedures (Section 7.4) for all SAEs 
regardless of relationship to study drug to be reported to the sponsor within 5 business 
days. The sponsor will forward all SAE reports to DSMB chair who will review and 
Phase IIb AZIP study 6 of 70 Version 5 .0 
  30 Jan 2017  determine whether to request treatment assignment. A monthly cumulative s ummary of 
SAEs will be submitted to the DSMB chair as previously described.  
5. Specific requirements for safety reports for NEC cases  are included in section 7.4. 
6. Clarify that  subjects will be followed for safety (morbidities of prematurity, adverse 
events, s erious adverse events) until 44 weeks post -menstrual age (PMA), discharge, or 
transfer whichever comes first.  
7. Added Appendix E. Severity Assessment of Clinical Laboratory Values 
8. Oregon Health and Science University has been dropped as a participating site.  
Version Number 3.0 
Version Date 5/28/2015  
Summary of Revisions Made:  
1. Added  information to risk section (p. 18 and 38 ) concerning new published information 
concerning an association of oral azithromycin and increased risk for idiopathic 
hypertrophic pylor ic stenosis in infants. The consent form was revised to include this 
new information  (see page 65) . 
2. Since additional planned azithromycin drug measurements have been completed, 
residual blood collection procedure will be discontinued.  
3. Added Christiana Care  Health System, Newark, DE as a study site.  
 Version Number 4.0 Version Date 1/13/2016  
Summary of Revisions Made:  
1. Gestational age e ligibility criteria  change: This revision change s the  gestational age  (GA) 
eligibility from 24
0-286 wk to 240-266 wk. This ch ange is requested with approval from the 
DSMB to limit enrollment to the gestational age  stratum  with the highest Ureaplasma 
respiratory colonization rate and  to reduce the exposure of non -colonized infants to the 
potential risks associated with azithromycin. To date, 94 infants have been enrolled in 
the trial; 60 subjects were in  the lower gestational age stratum 240-266 wk and 34  
subjects were in the higher  gestational age stratum 270-286 wk. The Ureaplasma 
respiratory colonization rate at study entry was 54% in  the lower GA stratum  in contrast 
to 16%  colonization rate in more mature infants in the higher GA stratum.  Using a 2 -
sided α level of 0.05 and  assuming 20% of subjects are twins and 5% drop -out rate,  the 
study will have power of 0.8 to detect a 40% difference in the primary outcome of 
survival with Ureaplasma clearance  with enrollment of 30 Ureaplasma- positive inf ants in 
each group (See Table 6, Section 9.2 , p. 46). The change in eligibility criteria to limit 
enrollment to the lower GA stratum  will reduce the number of total enroll ment from  the 
originally planned  180 to 140 to obtain 60 Ureaplasma- positiv e subjects.  All infants 
enrolled and randomized in the trial including those already enrolled with gestational age 
270-286 will be followed until 22 -26 month adjusted age.  Revisions  have been underlined 
in the text. 
 Version Number 5.0 
Version Date 1/302017 
Summary of Revisions Made:  
1. Added Ages and Stage Questionnaire -3 (ASQ -3) as Neurodevelopmental Assessment 
Tool: Since some subjects are unable to return for in -person neurodevelopmental 
assessments (neuromotor exam and BSID -III), the ASQ -3 parental questionnaire has 
Phase IIb AZIP study 7 of 70 Version 5 .0 
  30 Jan 2017  been added as an option since it can be administered by phone, is easily scored, and  
has high sensitivity and negative predictive value to detect neurodevelopmental 
impairment in preterm infants <32 weeks gestation at 22 -26 months adjusted age  1 
(page 39) . 
2. Adjusted windows for follow -up assessment : Due to the chal lenges in reaching some 
parents within the windows for pulmonary assessments at 6, 12, and 22 -26 months 
adjusted age , and neurodevelopmental assessments at 22 -26 months adjusted age, the 
window for the questionnaires now extend from 5 months adjusted age f or the 6 month 
pulmonary assessment through 30 months adjusted age  (page 38) .  
3. Cranial Ultrasound (CUS) and Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) results confirmation: In 
order to confirm accuracy and completeness of CUS and ROP results, all CUS and ROP reports for all subjects will be reviewed blinded to treatment assignment during site 
visits. In addition, independent review of CUS images may be requested for confirmation 
if there are differences in rates of severe IVH (>Grade 2)  by site or treatment assignmen t 
(page 41) .

PPRRÉÉCCIISS    
Study Title: A Phase IIb randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of azithromycin to eradicate Ureaplasma respiratory tract infection in preterm infants  
Objectives  
Ureaplasma spp. respiratory tract colonization is a risk factor for the development of the 
chronic lung disorder bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants 
2,3. 
Preliminary data suggests that Ureaplasma-colonized infants may be at continued 
increased risk for adverse pulmonary outcomes in the first year of life. Trials of antibiotic 
therapy with erythromycin in the first few weeks of life often failed to eradicate 
respiratory colonization and the development of BPD in Ureaplasma-infected infants 4-6. 
There are no current effective therapies for the treatment of  Ureaplasma in preterm 
infants. Our long-term objective is to develop therapies to eradicate Ureaplasma from 
the lungs of preterm infants and prevent or ameliorate Ureaplasma-mediated lung 
inflammation, injury, altered developmental signaling, and fibrosis.  
The azalide antibiotic azithromcyin (AZI) has immunomodulatory properties that make it an ideal candidate for therapy to prevent Ureaplasma-mediated lung injury in preterm 
infants. Azithromycin 1) inhibits neutrophil influx and chemoattractant/cytokine release in murine lung injury models 
7-9; 2) exhibits higher potency than erythromycin against 
clinical Ureaplasma isolates in vitro 10; and 3) is preferentially concentrated in alveolar 
epithelial lining fluid and macrophages 11,12. In a neonatal murine Ureaplasma infection 
model, AZI, but not erythromycin treatment, improved survival and reduced lung inflammation 
13.  
We hypothesize that intravenous (IV) AZI therapy will prevent BPD in Ureaplasma -
colonized preterm infants by accelerating pathogen clearance and/or down-
regulating the pulmonary inflammatory response. We conducted a Phase I open-
label, pharmacokinetic (PK) study characterizing the single dose PK, safety, tolerability, 
and biologic effects of 10 and 20 mg/kg IV AZI in mec hanically ventilated 24-28 wk 
gestation preterm neonates who are at high -risk for Ureaplasma respiratory tract 
colonization and BPD. Pharmacokinetic data from 25 neonates (12 dosed with 10 mg/kg 
iv and 13 dosed with 20 mg/kg iv)  were analyzed using a population modeling  
approach. A two-compartment structural model with the clearance and volume of 
peripheral compartment (V2) allometrically scaled on body weight best described the 
PK of AZI in preterm neonates. Although both single dose regimens appeared to b e 
safe, the single 10 mg/kg dose was  insufficient to eradicate Ureaplasma or to suppress 
pulmonary inflammatory responses. Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that even 
multiple dose administration of 10 mg/kg AZI would be inadequate to maintain AZI 
plasma concentrations above the Ureaplasma MIC 50. Despite apparent clearance of 
ureaplasmas in all infected subjects treated with 20 mg/kg single dose compared to 43% failure rate in the 10 mg/kg group 
14, simulations suggest that multiple azithromycin 
dose regimens may be needed to mainta in a plasma concentration of azithromycin  
above MIC 50 to clear the organisms.  
We then enrolled 15 subjects from 6 sites in a Phase IIa open-label, pharmacokinetic study characterizing the PK, safety, and biologic effects of 20 mg/kg x 3 days AZI 
regimen. Although there was no difference in physiologic BPD rate s among the three 
azithromycin dose groups, the duration of supplemental oxygen was significantly shorter  
and there was a trend towards shorter duration of mechanical ventilation for the 20 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 14 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  mg/kg multi-dose group. Compared to the single dose groups, the 20 mg/kg mulit -dose 
effectively eradicated the Ureaplasma in all subjects who were colonized pre-dose. The 
20 mg/kg x 3 day regimen appeared safe, with no deaths or serious adverse events 
attributed to the drug. The aims of the current protocol will address the next steps 
preparatory to Phase III safety and efficacy trials of AZI in the preterm population. The 
study population includes infants 240-266 weeks gestation due to the high rate of 
Ureaplasma spp. respiratory tract colonization and BPD in this subpopulation.  
Aim 1: To determine the safety and microbiological efficacy of a multiple dose course of 
IV AZI to eradicate respiratory tract Ureaplasma infection that might lead to physiologic BPD in high risk preterm neonates in a Phase II b multi-center, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial.  
 Primary outcome: To compare the Ureaplasma clearance rate in AZI-treated vs 
placebo-treated infants  
 Secondary Outcomes: To analyze the potential of multiple dose AZI to prevent 
physiologic BPD sufficiently to justify a Phase III clinical  trial 
o To evaluate the relationship of microbiologic eradication of Ureaplasma 
respiratory tract colonization in AZI -treated infants and clinical outcome of physiologic 
BPD at 36 wks post-menstrual age 
o To analyze the effect of IV AZI on other secondary endpoints including overall 
mortality, number of days of mechanical ventilation and oxygen supplementation, 
exposure to non-study antibiotics, and incidence of co-morbidities of prematurity 
 
Aim 2: To refine the population PK model of the multiple doses of azithromycin in 
preterm infants 24-28 weeks gestation.  
Aim 3: To analyze the potential of multiple dose AZI to improve the pulmonary 
outcomes at 6, 12, and 22-26 months adjusted age assessed as number and duration 
of hospitalizations, number of physician a nd emergency visits for respiratory illness, 
frequency of pulmonary medication use, and Infant Lung Health Questionnaire parental report of recurrent wheezing or chronic cough.  
Aim 4: To assess the impact of multiple dose AZI on risk for neurodevelopmental 
impairment at 22-26 months adjusted age.  
Design and Outcomes  
The study design will be a double -blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to test the 
efficacy and safety of azithromycin 20 mg/kg x 3 days to eradicate Ureaplasma spp 
from the respiratory tract of preterm infants 240-266 weeks gestation exposed to 
positive pressure ventilation.  The primary outcome will be  survival with microbiological 
eradication of Ureaplasma defined as survival to discharge or transfer with 3 neg ative 
cultures obtained post -therapy. Secondary outcomes will include physiologic BPD at 36 
weeks post-menstrual age (PMA), overall mortality, incidence of co-morbidities of 
prematurity such as intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, 
necrotizing enterocolitis, bacterial and fungal nosocomial infection, pulmonary air leak, 
patent ductus arteriosus, retinopathy of prematurity, number of days of positive 
pressure ventilation, number of days of oxygen supplementation, use of postnatal 
steroids, and use of non-study antibiotics.

    30 Jan 2017  Interventions and Duration  
After obtaining parental consent, 2 tracheal aspirates and one nasopharyngeal  aspirate 
will be obtained at least 2 hours apart for Ureaplasma culture and PCR and the infant 
randomized to either placebo or azithromycin 20 mg/kg IV x 3 days. Follow -up cultures 
will be obtained 2 and 4 -5 days post last dose and at 21d postnatal age (PNA). 
Additional tracheal aspirates for inflammatory cytokine mea surements will be obtained 
on the same schedule if the infant remains intubated. We have completed collection of 
1-3 samples of residual blood specimens between 4 -6 h, 8 -24 h, and 69 -120h post first-
dose from a sub-group of 30 subjects. Subjects will be followed to discharge for safety. 
Physiologic BPD will be assessed at 36±1 wk PMA by a timed -oxygen reduction test.  At 
6, 12, and 22-26 months adjusted age, a pulmonary outcome questionnaire will be administered by phone or in person interview.  At 22-26 mont hs adjusted age, 
neurodevelopmental outcomes will be assessed by  1) Bayley Scale of Infant and 
Toddler Development, 3
rd edition (BSID-III); 2) Amiel-Tison neurologic examination; 3) 
Gross Motor Function Classification System; and 4) medical record review f or hearing 
impairment with or without amplification and vision impairment (vision <20/200).  For 
infants who are unable to return for an inpatient assessment, the Ages and Stages Questionnaire-3 (ASQ-3) will be administered by phone.  
Sample Size and Population  
We will limit the recruitment after January 2016 to infants 24
0-266 wk gestation who are 
at highest risk for Ureaplasma respiratory tract colonization and BPD. All admissions to 
the NICUs of the 7 clinical sites <72 h age with GA 240-266 wk will be screened for 
study eligibility and parental consent of eligible subjects will be obtained.  With a 54% 
colonization rate, a total of 140 subjects will be enrolled to achieve 30 Ureaplasma-
positive subjects in each arm.  Subjects will be stratified by center . Infants will be 
randomized according to a permuted-block design to receive azithromycin or placebo.

physiologic BPD in preterm neonates in a Phase IIb multicenter, randomized, double -

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was first described over 40 years ago as a 
progression of characteristic chest radiographic findings that correlated with pathol ogic 
changes of acute and chronic lung inflammation, fibrosis and bronchial smooth muscle hypertrophy in premature, ventilator -dependent infants 
15,16. With recent improvements 
in perinatal care, BPD has become a disease limited to the most immature infants 17, 
occurring in 30% of infants ≤28 wks gestation, but in only 3% of infants >28 weeks 18. 
Compared to the lung histology observed in the ventilated preterm lung during the pre -
exogenous surfactant era, the ‘new’ BPD is characterized by more uniform inflation, 
fewer but larger alveoli, and less fulminant, but persistent inflammation 19. Studies of 
human infants and experimental animal models indicate that the central event in BPD pathogenesis is the interruption of normal developmental signaling during early stages 
of lung development by lung injury that is often initiated in utero by intrauterine infection and a subsequent dysregulated inflammatory response 
17. 
Despite considerable effort focused on reducing BPD in infants ≤28 wks gestation who are at highest risk, recently studied therapies (post -natal steroids 
20, vitamin A 21, 
caffeine 22,23, inhaled nitric oxide 24,25, and early CPAP 26,27) have had only modest 
impacts on the incidence and severity of BPD. Furthermore, the reduction in early 
pulmonary morbidity may come at the cost of higher neurodevelopmental handicaps 
later in life 28. The effects of these therapies on later pulmonary health are currently 
being evaluated 29,30. None o f these therapies address the potential contribution of 
infections to BPD. 
Persistent Ureaplasma  respiratory tract colonization: Risk factor for BPD: 
Ureaplasma parvum  (serotypes 1, 3, 6, and 14) and U. urealyticum  (serotypes 2, 4, 5, 
7-13) are closely related species of the Mollicutes class that are among the smallest 
free-living, self-replicating cells 2,31,32. All serovars lack cell walls, exhibit limited 
biosynthetic abilities, hydrolyze urea to generate ATP, and adhere to human mucosal surfaces 
2. U. parvum  is the most common species isolated from clinical specimens 2,33. 
Although Ureaplasma spp. are considered commensals in the adult GU tract, they have been implicated in complications of human pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. 
Ureaplasma urogenital tract colonization has been causally linked to infertility 
34,35, early 
pregnancy loss 36, stillbirth 37,38, and preterm birth 39,40. Ureaplasma spp. are the most 
common organisms isolated from amniotic fluid obtained from women who present with 
preterm labor (POL) with intact membranes 41, preterm premature rupture of 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 17 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  membranes 42, and short cervix associated with microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity 
43, and from infected placentas 42. Recovery of Ureaplasma from the chorion increased 
with duration of rupture membranes, suggesting an ascending route of infection 39. 
However, Ureaplasma has also been detected in 22% of placentas with duration of 
membrane rupture < 1h, suggesting the possibility of a pre -existing infection. Indeed, 
Ureaplasma species have been detected in amniotic fluid as early as the time of genetic amniocentesis (16-20 weeks) in up to 13% asymptomatic women 
44-47. Placentas with 
the lowest rate of Ureaplasma recovery were from women delivered for pre-eclampsia 
or intrauterine growth restriction 39. 
Vertical transmission is the only known route of infection in the newborn. The rate of 
respiratory tract colonization with Ureaplasma in infants <1500g birth weight ranges 
from 20-45%, depending on study entry criteria, frequency of sampling and detection methods 
48,49. In a recent cohort of infants <33 wks gestation, Ureaplasma spp. were 
detected during the first week of life in tracheal aspirates or nasopharyngeal specimens in 35% of infants 
50. Ureaplasma respiratory tract colonization is associated with a 
peripheral blood leukocytosis 51 and early radiographic emphysematous changes of 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) 52,53. These findings may be explained, in part, by 
an in utero onset of the inflammatory response and lung injury. The contribution of Ureaplasma respiratory tract colonization to the development of BPD has been debated; 
however, a meta-analysis of 17 clinical studies published before 1995 supported a 
significant association between Ureaplasma respiratory tract colonization and 
development of BPD defined as oxygen dependence at 28 to 30 d postnatal age 
48. In a 
meta-analysis of 36 published studies involving ~3000 preterm infants, Schelonka et 
al.49 observed a significant association between Ureaplasma respiratory colonization 
and development of BPD whether defined as oxygen -dependence at 28 d or at 36 wk 
post menstrual age (PMA). Studies published since the last meta -analysis support the 
association between Ureaplasma respiratory colonization and BPD 54,55, particularly for 
the subset of Ureaplasma-colonized infants exposed to chorioamnionitis and leukocytosis at birth 
55. Some Ureaplasma serovars have been implicated in adverse 
pregnancy outcomes more commonly than others 56-59. Although U. parvum  is more 
commonly isolated from clinical specimens  57,59, there is a higher rate of BPD in U. 
urealyticum  colonized infants 57. Whether there are differences in the in vivo  
response to antibiotic therapy among the serovars or species of Ureaplasma  is 
unknown. 
U. urealyticum modulates the pulmonary immune response : Evidence from studies 
of human preterm infants 60, and intrauterine infection models in mice 61, sheep 62,63, 
and non -human primates 64,65 as well as in vitro studies 66-69 support that Ureaplasma 
infection is pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic and results in a BPD phenotype. In a 
review of lung pathology of archived autopsy specimens from Ureaplasma-infected 
preterm infants, we observed moderate to severe fibrosis and increased elastin fiber accumulation in all Ureaplasma-infected infants compared to non-infected gestational 
controls and infants who died with pneumonia from other causes 
70,71. There were 
increased numbers of myofibroblasts and TNF -alpha and transforming growth factor ß 1 
(TGFß 1)-immunostaining in the lungs of all Ureaplasma-infected infants 70,71. The 
increase in fibrosis and elastin fiber accumulation in the distal lung correlated spatially 
and temporally with the presence of macrophages positive for TGFß 1, suggesting that 
these are closely linked 71. Preterm infants with Ureaplasma respiratory colonization 
have elevated tracheal aspirate IL-1ß, TNF -alpha, and m onocyte chemoattractant 
protein-1 (MCP-1) concentrations and neutrophil chemotactic activity during the first 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 18 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  weeks of life compared to non-colonized infants 60,72,73. Experimental murine intrauterine 
U. parvum  exposure stimulated fetal lung cytokine expression and augmented 
hyperoxia-induced lung injury 61. In the 125 d immature baboon model, we observed 
sustained recruitment  of neutrophils and macrophages into the lung, increased 
expression of pro-inflammatory (TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1ß ) and pro-fibrotic 
cytokines (TGFß 1; oncostatin M), extensive fibrosis, and increased myofibroblast 
phenotype in lungs of antenatal Ureaplasma-infected animals compared to gestational 
controls or non-infected ventilated animals 64,74. In a study of rhesus macaques, 
histologic changes in the fet us’ lungs depended on the duration of intrauterine exposure 
to U. parvum  65. Infection exposure duration less than 136 h resulted in neutrophil 
infiltration without epithelial injury. With progressive duration of exposure there was an influx of neutrophils and macrophages, epithelial necrosis, and type II cell proliferation. 
For exposure duration >10 d, increased collagen and thickened alveolar walls were evident. These data confirm that Ureaplasma infection contributes to chronic 
inflammation and fibrosis in the preterm lung. Moreover , these data suggest that 
Ureaplasma acts as a co-inflammatory stimulus by causing an augmented, 
dysregulated inflammatory response to subsequent inflammatory insults such as 
hyperoxia and volutrauma. We propose that Ureaplasma  may contribute to lung 
injury and fibrosis by modulating the local immune response to produce 
sustained chronic inflammation.  
Potential role of AZI to prevent Ureaplasma -mediated neonatal lung injury : Despite 
in vitro susceptibility of Ureaplasma to erythromycin 75 and favorable PK activity 76, trials 
of erythromycin therapy in Ureaplasma-colonized preterm infants have failed to 
demonstrated efficacy to prevent BPD 4,5 or to eradicate respiratory tract colonization 6. 
The failure to prevent BPD in these studies may have been due to the small sample size of each study, or to initiation of erythromycin therapy to late to prevent the lung 
inflammation and injury that contribute to the pathogenesis of BPD. Demonstra tion of 
efficacy of antibiotic therapy to prevent BPD in Ureaplasma-colonized preterm infants 
will require carefully designed, adequately powered studies.  
The 14 -membered macrolides that are derivatives of erythromycin and the related 15 -
member azalides have immunomodulatory effects, including effects on neutrophil 
function (e.g. chemotaxis, cell adhesion, oxidative burst, phagocytosis) and inhibition of 
release of cytokines involved in acute inflammation (e.g., IL -1ß, IL -8, TNF -alpha) 
77-79 
and chronic inflammation (IL-12p40) 80 and NO 2- production in vitro 81. The macrolide 
antibiotics may exert these immunomodulatory effects in the setting of infection, and 
may occur independently of a direct bactericidal effect 82. AZI inhibits neutrophil influx 
and chemoattractant/cytokine release in murine lung noninfectious 7,9, as well as 
pneumonia 8,83 injury models. In addition, AZI exhibits higher potency than  erythromycin 
against clinical Ureaplasma isolates in vitro 10,75,84. Pharmacokinetic studies in mice 85 
and humans have shown that AZI is preferentially concentrated in pulmonary epithelial 
lining fluid and alveolar macrophages 11,12. Since neutrophil recruitment and activation 
has been implicated in BPD pathogenesis 86-88, the experimental effects observed with 
AZI in vitro and in vivo indicate that this drug may be beneficial in the treatment of 
Ureaplasma infection and the prevention of BPD in preterm infants. Taken together, 
these properties suggest that AZI is an ideal candidate for therapy to prevent Ureaplasma -mediated lung injury  in preterm infants at high risk for BPD.  
Since Ureaplasma-mediated lung injury may be initiated in utero and augmented 
postnatally by exposure to mechanical ventilation and hyperoxia, therapy to prevent 
BPD should be initiated as soon as possible after b irth in infants at risk. This contention 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 19 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  was supported by the recent study by Walls et al.  13 demonstrating that AZI, but not 
erythromycin prophylaxis improved outcomes and reduced inflammation in a murine 
neonatal Ureaplasma infection model. However, in a single center RCT pilot study, AZI 
(10 mg/kg/d x 7d followed by 5 mg/kg/d up to 6 wks) did not reduce the incidence of BPD at 36 wk PMA 
89. In a follow -up larger trial, Ureaplasma clearance and BPD rates 
were similar in the placebo and AZI -treated groups 90. These results underscore the 
importance of performing appropriate PK/pharmacodynamic studies preparatory to phase II/III trials to assess microbiological and clinical efficacy of AZI. 
Safety and Tolerance of AZI in the Pediatric Population: The safety and tolerability 
of oral AZI has been evaluated in 3995 patients aged 2 to 94 91. The overall rate of side 
effects is 12% with gastrointestinal symptoms the most common. Ototoxicity, although 
rare, has been reported with IV AZI in adults and included reversible tinnitus and 
hearing loss 92. A review of 43 open label, randomized pediatric trials performed outside 
the US that included 2655 patients treated with a 3 day course (10 mg/kg once daily) oral AZI for upper respiratory tract infections reported adverse effects in 8.7% subjects, 
primarily gastrointestinal symptoms 
93. In a recent PK study of a single dose of IV AZI in 
32 children ages 6 months to 16 years, there were no serious adverse events. Nausea 
was the most common treatment related symptom, reported in 25% pa tients.  
Association of AZI with infantile  hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: Although treatment 
with erythromycin in the first few months of life has been associated occasionally with 
the development of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) 93,94, a recent report of 
an analysis of  the association of prescriptions for oral azithromycin, erythromycin, or 
cephalexin during the first 90 days of life and diagnosis of pyloric stenosis (IHPS) in a 
retrospective cohort study of children born 2001 -2012 utilizing the military health system 
database suggested an increased risk for IHPS with AZI exposure in the first 14 days of life
95. Of 1,074,236 infants reviewed, 2,466 developed IHPS in the  study period 
(2.29/1000). Of 4,875 infants prescribed oral azithromycin, 8 developed IHPS (1.64 per 1000). All 8 affected infants were male. The median number of days IHPS developed 
after AZI prescription was 29.5 d (9-45 d). The relative risk for developing IHPS with AZI exposure during first 90 days of life: 0.71 (95%CI 0.36 -1.43; P=0.34. The highest rate of 
IHPS occurred when AZI exposure was within the first 14 d of life (3/148 (2%); aOR 8.26; 95%CI 2.62 -26, P<0.01). In all cases, oral AZI was prescribed for treatment for 
Chlamydia conjunctivitis or pneumonia and treatment/prophylaxis against Bordetella pertussiss. Of note, in a separate report analyzing the association of prematurity and 
IHPS in the same cohort, there was an increase in IHPS for preterms 33 -37 weeks 
gestation, but not in preterms ≤32 weeks gestation 
96. This study did not include data on 
inpatient macrolide exposures and did not address IV azithromycin. Due to immaturity of 
intestinal motilin receptors, oral erythromycin has little effect on intestinal motility in preterm infants <32 weeks gestation and intravenous erythromycin does not affect 
intestinal motility in preterms
97. So it is unlikely that either oral or IV azithromycin will 
affect intestinal function and risk for IHPS in the very preterm study population.  
Azithromycin and the risk of potentially fatal heart rhythms : Azithromycin is 
proarrhythmic with prior reports of occurrences of QT -interval prolongation, and 
torsades de pointes 98. Recently, a retrospective study of a large Tennessee Medicaid 
cohort detected a small absolute increased risk of cardiovascular death (hazard ratio, 
2.88; 95% CI, 1.79 -4.63) in adults who took a 5 day course of azithromycin compared to 
individuals who took no antibiotics 98. There were 47 additional cardiovascular deaths 
per 1 million azithromycin courses. The increased risk for cardiovascular death was highest among patients with a high baseline risk for cardiovascular disease.  
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 20 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  The FDA independently reviewed the study data and released a Drug Safety 
Communication on 3/12/2013 summarizing their findings and recommendations. The 
FDA noted important limitations of the study including 1) lack of randomization so 
patients who received different drugs might have differed in ways that biased the 
results; 2) study limited to patients treated as outpatients, so patients treated for severe 
or life-threatening infections were likely not included; 3) cardiovascular deaths were 
determined by death certificates rather than full medical records; and 4) some 
limitations to the statistical methods. However, the FDA found that the overall finding of 
excess risk of cardiovascular death in the azithromycin treated patients was valid and 
that the excess risk of cardiovascular death, especially of sudden death, is consistent 
with arrhythmias from drug-related QT prolongation. In addition the FDA evaluated the 
results of a clinical QT study conducted by the manufacturer assessing the effects of 
azithromycin on the QT interval in adults. In a randomized, placebo -controlled parallel 
trial, 116 healthy subjects received either chloroquine (1000 mg) alone or in combination with azithromycin (500 mg, 1000 mg, and 1500 mg once daily). In 
comparison to chloroquine alone, the maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) 
increases in QTcF were 5 (10) ms, 7 (12) ms and 9 (14) ms with the co-administration 
of 500 mg, 1000 mg, and 1500 mg azithromycin, respectively (see attached Drug label, 
p. 7), indicating that co-administration of azithromycin increases the QTc in a dose- and 
concentration-dependent manner. The FDA identified the following groups at higher risk 
of torsades de pointes and fatal arrhythmia:  
o Patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, a history o f torsades de 
pointes, congenital long QT syndrome, bradyarrhythmias, or uncompensated 
heart failure 
o Patients on drugs known to prolong the QT interval  
o Patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions such as uncorrected hypokalemia 
or hypomagnesemia, clinic ally significant bradycardia, and in patients receiving 
Class IA (quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (dofetilide, amiodarone, stalol) antiarrhythmic agents 
 
The implications of this study for azithromycin use in newborns and children are 
unclear. There is a single case report in the literature of cardiac arrest with suspected 
prolonged QT in a 9 month old who inadvertently received 50 mg/kg azithromycin 
intravenously over 20 minutes 
99. Prolonged QT interval is rare in newborns with an 
incidence of the heritable long QT syndromes estimated between 1 per 3000 and 1 per 5000 births 
100. Based on a retrospective study of prolonged QT interval in neonates, 
Villain and co-workers 101 suggest that infants presenting with a QTc<0.5 second 
normalize their QTc over time while infants with a QTc>0.6 second are at risk for severe 
arrhythmias and sudden cardiovascular death. Prolonged QTc  (>0.45 s) was no t 
detected in any of the 171 preterm infants screened for the 10 mg/kg and 20mg/kg single dose studies or any of the 192 infants screened for the  20 mg/kg x 3d multi-dose 
study.  
There are no known interactions of AZI with other drugs. The potential for th ese adverse 
outcomes will be carefully evaluated in our clinical trials of AZI in preterm infants.  
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic of single and multiple doses of AZI in 
preterm infants: 
We have completed a Phase I open-label, pharmacokinetic (PK) study characterizing 
the single dose PK, safety, tolerability, and biologic effects of 10 and 20 mg/kg IV AZI in 
mechanically ventilated 24-28 wk gestation preterm neonates who are at high -risk for 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 21 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  Ureaplasma respiratory tract colonization and BPD. A two-compartment structural 
model with the clearance and volume of peripheral compartment (V2) allometrically 
scaled on body weight best described the PK of AZI in preterm neonates. The single 10 
mg/kg and 20 mg/kg dose regimens were safe, but did not suppress pulmonary 
inflammatory responses. The 10 mg/kg single dose was insufficient to eradicate 
Ureaplasma, but there were no treatment failures in the 20 mg/kg group. 
Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that even mu ltiple dose administration of 10 mg/kg 
AZI would be inadequate to maintain AZI plasma concentrations above the Ureaplasma 
MIC 50, while multiple doses of 20 mg/kg might provide a favorable AUC 24/MIC 90 ratio. 
We subsequently completed the AZIP2 trial charact erizing the multiple dose PK, safety, 
and biologic effects of 20 mg/kg x3 days regimen. Fifteen subjects 24-28 wk gestation 
(7 of whom were Ureaplasma-positive pre-dose) were enrolled and received all 3 doses 
of study drug and all were followed to the primary clinical endpoint of BPD at 36 weeks 
PMA. The population PK model was refined with the addition of the 15 subjects from the 
multi-dose study. The best model to describe the PK parameters  of AZI in preterm 
infants based on 40 subjects (10 mg/kg single d ose (N=12); 20 mg/kg single dose 
(N=13); and 20 mg/kg multiple dose (N=15)) is the 2 compartment model with all 
parameters scaled on body weight. Although the percent relative standard error was low 
for each PK parameter, the intersubject variability is hi gh due to the small number of 
subjects in the multiple dose group.  
 
Table 1. Population Pharmacokinetic Parameter Estimates in Preterm Infants 
(N=40) 
The mean observed 
plasma concentration of 
AZI in the 15 subjects in 
the multiple dose study 
(Fig. 1) exceeded the 
MIC 50 of 1 µg/ml for 
Ureaplasma isolates 14. 
This may explain in part 
the effective eradication of 
Ureaplasma from the 
respiratory tract in infants 
who received 20 mg/kg x 3 
day regimen (Fig. 2). 
There were no follow-up 
positive cultures and only one sample that was PCR positive 4 -5 days post past dose in 
the Ureaplasma-infected group.  There was no increase in frequency of events 
potentially related to azithromycin use such as feeding intolerance, sepsis, or hearing loss with the higher dose. The doses were well-tolerated and there were no adverse 
events attributed to the drug.  Parameter Estimate (%RSE) %ISV (%RSE)

Although not all epidemiologic studies linking Ureaplasma spp. respiratory tract 
colonization with BPD evaluated the duration of colonization 2,3, Catro-Alcaraz et al.  102 
observed that persistent, not transient respiratory colonization increased the risk for 
BPD at 36 wk PMA. In their cohort, transient colonization occurred in 35% while 
persistent colonization occurred in 45%. Late a cquisition was found in 20%. In a recent 
prospectively recruited cohort of 112 infants <32 wk gestation with serial respiratory cultures, we observed transient colonization (defined as 1 -2 positive cultures in the first 
wk followed by 1 or more negative cultures > 1 wk of age) rate of 25%. It is likely that persistently positive serial cultures represent true infection and/or ineffective immune 
response while transient detection represents colonization. To determine the 
microbiologic efficacy of IV azithromycin to eradicate Ureaplasma from the preterm 
lung, we will conduct a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled clinical 
trial of azithromycin 20 mg/kg x 3 days. This endpoint is important to plan for a Phase III 
clinical trial to determine if ureaplasmal eradication improves short -term (BPD) and 
long-term pulmonary outcomes.  
From 11/2013 to 12/2016, 94 subjects have been enrolled  in this Phase IIb trial. Initially, 
2 GA strata (240-266 and 270-286 wk) were included, but the Ureaplasma respiratory 
colonization rate was 16% in the higher GA stratum and 54% in the lower GA stratum . 
To limit enrollment to the GA stratum with the highest Ureaplasma respiratory 
colonization rate and to reduce the exposure of non -colonized infants to the potential 
risks associated with azithromycin, eligibility criteria will be changed in January 2016 to 
limit the study population to infants 240-266 wk gestation who are at highest risk for 
Ureaplasma respiratory tract colonization and BPD. We will utilize the UAB Diagnostic 
Mycoplasma Laboratory as a central reference laboratory for Ureaplasma culture, 
genotyping, and azithromycin susceptibility testing. Therefore, infants will receive study 
drug before Ureaplasma colonization status is known. This approach is justified since

The study design will be a double -blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to test the 
efficacy and safety of azithromycin 20 mg/kg IV x 3 days to eradicate Ureaplasma spp 
from the respiratory tract of preterm infants 240 to 266 weeks gestation (after January 
2016; 240-286 wk GA January 2016 or earlier) exposed to positive pressure ventilation. 
A total of 140 infants will be randomized to either azithromycin (N=70) or placebo 
(N=70) stratified by center. The primary outcome will be  survival with microbiological 
eradication of Ureaplasma defined as survival to discharge or transfer with 3 negative 
cultures obtained post -therapy. Secondary outcomes will include physiologic BPD at 36 
weeks post-menstrual age (PMA), overall mortality, incidence of co -morbidities of 
prematurity such as intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis, bacterial and fungal nosocomial infection, pulmonary air leak, 
patent ductus arteriosus, retinopathy of prematurity, number of days of positive pressure 
ventilation, number of days of oxygen supplementation, use of postnatal ster oids, and 
use of non-study antibiotics. Subjects will be enrolled in 7 level III NICUs (3 sites in 
Baltimore, MD (University of Maryland Medical Center, Mercy Medical Center, Johns 
Hopkins Hospital); Christiana Care Health Services, Newark, DE; University of Virginia, 
Charlottesville, VA;  University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL ; and Monroe 
Carell Jr. Children¹s Hospital at Vanderbilt , Nashville, TN). Subjects will be followed  to 
22-26 months adjusted age. The University of Maryland will provide data management  
and laboratory coordination. The Diagnostic Mycoplasma Laboratory under the dir ection 
of Dr. Ken Waites will serve as the central laboratory for all Ureaplasma culture, PCR, 
and antibiotic susceptibility testing.

All admissions to the NICUs of the 7 clinical sites <72 h age with gestational age 240 to 
266 wk (after January 2016; 240-286 wk GA January 2016 or earlier) will be screened 
daily by research staff  for study eligibility and parental consent of eligib le subjects will 
be obtained  (Procedure Schedule, Appendix B ). All admissions <72h age and 240 to 266 
weeks gestation by best obstetric estimate will be further screened for eligibility.  For 
each screened potential subject , an eligibility checklist (CRF AZIP01) will be completed 
and entry added to a screening log with site-specific numeric patient identification 
number (PID) and letter code (LETCODE) (Sample Screening Log, Appendix A). The 
screening log with patient identifiers is maintained at each site in a secure locati on and 
is not submitted to the Data Coordinating Center. As part of the screening process, an 
electrocardiogram (EKG) QTc interval will be calculated from lead II from a potential 
subject’s monitor and a copy of rhythm strip and QTc calculation submitted on CRF 
AZIP02 for enrolled subject .  
If the answer to all inclusion criteria is yes and answer to all exclusion criteria is no, study personnel will approach parent(s) to discuss the resea rch study and request 
informed consent. If a potential subject is eligible, but consent is not obtained , a reason 
(e.g. missed, maternal age <18, parent/LAR refused consent, non-English speaking 
parent/LAR) will be required on the submitted eligibility checklist CRF (AZIP01). If an 
infant qualifies, the PI or coordinator will obtain informed parental consent prior to 
initiation of study procedures. An EKG for QTc measurement will be obtained after 
consent if not done previously during the screening process.  If the PI is also responsible 
for the clinical care of a potential subject, he/she will not participate in the consent 
discussion with the parents to avoid undue pressure on the parents to agree to the 
study. The information provided in the consent will c over the elements listed in the CFR 
Part 50.25 and be approved by the site  Institutional Review Board (IRB). This includes 
the investigational nature and objectives of the trial; the procedures and treatments 
involved and their attendant risks, discomforts , and benefits; and the potential 
alternative therapies, alternative to not participate and right to withdraw without penalty will be explained. The study staff personnel will offer to answer any questions.  
In the consent process, banking (storage) of Ureaplasma samples isolated from positive 
subjects will be explained to parents. They can decline banking of their child’s 
specimens and still participate in this study. They can indicate on the consent form 
whether they would be willing or not to be contacte d for future studies of their child’s 
banked specimens. For each question (banking vs no banking; future contact or not), the parent will initial their choice.

    30 Jan 2017  If a parent consents to their child’s participation, t he parent will sign and date the 
consent form. One copy of the signed consent form will be provided to the parents,  
another copy will be placed in the child’s medical record and the original signed consent 
form will be kept in a secure file at each site. Written documentation of the consent 
process will be placed in the medical record. The subject will be assigned a study 
identification number. The study identification number will be recorded on all study 
forms. (See Section 16.1 for model consent form). 
4.3.1 Randomization procedure:  
There will be separate randomization schedules for each center . Infants will be 
randomized according to a permuted-block design to receive azithromycin or placebo. 
Twins will be randomized together to the same study arm. Randomization schedules 
prepared by the UMB biostatistician will be provided to the AZIP Randomization Center located at Axio Research (Seattle, WA) that will establish a web-based randomization 
site available 24 hours/day and seven days a week . Separate randomization schedules 
for each stratum within each clinical site will be prepared. The randomizations on the 
schedules will be in varying block sizes of two, four and six to force approximate 
balance of azithromycin and placebo treatment  assignments at each clinical site. The 
University of Maryland I nvestigational Drug Service (UMB Coordinating Pharmacy) will 
receive the randomization number assignments for each site to prepar e study drug 
shipments. The UMB Coordinating Pharmacy will ship to the study pharmacist at each 
site numbered study drug kits f or active drug and sealed envelopes each labeled with a 
site-specific randomization number and containing a label for “azithromycin” or “placebo”. Each randomization is documented for time of issue on the computer system 
and under whose user ID authority t he allocation is issued (i.e., who requested the 
randomization). Once a randomization number is assigned and study pharmacist is 
notified,  he/she will open the corresponding envelope, prepare  the appr opriate drug or 
placebo, and attach the label from the opened envelope on the drug accountability log . 
For study drug, one vial per dose will be reconstituted with D5W to final concentration of 
2 mg/ml. For placebo, an equivalent volume of D5W will be prepared.  Axio Research 
will cooperate with the UMB Coordinating Pharmacy in kit preparation, labeling and 
shipping to maintain an adequate inventory at each clinical site. In the event of 
enrollment of twins, the system will specify two numbers containing the same, blinded 
treatment. Axio Research randomization application will provide unbl inded reports to 
assist UMB Coordinating Pharmacy staff in maintaining appropriate levels of drug kits at each site. A customized web page will allow the unblinded pharmacist to indicate to the 
application which kits have been sent to and received by the clinical sites (i.e., available 
for dispensing at randomization).

5.1.1 Drug Dose Selection Rationale 
We have selected a multiple dose for evaluation in this proposal based on the 
population PK model that includes the 10 mg/kg single dose (N=12) and 20 mg/kg 
single (N=13) and multiple dose  (N=15) PK, and the clinical experience in older children 
with respiratory tract infections. The PK properties of AZI support short courses of therapy. The drug has a long elimination half -life (>50 h), is concentrated in phagocytic 
cells with good tissue penetration, especially in lung, and persists in tissues for much 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 26 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  longer than in plasma 103. Pharmacodynamic studies suggest that it is the 
AUC 24(u)/MIC 90 ratio that is most predictive of AZI efficacy 104. Increasing the dose is 
more effective than increasing duration of treatment for increasing the AUC 24/MIC 90 
ratio. Results of experimental infections in animal models suggest that increasing the 
dose early in the infectious process will result in clearance of even marginally 
susceptible organisms 105.  
Although optimal AUC 24(u)/MIC 90 ratios for AZI to eradicate other common organisms 
were reported to range from 0.5 to 14.8 h 106, the optimal AUC 24(u)/MIC 90 for AZI to 
effectively eradicate Ureaplasma is still unknown.  Based on our recent clinical study in 
preterm neonates, a dosage regimen of 20 mg/kg/d x 3d IV AZI was deemed safe and 
effective and resulted in an AUC 24(u)/MIC 90  ratio of 5.69 as indicated in Table 2.  
Table 2. AUC 24 and AUC 24/MIC 90 for potential dose regimens for Ureaplasma 
therapy. 
As such, we predict that an AUC
24(u)/MIC 90 ratio of > 5.69 h is needed 
in order for AZI dosage regimen to eradicate ureaplasma in preterm 
neonates. 
The data from the 20 mg/kg multiple dose 
Phase IIa study confirmed the simulations 
and Ureaplasma was eradicated from the 
respiratory tract of all subjects colonized 
pre-dose. The  proposed short course will 
reduce development of drug resistance and limit the risk for increased mortality 
and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) recently reported for preterm infants exposed to a prolonged duration of initial empirical antibiotic treatment 
107. The 3 day 20 mg/kg oral 
AZI regimen is well tolerated in older children 93, and is more effective in treating 
recurrent or persistent otitis media than high dose amoxicillin -clavulanate 108 and group 
A streptococcal tonsillopharynigitis than 3 d 10 mg/kg dose oral AZI or 10 d penicillin V 
109,110. 
5.1.2 Drug Dosage, Administration, and Schedule  
After baseline safety laboratory tests and 2 tracheal aspirate samples at least 2 h apart 
and one nasopharyngeal sample for Ureaplasma culture and PCR from intubated 
infants, or 2 NP samples at least 2h apart from non-intubated infants have been obtained, study infants will receive according to randomization assignment, either 
azithromycin administered at a concentration of 2 mg/ml  in D5W or placebo of same 
volume D5W as a single intravenous infusion over 60  ± 5 min using a functioning 
intravenous line within 24 h of enrollment. The dose will be calculated as 20 mg/kg actual body weight. Each subject’s actual body weight at the time of study entry will be 
used for determining the injection volume of study drug.  For study drug, one vial per 
dose will be reconstituted with D5W to final concentration of 2 mg/ml. For placebo, an 
equivalent volume of D5W will be prepared.  A total of 3 doses will be administered at 24 
± 0.5 h intervals. A pharmacist from the Investigational Drug Service Pharmacy for each site will be responsible for dispensing and accounting for study drug. A NICU nurse will 
administer the study drug.

    30 Jan 2017  Enrolled subjects will receive 3 doses of azithromycin  or placebo and will be followed for 
safety until discharge or transfer or 44 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA), whichever 
comes first. Respiratory cultures for Ureaplasma will be obtained pr e-dose and 2d, 4-5 d 
post last dose and 21 d of age.  A room air challenge test will be performed when the 
infant is 36 ± 1 weeks post -menstrual age or at discharge if earlier.  A respiratory 
outcome questionnaire will be administered at 6 , 12, and 22-26 months corrected age 
by phone or in-person interview.  A comprehensive neurodevelopmental assessment will 
be performed at 22-26 months adjusted age.  
5.1.4 Stopping Rules for Individual Subjects  
Discontinuation Infusion of Study Drug : Study drug administration will be delayed or 
discontinued if any subject has evidence of an arrhythmia on the cardiac monitor (they 
will all have continuous cardiopulmonary monitoring) or an ongoing proarrhythmic 
condition such as hypokalemia (serum potass ium < 3.5 mEq/L), hyperkalemia (serum 
potassium >6.5 mEq/L on non-hemolyzed specimen), hypomagnesemia (total serum Magnesium ≤ 1.6 mg/dL), hypocalcemia (ionized calcium < 3.0 mg/dL (<0.75 mmol/L)) 
or hypothermia (core temperature ≤ 35°C) until corrected by the clinical care team.  
Infusion of study drug will be discontinued for any of the following changes in vital signs 
unless it can be remedied by a simple maneuver (e. g., correcting the patency of the 
airway, reestablishment of artificial airway, simple st imulation for apnea of prematurity, 
etc.): Decrease in BP that requires fluid bolus or pharmacologic support, or sustained 
HR less than 80 bpm. If Study Drug is permanently discontinued due to an AE, including 
the above, this will be recorded on the AE CRF  and the subject continued to be followed 
until discharge or transfer.  
5.1.5 Plans for Study Interruption Based on Safety Monitoring 
The D SMB members will review all deaths and all adverse reactions or suspected 
adverse reactions and make recommendations concerning continuation of the trial.  The 
sites are required to submit reports of all adverse events that are serious and 
unexpected regardless of relationship to study drug within 5 business days to the 
sponsor. The sponsor will forward all reports to Dr. Agthe the clinical monitor for review 
of possible relationship to drug and to the DSMB chair. The DSMB chair may request treatment assignment after reviewing the initial report or at the time of the monthly 
summary report.  A summary of cumulative serious adverse events by study arm will be 
provided by the Data Coordinating Center to the DSMB chair monthly.  The DSMB will 
meet to review safety data after 50% enrollment. The DSMB recommended that there 
be no pre-specified stopping rules for the study, but rather agreed to review SAEs as 
they occur. The DSMB chair may call a DSMB meeting to specifically review safety 
concerns. The DSMB recommendations may include study termination, study 
continuation with protocol modifications (e.g.,  change in eligibility criteria), or temporary 
suspension of enrollment until further evaluation is completed. Per DSMB recommendations,  any death that occurs within 30 d of drug administration will be 
reviewed by the DSMB with each death occurrence.   
5.1.6 Dose Adjustments 
No dose adjustments will be made in this study. If the existing IV line stops functioning during the study drug infusion, the remainder of the drug infusion will be given via a 
second IV site. If all IV access is lost during the study drug infusion, the amount infused 
will be recorded and the remainder of study drug returned to the investigational study pharmacy.

5.2.1 Packaging and Formulation 
Azithromycin will be manufactured and packaged by American Pharmaceuticals 
Partners (Schaumburg, IL) and shipped using appropriate clinical trial drug distribution 
procedures. Azithromycin for injection will be supplied in lyophilized form under a 
vacuum in a 10 ml vial equivalent to 500 mg of azithromyci n for intravenous 
administration. For study drug, one vial per dose will be reconstituted with D5W to final concentration of 2 mg/ml. An initial solution of 100 mg/ml azithromycin for injection will 
be prepared by adding 4.8 ml of sterile water for injecti on to the 500 mg vial and 
shaking the vial until all of the drug is dissolved. To provide the azithromycin in the final 
concentration of 2 mg/ml, 1 ml (100 mg) of the reconstituted drug will be transferred to a 
syringe containing 49 ml dextrose 5% injectio n and the syringe will be inverted several 
times to mix completely. When diluted in this manner, azithromycin for injection is stable for 24 hrs at or below room temperature (30°C or 86°F) or for 7 days, if stored under 
refrigeration (5°C or 41°F). Placebo will be an equal volume of D5W.   
5.2.2 Labeling  
Information presented in the label for study medication will comply with hospital investigational pharmacy and local regulatory requirements.  
5.2.3 Storage 
The reconstituted azithromycin will be stored in a refrigerator. The reconstituted drug is 
stable for 7 days if stored under refrigeration (5°C or 41°F). For the study, one vial per 
dose will be prepared. Vials of azithromycin or placebo will not be used if any particulate 
matter or discoloration is observed. Records of the actual storage conditions during the 
period of the study will be maintained.  
5.2.4 Preparation 
The azithromycin will be supplied in lyophilized form under a vacuum in a 10 ml vial equivalent to 500 mg of azithromycin for intravenous administration. Each vial also 
contains sodium hydroxide and citric acid.  To prepare each dose of azithromycin, using 
aseptic technique, 4.8 ml of sterile water for injection will be added to the 500 mg vial 
and mixed by shaking the vial until all drug is dissolved. Each mL of reconstituted sol-
ution will contain 100 mg azithromycin. This solution is stable for 24 hours when stored below 30°C or 86°F. To provide azithromycin in the final concentration of 2 mg/ml, 1 ml 
of the 100 mg/ml azithromycin solution will  be added to 49 ml dextrose 5% injection ml 
of 5% dextrose in water in a syringe. The patient specific dose of azithromycin 2 mg/ml is drawn up and dispensed as a syringe to be inf used intravenously over 60± 5 min. If 
the subject’s weight is ≤ 0.94 kg, the dose may be ordered to the 1/10 of 1 ml using a 10 
ml syringe for administration with a syringe pump (example 0.94 kg x 10 ml/kg= 9.4 ml of 2 mg/ml azithromycin or equal volume of D5W). For subjects >0.94 kg, a 20 ml 
syringe with 1ml gradiations will be re quired, and the ordered drug volume should be 
rounded to nearest ml (example subject weight 1.23 kg x 10 ml/kg=12.3 ml, so 12 ml should be ordered).  For placebo, an equivalent volume of D5W will be administered  IV 
over 60±5 min. 
5.2.5 Supply and Return of Drug  
The University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) Investigational Drug Service will be Pharmacy Coordinating Center for the study. Azithromycin study drug kits will be 
packaged, labeled, and distributed to the study site pharmacies by the UMMC 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 29 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  Coordinating Pharmacy. Only 1 study drug kit will be used for each enrolled subject; 
each kit will have a unique number. At study initiation, and as needed thereafter, 
azithromycin kits will be shipped to a responsible person (e.g. pharmacist) at the 
Investigational Drug Service of each participating center, who will check the amount and 
condition of the study drug and enter this data into a Proof of Receipt form and 
Investigational Product Accountability Record (see next section). The Proof of Receipt 
form should then be faxed to the UMMC Coordinating Pharmacy. The Investigational 
Drug Pharmacy will record the final disposition of all study drug.  
5.2.6 Drug Accountability 
The study pharmacist at each site will submit monthly accountability logs to the UMB Coordinat ing Pharmacy. The PI Dr. Viscardi is responsible for the accountability of all 
used and unused trial supplies. The following information will be recorded:  
a. The batch number, dates and quantities of the drug received from supplier  
b. Subject’s identification (subject number, letter code, and study drug number) 
c. Date and quantity of drug dispensed  
d. The initials of the dispensing individual

All infants admitted less than 72 h of age with gestational age 240 to 266 weeks gestation (after 
January 2016; 240-286 wk GA January 2016 or earlier) by best obstetric estimate will be screened 
for eligibility. A QTc interval will be calculated from the lead II of the heart rate monitor either before 
consent procedure or after consent is obtained , but before any other study procedures commence. 
If the QTc is >450 ms, the subject is ineligible for participation in the study. For each screened 
potential subject, an eligibility checklist (CRF AZIP01) will be completed and entry added to a 
screening log with site-specific numeric patient identification number (PID) and letter code 
(LETCODE). The screening log with patient identifiers is maintained at each site in a secure 
location and is not submitted to the Data Coordinating C enter. 
6.2.2 Consenting Procedure 
If the answer to all inclusion criteria is yes and answer to all exclusion criteria is no, study 
personnel will approach parent(s) to discuss the research study and request informed consent. If a 
potential subject is eligible, but consent is not obtained, a reason (e.g . missed, maternal age <18, 
parent/LAR refused consent, non-English speaking parent/LAR) will be required on the submitted eligibility checklist CRF (AZIP01). If an infant qualifies, the PI or coordinator will obtain informed 
parental consent prior to init iation of study procedures. An EKG for QTc measurement will be 
obtained after consent if not done previously during the screening process.  If the PI is also 
responsible for the clinical care of a potential subject, he/she will not participate in the consen t 
discussion with the parents to avoid undue pressure on the parents to agree to the study. The 
information provided in the consent will cover the elements listed in the CFR Part 50.25 and be 
approved by the site Institutional Review Board (IRB). This incl udes the investigational nature and 
objectives of the trial; the procedures and treatments involved and their attendant risks, discomforts, and benefits; and the potential alternative therapies, alternative to not participate and 
right to withdraw without penalty will be explained. The study staff personnel will  offer to answer 
any questions.  
In the consent process, banking (storage) of Ureaplasma samples isolated from positive subjects 
will be explained to parents. They can decline banking of their child’s  specimens and still

 If a parent consents to their child’s participation, the parent will sign and date the consent form. One copy of the signed consent form will be provided to the parents,  another copy will be placed in 
the child’s medical record and the original signed consent form will be kept in a secure file at each site. Written documentation of the consent process will be placed in the medical record. The 
subject will be assigned a study identification number. The study identifi cation number will be 
recorded on all study forms. (See Section 16.1 for model consent form). 
6.2.3 Screening 
All screening evaluations, completion of eligibility checklist, and informed consent must be 
obtained within 72 h of birth. All screened infants must meet all of the inclusion criteria to 
participate in this study. All screened infants meeting any of the exclusion criteria at baseline will 
be excluded from study participation.  
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 32 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  Specific inclusion criteria to be determined:  
 Gestational age 240-266 weeks (after January 2016; 240-286 wk GA January 2016 or earlier) 
by best obstetric estimate: Infant must be between 24 weeks 0 days and 26 weeks and 6 
days gestation to be eligible for the study. The gestational age estimate will be based on a 
hierarchy of the available information with the order from most to least accurate estimate 
(date of intrauterine insemination > fetal ultrasound before the 14th week; fetal ultrasound at 
14 or more weeks (if no earlier ultrasounds) > last menstr ual period (LMP) without fetal 
ultrasound> gestational age by Ballard exam in absence of fetal ultrasounds or LMP.  
 Positive pressure ventilation for at least 1 h duration during the first 72 h of life . This is 
defined as receipt of positive pressure by int ubation and mechanical ventilation or nCPAP 
for at least 1 continuous hour. The criterion will be met if the hour of positive pressure is by one of the modes of ventilation (mechanical ventilation or nCPAP) or combination (e.g. 
intubation for exogenous sur factant administration followed by extubation to nCPAP).  
 Presence of indwelling intravenous line for drug administ ration 
Specific exclusion criteria to be determined:  
 Any patient judged to be non-viable or for whom withdrawal of life support is planned . 
Viable, as it pertains to the neonate, means being able, after delivery, to survive (given the 
benefit of available medical therapy) to the point of independently maintaining heartbeat and 
respiration, in the opinion of the attending neonatologist . Neonates for whom death is 
considered imminent or are unresponsive to medical cardio -respiratory support defined as 
persistent hypoxemia (PaO
2<40), hypercarbia (PaCO 2>80) and acidosis (pH< 7.0) for >12 h 
will be considered non-viable for study criteria.  
 Major lethal congenital anomalies : Those anomalies that will likely result in death such as 
renal agenesis, pulmonary hypoplasia, cyanotic congenital heart disease.  
 Triplets or higher order multiples  are excluded 
 Patients delivered for maternal indications . Maternal indications include, but are not limited 
to pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, pulmonary hypertension, trauma, or malignancy.  Patients 
whose mothers have these conditions (e.g. pre -eclampsia, chronic hypertension), but are 
delivered for fetal indications such as pr eterm labor or premature preterm rupture of the 
membranes are eligible.  
 Patients with significant hepatic impairment (Direct Bilirubin >1.5 mg/dL):  A fractionated 
bilirubin should be obtained and documented in medical record prior to enrollment . If a 
fractionated bilirubin is not available during screening prior to consent, then informed parental consent can be obtained first and a fractionated bilirubin obtained prior to 
enrollment and randomization.  
  Exposure to other systemic macrolide: Prior exposure of the infant to systemic erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, other macrolides, or clinically ordered azithromycin is an exclusion criterion. Exposure to ophthalmologic erythromycin ointment is 
not considered a systemic exposure.  
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 33 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017   Participation in other clinical trials involving investigational products . Participation in other 
clinical trials of investigative drugs is an exclusion criterion. Participation in clinical research 
studies not involving investigational product is allowed.  
 EKC QTc ≥ 450 ms . Measure EKG QTc interval (See CRF AZIP 02): 
Calculation of EKG QTc (average 3 measurements):  
0. Print strip of lead II from potential subject monitor (paste copy to page)  
1. May calculate manually or use http://en.ecgpedia.org/wiki/QTc_Calculator  
2. Measure QT interval (duration from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of 
the T wave): count the number of small squares, then multiply by 0.04 seconds(s) x 
1000: ______ms  
3. Measure RR interval (interval from the peak of one R wave to next R wave peak), count the number of small squares, then multiply by 0.04 seconds(s):_______  
4. QTc= QT(ms)/√ RR (s) 
5. Is the Qtc ≥450 ms? ______Yes _______No 
The EKG can be completed during screening or after consent is obtained, but prior to any study procedures.  
6.3 Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization 
6.3.1 Enrollment 
The enrollment date is the date and time  all screening criteria have been met and the parent 
signed the consent form. Baseline assessments, including tracheal and NP aspirates, randomization, and the first dose of study drug should be initiated within 24 h of  obtaining informed 
consent. 
6.3.2 Baseline Assessments 
 Demographics, obstetric history, maternal macrolide exposure, neonatal characteristics including respiratory support mode and supplemental oxygen at study entry  
 Morbidities of prematurity:  Morbidities associated with prematurity are protocol-specified 
potential serious adverse events. These are events that are anticipated to occur in the preterm population even in the absence of drug exposure. All morbidities present from the 
time of birth up to the start of Study day 1 (first dose study drug infusion) will be recorded.  
 Clinical laboratory tests:
 Values for electrolytes, total/direct bilirubin, CBC with differen tial 
cell count, and platelets obtained within 24 h pre-first dose will be recorded.  
 Physical examination: The site PI or other physician listed on local protocol and FDA1572 form will complete the physical assessment and complete section on CRF AZIP 07.  
 Tracheal and nasopharyneal aspirates: For subjects who are intubated at time of 
enrollment, 2 tracheal aspirates (first for cyt okine sample and second for Ureaplasma 
culture with separate suction catheters) will be obtained. The first NP sample will be 
obtained for culture at the time of first tracheal aspirate. At least 2 hours after the first 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 34 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  suction episode, a second culture sample  will be obtained from the ET tube if subject is still 
intubated and from the nose if subject is extubated. For subjects who are extubated at the 
time of enrollment, 2 NP samples will be obtained at least 2 h apart for culture only. A TA 
sample may be obtained  for the second sample if infant is intubated at time of second 
sampling. 
6.3.3 Randomization 
The enrolled subject will be randomized once all screening procedures are completed and parental 
informed consent obtained. Randomization should occur wit hin 22 h of enrollment to allow 
sufficient time for investigational pharmacy to prepare the study drug. The first dose of study drug 
should be infused no later than 24 h after enrollment.  
6.3.4  Blinding  
The study pharmacists will be unblinded, but will no t reveal treatment assignment to study staff 
administering the study drug. In the (unexpected) event of a clinically ur gent reason for unblinding 
of a subject’s assignment , the clinical site investigator or any other individual will be directed in the 
kit instructions to contact (in order of preference) Dr. Viscardi, Dr. Terrin, the UMB  Coordinating 
Pharmacy, or Axio Research to document the reasons for unblinding, assure that there is truly compelling cause to unblind, and obtain the treatment information which will be available from all 
four sources. Date and time of any unblinding as well as reasons for unblinding will be documented by the source providing the unblinding information. Because of the nature of azithromycin and the 
restriction of the patient  population to experienced NICUs, we expect that there will be few or no 
unblinding events in this study.  
6.3.5  Follow-up Visits 
A total of 3 doses of study drug will be administered at 24 ± 0.5 h intervals.  Follow -up tracheal/NP 
aspirates will be obtained 2 and 4 -5 d post last dose and on postnatal day 21.  Safety and tolerance 
will include vital signs (temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure), frequency of apnea 
(cessation of breathing for > 20 seconds), frequency of bradycardia (heart rate < 80 beats per 
minute for > 10 sec), cardiac rhythm, pulse oximetry, clinical laboratory testing and Adverse Events (AE). Safety assessment for subject vital signs, frequency of apnea and bradycardia episodes,  
pulse oximetry, and cardiac  rhythm will be collected 1 and 4 h after the initiation of azithromycin 
infusion. On study day 3 (±1 d), 7 (± 2 d), 14 (± 2 d) and every 2 wks (± 2 d) until discharge,  
transfer, or 44 weeks PMA, whichever occurs first, subjects will be assessed for morbidities 
associated with prematurity, and adverse events. Clinically relevant AEs that will be specifically 
evaluated include: local site reaction including phlebitis, gastrointestinal signs (abdominal 
distension, gastric aspirates , emesis, heme-positive stools), intestinal obstruction including 
radiographic-confirmed pyloric stenosis, culture-proven sepsis with other bacterial or nonbacterial pathogens, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and cardiac arrhythmias.
	We will also specifically 
record adverse events that may signal potential proarrhythmic effects in our study population such 
as sudden death, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and flutter, and seizures . A hearing 
screening test as part of clinical care will be performed before discharge. Electrocardiograms will 
be performed pre-dose in all subjects and post -dose if a cardiac arrhythmia is noted on the patient 
continuous monitor. Clinical laboratory testing (complete blood count with manual differential, 
electrolytes, liver function, and renal function) will be performed during the 24 hours pre - first dose, 
and study day 3 (±1 d), and 7 (± 2 d), 14 (± 3 d), and 28 (± 3 d). Blood draws for study only labs 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 35 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  will be minimized by utilizing lab values from clinically in dicated lab draws within the sampling 
periods. Relevant systemic medications received by subjects during the 7 days post -first dose 
administration will be recorded.

 36 weeks postmenstrual age/pre-transfer: 
 BPD assessment: For neonates at 36 ± 1 week or pre-discharge who are on positive pressure support or receiving > 30% supplemental oxygen with oxygen saturations 
between 90% and 96%, the diagnosis of BPD will be assigned with no  further testing. 
For neonates at 36 ± 1 week or pre-discharge who are receiving oxygen < 30% with oxygen saturations between 90% and 96% or receiving oxygen ≥ 30% with oxygen 
saturations >96% will undergo a timed step -wise reduction by 2% increments every 5 
minutes to room air and a period of observation in room air for 30 minutes as described by Walsh et al 
111. For infants receiving supplemental oxygen by nasal 
cannula, the delivered oxygen concentration or “effective FiO 2” 111 will be calculated 
by the technique described by Benaron et al. 112 that was used in the STOP-ROP trial 
113 which is based on weight, oxygen liter f low, and oxygen concentration. Failure of 
the room air challenge will be defined as oxygen saturations 80 -89% for 5 
consecutive min or <80% for 15 s. No BPD will be defined as treatment with room air with oxygen saturation ≥90% or passing the timed, oxygen -reduction test. Infants will 
be continuously monitored and observed throughout the reduction test. Study subjects who are transferred or discharged at ≤ 35 wk on supplemental oxygen will 
be considered to have BPD.  
 Pre-discharge/transfer 
 Hearing assessment : A hearing screening test as part of clinical care will be 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 38 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  performed before discharge.  Test results will be recorded as passed, refer one ear, 
or refer both ears. If a brainstem auditory response test is requested for clinical care, 
the results will be recorded as passed or failed.  
 Cumulative days of respiratory support:  The total number of days of mechanical 
ventilation, nCPAP, and supplemental oxygen will be recorded.  
 Adverse events: Subjects will be assessed for morbidities associated with prematurity, and adverse events.  
 Pulmonary Follow-up 
 Respiratory questionnaires : Data will be collected by structured parental interviews 
before discharge and follow-up phone interview at 6, 12 and 22 -26 months adjusted 
age. With permission, we will utilize the validat ed Tucson Children’s Respiratory 
Study questionnaires that were designed to elicit a complete history of possible 
covariates such as family history of asthma or atopy, and important environmental 
(e.g., smoking) and infectious exposures and detailed interv al respiratory health 
history. Recurrent wheezing and chronic cough will be defined as occurring more than twice per week.  
 The ideal times of visits and points of reference for data collection on long term pulmonary outcomes are six months, one year and two years adjusted age. To assure that patient contact information can be used regardless of dates of actual 
contact with the babies and their families, we have established contiguous windows 
for the three follow-up visits. The first of these follow-up visit windows extends from 
five months to nine months adjusted age with an ideal visit date at six months 
adjusted age; the second window from 10 months to 18 months with  an ideal visit 
date at 12 months; and the third from 19 months to 30 months with the ideal  date at 
24 months. Whenever within a data collection window the baby and family are 
contacted, the information collected about the baby's pulmonary health on that day 
may be used in the data collection window. If a baby and family is  contacted more 
than o nce within a data collection window, the data closest to the ideal date are the 
data to be used. For example if a baby and family are contacted at 10 months and at 
13 months, the data on the baby's pulmonary health collected at the 13 -month visit 
are to be used for the 12-month visit. If data were not collected within a specified window but the baby and family are contacted in a subsequent window, the data 
collected that day should be processed for the current window, and inquiry made as 
to the baby's pulmonary health at the ideal time of the window in which data were not 
previously collected. If the baby's family can supply answers in response to the 
inquiry, those data should be entered for baby's pulmonary questionnaire CRF at the 
time of the ideal visit date for which information had been missing previously. For 
example, if the first follow-up contact for a baby is completed at 11 months adjusted 
age, the pulmonary health information collected about that day may be used for the 
12-month visit, and answers to questions about the baby's pulmonary health at six 
months adjusted age may be used  for late completion of the six-month visit 
information.

    30 Jan 2017  6.3.6 Completion/Final Evaluation 
 22-26 months adjusted age 
 Neurologic examination: A developmental specialist or neurologist blinded to 
treatment assignment will complete a comprehensive neurologic examination  114 that 
includes a standardized assessment of reflexes, muscle tone a nd strength. The 
neurologic assessment will be classified as normal or abnormal a nd whether the child 
has cerebral palsy (CP) and CP severity as defined in the MOP . 
 Gross Motor Function Classification Score (GMFCS):  The degree of motor 
impairment will be assessed using the 5 level GMFCS 115. 
 Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Developm ent, 3rd edition (BSIDIII): A certified 
psychologist blinded to treatment assignment will complete the BSIDIII  116. 
 Ages and Stages Questionnaire, Third Edition (ASQ3): Developmental milestones in 
five domains (communication, fine motor, gross motor, problem -solving ability, and 
personal-social functioning) will be assessed usin g a parent questionnaire 
administered by phone by study coordinators when a child is unable to return for in person assessments. This tool has high sensitivity and negative predictive value 
compared to the BSID-III at 24 months in preterm infants <32 weeks gestation 
1. The 
window for this assessment is from 19 months to 30 months with the ideal date at 24 months . 
 Pulmonary questionnaire: Data will be collected by structured parental interviews  
during the clinic visit . With permission, we will utilize the validated Tucson Children’s 
Respiratory Study questionnaires that were designed to elicit a complete history of 
possible covariates such as family history of asthma or atopy, and important environmental (e.g., smoking) and infectious exposures and detailed interval 
respiratory health history. Recurrent wheezing and chronic cough will be defined as 
occurring more than twice per week.  
 Review medical records : Medical records will be reviewed and parents interviewed to 
assess vision and hearing. Records from subspecialty ophthalmology and audiology 
services will be reviewed to determine whether the child is receiving services for 
vision or hearing impairment and results of vision and audiological examinations.  
 Neurodevelopmental impairment  will be assigned for any of the following: moderate 
to severe CP, bilateral blindness, bilateral hearing impairment requiring ampli fication, 
GMFCS ≥ 2, BSIDIII cognitive or motor score <70, or ASQ ≤2SD on any domain. 
 Early Termination: Subject will be classified as early termination if subject was terminated 
from study prior to 36 weeks PMA or discharge/transfer whichever comes first . A subject 
may be terminated for following reasons: patient enrolled, but not dosed; death; parent or 
LAR withdrawal of consent; investigator decision; or study chairman deci sion. Partial 
termination may occur when a parent requests no further study procedures, but can be 
followed for safety.

The safety and tolerability of oral azithromycin has been evaluated in 3995 patients aged 2 to 94 
91. The overall rate of side effects is 12% with gastrointestinal symptoms the most common. 
Ototoxicity, although rare, has been reported with IV azithromycin in adults and included reversible 
tinnitus  and hearing loss 92. A review of 43 open label, randomized pediatric trials performed 
outside the US that included 2655 patients treated with a 3 day course (10 mg/kg once daily) oral azithromycin for upper respiratory tract infections reported adverse effects in 8.7% subjects, 
primarily gastrointestinal symptoms 
93. In a recent pharmacokinetics study of a single dose of IV 
azithromycin in 32 children ages 6 months to 16 years, there were no serious adverse events. Nausea was the most common treatment related symptom, reported in 25% patients. Although 
treatment with erythromycin in the first few months of life has been associated occasionally with 
the development of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) 
94, recent retrospective studies of 
a large cohort suggest that there is an increased risk of IHPS in infants >32 weeks gestation exposed to oral azithromycin or erythromycin 
95,96. There was not an increases risk in preterm 
infants ≤32 weeks gestation.  
The macrolides are associated with prolongation of the Q -T interval that can lead to serious 
ventricular arrhythmias.  Recently, a retrospective study of a large Tennessee Medicaid cohort 
detected a small absolute increased risk of cardiovascular death (hazard ratio, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.79 -
4.63) in adults who took a five day course of azithromycin compared to individuals who took no antibiotics 
98. There were 47 additional cardiovascular deaths per 1 million azithromycin courses. 
The increased risk for cardiovascular death was highest among patients with a high baseline risk for cardiovascular disease.  
The implications of that study for azithromycin use in newborns and children are unclear. There is a single case report in the literature of cardiac arrest with s uspected prolonged QT in a 9 month old 
who inadvertently received 50 mg/kg azithromycin intravenously over 20 minutes 
99. Prolonged QT 
interval is rare among newborns with an incidence of the heritable long QT syndro mes estimated 
between 1 per 3000 and 1 per 5000 births 100. Based on a retrospective study of prolonged QT 
interval in neonates, Villain and co -workers 101 suggest that infants presenting with a QTc<0.5 
second normalize their QTc over time while infants with a QTc>0.6 second are at risk for severe arrhythmias and sudden cardiovascular death. Prolonged QTc was not detected in any of the 171 
preterm infants we screened for the 10 mg/kg and 20mg/kg single dose studies. However, we will continue careful screening of potential subjects for prolonged QT interval in the current protocol  of 
multi-dose azithromycin. In consideration for safety, we will delay or discontinue study dosing if a ny 
subject has evidence of an arrhythmia on the cardiac monitor (they will all have continuous 
cardiopulmonary monitoring) or an ongoing proarrhythmic condition such as hypokalemia (serum 
potassium < 3.5 mEq/L), hyperkalemia (serum potassium >6.5 mEq/L on non-hemolyzed 
specimen), hypomagnesemia (total serum Magnesium ≤ 1.6 mg/dL), hypocalcemia (ionized 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 41 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  calcium < 3.0 mg/dL) or hypothermia (core temperature ≤ 35°C) until corrected by the clinical care 
team. We will also specifically record adverse events that  may signal potential proarrhythmic 
effects in our study population such as sudden death, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and flutter, and seizures.  
There are no known interactions of azithromycin with other drugs. The potential for these adverse outcomes will be carefully evaluated in the Phase IIb trial of azithromycin in preterm infants.  
Adverse events will be recorded on case report forms with spec ific focus on potential events with 
reported (expected) relationship to the drug (e.g. gastrointestinal symptoms, local IV site reactions, 
cardiac arrhythmias). Hearing loss will be assessed by a pre-discharge hearing screen. Clinical 
laboratory tests will be monitored throughout the first 28 d of the study.  On study day 3 (±1 d), 7 (± 
2 d), 14 (± 2 d) and every 2 wks (± 2 d) until discharge or transfer, subjects will be assessed for morbidities associated with prematurity, and adverse events.  Clinical laboratory testing (complete 
blood count with manual differential, electrolytes, liver function, and renal function) will be performed during the 24 hours pre- first dose, and study day 3 (±1 d), and 7 (± 2 d), 14 (± 3 d), and 28 (± 3 d).  
Cranial ultrasound and retinopathy of prematurity reports of all subjects will be reviewed for 
completeness and accuracy at the time of site visits  or will be provided to the data coordinating 
center upon request. Independent review of CUS images will be requested if differences are noted 
in these outcomes by site or treatment assignment.

a. Adverse event : Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation in which a subject is given a pharmaceutical product; does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with such treatment, or  
b. Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal la boratory findings), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product; not necessarily related to the product.  
c. Change-from-baseline AEs can take 2 forms:  
i. Appearance of a new symptom or sign, or  
ii. Increased severity or frequency of an existing symptom or sign 
d. Severity assessment: Severity refers to the intensity of the event and is generally 
indicated as mild (Grade I), moderate (Grade II), severe (Grade III), or life-threatening 
(Grade IV). See appendices E and F, Neonatal Toxicity Tables for severity grading of 
common events and laboratory abnormalities. For events not listed, grading definitions are:  
i. Mild (Grade I): mild transient symptoms, only requiring monitoring or symptomatic treatment, and clinically significant 
ii. Moderate (Grade II): Moderate illness or condition which requires new or significantly altered specific therapy 
iii. Severe (Grade III): Severe illness or condition: unresponsive to medical therapy. 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 42 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  iv. Life-threatening: Life -threatening illness or conditio n. Complicated by acute, 
life-threatening metabolic or cardiovascular complications (such as circulatory 
failure, hemorrhage, sepsis); life-threatening physiological consequences; or 
need for intensive care or emergent invasive procedure (e.g. requires maj or 
surgery). 
e. Causality  refers to the likelihood and extent that the investigational agent being 
studied contributed to the development of an AE.  In making determination, consider 
temporal relationship to drug exposure, other possible exposures as etiology,  known 
effects of the investigational agent, anticipated ( expected) side effects derived from 
preclinical studies, and what is known about similar drugs (See drug insert).

    30 Jan 2017  f. Duration of event: Onset of signs and symptoms as well as resolution of the event 
should be recorded, typically defined as the point when all signs and symptoms have 
subsided Some events continue or change in severity over time. Capturing this  
information is also important. Changes in severity such as when an event improves from severe to mild should be recorded as separate events, with separate intensities 
and durations collected.  
g. Adverse reaction: Defined as an adverse event caused by a drug.  Therefore, 
adverse reactions are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions for which there are 
reasons to conclude that the drug caused the event.  
h. Suspected adverse reaction (21 CFR 312.32(a)): Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for whic h there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
adverse event. A suspected adverse reac tion implies a lesser degree of certainty 
about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
i. Unexpected (21 CFR 312.32(a)): An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in  the investigator brochure (or drug insert) 
or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or 
elsewhere in the protocol. “Unexpected” als o refers to adverse events or suspected 
adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacologic properties of the drug, but 
are not specifically mentioned as occurring wi th the particular drug under 
investigation (e.g. adverse events associated with other macrolides, but not specifically azithromycin such as pyloric stenosis). In addition, adverse events that 
would be anticipated to occur as part of the disease process are  considered 
‘unexpected’ for the purposes of reporting because they would not be listed in the investigator brochure.  
j. Serious (21 CFR 312.32(a)): An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘serious’ if, in the view of either the investiga tor or sponsor, it results in 
any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization, or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant 
incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or import ant medical event that may, 
based on appropriate medical judgment, jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in 
the definition.  
k. Life-threatening (21 CFR 312.32(a)): An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘life-threatening if, in the view of the investigator or sponsor, its 
occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death . 
l. Morbidities Associated with Prematurity  
The population to be studied in this protocol is at high risk for morbidities associated with 
prematurity. Events listed below will, for the purposes of this clinical trial, be considered events 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 44 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  commonly associated with prematurity. The following morbidities associated with prematurity w ill 
be entered on the morbidities CRF.  
 Air leak syndrome (e.g. pulmonary interstitial emphysema, pneumothorax, 
pneumomediastimum)  
 Anemia of prematurity 
 Apnea of prematurity 
 Bradycardia 
 Cystic periventricular leukomalacia (confirmed by cranial ultrasound)  
 Feeding intolerance (e.g. gastric residuals, abdominal distension)  
 Gastroesophageal reflux 
 Gastrointestinal perforation (confirmed by radiology and surgical pathology to not be associated with necrotizing enterocolitis ) 
 Hyperbilirubinemia 
 Necrotizing enterocolitis (confirmed by radiology)  
 Patent ductus arteriosis (confirmed by echocardiography)  
 Periventricular or intraventricular hemorrhage (confirmed by cranial ultrasound)

a. Reporting Procedures for all Adverse Events 
i. For adverse events that are level I or level II severity,  a separate CRF AE form will be 
submitted for each occurrence. All AEs that occur after the initial study drug administration until discharge or transfer will be reported. All submitted AEs will be 
tabulated and submitted to DSMB, FDA annual report, and to  each investigator for 
inclusion in annual reports to local IRBs.  
ii. A separate SAE form will be completed for each serious adverse event 
reported/observed until discharge or transfer. Each site investigator must report immediately (within 5 business days) to the sponsor (Viscardi) all serious adverse 
events, regardless of whether the investigator believes that they are drug related, 
including those events listed in the protocol as anticipated to occur in the preterm 
population independent of drug exposure (e.g. morbidities of prematurity), or in the drug 
insert as predicted to occur with the drug.  
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 45 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  iii.  Dr. Alex Agthe, study medical monitor will review event information and determine if 
event qualifies as SAE, severity, and relationship to drug. He may con tact site research 
team for additional information to make this determination. He will be responsible for 
preparing FDA safety reports and notifying Dr. Viscardi, the study chairman and IND 
investigator-sponsor. Dr. Viscardi will be responsible for submitt ing the safety reports to 
the FDA within the time requirements, the UMB IRB, and to site investigators for submission to local IRBs.  Dr. Viscardi will forward all initial and follow -up SAE reports to 
the DSMB chair Dr. Jonathan Davis with each occurrence. The DSMB chair may request 
treatment assignment from the Data Coordinating Center  at the time of the initial report 
or will review treatment assignment in the monthly s afety reports of cumulative SAEs. 
Reports of deaths will be submitted to the DSMB chair with each occurrence.  
iv. FDA IND Safety Reports: 
a. Sponsor (Rose Viscardi, M.D.) must submit reports to FDA for those instances 
where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug 
and the adverse event  (i.e. adverse reaction of suspect ed adverse reaction). 
b. Reports may be submitted after  
1. a single occurrence because the event is uncommon, but is known to 
be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g. anaphylaxis, Stevens -
Johnson Syndrome) 
2. one or more occurrences: a single occurrence or a small number of 
occurrences of a SAE that is uncommon in the study population, but not 
commonly associated with drug exposure and event(s) occur in 
association with other factors strongly suggesting causation (e.g. strong 
temporal association).  
3. Aggregate analysis of specific events. Morbidities of prematurity are 
examples of protocol-specified serious adverse events. If the frequency 
of a specific SAE occurs in statistically greater frequency in the treatment then placebo arm and the events occur in association with 
other factors strongly suggesting causation (e.g. strong temporal association), a safety report will be submitted.  
c. Serious adverse event reports for any cases of NEC meeting criteria for seriousness (e.g., deaths, infants requiring intestinal r esection) will be reported 
to the FDA regardless of relationship to study drug as an IND safety report  no 
later than 15 days after the sponsor is informed of a NEC case that qualifies 
as serious. Fatal or life-threatening cases of NEC will be reported no later than 
7 days after the sponsor is notified. With these NEC SAE reports, the investigational site where the event occurred and the number of trial 
participants enrolled in the trial will be identified. If  available, the number of 
trial participants enrolled at the site where the SAE occurred will be provided.  
d. An expedited IND safety report will be submitted when any of the following 
criteria are met for serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction: 
1. Suspected adverse reaction (reasonable possibilit y that the drug 
caused the adverse event)  
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 46 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  2. Serious 
3. Unexpected 
e. Any unexpected and related fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse 
reactions must be reported to the FDA by telephone or FAX within seven (7) 
calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt  of the information. The FDA 
Medwatch 3500A mandatory form will be completed and submitted (www.fda.gov/medwatch). 
f. A written report will be submitted to FDA within 15 calendar days for any serious unexpected adverse event considered related to study drug including 
those that have already been reported under the 7 -day rule.

An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB) has been appointed and report s to the 
PI. Members include a neonatologist, a biostatistician or a  clinical trials epidemiologist, and 
infectious disease specialist. The DSMB will: 1) review and analyze the progress of the study, 2) 
approve amendments to the trial protocol, if warranted, 3) monitor the safety of the study 
treatments, 4) review data quality, 5) review interim analyses and recommend early stopping or 
continuation of the trial.  
Monitoring for serious or unexpected adverse events (SAEs) will be performed throughout the hospitalization period or until 44 weeks PMA whichever comes first . The site investigator will 
submit completed SAE CRFs to Data Coordinating C enter , the PI, and Dr. Alex Agthe, who will be 
the study medical monitor. Dr. Agthe will review event information and determine if event qualifies 
as SAE, severity, and relationship to drug. He may contact site research team for additional 
information to make this determination. He will be responsible for preparing FDA safety reports and 
notifying Dr. Viscardi, the IND investigator -sponsor. Dr. Viscardi will be responsible for submi tting 
the safety reports to the FDA within the time requirements. The Data Coordinating C enter will 
prepare summaries of these cases that will be submitted t o the DSMB. SAEs that are study-related 
or are cause for urgent concern will be reported to the DSMB, the site IRBs, and FDA immediately after recognition of their importance. The DSMB may review patient safety based on an individual 
report or accumulating evidence. Cumulative reports of all AEs and SAEs will be provided at each 
DSMB meeting. The DSMB will meet before subject recruitment begins and will subsequently meet 
every 6 months in person or by teleconference  to review the study progress and AE and SAE 
reports.

Subjects may be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons: 1) at the request of the 
subject’s parent(s) or guardian(s), or at the request of other legally authorized representative; 2) if, 
in the investigator’s opinion, continuation in the study would be detrimental to the subject’s well 
being; or 3) at the specific request of the Sponsor, the National Institute of Child Health and 
Human Development (NICHD). Although the decision to remove subjects from the study is the sole 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 47 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  responsibility of investigator, he/she is urged to discuss situations with Dr . Viscardi prior to 
removing participants from the study. If study drug is discontinued, subjects will continue to be 
followed for safety assessments. All randomized subjects will be included in the intent -to-treat 
analyses to the fullest extent possible. A 5% missing information rate (including early termination of 
study drug or consent withdrawal) is anticipated. In all cases, the reason for withdrawal will be 
recorded in the case report form (CRF) and in the subject’s medical records.  If the reason for 
withdrawal was an adverse event (AE), the subject will be followed up and the AE must be reported in accordance with the procedures in Section 7.4.

To determine the microbiologic efficacy of IV azit hromycin 20 mg/kg x 3 days to eradicate 
Ureaplasma from the preterm lung, we will conduct a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, 
placebo-controlled clinical trial. This endpoint is important to plan for a Phase III clinical trial to determine if ureaplasmal eradication improves short -term (BPD) and long-term pulmonary 
outcomes. 
We hypothesize that compared to placebo azithromycin 20 mg/kg x 3 days will improve survival 
without persistence of Ureaplasma in preterm infants with Ureaplasma respiratory colonization. 
Primary Efficacy Variable: Survival without persistence of Ureaplasma respiratory tract 
colonization: To determine the efficacy of the IV azithromycin to eradicate Ureaplasma respiratory 
tract colonization, all randomized infants will have follow-up cultures of TAs if still intubated or NP 
aspirates if extubated at sampling times (2 and 5 days post third dose and 21 d of age). These 
samples will be frozen and shipped to UAB for analysis by culture and PCR. The MIC of 
azithromycin will be deter mined for each isolate. This will assess if Ureaplasma isolates develop 
azithromycin resistance over time or resistance varies among centers. Since Ureaplasma is only 
transmitted vertically, neonates who are positive by culture or PCR at any time point wil l be 
considered a colonized neonate. Although PCR may be more sensitive for detection of all Ureaplasma positive neonates, it does not distinguish between live and killed organisms . 
Therefore, we will define bac terial clearance as 3 negative cultures. The primary outcome will be 
survival with microbiological eradication of Ureaplasma defined as survival to discharge or transfer 
with 3 negative cultures obtained post -therapy.  
Secondary Efficacy Variables : 
Physiologic Test for BPD: Secondary outcomes will include the rate of physiologic defined BPD at 
36 wks PMA in placebo controls (Ureaplasma colonized, and non-colonized) and azithromycin responders (Ureaplasma eradicated) vs non-responders (persistent Ureaplasma). For the BPD 
endpoint, the recently reported physiologic definition of BPD based on oxygen -saturation 
monitoring will be used 
111. 
Additional secondary endpoints will include overall mortality, incidence of co -morbidities of 
prematurity such as intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalaci a, necrotizing 
enterocolitis, bacterial and fungal nosocomial infection, pulmonary air leak, patent ductus 
arteriosus, retinopathy of prematurity, number of days of positive pressure ventilation, number of 
days of oxygen supplementation, use of postnatal s teroids, and use of non-study antibiotics. The 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 48 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  treatment groups will be compared for the frequency of event outcomes and medians (treating 
deaths as bad outcomes) for durations.

1 Power if there was perfect correlation between twins  
2 Power if there was no correlation between twins.  
 Sample Size Considerations : We chose our sample size (30 Ureaplasma-colonized subjects  per 
group) in order to have good power to detect an eff ect of treatment on Ureaplasma respiratory tract 
eradication. To calculate the power we will have, we simulated thousands of data sets under 
various assumptions about the rates of survival without persistence of Ureaplasma in the control 
and intervention groups. For each simulated data set, we calculated a Mantel -Haenszel Chi 
Square, and determined the proportion of data sets for which the p-value was less than .05.  These 
simulations were based on the assumption that 20% of  the infants were in twin pairs. Since twins 
will be randomized to the same treatment group, and assuming the outcomes in twins are positively correlated, the power of the study regarding the treatment effect is less than what it 
would be had all the infants in the stud y been singletons (independent). To assess the range of 
power, the power was calculated for the two extremes of perfect correlation between twins and no correlation between twins .  The actual correlation is likely to be between 0 and 1, so the actual 
power should be somewhere in between the limits as shown in Table 6. These power calculations also assume that 5% of the children will withdraw from the study before the endpoint is assessed.  
The actual power of  our study will be somewhat higher than in these simulations because  the 
actual analysis will glean information from both members of each twin pair using multiple outputation.   
Power calculations were performed assuming an 80% survival rate,  a 54% Ureaplasma 
colonization rate and a 25% rate of clearance among the placebo group to determine a  sample 
size as shown in Table 6. Assuming that survival and Ureaplasma clearance are independent 
outcomes and 25% of the infected children will spontaneously clear the infection, then the 
expected rate of survival without microbiological persistence of Ureaplasma in the absence of 
antibiotic therapy is 0.2 (0.8 x 0.25). In Table 6, we provide the power we will have to detect 
differences in survival without microbiological persistence of Ureaplasma between azithromycin 
and placebo groups wit h a sample of 60 Ureaplasma-colonized infants under various assumptions, 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 49 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  using a two-sided, .05-level test. Thus we will have good power to detect effects that are typical of 
appropriately chosen antibioti cs.   
99..33    DDeeffiinniittiioonn  ooff  PPooppuullaattiioonnss  
The primary analyses will be performed to test the hypothesis of no difference in survival and 
Ureaplasma eradication between subjects randomly assigned to placebo versus IV azithromycin. 
All primary analyses will be carried out according to the principle of intention -to treat. If the null 
hypothesis is not rejected, 95% confidence intervals will be construct ed about the differences 
observed to demonstrate how large the differences could be in either direction.

Since the sample of Ureaplasma colonization is small (~30 in each arm), no interim analysis for 
efficacy is planned.  
There will be no pre-specified stopping rules, but rather the DSMB will review SAEs as they occur. The DSMB chair may call a DSMB meeting to specifically review safety concerns. The DSMB 
recommendations may include study termination, study continuation with protocol modifications (e.g., change in eligibility criteria), or temporary suspension of enrollment until further evaluation is 
completed. The DSMB will review each death occurrence. Cumulative  SAEs for each study arm 
will be provided to the DSMB to determine whether there are statistical as well as clinical concerns. These findings  may be reviewed by the DSMB in a closed session and the findings will be used to 
determine what steps will be taken.

9.5.1 Primary Outcome   
The primary outcome will be survival to discharge and eradication of Ureaplasma respiratory tract

9.5.2 Secondary Outcomes  
Secondary outcomes will include the rate of physiologic defined BPD at 36 wks  PMA in placebo

reported physiologic definition of BPD based on oxygen -saturation monitoring will be used 111. 
Additional secondary endpoints will include overall mortality, incidence of co -morbidities of 
prematurity such as intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis, bacterial and fungal nosocomial infection, pulmonary air leak, pat ent ductus 
arteriosus, retinopathy of prematurity, number of days of positive pressure ventilation, number of days of oxygen supplementation, use of postnatal steroids, and use of non -study antibiotics. The 
treatment groups will be compared for the frequen cy of event outcomes and medians (treating 
deaths as bad outcomes) for durations.

Analysis of Primary Outcome:  The primary outcome will be survival to discharge and eradication of 
Ureaplasma respiratory tract colonization. The null hypothesis will be tested using the Mantel -
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 50 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  Haenszel chi-square test, taking into account different clinical sites. The test for differences in the 
primary outcome between the treatment groups will be conducted at a n overall 2-tailed alpha -level 
of 0.05. Enrolled patients who have died will be counted as having adverse outcomes (i.e., as 
treatment failures) in the primary analysis. Death must be taken into account as an adverse 
outcome to avoid the possibility declar ing an advantage for a treatment that is associated with 
improved Ureaplasma clearance but also with greater mortality. In addition to calculating a p -value, 
we will use a Mantel-Haenszel Odds Ratio to estimate the size of the effect of treatment and 
calculate its variance (and corresponding confidence interval) based on the method of Robins et al. 
117. 
Although an issue not addressed in many neonatal clinical trials  118, one complication to the 
analysis is the fact that some of the children will be in twin sets.  This violates the assumption of 
independence required by the Mantel -Haenszel approach.  To handle this complication, we will use 
the approach of “Multiple Outputation” 119. This approach was previously used to address this 
complication in the NO CLD study 24. This approach involves the random selection of one child 
from each twin pair. Then the analysis is performed only using the randomly selected single child 
from each set of twins. These steps (random selection and subsequent analysis) are repeated 
1000 times. The final estimate is the average of the estimates found in the multiple analyses. The 
variance of the multiple estimates can be used to appropriately adjust the variance of the fina l 
estimate to take into consideration the fact that each of the multiple analyses were only based on a 
subset of the data.  
Prior to performing the primary outcome analysis, the Breslow -Day test for homogeneity of odds 
ratios will be used to assess if there is significant (at alpha = 0.05) evidence of differences in the 
effect of treatment according to stratum or clinical site. The proposed approach to interactions will 
maintain the overall alpha level for the primary outcome analysis at 0.05. If a clinical site interaction 
that is not consistent with an assumption of homogeneity of treatment effect is detected, the clinical 
site's performance and results will be reviewed to determine the nature of the differences in treatment effects. Significant differences in stratum or clinical site treatment effects will be reported.  
Secondary Analyses Including Subgroup Analyses : A similar approach (Mantel-Haenszel tests and 
estimation using multiple outputation) will be used to estimate the effect of the treatment on BPD 
rates. The BPD analysis will be done using all children (with and without Ureaplasma), and then 
separately in strata defined by the presence of Ureaplasma. In the unlikely event that there are 
important imbalances between the randomly assigned treatmen ts in clinical or laboratory variables 
recorded (e.g., selected co-morbid states, concomitant medications), secondary analyses will be 
conducted using logistic regression to estimate treatment effects controlling for confounding 
factors. Model assumptions will be examined, and models will be tested for goodness of fit. If the 
assumptions required for a logistic regression model are rejected, alternate models will be explored. Again, the approach of multiple outputation will be used to obtain the final estim ates and 
their variance. 
Additional secondary analyses will assess the treatment effect on other outcome variables. 
Secondary outcomes to be considered include death which will be approached with survival 
analysis (time to event) methods; co-morbid outcomes which will be approached with logistic 
regression; number of days of treatment with positive pressure ventilation and number of days of 
oxygen supplementation which will be approached with rank or normal scores statistics to be able 
to assess outcomes with and without taking deaths into account.  
Pulmonary and Neurodevelopmental Outcomes Analysis : Given the duration of  follow -up required 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 51 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  for these aims, drop-out needs to be considered.  So, initially, we will identify predictors of drop 
out, and compare the study groups with respect to drop-out rates.  If there is moderate difference 
between the groups with respect to drop-out rates, then variables associated wit h drop-out will be 
controlled for in subsequent analyses.  
The primary approach to analysis will be to compare the treatment groups with respect to the distribution of 6-month, 12 month , and 22-26 month pulmonary outcomes (number and duration of 
hospitalizations, number of physician and emergency visits for respiratory illness, frequency of 
pulmonary medication use, and parental report of recurrent wheezing or chronic cough).  Initially, 
these comparisons will be performed informally using side -by-side box plots and simple tables.  
More formal statistical analyses will be performed using the methods described for  the primary 
outcome.  Specifically, for binary outcomes (e.g., “ever hospitalized”), we will use Mantel-Haenszel 
methods, stratifying by center.  If we need to control for confounding variables, we will analyze binary outcomes using logistic regression models including terms for center.  For quantitative 
outcomes we will use multiple regression mo dels including terms for center and potential 
confounders.  To assess whether observed associations with treatment group are mediated by clearance of Ureaplasma infection, we will also fit models including a term for persistent infection. 
Final inferential statistics will be based on analyses using multiple outputation methods described 
above to account for correlation within twins.  A similar approach for neurodevelopmental 
impairment at 22-26 months will be used to compare the difference for binary outcome  survival 
free of neurodevelopmental impairment.

mg/kg (N=12), b) single 20 mg/kg (N=13) and c) multiple 20 mg/kg (N=30) will be compiled and analyzed using the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling software, NONMEM. The first-order 
conditional estimation procedure (FOCE) will be used for the analysis. Open one -, two -, and three- 
compartment structural disposition models with first order elimination, as implemented in the  
PREDPP library of models provided in the NONMEM software, will be evaluated to fit the data. 
Previously, a two-compartment structural model with the clearance and volume of peripheral 
compartment (V2) allometrically scaled on body weight (WT) best describ ed the pharmacokinetics 
of i.v. azithromycin in preterm neonates. This model will be first used for the compiled PK d ata 
analysis. The selection of the final base model will be determined by the Akaike information criteria 
(AIC) and visual inspection of the goodness of fit scatter plots. The additive, proportional and 
exponential pharmaco-statistical models as well as a combination of the additive and proportional 
models will be evaluated to characterize the inter -individual variability and the residual ran dom 
variability. During the covariate model -building process, the stepwise forward inclusion procedure 
will be applied to  build the full model. The likelihood ratio test will be applied to discriminate the 
alternative nested models using the model selectio n criteria with a significance level of 0.05. 
Stepwise backward procedure will be applied to breakdown the full model to the final model with a 
stringent statistical criterion (p<0.01). The improvement in the diagnostic scatter plots (population 
predicted versus observed concentrations, individual predicted versus observed concentrations, 
weighted residuals versus time, weighted residuals ver sus population predicted concen trations and 
ETA plots) as well as the decrease in the inter -individual and residual variances will be used to 
evaluate the goodness of fit throughout the model building process. Potential covariates include 
birth weight, gestational age, gender, race, current weight, length, body surface area, postnatal 
age and post -menstrual age (gestational age plus postnatal age). Consolidating data from 55 
neonates [n=12 (single 10 mg/kg), n=1 3 (single 20 mg/kg) and n=30 (extending N for  multiple 20 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 52 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  mg/kg)] will allow better examination of the influence of these covariates on the PK of azithromycin. 
Any potential drug/drug interactions caused by concomitant medications administered to mother in 
the 7 days prior to delivery (e.g., antenatal steroids, antibiotics, tocolytics) and to the subject from 
birth until 7 days (within the drug sampling period) post -azithromycin dosing (e.g., caffeine, 
diuretics, indomethacin, postnatal steroids) will also be examined. The final proposed PK model will be internally evaluated using posterior predictive check and simulating the data from which it 
was built. After the final model is developed, Bayesian estimates of the individual patients’ PK 
parameters will be calculated, including plasma clearance, volume of distribution, maximum 
plasma concentration (C 
max), time of C max (Tmax), area under the plasma concentration –time curve 
from zero to infinity (AUC 0-∞), the distribution rate constant, and elimination rate constant.  
Pharmacodynamics evaluation : Microbiological outcome will be classified as eradication or 
persistence of Ureaplasma respiratory tract colonization. Eradication will be defined as all negative follow -up cultures and failure defined as the presence of one or more follow -up positive respiratory 
culture for Ureaplasma. Pharmacodynamic parameters of AUC
24/MIC 90, Cmax/MIC, and %T>MIC 
will be determined for Ureapalsma culture positive subjects. Classification and regression tree 
(CART) analysis will be applied to determine breakpoints of PD indexes, e.g. AUC/MIC, and their statistical significances will be validated by Fisher’ s exact test. Logistic regression analysis will be 
performed to determine the probability of clinical success or bacterial eradication based on the 
significant predictors, such as AUC/MIC, and T%>MIC, etc.  
10. DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
10.1 Data Collection Forms  
Data Capture: Data capture includes all procedures required to incorporate study data into a 
central database. Data capture and management of high quality data are key responsibilities of Dr. 
Tracy and the Data Management Core. The gene ral principles that will be followed are: 1) 
continuous time windows to indicate ideal and permissible dates for follow -up visits; 2) permissible 
minimal and maximal time limits between specified data collection visits; 3) identical follow -up 
schedule for all treatment groups for measurement of variables used to assess outcome to avoid bias inherent in a schedule involving more frequent contact with one treatment group relative to the 
other; 4) tested data collection forms; 5) document contacts of participa nts, record reasons for 
missed visits via use of a missed visit form; 6) trained and certified data collectors; and 7) appropriate audit trails for all changes to data forms. The study coordinators at each site who are 
blinded to study treatment assignment , will be responsible for completing the case report forms. All 
data recorded by hand will be collected with paper case report forms designed and processed by a 
software application called Teleform (Cardiff, San Marcos, CA) that utilizes optical character 
recognition (OCR) and mark-sensitive technologies that allow data to be captured via electronic 
scanning rather than direct -keyed data entry. Teleform offers functions such as database 
validations, user-defined dictionary look ups, numeric range tests, dat a, currency and character-
specific formatting, as well as “Always review” and “Entry required” field designations. Once data 
are processed through the Teleform suite of programs, they are committed directly to the secure 
project database.  
Confidentiality  
Subject confidentiality will be maintained in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. Only the subject number and letter code will be recorded in the 
CRF. Study findings stored on a computer will be stored i n accordance with local data protection 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 53 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  laws. Patient data shall be stored with a unique numeric identifier to insure confidentiality. Names 
and addresses corresponding to each identification number will be kept in a secure file. Access to all computer files will be restricted to designated personnel through the use of passwords.  
Direct Access to Source Data/Documents 
The subjects’ parents/guardians will be told that representatives of the NICHD, IRB, or FDA may 
inspect their child’s medical records to veri fy the information collected, and that all personal 
information made available for inspection will be handled in strictest confidence and in accordance 
with local data protection laws.  
1100..22  DDaattaa  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt    
Clinical site data collection 
Clinical sites will be responsible for accuracy and completeness of CRFs and submission of 
completed forms to the Clinical and Translational Research Informatics Center  within pre-specified 
windows. They will also be responsible for maintaining source documents and retention  of original 
CRFs securely at their site. They will respond to edit checks and submit corrections on CRF 
modification/update/deletion form. Sample case report forms are provided in Appendix F. 
Case Report Forms as Source Documents  
Study personnel trained in the proper completion of case report forms (CRFs) will record study data on the CRFs and all forms will be signed and dated by the study personnel who completed 
the form. In some instances data for which there is no prior written or electronic record wil l be 
recorded on CRFs and these will be considered source documents . This will be limited to the 
following CRFs: 
1. AZIP06 (Tracheal/NP Aspirate Samples Pre-dose) 
2. AZIP07 (Physical Exam Study Day 1) 
3. AZIP08 (Drug Administration) (with supplementary attachments)  
4. AZIP09 (Vital Signs) 
5. AZIP13 (Pharmacokinetics Plasma Sample Collection)  
6. AZIP14 (Tracheal/NP Aspirate Samples Post Dose)  
7. AZIP15 (Adverse Events) (with supplementary attachments) 
8. AZIP16 (Serious Adverse Events) (with supplementary attachments) 
9. AZIP17 (Physiologic BPD Assessment) 
10. AZIP18 (Early Termination)  
11. AZIP19 (Final Disposition Form) 
12. AZIP 20 (Protocol Deviation Form) 
13. AZIP21 (Pre-Discharge Questionnaire)  
14. AZIP22 (Six Month Adjusted Age Questionnaire)  
15. AZIP23 (CRF Modification/Update/Deletion Request)  
 Clinical and Translational Research Informatics Center  
The CTRIC under the direction of Dr. Kate Tracy will provide data management services for the study. They will develop the case report forms, data edit and audits, and prepare monthly 
performance reports.  
 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 54 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  Data confidentiality, security, and backup : All data collection instruments are designed by the 
CTRIC to exclude the transmittal of personal identifiers to the study database.  Participant names 
and other directly identifiable information will not be captu red in the research database.  Each 
participant will be assigned a participant ID (PID) and a randomly generated alpha code at the 
initiation of screening.  These two identifiers will uniquely identify participants on all forms and only 
these identifiers will be used when communicating with clinical sites regarding data edits, data audits, and concerns regarding an individual participant. Study data will be stored in a suitably 
designed relational database housed on a password protected departmental server. A ccess to the 
database will be restricted to authorized personnel and require the user to enter an appropriately complex password that is changed on a regular basis.  Any modifications, updates or deletions will 
be implemented only by the database manager, a nd only when the proper documentation has 
been provided by the PI.  A record of each change to the database will be maintained in a 
transaction log to allow for recovery of the original data if needed. Incremental backups of the database are performed daily and the database in its entirety is backed up weekly and maintained 
on tapes that are moved to a fire-proof safe off location to guard against catastrophic loss.  These 
tapes are kept for a minimum of 12 months. This backup mechanism allows for restoration  of the 
server to any desired state in the past.  Thus, in the event of a catastrophic mishap, the data 
system can be rolled back to a state just before the error occurred.  All backups are stored in 
secure locations and on password -protected computers.  
Quality assurance: As data are collected, validity and accuracy checks that will be pre -
programmed will be performed.  Post-capture validity checks may also be programmed to identify 
other data quality issues. Reports of missing forms will be produced, and percent of important 
variables missing will be counted.  Queries will be generated for resolution at the data collection 
point level.  There will be a timely flow of reported information so that the PI or her designate can 
take corrective action when needed to address data quality issues.  
Data edits and audits: Edits are run on the database on a regular basis. Edits include checking for unusual or inconsistent values, as well as examining missing values.  The PI or her designate is 
notified of the edits found and subsequently must make suitable updates to the forms, complete 
the necessary Modification/ Update/ Deletion (MUD) Log, and respond regarding resolution of the 
edits. Items previously queried in the data editing process that are legitimate (e.g., missin g data 
from a previous visit that cannot be gathered at this point in time) are removed from future lists of data edits. Approximately 5% of the scanned forms are randomly selected and a list of requested 
forms is sent to the PI. Copies of the original for ms are marked for re-scanning for comparison with 
the records in the existing database.  The forms are also examined for other problems (e.g., 
improper documentation of changes made on the form).  Discrepancies within the database must 
be resolved. 
Performance monitoring: The performance of the clinical sites is monitored via a variety of 
reports that are produced on a regular basis to assist the PI and project staff in monitoring study 
progression and recruitment, including information on what forms have bee n completed for each 
participant at each assessment time point, summaries of data edits and audits, the number of patients screened over time, the number of patients enrolled over time, and the timeliness of 
submitting forms for processing.  Reports will be stratified by clinical site and/or important 
covariates as appropriate.

10.3.1  Training  
The principal investigator, Dr. Viscardi will train the study coordinators in the procedures for 
tracheal aspirate and nasopharyngeal culture co llection and the room air challenge test.  All study 
procedures will be reviewed during the investigator meeting to be held prior to initiating the study.  
The PI will conduct site initiation visits to all additional sites to review the manual of procedures and sample collection techniques.  
For the neurodevelopmental assessments, a primary neurologic examiner will be identified who will certify annually and certify other examiners at their r espective sites. Training DVDs of neurologic 
exams to include normal neurologic exam, CP, GMFCS ≥ level 2, and neurodevelopmental impairment will be prepared and each primary examiner will score each exam independently and 
their inter-rater agreement with identified Gold Standard examiners will be determin ed. 
10.3.2  Quality Control Committee  
Drs. Viscardi and Terrin will review monthly performance reports for site -specific enrollment, CRF 
completion, data edits (number of error messages), sample collection, and protocol deviations. 
They will contact site research staff if specific problems are identified in order to improve study 
performance. 
10.3.3  Metrics 
The UAB Mycoplasma Diagnostic Laboratory will be the central laboratory for all Ureaplasma 
culture, PCR, and antibiotic susceptibility testing and will conduct all testing according to strict 
standard operating procedures. They will provide 10B broth to all sites for collection of respiratory 
specimens. Appropriate controls will be run with each culture and PCR to identify false positive and 
false negative results.  
Assignment of physiologic BPD is an important secondary outcome. The investigators will be 
trained in the timed oxygen reduction test and all case report forms will be assessed for completion 
and accuracy. The PI will review whether the BPD assessment algorithm was applied accurately in 
each case of infant who survived until 36 weeks PMA.  
10.3.4  Protocol Deviations 
Protocol violations may jeopardize the study by breaching assurances made to the subjects or by diminishing the validity of the study. Major violations are those that endanger patients, such as 
failure to adhere to appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria or undermine the conduct of the study 
such as failure to obtain blood and respiratory samples at the appropriate times. Minor violat ions 
are those that impede the progress of the study, such as not completing CRFs in a timely fashion. If blood draws or tracheal aspirate samples are outside the appropriate time range, an explanation 
will be documented. The principal investigator, site i nvestigators and coordinators will problem-
solve to limit future protocol violations. Protocol violations will be reported to the IRB and the DSMB. 
10.3.5  Monitoring 
The site PI will be responsible for assuring protocol compliance and data quality at their  sites. Dr. 
Viscardi will visit each site annually to review records, consent forms and adherence to procedures 
as outlined in the Manual of Procedures.

This protocol and the informed consent document (Section 16.1) and any subsequent 
modifications will be reviewed and approved by the IRB or ethics committee responsible 
for oversight of the study.  
1111..22  IInnffoorrmmeedd  CCoonnsseenntt  FFoorrmmss  
If an infant qualifies, the PI or coordinator will obtain informed parental consent prior to 
initiation of study procedures. An EKG for QTc measurement will be obtained after 
consent if not done previously during the screening process.  If the PI is also responsible 
for the clinical care of a potential subject, he/she will not participate in the consent discussion with the parents to avoid undue pressure on the parents to agree to the 
study. The information provided in the consent will cover the elements listed in the CFR 
Part 50.25 and be approved by the UMB Institutional Review Board (IRB). This includes 
the investigational nature and objectives of the trial; the procedures and treatments involved and their attendant risks, discomforts, and benefits; and the potential alternative 
therapies, alternative to not participate and right to withdraw without penalty will be 
explained. The study staff personnel will offer to answer any questions. Consent will be 
documented by parental signature on the IRB approved consent form. A copy will be 
given to each legal guardian and this fact will be documented in the participant’s record.

Phase IIb AZIP study 57 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  Steering Committee: A Steering Committee will be responsible for overseeing the study. This 
committee will make major organizational and policy decisions. The committee will include the 
Study Chair, Deputy Chair (Dr. Terrin), Laboratory and Core Directors, and the Clinical Site 
Directors. This group will have quarterly conference calls and meet yearly prior to the annual Clinical Site Directors and Coordinators meeting.  
Publications and Ancillary Studies Committee : A Publications and Ancillary Studies Committee will 
be formed from the study leadership (PIs and Laboratory/Core Directors) and leading Clinical Site Directors. This committee will review all proposals for and final versions of research abstracts, 
presentations, and manuscripts to be submitted to journals and national meetings. The committee 
will also review proposals for ancillary studies. Since the success of the trial depends upon the 
collaboration of the Clinical Sites, credit will be assigned to them (a s the “AZIP Research Group”) 
in the authorship of reports from the study. Each Clinical Site Director and Clinical Site Coordinator 
will be named in an appendix to the main report.

You are being asked to allow your baby to participate in this research study because your baby was born early 
(prematurely). Your baby’s participation in this study is voluntary and you may ask questions at any time . If you are 
consenting for someone else - a child or someone unable to pro vide consent themselves - then the word “you” means 
that person . 
 
PURPOSE OF STUDY 
Approximately 54 % of babie s born very early (before the 27 th week of pregnancy)  have a lung infection with the 
bacteria Ureaplasma  urealyticum . This infection may lead to a chronic lung condition called Bronchopulmonary 
Dysplasia (BPD). There is no known effective treatment for this infection in preterm babies. Azithromycin is an antibiotic approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat infections caused by other bacteria in 
older children and adults , but has not been approved by the FDA for treating Ureaplasma  infections in premature 
babies . This research study i s being done as part of the FDA approval process for the use of azithromycin for this 
purpose. Azithromycin  has been shown to be effective against Ureaplasma  in test tube tests. By measuring blood 
levels of the drug in 40  preterm babies who received azithr omycin as a single dose of either 10 mg or 20 mg or 3 doses 
of 20 mg  for about every 2 pounds of body wei ght as part of a research study, we found that the 3 doses of 20 mg  for 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 64 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  about every 2 pounds of body wei ght was most effective to eliminate the Ureapla sma bacteria from the lungs of babies 
who had the infection. There were no side effects attributed to the antibiotic.  
Babies with and without the Ureaplasma  lung infection may participate in this study to evaluate azithromycin in 
preterm babies.  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether 3 doses of azithromycin 20 mg/kg daily based on body weight will 
effectively eliminate the Ureaplasma  bacteria from the lungs of babies who have the infection and to make sure 
azithromycin is safe in very pr eterm babies. To determine the effectiveness of azithromycin, this study will compare 
the active drug to a placebo. A placebo is an inactive substance made to look like an active medicine. Your child will 
either get the study drug, azithromycin or a placeb o. Researchers use a placebo to see if the study drug works better or 
is safer than not taking anything. In addition, the study will find out how 3 doses of azithromycin or placebo affect 
markers (indicators) of inflammation in the lung in all treated babi es. Finally, the study will find out how 3 doses of 
azithromycin or placebo affect lung health status at 6 months adjusted age (6 months plus number of weeks born 
early) , 12 months adjusted age (12 months plus number of weeks born early)  by a phone intervi ew and lung health and 
development status at 22 -26 months adjusted age (22- 26 months plus number of weeks born early) during a clinic visit . 
A total of 140 subjects at 7  medical centers will be asked to participate in this study. Your baby will be one of 
approximately 40 subjects to be asked to participate at this location.  
The research will be conducted at the following location(s): University of Maryland Baltimore, University of Maryland 
Medical System,  and other sites.  
 
PROCEDURES 
This is a double- blind ed study, which means that neither you or the study doctor or the study staff will know which 
treatment you are receiving.  However, in an emergency, study doctor can get this information.  
If you agree to allow your baby to participate in this study and yo ur baby is eligible for participation you will be asked 
to read and sign this document. If you agree for your baby to participate, the following procedures will be performed. 
1) Nose or respirator tube sample : The fluid from the baby's nose or respirator t ube will be tested for the Ureaplasma  
bacteria 5 times: twice before the baby gets the study drug, once two days after the baby gets the study drug, once from 
4 to 5 days after the drug, and once when the baby is 21 days old, or right before the baby is di scharged, whichever 
comes first . These samples will be sent to the Diagnostic Mycoplasma Laboratory at the University of Alabama, 
Birmingham for bacterial testing. Fluid samples collected at the same times will be tested for indicators of inflammation. The se samples will be obtained during routine suctioning (cleaning) of your baby's nose or the tube in 
your baby's windpipe that is connected to the breathing machine. You will not be contacted with the results of the 
bacteria tests or indicators of inflammat ion testing.  
2) Electrocardiogram (EKG):  If the baby's heartbeat is not regular on his/her bedside monitor, an electrocardiogram 
test (test that measures the electrical activity of the heartbeat) will be done before study drug is given. If a special 
patter n called prolonged QT interval is seen on the EKG, the drug will not be given.  If the baby’s blood potassium, 
magnesium, or calcium levels are low or the blood potassium level is high, the drug will not be given until the blood levels are corrected.   
3) The treatment your child receives will be chosen by chance, like flipping a coin. Neither you nor the study doctor 
will choose what treatment your child gets. Your child will have an equal  chance of being given each treatment. 
Neither you nor the study doctor will know which treatment you are getting. Your baby will receive either the study 
drug (azithromycin) or placebo (an inactive substance  made to look like an active medicine ) once a day for 3 days by 
infusion, which means that it will be given through an intravenous line (line inserted in a vein). Your baby will receive 
the study drug dose  of 20 mg/kg based on their body weight or the same volume of placebo.  Each dose will be given 
over a 1 hour period of time.   
4) Test for BPD : If your baby is still  in the hospital between 
35 to 37  weeks gestation (1 month before the due date) 
and is still receiving extra oxygen through a tube to the nose, he/she will be tested to find out if he/she is ready to stop 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 65 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  the extra oxygen. The extra oxygen will be decreased every 5 minutes by 2% at a time until the extra oxygen is 
stopped and the baby is breathing room air for 30 minutes. The decrease in oxygen will be stopped if the baby's oxygen 
levels are 80 -89% continuously for 5 minutes or less than 80% for 15 seconds at any time. Your baby will be 
monitored continuously throughout the test for BPD by study staff and returned to their starting oxygen treatment as 
soon as the test is done.   
5) Medical Records : The s tudy doctors will review your baby's medical record. The study doctors will review the 
mother's medical record to make note of the treatments she receiv ed within one week of delivery. 
6) Complete questionnaires : Before your baby leaves the hospital, a stud y staff member will contact you to ask 
questions concerning family history of lung problems such as asthma, and exposures such as smoking in the home. 
You will be asked to provide the name and contact information for your child’s health care provider and p ermission to 
contact them after your child reaches 6 months adjusted age.  Adjusted age is the age your baby would be if born on his 
or her due date . At 6 mo nths adjusted age, 12 months adjusted age, and between 22 and 26 months adjusted age, a 
study member  will contact you by phone to obtain a lung health history for your child by asking about breathing 
problems, illnesses, hospital stays, emergency room or doctor visits, and prescribed treatments. We will call your 
health care provider at this time to conf irm your child’s medical history.  
7) Development assessment : When your baby is between 22 and 26 months adjusted age, the study staff will schedule 
a visit at the Mount Washington Pediatric Hospital Outpatient Clinic located at 1708 W. Rogers Ave., Baltimore, MD to evaluate your child’s development. He/she will ha ve a complete physical exam including a neurologic exam of 
his/her muscle tone, strength, and reflexes. The developmental test will evaluate your child’s developmental 
milestones. You will receive a report about your child at the end of this visit.  
Your b aby will receive the same medical care whether s/he joins the study or not. In addition to the regular care for 
prematurity, the study doctors and nurses will follow your baby closely to make sure the infusions are safe.   
If the Ureaplasma  bacteria is obta ined from the baby's nose or respirator tube culture, your child may be eligible for 
future studies of Ureaplasma  bacteria as a result of his/her participation in this study. However, you may decline 
permission for future use of his/her samples and still a gree to their participation in this study.  
 
I ______ agree ______ do not agree to have my child's bacteria samples stored for possible use in future studies 
(please initial).  
 
Please ______ do ______ do not contact me for future studies (please initial).
 
WHAT ARE MY RESPONSIBILITIES IF I TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH?  
If you take part in this research, you will be responsible to:  
§ Ask questions about anything you do not understand  
§ For your child to complete all research procedures unless you formally request to withdraw from the study 
§ Bring your child to the follow -up clinic for scheduled visit between 22 and 26 months adjusted age  
§ Notify study staff of all changes to your contact information including your address, phone numbers, and e -mail address  
PPOOTTEENNTTIIAALL  RRIISSKKSS//DDIISSCCOOMMFFOORRTTSS:: 
Fluid from the baby's nose or respirator tube will be collected at the time of routine suctioning by the baby's nurse. The 
discomfort from this procedure is minimal.   
As the extra oxygen is decreased for the BPD test, the baby may experience brief periods of lower oxygen levels or 
brief periods of lower heart rate.  The baby’s oxygen level will be monitored for the entire BPD test and the extra 
oxygen will be adjusted if needed.   
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 66 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  The most common side effects reported in older childre n and adults treated with azithromycin are gastrointestinal 
symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (about 10%), pain at the injection site (6%), and less often vaginitis 
(vaginal discharge or infection), abdominal (belly) pain, loss of appetite, r ash, and itching. Fewer than 1 in 100 babies 
had side effects of  burping, passing gas, stomach upset, mouth yeast infection (thrush), headache, sleepiness, 
bronchospasm (temporary narrowing of airways into the lungs), and funny taste. In most cases these s ymptoms were 
mild. Rarely, heartbeat abnormalities, allergic reactions, pseudomembranous colitis (inflammatory condition of the large intestine due to imbalance of "good" and "bad" bacteria in the intestine) and reversible hearing loss have been 
reported. Blood tests for liver and kidney function were out of normal range for 6% or less in older children and adults 
treated with azithromycin. Low numbers of white blood cells (cells that fight infection) and platelets (cells that form 
blood clot) have occurred  in less than 1% of treated individuals. Laboratory blood tests went back to normal in other 
clinical trials of azithromcyin. Side effects seen  in infants  with oral (by mouth) azithromycin and similar antibiotics  
include pyloric stenosis (narrowing of the stomach connection to the small intestine). Pyloric stenosis can lead to stomach blockage requiring s urgery to relieve the blockage.  Since azithromycin is an antibiotic, there is the risk of 
other bacteria that a re resistant to the antibiotic starting a new illness.  
There is a risk to confidentiality. This risk will be minimized by storing your baby’s personal and medical information 
collected as part of this study in a secure location (locked file in the PI's of fice) and electronic data will be password 
protected.   
There are no other additional known risks and discomforts associated with this study other than those of the infusion 
over and above the risks of being extremely premature and in the NICU. There may be  unforeseen risks of 
participation in the study. If you have any questions about the risks, please ask your baby's doctor, the study doctor, or 
the study staff.

lungs if there is an infection. Your baby's participation may provide information that may benefit other babies with 
Ureaplasma  lung infection in the future by helping to determine whether 3 doses of azithromycin is effective in 
eliminating the infection . Still, your baby may get no direct benefit from this study. You need to decide if your child’s 
participation in this research study is in your child’s best interest.

Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 3 SUMMARY OF MAJOR PROTOCOL AMENDMENT CHANGES  
Amendment 2  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to improve current enroll ment . Incident dialysis 
subjects, target patient population for this study, are difficult to find; furthermore, they are less 
willing to participate in a clinical study due to start of routine dialysis, a life changing event. Among those who are interested to participate, the vast majority are not qualifying per current protocol eligibility criteria. Upon analyzing reasons for screen- fail and feedback from various 
investigators, it appears that some of the eligibility criteria and conduct of the study are overly restrictive and/or not per current standard of care. As a result, a large number of incident dialysis subjects who are otherwise good candidates and would benefit from this study are not being able to participate under existing eligibility criteria a nd protocol design. In order to be able to enroll 
and retain a representative sample of real -life incident dialysis subjects, we modified the 
following eligibility criteria and study conducts to reflect current standard of care in this patient population.  None of these proposed modifications are expected to compromise safety and wellbeing of the subjects who may now qualify under revised criteria.     
In addition to the major changes listed below, minor editorial changes will be  made throughout 
the document to correct typographical errors and to improve consistency and clarity.

Inclusion Criteria:  
Inclusion criteria # 3.1 has been modified by 
removing “native kidney” – the revised verbiage 
reads as follows:  
3.1   Amendment 2 : Incident dialysis subjects receiving dialysis for ESRD for  ≥ 2 weeks but ≤ 4 months at the time of randomization  
Inclusion criteria # 6.1 has been streamlined by reducing hemoglobin (Hb) testing frequency (fr om 
three to two) and interval between Hb tests (from ≥4 days to ≥2 days) to confirm eligibility - the revised 
verbiage reads as follows (revised text is italicized and bolded):  
     6.1  Amendment 2: For Incident dialysis 
subjects (as defined in 3.1), mean of the 
subject’s two most recent central lab Hb values 
during the Screening Period must be ≥  8.5 g/dL 
and ≤12.0 g/dL; with an absolute difference of ≤ 1.3 g/dL between the highest and the lowest 
value. Samples are obtained at least 2 days 
apart and the last Hb value must be within 10 days prior to the randomization visit  
 
Inclusion criteria # 7, 8, 9, 10 additional text has 
been added to allow for subjects that may qualify  
To allow subject s who restarted dialysis 
recently due to transplanted kidney end- stage 
renal disease (see revised Exclusion # 20 below)  
 
  
Reducing Hb testing frequency and interval 
between tests will shorten the minimum screening time requirement and is expected to improve overall screening success.  
Also, to align with the Hb eligibility criteria in 
the FGCL -4592- 063 incident -dialysis study  - 
currently being conducted at the same centers in the US.

follows (added text is italicized): 
7. Subject has a ferritin level ≥  100 ng/mL at 
screening  
Amendment 2 : Subjects with a ferritin level 
< 100 ng/mL at screening may qualify upon 
receiving iron supplement (per local standard of 
care)  
8. Subject has a transferrin saturation (TSAT) level ≥  20% at screening  
Amendment 2: Subjects with a TSAT level < 20% at screening may qualify upon receiving  
iron supplement (per local standard of care)  
9. Subject has a serum folate level ≥  lower limit of 
normal (LLN) at screening  
Amendment 2: Subjects with a serum folate level <  LLN at screening may qualify upon 
receiving fol ate supplement (per local standard 
of care)  
10. Subject has a serum vitamin B
12 level ≥  LLN at 
screening  
Amendment 2: Subjects with a Vitamin B 12 
level <  LLN at screening may qualify upon 
receiving B 12 supplement (per local standard of 
care)  
 participate upon receiving supplement) will 
improve screening success rate. Also, this 
would help to shorten screening period by 
minimizing “unscheduled visit” to retest these parameters via central lab.   
   
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
Exclusion criteria 1, 11, 15, 16, 18, 19,  20 and 24 
have been modified to read as follows (revised text is bolded and italicized):  
1. Subject  has received  a red blood cell (RBC) 
transfusion within  8 weeks  prior to 
randomization   
Amendment 2:   Subject has received a red 
blood cell ( RBC) transfusion within 4 weeks 
prior to randomization  
 
11. Subject with New York Heart Association 
(NYHA)  Class III or IV  congestive heart failure  
 
15. Subject has a diagnosis or suspicion (eg, 
complex kidney cyst of Bosniak Category II or 
higher) of renal cell carcinoma as shown on These exclusion criteria have been modified to 
allow more incident subjects to participate who are otherwise good candidate for this study  
  RBC transfusion within 4 weeks prior to 
randomization is not expected to impact baseline Hb. No additional safety concerns.   
 
 
   Changing “has known” to “with” to align with other incident dialysis protocol     
  Changing from renal ultrasound to renal imaging will allow all acceptable imaging 
options e.g. ultrasound, CT scans, MRI etc.

malignancy, except for the following: cancers determined to be cured or in remission for ≥ 2 
years, curatively resected basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers, cervical cancer in situ, or resected colonic polyps  
18. Subject has an active, clinically significant (CS) infection or ev idence of an underlying infection, 
as manifested by white blood cell count (WBC) 
> ULN, and/or fever, in conjunction with 
clinical signs or symptoms of infection at the time of randomization  
19. Subject has any of the following known untreated conditions: prol iferative diabetic 
retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, macular degeneration or retinal vein occlusion (subjects who are already blind may qualify to participate)  
20. Prior organ transplant: s ubjects who have one 
of the following  conditions or states  
a) experienced  rejection of transplanted organ within 6 months of transplantation  
b) currently on high doses of 
immunosuppressive therapy (per discretion of 
the PI)  
c) are scheduled for organ transplantation (on the waiting list for kidney transplant is not exclu sionary)  
24. Amendment 2: Subject has a history of alcohol 
or drug abuse within 6 months  prior to 
screening  
  
 Changing (cancer cured) from ≥5 years to ≥2 
years will allow more incident subjects to qualify. No apparent safety concerns.  
   
“at the time of randomization” has been  added 
to clarify the timing of exclusion due to this 
criterion.  
    
Text is added to clarify that subjects who are 
already blind due to the complications of one or more of these conditions are OK to participate as there is no possibility of further 
worsening.  
   Revised to allow otherwise eligible incident subjects with prior organ transplant to participate except who experienced transplant 
rejection within 6 months of transplantation or 
on high doses of immunosuppressive therapy (due to potential confounding effe cts on safety 
and efficacy assessments)  
  
 
 Potential subjects with no history of alcohol or drug abuse within 6 mo nths are OK to 
participate – changing from 2 years to 6 
months  does not pose any additional safety risk

Dose Adjustments text regarding <20 mg dosing has been to modified to read as follows (revised text is 
bolded and italicized):  
If a subject requires < 20 mg TIW (i.e., <  60 mg per 
week) to maintain a Hb level of approximately 11 g/dL, the dosing frequency should be reduced in a 
step-wise fashion e.g. TIW to BIW, BIW to QW, 
QW to Q -2 Week etc.  
 
 
 To provide guidance on IP dosing if a subject 
requires further dose reduction from 20 mg

Roxadustat subject who receives an ESA inadvertently and does not meet the criteria above 
may be allowed to continue taking study medication, 
if considered safe by the Investigator or Medical Monit or. 
 
To: 
Inadvertent ESA administration or ESA 
administration by the hospital staff in Roxadustat subjects should not be counted as rescue unless above criteria are met; these subjects may be allowed to continue taking study medication, if considered safe by the Investigator or Medical Monitor.  ESA therapy is the only standard of care to 
treat anemia in ESRD patients. It is a common practice to administer ESA as a routine therapy during dialysis session. Text has been added to clarify that inadvertent ESA administration or 
ESA administration by the hospital staff as part 
of the standard of care in Roxadustat subjects 
should not be counted as ESA rescue unless protocol specified rescue criteria are met.  SYNOPSIS ;

1st line of therapy to read as follows (revised text is 
bolded) :  
In this study, oral iron should be allowed as the 
preferred  first- line of iron supplementation for both 
treatment arms without restriction.  
All subjects should  be encouraged to take oral iron 
if they can tolerate as the preferred  first- line iron 
supplementation during the Treatment Period.  
 
 
Supplemental iron use language has been modified to 
lessen restrictions on IV iron use. IV iron administration criteria/rules have been replaced by local standard of care.  Revised text reads as follows (deleted IV iron guidelines is not shown here)  Many ESRD patients cannot tolerate oral iron 
therapy due to GI adverse effects including GI bleeding. Channing to “preferred 1
st line” 
would allow flexibility.  
 
   
 
 
 
IV iron has been the standard of care for iron 
supplementation in ESRD anemia subjects and 
it is routinely administered in subjects who are 
on ESA therapy. Current protocol IV iron administration guidelines are seen as overly restrictive and not in line with the current 
standard of care.   Text has been revised to SYNOPSIS ;

Randomization/Treatment Period:  
Added text regarding 1st dose of study medication in 
subjects who were on long- acting ESAs during 
screening  to read as follows:  
Subjects on long- acting ESAs (Aranesp or Mircera) 
may not receive the 1st dose of study medication on 
the day of randomization due to ESA dosing schedule (e.g. once weekly or once bi -weekly); in these 
subjects, the 1
st dose of study medication (roxadustat 
or epoetin- alfa) should be administered on the day 
when the next dose of current ESA would have been 
due.  For all practical purposes, the date of 1st dose 
of study drug administration should be considered as 
Day 1.  To clarify the process of randomization and 
Day 1 dosing in subjects who are on long-acting ESAs during screening. Typically, randomization and Day 1 dosing happen on the same day (when ESA d ose is due) however, 
due to long ESA dosing interval (e.g. once 
every two weeks), randomization and Day 1 
dosing may take place on separate days.  Sections

Action taken regarding study drug ( decision taken 
by the PI in response to an AE) 
 To clarify that “Action taken regarding the 
study drug” refers to PI’s decision in response 
to an AE (e.g. PI temporarily stopped the study 
drug) as opposed to subject’s own decision  (subject did not take study drug as s/he was not feeling well or did not have with him/her)  Section

Pregnancies: Reporting and Follow -up of 
Subjects  
Added clarification regarding confirmation of pregnancy  
A pregnancy in a female subject must be confirmed by positive serum β -hCG test. If β -hCG test is found 
positive in a female subject of child bearing potential,  study drug should be placed on hold temporarily until pregnan cy is ruled out via a repeat 
test ≥3 days.    Text is added to reflect the current clini cal 
practice to confirm pregnancy in this patient population (known to have high false positive 
pregnancy results – requires repeat testing to 
confirm). Also, to minimize exposure to the 
fetus as a precaution (in case pregnancy is confirmed).  Section 
8.3.6  
Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Measurement 
Guidelines  
Revised BP and HR measurement guidelines ( added 
text is bolded and italicized):  
Blood pressure should  be measured in triplicate 
(preferred ) with at least one minute interval between 
the measurements.  
Heart rate (HR) should  be measured in triplicate  
(preferred) with at least one minute interval between the measurements .    Measuring BP  and HR three times (at least one 
minute interval) before dialysis is not per standard clinical practice and is difficult to implement as it requires additional time and manpower.  Added verbiage “preferred” will 
provide flexibility to the sites. Also, will help 
to avoid protocol deviations.    Appendix 5 
Protocol Deviations:  
Texts have been added to pre -specify issues that are 
not to be considered as protocol deviations. Added texts read as follows: 
Due to the unique nature of this study, following 
issues are not to be considered as protocol deviations:  
 
Given the complexity in EPO dose adjustments and 
the need to take into account the various clinical 
parameters in EPO dose titration, one would not consider  it a protocol deviation when patients are 
dosed according to local standard of care whether  or 
not it is concordant with   package insert/SmPC  
 
Given the complexity in Roxadustat dose adjustments 
and the need to take into account the various clinic al 
parameters in Roxadustat dose titration, one would  
  
To allow flexibility with EPO dos ing where 
investigators/sites are not able to follow 
epoetin -alfa package insert guidelines due to 
various factors including clinical status of the subjects.  
Per study design, various factors such as, HemoCue Hb value, Central lab Hb value, PI’s decision e tc. can influence dose titration 
decisions at the time of the visit or after the visit. As a result, dose prescribed may not 
match exactly with the dose that would have 
been prescribed per dose adjustment algorithm.  
However, as the stable dose would be ac hieved 
through titration, dosing discrepancy when 
subjects are dosed based on their clinical status

Roxadustat subjects often receive ESA when 
they are hospitalized either because the 
hospital doesn’t allow subjects to take any 
experimental therapy such as Roxadustat at the hospital or subjects do not have access t o their 
study drug while they are at the hospital. Given that ESA is administered to treat anemia as part of the hospital standard care, ESA 
administration in any of these circumstances 
should not be considered as protocol deviation.  
 
IV iron is the stand ard of care for iron 
supplementation in this patient population. IV 
iron is administered routinely in all 
hospitalized patients who are on dialysis including study subjects as part of the hospital standard of practice. IV iron administered in study subject s while they are hospitalized are 
not to be reported as protocol deviation in this 
study.

Study Title:  A Phase 3, Open-Label, Randomized, Active- Controlled  Study to 
Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Roxadustat ( FG-4592) in the 
Maintenance Treatment of Anemia in subjects with End Stage Renal 
Disease (ESRD) on Stable Dialysis  
Protocol Number:  FGCL -4592-064 
Investigational Product: Roxadustat ( FG-4592) 
Target Population: The study population consists of subjects with ESRD who are on stable hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) and treated with an erythropoiesis- stimulating agent (ESA) for anemia.  
Amendment 1  & 2: Incident dialysis subjects with ESRD who 
are on dialysis for at least 2 weeks but no more than 4 months (at the time of randomization) and treated with an erythrocyte stimulating agent (ESA) for anemia for at least 4 weeks ( prior to 
screening ).  
 
IND Nu mber:  074454 
Study Phase:  Phase 3  
Study Centers Planned:  Up to approximately 200 study centers worldwide. 
Number of Subjects Planned:  A total of up to approximately 1200 subjects are planned to be randomized in an open-label, 1:1 ratio to receive either of the following two treatments: 
• Roxadustat  (up to approximately 600 subjects) 
• Active Control: epoetin alfa (up to approximately 600 subjects)  
Under Amendment 1 & 2 , approximately 150 incident dialysis  
subjects (as defined above) will be randomized to either roxadustat or epoetin alfa (active control) in a 1:1 ratio  
Primary Objectives:  Evaluate the efficacy and safety of roxadustat  compared with active 
control (epoetin alfa) for the maintenance treatment of anemia in subjects with ESRD on stable dialysis.  
Secondary Objectives:  • Evaluate the utilization of intravenous (IV) iron with roxadustat compared with active control (epoetin al fa) 
• Evaluate the effect of roxadustat on serum lipid parameters compared with active control (epoetin alfa) 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 21 Study Design Overview:  This open-label, randomized, active controlled study is designed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of roxadustat  compared to epoetin 
alfa for the maintenance of hemoglobin (Hb) levels in subjects on 
HD or PD originally on ESA for treatment of anemia. 
Home -hemodialysis (HHD) subjects may be allowed to participate if 
all eligibility  criteria are met.  
The study periods are as fo llows:  
• Screening Period:  Up to 6 weeks. For subjects currently 
taking Mircera®, the Screening Period can be extended up to 
8 weeks  
• Treatment Period: Treatment duration is variable for 
individual subjects, with a minimum treatment duration of 52 weeks and a maximum duration of up to approximately 3 years after the last subject is randomized   
Amendment 1  & 2: In order to complete the Phase 3 
program in a timely manner, minimum treatment duration of subjects enrolled under Amendment 1 & 2  may be shortened. 
Subjects will be informed at least 4 weeks in advance if such decision is made. All active subjects will end the study at the same time.  
• Post-Treatment  Follow- Up Period:  4 weeks  
During the course of the study, visits and assessments will be performed as defined in the schedule of assessments.  
Screening Period  
After signing the informed consent, subjects enter the Screening Period. During the Screening Period eligibility assessments will be performed. Subjects in s creening  will continue their exis ting ESA 
therapy (eg, epoetin alfa, beta, theta, or zeta, darbepoetin alfa, Mircera
®) for the treatment of anemia associated with ESRD.  
Subjects on dose-hold due to high haemoglobin may qualify for screening however, they cannot be randomized if in investigator’s opinion they are not ready to resume epoetin-alfa or roxadustat upon randomization. Upon successful completion of screening, a total of up to 1200 eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either roxadustat or epoetin alfa (active control) in a 1:1 ratio. Both roxadustat and epoetin alfa will be administered in an open label manner.  
Randomization must be completed prior to administration of study medication.  
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 22 Randomization to treatment arms will be provided by an interactive 
web and voice response system (IWRS) based on stratification 
factors.  
If Day 1 lab values (collected prior to administration of study medication) suggests potential of pre treatment condition 
confounding safety assessment or poses safety risks to study subject, in the opinion of the Investigator or Medical Monitor, the subject may be discontinued from the study (example: At Screening 1 visit, LFT values wer e within the protocol range but at Day1, AST or ALT 
> 3x ULN and Total bilirubin > 2x ULT, or AST or ALT >  5x 
ULN).  
Treatment Period  
Administration of the first dose of study treatment (roxadustat or epoetin alfa) will occur on Day 1 (Week 0) which should correspond to the administration of the subject’s next dose of their current ESA treatment. At the Day 1, subjects randomized to Roxadustat Arm will discontinue prior ESA therapy and initiate roxadustat therapy; subjects randomized to Epoetin- Alfa Arm will receive epoetin -alfa 
irrespective of their prior ESA use.   
 The initial dose of study medication will be determined based on t he 
average prescribed ESA dose in the last 4 weeks prior to 
randomization if on epoetin or darbepoetin (8 weeks if on Mircera
®) 
as outlined in Table S1  or Table S2  for subjects randomized to 
receive roxadustat or epoetin alfa, respectively. The initial dose of roxadustat will remain constant during the first 4 weeks of the Treatment Period, except if a dose reduction is required for excessive hematopoiesis . 
Subsequent dose adjustments for roxadustat subjects will follow the dose adjustments guidelines as outlined in Appendix 2 in order to maintain a Hb level of approximately 11 g/dL during the Treatment 
Period. Dose adjustments for epoetin alfa subjects should follow the dosing recommendations as per the approved country- specific 
epoetin alfa Package Insert or Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). In PD and HHD subjects, if r eceiving epoetin alfa 
subcutaneously, the dose and frequency may be determined by the Investigator per local standard of care.  
Day 1 study procedures including laboratory blood draws are to be completed prior to administration of the first dose of study tr eatment. 
In HD subjects, Day 1 procedures with the exception of health -related quality of life (HRQoL) assessments should be 
completed prior to the subject receiving dialysis that day. Weight 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 23 measurement will be taken after completion of dialysis (ie, dry 
weight). 
Total treatment duration is variable for individual subjects. Subjects 
will receive study treatment (roxadustat or epoetin alfa) for a minimum of 52 weeks. The maximum treatment duration may be up to approximately 3 years from the date the last subject is randomized.  
In order to complete the Phase 3 program in a timely manner, 
minimum treatment duration of subjects enrolled under Amendment 1 & 2  may be shortened. Subjects will be informed at 
least 4  weeks in advance if such decision is made. All active subjects 
will end the study at the same time.  
During the Treatment Period, subjects will attend weekly study visits from Day 1 to Week 2, followed by every 2 weeks study visits from Weeks 4 to 24 (eg, Weeks 4, 6). Following Week 24, study visits will occur every 4 weeks (eg, Weeks 28, 32) until End of Treatment 
(EOT). A common closeout will occur when a predetermined number of adjudicated cardiovascular (CV) events have been accrued across multiple studies in the overall Phase 3 dialysis program.  
At each study visit during the Treatment Period, Hb will be 
measured (prior to dialysis in HD subjects) locally to determine the 
need for a dose adjustment or to assess for excessive hematopoiesis. In the event that the Hb value from the central laboratory i s 
significantly different from the value  that measured locally, and per 
Investigator that warrants a reversal of the dose adjustment decision made earlier based on locally measured Hb value, the Medical Monitor should be informed, if possible. 
Post-Treatment  Follow- Up Period  
After completing  the Treatment Period, subjects proceed to the post-
treatment  Follow-up Period and will return for the End of Study 
(EOS) visit. The choice of anemia treatment during the Follow -up 
Period is up to the discretion of the Investigator. If the Investigator 
decides to resume ESA treatment in roxadustat treated subjects, the first dose of ESA should be administered at least three days after the last dose of roxadustat.  
Long- term Follow -Up for Premature Treatment Discontinued 
Subjects  
Subjects who discontinue study medication prematurely will be 
followed up for vital status, CV events, and hospitalization until study closure, unless consent to participate is withdrawn. Upon completion of EOT and EOS visits, these subjects will be followed 
up every 3 -6 month interval (depending on the availability of 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 24 subjects) until study closure. These visits may occur either in -person 
or via telephone. 
Data Safety Monitoring Board   
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety data at 
least every 6 months or twice per calendar year while the trial is ongoing to ensure subject safety during the study. Details will be specified in a DSMB charter.  
Independent Event Review Committee 
An Independent Event Review Committee (IERC), blinded to 
treatment group, will adjudicate pre specified CV, cerebrovascular, 
and thromboembolic safety events of interest. These events include all cause death , myocardial infarction ( MI), stroke, congestive heart 
failure requiring hospitalization, unstable angina requiring hospitalization, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, vascular access thrombosis, and hypertensive emergency. A separate event adjudication charter will describe the process in detail, and training materials will be provided to study sites.

Study Procedures:  See Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 3) 
Investigational Product Roxadustat  
• Tablets  
• Streng ths of 20 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg 
 
Route of Administration: Oral (all tablets must be administered whole)  
Doses:  
In subjects on HD or PD or HHD randomized to roxadustat, the 
initial roxadustat dose will be determined using a conversion table 
based on the subject’s previous average weekly prescribed ESA dose in the last 4 weeks prior to randomization if the subject is on epoetin or darbepoetin, and average monthly (4 weeks) prescribed ESA dose in 8 weeks prior to randomization if the subject is on Mircera
® 
(Table S1 ). If the mean qualifying screening Hb value at 
randomization is < 10 g/dL, the starting roxadustat dose will be 
increased by one dose step. For example, a subject on epoetin ( ie, 
epoetin alfa, beta, theta, zeta, delta, or omega ) 6,000  IU/week with 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 29 mean screening Hb of 9.4 g/dL at randomization will start roxadustat 
at a dose of 150 mg three times weekly (TIW).  
If the converted initial dose exceeds the maximum dose of 
3.0 mg/kg/dose then the lower dose step should be chosen as the initial dose.  
The dose of roxadustat will remain constant during the first 4 weeks of the Treatment Period unless a dose reduction is required for excessive hematopoiesis .

Notes:  The roxadustat dose steps are 20, 40, 50, 70, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, and 
400 mg.  
Dose Adjustments: 
During the Treatment Period, roxadustat dose adjustment will be 
made according to the dose adjustment algorithm in Appendix 2, in order to maintain a Hb level of approximately 11 g/dL.  
Roxadustat dose adjustments are permitted from Week 4 onwards, 
and every 4 weeks thereafter (eg, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12); however, dose may be adjusted between two prespecified windows (eg, anytime between Week 4 and Week 8 visits, Week 8 and Week 12 visits) if the following two criteria are met:  
• No dose adjustment has been made in last 4 weeks, 
• Hemoglobin (Hb) <  9.0 g/dL. 
Subjects on HD or PD or HHD randomized to roxadustat will take doses TIW for the entire duration of the Treatment Period. I f a 
subject requires < 20 mg TIW (ie, <  60 mg per week) to maintain a 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 30 Hb level of approximately 11 g/dL , the d osing frequency should  be 
reduced in a step -wise fa shion e.g. TIW to BIW, BIW to  QW , QW to 
Q-2 Week  etc. 
In this study, a rate of rise of Hb > 2 g/dL within 4 weeks or a Hb 
level of ≥  13 g/dl at any time would be considered as excessive 
haematopoiesis. For a rate of rise of Hb > 2 g/dL within 4 weeks, dose should be reduced by one dose step and for a Hb value ≥ 13.0 g/dL, the dose should be on hold until Hb drops < 12.0 g/dL 
per guidelines provided in the protocol  (Appendix 2). When 
roxadustat will be resumed, the dose should be reduced by one dose step.  
Dose adjustments or temporary dose holds for excessive 
hematopoiesis can occur at any time during the Treatment Period. Any dose adjustment will reset the dose-adjustment window to every 4 weeks thereafter (eg, dose adjustment for a qualified reason at Week 6 leads to next dose adjustment at Week 10).  
Prescribed  dose must not exceed the maximum allowable dose of 
3.0 mg/kg/dose or 400 mg per dose, whichever is lower. For dose 
adjustment purposes, post-dialysis weight (dry-weight) should be used. I f the post-dialysis weight of the current visit is not available at 
the time of dose adjustment, post-dialysis weight of the prior dialysis session or last recorded post- dialysis weight may be used.  
Reference Therapy:  Epoetin Alfa  (active control)  
Route of Administration: 
Hemodialysis (HD): Intravenous 
Peritoneal dialysis (PD)  or home hemo -dialysis (HHD) : Intravenous 
or subcutaneous Subjects randomized to the epoetin alfa arm who are currently taking 
nonepoetin alfa treatment will be switched to epoetin alfa treatment on Day 1. All subjects on HD will receive IV epoetin alfa TIW starting from Day 1, irrespective of their baseline route of administration or frequency of ESA use. Subjects requiring ultra- low 
dose of EPO (eg, ≤1000 IU/per week), frequency of administration may be adjusted per loc al standard of care.  
Subjects on PD or HHD may continue using the same route of administration as baseline; however, if the Investigator decides to change the route of administration in a PD subject from subcutaneous to IV after randomization it should be done during the early part of the treatment phase (preferably prior to Week 16).  
All epoetin alfa administrations should be performed by the Investigator or an authorized member of the site staff  or other trained 
personnel . In subjects on PD or HHD , epoetin alfa may be self -
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 31 administered subcutaneously by the subject or a caregiver after 
adequate training or, if in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject 
or a caregiver is already adequately trained in self -administering 
ESA prior to the study.  
   Doses:  
In subjects who have been randomized to the epoetin alfa treatment arm, the initial epoetin alfa dose that the subject will receive on Day 1 will be determined using a conversion table based on the 
subject’s average weekly prescribed ESA dose in 4 weeks prior to randomization if on epoetin or darbepoetin, and average monthly (4-week) prescribed ESA dose in 8 weeks prior to randomization if 
on Mircera
® (Table S2 ).  
In case of a change in route of administration from subcutaneous to IV (TIW), the initial dose of IV epoetin alfa will be determined by the Investigator per local standard of care.  
In subjects on PD or HHD , if receiving epoetin alfa subcutaneously, 
the dose and frequency may be determined by the Investigator per 
local standard of care.

FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 32 Subsequent epoetin alfa dosing and dose adjustment during the 
study, if indicated, should be based on the country specific package 
insert or SmP C. 
For countries using pre filled epoetin alfa syringes, the initial dose 
and subsequent dosages following dose adjustments during the 
Treatment Period should be approximated to the closest total weekly 
dose. 
Rescue Therapy and 
Emergency Procedures:  Rescue Therapy Guidelines:  
Rescue therapy guidelines are provided to optimize the standardization of rescue therapy by Investigators and to ensure the safety of individual study subjects. Use of rescue therapy and reason for rescue therapy should be recorded in the electronic case report 
form (eCRF ). 
Red Blood Cell Transfusion (for all subjects)  
For subjects in both treatment arms, RBC transfusion is allowed if 
rapid correction of anemia is required to stabilize the subject’s condition (eg, acute hemorrhage ) or the Investigator is of the opinion 
that the blood transfusion is a medical necessity. If the situation permits, the Medical Monitor should be informed prior to any scheduled RBC transfusion. Study treatment may continue during or after the RBC transfusion.  
Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agent (ESA) Use  
For subjects randomized to roxadustat the use of ESAs is generally 
prohibited. Erythropoiesis stimulating agent rescue is restricted to no more than one cycle of use during the Treatment Period; the Investigator may initiate use of an approved erythropoietin (EPO) analogue if all of the following criteria are met:  
• A subject’s Hb level has not sufficiently responded to two or more dose increases or the maximum dose limit of the study drug has been reached, and 
• The subject’s Hb is < 8.5 g/dL on two consecutive measurements (central lab) drawn at least five days apart; and  
• Clinical judgment does not suggest iron deficiency or 
bleeding as a cause of lack of response or rapid decline in Hb, 
and 
• Reducing the risk of alloimmunization in transplant eligible patients and/or reduction of other RBC transfusion- related 
risks is a goal 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 33 The subject is not allowed to be administered both EPO  analogue 
and study drug at the same time. Treatment with an EPO  analogue 
should be started ≥  3 days after the last dose of roxadustat, and 
should be stopped when Hb > 9 g/dL or after 4- week s, whichever 
comes first. If a subject requires longer than 4- week s therapy due to 
inadequate response, the Medical Monitor should be contacted. 
Study treatment should be resumed after the following intervals: 
• Two days after stopping epoetin  
• One week after stopping darbepoetin alfa  
• Two weeks after stopping methoxy polyethylene glycol-
epoetin beta (Mircera®) 
If more than one cycle of EPO  analogue rescue is required, the 
Investigator should permanently discontinue study drug. Use of EPO  
analogues will be recorded in the eCRF.  
Inadvertent ESA administration or ESA administration by the 
hospital staff in Roxadustat subject s should not be counted as rescue 
unless above criteria are met; these subjects may be allowed to continue taking study medication, if considered safe by the Investigator or Medical Monitor. 
For subjects randomized to epoetin alfa, the Investigator may initiate 
use of a diff erent EPO  analogue if clinically indicated. Use of the 
different EPO  analogue will be recorded in the eCRF and will be 
considered rescue therapy.  
Emergency Procedure ( Therapeutic Phlebotomy ) 
If there are clinical concerns for a subject’s high Hb levels, the Investigator may decide to perform a therapeutic phlebotomy in addition to temporarily withholding the study drug This should be documented and discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
Supplemental Iron Use : In a Phase 2 study, there was no significant difference in Hb levels in roxadustat - treated dialysis patients receiving oral iron 
supplementation compared to subjects receiving IV iron supplementation, in patients with ferritin <  100 ng/mL and in those 
with TSAT<  20%. Based on the mechanism of action of roxadustat 
and the Phase 2 study results, in subjects randomized to roxadustat, oral iron supplementation is considered to be sufficient.  
In this study, oral iron should be allowed as the preferred first -line of 
iron supplementation for both treatment arms without restriction.  
In addition to the scheduled assessments, iron indices may be 
assessed at any time (via central lab) to evaluate iron storage status of the subjects, if considered necessary by the Investigator.  
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 34 Oral Iron Supplementation  
All subjects should be encouraged to take oral iron if they can 
tolerate as the preferred first -line iron supplementation during the 
Treatment Period. Provision of an oral iron supplement is encouraged; the dose and fr equency are at the discretion of the 
principal Investigator. Oral Iron therapy should be started before the 
subject becomes iron deplete d. 
Intravenous Iron Supplementation 
Intravenous iron supplementation is permitted if in the opinion of the 
Investigator the subject has not responded adequately and is considered iron deficient .  IV iron may be administered per local 
standard of care as deemed necessary by the investigator.   
Treatment with study medication (roxadustat or epoetin) will 
continue during IV iron administration. Discontinuation of IV iron supplementation is recommended once the subject is no longer considered iron deficient (eg, ferritin ≥  100 ng/mL and TSAT 
≥ 20%) 
Subjects may receive IV iron during the post- treatment Follow -up 
Period per discretion of the Investigator. If IV iron is to be administered at the EOT visit, all visit procedures including lab draws should be completed prior to administering IV iron.  
Prohibited Medication:  The following medications/therapies are prohibited during the period identified: 
• Any investigational drug from 4 weeks prior to screening until EOS  
• Androgens from screening until EOS  
• Iron-chelating agents (eg, deferoxamine/desferrioxamine, 
deferiprone, or deferasirox th erapy) from 4 weeks prior to 
randomization until EOS  
• Dapsone (at any dose) from screening until EOS  
• Chronic doses acetaminophen/paracetamol > 2.0 g/day from 
randomization until 1 week after EOT  
Efficacy Endpoints and Assessments:  Primary:  
• US (FDA) submiss ion:  Hemoglobin (Hb) change from 
baseline to the average Hb level during the evaluation period defined as Week  28 until Week 52  
• EU regulatory submission :  Hemoglobin (Hb) change from baseline to the average level Hb of Weeks 28 to 36, without

Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 35 ESA therapy) within 6 weeks prior to and during this 8 -week 
evaluation period.  
Secondary:  
• US (FDA) submission:  proportion of subjects with mean Hb 
level during the evaluation period defined as Week 28 until Week 52  ≥ 10.0 g/dL. 
• EU regulatory submission:  Hemoglobin (Hb) response, defined as mean Hb during Weeks 28 to 36 within the target range of 10.0 to 12.0 g/dL without having received rescue therapy within 6 weeks prior to and during this 8- week 
evaluation period.

 An increase from BL of ≥  15 mm H g diastolic 
blood pressure (dBP) and dBP > 100 mmHg 
o Change from BL in mean arterial pressure (MAP) to the MAP value averaged over Weeks 20 to 28 
Additional Efficacy Endpoints:  
Additional efficacy endpoints are described in the body of the 
protocol.  
Safety Assessments and Endpoints:  Study -specific safety will be assessed by evaluating the following:  
• Occurrence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and treatment emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs)  
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 36 • Adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and 
clinically significant changes in laboratory values from 
baseline  
• Vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, and clinical laboratory values. 
Safety interpretation will also be made based on analyses of composite endpoints derived from adjudicated events pooled across multiple studies in the roxadustat Phase 3 program. The members of an independent adjudication committee blinded to treatment assignment will adju dicate the following events in multiple Phase 3 
studies: 
 All cause death, MI, stroke, congestive heart failure requiring 
hospitalization, unstable angina requiring hospitalization, hypertensive emergency, DVT, pulmonary embolism, and vascular access throm bosis.  
Various region- specific pooled analyses of composites of these 
adjudicated events, pooled across multiple studies will be conducted. The analyses of the adjudicated events will be detailed in the region -
specific PSAPs.  
For US (FDA) Submission Only:   The primary safety endpoint in this study is the MACE (Major Adverse Cardiac Event) composite endpoint, defined as time to first occurrence of death from all causes, MI, or stroke, for the purpose of being pooled across multiple similar studies in the Phase 3 program. None of the individual studies are powered to meet the MACE primary safety endpoint individually. The pooled MACE analysis is only for purposes of supporting a US FDA regulatory filing of roxadustat.  
The above adjudicated safety events may also be used to support the 
pooled analyses of additional composite safety endpoints across multiple studies in the Phase 3 program, such as MACE+ (death, MI, stroke, congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization, and unstable angina requiring hospitalization), or a composite which consists of all of the adjudicated events.  
Statistical Methods:  Stratification:  
Up to 1200 subjects will be randomized via IWRS to receive roxadustat or epoetin alfa in an open- label manner in a 1:1  ratio.  
Randomization will be stratified by the following four factors: 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 37 • Mean qualifying screening hemoglobin (≤  10.5 vs. 
>10.5 g/dL) 
• History of CV, cerebrovascular, or thromboembolic diseases 
(yes vs. no) 
• Mean prescribed  weekly epoetin alfa dose (or, equivalent 
epoetin dose for nonepoetin subjects) in the 4 weeks prior to randomization (≤  150 vs. > 150 IU/kg/week)  
• Geographical region (US vs. Ex-US regions)  
Sample size determination:  
At least 600 subjects will be enrolle d in this study. During the course 
of this study, which is being conducted in parallel with other Phase 3 studies, up to 1200 subjects may be enrolled for safety evaluation  of 
roxadustat in comparison to epoetin alfa including adjudicated and prespecified safety events of interest (ie, all -cause death, MI , stroke, 
congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization, unstable angina requiring hospitalization, DVT, pulmonary embolism, vascular access thrombosis, and hypertensive emergency). The final number of patients to be enrolled will be based on the enrollment rate of other studies within the same indication, in order to optimize stopping these studies at comparable time frame  
With at least 600 subjects, the study will provide at least 99% power to demonst rate statistical noninferiority of roxadustat versus ESA in 
the primary endpoint for US (FDA) submission (ie, specifically, Hb change from baseline to the average level during the evaluation period defined as Week 28 until Week 52). 
The study will provide at least 99% power to demonstrate statistical 
noninferiority of roxadustat versus ESA in the primary endpoint outside of the United States (ie, specifically, Hb change from BL in the averaged Hb over Weeks 28 to 36).  
This assumes a difference (roxadustat minus ESA) of -0.30 g/dL, a 
noninferiority margin for this difference of 0.75 g/dL and a standard deviation of 1.25 g/dL.  
Analysis Sets For US regulatory submission, efficacy and safety analyses will be 
based on all subjects stratified by the protocol amendment, on subjects enrolled during the original protocol but before the amendment, and on subjects enrolled after the amendment separately.  
For EU regulatory submission, efficacy and safety analyses will be 
based on subjects enrolled during the original protocol before the 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 38 amendment s, as the subjects enrolled after the amendment s may be 
considered as a sub -study for EU regulatory purpose. 
The following analysis sets are defined and will be used for the 
statistical ana lysis:  
Intent to Treat (ITT) Population : The ITT population consists of all 
randomized subjects.  
Full Analysis Set (FAS):  The FAS consists of all randomized 
subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug and have at least one postdose Hb assessment. If treatment received 
differs from the randomized treatment, the randomized treatment arm will be used.  
Per-Protocol Set (PPS):  The PPS consists of all randomized 
subjects who received at least 8 weeks of study treatment, have at least one postdose Hb assessment and are without major protocol violations. 
Safety Analysis Set (SAF):  The SAF will consist of all randomized subje cts who received at least one dose of 
study medication. If treatment received for the duration of the study differs from the randomized treatment, the actual treatment arm will be used.  
Efficacy:  
Primary Hypothesis 
The primary efficacy endpoint for US (FDA) submission is defined 
as each subject’s Hb change from baseline to the average level during the evaluation period, defined as Weeks 28 to 52. The analysis will be based on the ITT Population.  
A Multiple Imputatio n Analysis of C ovariance ( MI-ANCOVA) 
model will be used. The model will contain terms for treatment arm, 
baseline Hb measurement, and randomization stratification factors except Screening Hb values (≤ 10.5 g/dL vs. > 10.5 g/dL). 
The primary efficacy analysi s will be based on the estimated 
difference between the two treatments throughout the evaluation period based on the MI -ANCOVA model. 
The primary efficacy endpoint for EU regulatory submission is defined as the Hb change from BL to the average Hb of Weeks 28 to 36, without having received rescue therapy within 6 weeks prior to and during this 8-week evaluation period and will be based on the 
PPS population . The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 39 estimated difference between the two treatments ov erall mean effects 
throughout the evaluation period based on the MMRM model.  
Secondary efficacy analyses are described in the body of the 
protocol  
Safety  
The Safety analyses will be performed using the Safety Analysis Set (SAF). Safety parameters include adverse events, SAEs, laboratory parameters, vital signs, ECG parameters, and PE 
The number and percentage of subjects reporting TEAEs and 
TESAEs in each treatment group will be tabulated. Descriptive statistics will be presented for laboratory, vital sig ns values and ECG 
parameters by visit and for the changes from BL to each visit.  
The CV safety assessment of roxadustat will also be based on pooled 
analysis of composites of adjudicated CV events pooled across multiple global Phase 3 clinical studies which includes this study, according to the regional pooled SAPs for meeting regional regulatory requirements.  
For the US (FDA) submission only: The primary safety endpoint in 
this study is the MACE (Major Adverse Cardiac Event) composite endpoint, defined as time to first occurrence of death from all causes, MI, or stroke, only for the purpose of being pooled across multiple similar studies in the Phase 3 program. None of the individual studies are powered to meet the MACE primary safety endpoint individually. The pooled MACE analysis is only for purposes of 
supporting a US FDA regulatory filing of roxadustat. 
Safety data and dosing decisions will be monitored on an ongoing 
basis. Ongoing review of safety data will be conducted by an independent DSMB. 
For each safety parameter, the last assessment made prior to the first 
dose of study medication will be used as the BL for all analyses of that safety parameter.  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the guidelines of Good Clinical Practice and the applicable regulatory requirement(s), including the archiving of essential documents. 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 40 2 BACKGROUND  
Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a key transcription factor that coordinates the body’s 
physiological response to changes in oxygen levels in the cellular environment ( Semenza, 2000 ). 
It induces the expression of erythropoietin (EPO) and the EPO receptor, as well as the expression of other proteins that promote iron absorption and recycling ( Peyssonnaux et al, 2008). The 
activity of HIF is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase (HIF- PH) enzymes 
(HIF -PHD1 to D3) . These enzymes target HIF for degradation.  
Roxadustat ( FG-4592/ ASP1517/ AZD9941) is an orally active novel small -molecule that 
inhibits these HIF -PH enzymes . By inhibiting HIF-PH, roxadustat stimulates erythropoiesis via 
the HIF pathway in a manner consistent with the body’s normal response to hypoxia. Its ability 
to stimulate erythropoiesis makes it a candida te for the treatment of anemia associated with 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with nondialysis-dependent (NDD-CKD) and dialysis-dependent (DD- CKD).  
2.1 Introduction   
2.1.1 Epidemiology of Chronic Kidney Disease and E nd-Stage Renal Disease 
Chronic kidney disease is a growing worldwide public health problem. It is associated with 
significant morbidity and mortality, yet is underdiagnosed and under treated . It is characterized 
by progressive loss of kidney function, resulting in premature death or renal replacement therapy (RRT) (k idney transplant or dialysis). 
The average prevalence of CKD, regardless of age, ranges between 5% to 11% in Europe and the all-cause mortality risk increases exponentially as CKD stages advance ( Tonelli et al., 2006). 
The prevalence of DD -CKD is 887 per million people in China (2011 Shanghai Dialysis Registry 
Report) and in the US, CKD affected 13% of the US adult population (~ 29 million adults) in 2007, and the prevalence is rapidly growing ( Coresh et al., 2007). In Europe, the average 
prevalence of CKD regardless of age lies between 5 and 11% ( Zoccali et al., 2010 ). 
The number of patients suffering from end- stage renal disease (ESRD) also continues to increase 
worldwide. The US has one of the highest prevalence rates of ESRD in the world: in 2010, the US had over 1700 patients with ESRD per million population, a 23% increase compared to 10 years before ( USRDS, 2011). In 2009 (point prevalence as of December 31st), there were 
approximately 570,000 patients with ESRD in the US, of whom 370,000 were receiving hemodialysis (HD), 27,000 were receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD), and 173,000 had a functioning kidney transplant ( USRDS,  2011). In recent years, those older than 75 years have 
been observed to have the highest incidence of treated ESRD (1735 per million populations in 2007, US by age and race/ethnicity). The adjusted ESRD incidence rates were 998 per million populations for African Americans, 396 per million population for Asians/Pacific Islanders, and 273 per million populations for whites in 2007 ( USRDS,  2009). In Europe, over the period 
1992–2005, the overall crude prevalence of RRT for patients with ESRD increased from 480 to 807 patients per million populations ( Zoccali et al., 2010).  
The average expected life expectancy of a dialysis patient is 5.9 years, compared to 16.4 years for a transplant patient, and 25.2 years for someone of comparable age in the general population (USRDS, 2009). The prevalence of ESRD is projected to grow to 774,000 by the year 2020 (USRDS, 2009). Data from selected countries in Europe indicate that the 5 -year mortality rates 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 41 in incident patients on RRT are 52% in all patients, and 21%, 32% and 73% for patients 0 to 14, 
15 to 64 and over 65 years of age, respectively ( Zoccali et al., 2010 ). 
2.1.2 Anemia Associated with Chronic Kidney Disease 
Anemia is a common complication in patients with CKD, and although its pathogenesis is multifactorial, the decreased production of EPO, a hormone produced primarily in the kidneys, is considered an important etiologic factor. The impaired ability of the body to absorb and utilize iron is likely a second etiologic factor.  
Anemia may present in the early stages of CKD and its prevalence increases as CKD progr esses. 
Anemia is present in 17% of patients with late Stage 3 disease; this increases to 25% in patients 
with Stage 4 disease, and to 49% in patients with Stage 5 disease who have not yet progressed to requiring dialysis ( Core sh et al., 2007; Go et al., 2004). Over 90% of patients undergoing dialysis 
are anemic. Half of all patients new to dialysis (50.1%) have hemoglobin (Hb) levels below 10 g/dL and approximately 28% have Hb levels below 9 g/dL ( USRDS, 2003). Some studies from 
Europe provide data on anemia rates in patients who have been under care of nephrologists. In 1999, Jungers prospectively studied 403 consecutive ambulatory predialysis patients and found that 60% of patients with a creatinine clearance of < 20 ml/min/1.73 m2 were anemic (Hb < 11 g/dL) ( Jungers et al., 2002). Between 2003 and 2005, Thilly studied predialysis anemia care in 
6271 incident dialysis patients. The average level of predialysis Hb was 10.3 g/dl, and 63.6% of the patients had a Hb value lower than 11 g/dl ( Thilly et al., 2008).  
The clinical consequences of anemia in patients with CKD have been studied extensively. Because the main impact of anemia on organ function is reduced oxygen delivery to tissues, it affects almost every organ system.  
Anemia is associated with excess morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD and ESRD. In 
patients with CKD, the severity of anemia correlates  directly with the risk of hospitalization, 
cardiovascular (CV) disease, and death ( Collins et al., 1998). Anemia contributes to eccentric left 
ventricular hypertrophy and maladaptive remodeling of the left ventricle. Patient s with the 
lowest Hb have worse outcomes, as was discussed in the post hoc analysis of mortality by Hb quintiles for the Normal Hematocrit and Correction of Hb and Outcomes in Renal Insufficiency (CHOIR) study in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) briefing document for the October 2007 Cardiovascular and Renal Advisory Committee ( Unger, 2007). Similar observations are 
found in the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) mortality data stratified by Hb. All-cause mortality stratified by Hb (between the years of 1993 to 1996) indicated significantly higher first -year death rates in patients with Hb levels < 9 g/dL, compared to 11 to 12 g/dL. This 
trend continued to worsen, as reflected in USRDS data collected between 1998 1999 where the death rate rose by ~75% compared to the 1993 to 1996 period ( USRDS, 2000; USRDS, 2002). 
This increase coincides with the introduction of the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines in 1997. The relative risk of all-cause mortality for patients with Hb < 9 g/dL is twice that of patients with Hb > 12 g/dL ( USRDS, 2002). The relative risk ratio of CV 
hospitalization increases significantly to 1.26 in patients with Hb levels <9 g/dL compared to those with Hb at 11 to 12 g/dL ( USRDS, 2001).  
Multiple studies have suggest ed that treatment of anemia reduces the need for blood transfusions 
and improves health- related qual ity of life (HRQoL) (NKF K/DOQI, 2007 ).   
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 42 2.2 Current standard of care for CKD or DD- CKD Anemia  
Today, therapy with erythropoiesis- stimulating agents (ESAs) is a major alternative to 
transfusion in managing anemia associated with CKD. For those not resistant to ESAs, parenteral 
administration of exogenous recombinant human EPO (epoetin alfa or beta) or pegylated analogues has been a widely accepted approach for the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD (Winearls et al., 1986; Eschbach et al., 1987; Eschbach et al.,1989a , Eschbach et al. 1989b), 
despite the documented safety risks. These safety risks include hypertension, thrombosis, and cerebrovascular events which may be associated with supraphysiologic plasma EPO levels frequently observed with ESA therapy. Anemic patients with CKD or ESRD will require life-long treatment with these agents.  
Although the treatment of anemia in CKD and ESRD is thought to contribute positively to a 
patient’s quality of life, several studies in subjects with ESRD and NDD-CKD have shown higher mortality or trends in that direction in the higher-dosed ESA -treated cohorts when the 
protocol objective was to treat one of the cohorts to high, almost normal target Hb levels (Besarab et al., 1998; Drueke et al., 2006; Singh et al., 2006). An ESA dose relationship to 
mortality has been reported in a review of the USRDS database ( Zhang et al., 2004) of ESRD 
patients who received higher ESA doses, particularly in those more anemic (ie, Hb < 11 g/dL). The FDA has recognized these excess morbidity and mortality risks ( FDA, 2007). Updated 
product labeling for the approved ESAs in 2007 include a boxed warning of greater risk of death and CV events when ESAs are administered to target high Hb concentr ations (≥ 13.5 g/dL) 
compared with lower Hb targets. The FDA also acknowledged the potential off- target effect of 
ESAs contributing to excess mortality due to CV events and thrombosis ( Unger, 2010). The 
currently approved ESA labeling directs prescribers to target Hb levels of 10 to 11 g/dL in the US and 10 to 12 g/dL outside the US. The literature on this topic, including meta- analyses, 
supports the view that the AEs associated with ESAs are typically observed when high doses a re 
administered ( Zhang et al., 2004; Unger, 2007; Szczech, 2008; Fishbane and Beserab, 2007; 
Besarab et al., 2009). Posthoc analyses of three major RCTs, ( Kilpatrick et al., 2008; 
Szczech,  2008; Solomon et al., 2010) NHCT, CHOIR, and TREAT, indicates that outcomes correlate with “achieved” and not “target” Hb levels . 
Additionally, some patients are hyporesponsive to ESA therapy. A significant proportion (~17%) of DD -CKD patients require stable ESA dosing at 2 to 6 times the median seen in the entire 
CKD pop ulation (150 to 450 U/kg of IV epoetin TIW). This “hyporesponder” patient population 
accounts for approximately 50% of epoetin alfa consumption in the US ( Besarab  et al., 2009). 
This is a significant economic burden, and as noted above, higher doses of ESAs have been associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality ( Zhang et al., 2004; Unger, 2007; 
Szczech, 2008). Thus, this patient population has the greatest need for an effective and safe therapy for anemia. In turn, the increasing perception that high ESA dosing is associated with significant risk, especially in patients not achieving target, is expected to lead to lower ESA dosing and an associated higher prevalence of patients with low Hb levels. In December of 2007, 2.1% of patients had Hb levels < 9 g/dL, 7% had Hb levels < 10 g/dL, and 21.6% did not reach 11 g/dL, while 34.8% were 11 to 12 g/dL ( USRDS, 2009). Hb levels < 11 g/dL in this population 
are associated with increased mortality and hospitalization rates, and failure to achieve a Hb level > 11 g/dL is a prognostic indicator of poor outcomes ( Ma, 1999; Regidor, 2006). In patients 
with persistently low Hb levels, mortality risk is strongly associated with the patient's ability to achieve a hematopoietic response ( Bradbury, 2009).  
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 43 Additionally, ESA therapy for anemia in patients with ESRD on HD usually requires 
concomitant IV iron supplementation to avoid functional iron deficiency and epoetin dose escalation; however; IV iron use is not without risk. However, as reported by the USRDS (USRDS, 2013), administration of IV iron is at an all-time high. Among patients on HD, the 
transfusion rate, at 2.7% to 2.9% at the beginning of 2010, reached 3.3–3.8 percent in the first six months of 2012. Among patients on PD, the rate has increased from 2.3–2.9 to 3.0–3.9.  
There is currently an unmet medical need for an oral treatment that can correct anemia in patients 
with NDD- CKD and DD -CKD while avoiding supraphysiologic levels of circulating plasma 
EPO levels.  
Roxadustat is an oral medication that could potentially deliver effective treatment for CKD -
related anemia with less need for IV iron supplementation and without producing 
supraphysiologic levels of circulating EPO, which may translate into an improved safety profile. Roxadustat is being evaluated as a potential alternative treatment for anemia in subjects with NDD- CKD and DD- CKD.  
2.3 Mechanism of Action of Roxadustat  
Virtually all tissu es depend on a sufficient supply of oxygen for survival. Lack of oxygen 
associated with hypoxic, ischemic, and anemic conditions triggers a series of homeostatic responses ( Figure 1 ). Hypoxia-inducible factor is a transcription factor that is believed to be the 
key element in the body’s oxygen sensing mechanism ( Semenza, 2000). Hypoxia-inducible 
factor regulates expression of genes that mo dulate both the acute and chronic response to 
hypoxia, and HIF-responsive genes regulate processes as diverse as erythropoiesis, iron metabolism, oxidation, cellular metabolism, glycolysis, vasculogenesis, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. Chronic hypoxia and intermittent hypoxia induce different sets of genes associated with HIF transcriptional activity ( Fan et al., 2005). Hypoxia- inducible factor is a 
heterodimeric transcription factor family comprising three oxygen- sensiti ve isoforms (HIF 1 α, 
HIF-2α and HIF-3α ), and a constitutively expressed HIF-1β  subunit, with each heterodimeric 
isoform responsible for the induction of specific sets of genes ( Greijer et al.,2005; 
Hu et  al., 2003). For example, HIF-1 α has been shown to regulate vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) expression ( Gray et al., 2005; Buchler et al., 2003), while HIF 2 α is critical for 
the induction of the EPO gene and erythropoiesis ( Warnecke et al., 2004; 
Scortegagna et al., 2005).

Hypoxia-inducible factor target genes are expressed when the active heterodimer binds to a 
conserved DNA motif found within all HIF target genes, termed the hypoxia response element, and in cooperation with other co- activators initiates de novo transcription. One of the most 
sensitive and well -studied HIF-responsive genes is the EPO gene. Increased transcription of the 
EPO gene leads to increased circulating levels of EPO, which acts at sites of erythropoiesis to enhance the differentiation and proliferation of red blood cell ( RBC) precursors.  
Although HIF- α isoforms are constitutively produced, their accumulation under normoxic 
conditions is prevented by recruitment and binding by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, 
which targets HIF -α isoforms for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The 
molecular mechanism for oxygen-dependent degradation of HIF- α is based on the hydroxylation 
of specific proline residues, as catalyzed by a family of HIF -PHs that utilize molecular oxygen as 
the substrate for hydroxylation. Thus, HIF- PH constitutes the body’s main oxygen sensor by 
regulating the prevalence and activity of nuclear HIF protein. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF 
PHs are inactive and lead to initiation of the HIF -responsive transcriptional cascade 
(Wang  et al., 1995; Semenza, 1998). 
Roxadustat is a potent and reversible hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI) that transiently induces HIF stabilization and leads to a functional HIF transcriptional 
response that mimics the erythropoietic response associated with exposure of humans to 
intermittent hypoxia. HIF induces expression of not only EPO, but also the EPO receptor and proteins that promote iron absorption and recycling from the macrophage iron storage system (Peyssonnaux et al., 2008). Thus, roxadustat pharmacologically stimulates erythropoiesis via the 
HIF pathway and in a manner consistent with the body’s normal homeostatic response to anemia, but under normoxic conditions. In contrast to the classical paradigm, suggesting that anemia in CKD patients is caused by the inability of these patients to produce EPO, results of a study of 

Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 45 roxadustat treatment of CKD subjects not requiring dialysis (Study FGCL-SM4592-017) suggest 
that the kidneys and other sites of EPO production in this patient population retain the ability to produce sufficient EPO for robust erythropoiesis.  
Roxadustat also has the potential to effectively treat anemia caused by inflammation-induced 
functional iron deficiency, which are typically hyporesponsive to ESAs. In these conditions, iron availability for erythropoiesis is reduced due to a number of inflammatory mediators . Because 
HIF-PHIs such as roxadustat  alter expression not only of the EPO gene but also of genes 
regulating iron metabolism, it is postulated that roxadustat may be effective in treating these anemias as well ( Langsetmo et al., 2005).  
Chronic hypoxia and intermittent hypoxia induce different sets of genes associated with HIF transcriptional activity, presumably because intermittent stimulation allows the restoration of HIF degradation, turnover, and inactivation. Transient activation of HIF thereby precludes sustained gene expression and the induction of genes that are expressed late after HIF activation, as well as expression of additional genes that are secondary to activation of HIF- dependent 
genes . Both nonclini cal and clinical studies of roxadustat have successfully used the intermittent 
dosing paradigm to induce selective erythropoiesis and to optimize the Hb dose response. Furthermore, roxadustat w as selected for development over other HIF -PHI candidate molecules 
based on an optimal biodistribution profile that enhances its selective actions. The specific tissues wher e roxadustat  enters the cytoplasm and triggers gene expression reside in the main 
target organs for erythropoiesis:  the kidney (EPO production), the bone marrow (increase in EPO receptors), the duodenum (transepithelial iron transport), and the liver (EPO production, transferrin production, and down-regulation of hepcidin production); roxadustat distributes preferentially to these organs. 
The physiologic mechanisms underlying the effects of roxadustat on erythropoiesis are distinct 
from that of ESAs, and these differences result in several potential advantages over ESAs beyond the convenience of oral therapy. These potential advantages include:  
• Increase in the number of EPO receptors in the bone marrow 
• Improved iron metabolism and bioavailability  
• Effective erythropoiesis at nonsupraphysiologic plasma EPO levels (10- to 20-fold lower 
than with parenteral ESA therapy) 
• Absence of hypertensive effect  
• Effective erythropoiesis in the presence of inflammation  
• Mitigation of thromboembolic risk  
• Improvement in lipid profile  
2.4 Clinical Experience with Roxadustat  
Roxadustat is currently being studied in DD- CKD and NDD- CKD subjects with anemia. As of 
7 September 2013, a total of 1190 subjects with CKD and healthy subjects have been enrolled in 18 completed (12 Phase 1 and 6 Phase 2) and 6 ongoing studies in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Information from these studies is provided below and in the most recent Investigator’s 
Brochure. In these studies, a total of 969 subjects have received roxadustat, comprising 377 healthy subjects, 294 subjects with NDD-CKD, and 298subjects with  DD- CKD.  
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 46 Subjects with CKD have received up to 24 weeks of roxadustat in  doses of up to 3.0 mg/kg. In 
completed Phase 1 studies, healthy volunteers received single doses of roxadustat up to 4.0 
mg/kg and repeat doses up to 3.75 mg/kg three times a week for 4 weeks. In a completed 
thorough QT study in healthy volunteers, single doses up to 5 mg/kg were administered, without evidence of QT prolongation. 
Of the 6 P hase 2 studies completed, 3 were in subjects with ESRD on dialysis treatment. 
Roxadustat treatment in dialysis patients ranging from 6 weeks to 19 weeks in the P hase 2 
studies was well tolerated . Roxadustat has been found to be effective in correcting anemia in 
incident subjects on HD and PD , as well as in maintaining Hb levels in subjects on HD whose 
Hb levels were maintained with epoetin alfa, and generally in the absence of IV iron 
supplementation. Oral iron supplementation was found as effective as IV iron when correcting anemia with roxadustat in incident- dialysis  patients.  
The clinical data collected thus far suggest that roxadustat is generally safe and well tolerated in healthy adult subjects, and in dialysis and nondialysis CKD subjects with anemia who have been treated in the completed and ongoing studies. 
2.4.1 Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharma codynamics  of roxadustat were characterized in studies 
in healthy volunteers and in dialysis and nondialysis CKD subjects . Roxadustat showed 
generally dose proportional PK (except at the lowest dose of 0.3 mg/kg); t
1/2 was 12 to 14 hours 
in healthy volunteers, and 15 to 19 hours in dialysis subjects (after a single 1 and 2 mg/kg dose). 
The exposure was higher in dialysis patients compared to healthy volunteers. Roxadustat can be administered before or after dialysis, since the PK  of roxadustat was not signi ficantly altered 
when administered prior to the start of dialysis compared with after dialysis (Study FGCL -4592-039). 
A relative bioavailability study was  conducted in 24 healthy volunteers comparing capsule 
formulation, which was used in Phase 1  and Phase 2 studies, with tablet formulation, which was 
developed for Phase 3 . The study demonstrated bioequivalence to bridge the two formulation s. 
With an intermittent dose regimen (once weekly [QW], twice week ly [BIW[ or three times a 
week [TIW]), no or limited accumulation in mean area under the concentration curve ( AUC ) or 
maximum concentration (C
max) was observed . Furthermore, no evidence was found for time-
dependent PK (no auto-induction or inhibition). Roxadustat is highly protein bound and the PK of roxadustat is not affected by dialysis. Metabolites found in urine suggested Phase 2 metabolism as the major metabolic pathway . In plasma, parent roxadustat is the main 
component. The inhibitory potential of roxadustat on cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes, based 
on in- vitro studies is limited, and the lowest inhibition constant ( Ki) value was observed for CYP 
2C8 (16 μM) . In a clinical drug-drug interaction study with rosiglitazone, a probe drug for CYP 
2C8, roxadustat did not show any inhibitory potential on CYP 2C8 in vivo. 
In healthy adult male volunteers (Study FGCL-SM4592-016), roxadustat administered orally as a 
single dose up to 4.0 mg/kg, and QW, BIW or TIW for 4 weeks at doses up to 3.75 mg/kg, was 
pharmacodynamically active as evidenced by dose-dependent transient increases in endogenous EPO (starting from single doses of 0.3 mg/kg), increases in reticulocytes (starting from doses of 2 mg/kg), and Hb responses (starting at 3 mg/kg). The mean peak level of plasma EP O following 
the Day 26 dose of 2.0 mg/kg TIW (the high therapeutic dose studied) was 326.3 ± 197.0 mIU/mL.  
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 47 In pharmacodynamic studies conducted with roxadustat in CKD subjects not on dialysis (Study 
FGCL -4592-017), the mean maximum EPO increase from baseline ranged from 82-443 mIU/mL 
and 492-554 mIU/mL after a single 1 and 2 mg/kg dose, respectively. Results from PK studies in subjects on HD (Study FGCL-4592-039 in the US and Study CL-1517-203 in Japan ) showed 
similarity in PK and pharmacodynamics of roxadu stat in Caucasians and Japanese subjects with 
ESRD, and the timing of roxadustat dosing relative to dialysis (given before or after dialysis) did not impact the PK profile . Also, comparable dose- dependent increases in EPO levels were 
observed with both pre  and postdialysis dosing. These increases in endogenous EPO (eEPO) 
were transient, peaked at around 10 hours postdose with eEPO levels returning to BL  in 24 to 48 
hrs. The m agnitude of this transient increase in plasma eEPO levels was modest and the peak 
plasma eEPO were within physiologic range. 
In contrast, EPO levels associated with therapeutic ESA dosing range from 1,500 to over 
10,000 mIU/mL ( Besarab et al., 2009). In a clinical study with dialysis subjects, the reported 
mean administered individual ESA dose was 8,000 IU, which would correspond to plasma EPO C
max levels exceeding 3,000 mIU/mL ( Fishbane and Bes arab, 2007). This is approximately 10-
fold higher than the physiologic range. 
2.4.2 Efficacy  
As of 7 September 2013, 700 subjects with NDD- CKD and DD- CKD have participated in the 
Phase 2 clinical development program. This program includes 6 completed studies. Th ree of 
these studies have been in NDD-CKD subjects (2 US, 1 in China), and three have been in 
subjects with DD -CKD (1 US; 1 US, Asia, Russia; 1 China). For details  about dialysis , please 
see the Investigator ’s Brochure.  
2.4.2.1 Studies in NDD -CKD subjects  
Data from a 4 -week dose ranging study in anemic CKD subjects not on dialysis (Study 
FGCL -SM4592-017) showed that roxadustat promotes erythropoiesis at lower doses in CKD 
subjects than in healthy volunteers. With roxadustat 0.7 mg/kg TIW dosing, mean Hb increased by 1.0 g/dL over a 6-week period in anemic CKD subjects who completed 4 weeks of dosing; more robust mean Hb increases of 2.0 to 2.3 g/dL occurred at roxadustat doses of 1.5 and 2.0 mg/kg TIW, respectively. Hemoglobin responder (Hb increase of ≥  1.0 g/dL) rates were 62%, 
60%, 91%, and 100% in the roxadustat 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/kg TIW cohorts, respectively. The Hb responses were also robust at higher roxadustat doses (1.5 to 2.0 mg/kg) in the BIW dosing groups. With the additional criterion that Hb achieve a level of ≥  11 g/dL as well as 
increasing by ≥  1.0 g/dL, the Hb responder rate with roxadustat 2.0 mg/kg was 89% and 91% in 
with BIW and TIW dosing, respectively. The rapid rates of rise in Hb with roxadustat treatment were not accompanied by elevations in blood pressure (BP), as has been reported with ESA treatment ( Eschbach et al., 1989). 
Data from 16 - to 24- week treatment Phase 2 b study in CKD subjects not on dialysis (Study 
FGCL -4592-041) showed that absolute and weight-based doses of roxadustat , administered TIW 
and BIW, effectively corrected Hb levels to a Hb target of 11 g/dL (range of 11-13 g/dL in 96 subjects and 10.5-12.0 g/dL in 48 subjects). Dose -response trends suggested that starting doses 
of 1.0 to 1.6 mg/kg roxadustat administered TIW are appropriate to correct Hb levels during 4 
weeks of treatment in nondialysis CKD subjects . Roxadustat was also effective in maintaining 
Hb level following anemia correction .

FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 48 2.4.2.2 Studies in DD -CKD subjects:  
Data from a 12 -week study in incident- dialysis  (48 HD and 12 PD) subjects (Study FGCL-4592-
053), using similar ly tiered, weight-based doses as Study FGCL-4592-041 demonstrated  
increases in mean Hb of approximately 2 g/dL after 6 weeks of treatment . Subjects were 
randomized to receive either no iron, oral iron or IV iron. The Hb responses were 
indistinguishable between the oral and IV iron arms; subjects in the no iron arm had a similar Hb response during the first 8 weeks of treatment, with plateauing during the last 4 weeks of treatment, sugges ting that with long -term roxadustat treatment, iron supplementation may be 
necessary, however, oral iron appears to be as effective as IV iron, and is recommended as the first-line treatment in Phase 3 . Starting roxadustat doses between 1.0 and 1.6 mg/kg appeared 
adequate to correct Hb in these subjects . In addition to Hb response, in this study, statistically 
significant (p< 0.001) improvements of 5% to 10% overall average in the SF -36 Phys ical 
Functioning, Role physical, and Vitality scores, as well as in the FACT -An anemia and total 
scores were noted in the roxadustat- treated subjects . Significantly, these improvements were 
more pronounced (33% on average and up to 100%) in subjects with l ow BL  scores (< 35), and 
improvement was time -dependent. Also, in this study, roxadustat transiently lowered total 
cholesterol by about 20 mg/dL on average. Importantly, highly significant LDL cholesterol reduction was also observed.  
Data from a 6 - and 19-week treatment study in US ESRD subjects on dialysis (Study 
FGCL -4592-040) showed the feasibility of converting subjects from a stable ESA dose to 
roxadustat. In the 6-week dose range portion of this conversion study in subjects on HD, a dose 
relationship was observed for Hb response. In subjects dosed with roxadustat at 1 mg/kg, the Hb response was comparable to that in the epoetin alfa  control group, which had a small decline 
from baseline in Hb levels and a lower percentage of Hb responders than did subjects receiving the higher doses of roxadustat. In the 1.5 mg/kg and 2.0 mg/kg dose arms, roxadustat produced an average increase in Hb of 0.9 and 0.7 g/dL from baseline Hb, respectively, and was associated with a 78% to  80% response r ate (ie, more than twice that in the epoetin alfa arm [33%]). In the 
19-week portion of the study, Hb maintenance was durable and noninferior to epoetin alfa in the roxadustat treatment arms (combined) over a 19-week period. The roxadustat dose requirement for Hb maintenance was mostly between 0.7 mg/kg to 2.0 mg/kg in normoresponder subjects, with occasional subjects requiring doses up to 3.0 mg/kg TIW. R oxadustat treatment also 
resulted in increased levels of serum iron at the End of Treatment ( EOT ) compared with baseline 
in the 6- week treatment arms, whereas serum iron levels decreased from baseline in subjects 
treated with epoetin alfa. Reticulocyte Hb content ( CHr) was better maintained in the pooled 
roxadustat treatment arm than in the pooled epoetin alfa arm, suggesting that functional iron deficiency does not occur when treating with roxadustat unaccompanied by IV iron. Serum hepcidin was reversibly suppressed during roxadustat treatment. In addition, total cholesterol levels decreased during the course of treatment in subjects treated with roxadustat, but were unchanged in epoetin alfa- treated subjects . Following discontinuation of roxadustat dosing, total 
choles terol levels returned to BL  at post- treatment  follow-up. 
Data from a Phase 2 clinical trial in China (FGCL -4592-048), in DD-CKD subjects, roxadustat 
was found effective for maintaining Hb for 6 weeks. Hemoglobin correction and maintenance 
was dose- dependen t. Roxadustat also transiently lowered total and LDL-cholesterol by about 20 
mg/dL on average. Serum iron levels were maintained and total iron binding capacity ( TIBC ) 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 49 increased in roxadustat-treated subjects compared to subjects randomized to continue epo etin 
alfa. Other serum iron parameters were not significantly different between the treatment arms .  
2.4.2.3 Ongoing Studies  
Data from an ongoing open-label extension study (Study FGCL-4592-059, to which some 
subjects from Studies FGCL-4592-041 and FGCL-4592-040 rolled over) further shows durability of roxadustat effect in maintaining Hb levels in CKD patients over 52 to 76 week treatment as of 07 September 2013. 
2.4.3 Safety  (for detailed  current safety information please refer to the Investigator’s 
Brochure) 
The overall frequency and type of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and treatment-
emergent serious adverse events ( TESAEs) observed in these clinical studies reflect events that 
would be expected to occur in CKD subjects with multiple co- morbiditie s and on a number of 
concomitant medications . Safety analyses did not reveal any association between the rates of 
occurrence of CV events with roxadustat, or any effect on adverse event ( AE) rates related to 
either increasing Hb levels or on the rate of change of Hb levels.  As of 7 September 2013, a total of 969 subjects have been exposed to roxadustat in the clinical 
development program, comprising 377 healthy subjects, 294 NDD-CKD subjects, and 298 DD-CKD subjects . In the healthy subject trials, most subjects were male as enrollment in these trials 
was generally restricted to men . In the NDD -CKD and DD-CKD studies roughly half of the 
subjects were male. Most of the healthy subjects were Asian or Caucasian, reflecting the countries where these studies were conducted (Europe, United Kingdom, US, China, and Japan). Most NDD- CKD and DD- CKD subjects were either Caucasian or African -American, as most 
trials for which demographic data are pooled were conducted in the U.S. or Eastern Europe. In 
general, the most commonly reported AEs (≥ 4% and ≥  1% above placebo rate) in healthy 
volunteers were headache and dizziness . The most commonly reported AEs (≥  5%) in CKD 
patients not on dialysis were diarrhea, nausea, urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis, peripheral edema, hyperkalemia, headache, and hypertension (none were ≥  8%).  The most commonly 
reported AEs (≥  3%) in CKD patients on dialysis were diarrhea, nausea, hypertension, and upper 
respiratory tract infection (none were ≥  5%). Adverse even t rates of hypertension (1% in Study 
FGCL -SM4592-017and 7.6% in Study FGCL-4592-041) and thrombosis (overall incidence 
< 1%), compare favorably with the rates reported in published ESA studies in similar patient populations ( Krapf and Hulter, 2009; Fishbane and Besarab, 2007). No safety risks were 
associated with rate of rise of Hb levels or with achieving a Hb l evel above 11 g/dL using 
roxadustat. Study FGCL-4592-041 subjects achieved Hb> 11 g/dL in > 50% of exposure time during study, and there were no CV  safety events (death, myocardial infarction [ MI], stroke, 
unstable angina, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, or hospitalization for arrhythmias) reported while Hb >11  g/dL during treatment of roxadustat.  
Supratherapeutic doses of roxadustat in healthy volunteers were associated with an increased frequency of mild to moderate musculoskeletal pain and headaches, tachycardia, and less commonly, low BP. These findings have not been observed at the usual therapeutic dose range in Phase 2 studies in the target populations. In CKD subjects, the observed changes in heart rate (HR) and BP  were in general within the normal variations of daily living. 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 50 Cumulatively, five TESAEs of pancreatitis have been reported during roxadustat clinical studies. 
The pancreatitis for three subjects was associated with cholelithiasis or biliary sludge, confirmed 
by radiological imaging; all three subjects underwent cholecystectomy with complete resolution postoperatively . One subject was found to have a pancreatic duct stricture. One of the five 
TESAEs of acute pancreatitis was considered by the investigator to be possibly related to roxadustat. However, the causality was assessed as unrelated to stu dy drug by the sponsor after 
investigations revealed the presence of multiple risk factors for pancreatitis, including a long history of cigarette smoking, diabetes, hyperparathyroidism, and use of vicodin and lisinopril. Of note, approximately 28 months after the last dose of roxadustat, the subject was hospitalized with another episode of acute pancreatitis . Additional information regarding this subject is available 
in the Investigator ’s Brochure.  
Of note, cholelithiasis is reported to be more common in CKD patients compared to the general population, with a prevalence as high as 20% (Li Vecchi, 2003; Gladziwa, 1993). Furthermore, a higher incidence of pancreatitis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hence CKD, has been well described in the literature. No increased cancer risk has been noted with roxadustat 
treatment; however, the study program was not powered to detect absence of cancer risk. 
Liver parameters were monito red closely throughout the roxadustat clinical development 
program. Increases in liver parameters were infrequently seen, and were generally mild and 
transient in nature. No cases of Hy’s Law were observed throughout the program. An 
independent data and safety monitoring committee concluded that there was no concern for 
hepatotoxicity with roxadustat. Based on the safety data collected to date, roxadustat is generally well tolerated and has an acceptable safety profile that supports its further development.  
In summary, the cumulative safety data have not identified major risks related to roxadustat. At 
therapeutic doses, roxadustat is well tolerated by healthy subjects and subjects with CKD . 
Potential additional benefits of roxadustat compared to ESAs for t he treatment of NDD -CKD 
and DD-CKD anemia include efficacy without the need for IV iron supplementation, and a favorable change in lipid profile.  
Taking into account the general measures taken to minimize risk to subjects participating in the 
Phase 3 clinical trials, the anticipated benefits of treating the anemia associated with CKD in subjects on dialysis and not on dialysis, the data support conduct of Phase 3 trials. 
2.5 Summary 
In summary, roxadustat is an orally active HIF -PHI with potent erythropoietic effects . 
Intermittent dosing of roxadustat results in transient activation of HIF, intermittent induction of endogenous, physiologic-range EPO, and dose-dependent erythropoiesis, suggests a coordinated mechanism of erythropoiesis that is different from ESA therapy, including beneficial effects on iron handling. The clinical data collected thus far suggest that roxadustat is generally safe and well tolerated in healthy adult subjects, and in dialysis and nondialysis CKD subjects who have been enrolled and treated in completed and ongoing clinical studies. 
2.6 Roxadustat  Dose Rationale  
Starting doses of roxadustat were studied in three ways in the Phase 2 program: using a strict weight-based dosing approach that was useful in the proof of concept stage; using a tiered weight- based approach where a subject’s starting dose was selected based on categorizing the 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 51 subject’s body weight as low (45 to 60 kg), medium (> 60 to 90 kg), or heavy (> 90 to 140 kg); 
and using an absolute starting dose regardless of body weight.  
In a Phase 2 conversion-maintenance study in dialysis subjects (Study FGCL-4592-040), dose 
evaluation was performed to determine a suitable conversion method from epoetin to roxadustat. 
In this study, the dose response to maintain Hb levels was observed to be related to the ratio of the patient’s baseline epoetin alfa dose requirement to the roxadustat dose administered, and not 
related to the roxadustat dose administered per body weight. Two methods of modeling of dose relationship between roxadustat and baseline stable epoetin dose yielded dose ratios for epoetin (U): roxadustat (mg) dose conversion between 17 (for the lowest epoetin dose quartile) and 50 
(for the highest quartile). 
For this  conversion-maintenance study of stable dialysis subjects  converting from stable doses of 
epoetin at baseline to roxadustat, t he starting roxadustat dose will be determined using this  dose 
conversion algorithm ( Table 1).

b Starting dose will be one step higher if the mean Hb at randomization is < 1 0 g/dL   
c Ratio of epoetin weekly dose in I U/week to roxadustat dose in mg/week.  
Notes:  The r oxadustat  dose steps are 20, 40, 50, 70, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, and 400 mg  
Using these dose tiers, most patients are expected to be in the medium dose tier, requiring an 
epoetin: roxadustat ratio  between 18 and 36, compatible with the dose relationship data derived 
from the Phase 2 study in a similar patient population (Study FGCL-4592-040).  
In this study, the initial dose of roxadustat will be determined by the subject’s average prescribed 
ESA dose in the last 4 weeks prior to randomization if on epoetin or darbepoetin (8 weeks if on 
Mircera®). 
Using the conversion table ( Table 1), in this study, subjects will receive starting roxadustat doses 
of 70 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, or 200 mg . If the mean screening Hb value at randomization is < 10 
g/dL, the starting roxadustat dose will be increased by one dose step. If the converted initial dose 
exceeds the maximum dose of 3.0 mg/kg/dose then the lower dose step should be chosen as the initial dose . Roxadustat doses will be administered at a frequency of TIW.  
The completed Phase 2  studies evaluated the need for dose adjustments for both Hb c orrection  
and Hb m aintenance. Dose adjustments were allowed at regular 4 -week intervals to maintain, 
increase, or decrease the dose according to pre specified rules . Prespecified dosing steps were 
used to correct and maintain Hb levels within treatment thresholds based on absolute Hb le vels 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 52 and change of Hb in the previous 4 weeks. Additional rules for dose adjustment were provided to 
minimize excessive hematopoiesis . These dose adjustment rules were successful in Hb correction 
and Hb maintenance and will be adopted in this study with minor modifications. Roxadustat subjects will follow the dose adjustments guidelines as outlined in  Appendix 2.  
Subjects randomized to roxadustat will take doses TIW for the entire duration of the Treatment Period. I f a subject requires < 20 mg TIW (ie, < 60 mg per week) to maintain a Hb level of 
approximately 11 g/dL, the dosing frequency should be reduced in a step -wise fashion  e.g. TIW 
to BIW , BIW to  QW , QW to Q-2 Week  etc. 
Maximum Dose for Roxadustat 
The maximum allowed roxadustat dose in this study is set at 400 mg or 3.0 mg/kg/dose (based 
on dry weight in subjects on HD and normal weight subjects on PD), whichever is lower. The highest dose tested in healthy subjects is 5 mg/kg single dose and 3.75 mg/kg TIW. The doses were safe and well tolerated with transient dose-dependent HR  increases observed . No maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) was reached in the clinical development of roxadustat based on the observed pharmacodynamic response (plasma EPO levels) and the predicted relation between EPO levels and Hb response; therefore exploration of higher doses was not deemed necessary. Plasma EPO levels increased in a supralinear manner with increasing roxadustat doses. It is expected that the majority of the subjects will show adequate Hb response at substantially lower doses than the maximum allowed dose. This study will provide sufficient data on the efficacy and safety of long term treatment of anemia with roxadusta t in ESRD subjects on stable dialysis.  
Prescribed  dose must not exceed the maximum allowable dose of 3.0 mg/kg/dose or 400 mg per 
dose, whichever is lower. For dose adjustment purposes, post-dialysis weight (dry-weight) should be used. If the post- dialysis  weight of the current visit is not available  at the time of dose 
adjustment, post-dialysis weight of the prior dialysis session or last recorded post- dialysis weight 
may be used.  
2.7 Risks/Benefits of Roxadustat  Treatment 
The primary benefit of roxadustat is the c orrection  of anemia, including the relief of associated 
signs and symptoms and an increased quality of life. Roxadustat is expected to be at least as safe as ESAs, and the current data suggest that CV  risk may be lower than with ESAs.  
A pre specified dose adjustment algorithm will be used during the Treatment Period  to maintain a 
Hb level of approximately  11 g/dL, while closely monitoring the rate of rise of Hb and Hb levels  
(Appendix 2). In the event of excessive rate of rise  or excessive Hb levels, the dose may be 
adjusted or held  at any time according to  the guidelines described in Appendix 2. 
If there are clinical concerns for a subject’s high Hb levels, the investigator may decide to perform a therapeutic phlebotomy in addition to dose hold. Adverse and serious adverse events, and laboratory parameters including electrolytes, liver enzymes, and iron indices, will be closely monitored to ensure the safety of treatment with roxadustat and epoetin alfa. An independent expert panel will assess and  adjudicate pre specified CV , cerebrovascular , and thromboembolic 
events . In addition, an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will perform 
regular, periodic assessments of safety data (at least every 6 months or twice per calendar year while  the trial is ongoing) to detect any potential safety signals that may arise during the study 
and advise the Sponsor accordingly.

FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 53 Based on the clinical and nonclinical trial results to date, it is anticipated that orally administered 
roxadustat will be co mparable in efficacy to marketed parenteral ESA products in the treatment 
of anemia of CKD, with an acceptable safety profile. Roxadustat may offer a valuable alternative to the current treatment options in the management of anemia of CKD.

• Adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and clinically significant changes in laboratory values from baseline  
• Vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, and clinical laboratory values.  
Safety interpretation will also be made based on analyses of composite endpoints derived from adjudicated events pooled across multiple studies in the roxadustat Phase 3 program. The members of an independent adjudication committee blinded to treatment assignment will adjudicate the following events in multiple Phase 3 studies: 
All cause death, MI, stroke, congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization, unstable angina 
requiring hospitalization, hypertensive emergency, DVT, pulmonary embolism, and vascular access thrombosis.  
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 58 Various region- specific poo led analyses of composites of these adjudicated events, pooled across 
multiple studies will be conducted.  The analyses of the adjudicated events will be detailed in the 
region- specific PSAPs.  
For US (FDA) Only:  The primary safety endpoint in this study is the MACE (Major Adverse 
Cardiac Event) composite endpoint, defined as time to first occurrence of 
death from all causes, MI, or stroke, only for the purpose of being pooled across multiple similar studies in the Phase 3 program. None of the individual studies are powered to meet the MACE primary safety endpoint individually. The pooled MACE analysis is only for purposes of supporting a US FDA regulatory filing of roxadustat  
The above adjudicated safety events may also be used to support the pooled analyses of additional composite safety endpoints across multiple studies in the Phase 3 program, such as MACE+ (death, MI, stroke, congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization, and unstable angina requiring hospitalization), or a composite which consists of all of the adjudicated events.

4.1 Description of the Study  
This open-label, randomized, active controlled study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of roxadustat compared to epoetin alfa for the maintenance of hemoglobin (Hb) levels in 
subjects on HD or PD or HHD originally on ESA for treatment of anemia.  
• Screening Period:  Up to 6 weeks. For subjects currently taking Mircera®, the Screening 
Period can be extended up to 8 weeks  
• Treatment Period: Treatment duration is variable for individual subjects, with a minimum treatment duration of 52  weeks and a maximum duration of up to 
approximately 3 years after the last subject is randomized  
Amendment 1& 2 : In order to complete the Phase 3 program in a timely manner, 
minimum treatment duration of subjects enrolled under Amendment 1 & 2  may be 
shortened. Subjects will be informed at least 4 weeks in advance if such decision is made. All active subjects will end the study at the same time 
• Post-Treatment  Follow- Up Period:  4 weeks  
During the course of the study, visits and assessments will be performed as defined in the schedule of assessments.  
4.1.1 Screening Period  
After signing the informed consent, subjects enter the Screening Period. During the Screening Period eligibility assessments will be performed. Subjects in s creening  will continue their 
existing ESA therapy (eg, epoetin alfa, beta, theta, or zeta, darbepoetin alfa, Mircera
®) for the 
treatment of anemia ass ociated with ESRD.  
Subjects on dose-hold due to high haemoglobin may qualify for screening however, they cannot be randomized if in investigator’s opinion not ready to resume epoetin-alfa or roxadustat upon randomization. 
Upon successful completion of screening, a total of up to 1200 eligible subjects will be 
randomized to receive either roxadustat or epoetin alfa (active control) in a 1:1  ratio. Both 
roxadustat and epoetin alfa will be administered in an open label manner. Randomization must 
be completed prior to administration of study medication. Randomization to treatment arms will be provided by an interactive web and voice response system (IWRS) based on stratification factors.  
Subjects on long- acting ESAs (Aranesp or Mircera) may not receive the 1
st dose of study 
medication on the day of randomization due to ESA dosing schedule (e.g. once weekly or once bi-weekly); in these subjects, the 1
st dose of study medication (roxadustat or epoetin-alfa) should 
be administered on the day when the next dose of current ESA would have been due.  For all practical purposes, the date of 1
st dose of study drug administration should be considered as Day 
1.  
If Day 1 lab values (collected prior to administration of study medication) suggests the potential 
of a pre treatment condition confounding safety assessment or poses safety risks to study subject, 
in the opinion of the Investigator or Medical Monitor, the subject may be discontinued from the 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 60 study (example: At Screening 1 visit, LFT values were within the protocol range but at Day1, 
AST or ALT  > 3x ULN and Total bilirubin > 2x ULT, or AST or ALT >  5x ULN).  
4.1.2 Treatment Period  
Administration of the first dose o f study treatment (roxadustat or epoetin alfa) will occur on Day 
1 (Week 0) which should correspond to the administration of the subject’s next dose of their current ESA treatment.  
At the Day 1, subjects randomized to Roxadustat Arm will discontinue prior ESA therapy and initiate roxadustat therapy; subjects randomized to Epoetin- Alfa Arm will receive epoetin -alfa 
irrespective of their prior ESA use.   
The initial dose of study medication will be determined based on the average prescribed ESA dose in the last 4 weeks prior to randomization if on epoetin or darbepoetin (8 weeks if on Mircera
®) as outlined in Table 1or Table 2 for subjects randomized to receive roxadustat or 
epoetin alfa, respectively. The initial dose of roxadustat will remain constant during the first 4 weeks of the Treatment Period, except if a dose reduction is required for excessive hematopoiesis . 
Subsequent dose adjustments for roxadustat subjects will follow the dose adjustments guidelines as outlined in Appendix 2 in order to maintain a Hb level of approximately 11 g/dL during the Treatment Period. Dose adjustments for epoetin alfa subjects should follow the dosing recommendations as per the approved country- specific epoetin alfa Package Insert or Summary 
of Produc t Characteristics (SmPC). In PD  and HHD subjects, if receiving epoetin alfa 
subcutaneously, the dose and frequency may be determined by the Investigator per local standard of care.  
Day 1 study procedures including laboratory blood draws are to be completed prior to administration of the first dose of study treatment. In HD subjects, Day 1 procedures with the exception of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) assessments should be completed prior to the subject receiving dialysis that day. Weight measuremen t will be taken after completion of 
dialysis (ie, dry weight). 
Total treatment duration is variable for individual subjects. Subjects will receive study treatment 
(roxadustat or epoetin alfa) for a minimum of 52 weeks. The maximum treatment duration may be up to approximately 3 years from the date the last subject is randomized.  
In order to complete the Phase 3 program in a timely manner, minimum treatment duration of 
subjects enrolled under Amendment 1 & 2 may be shortened. Subjects will be informed at le ast 4 
weeks in advance if such decision is made. All active subjects will end the study at the same time.  
During the Treatment Period, subjects will attend weekly study visits from Day 1 to Week 2, followed by every 2 weeks study visits from Weeks 4 to 24 (eg, Weeks 4, 6). Following Week 24, study visits will occur every 4 weeks (eg, Weeks 28, 32) until EOT . A common closeout will 
occur when a predetermined number of cardiovascular (CV) events have been accrued across multiple studies in the overall Phase 3  dialysis program.  
At each study visit during the Treatment Period, Hb will be measured (prior to dialysis in HD 
subjects) locally to determine the need for a dose adjustment or to assess for excessive hematopoiesis. In the event that the Hb value from the central laboratory is significantly different 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 61 from  that measured locally, and per Investigator that warrants a reversal of the dose adjustment 
decision made earlier based on locally measured Hb value, the Medical Monitor should be 
informed, if possible. 
4.1.3 Post-Treatment  Follow- Up Period  
After completing  the Treatment Period, subjects proceed to the post- treatment  Follow-up Period 
and will return for the End of Study (EOS) visit. The choice of anemia treatment during the 
Follow-up Period is up to the discretion of the Investigator. If the Investigator decides to resume ESA treatment in roxadustat treated subjects, the first dose of ESA should be administered at least three days after the last dose of roxadustat.  
4.1.4 Long- term Follow- Up for Premature Treatment Discontinued Subjects  
Subjects who discontinue study medication prematurely will be followed up for vital status, CV events, and hospitalization until study closure, unless consent to participate is withdrawn. Upon completion of EOT and EOS visits, these subjects will be followed up every 3 to 6 month interval (depending on the availability of subjects) until study closure. These visits may occur either in -person or via telephone.  
4.2 Randomization , Treatment Assignment , and Rationale for Open -label 
Design  
A randomized design has been chosen in order to ensure a balanced and unbiased allocation of study subjects to the treatment arms and to minimize bias in therapeutic management and in outcomes assessment.  
An open-label design was chosen since double-blinding would require a double-blind, double-dummy design to match the different ESAs made by different manufacturers having different dosing specifications which is considered too challenging without much added benefits to the study. It would expose subj ects to multiple additional injections or infusions without additional 
benefit . Furthermore, the difference in iron supplementation requirements between roxadustat 
and the ESA will further complicate any efforts to blind, or alternatively end up in inadver tent 
unblinding. The high probability of these confounding factors rendering the conduct of a double-blind double-dummy study and data becoming invalid is outweighing the advantage of a lower risk for bias . Therefore, in light of the objectivity of primary endpoint measures not influenced 
by blinding and the lack of operational feasibility without addition of values to subjects, the open label study design is to be considered the most reasonable option. 
A total of up to approximately 1200 subjects are planned to be randomized in an open-label, 1:1 
ratio to receive either of the following two treatments:  
• Roxadustat  (up to approximately 600 subjects) 
• Active Control: epoetin alfa (up to approximately 600 subjects) 
Randomization is stratified by the following four factors:  
• Mean qualifying screening Hb  (≤ 10.5 vs. >
 10.5 g/dL) 
• History of CV , cerebrovascular , or thromboembolic diseases  (Yes vs. No) 
• Mean prescribed weekly baseline epoetin alfa dose (or, equivalent epoetin dose for nonepoetin subjects) in the 4 weeks prior to randomization (≤
 150 vs. >  150 IU/kg/week)  
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 62 • Geographic al region (U S vs. Ex -US region) 
Randomization of qualified subjects will take place prior to administration of study drug.  
4.3 Procedures for H andling Incorrectly Enrolled or R andomized subjects  
Subjects who fail to meet the eligibility criteria should not, under any circumstances, be enrolled 
or receive study medication. There can be no exceptions to this rule. Where a subject  does not 
meet all the eligibility criteria but is randomized in error or incorrectly received study medication, the Investigator should inform the Medical Monitor immediately, and a discussion should occur regarding whether to continue or discontinue the patient from treatment. All decisions from such meeting should be appropriately documented.  
4.4 Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who drop out prematurely will not be replaced in the study. 
4.5 Study Treatment  
4.5.1 Dose and Schedule  
Eligible subjects will be randomized via I WRS to receive either  roxadustat or epoetin alfa. The 
first dose of study drug should be administered on Day 1 (Week 0), which should correspond to a day when their next dose of ESA would have been administered . All subjects will attend weekly 
study visits from Day 1 to Week 2, followed by every two weeks study visits from Weeks 4 to 
24. Following Week 24, study visits will occur every four weeks until the EOT . Subjects will 
receive study medication in an open label manner .  
4.5.2 Starting Dose of Study Drug  
4.5.2.1 Roxadustat Arm  
In subjects on HD or PD or HHD randomized to roxadustat, the initial roxadustat dose will be 
determined using a conversion table based on the subject’s previous average weekly prescribed 
ESA dose in the last 4 weeks prior to randomization if the subject is on epoetin or darbepoetin, and average monthly (4 weeks) prescribed ESA dose in 8 weeks prior to randomization if the 
subject is on Mircera
® (Table 2). If the mean qualifying screening Hb value a t randomization is 
< 10 g/dL, the starting roxadustat dose will be increased by one dose step. For example, a subject on epoetin ( ie, epoetin alfa, beta, theta, zeta, delta, or omega) 6,000 IU/week with mean 
screening Hb of 9.4 g/dL at randomization will start roxadustat at a dose of 150 mg three times weekly (TIW).  
If the converted initial dose exceeds the maximum dose of 3.0 mg/kg/dose then the lower dose step should be chosen as the initial dose.  
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 63 The dose of roxadustat will remain constant during the f irst 4 weeks of the Treatment Period 
unless a dose reduction is required for excessive  hematopoiesis .

Notes:  The roxadustat dose steps are 20, 40, 50, 70, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, and 400  mg. 
4.5.2.2 Epoetin Alfa  Arm (Active Control)  
Subjects randomized to the epoetin alfa arm who are currently taking nonepoetin alfa treatment 
will be switched to epoetin alfa treatment on Day 1. All subjects on HD will receive IV epoetin alfa TIW starting from Day 1, irrespective of their baseline route of administration or frequency of ESA use. Subjects requiring ultra- low dose of EPO (eg, ≤1000 IU/per week), frequency of 
administration may be adjusted per local standard of care. 
Subjects on PD or HHD may continue using the same route of administration as baseline; 
however, if the Investigator decides to change the route of administration in a PD or HHD subject from subcutaneous to IV after randomization it should be done during the early part of the treatment phase (preferably prior to Week 16).  
All epoetin alfa administrations should be performed by the Investigator or an authorized member of the site staff  or other trained personnel. In subjects on PD or HHD , epoetin alfa may 
be self -administered su bcutaneously by the subject or a caregiver after adequate training or, if in 
the opinion of the Investigator, the subject or a caregiver is already adequately trained in self-administering ESA prior to the study.  
Doses:  
In subjects who have been randomize d to the epoetin alfa treatment arm, the initial epoetin alfa 
dose that the subject will receive on Day  1 will be determined using a conversion table based on 
the subject’s average weekly prescribed ESA dose in 4 weeks prior to randomization if on 
epoetin or darbepoetin, and average monthly (4-week) prescribed ESA dose in 8 weeks prior to randomization if on Mircera
® (Table 3).  
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 64 In case of a change in route of administration from subcutaneous to IV (TIW), the initial dose of 
IV epoetin alfa will be determined by the Investigator per local standard of care.  
In subjects on PD or HHD , if receiving epoetin alfa subcutaneously, the dose and frequency may 
be determined by the Investigator per local standard of care. Subsequent epoetin alfa dosing and dose adjustment during the study, if indicated, should be 
based on the country specific package insert or SmPC. 
For countries using pre filled epoetin alfa syringes, the initial dose and subsequent dosages 
following dose adjustments during the Treatment Period should be approximated to the closest 
total weekly dose.

4.5.3 Dose Adjustment  
4.5.3.1 Roxadustat Arm  
During the Treatment Period, roxadustat dose adjustment will be made according to the dose 
adjustment algorithm in Appendix 2, in order to maintain a Hb level of appro ximately 11 g/dL. 
Roxadustat dose adjustments are permitted from Week 4 onwards, and every 4 weeks thereafter (eg, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12); however, dose may be adjusted between two pre specified 
windows (eg, anytime between Week 4 and Week 8 visits, Week 8 and Week 12 visits) if the following two criteria are met: 
• No dose adjustment has been made in last 4 weeks, 
• Hemoglobin (Hb) <  9.0 g/dL. 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 65 Subjects on HD or PD or HHD randomized to roxadustat will take doses TIW for the entire 
duration of the Treatment Per iod. I f a subject requires < 20 mg TIW (ie, < 60 mg per week) to 
maintain a Hb level of approximately 11 g/dL, the d osing frequency should be reduced in a step -
wise fashion  e.g. TIW to BIW , BIW to  QW , QW to Q- 2 Week etc.  
In this study, a rate of rise of Hb > 2 g/dL within 4 weeks or a Hb level of ≥ 13 g/dl at any time 
would be considered as excessive haematopoiesis. For a rate of rise of Hb > 2 g/dL within 4 weeks, dose should be reduced by one dose step and for a Hb value ≥
 13.0 g/dL, the dose should 
be on hold until Hb drops < 12.0 g/dL per guidelines provided in the protocol  (Appendix 2). 
When roxadustat will be resumed, the dose will be reduced by one dose step.  
Dose adjustments or temporary dose holds for excessive hematopoiesis can occur at any time 
during the Treatment Period. Any dose adjustment will reset the dose-adjustment window to every 4  weeks thereafter (eg, dose adjustment for a qualified reason at Week 6 leads to next dose 
adjustment at Week 10).  If a dose adjustment review is scheduled on Week 22, then the next 
dose adjustment review will be scheduled on Week 28, since there is no scheduled visit on Week 26. 
Prescribed  dose must not exceed the maximum allowable dose of 3.0 mg/kg/dose or 400 mg per 
dose, whichever is lower. For dose adjustment purposes, post-dialysis weight (dry-weight) 
should be used. If the post- dialysis weight of the current visit is not available  at the time of dose 
adjustment, post-dialysis weight of the prior dialysis session or last recorded post- dialysis weight 
may be used.  
4.5.3.2 Active Control ( Epoetin alfa ) Arm   
Epoetin dose adjustments during the T reatment P eriod  should be based on country- specific 
epoetin alfa Package Insert or SmPC.   
In subjects on PD or HHD , if receiving epoetin alfa subcutaneously, the dose and frequency may 
be determined by the Investigator per local standard of care. 
4.6 Concomitant Medications,  Procedures and Nondrug Therapies  
4.6.1 Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medications are any prescription or over-the-counter preparations, including herbal products and “natural remedies”, used by a subject while participating in this clinical study.  
For all concomitant medication use, an indication for its use should be provided. If the stated 
indication is a nonspecific condition ( eg, “rash” ), documentation of the condition, as specific as 
possible, should be maintained in the subject’s clinical study records as source documentation.  
Use of herbal medicine during the study is not prohibited but strongly discouraged. All herbal 
and natural remedies should be reviewed by the investigator and if considered safe, may be allowed to continue at the same dose. 
To avoid confounding effects on study endpoints, changes to anti-hypertensive medications 
should be minimized, and made only if deemed medically necessary by the Investigator.  
4.6.1.1  Phosphate Binders  
When coadministered with roxadustat , in a clinical pha rmacology study, the bioavailability of 
roxadustat was reduced . Subjects should be advised to discuss with the Investigator when 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 66 changing the dose or dosing time of their phosphate binder while taking roxadustat. To optimize 
the absorption of roxadustat, subjects should be advised that roxadustat be taken at least one hour before or three hours after their phosphate binder if possible. 
4.6.1.2  Statins  
When coadministered with roxadustat, in clinical pharmacolgical studies, hydroxymethylglutaryl 
coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) exposure was increased 2 - to 3- fold
. For patients 
randomized to roxadustat, investigators should consider this interaction and local prescribing 
information when deciding on the appropriate statin dose for individual patients, bearing in mind the impact of ethnicity, other concomitant medications, renal and hepatic function. 
Goals of lipid 
lowering treatment should be maintained as clinically indicated. The dose of statins should not exceed the recommended daily dose in the table below for subjects randomized to roxadustat. 
Recommended Maximum Daily Dose of Statins for Subjects Randomized to Roxadustat  
Statin s Recommended maximum dose (mg/day)  
Atorvastatin  40 
Simvastatin  5 
Rosuvastatin  5 
Pravastatin  40 
Fluvastatin  20 
Pitavastatin  1 
Lovastatin  20 
4.6.2 Supplemental Iron Use  
In a Phase 2 study, there was no significant difference in Hb levels in roxadustat- treated subjects 
on dialysis receiving oral iron supplementation compared to subjects receiving IV iron 
supplementation, in subjects with ferritin <  100 ng/mL and in those with TSAT< 20%. Based on 
the mechanism of action of roxadustat and the Phase 2 study results, in subjects randomized to roxadustat, oral iron supplementation is considered to be sufficient.  
In this study, oral iron should be allowed as the preferred first -line of iron supplementation for 
both treatment arms without restriction .  
In addition to scheduled assessments ( Appendix 3 ), iron indices may be assessed anytime (via 
central lab) to evaluate iron storage status of the subjects, if considered necessary by the 
Investigator. 
4.6.2.1 Oral Iron Supplementation 
All subjects should be encouraged to take oral iron if they can tolerate as the preferred first -line 
iron supplementation during the Treatment Period. Provision of an oral iron supplement is 
encouraged; the dose and frequency are at the discretion of the principal Investigator. Oral Iron therapy should be started before the subject becomes iron depleted. 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 67 4.6.2.2 Intravenous (IV) Iron Supplementation  
Intravenous iron supplementation is permitted if in the opinion of the Investigator the subject has 
not responded adequately and  is considered iron deficient. IV iron may be administered per local 
standard of care as deemed necessary by the investigator. 
Treatment with study medication (roxadustat or epoetin) will continue during IV iron 
administration. Discontinuation of IV iron supplementation is recommended once the subject is no longer considered iron deficient (eg, ferritin ≥  100 ng/mL and TSAT ≥  20%) 
Subjects may receive IV iron during the post- treatment  Follow-up Period per discretion of the 
Investigator. If IV iron is to be administered at the EOT visit, all visit procedures including lab draws should be completed prior to administering IV iron. 
4.6.3 Rescue Therapy Guidelines  
Rescue therapy guidelines are provided to optimize the standardization of rescue therapy by 
Investigators and to ensure the safety of individual study subjects. Use of rescue therapy and reason for rescue therapy should be recorded in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). 
4.6.3.1 Red Blood Cell Transfusion ( all subjects ) 
For subjects in both treatment arms, RBC transfusion is allowed if rapid correction of anemia is 
required to stabilize the subject’s condition (eg, acute hemorrhage ) or the Investigator is of the 
opinion that the blood transfusion is a medical necessity. If the situation permits, the Medical Monitor should be informed prior to any scheduled RBC transfusion. Study treatment may continue during or after the RBC transfusion.  
4.6.3.2 Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents  
For subjects randomized to roxadustat the use of ESAs is generally prohibited. Erythropoiesis 
stimulating agent rescue is restricted to no more than one cycle of use during the Treatment 
Period; the Investigator ma y initiate use of an approved EPO  analogue if all of the following 
criteria are met:  
• A subject’s Hb level has not sufficiently responded to two or more dose increases or the 
maximum dose limit of the study drug has been reached; and  
• The subject’s Hb is < 8.5 g/dL on two consecutive measurements (central lab) drawn at 
least five days apart; and  
• Clinical judgment does not suggest iron deficiency or bleeding as a cause of lack of response or rapid decline in Hb; and  
• Reducing the risk of alloimmunization in transplant eligible patients and/or reduction of other RBC transfusion- related risks is a goal  
The subject is not allowed to be administered both the EPO  analogue and roxadustat at the same 
time. Treatment with an EPO  analogue should be started ≥  3 days after  the last dose of 
roxadustat, and should be stopped when Hb > 9 g/dL or after 4- week s, whichever comes first. If 
a subject requires longer than 4- week s therapy due to inadequate response the Medical Monitor 
should be contacted. Study treatment should be resumed after the following intervals: 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 68 • Two days after stopping epoetin  
• One week after stopping darbepoetin alfa  
• Two weeks after stopping methoxy polyethylene glycol- epoetin beta (Mircera®) 
If more than one cycle of EPO  analogue rescue is required, the Investigator should permanently 
discontinue roxadustat. Use of EPO  analogues will be recorded in the eCRF.  
Inadvertent ESA administration or ESA administration by the hospital staff in Roxadustat 
subject s should not be counted as rescue unless above criteria are met; these subjects  may be 
allowed to continue taking study medication, if considered safe by the Investigator or Medical Monitor. 
For subjects randomized to epoetin alfa, the Investigator may initiate use of a dif ferent EPO  
analogue if clinically indicated. Use of the different EPO  analogue will be recorded in the eCRF 
and will be considered rescue therapy. 4.6.4 Emergency Procedure (Therapeutic Phlebotomy ) 
If there are clinical concerns for a subject’s high Hb levels, t he Investigator may decide to 
perform a therapeutic phlebotomy in addition to temporarily withholding the study drug. This 
should be documented and discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
4.6.5 Prohibited Medications/Therapies/Substances  
The following medications /therapies are prohibited during the period identified: 
• Any investigational drug from 4 weeks prior to screening until EOS  
• Androgens from screening until EOS  
• Iron-chelating agents (eg, deferoxamine/desferrioxamine, deferiprone, or deferasirox 
therapy) from 4 weeks prior to randomization until EOS  
• Dapsone (at any dose) from screening until EOS  
• Chronic doses acetaminophen/paracetamol > 2.0 g/day from randomization until 1 week 
after EOT  
4.6.6 Contraception  
Female subjects of childbearing potential, if not pract icing complete sexual abstinence, must 
agree to practice a dual method of contraception, for example, a combination of the following:  (1) oral contraceptive, depo progesterone, or intrauterine device; and (2) a barrier method (condom or diaphragm). M ale subjects (nonsurgically sterile ; ie, no vasectomy) with female 
partners of childbearing potential who are not on birth control must agree to use a barrier method of contraception ( eg, condom) or the female partner must agree to use contraception as described 
above unless practicing complete sexual abstinence.  
Subjects must agree to practice above contraceptive methods , as applicable, for the entire 
duration of the study, from randomization through the EOS visit. It is highly recommended that 
they continue to practice the contraceptive methods for 12 weeks following the last dose of study treatment . For  subject s discontinuing study medication prematurely, it is recommended that they 
continue to practice contracepti ve methods for 12 weeks following the last dose of study 
treatment .

(Section  8.3.6)  
4.7 Safety Monitoring Plan  
Safety will be assessed throughout the study. A complete baseline profile of each subject will be established through demographics, medical history, clinical laboratory values, vital signs, physical ex amination  (PE), and electrocardiogram (ECG). During the course of the study, vital 
signs, PE , and laboratory tests will be performed at regular intervals as described in schedule of 
assessments ( Appendix 3 ).  
Blood pressure and HR  should be assessed according to  the guidelines described in Appendix 5.  
A comprehensive PE will be conducted during the Screening visit, Day 1 and at the EOT /ET 
visit. T argeted PE s (eg, general appearance, CV, respiratory and abdomen,) will be conducted 
throughout the study as described in the Schedule of Assessments.  
Any significant findings prior to administration of study drug will be considered as baseline 
conditions and if appropriate, will be captured as baseline medical histor y. Any clinically 
significant (CS) changes from baseline will be monitored throughout the study and appropriate 
interventions will be taken accordingly. Clinical laboratory tests may be assessed at additional times on unscheduled visits for safety reasons. Liver function abnormalities will be monitored according  to drug -induced l iver injury ( DILI ) guidance ( Appendix 4).  
All a dverse events, SAEs, and ongoing concomitant medication usage will be monitored and 
recorded throughout the study. Serious adverse event reports will be evaluated individually to asses s for the impact of the event, if any, on the overall safety of the product and on the study 
itself . Cumulative AEs will be monitored throughout the study. Serious adverse events and AEs 
will be followed until resolved, deemed stable, or until the subject’ s EOS  visit. See Section 8 for 
details on AE and SAE reporting. 
An Independent Event Review Committee (IERC), blinded to treatment group, will adjudicate 
prespecified CV , cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic safety events  of interest . These events 
include all -cause death, MI, stroke, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, hospitalization 
for unstable angina, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and hypertensive emergency . A separate adjudication charter will  describe the process in detail, and training and 
training materials will be provided to study sites.  
4.8 Data Safety and Monitoring Board  
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB ) will review safety data at least every six  months or 
twice per calendar year while the trial is ongoing  to ensure subject safety . A separate DSMB 
charter will establish the rules, meeting frequency , and scope of responsibi lities  of the DSMB .

5.3 Subject Discontinuation and Withdrawal  
The subject is free to permanently discontinue study medication at any time, without prejudice to further treatment. Discontinuation from study medication is not the same as complete withdrawal from the study (ie, withdrawal of consent).  
Subjects may with draw consent and discontinue from the study at any time by discontinuing 
study medication and refusing to return for any form of follow-up without any prejudice.  
A subject who decides to discontinue study medication will always be asked about the reason(s ) 
to discontinue study medication and the presence of AEs (if any). These data will be ascertained and documented by the investigator and recorded in the eCRF as appropriate. The subject should return all study medications.

Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 75 6 INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
6.1 Formulation  
Roxadustat is supplied by FibroGen, Inc. as red coated, oval tablets for oral administration, in 
strengths of 20 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg. The  excipients include lactose monohydrate, 
microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, and colorant Red Opadry II. All ingredients used for manufacture of roxadustat comply with US and 
European Union compendia or regulatory standards. Strengths are different in size and debossing reflects the strength ( ie, 20, 50, or 100 mg). Due to  the light-sensitive nature of roxadustat and to 
minimize exposure of the active pharmaceutical ingredient to light, tablets should remain in the original packaging for as long as possible and be administered as intact tablets only.  
6.2 Storage  
Roxadustat tablets  should be protected from light, and stored at room temperature between 15 °C 
and 30°C  (59º F to 86ºF).  
Epoetin alfa should be stored according to the package insert. 
All study drugs (roxadustat and epoetin alfa) should be stored in a securely locked area to which 
access is limited to appropriately authorized study personnel.  
6.3 Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
All study drugs provided by the Sponsor or provided at the study site should be retained at the site until otherwise instructed in writing by the  Sponsor. Upon completion of the study or 
termination of the investigational site, all used (vials /syringes or bottles), unused, and partially 
used study drugs; and all study drugs that were not dispensed will be shipped to a site designated by the Sponsor or may be destroyed according to local/institutional policies by the 
Pharmacy /authorized staff after drug accountability and reconciliation has been completed by 
Sponsor. Please refer to the Study Reference Manual or Pharmacy Manual for additional informa tion. 
6.4 Route of Administration  and Dose  
6.4.1 Roxadustat  
Subjects on HD or PD  or HHD randomized to roxadustat will take doses TIW for the entire 
duration of the Treatment Period. If a subject requires < 20 mg TIW (ie, < 60 mg per week) to 
maintain a Hb level of approximately  11 g/dL, the dosing frequency should be reduced in a step -
wise fashion  e.g. TIW to BIW , BIW to  QW , QW to Q- 2 Week  etc.  
Roxadustat will be dispensed to subjects with instructions for self- administration of the tablets 
orally on each dosing day, according to the dosing schedule. The tablets are to be swallowed whole.  
First dose of roxadustat should be administered on Day 1 after completion of all procedures 
including laboratory draws. Roxadustat doses should be administered at least 2 days apart, and no more than 4 days apart. Dosing should occur at approximately at the same time of day . 
Roxadustat can be taken with or without food.  
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 76 6.4.2 Epoetin Alfa  
During the Treatment Period, starting from Day 1, a ll subjects on HD randomized to epoetin a lfa 
arm will receive epoetin alfa intravenously TIW irrespective of their baseline route of 
administration or frequency of ESA use . Epoetin alfa dose adjustments should be based on the 
country specific package insert or SmP C. 
Subjects requiring ultra- low dose of EPO (eg, ≤1000 IU/per week), frequency of administration 
may be adjusted per local standard of care. For peritoneal dialysis subjects  and home hemo-
dialysis subjects , the route of administration (IV or SC) may remain th e same as baseline. 
However, if the investigator decides to change the route of administration in PD subjects from SC to IV after randomization it should be done during the early part of the treatment phase (preferabl y prior to Week 16). 
In case of a chang e in route of administration from subcutaneous to intravenous (TIW), the initial 
dose of IV epoetin alfa will be determined by the investigator per local standard of care.  
All epoetin alfa administrations should be performed by the investigator or an authorized 
member of the site staff  or other trained personnel. In PD  and HHD subjects, e poetin alfa may 
also be self -administered subcutaneously by the subject or a caregiver after adequate training or, 
if in the opinion of the investig ator, the subject or a caregiver is already adequately self -
administering ESA prior to the study. 
6.5 Overdose , Emergency Procedures and Management of Overdose  
The maximum tolerated dose of roxadustat has not been established in humans. For the purpose of this study, t he maximum allowed roxadustat dose is set at 400 mg or 3.0 mg/kg/dose, 
whichever is lower. Any dosing exceeding the maximum allowed roxadustat dose should be reported within 24 hours. The Medical Monitor should be contacted as soon as possible. Symptoms associated with overdosing, if any, will be reported as adverse events. An overdose without associated symptoms is not an AE and will be recorded on the overdose eCRF only.  
In the event of suspected roxadustat overdose, the subject should recei ve supportive care and 
monitoring. The Sponsor’s Medical Monitor should be contacted as applicable. In the event of suspected epoetin alfa overdose, refer to the Package Insert or SmPCs.

FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 77 7 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY 
7.1 Study Procedures by Visit  
During study visits, unless otherwise indicated , it is preferred that all assessments including labs 
and physical exam ination s should be completed predialysis for subjects on HD. For subjects on 
PD or HHD, assessments may be completed at any time during the visit, but preferably 
approximately at  the same time of the day  at each  study visit. Quality of life assessments should 
be administered approximately at the same time of the day . For example,  in subjects on HD, 
these assessments should be completed approximately at the same time during dialysis and in 
subjects on PD or HHD approximately at the same time of the day. Weight measurement in HD subjects should be done after dialysis (dry weight). For dose adjustment if the post- dialysis 
weight of the current visit is not available , post-dialysis weight of the prior dialysis session or 
last recorded post- dialysis weight ma y be used.  Blood pressure and HR should be assessed 
according to the guidelines described in Appendix 5. 
7.1.1 Screening Period  
Subjects must be consented before any screening tests or assessments are performed . All 
screening procedures should be completed within 6 weeks. For subjects currently taking 
Mircera
®, the screening period can be extended up to 8 weeks. During the screening period 
eligibility assessments will be performed.  
Subjects in screening will continue their existing ESA therapy for the treatment of anemia associated with ESRD.

• Review and record concomitant medications  
• Review and record procedures and nondrug therapies 
• Review and record AEs, if any (capture the event under medical history, if applicable) 
7.1.1.2 Screening 2  (≥ 2 days apart from Screening 1)  
Hemoglobin values must be obtained at least 2 days apart.  
• Vital signs ( BP, HR, RR, and Temp )  
• Laboratory test:  
o Hemoglobin (Hb) only 
o Serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test for female subjects of 
childbearing potential only [not required for females of no childbearing potent ial 
e.g. postmenopausal (per discretion of the PI) , surgically sterile etc. ] 
• Complete physical examination 
• Renal ultrasound - not required if results of a previous renal ultrasound or other imaging within 12 weeks prior to randomization to rule out renal cell carcinoma are available. If 
no results are available, a renal ultrasound must be performed during the screening  period 
prior to randomization. Renal ultrasound can be done at any time between Screening 2 and randomization, as convenient. The report must be reviewed prior to randomization.  
• Review and record concomitant medications  
• Review and record procedures and nondrug therapies  
• Review and record AEs, if any (capture the event under medical history, if applicable) 
7.1.1.3 Additional Screening  Assessments 
If a subject’s laboratory results do not meet the eligibility criteria, the laboratory assessment may be repeated within the Screening Period. The vi sits must be at least 2 days apart .  
For example, an additional Hb value may be collected if necessary . The mean of the 2 most 
recent Hb values during the screening period, obtained at least 2 days apart, will be used to calculate the subject’s eligibility . Liver function test ( LFT) parameters may not be repeated if 
found exclusionary at Screening without a prior approval from the Medical Monitor unless the investigator has  a valid  reason to believe that the original lab result is due to an error ( eg, 
possible sample mix -up). Such repeat should be communicated to the Medical Monitor as soon 
as possible.  
A subject  who fails screening may be re screened  if deemed appropriate  by the investigator. 
Where possible, an approval should be obtained from the Medical Monitor prior to rescreening.  
For all screen failures, the reason(s) will be documented.  7.1.1.4 Randomization 
Eligible subjects will be randomized via IWRS based on stratification factors to receive 
roxadustat or epoetin alfa. Randomization must take place prior to administration of study drug. 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 79 7.1.2 Treatment Period  
The Treatment Period begins on the first day of dosing with study treatment (Day 1/Week 0) 
which should correspond to the administration of the subject’s next dose of the ir current ESA 
treatment . At the Day 1, subjects randomized to Roxadustat Arm will discontinue prior ESA 
therapy and initiate roxadustat therapy; subjects randomized to Epoetin- Alfa Arm will receive 
epoetin -alfa irrespective of their prior ESA use. All stu dy procedures must be completed prior to 
administration of the 1st dose of study treatment.  
Subjects on long- acting ESAs (Aranesp or Mircera) may not receive the 1st dose of study 
medication on the day of randomization due to ESA dosing schedule (e.g. once weekly or once bi-weekly); in these subjects, the 1
st dose of study medication (roxadustat or epoetin-alfa) should 
be administered on the day when the next dose of current ESA would have been due.  For all practical purposes, the date of 1
st dose of study drug administration should be considered as Day 
1.  
During the Treatment Period, subjects will attend weekly study visits from Day 1 to Week 2, 
followed by every two weeks study visits from Weeks 4 to 24. Following Week 24, study visits 
will occur every four weeks until the EOT . A common closeout will occur when a predetermined 
number of CV events have been accrued.

planned EOT  visit then these specified assessments can be postponed until the EOT  visit.  
At each study visit during the Treatment Period, a  Hb value will be measured (prior to dialysis in 
HD subjects) locally to determine the need for a dose adjustment or to assess for excessive 
hematopoiesis. In the event that the Hb value from the central laboratory is significantly different from  that measured locally, and per Inves tigator that warrants a reversal of the dose adjustment 
decision made earlier based on locally measured Hb value, the Medical Monitor should be informed, if possible. 
7.1.2.5 End of Treatment (EOT) / Early Termination (ET) (± 7 days)

7.2.2 Long- Term Follow -Up of Subjects who Discontinued Study Medication Prematurely  
Each subject enrolled in this study is free to permanently discontinue study medication at any 
time, without prejudice to further treatment. Subject discontinuation and withdrawal are discussed in detail in Section 5.3 
Subjects who discontinue study medication prematurely will be followed up for vital status, CV 
events, and hospitalization until study closure, unless consent to participate is withdrawn. Upon completion of EOT and EOS visits, these subjects will be followed up every 3-6 month interval (depending on the availability of subjects) until study closure. These visits may occur either in-person or via telephone.  
The choice of anemia treatment after ET is up to the discretion of the investigator . If the 
investigator decides to resume ESA treatment in roxadustat treated subjects, the first dose of 
ESA should be administered at least three days after the last dose of roxadustat. 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 84 7.3 Missed Visits  
Every attempt should be made to complete all study visits within the visit window as outlined in 
the Schedule of Assessments.  
7.4 Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visit(s) and laboratory assessments may be required at the discretion of the 
investigator. Please refer to the eCRF  completion guidelines for additional informatio n. 
7.5 Laboratory Assessments  
Central laboratory results should be reviewed by the Investigator or another designated qualified 
study staff member as soon as it is received . Any abnormalities must be evaluated in clinical 
context and the investigator should de termine if it is clinically significant. Subject management 
is dependent upon close review of the laboratory dat a. 
7.6 Central Laboratory  
All study related tests of blood specimens will be performed by a central laboratory.  
Unscheduled and repeat laboratory tests will also be performed by the central laboratory. 
However, if the turnaround time from the central laboratory is not sufficiently rapid for clinical management of the subject, local laboratory (ie, Stat Lab) test results may be used to make the 
necessary clinical judgments.  Stat lab is to be used only for urgent lab test that is needed for 
immediate decision making related to the protocol, management of adverse events as determined 
by the Investigator. In all cases, a central laboratory specimen would also be drawn at the same time.  A central laboratory manual with instructions on specimen collection, processing, storing, 
and shipping to the central laboratory will be provided to all participating sites.  
Laboratory tests for this study are listed  in Table 4.

7.6.1 Archival Serum and Plasma Samples  (Optional)  
At pre specified visits, a set of serum and plasma samp les will be drawn and stored for the 
potential future analysis of relevant biomarkers  linked with the efficacy or safety of the study 
drugs or with the progression of CKD. No genetic (DNA)  testing will be performed using these 
samples  for diagnosis of genetic disorders. Subjects may opt out of providing serum and plasma 
samples when providing consent for study participation or at any time during the course of the 
study. All details on the processing of the samples, storage and shipment conditions will be provided in the laboratory manual. 
7.7 Electrocardiogram  
Local 12 -lead ( ECGs ) will be performed on all subjects at specific time points as described in the 
Schedule of Assessments . The ECG should be taken after 5 minutes in the supine position. Any 
abnormalities must be evaluated in clinical context (based on subject’s  medical history and 
concomitant medication) and the investigator should determine if it is clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormalities should be reported  as an AE. ECG recordings will be kept as 
source documents. Abnormal ECG findings prior to administration of study drug on Day 1 will be considered baseline conditions.  
7.8 Renal Ultrasound  
A renal ultrasound examination will be performed during screening if no record of a renal ultrasound or other imaging exists within 12 weeks prior to randomization. Renal ultrasound findings must be available prior to randomization to exclude subjects with a presence or suspicion of renal cell carcinoma. The date of assessment and findings must be documented as baseline findings.  
7.9 Health Related Quality of Life Questi onnaires  
All study subjects will be required to complete the following HRQoL questionnaires : SF-36, 
FACT -An, and EQ-5D- 5L at baseline and during the study at pre specified visits . HR QoL 
assessments should be administered approximately at the same time of th e day . For example,  in 
subjects on HD, these assessments should be completed approximately at the same time  during 
dialysis  (preferably at the beginning of the dialysis session) and in subjects on PD approximately 
at the same time o f the day at scheduled visits.  
7.9.1 36-Item Short Form Health Survey  
The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a quality of life ( HRQoL ) instrument designed 
to assess generic health concepts relevant across age, disease, and treatment groups . It is aimed at 
both adults and adolescents ages 18 years and older. The SF -36 consists of 8 domains of health 
status: physical functioning (PF) (10 items), role physical (4 items), bodily pain (2 items), general health (5 items), vitality  (VT) (4 items), social functioning (2 items), role emotional (3 
items) and mental health (5 items) . Two component scores, the Physical Component Scores and 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 87 the Mental Component Summary can also be calculated . For both the SF-36 domain scores and 
summary scores, higher scores indicate better health  status.  
7.9.2 FACT -An 
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- General (FACT -G; Version 4) contains 27 items 
that cover four dimensions of well- being: physical (7 items), functional (7 items), social/family 
(7 items), and emotional (6 items) . A subscale of 1 3 fatigue specific items plus 7 additional items 
related to anemia were developed for use in conjunction with the FACT -G (Yellen et al, 1997 ). 
The 13 fatigue items plus the 7 additional items related to anemia comprise the Anemia 
Subscale. Administration of 3the FACT -G plus the Anemia Subscale is referred to as the FACT -
An. The FACT -An has a recall period of the ‘past seven days’. Respondents are asked to provide 
responses, ( ie, ‘Not at all’, ‘A little bit’, ‘Somewhat’, ‘Quite a bit’ , and ‘Very much’), to a list of 
statements which are either positively or negatively phrased . For all FACT -An scales, a higher 
score indicates better HR QoL.  
7.9.3 European Quality of Life Questionnaire in 5 Dimensions  
The EQ - 5D-5L consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analog scale. The 
EQ-5D- 5L descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions of health: mobility, self -care, usual 
activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems. The visual analog scale records the respondent's self- rated health status on a graduated (0 –100) scale, where the 
endpoints are labeled ‘Best imaginable health state’ and ‘Worst imaginable health state’ with higher scores for higher HRQoL. EQ -5D-5L health states, defined by the EQ-5D- 5L descriptive 
system, may be converted into a single summary index by applying a formula that essentially attaches values (also called weights) to each of the levels in ea ch dimension.

FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 88 8 SAFETY  
8.1 Background  
Adverse event reports from investigators are the critical building blocks to the development of 
the safety profile of the study drug. Subjects will be asked nonleading questions in general terms to determine the occurrence of AEs, according to the schedule outlined in Appendix 3. In 
addition, all AEs reported spontaneously during the course of the study will be recorded. The investigator must immediately (within 24 hours of awareness) report to the sponsor all SAEs, regardless of whether the investigator believes they are related to the study drug.  
The definitions of an AE, suspected adverse reaction, adverse react ion, and SAE are described 
below in accordance with the FDA  Final Rule Vol 75, No 188, September 29, 2010; Article 18 
of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 April 2001and the 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E2A guidance. 
8.2 Definitions  
8.2.1 Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AEs is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug- related.  
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal and clinically significant laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the BL condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (eg, off- label 
use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
An AE includes medical conditions, signs, and symptoms not previously observed in the subject 
that emerge during the protocol-specified AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with an underlying condition that were not present prior to the AE reporting period (Section  8.3.1).  
8.2.2 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event  is any AE or suspected adverse reaction that results in any of the 
following outcomes: 
• Death,  
• A life -threatening AEs (ie, if in the view of the investigator or sponsor, the subject was at 
immediate risk of death at the time of the event). Life -threatening does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe, 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functio ns, 
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect, or 
• Other medically important events  
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 89 Based upon appropriate medical judgment, important medical events that may not result 
in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. These events must be reported to the sponsor similar to serious adverse events. 
Safety events of interest  (“Special Situations”) on the medicinal products administered to the 
subject as part of the study (eg, study drug, comparator, background therapy) that may require expedited reporting and/or safety evaluation include, but are not limited to: 
• Overdose of the medicinal product (exceeding the maximum allowable per dose i.e 400 mg or 3.0 mg/kg, whichever is lower) 
• Suspected abuse/misuse of the medicinal product 
• Inadvertent or accidental exposure to the medicinal product 
• Medication error involving the medicinal product (with or without subject/patient 
exposure to the Sponsor medicinal product, eg, name confusion) 
• Drug -drug interaction  
8.2.3 Definition of a Suspected Adverse Reaction  
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility  that the 
drug caused the AE. The term “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship  between the drug and the AE. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser 
degree of certainty about causality than the term “adverse reaction.”  
8.2.4 Definition of an Adverse Reaction 
An adverse reaction means any AEs caused by a drug.  
8.3 Procedures for Eliciting, Recording, and Reporting Adverse Events  
8.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which all AEs and SAEs must be reported begins after informed consent is obtained and ends at End of Study / 4- Week post ET/EOT V isit, except for pregnancy 
reporting (Section 8.3.6).  
Adverse events will be followed until resolved, stable, or until the subject’s last study visit or lost 
to follow- up. If an AE is not resolved or stabilized at the subject’s last visit, it is up to the 
discretion of the investigator and study medical monitor to determine if further monitoring of the 
event is warranted.  
Adverse events collected prior to dosing of study drug will be considered “nontreatment emergent” while those reported after the first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after the ET/EOT Vis it will be considered “treatment emergent” and be assessed for relationship to study 
drug. If an AE starts on Day 1, the investigator must assess as to whether the AE started prior to or after the administration of study medication and record accordingly. 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 90 8.3.2 Adverse Event Eliciting/Reporting  
During the AE reporting period, study site personnel will query each subject at each visit to 
actively solicit any AE occurring since the previous visit. All AEs will be collected in response to a general question about the subject’s well -being and any possible changes from the BL or 
previous visit, but shall not be specifically solicited. There will be no directed questioning for any specific AE. This does not preclude the site from collecting and recording any AEs reported by the subject to site personnel at any other time. Conditions including signs and symptom present at baseline, unless significantly worsened, shouldn’t be reported as adverse events during the study. 
Whenever is possible, diagnoses should be recorded when signs and symptoms are due to a 
common etiology, as determined by qualified medical study staff. New indications for medications started after informed consent is obtained may qualify to be recorded as AEs; recurrence or worsening of medical history problems requiring new or changes in concomitant medication, may also qualify to be recorded as AEs.  
An abnormality identified during a medical test (eg, laboratory parameter, vital sign, ECG data, 
physical exam) should be defined as an AE only if the abnormality meets one of the following criteria:  
• Induces clinical signs or symptoms 
• Requires active intervention 
• Requires interruption or discontinuation of study medication  
• In the opinion of the investigator, the abnormality is clinically meaningful and significantly different from baseline.  
The following attributes must be assigned to each AEs: 
• Description (Investigator’s verbatim term describing the event) 
• Dates of onset and resolution 
• Severity  
• Relationship to study drug  
• Outcome 
• Action taken regarding study drug (decision taken by the PI in response to an AE) 
• Other action (treatment, nondrug therapy) required 
• Determination of “seriousness”  
8.3.3 Assessing Adverse Event Severity  
The Investigator  should grade the AEs using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for AE (CTCAE) guidelines. For terms not specified as part of NCI 
CTCAE, the following guidelines should be used to determine grade: 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 91 All AEs will be assessed for severity using the following criteria:  
• Grade 1, Mild : Asymptomatic or mild symptoms which the subject finds easily 
tolerated. The event is of little concern to the subject and/or of little -or-no clinical 
significance; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. 
• Grade 2, Moderate: The subject has enough discomfort to cause interference with or 
change in some of their age- appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (eg, 
preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money); local or noninvasive intervention indicated. 
• Grade 3, Severe: The subject is incapacitated and unable to work or participate in many or all usual activities. The event is of definite concern to the subject and/or poses substantial risk to the subject’s health or well-being; Likely to require medical intervention and/or close follow-up, including but not limited to hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization. 
• Grade 4, Life- threatening:  The subject was at immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred.  
• Grade 5, Death:  The subject died due to the event.  
8.3.4 Assessing Relationship to Study Drug  
Most of the information about the safety of a drug prior to marketing comes from clinical trials; therefore, AE reports from investigators are critically important. Moreover, appropriately deciding whether the AE meets the definition of a suspected adverse reaction is usually the most difficult determination, but it is critical to avoid the miscategorization of the product’s safety profile.  
Due to the historical tendency for assessment of relationship to default as possibly related, the FDA has issued new guidance that clarifies the intent of the phrase “reasonable possibility” in the definition of “associated with the use of the drug.” Default reporting of individual events as 
possibly related is uninformative and does not meaningfully contribute to the development of the 
product safety profile.  
The investigator must provide an assessment of the relationship of the AE to study drug in accordance with the guidance below. Absence of an alternative cause would not normally be considered enough evidence to assess an event as possibly related or related to study drug.  
• Related (Adverse Reaction):  
o Any event for which there is evidence to conclude that the study drug caused the event  
• Possibly Related (Suspected Adverse Reaction):  
o A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure, such as angioedema, anaphylaxis, rhabdomyolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, etc. 
o One or more occurrences o f an event that is not commonly associated with drug 
exposure but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug, such as tendon rupture 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 92 • Not Related:  
o The event represents the underlying disease (eg, disease-related symptoms, 
disease progressio n) 
o The event represents a comorbid condition present at the time the subject entered the study 
o The event represents a known adverse reaction associated with a co -medication 
received by the study subject 
o The event is common for the study population (eg, CV events in an elderly population) 
o The event has no plausible relationship to study drug 
o The event is a study endpoint (eg, mortality, major morbidity) 
The investigator must provide an assessment of the relationship of the event to study drug, as this inform ation is very important to monitor the real-time safety of the study drug. However, as the 
manufacturer of the study drug, FibroGen is responsible for making the final causality assessment for individual reports, and for reporting suspected adverse reactions and adverse reactions to appropriate Health Authorities.  
While the investigator must provide an assessment of the relationship of the event to study drug, in most cases only aggregate data review will be used to make the determination of the relationship of the study drug to a given AE. 
8.3.5 Reporting Serious Adverse Events on the SAE Report Form  
All SAEs must be reported immediately to the Sponsor and/or its designated safety management 
vendor. 
To report an SAE, the investigator must fax an SAE Report Form to Sponsor’s designated safety 
management vendor within 24 hours of becoming aware of the serious event. In case of emergency or doubt, the Investigator shall call Sponsor’s Medical Monitor for guidance. Follow-up reports must be submitted in a timely manner as additional information becomes available.  
Full details of the SAE should also be recorded on the medical records and onto the eCRF. The 
following minimum information is required: 
• Subject number, sex and age 
• The date of report 
• A description of the SAE (event, seriousness of the event) 
• Causal relationship to the study drug 
Follow-up information for the event should be sent promptly (within seven days) as necessary. 
For each SAE observed, the investigator should obtain all of the information available about the 
event, including (but not limited to):  hospital discharge diagnoses, hospital discharge note, death certificate, appropriate laboratory findings (including autopsies and biopsy results), and clinical examinations (including radiological examina tions and clinical consultations).  
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 93 8.3.5.1 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to the Institutional Review Board / Independent 
Ethics Committee  
The investigator is responsible for notifying his/her Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC) of SAEs in accordance with local regulations. Sponsor, or its safety representative, will provide to the investigator a copy of any expedited safety reports that it intends to file with a regulatory authority.  
8.3.5.2 Deaths  
For any death occurring during the subject’s study participation, regardless of attribution, the 
investigator will report the death immediately to the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor and their designated safety management vendor. 
The investigator should notify Sponsor and their designated safety management vendor of any 
death or other SAE occurring after a subject has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to the study.  
The investigator must submit the SAE Report Form and complete the appropriate e CRF for the 
event that led to the subject’s death.  When reporting a death, the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome 
should be recorded as the primary event term on the SAE Report Form. 
8.3.6 Pregnancies: Reporting and Follow- up of Subjects  
A pregnancy in a female subject must be confirmed by positive serum β -hCG test. If β -hCG test 
is found positive in a female subject of childbearing  potential, study drug should be placed on 
hold temporarily until pregnancy  is ruled out via a repeat test ≥3 days .  If a female subject 
becomes pregnant while the subject is  receiving study treatment or within 12 weeks after the last 
dose of study treatment, a Pregnancy Report Form must be completed and submitted to Sponsor 
(by way of its de signated safety management vendor) within 24 hours of the investigator learning 
of the pregnancy. The investigator should report the information to the sponsor on the designated 
forms. If applicable, a pregnant subject is immediately withdrawn from receiving study treatment. The investigator must follow the pregnancy to completion to ascertain both its outcome and whether any AEs  occurred.  
Pregnancy itself is not an AE unless there is a suspicion that the investigational product under study may have interf ered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Pregnancies are 
followed up to outcome even if the subject was discontinued from the study. The outcome of the pregnancy must be reported by the investigator, which should be sent to the Sponsor and/or its designated safety management vendor within 24 hours of the investigator learning of the outcome. Congenital abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.  
Pregnancy of the subject’s partners is not considered to be an AE. However, the outcome of all pregnancies ( spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) should if possible be followed up and documented as described. To capture information about a pregnancy from the partner of a male subject, the male subject’s partner consent must be obtained to collect information related to the pregnancy and outcome 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 94 (should be handled on a case by case basis with IRB/IEC approval); the male patient should not 
be asked to provide this information. 
8.3.7 Abnormal Laboratory Findings 
Laboratory values will be collected throughout the study to assess for safety. The investigator 
must review and  assess all laboratory results in a timely manner, and determine whether the 
abnormal laboratory values, if any, are clinically significant (CS) or not clinically significant (NCS), and whether there are associated signs and symptoms.  
An abnormal laboratory finding should be defined as an AE only if the abnormality meets one of 
the following criteria:  
• Induces clinical signs or symptoms 
• Requires active intervention 
• Requires interruption or discontinuation of study medication  
• In the opinion of the investigator, the abnormality is clinically meaningful and significantly different from baseline  
If the abnormal laboratory finding is accompanied by signs or symptoms, report the signs and 
symptoms as the AE in lieu of the abnormal laboratory value. If a diagnosis is available, report the diagnosis. 
A decrease in Hb value without any significant clinical symptoms should not be reported as an 
adverse event. In this case, worsening of anemia as evidenced by drop in Hb value may be considered as lack of efficacy as opposed to AE as the subject fails to response adequately to study drug.  
8.3.8 Disease Progression  
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a subject’s condition attributable to the 
disease for which the investigational product is being studied. It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. Gradual worsening of ESRD should be considered disease progression and should not be reported as an AE during the study. 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 95 9 STATISTICAL CO NSIDERATIONS  
9.1 Sample Size Determination  
At least 600 subjects will be enrolled in this study. During the course of this study, which is 
being conducted in parallel with other Phase 3 studies, up to 1200 subjects may be enrolled for safety evaluation  of roxadustat in comparison to epoetin alfa including adjudicated and 
prespecified safety events of interest (ie, all -cause death, MI , stroke, congestive heart failure 
requiring hospitalization, unstable angina requiring hospitalization, DVT, pulmonary embolism, vascular access thrombosis, and hypertensive emergency). The final number of patients to be enrolled will be based on the enrollment rate of other studies within the same indication, in order to optimize stopping these studies at comparable time frame  
With at least 600 subjects, the study will provide at least 99% power to demonstrate statistical noninferiority of roxadustat vers us ESA in the primary endpoint for US (FDA) submission 
(ie, specifically, Hb change from baseline to the average level during the evaluation period 
defined as Week 28 until Week 52). 
The study will provide at least 99% power to demonstrate statistical noninferiority of roxadustat 
versus ESA in the primary endpoint outside of the United States (ie, specifically, Hb change from BL in the averaged Hb over Weeks 28 to 36).  
This assumes a difference (roxadustat minus ESA) of 0.30 g/dL, a noninferiority margin f or this 
difference of 0.75 g/dL and a standard deviation of 1.25 g/dL.  
9.2 Randomization  
Randomization will be stratified by the following three factors:  
• Mean qualifying screening hemoglobin (≤  10.5 vs. > 10.5 g/dL) 
• History of CV, cerebrovascular, or thromboembolic diseases (yes vs. no) 
• Mean prescribed  weekly epoetin alfa dose (or, equivalent epoetin dose for nonepoetin 
subjects) in the 4 weeks prior to randomization (≤  150 vs. > 150 IU/kg/week)  
• Geographical region (US vs. Ex-US regions)  
9.3 Analysis Populations  
For US regulatory submission, efficacy and safety analyses will be based on all subjects  
stratified by the protocol amendments, on subjects  enrolled during the original protocol but 
before the amendment  1, and on subjects  enrolled after the amendment s separately .  
For EU regulatory submission, efficacy and safety analyses will be based on subjects  enrolled 
during the original protocol before the amendment s, as the subjects enrolled after the 
amendment s may be considered as a sub -study for EU regulatory purpose.  
The following analysis sets are defined and will be used for the statistical analysis.  9.3.1 Intent to Treat Population (ITT)
  
The ITT population consists of all randomized subjects .  
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 96 9.3.2 Full Analysis Set (FAS)  
The FAS consists of all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug and 
have at least one postdose Hb assessment. If treatment received differs from the ra ndomized 
treatment, the randomized treatment arm will be used.  
9.3.3 Per-Protocol Set (PPS)  
The PPS consists of all randomized subjects who received at least 8 weeks of study treatment, 
have at least one postdose Hb assessment and are without major protocol violations. 
9.3.4 Safety Analysis Set (SAF)  
The SAF will consist of all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study 
medication. If treatment received for the duration of the study differs from the randomized treatment, the actual treatment arm will be used.  
9.4 Statistical Analysis  
Safety and efficacy data will be summarized and presented by treatment group in summary tables . Descriptive statistics including number of subjects (N), means, standard deviations, 
medians, and minimum and maximum values will be presented for continuous variables . Counts 
and percentages will be presented for categorical variables . For efficacy endpoints, the standard 
error and 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be presented as part of the descriptive summaries . 
9.4.1 Subj ect Enrollment and Disposition  
 The number of randomized subjects (ITT) , treated subjects,  FAS and PPS subjects and subjects 
who discontinued along with the reason for early termination will be summarized by treatment 
group and overall. 
9.4.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics (age, race, sex), BL characteristics including stratification factors, and subject 
disease characteristics will be summarized .  
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for continuous variables ( eg, age, weight, BL Hb, body 
mass index) and frequency counts and percentages will be tabulated for categorical variables ( eg, 
sex, race, Hb category,  iron status, and history of CV disease or cerebrovascular disease) by 
treatment group and overall. 9.4.3 Efficacy Analyses 
Efficacy an alysis for superiority will be conducted on the ITT population for US ( FDA ) 
submission and on FAS population for EU regulatory submission. Efficacy analysis for non-inferiority will be conducted on the ITT population for US (FDA) 
submission and on the PPS for EU regulatory submission. Hb results obtained from the central laboratory will be used for all ef ficacy analyses . Baseline 
Hb value for efficacy analysis is defined as the mean of four central laboratory Hb values, three 
of the latest sc reening Hb values plus the pre -dose Hb value collected on Day 1 for subjects who 
enrolled under original protocol and Amendment 1. Subjects enrolled under Amendment 2, baseline Hb value for efficacy analysis is defined as the mean of three central laborato ry Hb 
values, two  of the latest screening Hb values plus the pre-dose Hb value collected on Day 1 . 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 97 In subjects with missing Day 1 Hb value, the mean of three (two, for Amendment 2) latest 
screening laboratory Hb values will be considered as BL  Hb value.  
9.4.3.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint for the US  (FDA)  submission is defined as the Hb change from 
baseline to the average level during the evaluation period defined as Week 28 until Week 52 . 
The analysis will be based on the all  ITT population, Sensitivity analyses will be performed on 
ITT Population enrolled under the original protocol, and the ITT population enrolled under amended protocols , separately.    
The primary hypothesis to be tested for the primary efficacy analysis is: 
H
0: Hb mean change from baseline to the average level from Week 28-to Week 52  in the 
roxadustat group ≤  Hb mean change from baseline in the e poetin alfa group minus 0.75 
g/dL 
Versus : 
H1: Hb change from baseline to the average level of Week 28 to Week 52  in the 
roxadustat group > Hb mean change from baseline  in the e poetin alfa group minus 0.75 
g/dL 
A Multiple Imputation Analysis of C ovariance ( MI-ANCOVA)  model will be used. The 
model will contain terms for baseline Hb measurement  as covariate, treatment arm, and 
randomization stratification factors  except Screening Hb values ( ≤ 10.5 g/dL vs. > 10.5 g/dL) 
as fixed effects . Detailed analysis of the primary endpoint will be outlined in the SAP.  
In addition, as a sensitivity analysis, the primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using the 
analysis of MMRM model. The MMRM model will contain terms for baseline Hb measurement  
as covariate, treatment arm, visit, visit by treatment arm, and randomization stratification factors  
except Screening Hb values ( ≤ 10.5 g/dL vs. > 10.5 g/dL) as fixed effect . The primary efficacy 
analysis (for both, US [FDA] and EU regulatory submissions) will be based on the estimated differe nce between the two treatments overall m ean effects throughout the evaluation period 
based on the primary analysis models.  
Due to the large amount of visits to include in the MMRM model, the unstructured covariance pattern model will be tested against the  less parameterized heterogeneous Toeplitz structure 
using the likelihood ratio test for nested models. If the algorithm for unstructured covariance pattern does not converge or the likelihood ratio test is not statistically significant then heterogeneous Toeplitz structure will be used. If this second model does not converge either then the (homogeneous) Toeplitz structure will be tried and finally compound symmetry as a covariance structure to achieve convergence.  
Pattern Mixture models will be used as additional sensitivity analyses. The details will be described in the SAP. 
Hb values under the influence of a rescue therapy will not be censored in the primary analysis.  The null hypothesis will be rejected if the two -sided 95% CI for the difference between the two 
least squares mean s of the  roxadustat group and the epoetin alfa group throughout the evaluation 
lies entirely above –0.75 g/dL  
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 98 The primary efficacy endpoint for EU regulatory submission is defined as the Hb change from 
BL to the average Hb of Weeks 28 to 36, without having received rescue therapy within 6 weeks prior to and during this 8-week evaluation period and will be based on the PPS population enrolled under original protocol only. This primary efficacy analysis will be based on the estimated difference between the two treatments overall mean effects throughout the evaluation period based on the same MMRM model  as the sensitivity analysis of primary efficacy endpoint 
for US regulatory submission.  
For subjects who discontinued the study prior to Week 28, the last Hb value will be used in the 
assessment of the primary endpoint. 
The primary hypothesis to be tested for the primary efficacy analysis is: 
H
0: Hb mean change from BL to the a verage of Weeks 28  to 36 in the roxadustat group 
≤ Hb mean change from BL in the epoetin alfa group minus 0.75 g/dL 
Versus:  
H1: Hb change from BL to the average of Weeks 28 to 36 in the roxadustat group > Hb 
mean change from BL in the epoetin alfa group minus 0.75 g/dL 
For subjects who require rescue therapy, the Hb value after to the initiation of the rescue therapy 
will be set to missing up to 6 weeks from the last date of the rescue therapy . This null hypothesis 
will be rejected if the two -sided 95% CI f or the difference between the two treatment groups 
using MMRM model lies entirely above –0.75 g/dL. 
The analysis will be repeated using the FAS as a sensitivity analysis.  9.4.3.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Once the primary hypothesis is rejected for the primary endpoint, the secondary variables will be 
tested using a fixed sequence testing procedure as follows: 
• For US ( FDA ) submission: Proportion of subjects with mean Hb level during the 
evaluation period defined as Week 28 until Week 52  ≥ 10.0 g/dL. 
• EU regulatory submission: Hemoglobin (Hb) response, defined as mean Hb during Weeks 28 to 36 within the range of 10.0 to 12.0 g/dL without having received rescue therapy within 6 weeks prior to and during this 8- week evaluation period . 
The hypothesis to be tested for the first secondary efficacy analysis is:  
H
0: Hb response rate for subjects in the roxadustat group - Hb responder rate for subjects 
in the e poetin alfa group ≤ -15% 
Versus  
H1: Hb response rate for subjects in the roxadustat group - Hb responder rate for subjects 
in the e poetin alfa group > -15%.  
A 2-sided 95% CI  for the difference of two responder rates ( roxadustat- ESA) based on 
the Miettinen  and Nurminen approach adjusting for treatment group and other 
stratification factors will be calculated and H0 will be rejected if th e lower bound of the 
95% CI is greater t han - 15%.

Statistical methods for additional efficacy endpoints are described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) . 
9.4.4 Safety Analyses 
The Safety analyses will be performed using the safety analysis set (SAF).  
Safety parameters include adverse events, SAEs, laboratory parameters, vital signs, ECG parameters, and PE .  
The number and percentage of subjects reporting TEAEs and TESAEs in each treatment group will be tabulated. Descriptive statistics will be presented for laboratory, vital signs values and ECG parameters by visit and for the changes from BL to each visit.  
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 100 The CV safety assessment of roxadustat will also be based on pooled analysis of composites of 
adjudicated CV events pooled across multiple global Phase 3 clinical studies which includes this study, according to the regional pooled SAPs for meeting regional regulatory requirements. 
For US (FDA) submission only: The primary safety endpoint in this study is the MACE (Major 
Adverse Cardiac Event) composite endpoint, defined as time to first occurrence of death from all causes, MI, or stroke, only for the purpos e of being  pooled across multiple similar studies in the 
Phase 3 program. None of the individual studies are powered to meet the MACE primary safety endpoint individually. The pooled MACE analysis is only for purposes of supporting a US FDA regulatory filing of roxadustat.  
Safety data and dosing decisions will be monitored on an ongoing basis. Ongoing review of 
safety data will be conducted by an independent DSMB. 
For each safety parameter, the last assessment made prior to the first dose of study medication 
will be used as the BL  for all analyses of that safety parameter.  
9.4.4.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
An AE (classified by preferred term) occurring during the T reatment Period w ill be considered a 
treatment emergent AEs  (TEAE) if it was not present prior to the first dose of study medication, 
or if it was present prior to the first dose of study medication but increased in severity during the Treatment P eriod . An AE that occurs more than 28 days after the ET/EOT Visit date will not be 
counted as a TEAE.  
The number and percentage of subjects reporting TEAEs in each treatment group will be tabulated by system organ class and preferred term; by system organ class, preferred term, and severity; and by system organ class and preferred term. If more than one event occurs with the same preferred term for the same subject, the subject will be counted only once for that preferred term using the most severe and most related occurren ce for the summarization by severity and by 
relationship to the study medication.  
The overall distribution of TEAEs by severity and relationship to study medication will be 
summarized by treatment group. 
The proportion of subjects with TESAE, fatal SAEs ( ie, events that caused death), and AEs 
leading to permanent discontinuation of study medication will be summarized by System Organ 
Class ( SOC ), preferred term and treatment group 
Treatment emergent adverse events of interest will also be reported in terms of incidence rate per Patient Exposure Year ( PEY ). 
Listings will be presented of subjects with SAEs, subjects with AEs leading to discontinuation, and subjects who died. 
9.4.4.2 Clinical Laboratory Parameters 
Descriptive statistics for laboratory values and changes from BL  at each assessment time point 
will be presented by treatment group for each laboratory parameter. To assess potentially 
clinically meaningful laboratory abnormalities, the number and percentage of subjects with post-BL lab values outside a pre defined range or limit of change will be tabulated by treatment group.  
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 101 9.4.4.3 Vital Signs  
Descriptive statistics for vital signs (systolic and diastolic BP , pulse rate, respiration rate) and 
their changes from BL  at each visit and, the EOS  will be presented by treatment group. 
9.4.4.4 Electrocardiogram  
Descriptive statistics for ECG parameters ( eg, HR, PR interval, QRS interval, QT interval, QTc 
interval) at BL  and changes from BL  at each assessment time point will be presented by 
treatment group. To assess potentially clinically meaningful ECG abnormalities, the number and 
percentage of subjects with post- BL ECG values outside a pre defined range or limit of change 
will be tabulated by treatment group, as well as shift tables for results of ECG interpretation (normal, abnormal not significant, abnormal significant). 
9.5 Interim Data Cut  
There are currently no plans to conduct an interim data cut.  
Safety data and dosing decisions will be monitored on an ongoing basis. Additional ongoing 
review of safety data will be conducted by an independent DSMB (see Section 4.8).  
9.6 Statistical Analysis Plan  
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will provide details of the data analyses . As an open- label 
study the SAP will be finalized prior to accumulation of a substantial amount of data to ensure lack of bias.  Any significant changes to the analyses described in this protocol will be 
highlighted in the SAP and detailed in the Clinical Study Report.  
9.7 Protocol Deviations 
A protocol deviation is generally an unplanned excursion from the protocol that is not implemented or intended as a systematic change. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the study is conducted in accordance with the procedures and evaluations described in this protocol and must protect the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects. The investigator should not implement any deviation from, or changes of, the protocol, unless it is necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to trial subjects.  
Due to the unique nature of this study, following issues are not to be considered  as protocol 
deviations:  
• Given the complexity in EPO  dose adjustments and the need to take into account the 
various clinical parameters in EPO  dose titration, one would not consider it a protocol 
deviation when patients are dosed according to local standard of care whether or not it is 
concordant with  package insert/SmPC  
• Given the complexity  in Roxadustat dose adjustments and the need to take into account the various clinical parameters in Roxadustat dose titration, one would not consider it a protocol deviation when subjects are dosed based on their clinical circumstances whether  
or not  it is concordant with   the Roxadustat dose adjustment guidelines unless it was 
related to “excessive hematopoiesis” (Hb ≥13 g/dL, requires a dose -hold) or 
“Overdose”  (prescribed >3.0 mg/kg per dose or 400 mg per dose, whichever is lower ) 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 102 • ESA administrations in Roxadustat subjects during hospitalization are not to be reported 
as protocol deviation, if the roxadustat dosing were not allowed or available during that hospitalized period 
• IV iron administrations in study subjects during hospitalization are not be reported as 
protocol deviation 
For the purposes of this protocol, protocol deviations requiring notification to the Sponsor will be defined and detailed in the study monitoring plan.

FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 117 Appendix 2 Roxadustat Dose Adjustment Rules  
At each study visit during the Treatment Period, Hb will be measured (prior to dialysis in HD 
subjects) locally to determine the need for a dose adjustment or to assess for excessive 
hematopoiesis. This local Hb measurement may be made with the use of a point-of- care device 
(eg, HemoCue®, CritLine®) or by local laboratory (ie, Stat Lab*) testing  if the point-of- care 
device is not available or the result is considered unreliable. In the event that the Hb value of the visit as determined by the study central laboratory is significantly different from that measured locally, and per Investigator that warrants a reversal of the dose adjustment decis ion made earlier 
based on locally measured Hb value, the Medical Monitor should be informed, if possible.  
In this study, a rate of rise of Hb > 2 g/dL in 4 weeks or a Hb level of ≥  13 g/dl at any time 
would be considered as excessive haematopoiesis and would require either dose reduction or 
temporary dose hold.  
The dose of roxadustat will remain constant during the first 4 weeks of the T reatment Period 
unless a dose reduction is required for excessive hematopoiesis .  
Roxadustat dose adjustments are permitted from Week 4 onwards, and every 4 weeks thereafter 
(eg, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12); however, the dose may be adjusted between two pre specified 
windows ( eg, anytime between Week 4 and Week 8 visits, Week 8 and Week 12 visits ) if all of 
the following criteria are met: 
• No dose adjustment has been made in last 4 weeks 
• Hb <  9.0 g/dL.  
Any dose adjustment will re set the dose-adjustment window to every 4 weeks thereafter ( eg, 
dose adjustment for a qualified reason at Week 6 leads to next dose adjustment at Week 10). 
Dose adjustment must not be done sooner than 4 weeks unless discussed with and pre approved 
by the medical monitor. Dose adjustments for roxadustat are described in the table below.   
Subjects randomized to roxadustat will take doses TIW for the entire duration of the Treatment Period. I f a subject requires < 20 mg TIW (ie, < 60 mg per week) to maintain a Hb level of 
approximately 11 g/dL, the d osing frequency should be reduced in a step- wise fashion  e.g. TIW 
to BIW , BIW to  QW , QW to Q- 2 Week etc. The Medical Monitor should be notified as soon as 
possible of such dose change.

Abbreviations:  ↑ = increase; ↓  = decrease; Hb  = hemoglobin.  
Notes:  
Dose Increases and Reductions:  
• Dose increases (↑) and reductions (↓) are preset. 
• The dose steps are as follows: 20, 40, 50, 70, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, and 400 mg .  
For example, a subject previously receiving 70 mg of roxadustat requiring a dose increase would have his dose changed 
to100 mg of roxadustat . A subject previously receiving 150 mg of roxadustat requiring a dose reduction would have his 
dose changed to 10 0 mg of roxadustat.   
 If < 20 mg /dose is required, d osing frequency should be reduced in a step-wise fashion e.g. TIW to BIW, BIW to QW, 
QW to Q- 2 Week etc. 
• The maximum dose is capped at 400 mg or 3.0 mg/kg/dose (whichever is lower) . 
Dose Adjustment for Excessive Hematopoiesis:  
• If Hb increases by >  2.0 g/dL at any time within 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced by one dose step.  
• Only one dose reduction for excessive hematopoiesis is recommended within a period of 4 weeks.  
• Temporary dose hold s for excessive hematopoiesis should be confirmed based on central lab Hb assessments . If the Hb is 
≥ 13 g/dL, withhold dosing, check Hb weekly or per PI’s discretion via central lab , then resume dosing when 
Hb < 12.0 g/dL, at a dose that is reduced by one dose step . The s ubsequent Hb follow -up assessments should also be done 
by a central lab.  
* A “Stat lab" is to be used only for urgent  lab test that is needed for immediate decision making related to protocol, 
management of adverse events as determined by the Investigator.

FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 122 Appendix 4 Liver Safety Monitoring Assessment  
The guidelines described in this Section  are intended to enable early detection and action 
following abnormal liver function test ( LFT) results . Any subject enrolled in a clinical study with 
active drug therapy and reveals an increase of serum aminotransferases (AT) to > 3 × upper limit 
of norma l (ULN ), or bilirubin > 2 × ULN, should undergo detailed  testing (including at least 
alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ], aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ], alkaline phosphatase [ ALP ], 
and total bilirubin [ TBL]) for further evaluation and follow-up. Alerts will be generated by the 
central lab to inform the investigator, study monitor and study team. Testing should be repeated within 48-72 hours of notification. Subjects should be asked if they have any symptoms suggestive of hepatobiliary dysfunction. 
Definition of Liver Abnormalities  
Confirmed abnormalities should be characterized as follows: 
 ALT or AST   Total Bilirubin  
Moderate  > 3× ULN  or > 2× ULN  
Severea > 3× ULN and > 2× ULN 
Abbreviations:  ALT  = alanine aminotransferase; AST  = aspartate aminotransferase; ULN = upper limit of normal.  
a Hy’s Law: Drug -induced jaundice caused by hepatocellular injury, without a significant obstructive component, has a high 
rate of bad outcomes, from 10 % to 50% mortality (or transplant).” The two “requirements” for Hy’s Law are: 1) Evidence 
that a drug can cause hepatocellular -type injury, generally shown by an increase in transaminase elevations higher 3 times 
the upper limit of normal (“2 x ULN elevations are too common in treated and untreated subjects to be discriminating”) . 2) 
Cases of increased bilirubin (at least 2 x ULN) with concurrent transaminase elevations at least 3x ULN and no evidence 
of intra - or extrahepatic bilirubin obstruction (elevated alkaline phosphatase) or Gilbert’s syndrome . [Temple R. Hy's law: 
predicting serious hepatotoxicity. Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf 2006 Apr;15(4):241- 3.] 
In addition, the subject should be considered to have severe hepatic abnormalities for any of the 
following: 
• ALT or AST >  8× ULN  
• ALT or AST  > 5× ULN for more than 2 weeks  
• ALT or AST  > 3× ULN and  international normalized ratio  (INR) >  1.5 (i f INR testing is 
applicable/evaluated).  
• ALT or AS T > 3× ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophi lia (>  5%).  
The investigator may determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as described above, may qualify as moderate or severe abnormalities and require additional monitoring and follow-up. 
Follow- up Procedures  
Subjects with confirmed abnormal liver function results should be closely monitored and 
followed as described below. If close monitoring for LFTs in a subject is not possible, study drug should be discontinued. 
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -064 Amendment 2  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 123 Repeat LFTs 2 -3 times weekly, then weekly or less until abnormalities stabilize or return to 
within normal limits . LFTs should include ALT, AST, T BL and ALP 
In addition, evaluate the subject for potential causes, which may include the following: 
• Detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent di seases  
• Concomitant drug use, including nonprescription medications, herbal and dietary 
supplements, alcohol or recreational drug use, or special diets 
• Exposure to environmental chemical agents 
• Rule out acute viral hepatitis Types A,B,C,D,E; autoimmune or a lcoholic hepatitis; 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; biliary tract disease  
• Obtain additional tests as appropriate: eg, INR, GGT or direct bilirubin; ultrasound or 
other imaging to assess biliary tract disease  
• Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consultations 
In general, in the absence of an explanation for increased LFTs, such as viral hepatitis, preexisting or acute liver disease or exposure to other agents associated with liver injury, the 
study drug should be discontinued. 
Discontinuation of treatment should be considered if: 
• ALT or AST >  8 × ULN  
• ALT or AST >  5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks  
• ALT or AST >  3 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5) (If INR testing is 
applicable/evaluated)  
• ALT or AST >
 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%)  
Once LFTs return to normal, and depending on whether there is an explanation for the LFT elevations, study drug dosing may resume, after discussion with the Medical Monitor

FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 124 Appendix 5 Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Measurement Guidelines  
Blood Pressure 
Blood pressure (BP) measurement should be done with the subject comfortably seated in a chair, 
with the legs uncrossed, and the back and arm supported, such that the middle of the cuff on the upper arm is at the level of the right atrium (the midpoint of the sternum) . The subject should be 
instructed to relax as much as possible and to not talk during the measurement procedure; ideally, 5 minutes should elapse before the first reading is taken. Prefe rably measurement will be 
done with an electronic automated device. The same device should preferably be used for the subject during the course of the study, timing as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments. Also the same arm should be used consistently for readings throughout the study. 
Blood pressure should be measured in triplicate  (preferred) with at least one minute interval 
between the measurements . In subjects on HD, BP  should be measured a prior to the start of the 
dialysis procedure that day ( predialysis), preferably using the nondialysis arm. In  subjects on PD, 
BP should be measured approximately at the same time of the day at each visit .  
Heart Rate  
Heart rate measurement should be done at rest in a sitting position wherever possible. It can be 
performed with an electronic automated device as used for BP measurement . The same device 
should preferably be used for the subject during the course of the study, timing as indicated in the schedule of a ssessments. Hear t rate (HR) should be meas ured in triplicate  (preferred) with at 
least one minute interval between the measurements . In subjects on HD, HR  should be measured 
at pre dialysis and in subjects on PD and  should be measured approximately at the same time of 
the day at each visit.

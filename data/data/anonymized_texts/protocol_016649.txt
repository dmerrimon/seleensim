relevant pr eliminary findings or prior research by the investigator.   
Patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) live with a plethora of 
bothersome symptoms,1 of which are consequences of the severe 
cardiopulmonary deterioration of right -sided heart failure. Because PH 
pathophysiology is complicated due to multiple causes, PH  diagnosis is 
confirmed with right -sided cardiac catheterization documenting the 
elevation of mean pulmonary arterial pressure > 25 mmHg with 
pulmonary wedge pressure < 15 mmHg.2 There are five etiological 
classifications of PH: idiopathic (Class I), due t o left -heart diseases (Class 
II), due to lung diseases (Class III), due to chronic thrombolytic/embolic 
diseases (Class IV), and other causes (Class V).2 Class I PH or pulmonary 
arterial hypertension (PAH) is considered the most severe form of PH and 
compr ises approximately 50% of the PH population. Regardless of the 
cause, normalizing pulmonary pressure using PH -specific drugs is the 
main objective of medical management. Little evidence is currently 
 Page 7 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 available regarding effective self -management strategies to reduce 
symptom burden among under -served racial minority (URM) patients with 
PH. Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of pharmacological treatment 
have shown to improve clinical outcomes, two critical ingredients often 
not available to URM adults. Amon g patients with a sub -type of PH, PAH 
(pulmonary arterial hypertension), African -Americans (AA) have higher 
mortality rates than Caucasians, and AA women had the highest mortality 
rates across all ages. (3.0, 3.1) Among patients diagnosed with incidental 
PH, AAs were younger with significantly higher right ventricular 
dysfunction and were more frequently covered by Medicare than private 
insurance. (3.2).  Therefore, URM PH patients are disproportionately 
affected by the disease: experiencing a significant b urden of healthcare 
needs related to existing health disparity and limited psychological, 
economic, and healthcare resources. (3.3, 3.4). Even though there have 
been tremendous medical and pharmacologic advances in PH treatment in 
the past decades, patient s continue to live with unmet psycho -social and 
behavioral health needs that impact their long -term prognoses. Despite 
these advancements, patients living with PH continue to suffer 
psychological distress such as depression, anxiety, and stress,4 -10, along  
with a high symptom burden.11,12 Poor physiologic conditions and high 
psychological distress are predictive of poor quality  of life among patients 
with PH.13 -16 The physiological and psychological distress often leads to 
challenges in successfully managin g PH conditions. A culturally tailored, 
innovative complementary health approach to addressing this gap is 
needed to augment symptom self -management, reduce symptom burden, 
promote health and wellness, and health -related quality  of life (HRQOL).  
Complemen tary Health Approach (CHA), defined as non -mainstream 
integrative therapy self -management practice of chronic conditions, has 
been shown to reduce symptom severity and improve quality  of life 
(https://nccih.nih.gov/health/integrative -health).17 A mindfulne ss-based 
stress reduction (MBSR) intervention program, which includes eight 2.5 -
hour-weekly sessions, has been shown to reduce depression and anxiety 
symptoms among patients with psychiatric conditions.18 Modified MBSR 
programs have shown effectiveness in symptom burden,19 fatigue,19 -22 
and HRQOL22 among persons with cancer. While patients with cancer 
and other chronic conditions use the mind -body intervention (MBI) to a 
greater extent, MBI use among patients with PH is somewhat limited and 
even more so amo ng URM adults with PH. A gentle walking exercise 
program is associated with improvements in six -minute walk distance, 
lung functions, depression, anxiety, and HRQOL.23,24 In a randomized 
controlled trial of 103 PAH patients, a 12-weeks progressive muscle 
relaxation program improved anxiety, depression, and HRQOL.25 Eight -
weeks of slow -paced breathing technique was associated with a reduction 
in depressive symptoms, improved sleep, and HRQOL.26 A pilot, 
randomized controlled trial of MBSR demonstrated some i mprovement in 
psychological symptoms (depression and anxiety).27 Pilot single -group 
 Page 8 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 testing of an Urban Zen Integrative Therapy (UZIT) is associated with 
symptom burden reduction and HRQOL improvement.28 In this UZIT 
study, there were pre -post session redu ctions in pain, anxiety, fatigue, and 
dyspnea, and pre -post UZIT program reductions in PH -related 
symptoms.28 These CHA 's show positive effects on the overall 
psychological health; however, practical implementation of CHA is 
limited to the patients ' abilit y to attend in -person sessions, adherence to 
prescribed home practice, and more importantly , availability of culturally 
tailored MBI content.  
Complementary Health Approach (CHA), such as in -person MBI, has 
moderate effects in reducing depression and anxiet y across chronic health 
conditions, including PH. However, these benefits were mostly 
demonstrated among participants who had high adherence to the 
intervention practice.27 Technology -assisted MBI (TeleMBI) has shown 
comparable efficacy with in -person MBI among persons with chronic 
conditions; TeleMBI has the added benefits of cost reduction and ease of 
implementation.29 -31 TeleMBI for patients with multiple sclerosis via 
skype shows improvement in HRQOL, depression, anxiety, and sleep 
disturbance when deli vered at a 5:1 ratio of participants and instructor.29 
TeleMBI for patients with spinal cord injury with depression and chronic 
pain was superior to psychoeducational intervention in reducing 
depressive symptoms, anxiety, pain, and improving HRQOL.30 Onlin e 
TeleMBI reduces depression and anxiety significantly compared to the 
control group among pregnant women with high depressive symptoms.31 
The use of TeleMBI via Mobile -APP among post ICU patients has 
comparable impacts on depression, anxiety, and post -traumatic distress 
symptoms to telephone -based mindfulness delivery.32 This pilot RCT 
study is advancing to a large -scale study to implement TeleMBI Mobile -
APP to treat post ICU symptoms. While mobile - and in -person MBI have 
comparable efficacy, we postulate that the mobile -MBI has the advantages 
of user -activated, "as needed " delivery, consistent dose delivery, and ease 
of use for symptom management for adults with PH. Clearly, given these 
advantages of mobile -MBI and in keeping with the social distancing 
demand of the current COVID -19 pandemic, it is imperative to test 
MMPH mobile MBI for PH in URM communities to address our research 
aims.  
MMPH is a TeleMBI program tailored for URM patients with PH. The 
intervention is modified from  an in-person  UZIT program  that showed clinical 
results in symptom severity reduction and HRQOL improvement among 14 adults 
with PH.28 This 8 -weeks program will engage participants, employing both 
instructor -led and self -guided delivery of mindfulness practices (via Zoom and 
APP) t o introduce and facilitate the training . Our experience in developing and 
modification of mobile -MBI APP is gleaned from current testing of a mobile -
MBI APP among high -stress college students and URM African -Americans 
participants in Buffalo, NY. Prelimina ry testing of mobile -MBI among URM 
adults with PH is invaluable from the perspective of addressing health disparity, 
 Page 9 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 making available a culturally tailored evidence -based intervention of Mindfulness 
for reduction of symptom burden and psychological stress reduction. More 
importantly, the mobile -MBI prototype can be modified and tailored with broader 
applications to other chronic cardiopulmonary conditions, such as chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Asthma, and COVID -19 long -haul.

5.0 Study Design * 
5.1 Describe and explain the study design  (e.g. case-control, cross -sectional, 
ethnographic, experimental, interventional, longitudinal, observational).  
This study will engage community -dwelling URM adults with PH living in  the 
United States . We will use a two -group comparative study design where 
waitlisted participants will serve as  controls. Considering a 20% attrition rate in a 
behavioral health intervention study, we aim to enroll a total of 20, with at least 
16 participants to address study aims (8 -10 in each Group).34 As a pilot study, 
power analysis is not necessary. Statistica l analysis will include descriptive 
statistics, mixed -effect modeling for repeated measures, and within -group and 
between -groups comparisons using t -tests or Wilcoxon signed -rank test as 
appropriate and Cohen 's d effect size calculation. Multi -time data co llection will 
be done via daily mobile -APP use.  
6.0 Study Intervention/Investigational Agent  
6.1  Describe the study intervention and/or investigational agent (e.g., 
drug, device) that is being evaluated.  
The MMPH program will include two Zoom -delivered sessions (Weeks #1 & #4), 
six video -recorded sessions (Weeks #2, #3, #5, #6, #7, #8), and daily mindfulness 
meditation practice  using a mobile  APP during  an eight -week study period. 
Similar to the UZIT intervention, each MMPH session will in clude Gentle Body 
Movement (GBM,10 -min), Restorative Pose (Pose,10 -min), and Body Awareness 
Meditation (BAM, 20 -min). Self -guided audio -video modules of various 
durations will be available according to participants ' preference and level of 
comfort (5, 10, 20 minutes). The mobile -APP content will reinforce Zoom content 
such as mindful breathing, GBM of upper extremities, GBM of lower extremities, 
Pose sitting, Pose lying, and BAM practices. The MMPH content will be tailored 
to health management needs specifi c to PH with cultural consideration of 
mindfulness -related concepts (stress, responding to stress, resiliency).  
 
 
6.2 Drug/Device Handling: If the research  involves drugs or 
device, describe your plans to store, handle, and administer those 
 Page 14 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 drugs or devices so  that they will be used only on subjects and be 
used only by authorized investigators.  
• If the control of the drugs or devices used in this protocol will 
be accomplished by following an established, approved 
organizational SOP (e.g., Research Pharmacy SOP f or the 
Control of Investigational Drugs, etc.), please reference that 
SOP in this section.  
Response: NOT APPLICABLE  
 
6.3 If the drug is investigational (has an IND) or the device has an IDE 
or a claim of abbreviated IDE (non -significant risk device), include 
the following information:  
• Identify the holder of the IND/IDE/Abbreviated IDE.  
• Explain procedures followed to comply with sponsor 
requirements for FDA regulated research for the following:

Response: NOT APPLICABLE  
 
7.0 Local Number of Subjects  
7.1 Indicate the total number of subjects t hat will be enrolled or records t hat 
will be reviewed  locally.  
Response:  20 participants  
 
7.2 If applicable, indicate how many subjects you expect to screen to reach your 
target sample (i.e. your screen failure rate) .  
Response: Potentially eligible patients from UBMD clinic, URMC, RRH, as well 
as patients across the US  from sources such as  Research Match and Facebook  will  
be screened by research team at UB . Potentially eligible and interested PH 
patients will self -refer and contact us for screening.  We will also invited  PH 
patients across the US to participate in the study using additional recruitment 
sources such as Research Match, across the US CTSA Hub advertisement, and 
 Page 15 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 Social media (Facebook) advertisement. With the approved amendment to include 
all ethnicity, we wi ll be able to reach the target enrollment goal as planned. Our 
enrollment goal is  20 patients.  
 
7.3 Justify the feasibility of recruiting the proposed  number of eligible  subjects 
within the a nticipated  recruitment period. For example, how many potential 
subjec ts do you have access to? What percentage of those potential subjects 
do you need to recruit?  
Response: An enrollment rate to a mind -body intervention is approximately 30% , 
yielding  about 103 participants . Considering a 15% attrition rate, we will enroll 
20 participants to achieve at least 8 in each Group . We received verbal  
agreements from PH specialists at these locations  to assist in referring , of eligible 
participants in the st udy. 
 
8.0 Inclusion  and Exclusion Criteria * 
8.1 Describe the criteria that define who will be included  in your final study 
sample.   
NOTE:  This may be done in bullet point fashion . 
1) adults (>18 years), 2) PH confirmed by standard guidelines; 3) willingness to 
participate in the mindfulness practice program for the duration of the study 
period; 4) able to ambulate independently; 5) English -speaking , and 6) have 
access to a mobile phone.  
8.2 Describe the criteria that define who will be excluded  from y our final study 
sample.   
NOTE:  This may be done in bullet point fashion.  
1) known pregnancy; 2) have psychiatric conditions requiring hospitalization 
within the last year; 3) deaf or hard of hearing.    
 
8.3 Indicate specifically whether you will include any of the following special 
populations  in your study  using the checkboxes below .   
 
NOTE:  Members of special populations may not be targeted for enrollment  in 
your study unless you indicate this in your inclusion criteria.  
Response:   
☐ Adults unable to consent  
☐ Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers)  
☐ Pregnant women  
☐ Prisoners  
 Page 16 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19  
8.4 Indicate whether you will include non -English speaking individuals  in your 
study .  Provide justification if you will exclude non -Engli sh speaking 
individuals .  
In order to meet one of the primary ethical principles of equitable selection 
of subjects, n on-English speaking individuals may not be routinely excluded 
from research  as a matter of convenience.  
In cases where the research is of therapeutic intent  or is designed to 
investigate areas that would necessarily require certain populations who 
may not speak English, the researcher is required to make efforts to recruit 
and include non -English speaking individuals.  However , there are studies 
in which it would be reasonable to limit subj ects to those who speak 
English .  Some examples include pilot studies, small unfunded studies with 
validated instruments not available in other languages, studies with 
numerous que stionnaires , and some non -therap eutic studies which offer  no 
direct benefit.  
The study will exclude non -English speaking individuals because the 
questionnaires used to obtain data are available in English format. Furthermore, 
the intervention will be deliver ed in the English language only.  
 
9.0 Vulnerable Populations * 
If the research involves special populations that are considered vulnerable,  
describe the safeguards included to protect their rights and welfare.    
NOTE: You should refer to the appropriate checklists, referenced below, to ensure you 
have provided adequate detail regarding safeguards and protections. You do not, 
however, need to provide these checklists to the IRB.  
9.1 For research that involves pregnant women, safeguards include:  
NOTE CHECKLIST:  Pregnant Women (HRP -412) 
Response:  
  
☒ N/A:  This research does not involve pregnant women.  
9.2 For research that involves neonates of uncertain viability or non-viable 
neonates , safeguards include:  
NOTE CHECKLIST S: Non-Viable N eonates (HRP -413), or Neonates of Uncertain 
Viability (HRP -414) 
Response:  
 
☒ N/A:   This re search does not involve non-viable neonates o r neonates of  
uncertain viability.  
9.3 For research that involves prisoners , safeguards include:  
 Page 17 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 NOTE  CHECKLIST: Prisoners  (HRP -415) 
Response:  
 
☒ N/A:   This research does not involve prisoners.  
9.4 For research that involves persons who have not attained the legal age for 
consent to treatments or procedures involved in the research ( "children "), 
safeguards include:   
NOTE CHECKLIST: Children (HRP -416) 
Response:  
 
☒ N/A:   This research does not involve persons who have not attained the 
legal age for consent to treatments or procedures ( "children "). 
9.5 For research that  involves cognitively impaired adults , safeguards include:  
NOTE CHECKLIST: Cognitively Impaired Adults (HRP -417) 
Response:  
 
☒ N/A:   This research does not involve cognitively impaired adults.  
9.6 Consider if other specifically targeted p opulations such as students, 
employees of a specific firm , or educationally  or economically 
disadvantaged persons  are vulnerable.   Provide information regarding 
their safeguards and protections, including safeguards to eliminate 
coercion or undue influence.  
Our target population is adults with PH li ving throughout the United States . There 
is a high likelihood that our  study participant s may include economically 
disadvantaged persons. The study recruitment and enrollment process will occur 
in collaboration with PH doctors and nurses from these 3 locat ions and across the 
country who are likely aware  of their vulnerability. We will follow the 
standardize d and consistent approach in presenting the study material and 
remuneration for their participation. We will provide a s ufficient amount of time 
and info rmation to consider their involvement  in the study.  
 
10.0 Eligibility Screening * 
10.1 Describe screening procedures  for determining subjects ' eligibility.  
Screening refers to determining if prospective participants meet inclusion and 
exclusion criteria.   
Include all relevant screening documents with your submission (e.g. screeni ng 
protocol, script, questionnai re).  
Screening for inclusion criteria includes a YES response to the following 
questions:  
Is the subject have a  current diagnosis of pulmonary hyper tension ? 

 Page 18 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 Is the subject > 18 years old  
Does the subject have access to an electronic device: iPhone, iPad, 
Android Phone, Laptop?  
Is the subject proficient in English?  
 
Screening for exclusion criteria includes a YES  response to the following 
questions:  
Has the subject been hospitalized for a psychiatric reason during the past 
12 months?  
Is the subject hearing -impaired?  
Is the subject pregnant? (for female person)  
1. Via our re ferring partners  and electronic advertisements (using 
Research  Match, CTSA Hub advertising and socia l media [e.g., 
Facebook]) , participants  will re ceive an invitation to participate in the 
study. All communications in clude the contact information to the PI of the 
study , email address and phone number.  
2. Participant s may contact the research coordinator by the included phone 
number or email  address  if they w ant to learn more about the study. A 
research team member will contact the interested participant and arrange a 
convenient time for a Zoom meeting . 
3. During the Zoom meeting , the research staff member will describe the 
study and review the consent document. If the  participants decides to 
participate in the study, the research staff will  obtain  verbal informed 
consent.  
4. The participant will be provided a link (via email or text) to the 
REDC ap database  to complete a screening questionnair e. 
 
☐ N/A:   There is no screening as part of this protocol.  
11.0 Recruitment Methods  
☐ N/A:   This is a records review only, and subjects will not be 
recruited.  NOTE:  If you select this option, please make sure that 
all records review proc edures  and inclusion/exclusion screening 
are adequately described  in other sections.  
11.1 Describe when, where, and how potential subjects will be recruited.   
NOTE:  Recruitment refers to how you are identifying potential participants and 
introducing them to the study .  Include specific methods you will use (e.g. 
searching charts for specific ICD code numbers, Research Participant Groups, 
posted advertisements, etc.) . 
 Page 19 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 There are two ways we will make the study known to potential eligible 
participants (1) They may hear about  the study from their PH doctors during 
routine clinic visits  (2) They may see study f lyers  in recruiting partners’ offices  or 
clinics during their routine  care.   
Even though we originally proposed that PH doctors send out emails inviting their 
patients to contact us for potential enrollment, none of the doctors used the letter. 
They chose to tell their patients about the study verbally, and we only got one 
referral from RRH. That was the recruitment process we did. As I previously 
indicated, we are no longer enrolling and will not use it. We only want to 
complete the study.  
Electronic recruitment will include direct email sent using  the University at 
Buffalo’s Clinical and Translational Science Institute ’s (CTSI)  Buffalo Research 
Registry  and social media (Facebook) . The registry includes names of in dividuals 
who have expressed interest in participating in research studies.  Facebook -based 
recruitment will consist of advertisements for the study.  
Flyers will be distributed to  our referring partners and will be recruited by PH 
physician referral, self -referral, the use of Buffalo Research Registry, CTSA Hub 
advertisement, Social Media posts (Faceb ook), and Research  Match . Flyers will 
be placed by the Research Coordinator at their locations ( our referring partners at 
URMC and RRH ). These flyers will be  made available in waiting rooms as well 
as in healthcare professionals’ offices.  
In both recruitment methods, interested participants will contact the study team 
directly to initiate the screening as described in section 10.1.  None of the referring 
partners will participate in any screening activities, only referrals.  
 
11.2 Describe how you will protect  the privacy inter ests of prosp ective subjects 
during the recruitment process .   
NOTE:  Privacy refers to an individual 's right to control access to him or herself.    
The recruitment email and flyer information offers individuals the freedom to 
participate in  the study  only if they are interested in doing so.  
Screening i nterviews will take place by Zoom and will be  recorded. Recordings 
will be destroyed after transcripts are created . Participants may take part in the 
interview at a place and time of their choosing.  
Potential research participants will know about the study from PH 
providers, paper brochures, Buffalo Research Registry, or the 
ResearchMatch registry. Researchers will make initial contact with 
potential participants only after a clear indication that they a re interested 
to learn more about  the study. These indications are referral from their PH 
provider, email or phone contact from the participants, or "yes" response 
through the ResearchMatch registry.  
(Please refer to the Recruitment and Enrollment Protocol ) 
 Page 20 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 After the Introductory meeting, if prospective participants decline to 
participate in the study, the research staff will destroy any personal 
information written down on paper or delete electronic notes. If they 
express interest and want to meet for the Zoom Consent meeting, we will 
keep their information as a reference for that meeting. After the Zoom 
Consent meeting, if prospective participants decline to participate in the 
study, the research staff will destroy any personal information written 
down on paper or delete electronic notes immediately. We will only keep 
the documentation if they agree to participate in the study.  
After enrollment, e ach subject in all phases of the study will be assigned a 
unique study identification number to be used on all f orms. All personally 
identifiable information will be kept strictly confidential.  
Prospective eligible participants will have access to a written version of the 
consent form that the IRB has approved . There will be instruction for the 
participant  to read the consent form to gain a further, detailed understanding of 
what the study is about, study participation requirement, and other general 
information about the human research subject. The participant  will then contact 
the study coordinator to set a convenient time for a virtual meeting or phone call, 
providing verbal informed consent . 
We will keep a ll records about  the recruitment process in password -protected data 
files according to each institution. Only staff members who are involved in this 
research  will have access to this recruitment record.  
 
11.3 Identify any  materials that will be used to recruit subjects.  
NOTE:  Examples include scripts for telephone calls, in person announcements / 
presentations, email invitations.  
For advertisements, includ e the final copy of printed advertisements  with your 
submission . When advertisements are taped for broadcast, attach the final 
audio/video tape.  NOTE:  You may submit the wording of the advertisement prior 
to taping to ensure there will be no IRB -required revisions,  provided the IRB also 
reviews and approves the final version .

12.0 Procedures Involved * 
12.1 Provide a description of all research procedur es or activities  being 
performed and when they are performed  once a subject is screened and 
determined to be eligible . Provide as much detail as possible.    
NOTE:  Th is should serve as a blueprint for your study and includ e enough detail 
so that another investigator could pick up your protocol and replicate the research .  
For studies that have multiple or complex visits or procedures, consider the 
addition of a schedul e of events table in in your response .

17.0 Other Approvals  
17.1 Describe any approvals that will be obtained p rior to commencing the 
research (e .g., school, external site , funding agency, laboratory, radiati on 
safety, or biosafety ). 
Response:  
 
☒ N/A:   This study does not require any other approvals.  
18.0 Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
18.1 Describe how you will protect subjects ' privacy interests  during  the course 
of this research . 
NOTE:  Privacy refers to a n individual 's right to control  access to him or herself.  
Privacy applies to th e person.  Confidentiality refers to how data collected about 
individuals for the research  will be protected by the researcher from release.  
Confidentiality applies to the data.   
Examples of appropriate responses include: "participant only meets with a s tudy 
coordinator in a classroom setting where no one can overhear ", or "the participant 
is reminded that they are free to refuse to answer any questions that they do not 
feel comfortable answering ."   
To protect participants ' privacy interests and safety during the study, a research 
team member  will only contact the participan ts on the phone in a private office 
where no one can overhear the conversation. Any email communications with 
participants will be kept private and confidential. All data collected during the 
study will be stored on a secure, password -protected cloud that only the research 
team has access  to. 
About  Zoom communication, p articipant s will meet with a study coordinator from 
the privacy of their home where no one can overhear the discussion about their 
participation in the study. Participants will be reminded no t to discuss any 
personal information outside of the group discussion during the Zoom 
intervent ion. 
The participant will be reminded that they are free to refuse to answer any 
questions that they do not feel comfortable answering.  
18.2 Indicate how the research team is permitted to access any sources of 
information about the subjects.    
 Page 27 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 NOTE:  Examples of appropriate responses include:  school permission for review 
of records, consent of the subject, HIPAA waiver.   This question does apply  to 
records reviews . 
Sources of information about the subjects before  enrollment will only be 
accessible to PH doctors. Once enrolled, research data will be stored in Research 
Files at UBSON , and only research team members (PI, co -I, RA) will have 
access. There will be no need for medical record review because the outcome data 
will be participant -reported outcomes (symptom presence, symptom severity, 
quality of life).   
 
19.0 Data Management  and Analysis * 
19.1 Describe the data analysis plan, including any statistical  procedures.   This 
section applies to both quantitative and qualitative analysis.  
As a pilot study, power analysis is not necessary. Statistical analysis will include 
descriptive statistics, mixed -effect modeling for repeated measures, and within -
group an d between -groups comparisons using t -tests or Wilcoxon signed -rank test 
as appropriate and Cohen 's d effect size calculation. Multi -time data collection 
will be done via daily mobile -APP use.  
We will follow the standard procedure in quantitative data anal ysis that 
includes general data inspection to verify the accuracy, completeness, and 
normality of the dataset using the SPSS23 program. We will compare 
clinical outcomes within -group (pre -post) as well as between groups in the 
post-intervention period. We will follow the recommendation of 
inappropriate statistical analysis and interpretation specific to each survey. 
For continuous variables, we will use a paired student t -test, independent 
t-test analytical approaches. For categ orical variables and non -normally 
distributed variables, we will use non -parametric statistical methods (X2). 
Frequency distributions will be produced for all variables, and 
demographic information will be used to describe the sample. The impact 
of the M -App use on outcome variables will be analyzed using paired t -
test and repeated measure ANOVA.  
Qualitative data (focused -group interview data) will be analyzed using the 
standard qualitative thematic analysis procedure. We will transcribe the 
audio -recorded data and upload it into NViVo data management system. 
We will adhere to the thematic analysis method, described as follows:  
1. A researcher will read and re -read the entire text to get a general sense 
of the participants ' whole experience of being a stude nt during the 
COVID -19 pandemic. While reading through the transcript, the researcher 
will take initial notes and perform a general review  to get familiar with the 
data before analyzing the data.  
2. The researcher will descriptively open code by dividing the significant 
text segments into 'meaningful units ', keeping the participants ' own words. 
The researcher will re -read all the codes again to eliminate redundancies. 
 Page 28 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 The comparative discussion of these codes with other research team 
members to achieve a c onsensus will provide a validation step.  
3. The researcher will use an inductive approach to look over the 
consensus codes, identify patterns among them, and start coming up with 
categories that describe 'critical moments, ' significant aspects of the 
expe riences.  
4. The researcher will categorize the codes into overarching elements and 
higher -level categories and then cluster similar categories into the related 
themes. To make sure that the themes are useful and accurately represent 
the data, the research er will return to the original data set and reflectively 
compare the categories against it.  
5. The researcher will discuss with the research team members to refine 
the themes and develop the central theme. The researcher will then define 
and name the cent ral theme by formulating its meanings and figuring out 
how it helps understand  participant s' experience s.  
6. Finally, the researcher will develop an overall description of the essence of the 
participants ' experience by merging the themes into the central theme/s in a 
flowing narration.  
19.2 If applicable, p rovide a power analysis.    
NOTE:  This may not apply to certain types of studies, including chart/ records 
reviews, survey studies, or observational studies.  This question is asked to elicit 
whether the inves tigator has an adequate sample size to achieve the study 
objectives  and justify a conclusion.   
NOT APPLICABLE  
 
19.3 Describe any procedures that will be used for quality control of collected 
data.  
We will set up the required data entry field within the M -App and 
REDCap function to ensure that the data entry is accurate and complete. 
Erroneous (out -of-range) data entry will be less likely, as controlled by the 
proper setup of the data fields. Also, t he system will remind participants to 
enter data into the required data field before proceeding to the following  
sections. A dedicated research coordinator will review data entry once a 
week to verify survey completion and confirm no missing data. In the c ase 
of missing data discovery, the research coordinator will contact and ask 
participants to complete it as soon as possible.  
Before the data analysis process, two researchers will review the dataset for 
accuracy and discuss any possible reliability issues  in data collection.  
20.0 Confidentiality *

21.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safet y of 
Subjects * 
☐ N/A:   This study is not enrolling subjects , or is limited to records review 
procedures only .  This section does not apply.  
 
NOTE:  Minimal risk studies may be required to monitor  subject safety if the research 
procedures include procedures that present unique risks to subjects that require 
monitoring.  Some examples include:  exercising to exertion, or instruments that elicit 
suicidality or substance abuse behavior.  In such  cases , N/A is not an acceptable 
respon se. 
 
21.1 Describe the plan to periodically evaluate the data collected regarding both 
harms and benefits to determine whether subjects remain safe.  
The PI will be responsible for safeguarding data integrity and safety 
monitoring for human subjects and communicating any negative outcomes 
or serious events to the IRB and other applicable offices/agencies.  
 Page 31 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 The research team will meet weekly to review participant data and accrual. If 
participant accrual or retention drop under the requirement to complete th e study, 
the PI and research team will discuss and develop strategies to overcome the 
identified issues. Record from the participants enrolled during each will be 
reviewed to ensure that all participants are eligible for the study. The research 
team will a lso monitor developments in the literature and results of related studies 
that may impact the participants or  the ethics of the research.  
21.2 Describe what data are reviewed, including safety data, untoward events, 
and efficacy data.  
To ensure the integrity of  the research study, we will review progress relevant to 
study recruitment and enrollment , intervention fidelity, clinical outcomes , and 
safety data. With the minimal to low risk associated with this research, there are 
no anticipated life-threatening adve rse events for this proposed research project. 
In the rare occurrence, it will be reported to the PI and research team immediately. 
Researchers will notify t he IRB within seven  days of the adverse event  
occurrence . A thorough investigation will be initiate d, including a review of the 
protocol to ensure no undue exposure to risk occurred.  
21.3 Describe any safety endpoints.  
There is a potential risk of emotional distress to participants when answering 
survey questions about symptoms or feelings. Although unlikely , participants may 
experience sensations of anxiety, depression, and worse physical symptoms. 
Participants will be instructed to rest and re -focus their attention from completing 
the survey in such a scenario . Suppose a participant expresses any distress, or the 
research team suspects the participant is experiencing distress for any reason 
during the research. In that case , the participant may be removed from the study 
and offered a referral to mental health services. The adverse events will be 
reported to the IRB by the PI within the required timeframe.  
21.4 Describe h ow the safety information will be collected (e.g., with case report 
forms, at study visits, by telephone calls with participants).  
The PI will collect safety data  during telephone calls with the pa rticipant(s) and 
during data collection from the participant 's self -evaluations.  
21.5 Describe t he frequency of safety data collection . 
Safety data collection occurs once every two weeks for eight weeks and one hour 
during the focus group interview.  
21.6 Describe w ho will review the safety data.  
The PI and research team will review the safety data.  
21.7 Describe t he frequency or periodicity of review of cumulative safety data.  
The review of cumulative safety data will occur weekly.  
21.8 Describe t he statistical tests for analyzing the safety data to determine 
whether harm is occurring.  
 Page 32 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 We will use d escriptive statistics (counts of the event) to determine the events of 
distress.  
21.9 Describe a ny conditions that trigger an immediate suspension of the 
research.  
We do not anticipate any situa tion that would trigger an immediate suspension of 
the study . 
22.0 Withdrawal of Subjects * 
☐ N/A:   This study is not enrolling subjects.  This section does not apply.  
 
22.1 Describe anticipated circumstances under which subjects may be withdrawn 
from the research without their consent.  
Participants may be withdrawn from the research without their consent if the PI or 
research team member  discovers a participant is in severe psychological distress 
or is admitted into the hospital for a psychiatric condition.  
22.2 Describe any procedures for orderly termination.    
NOTE:  Examples may include return of study drug , exit interview with clinician .  
Include whether additional follow up i s recommended for safety reasons for 
physical or emotional health . 
NOT APPLICABLE  
 
22.3 Describe procedures that will be followed when subjects withdraw from the 
research, including retention of already collected data, and partial 
withdrawal from procedures with continued data collection , as applicable . 
We will attempt to use all the available data obtained from all participants 
(intention to treat). Pre and post comparison of the experimental Group 
will be conducted as aggr egate means using all available data collected.  
When participants decide to leave the study, we will ask the m if they would allow 
us to use the data we have collected before their decision to withdraw. If the 
subjects agree to use the data, the collected d ata will be handled and analyzed the 
same as research data. If the participants do not allow the use of the data, we will 
make every attempt to destroy the data.  
23.0 Risks to Subjects * 
23.1 List the reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, hazards, or 
inconveniences to the subjects related to their participation in the research. 
Consider physical, psychological, social, legal, and economic risks.   Include 
a description of the probability, m agnitude, duration, and reversibility of the 
risks.  
NOTE :  Breach of confidentiality is always a risk for identifiable  subject  data.  
 Page 33 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 There are no  foreseeable physical risks, discomfort, hazard, or 
inconveniences to the subjects related to their participation in this 
research. However, there is potential physical harm if participants use the 
M-App in circumstances that require total attention, such as driving or 
operating heavy machinery. There is an inherent risk of participants 
becoming so relaxed and drift off into a sleep state, which may put them in 
danger during these activities. Therefore, we will instruct participants in 
the proper use of the  M-App a nd the environment/conditions they need to 
avoid practicing with the M-App.  
For a Zoom intervention group, there is always the chance that someone 
will share something someone else said (confidentiality breach). At the 
beginning of the interview, w e will remind participants not to share this 
information with anyone. (This information will be a part of the consent 
document , indicating  no guarantee that this may not occur).  
 
There is a potential risk of emotional discomfort to participants when answe ring 
survey questions about symptoms or feelings. Although unlikely, participants may 
experience sensations of anxiety, depression, and worse physical symptoms. 
Participants will be instructed to rest and re -focus their attention from completing 
the survey  in such a scenario . If needed, participants will be given the contact 
information in their local areas (according to their primary care doctors). 
Questionnaires included in this research study are standardized tools used widely 
with no reported adverse ha rm. Fatigue is possible when answering questions 
from a battery of questionnaires. However, most  surveys used in this study are 
shortened versions that generally require less than 10 minutes to complete.  
23.2 Describe procedures performed to lessen the probabil ity or magnitude of 
risks, including procedures being performed to monitor subjects for safety.  
To address potential physical harm (mentioned above), we will provide 
specific instructions on how to complete the M -App modules at home.  
To monitor s ubjects for safety risk , we will conduct weekly research 
meetings to review the progress of the research activity and any 
participants' safety concerns . We will create action plans to mitigate any 
issues that may arise.  
We wi ll employ all reasonable effor ts to protect the confidentiality of the 
participants ' protected health information. Identifiable data is immediately 
de-identified, and de -identified data is stored separately from identifiable 
data. We will keep participants ' names and other identifying information 
confidential when the data is prepared or oral or written publications.  
Specific to participants ' interview s, there is a potential risk of emotional distress 
due to the sensitive nature of the topics. We will provide a ll interviewed 
participan ts with information on mental health resources and support groups at the 
time of enrollment.  
 Page 34 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 23.3 If applicable, indicate which procedures  may have risks to the subjects that 
are currently unforeseeable.

taking part in the research.   Include the probability, magnitude, and 
duration of the potential benefits.   Indicate if there is no direct benefit.    
NOTE:  Compensation cannot be stated as a benefit.  
There are potential benefits that individual subjects may experience by taking part 
in the research. Based on existing literature reporting on the use of M -App, 
mindfulness practice can increase one 's level of Mindfulness that may help with 
focus and attention beneficial to their mental health and well -being . Participation 
in this study ma y benefit from stress and anxiety reduction, which can be helpful 
to their academic learning and  social interaction.  
25.0 Compensation for Research -Related Injury  
☒ N/A:   The research procedures for this study do not p resent risk of

☐ N/A:   This study is not enrolling subjects , or is limited to records 
review procedures only .  This section does not apply.  
☐ N/A:   There is no compensation for participation.  This sect ion 
does not apply.  
28.0 Consent Process  
28.1 Indicate whether you will be obtaining consent.    
NOTE:  This does not refer to consent documentation, but  rather  whether you will 
be obtaining permission from subjects to participate in a research study.   
Consent documentation is addressed  in Section 29 .0. 
☒ Yes (If yes, Provide responses to each question in this Section)  
☐ No (If no, S kip to Section 2 9.0) 
 
28.2 Describe w here the consent process will take place .  Include  steps to 
maximize subjects ' privacy.  
Once it is determined a participant is qualified, they will have access to a written 
version of the consent form that the IRB has approved . We will email a copy of 
the consent form to review at least two days before providing consent. They will  
gain a further, detailed understanding of the study,  participation requirement, and 
other general information about the human research subject  in the privacy of their 
homes . The c onsent process will take place during a virtual meeting between a 
member of the research team and the interested, eligible participant to review the 
content of the consent form. The research coordinator will put the consent form 
 Page 36 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 up on the screen and go thr ough it and then ask the participant to either orally 
agree or not. If they don 't consent, they may leave by logging out. If they stay, 
they are verbally demonstrating their consent. During this meeting, we will 
provide the participant wi th plenty of oppor tunities  to ask additional questions 
about the study.  If it is agreeable with the participant, the researcher will obtain 
verbal consent.  
28.3 Describe how you will ensure that subjects are provided with a sufficient 
period of time to consider taking part in t he research study.   
NOTE :  It is always a requirement that a prospective subject is  given sufficient 
time to have their questions answered and consider their participation.   See "SOP: 
Informed Consent Process for Research (HRP -090)" Sections 5.5 and 5.6 . 
The participant will receive a written consent form at least two days before  the 
virtual meeting between the eligible participant and the research coordinator. The 
participant will have sufficient time to ask further questions about the study 
during the meeting . If they are  unsure whether to participate  at that time,  they will 
be given an  additional day to decide their participation .  In such a case, the 
research coordinator can schedule an other  virtual meeting convenient  for the 
participant . 
28.4 Describe a ny process to ensure ongoing consent , defined as a subject 's 
willingness to continue par ticipation for the duration of the research study .   
Emails will be sent to the participants each week by the research team to remind 
participants of their volunteer status and ability to withdraw from participation at 
any time.  
28.5 Indicate whether you will b e following "SOP: Informed Consent Process for 
Research (HRP -090)." Pay particular attention to Sections 5.4 -5.9. If not,  or

SOP,  describe : 
• The role of the individuals listed in the application who are  involved in 
the consent process  
• The time that will be de voted to the consent discussion  
• Steps that will be taken to minimize the possibility  of coercion or 
undue influence  
• Steps that will be tak en to ens ure the subjects ' understanding  
We will be following HRP -900 with the exception that consent provisions will not 
be made to conduct consent in languages other than English even if this is 
preferred by the participant because we expect that the par ticipants will speak 
English sufficiently to understand the consent form.

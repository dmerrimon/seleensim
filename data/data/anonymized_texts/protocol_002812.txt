1. Master Protocol Summary  
Title  Master Protocol for Pragmatic  Trials utilizing the Surprise Question and Evaluating 
the Effect of Prompting Palliative Care Consultation  on Provider Referral Rates and 
Subsequent Outcomes for Hospitalized Adults  with Advanced Illness es. 
Brief Summary  This Master Protocol describes the general design features of a platform trial 
evaluating the effect of prompting palliative care consultation  on provider referral 
rates and  outcomes  for hospitalized adults with serious  illnesses . The Master 
Protocol provides the background and overarching approach to all trials to be 
conducted on this platform. This includes rationale for the choice of primary 
outcome s based on stage , general inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomization , 
intervention,  and blinding . The protocol also highlights expectations for  final 
analyses, sample size considerations, safety reporting, and data collection . In 
addition, the Master Protocol describes general principles for trial operations and 
oversight. Appendices to the Master Protocol provide  additional relevant 
information and identify patient  population s with serious illness (“clinical domains”)  
for whom the intervention will be evaluated , including additional eligibility criteria, 
sample size, and other features s pecific to the clinical domain . 
Study Design  Single center , pragmatic , randomized platform trial 
Study 
Population  Adult s with serious  illness admitted to the study hospital for whom the treating 
clinician would not be surprised if the patient died in the next 12 months.  
Inclusion Criteria  • Patient is an adult (age ≥ 18 years) . 
• Patient is admitted to the study hospital . 
• Patient meets criteria for serious illness in one or more clinical domain s, as 
specified in the clinical domain Appendix . 
• Patient’s treating physician, physician associate, or nurse practitioner 
answers “No” to a prompt in the electronic health record asking, “Would 
you be surprised if this patient died in the next 12 months?”  
Exclusion 
Criteria  • Patient is known to have received any VUMC palliative care consultation 
during the prior 3 months and /or the current admission.  
• Patient is known to be a prisoner  
• Patient meets any additional exclusion criteria , as specified in the clinical  
doma in appendices  
Trial Groups  • Palliative Care Consultation Prompt  Group  – The patient’s treating clinician  
will receive a prompt in the electronic health record encouraging the 
consideration of  a Palliative Care  consultation . 
• No Palliative Care Consultation Prompt  Group  – The patient’s treating 
clinician  will NOT  receive a prompt in the electronic health record 
encouraging the consideration of  a Palliative Care  consultation . 
Randomization  Eligible patients will be randomized to the Palliative Care Consultation Prompt 
Group or the No Palliative Care Consultation Prompt Group in a 1:1 ratio using the 
Epic coin toss tool in the electronic health record.

Primary 
Outcome s Stage 1: Percent age of patients with palliative care consults placed  within 48 hours 
after enrollment . 
Stage 2: Hospital -free days by day 90 , defined as the number of calendar days 
between enrollment and day 90 in which the patient is alive and outside of an 
acute -care hospital . 
Secondary 
Outcome  Survival to day 90 
Exploratory 
Outcomes  • Total number of days in the hospital by day 90  
• Total number of hospital admissions by day 90  
• Intensive care unit admission by day 90  
• Total number of days in the intensive care unit by day 90  
• Referral to  hospice by day 90  
• Emergency Department visits  
Process 
Outcomes  • Receipt of palliative care consultation  
• Time to receipt of palliative care consultation  
• Number of visits with palliative care team  
• Completion of advanced care planning upon admission as evidenced by 
POST form  
• Election of resuscitat ion status  (Do Not Resuscitate ( DNR ) and/or Do Not 
Intubate ( DNI)) 
Analys es Stage 1 : The primary outcome, percentage of patients with palliative care consults 
placed  within 48 hours after enrollment , will be evaluated for an anticipated 10%  of 
the total sample size . The following separations  between groups , during Stage 1 , 
would  then  determine trial progression to  Stage 2.  
• > 50% group separation : the trial would move forward to Stage 2 without 
modification.  
• 15-50% group separation: the trial would move forward to Stage 2 with 
modification to the eligibility criteria, intervention, or other aspects of the 
study protocol.  
• < 15% group separation: the trial would not move forward to Stage 2.  
We are explicitly examining the separation between groups for the primary 
outcome at Stage 1 and have outlined the trial progression scenarios. It is 
anticipated that all patients will have the same data collected and will be in cluded 
in the analys es for the primary, secondary, and exploratory outcomes.   
 
Stage 2: In the main analysis of the primary outcome, the number of hospital -free 
days by day 90  will be compared between patients in the two trial groups  using a 
Wilcoxon rank -sum test. Secondary outcomes will be compared between groups 
using a Wilcoxon rank -sum test for continuous variables and Chi -square  test for 
categorical variables . 
Sample Size  Various Appendi ces will specify a sample size for the respective clinical domain. The 
number of patients enrolled in all the clinical domains under this Master Protocol is 
anticipated  not to exceed 5,000 patients.

Expected 
Duration  Multiple patient populations can be actively enrolled concurrently for an 
anticipated 12 months. However, w e expect a sequential initial operationalization.  
2. Background  
Palliative Care for Serious  Illnesses  
Palliative care is specialized medical care focused on providing patients with relief from the symptoms, 
pain, and stress of serious illness , regardless of diagnosis, by anticipating, preventing, and treating 
suffering. The goal is to improve quality of life for both the patient and the patient’s family. Palliative 
care  is appropriate at any age and at any stage in a serious illness. It may be provided together with 
curative treatment, and includes intensive focus on symptom and pain management, psychosocia l and 
spiritual  support, and assistance in advance care planning.1-3  
 
In some studies, integration of palliative care  has been shown to : improve patient quality of life, sleep 
quality, and spiritual well -being; reduce depressive symptoms, healthcare costs and utilization, and 
aggressive interventions at the end of life; increase participation in advance care directives ; and increase 
lifespan.4,5 A recent phase 3 randomized controlled palliative care  trial in lung cancer patients showed 
that although fewer patients in the early palliative care  intervention arm received aggressive end -of-life 
care (33% vs 54%), median survival was longer comp ared to patients who received standard of care 
alone (11.6 months vs 8.9 months).4 Greater use of palliative care  may also decrease end of life care 
costs in Medicare patients .6 In an analysis of more than 5 ,000 patients from 8 hospitals, palliative care  
involvement was associated with a cost savings of $1,696 per admission for patients who survived 
hospitalization and $4,908 per admission for patients who did not survive hospitalization.7 However, 
there is a paucity of palliative care  effectiveness data fr om randomized controlled trials.  
 
A meta -analysis of palliative care  trials found 22 randomized controlled studies with 14 of these 
interventions being of palliative intent and only 8 utilizing a specialized palliative care  intervention. 
Overall, participants receiving palliative care  showed improvements in quality of life  (5 out of the 7 trials 
which examined quality of life  as a primary outcome), increased satisfaction with care (7 out of the 10 
trials which examined patient and caregiver satisfaction with care), and improved coping with physical 
symptoms (two trials that examined perceived symptom distress), with mixed find ings in physical and 
psychological symptom improvement.8 In oncology settings, specialist palliative care  interventions have 
demonstrated increased quality of life , decreased healthcare costs, and improved survival when 
initiated early in the course of can cer treatment.4, 9-11  Trials in heart failure have shown similar promise 
for palliative care interventions.12-15  
 
Despite the available evidence regarding the potential benefits of specialized palliative care across 
multiple serious illnesses, the incorporation of palliative care consultation into clinical practice in many 
settings is  inconsistent and often too late in the clinical trajectory .16,17  In an effort to introduce palliative 
care sooner and more consistently into patient’s care pathways, we will explore an interruptive provider 
nudge to prompt palliative care consideration  in key patient populations . This integrated approach will 
also help bridge the knowledge gap as to w hether systematic ally prompting palliative care consultation 
can improve referral rates and outcomes for patients with serious illness.

The processes  used to 1) identify hospitalized patients with serious illness , 2) query a provider about 
their  status,  and 3) prompt  consideration of palliative care consultation are amenable to conduct 
through the electronic health record. Step 1 will employ  phenotyping of clinical and admission 
characteristics readily extractable from the medical record. Step 2 will utilize the “Surprise Question” as 
a screening tool for  identification of potentia lly unmet palliative care needs. In our pilot trial and other 
studies of serious illness, patients for whom consideration of palliative care consultation might be 
appropriate have use d the “Surprise Question”, which asks the treating clinician “would you be 
surprised if this patient died in the next 12 months?”18-20 Step 3  will harness the capability to prompt a 
provider to conside r appropriately indicated , complementary,  supportive care that may be  otherwise  
underutilized  while managing the patient’s immediate health crisis . 
 
Given the preliminary evidence that specialist palliative care may improve the quality and quantity of 
time spent alive and outside of the hospital for patients with serious illness and the incomplete 
implementation of specialty palliative care in current clinical practice, we will evaluate the effect of 
prompting consideration of palliative care consultation in the electronic health record on provider 
referral rates to the palliative care service and hospital -free days among hospitalized patients with 
serious illness.  
 
3. Aims  and Hypotheses  
The overarching goal of the Master Protocol is to  investigate the effect of prompting consideration of 
palliative care  consultation through a best practice alert on provider referral rates to the palliative care 
service and clinical outcomes for hospitalized adults with serious illness.  In each clinical domain, we will 
test the hypothesis that prompting earlier palliative care  consultation improves the engagement of the 
palliative care teams and clinical outcomes compared to not prompting consideration of palliative care 
consultation .  
 
Primary Aim:  
To determine whether prompting consideration of palliative care consultation through the electronic 
health record impacts the number of palliative consultations placed and hospital -free days among 
hospitalized adults with serious illness.  
 
Primary Hypothesis:  
Prompting consideration of palliative care consultation through the electronic health record will 
increase both the number of palliative care consults placed and hospital -free days among hospitalized 
adults with serious  illness .

Inclusion :  
• Patient is an adult (age ≥ 18 years).  
• Patient is admitted to the study hospital.  
• Patient meets criteria for serious  illness in clinical domain  of interest , as specified in the clinical 
domain appendix.  
• Patient’s treating physician, physician associate, or nurse practitioner answers “No” to a prompt 
in the electronic health record  asking, “Would you be surprised if this patient died in the next 12 
months?”  
 
Exclusion : 
• Patient  is known to have received any VUMC palliative care consultation during the prior 3 
months and /or the current admission.  
• Patient is known to be a prisoner.  
• Patient meets any additional exclusion criteria, as specified in the clinical domain appendices.  
 
6. Consent  
Because this study of an alert in the electronic health record prompting clinicians to consider palliative 
care consultation for hospitalized adults with serious illness involves no more than incremental risk, 
could not practically be carried out without a waiver of the requirement for informed consent, and will 
not adversely affect the rights or welfare of the subjects, we will request that the trial be performed 
with waiver of the requirement for informed consent.  
• Minimal risk  of the research  – For all patients in this study, the decision of whether to request 
a palliative care consultation will be made by the patient’s treating clinician, as it would be in 
clinical care outside of the research. This study examines a clinical decision support tool in the 
electronic health record prompting the clinician to consider whether to request a palliative 
care consultation. A clinician decision support tool that collates clinically available  information 
about the patient for t he provider (i.e., the serious illness and the likelihood of death over the 
next 12 months) to prompt consideration of a palliative care consultation  involves no more 
than minimal incremental risk compared to the providers’ own synthesis of information within 
the clinical care outside of the research.  
• Impracticability of conduc ting the research without a waiver of informed consent  - This 
research could not be practicably conducted without a waiver of informed consent for two 
reasons. First, this study evaluates use of a clinical decision support tool that continuously and 
automatically screens hospitalized adults for serious illness and prompts clinicians in real -time 
to consider whether palliative care consultation would be beneficial for the patient.  Obtaining 
written informed consent from patients be fore the clinical decision support tool identifies the 
patients as having serious illness and displays the prompt to their treating clinician would be 
logistically infeasible. Second, the study is designed to evaluate whether prompting of 
consideration of palliative care consultation affects outcomes. Obtaining informed consent for 
a study involving palliative care consultation would, in and of itself, prompt added 
consideration of palliative care consultation, thus biasing the results of the study and 
increasing t he chances of missing a true effect from the intervention.

• A waiver will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of patients  – All patients enrolled in 
the study would be eligible for palliative care consultation in clinical care. For all patients in the 
study, the treating clinician will determine whether a palliative care consultation is indicated. In 
both arms of the study , the clinician  will retain autonomy to provide the appropriate clinical 
care. All patients may request or decline a palliative care consultation at any time. No data are 
generated for this study beyond those generated as a part of clinical care. Thus, the rights and 
welfare of patients are not affected.  
 
7. Study Sites, Enrollment , and Randomization  
Recruitment Best Practice Advisories (BPAs) are one of the native Epic tools available to support 
research recruitment. Recruitment BPAs can be “silent”, meaning they run in the background and 
perform automated actions without interrupting user workflow, o r user -facing. Recruitment BPAs are 
built using pre -defined study inclusion/exclusion criteria, e.g.,  demographics, conditions, medications, 
lab results, etc.  When a patient matches the pre -defined study inclusion/exclusion criteria, the BPA is 
triggered t o alert predefined providers or staff who then further review the patient’s chart for any 
additional screening. If the patient is eligible, the patient will automatically be enrolled in the trial 
(anticipated under a waiver of consent) and randomized.  The outline of the BPA specific to this trial is 
described  below.  
 
The study will occur in the adult hospital at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. A best practice advisor 
will screen the electronic health record to identify patients who meet all inclusion criteria and no 
exclusion criteria. When a patient appears to m eet the eligibility criteria, the best practice advisor will 
ask the treating clinician the Surprise Question. If the answer to the Surprise Question is “No”, then the 
patient will be enrolled in the trial. Patients who are enrolled in the trial will be ra ndomized in a 1:1 ratio 
to the 'Palliative Care Consultation Prompt Group ’ or the ‘No Palliative Care Consultation Prompt Group ’ 
by the Epic coin toss.  For patients deemed ineligible at  the time of screening, they will be rescreened 
upon each eligible inpatient visit to VUMC. Enrolled patients will not be rescreened upon subsequent 
inpatient hospitalization . The process for screening, enrollment, and randomization is displayed in the 
figure below:

8. Study Procedures  
8.1 Palliative Care Consultation Prompt Group  
When a patient is randomized to the Palliative Care Consultation Prompt Group , a clinical decision 
support tool in the electronic health record will inform the treating clinician of the patient’s serious 
illness and the results of the Surprise Question and prompt the treating clinician to consider a palliative 
care consultation . The goal of this prompt is to encourage appropriate palliative care engagement. If the 
treating clinician feels a palliative care consultation would be indicated for the patient, the clinical 
decision support tool will facilitate the placement of a palliative care consultation by the treating 
clinician. As per usual care, the treating clinical team will then discuss  elements of  palliative care and the 
goals of the consult with the patient.  The palliative care consultation will aim to provide best practices 
for supporting patients with serious  illnesses , which is described in detail in the Appendix , Framework 
for Best Practices of (Inpatient) Palliative Care Consultation . If the treating clinician feels that a palliative 
care consultation would not be indicated, then the clinical decision support will record a reason for why 
a palliative care consultation is not indicated. A treating clinician can choose to place or disconti nue a 
palliative care consultation at any time , retaining full autonomy to deliver the appropriate patient care . 
A patient may choose to request or decline a palliative care consultation at any time.  
 
8.2 No Palliative Care Consultation Prompt Group  
When a patient is randomized to the No Palliative Care Consultation Prompt Group , no prompt will 
occur. A treating clinician can choose to place or discontinue a palliative care consultation at any time. A 
patient may choose to request or decline a palliative care consultation at any time.

Primary Investigator: Mohana Karlekar, MD , FACP, FAAHPM  
 
All data on baseline characteristics, receipt of interventions, and outcomes will be extracted from the 
electronic health record, electronic data warehouse, or other publicly available sources (e.g., Tennessee 
Department of Health, Center s for Disease Control, Tennessee Hospital Association).  The Research 
Derivative is a database of clinical and related data derived from the Medical Center’s clinical systems 
and restructured for research. Data is repurposed from VU’s enterprise data warehouse, which includes 
data from StarPanel, VPIMS, and ORMI S (Operating Room Management Information System), EPIC, 
Medipac, and HEO among others. The medical record number and other person identifiers are 
preserved within the database. Data types include reimbursement codes, clinical notes and 
documentation, nursi ng records, medication data, laboratory data, encounter and visit data, among 
others. Output may include structured data points, such as ICD 9 codes or encounter dates, semi -
structured data such as laboratory tests and results, or unstructured data such as  physician progress 
reports. The database is maintained by the Office of Research Informatics under the direction of Paul 
Harris, Ph.D. The minimum  necessary data containing patient or provider identities will be collected. All 
data will be uploaded into a  password -protected computerized database maintained within a secure, 
web -based application for building and managing online databases (REDCap) or stored on secure servers 
with user -level access control.  
 
10. Outcome Measures  
10.1 Primary Outcome  
Stage 1:  The primary outcome will be the p ercentage of patients with palliative care consults placed  
within 48 hours after enrollment . This initial stage is designed to determine feasibility and separation 
between groups .  We are explicitly examining the separation between groups for the primary outcome 
at Stage 1 and have outlined the trial progression scenarios. It is anticipated that all patients will have 
the same data collected and will be included in the analyses for t he primary, secondary, and explor atory 
outcomes.  
Stage 2:  The primary outcome will be h ospital -free days by day 90. Hospital -free days will be defined as 
the number of calendar days between enrollment and day 90 in which the patient is alive and outside of 
an acute -care hospital . Days spent at home, at a rehabilitation facility, at a nursing facility, and at an 
inpatient hospice facility will count as hospital -free.  Hospital -free days has been recommended as a 
patient -centered outcome for trials among seriously ill patients .21   
 
10.2 Secondary Outcomes  
Secondary outcomes for this trial include the following:  
• Survival to day 90 
 
10.3 Exploratory Outcomes  
Exploratory  outcomes for this trial include the following:  
• Total number of days in the hospital by day 90  
• Total number of hospital admissions by day 90  
• Intensive care unit admission by day 90  
• Total number of days in the intensive care unit by day 90

• Referral to  hospice by day 90  
• Emergency Department visits  
 
10.4 Process Outcomes  
Process  outcomes for this trial include the following:  
• Receipt of palliative care consultation  
• Time to receipt of palliative care consultation  
• Number of visits with palliative care team  
• Completion of advance care planning  upon admission as evidenced by POST form  
• Election of resuscitat ion status  (Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) and/or Do Not Intubate (DNI))  
 
11. Risks and Benefits  
Potential Risks : In this study of a clinical decision support tool prompting a clinician to consider palliative 
care consultation, the treating clinician determines whether a palliative care consultation is indicated. 
Patients may request or decline a palliative care consultation at any point. There are no known risks 
associated with use of a clinical decision support tool prompting a clinician to consider whether 
palliative care consultation is indicated. The provider will retain the autonomy to decide the appropriate 
clinical care for their patient. The loss of confidentially associated with the use of clinically collected  PHI 
is a potential risk. This risk is minimized by the collection and management of data in the secure, online 
database.  
 
Potential Benefits : For some patients with serious illness, specialty palliative care has been shown to 
improve physical and emotional symptoms  and decrease the time spent in the hospital . It is possible 
that a clinical decision support prompting consideration of palliative care consultation may increase  the 
number and timeliness of appropriate referrals to the palliative care service and subsequently  the 
number of days outside the hospital and improve physical and emotional symptoms for patients.  The 
resu lts of the trial may improve care for thousands of patients with serious illness across the United 
States each year.  
 
12. Statistical Considerations  
Power and Sample Size Considerations : The sample size and power calculation for each clinical domain 
will be specified in the corresponding Appendi ces. The cumulative sample size of all the clinical domains 
together is anticipated not to exceed 5,000 patients.  
 
Statistical Analysis Plan : A statistical analysis plan for each clinical domain will be made publicly available 
before the conclusion of enrollment. General principles of the statistical analysis are outlined here.   
Stage 1 will evaluate the primary outcome , percentage of patients with palliative care consults placed  
within 48 hours after enrollment , for an anticipated  10%  of the total sample size . This initial stage is 
designed to determine feasibility and separation between groups. The following separations between 
groups , during Stage 1,  would then determine trial progression to  Stage 2.  
• > 50% group separation: the trial would move forward to Stage 2 without modification.  
• 15-50% group separation: the trial would move forward to Stage 2 with modification to the

eligibility criteria, intervention, or other aspects of the study protocol.  
• < 15% group separation: the trial would not move forward to Stage 2.  
We are explicitly examining the separation between groups for the primary outcome at Stage 1 and 
have outlined the trial progression scenarios. It is anticipated that all patients will have the same data 
collected and will be included in the analyses for t he primary, secondary, and exploratory outcomes.  
 
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants (i.e., age, sex, race, comorbidities, 
disease severity, etc.) will be compared between the control and the intervention arms using Wilcoxon 
rank -sum test for continuous variables and Pearson’s Chi -square for categorical variables.  The main 
analysis will be an intention -to-treat comparison of the primary outcome between patients randomized 
to each of the two trial groups using a Wilcoxon rank -sum test . The main analysis of the secondary 
outcome will be an intention -to-treat comparison of the secondary outcome of survival to 90 days 
between the two trial groups using a Cox Proportional -Hazards model.  
 
13. Privacy and Confidentiality  
At no time during this study, its analysis, or its publication will patient identities be revealed in any 
manner. The minimum necessary data containing patient or provider identities will be collected. As 
quick ly as feasible, all data collected will be uploaded into a password -protected computerized database 
maintained within a secure, web -based application for building and managing online databases 
(REDCap) or stored on secure servers with user -level access con trol. All patients will be assigned a 
unique study number for use in the computerized database. At the time of publication all identifiers will 
be removed.  
 
14. Follow up and Record Retention  
Patients will be followed until complete data are available regarding clinical care and outcomes between 
enrollment and 90 days after enrollment. During the study and analyses, data will be stored in a secure, 
online database. At the time of publication, a ll identifiers will be removed and a fully deidentified 
dataset will be stored indefinitely to allow replication of the results.  
 
15. Safety Monitoring and Adverse Events  
15.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
Adverse Event – An adverse event will be defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in 
a human subject temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not 
considered related to the subject’s participation in the research. Any adverse event occurring during the 
research will be classified according to the following characteristics:  
 
● Seriousness – An adverse event will be considered “serious” if it:  
o Results in death  
o Is life -threatening (defined as placing the patient at immediate risk of death)  
o Results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
o Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
o Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect or  
o Based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient’s health , and

Effect of Prompting Palliative Care Consultation on Provider Referral Rates and Subsequent Outcomes 
for Hospitalized Adults with Serious Illnesses  
Primary Investigator: Mohana Karlekar, MD , FACP, FAAHPM  
 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes 
listed in this definition.  
 
● Unexpectedness – An adverse event will be considered “unexpected” if the nature, severity, or 
frequency is neither consistent with:  
o The known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the procedures 
involved in the research that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as 
the IRB -approved research protocol; nor  
o The expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of 
the subject experiencing the adverse event and the subject’s predisposing risk factor 
profile for the adverse event.  
 
● Relatedness – The strength of the relationship of an adverse event to a study intervention or 
study procedure will be defined as follows:  
o Definitely Related : The adverse event follows (1) a reasonable, temporal sequence from 
a study procedure AND (2) cannot be explained by the known characteristics of the 
patient’s clinical state or other therapies AND (3) evaluation of the patient’s clinical 
state indicates to the investigator that the experience is definitely related to study 
procedures.  
o Probably or Possibly Related : The adverse event meets some but not all of the above 
criteria for “Definitely Related”.  
o Probably Not Related : The adverse event occurred while the patient was on the study 
but can reasonably be explained by the known characteristics of the patient’s clinical 
state or other therapies.  
o Definitely Not Related : The adverse event is definitely produced by the patient’s clinical 
state or by other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
o Uncertain Relationship : The adverse event does not fit in any of the above categories.  
 
15.2 Monitoring for Adverse Events  
The time interval during which patients will be monitored for the occurrence of adverse events begins at 
randomization and ends at the first of hospital discharge or 90 days. Adverse events occurring before 
randomization or after hospital discharge or 90 days will not be collected. The principal  investigator will 
have primary responsibility for overseeing the monitoring, assessment, and reporting of adverse events. 
Study personnel will evaluate for the occurrence of adverse events by review of the electroni c health 
record and by communication with treating clinicians. Study personnel will evaluate for the occurrence 
of adverse events by manual review of the electronic health record during initial data collection  and 
during final data collection. Study personnel will also communicate regularly with the treating clinicians 
in the study environments to solicit information about any potential adverse events.  If study personnel 
identify a potential adverse event, the principal  investigator will be immediately notified. The principal  
investigator will assess the seriousness, unexpectedness, and relatedness of the potential adverse event. 
The principal  investigator will determine whether the event qualifies for recording and reporting.

15.3 Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
The following types of adverse events will be recorded and reported:  
● Adverse events that are Serious  and Definitely Related, Probably or Possibly Related, or of 
Uncertain Relationship . 
● Adverse events that are Unexpected  and Definitely Related, Probably or Possibly Related, or of 
Uncertain Relationship . 
 
Adverse events that do not meet the above criteria will not be recorded or reported. Adverse events 
that the principal investigator assesses to meet the above criteria will be recorded . The principal  
investigator will record an assessment of each characteristic for the adverse event, including 
seriousness, unexpectedness, and relatedness. For any adverse event that is serious AND unexpected , 
and definitely related, probably or possibly related, or of uncertain relationship, the principal  
investigator will r eport the adverse event to the study support staff  within 24 hours  of becoming aware 
of the adverse event. For any other adverse event requiring recording and reporting, the principal 
investigator will report the adverse event to the study support staff  within 72 hours  of becoming aware 
of the adverse event. The study support staff will coordinate with the principal investigator to obtain 
information about the adverse event regarding each characteristic for the adverse event, including 
seriousness, expectedness, and relatedness. The principal  investigator will be responsible for making 
final determinations regarding seriousness and unexpectedness. The study support staff will facilitate 
final determinations regarding relatedness.  
 
For adverse events that meet the above criteria for recording and reporting, study support staff  will 
notify the IRB  in accordance with the following reporting plan:  
 
Characteristics of the Adverse Event  Reporting Period  
Fatal or life -threatening (and therefore serious), 
unexpected, and definitely related, probably or 
possibility related, or of uncertain relationship.  Report to the IRB within 7 days after notification 
of the event.  
Serious but non -fatal and non -life-threatening, 
unexpected, and definitely related, probably or 
possibly related, or of uncertain relationship.  Report to IRB within 15 days of notification of the 
event.  
All other adverse events meeting criteria for 
recording and reporting.  Report to IRB during the annual continuing review . 
 
15.4 Clinical Outcomes that may be Exempt from Adverse Event Recording and Reporting  
In this study of hospitalized  patients with serious illness at high risk for death and other adverse 
outcomes due to their underlying serious  illness, clinical outcomes, including death, will be 
systematically collected and analyzed for all patients. The primary, secondary, and exploratory 
outcomes will be recorded and reported as clinical outcomes and not as adverse events unless treating 
clinicians or the principal  investigator believe the event is Definitely Related  or Probably or Possibly 
Study Protocol: Version 2.0 – 7/31/202 4

Related  to the study intervention or study procedures. This approach – considering death and other 
outcomes  as clinical outcomes rather than adverse events and systemically collecting these clinical 
outcomes for analysis – is common in trials among patients with serious illness . This approach ensures 
comprehensive data on death and other outcomes for all patients, rather than relying on sporadic 
adverse event reporting to identify these important events.  The following events are examples of study -
specific clinical outcomes that would not be recorded and reported as adverse events unless treating 
clinicians or the principal investigator  believe the event was Definitely Related  or Probably or Possibly 
Related  to the study intervention or study procedures:  
● Death  
● Duration of ICU admission  
● Duration of hospitalization  
15.5 Unanticipated Problems involving Risks to Subjects or Others  
The principal Investigator must also report Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others 
(“Unanticipated Problems”), regardless of severity, associated with study procedures within 24 hours  of 
the principal investigator becoming aware of the Unanticipated Problem. An Unanticipated Problem is 
defined as any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
● Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that 
are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol; 
and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  AND  
● Definitely Related  or Probably or Possibly Related  to participation in the research (as defined 
above in the section on characteristics of adverse events); AND  
● Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
If any study personnel become aware of an event that may represent an Unanticipated Problem , they 
will immediately contact the principal  investigator. The principal  investigator will assess whether the 
event represents an Unanticipated Problem by applying the criteria described above. If the principal  
investigator determines that the event represents an Unanticipated Problem, the principal  investigator 
will record the Unanticipated Problem.  The principal  investigator will then communicate that an 
Unanticip ated Problem has occurred to the supporting study team personnel  within 24 hours  of 
becoming aware of the Unanticipated Problem. The principal investigator  or study personnel will report 
the Unanticipated Problem to the IRB within 15 days of becoming aware of the Unanticipated Problem.

2.0 Background  
Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis is the 12th leading cause of death in the United States.1 Patients with 
End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD), a progressive illness synonymous with decompensated cirrhosis, 
advanced liver disease, and liver failure2, face many complications and a variety of health symptoms 
including the development of ascites, variceal hemorrhage, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocellular 
carcinoma, cognitive decline, fatigue, pruritus, malnutrition, pain, and renal impairment.3,4 Many 
cirrhotic p atients face financial, emotional, and social problems relating to the stigma of liver disease,4 
and quality of life is often decreased due to physical and psychological symptoms.2 For patients with 
decompensated cirrhosis, liver transplantation is the only cure. More than 15,000  candidates were 
registered on the waiting list for liver transplant in the US as of December 31, 2013.5 As hope for a 
transplant and cure is foremost in the mind of these patients, it is not surprising that palliative care 
opportun ities may be overlooked. However, many patients are not candidates for transplantation, and 
those on the waitlist may never undergo transplantation or may have considerable wait time. In 2013 , 
1,767 patients died while on the waiting list and 1,223 patients were removed due to being too ill to 
undergo transplant. Of the 5,921 patients who received a liver transplant, 53.2% were on the waitlist for 
3 months or longer and 21.1% for more than 1 ye ar prior to transplant.5 Even for those who undergo 
successful transplant, the symptom burden of cirrhosis warrants intervention.  
 
In one retrospective study of 102 adult patients at a university hospital site who were either removed 
from the waiting list for liver transplant or were declined transplant, patients experienced significant 
symptoms including pain (65% of patients), nause a (58%), lack of appetite (49%), dyspnea (48%), anxiety 
(36%), and depression (10%). However, only 11% of patients were referred for palliative care, and only 
28% had do -not-resuscitate status  in their chart.6 Another study considered all patients discusse d by an 
institution’s Liver Transplant Committee at a tertiary care academical medical center with a large liver 
transplantation  program. Of 769 patients discussed , 135 were removed from transplant consideration ; 
and only 27 of those 135  were referred to palliative care.7 Palliative care is often disregarded until hope 
of liver transplantation is lost, which may be in the last week or two of life. We hypothesize that 
prompting the consideration of palliative care services earlier and more consistently in co ntext with 
disease -directed therapies will improve palliative care introduction into ESLD patient treatment plans 
subsequently yielding the hospital -free days  in this population and will delay or reduce hospital 
readmissions while maintaining or improving quantitative and qualitative measures of quality of life and 
end of life care.8 
 
There is potential benefit to introducing palliative care earlier in the course of illness for patients with 
chronic liver disease. For some patients with cirrhosis, palliative care has been shown to improve 
physical and emotional symptoms. In a recent observational study, Baumann et al . found that for 
patients with ESLD on the waiting list for liver transplant, an early palliative care intervention 
counteracted the progression of worsening symptoms and significantly improved pruritus, appetite, 
anxiety, de pression, fatigue, and well -being.9 Moreover, the introduction of palliative care within the 
care course of patients  with decompensated  cirrhosis is endorsed by an  AASLD  (American A ssociation  
for the Study of Liver Diseases)  practice guidance  document.10

In addition to quality of life , hospital utilization for hepatic patients is of particular concern. Hospital 
admission rates and the economic burden of treating these patients have continued to rise.11 In a study 
of 402 patients with decompensated cirrhosis who were admitted to hospital, 78% of patients had at 
least one readmission, with 14% of these patients readmitted within 1 week after discharge at a mean 
cost of $25,898 per readmission. Another 37%  of these patients were readmitted within 1 month after  
discharge at a mean cost of $20,581 per admission. Of these, 22% were determined to be possibly 
preventable admissions.12 
 
Palliative care interventions have been shown to reduce hospital utilization for some liver transplant 
service patients. Lamba et al . conducted a prospective observational study comparing outcomes before 
and after structured palliative care program integration in the surgical intensive care unit for liver 
transplant service patients. After program implementation, goals of care discussions during physician 
rounds increased significantly (from 2% to 39% of patient -days), and the mean length of  stay in the 
surgical intensive care unit decreased by 3 days for patients who died and by 4 days for patients who 
survived. Although mortality rates were similar pre - and post - program implementation, do-not-
resuscitate  status significantly increased in those who died from 52% pre -implementation to 81% post -
implementation. Do-not-resuscitate  status was also instituted earlier, decreasing from 38 days after 
admission to 19 days after admission.13 Palliative care, once understood and integrated, has the 
potential to improve clinical outcomes, improve patient’s quality of life , and reduce cost. But when to 
integrate the services, how to integrate services, and for which patients, is not well established.  
 
ESLD has been recognized as  a condition in which early palliative care may be beneficial.9,13 Patients with 
ESLD have high rates of severe symptoms, high levels of healthcare utilization, and a low rate of advance 
care planning.6,8 Moreover, for patients with decompensated cirrhosis, liver transplantation is the only 
cure. As of March 19, 2019, over 13,000  candidates were registered on the waiting list for liver 
transplant in the US.14 Previous studies in ESLD patients have shown associations of palliative care 
interventions with improvements in symptom control, mood, and quality of life and reduction in 
healthcare utilization.9,13 These results suggest that the many patients who are not candidates for 
transplantation and those on the waitlist who may have considerable wait time would likely benefit 
from specialist palliative care.  
 
We previously designed and implemented a randomized, controlled trial of a specialist palliative care 
intervention for ESLD patients admitted as inpatients to our institution. An important component of 
eligibility related to the use of the Surprise Question, which was demonstrated to be a potentially useful 
screening tool in this population. Due to slower than expected enrollment, the trial was terminated 
before full enrollment. Despite the trial’s early closure, early palliative care intervention increased  time 
to readmission and hospital free days compared to usual care with no effect on mortality, though our 
study was underpowered for the latter endpoint. These encouraging outcomes in this small trial indicate 
a potential signal for the effectiveness of s pecialty palliative care impact on time to readmission and

12.0 Statistical Considerations  
Power and Sample Size Considerations : The number of hospital -free days can have a very asymmetric 
distribution with floor and ceiling effects and many tied values. This results in a scale that is best 
analyzed with a proportional odds model and treatment effect can be summarized as a common od ds 
ratio.

Effect of Prompting Palliative Care Consultation on Provider Referral Rates and Subsequent Outcomes 
for Hospitalized Adults with Serious Illnesses  
Primary Investigator: Mohana Karlekar, MD , FACP, FAAHPM  
 
   
 
The minimal effect on hospital -free days to avoid missing is judged to be 7 days. Assuming the 
distribution shown in the above histogram, this represents an odds -ratio -shifted distribution from the 
observed mean of 56 to 63 for an odds ratio of 1.5. Again,  using the reference distribution above, to 
detect a difference of 7 days (odds ratio of 1.5) with 0.9 power would require 388 subjects per study 
group.  
 
An anticipated sample size for Stage 1 is approximately 10% of the total sample size for the trial ( 776 
patients) or 78 patients , 39 per group . The estimated sample size for Stage 2 is 776 patients , 388 per 
group . We are explicitly examining the separation between groups for the primary outcome at Stage 1 
and have outlined the trial progression scenarios. It is anticipated that all patients will have the same 
data collected and will be included in the analyses for t he primary, secondary, and exploratory 
outcomes. Stage 1 to Stage 2  trial progression  will occur utilizing  the same group separation framework 
described in the Master Protocol.  The sample size estimations for the ESLD clinical domain were based 
on observat ional data obtained from hospitalized adults with ESLD at VUMC and THA hospitals.

Appendix  B: Framework for Best Practices of (Inpatient) Palliative Care 
Consultation   
1. Definitions  
a. Palliative care is medical care that aims to alleviate suffering and improve the quality of 
life of patients with serious illness.1  
b. Primary Palliative Care:  palliative care provided by a healthcare provider not specializing 
in palliative and hospice medicine ( e.g.,  primary hepatologist) .  
c. Specialty Palliative Care: palliative care provided through consultation by those trained 
and/or board certified in hospice and palliative medicine .2,3 
 
2. Standard Consultation of Palliative Care Interdisciplinary Team.   
a. Interdisciplinary team (IDT): a team of palliative care specialists that includes but not 
limited to: physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, social workers, and chaplains, 
dedicated to assessment of physical, psychological, social, spiritual, cultural , and ethical 
care plans of those with serious illness and at end of life.4 
b. Consultations will follow standard palliative care consultations conducted at VUMC, 
acknowledging the heterogeneity of real -world encounters and tailored to address 
individual/family/caregivers’ needs. Palliative care specialists may address any or all of 
the following:  
 
i. Introduction/Education of palliative care field and its goals.  
ii. Assess and/or treat symptoms . 
iii. Identify patient surrogate and Advance Care Planning . 
iv. Engage patient and/or surrogate on:  
1. Understanding of serious illness and prognosis.  
2. Patient’s values and goals of care . 
3. What is and is not an acceptable quality of life.  
v. Facilitate communication and explore possible treatment pathways based on 
available medical interventions in setting of above goals . 
vi. Implement goal -concordant treatment pathway . 
vii. Referral to post -acute support services as appropriate ( e.g.,  hospice, outpatient 
palliative care, skilled nursing, OT/PT…) . 
 
3. End-Stage Liver Disease/ SeQu EL Considerations  
Below are topics of consideration to guide Palliative Care consultations for patients 
hospitalized with ESLD:  
a. Indication, possibility, and requirements for transplant should be delineated as clearly as 
possible in order to allow for most effective discussion of treatment pathways.  
b. Eliciting patient (and/or surrogate) understanding of their liver disease (including 
treatment and/or prognosis) in the context of their lives and personal values/goals.  
c. Within context of elected goals/treatment pathway, procedural ESLD symptom 
management and discussions ( e.g.,  transplant, ascites -TIPS/Indwelling catheters, 
variceal bleeding -EGD/TIPS/BTO) should be coordinated with, if not guided by, 
hepatology treatment team.

Effect of Prompting Palliative Care Consultation on Provider Referral Rates and Subsequent Outcomes 
for Hospitalized Adults with Serious Illnesses  
Primary Investigator: Mohana Karlekar, MD , FACP, FAAHPM  
 
d. Within context of elected goals/treatment pathway, non -procedural symptom 
management and discussions ( e.g.,  encephalopathy, pain, nausea, dyspnea, pruritus, 
muscle cramping, sleep disturbance, depression/anxiety etc.) may not require specific 
consultation with hepatology team other than coordination to ensure clear roles for 
effective teamwork and management; c oordination and multidisciplinary discussion is 
always encouraged.  
e. When feasible, family meetings and discussions should include patient -important 
stakeholders as well as members of primary medical stakeholders, in particular primary 
treatment team and hepatology consult team. Pre -meeting and debriefing should be 
componen ts of family meeting protocol to ensure most effective communication.

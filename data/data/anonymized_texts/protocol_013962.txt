for subsequent disease progressi on (which occurred during the of f-treatment period) and 
administered for up to 1 additional year.
The 2 cycles of histology-based platinum doublet chemotherapy in  the treatment arm during 
induction are the same chemotherapy regimens as in the control a rm:
•Squamous histology: carboplatin AUC 6 + paclitaxel 200 mg/m2
•Non-squamous histology: carboplatin AUC 5 or 6 + p emetrexed 500 mg/m2 or cisplatin 
75 mg/m2+ pemetrexed 500 mg/m2. The investigator must decide prior to randomization 
whether or not the participant with non-squamous histology will re ceive cisplatin, if eligible.
Control arm : 4 cycles of histology -based platinum doublet chemotherapy.
•Squamous histology: carboplatin AUC 6 + paclitaxel 200 mg/m2
•Non-squamous histology: carboplat in AUC 5 or 6 + pemetrexed 500 mg/m2or cisplatin 
75 mg/m2+ pemetrexed 500 mg/m2. The investigator must decide prior to randomization 
whether or not the participant with non-squamous histology will re ceive cisplatin, if eligible.
•Chemotherapy will be on day 1 of each 3 week cycle; participants  with non-squamous 
histology who have stable disease or response after i nduction chemotherapy are per mitted to 
receive optional pemetrexed maintenance therapy: 500 mg/m2pemetrexed on day 1 of each 
3 week cycle until dis ease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or other reasons sp ecified in 
the protocol.

•PD-L1 negative (< 1% tumor cell membrane staining in a minimum of a hundred evaluable 
tumor cells)
•PD-L1 not quantifiable (participants with tumor biopsy specimens  without quantifiable PD-L1 
expression)
Participants are to have tumor tissue sample available for PD-L1  IHC testing performed by a
central laboratory during screening peri od. PD-L1 s tatus is required for randomization. 
The enrollment will end when approximately 420 patients are ran domized. IWRS will be used to 
track the enrollment number. Testing of PD-L1 through a central laboratory is required prior to 
randomization. Participants tested but with not quantifiable PD -L1 will stratify with PD-L1 
negative participants. PD-L1 not  quantifiable population will b e capped to 10% of total 
randomized population. The study design schematic is presented in Figure 5.1-1.
Figure 5.1-1: Study Design Schematic
Approximately 420 participants w ill be ra ndomized in a 1:1 r atio to the treatment arm or control 
arm. The stratification factors for randomization are PD-L1 lev el (≥ 1% vs < 1%), histology
(squamous vs non-squamous histology), and gender (male vs female ). Participants without
quantifiable PD-L1 status can be stratified with PD-L1 < 1% pop ulation and capped to 10% of the 
total randomized participants. 
The investigator must decide prior to randomization if participa nt with non-squamous histology 
will receive cisplatin therapy, based on cisplatin eligibility c riteria.
Treatment Arm: Nivolumab will be administered with ipilimumab, plus 2 cycles o f 
histology-based platinum doublet chemotherapy: 
•Squamous histology: carboplatin AUC 6 + paclitaxel 200 mg/m2
•Non-squamous histology: carboplat in AUC 5 or 6 + pemetrexed 500 m g/m2or

The DMC will be advisory to the clinical study leadership team. The clinical study leadership will 
have responsibility for overall conduct of the study including managing the communication of 
study data. The group will be responsible for promptly reviewin g the DMC recommendations, for 
providing guidance regarding the continuation or termination of  the study, and for determining 
whether amendments to the protocol or changes to the study cond uct are required.
Details of the DMC responsibilities and procedures w ill be sp ecified in the DMC charter. 
5.1.1.2 Blinded Independent Radiology Central Review 
Tumor assessments for each participant s hould be submitted to the radiology vendor as will be
performed on an ongoing basis. At the time of investigator-asse ssed initial radi ographic 
progression per RECIST 1.1 in any given participant, the site m ust request the Independent Central 
Review from the third party radiology ve ndor for confirmation of progression. The blinded, 
independent radiologists will review all available tumor assess ments for that given participant and 
determine if RECIST 1.1 criteria for progression have been met.  The independent assessment of 
whether or not the given parti cipant met RECIST 1.1 criteria for progression will be provided to 
the site. Participants whose disease progression is not confirme d centrally will be required to 
continue tumor assessments (if clinically feasible) according t o the protocol-specified schedule. 
Subsequent tumor assessments must be submitted to the third par ty radiology vendor for 
subsequent review and may be discontinued when the investigator  and independent radiologists 
both assess the participant to have met RECIST 1.1 criteria for progression.
BICR will review tumor images in all treated participants to det ermine RECIST 1.1 response for 
analyses of ORR or PFS. Details of the BICR procedures will be sp ecified in the imaging manual.
5.2 Number of Participants
Approximately  420 participants w ill be randomized to treatment arm a nd control arm in a 1:1 ratio.
5.3 End of Study DefinitionThe start of the trial is defined as first visit f or first partic ipant screened. End of trial is defined as 
the last visit or scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities for the last participant.
Study completion is defined as the final date on which data for the primary endpoint was or is 
expected to be collected, if this is not the same.

6.4 Screen Failures
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to part icipate in the clinical study but are 
not subsequently randomized. A minimal set of screen failure inf ormation is required to ensure 
transparent reporting of screen failure participants, to meet t he Consolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements, and to respond to queries from regulatory 
authorities. Minimal information in cludes date of consent, demo graphy, screen failure details, 
eligibility criteria, and any serious AEs.
6.4.1 Retesting During Screening Period
This study permits the re-enro llment of a p articipant that has d iscontinued the study as a 
pre-treatment f ailure (ie, participant has not b een randomized / has not been t reated). If re-e nrolled, 
the participant must be re-consented
Retesting of laboratory parameters and/or other assessments with in any single screening will be 
permitted (in addition to any parameters that require a confirm atory value).
The most current result prior to randomization is the value by which study inclusion will be 
assessed, as it represents the participant’s most current, clin ical state.

of the nivolumab infusion. Platinum- doublet will start at least 30 minutes after completion of the 
nivolumab or ipilimumab i nfusion (if ipilimumab is scheduled to be given). At the investigator’s 
discretion, nivolumab or ipilimumab ma y be administered over a longer i nfusion time (60 minutes) 
if the participant developed a prior infusion reaction.
Nivolumab and ipilimumab treatmen t will continue until disease progression, discontinuation due 
to unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study closu re. Participants will be treated up to 
24 months in the absence of disease progression or inacceptable  toxicity. Treatment with 
nivolumab and ipilimumab could be reinitiated as per the initia l schedule for subsequent disease 
progression after maximum 24 month s of treatment and administer ed for up to 1 additional year. 
Maximum 24 mont hs of treatment also applies to treatment beyond progression.
All participants will be monitored continuously for AEs while on study treatment. Treatment 
modifications  (eg, dose delay, reduction, retreatment, or disco ntinuation) will be based on specific 
laboratory and adverse event criteria, as described in Sections 7.4.1 , 7.4.2, 7.4.3, and 8.1.

7.1.1 Dosing
7.1.1.1 Nivolumab and Ipilimumab Dosing for Treatment ArmParticipants will receive nivolumab and ipilimumab (induction do se and treatment interval will be  
determined by safety lead-in phase in study CA 209568), followed by chemotherapy on day 1 of  
every 3 weeks cycle. The 2 cycles of chemotherapy during induct ion are same regimens as control  
arm (without chemotherapy maintenance) as in Section 7.1.1.2. At  the time of completion of  
2 cycles of chemotherapy, parti cipants who have not experienced d isease progression will continue  
to receive nivolumab at a dose of 360 mg as 30 minute i nfusion every 3 weeks, and ip ilimumab  
1 mg/kg as 30 minute i nfusion IV every 6 weeks starti ng on day 1. Treatment w ill continue until  
progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or t he study ends, whichever occurs 
first. Treatment with nivolumab with ipilimumab will be given for up to 24 months in the absence  
of disease progression or inacceptable toxicity. A maximum 24 m onths of treatment also applies  
to treatment beyond progression. Treatment with nivolu mab and ipilimumab could be r einitiated  
as per the initial schedule for subsequent disease progression and administered for up to 
1 additional year (investigators may decide not to re-treat with  ipilimumab and nivolumab at  
progression if there is significant risk of recurrent severe to xicity). Ipilimumab and/or nivolumab  
must not be reinitiated if it was permanently discontinued on study due to treatment related  
toxicities. All exceptions must require approval by Medical Mon itor. Participants may discontinue  
only ipilimumab and continue treatment with nivolumab if certai n circumstances are met  
(Section 8.1.2 ). 
Ipilimumab is not permitted to continue on study after nivoluma b is discontinued. The assessment  
for discontinuation of nivolumab should be made separ ately from the assessment made for  
discontinuation of ipilimumab. Although there is overlap among the discontinuation criteria, if  
discontinuation criteria are met for ipilimumab but not for niv olumab, treatment with nivolumab  
may continue if ipilimumab is discontinued. The assessment for discontinuation of 
nivolumab/ipilimumab  should be made separately from chemotherap y. If criteria for  
discontinuation for nivolumab and ipilimumab are met, platinum doublet chemotherapy may  
continue until 2 cycles have bee n completed. If a participant me ets criteria for discontinuation and  
investigator is unable to determine whether the event is related  to all or any one study d rug, the  
participant should di scontinue all study drugs and be taken off the treatment phase of the study. 
7.1.1.2 Chemotherapy Dosing
In control arm, 4 cycles of hi stology-based platinum doublet ch emotherapy options will be selected  
b 
y investigator and administered on day 1 every 3 weeks; partic ipants with non-squamous 
histology may also receive optional maintenance therapy with 50 0 mg/m2pemetrexed alone on  
day 1 of each 3 week cycle until disease progression or unaccept able toxicity or other reasons  
specified in the protocol ( Section 8.1.3 ). 
In treatment arm, 2 cycles of chemotherapy during i nduction are same regimens as control arm  
(without chemotherapy maintenance).

•Non-squamous histology: 
−carboplatin AUC 5 or  6 + pemetrexed 500 mg/m2
−cisplatin 75 mg/m2+ pemetrexed 500 mg/m2
All chemotherapy agents’ preparation, premedication, administration, monitoring, and 
management of complications are to follow local prescription gu ideline and regulation. The dose 
of chemotherapy may be capped per local standards.
Note: The investigator must decide prior to randomization whether or not a participant with 
non-squamous histology will receive cisplatin, if eligible.
7.1.1.2.1 Paclitaxel and Carboplatin 
Participants will r eceive p aclitaxel 200 mg/m2as a 180-minute IV infusion with ca rboplatin at a 
dose of AUC 6 as a 30-minute  IV infusio n, on Day 1 of a 3-week cycle, or at doses per the local 
prescribing information. The infusion time can follow local ins titutional standard. 
Paclitaxel dosing calculations should be based on the body surf ace area calculation. The dose may 
remain the same if the participant’s weight is within 10% of th e baseline weight or prior dose 
weight.
Carboplatin s hould be given following paclitaxel  on Day 1 of each cycle, and the carboplatin dose 
will be calculated using the Calvert formula as follows:
•Carboplatin dose (mg) = target AUC x ([CrCl (ml/min) + 25]
•Creatinine clearance (CrCl) calculation is b ased on the Cockcro ft-Gault formula) and should 
include the most recent serum creatinine and most recent weight . NOTE: If calculation of the 
CrCl by the Cockcroft-Gault formula yields a result of >  125 mL/min, the n a CrCl should be 
calculated by an alternative formula per institutional standard s or capped at 125 mL/min.
•The dose of carboplatin may be capped per local standards.
Premedications for use with paclitaxel
Oral corticosteroid should be given according to local standard  at a dose equivalent to 
dexamethasone 20 mg 12 hours and 6 hours prior to paclitaxel administration. Oral or intravenous 
(IV) diphenhydramine (or its equivalent) 50 mg and H2-blocker ( per local standard of care) should 
be administered 30 to 60 minutes prior to paclitaxel infusion.
Doses of paclitaxel and/or carboplatin may be interrupted, dela yed, reduced, or discontinued 
depending on how well the participant tolerates the treatment.

Premedications with pemetrexed use
1) Oral corticosteroid should be given according to local standa rds at a dose equivalent to 
dexamethasone 4 mg BID on the day  prior to, the day of, and the day after the administration 
of pemetrexed. Oral folic acid 350 to 1000 mcg daily should be given starting 1 week prior to 
the first dose of pemetrexed, with at least 5 doses of folic ac id administered in the 7 days prior 
to the first dose. Oral folic acid s hould be continued daily throughout the  treatment with 
pemetrexed and for 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed. I ntramuscular (IM) injection of 
vitamin B12 1000 mcg s hould be giv en approximately one week pri or to the first dose of 
pemetrexed and repeated every 3 cycles thereafter during pemetr exed treatment. Subsequent 
injections of vitamin B12 may be given on the same day as pemet rexed. (Participant with 
non-squamous histology may begin folic acid and vitamin B12 pri or to randomization in 
anticipation of pemetrexed)
2) Antiemetic premedication will be administered according to lo cal standards. Recommended 
antiemetic treatments are dex amethasone (dosing according to local standards; an equivalent 
dose of another corticosteroid may be substituted) and a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (type per 
investigator discretion and local standards-of-care). Additiona l use of antiemetic 
premedications may be employed at the discretion of the Investi gator.
Participants will receive pemetrexed at a dose of 500 mg/m2as a 10 minute IV infusion on day 1 
with cisplatin at a dose of 75mg/m2infusion as per local standard pr actice on day 1 of a 3-week  
treatment cycle for up to 2 cycles in treatment arm or 4 cycles in  control arm.
Dosing calculations should be based on the body surface area ca lculation and may be capped per  
local standards. The dose may remain the same if the participan t’s weight is within 10% of the  
baseline weight or prior dose weight.
Cisplatin will be administered to participants at least 30 minu tes following the end of the  
pemetrexed infusion. Pretreatmen t hydration for cisplatin can f ollow local standard of care, or use  
1 to 2 liters of fluid (per local standards) infused IV for 8 to 12 hours prior to cisplat in infusion is 
recommended. Ade quate hydration and urinary output must be main tained for at least 24 hours  
following cisplatin administration. Administration and monitori ng should be performed according  
to local standards. Use of mannitol following the cisplatin inf usion should also follow local  
standards-of-care.
Doses of pemetrexed and/or cisplatin may be interrupted, delayed, reduced, or discontinued

7.1.2 Treatment of Nivolumab or Ipilimumab Infusion Reactions
Since nivolumab and ipilimumab contain only human immunoglobulin  protein sequences, they are 
unlikely to be immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensitiv ity reactions. However, if such a 
reaction were to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, r igors, headache, rash, pruritus, 
arthralgias, hypo- or hypertension, bronchospasm, o r other symptoms. All Grade 3 or 4 i nfusion 
reactions should be reported within 24 hours to the BMS Medical Monitor and reported as an SAE 
if criteria are met. Infusion r eactions should be graded acc ording to NCI CTCAE (Version 4.0) 
guidelines.
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modifie d based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptoms: (mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated)
•Remain at bedside and monitor participant until recovery from sy mptoms. The following 
prophylactic prem edications are recomme nded for future i nfusions: diphe nhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg  at least 30 minutes before 
additional nivolumab or ipilimumab administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms: (moderate reaction requires therapy or infusion interruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihistamines,  non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; 
prophylactic medications indicated for ≤≤24 hours)
•Stop the nivolumab or ipilimumab infusion, begin an IV infusion  of normal saline, and treat 
the participant with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) an d/or 
acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor participant until 
resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid and/or bronchodilator th erapy may also be 
administered as appropriate. If the infusion is inte rrupted, then restart the i nfusion at 50% of 
the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve; if no further  complications ensue after 
30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of the original in fusion rate. Monitor participant
closely. If symptoms rec ur, then no further nivolumab or ip ilimumab will be administered at 
that visit. Administer diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, and remain at bedside and monitor the 
participant until resolution of symptoms. The am ount of study drug infused must be recorded 
on the electronic case report form (eCRF).
•For future infusions, the following prophylactic premedications are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equiv alent) and/or acetaminophen/para cetamol 325 to 1000 mg 
should be administered at least 30 minutes before nivolumab or ipilimumab infusions. If 
necessary, corticosteroids  (up to 25 m g of SoluCor tef or equiva lent) may be used.
For Grade 3 or 4 symptoms: (severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapidly responsive 
to symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion ]; recurrence of symptoms 
following initial improvement; hospitalization indicated for other clinical sequelae [eg, renal 
impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]. Grade 4: Life threatening; pressor or ventilatory 
support indicated)

BMS-936558 nivolumab
•Immediately discontinue infusion o f nivoluma b or ipilimumab. Begin an IV infusion o f normal 
saline and tr eat the participant as follows: Reco mmend bronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 to 1 
mg of a 1:1000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg o f a 1:10,000 
solution injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhyd ramine 50 mg IV with 
methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Partic ipant should be monitored 
until the investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will no t recur. Nivolumab or 
ipilimumab will be permanently discontinued. Investigators shou ld follow their institutional 
guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor participant until 
recovery of the symptoms.
In case of late-occurring hypersen sitivity symptoms (eg, appear ance of a localized or generalized 
pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine or corticosteroids).
7.1.3 Treatment Beyond Disease Progression 
Accumulating evidence indicates a  minority of participants treat ed with immunotherapy may 
derive clinical benefit despite initial evidence of PD .21
Participants will be permitted to continue on nivolumab + ipilim umab for treatmen t beyond init ial 
RECIST 1.1 defined PD as long as they meet the following criter ia:
•Investigator-assessed clinical benefit and no rapid disease pro gression
•Participant is toler ating study treatment
•Stable performance status
•Treatment beyond progression will not d elay an imminent intervention to prevent serious 
complications of disease progression (eg, CNS metastases)
•Participant provides wri tten informed consent prior to receiving additional nivolumab a nd 
ipilimumab tr eatment, using an ICF describing any reasonably foreseeable ris ks or 
discomforts, or other alternative treatment options.
The decision to continue tr eatment be yond initial investigator-assessed progression s hould be 
discussed with the BMS Medical Monitor and documented in the st udy records. A follow-up scan 
should be performed within six (6) weeks ±7 days of original PD to determine whether there has 
been a decrease in the tumor size, or continued progression of disease. Subsequent scans should 
be performed per protocol defined schedule ±7 days until further progression is determined.
If the investigator feels that the participant continues to achi eve clinical benefit by continuing 
treatment, the p articipant should remain on t he trial and contin ue to receive monitoring according 
to the Time and Events Schedule in Section 2 .
For the participants who continue study therapy beyond progress ion, further progression is defined 
as an additional 10% increase in tumor burden from time of init ial PD. This includes an increase 
in the sum of diameters of all target lesions and/ or the diame ters of new measurable lesions 
compared to the time of initial PD. Nivolumab and ipilimumab tr eatment should be discontinued 
permanently upon documentati on of further progression.

1.0 Approved 930114362 1.0v
Clinical Protocol CA2099LA
BMS-936558 nivolumab
New lesions are considered measureable at th e time of init ial progression if the longest diameter 
is at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which mu st have a short axis of at least 
15 mm). Any new lesion considered non-measureable at the time of  initial progression may 
become measureable and therefore included in the tumor burden if the longest diameter increases 
to at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which mu st have a short axis of at least 
15 mm). In situations where the relative increase in total tumor burden by 10% is solely due to 
inclusion of new lesions which become measurable, these new les ions must demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
7.2 Method of Treatment Assignment
After the participant’s initial eligibility is established and informed consent has been obtained, the 
participant must be enrolled i nto the study by calling an intera ctive web response system (IWRS) 
to obtain the participant number. Every participant that signs t he informed consent form must be 
assigned a participant number in IWRS. Specific instructions for  using IWRS will be provided to 
the investigational site in a separate document. The investigat or or designee will register the 
participant for enrollment by fo llowing the enrollment procedure s established by BMS. The 
following information is required for enrollment:
•Date that informed consent was obtained
•Participant number
•Date of birth
Participants enrolled will be grouped according to PD-L1 status (positive, negative, or not 
quantifiable, using membranous staining in ≥1% tumor cells v s membranous staining in < 1% 
tumor cells). PD-L1 expression dat a will be transferred directl y from analyzing lab to IWRS. 
IWRS will be used to track the enrollment number.
Once enrolled in IWRS, enrolled  participants that have met all eligibility criteria will be
randomized through IWRS. The followi ng information is required for participant randomization:
•Participant number
•Date of birth
•Gender
•Histology (squamous or non-squamous). 
−Participants with mixed histol ogy should be cla ssified according to the predominant 
histology. 
−Participants with adenosquamous histology should be classified a s non-squamous 
histology.
•PD-L1 status
•Will particip ant be treated with cisplatin, if eligible?
Participants meeting all eligibility criteria will be stratified by tumor histology (squ amous vs 
non-squamous), gender (male vs female), and PD-L1 level (< 1% v s ≥ 1% expression levels) 
Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment and  control arms.

Note: participants whose PD-L1 status is not quantifiable will be classified as PD-L1 < 1%. The 
total number of participants with not quantifiable PD-L1 status should not exceed 10% of total 
randomized participants for Part 2.
Enrollment will end after approximately 420 participants are ran domized.
The exact procedures for using the IWRS will be detailed in the IWRS manual.
7.3 Blinding
Not applicable. This is an open-label study, blinding procedures  are not applicable.
7.4 Dosage Modification
Immuno-oncology (I-O) agents are associated with AEs that can d iffer in severity and duration 
than AEs caused by other therapeutic classes. Nivolumab and ipi limumab are considered immuno-
oncology agents in this protocol. Early recognition and manageme nt of AEs associated with 
immuno-oncology agents may mitigate severe toxicity. Management  Algorithms have been 
developed to assist investigators in assessing and managing the  following groups of AEs:
•Gastrointestinal
•Renal
•Pulmonary
•Hepatic
•Endocrinopathy
•Skin
•Neurological
The above algorithms are found in both the nivolumab and ipilim umab Investigator Brochures, as 
well as in Appendix 6 .
7.4.1 Dose Delay Criteria
7.4.1.1 Dose Delay Criteria for Nivolumab and Ipilimumab
Tumor assessments for all participants should continue as per p rotocol even if dosing is delayed.
Nivolumab and ipilimumab administration should be delayed for t he following:
•Any Grade ≥2 non-skin, drug-related adverse event, except for fatigue and laboratory 
abnormalities
•Any Grade ≥3 skin drug-related AE
•Any Grade ≥3 drug-related laboratory  abnormality with the following except ions for 
lymphopenia, AST, ALT, or total bilirubin or asymptomatic amyla se or lipase:
−Grade 3 lymphopenia does not require a dose delay
−If a participant has a baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin tha t is within normal limits, 
delay dosing for drug-relate d Grade 2 toxicity
−If a participant has baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin withi n the Grade 1 toxicity range, 
delay dosing for drug-related Grade ≥3 toxicity
Date: 10-May-2017 55

Clinical Protocol CA2099LA
BMS-936558 nivolumab
−Any Grade ≥3 drug-related amylas e or lipase abnorm ality that is not associated with 
symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis does not re quire dose delay. 
•Any AE, laboratory abnormality or inter-current illness which, in the judgment of the 
investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication.
Participants receiving ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab that have drug-related toxicities 
that meet the criteria f or dose delay, should have both drugs ( ipilimumab and nivolumab) delayed 
until retreatment criteria are met. (Exceptions apply to the re treatment criteria after dose delay of 
ipilimumab and nivolumab for Grade ≥3 amylase and lipase abnormalities that are not associated 
with symptoms or clinical manifestati ons of pancreatitis and th at are attributed to ipilimumab 
alone.)
Participants who require delay should be re-evaluated weekly or  more frequently if clinically
indicated. Participants should resume dosing when re-treatment c riteria are met.
Rescheduling:
•Nivolumab may be delayed until the next planned ipilimumab dose  if the next ipilimumab dose 
is scheduled within the next 12 days. This will permit periodic ipilimumab dosing to be 
synchronized with nivolumab dosing.
•Ipilimumab s hould be dosed at the sp ecified interval regardless of any delays in intervening 
nivolumab doses. However, in order to maintain periodic synchro nized dosi ng of ip ilimumab 
and nivolumab, the dosing days of nivolumab and ipilimumab may be adjusted within the 
permitted ±5 day window, as long as consecutive nivolumab doses are given at least 12 days 
apart. Ipilimumab may be delayed beyond the 5 day window if nee ded to synchronize with the 
next nivolumab dose.
•If an ipilimumab dose is delayed beyond 6 weeks from the prior ipilimumab dose, then 
subsequent ipilimumab doses s hould rescheduled to maintain the 6 week interval between 
consecutive ipilimumab doses. 
•A dose delay of ipilimumab which results in no ipilimumab dosin g for > 12 weeks requires 
ipilimumab discontinuation, with exceptions as noted in Section 8.1 .
•Treatment arm: if any adverse event meeting the dose delay criteria for chemotherapy is felt to 
be related to only one particular agent in the platinum doublet  chemotherapy regimen, then 
that chemotherapy agent alone may be omitted for that cycle whi le the other agents (nivolumab 
and one themotherapy agent) are given. Dosing of nivolumab and bot h chemotherapy agents 
should be delayed if any criteria for nivolumab or “both platinum -doublet chemotherapy
agents” are met.
7.4.1.2 Dose Delay Criteria for Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy drugs should be delayed for any of the following on the D ay 1 of each cy cle:
•Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1500/ μL
•Platelets  < 100,000/mm3
•Any Grade ≥2 non-skin, non-hematologic, drug-related adverse event (exclud ing Grade 2 
alopecia, Grade 2 fatigue, and Grade 2 laboratory abnormalities )
•Any Grade ≥3 skin, drug-related adverse event

•Any Grade ≥3 drug-related laboratory abnormality, with the following excep tions for 
lymphopenia, AST, ALT, or total bilirubin:
•Grade 3 lymphopenia does not require dose delay.
•If a participant has a b aseline AST, A LT or total b ilirubin that is within normal limits, delay 
dosing for drug-related Grade ≥2 toxicity. 
•If a participant has baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin within the Grade 1 toxicity range, 
delay dosing for drug-related Grade ≥3 toxicity. 
•Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of  
the investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medicatio n. Investigators should consult  
local labeling for the chemotherapy drugs being administered to  any given participant for  
additional guidance on dose delays.
•Participants receiving cisplatin with pemetrexed must discontin ue cisplatin if the calculated  
creatinine clearance decreases to < 50 mL/min (based on the Coc kroft Gault formula). The  
other drug (pemetrexed) may be continued, and the platinum agen t may, at the investigator’s 
discretion, be switched to carboplatin for the rest of cycles w hen the participant meets  
retreatment cr iteria. Note that pemetrexed can only be administered if CrCl is  ≥ 45 ml/min 
(calculated per Cockroft-Gault formula)
•In addition, if participants r eceiving ca rboplatin with paclitax el and must discontinue 
carboplatin, the paclitax el may be continued at the investigato r’s discretion. 
•If any non-h ematologic a dverse event meeting the dose delay criteria above is felt to be related  
to only one particular agent in the platinum doublet chemothera py regimen, then that agent  
alone may be omitted for that cycle while the other agent is gi ven. In order to maintain  
synchronized dosing of the reg imen, the omitted a gent should be  resumed with the next  
scheduled cycle once the AE has  improved and retreatment criter ia are met. Please refer to  
Section 7.4.2.2 to determin e if dose reduction of the resumed agent is required.
•If both drugs in the platinum doublet chemotherapy regimen are delayed, then the participant
should be re-evaluated weekly or more frequently if clinically indicated until re-treatment 
criteria are met (as per Section 7.4.3.3 ).
•Treatment arm: Dosing of nivolumab and both chemotherapy agents should be delayed if any  
criteria for nivolumab or “both platinum-doublet chemotherapy age nts” are met.
7.4.2 Dose Reductions
7.4.2.1 Dose Reduction for Nivolumab or Ipilimumab There will be no dose reductions for nivolumab or ipilimumab.
7.4.2.2 Dose Reduction for Chemotherapy 
Dose reductions of chemotherapy may be required, and will be pe rformed according to Table 
7.4.2.2-1 . Chemotherapy dose reductions are permanent; once the dose of any chemotherapy agent  
is reduced, it may not be re-escalated in subsequent cycles, ex cept as noted when starting  
pemetrexed maintenance therapy. The dose reductions for each ag ent in the platinum doublet  
chemotherapy regimen are not linked and may be adjusted independently as summarized below.

since the preceding drug administration. Dose level adjustments  for platinum doublet  
chemotherapy are relative to that of the preceding administrati on. Generally, both chemotherapy  
agents in the platinum doublet chemotherapy regimen should be d ose reduced together for  
hematologic toxicity. After the  first cycle, growth factors may  be used to assist hematologic  
recovery. Use local standards of care in the use of these suppo rtive measures. Additionally,  
prophylactic antibiotics may be used according to local standar ds of care. Please report any  
antibiotic or growth factor use on the eCRF.

•Participants with combined Grade 2 AST/ALT and total bilirubin v alues meeting 
discontinuation parameters ( Section 8.1 ) should have treatment per manently discontinued.
•Drug-related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis must have  resolved to baseline before  
treatment is resumed. Participants with persistent Grade 1 pneum onitis after completion of a  
steroid taper over at least 1 month may be eligible for retreat ment if discussed with and 
approved by the BMS Medical Monitor.
•Participants who received systemic corticosteroids for managemen t of any drug-related  
toxicity must be off corticosteroids or have tapered down to an  equivalent dose of prednisone
≤10 mg/day.
•Drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only p hysiologic hormone  
replacement may resume treatment.
•Dose delay of nivolumab which results in treatment interruption  of > 6 weeks requires  
treatment discontinuation, with exceptions as noted in Section 8.1.
•Participants who delay study treatment due to any Grade 3 amylas e or lipase abnormality that  
is not associated with symptoms or clinical manifestations of p ancreatitis, which is assessed  
by the investigator to be related to ipilimumab and not to nivo lumab, may resume nivolumab  
when the amylase or lipase abnormality has resolved to Grade < 3. The BMS Medical Monitor 
should be consulted pri or to resuming nivolumab in such participants. 
7.4.3.2 Criteria to Resume Ipilimumab Dosing
Participants may resume treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab when drug-related AE(s)  
resolve(s) to Grade 1 or baseline value, with the following exceptions: 
•Participants may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fat igue.
•Participants who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug-related ski n AE may resume treatment  
in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity.
•Participants with baseline Grade 1 AST/ALT or total bilirubin wh o require dose delays for  
reasons other than a 2-grade shift in AST/ALT or total bilirubi n may resume treatment in the

•In general, participants who meet criteria to resume ipilimumab will also have met criteria to 
resume nivolumab, so it should be feasible to synchronize dosin g of both drugs when resuming 
ipilimumab. In  order to fac ilitate this, the dosing days of nivolumab and ipilimumab may b e 
adjusted within the permitted ±5 day window, as long as consecutive nivolumab doses are 
given at least 12 days apart.
•NOTE: One exception occurs when ipilimumab and nivolumab doses a re delayed due to 
drug-related Grade 3 amylase or lipase abnormalities not associ ated with symptoms or clinical 
manifestations of pancreatitis. If the investigator assesses th e Grade 3 amylase or lipase 
abnormality is rel ated to ipilimumab and not related to nivolumab, nivolumab may be resumed 
when the amylase or lipase abnormality resolves to Grade < 3 but ipilimumab may only resumewhen the amylase or lipase abnormality resolves to Grade 1 or b aseline. Investigator attribution 
of this toxicity to the ipilimumab dosing must be clearly noted  in the par ticipant' s medical 
chart. The BMS Medical Monitor should be consulted prior to res uming ipilimumab in the
participant. 
7.4.3.3 Criteria to Resume Treatment with Chemotherapy 
•Participants may resume treatment with chemotherapy when the ANC returns to 1500/ μl. l, the 
platelet count returns to 100,000/mm
3, and all other drug-related toxicities have returned to 
baseline or Grade 1 (or Grade 2 for alopecia and fatigue).
•If a participant fails  to meet criteria f or re-treatm ent, then re-treatment should be delayed, and 
the participant should be re-evaluated weekly or more frequently as clinically indicated. Any 
participant who fails to recover from toxicity attributable to c hemotherapy to baseline or Grade 
1 (except Grade 2 alopecia and fatigue) within 6 weeks from the  last dose given should 
discontinue the drug(s) that caused the delay.
•When resuming chemotherapy treatment, p lease follow the dose reduction recommendations 
in Section 7.4.2.2.
7.5 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
For nivolumab and ipilimumab, please refer to the current versi on of the Invest igator Brochures 
and/or pharmacy manual for complete storage, handling, dispensin g, and infusion information. 
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area a ccording to local regulations. It is 
the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that investiga tional product is only dispensed to 
study Participants. The investigational product must be dispens ed only from official study sites by 
authorized personnel according to local regulations.
The product storage manager should ensure that the study treatm ent is stored in accordance with 
the environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity)  as determined by BMS. If 
concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study treat ment arise, the study tr eatment
should not be dispensed and contact BMS immediately.Study treatment not supplied by BMS will be stored in accordance  with the package insert.
Investigational product documentation (whether supplied by BMS or not) must be maintained that 
includes all processes required to ensure drug is accurately ad ministered. This includes

7.7.2.1 Permitted Therapy
Participants are permitted the use of topical, ocular, intra-art icular, intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with  minimal systemic absorpti on). Adrenal rep lacement steroid doses > 10 mg 
daily prednisone are permitted. A brief (less than 3 weeks) cou rse of corticosteroids for 
prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non- autoimmune conditions 
(eg, delayed-type hypersensitivity r eaction cause d by a contact allergen) is permitted.
Regular concomitant use of bisphosphonates and RANK-L inhibitor s for prevention or reduction 
of skeletal-related events in pati ents with bone metastases is a llowed if initiated prior to first dose 
of study therapy. Prior palliative radiotherapy must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to 
treatment.
7.7.2.2 Palliative Local Therapy
Palliative local therapy, including palliative radiation therapy - and palliative surgical resection, to 
symptomatic non-target bone lesions, skin lesions, or CNS lesio ns is permitted prior to 
discontinuation of study treatment for participants who do not have evidence of overall clinical or 
radiographic progression per RE CIST 1.1. P alliative local therapy to lesions causing hemoptysis 
may also be permitted prior to discont inuation of study treatme nt in participants who do not have 
evidence of overall clinical or radiographic progression per RE CIST 1.1, provided that the lesions 
undergoing palliative local therapy are not the only sites of m easurable disease and the case is 
discussed with and approved by the BMS Medical Monitor.
Participants requiring palliative local therapy should be evalu ated for objective evidence of disease 
progression prior to the initiation of such therapy, particular ly if the most recent tumor assessment 
was more than 4 weeks prior to the start of local therapy. If p rogression per RECIST 1.1 is 
identified on any tumor assessments prior to the initiation of palliative local therapy, then 
participants must either discontinue study drug treatment or th ey must meet criteria to continue 
treatment beyond progression ( Section 7.1.3 ) in order to resume imm unotherapy after palliative 
local therapy. If radiographic progression per RECIST 1.1 is identified prior to the initiation of 
palliative local therapy, sites m ust request a BICR from the thi rd party radiology vendor
(Section 5.1.1.2 ). However, the initiation of palliative local therapy need not  be delayed to await 
the assessment by the BICR.
The potential for overlapping toxicities with radiotherapy and nivolumab/ipilimumab currently is 
not known; however, anecdotal d ata suggests that it is tolerable. As concurrent radiotherapy a nd 
nivolumab/ipilimumab have not been formally evaluated, in cases where palliative radiotherapy is 
required for a tumor lesion, th en nivolumab/ipilimumab s hould b e withheld for at least 1 week 
before, during, and 1 week after radiation. Participants should  be closely monitored for any 
potential toxicity during and after receiving radiotherapy, and  AEs should resolve to Grade 
≤ 1 prior to resuming nivolumab or nivolumab plus ipilimumab.
7.7.2.3 Imaging Restriction and Precautions
It is the local imagi ng facility’s respons ibility to determine,  based on participant attributes 
(eg, allergy history, diabetic history and renal s tatus), the appropr iate imaging mod ality and

contrast regimen for each participant. Imaging contraindication s and contrast risks should be 
considered in this assessment. Participants with renal insuffici ency should be assessed as to 
whether or not they s hould r eceive contrast and if so, what typ e and dose of contrast is appropriate. 
Should a participant have a contraind icatio n for CT IV contrast, a non-contrast CT of the chest and 
a contrast enhanced MRI of the abdomen and pelvis may be obtained.
Specific to MRI, participants with severe renal insufficiency (i e, estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) are at increased risk of ne phrogenic systemic  fibrosis. MRI 
contrast should not be given to this participant population. In addition, participants are excluded 
from MRI if they have tattoos, metallic implants, pacemakers, etc. The ultimate decision to 
perform MRI in an individual participant in this study rests wit h the site radiologist, the 
investigator and the standard set by the local Ethics Committee.7.8 Treatment After the End of the Study
At the end of the study, BMS will not continue  to provide BMS s upplied study treatment to 
participants/investigators unless BMS chooses to extend the study. The investigator should ensure 
that the participant receives appropriate standard of care to tr eat the condition under study.
BMS reserves the right to terminate access to BMS supplied stud y treatment if any of the following 
occur: a) the study is terminated due to safety concerns; b)the development of the nivolumab or 
ipilimumab is terminated for other reasons, including but not li mited to lack of efficacy and/or not 
meeting the study objectives; c)  the participant can obtain medi cation from a government 
sponsored or private health program. In all cases BMS will foll ow local regulations
8 DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA
8.1 Discontinuation from Study Treatment
For all participants, global d eterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of trea tment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as ‘symptomatic 
deterioration’ in the s ource data and in the case report form. Tumor assessments f or participants 
who discontinue study treatment without radiographic progressio n, confirmed by BICR
(Section 5.1.1.2 ), should continue as per protocol until radiographic progressi on is determined by 
blinded independent central review.
If participant is intolerant of nivolumab treatment during the chemotherapy cycles, participant
should be withdrawn from the treatment phase of the study.
Chemotherapy dose reduction i s allowed on study. Any participant with two prior dose reductions 
to one agent who experiences a toxicity that would cause a thir d dose reduction must be 
discontinued from that agent. A  participant in tr eatment arm who  is discontinued from the 
chemotherapy treatment will remain on the study and receive nivo lumab and ipilimumab therapy 
with option of pemetrex ed maintenance (non-squamous histology only).
If the investigator assesses the drug-related AE to be related to ipilimumab only and not related to 
nivolumab, ipilimumab dosing alone  may be discontinued while ni volumab dosing is delayed until 
the participant meets criteria to resume nivolumab treatment.

Except where specified below, che motherapy drugs in the platinu m doublet chemotherapy regimen 
or pemetrexed should be discontinued for any of the following:
•Any Grade ≥3 peripheral neuropathy
•Grade ≥3 drug-related thrombocytopenia a ssociated with clinically significant bleeding
•Any drug-related liver function test (LFT) abnormality that mee ts the following criteria 
requires discontinuation:
−AST or ALT > 5-10x ULN for > 2 weeks
−AST or ALT > 10x ULN
−Total bilirubin > 5 x ULN
−Concurrent AST or ALT > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN
•Any drug-related adverse event which recurs after two prior dos e reductions for the same 
drug-related adverse event requires discontinuation of the drug (s) which was/were previously 
dose reduced.
•Any Grade ≥3 drug-related hypersensi tivity reaction or i nfusion r eaction requires 
discontinuation of the drug(s) felt to be causing the reaction.  The drug not felt to be related to 
the hypersensitivity r eaction or infusion reaction may be continued.
•Any Grade 4 drug-related adverse event which the investigator d eems is inappropriate to be 
managed by dose reduction(s) requires discontinuation of the dr ug(s) felt to be causing the 
event. The drug not felt to be related to the event may be cont inued.
•Any event that leads to delay in dosing of any study drug(s) for > 6 weeks from the previous 
dose requires discontinuation of that drug(s) with the followin g exception:
−Dosing delays lasting > 6 weeks from the previous dose that occ ur for non-drug-related 
reasons may be allowed if approved by the BMS med ical monit or. Prior to re-initiating 
treatment in a participant wi th a dosing delay lasting > 6 weeks , the BMS medical monitor 
must be consulted. Periodic study visits to assess safety and l aboratory studies should also 
continue every 6 weeks or more frequently if clinically indicat ed during such dosing 
delays.
•Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illn ess which, in the judgment of 
the Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the p articipant with continued platinum 
doublet chemoth erapy dosing. Investigators should consult local  labeling for the chemotherapy 
drugs being administered to any given participant for additional  guidance on dose 
discontinuation.
•For participants in control arm for whom it was indicated that maintenance pemetrexed therapy 
would be administered, 4 cycles of chemotherapy s hould be given prior to starting the 
maintenance treatment. However, participants who experience gra de 4 treatment-related 
hematologic toxicity, or grade 3 treatment-related non-hematolo gic toxicity, may start

BMS-936558 nivolumab
maintenance therapy after 3 cycles of chemotherapy. The nature and grade of the toxicity must 
be clearly noted, and the medical monitor must be notified.
•In addition, participants receiving cisplatin with pemetrexed m ust discontinue cisplatin if the 
calculated creatinine clearance d ecreases to < 50 mL/min based on the Cockcroft Gault 
formula) The other drug (pemetrexed) may be continued, and the platinum agent may, at the 
investigator’s discretion, be switched to carboplatin for the r emainder of the platinum doublet 
cycles when the participant meets retreatment criteria.
Note: For participants in tr eatment arm, if the investigator is unable to d etermine whether an 
adverse event is due to nivo lumab or ipilimumab or platinum doublet chemotherapy, then all drugs 
must be discontinued. The assessment for discontinuation of nivo lumab and ipilimumab s hould be 
made separately from the assessment made for discontinuation of  chemotherapy doublet. If criteria 
for discontinuation for nivolumab and ipilimumab are met before  the nivolumab and ipilimumab 
plus platinum doublet chemotherapy cycles have been completed, platinum doublet chemotherapy 
may continue until 2 cycles  have been completed. 
A participant in treatment arm who is discontinued from the chem otherapy treatment due to 
toxicities related to chemotherapy only, will remain on the stud y and receive nivolumab and 
ipilimumab therapy.
8.2 Discontinuation from Study 
Participants who request to disc ontinue study treatment will remain in the study and must continue 
to be followed for protocol sp ecified follow-up procedures. The  only exception to this is when a 
participant specifically withdraws consent for any further cont act with him/her or persons 
previously authorized by participant to provide this informatio n. 
•Participants should notify the investigator of the decision to withdraw consent from future 
follow-up in writing, whenever possible.
•The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the m edical rec ords by the 
investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is from further trea tment with study treatment only 
or also from study proce dures and/or post treatment study follow-up, and entered on the  
appropriate CRF page.
•In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, 
publicly available information s hould be used to determine vital status only as appropriately 
directed in accordance with local law.
•If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future i nformation, the sponsor may 
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a wit hdrawal of consent.
In the case of pregnancy, the investigator must immediately not ify the BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee of this event. In the event a normal healthy fe male par ticipant become s pregnant 
during a clinical trial, the study t reatment must be discontinue d immediately. In most cases, the 
study treatment will be permanently discontinued in an appropria te manner (eg, dose tapering if 
necessary for participant safety). Please call the BMS Medical M onitor within 24 hours of 
awareness of the pregnancy. If the investigator d etermines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio 
that warrants continuation of study treatment, a discussion bet ween the investigator and the BMS 
Medical Monitor/designee must occur.
Date: 10-May-2017 69
1.0 Approved 930114362 1.0v
Clinical Protocol CA2099LA
BMS-936558 nivolumab
All participants who disc ontinue study treatment s hould comply with protocol specified follow-up 
procedures as outlined in Section 2 . The only exception to this requirement is when a participant
withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post-treat ment study follow-up or loses the 
ability to consent fr eely (ie, is imprisoned or involuntarily i ncarcerated for the treatment of either 
a psychiatric or physical illness).
If study treatment is discontinued prior to the participant’s co mpletion of the study, the reason for 
the discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s med ical records and en tered on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) page.
8.2.1 Post Study Treatment Study Follow-up
In this study, OS is a key endpoint of the study. Post study fol low-up is of criti cal importance and 
is essential to preserving participant safety and the integrity  of the study. Participants who 
discontinue study treatment must continue to be followed for co llection of outcome and/or survival 
follow-up data as required and in line with Section 5 until death or the conclusion of the study.
8.3 Lost to Follow-Up
•All reasonable efforts must be made to locate participants to d etermine and report their ongoing 
status. This include s follow-up with pers ons authorized by the participant.
•Lost to follow-up is defined by the inability to reach the part icipant after a minimum of three
documented phone calls, faxe s, or emails as well as lack of response by participant to one 
registered mail letter. All attempts should be documented in th e participant’s medical records.
•If it is determined that the participant has died, the site will  use permissible local methods to 
obtain date and cause of death.
•If investigator’s use of third party representative to assist i n the follow-up porti on of the  study 
has been included in the participant’s informed consent, then t he investigator may use a 
Sponsor retained third party representative to assist site staf f with obtaining participant’s 
contact information or other public vital s tatus data n ecessary to complete the follow-up 
portion of the study. 
•The site staff and representative will consult publicly availab le sources, such as public h ealth 
registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact in formation.
•If after all attempts, the participant remains lost to follow-u p, then the last known alive date as 
determined by the investigator should be reported and documente d in the participant’s medical 
records.
9 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
•Study procedures and timing are summarized in the Schedule of A ctivities. 
•Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed.
•All immediate safety concerns must be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue 
treatment.
•Adherence to the study design requirements, including those spe cified in the Schedule of 
Activities, is essential and required for study conduct.

Clinical Protocol CA2099LA
BMS-936558 nivolumab
•All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to con firm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria before randomization . The investigator will maintain a 
screening log to record details of all participants screened an d to confirm eligibility or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.
•Procedures conducted as part of  the participant’s routine clini cal management (eg, blood count) 
and obtained before signing of  informed consent may be utilized  for screening or baseline 
purposes provided the procedure meets the protocol-defined criteria and has been performed 
within the timeframe defined in the Schedule of Activities.
9.1 Efficacy Assessments
Study evaluations will take place i n accordance with the Schedule of Activities in Section 2 .
Images will be submitted to an imaging core lab. Sites should be trained prior to scanning the first 
study participant. Image acquisition guidelines and submission process will be ou tlined in the 
CA2099LA Imaging Charter to be provided by the core lab. 
9.1.1 Methods of Measurements
The following imaging assessments should be performed at pre-sp ecified intervals: CT of the 
chest, CT or MRI of the abdomen, pelvis, and other known sites of disease.
•Baseline assessment must occur prior to dosing
•CT scans should be acquired with s lice thickness of 5 mm or less with no intervening gap 
(continuous) 
•Should a par ticipant have a contraindicatio n for CT IV contrast, a non-contrast CT of the chest 
and a contrast enhanced MRI of the abdomen and pelvis and other  sites of disease may be 
obtained. MRIs s hould be ac quired with slice thickness of 5 mm or less with no gap 
(continuous).
•Every attempt should be made to image each participant using an  identical acquisition protocol 
on the same scanner for all imaging time points. 
NOTE: Use of CT component of a PET/CT scanner: Combined modalit y scanning, such as with 
FDG-PET/CT, is increasingly used  in clinical care and is a moda lity/technology that is in rapid 
evolution; therefore, the recommendations outlined here may cha nge rather quickly with time. If 
a site can document that the CT performed as part of a FDG-PET/ CT is of identical dia gnostic 
quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV contrast), then the CT port ion of the FDG-PET/CT can be used 
for RECIST 1.1 measurements. Note, however, that the FDG-PET po rtion of the scan int roduces 
additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not rou tinely or serially performed. 
MRI of brain is required at screening in order to rule out acti ve metastatic disease. 
Bone scan or PET scan is not adequate for assessment of RECIST 1.1 response in target lesions. 
In selected circumstances where such modalities are the sole mo dality used to assess certain non -
target organs, those non-target organs may be evaluated less fr equently. For example, bone scans 
may need to be repeated only when  complete re sponse is identifi ed in target disease or when 
progression in bone is suspected.

9.1.2 Imaging and Clinical Assessment 
Screening baseline tumor assessments must be performed within 2 8 days prior to randomization. 
In addition to the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and brain (to rule o ut brain metastases), all known sites 
of disease should be assessed at baseline. Subsequent assessmen ts should include chest, abdomen, 
pelvis, and all known sites of disease using the same imaging m ethod and technique as was used 
at baseline. 
Radiographic tumor response will be assessed at week 6 (± 7 days) from first dose date, then every 
6 weeks (± 7 days) for the first 12 months (until Week 48) and every 12 weeks (± 7 days) thereafter, 
until disease progression is documented or treatment is discont inued (whichever occurs later). 
Participants with a history of brain metastasis may have surveillance MRI approximately every 12 
weeks (± 7 days) from the d ate of first dose, or sooner if clinically indicated.
Tumor assessments for each participant s hould be submitted to the radiology vendor, as they are 
performed on an ongoing basis. The blinded, independent radiolo gists will review all av ailable 
tumor assessments for that given participant and determine if RE CIST 1.1 criteria for progression 
have been met. The independent assessment of whether or not the  given participant met RECIST 
1.1 criteria for progression will be provided to the site. Part icipants whose disease progression is 
not confirmed centrally will be required to continue tumor asse ssments (if clinically feasible) 
according to the protocol-specified schedule. 
The BICR will also rev iew tumor images in all tr eated participants to determine RECIST 1.1 
response for the analyses of ORR and PFS. Details of the BICR responsibilities and procedures 
will be specified in the BICR charter.
9.1.2.1 Assessment of Baseline Tumor Assessment
Screening/baseline imaging (ie, CT of the chest, CT or MRI of the  abdomen, pelvis, and other 
known sites of disease) should be submitted to the imaging core  lab. MRI preferred or CT scan of 
the brain should be performed w ithin 28 days of randomization and submitted to the imaging core 
lab. 
9.1.2.2 BICR Assessment of Progression
Sites should submit all scans to BICR on a rolling basis, preferably within 7 days of scan 
acquisition, th roughout the durati on of the study. BICR will re view scans on a rolling basis and 
remain blinded to treatment arm a nd investigator assessment of submitted scans. When progression 
is diagnosed by the inves tigator, the site will i nform the imag ing core lab, so that the BICR 
assessment of progression can be performed. 
Participants whose progression is not confirmed by the BICR wil l be required to continue tumor 
assessments (if clinically feasible) according to the protocol- specified schedule or sooner if 
clinically indicated until the BICR confirms progression on a s ubsequent tumor assessment. Also, 
if participants discontinue treatment without radiographic prog ression, tumor assessments will 
continue according to the protocol specified schedule, as noted in Section 2 , until progression has 
been confirmed by BICR.

9.1.3 Study Outcomes Research Assessments
The evaluation of health related quality of life is an increasi ngly important aspect of a clinical 
efficacy. Such data provides an understanding of the impact of treatment from the participants’ 
perspective and offers insights into the patient experience tha t may not be captured through 
physician reporting. Generic h ealth related quality of life s cales additionally  provide data 
necessary in calculat ing utility values for h ealth economic mod els. In this study, the EQ-5D (EQ-
5D-3L) will be co llected in order to assess the impact of study treatment on gen eric health related 
quality of life, which will also be used in populating health econo mic models most notably, cost 
effectiveness analysis. The Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) wi ll be collected to assess the 
impact of study treatment on patient reported disease-related s ymptoms.
The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of s elf-reported h ealth statu s. The 
EQ-5D includes a 5-dimension  descriptive system as w ell as a visual anal og rating s cale ( VAS). 
The EQ-5D descriptive system is comprised of the following 5-dimensions: mobility, self-care, 
usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Util ity data generated from the EQ-5D
3L are recommended for use in cost effectiveness analysis. The EQ-5D VAS records the participant’s self-rated h ealth s tatus on a 100-point ver tical visual anal ogue scale (0=worst 
imaginable health state, 100 = best imaginable h ealth s tate).
The LCSS is a validated instrument designed to assess the impact  of treatment on disease-related 
symptoms. It consists of 6 symptom-specific questions related to dyspnea, cough, fatigue, pain, hemoptysis and anorexia plus 3 summary items: symptom distress, interference with activity, and global health related quality of life (HRQoL). The questionnair e uses a 24-hour recall period. For 
the six individual symptom measures, the degree of impairment i s recorded on a 100 mm visual 
analogue scale with scores from 0 to 100 with zero representing  the best score. The LCSS average 
symptom burden index (ASBI) can be derived as the average of sc ores for the six symptom-related 
items. A clinically meaningful change in ASBI score has been de fined as 10 points.
9.2 Adverse Events
The definitions of an AE or serious adverse event (SAE) can be found in Appendix 3 .
AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant's legally a uthorized repre sentative). 
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detectin g, documenting, and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain resp onsible for following up AEs that 
are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the s tudy, or that caused the participant to 
discontinue before completing the study. 
Contacts for SAE reporting specified in Appendix 3
9.2.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
The collection of nonserious AE information s hould begin at init iation of study treatment and 
within 100 days of discontinuation of dosing at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of 
Activities ( Section 2 ).

Clinical Protocol CA2099LA
BMS-936558 nivolumab
Sections 5.6.1 a nd 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) repr esent the Reference Safety 
Information to determine expectedness of serious adverse events  for expedited reporting. 
Following the participant’s written consent to par ticipate in the study, all SAEs, whether related 
or not related to stud y drug, must be co llected, including thos e thought to be associated with 
protocol-specified procedures.
All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period (after signing the consent) and 
within 100 days of discontinuation of dosing. For participants ran domized to treatment and never 
treated with study drug, SAEs should be collected for 30 days fr om the date of  randomizat ion. If 
applicable, SAEs must be collected that relate to any later pro tocol-specified procedure (eg, a 
follow-up skin biopsy).
The investigator must report any SAE that occurs after these ti me periods and that is believed to 
be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure.
•Medical occurrences that begi n before the start of study treatm ent but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded on the appropriate section of the eCRF section.
•All SAEs will be rec orded and reported to Sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as i ndicated 
in Appendix 3 . 
•The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponso r within 24 hours of this being 
available.
Investigators are not obligated  to actively seek AEs or SAEs in  former study participants. 
However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a dea th, at any time after a participant 
has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the study 
treatment or study participation, t he investigator must promptl y notify the sponsor.
The method of evaluating, and assessing caus ality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for 
completing and reporting/transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3.
9.2.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported  or elicited  during open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a participant. (In order to preve nt reporting bias, pa rticipants should 
not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
9.2.3 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
•Nonserious AEs should be follo wed to resolution  or stabilizatio n, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section Appendix 3).
•Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause interr uption or discontinuation of 
study treatment and for those present at the end of study treatm ent as appropriate.
•All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on  the nonserious AE page of 
the CRF (paper or electronic). Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs 
and/or laboratory abnormalities that are reported/identified du ring the course of the study.
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required t o proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and non-serious AEs of  special interest (as defined in

Section 9.2.6 w ill be followed until resolution, until the c ondition stabilizes, until the event is  
otherwise explained, or until the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 8.3).
Further informatio n on follow- up procedures is given in Appendix 3.
9.2.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
•Prompt notification by the investigator to the Sponsor of SAEs is essential so that legal  
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a  
product under clinical investigation are met.
•An investigator who receives an i nvestigator safety report desc ribing SAEs or other specific  
safety information (eg, su mmary  or listing of SAEs) from the S ponsor w ill file it along with  
the Investigator’s Brochure and w ill notify the IRB/IEC, if appropri ate acc ording to local  
requirements.
Sponsor or designee w ill be reporting adverse events to regu latory authorities and ethics 
committees according to local applicable laws including Europea n Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA  
Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320. A SUSAR (S uspected, Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reaction) is a subset of SAEs and will be repor ted to the appropriate regulatory 
authorities and investigators following local and global  guidelines  and requirements.
9.2.5 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the study treatment, it is subsequen tly discovered that a participant is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposur e, including during at least 
5 half-lives after product administr ation, the investigator must immediately notify the BMS 
Medical Monitor/designee of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form 
to BMS Designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporting 
procedures described in Appendix 3
In most cases, the study treatment will be permanently discontin ued in an appropriate manner (eg, 
dose tapering if necessary for participant safety). Please call the BMS Medical Monitor within 
24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy.
Protocol-required procedures fo r study disconti nuation and foll ow-up must be performed on the
particpant.Follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, in cluding perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be re ported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be reported to 
Sponsor or designee. In order for Sponsor or designee to collect  any pregnancy surveillance 
information from the female partne r, the fe male pa rtner must si gn an informed consent form for 
disclosure of this information.  Information on this pregnancy w ill be collected on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.

BMS-936558 nivolumab
Immune-mediated AEs are specific events that include pneumoniti s, diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, 
nephritis/renal dys function, rash, and endocrine (adrenal insufficiency, 
hypothyroidism/thyroiditis, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus,  and hypophysitis) for which 
participants received immunosuppressive medication for treatmen t of the event, with the exception 
of endocrine events (hypothyroidism/thyroiditis, hyperthyroidis m, hypophysitis, diabetes mellitus, 
adrenal insufficiency), which are  included regardless of treatm ent since these events are often 
managed without immunosuppression.
IMAEs include events, regardless of causality, occurring within  100 days of the last dose. This list  
is subject to change based on Health Authority feedback or chan ge of MedDRA version. The final  
list used will be described in the CSR.
Table 9.2.6-1 below provides a summary of the IMAEs category and  their respective preferred

•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant to receive specific 
corrective therapy
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than  laboratory term would be used by the 
reporting investigator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value) .
9.2.8 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible, t imely confirmation of initial liver-related  laboratory abnormalities s hould 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 9.2 and Appendix 3  for reporting 
details).
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as: 
1. AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (UL N)
AND
2) Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without init ial findings of cholestasis ( elevated serum alkaline  
phosphatase),
AND
3) No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia,  
including, but not limi ted to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing ch ronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
9.2.9 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physica l examinations, electrocardiogram, 
x-ray filming, any other potential safety assessment required o r not required by protocol should  
also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate,  and reported accordingly.
9.3 OverdoseAn overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional adminis tration of any dose of a product that  
is considered both excessive and medically important. All occur rences of overdose must be  
reported as an SAE (see Section 9.2).

Population Description
Enrolled All participants who sign informed consent and were registered 
into the IWRS
Randomized All participants who we re randomized to either treatme nt arm. 
This is the primary dataset for analyses of demography, protoco l 
deviations, baseline characteristics, efficacy, and outcome 
research.
Treated All participants who received at least one dose of any study 
medication. This is the primary dataset for dosing and safety analysis.
The efficacy analysis for second ary endpoints will be performed  by treatment group as randomized
for all randomized participants.
10.3 Statistical Analyses
The statistical analysis plan will be developed and finalized be fore database lock and will describe 
the selection of participants to be included in the analyses, a nd procedures for accounting for 
missing, unused, and spurious data. Below is a su mmary of planned statistical analyses of the 
primary a nd secondary endpoints.
10.3.1 Efficacy Analyses
Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods
Primary Primary endpoint is OS wit h nivolumab a nd ipilimumab plus chemotherapy vs. 
chemotherapy alone. OS is defined as the time between the date of the 
randomization date and the date of death due to any cause. OS will be censored 
on the last date a participant was known to be alive.
Secondary •BICR assessed PFS with nivolumab and ipilimumab plus chemotherap y vs. 
chemotherapy alone
•BICR ORR with nivolumab and ipilimumab plus chemotherapy vs. 
chemotherapy alone
•ORR, PFS, and OS in nivolumab and ipilimumab plus chemotherapy vs. 
chemotherapy in subgroups with different PD-L1 expression level s
•Tumor cell total somatic mutations and their association with ORR , PFS, 
and OS
PFS is defined as the time from th e randomization date to the d ate of the first 
documented tumor progression as d etermined by the BICR (per REC IST 1.1), 
or death due to any cause. Participants who die without a repor ted prior 
progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of  their death. 
Participants who did not progress or die will be censored on th e date of their 
last evaluable tumor assessment. Participants who did not have a ny on study 
tumor assessments will be cen sored on the randomization d ate. Participants

Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods
who started any palliative local therapy or subsequent anti-can cer therapy 
without a prior reported progression will be censored at the la st evaluable tumor 
assessment prior to initiation of the palliative local therapy or subsequent anti-
cancer therapy, whichever procedure occurred first.
ORR is defined as the number of participants with a best overal l response 
(BOR) of confirmed CR or PR divided by the number of treated par ticipants. 
BOR is defined as the best response designation, as determined by the BICR, 
recorded between baseline and the date of objectively documente d progression 
per RECIST 1.1 or the date of initiation of p alliative local therapy or the date 
of initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever occu rs first. For 
participants without documented progression or palliative local  therapy or 
subsequent anti-cancer therapy, all available response designat ions will 
contribute to the BOR determination. For par ticipants who continue treatment 
beyond progression, the BOR will be determined based on respons e 
designations recorded up to the time of the init ial RECIST 1.1-defined 
progression. Complete or pa rtial responses may be claimed only if the criteria 
for each are met at a subsequent time point of ≥ 4 weeks later. F urther 
characterization of the response will include time to OR (time from first dosing 
date to first CR or PR) and depth of response (maximum tumor sh rinkage in 
target lesions).
10.3.1.1 Methods for Primary Endpoints
The efficacy analysis will be performed by tr eatment group as ra ndomized. For the primary 
endpoint, the distribution of OS will be compared in two random ized arms at the two interim and 
final analysis via a two-sided, log-rank test stratified by PD- L1, histology and gender with an 
overall significance level of 0.05. A group sequential testing procedure w ill be app lied to OS to 
control the overall ty pe I error for interim and final analyses . Hazard ratios and corresponding 
two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be estimated using  a Cox proportional hazard model, 
with treatment group as a sing le covariate, stratified by above factors. OS curves OS medians with 
95% CIs, and OS rates at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 , and 48 months with 9 5% CIs will be estimated using 
Kaplan-Meier methodology if follow-up requirement is met.
10.3.1.2 Methods for Secondary EndpointsThe efficacy analysis for second ary endpoints will be performed  by treatment group as randomized
for all randomized participants. PFS comparison will be conducte d. The comparison will be based 
on a two-sided stratified log-rank test, stratified by PD-L1, h istology and gender at a two-sided 
alpha of 0.05 level. Hazard ratios and corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) will 
be estimated using a Cox proportional hazard model, with tr eatment group as a single covariate, 
stratified by above factors. PFS curves, PFS medians with 95% C Is, and PFS rates at 6, 12, 18, 24, 
36, and 48 months with 95% CIs will be estimated using Kaplan-M eier methodology if follow-up 
requirement is met.

The comparison of ORR as per BICR assess ment will be conducted using a two-sided Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by PD-L1, histology and g ender to compare the treatment 
group to the control group. An estimate of the difference in OR Rs and their corresponding 95% 
exact CI will also be calculated. The number and percentage of participants in each category of 
best overall response per BICR (confirmed comp lete res ponse [CR ], confirmed partial response 
[PR], stable disease [SD], progressive disease [PD], or unable to determine [UD]) according to the 
BICR will be presented, by tr eatment group. An estimate of the response rate and an associated 
exact two-sided 95% CI (Clopper and Pearson) will be presented, by treatment group.
ORR, PFS and OS w ill also be assessed by tr eatment groups withi n subgroups of PD-L1 
expression levels: PD-L1 positive, PD-L1 negative, PD-L1 not qu antifiable. The pre-specified 
TMB thresholds will be used to  categorize participants in subgro ups. ORR, PFS and OS w ill be 
assess by TMB subgroups.
10.3.2 Safety Analyses
Safety analysis will be performed in all treated participants. Analysis on rando mization phase w ill 
be based on treatment groups. Descriptive statistics of safety w ill be presented using National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse E vents (CTCAE) version 4.0. 
All on-study AEs, drug related AEs, SAEs and drug-r elated SAEs, AEs and drug-related AEs 
leading to drug discontinuation will be tabulated using worst grade per NCI CTCAE v 4.0 criteria 
by system organ class and preferred term, based on MedDRA termi nology. On-study lab 
parameters including hematology, coagulation, chemistry, liver function and renal function will 
be summarized using worst grade per NCI CTCAE v 4.0 criteria.
A tabular summary of the incidence of overall IMAEs (by preferred term) and serious IMAEs will 
be performed. Frequency, management and resolution of IMAEs wil l be analyzed and a descriptive 
analysis of IMAEs including time-to-onset, severity, duration, action taken with the study drug, 
dosing delays of the study d rug, corticosteroi d details, re-cha llenge information and outcome of 
the AE will be individually characterized by IMAE category (see Section 9.2.6 ).
Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods
Exploratory Safety and tolerability objectives will be measured by the incidence of adverse 
events, serious events, deaths, and laboratory  abnormalities.

10.3.6 Interim Analyses 
Two formal interim analysis for the OS are planned after 163 an d 198 deaths have been observed 
respectively, which are expecte d to occur approximately 18 and 21 months after study initiation. 
At the time of the interim analysis, the DMC will review efficac y and safety data as specified in 
the DMC charter. This formal comparison of OS will allow for ea rly stopping for superiority. Lan-
DeMets alpha spending function with O’Brien and F leming type of boundary will be used. The 
stopping boundary will depe nd on the actual number of deaths at  the time of the interim analysis. 
In addition to the formal planned interim analyses for OS, the DMC will have access to periodic 
unblinded interim reports of efficacy and safety to allow a ris k/benefit assess ment. The Statistical 
Analysis Plan will further describe the planned interim analyse s.

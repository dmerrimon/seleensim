CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol Summary  
Name of 
Sponsor:  Proteon Therapeutics, Inc.  
Study Number 
and Title:  PRT-201-320: Multicenter, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study 
of Vonapanitase ( PRT-201) Administered Immediately after 
Radiocephalic Arteriovenous Fistula Creation in Patients with 
Chronic Kidney Disease  
Clinical Phase:  Phase 3  
Investigators 
and Study 
Centers : The study will be conducted at approximately 40 sites.  
Number of 
Patients : Six hundred ( 600) patients  with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) will be 
treated.  
Objective:  To assess the efficacy and safety  of vonapanitase  administered 
immediately after radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) creation.  
Endpoints:  The co -primary efficacy endpoint s are secondary  patency and AVF 
use for hemodialysis.  Secondary patency is defined as the time from 
AVF creation until AVF abandonment .  AVF use for hemodialysis is 
defined as the ability of the study AVF to be successfully cannulated 
and used for hemodialysis for a minimum of 90 days or at least 30 
days prior to a patient’s last visit, if hemodialysis had not been 
initiated at least 90 days prior to the last visit. 
Additional  efficacy endpoint s are unassisted AVF use for 
hemodialysi s, primary  unassisted patency , AVF maturation by 
ultrasound criteria, unassisted AVF maturation by ultrasound criteria , 
the rate of procedures performed to the AVF , and the rate of 
procedures  to restore or maintain AVF patency . 
Safety endpoints are incidence of adverse events (AEs) that include 
clinically significant adverse changes in physical examination, duplex 
Doppler ultrasound, clinical laboratory evaluations, and 
immunogenicity  testing  results.  
Methodology:  This is a randomized, double -blind comparison of vonapanitase  
versus placebo. Eligible patients are either receiving hemodialysis or 
expecting to initiate hemodialysis and require the creation of a 
radiocephalic AVF. Patients are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either 
vonapanitase  0.03 mg or placebo. Patients are strati fied based on 
hemodialysis status at the time of randomization . 
The study consists of a  4-week screening period, a 1 -day treatment 
Proteon Therapeutics, Inc.  Page 4 of 46 
Edition 05: 09 May 2018  Clinical Protocol PRT -201-320 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  period , and up to 12  months of follow -up. Patients whose study AVF 
has not been abandoned at Month 12 will be enrolled into a  registry 
and will remain in the registry for 2 years, or until the AVF has been 
abandoned, whichever comes first .  
Screening: At the beginning of the 4 -week screening period patients 
will provide written consent and be assessed for eligibility. The 
assessments include: evaluation of inclusion/exclusion criteria , review 
of medical history, physical examination, and clinical laboratory 
evaluations including serum pregnancy testing in women of 
childbearing potential. Results from the screening visit and 
evalu ations conducted as part of routine standard of care are used to 
determine study eligibility and are completed as close to the time of 
AVF creation as possible, but no longer than 28 days prior to the 
scheduled surgery.  
Treatment: On the day of surgery, the surgeon connects the end of a 
transected cephalic vein to the side of a radial artery in th e arm, 
exposing approximately 3 cm of the outflow vein. The surgery to 
create the AVF will proceed according to the standard practice of the 
institution and surgeon. Immediately after creation of the 
radiocephalic AVF, the surgeon treats the exposed inflow artery, 
anastomosis, and outflow vein with the study drug for 10 minutes by 
administering a series of drops. Evaluation of the AVF is conducted 
prior to the pat ient leaving the recovery area.  
Follow -up: Patients return at  Week s 2 and 4, and Months  3, 6, 9, and 
12 post surgery for clinic al safety assessments and evaluation of the 
AVF and upper extremity. A duplex Doppler ultrasound is performed 
at Week  4 and  Month 3. 
The Proteon Medical Monitor provides continuing review of safety 
data in a blinded manner throughout the trial. In addition, a Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC), independent of Proteon and operating 
under a pre -specified charter, reviews accumulat ed safety data at an 
appropriate interval.

Product, Dose , 
and Mode of 
Administration : Vonapanitase  (PRT -201) is a recombinant human chymotrypsin -like 
elastase family member 1 (CELA1) elastase intended for local 
application immediately following surgical creation of a radiocephalic 
AVF. Vonapanitase is supplied as a lyophilized powder in a single 
use glass vial with a rubber stopper. Th e placebo is identical in 
appearance and composition to vonapanitase  but lacks the active 
ingredient. 
The investigational drug is administered topically by the surgeon to 
the external surface of surgically exposed blood vessels as a single 
application. 
Randomization:  Randomizations occur utilizing an interactive voice response system 
(IVRS) or interactive web response system (IWRS). Patients are 
randomized by site in a 2:1 ratio to either vonapanitase  0.03 mg or 
placebo, stratified by hemodialysis status  at the time of randomization 
and balance will be maintained by blocking within site.  
Duration of 
Treatment : Single a pplication administered over 10 minutes.

Edition 05: 09 May 2018  Clinical Protocol PRT -201-320 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Statistical 
Methods : Demographic data, medical history, and other baseline characteristics 
will be summarized by treatment received. Statistical comparisons 
between treatment groups will be performed to assess baseline 
imbalances. Safety evaluation s will be based on AE s, clinically 
significant adverse changes in the patient’s physical examination , 
duplex Doppler ultrasound, clinical laboratory evaluations, and 
immunogenicity testing results . 
The co -primary efficacy endpoint s are AVF secondary  patency and 
AVF use for hemodi alysis.  Secondary patency is defined as the time 
from AVF creation until AVF abandonment . AVF use for 
hemodialysis is defined as the ability of the study AVF to be 
successfully cannulated and used for hemodialysis for a minimum of 
90 days or at least 30 days prior to a patient’s last visit, if 
hemodialysis had not been initiated at least 90 days prior to the last 
visit.  
Additional  efficacy endpoint s are unassisted AVF use for 
hemodialysi s, primary unassisted patency , AVF maturation by 
ultrasound criteria, unassisted AVF maturation by ultrasound criteria , 
the rate of procedures performed to  the AVF , and the rate of 
procedures to restore or maintain AVF patency . 
Secondary patency time will be estimated by the 25th, 50th (median), 
and 75th percentiles calculated by using the Kaplan -Meier life test 
methods to estimate the survival functions. A log- rank test will be 
used to test the equality of the survival curves between vonapanitase  
and placebo. A graph of the survival probability over time will be 
presented.  
 
The number and percentage of patients with AVF use for 
hemodialysis will be summarized by treatment group. Vonapanitase 
vs. placebo will be tested using a Chi -square test.

CONFIDENTIAL  1. BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
An arteriovenous fistula (AVF), in particular a radiocephalic AVF, is the most desirable form of 
vascular access for hemodialysis. [ 1, 2] However, approximately 50% of AVFs will lose primary 
patency within the first year. [3 -6] This is due primarily to neointimal hyperplasia, a form of 
vascular scarring, most commonly at the arteriovenous anastomosis and adjacent outflow vein, 
that leads to progressive lumen stenosis and manifests as diminishe d AVF blood flow, venous 
hypertension, and thrombosis. [7] Patency loss is addressed via interventional procedures such as 
thrombectomy and balloon angioplasty , and  surgical revision . [8] Interventions to restore or 
maintain patency  are characterized by po or post -intervention patency. [9] Approxima tely 50% of 
the AVFs require re- interventio n within 1 year possibly due to vessel injury caus ed by the 
intervention. [10- 12] 
An AVF is abandoned when it can no longer be used for hemodialysis as it may be unable t o 
provide adequate blood flow and/or it is deemed unsafe for the patient, and the associated 
problem cannot be corrected by an intervention, including medical, surgical, or radiological 
intervention, or rest . Abandonment is synonymous with secondary patenc y loss. [9]  
Approximately  25% of AVFs will lose secondary patency within the first year . [3, 6] 
Radiocephalic AVFs are even more likely to lose primary and secondary patency within the first 
year. [13]  
Patency loss is a significant risk factor for non- use of the AVF for hemodialysis. Approximately 
50% of all new AVFs will never become usable for hemodialysis. [5, 14] In patients on 
hemodialysis, this requires hemodialysis to occur through a hemodialysis catheter until another 
permanent hemodialysis access s ite can be established.  
A local treatment that safely prolong s patency of a radiocephalic AVF would be welcomed by 
patients and health care providers. Successful treatment could increase the success of AVF 
surgery, increase the chance that patients would d ialyze with an AVF, and reduce the number of 
procedures to the  AVF.  
 DESCRIPTION OF INVES TIGATIONAL DRUG  
Vonapanitase (VOE -nah-pan-uh-tayse) is the generic name (United States Annotated 
Name/International Nonproprietary Name) for the investigational drug under development. It has 
previously been referred to in other documentation by its company code name, PRT -201. The 
investigational drug consists of lyophilized vonapanitase  or placebo. Each vial of vonapanitase  
contains 0.036 mg of protein. Reconstitution with 3  mL sterile water yields 0.012  mg/mL 
vonapanitase  solution containing 10 mM sodium phosphate, 55 mM  NaCl, 3%  mannitol, 
1% trehalose, and 0.01%  polysorbate  80. The placebo is identical in appearance to vonapanitase  
but lacks the active ingredient . 
At the time of dosing 2.5  mL (0.03 mg) is withdrawn and topically administered.

CONFIDENTIAL  
 STUDY RATIONALE  
Vonapanitase  is a locally acting recombinant human elastase that in the appropriate dose and 
setting can enlarge blood vessels, increase blood flow, or inhibit neointimal hyperplasia. In an 
AVF P hase 2 study, patients undergoing creation of a radiocephalic AV F and tre ated with 
vonapanitase  0.03 mg experienced prolonged AVF primary unassisted patency (time from access 
creation to a first patency loss event), fewer procedures to restore or maintain patency, prolonged 
secondary patency, and increased proportion with AVF m aturation (by ultrasound criteria) and 
use for hemodialysis compared with placebo treated patients. [13, 15] In a recently completed 
Phase 3 study (PRT -201-310) preliminary results showed patients undergoing creation of a 
radiocephalic AVF and treated with  vonapanitase  0.03 mg experienced prolonged secondary 
patency and an in creased proportion of patients using  their fistula for hemodialysis.   The 
radiocephalic AVF is the  form of access recommended by the National Kidney Foundation’s 
Kidney Disease Outcomes  Quality Initiative ( KDOQI ) Guidelines  [2] and preferred by 
clinicians. No dose -related increases in adverse events (AEs) were observed in the study.  Based 
on the results of prior clinical stud ies, this phase 3 study will exa mine the effect of vonapanitas e 
0.03 mg on radiocephalic AVF secondary patency and AVF use for hemodialysis ( co-primary 
efficacy endpoint s), and other additional efficacy endpoints ( unassisted AVF use for 
hemodialysis, primary unassisted patency, AVF maturation by ultrasound criteria, unassisted 
AVF maturation by ultrasound criteria, the rate of procedures performed to  the AVF , and the rate 
of procedures to restore or maintain AVF patency ). 
2. STUDY OBJECTIVE  
To assess the efficacy and safety of vonapanitase  administered immediately after radiocephalic 
AVF creation.  
3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
Vonapanitase  is a recombinant human elastase intended for local application immediately 
following surgery to create a radiocephalic AVF.  
 METHODOLOGY  
This i s a phase 3, randomized, double -blind comparison of vonapanitase  versus placebo . Eligible 
patients are stratified by hemodialysis status and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either vonapanitase  
0.03 mg or placebo. Investigators at approximately 40 centers will enroll 6 00 patients with 
chronic kidney disease ( CKD) who require the creation of a radial artery to cephalic vein 
(radiocephalic) AVF.  
The study consists  of a 4 -week screening period, a 1 -day treatment period , and up to 12 months 
of follow -up. Results from the screening visit and evaluations conducted as part of routine 
standard of care are used to determine patient eligibility and are completed as close to the time of 
Proteon Therapeutics, Inc.  Page 13 of 46 
Edition 05: 09 May 2018  Clinical Protocol PRT -201-320 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  AVF creation as possible, but no longer than 28 days prior to the scheduled surgery ( see 
Section  5.1). Significant medical events since S creening will be reviewed and recorded as part of 
the patient’s medical history.  Patien t randomization will occur at the time of surgery utilizing an 
interactive voice response system (IVRS) or interactive web response system (IWRS) . 
In most cases, the AVF surgical procedure is conducted in an operating room as an outpatient 
procedure. The s urgeon connects the end of a transected cephalic vein to the side of a radial 
artery in th e arm, exposing approximately 3  cm of the outflow vein. The AVF surgery proceeds 
according to the standard practice of the institution and surgeon. Immediately after creation of 
the AVF, the surgeon treats the exposed inflow artery, anastomosis, and outflow vein topically 
with the study drug  for 10  minutes by administering a series of drops. The intent is  to keep the 
vessels wet for 10  minutes. After dosing, the surgeon irrigates the surgical site with generous 
amounts of saline before and after closing the surgical incision. Evaluation of the AVF site is 
conducted prior to the patient leaving the recovery area.  
Additional clinical safety assessments and evaluation of t he AVF occur at Week s 2 and 4, and 
Months  3, 6, 9, and 12 post  study drug administration. All AE s are collected until Week  4; A Es 
associated with the AVF extremity and all A Es that result in death are collected until Month 12. 
Following the Month 12 visit, patients whose study AVF has not been abandoned will be 
enrolled into a registry in which clinical events and outcomes pertaining to the AVF treated with 
the study drug will be collected. Study staff will contact the patient, their physician(s), their 
dialysis unit or other sources as appropriate every 3 months to collect information about the 
initiation of hemodialysis and procedures performed on the AVF treated with the study drug. The 
patient will remain in the registry for 2 years, or until the AVF has  been abandoned, whichever 
comes first.  
An ultrasound will be performed at the Week  4 and Month 3 visits according to a standard 
duple x Doppler ultrasound protocol. A blinded central reader will assess outflow vein luminal 
diameters , blood flow volume , and hemodynamic ally significant lumen stenosis . Results from 
the central reader will not be shared with the clinical site.  
The Proteon Medical Monitor will provide continuing review of safety data, in a blinded manner, 
throughout the trial. An independent Dat a Monitoring Committee (DMC) comprised o f a 
biostatistician, and two  medical doctors , at least one of whom is an expert  in the field of 
hemodialysis access,  will review accumulat ed blinded safety data once 150 patients have been 
treated and have completed the Week  4 visit.  
4. STUDY POPULATION

CONFIDENTIAL  
 EXCLUDED MEDICATIONS  
The following medications should not be applied topically in the surgical field or be contained in 
the lavage fluid during the creation of the AVF. These medications have been shown to inhibit 
the activity of vonapanitase . 
• Procaine  
• Bicarbonate solution 
• Vancomycin  
Intravenous (IV) vancomycin and topical lidocaine in normal saline, but not bicarbonate 
solution, are accepta ble. 
In addition, ultrasound acoustic gel has been shown to inhibit the activity of vonapanitase  and 
should not  be used in the surgical field. After the surgical incision  is closed, ultrasound acoustic 
gel can be used.  
5. STUDY SCHEDULE  
The assessments to be performed during the study are outlined below. The day the patient 
receives study drug (the day of surgery to create the AVF) is considered “Day 1 .” Refer to 
Appendix A  for the table describing the Schedule of Assessments.  
 SCREENING : VISIT  1 (UP TO DAY - 28) 
All patients sign written informed consent before any protoc ol-specific screening procedures are 
conducted. Results from the screening period and evaluations conducted as part of routine 
standard of care are used to determine study eligibility and are completed as close to the time of 
AVF creation as possible, but no longer than 28 days prior to the scheduled surgery.  
All patients will have the following procedures completed in the screening period once written 
informed consent has been obtained:  
1. Collection of demographic information, hemodialysis vascular access history, and medical 
history.  
2. Collection o f concomitant medication information.  
3. Physical examination , including height and weight. 
4. Colle ction of blood samples for anti -vonapanitase  antibody detection ( see Section  6.2.4) 
and clinical laboratory evaluations including a serum pregnancy test in women of 
child bearing potential ( see Section  6.2.5 and Appendix B  for details).  Refer to the 
Laboratory Manual for collection, processing , and shipping information.

CONFIDENTIAL  
 AVF SURGERY: VISIT  2 (DAY 1)  
5.2.1 PRE -SURGERY  
Any change in clinical condition since S creening ( Visit 1) is assessed. Signifi cant medical events 
since Visit 1 are recorded as part of the patient’s medical history . 
The patient is randomized at the time of surgery, utilizin g an IVRS or IWRS . 
5.2.2 SURGICAL PROCEDURES  
In most cases, the AVF surgical procedure  is conducted in an operating room as an outpatient 
procedure. The surgeon connects the end of a transected cephalic vein to the side of a radial 
artery in the ar m, exposing approximately 3 cm of the outflow vein, with the intent of creating a 
fistula that would be cannulated below the elbow . The AVF surgery proceeds according to the 
standard practice of the institution and surgeon. The surgical parameters that are important to 
record during the intraoperative phase are described in the case report form (CR F) completion 
guidelines; source document worksheets are provided by Proteon to help facilitate data 
collection . 
5.2.2.1 Study Drug Administration 
See Section  4.5 (Excluded Medications) for medications that should be avoided during s urgery.  
Procedures after AVF creation but before closure of incision:  
1. The surgical site should be rinsed generously with saline. 
2. The surgical site should be dry without ongoing bl eeding during study drug administration.  
3. Study drug, 2.5 mL  of solution, is administered using a s terile syringe  (3 mL suggested) 
fitted  with a 22 gauge angiocatheter.  
4. The surgeon administers the study drug in a series of drops t o the exposed inflow artery  
(1 drop), anastomosis (1 drop) , and the out flow vein (4  drops) every 20 seconds for 
10 minutes, f or a total of approximately 180 drops. After 5 minutes of dosing the surgeon 
shoul d check that approximately 1.25 mL of dosing solution has been administered. The 
number of drops should be adjusted accordingly based on this check (i.e., extra drop(s) 
every 20  seconds if less than 1.25 mL was used in the first 5  minutes, or fewer drops if 
more than 1.25 mL was used).  
5. The objective of study drug administration is  to keep the vessels wet with  the solution for 
the entire 10  minutes of treatment and to deliver the entire dose. Any dosing solution 
remaining in the syringe should be administered with the final application.  If the drug 
pools around the AVF it does not need to be aspirated unless it is blood tinged since blood 
inhibits vonapanitase activity .

CONFIDENTIAL  6. At the end of 10 minutes, the surgeon irrigates the surgical site with s aline lavage 
continuously for 1 minute to remove any study drug .  
7. The surgeon closes the incis ion per usual clinical practice and washes the incision an d 
surrounding skin with saline.

(See s ection  6.2.4 and the Laboratory Manual for collection, processing and shipping 
information). 
5. If a patient tests positive for anti- vonapanitase  antibodies at the Month 6 visit (or at 
Week  4 without  a Month 6 test result), an ad ditional blood sample is drawn at the 
Month 12 visit (See s ection  6.2.4 and the Laboratory Manual for collection, processing and 
shipping informati on).  
 HANDLING OF WITHDRAW ALS  
It is important to collect safety data on any patient who withdraws from the study before their 
last scheduled visit. A withdrawal is defined as  a patient leaving the study with an AVF that has 
not been abandoned.  
If voluntary withdrawal occurs, the patient should be asked to return for their next scheduled 
evaluation (e.g., next study visit) in order to complete an end -of-study evaluation, and be given 
appropriate care until the symptoms of any AE  resolves or the patient’s condition becomes 
stable. At minimum, the patient should be questioned over the telephone about any changes in 
clinical condition since their last visit, the status of any ongoing AE s, information regarding the 
initiation of hemodialysis, and proc edures  performed on the AVF.  
Discontinuation because  of an AE  is of particular interest and every effort should be made to 
follow the patient until the event resolves, the patient’s condition stabilizes or is fully 
Proteon Therapeutics, Inc.  Page 20 of 46 
Edition 05: 09 May 2018  Clinical Protocol PRT -201-320 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  characterized, the event returns to basel ine value (if a baseline value is available), or it is shown 
that the event is not attributable to the study drug or study conduct . Appropriate supportive 
and/or definitive therapy is administered as required. 
 HANDLING OF AVF ABANDONMENT  
If a patient’s stu dy AVF is abandoned, the following visit schedule should be followed:  
• If the study fis tula is abandoned prior to Week 4 (Visit 4), the patient is expected to 
return for all office visits through Week  4 (Visit 4). If the fistula is thrombosed or ligated 
and abandoned prior to Week  4, an ultrasound is not required at the Week  4 visit. If the 
fistula is abandoned for another reason then an ultrasound is required at the Week 4 visit. 
The patient’s participation will be considered complete at the Week  4 visit.  
• If the study fistula is abandoned after Week  4 (Visit  4), the patient is expected to return 
for their next scheduled visit. If the decision to abandon the fistula is made at an office 
visit (i.e. , patient comes in for the Month 3 visit and the investigator  decides the fistula is 
not salvageable) then this will serve as their  final office visit and the end -of-study 
evaluations can be completed. The patient’s participation will be considered complete.  
 KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATI ON 
If a patient receives a kidney transplant bef ore Week  4 (Visit 4), the patient is expected to return 
for all office visits through Week 4 (Visit 4). If a patient receives  a kidney transplant after 
Week  4 (Visit 4), the patient is expected to return for their next scheduled visit. All ultrasounds 
should be performed as scheduled. Patients who receive a kidney transplant will not be followed 
in a registry.  
 LONG -TERM  OUTCOMES AND P HARMACOECONOMIC A NALYSES  
Patients s igning informed consent will have a greed to the collection of long -term clinical 
outcome information and the sharing of identifying information (Social Security Number or 
Health Insurance Claim/Beneficiary Identification Code) with the Centers for Medicare  and 
Medicaid Services (CMS) and/or the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) , unless 
otherwise stated or agreed upon in the ICF . Each patient’s study information will be linked with 
information from a CMS and/or USRDS database. The linked inform ation wi ll be de -identified 
and used to analyze long -term outcomes not directly captured in the study (e.g., hospitalizations, 
and procedures after study completion) and to conduct pharmacoeconomic analyses of the costs 
associated with vascular access management, including access creations , patency loss events , and 
abandonments.  
In addition, patients will have agreed to the long term collection of data pertaining to the AVF 
treated with the study drug in a registry for 2  years . Following the Month 12 visit, patients whose 
study AVF has not been abandoned will be enrolled into a registry in which clinical events and 
Proteon Therapeutics, Inc.  Page 21 of 46 
Edition 05: 09 May 2018  Clinical Protocol PRT -201-320 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  outcomes pertaining to the AVF treated with the study drug will be collected . Clinical site staff 
will contact the patient, the hemodialysis unit, or a r elevant physician every 3  months ( ± 14 days) 
to collect information on the date of successful initial cannulation of the study AVF, current use 
of the study AVF for hemodialysis, reasons for non- use, and procedures  performed on the study 
AVF (e.g., thrombe ctomy, angioplasty) . Information will be collected for 2 years or until the 
AVF  is abandoned, whichever comes first.  
6. PROCEDURES AND EVALUATIONS  
 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY 
The co -primary efficacy endpoint s are AVF secondary  patency  and AVF use for hemodialysis . 
Secondary  patency is defined as the time from AVF creation until AVF abandonment . AVF use 
for hemodialysis is defined as the ability of the study AVF to be successfully cannulated and 
used for hemodialysis for a minimum of 90 days or at least 30 days pri or to a patient’s last visit, 
if hemodialysis had not been initiated at least 90 days prior to the last visit.  Additional efficacy 
endpoints are unassisted AVF use for hemodialysis, primary unassisted patency, AVF maturation 
by ultrasound criteria, unassi sted AVF maturation by ultrasound criteria, the rate of procedures 
performed to  the AVF , and the rate of procedures to restore or maintain AVF patency.  
6.1.1 AVF DISPOSITION  
Disposition of the study AVF is recorded following surgery and at Weeks  2 and 4, and at 
Months  3, 6, 9, and 12. AVF disposition includes whether or not the study AVF is patent, the 
patient is on hemodialysis, central venous catheter use, the study AVF is being used for 
hemodialysis or  reason not being used, the date of  first successful cannul ation , and most recent 
Kt/V or URR , as available. 
Data on AE s of thrombosis , and procedures  performed on the study AVF (e.g., angiography, 
thrombectomy, angioplasty) including the clinical reason the patient was referred for a procedure 
are collected at all follow -up visits. 
Use of the AVF for hemodialysis is defined as the ability of the study AVF to be successfully 
cannulated and used for hemodialysis with two needles for a minimum of 3 months . If a patient 
does not initiate hemodialysi s at least 3 months  before their  last office visit then the AVF must 
have been in use for at least 1 month and still be in use at their last office visit to meet the 
definition of usable.  
6.1.2 ABANDONMENT  
Abandonment of the study AVF is evaluated at Weeks  2 and  4 and at Months  3, 6, 9, and 12. 
Abandonment is defined as a fistula that can no longer be used for hemodialysis as it may be 
unable to provide adequate blood flow and/or it is deemed unsafe for the patient, and the 
Proteon Therapeutics, Inc.  Page 22 of 46 
Edition 05: 09 May 2018  Clinical Protocol PRT -201-320 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  associated problem cannot be corrected by an intervention, including medical, surgical , or 
radiological intervention , or rest . [9] If a patient’s study AVF requires a surgical revision 
whereby the anastomosis  treated with the study drug  is taken down and a new anastomosis is 
created, the fistul a should be considered abandoned for the purposes of the study. The follow -up 
visit schedule outlined in Section 5.8 should be followed. 
6.1.3 ULTRASOUND E VALUATION 
AVF maturation is evaluated by ultrasound according to a standard ultrasound protocol at 
Week  4 (Visit 4) and Month 3 (V isit 5). All ultrasound examinations will be sent to a core 
imaging lab for review by an experienced ultrasound expert ( VasCore, Massachuse tts General 
Hospital, Boston, MA  USA). The core imaging lab oratory  will remain blinded to the study 
treatme nt during ultrasound analysis.  
 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
Safety evaluations ar e based on clinical examination of the AVF and upper extremit y, AE s, 
physical examination, duplex Doppler ultrasound, clinical laboratory evaluation, and 
immunogenicity testing results . Safety me asurements are described below.  
6.2.1 AVF AND UPPER EXTREM ITY EXAMINATION 
AVF patency is evaluated by clinical examination immed iately following surgery and at 
Week s 2 and 4, and Months  3, 6, 9, and 12. The examination of the AVF is performed by a 
qualified member of the study team. The examination of the AVF include s an evaluation of the 
thrill and puls e at the anastom otic site , the bruit 10 cm downstream from the anastomotic site , 
and outflow vein distension with the arm below and above the level of the heart . Clinically 
significant a bnormal adverse physical findings of the AVF are noted as AE s. 
Particular attention is given to e vidence of vascular steal syndrome, excessive swelling, 
aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, hematoma, seroma, infection, and abnormal wound healing. The 
following definitions are used for assessing patients enrolled into this protocol:  
Definitions and Classification : 
1. Vascular steal syndrome: cold and painful extremity distal to the AVF.  
2. Aneurysm: a progressive pathological expansion of the AVF vein due to weakness, but not 
disruption, of the vein wall. 
3. Pseudoaneurysm : an out -pouching of the AVF vein involving a defect in all three layers of 
the vein wall with bleeding that is contained by a blood clot or surrounding structures.  
4. Hematoma: a localized mass of extravasated blood.  
5. Seroma: a localized accumulation of serum.  
Proteon Therapeutics, Inc.  Page 23 of 46 
Edition 05: 09 May 2018  Clinical Protocol PRT -201-320 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  6. Infection: infections will be classified as involving the skin (cellulitis), incision, or deep 
tissue. Deep tissue infections will include, but not be limited to, infected seromas, infected 
hematomas, and endovascular infections. 
7. Abnormal wound healing: such as:  
• Inflammation (erythema, warmth, indur ation, or tenderness) . 
• Excessive scar tissue (i.e., keloid formation) . 
• Lack of direct union between opposing edges of the incision. 
6.2.2 ADVERSE EVENTS  
Monitoring of treatment emergent AEs is conducted throughout the study. All AEs, regardless of 
causal ity, are  collected through Week  4 (Visit 4). After Week  4 and for up to Month 12 (Visit 8), 
only AEs associated with the AVF extremity and AE s resulting in death are coll ected, regardless 
of causality.  
All AE s that are not resolved by Month 12 (Visit 8) or not resolved upon discontinuation of the 
patient’s participation in the study are to be followed until any of the following occurs:  
• The event resolves.  
• The patient’s condition stabi lizes or is fully characterized.  
• The event returns to baseline value (if a baseline value is available), or it is determined 
that the event is not attributable to the stu dy medication or study conduct.  
Definitions, documentation, and reporting of AE s are described in detail in Section  8. 
6.2.3 MEDICAL HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 
A medical history is obtained through review of the patient’s medical records and personal 
interview in order to as sess the patient’s eligibility.  
A physical examination is performed at Screening (Visit 1)  and Week  4 (Visit  4); clinically 
significant adverse changes from baseline are recorded as AE s. 
6.2.4 SPECIAL ASSAYS OR PROCEDURES  
A blood sample of 5 mL is drawn at Screening (Visit  1), Week  2 (Visit 3)  and Week  4 (Visit 4) 
for anti -vonapanitase  antibody detection. These samples will be processed according to the 
instructions provided in the Central Laboratory Manual.  
Patients who demonstrate anti -vonapanitase  antibodies at Week  4 (or at Week  2 without  a 
Week  4 result) are asked to provide an additional blood sample for testing at Month 6. Patients 
who continue to test positive at Month  6 (or at Week  4 without  a Month 6 result), are asked to 
provide an a dditional blood sample at Month 12. 
Proteon Therapeutics, Inc.  Page 24 of 46 
Edition 05: 09 May 2018  Clinical Protocol PRT -201-320 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Provisions for  the storage and future use of the samples will be described in the informed consent 
form  (ICF) . No genetic testing is performed with this archived blood sample . 
6.2.5 CLINICAL LABORATORY EVALUATION 
Blood samples do not have to be obtained following fasting. Blood samples will be drawn at 
Screening (Visit 1), and Week 2 (Vi sit 3); labeled, processed , and shipped overnight to the 
central laboratory for testing. Instructions for the collection , processing, and shipping of samples 
will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
Blood for serum pregnancy will be drawn in females of childbearing potential at Screening . 
Refer to Appendix A  for the Schedule of Assessments  and Appendix B  for information regarding 
the specific laboratory tests.  
Clinical laboratory values that are outside the normal limits are considered abnorm al. Abnormal 
clinical laboratory values will be noted a s clinically significant or non -clinically si gnificant by 
the Investigator. Non- clinically significant is defined as those abnormalities unlikely to indicate a 
significant medical condition or are cons istent with the patient’s underlying medical condition 
and do not warrant any further investigation or treatment. All new clinically significant 
abnormalities not present at baseline w ill be reported as AE s. 
6.2.6 DUPLEX DOPPLER ULTRA SOUND 
Duplex Doppler ultraso und examinations  at Week  4 (Visit 4) and Month 3 (Visit 5) will be sent 
to a blinded central reader . Instructions for the acquisition and transmission of ultrasound 
examinations will be provided in the  Ultrasound Guidelines . 
6.2.7 UNSCHEDULED ASSESSME NTS  
The Investigator may, at his/her discretion, arrange for a patient to have an unscheduled 
assessment(s). This may include  repeated screening assessments if a surgery date is resched uled 
out of the visit window, assessments to further evaluate a patient exp eriencing an AE  considered 
by the Investigator to be possibly related to the use of s tudy drug  or collect information about 
AVF patency and use for hemodialysis . The CRF  pages specific for unscheduled assessments 
must be completed at the  time of the unsche duled visit.

 PLACE BO 
The placebo is identical in appearance and composition to vonapanitase  but lacks the active 
ingredient. It is supplied by Proteon.  
 FORMULATION, PACKAGI NG, AND LABELING  
Vonapanitase  is supplied as a lyophilized powder in a single use 10 mL glass vial with a rubber 
stopper. Each vial contains 0.036 mg of protein. Proteon will also supply  5 mL vials of sterile 
water. Reconstitution with 3 mL sterile water yields a 0.012  mg/mL vonapanitase  solution 
containing 10 mM sodium phosphate, 55 mM NaCl, 3%  mannitol, 1%  trehalose, and 
0.01%  polysorbate  80. Two and a half milliliters (2.5  mL) is used in the application. Further 
detail is p rovided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
 PATIENT RANDOMIZATIO N AND BLINDING  
Both randomization and blinding techniques are used in this study to minimize bias. A computer 
generated randomization schema is centrally available via an IVRS or IWRS. The IVRS/IWRS is 
accessed by individuals who have been issued a username and password. Patient randomization 
is performed at the time of surgery. Patien ts will be randomized by site and stratified by 
hemodialysis status at the time of randomization  and balance will be maintained by blocking 
within site . 
 UNBLINDING  
In the case of a medical emergency where, in the Investigator’s judgment, the patient’s safety 
may be compromised without immediate knowledge of the exact treatment received, the 
Investigator can contact the Medical Monitor at Proteon Therapeutics to unblind a singl e patient

visit, or equivalent, and will be coordinated with the Investigational Pharmacy, where applicable. 
Plans for how the investigational drug  will be distributed including participation of the dru g 
repository and distribution center, frequency of product distribution, amount of product shipped, 
and plans for return of used and unused product will be provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
The expiry date for study drug is included on the product labeling . 
 DOSAGE, PREPARATION,  AND ADMINISTRATION OF INVESTIGATIONAL 
DRUG  
Investigational drug will be administered only to eligible patients under the supervision of the  
Investigator or identified sub- Investigator(s). Eligible patients will be randomiz ed in a 2:1 ratio 
to either vonapanitase  0.03 mg or placebo. The investigational drug  will be reconstituted with 
3 mL of sterile water and gently swirled to ensure the investigational drug is completely 
dissolved. The study drug solution should be clear and colorless .  Detailed investigational drug 
preparation instructions will be pr ovided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
Papaverine is often used during the surgical creation of an AVF.  Care should be taken to ensure 
that prior to study drug administration the study drug solution does not come into contact with 
papaverine or any supplies containing or exposed to papaverine.  Exposing  the study drug 
solution to papaverine before study drug administration may ca use the study drug solution to 
become cloudy.  If  the study drug solution ever appears cloudy, it should not be used for dosing.  
Discard any cloudy study drug solution and obtain a replacement.  It is acceptable for the study 
drug solution to come into contact with papa verine in the surgical site .   
The investigational drug  will be administered in a volume of 2.5 mL topically using a s terile 
syringe fitted with a 22  gauge angiocatheter. The surgeon will administer a series of drops of 
study drug  to the external surface o f the exposed inflow artery (1 dro p), anastomosis (1 drop) and 
the outflow vein (4 drops) e very 20 seconds for 10  minutes, f or a total of approximately 
180 drops. The objective is to keep the vessels w et with the solution for the 10 minutes of 
treatment. After 5  minutes of dosing the surge on shoul d check that approximately 1.25 mL of 
dosing solution has been administered. The number of drops should be adjusted accordingly 
based on this check (i.e., extra drop(s) every 20 seconds if less than  1.25 mL was used in the first 
5 minutes, or fewer drops if more than 1.25 mL was used). The entire dose should be delivered. 
Any dosing solution remaining in the syringe should be administered with the final application. 
If the drug pools around the AVF it does not need to be aspirated unless it is blood tinged . At the

CONFIDENTIAL  end of 10 minutes, the surgeon will irrigate the incision site with saline lavage continuously for 
1 minute to remove the investigatio nal drug. The surgeon will close  the incision per us ual 
clinical practice and wash  the incision and surrou nding skin with saline . 
All persons handling study drug  should avoid contact with  the investigational drug  solution. Any 
accidental exposure to the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes  should be washed with copious 
amounts of w ater or saline for at least 1  minute.  
 DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY/ RETENTION   
Accountability for the study drug at the trial site is the responsibility of the Investigator. The 
Investigator will ensure that the study drug is used only in accordance with this protocol. Where 
allowed, the Investi gator may choose to assign some of the drug accountability responsibilities to 
a pharmacist or other appropriate individual. Accountability records will include dates, 
quantities, patient identifiers , and the initials of the individual documenting the reco rd. The 
institution is free to use its drug accountability system, unless otherwise specified by Proteon. 
These records will adequately document that the patients were provided the doses specified in 
the protocol and should reconcile all study drug receive d from Proteon. Proteon or its Contract 
Research Organization ( CRO ) designee will review drug accountability records at the site on an 
ongoing basis during on- site monitoring visits.  
 DRUG RETURNS AND DES TRUCTION 
Used and unused vials of study drug will be stored until the study monitor conducts an on- site 
visit to perform a physical inventory and reconciliation of the drug accountability records. 
Proteon may allo w study drug to be destroyed on -site if the site has a documented method of 
destruction. Please refer to the Pharmacy Manual for study specific details regardi ng vial 
destruction and return.  
8. ADVERSE EVENTS  
 DEFINITION OF ADVERS E EVENT  
An adverse event  (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a 
drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational drug, whether or not considered related to the 
investigational drug. This includes any newly occurring event or a previous condition that has 
increased in severity or frequency since the administrati on of the investigational drug.  
Proteon Therapeutics, Inc.  Page 28 of 46 
Edition 05: 09 May 2018  Clinical Protocol PRT -201-320 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 RECORDING OF ADVERSE  EVENTS AND OBSERVAT ION PERIOD 
The Investigator should question the patient about AEs and intercurrent illnesses since his/her 
last visit and record the information in the patient’s medical record. The questi ons should be 
generalized such as, “How have you been feeling since your last visit?” The presence or absence 
of specific AEs should not be solicited from patients. The onset and end dates, severity, and 
relationship to study drug must be recorded for each AE. When possible, signs and symptoms 
indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event or 
diagnosis.  
AEs will be recorded between administration of the study drug and Week  4 (Visit 4). A fter 
Week  4 and for up to Month 12 (Visit 8), only AEs associated with the AVF extremity and AEs 
resulting in death will be collected. Medical events that occur between the signing of the 
informed consent and study drug administration will be considered part of the patient’s medical 
histor y and recorded accordingly. Patients who experience AEs will be monitored with relevant 
clinical assessments and laboratory tests, as determined by the Investigat or. Any action taken and 
follow -up results must be recorded in the patient’s medical record. F ollow -up laboratory results 
should be filed with the patient’s medical records.  
All AEs that are not resolved by the end of the study, or that were not resolved upon 
discontinuation of the patient’s participation in the study, are to be followed until one of the 
following occurs: the event resolves, the patient’s condition stabilizes or is fully characterized, or 
the event returns to baseline value (if a baseline value is available).  
 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  
8.3.1 REFERENCE SAFETY INF ORMATION  
The current version of the vonapanitase  Investigator’s Brochure should be referenced for all 
safety information pertaining to the study. Proteon will provide a current version of the 
Invest igator’s Brochure to all study I nvestigators.  
8.3.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITION  
A serious adverse event  (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use 
of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, that results in one or more of the 
following outcomes:  
1. Death.  
2. A life -threatening A E. Life -threatening means that the patient was at immediate risk of 
death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
Proteon Therapeutics, Inc.  Page 29 of 46 
Edition 05: 09 May 2018  Clinical Protocol PRT -201-320 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  3. In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. Hospitalization 
admissions and/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but 
planned prior to study entry are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before 
the patient was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected 
manner during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned).  
4. A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to  conduct 
normal life functions.  
5. A con genital anomaly/birth defect.  
6. Important medical events that m ay not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical inte rvention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in- patient  hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
8.3.3 REPORTING PROCEDURES  
All initial and follow -up SAE reports must be reported on the SAE form and a facsimile sent to 
the appropriate Safety Desk within 24 hours of the site being made aw are of it. See contact 
information below:  
Premier Safety Desk  
SAE Fax No.: 1- 215-972-8765 
Email: globalpv- us@premier -research.com   
 
Medical Monitor: Marco Wong, M.D, PhD  
Telephone No.: 1- 816-536-3770 
Proteon Therapeutics, Inc.  
Email: MWong@ProteonTx.com  
A report of an SAE by telephone must always be confirmed by a written, more detailed report 
within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the event. The Investigator should provide the 
following written documentation at the time of notification, if available:  
• SAE Reporting Form  
• Concomitant medication pages  
• Relevant diagnostic reports  
• Relevant laboratory reports  
• Admission notes  
Proteon Therapeutics, Inc.  Page 30 of 46 
Edition 05: 09 May 2018  Clinical Protocol PRT -201-320 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  • Hospital discharge summary  
Proteon will assume responsibility for appropriat e reporting of AEs to regulatory authorities. 
Proteon will also report all SAEs that are unexpected and associated with the use of the study 
drug to investigational sites.  
Follow -up data concerning SAEs (e.g., diagnostic test reports, physician's summaries , etc.) must 
be submitted to Proteon or designee as they become available, preferably electronically. It is the 
responsibility of the Investigator to promptly notify the IRB or IEC  of all SAEs, as well as any 
unanticipated problems that involve significant  risk to patients, as required by their IRB /IEC . A 
copy of the IRB /IEC  notification should be placed in the site’s regulatory binder. 
The Principal Investigator will review each SAE and further evaluate the relationship of the AE 
to study drug and to the p atient’s underlying disease. Based on the Investigator’s assessment of 
the AE, a decision will be made concerning the need for further action. The primary 
consideration governing further action is whether new findings affect the safety of other patients 
participating in the clinical study. If the discovery of a new AE related to the study drug raises 
concern over the safety of its continued administration to patients, Proteon will take immediate 
steps to notify the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and all  Investigators participating in 
vonapanitase  clinical studies.  
8.3.4 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT COLLECTION TIMEFRA ME 
All SAEs, regardless of relationship to the investigational product, will be reported between 
study drug administration and Week 4 (Visit 4). After Week  4 only AEs and SAEs associated 
with the AVF extremity, and those resulting in death will be collected . 
8.3.5 PREGNANCY  
Pregnancy by definition is not considered to be a SAE unless the criteria in Section 8.3 are met. 
However, pregnancy in patients that have received the study drug must be followed to assess 
congenital anomalies. For purposes of consistency, Proteon or its designated CRO 
representatives  will record pregnancies in the SAE System; however , the event will then be 
downgraded if the outcome does not meet the SAE criteria. Pregnancy Questionnaires and 
Pregnancy Outcome forms are provided to each clinical study site in the Study Manual and 
should be forwarded to Proteon or designee.  
 SEVERITY  
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator must determine the severity of the event using the 
following definitions:  
Mild:  The event does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient’s normal functioning 
level. It may be an annoyance but does not cause any limitation in usual activity.  
Proteon Therapeutics, Inc.  Page 31 of 46 
Edition 05: 09 May 2018  Clinical Protocol PRT -201-320 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Moderate:  The event produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to health. It 
is uncomfortable or an embarrassment and may cause some limitation in usual activity.  
Severe: The event produces significant impairment or incapacitation and is a definite hazard to 
the patient’s health.  
Life-threatening: The event places the patient, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk 
of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction that had it occurred in 
a more severe form, might have caused death.  
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, severe, or life -threatening myocardial infarction). Even though the event itself may be 
of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe headache), this is not the same as 
“serious,” whi ch is based on patient/event outcome or action cri teria as described above and is  
usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning. A severe AE is 
not necessarily serious. For example, persistent nausea of several hours duration may be 
considered severe nausea but not meet the definition of a SAE. On the other hand, a stroke 
resulting in only a minor degree of persistent disability may be considered mild, but would be 
defined as a SAE based on the above noted criteria. Se riousness (not severity) serves as a guide 
for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
 CAUSALITY 
Association of AEs and SAEs to the study drug will be made using the following definitions:  
Unrelated: An AE that  is not related to the use of the study drug.  
Unlikely: An AE that  is unlikely to be due to the use of the study drug. An alternative 
explanation, e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), is plausible. A relationship to the 
study drug is improbable but not impossible.  
Possible: An AE that  conceivably could be due to the use of the study drug. An alternative 
explanation, e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), is not conclusive. The 
relationship of the event in time follows a plausible t emporal sequence from administration of 
the study drug so that a causal relationship cannot be excluded, but could have been produced by 
the patient’s clinical condition or other therapy.  
Probable: An AE  that might be due to the use of the study drug. An a lternative explanation is 
less likely, e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is 
suggestive and follows a reasonable temporal association with study drug administration. The 
reaction cannot be reasonably explained by th e known characteristics of the patient’s clinical 
state or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
Related: An AE  that is almost certainly  related to the use of the study drug. The AE cannot be 
reasonably explained by an alternative explanation , e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant 
disease(s).

Edition 05: 09 May 2018  Clinical Protocol PRT -201-320 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 DEATHS AND LIFE -THREATENING EVENTS  
An event leading to death from any cause or any life- threatening event must always be reported 
as an SAE within 24 hours of the clinical site learning of the event, reg ardless of whether or not 
related to the study drug (see Section  8.3).  
 UNEXPECTED ADVERSE E VENT  
An AE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed  in the Investigator 's Brochure or is not listed 
at the specificity or severity that has been observed. “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also 
refers to AEs that are mentioned in the Investigator 's Brochure as occurring with a class of drugs 
or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the parti cular drug under investigation. 
 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE 
An independent DMC  will review accumulated blinded safety data after 150  patients have  been 
treated and complete Week  4 (Visit 4) . The DMC will review adverse event and clinically 
significant laboratory data in a blinded fashion and  make a determination whether the data raise 
any vonapanitase  related safety concern. T he DMC must make a recommendation to continue , 
modify , or stop the study. If a potential safety issue is identified during the course of the study , 
these will be brought to the attention of the Committee Chair and additi onal meetings may be 
convened.  
A charter for th e DMC will be created that will define the membership, schedule of meetings, 
data required for each safety review, and requirements for documenting meeting discussions and 
outcome. 
9. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
A formal statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed that  includes a detailed description of 
all planned analyses , pre-specified exploratory analyses, and any data handling conventions. Any 
deviations from the statistical methods described in the protocol and/or SAP will be documented 
in the clinical study report. 
In general, continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics including the 
number of observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum values. 
Categorical values will be summarized using number of observat ions and percentages. Data 
presentations will include columns for placebo and vonapanitase  0.03 mg.  
All statistical tes ts will be performed at the two -sided, 5%  significance level, unless otherwise 
specified. All statistical testing will compare placebo versus  vonapanitase  unless otherwise 
specified.  
Proteon Therapeutics, Inc.  Page 33 of 46 
Edition 05: 09 May 2018  Clinical Protocol PRT -201-320 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  The primary analysis will be performed once all patients have completed the Month 12 visit 
(Visit 8). The analysis of the registry data will be performed separately.  
All data will be included in data listings.  
 SAMPLE SIZE  
Final data from the PRT -201-310 study has been used to estimate the sample size and power for 
the co -primary endpoints  of secondary patency and AVF use for hemodialysis .  Six  hundred 
(600) patients will be stratified based on hemodialysis status at study entry and randomly 
allocated by site in a 2:1 ratio to either vonapanitase  0.03 mg or placebo. When the total sample 
size is approximately 600 ( 400 vonapanitase  and 200 placebo), a two -sided Fleming -Harrington 
weighted log- rank test with ρ = 0 and γ= 0.35 for equality of survival curves with a 0.05 
significance level will have approximately 88% power to detect a 13% difference (61 vs. 74%) in 
the proportion of placebo compared to vonapani tase 0.03 mg  treated patients with secondary 
patency at 12 months . [16]  A piecewise exponential model with no treatment benefit during the 
first three months (i.e., survival at 3 months for both treatment groups is 88.4%) is assumed. 
A 15% drop out rate has been assumed in the calculations. The study will enroll over 24 months 
and each patient will be followed for a maximum of 12 months.   
Assuming 25% of patients will have  insufficient data to determine AVF use for hemodialysis a  
sample size of 450 will have 9 8% power to detect a 20% difference in the percentage of AVF use  
in placebo compared to vonapanitase  0.03 mg  (44 vs. 64%  AVF use ), using a two sided chi -
square test with an 0.05 significance level . 
 ANALYSIS SETS  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS), based on Intention to Treat (ITT) methodology, will be defined as 
all randomized patients  who have AVF surgery . Patients will be analyzed according to the 
randomized treatment assignment. Analyses of all efficacy endpoints will be performed using the 
FAS as the pri mary analysis set . Any patients who are randomized but not treated and have AVF 
surgery will only contribute data from Visits 1 and 2.   
An Evaluable Analysis Set (EAS) will be defined as all randomized patients who received any 
amount of study drug and who do not have any protocol violations/deviations , or a technical 
failure of the surgery that could adversely affect the evaluation of the primary analysis. These 
patients will be identified prior to unblinding and the reason for any potential exclusion will  be 
documented. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received. Analyses of 
the co -primary endpoints w ill be performed using the EAS  as a sensitivity analysis . 
The Safety Analysis Set will be defined as all randomized patients who received any amount of 
study drug. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received.

 STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY  
9.3.1 DEMOGRAPHICS AND BAS ELINE CHARACTERISTICS  
Demographic data, medical history, and other baseline characteristics will be summarized by 
treatment received and included in the data listings. Statistical comparisons will be performed  to 
assess baseline imbalances between treatment groups.  
9.3.2 SAFETY ANALYSES  
Safety evaluations are based on AEs, physical examination, duplex Doppler ultra sound, clinical 
laboratory evaluations, and immunogenicity testing results. 
9.3.2.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse event s will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
AE dictionary. Treatment emergent AEs, defined as AEs that occur after a dministration  of the 
study drug, will be tabulated by body system, preferred term, and dose. Events will also be 
summarized by relationship to the study drug and severity (mild, moderate, severe, or life 
threatening). SAEs and events leading to study discontinuation will be summarized by body 
system, preferred term, and treatment group.  
All AEs will be presented in the data listings.  
9.3.2.2 Physical Examinations  
Required components of the physical exam will be specified in the source worksheets . Clinically 
significant adverse changes from baseline will be reported as AEs. In addition to the physical 
examination at S creening (Visit 1) and Week  4 (Visit  4), an AVF and upper extremity 
examination will be performed immediately following surgery  and at all follow -up vis its. Details 
on the AVF and upper extremity examination may be found in Section 6.2.1. AVF procedure 
types and all angioplasty locations (angioplasty includes balloon angioplasty/fistulogram and 
surgical patch angioplasty) will be summarized by the total frequency of each as w ell as the 
number and percentage of patients receiving them in each treatment group. The clinical reasons 
the patients were referred for the first procedure to restore or maintain patency will be 
summarized and presented by decreasing order of frequency for the vonapanitase  0.03 mg group.  
9.3.2.3 Duplex Doppler Ultrasound  
The variables of lumen diameter and blood flow  obtained through duplex Doppler ultrasound at 
Week  4 (Visit 4) and Month 3 (Visit 5) will be summarized and presented in the data listings and 
in tab ular summaries by treatment group. The average value of multiple measurements w ill be 
used for summarization. Clinically significant adverse findings will be recorded as AE s.

Clinical laboratory results will be summarized by  treatment group at  Screening (Visit 1) and 
Week  2 (Visit 3). The change from baseline in laboratory r esults will also be presented. All 
clinically significant adverse laboratory abnormalities will be reported as AEs and included in 
the summary of AEs. Out  of range laboratory results will be listed.  
All laboratory results will be presented in the data listings.  
9.3.2.5 Anti -vonapanitase  Antibody Detection  
Results of anti -vonapanitase  antibodies will be presented in the data listings.  
9.3.3 EFFICACY ANALYSES  
9.3.3.1 Primary Endpoint s 
The co -primary efficacy endpoints are secondary patency  and AVF use for hemodialysis . 
Secondary patency is defined as the time from AVF creation until AVF abandonment.  A patient 
who does not have an abandoned AVF at Month 12 (Visit 8) or end of study will be censored at 
the last visit date the AVF was known not to be abandoned.  
Secondary patency time is estimated by the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles calculated by 
using the Kaplan- Meier life test methods to estimate the survival functions. A Fleming -
Harrington weighted log -rank test  with ρ = 0 and γ= 0.35 will be used to test the equality of the 
survival curves between vonapanitase  and placebo. A 95%  confidence interval for the median 
will be calculated.  A graph of the survival probabi lity over time will be presented. As a 
sensitivity analysis, the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval, using a Cox proportional -
hazards model  will also be calculated.  The analysis of secondary patency will be performed in 
the FAS. Analysis of secondary  patency  will also  be performed in the EAS as a sensitivity 
analysis . As appropriate based on the proportional hazards assessment, restricted means or 
proportional hazards modeling may be employed to identify and adjust for any covariates 
potentially assoc iated with secondary patency. The data from the models will be for descriptive 
purposes only . The Fleming -Harrington weighted log rank test in the FAS will be considered the 
primary analysis for secondary patency . 
AVF use for hemodialysis is defined as the  ability of the study AVF to be  successfully 
cannulated and used for  hemodialysis for a minimum of 90 days or at least 30 days prior to a 
patient’s last visit, if hemodialysis had not been initiated at least 90 days prior to a patient’s last 
visit.  If AVF  use is not defined as above, non- use of the AVF for hemodialysis is defined as an 
abandoned fistula prior to use; or if hemodialysis is recorded on 2 consecutive visits  and there is 
no cannulation date or duration of use is less than 90 days.  The patient s who are not categorized 
as having use or non- use of the AVF have insufficient data to determine AVF use for 
hemodialysis and will be categorized as having indeterminate use. The number and percentage of

CONFIDENTIAL  patients with AVF use or non- use for hemodialysis w ill be summarized by treatment group in the 
group of FAS  patients who are not considered indeterminate .  Vonapanitase vs. placebo will be 
tested using a Chi -square test. Analysis of AVF use  will also  be performed in the EAS as a 
sensitivity analysis.     
9.3.3.2 Additional Efficacy  Endpoint s 
Additional efficacy endpoints are unassisted AVF use for hemodialysis, primary unassisted 
patency, AVF maturation by ultrasound criteria, unassisted AVF maturation by ultrasound 
criteria, the rate of procedures performed to  the AVF , and the rate of procedures to restore or 
maintain AVF patency.  
9.3.3.2.1 Unassisted AVF Use for Hemodialysis  
Unassisted AVF use for hemodialysis  is defined as AVF use without prior procedures to restore 
or maintain patency.  
The number and percentage of patie nts with unassisted AVF use for hemodialysis will be 
summarized by treatment group. Vonapanitase  versus placebo will be tested using a chi -square 
test.  The analysis of unassisted AVF use will be perfo rmed in the FAS.  
9.3.3.2.2 Primary  Unassisted Patency  
AVF primary  unassisted patency is defined as the time from AVF creation until the first 
occurrence of either access thrombosis or procedure to restore or maintain AVF patency. A  
patient who has a patent AVF at Month 12 or end of study will be censored at the last visit date 
where the AVF was known to be patent.  
Primary unassisted patency time is estimated by the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles 
calculated by using the K aplan -Meier life test methods to estimate the survival functions. A 
log-rank test will be used to test the equality of the survival curves between vonapanitase  and 
placebo. A 95%  confidence interval for the median will be calculated. A graph of the surviva l 
probability over time will be presented. A hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval, calculated 
using a Cox proportional -hazards model including treatment as the covariate will assess the 
magnitude of the treatment effect.  Proportional hazards modeling may be employed to identify 
and adjust for any covariates potentially associated with primary unassisted patency. The data 
from the proportional hazards models will be for descriptive purposes only. The analysis of 
primary unassisted  patency will be perfor med in the FAS . Analysis of primary unassisted 
patency will also be performed on the EAS as a sensitivity analysis .   
9.3.3.2.3 AVF Maturation  
AVF maturation by ultrasound criteria is defined by two definitions: 
Proteon Therapeutics, Inc.  Page 37 of 46 
Edition 05: 09 May 2018  Clinical Protocol PRT -201-320 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  1. As average cephalic vein luminal diameter ≥  6 mm and outflow vein volume blood flow 
≥ 600 mL/min by ultrasound. [ 2] 
2. As average cephalic vein luminal diameter ≥  4 mm and outflow vein volume blood flow 
≥ 500 mL/min by ultrasound. [ 1] 
The number and percentage of patients with AVF maturation will be summarized by treatment 
group at Week  4 (Visit 4) and Month 3 (Visit 5) . Vonapanitase  versus  placebo will be tested 
using a chi -square test. Definition  2 at the Month 3 visit is considered primary for analysis. 
Unassisted AVF maturation is defined as AVF maturation by ultrasound criteria without prior 
primary unassisted patency loss. The number and percentage of patients with unassisted AVF 
maturation will be analyzed similarly.  AVF ma turatio n and unassisted AVF maturation by 
ultrasound criteria will be performed in the FAS .  This analysis will also be performed on the 
EAS as a sensitivity analysis .   
9.3.3.2.4 Procedure Rate  
The procedure rate is defined as the total number of procedure days divided by  time on study  per 
person year of follow up. A Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used t o compare the treatment 
groups. The rate of procedure days overall and the rate of procedure days to r estore or maintain 
AVF patency will be performed in the FAS.  
9.3.3.3 Multiplic ity Adjustments  
Multiplicity , with respect to the co -primary endpoints , will be managed with the Hochberg 
procedure. If both endpoints have a p- value ≤ 0.05 both will be considered statistically 
significant. If one endpoint has a p- value  > 0.05 the other e ndpoint will be considered 
statistically significant only if its p -value is ≤  0.025. If both p- values are >  0.05 neither will be 
considered statistically significant.   
Multiplicity adjustments for other endpoints will be described fully in the SAP.  
9.3.4 CLINICAL ENDPOINT REVIEW  
Prior to database lock, a clinical  expert in the field of hemodialysis vascular access will review 
all study patients’ CRFs and procedure reports to confirm that the patients are appropriately 
defined with regard to the primary and secondary patency efficacy endpoints  by reviewing 
applicable CRFs and procedure reports to e nsure that appropriate documentation of clinical 
dysfunction has been recorded.  A charter for this process will be created that will define the 
review process  and the  requirements for documentation of review.

CONFIDENTIAL  10.  ADMINISTRATIVE REQUI REMENTS  
 GOOD CLINICAL PRACTI CE 
The study will be conducted in accordance with the current Good Clinical Practice/ International 
Conference on Harmonization ( GCP/ICH ) Guidelines and relev ant regulatory requirement(s). 
Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety , and well -being of 
study patients are being protected consistent with the principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and that the clinical study data are credible. The Investigator will be 
thoroughly familiar with the appropriate use of the study drug as described in the protocol and 
Investigator 's Brochure. Essential clinical documents will be maintained to demonstrate the 
validity of the study and the integrity of the data collected. A Trial Master File (TMF) will be 
established at the beginning of the study, maintained for the duration of the study , and retained 
according to appropriate regulations . 
 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIO NS 
The study will be conducted in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki. The IRB /IEC will review all appropriate study documentation in order 
to safeguard the rights, safety , and well -being of the patients. The  study will only be conducted 
at sites where IRB /IEC  approval has been obtained. The protocol, Investigator 's Brochure, 
informed consent, advertisements (if applicable), written information given to the patients 
(including patient information material), sa fety updates, annual progress reports, and any 
revisions to these documents will be provided to the IRB /IEC  by the Investigator.  
 PATIENT INFORMED CONSENT AND INFORMATION 
Prior to entry in the study, the Investigator must explain to potential study patients  or their 
legally acceptable representative, the study and the implications of participation. Patients will be 
told that their participation is voluntary and they may withdraw consent to participate at any 
time. Patients will be told that their records may  be accessed by competent authorities and 
authorized Proteon personnel or its representatives without violating the confidentiality of the 
patient, to the extent permitted by the applicable law(s) and/or regulations. In addition to signing  
the ICF , the patient or legally acceptable representative will be required to  authoriz e access to the 
patient’s protected health information by signing a separate authorization meeting the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Each patient 
(or their legally authorized representative) must sign  and date  the ICF (and other locally 
required documents) after the nature of the study has been fully explained but prior to 
performing any study -related activities. The patient (or th eir legally acceptable representative) 
will be given sufficient time to read the ICF and to ask questions. After having obtained consent, 
a copy of the informed consent document must be given to the patient. In case the patient is 
unable to read, an impart ial witness must attest to the informed consent. Patients who are unable

CONFIDENTIAL  to comprehend the information provided can only be enrolled after consent of a leg ally 
acceptable representative.  
The consent form that is used must be approved by both the reviewing IRB/IEC  and by Proteon.  
 PATIENT CONFIDENTIAL ITY 
The collection and processing of data from patients enrolled in this study will be limited to those 
data that are necessary to investigate the safety, quality , and utility of the investigational drug(s) 
used in this study  and to conduct the other investigations described in this protocol, including the 
pharmacoeconomic an alysis described in Section  5.10. These data will be processed with 
adequate precautions to ensure confidentiality.  
In order to maintain patient privacy, CRFs, study drug accountability records, study reports , and 
communications will generally identify the patient by initials and the ass igned patient number. 
The ICF will inform  patients of any departures from this approach, such as the need to identify 
patients by social security number or Health Insurance Claim/Beneficiary Identification Code for 
purpos es of the pharmacoeconomic analysis  described in Section  5.10. The Investigator will 
grant monitor(s) and auditor(s) from Proteon, its CRO designee or business partners , and 
regulator y authority(ies) access to the patient’s original medical records for verification of data 
gathered on the CRFs and to audit the data collection process. The patient’s confidentiality will 
be maintained and will not be made publicly available except to the  extent permitted by 
applicable laws and regulations. 
 PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE  
The Investigator will conduct the study in compliance with the protocol provided by Proteon, 
and given approval by the IRB /IEC  and the appropriate regulatory authority(ies). Modifica tions 
to the protocol should not be made without the approval of Proteon. Changes to the protocol will 
require written IRB /IEC  approval prior to implementation, except when the modification is 
needed to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to patients. The IRB /IEC  may provide, if applicable 
regulatory authority(ies) permit, expedited review and approval for minor change(s) in ongoing 
studies that have the approval of the IRB /IEC . Proteon will submit all protocol modifications to 
the regulatory authority(ies) in accordance with the governing regulations.  
When immediate deviation from the protocol is required to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to 
patients, the Investigator will contact Proteon, if circumstances permit, to discuss the planned 
course of action. Any  departures from the protocol must be fully documented in the patient’s 
medical records and CRF.  
 STUDY MONITORING AND ON -SITE AUDITS  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed by Proteon or its CRO designee will be followed, 
in order to comply with GCP g uidelines. Routine monitoring visits will be made to assure 
Proteon Therapeutics, Inc.  Page 40 of 46 
Edition 05: 09 May 2018  Clinical Protocol PRT -201-320 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  compliance with the study protocol, to review and compare the patient’s CRF or other data 
collection vehicle with source documents, to ensure adequate records of clinical supplies are 
maintained , and to assess the continued suitability of the investigational site. The Investigator 
agrees to allow the site monitors, and other authorized personnel or designees, access to the 
patient’s medical records, regulatory binder, study binder, CRFs , and source  documents as 
needed to assure the conduct of the study is within compliance.  
Upon completion of the study the site monitor will make a final assessment of the conduct of the 
study and inventory all clinical supplies to be returned to Proteon or designee. Unused or used 
vials of study drug will be stored until the study monitor is able to perform a physical inventory 
and reconciliation with the drug accountability records. At the completion of this study, all 
unused or used vials must be returned to Proteon, or designee, or if authorized, disposed of at the 
study site and documented. 
Regulatory authorities, the IRB  or IEC  and/or Proteon’s quality assurance group, its CRO 
designee , or business partners may request access to all source documents, CRFs, and oth er 
study documentation for on- site audit or inspection. Direct access to these documents must be 
guaranteed by the Investigator, who must provide support at all times for these activities.  
 CASE REPORT FORM COM PLETION  
Electronic case report forms (eCRFs) wi ll be utilized for this study. It is the Investigator’s 
responsibility to ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility , and timeliness of the data reported 
in the patient’s eCRF. Source documentation supporting the CRF data should indicate the 
patient’s p articipation in the study and should document the dates and details of study 
procedures, AEs , and patient status. No data should be directly recorded into the eCRF without 
supporting source documentation. 
The Investigator, or designated representative as n oted in the site delegation log, should 
complete the eCRF as soon as possible after information is collected, preferably on the same day 
that a study patient is seen for an examination, treatment, or any other study procedure. Any 
outstanding entries must be completed immediately after the final examination. An explanation 
should be given for all missing data.  
 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  
This clinical study will be monitored according to current Proteon or designated CRO Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOP s), GCP /ICH Guidelines , and all applicable regulatory requirements. 
Steps to be taken to assure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified 
Investigators and appropriate study sites, review of protocol procedures and the administration of 
informed consent with the Investigator and associated site personnel prior to study start, periodic 
monitoring visits by Proteon personnel or its designated CRO representatives , and clinical site 
audits . During the study, the Investigator shall permit Proteon or its representatives to verify the 
Proteon Therapeutics, Inc.  Page 41 of 46 
Edition 05: 09 May 2018  Clinical Protocol PRT -201-320 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  progress of the study on site as frequently as necessary. Qualified personnel will review CRF 
data or other appropriate data collection vehicles for accuracy and completeness remotely 
utilizing the electronic da ta capture ( EDC ) system and against source documents during on- site 
monitoring visits. Data discrepancies will be resolved with the Investigator or designees, as 
appropriate. The Investigator shall make the CRF, other data collection vehicles and source 
documents available, provide missing or corrected data, and sign the data collection tools. Data 
management and other qualified personnel will review CRF data for completeness, logical 
consistency , and safety; automated validation programs are used to help i dentify missing  data, 
protocol violations, out -of-range data, and other data inconsistencies. Personal information will 
be treated as strictly confidential and will not be publicly available. The CRF must be amended 
after inconsistencies have been resolved . 
An independent Quality Assurance (QA) department, Proteon business partner designees , and/or 
regulatory authorities may review this study. This implies that auditors/inspectors will have the 
right to inspect the investigational site(s) at any time during  and/or after completion of the study 
and will have access to source documents, including the patient's medical file(s). By participating 
in this study, Investigators agree to this requirement. Measures will be undertaken to protect 
patient data handed ove r by the Investigator to Proteon and to inspectors against disclosure to 
unauthorized third parties and patient confidentiality will be maintained at all times.  
 STUDY COMPLETION OR PREMATURE CLOSURE  
The Investigator will complete the study and submit the f inal e CRF s in satisfactory compliance 
with the protocol within approximately 2 weeks of study completion.  
Proteon reserves the right to close the investigational site or terminate the study at any time. 
Reasons for the closure of an investigational site or  termination of a study by Proteon may 
include:  
1. Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to patients.  
2. Failure to enter patients at an acceptable rate.  
3. Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.  
4. Insufficiently complete and/or eva luable data.  
5. Plans to modify, suspend , or discontinue the development of the study drug. 
Should the study be closed prematurely, all study materials must be returned to Proteon. 
 RECORD RETENTION 
A record of the eCRFs and all source documents (e.g., ICFs , laboratory reports, progress notes, 
medical history, physical and diagnostic findings, diagnoses and dates of therapy prior to and 
during this study, drug dispensing/disposition records) that support the data collected for each

CONFIDENTIAL  patient must be retained in t he files of the responsi ble Investigator for at least 2  years after the 
last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or at least 2  years have elapsed since the 
formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational drug. These documents 
should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by applicable regulatory 
requirements. The Investigator should take measures to prevent accidental  or premature 
destruction of these records. Under no circumst ances shall the Investigator re- locate or dispose of 
any study documents before having obtained Proteon written approval. If the Investigator 
withdraws from the responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a 
person willing to accept the responsibility. Proteon must be notified in writing if a custodial 
change occurs. If it becomes necessary for Proteon or a regulatory authority to review any 
documentation relatin g to this study, the Investigator must permit, with the approval of the 
patient, access to such records. Any difficulty in storing original records must be discussed with 
the study monitor prior to the initiation of the study.  
11.  USE OF INFORMATION AND PUBLI CATION 
All information regarding vonapanitase  supplied by Proteon to the Investigator or generated by 
the Investigator in accordance with the conduct of the study is privileged and confidential 
information of Proteon. The Investigator agrees to use this information to accomplish the study 
and will not use it for other purposes without written consent from Proteon. It is understood that 
there is an obligation to provide Proteon with complete data obtained during the study. The 
information obtained from the c linical study will be used by Proteon in connection with the 
development of vonapanitase  and may be disclosed by Proteon to regulatory authority(ies), other 
Investigators, corporate partne rs, or consultants as required.  
The Investigator’s right and obligations with respect to publishing or otherwise presenting 
information regarding the study are detailed in the Publication provisions of the Clinical Study

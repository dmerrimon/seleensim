endpoints using the CFZ-based regimen vs. historic standard of care.  
 Safety plan  
Patients will be enrolled according to the inclusion and exclus ion criteria.  Patients will provide 
informed consent to participate in this clinical trial.  In the informed consent process, patients will 
be educated about the purpose for carfilzomib and the potential  adverse.   
 A study data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be established .  The DSMB will meet once 
yearly to review study progress, to ensure appropriate enrollme nt milestones are being met, and 
to review the adverse event reporting.  The DSMB will meet on a n ad-hoc basis to review any 
SAEs.    The DSMB may terminate the study only after at least 15 patient s have been enrolled.  The DSMB 
may only terminate the study for safety reasons in which the pe rceived risks of continuing to 
provide carfilzomib to upcoming patients who may be enrolled outweighs the potential benefit to the patient and the allograft.  The DSMB may not terminate the study for any reason related to 
carfilzomib efficacy.

Carfilzomib dosing schedule: Car filzomib will be administered o n the multiple myeloma schedule 
consisting of 20 mg/m2 on days 1 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 (one cycle) to constitute one therapeutic 
cycle.  On PLEX/IVIG days, carf ilzomib will be given in between PLEX and IVIG to avoid 
inadvertent blockade of the Fcγ receptor.  Premedications for carfilzomib administration will be 
given as follows:  acetaminophen 650 mg PO, diphenhydramine 25 mg PO, ondansetron 4 mg 
PO, prednisone 40 mg PO or methylprednisolone 40 mg IV, all at least 30 minutes prior to and 
not more than 6 hours before carfilzomib, unless otherwise dire cted on the part of one of the 
investigators if believed to be in the best interests of patien t care.  Preinfusion hydration with a 
one-time bolus of 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride will be given at least 30 minutes prior to and not more than 6 hours before carfilzomib to minimize the nephrotoxi c AE.   Postinfusion hydration 
with a one-time bolus of 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride may be giv en immediately after carfilzomib 
to minimize the nephrotoxic AE.  Concomitant therapy and clinical practice  Conventional therapy for AMR:  Therapeutic plasma exchange (PLE X) 1.5 plasma volumes 
replaced with 5% albumin or fresh frozen plasma for 8 sessions every-other day.  Total 
intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) 100 mg/kg IV after each PLEX with the exception of the 
final PLEX where IVIG 500 mg/k g will be given. On day 16, if th e IgG level is below 700 mg/dL, 
an additional dose of IVIG 500 mg/kg will be administered.  If the IgG result is found to be 
700ml/dL or higher, the IVIG 500mg/kg dose will not be administered.  Premedications will be 
given for IVIG as follows: acetaminophen 650 mg PO and diphenhydramine 25 mg PO both at 
least 30 minutes prior to and not more than 6 hours before IVIG , unless otherwise directed on 
the part of one of the investigators if believed to be in the best interests of patient care.  On days where IVIG and CFZ are given together, only one set of premedic ations will be administered. 
Conventional therapy requires an inpatient hospital stay.  Patients will receive a tunneled PLEX catheter and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) inse rted by interventional radiology in 
the routine clinical care of these patients prior to receiving any conventional or carfilzomib 
therapy.  
Women of childbearing potential must either agree to abstain fr om sexual intercourse or use an 
effective birth control method during treatment and for an addi tional 30 days after the last dose of 
carfilzomib.  Men who are sexua lly active with women of childbearing potential must either agree 
to abstain from sexual intercourse or use a condom with spermic ide during treatment and for an 
additional 30 days after the last dose of carfilzomib, and the female partner should consider using 
an effective method of birth control.   
 
Statistical methods  
Data will only be analyzed in aggregate at study conclusion for the final enrolled patient on the 
efficacy and safety outcomes.    Descriptive statistics will be used to describe baseline and st udy characteristics of patients.  
Univariate parametric and nonparametric assessments, where appr opriate, will be used to assess 
change from baseline in the efficacy and safety outcomes.  Kaplan-Meier method will be used to 
describe freedom from endpoints and mortality in the patients t reated with carfilzomib.  Kaplan-
Meier method will be used to visually represent the time to eve nts and overall event rate in the 
patients in this pilot, not to compare events to any other group.

2 BACKGROUND 
 
2.1 Background and significance   The lack of improvement in long-term allograft survival, despite improved short-term outcomes, remains the most pressing challenge in the lung transplantation  field.  Lung transplant recipients 
fare poorly relative to other solid organs with 30% incidence o f chronic rejection at 2.5 years, 75% 
at 10 years, and only 55% of recipients surviving five years, primarily due to bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS).
1,2 This problem is compounded by major gaps in our understanding of the 
immune mechanisms underlying chronic rejection.  Donor specific antibodies have a reported incidence of 10-40% in lung transplantation, and DSA 
both precedes and is associated with an increased risk of BOS.
3-6 Further, pre-transplant 
sensitization in lung transplant recipients was found to correl ate with worse survival.7 In addition 
to BOS, other studies have shown that DSA is associated with se vere or recurrent acute cellular 
rejection (ACR) and lymphocytic bronchiolitis (LB), two forms of cellular rejection that are major 
risk factors for BOS.8,9  Moreover, detection of DSA with clinical antibody mediated re jection 
(AMR) in lung transplant recipients is difficult to treat and i s associated with higher morbidity 
compared to ACR.20 Several studies have shown an association be tween the development of 
anti-HLA Abs and/or DSA, BOS, and decreased survival.4,5,8-10  One such paper shows that anti-
HLA antibodies are associated with ACR and lymphocytic bronchio litis, two forms of cellular 
rejection that are major risk factors for BOS.8  We further investigated the relationship between 
DSA and BOS in 445 LT recipients at the University of Pittsburg h, over a 7-year period (2003-
2010). As shown in figure 1, DSA was associated with significan tly reduced freedom from BOS 
and decreased survival in LT recipients followed for 3.4 ±1.6 y rs. Furthermore, we found that the 
risk of BOS was significantly increased in the DSA+ group compa red to the non-DSA group using 
a Cox proportional hazards model (HR 6.32; 95% CI 4.34-9.18; p<0.001). 
 
 
 
 
    Figure 1: Freedom from BOS and Mortality in DSA vs. no  
DSA in lung transplantation recipients from UPMC.  
 
 
Moreover, the presence of high-grade BOS (BOS stage 2 or 3) was  significantly increased in the 
DSA+ versus the no-DSA group. Together, these data indicate tha t development of DSA is 
significantly associated with accelerated, high-grade BOS in lu ng transplantation recipients, along 
with diminished patient survival. Thus, DSA and AMR are emerging as a formidable challenge in 
lung transplantation.

  p. 12 of 48  Contrary to lung transplantation, the evidence and agreement supporting the AMR are robust in 
renal transplantation.  That said, the majority of the principles learned in renal transplantation are 
applicable to the lung.  One such lesson is the impact of funct ional phenotype of DSA, ergo 
whether the DSA is able to fix complement at peripheral blood c oncentrations in vitro.  A novel 
solid phase Luminex single antigen bead (SAB) assay was develop ed which allows the detection 
of complement fixing HLA antibodies with high sensitivity and s pecificity (Luminex-C1q).11 In renal 
transplantation, several small studies suggest that C1q-binding DSA correlates with transplant 
glomerulopathy (TG) and irreversible renal allograft failure.12 In particular, persistent complement 
binding DQ-specific DSA is associated with a 30% lower 5-year a llograft survival. In a recent large 
study in a cohort of 1016 renal transplant recipients, co-autho red by co-investigator Dr. Adriana 
Zeevi,  the presence of DSA and C1q-binding donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies at 1 year, or at 
the time of acute rejection within 1 year, was correlated with 5 year allograft survival (Figure 2). 
Patients with complement-binding DSA had significantly reduced 5-year allograft survival (54%) 
compared to those with non-complement binding DSA (93%) . C1q binding of de novo DSA was 
independently associated with graft loss whether it was detecte d in samples taken at the one year 
protocol biopsies or in samples taken during acute rejection in the first-year post-transplantation.

   D S A  phenotype.  Panel A: conventional Luminex-IgG vs. no DSA.  
Panel B: Luminex-IgG and C1q vs. no DSA.  
 
2.2 Study rationale  
 The optimal treatment for DSA in lung transplant recipients rem ains unclear. In a recent study, 65 
lung transplant recipients who developed DSA were treated preem ptively before the development 
of BOS with either IVIG alone or IVIG/rituximab.
13 On follow-up evaluation, persistence of DSA 
despite therapy was associated with increased BOS (Figure 3B). However, recipients treated with IVIG alone had persistence of DSA comparable to those treated with IVIG/rituximab (35% vs.38%, respectively). Thus, while there was no untreated control group, these data suggest that the addition of rituximab therapy did not enhance DSA clearance  and had no significant effect on 
freedom from BOS (Figure 3A) compared to IVIG alone. These data  indicate that either IVIG alone 
or IVIG/rituximab therapy results in substantial persistence of DSA in lung transplant recipients (35%), and is associated with significantly increased progression to BOS.

Figure 3.  Freedom from BOS in lung transplant recipients with DSA treate d with  IVIG vs. IVIG/rituximab 
and in patients who cleared vs. persisted DSA.  
 
Since rituximab appears to add little to conventional therapy, proteasome inhibition with 
bortezomib alone and in combination with conventional therapy w as investigated in 6 renal 
transplant recipients.  Bortezomib-based therapy effectively tr eated 6 patients with refractory 
combined AMR/ACR and stably reduced DSA by at least 50% (figure  4, next page).14 Moreover, 
a single cycle of Bortezomib alone was as effective as Bortezom ib combined with PLEX and IVIG 
or rituximab in reducing de novo DSA.15 Of 11 patients (bortezomib alone), 4 had a 50% decrease 
in DSA, while 7 had complete remission (CR; MFI<1000) which lasted >2 years in 3/7.41 Patients 
with stable CR, had a lower serum CR at 14 months than those wi th DSA relapse –adding 
credence to the notion that successful treatment of DSA may alter outcome. Importantly proteasome inhibitors were well tolerated, and neither overall IgG nor IgG levels for childhood immunizations were changed.
16,17 The relatively specific loss of DSA after proteasome inhibitor  
therapy may relate to their predominant effect on the most active antibody responses, with residual DSA binding to the allograft. Interestingly, recent evidence in vitro indicates that proteasome inhibitors induce B cell apoptosis in addition to th e effects on plasma cells and 
therefore, may impact and expand cell populations targeted by a nti-CD20 based therapies.

  Figure 4.  Reduction of immunodominant DSA following 
  Bortezomib therapy in 6 r enal transplant recipients 
 
Carfilzomib has mechanistic advantages over bortezomib.  Carfilzomib has irreversible activity at the proteasome and an extraordinarily short half-life which eli minates concerns of subsequent 
removal by PLEX.  Moreover, carfilzomib has been effective in s tudies of bortezomib-refractory 
multiple myeloma.
19-21  As such, the PICARD-Lung investigators conducted a small pilo t study of 
combination carfilzomib-based therapy in 7 lung transplant reci pients who met the diagnostic 
criteria for AMR and required therapy and had previously failed  other conventional regimens for 
AMR consisting of PLEX, IVIG, and rituximab or bortezomib.  LT recipients with AMR were treated 
with CFZ-based therapy (8 1.5x volume plasma exchanges (PE) eve ry-other day, 1.2 g/kg total 
immunoglobulin, and 6 doses of CFZ 20 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16). Luminex IgG and

  p. 14 of 48  C1q DSA in neat serum, PFTs, and biopsy (TBBx) were done at bas eline and repeated 4-6 weeks 
post-therapy. 7 patients received CFZ-based therapy. Patients 1-4 were refractory to rituximab-
based therapy; patient 4 was refractory to both rituximab and bortezomib-based therapy. FEV1 
at AMR diagnosis was significantly reduced from baseline (-19.8 %, p<0.01) and oxygen 
requirements worsened in all patients. DSA were of moderate to strong strength by IgG and 6 of 
7 fixed complement by C1q (MFI>500) at baseline (table 1). TBBx  in patients 2 and 5 were 
diffusely positive for pericap illary C4d; patient 5 had diffuse  neutrophilic capillaritis, and patient 4 
had minimal cellular rejection (A1). All pathologic findings of  AMR resolved after therapy. DSA 
IgG MFI declined significantly (p=0.02) and 6 of 7 DSA became n on-complement fixing after 
therapy (table). Oxygen requirem ents improved in all patients; 5 patients recovered to discharge 
with stable allograft function; patient #6 remains chronically ventilated. FEV1 data were available 
in 6 patients and either stabiliz ed or rose in 5 of the 6 patie nts (figure 5). One patient died due to 
end-stage BOS, transient thrombocytopenia occurred in 2 patient s which recovered, acute kidney 
injury occurred in 3 patients and recovered in 2 patients; pati ent 5 was critically ill during treatment 
and remains dialysis dependent.  Thus, carfilzomib-based therap y appears useful for AMR after 
lung transplantation in this small cohort.

Considering the recent studies by Witt22 and Snyder3 demonstrating 
the difficulty and frequent failure of various regimens to trea t AMR in 
LT recipients, these preliminary data showing an impact using a  
carfilzomib-based treatment regimen for established DSA respons es

As a result of these positive preliminary findings, expansion of the sample size is required to 
confirm both the efficacy of combination therapy with carfilzomib as well as the safety of such an 
approach in this population.   3. OBJECTIVES

  p. 15 of 48  the clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, or chronic rejection, limits both patient 
survival and quality of life.  The impact of donor-specific ant i HLA-antibodies (DSA) and AMR on 
the early development and progression of BOS have been well-des cribed.3,13,22  In addition to 
these data, our preliminary data show a dramatic reduction in l ung function in the presence of 
DSA, accelerated diagnosis of phenotypically more advanced BOS,  and early mortality.  At 
present, targeting this pathway represents a viable approach to impact these key risk factors, DSA and AMR, and decrease expression of chronic rejection, graft loss, and patient death.  Additionally, major gaps in our knowledge of the antibody-media ted phenotype of BOS exist.  
While early evidence of clinical benefit appears to exist in ou r preliminary data, this needs to be 
validated with larger patient numbers. Moreover, the underlying  mechanisms of potential benefit 
remain to be elucidated.  
 
Conventional therapy for this problem, including plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulins, are limited and targeted at removal of circulating antibody; not at the antibody-producing apparatus, the plasma cell.
13,23  Thus, our hypothesis is that the combination of 
conventional therapy with plasma-cell targeted therapy using th e proteasome-inhibitor 
carfilzomib in symptomatic lung transplant recipients with AMR will improve/stabilize allograft function and result in depletion of the immunodominan t DSA.  In this proposal, we 
will conduct a pilot phase II open label observational trial in lung transplant recipients to test whether addition of carfilzomib to conventional therapy improve s short-term outcomes after the 
diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection, and to identify the c ellular mechanisms that support 
these clinical benefits. Clinical and immune phenotyping of stu dy subjects will advance our 
understanding of anticipated therapeutic responses.  Specifically, cellular mechanistic studies to 
detect immune system changes that will enable us to phenotype L TRs with AMR and determine 
or predict risk and outcomes, such as BOS.  Patients who have m et the clinical diagnosis of AMR 
requiring therapy will be targeted for enrollment in the study and treated with the open-label 
carfilzomib-based combination protocol.    
To execute this study, we have established the Combination Therapy with the Proteasome 
Inhibitor Carfilzomib for the Antibody-Mediated Rejection Diagn osis in Lung 
Transplantation (PICARD-Lung) Trial Study Group.  This clinical trial will be executed at the 
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center leveraging the expertis e and prowess of one of the 
highest-volume clinical lung transplant services worldwide, the  McDyer immunology lab, and the 
Zeevi immunohistochemistry and histocompatibility labs.    
1: To test the hypothesis in a prospective interventional clinical  trial that addition of 
carfilzomib to conventional therapy will result in depletion of the immunodominant DSA. In this trial, lung transplant recipients will be treated with the carfilzomib-based combination 
protocol and screened with Luminex single antigen bead testing to identify DSA burden by IgG 
and functional status by C1q before and after treatment.    2: To test the hypothesis in a prospective interventional clinical  trial that addition of 
carfilzomib to conventional therapy will result in improved or stabilized allograft function.   
In this trial, lung transplant recipients will be treated with the carfilzomib-based combination 
protocol and screened with pulmonary function testing to identify whether forced expiratory 
volume in 1 second returns to pre-AMR diagnosis level.   
 3: To test the hypothesis that lung transplant recipients with AMR have effector B 
cell/plasma cell populations that can be identified and characterized, and that carfilzomib alters these immune mechanisms.   In this trial, we will determine the immunologic phenotype

plasma cells, and respective pathologic and immunohistochemical  correlates relevant to AMR.   
 
The PICARD-Lung investigators and the study center are highly e xperienced clinical and 
translational investigations in lung transplantation.  Successf ul completion of these specific aims 
will establish the safety and efficacy of combination therapy with carfilzomib/PLEx/IVIG for AMR after lung transplantation and elucidate important clinical and immunologic phenotypes and mechanisms associated with these outcomes.  Thus, the results of this trial will advance treatment 
efforts for AMR, which are desperately needed, as well as provi de important insights into the link 
between AMR and BOS, the latter of which significantly limits l ong-term outcomes in lung 
transplant recipients. Lastly, we fully anticipate this study w ill lay the foundation fo r future clinical 
and basic investigation, perhaps at the multi-center level, to further delineate the role and immune 
effects of carfilzomib in the treatment of AMR and the preventi on of BOS. 
 
4 STUDY DESIGN  Phase II, prospective, open-label, single-arm active treatment,  single center pilot clinical trial of 
the addition of carfilzomib to conventional therapy for AMR aft er lung transplantation.  
 Study site: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh PA USA  Conventional therapy for AMR:   Therapeutic plasma exchange (PLE X )  1 . 5  p l a s m a  v o l u m e s  
replaced with 5% albumin or fresh frozen plasma for 8 sessions every-other day.  Total 
intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) 100 mg/kg IV after each PLEX  with the exception of the final 
PLEX where IVIG 500 mg/kg will be given. On day 16, if the IgG level is below 700 mg/dL, an additional dose of IVIG 500 mg/kg will be administered. If the IgG result is found to be 700ml/dL 
or higher, the  IVIG 500mg/kg dose will not be administered. Premedications will be given for IVIG as follows: acetaminophen 650 mg PO and diphenhydramine 25 mg P O both at least 30 minutes 
prior to and not more than 6 hours before IVIG, unless otherwis e directed on the part of one of 
the investigators if believed to be in the best interests of pa tient care.  On days where IVIG and 
CFZ are given together, only one set of premedications will be administered. Conventional 
therapy requires an inpatient hospital stay.  Patients will receive a tunneled PLEX catheter and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) inserted by interventional radiology in the routine clinical care of these patients prior to receiving any conventi onal or carfilzomib therapy.  
 
Carfilzomib dosing schedule: Car filzomib will be administered o n the multiple myeloma schedule 
consisting of 20 mg/m
2 on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 to constitute one therapeutic cycle.  On 
PLEX/IVIG days, carfilzomib will be given in between PLEX and I VIG to avoid inadvertent 
blockade of the Fcγ receptor.  Carfilzomib will be delivered vi a central access IV over 30 minutes 
(+15 minutes); slowed to 60 minutes (+15 minutes) if infusion reactions occur.  Carfilzomib will be diluted in a total of 80 mL dextrose 5% water (D5W) for adminis tration.  Premedications for 
carfilzomib administration will be given as follows:  acetamino phen 650 mg PO, diphenhydramine 
25 mg PO, ondansetron 4 mg PO, prednisone 40 mg PO or methylpre dnisolone 40 mg IV, all at 
least 30 minutes prior to and not more than 6 hours before carfilzomib, unless otherwise directed 
on the part of one of the investigators if believed to be in the best interests of patient care.  Preinfusion hydration with a one-time bolus of 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride will be given at least 
30 minutes prior to and not more than 6 hours before carfilzomib to minimize the nephrotoxic AE.   
Postinfusion hydration with a one-time bolus of 250 mL 0.9% sod ium chloride may be given 
immediately after carfilzomib to minimize the nephrotoxic AE

  p. 17 of 48  4.1  Rationale 
 
Carfilzomib is marketed for multiple myeloma and this IST represents an off label use of 
carfilzomib; thus, the criteria for phase II designation have been met.  This prospective, open-label, single-arm active treatment trial will establish the rat e of response to carfilzomib (in addition 
to conventional therapy) for AMR after lung transplantation.  T his information will be necessary 
for use in planning further larger dual-arm placebo or active t herapy controlled clinical trials.  This 
trial will enroll 30 patients at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.  The volume of lung 
transplants performed and the rate of diagnosis of AMR at UPMC will allow for adequate 
enrollment of study patients within the 3-year study period.   
 The dosing strategy of carfilzom ib will follow that of the multiple myeloma schedule as described 
below in section 5.3.  This dosing strategy has been well-studied in patients with myeloma (see 
trial designations below) and has proven to result in an accept able AE profile for the patients with 
AMR after lung transplantation. In addition, our preliminary of f label experiences with this dosing 
strategy have yielded an acceptable AE profile in lung transpla nt recipients with AMR.  
 
Trial designations:  Carfilzomib has been evaluated in 2 completed Phase 1 studies (PX-171-
001 and PX-171-002), 5 completed Phase 1b/2 studies (PX-171-003 , PX-
171-004, PX-171-005, PX-171-006, and PX-171-008), and in 1 comp leted, 
Phase 2, expanded-access study (Study 2011-002, Carfilzomib Mul tiple 
Myeloma Expanded Access Protocol [C-MAP]) that was co-sponsored by Amgen and the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation. 
 
Carfilzomib is currently being evaluated in 2 ongoing Phase 1 s tudies 
(CFZ001 [Renal] and CFZ002 [Hepatic]), 5 ongoing Phase 1b/2 stu dies 
(PX-171-007, PX-171-010, 2012-002 [CHAMPION 1], 2012-003 [CHAMPION 2], and CFZ004 [small cell lung cancer]), 4 ongoing P hase 3 
studies (PX-171-009 [ASPIRE], PX-171-011 [FOCUS], 2011-003 
[ENDEAVOR], and 2012-005 [CLARION]), and 2 ongoing Phase 1/2 
studies sponsored by Ono Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd in Japan (ONO-7 057-
01 and ONO-7057-02).  Data are available from the following 10 company-sponsored Phas e 1,1b, 
and 2 studies: PX-171-001, PX-171-002, PX-171-003, PX-171-004, PX-
171-005, PX-171-006, PX-171-007, PX-171-008, PX-171-010 (ongoin g), 
and 2012-002, (CHAMPION 1, ongoing). Of these, 9 studies enroll ed 
multiple myeloma subjects. Study PX-171-007 also enrolled subje cts with 
lymphoma and solid tumors. Study PX-171-008 enrolled solid tumo r 
subjects only. Data also are available from a company-sponsored , Phase 
2, expanded-access study (Study 2011-002 [C-MAP]) and 2 ongoing  
Phase 1/2 Ono-sponsored studies (ONO-7057-01 and ONO-7057-02). Furthermore, after the IB data cutoff date of 10 July 2014, a p re-planned 
interim analysis was performed for the Phase 3 Study PX-171-009  
(ASPIRE) on 01 August 2014 and a final analysis was performed for the Phase 3 Study PX-171-011 (FOCUS) on 11 August 2014. 
 
Five Phase 3 studies have been or are being conducted. Safety a nd 
efficacy results are available for 2 completed studies, Study P X-171-009 
(ASPIRE) and Study PX-171-011 (FOCUS); subjects are still being  
followed for safety in both studies and for final OS in Study P X-171-009

  p. 22 of 48  4.4.4 Exploratory outcomes 
 
Exploratory outcomes of the study include the following: 
 4.4.4.1 Identification of antibody producing cells (APCs) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs), such as activated B cells and plasmablasts in patients before and during carfilzomib therapy, compared to LTRs without AMR and not recei ving carfilzomib.  This 
will be done using a combination of techniques including MHC class I and II tetramers, 
overlapping peptides to key MHC that are targeted by DSA respon ses, and an ELISPOT 
assay (so-called ex vivo studies). 
 
4.4.4.2 Expansion of B cells from PBMC using a cytokine/anti-CD 40 ligand cocktail as well as 
EBV transformation. We will then determine whether these B cell  stimuli lead to detectable 
levels of in vitro alloantibody (compared to serum anti-HLA Abs  detected by the HLA 
laboratory). Using carfilzomib in vitro, we will also determine  whether it decreases the 
expansion of these APCs and blocks alloantibody production. 
 4.5 Safety plan 
 
Patients will be enrolled accord ing to the inclusion and exclus ion criteria established in section 
5.3.  Patients will provide informed consent to participate in this clinical trial.  In the informed 
consent process, patients will be educated about the purpose fo r carfilzomib and the potential 
adverse effects as described in section 6.1.1.  Adverse effects  will be recorded and graded 
according to the CTCAE as descr ibed above in section 4.4.3.  Se rious adverse effects (SAE) will 
be reported timely as required and established in section 6.4.  A study data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be established  consisting of 3 members who 
represent non-funded non-investigators with no conflicts of int erest regarding carfilzomib or the 
IST funding agency.  The study investigators will invite qualif ied individuals to participate in the 
DSMB.  The DSMB members will possess either PharmD, PhD, or MD qualifications and have a 
working knowledge of lung transplantation and AMR.  The DSMB wi ll be chaired by one of the 
three members as determined by the DSMB membership.  The DSMB w ill meet once yearly to 
review study progress, to ensure appropriate enrollment milesto nes are being met, and to review 
the adverse event reporting.  The DSMB will meet on an ad-hoc basis to review any SAEs.    
The DSMB may terminate the study only after at least 15 patient s have been enrolled.  The DSMB 
may only terminate the study for safety reasons in which the pe rceived risks of continuing to 
provide carfilzomib to upcoming patients who may be enrolled outweighs the potential benefit to 
the patient and the allograft.  The DSMB may not terminate the study for any reason related to 
carfilzomib efficacy.   
 
4.6 Ethical considerations  There are no identifiable ethical considerations that would pre clude the execution of this clinical 
trial.  Patients cannot receive placebo since this IST represen ts a single-arm active-treatment trial.

  p. 25 of 48  Active varicella zoster infection 
 
5.1.3.4 Exclusion related to medications 
 Previous intolerance to carfilzomib Concurrent use of another proteasome inhibitor (e.g., bortezomi b) 
  
5.2 Treatment assignment  
 This is an open-label single-arm active-treatment study; thus, patients will be assigned to 
carfilzomib therapy in the order in which they are enrolled.   
5.3 Study treatment 
 Conventional therapy for AMR:   Therapeutic plasma exchange (PLE X )  1 . 5  p l a s m a  v o l u m e s  
replaced with 5% albumin or fresh frozen plasma for 8 sessions every-other day.  Total 
intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) 100 mg/kg IV after each PLEX  with the exception of the final 
PLEX where IVIG 500 mg/kg will be given.  On day 16, if the IgG level is below 700 mg/dL, an additional dose of IVIG 500 mg/kg will be administered.  If the  IgG result is found to be 700ml/dL 
or higher, the  IVIG 500mg/kg dose will not be administered.  Premedications will be given for IVIG as follows: acetaminophen 650 mg PO and diphenhydramine 25 mg PO both at least 30 minutes prior to and not more than 6 hours before IVIG, unless otherwise directed on the part of 
one of the investigators if believed to be in the best interests of patient care.  On days where IVIG 
and CFZ are given together, only one set of premedications will be administered. Conventional 
therapy requires an inpatient hospital stay.  Patients will receive a tunneled PLEX catheter and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) inserted by interventional radiology in the routine clinical care of these patients prior to receiving any conventi onal or carfilzomib therapy.  
 
Conventional therapy rationale: PLEX serves two important roles  in this regimen: first, to remove 
circulating injurious DSA, and second, to turn on the plasma cell apparatus due to depletion in 
order to enhance selection of highly active cells by the protea some inhibitor.  IVIG also serves 
two purposes: first, to provide putative Ig replacement to decrease infectious complications from PLEX, and second, to blunt the rebound antibody response due to depletion.  Investigational carfilzomib will be given to enrolled patients between PLEX and  IVIG on PLEX days, and alone 
on non-PLEX days.  The rationale to insert carfilzomib between PLEX and IVIG is to avoid any 
derangements to the Fcγ receptor (FcγR) by IVIg and allow carfilzomib unfettered access to the highly active plasma cells.  
 5.3.1 Investigational therapy 
 
Carfilzomib (in addition to conventional therapy).  Please refer to appendix D, investigators brochure for additional information regarding carfilzomib and c linical trial data.  
 5.3.1.1 Dosage, administration, and storage  
Carfilzomib dosing schedule: Car filzomib will be administered o n the multiple myeloma schedule 
consisting of 20 mg/m
2 on days 1 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 (one cycle) to constitute one therapeutic 
cycle.  On PLEX/IVIG days, carf ilzomib will be given in between PLEX and IVIG to avoid 
inadvertent blockade of the Fcγ receptor.  Carfilzomib will be delivered via central access IV over 
30 minutes (+15 minutes); slowed to 60 minutes (+15 minutes) if infusion reactions occur.  
Protocol: PICARD‐AMR  
Molecule: Carfilzomib  
  p. 26 of 48  Carfilzomib will be diluted in a total of 80 mL dextrose 5% water (D5W) for administration.  
Premedications for carfilzomib administration will be given as follows:  acetaminophen 650 mg 
PO, diphenhydramine 25 mg PO, ondansetron 4 mg PO, prednisone 40 mg PO or methylprednisolone 40 mg IV, all at least 30 minutes prior to a nd not more than 6 hours before 
carfilzomib, unless otherwise directed on the part of one of the investigators if believed to be in the best interests of patient care.  Preinfusion hydration with  a one-time bolus of 250 mL 0.9% 
sodium chloride will be given at least 30 minutes prior to and not more than 6 hours before 
carfilzomib to minimize the nephrotoxic AE.   Postinfusion hydration with a one-time bolus of 250 
mL 0.9% sodium chloride may be given immediately after carfilzo mib to minimize the nephrotoxic 
AE 
 Carfilzomib may be administered for 1-2 complete cycles in the study. A second cycle may be 
given for lack of resolution of AMR or for continued detection of DSA in the absence of allograft 
improvement.  If > one cycle is needed, the patient must still meet the enrollment criteria prior to 
the second cycle, and must not have had improvement after the f irst cycle or have experienced 
regression from initial improvement to qualify for a second study cycle.  If > two cycles are desired, 
these must be given outside of the study.  If > two cycles are desired, the third cycle must not be 
given within 90 days of day 1 of the first cycle.  If the third cycle begins within this 90 day period, 
this will constitute a protocol violation.  
 5.3.1.2 Dosage modification for drug related toxicity  AES grade III or IV that have not reduced to grade II or less at the time that the next dose 
is due and are considered related to the study drug will be sub ject to dose modification 
or hold.

5.3.2 Concomitant therapy 
 
Conventional therapy for AMR:   Therapeutic plasma exchange (PLE X )  1 . 5  p l a s m a  v o l u m e s  
replaced with 5% albumin or fresh frozen plasma for 8 sessions every-other day.  Total 
intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) 100 mg/kg IV after each PLEX  with the exception of the final 
PLEX where IVIG 500 mg/kg will be given. On day 16, if the IgG level is below 700 mg/dL, an additional dose of IVIG 500 mg/kg will be administered.  If the  IgG result is found to be 700ml/dL 
or higher, the  IVIG 500mg/kg dose will not be administered.  Premedications will be given for IVIG as follows: acetaminophen 650 mg PO and diphenhydramine 25  mg PO both 30 minutes 
prior to IVIG, unless otherwise directed on the part of one of the investigators if believed to be in the best interests of patient care.  Conventional therapy requi res an inpatient hospital stay.  
Patients will receive a tunneled PLEX catheter and peripherally  inserted central catheter (PICC) 
inserted by interventional radiology in the routine clinical ca re of these patients prior to receiving 
any conventional or carfilzomib therapy.   Contraception 
 
Female: 
Women of childbearing potential must either agree to abstain fr om sexual intercourse or use an 
effective birth control method during treatment with carfilzomi b.  Given that carfilzomib was 
clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration test in peri pheral blood lymphocytes, as a 
precaution, females of childbearing potential and/or their male partners should use effective 
contraception methods or abstain from sexual activity during an d for 30 days after treatment 
with carfilzomib. If pregnancy occurs during this time, patients should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Kyprolis (carfilzomib) should only be used during pregnancy if the 
potential benefits to the mother outweigh the potential risks to the fetus.  
 
Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, carfilzomib can cause fetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman. Carfilzomib caused embryo ‐fetal toxicity in pregnant 
rabbits at doses that were lower than in subjects receiving the  recommended dose. Carfilzomib 
administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis was not 
teratogenic at doses up to 2 mg/kg/day in rats or up to 0.8 mg/ kg/day in rabbits. If carfilzomib is 
used during pregnancy, or if the subject becomes pregnant while  taking this drug, she should 
inform the investigator or study staff immediately. The investi gator should notify Amgen of the 
pregnancy and discuss follow ‐up with the subject. It is not known if carfilzomib will reduce the 
efficacy of oral contraceptives. Due to an increased risk of venous thrombosis associated with 
carfilzomib, subjects currently  using oral contraceptives or a hormonal method of contraception 
associated with a risk of thrombosis should consider an alterna tive method of effective 
contraception.  
Male:  
Males of reproductive potential should be advised to avoid fath ering a child while being treated 
with carfilzomib. The potential for carfilzomib to be transferred via semen and its effect on sperm are unknown. Male subjects treated with carfilzomib and/or thei r female partners (if of 
childbearing potential) should use effective contraceptive meth ods or abstain from sexual 
activity while treated with carfilzomib and refrain from donati ng sperm while on carfilzomib and 
for 90 days after treatment. If pregnancy occurs during this ti me, patients should be apprised of 
the potential hazard to the fetus, study drug should be interrupted, and a serum pregnancy test

  p. 30 of 48  5.4 Study assessments 
 
See appendix B for full listing of study data collection.  
 Study therapy will be given as an inpatient.  Screening patient s for AMR as defined above in 
section 4.3 for enrollment in the trial may occur as an inpatie nt or outpatient.  Patients will undergo 
a minimum 16 day hospitalization for conventional AMR therapy a nd for study carfilzomib.  
Patients may return to the clinic for standard of care visits o n days 28 and 42 and 90 (2 and 4 and 
10 weeks post therapy completion) for assessment as described b elow. 
 Patients will be followed in the study until day 90.  There are  no follow-up visits as part of this 
research study, however, if patients return to their standard o f care routine visits, a medical 
record review will be performed to obtain this data from patien ts’ medical records, whenever 
available. Patients will be subsequently followed by their trea ting physician under routine clinical 
care for recurrent AMR until they expire and any available clin ical information related to their 
standard lung transplant care will be obtained from medical records up to 360 days.  For patients who prematurely discontinue therapy, all future pl anned study and routine clinical 
care assessments will be completed unless the patient expires.  An assessment for the purpose 
for premature discontinuation will be taken at the time of stud y discontinuation.  
 The University of Pittsburgh laboratories will be used to asses s all samples.  DSA samples will be 
processed by the University of Pittsburgh Histocompatibility La b under the direction of co-
investigator Dr. Zeevi.  PBMC isolation, and exploratory testin g samples will be process by the 
research lab of co-principal investigator Dr. McDyer.   5.4.1 Definition of study assessments  Standard of Care procedures:  
 
History and Physical Exam: A complete patient history and physi cal exam includes the evaluation 
of the head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat (HEENT), cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurologic systems.  Changes from baseline 
abnormalities will be recorded at each subsequent physical examination.  New or worsened abnormalities will be recorded as AEs if deemed to be related to study therapy.   
 
Complete blood count: white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hemat ocrit, and platelet count. 
WBC differential: absolute neutrophil, lymphocyte, eosinophil, and monocyte counts. 
 Complete metabolic panel (CMP): sodium, potassium, chloride, bi carbonate, blood urea nitrogen, 
serum creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, AST,  ALT, Alkaline phosphatase, 
and total bilirubin levels.   Pulmonary function tests: forced expiratory volume in 1 second,  forced vital capacity, forced 
expiratory flow.  
Biopsy: transbronchial forceps biopsy.  
 Luminex SAB: whole blood draw for processing by the HLA lab.   Luminex C1q-SAB: whole blood draw for processing by the HLA lab .  
Protocol: PICARD‐AMR  
Molecule: Carfilzomib  
  p. 31 of 48   
Complement 3 and 4: whole blood draw for processing by the UPMC  basic laboratory. 
 Research Procedures:  Pregnancy test: all women of childbearing potential will have a  serum pregnancy test within 7 
days prior to study drug administration.   
 Total IgG and IgG subclasses: whole blood draw for processing by the HLA lab. This samples 
will only be obtained if patient is coming to their standard of  care visit on days 28, 42 and 90 
(±14 days).  Blood for PBMC: whole blood draw for processing by the McDyer l ab. This sample will only be 
obtained if patient is coming to their standard of care visit o n days 28, 42 and 90 (±14 days). 
  5.5 Screening and pretreatment assessments  
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to con firm that patients meet all 
eligibility criteria before the first infusion of carfilzomib. Written informed consent for participation 
in the study must be obtained before performing any study-speci fic screening tests or evaluations.  
Informed consent forms will be maintained at the study site.  Refer to Section 4, table 4 for specific 
delineations.   
5.6 Assessments during treatment 
 All visits must occur within ± 14 days of the scheduled data, unless otherwise noted.  Assessments scheduled on the day of study drug administration should be per formed prior to study drug 
infusion, unless otherwise noted.  We will collect results from medical records from procedures 
done as Standard of Care (biopsies, PFTs, bronchoscopies, physical exam, lab results, PLEX 
and IVIG). Standard of Care procedures will not be done solely for research purposes.  
 5.7 Study completion  Patients discontinued from the study early (dropout) will be as ked to return to the clinic within 30 
days after the last infusion of carfilzomib for a follow-up vis it.  
 5.8 Follow-up assessments   Ongoing AEs thought to be related to carfilzomib will be follow ed until the event has resolved to 
baseline, the event is assessed by the investigators to be stable, the patient is lost to follow up, the patient withdraws consent, or when it is determined the AE is not related to study drug.   5.9 Patient discontinuation  Patients will be removed from study continuation if the toxicit ies of therapy are deemed by the 
investigators to outweigh the potential benefit of therapy.  Such toxicities may include severe thrombocytopenia (platelets < 10,000 x 10
6), acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement 
therapy, or severe hepatitis (ALT > 1000), or others deemed rel evant to the individual patient by 
the investigators.   
Protocol: PICARD‐AMR  
Molecule: Carfilzomib  
  p. 32 of 48  If patients discontinue study drug early, these patients may be replaced in the study by patients 
who are likely to complete at least 1 cycle of carfilzomib.  
 
The investigators have the right to discontinue a patient from the study for any medical condition that the investigator determines may jeopardize the patient’s s afety if he or she continues in the 
study or if the investigator determines discontinuation is in the best interest of the patient.   5.10 Study discontinuation  
 
Amgen may discontinue the study prematurely for the following r easons:  the incidence or severity 
of AEs in this study indicates a potential serious health hazar d to patients, if enrollment is 
sufficiently poor, or if data recording is inaccurate or incomplete.   
 
5.11 Post-trial access  No post-trial access of carfilzomib will be available to patien ts under the auspices of the study.  
Additional off label marketed carfilzomib may be given to patients outside of the study if necessary 
under the routine clinical care of the patient; however, such a dministration must not occur before 
day 90.  If such administration occurs prior to day 90, this wi ll reflect a protocol violation.  
 
5.12 Assay methods  All blood draws will be acquired with usual clinical techniques .  Luminex SAB and C1q-SAB and 
IgG subclass identification will be performed using usual clinical techniques as directed by the HLA lab under the CLIA approved standard practice.  All routine  labs (CBC, WBC differential, 
CMP) will be performed using usual clinical techniques as direc ted by the basic laboratory under 
the CLIA approved standard practice.  PBMC isolation and subseq uent exploratory testing will 
occur under usual investigatory  techniques as directed by Dr. M cDyer.  
 5.13 Statistical methods  Data will only be analyzed in aggregate at study conclusion for the final enrolled patient on the efficacy and safety outcomes.    
Descriptive statistics will be used to describe baseline and st udy characteristics of patients.  
Univariate parametric and nonparametric assessments, where appr opriate, will be used to assess 
change from baseline in the efficacy and safety outcomes.  Kaplan-Meier method will be used to 
describe freedom from endpoints and mortality in the patients t reated with carfilzomib.  Kaplan-
Meier method will be used to visually represent the time to eve nts and overall event rate in the 
patients in this pilot, not to compare events to any other group.  
 5.13.1 Analysis of the conduct of the study  Enrollment, protocol violations, and discontinuations from the study will be summarized by patient.  
 
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized usi ng means, standard deviations, 
medians, interquartile ranges.  All summaries will be presented  by group.  
 
Protocol: PICARD‐AMR  
Molecule: Carfilzomib  
  p. 33 of 48  Study drug administration data will be listed by dose level, an d any dose modifications will be 
flagged.  Means and standard deviations will be used to summari ze the total dose of carfilzomib 
received.  All summaries will be presented by group.  
 5.13.2 Safety analyses  All AE data will be listed by patient, cycle, and dose.  All AE  occurring after informed consent is 
given will be summarized by event, system, and grade.  All SAE will be listed and summarized 
separately.   5.13.3 Determination of sample size  The sample size for this trial is based on perceived appropriate enrollment of 10 patients per year 
for 3 consecutive years.  Since this is a single-arm, active-tr eatment study, no such calculation of 
statistical power is needed to quantitate the sample size.  
 5.14 Data quality assurance   
The Pulmonary Research Core will be responsible for data manage ment of this trial, including 
quality checking of the data.  Data will be collected and aggre gated in REDCap.  Investigators 
and support personnel from the research core will be responsible for entering the needed data 
into REDCap.  In the event of discrepant data, clarification wi ll be performed by the primary 
investigators.   
6 Assessment of safety 
 Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) as defined in this section; measurement of  protocol-specified hematology 
and basic chemistry laboratory values, measurement of protocol- specified vital signs, and other 
non-protocol specific tests that are deemed critical to the saf ety evaluation of the patient.   
 Investigators are responsible for reporting any SAE to Amgen as  described below. Amgen will be 
responsible for reporting SAEs to the appropriate regulatory bo dy.   
  
 
6.1 Possible risks and discomforts  6.1.1 Carfilzomib Risks  
Carfilzomib is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administratio n (FDA) to be used only in certain 
U.S. patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma that have tried and failed other 
therapies. It has not been approved to be used for any other di sease or condition. In this study, 
carfilzomib is an investigational study drug because it is not approved for use in all patients in the 
United States, and it is not approved by some regulatory author ities (the agencies that are 
responsible for approving the use of a medicine in a country su ch as the European Medicines 
Agency and Health Canada).      
Protocol: PICARD‐AMR  
Molecule: Carfilzomib  
  p. 34 of 48  6.1.2 Adverse effect (AE) definition 
 
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporarily associated with 
the use of an investigational medicinal product or other protoc ol-imposed intervention, regardless 
of attribution.   This includes the following:   
AEs not previously observed in the patient that emerge during c arfilzomib therapy (days 
1through 16, and 28, 42, 90), including signs or symptoms assoc iated with AMR that were 
not present prior to the AE reporting period.   Complications that occur as a result of protocol-mandated interventions. 
 
AEs that occur prior to the assignment of study treatment that are related to a protocol-
mandated intervention.   Preexisting conditions judged by the investigators to have wors ened in severity or 
frequency or changed in character during carfilzomib therapy (d ays 1through 16, and 28, 
42, 90). 
 6.1.3 Serious adverse effect (SAE) definition  
Death 
 
Life threatening experience defined as any adverse experience t hat places the subject, in 
the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of death at the time of occurrence; i.e., it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more sev ere form, might have caused 
death. 
 
Requires prolongation of the study hospitalization.  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of an exposed subject. 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospitalization, may be considered an SAE, when, based upon app ropriate medical 
judgment, it jeopardizes the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
 
All AEs that do not meet these criteria should be regarded as n on-serious AEs.  
 The terms serious and severe are not synonymous. Severity refer s to the intensity of an 
AE; thus, severe AEs may not repr esent serious AEs. SAEs includ e only the above items 
that are based on patient or event outcome or action criteria associated with events that 
pose a threat to the patient’s life or vital functions and requ ire reporting to appropriate 
regulatory agencies as defined in this section.

6.2 Methods and timing for cap turing and assessing safety param eters  
 
The investigators are responsible for ensuring that all AEs will be recorded on the AE form and 
SAEs are recorded on the SAE form.  All reportable SAE will be reported on the FDA MedWatch 
forms and reported to Amgen as defined in this section.  
 
6.2.1 Adverse event reporting period 
 
After informed consent is obtained but before any administratio n of study drug, only SAEs due to 
protocol mandated interventions will be recorded.  Any AE or SAE at any time after the first infusion of carfilzomib is initiated until day 16, and on days 28, 42, 90 ±14 days must be recorded 
by the investigators and reported to Amgen as defined in this s ection.  After this period, only SAEs 
deemed to be related to study drug will be recorded and reported.

Email (Only for sponsors with a secure email connection with Amgen):  svc‐ags‐in‐us@amgen.com 
 
6.2.2 Eliciting adverse events  
 A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning for eliciting AEs at all patient evaluation 
time points will be adopted. 
 
   This will include the following two questions directed to study subjects: 
Protocol: PICARD‐AMR  
Molecule: Carfilzomib  
  p. 38 of 48   
 How have you felt since your last infusion of carfilzomib? 
 
 Have you had any new or changed heal th problems since you were  last seen?  
 These questions will be asked in person at days 28, 42 and 90 ± 14 days, or by phone if patient 
does not return to their standard of care visit at these time points.  
6.2.3 Assessment of severity and causality of adverse events 
 Investigators will seek information on AEs and SAEs at each pat ient contact.  All AEs and SAEs, 
whether reported by the patient or noted by authorized study pe rsonnel, will be recorded in the 
patient’s medical record and reported on the AE or SAE forms an d reportable SAE on the FDA 
MedWatch form.  For each AE and SAE recorded, the investigators will make an as sessment of seriousness and 
severity based on the CTCAE criteria, and causality to carfilzo mib.  
 
6.3 Procedures for recording adverse events 
 All AEs will be recorded on the AE form .  Only one AE will be reported on one form.  For multiple 
AEs, multiple forms will be used.  Study investigators will be responsible for codifying and keeping electronic copies of the form in the study database in protecte d files on the Pitt Research servers.   
 
The Investigator-sponsor must be notified of the occurrence of any SAE within 24 hours of the 
investigator, designee, or site personnel’s knowledge of the ev ent. The Investigator-sponsor is 
responsible for notifying the appropriate health authorities (H As), ethics committees (ECs), and 
investigators, of any expedited, annual, or other periodic safe ty reports in accordance with 
applicable regulations.  Any safety report submission will cros s reference the Amgen 
investigational new drug (IND) or clinical trial approval (CTA)  number.  
 
The Investigator is also responsible for notifying the local EC s in accordance with local 
regulations. Additionally, the Investigator-sponsor is responsi ble for reporting SAEs to Amgen. 
 SAE Reporting by Investigator-sponsor to Amgen 
 
The Investigator-sponsor must inform Amgen in writing by e-mail  or fax at the contact information 
listed below for all SUSARs that are judged as reasonably relat ed to the Amgen study drug. Site 
will transmit the final CIOMS of that event to Amgen within twenty-four (24) hours of submitting the report to the applicable regulatory authority. 
 
For regulatory reporting purposes, an event of “Death, Cause Unknown” from the study shall be processed as a SUSAR.  All forms must be completed and provided  to Amgen in English.  
 The Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) may be referred to as an individual safety report or 
SAE Report, including Pregnancy Exposure Reports and Follow up Reports. The ICSR must be 
as complete as possible, at a minimum including event reference  number, protocol name and 
number, investigator contact information, specific patient identifiers (e.g., initials, patient number, date of birth or age, or gender), the name of the suspect Study  Drug, the date and dosage(s) of 
exposure, event,  the date(s) of event, country of event, “Seri ous” Criteria, Relationship/causality 
of Study Drug, Hospitalization history for
 the event, Event status/outcome, Relevant history (including 
Protocol: PICARD‐AMR  
Molecule: Carfilzomib  
  p. 39 of 48  diagnostics, laboratory values, radiographs, concomitant medica tions, and event treatment, and 
narrative summary.  
 
Sponsor shall be responsible for collecting all SAEs and Pregna ncy and Lactation Exposure 
Reports and will exercise commercially reasonable due diligence to obtain follow-up information on incomplete SAE or Pregnancy and Lactation Exposure Reports. In the event that the Company requires clarification or further information on individual SAE  or Pregnancy and Lactation 
Exposure Reports, Company will not  contact non-party investigators directly, but will route all such 
inquiries through Site for forwarding to such investigator(s). Site will be responsible to ensure such inquiries are completed and timely provided to Company.  Information not available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end date for the SAE, discharge summaries, lot numbers, relevant laboratory values, scan data a nd autopsy reports) which are  
received after the initial report must be documented on a follow-up form, and submitted to Amgen in the same timelines as outlined above.  Sponsor shall be responsible for obtaining follow-up information for the SAEs and demonstrate diligence in attemptin g to obtain such information by, 
among other things, maintaining written records of such attempt s. 
 
Other aggregate analysis including reports containing safety da ta generated during the course of 
the study is to be submitted to Amgen at the time the sponsor I SS submits to anybody governing 
research conduct i.e. RA, IRB etc. Final study report including  unblinding data when applicable 
and reports of unauthorized use of a marketed product to be sub mitted to Amgen at the time the 
sponsor ISS submits to anybody governing research conduct i.e. RA, IRB etc. but not later than 
one calendar year of study completion.  
Sponsor will provide an annual IND report to Amgen. Reports con taining safety data generated 
during the course of the study is to be submitted to Amgen at t he time the sponsor submits to 
anybody governing research conduct, i.e. regulatory authorities  and IRBs.    Sponsor will support 
reconciliation of all ICSRs at the end of the study at a minimum. 
 
6.3.1 Diagnosis  If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the AE form rather than individual signs and/or 
symptoms.  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms  cannot be medically 
characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event 
should be recorded as an AE or SAE. If a diagnosis is subsequen tly established, it should be 
reported as follow up information.    6.3.2 Persistent or recurrent AEs 
 
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between patient evaluation time points.  Such events will only be recorded once unless sev erity has increased since initial 
recording.  If a persistent AE becomes more severe, it shall be  recorded again.  
 A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolved between patient evaluation time points and 
subsequently occurs again.  All recurrent AEs shall be recorded  again.  
 
   
Protocol: PICARD‐AMR  
Molecule: Carfilzomib  
  p. 40 of 48  6.3.3 Abnormal laboratory values 
 
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that requi re active management will be 
recorded as AEs or SAEs.  If the lab is a sign of a disease, on ly the diagnosis needs to be 
recorded.  If the lab is not a sign of a disease, then the labo ratory value or the designated term 
should be recorded (e.g., transaminitis or ALT 1750).  Repeated  observations of the same lab 
abnormality from patient contact time point to time point need not be recorded again unless they 
have worsened in severity (e.g., serum creatinine of 1.8 for 2 lab draws will only be recorded 
once).   
 6.3.4 Deaths  Deaths meet the criteria for SAE and all rules and regulations regarding reporting as defined in 
this section must be fulfilled.  All deaths, irrespective of cause, will be recorded as SAEs and will 
be reported to the Sponsor.  This includes death due to progression of AMR.  Cause of death, if known, shall be recorded on the FDA Medwatch form.  If deaths a re due to progression of AMR, 
progression of study disease shall be recorded as a contributing factor.  If deaths are due to study therapy, such notation shall be recorded as a contributing factor.  If death occurs, it shall be noted 
on the FDA Medwatch form whether this death was expected or une xpected.  After study 
completion (day 90), deaths due to progression of AMR shall onl y be recorded for the purposes 
of data analysis in the study.   
 6.3.5 Preexisting medical conditions  
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the t ime of informed consent.  Such 
conditions shall be recorded in the study database.   
 A preexisting condition will only be recorded as an AE or SAE if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When recording such events, the 
investigators will make note of the characteristics that have worsened (e.g., increased systolic 
blood pressure for preexisting hypertension).   6.3.6 Worsening antibody mediated rejection  Worsening or progression of AMR shall not be recorded as an AE or SAE.  These data will be 
captured as efficacy assessment data only.   
 6.3.7 Prolonged hospitalization  Any AE that results in prolonging of the study hospitalization shall be documented on the FDA 
Medwatch form as an SAE and be subject to all the rules and reg ulations of reporting as described 
in this section.    6.3.8 Pregnancy  Pregnancy inclusion criteria 
 Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum preg nancy test within the 7 days 
prior to study drug administration.   
Protocol: PICARD‐AMR  
Molecule: Carfilzomib  
  p. 41 of 48  Women of childbearing potential must either agree to abstain fr om sexual intercourse or use an 
effective birth control method during treatment and for an addi tional 30 days after the last dose of 
carfilzomib.  Men who are sexua lly active with women of childbearing potential must either agree 
to abstain from sexual intercourse or use a condom with spermic ide during treatment and for an 
additional 30 days after the last dose of carfilzomib, and the female partner should consider using 
an effective method of birth control.   
 
Pregnancy exclusion criteria 
 
Women who are pregnant and/or breast feeding   6.3.8.1 Pregnancy reporting  
Subjects will be instructed to notify the investigator as soon as possible after learning becoming 
pregnant or the pregnancy of a partner during treatment of or u p to 30 days following the last 
study drug administration.  
 Pregnancy Reporting by Investigator-sponsor to Amgen  
 
Report Pregnancy and potential infant exposure including Lactat ion, within ten (10) calendar days 
of Sponsor awareness. Provide to Amgen the SAE reports associat ed with pregnancy.  SUSARs

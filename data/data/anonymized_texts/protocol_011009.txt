Study Design  
This is a multicenter, multinational, open-label study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK, and 
PD of lumasiran in infants and young children (<6 years of age) with a documented diagnosis of PH1, as 
determined by genetic analysis, and relatively preserved renal function. 
To be includ ed in the study, patients must reach an estimated gestational age of 37 weeks old (equivalent 
to full-term infant) but be less than 6 years old.  The urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio of at least 2 out of 3 
single-void collections during screening must be above the upper limit of normal (ULN) for age.  If the 
patient is ≥12 months old, eGFR must be >45 mL/min/1.73 m2 based on the Schwartz Bedside Formula.  
If the patient is <12 months old, then serum creatinine must be at or below the ULN for age. 
If the patient is taking therapeutic vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), the patient must have been on a stable 
regimen for at least 90 days before screening and must remain on this stable regimen until at least the 
Month 6 visit.  Dose adjustments for interval weight gain are  acceptable.  
Patients will be screened from Day -60 to Day - 1 to determine eligibility.  Patients who meet all eligibility 
criteria will be administered open -label lumasiran as a subcutaneous (SC) injection, utilizing weight-
based dosing, with dose adjustments for interval weight gain.  Patients will receive 3 loading doses (on Day 1, Month 1, and Month 2).  Starting at Month 3, patients will receive lumasiran either once monthly (patients weighing <10 kg) or once every 3 months (patients weighing ≥10 kg) at the maintenance dose.  
Efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics, and patient and caregiver experience and burden will be assessed.  Safety assessments will include collection of AEs, clinical 
laboratory tests, vital sign assessments, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examinations, and 
concomitant medications.  
This study will consist of 2 periods: a 6-month primary analysis period followed by a
 long-term extension 
period.  During the 6-month primary analysis period, patients will undergo efficacy and safety assessments every 2 weeks for the first month and monthly thereafter.  During the long-term extension period of up to 54 months, dosing will continue, and visits will occur at least every -3-months.

Amendment 2, 04 May 2020  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  6 Number of Planned Patients  
The planned enrollment for this study is 20 patients, including at least 1 patient <12 months of age with 
weight <10 kg at consent.  Patients who discontinue study drug or stop participation in the study prior to 
Month 6 may be replaced, and the analysis of data collection prior to discontinuation is addressed in the statistical analysis plan . 
Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria  
This study will include infants and young children (<6 years of age) with a documented diagnosis of PH1 
based on urinary oxalate excretion above the upper limit of normal (ULN) for age and confirmed alanine-
glyoxylate aminotransferase ( AGXT) mutations, with relatively preserved renal function at s creening 
(eGFR >45 mL/min/1.73 m
2 based on Schwartz Bedside Formula).  
Study Drug, Dose, and Mode of Administration   
Lumasiran is an investigational agent comprised of a synthetic, small interfering RNA (siRNA) (drug substance ALN-65585) covalently linked to a triantennary N- acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligand, 
designed to target liver hydroxyacid oxidase 1 (HAO1)  mRNA, decreasing production of glycolate 
oxidase (GO) and hence reducing hepatic oxalate production. 
Lumasiran will be administered as a subcutaneous (SC) injection with weight-based dosing, with dose 
adjustments for interval weight gain, as follows:  
Weight Loading Dose  
(Day 1, Month 1, Month 2)  Maintenance Dose  
(Month 3 and Beyond)  
<10 kg 6.0 mg/kg monthly for 3 months  3.0 mg/kg monthly  
≥10 to <20 kg 6.0 mg/kg monthly for 3 months  6.0 mg/kg every 3 months  
≥20 kg 3.0 mg/kg monthly for 3 months  3.0 mg/kg every 3 months  
For patients who weigh <20 kg, the dose will be based on a weight obtained within 7 days prior to dosing.  During periods of tim e when the COVID-19 pandemic impedes the ability of these patients to travel to 
the study site or healthcare professionals to go to patients' homes, a weight from up to 6 weeks prior to the planned monthly dose or up to 4 months prior to the planned quarte rly dose may be used to calculate the 
amount of lumasiran to be administered. 
For patients who weigh ≥20 kg, the dose may be based on a weight obtained up to 4 months prior to the 
planned quarterly dose. 
Patients with weight increases crossing the threshol d for the next weight -based dosing category (<10 kg 
to ≥10 kg or <20  kg to ≥20 kg) will follow the new dosing regimen for the remainder of the study or until 
the next dosing category threshold is reached (ie, patients will not switch back to the lower- weight dosing 
schedule if their body weight subsequently decreases).   
Patients in maintenance dosing who transition from <10 kg to ≥10 kg will continue to receive monthly 
doses at 3.0  mg/kg until the next visit that coincides with the Schedule of Assessments for patients 
weighing ≥10 kg.  Thereafter, patients will follow every-3-months dosing until the end of the study. 
Reference Treatment, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
Not applicable. 
Duration of Treatment and Study  
The duration of treatment with lumasiran is up to 60 months (a month is defined as 28 days).  The 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1-004  lumasiran  
Amendment 2, 04 May 2020  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  7 estimated total time on study for each patient is up to 62 months, including up to 2 months of screening 
followed by up to 60 months of treatment. 
Statistical Methods  
The sample size was determined based on feasibility considerations, not power calculations.  The Safety Analysis Set will include all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  The Efficacy 
Analysis Set will include all patients who received any amount of lumasiran and have at least one valid spot urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio value at baseline and at least one valid spot urinary oxalate:creatinine 
ratio value from assessment(s) at Month 3 to Month 6.  The PK Analysis Set will include all patients who 
received any amount of study drug and have at least 1 postdose blood sample for PK parameters.  
The Safety Analysis Set will be used for safety analyses and sensitivity analysis of efficacy.  The Efficacy 
Analysis Set will be used to evaluate efficacy endpoints.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  28 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Disease Overview  
Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by 
excessive oxalate production by the liver and consequent hyperoxaluria.  PH1 is caused by 
mutations in the alanine -glyoxylate aminotransferase ( AGXT) gene, which encodes the liver 
peroxisomal enzyme alanine- glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT).  As a consequence of AGT 
deficiency, glyoxylate accumulates and is oxidized to oxalate in the hepatocyte and ultimately transported to the kidneys for excretion.  Oxalate, in the form of its calcium salt, is excreted 
almost entirely by the kidney.  Due to its insolubility, calcium oxalate can crystallize readily in the urinary tract.  In PH1, excess urinary oxalate results in recurrent nephrolithiasis and/or 
nephrocalcinosis, which can lead to pain, infections, progressive kidney disease and failure, 
along with reduced quality of life.[ Cochat and Rumsby 2013]  As renal function declines, 
elimination of oxalate is further reduced, such that calcium oxalate accumulates in bone, 
vasculature, skin, retina, heart, and nervous system, resulting in severe end-organ damage.[Cochat and Rumsby 2013]  This devastating condition, systemic oxalosis, arises when 
the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has declined to below 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 
m
2.[Cochat and Rumsby 2013]  Without treatment, the disease progresses inexorably, and death 
from end-stage renal diseas e (ESRD) and/or complications of oxalosis is inevitable. [Cochat and 
Rumsby 2013; Harambat 2010; van der Hoeven 2012] 
Over 150 mutations in AGXT have been described.[ Williams 2009 ]  While the re are broad 
genotype–phenotype associations with the underlying causative defect, patients can present with 
very different symptoms, disease course, including timing of an individual’s eGFR decline, and 
treatment response. [Danpure 2014; Hoppe 1997]   Patients progress at various rates and an event 
that leads to acute or chronic worsening, such as an obstructive kidney stone or episode of 
dehydration, can occur at any time. 
The incidence of PH1 is approximately 1 in 120,000 live births, and the prevalence is 1 to 3 per 
million in North America and Europe.[ Cochat and Rumsby 2013; Hopp 2015; Hoppe 2010]  The 
disease is more prevalent in areas where consanguineous marriages are common, especially in 
the Middle East and Northern Africa.[ Al-Eisa 2004; Boualla 2015; Frishberg 2005; Kamoun and 
Lakhoua 1996] 
PH1 often presents as a pediatric disease, but many patients remain undiagnosed for years after 
the initial clinical manifestations of the disease. [Lieske 2005; Mandrile 2014; van Woerden 
2003]  A recently published analysis of 247 patients with PH1 from 206 pedigrees in the Rare 
Kidney Stone Consortium PH Registry demonstrated a median age of first symptoms at 5.2 years 
of age and a cumulative renal survival of 76%, 43%, and 12% at 20 years, 40 years, and 60 
years, respectively. [Hopp 2015]  Similarly, an analysis of 526 patients with PH1 published by 
the OxalEurope Consortium indicated a median age of disease symptom onset of 3.9 years and a 
median age of diagnosis of 8.1 years.[ Mandrile 2014]  Overall, 43% of all patients diagnosed 
with PH1 had already progressed to ESRD at the time of diagnosis.  The deterioration of renal 
function highlights the importance of investigating potentially disease-modifying interventions 
as soon as possible after diagnosis.

Amendment 2, 04 May 2020  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  29 There are no approved therapies for the treatment of PH1 and the current standard of care is 
burdensome to patients and their families.  Disease management is based on supportive 
measures, including high fluid intake and crystallization inhibitors to increase urinary oxalate solubility, and treatment of disease complications such as urinary tract stones and infections.  A 
minority of patients experience oxalate lowering with therapeutic doses of pyridoxine (vitamin B6).  Dietary modification plays a minor role in treatment since  endogenous oxalate production 
far exceeds dietary intake.  Patients progressing to, or presenting with ESRD, require intense 
kidney dialysis.  Dialysis is not viewed as an effective therapy for PH1, but rather serves as a 
bridge to a liver-kidney transpla nt or as an alternative to no therapy at all.  Dialysis is often 
inadequate to effectively offload accumulating oxalate, and systemic oxalosis with end organ 
damage may develop despite this burdensome treatment.  Dialysis regimens for PH1 are more 
frequent than conventional dialysis, predisposing to increased risk of complications.  Combined liver-kidney transplantation offers potentially curative therapy, but is limited due to restricted 
availability, complications associated with the procedure, ethical co nsiderations in resource-poor 
settings[Cochat and Rumsby 2013], and intense use of health care resources.  
PH1 can progress to be a serious, severely debilitating disease with significant morbidity and 
mortality and negatively impacts quality of life.   Limited and burdensome management options 
for PH1 outlined above highlight the serious unmet need for a safe and efficacious treatment for 
patients with this devastating disease.  
1.2. Lumasiran  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Sponsor) is developing lumasiran (ALN- GO1), an 
investigational agent comprised of a synthetic, small inter fering RNA (siRNA) (drug substance 
ALN-65585) covalently linked to a triantennary N- acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligand, 
designed to target liver hydroxyacid oxidase 1 ( HAO1) mRNA, blocking production of glycolate 
oxidase (GO) and hence reducing hepatic oxalate production, which is the underlying cause of the morbidity and mortality associated with PH1.  
Lumasiran is currently in development for treatment of PH1 in adult and pediatric patients. 
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of lumasiran is 
provided in the current edition of the Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.2.1. Summary of Nonclinical Data with Lumasiran 
The pharmacology, safety pharmacology, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (PK), and 
toxicology of lumasiran were evaluated in a series of in vitro and in vivo nonclinical studies. 
Lumasiran was pharmacologically active in all tested species.  Subcutaneous (SC) administration 
of lumasiran demonstrated potent, dose-dependent pharmacologic activity resulting in reduced 
hepatic HAO1 mRNA levels with the expected increases in glycolate levels in wild -type and 
diseased animals and subsequent reductions in urinary oxalate in diseased animals. 
Genetic toxicity studies (bacterial reverse mutation, human peripheral blood lymphocyte 
chromosomal aberrations, and rat bone marrow micronucleus) assays were all negative at 
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) S2 (R1) limit doses. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1-004  lumasiran  
Amendment 2, 04 May 2020  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  30 The nonclinical toxicology program for lumasiran includes a repeat- dose explor atory toxicology 
study in rats, and a series of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) studies, which include 
developmental and reproductive studies in rats and rabbits, a pilot study in juvenile rats, and repeat-dose studies of up to 25- and 36-weeks in duration in rats and nonhuman primates, 
respectively.  To support inclusion of pediatric patients, the GLP repeat- dose rat studies were 
initiated with post-weaning animals that were 4 to 5 weeks old.  Additionally, a GLP- compliant 
pilot neonatal and juvenile rat toxicology study in the rat that was initiated in postnatal-day 4 
pups, and continued through postnatal-day 33, did not identify any evidence of potential 
developmental safety concerns due to either the toxicology or pharmacology of lumasiran. 
The results of these nonclinical toxicology studies demonstrate a favorable safety profile for 
lumasiran and supports the use of lumasiran in the planned pivotal clinical studies in pediatric (as 
young as full-term neonates) and adult patients with PH1. 
A summary of nonclinical studies is included in the current edition of the Investigator’s 
Brochure. 
1.2.2. Summary of Clinical Data with Lumasiran  
Lumasiran is being investigated in 3 clinical studies.  Study ALN- GO1-001 is a Phase 1/2 study, 
conducted in 2 parts (single- ascending dose [SAD; Part A] and multiple-ascending dose [MAD; 
Part B]), in healthy adult subjects and adult and pediatric patients (≥ 6 years old) with PH1.  The 
primary objective of Study ALN- GO1-001 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
subcutaneously-administered lumasiran.  Secondary and exploratory objectives include the 
characterization of plasma and urine PK and the evaluation of the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect, 
including glycolate and oxalate levels (Part B only).  In this study, healthy adult subjects in Part A were randomized to receive a single -blind dose of lumasiran (0.3-6.0 mg/kg) or placebo (6:2).  
In Part B, patients ≥6 years of age with PH1 and preserved renal function (eGFR >45 mL/min/1.73  m
2) were randomized 3:1 to receive single-blind doses of lumasiran or 
placebo at 1.0 mg/kg monthly for 3 doses, 3.0 mg/kg monthly for 3 doses, or 3.0 mg/kg every-3-
months for 2 doses.  Patients in Part B on placebo transitioned to the open-label portion of the 
study to receive lumasiran. 
Study ALN- GO1-002 is a Phase 2 open-label extension study to evaluate the long- term safety, 
PK, and PD of lumasiran in patients with PH1 who complete Study ALN- GO1-001. 
Study ALN- GO1-003 (ILLUMINATE -A) is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lumasiran in children and adults (≥6 years 
old) with a documented diagnosis of PH1, elevated urinary oxalate, and relatively preserved 
renal function (GFR >45 mL/min/1.73m2).  The study consists of a randomized, controlled, 
double-blinded primary analysis period of 6 months, followed by an extension phase for 54 months during which all patients are treated with lumasiran. 
Available safety data from clinical studies indicate that lumasiran has an acceptable safety and 
tolerability profile across all dosing regimens  with no drug- related serious adverse events (SAEs) 
or study discontinuations attributed to drug administration.  Urinary oxalate levels are an important measurement in patients with PH1.  Preliminary data fro m ALN-GO1-001 showed a 
mean maximal reduction in urinary oxalate of >60% in patients with PH1 in Part B of the study

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  31 and a durable suppression of urinary oxalate over time.  Reduction in urinary oxalate was evident 
at the first assessment time point at Day  29. 
Further information on the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of lumasiran is provided in the current edition of the Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.3. Study Design Rationale  
Lumasiran is proposed to reduce urinary oxalate production resulting in lower urinary oxalate 
excretion in patients with PH1.  In preclinical models and patients with PH1, SC administration 
of lumasiran demonstrated potent, dose-dependent pharmacologic activity resulting in substantial reductions in urinary oxalate.[ Liebow 2017]  
Urinary oxalate excretion is the most s ensitive and clinically relevant marker that directly relates 
to the PH1 disease pathophysiology in this population and is used clinically for diagnosis and management of patients with PH1 who have preserved renal function.  Elevated urinary oxalate 
is the direct cause of kidney stones and renal failure in patients with PH1.  Lowered urinary 
oxalate excretion is expected to provide clinical benefit in patients with preserved renal function 
by directly targeting the cause of the disease: toxic urinary oxalat e levels that lead to oxalate 
crystallization in the kidneys and urinary tract.  Reduced urinary oxalate excretion therefore is expected to reduce kidney stone burden and potentially stabilize renal function. 
This is a multicenter, multinational, open -label study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, 
PK, and PD of lumasiran in pediatric patients younger than 6 years old at consent with PH1 and 
relatively preserved renal function.  The primary endpoint for the study is percent change in urinary oxalate excretion from baseline to Month 6.  To evaluate the long- term safety and 
efficacy of lumasiran, all patients will continue to receive open -label lumasiran for up to 
54 months.  Patients will continue their current standard of care regimen, which may include hyperhydration, crystallization inhibitors, and/or pyridoxine therapy, until the Month 6 visit, 
after which they can adjust per the recommendations of their treating physician.  Current disease 
management options are presented in Section 1.1. 
Lumasiran  is currently being investigated in 3 clinical studies in children and adults (≥6 years of 
age) with PH1 and relatively  preserved renal function.  In this study, lumasiran will be evaluated 
in a similar but younger patient population (infants and young children <6 years of age).  
Enrolling infants and young pediatric patients in this study is acceptable given that lumasiran has 
been well tolerated in children ≥6 years of age, that PH1 presents as a pediatric disease with life-
threatening consequences, and there is a high unmet medical need in this population. 
1.4. Dose Rationale  
Preclinical data and clinical data from study ALN -GO1-001 Parts A and B in healthy subjects 
and in PH1 patients 6 years old and above were used to support PKPD modeling and dose selection for this study.  Population PKPD modeling in patients with PH1 demonstrated dose-dependent oxalate reductions over the dose range studied (1.0 to 6.0 mg/kg once monthly or once 
every 3 months SC administration).  The PKPD model indicated that monthly administration 
leads to a more rapid decline in urinary oxalate levels compared to every-3-months dosing.  A combination of monthly dosing in a loading phase and then dosing every 3 months in a 
maintenance phase achieves the goals of rapid and consistent lowering of urinary oxalate to 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1-004  lumasiran  
Amendment 2, 04 May 2020  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  32 normal or near normal levels in PH1 patients.  Thus, based on PKPD modeling and simulation, 
the proposed lumasiran dose for pediatric and adult PH1 patients ages 6 and above is as follows: 
3.0 mg/kg monthly x 3 doses (loading dose) followed by 3.0 mg/kg every-3-months (maintenance dose) starting 1 month after the last loading dose.  At steady state, this regimen is 
expected to achieve approximately 90% target suppression and reduce urinary oxalate to 0.44 
mMol/24h/body surface area (BSA) (see Table 6 ). 
For the current study (Study ALN- GO1-004), the goal of dose selection is to achieve similar 
reductions in hepatic oxalate production and similar lumasiran systemic exposure relative to PH1 patients 6 years old and above. 
 
The modeling and simulation approach in infants and children younger than 6 years old 
considered the changing rate of body weight and relative liver size in this young population.  The body weight of children nearly triples during the first year of life increasing from a median 
weight of 3.5 kg at birth to about 10 kg at 1 year of age (Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention [CDC] Growth Chart [ Kuczmarski 2002]).  Subsequently, the annual rate of body 
weight gain decreases to about 20% per year up to 6 years of age.  Furthermore, published 
reports and data from the United States National Centers for Health Statistics indicate children 
have proportionally larger liver size relative to body weight compared to adults. [ Johnson 2005; 
National Centers for Health Statistics 2018 ] For an individual in the 0 to 1 year, 1 to 6 years, and 
6 years old age categories, the mean liver weight as a percentage of body weight were 3.5%, 2.9%, and 2.0%, respectively, indicating that younger children are expected to have lower hepatocyte drug concentrations at a given dose level.  Moreover, based on allometric principles, 
children have faster drug clearance and drug clearance decreases with increasing weight.  Thus, 
considering the rapid g rowth rate, higher relative liver size, and faster drug clearance, children 
require a higher mg/kg dose to achieve similar systemic concentration and target suppression.  It 
should be noted that mg/kg dosing leads to a smaller absolute dose in children due to their lower 
body weight. 
Body weight categories for dose selection in this study were determined using CDC growth chart 
data.  For infants from birth to 1 year of age, the corresponding median weight ranges are 3.5 to 
10 kg, respectively.  For children ages 1 to 6 years old, the corresponding median weight ranges are 10 to 20 kg.  For children 6 years old and above, the median weight is 20 kg and above. 
Based on PKPD modeling and simulation, for children weighing less than 10 kg, corresponding 
to children from birth up to 1 year old, the proposed regimen is 6.0 mg/kg monthly x 3 doses (loading) followed by 3.0 mg/kg monthly (maintenance).  For children weighing ≥10 to 20 kg, 
which represent children ages 1 to 6 years old, the proposed regimen is 6.0 mg/kg monthly x 3 
doses (loading) followed by 6.0 mg/kg every-3-months (maintenance).  The proposed regimens in children birth to 6 years old are expected to result in target suppression of approximately 87 to 90% and median urinary oxalate levels 0.41 to 0.47 mMol/24h/BSA (see Table 6).

1.5. Benefit-Risk Assessment  
PH1 is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by excessive oxalate production by the 
liver leading to excessive urinary oxalate and varying types and degrees of renal disease, 
progressing to end- stage renal disease.  Systemic accumulation of calcium oxalate results in 
severe end -organ damage.  Without treatment, the disease progresses, and patients die from end-
stage renal disease and/or complication of oxalosis. 
Lumasiran is designed to reduce hepatic production of oxalate.  Based on the available data from 
nonclinical studies and the Phase 1/2 clinical study ALN- GO1-001, lumasiran, administered 
subcutaneously, demonstrated a potent, dose-dependent inhibition of glycolate oxidase resulting 
in decreased urin ary oxalate and increased plasma and urinary glycolate.  Unlike oxalate, 
glycolate is highly soluble and readily excreted in the urine.  Thus, by reducing the production of 
oxalate, lumasiran is expected to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of PH1 and alte r the clinical 
course in patients across the spectrum of disease, irrespective of age and disease stage.  
Based on the available safety data from the Phase 1/2 clinical study, lumasiran has been well tolerated with a favorable safety profile.  Most adverse events (AEs) have been mild or moderate 
in severity.  There have been no severe or serious adverse events related to study drug.  
Transient, mild injection site reactions (ISRs) have been observed but have not resulted in any treatment discontinuations or dose adjustments.  No clinically significant laboratory or hematologic changes have been observed. 
Given the biological target of lumasiran, the available nonclinical and clinical data, and mode of 
administration, important potential risks for lumasiran are injection site reactions and liver 
function test abnormalities.  During the study, patients will be closely monitored, including 
evaluation of injection sites, laboratory monitoring for liver function test abnormalities, along with other standard hematology and blood chemistries.  The study has specific inclusion and 
exclusion criteria to ensure that patients have adequate hepatic function and specific rules for 
dose withholding and stopping have been incorporated in the protocol for abnormalities in live r 
function tests.  As the risk of embryofetal toxicity is currently unknown, females who achieve

3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Summary of Study Design  
This is a multicenter, multinational, open-label study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, 
PK, and PD of lumasiran in pediatric patients with PH1 who are younger than 6 years old and 
have relatively preserved renal function.  All eligible patients will be administered open -label 
lumasiran; no control group will be assessed. 
Patients will be screened from Day -60 to Day -1 to determine eligibility.  Consented patients 
meeting eligibility criteria will receive their first dose of subcutaneously administered lumasiran 
on Day 1.  Lumasiran will be administered SC utilizing weight- based dosing, with dose 
adjustments for interval weight gain, as specified in Section 5.2.2. 
Patients will return to the clinical center for follow -up assessment of efficacy, safety, tolerability, 
PK, PD, and patient and caregiver experience and burden according to the schedule of 
assessments through the last study visit.  Safety assessments will include collection of AEs, 
clinical laboratory tests, vital sign assessments, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical 
examinations, and concomitant medications. 
For all patients, single -void urine samples (in triplicate) will be collected during screening to 
establish baseline and then serially per the Schedules of Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, 
Table 3, and Table 4).  
For patients able to provide 24-hour urine samples, three 24-hour urine collections will be 
scheduled during screening to establish baseline urinary oxalate levels.  At Month 6, three 24-
hour urine collections will be scheduled within 14 days prior to the Month 6 dose for patients who are able to provide 24-hour urine samples.  For patients unable to provide 24-hour urine samples, a single catheterized collection may be requested.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1-004  lumasiran  
Amendment 2, 04 May 2020  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  36 This study will consist of 2 periods: a 6 -month primary analysis period followed by a long- term 
extension period.  During the 6-month primary analysis period, patients will undergo efficacy 
and safety assessments every 2 weeks for the first month and monthly thereafter.  During the long-term extension period of up to 54 months, dosing will continue and visits will occur at least 
every-3-months.   
Patients who discontinue study drug early will be asked to return for follow-up visits (see Section 4.3.1). 
3.2. Duration of Treatment  
The duration of treatment with lumasiran is up to 60 months. 
3.3. Duration of Study  
The estimated total time on study, inclusive of screening, for each patient is up to 62 months, including up to 2 months of screening followed by up to 60 months of treatment, with a month defined as 28 days. 
3.3.1. Definition of End of Study for an Individual Patient  
A patient is considered to have reached the end of the study if: 
• the patient has completed the end of study (EOS; Month 60) visit, or 
• the patient has completed the safety follow -up visits until PD recovery of urinary 
oxalate is >70% of baseline, and plasma glycolate is <30% above baseline or ≤ the 
ULN, or, 
• the patient has completed 1 2 months of monitoring following the final lumasiran dose 
3.4. Number of Planned Patients  
The planned enrollment for this study is 20 patients including at least 1 patient <12 months of age with weight <10 kg at consent.  Patients who discontinue study drug or stop participation in 
the study prior to Month 6 may be replaced (see Section 4.3.4), and the analysis of data 
collection prior to discontinuation is addressed in the statistical analysis plan . 
3.5. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups 
Patients will not be assigned to treatment groups.  Dosing will be determined by the patient’s weight (see Section  5.2.2). 
Each patient will be uniquely identified in the study by a combination of the site number and patient identification number .  Upon signing the informed consent form (ICF), the patient will be 
assigned a patient identification number by the interactive response system (IRS). 
3.6. Blinding 
While this is an open-label study, pharmacodynamic assessment data will not be distributed to the sites until after the patient has completed the Month 6 visit.  Site personnel should refrain from obtaining or viewing local oxalate or glycolate assessments, except as medically indicated.

4.3. Removal from Study Drug or Assessment  
Patients or their legal guardians are free to discontinue study drug and/or stop protocol 
procedural assessments, or participation in the study as a whole at any time and for any reason, without penalty to their continuing medical care.  The Investigator or the Sponsor may discontinue study drug or stop a patient’s participation in the study at any time if this is 
considered to be in the patient’s best interest.  Any discontinuation of treatment or the stopping 
of the patient’s participation in the study must be fully documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF) and should be followed up by the Investigator. 
Discontinuation of study drug or declining procedural assessments is described in Section 4.3.1, 
while the stopping of a patient’s participation in the study is detailed in Section  4.3.2. 
4.3.1. Discontinuation of Study Drug or Declining Procedural Assessments  
Reasons for discontinuation of study drug include any of the following: 
• Significant violation of the protocol 
• AE 
• Non-adherence to treatment regimen  
• Pregnancy  
• Lost to follow-up 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1-004  lumasiran  
Amendment 2, 04 May 2020  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  39 • Other reason (non- AE) 
• Or, study is terminated by the Sponsor 
Patients who are pregnant will be discontinued from study drug dosing immediately (see 
Section 6.5.6.7 for reporting and follow-up of pregnancy).  A positive urine pregnancy test 
should be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test prior to discontinuing the study drug. 
Patients who discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments should not be 
automatically removed from study.  In general, patients who discontinue study drug dosing for 
any reason will be encouraged to remain on the study to complete the remaining assessments so 
that their experience is captured in the final analyses.  
If this occurs, the Investigator is to discuss with the patient the appropriate processes for 
discontinuation from study drug and must discuss with the patient the options for continuation of 
the Schedules o f Assessments (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4), including different 
options for follow-up and collection of data (eg, in person, by phone, by mail, through family or 
friends, or from options not involving patient contact, such as communi cation with other treating 
physicians or from review of medical records), including endpoints and AEs, and must document 
this decision in the patient’s medical records.  
If a patient discontinues dosing due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be foll owed as 
described in Section  6.5.6.  When a patient discontinues study drug dosing, the primary reason 
must be recorded in the electronic case repor t form (eCRF).  Patients who discontinue study drug 
and remain on study may receive treatment consistent with local standard practice for their disease per Investigator judgement, as applicable. 
Patients who discontinue from study drug during the 6-month treatment period (defined as the 
time the first dose of study drug is administered on Study Day 1 through completion of the 
Month 6 assessments) will be encouraged to remain on the study and complete assessments (including 24-hour urine collections, but excluding PK assessments) through Month 6 (see 
Table 1).  They will also be asked to complete safety follow-up visits, once every 3 months, per 
the safety  follow-up schedule (see Table 3 or Table 4) fo r up to 12 months after the last dose of 
lumasiran, or until PD recovery (whichever is earlier).
 
Patients who discontinue study drug after Month 6 will be asked to return for their next scheduled visit to complete early termination (ET) assessments and com plete safety follow -up 
visits, once every 3 months, per the safety follow- up schedule (see Table 3 or Table 4) for up to 
12 months after the last dose of lumasiran, or until PD recovery (whichever is earlier). 
PD recovery is defined as urinary oxalate >70% of baseline, and plasma glycolate <30% above 
baseline or ≤ the ULN (see Section 3.3.1).  
4.3.2. Stopping a Patient’s Study Participation  
4.3.2.1. Patient or Legal Guardian Stops Participation in the Study  
A patient or their legal guardian may stop participation in the study at any time.  A patient or legal guardian considering stopping participation in the study should be informed that the patient can discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and remain in the study to 
complete their study assessments, through the Month 6 visit, including follow-up, or 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1-004  lumasiran  
Amendment 2, 04 May 2020  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  40 alternatively may complete any minimal assessments for which the patient or legal guardian 
consents as described in Section 4.3.1.  If a patient or legal guardian still chooses to discontinue 
study drug and stop participation in all follow-up prior to the completion of the 6-month treatment period, every effort should be made to conduct early the assessments scheduled to be performed at the Month 6 visit (see Table 1).  
If the patient does not wish to or is unable to continue further study participation, the Investigator is to discuss with the patient appropriate procedures for stopping participation in the study.  Data collected from the patien t can continue to be used. 
In addition, in the countries where the collection and processing of the patient data is based on the patient consent, if a patient withdraws consent to collect and process his/her data (see 
Section 4.3.2.2), as applicable, patient data up to the withdrawal of consent will be included in 
the analysis of the study.  In addition, where permitted, publicly available data (such a s 
appropriate national or regional vital status registry or other relevant databases) can be included 
after withdrawal of consent, where available and allowable by local law.  
4.3.2.2. Withdrawal of Consent to Process the Patient’s Personal Data 
Where allowed by local law, the patient may decide to withdraw consent to collect, store, and 
use biological samples and, as applicable, other personal data, informing the study doctor at any 
time in writing or in any other form that may be locally required.  The Sponsor w ill continue to 
keep and use the patient’s study information (including any data resulting from the analysis of 
the patient’s biological samples until the time of withdrawal) according to applicable law.  The 
process for the storage and, as applicable, fur ther use of remaining samples will be followed per 
local requirements.  
4.3.2.3. Investigator or Sponsor Stops Participation of a Patient in the Study 
The Investigator or Sponsor may stop the participation of a patient in the study at any time if this is considered to be in the patient’s best interest.  However, study integrity and interpretation are 
best maintained if all enrolled patients continue study assessments and follow-up even if study drug is discontinued. 
Termination of the clinical study and site closure are described in Section  8.1.6. 
4.3.2.4. Recording Reason for Stopping a Patient’s Study Participation 
The primary reason that a patient’s study participation is stopped must be recorded in the 
appropriate section of the electronic case report form (eCRF) and all efforts will be made to 
complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible.  If a p atient’s study participation 
is stopped due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in 
Section 6.5.6. 
4.3.3. Lost to Follow- Up 
A patient will be considered lost to follow -up if the patient repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the clinical study center.  The following actions must be taken if a patient misses a required study visit:  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1-004  lumasiran  
Amendment 2, 04 May 2020  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  41 • The site must attempt to contact the patient or legal guardian and reschedule the 
missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the patient or legal guardian on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the patient or 
legal guar dian wishes [for the patient] to continue in the study, and/or should continue 
in the study. 
• Before a patient is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact with the patient or legal guardian (where possible, 3 
telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing 
address or local equivalent methods).  These contact attempts should be documented in the patient’s medical record.  
• Should the patient or legal guardian continue to be unreachable, the patient will be considered to have stopped participation in the study. 
• For patients who are lost to follow-up, the Investigator can search publicly available 
records (where permitted and allowed by local law) to ascertain survival status.  This 
ensures that the outcome of the study is as comprehensive as possible. 
4.3.4. Replacement of Study Patients  
Patients who discontinue the study drug or stop participation in the study prior to Month 6 may 
be replaced at the Sponsor’s discretion, and the analysis of data collection prior to 
discontinuation is addressed in the statistical analysis plan .  Patients who discontinue the study 
drug or stop participation in the study after Month 6 will not be replaced.  
5. TREATMENTS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS  
5.1. Treatments Administered  
Study drug supplied for this study must not be used for any purpose other than the present study 
and must not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study.  Study drug that has been 
dispensed and returned unused must not be re-dispensed. 
5.2. Study Drug  
Detailed information describing the preparation, administration, and storage of lumasiran is provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
5.2.1. Description  
Lumasiran will be supplied as a sterile solution in water for SC injection.  See the Pharmacy 
Manual for further details of solution concentration and fill volume. 
5.2.2. Dose and Administration 
Patients will be administered lumasiran as an SC injection at the dose and regimen based on their 
weight category as described in Table 7.  Patients will receive 3 loading doses, once monthly (at 
Day 1, Month 1, and Month 2) at a dose based on body weight category.  At Month 3 and beyond, patients will receive lumasiran either monthly (patients weighing <10 kg) or every 3 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1-004  lumasiran  
Amendment 2, 04 May 2020  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  42 months (patients weighing ≥10 kg) at the maintenance dose.  For patients who are on a monthly 
dosing regimen, study drug administration must be at least 21 days apart. 
Study drug injections will be administered under the supervision of the Investigator.  The site of 
injection may be the abdomen, the upper arms or thighs.  If a local reaction around the injection 
site occurs, photographs may be obtained.  Detailed instructions for study drug administration 
are found in the Pharmacy Manual. 
Dosing will be permitted at a location other than the study center (for example, the patient’s 
home) by a healthcare professional with the oversight of the I nvestigator at all time points, 
provided the patient has tolerated at least 1 dose of lumasiran administered in the clinic.  
However, continued study drug administration at the study center should be considered for 
patients who have ongoing study drug- related AEs, worsening injection site reactions with repeat 
dosing, or for anyone in the opinion of the Investigator who would benefit from clinical 
observation following dosing. 
If the patient is unable to come to the study site, and a visit by a healthcare professional is not 
possible due to circumstances related to the COVID -19 pandemic, lumasiran may be 
administered by the caregiver under the oversight of the Investigator, and following consultation 
with the Medical Monitor, as allowed by applicable country and local regulations.  In such cases, 
the caregiver must receive appropriate training on lumasiran administration prior to dosing.  This measure is intended to remain in effect only during periods of time when the COVID-19 
pandemic impedes the ability  of patients to travel to the study site and  healthcare professionals to 
go to patients' homes for dosing.   
Table 7: Weight-based Dosing Regimen 
Weight Loading Dose 
(Day 1, Month 1, Month 2) Maintenance Dose  
(Month 3 and Beyond)  
<10 kg 6.0 mg/kg monthly for 3 
months 3.0 mg/kg monthly  
≥10 to <20 kg  6.0 mg/kg monthly for 3 months 6.0 mg/kg every 3 months  
≥20 kg 3.0 mg/kg monthly for 3 months 3.0 mg/kg every 3 months  
For patients who weigh <20 kg, the dose will be based on a weight obtained within 7 days prior 
to dosing.  During periods of time when the COVID-19 pandemic impedes the ability of these 
patients to travel to the study site or healthcare professionals to go to patients' homes, a weight from up to 6 weeks prior to the planned monthly dose or up to 4 months prior to the planned quarterly dose may be used to calculate the amount of lumasiran to be administered. 
For patients who weigh ≥20 kg, the dose may be based on a weight obtained up to 4 months prior 
to the planned quarte rly dose. 
Patients with weight increases crossing the threshold for the next weight-based dosing category (<10 kg to ≥10 kg or <20 kg to ≥20 kg) will follow the new dosing regimen for the remainder of the study or until the next dosing category threshold i s reached (ie, patients will not switch back 
to the lower-weight dosing schedule if their body weight subsequently decreases). 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1-004  lumasiran  
Amendment 2, 04 May 2020  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  43 Patients in maintenance dosing who transition from <10 kg to ≥10 kg will continue to receive 
monthly doses at 3.0 mg/kg until the next visit that coincides with Table 4, whereby they will  
follow every-3-months dosing as per Table 4 until the end of the study. 
If a patient does not receive a dose of lumasiran within the specified dosing window, the 
Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor.  After such consultation, the dose may be 
administered or considered missed and not administered. 
If a patient misses multiple consecutive doses, the Investigator, in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor, will discuss whether the patient will be able to continue the study (see Section 4.3).  
Patients whose disease progresses to requiring a dialysis regimen will continue on their planned dosing regimen prior to starting dialysis therapy.  The lumasiran dose will be administered as 
soon as feasible following the end of dialysis, eg, within 2 hours of completing the dialysis 
session.  If a patient does not receive a dose of lumasiran within the specified dosing window, the Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor.  After such consultation, the dose may be 
administered or considered missed and not administered. 
Additional details can be found in the Pharmacy Manual.  In addition, instructions and 
procedures related to administration of lumasiran by a caregiver will be provided in the 
Patient/Caregiver Storage and Administration Instructions.  
5.2.3. Dose Modifications 
Dose modifications are not permitted.  
If a study drug- related AE occurs in a patient that the Investigator judg es as presenting a 
potential risk to the patient for further dosing, the study drug dose may be held at the discretion of the Investigator and the Medical Monitor should be contacted. 
5.2.3.1. Liver Function Test Criteria for Withholding, Monitoring and Stopping 
Lumasiran Dosing  
1. For patients who weigh <20 kg, l iver function test (LFT) results (see Table 10) are to be 
obtained within 7 days prior to dosing and results are to be reviewed prior to each dose of 
lumasiran.  During periods of time when the COVID-19 pandemic impedes the ability of patients to travel to the study site or healthcare professionals to go to patients' homes and 
LFT assessments are not feasible within 7 days prior to the dose, LFT test results up to 
6 weeks prior to the planned monthly dose or up to 4 months prior to the planned 
quarterly dose may be reviewed to determine whether the dose can be administered.  
For patients who weigh ≥20 kg, LFT results may  be reviewed  up to 4 months prior to the 
planned quarterly dose to determine whether the dose can be administered.  
2. Consult the Laboratory Manual for the blood draw priority list based on patient weight.  
Central laboratory results a re preferable.  If not available, local laboratory results may be 
used; however, if a local assessment is drawn, a serum chemistry sample must also be 
drawn for analysis at the central laboratory . 
3. For any ALT or AST elevation >3× ULN, central laboratory results should be used to 
guide subsequent monitoring as detailed in Table 8. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1-004  lumasiran  
Amendment 2, 04 May 2020  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  44 4. For any ALT or AST elevation > 3× ULN:  
a. If local laboratory results are obtained, confirm using central laboratory, as soon as 
possible, ideally within 2 to 3 days, but no later than 7 days. 
b. If an alternative cause is found, provide appropriate care. 
c. If an alternative cause is not found, perform assessments per  Table 8 and Table 11. 
5. For any ALT or AST elevation > 3× ULN without alternative cause  that is accompanied 
by clinical symptoms consistent with liver injury (eg, nausea, right upper quadrant 
abdominal pain, jaundice) or elevated bilirubin to ≥2× ULN or international normalized ratio (INR) ≥1.5, permanently discontinue dosing. 
6. For confirmed ALT or AST elevations >3× ULN without alternative cause  and not 
accompanied by symptoms or elevated bilirubin ≥2× ULN or INR ≥1.5, see Table 8:

5.2.4. Preparation, Handling, and Storage 
Staff at each clinical study center  and the healthcare professional will be responsible for 
preparation of lumasiran doses, according to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy Manual.  In 
cases where lumasiran is administered at home by a caregiver, dosing may be prepared and 
administered by the caregiver according to procedures detailed in t he Patient/Caregiver Storage 
and Administration Instructions.  No special procedures for the safe handling of study drug are required. 
Study drug will be stored upright and refrigerated at approximately [5±3°C].

Further instructions about drug accountability will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. 
5.3. Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
Use of concomitant medications and procedures will be recorded on the patient’s CRF as 
specified in the Schedules of Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4).  This 
includes all prescription medications, vaccines, herbal preparations, over the counter 
medications, vitamins, and minerals.  Any changes in medications during the study must be 
recorded on the CRF. Patients should not start new medication regimens during the study, including regimens of vitamins or herbal medication, without consultation with the Investigator.  
If patients use nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs intermittently or chronically, they must have 
been able to tolerate them with no previous side effects (eg, gastric distress or bleeding). 
Standard vitamins and topical medications are permitted.  However, topical steroids must not be 
applied anywhere near the inj ection site(s) unless medically indicated.  
If taking pyridoxine (vitamin B6) for the treatment of PH1, patients must have been on a stable regimen for at least 90 days before screening and remain on this stable regimen during the 
screening period and through at least the Month 6 visit.  Dose adjustments for interval weight 
gain are permitted.  Patients should avoid high dose vitamin C preparations within 4 days prior to oxalate assessments.  
Patients may be treated for PH1 according to local standard of care.  Patients should continue their current standard of care regimen, including hyperhydration, crystallization inhibitors, and/or pyridoxine therapy at least until the Month 6 visit.  Standard of care treatment may be 
adjusted after Month 6 in accordance wi th clinical judgement.  If pyridoxine therapy is 
discontinued, pyridoxine levels should be assessed for at least the next 2 timepoints indicated in 
the Schedules of Assessment.  Consultation with the Medical Monitor is required if treated with any new emer ging products.

Amendment 2, 04 May 2020  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  47 For other permitted concomitant medications administered subcutaneously, do not administer in 
same injection site area as the study drug, for at least 7 days after the last dose of study drug. 
Any concomitant medication that is required for the patient’s welfare may be administered by the 
Investigator.  However, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details regarding 
the medication are recorded on the CRF.  Concomitant medication will be coded using an 
internationally recognized and accepted coding dictionary. 
5.4. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with study drug administration will be verified by study staff. 
5.5. Other Requirements  
5.5.1. Contraception  
Females who experience menarche during the course of the study should be asked to commit to 
true sexual abstinence for the remainder of their study participation and for 90 days after last 
dose administration.  If a patient instead prefers to initiate contraception, the Investigator must approve the selected method. 
Birth control methods which are considered highly effective include: 
• Placement of an intrauterine device.  
• Placement of an intrauterine hormone- releasing system.  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion.  
• Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post- vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the 
study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient). 
• Established use of oral (except low-dose gestagens), implantable, injectable, or 
transderm al hormonal methods of contraception.  
• True sexual abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
patient.  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable metho ds of contraception.  Abstinent 
patients must agree to use one of the above-mentioned contraceptive methods, if they start heterosexual relationships during the study and for up to 90 days after the last dose of study drug. 
Investigators should advise females of childbearing potential of the most appropriate birth control method available within their country taking into account local medical practice. 
For male patients, no contraception is required.  However, use by adolescent males of 
contraception (condom) may be required in some countries, eg, France, in order to comply with 
local requirements as described in the corresponding patient informed consent forms. 
The Investigator will ensure that adolescent patients, and their legal representatives if applica ble, 
are adequately informed about contraceptive requirements and the need for contraception once a 
patient initiates heterosexual intercourse.  The need for contraception and compliance with 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1-004  lumasiran  
Amendment 2, 04 May 2020  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  48 contraception requirements will be assessed at every visit for adolescent patients, and pregnancy 
testing will be performed before every dose for postmenarcheal females throughout the course of 
the study (see Section  6.5.5.2).  
5.5.2. Dietary Restrictions  
Patients should refrain from consumption of foods with high oxalate content, including, but not 
limited to, chocolate, rhubarb, spinach, and beet root, for 1 week prior to assessments of urinary 
and plasma oxalate.  
6. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
The schedules of study assessments are provided in Table 1, Table 2, Table  3, and Table 4.  
Additional information on the collection of study assessments will be detailed in the Study Manual. 
Where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow for home healthcare, 
healthcare may take place at a location other than the clinical trial site to perform study 
assessments, which may include collection of blood and urine samples, m easurement of vital 
signs, length/height and weight, abbreviated physical exam ination/body system assessment, and 
preparation and administration of study drug (at the discretion of the Investigator). 
6.1. Screening Assessments  
An informed consent form (ICF) that has been approved by the appropriate Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) must be signed by the legal guardian (with patient assent, as applicable) before the Screening procedures are initiated.  All legal guardians will be given a copy of the signed and dated ICF and assent form, as applicable. 
Patients will be screened to ensure that they meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.  Rescreening of patients is permitted with consultation of the Medical Monitor (see Section  6.1.2). 
Patient demographic data and medical history/disease history will be obtained.  Non-serious events occurring after si gning of the ICF and prior to study drug administration will be captured 
as medical history.  Any changes to medical history occurring between the screening assessment and Day 1 will be updated prior to study drug administration. 
A blood sample for AGXT  mutation analysis will be collected during screening for patients who 
do not have documented PH1 genetic analysis to confirm eligibility. 
If serum creatinine and liver function laboratory assessments are collected greater than 30 days 
prior to Day 1, repeat the assessment and review results prior to initial dosing.  
For all patients, single -void urine samples (in triplicate) will be collected during screening to 
establish baseline.  In addition, for patients able to provide 24-hour urine samples, three 24-hou r 
urine collections will be scheduled during screening to establish baseline urinary oxalate levels.  
24-hour urine collections are the preferred method of evaluating urinary oxalate levels and 
patients are strongly encouraged to complete these collections during supervised visits unless their legal guardians are already familiar with the collection procedures.  For patients unable to 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1-004  lumasiran  
Amendment 2, 04 May 2020  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  49 provide 24-hour urine samples, a single catheterized collection will be obtained, when allowed, 
during screening. 
6.1.1. Retesting  
If in the Investigator’s judgement, the screening laboratory abnormalities are likely to be 
transient, then laboratory tests, excluding urinary oxalate, may be repeated.  The Investigator’s 
rationale should be documented.  Laboratory values can be retested once during Screening 
provided that the patient can be evaluated for eligibility and randomized within the allowed Screening period. 
6.1.2. Rescreening  
A patient who does not meet all study eligibility criteria due to a transient condition observed at 
Screening  (eg, prohibited medications that were subsequently discontinued) may be allowed to 
return for rescreening after consultation with the Medical Monitor.  The legal guardian will be 
re-consented, and assent obtained (if applicable) if rescreening occurs outside of the 60- day 
screening window.  In this case, all screening procedures must be repeated. 
6.2. Efficacy Assessments 
24-hour urine collections are the preferred method of evaluating urinary oxalate levels.  Since 
not all patients will be able to provide 24-hour urine samples, single-void urine samples (in 
triplicate) will be collected throughout the study in all patients .  Table 9 shows the 24-hour urine 
collection procedure by study visit. 
In children who are able to comply with 24-hour urine collection procedures, uri nary oxalate 
excretion will be determined from 24- hour urine sample collections to be completed at the time 
points specified in the Schedules of Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4 ).  
Urinary oxalate concentrations will be analyzed centrally using a validated assay .  Non-
catheterized 24-hour urine collections must meet pre -specified validity criteria (see 
Section 6.2.1.1).  The duration of collection and volume of urine in the collection will be 
recorded in the eCRF.  
For patients who are able to comply with the 24-hour urine collection procedure, three 24-hour 
urine collections will be scheduled during screening to establish baseline urinary oxalate excretion.  For Month 6, three 24-hour urine collections will be scheduled within 14 days prior to 
the Month 6 dose to evaluate changes in oxalate concentrations over the first 6-month interval.  
A single 24-hour collection will be scheduled at Month 12 and then every 6 months thereafter. 
Patients able to comply with 24 -hour urine collections will either bring a 24 -hour urine collection 
to the clinic, courier samples to the laboratory, or have their 24-hour urine collected during an 
inpatient stay at the time of the study visit.  
For patients who are unable to comply with 24-hour urine collections, a single catheterized 
24-hour collection will be obtained, when allowed, at both baseline and Month 6.  Catheterized 
collections may be performed at the discretion of the Investigator and with the consent of the legal guardian.  Catheterized collections will be considered complete if there is no documented urine loss during the collection. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1-004  lumasiran

6.2.1.1. Validity Criteria for  Non-catheterized  24-hour Urine Collections  
A urine collection will be considered valid if each of the following criteria are met: 
• The collection is between 18-26 hours in duration between the initial discarded void 
and the last void or attempt to void. 
• No voids are missed between the start and end time of the collection.  
• The 24-hour creatinine content is at least 5 mg/kg as assessed by the study central lab. 
6.3. Pharmacodynamic and Renal Assessments  
Urine and blood samples will be collected for assessment of PD parameters (plasma and urinary 
oxalate and  glycolate concentrations) and renal parameters at the time points specified in the 
Schedules of Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4 ).  All blood and urine 
samples will be collected prior to dosing, if applicable.  Optional collections may be performed 
at the discretion of the Investigator. 
All PD assessments will be analyzed centrally.  Pharmacodynamic assessment data will not be 
distributed to the sites until after the patient has completed the Month 6 vis it.  Site personnel 
should refrain from obtaining or viewing local oxalate or glycolate assessments, except as 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1-004  lumasiran  
Amendment 2, 04 May 2020  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  51 medically indicated.  Details regarding the processing and aliquoting of samples for storage and 
analyses will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
Where local regulations allow, and infrastructure is in place, home nursing may be used to collect urine and blood samples. 
6.3.1. Urinary Oxalate:Creatinine Ratio 
Urine oxalate:creatinine ratios will be calculated from the oxalate and creatinine levels measured 
in the 24-hour urine collections to assess the PD effect of lumasiran on urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio.  Urinary oxalate:creatinine ratios from single -void urine collections will also be measured. 
6.3.2. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate  
Blood samples f or the assessment of eGFR will be obtained at the time points specified in the 
Schedules of Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4 ).  eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m
2) 
will be calculated in patients ≥12 months of age at the time of the assessment to evaluate renal 
function during the study.  The calculation will be based on the Schwartz Bedside Formula 
(Appendix 10.1). [Levey 2009; Schwartz 2009]   
6.3.3. Renal Stone Events  
A renal stone event is defined as an event which includes at least one of the following: 
• Visit to healthcare p rovider (eg, outpatient clinic, urgent care, emergency department, 
procedure) because of a renal stone 
• Medication for renal colic 
• Stone passage 
• Macroscopic hematuria due to a renal stone  
All relevant clinical information pertaining to the event should be obtained, including laboratory values, medical records, discharge summaries, and medical test results.   
Since renal stone events are recorded as an efficacy assessment for lumasiran, these will not be treated as AEs or SAEs.  However, if a patient experienc es other AEs or SAEs during a renal 
stone event, they should be reported (see Section 6.5.6.1). 
6.3.4. Renal Ultrasound 
Renal ultrasounds will be obtained locally, at the timepoints  specified in the Schedules of 
Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table  4).  During periods of time when the 
COVID-19 pandemic impedes the ability of patients to travel to the study site,  renal ultrasounds 
may be completed up to 3 months after the intended timepoint for assessments scheduled prior to Month 12, and up to 9 months after the intended timepoint for visits at Month 12 and later .  
Renal ultrasound will be performed according to instructions provided in the Study Manual in a standardized manner.  Renal ultrasounds will be reviewed centrally.

Amendment 2, 04 May 2020  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  52 6.4. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples will be collected for assessment of lumasiran PK pa rameters and possible 
metabolite analysis (as necessary) at the time points in the Schedules of Assessment (see Table 1, 
Table 2, Table 3, and Table  4). 
Plasma PK parameters, maximum plasma concentration (C max), time to maximum plasma 
concentration (t max), elimination half -life (t½β), area under the concentration- time curve (AUC), 
apparent clearance (CL/F), and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) , will be calculated for the 
lumasiran plasma concentration profiles.  A detailed schedule of time points for the collection of 
blood samples for PK analysis is in Ta ble 5.  In addition, if an SAE occurs associated with 
dosing, an additional PK sample may be collected at 4 to 8 hours postdose on the day of dosing, where blood volume permits (see Section 6.5.5.4).  
Lumasiran plasma concentrations will be determined using a validated assay.  Details regarding 
sample volumes to be collected, and the processing, shipping, and analysis of the samples will be 
provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
6.5. Safety Assessments  
The assessment of safety during the study will consist of the surveillance and recording of AEs, 
including SAEs, recording of concomitant medication and measurements of vital signs, weight 
and height/length, ECG findings, and laboratory tests.  Clinically significant abnormalities observed during the physical examination will be recorded.  
6.5.1. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured as specified in the Schedules of Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, 
Table 3, and Table 4) and include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory 
rate.  On dosing days, vital signs will be measured predose.  On Day 1 only, vital signs will also 
be measured 30  ± 10 minutes postdose.  When vital signs and blood sample collection occur at 
the same time, vital signs should be performed before blood samples are drawn, where possible. 
Vital signs should be measured after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes, when 
feasible.  Blood pressure should be taken using the same limb, when feasible.  Body temperature 
in degrees Celsius will be obtained via oral, tympanic, or axillary methods.  Heart rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in beats per minute, and respiration rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in breaths per minute. 
Additional vital sign assessments, as medically indicated, may be added at the discretion of the 
Investigator, or as per DMC advice.  
Vital signs results will be recorded in the eCRF.  
6.5.2. Weight and Height/Length  
Height/length will be measured in centimeters.  Standing height should be captured for patients ≥24 months old who are able to stand independently.  Supine length should be captured for 
patients <24 months old or those unable to stand independently.  All height/length measurements 
should be performed in triplicate.  Body weight will be measured in kilograms.  Height and body 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1-004  lumasiran  
Amendment 2, 04 May 2020  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  53 weight measurements will be collected as specified in the Schedules of Assessment (see Table 1, 
Table 2, Table 3, and Table  4) and in Section 5.2.2; measurements will be recorded in the eCRF.  
6.5.3. Physical Examination 
Full and abbreviated physical examinations will be conducted according to the Schedules of 
Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table  4).  If a physical examination is scheduled 
for a dosing visit, it should be conducted prior to dosing.  Full physical examinations will include the examination of the following:  general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and dermatological systems; thyroid; lymph nodes; and neurological status. 
Abbreviated physical examinations (body system assessment) will include examination of at 
least the following:  respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatological, gastrointestinal, and 
musculoskeletal systems.  
If a visit is conducted offsite (eg, at the patient’s home), a body system assessment may  be 
performed in lieu of a physical examination. 
Clinically significant abnormalities observed during the physical examination are recorded on 
the medical history or A E eCRF as appropriate.  
6.5.4. Electrocardiogram  
Single 12-lead ECGs will be obtained predose, when applicable, at the timepoints  specified in 
the Schedules of Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4).  During periods of 
time when the COVID -19 pandemic impedes the ability of patients to travel to the study site,  
ECG assessments may be completed up to 3 months after the intended timepoint for assessments 
scheduled prior to Month 12, and up to 9 months after the intended timepoint for visits at Month 
12 and later .  12-lead ECGs will be locally read.    
When ECG and blood sample collection occur at the same time, ECGs should be performed before blood samples are drawn and when the patient is calm. 
The Investigator or qualified designee will review all ECGs to assess whether the results have 
changed since the Baseline visit and to determine the clinical significance of the results.  These 
assessments will be recorded on the eCRF.  Additional ECGs may be collected at the discretion 
of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice.  Recordings will be archived according to the Study Manual. 
6.5.5. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
The following clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated by a central laboratory, except in cases where it is not feasible to perform all tests centrally due to blood dra w volume limits, ie, in 
infants and very young patients, hematology, and biochemistry panels may be performed locally, 
with central laboratory confirmation of any abnormalities.  Specific instructions for transaminase 
elevations are provided in Section 5.2.3.1.  For any other unexplained clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after study drug administration, the test should be repeated 
and followed up at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice, until it has returned 
to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis is made to adequately explain the abnormality.  Additional safety laboratories and assessments as indicated by the clinical situation 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1-004  lumasiran  
Amendment 2, 04 May 2020  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  54 may be requested.  Clinical laboratory assessments are listed in Table 10 and will be assessed as 
specified in the Schedules of Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, an d Table 4).  
While local laboratory results may be used for urgent clinical and dosing decisions, on the day of 
the visit assessments, all laboratory a ssessments specified in Table 10 which are performed at a 
local laboratory should also be sent in parallel to the central laboratory.  Central laboratory results (once available) should be used for subsequent clinical and dosing decisions in the case of discrepant local and central laboratory results on samples drawn on the same day. 
For any safety event or laboratory abnormality, additional laboratory assessments, imaging, and 
consultation may be performed for clinical evaluation and/or in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor; results may be collected and should be included in the clinical database. 
Consult the Laboratory Manual for the blood draw priority list based on patient weight (see 
Section 6.5.5.4).

Adverse Event  
According to the ICH E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and 21 
CFR 312.32, IND Safety Reporting, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
Renal stone events (as defined  in Section  6.3.3) are recorded for efficacy assessment of 
lumasiran.  These events will not be treated as AEs or SAEs.  Other AEs or SAEs occurring during a renal stone event are reported.  
Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life-threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred.  It does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient and may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above (eg, 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the development of drug dependency or abuse). 
Adverse Events of Clinical Interest  
The following are considered to be AEs of clinical interest:  
• Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >3× upper limit of normal (ULN)  
• Severe or serious injection site reactions (ISRs); ISRs that are associated with a recall 
phenomenon (reaction at the site of a prior injection with subsequent injections), or 
those that lead to temporary dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of study drug. 
An ISR is defined as a local reaction at or near the site of injection.  “At or nea r” the 
injection site includes reactions at the injection site, adjacent to the injection site, or a 
reaction which may shift slightly away from the injection site due to gravity (eg, as 
may occur with swelling or hematoma).  A systemic reaction which includes the

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  59 injection site, eg, generalized urticaria, other distinct entities or conditions like 
lymphadenopathy that may be near the injection site is not considered an ISR. 
For information on recording and reporting of AEs of clinical interest, see Section 6.5.6.2 and Section 6.5.6.3, respectively. 
Adverse Event Severity  
AEs are to be graded according to the categories detailed below: 
Mild: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
Moderate:  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age 
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (eg, preparing meals, 
shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money). 
Severe: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting 
self-care activities of daily living (ie, bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding 
self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden); OR life -
threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; OR death related to 
an AE. 
Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity.  AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence.  When changes in the severity of an AE 
occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day should 
be noted.  If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
AE severity and seriousness are assessed independently.  ‘Severity’ characterizes the intensity of an AE.  ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for SAE). 
Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Drug  
The relationship of each AE to study drug should be evaluated by the Investigator by a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been 
caused by the study drug?”  A “yes” response indicates that the event is considered as related to 
the study drug. 
6.5.6.2. Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
The patient or legal guardian should be asked about medically relevant changes in the patient’s 
health since the last visit.  The patient or legal guardian should also be asked if the patient has been hospitalized, had any accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant 
medication routines (both prescription and over-the-counter).  In addition to patient observations, 
AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant laboratory findings, physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other findings tha t are relevant to patient safety.

Amendment 2, 04 May 2020  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  60 Recording Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for recording non-serious AEs that are observed or reported by 
the patient after administration of the first dose of study drug regardless of their relationship to study drug through the end of study.  Non-serious AEs will be followed until the end of study.  
Events occurring after signing of the ICF and before study drug administration will be captured 
as medical history (see Section  6.1), while AEs that occur after study drug administration, and  
baseline events that worsen after study drug administration, must be recorded as AEs. 
The Investigat or is responsible for recording SAEs that are observed or reported by the patient 
after the time when the informed consent is signed regardless of their relationship to study drug 
through the end of study.  SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, until baseline level 
is reached, or until the SAE is considered by the Investigator to be chronic or the patient is 
stable, as appropriate.  
All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the eCRF for 
the patient, whether or not they are considered to be drug- related.  Each AE must be described in 
detail:  onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to study drug, action 
taken, and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
For SAEs, record the event(s) on both the eCRF and the SAE form. 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest (see Section  6.5.6.1), the suppl emental AEs 
of Clinical Interest eCRF should be completed.  Additional clinical and laboratory information 
may be collected.  Refer to CRF completion guidelines for details on reporting events in the 
supplemental AEs of Clinical Interest eCRF.   
For all IS Rs, the Investigator, or delegate, should submit an Injection Site Reaction Signs or 
Symptoms eCRF, recording additional information regarding each injection site reaction that is entered on the AE eCRF (eg, symptom(s), injection site location, follow-up a ctions taken, etc. ). 
6.5.6.3. Reporting Adverse Events of Clinical Interest to Sponsor/Designee 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest (see Section  6.5.6.1), the Sponsor or its 
designee should be notified within 24 hours using a supplemental AEs of Clinical Interest eCRF. 
6.5.6.4. Serious Adverse Events Require Immediate Reporting to Sponsor/Designee 
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by the Investigator.  Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the SAE criteria in Section 6.5.6.1 must be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee within 24 hours from the time that clinical study center staff first learns of the event.  All SAEs must be reported regardless of the relationship to study drug. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1-004  lumasiran  
Amendment 2, 04 May 2020  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  61 The initial report should include at least the following information: 
• Patient’s study number 
• Description and date of onset of the event 
• Criterion for serious  
• Preliminary assignment of relationship to study drug, and 
• Investigator/site information  
To report the SAE, complete the eCRF and the SAE form.  Within 24 hours of receipt of follow-
up information, the Investigator must update the eCRF and the SAE form.  SAEs must be reported using the contact information provided in the Study Manual. 
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken by the Investigator using his/her best medical 
judgment to treat the SAE.  These measures and the patient’s response to these measures should be recorded.  All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be followed by the 
Investigator until satisfactory resolution or the Investigator deems the SAE to be chronic or 
stable.  Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed by the Investigator as needed to adequately determine the etiology of the event. 
6.5.6.5. Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities 
The Sponsor or its representative will report certain study events in an expedited manner to the 
Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency’s EudraVigilance electronic system according to Directive 2001/20/EC, and to all country Regulatory Authorities where the study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations. 
6.5.6.6. Serious Adverse Event Notification to the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be reported to the IRB/IEC per 
their institutional policy by the Investigator or Sponsor (or Sponsor designee) according to 
country requirements.  Copies of each report and documentation of IRB/IEC notification and acknowledgement of receipt will be kept in the Investigator’s study file. 
6.5.6.7. Pregnancy Reporting  
If a female patient becomes pregnant during the study through study completion, the Investigator 
must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of being notified of the 
pregnancy.  Details of the pregnancy will be recorded on the pregnancy reporting form.  The patient should receive any necessary counseling regarding the risks of continuing the pregnancy, 
the possible effects on the fetus, and be counseled to not breastfeed for 90 days after the last dose 
of study drug. 
The pregnancy should be followed by the Investigator until completion.  At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy.  If the outcome of the 
pregnancy results in a postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, then the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE as outlined in Section 6.5.6.4.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  62 6.5.6.8. Overdose Reporting  
An overdose is defined as any dose administered to or taken by a patient (accidentally or 
intentionally) that exceeds the highest daily dose, or is at a higher frequency, than included in the 
protocol for the patient’s weight category.  The Investigator will decide whether a dose is to be considered an overdose, in consultation with the Sponsor.  In the event of an overdose, the actual dose administered must be recorded in the eCRF. 
All reports of overdose (with or without an AE) must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor 
or designee. 
6.5.7. COVID-19 Data Collection 
Information on the COVID-19 infection status of the patient, if known, and other information on 
the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on the patient's participation in the study will be 
collected.  
6.6. Biomarkers, DNA Genotyping, and Biospecimen Repository  
Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutics platform permits the highly specific targeting of investigational 
therapies based on genetic sequence.  It is possible that variations in the target genetic sequence 
will result in variations in drug effect.  More generally, genetic variations may account for the well-described heterogeneous manifestations of disease in patients with PH1, as well as their 
responses to treatment. 
Where allowed per local regulations, ethics committee (IRB/IEC) approval, and legal guardian 
consent (and patient assent, where applicable), samples will be collected as part of this study to 
permit exploratory investigations and the application of novel approaches to bioanalyses that 
may further elucidate the outcomes of this study, or potentially advance understanding of the safety, mechanism of action, and/or efficacy of lumasiran.  
Biological specimens will be collected at the intervals indicated in the Schedules of  Assessment 
(see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4 ).  Potential exploratory investigations may include 
DNA, RNA, or biochemical metabolite assessments as they relate to disease progression, efficacy or safety.  
The biospecimen repository will also include residual material from routine samples (safety laboratory samples, PK samples, etc.) that are obtained during the study. 
These specimens will be securely stored in a central biorepository for up to 10 years following 
the completion of this clinical study (ie, last patient last visit), or as per local regulations.  After 10 years have elapsed, samples will be destroyed. 
Details regarding the collection, processing, storage, and shipping of the samples will be 
provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
Exploratory analysis of these biospecimens will be performed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals or its 
designees.  
When biobanking is permitted by local regulation, study participants will be advised during the 
informed consent process of these biobanking details and the potential for exploratory investigation of their samples.

The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale will be assessed at the timepoints specified in the 
Schedules of Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4 ), and may be completed up 
to 4 months after the intended time point during periods of time when the COVID-19 pandemic impedes the ability of pa tients to travel to the study site,  to assess the achievement of  
developmental milestones over time.  This tool assesses the domains of communication, daily living skills, socialization, and motor skills.  The survey can be completed in 20-60 minutes. 
6.8. Patient/Caregiver Experience and Impact Questionnaire  
The patient/caregiver experience and impact questionnaire will be used to assess the experiences of patients living with PH1 and their caregivers, including the impact of the disease on their lives 
with respect to their need to relocate/travel for treatment, and the number and type of healthcare 
providers they use.  The questionnaire will also assess the impact on patients' education and 
caregivers’ employment and education, as applicable.  This questionnaire will be completed by 
the caregiver (reporting on behalf of the patient for patient experience items) at the time points 
specified in the Schedules of Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4) when 
feasible, and may be completed up to 4 months after the intended ti me point during periods of 
time when the COVID -19 pandemic impedes the ability of patients to travel to the study site . 
7. STATISTICS  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized before database lock.  The plan will detail the implementation of the sta tistical analyses in accordance with the principle features stated in the 
protocol.  For information on study endpoints, see Section 2. 
7.1. Determination of Sample Size  
The planned enrollment for the study is 20 patients.  The sample size was determined based on feasibility considerations, not power calculations. 
7.2. Statistical Methodology  
Statistical analyses will be primarily descriptive in nature.    
For categorical variables, summary tabulations of the number and percentage of patients within 
each category (with a category for missing data) will be presented.  For continuous variables, descriptive statistics will be presented (ie, number of patients, mean,  median, standard deviation, 
standard error, minimum and maximum values). 
All data will be provided in by- patient listings.   Additional data summaries to help understand 
any impact of COVID-19 on efficacy and safety assessments will be outlined in the SAP.  
7.2.1. Populations to be Analyzed 
The populations (analysis sets) are defined as follows:  
• Safety Analysis Set:  All patients who r eceived any amount of study drug will be 
grouped according to the treatment actually received. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1-004  lumasiran  
Amendment 2, 04 May 2020  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  64 • Efficacy Analysis Set:  All patients who received any amount of lumasiran and have 
at least one valid spot urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio value at baseline and  at least 
one valid spot urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio value from assessment(s) at Month 3 to 
Month 6. 
• PK Analysis Set:  All patients who received any amount of study drug and have at least 1 postdose blood sample for PK parameters and have evaluable PK data.  
The Safety Analysis Set will be used for safety analyses and sensitivity analysis of efficacy.  The 
Efficacy Analysis Set will be used to evaluate efficacy endpoints.   The PK Analysis Sets will be 
used to conduct PK analyses. 
7.2.2. Examination of Subgrou ps 
Subgroup analyses may be conducted for selected endpoints.  Detailed methodology will be 
provided in the SAP. 
7.2.3. Handling of Missing Data 
Handling of missing data will be described in the SAP. 
7.2.4. Baseline Evaluations 
Demographics and other disease -specific baseline characteristics will be summarized for the 
Safety Analysis Set . 
7.2.5. Efficacy Analyses 
The analysis of the efficacy endpoints will be based upon the Efficacy Analysis Population.  
Descriptive summaries will be provided for the primary endpoint percent change in urinary 
oxalate excretion from baseline to Month 6.  The analysis will be performed using a mixed- effect 
model for repeated measures (MMRM) approach.  The outcome variable is percent change from 
baseline in spot urine oxalate:creatinine ratio.  The model includes baseline value as covariate 
and fixed effect terms including treatment arm and visit (Months 3, 4, 5, 6).  The treatment 
estimates from this model will represent an average percent change from baseline of spot urine oxalate:creatinine ratio  across Month 3 through Month 6 at which the treatment effect is 
expected to have reached steady state.  Furthermore, given the variability of spot oxalate:creatinine ratio, averaging the values across these visits will yield stable treatment estimates.  Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of the estimates and 
will be detailed in the SAP.  In addition, descriptive statistics scheduled visit will be presented 
and by-patient listings and figures will be generated displaying all assessments (scheduled and unscheduled). 
Secondary efficacy and exploratory endpoints which are continuous will be summarized 
descriptively in the same manner as described above.  For binary endpoints, the number and percentages of patients in each category will be displayed at each visit. 
7.2.6. Pharmacodynamic Analysis 
Urinary oxalate and glycolate excretion, urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio and plasma levels of oxalate and glycolate will be summarized over time for all patients in the Efficacy Analysis S et.

(WHO) Drug Dictionary.  Results will be tabulated by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) 
Classification System and Preferred Term  (PT). 
AEs will be classified according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
overall.  AEs, SAEs, related AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation will be summarized by 
System Organ Class (SOC) and PT for each treatment arm.  By -patient listings will be provided 
for deaths, SAEs, and events leading to discontinuation of treatment. 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for clinical laboratory data, ECG, and vital signs data.  
Laboratory shift tables from baseline to worst values will be presented.  
Other safety summaries will be presented as appropriate.  Further details will be specified in the SAP. 
7.2.9. Immunogenicity Analyses

Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1-004 ALN-GO1 (lumasiran)  
Amendment 1.0 Summary of Changes, 09 August 2019  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  1 ALN-GO1-004 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 1.0  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES DATED 09 AUGUST 2019  
ILLUMINATE -B: An Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, 
Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Lumasiran in Infants and Young Children 
with Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1 
 
Rationale for Protocol Amendment  
The primary purpose for this protocol amendment is to increase the sample size of the study due 
to a lower  than expected screening failure rate, and to align clinical objectives and endpoints 
across the Phase 3 program by shifting the evaluation of the effect of lumasiran on plasma oxalate from an exploratory objective to a secondary objective.  Several additional changes are being implemented as outlined below. 
An additional secondary endpoint for the Extension Phase of the study has been added to 
evaluate the effects of lumasiran on the duration of urinary oxalate reduction : 
• Percentage of time that spot urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio is at or below the near -
normalization threshold (≤1.5 × ULN) 
Clarifications have been added for the following: 
• Clarify that although the study is open- label, pharmacodynamic assessment data 
should not be distributed to sites until the patient has completed Month 6 
• Clarify that additional liver function tests are to be performed when no alternative 
cause of elevated transaminases is identified  
• Clarify that specific study assessments may be conducted at a location other than the 
study center by a home healthcare professional 
• Clarify that specific laboratory tests may  be performed locally in cases where it is not 
feasible to perform laboratory tests centrally, with central confirmation of any laboratory abnormalities  
In addition to these changes, the following have been implemented for this study: 
• Added study drug dosing instructions for patients whose disease progresses to requiring a dialysis regimen during the study 
• Updated the description of the analysis populations and included description of the efficacy statisticial analysis methods  
A detailed summary of changes is provided in Table  1.  Corrections to typographical errors, 
punctuation, grammar, abbreviations, and formatting are not detailed.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES DATED 04 MAY 2020 
ILLUMINATE -B: An Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, 
Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Lumasiran in Infants and Young Children 
with Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1 
1. RATIONALE FOR PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
The primary purpose of this protocol amendment is to incorporate Urgent Safety Measures 
(USMs) that were communicated to investigators in a Dear Investigator Letter , dated 31 March 
2020, to assure the safety of study participants while minimizing risks to study integrity amid the 
COVID-19 pandemic.  These changes are in line with guidance from both the European 
Medicines Agency and the United States Food and Drug Administration on the conduct of 
clinical trials during the COVID -19 pandemic.[ EMA 2020; FDA 2020]  The USMs are 
summarized in  Section 1.1. 
This protocol amendment also incorporates changes that are not related to USMs.  After ongoing review and assessment of the safety data from studies conducted with lumasiran, modifications are designed to enhance patient safety  and reduce patient burden regarding blood sampling.  
These changes are summarized in Section  1.2 and will not be implemented until appropriate 
Health Authority and Ethics Committe e (EC) and/or Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. 
1.1. Urgent Safety Measures due to the Impact of the COVID- 19 
Pandemic  
The USM modifications and new procedures are outlined below, and a detailed summary of the USMs is provided in  Table 1.  These changes were to  be adopted immediately by the 
Investigator site per the Dear Investigator Letter.   
• Lumasiran dosing outside the study center  by caregiver 
Following appropriate training on lumasiran  administration , dosing will be permitted at a 
location other than the study center (eg, at home) by the caregiver at all time points under the oversight of the Investigator and following consultation with the medical monitor.  In 
addition, references to patient/caregiver instructions for administration and storage of 
study drug are now included within the protocol.  This measure is intended to remain in effect only during periods of time when the COVID-19 pandemic impedes the ability of 
patients to travel to the study site and healthcare professionals to go to patients' homes for 
dosing. 
In order to assure uniform and comprehensive training and to assure compliance with the 
dosing instructions, the sponsor has prepared both Investigator and caregiver- facing 
written materials. The caregiver materials will provide detailed guidance on the scope of 
the self-administration allowance and detailed instructions on procedures surrounding 
dosing. These materials serve as a supplement to virtual training that caregivers will receive. The site- facing materials outline the investigator responsibilities under the self -
administration scheme and provide a guide to the expectations around caregiver training.

If the current procedure (weight obtained within 7 days prior to dose) is not possible due to the COVID- 19 pandemic impacting activities at the study site or patient ability to 
access the site, the weight from up to 6 weeks prior to the planned monthly dose or up to 
4 months prior to the planned quarterly dose may be used to calculate the amount of lumasiran to be administered . 
Currently, the lightest patient in ALN-GO1-004 is 8.5 kilograms (kg), and the remaining 
patients are above 10 kg.  Due to the considerable deceleration in the growth curve after infancy, dosing based on weight obtained during prior visit or 6 weeks for those on 
monthly dosing and 4 month s for those on quarterly dosing would result in minimal 
under-dosing of approximately 5% relative to dosing obtained within 7 days prior to dose. In addition, since all patients have received multiple doses and the expected liver 
accumulation of lumasiran at steady state, potential under-dosing by about 5% is not 
expected to meaningfully influence the efficacy of lumasiran. On the other hand, the flexibility of using weight from prior visit is expected to reduce the potential for missed 
doses, which will in turn result in persistent suppression of liver oxalate production and 
continued suppression of urinary oxalate levels. 
• Assessment of adverse events, concomitant medications, renal stone events, and 
healthcare utilization  
In situations where a study visit is unable to be completed at the site or offsite by a healthcare professional visit, the study physician (or delegate) will verbally contact the 
patient to assess any adverse events, concomitant medications, renal stone events, and healthcare utilization  within the study visit window. 
• Liver function tests  
Liver function test (LFT) results are to be obtained within 7◦days prior to dosing and results are to be reviewed prior to each dose of lumasiran.  During periods of time when the COVID -19 pandemic impedes the ability of patients to travel to the study site and 
healthcare professionals to go to patients' homes, when LFT assessments are not feasible within 7 days prior to the dose, LFT test results up to 6◦weeks prior to the planned monthly dose or up to 4 months prior to the planned quarterly dose may be reviewed to 
determine whether the dose can be administered.  LFTs from the Week 2 visit must be 
reviewed prior to administration of the Month 1 dose. 
This change in the window for LFT assessment is supported by data from our clinical 
trials.  In the 75 patients with PH1 treated with lumasiran for a duration of up to 22 
months, no clinically significant changes in LFTs due to lumasiran have been observed.  Based on available data, lumasiran has an acceptable hepatic safety profile.  
• Study visits windows  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1-004 ALN-GO1 (lumasiran)  
Amendment 2 Summary of Changes, 04 May 2020 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  3 Except for assessment s with other specified timing requirements, study assessments and 
dosing are to be performed within the following visit windows: 
Screening through Month 6 (Protocol Table 1):  Visit windows expanded from ±4 or ±7 
in protocol amendment 1 to ±14 days; visits at least 14 days apart  
After Month 7 for patients on monthly dosing (Protocol Table 2):  Visit windows expanded from ±7 to ±14 days; visits at least 21 days apart 
After Month 9 for patients on quarterly dosing (Protocol Table 4):  Visit windows 
expanded from ±14 to ±28 days 
• Pharmacokinetic assessments  
Blood samples for PK assessment should continue to be collected at 2 and 4 hours 
postdose. 
Blood samples for PK assessment may  be collected at 8, 12, and 24 hours postdose as 
feasible during periods of time when the COVID-19 pandemic impedes the ability of 
patients to travel to the study site or healthcare professionals to go to patients' homes. 
• Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, and the Patient/Caregiver Experience and 
Impact Questionnaire  
Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, and the Patient/Caregiver Experience and Impact Questionnaire can be completed up to 4 months after the intended timepoint. 
• ECG and renal ultrasound assessments  
ECG and renal ultrasound assessments may be completed up to 3 months after the 
intended timepoint for assessments scheduled prior to Month 12, and up to 9 months after 
the intended timepoint for visits at Month 12 and later .  This expansion of the ECG 
assessment window is supported by results of a clinical QTc assessment and nonclini cal 
cardiac safety assessment of lumasiran, which demonstrated that lumasiran does not have 
QTc prolongation properties. 
• Assessments required to be performed in clinic 
Abbreviated physical examination/body system assessment, safety laboratory collection 
(blood and urine), PK and PD blood collection, and blood collection for vitamin B6 
levels, ADA and exploratory analyses (blood and urine) assessments may be conducted offsite by a healthcare professional at all time points, where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow. 
• Full physical examination 
If a visit is conducted offsite (eg, home), a body system assessment can be performed in 
lieu of a physical examination. 
• Impact of COVID -19 
Information related to the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on patient participation in 
the study will be collected for each patient. Additional information regarding collection 
of this information, including completion of a new CRF specific to COVID-19, will be 
provided separately. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1-004 ALN-GO1 (lumasiran)  
Amendment 2 Summary of Changes, 04 May 2020 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  4 This change is implemented to enable analysis of the impact of the COVID -19 global 
pandemic on clinical trial data.  
• Updates to study administration text 
Text was updated to provide clarification of Investigator responsibilities regarding 
communication of new study information to patients and IRB/IECs. 
1.2. Changes Not Related to Urgent Safety Measures  
The removal of the requirement to perform coagulation studies after screening reduces patient 
burden regarding the frequency of blood samples and the volume of blood collected, while 
ensuring patient safety.  No safety signal pertaining to coagulation has been identified to date in 
any clinical study conducted with lumasiran.  This modification is particularly important for 
pediatric patients given the greater limits placed on blood collection volumes.  Additional 
changes to study conduct (outlined below) will not be implemented until appropriate HA and 
EC/IRB approval. 
• Remove the measurement of coagulation from routine chemistry surveillance  
laboratory assessments  
• Remove the requirement (after Month 12) for measurement of routine blood sample 
collection for pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) use as this was required to be stable up to Month 6 only.  After Month 6, changes to standard of care therapies are permitted and this will be captu red in concomitant medications. 
• For patients on quarterly dosing (Table 4) during the long-term extension period, 
revised expectation to visit the site every 3 months to every 6 months after Month 24.  
Required assessments will be limited to weight, LFT la boratory assessment s, single 
void urinary oxalate:creatinine, study dosing, and pregnancy testing if applicable, 
along with ongoing AEs, concomitant medications, and renal stone events 
information. 
A detailed summary of these changes is provided in Table 2 .  Corrections to typographical 
errors, punctuation, grammar, abbreviations, and formatting (including administrative changes between protocol amendments  1 and 2) are not detailed.

Purpose:  To expand study visit windows. 
The primary change occurs in Section 5.2.2, Dose and Administration 
Revised text:  For patients who weigh <20 kg, the dose will be based on a weight obtained within 7 days prior to dosing.  During 
periods of time when the COVID -19 pandemic impedes the ability of these patients to travel to the study site or healthcare 
professionals to go to patients' hom es, a weight from up to 6 weeks prior to the planned monthly dose or up to 4 months prior 
to the planned quarterly dose may be used to calculate the amount of lumasiran to be administered.  
For patients who weigh ≥20 kg, the dose may be based on a weight ob tained up to 4 months prior to the planned quarterly 
dose. 
Section(s) also reflecting this change:  
• Synopsis  
• Column headings of the Schedules of Assessments (Table 1 through Table 4) 
• Section 6.3.4, Renal Ultrasound  
• Section 6.5.4, Electrocardiogram

instructions for study drug administration are found in the Pharmacy Manual. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1-004 ALN-GO1 (lumasiran)  
Amendment 2 Summary of Changes, 04 May 2020 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  6 Dosing will be permitted at a location other than the study center (for example, the patient’s home)  by a healthcare professional 
with the oversight of the Investigator at all time points, provided the patient has tolerated at least 1 dose of lumasiran 
administered in the clinic.   However, continued study drug administration at the study center should be considered for patients who 
have ongoing study drug-related AEs, worsening injection site reactions with repeat dosing, or for anyone in the opinion of the 
Investigator who would benefit from clinical observation following dosing. 
If the patient is unable to come to the study site, and a visit by a healthcare professional is not possible due to circumsta nces 
related to t he COVID- 19 pandemic, lumasiran may be administered by the caregiver under the oversight of the Investigator, 
and following consultation with the Medical Monitor, as allowed by applicable country and local regulations.  In such cases, 
the caregiver must receive appropriate training on lumasiran administration prior to dosing.  This measure is intended to remain in effect only during periods of time when the COVID -19 pandemic impedes the ability of patients to travel to the 
study site or healthcare professio nals to go to patients' homes for dosing.

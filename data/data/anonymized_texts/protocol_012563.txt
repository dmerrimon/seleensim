Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
1. RCT Details  
This section provides a high-level overview of a published RCT that the described real-world evidence study is trying to replicate 
as closely as possible given the remaining limitations inherent in the healthcare databases.  1.1 Title 
Oral Apixaban for the Treatment of Acute Venous Thromboembolism ( AMPLIFY ) 
 1.2 Intended aim(s) 
To compare the risk of symptomatic, recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with symptomatic deep vein 
thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), or both  for apixaban versus standard therapy of warfarin. 
 1.3 Primary endpoint for replication  
The primary outcome of the study was symptomatic, recurrent VTE or death related to VTE  
1.4 Required power for primary endpoint and noninferiority margin (if applicable) 
Assuming  a non-inferiority margin of 1.80, it was determined that 4,094 patients would be needed to achieve  90% power to 
conclude noninferiority of apixaban over standard therapy  at one -sided alpha level of 0.025.  
 
1.5 Secondary endpoint for replication (assay sensitivity) and RCT finding  
Major bleeding; RR=  0.31 (95% CI 0.17–0.55) 
 
1.6 Trial estimate  
 RR = 0.84 (95% CI 0.60-1. 18) comparing apixaban vs standard therapy (Agnelli  et al., 2013)

5. Cohort Identification  
 
5.1 Cohort Summary 
This study will involve a new user, parallel group, propensity score -matched, retrospective cohort study design comparing 
apixaban to warfarin users. The patients will be  required to have continuous enrollment during a baseline period of 180 days 
before initiation of apixaban or w arfari n (index date) . We will restrict the analyses to patients with a diagnosis of proximal DVT , 
PE, or both. 
 
5.2 Important steps for cohort formation 
 New use of apixaban, exposure, and warfari n, comparator, is defined as no use of either therapy in the  180 days prior to index 
date . 
 5.2.1  Eligible cohort entry dates Market availability of apixaban in the U.S. for treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism started on 
August 21, 2014 
• For Medicare: August 21, 2014 – December 31, 2017 (end of available data)  
• For Marketscan: August 21, 2014 – December 31, 2018 (end of available data)  
• For Optum: August 21, 2014 – March 31, 2020 (end of available data)  
 
5.2.2  Specify inclusion/exclusion  criteria for cohort entry and define the index date . 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were adapted from the trial as closely as possible. Definitions for all inclusion/exclusion

 6. Variables  
 
6.1 Exposure -related variables:  
 Study drug:  
The study exposur e of interest is initiation of apixaban. New i nitiation will be defined by no use of apixaban or warfarin in the prior 6 
months before treatme nt initiation (washout period). 
 Comparator: 
New initiators of warfarin,  defined by no use of apixaban or warfarin in the prior 6 months. 
 6.2 Covariates: 
• Age 
• Sex 
• Combined Comorbidity Index (CCI), measured over the baseline covariate assessment period, defined as 180 days pr ior to 
and including index date  
 Covariates listed above represent only a small subset of covariates that will ultimately be controlled for in the design and analysis. We use the covariates above only for initial feasibility analyses to judge whether there is likely to be sufficient  overlap 
between treatment groups to proceed with the study. Remaining covariates are defined only after the study has passed the initial feasibility analysis and the initial power assessment  and are listed in Table 1 (Appendix B).  
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
 
 6.3 Outcome variables and study follow -up:  
 6.3.1  Outcome va riables 
 Primary Effectiveness outcomes of interest: (definitions provided in Appendix A): 
 
• Primary Outcome:  VTE and cause -specific mortality  
• Secondary Outcome:  Individual components 
o Hospital admission for VTE (principal diagnosis position) 
o Cause-specific m ortality 
§ Inpatient mortality identified using discharge status codes from hospitalization for VTE 
 Safety  outcome of interest:  
1. Major bleeding 
  6.3.2  Study follow -up 
Both as-treated (AT) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses will be conducted with treatment defined as the index drug on the day of 
cohort entry. Because adherence in the real-world databases is expected to be much worse than in the trial, the AT analysis is the 
primary analysis, as it targets the relative hazard of outcomes on treatment.  
 For the AT analyses, the follow-up will start the day after initiation of apixaban and comparator and will continue until the earliest date of the following events:  
• The first occurrence of the outcome of interest, unless otherwise specified for selected outcomes,  
• The date of end of continuous registration in the database,  
• End of the study period,  
• Measured death event occurs,  
• Nursing home admission 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
o Nursing home admissions are considered a censoring event because the data sources utilized typically provide little to 
no data on a patient, particularly on drug utilization, after admission. We will utilize this as an exclusion reason for 
cohorts for the same reason. 
• The date of drug discontinuation, defined as the date of the last continuous treatm ent episode of the index drug (apixaban 
and comparator) plus a defined grace period (i.e., 10 days after the end of the last prescription’s days’ supply in main analyses). 
• The date of augmentation or switching from exposure to comparator or vice versa or augmentation/switching to any other NOAC (e.g. switching from apixaban to rivaroxaban would be a censoring event);  
o A dosage change on the index treatment does not fulfill this criterion 
o An added treatment that is not part of the exposure or comparator group does not fulfill this criterion  
• Treatment of current episode of VTE with thrombectomy, insertion of caval filter , or use of fibrinolytic agent (streptokinase,  
alteplase, reteplase, tenecteplase ) 
 
 For the intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, the censoring based on the augmentation/switching and treatment discontinuation 
will be replaced with a maximum allowed follow-up time of 365 days.

In order to complete the initial power analysis, the dummy outcome of a 90 -day gap in database enrollment will be used. This 
outcome is used to ensure that no information on the comparative risks of the outcomes of interest are available at this stag e. 
Complete a 1:1 PS -matched comparative analysis using this outcome. PS should include only 3 covariates: age, sex, and combined 
comorbidity index. Power calculations are based on the formulas from Chow et al. (2008).  
• Stop analyses until feasibility and power are reviewed by primary investigators and FDA. Reviewers evaluate the results of the analyses described above in Sections 7 and 8, including numbers of patients, patient characteristics, follow -up time, and reasons 
for censoring by treatment group, as well as overall rates of outcomes and study power. These parameters are re -evaluated and 
reported in the subsequent sections, after incorporating feedback and refining the protocol. 
 
• Stop analyses until balance and final power assessment are reviewed by primary investigators, FDA, and assigned members of 
advisory board.

Power0.90; With the use of an estimated incidence of the primary efficacy outcome of 3% at 6 months with 
conventional therapy and a noninferiority margin of 1.80 for the relative risk, we calculated that we would 
need to enroll 4094 patients for the study to have 90% power to show the noninferiority of apixaban, at a one-
sided alpha level of 0.025. This sample was increased to 4816 patients to account for up to 15% of patients 
discontinuing treatment early.

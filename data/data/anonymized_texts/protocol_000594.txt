Study 
Measurements  Efficacy:  
Signs and Symptoms of Atopic Dermatitis  will be scored per body 
region (Head and Nec k; Trunk; Upper Limbs; Lower Limbs) . Signs and 
Symptoms will be scored by the principal investigator or a qualified 
person delegated by the investigator. It is strongly preferred to have one 
evaluator for each of the visits per subject . A back up evaluator  may be 
present at baseline in case the primary evaluator is unavailable at follow 
up.

Safety:  
Physical Examination : Must in clude a detailed skin examination. 
Additionally, examination of head, ears, nose and throat, eyes, central 
nervous system, r espiratory system, cardiovascular system, 
gastrointestinal system, musculoskeletal system should be assessed . 
Vital Signs : Pulse rate, blood pressure and body temperature    
Urine Pregnancy Test  
Adverse Event Assessments  
Application site reactions such as d ryness, burning/stinging, erosion, 
edema, and pain  will be assessed  scored (as per Appendix I V) and 
recorded.  
Study Endpoints  Primary endpoint:  
 The proportion of subject s in each treatment group with treatment 
success (i.e., a grade of clear or almost cl ear; a score of 0 or 1, 
within  the treatment area) based on the Investigator’s Global 
Assessment of Disease Severity at the end of treatment ( Study Day 
15) 
 
Additional  endpoints:  
 Change in severity from baseline to week 2 (study Day 15) of four 
individual  signs and symptoms of AD (i.e., erythema, 
induration/papulation, lichenification and pruritus) are considered 
supportive information  
 Application site reactions will be compared between treatment 
groups.  
 
Safety Endpoints:  
Safety assessment through the in cidences and severity of all adverse 
events (AEs) reported during the study and summarized by treatment 
group  
Statistical 
Analysis:   Therapeutic equivalence of the test product to the reference product 
will be evaluated in the PP population. To establish b ioequivalence, 
if the 90% confidence interval (calculated using Yates’  continuity 
correction) of the test - reference difference between products for the 
primary endpoint (success proportion) is contained within [ -0.20, 
+0.20], then bioequivalence of the t est product to the reference

 product will be considered to have been demonstrated.  
 As a parameter for determining adequate study sensitivity, the test 
product and RLD will be compared to placebo with regard to the 
primary endpoint from baseline to week 2 ( Day 15) . Superiority of 
the test and reference products against the placebo will be tested at 
the 5% significance level (p < 0.05; using  Fisher’s exact test ) in the 
mITT population using last observation carried forward . 
 Supportive information will be pres ented describing the c hange in 
severity from baseline to week 2 (study Day 15) of four individual 
signs and symptoms of AD (i.e., erythema, induration/papulation, 
lichenification and pruritus) .  
 Adverse events that occurred subsequent to the first dose of study 
drug will be summarized. The number and the proportion of subject s 
who experienced AEs will be computed by treatment group. AEs 
will also be summarized by each severity grade (mild, moderate, 
severe) and by each relationship grade (none, possib ly, pr obably) in 
a similar way.  
 Application site reactions will be compared via a descriptive analysis 
between treatment groups.

 1    INTRODUCTION  
 
STUDY DISEASE:  
Atopic dermatitis (AD) (eczema) is a skin disease affecting an estimated 35 million 
Americans, predominantly childre n.13 AD is a pruritic disease of unknown origin that starts 
in early infancy ; an adult -onset variant is recognized14; it is characterized by pruritus, 
eczematous lesions, xerosis  (dry skin) and lichenification.  AD may be associated with 
other atopic (immun oglobulin E [Ig  E]–associated) diseases (e . g., acute allergic reaction to 
foods, asthma, urticaria, and allergic rhinitis).   AD is the first disease to present in a series 
of allergic diseases s uch as food allergy, asthma, and allergic rhinitis, provoking the 
“atopic march” theory, which suggests that early or severe AD and cutaneous sensitization 
to environmental allergens may lead to subsequent allergic disease at other epithelial 
barrier surfa ces (e.g., gastrointestinal or respiratory tract).14 This hypothesis is supported 
by cross -sectional and longitudinal studies.  
 
TREATMENT OPTIONS15 
Topical steroids in atopic dermatitis  
 Topical steroids  are currently the mainstay of treatment  in associati on with 
moisturization . 
Immunomodulators in atopic dermatitis  
 Tacrolimus (topical FK506) is an immune modulator that acts as a calcineurin 
inhibitor. In the US, Tacrolimus is available as an ointment and is indicated as a 
second -line therapy for the short -term and non -continuous chronic treatment of 
moderate -to-severe atopic dermatitis. Topical Tacrolimus Ointment is available in 
2 strengths, 0.1% for adults and 0.03% for adults and children  aged 2 years and 
older .  
 Pimecrolimus cream, 1% is a calcineurin i nhibitor immunosuppressant indicated 
as second -line therapy for the short -term and non -continuous chronic treatment of 
mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in non -immunocompromised adults and 
children 2 years of age and older, who have failed to respond adeq uately to other 
topical prescription treatments, or when those treatments are not advisable. It i s 
not indicated for use in children less than 2 years of age. It is avai lable in the US 
as Elidel®.  
Other treatments  in atopic dermatitis  
 UV-A, UV -B, a combin ation of both, psoralen plus UV -A (PUVA), or UV -B1 
(narrow -band UV -B) therapy may be used.  
 In patients with severe disease  and particularly in adults, phototherapy, 
methotrexate (MT X), azathioprine, cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil  have 
been used . 
 Hydroxyzine and diphenhydramine hydrochloride  
 Barrier repair moisturizers  
 Bleach baths  
 Probiotics

ABOUT STUDY DRUG:  
Pimecrolimus cream, 1% is a calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressant indicated as 
second -line therapy for the short -term and non -continuous c hronic treatment of mild to 
moderate atopic dermatitis in non -immunocompromised adults and children 2 years of age 
and older, who have failed to respond adequately to other topical prescription treatments, 
or when those treatments are not advisable .16 
 
Dosage & Administration  
Patient s should apply a thin layer of pimecrolimus cream , 1%  to all affected skin  areas  
twice daily. Continuous long -term use of pimecrolimus cream, 1% should be avoided, and 
application should be limited to areas of involvement with a topic dermatitis . The safety of 
pimecrolimus cream, 1% under occlusion, which may promote systemic exposure, has not 
been evaluated. Use of pimecrolimus cream, 1% with occlusive dressings  should be 
avoided .16 
 
Warning and Precautions16 
Long -term safety of topical calcineurin inhibitors has not been established . Although a 
causal relationship has not been established, rare cases of malignancy have been reported 
in patients treated with topical calcineurin inhibitors, including Elidel® Cream, 1%. 
Therefore:  
 Continuous long -term use of topical calcineurin inhibitors, including Pimecrolimus  
Cream, 1%, in any age group should be avoided, and application limited to areas of 
involvement with atopic dermatitis .  
 Pimecrolimus  Cream, 1% is not indicated for use in chi ldren less than 2 years of age . 
Pimecrolimus  Cream, 1% should not be used in immunocompromised adults and 
children, i ncluding patients on systemic immunosuppressive medications.    
 If signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis do not improve within 6 weeks, pa tients 
should be re examined by their healthcare provider and their diagnosis be confirmed.  
 The safety of Pimecrolimus  Cream, 1% has not been established beyond one year of 
non-continuous use.  
Common Side Effects   
Anaphylactic reactions, ocular irritation a fter application of the cream to the eye lids or 
near the eyes, angioneurotic edema, facial edema, skin flushing associated with alcohol use 
and skin discoloration.  
 
The use of Pimecrolimus  Cream, 1% may cause local symptoms such as skin burning 
(burning s ensation,  stinging, soreness) or pruritus. Localized symptoms are most common 
during the first few days of  Pimecrolimus  Cream, 1% application and typically improve as 
the lesions of atopic dermatitis resolve .

Drug Interactions  
Potential interactions bet ween Pimecrolimus Cream , 1% and other drugs, including 
immunizations, have not been systematically evaluated. Due to low blood levels of 
pimecrolimus detected in some patients after topical application, systemic drug interactions 
are not expected, but cann ot be ruled out. The concomitant administration of  known 
CYP3A family of inhibitors in patients with widespread and/or erythrodermic disease 
should be done with caution. Some examples of such drugs are erythromycin, itraconazole, 
ketoconazole, fluconazole,  calcium channel blockers and cimetidine.  
 
1.1 Study Rationale  
Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is a common skin disorder that affects an estimated 35 million  
Americans, most often beginning in infancy and childhood. The introduction of topical  
calcineurin inhibit ors for the treatment of atopic dermatitis addresses a clear unmet medical  
need by offering an important alternative to topical corticosteroids for patients, care -givers  
and physicians.  
 
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common and chronic inflammatory skin dis ease that affects a 
large part of the population. Although atopic dermatitis responds well to twice daily mid -
strength corticosteroids, it is not optimal to expose a patient to the long term use of topical 
corticosteroids  because of their s ide effects like skin atrophy, striae, tachyphylaxis, adrenal 
suppression, bacterial infections, and contact allergies . Pimecrolimus Cream 1% is an 
alternative topical therapy for use in patients with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis.  
 
The purpose  of the study is to es tablish the bioequivalence of Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% 
with that of Elidel® (pimecrolimus ) Cream 1%  in patient s with AD using clinical 
endpoints.  The double blind parallel group randomized placebo controlled study design 
was chosen as an appropriate study de sign based on the recommendations from draft 
guidance on bioequivalence study for Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% and from prescribing 
information for Elidel® (pimecrolimus ) Cream  1%. 
 
This trial uses the dose that ha s proven efficacy and safety in various clinical  trials and 
approved strengths by developed countries.   
 
As per FDA guidelines for Pimecrolimus, a  placebo control arm is recommended to 
demonstrate that the test product and RLD are active and as a parameter to establish that 
the study is sufficiently sen sitive to detect differences between products.  
 
The study will commence after a written approval obtained from the IRB at respective 
sites. The study will be conducted as per the ICH -GCP (step 5) Guidelines and in 
accordance with the Declaration of Helsin ki, (Fortaleza, Brazil, October, 2013) .

 1.2 Risk -Benefit Assessment  
Long -term safety of topical calcineurin inhibitors has not been established. Although a 
causal relationship has not been established, rare cases of malignancy have been reported 
in patients t reated with topical calcineurin inhibitors, including E lidel® Cream 1%.  
Participation in this study may  or may not benefit the subject s. The exp ected potential 
benefits of Pimecrolimus include  improvement in  signs and symptoms of AD. 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Prim ary Objective  
The p rimary Objective  is to establish the bioequivalence between test drug , Pimecrolimus 
Cream, 1% with that of reference listed drug, Elidel® (pimecrolimus)  Cream 1%,  listed as 
RLD in the Orange Book (NDA No. N021302), in the treatment of mi ld to moderate AD, 
using the primary endpoint in the Per Protocol population , as detailed in FDA Draft 
Guidance on Pimecrolimus 1% Topical Cream dated March 2012.  
2.2 Additional Objectives  
 To establish superiority of each active treatment over the placebo usin g the primary 
endpoint in the modified intent to treat (mITT) population and Last Observation Carried 
Forward (LOCF)  
 To assess indiv idual signs and symptoms of Atopic Dermatitis  (i.e., erythema, 
induration /papulation, lichenification and pruritus ) in each treatment group  
 To compare the safety and tolerability between the test and reference drugs  
 
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Overall Study Design  and Data Collection  
The study is  a randomized, double blind, active and placebo controlled, prospective 
multicent er, comp arative therapeutic equivalence study  in subject s with mild to moderate 
AD. The study consists of three  treatment arms. As per FDA recommend ation s, this study 
will be a bioequivalence study with a clinical endpoint in the treatment of mild to moderate 
atopic dermatitis comparing the test product versus the reference listed drug and vehicle 
control, each applied as a thin layer twice daily to the affected area(s) for 14 days (2 
weeks). The primary endpoint is the proportion of subject s with treatment success  (a grade 
of clear or almost clear; a score of 0 or 1, within the treatment area) based on the 
Investigator’s Global Assessment of Disease Severity at the end of treatment (study Day 
15).  
 
A placebo control arm (vehicle of test product) is used to demonst rate that the test product 
and RLD are active and as a parameter to establish that the study is sufficiently sensitive to 
detect differences between products.

 The study duration for each subject  is up to 32 days. There is a screening period of up to 
14 days and a treatment period of 14  (± 3) days.   
 
A total of 648 subject s will be included in the study. The subject s will be randomized into 
three groups in 1:1:1 ratio.  
 
         The study consist s of a total of 4 visits:  
 
1. V1-Screening Visit , if required  (-up to 14 days) .  If one is already using bland emollient 
(e.g Cetalphil® Lotion) continuously for 7 days, there is no need to be dispensed study 
bland emollient .  In such case, procedures of Visit 1 (V1) and  Visit 2 ( V2) can be 
combined in one visit, if de sired . 
2. V2-Baseline and Randomization Visit (Day 1)  
3. V3-Interim Visit  (Day 8 ± 3 days)  
4. V4-End of Therapy Visit (Day 15 ± 3 days)  
 
It is strongly preferred to have one evaluator for each of the visits per subjec t. A back up 
evaluator may be present at baseli ne in case the primary evaluator is unavailable at follow 
up.

 3.1.1.2  Demograph ics: Data  including gender, birth date, age, ethnicity and race, body weight , 
height, and use of birth control (for females) will be recorded.  
3.1.1.3  Medical History : Detailed medical history , including the start date of atopic dermatitis 
will be obtained.  (Subject/guardian may verbally report signs and symptoms of atopic 
dermatitis with an onset at least 3 months prior.)  
3.1.1.4  Vital  Signs: Body temperature , blood pressure,  and pulse rate will be performed  and 
recorded .  
3.1.1.5  Diagnosis : Subject s will undergo a clinical examination for the diagnosis of  AD using 
the Hanifin Rajka criteria as outlined in Appendix I .   
3.1.1.6  Signs and Symptoms:  Signs and Symptoms of Atopic Dermatitis will be scored per 
body region (Head and Neck; Trunk; Upper Limbs; Lower Limbs).  Signs and 
symptoms of AD (i.e., erythema, induration/papulation, and lichenification ) will be  
scored objectivel y and recorded using the scale mentioned in Appendix II . The 
average/typical severity per sign/symptom of all lesions in the reported body region will 
be recorded.  
Signs and Symptoms will be scored by the principal investigator or a qualified person 
delega ted by the investigator. It is strongly preferred to have one evaluator for each of 
the visits per subject. A back up evaluator may be present at baseline in case the 
primary evaluator is unavailable at follow up.  
The evaluator will score the sign and sym ptom per body region as it presents itself at 
the current visit, and not in comparison to any other visit.   
3.1.1.7  Body Surface Area  (BSA) Assessment : An overall body surface area involved with 
atopic dermatitis  will be assessed . The palmar method (surface area o f the palm 
including fingers and thumb is considered roughly equal to 1% of body surface area ) is 
recommended for assessment . Subject s must have at least  5% BSA to be included in the 
study.  
3.1.1.8  Investigator’s  Global Assessment (IGA)  
At each visit , the investig ator will assess the overall status of the subjec t’s skin for AD 
using the IGA  as per the scale noted in Appendix III . The IGA is a static assessment of 
how the subject ’s overall skin is observed at the time of the current visit. Scores or 
severity from pr ior visits should not be considered. The IGA scores for each visit will 
be documented on the source and the Case Report Form.  Subject s must have a score  of 
mild to moderate AD on IGA in order to be enrolled in the study.  
3.1.1.9  Pruritus Assessment : Pruritus will be assessed by questioning the subject or the 
subject’s guardian regarding the intensity of overall itc hing/scratching/discomfort in the 
24 hours prior to the visit using the scale mentioned in Appendix II.  
3.1.1.10  Local Application Site Reactions : Subjects will also be assessed at screening for 
evaluation of pre -treatment local application site reactions. At each study visit, the 
investigator will evaluate any application site reactions with separate severity scores for 
dryness, burning/stinging, erosion, edema, and pain. At each visit the reactions will be

 noted and classified as mil d, moderate or severe. Refer to Appendix IV Local Irritation 
Scale (LIS) for scoring of application site reactions.  
3.1.1.11  Physical Examination : Subjects will undergo a general physical exam ination. A 
detailed dermatological examination is required. A full body dermatologic examination 
will assess if the subject ha s any dermatologic malignancies. If the subject does have a 
dermatologic malignancy , they should not be enrolled. The following sy stems should 
also be evaluated: head, ears, nose, throat, eyes, central nervous system, respiratory, 
cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal.  
3.1.1.12  Concomitant Medication : History  concomitant medications used will be obtained  for 
at least the past 30 days . The start and stop date of medication use will be collected  in 
addition to the reason for use.  See section 6.3.  
3.1.1.13  Screening  Criteria :  
Subjects will be evaluated to confirm that they meet the following screening criteria.  
 Non-immunocompromised male  or female aged 8 years and older  
 Clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD), as defined by the criteria of 
Hanifin and Rajka  
 Failed to respond adequately to other topical prescription treatments for AD, or for whom those 
treatments are not advisable (The subject/guardian’s verbal report of failure to other topical 
prescription treatments for AD will be adequate.)  
 An Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) of disease severity of mild or moderate at baseline 
(score of 2 or 3)  
 Affected area  of AD involvement at least 5% body surface area (BSA)  
 Expected to be able to meet inclusion and exclusion criteria (See section 4.1.) after minimum 7 
days of continuous treatment with a bland emollient ( e.g. Cetaphil® Lotion ).  
3.1.1.14  Bland emollient distributio n: Subjects who meet Screening Criteria will receive a 
bland emollient (e.g. Cetaphil® Lotion ) to use at least once per day over seven days.   
Those subjects who have already been using bland emollient as standard of care don’t 
need study bland emollient di spensation.  In such case, procedures of Visit 1 (V1) and 
Visit 2 (V2) can be combined in one visit, if desired.  
 
3.1.1.15  Schedule Next Visit : Subject s will be instructed  on care  until their next visit.  Subjects 
should return the provided bland emollient at the nex t visit.  Subjects should be advised 
that they will be evaluated again at the next visit to confirm their eligibility for study 
treatment.

Subject s entering the study will be randomized in ratio of 1:1:1 for 3 treatment arms.  
 
Knowledge of the randomization list will be limited to the persons responsible for the 
creation of the randomization list, labeling,  packing & distribution of the IMP’s.  
 
Rand omization schedule will be generated based on the randomization request details 
and study design outlined in the protocol using SAS by the statistician & will be used 
to assign subject s to treatment groups .  Randomization schedule will be shared with the 
unblinded team involved in labeling, packaging, distribution of investigational products  by the 
statistician. Unblinded personnel at packaging site will pack the IMP’s based on the 
randomization schedule. All the IMP’s will be identified with their respecti ve kit 
numbers.  
 
To maintain the blinding through packaging:  
a. Packing material should be similar in colour and size.  
b. Labelling and packaging shall be performed as per the instructions given in the 
batch packaging document.  
c. Uniformity shall be maintained dur ing assembly of  labels on units, placement of 
units in the carton & sealing of the subject  kits. 
 
IMP’s will be distributed to sites along with corresponding respective blinded labels 
containing the randomized treatment . 
 
Site personnel will pick the appro priate next numbered IMP kit and complete the 
details on the IMP tube label  dispensed . Site personnel will dispense to  the 
subject /guardian  specific IMP tube(s) and instruct the subject /guardian  on the IMP 
usage. Subject s/guardians  are advised to return th e used & unused IMP  tubes . 
 
Unblinding:  
In the case of an emergency, the investigator may learn the treatment arm the subject  
was randomized to by removing the occlusive tube label remaining in the subject s 
records stored  at the investigator’s site. Except in the circumstances detailed in 
unblinding section (breaking the blind),  the code will not be broken. The CRO shall be 
contacted before unblinding whenever possible.  
 
Unblinding a subject ’s treatment is restricted to emergency situations and should only be 
done to facilitate the proper care of a subject . In -case of emergency, 
investigator/authorized personnel will contact the CRO for unblinding the subject s by 
submitting the Un -blinding Request Form. The investigator should always attempt to 
contact the medical monitor/designee  before breaking the b lind.

 In case of safety issues, a medical emergency where the identity of investigational product 
is essential for medical management of a subject , or an AE/SAE that requires expedited 
reporting, shall a subject become un -blinded as to the treatment they are receiving. The un -
blinding provides the information about the identity of study drug provided to the subject  
as per the randomization list.  
 
If there is a medical emergency with a subject , the Study PI wil l take the necessary medical 
action to address the emergency first, and then send an unblinding form to the unblinded 
person at CRO. Unblinded person sends this form to the medical monitor/designee for 
approval. If the medical monitor or designee, after ca reful consideration of the 
circumstances, feels that there is a need to know which treatment group the subject  is in, 
he/she will approve the unblinding by signing this form. This signed /approved form will 
be sent to the site, upon which investigator can unblind the subject .  Based on the 
authorization from the unblinded authority of CRO,  the study PI will  access to unblind the 
particular subject  ID. 
 
Should the unblinding happen, the same treatment kit should be withdrawn from the 
subject . The kit should be quarantined with proper status on site.  
An account of all broken or unbroken codes will be collected by the monitor at or after site 
closure.  
 
Every attempt will be made to maintain the blinding throughout the study. In any case 
treatment code is broken ; the un -blinding procedure must be adequately documented in the 
subject ’s study file.  
 
Before breaking the blind of an individual subject ’s blinded treatment, the investigator 
should have dete rmined that the information is necessary, i.e., that it will alter the 
subject ’s immediate manage ment.  Every attempt will be made to maintain the blind 
throughout the study. 
If the treatment blind is broken, the investigator will record the reason and date, time  on 
the appropriate CRF. If the blind is broken because of an AE/SAE , an AE/SAE  form will 
be completed and informed to CRO.  Randomization data are kept strictly confidential, and 
are accessible only to authorized personnel, until unblinding of the trial after database lock.   
 
7 SAFETY ASSESSMENT  
Adverse event (or adverse experience, AE): Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  
or clinical investigation subject  administered the test and reference product which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore b e 
any unfavourable  and unintended sign (including for example an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom  or disease temporally associated with the use of the test and reference

 product, whether or not considered related to the test and reference product. Eac h subject  
will be carefully monitored for the development of any adverse events. This information 
should be obtained in the form of non -leading questions (e.g., “How are you feeling?”) and 
from signs and symptoms detected during each examination, observati ons of the study 
personnel or spontaneous reports from the subject s. 
 
Subject s will be monitored for safety and tolerability during the study and until the 
completion of the study. Any AEs, including either observed or volunteered problems, 
complaints, sig ns or symptoms, occurring during the course of the study or designated 
follow -up periods, must be recorded on the subject ’s CRF. This would include AEs 
resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concomitant medications.  
 
Each AE will be evaluated f or duration, intensity, and relationship to (or association with) 
the study treatment (or other causes). Additionally, the actions taken (e.g., discontinuation 
of study medication, administration of treatment) and the resulting outcome of the AE 
should be indicated on the CRF.  
 
Any subject  who is withdrawn from the study due to an adverse event should be followed 
until the outcome of the event is determined, and the investigator will prepare a written 
summary of the event and document the available follow -up information in the study 
documents.  
7.1 Intensity of Adverse Events  
The intensity of the AEs will be graded according to the following criteria:  
a. Mild:  Events that are usually transient; require only minimal treatment or therapeutic 
intervention; do n ot generally interfere with usual daily activities.  
b. Moderate:  Events that are alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention; 
interfere with usual daily activities, causing discomfort but pose no significant or 
permanent risk or harm to t he subject . 
c. Severe:  Events that require intensive therapeutic intervention; interrupt usual daily 
activities, or significantly affect clinical status; pose a significant risk or harm to the 
subject  and hospitalization may be required.  
7.2 Causality Assessm ent  
Causality denotes the relation of the event to the study drug and is classified as follows by 
the investigator:  
a. ‘Definitely Related’ when the AE is clearly related to the study drug or 
intervention and is defined as meeting all the following cond itions:  
Has a reasonable temporal relationship to the investigational agent(s) or research 
intervention; could not have been readily produced by the subject ’s clinical state or have 
been due to environmental or other intervention; disappears or decreases with reduction in 
investigational agent or cessation of intervention; recurs with re -exposure to the

 investigational agent(s) (in case of studies involving multiple administration of drug); no 
alternative cause is present; follows a known pattern of respon se to intervention  
 
b. ‘Probably Related’ when the AE is likely related to the investigational agent(s) or 
intervention and is defined as meeting any three of the following conditions:  
Has a reasonable temporal relationship to the investigational agents( s) or research 
intervention; Could not readily have been produced by the subject ’s clinical state or have 
been due to environmental or other intervention; Follows known or suspected pattern of 
response to intervention; Disappears or decreases with reductio n in investigational agent or 
cessation of intervention; Alternative cause may be present  
 
c. ‘Possibly Related’ when it may be related to the investigational agent(s) or 
intervention and is defined as meeting any two of the following conditions:  
Has a r easonable temporal relationship to the investigational  agents(s) or research 
intervention; Could not have been produced readily by the subject ’s clinical state or have 
been due to environmental or other intervention; Follows known or suspected pattern of 
response to intervention; Alternative cause is present  
 
d. ‘Unlikely Related’ when it is doubtfully related to the investigational agent(s) or 
intervention and is defined as meeting any two of the following conditions:  
Has a temporal relationship to the i nvestigational agents(s) or research intervention; Could 
readily have been produced by the subject ’s clinical state or have been due to 
environmental or other intervention; Does not follow a known pattern of response to 
intervention; Does not reappear or w orsen with reintroduction of intervention (in case of 
studies involving multiple administration of drug); Alternative cause is present  
 
e. ‘Not related’ when the AE is clearly not related to the investigational agent(s) or 
intervention and is defined as m eeting all of the following conditions:  
Has no temporal relationship to the investigational agents(s) or research intervention; 
Follows no known or suspected pattern of response; Alternative cause is present.  
7.3 Frequency  
i.If the same type of AE occurs onl y once will be documented as ‘Single Episode’.  
ii.If the same type of AE occurs more than once, will be documented as ‘Recurrent’.  
iii.If an AE is still continuing (not resolved) will be documented as ‘Continuous Event’.  
 
7.4 Serious Adverse Events  
A seriou s adverse event (SAE) is defined as any event that suggests a significant clinical 
hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution. This includes any event which:  
- Results in death.  
- Life threatening.  
- Results in persistent or significant disabili ty / incapacity.  
- Requires repeated hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.

protocol and his/her signature on the CRF guarantees the completeness and integrity of 
these data.  All records and documents pertaining to the study will be maintai ned as 
documented for at least a period of 2 years following the date a marketing application is 
approved for the indication for which it is being investigated; or if no application is to be 
filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until 2 years after the 
investigation is discontinued and regulatory authorities are notified. These documents 
should be retained for a longer period if required by an agreement with the sponsor. In 
such an instance, it is the responsibility of the sponsor  to inform the investigator  / 
institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
8.2 Access to Source Data  
The investigator  must ensure that institutional regulations and the informed consent form 
clearly permit study -related monitoring, aud its, IRB review, and regulatory inspections 
providing direct access to source data and documents  by the sponsor, the sponsor’s

 8.4 Monitoring  
The study will be monitored by the CRO , Sponsor, and/or Sponsor Delegate .    Monitoring 
may be done by personal visits by the site monitor who will r eview the CRFs and source 
documents, and/or by frequent communications (letter, email, telephone, and fax).  The site 
monitor will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to protocol design and 
regulatory requirements.  
8.5 Data Management  
Data man agement will ensure that clinical parameters collected on each subject  throughout 
the study are as complete, accurate and of the highest quality possible and that the 
procedures are performed in accordance with all applicable guidelines and regulations 
(including ICH guidelines). CRFs, questionnaires and treatment diaries shall be made 
available to the data management site.   
9 DATA ANALYSIS AND STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
The following information provides an overview of the issues related to the analysis of 
data collected during the study.  
9.1 Determination of Sample Size  
The primary statistical analysis of interest is the proportion of subject s in the PP  population with a 
clinical response of treatment succe ss (at least an Investigator’s Global Assessment  of 
Clear or Almost Clear ) at study Day 15 . Considering the pivotal studies of the Reference 
Listed Drug, it is assumed that the active test and RLD will have approximate success rates 
at 21% and the vehicle cream will have an approximate success rate of 9%. A sample size of 
184 subject s per group will provide at least 99% power to demonstrate bioequivalence (i.e., the 
90% confidence interval (Yates’ continuity -corrected) of the absolute difference between the test 
and reference composite success rates is within  a defined equivalence range [ -0.20, +0.20 ]). Assuming the 
conversion rate from mITT to PP will be about 90%, 205 subject s in each of the groups of the  mITT 
population will provide at least 85% power to demonstrate superiority of active over placebo. Under  the 
above assumptions, the overall global study power to demonstrate bioequivalence and superiority is 
estimated to be  approximately  85%. To allow for about 5% of subject s who may drop out from the 
study or are otherwise non -evaluable, approximately 648 subject s will  be en rolled (216 in 
each active group and 216 in the place bo group).  
 
9.2 Statistical Methods  
9.2.1 Study Population  
9.2.1.1  Intent -to-treat (ITT)  
The safety population includes all randomized subject s who applied the study 
product at least once.

         Page 41 of 75 
 
  
 
 
 9.2.1.2  Modified Int ent-to-treat (mITT)  
The mITT population includes all randomized subject s who met all inclusion / 
exclusion criteria, applied at least one dose of assigned product and returned for 
at least one post -baseline evaluation visit.  
 
9.2.1.3  Per Protocol (PP)  
The PP popu lation includes all randomized subject s who met all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, applied 75% to 125% of the assigned product for 
the specified duration of the study, did not miss the scheduled applications for 
more than 3 consecutive days, and completed t he evaluation within the 
designated visit window (+/ - 3 day) with no protocol violations that would affect 
the treatment evaluation. The subject ’s compliance will be verified by the use of 
subject  diaries, and the protocol violations that would affect the treatment 
evaluation.  
 
9.2.2 Statistical analysis  
9.2.2.1  Efficacy Analysis  
Primary Efficacy Parameter:  
Equivalence Analysis  
The 90% confidence interval for the difference in success proportions between test and 
reference treatment must be contained within [ -0.20, +0. 20] in order to establish 
equivalence.  
The compound hypothesis to be tested is:  
H0:  PT - PR < -0.20 or PT - PR > 0.20   
Versus   
HA:  -0.20 ≤ PT - PR  ≤ 0.20  
where PT = success rate of test treatment and   PR = success rate of reference treatment.  
Let  
nT = sample size of test treatment group Tn  
cnT = number of successes in test treatment group Tn  
nR = sample size of reference treatment group Rn  
cnR = number of successes in reference treatment group Rn  
PT = cnT / nT , PR = cnR / nR,  
and se = (  PT (1 - PT ) / nT + PR (1 -  PR ) / nR ) ½.  
The 90% confidence interval for the difference in proportions between test and reference 
will be  calculated as follows, using Yates’ correction:  
L = ( PT - PR) – 1.645 se – (1/ nT  + 1/ nR ) / 2  
U = ( PT - PR) + 1.64 5 se + (1/ nT  + 1/ nR ) / 2

 We reject H 0 if L <  -0.20 or  U > 0.20  
Rejection of the null hypothesis H 0 supports the conclusion of equivalence of the two 
products.  
 
Superiority of the treatment :  
Superiority of both treatments over the placebo will be evaluated for mITT population at 
week  2. Tests for superiority of each active treatment over the placebo will be conducted 
using two -sided Fisher exact test at the 5% level of significance.  
The efficacy analysis will be conducted  in mITT population and La st Observation 
Carried Forward  (LOCF) approach will be used to impute for missing data in the mITT 
population.  
 
Secondary Efficacy & Safety Parameters:  
The change in severity from baseline to week 2 (study Day 15) of four individual signs 
and symptoms of  AD (i.e., erythema, induration/papulation, lichenification and pruritus; 
see Table 2) will be evaluated as supportive information . 
The type of AE(s), number of AE(s) and proportion of subject s with AE(s)  
Safety assessment through the incidences of all adv erse events (AEs) reported during the 
study and summarized by treatment group . 
  
Main  Variables  Assessed for Safety  & Tolerability :  
AE(s) monitored using information volunteered by the subject  and as observed by the PI 
will be categorized descriptively by  total number of AE(s) based on their causality, as 
well as severity and compared between the 3 study arms.  
 
9.2.2.2  Safety Analysis  
Subject s will be monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the study (as explained 
above)  and until the  completion of the st udy.  
Adverse events will be tabulated for each and summary statistics will be  statistically  
evaluated  using Fisher’s exact test . 
9.3 Presentation of Results  
Summary statistics will be presented for actual values and changes from the baseline. If the 
values ar e raw measurements or derived totals from raw measurements, then the statistical 
measures; mean and median will be presented to single decimal place more than the 
maximum number of decimal places to which the raw measurements are collected. 
Minimum and max imum will be presented to the same number of decimal places as the 
maximum of decimal places to which the raw measurements are collected.

 Standard deviation (SD) will be presented two decimal places more than the raw data. If 
the values are derived values then an extra decimal place will be added to all these 
measures. Percentages will always be presented in two decimal place. Zero counts will be 
reported as '0' with '0.0%' percentages and 100 percentages  will be presented as 100.00% 
counts will be presente d as integer values.  
Confidence intervals and percentiles will be presented with two decimal place. All p -
values will be reported to four decimal points and p -values less than 0.0001 will be 
reported as <0.0001.  
 
Interim Evaluation:  
No interim evaluation is planned for this study.  
 
9.4 Handling of Dropout or Missing Data  
No missing imputations will be done for either efficacy or safety parameters estimations.  
Subject s whose condition worsens and require alternate or supplemental therapy for the 
treatment of t heir AD during the study should be discontinued, included in the PP 
population analysis as treatment failures, and provided with effective treatment. Subject s 
discontinued early for other reasons should be excluded from the PP population, but 
included in t he mITT population, using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF). For 
example, subject s who develop a skin infection in the treated area requiring treatment 
should be discontinued, excluded from the PP population, but included in the mITT 
population, usin g LOCF.

 12.5 Appendix V: Instructions  for the patients  
WARNING: LONG -TERM SAFETY OF TOPICAL CALCINEURIN INHIBITORS HAS 
NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED  
Although a causal relationship has not been established, rare cases of malignancy (e.g., skin and 
lymphoma) have been reported in patients  treated with topical calcineurin inhibitors, including 
ELIDEL  Cream, 1%.  
Therefore:  
 Continuous long -term use of topical calcineurin inhibitors, including ELIDEL Cream, 1%, in 
any age group should be avoided, and application limited to areas of involvemen t with atopic 
dermatitis.  
 ELIDEL Cream, 1% is not indicated for use in children less than 2 years of age.  
                                                                                                                                                                                  
ELIDEL Cream, 1% may cause serious side effects. It is not known if ELIDEL Cream, 1% is 
safe to use for a long period of time. A very small number of people who have used ELIDEL 
Cream, 1% have had cancer (for example, skin or l ymphoma). However, a link with ELIDEL 
Cream, 1% use has not been shown. Because of this concern:  
 A patient should not use the study cream  continuously for a long time.  
 Study c ream should be used only on areas of skin that have eczema.  
 A patient should not use sun lamps, tanning beds, or get treatment with ultraviolet light 
therapy during the study . 
 A patient should limit sun exposure during t he study and  even when the study cream  is 
not on the skin. If a patient needs to be outdoors after applying the study  cream , the 
patient should wear loose fitting clothing that protects the affect ed area from the sun. The 
physician should advise the patient about other types of protection from the sun.  It is not 
known how the study cream may affect your skin with exposur e to ultraviolet light.  
 A patient should not cover the affected skin with bandages, dressings or wraps. A patient 
can wear normal clothing.  
 The study cream  is for topical use on the skin only. Do not get the study cream  in your 
eyes, nose, mouth, vagina, o r rectum (mucous membranes). If you get the study cream  in 
any of these areas, burning or irritation can happen. Wipe off any study cream  from the 
affected area and then rinse the area well with cold water. The study cream  is for external 
use only.  
 Wash h ands before using the study cream . When applying the study cream  after a bath or 
shower, the skin should be dry.  
 Apply a thin layer of the study cream  only to the affected skin areas, twice a da y, as 
directed by the physician. Use the smallest amount of cream needed.  
 A patient should not bathe, shower or swim for at least 3 hours  after applying the study 
cream. This could wash off the cream.   In addition, please avoid prolonged bathing (i.e. 
longer than 5 minutes).

EP0087 is an open-label, randomized, parallel-group, active- controlled study  to assess the 
efficacy  and safety of brivaracetam (BRV) administered intravenousl y as treatment for increased 
seizure activity in an epilepsy  monitoring unit (EMU) setting. The primary  objective is to assess 
the efficacy  of intravenous (iv) BRV compared to iv lorazepam (LZP) in subjects with epilepsy 
undergoing EMU evaluation who experience seizures that require p rompt treatment.
Subjects will be 18 to 70 y ears of age, will have an established diagnosis of epilepsy , and will be 
admitted to an institution’s EMU for seizure characterization or noninvasive presurgical 
evaluation. Upon admission to the EMU (after screening), the subject will be randoml y assigned 
(1:1:1) to receive a single iv dose of BRV 100mg, BRV 200mg, or LZP. 
The primary  efficacy  variable is time to next seizure per clinical observation with EEG 
confirmation or rescue medication. The secondary effi cacy variables are proportion of subjects 
seizure-free per clinical observation at 6 hours, 8 hours, and 12 hours after the end of study  drug 
administration, and proportion of subjects who receive rescue medication during the 6 hours, 
8 hours, and 12 hours after the end of study  drug administration.
The other efficacy  variable is time until seizure is resolved without additional intervention per 
clinical observation for those activel y seizing at the end of stud y drug administration.  
The pharmacokinetic variable is plasma concentration of BRV.
Safety  variables are adverse events (AEs), assessment of cognitive impairment, vital signs, 
oxygen saturation, electrocardiogram (ECG), and occurrence of status epilepticus.
Study  drug administration will begin when the Investigator or designee determines by  clinical 
observation and electroencephalogram (EEG) that a seizure requiring intervention (ie, qualify ing 
seizure) has started. The subject’s seizure activit y, by clinical observation and EEG, will be 
assessed over the next 12 hours following the end of study  drug administration. I n addition, the 
subject’s cognitive impairment, vital signs, oxygen saturation, and ECG will be measured at 
specified time points. If the subject’s seizure activity does not stop after a dministration of study  
drug or seizure activity  recurs, the subject may  receive rescue medication at the Investigator’s 
discretion. Approximately 60 subjects will be enrolled in order to have 45 subjects (15 subjects per group) qualify ing for primary  anal ysis at up to 20 sites.
2 INTRODUCTION
Acute repetitive seizures (ARS), defined as recurrent seizures within 24 hours with recovery between seizures, are commonly  treated with either benzodiazepines, a longer-acting AED, or a 
combination of both (Lowe et al, 2000). Early effective treatment suppresses seizure activity in order to prevent the detrimental effects of acute seizure exacerbation which may  evolve into 
prolonged seizures or status epilepticus, resulting in lasting morphological and functional brain 
damage (Bergen, 2006). Benzodiazepines are effective at stopping seizure activity quickl y but 
may be rapidly redistributed or have a short duration of action which may lead to a nonsustained 
clinical effect. In addition, benzodiazepines may cause respiratory depression and sedation, potentially  leading to further complications.
The administration of longer acting AEDs may prevent recurrent seizures, improve outcomes, 
and reduce health- care costs by  reducing hospitalizations. Brivaracetam, approved in 2016 by the REDACTED COPY y seizing at the end of stud

has a half -life of 9 hours. Evidence of efficacy  of BRV in generalized seizures was shown for a 
subset of subjects with generalized epileps y in a well -controlled, flexible -dose study  (N01254). 
Positron emission tomography (PET) data from rhesus monkeys indicate that BRV penetrates the brain within minutes after iv administration (Mercier et al, 2015). In addition, data from a stud y 
conducted in patients with photoparox ysmal epilepsy  (N01069) indicate that BRV produced an 
early and lasting effect in that model, with seizure activity suppressed at the earliest observed 
time point (0.5 hours). Taken together, BRV’s profile suggests that it may act as fast as a 
benzodiazepine, protect against or prolong time to next seizure, and be better tolerated than a 
benzodiazepine with regards to sedation, cognitive impairment, and respiratory depression. 
Intravenous BRV will be administered to subjects who have periods of increased epileptic 
seizure activity  while being evaluated in an EMU. This population is comprised of subjects being 
intensively  evaluated for partial-onset, generalized-onset, or mixed seizure disorders. These 
subjects are usually  taking AEDs chronically and during the course of EMU evaluation the dose 
of 1 or more concomitant AEDs may be reduced. A subset of the EMU subjects will develop 
increased frequency  of seizures which require treatment, usually  with a benzodiazepine. Such 
study  participants will b e randomized to treatment with 1 of 2 doses of BRV or LZP, a 
benzodiazepine frequently  used as rescue medication in the EMU setting. This study  is intended 
to provide proof of concept. The efficacy  results from this study  will be used to aid selection of 
the optimal dose to evaluate in a future study in patients with ARS in the home setting.

5.1 Stud y description
Subjects admitted to an institution’s EMU for seizure characterization or noninvasive presurgical 
evaluation will be enrolled in this study . Upon admission to the EMU and after screening, the 
subject will be randoml y assigned (1:1:1) to receive a single iv dose of BRV 100mg, BRV 
200mg, or LZP. The number of subjects using levetiracitam (LEV) as concomitant AED will be 
limited to 25% of the total number of subjects who receive study drug.
Study  drug administration will begin when the Investigator or designee determines by  clinical 
observation and EEG that a seizure requiring intervention (ie, qualify ing seizu re) has started. 
Study  drug administration will begin within 30 minutes of the qualifying seizure. A qualifying 
seizure is defined as an y one of the following circumstances, requiring intervention in the 
opinion of the Investigator:
≥3 seizures per 24 hours
≥2 seizures in 6 hours 
Any generalized tonic -clonic seizure requiring intervention, as determined by the 
Investigator
The subject’s seizure activity  by clinical observation will be assessed over the next 12 hours 
following the end of study drug administration.  The dose and regimen of concomitant AEDs 
should remain stable after study drug administration during the Treatment Period unless the subject needs rescue m edication.  In addition, the subject’s cognitive impairment, vital signs, REDACTED COPY plasma concentration of BRV at 1 hour and 5 hours after the end of BRV study

Clinical Study Protocol Brivaracetam EP0087
Confidential Page 19of 665.4 Rationale for study design and selection of dose
Intravenous BRV will be administered to subjects who have periods of increased epileptic 
seizure activity  while being evaluated in an EMU. This population is comprised of subjects being 
intensively  evaluated for partial-onset, generalized-onset, or mixed seizure disorders. These 
subjects are usually  taking AEDs chronically , and during the course of EMU evaluation, the dose 
of 1 or more concomitant AEDs may be reduced. A subset of the EMU subjects will develop 
increased frequency of seizures which require t reatment, usually  with a benzodiazepine. Such 
study  participants will be randomized to treatment with BRV 100mg, BRV 200mg, or LZP, a 
benzodiazepine frequently used as rescue medication in the EMU setting. 
As noted in the approved US product information, chronic administration of BRV (25mg to 
100mg twice daily ) provides no additional benefit when added to LEV in adult patients with 
partial onset seizures.  However, it is unknown whether patients taking a stable dose of LEV or down -titrating LEV who experience seizures that require prompt treatment might benefit from 
acute administration of a higher dose of BRV (100mg or 200mg). Learning the outcome of these 
possible scenarios in the controlled environment of an EMU may be beneficial for clinicians.
The dos es of BRV selected were based on the total daily  doses in the US label and EU Summary  
of Product Characteristics, and modeling of plasma concentrations resulting from single iv doses up to 200mg. In addition, data on BRV in patients with generalized seizures were considered 
from the Phase 3 stud y N01254.
The safet y and tolerability of iv administration of BRV 100mg bid has been evaluated in a 
Phase 3 study  (N01258) in patients with epilepsy . Treatment with iv BRV (both bolus and 
infusion: 100mg bid) was well- tolerated.

For an y treatment other than the investigational product, including over- the-counter products, an 
accurate record must be kept in the clinic chart (source documentation) and in the eCRF. This 
record should include the name of the drug (preferably the brand name), the dose, the date(s) of administration, and the indication for use.
7.8.1 Permitted concomitant treatments (medications and therapies)
Concomitant medications per the EMU’s standard of care are permitted during the stud y. If 
receiving Concomitant AEDs, treatment should be kept stable after IMP administration during 
the Treatment Period unless the patient needs rescue medication. Concomitant AEDs can be 
administered at the Investigator's discretion after the Treatment Period ends (12 hours after study 
drug administration). 
7.8.2 Prohibited concomitant treatments (medications and therapies)
Central nervous s ystem depressants, unless at a stable dose, should be avoided during the study ; 
however, their use is allowed based on the Investigator’s clinical judgment. 
7.8.3 Rescue medication
Rescue medication will be administered as necessary per the EMU’s standard of care. If a subject 
is to stay  in the EMU for further seizure characterization following administration of rescue 
medication, that subject may remain in the study  awaiting a qualify ing seizure. This scenario 
requires consultation with the Medical Monitor.
7.9 Blinding
This is an open- label study .
7.10 Randomization and numbering of subjects
A 1:1:1 central randomization stratified for LEV usewill be used in the trial to ensure overall 
balance across the different treatment groups (LZP, BRV 100 mg, BRV 200 mg). To enroll a 
subject (Visit 1), the Investigator or designee will contact the interactive response technology 
(IRT) and provide brief details about the subject to be enrolled. Each subject will receive a 
5-digit number assigned at screening that serves as the subject identifier throughout the stud y. 
The subject number will be required in all communication between the Investigator or designee and the IRT regarding a particular subject. Subject numbers and kit numbers will be tracked via 
the IRT. 
To randomize a subject, the Investigator or designee will contact the IRT and provide brief 
details about the subject to be randomized. The IRT will automatically inform the Investigator or designee of the subject’s randomization number. The I RT will allocate kit numbers to the subject 
based on the subject number during the course of the study. The randomization number must be 
incorporated into the eCRF.

12.1.1 Definitions
12.1.1.1 Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product that does not nec essarily  have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.
In order to ensure complete safety data collection, all AEs occurring during the study  (ie,after 
the signing of the Informed Consent form), including any pretreatment and posttreatment periods 
required b y the protocol, must be reported in the eCRF even if no IMP was taken but specific 
study  procedures were conducted. This includes all AEs not present prior to the initial visit and 
all AEs that recurred or worsened after the initial visit.
Signs or s ymptoms of the condition/disease for which the IMP is being studied should be 
recorded as AEs onl y if their nature changes considerabl y or their frequency or intensit y 
increases in a clinicall y significant manner as compared to the clinical profile known to the

Confidential Page 27of 6612.1.1.2 Serious adverse event
Once it is determined that a subject experienced an AE, the seriousness of the AE must be 
determined. An SAE must meet 1 or more of the following criteria:
Death
Life- threatening
(Life-threatening does not include a reaction that might have caused death had it occurred in 
a more severe form.)
Significant or persistent disability/incapacity
Congenital anomal y/birth defect (including that occurring in a fetus)
Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the other 
outcomes listed in the definition of serious
(Important medical events may include, but are not limited to, potential Hy ’s Law [see 
Section 12.1.1.3], allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency  room 
or at home, blood dyscrasias that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.)
Initial inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization
(A patient admitted to a hospital, even if he/she is released on the same day , meets the 
criteria for the initial inpatient hospitalization. An emergency room visit that results in 
admission to the hospital would also qualify for the initial inpatient hospitalization criteria. How ever, emergency  room visits that do not result in admission to the hospital would not 
qualify  for this criteria and, instead, should be evaluated for 1 of the other criteria in the 
definition of serious [eg, life-threatening adverse experience, important medical event].
Hospitalizations for reasons not associated with the occurrence of an AE [eg, preplanned 
surgery  or elective surgery  for a pre -existing condition that has not worsened or manifested 
in an unusual or uncharacteristic manner] do not qualify  for reporting. For example, if a 
subject has a condition recorded on his/her medical history and later has a preplanned surgery 
for this condition, it is not appropriate to record the surgery or hospitalization as an SAE, 
since there is no AE upon which to assess the serious criteria. Please note that, if the pre-existing condition has worsened or manifested in an unusual or uncharacteristic manner, 
this would then qualify as an AE and, if necessary, the seriousness of the event would need to be determined.)

The following list of Anticipated SAEs has been identified, as these events are anticipated to 
occur in the population studied in this protocol at some frequency that is independent of drug

When recording an AE, the Investigator should use the ove rall diagnosis or sy ndrome using 
standard medical terminology, rather than recording individual symptoms or signs. The eCRF 
and source documents should be consistent. Any discrepancies between the subject’s own words 
on his/her own records (eg, diary  card) and the corresponding medical terminology  should be 
clarified in the source documentation.
Details for completion of the Adverse Event eCRF (including judgment of relationship to IMP) 
are described in the eCRF Completion Guidelines.
12.1.2.2 Rule for repetition of an adverse event
An increase in the intensity of an AE should lead to the repetition of the AE being reported with:
The outcome date of the first AE that is not related to the natural course of the disease being 
the same as the start date of the repeated AE, and the outcome of “worsening”
The AE verbatim term being the same for the first and repeated AE, so that the repeated AE 
can be easily identified as the worsening of the first one
12.1.2.3 Additional procedures for reporting serious adverse events
If an SAE is reported, UCB must be informed within 24 hours of receipt of this information by 
the site (see contact information for SAE reporting listed in the Serious Adverse Event Reporting section at the front of the protocol). The Investigator must forward to UCB (or its representative) 
a duly  completed “Investigator SAE Report Form for Development Drug” (SAE Report form) 
provided by UCB, even if the data are incomplete, or if it is obvious that more data will be 
needed in order to draw any conclusions. Information recorded on this form will be entered into 
the global safet y database.
An Investigator SAE report form will be provided to the Investigator. The Investigator SAE 
Report form must be completed in English. 
It is important for the Investigator, when completing the SAE Report form, to include the 
assessment as to a causal relationship between the SAE and the IMP administration. This insight from the Investigator is very  important for UCB to consider in assessing the safet y of the IMP 
and in determining whether the SAE requires reporting to the regulatory authorities in an expedited manner.
Additional information (eg, autopsy or laboratory reports) received b y the Investigator must be 
provided within 24 hours. All documents in the local language must be accompa nied by  a 
translation in English, or the relevant information included in the same document must be 
summarized in the I nvestigator SAE Report form.
The Investigator is specifically requested to collect and report to UCB (or its representative) any SAEs (even if the Investigator is certain that they are in no way associated with the IMP), up to 
30 days from the end of the study  for each subject, and to also inform participating subjects of 
the need to inform the Investigator of any SAE within this period. Serious AEs that the REDACTED COPY can be easily identified as the worsening of the first one

Confidential Page 30of 66Investigator thinks may be associated with the IMP must be reported to UCB regardless of the 
time between the event and the end of the stud y.
Upon receipt of the SAE Report form, UCB will perform an assessment of expectedness of the reported SAE. The assessment of the expectedness of the SAE is based on the IB.
12.1.3 Follow up of adverse events
An AE should be followed until it has resolved, has a stable sequelae, the investigator 
determines that it is no longer clinicall y significant, or the subject is lost to follow up. This 
follow-up requirement applies to AEs, SAEs, and AEs of special interest, except for cases of Hy’s Law which have been identified prior to treatment initiation, where the follow up for the 
subject is transferred to the primary  healthcare professional.   
If an AE is ongoing at the end of the study for a subject, follow up should be provided until resolution/stable level of sequelae is achieved, or until the Investigator no longer deems that it is 
clinically  significant, or until the subject is lost to follow up. If no follow up is provided, the 
Investigator must provide a justification. The follow up will usually  be continued for 30 days 
after the subject has discontinued his/her I MP.
Information on SAEs obtained after clinical database lock will be captured through the Patient 
Safety  (PS) database without limitation of time.
12.1.4 Pregnancy
If an Investigator is notified that a subject has become pregnant after the first intake of an y IMP, 
the Investigator must immediately  notify  UCB’s PS department by  providing the completed 
Pregnancy  Report and Outcome form (for contact details see Serious Adverse Event reporting 
information at the beginning of this protocol). The subject should be withdrawn from the stud y 
as soon as pregnancy  isknown (by  positive pregnancy test), and the following should be 
completed:
Safety Follow -Up assessments should be conducted 24 hours after the subject has 
discontinued her IMP.
The Investigator must inform the subject of information currently known about potential risks 
and about available treatment alternatives.
The pregnancy will be documented on the Pregnancy  Report and Outcome form provided to the 
Investigator. The progression of the pregnancy and the eventual birth (if applicable) must be 
followed up using the Pregnancy  Report and Outcome form in which the Investigator has to 
report on the health of the mother and of the child. Every reasonable attempt should be made to 
follow the health of the child for 30 day s after birth for any  significant medical issues. In certain 
circumstances, UCB may request that follow up is continued for a period longer than 30 day s. If 
the subject is lost to follow up and/or refuses to give information, written documentation of attempts to contact the subject needs to be pro vided by  the Investigator and filed at the site. 
UCB’s PS department is the primary  contact for any  questions related to the data collection for 
the pregnancy , eventual birth, and follow up.
In cases where the partner of a male subject enrolled in a clinic al study  becomes pregnant, the 
Investigator or designee is asked to contact the subject to request consent of the partner via the 
Partner Pregnancy Consent form that has been approved by  the responsible IRB/IEC and should REDACTED COPY If an Investigator is notified that a subject has become pregnant after the first intake of an

Investigator may  contact the UCB/contract research organization (CRO) contract monitor for the 
study . The Investigator will complete the Pregnancy Report and Outcome form and send it to 
UCB’s PS department (for contact details see Serious Adverse Event reporting information at the 
beginning of this protocol) only after the partner has agreed that additional information can be 
captured and has provided the signed Partner Pregnancy Consent form. UCB’s PS department is 
also the primary  contact for any  questions related to the data collection for the partner pregnancy, 
eventual birth, and follow up.
A pregnancy  becomes a serious adverse event (SAE) in the following circumstances: 
miscarriage, abortion (elective or spontaneous), unintended pregnancy after hormonal 
contraceptive failure (if the hormonal contraceptive was correctly  used), ectopic pregnancy , fetal 
demise, or an y congenital anomaly /birth defect of the baby. Those SAEs must be additionally  
reported using the Investigator SAE Report form.
12.1.5 Suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal 
product
For the purposes of reporting, any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal 
product should be considered as an SAE; such cases must be reported immediatel y, recorded in 
the AE module of the eCRF, and followed as an y other SAE. Any organism, virus, or infectious 
particle (eg, prion protein transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is considered an infectious agent.
12.1.6 Overdose of investigational medicinal product
Excessive dosing (beyond that prescribed in the protocol and including overdose) should be 
recorded in the eCRF. Any SAE or nonserious AE associated with excessive dosing must be 
followed as an y other SAE or nonserious AE. These events are onl y considered AEs or SAEs if 
there are associated clinical signs and s ymptoms or if the act of taking the excess medicine itself 
is an AE or SAE (eg, suicide attempt).
12.1.7 Safety  signal detect ion
Selected data from this study  will be reviewed periodically  to detect as earl y as possible an y 
safet y concern(s) related to the I MP so that Investigators, clinical study subjects, regulatory  
authorities, and IRBs/IECs will be informed appropriately  and as early as possible.
The Study  Physician or medically  qualified designee/equivalent will conduct an ongoing review 
of SAEs and perform ongoing SAE reconciliations in collaboration with the PS representative.
As appropriate for the stage of development an d accumulated experience with the IMP, 
medically qualified personnel at UCB may identify additional safet y measures (eg, AEs, vital 
signs, laboratory  or ECG results) for which data will be periodically reviewed during the course 
of the study .

13 STUDY M ANAG EMENT A NDADM INISTRATION 
13.1 Adherence to protocol
The Investigator should not deviate from the protocol. However, the Investigator should take any 
measure necessary  in deviation from or not defined by  the protocol in order to protect clinical 
study  subjects from any  immediate hazard to their health and safet y. In this case, this action 
should be taken immediately , without prior notification of the regulatory  authority ,IRB/IEC, or 
sponsor.
After implementation of such measure, the Investigator must notify the Clinical Project Manager 
(CPM) of the sponsor within 24 hours and follow any  local regulatory  requirements.
13.2 Monitoring
UCB (or designee) will monitor the study to meet the sponsor’s monitoring Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), I CH-GCP guideline, and applicable regulatory requirements, and to ensure 
that study  initiation, conduct, and closure are adequate. Monitoring of the study  may  be 
delegated b y UC B to a CRO or a contract monitor.
The Investigator and his/her staff are expected to cooperate with UCB (or designee) and to be available during the monitoring visits to answer questions sufficiently  and to provide any  
missing information. The Investigator(s)/institution(s) will permit direct access to source data/documents for stud y-related monitoring, audits, I RB/IEC review, and regulatory 
inspection(s).
The Investigator will allow UCB (or designee) to periodicall y review all eCRFs and 
corresponding source documents (eg, hospital and laboratory records for each study  participant). 
Monitoring visits will provide UCB (or designee) with the opportunity to evaluate the progress 
of the study , verify  the accuracy  and completeness of eCRFs, ensure that all protocol 
requirements, applicable aut horities regulations, and I nvestigator’s obligations are being 
fulfilled, and resolve an y inconsistencies in the study records.
13.2.1 Definition of source data 
All source documents must be accurate, clear, unambiguous, permanent, and capable of being 
audited. T hey should be made using some permanent form of recording (ink, typing, printing, 
optical disc). They should not be obscured by correction fluid or have temporary  attachments 
(such as removable self-stick notes). Photocopies and/or printouts of eCRFs are not considered acceptable source documents. 
Source documents are original records in which raw data are first recorded. These may include 
hospital/clinic/general practitioner records, charts, diaries, x- rays, laboratory  results, printouts, 
pharmacy records, care records, ECG or other printouts, completed scales, or quality  of life 
questionnaires, for example. Source documents should be kept in a secure, limited access area.
Source documents that are computer generated and stored electronicall y must be print ed for 
review b y the monitor (eg, ECG reports). Once printed, these copies should be signed and dated 
by the Investigator and become a permanent part of the subject’s source documents. The REDACTED COPY The Investigator and his/her staff are expected to cooperate with UCB (or designee) and to be

Clinical Study Protocol Brivaracetam EP0087
Confidential Page 36of 6613.4 Termination of the study
UCB reserves the right to temporaril y suspend or prematurel y discontinue this study  either at a 
single site, multiple sites, or at all sites at any time for reasons including, but not limited to, 
safet y or ethical issues, inaccurate or incomplete data recording, noncompliance, or 
unsatisfactory  enrollment with respect to qualit y or quantity.
If the stud y is prematurely terminated or sus pended, UCB (or its representative) will inform the 
Investigators/institutions and the regulatory  authority (ies) of the termination or suspension and 
the reason(s) for the termination or suspension, in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirement(s). The IRB/IEC should also be informed and provided with reason(s) for the 
termination or suspension by  the sponsor or by  the Investigator/institution, as specified b y the 
applicable regulatory  requirement(s). In addition, arrangements will be made for the re turn of all 
unused IMP and other material in accordance with UCB procedures for the study.
13.5 Archiving and data retention
The Investigator will maintain adequate records for the study, including eCRFs, medical records, laboratory  results, I nformed Consent do cuments, drug dispensing and disposition records, safety 
reports, information regarding participants who discontinued, and other pertinent data.
All essential documents are to be retained by the Investigator until at least 2 y ears after the last 
approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications in an I CH region, or at least 2 y ears have elapsed since the 
formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IMP. These documents should be retained 
for a longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirement(s) or b y an 
agreement with UCB (CPMP/I CH/135/95, 2002 [Section 4.9.5]). The I nvestigator will contact 
UCB for authorization prior to the destruction of any  study records or in the event of accidental 
loss or destruction of any study records. The Investigator will also notify UCB should he/she relocate or move the study-related files to a location other than that specified in the sponsor’s 
trial master file.
13.6 Audit and inspection
The Investigator will permit study-related audits mandated b y UCB, after reasonable notice, and 
inspections by  domestic or foreign regulatory  authorities.
The main purposes of an audit or inspection are to confirm that the rights and well-being of the 
subjects enrolled have been protected, that enrolled subjects (ie, signing consent and undergoing 
study  procedures) are appropriate for the study, and that all data relevant for the evaluation of the 
IMP have been processed and reported in compliance with the planned arrangements, the 
protocol, investigational site, and I RB/IEC SOPs, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory  
requirements.
The Investigator will provide direct access to all study documents, source records, and source 
data. If an inspection by  a regulatory  authority  is announced, the Investigator will immediately  
inform UCB (or designee).

14 STATISTICS
A description of statistical methods follows and will be described in more detail in the Statistical 
Analy sis Plan.
14.1 Definition of analy sis sets
The Randomized Set (RS) will consist of all subjects who are randomized.
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Set will consist of all randomized subjects who receive the stud y drug.
The Per- Protocol (PP) Set will consist of all subjects in the ITT Set who did not have any  
important protocol deviations determined to impact the interpretation of the primary  efficacy  
analysis.
All efficacy  and safety analyses will be carried out using the ITT Set. Selected supportive 
efficacy  anal yses will be carried out using the PP Set.
14.2 General statistical considerations
Descriptive statistics, such as the mean, standard deviation (SD), median, 25thpercentile, 
75thpercentile, minimum value, and maximum value for quantitative variables, and counts and 
percentages for categorical variables, will be provided. Key supporting data will be provided in 
data listings. All statistical testing will be carried out at a 2-sided 0.05 significance level unless otherwise indicated.
Statistical outliers are defined as values that are discordant with other values and are clinicall y 
implausible. Exclusion of outliers from an anal ysis requires thorough justification based on 
statistical and clinical grounds. I n such cases, unless otherwise specified, the anal ysis will be run 
both with and without the values. Any outliers will be reviewed during data review.
14.3 Planned efficacy  analy ses
14.3.1 Analysis of the primary  efficacy  variable
Time to next seizure (per clinical observation with EEG confirmation) or rescue medication, 
representing treatment failure, from the end of study drug administration to 12 hours after the end of study  drug administration will be compared between each BRV arm and LZP using 
survival anal ysis methods; if the sample size is sufficient, a subgroup anal ysis using strata may 
be performed.
14.3.2 Other efficacy  analy ses
Time to next seizure (per clinical observation) or rescue medication from the end of study  drug 
administration to 12 hours after the end of stud y drug admin istration will be compared between 
each BRV arm and LZP using survival analysis methods.Seizure freedom rates at 6 hours, 8 hours, and 12 hours after the end of study drug administration

Confidential Page 61of 6618.2 Protocol A mendment 1
The purpose of Amendment 1 was to clarify assessments and procedures, such as ECG, vital 
signs, reporting of adverse events of special interest, and the SAGE. In addition, qualify ing 
seizures were further defined , the study  contact information was updated, and allowance was 
made for enrollment of some subjects taking LEV. Amendment 1 also includes blood sampling at up to 4 time points after study drug administration; 2 time points for BRV bioavailability analysis and epilepsy biomarker assay development, as well as 2 more optional blood samples 
for assay refinement.
The major specific changes are detailed in Table 18‒1. Some minor text changes or deletions to 
improve readability are not summarized.

Section 5.1 Timing of study drug 
administration relative to 
the qualifying seizure; 
clarification of the qualifying seizure 
definition, timing of re-
introduction of AEDsThe study drug administration will begin 
within 30 minutes of the 
qualifying seizure, which 
is defined as any one of 
the following: ≥3 seizures 
per 24 hours; ≥2 seizures 
in 6 hours; any 
generalized tonic -clonic 
seizure requiring 
intervention, as 
determined by the 
Investigator. If rescue 
medication is 
administered, AEDs can 
be re-introduced once the 
subject is in the SFU 
Period.Clarification
Section 5.4 Gives rationale for study 
design and selection of 
doseAddition of language 
justifying concomitant 
LEV in some subjects.As noted in the approved 
US product information, chronic administration of 
BRV (25mg to 100mg twice daily) provides no additional benefit when 
added to LEV in adult 
patients with partial onset seizures.  However, it is 
unknown whether patients 
taking a stable dose of LEV or down -titrating 
LEV who experience seizures that require 
prompt treatment might 
benefit from acute 
administration of a higher dose of BRV (100mg or 
200mg). Learning the 
outcome of these possible scenarios in the controlled 
environment of an EMU 
may be beneficial for 
clinicians.REDACTED COPY Addition of language

Section 6.2 Exclusion Criterion 3: 
Subject has taken BRV or LEV in the 21 days prior 
to EMU admissionExclusion Criterion 3: Subject has taken BRV or 
LEV in the 21 days prior 
to EMU admissionAs noted in the approved

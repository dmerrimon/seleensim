OBJECTIVES  
To determine the safety and efficacy of repeated administration of intrathecal injections (doses) of NurOwn® 
(MSC -NTF: autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells [MSC] Secreting Neurotrophic Factors [NTF]) given three 
times at two monthly intervals to participants with Progressive MS.  
Primary : 
• To evaluate safety and tolerability of 3 intrathecal (IT) doses of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)   
Secondary :  
• To evaluate the efficacy of NurOwn® using improvement in either Timed 25 -foot walk (T25FW) speed 
or 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT)  
• To evaluate the modulation of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) and blood biomarkers (neurotrophic factors, 
neurodegenerative, and inflammatory biomarkers) following NurOwn® transplan tation  
• To evaluate the efficacy of NurOwn® using : 
• The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).  
• The 12 item MS Walking Scale (MSWS -12) 
• Physical  function ( including  average daily step count using a wrist wearable sensor)  
• Low Contrast Letter Acuity (LCLA)  
• Symbol Digit Modalit ies Test (SDMT)  
• MSFC Composite scores  
METHODOLOGY  
Study Design  This is an open -label study with a single treatment arm involving 20 participants with 
progressive MS at multiple investigational study sites.  After providing informed consent, 
participants meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled and 1- 4 weeks later 
will undergo a bone -marrow aspiration (BMA). The first IT transplantation will be at Visit 3 
(Day  0), 6-10 weeks after screening/enrol lment visit, with the subsequent transplantations at 
Visit 4 (Week 8) and Visit 5 (Week 16). Following the third and last treatment, participants 
will be followed for 12 weeks with two additional visits, approximately 6  weeks apart.

ASSESSMENTS  
Safety  Changes in vital signs and physical examination findings, hematology, blood chemistry, 
urinalysis, AEs, and changes in concomitant medications. New MRI lesions (new - or 
newly enlarging – T1 and T2 weig hted images  will be evaluated for safety).  
Efficacy  Efficacy assessments will be based upon: T25FW, 9-HPT , blood and CSF biomarkers , 
EDSS, MSWS -12, Physical  function measured with wearable sensor, LCLA, and SDMT.  
The efficacy endpoints are further described in the statistical section below.  
Biomarkers  Paired CSF samples and serum samples will be collected prior to each intrathecal 
administration of MSC -NTF cells. CSF and/or blood samples will be evaluated for lev els of 
disease and other relevant biomarkers (such as neurotrophic and inflammatory factors, 
miRNAs and other relevant cytokines) and their potential relation to efficacy outcomes.

Confidential  DATA SAFETY MONITORING BOARD  
DSMB  An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established for the study. The 
DSMB will review key safety and efficacy data (at intervals and as requested) as outlined in 
the DSMB charter.  
STATISTICAL METHODS AND ANALYSIS  
Sample Size 
Calculation  No formal sample size calculation is performed. Efficacy and safety data in the 20 
participants will provide information to inform the design of a future randomized study.  
Efficacy  Efficacy analyses will be performed using the modified intent to treat  (mITT) and Efficacy 
Evaluable  (EE) populations. The mITT population will be defined as all participants who 
received at least one treatment and had a t least one  T25FW or a 9HPT assessment post 
treatment. The EE population will be defined as a subset of the mITT popul ation that 
receive all 3 treatments and do not have any important protocol deviations impacting 
efficacy evaluation.  If the EE population is identical or very similar to the mITT population, 
analyses may only be generated for the mITT population.  
Efficacy assessments will be based upon, T25FW, 9-HPT, blood and CSF biomarkers, 
EDSS , MSWS -12, Physical  function measured with wearable sensor outputs LCLA and 
SDMT.  
Efficacy analyses of continuous data will be based upon change from baseline to each post -
baseline  timepoint. Baseline will be defined as the last measurement prior to the first 
treatment.  
Responder analyses will compare the proportion of responders using various definitions of 
responders for the different efficacy endpoints . 
Safety  All safety analyses will be conducted on the Safety Population, which will be defined as all 
participants who were enrolled and had at least one transplantation performed.  
Only observed data will be analyzed and no imputations will be performed for any missing 
safety  data.  
Safety analysis of continuous data will be based upon change from baseline to each post -
baseline timepoint.  Baseline will be defined as the last measurement prior to the first 
treatment.  
Abnormalities in hematology, blood chemistry , MRI  and electr ocardiogram ( ECG ) 
assessment will be summarized.  
Biomarkers  
 Paired CSF and blood samples will be analyzed for the disease relevant biomarkers and 
their relationship to efficacy outcomes. In addition, relationships between neurotrophic 
factors, inflammat ory markers, miRNAs and clinical outcomes will be evaluated to 
determine if any biomarkers can be predictive of treatment outcome.

Confidential  1. INTRODUCTION  
Multiple sclerosis (MS) may be caused by an autoimmune response to self -antigens in a genetically 
susceptible  individual.  Symptoms of MS usually appear between the ages of 20 and 40 and affect 
1 million individuals in the US.  Approximately 50% of MS patients eventually develop 
progressive disease  associated with increasing levels of motor, visual and cognitive functional 
impairment and disability.  Progressive MS can occur at disease onset (primary progressive) or 
more commonly be preceded by a relaps ing disease course (secondary progressive)1,2. The loss of 
mobility and accumulating neurological dysfunction has an enormous impact on social 
functioning, activities of daily living, employment and socioeconomic status3.   
In progressive MS, the long -term accumulation of brain injury caused by inflammation, 
demyelination, axonal damage, neuronal degeneration and gliosis in both white and gray matter, 
is currently without effective therapy.  While inflammatory mechanisms predominate in the early 
stages of t he disease, reflected most directly in relapses and Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI )-
detected lesion activity, in progressive MS there is gradual worsening of disability and 
neurodegeneration that progresses independent of relapses.  Central nervous system  (CNS) repair 
processes do exist in MS; however, they are not able to fully compensate for the damage that is 
ongoing in most patients.  
Currently approved MS treatments primarily target CNS inflammation and are most effective 
when introduced early in the disease course, before the progressive phase of disease has started 
and in patients with significant inflammation as measured by standard brain MRI parameters1. 
Treatment strategies to prevent tissue damage or increase repair, remyelination and axonal 
regeneration, are greatly needed. Cell therapies, due to their combined immunomodulatory, 
neuroprotective and neuro -regenerative properties, make them an attractive candidate therapy.  
BrainStorm has developed a proprietary process based on autologous Mesenchym al Stem Cells 
(MSC) which are propagated ex-vivo and induced to differentiate into neurotrophic factor (NTF) 
secreting cells, designated MSC -NTF cells (NurOwn®).  A repeat dose randomized (1:1) placebo -
controlled US phase 3 study of NurOwn® in 200 ALS pati ents is currently underway.  Study 
participants are receiving 3 intrathecal administrations of cells or placebo 2 months apart.  Three 
previous ALS studies have demonstrated the feasibility, safety and tolerability of intrathecal 
administration of NurOwn® and a well characterized safety profile.  
The intrinsic immunomodulatory properties of MSC -NTF cells, the potential of neurotrophic 
factors to promote neuronal repair and remyelination, the ease of access of intrathecally 
administered MSC -NTF cells to area s of the brain and spinal cord, and the documented and 
growing NurOwn® safety experience in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS ), makes intrathecal 
repeated administration of NurOwn® an attractive treatment candidate to evaluate in an open label 
study in progressive MS  patients.

Confidential  Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are potent survival factors for embryonic, neonatal, and adult neurons 
and are considered potential therapeutic candidates for MS. Delivery of multiple NTFs to the 
immediate environment of afflicted neurons in MS patients is expected to improve their survival 
and thus slow down disease progression and alleviate symptoms. NTF -secreting mesenchymal 
stem cells (MSC -NTF cells) are a nove l cell -therapeutic approach aimed at effectively delivering 
NTFs directly to the site of damage in MS patients.  
The NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) therapy is based on transplantation of autologous bone marrow 
derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), which are enrich ed from the patient’s own bone marrow, 
propagated ex-vivo and induced to secrete NTFs such as Glial Derived Growth Factor (GDNF) 
and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and 
Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF). The  autologous NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) are back -
transplanted into the ALS patient into the sites of damage, the spinal cord and/or the muscles, 
where axon terminals are expected to take up the neurotrophic factors secreted by the transplanted 
cells.  
NurOwn®, delivered by repeat intrathecal administration every 2 months, has the potential to 
address the unmet need in progressive MS through its unique combination of immunomodulation 
and neurotrophic factor support delivered directly to the areas of injury withi n the brain and spinal 
cord.  It is expected that study biomarkers may potentially inform the issue of duration of NurOwn® 
therapy and selection of optimal responders.  
NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) has been evaluated in two open label clinical studies and in several 
compassionate treated patients.  
The first two open label studies, carried out at the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, Israel 
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT0105 1882 and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), as well as the 8 compassionate 
treatments, confirmed the treatment was safe and well tolerated either by the intrathecal ( IT) or by 
the intramuscular ( IM) route of administration as well as by the combined IT and IM 
administration, a nd showed some initial indications of efficacy, when administered to patients with 
ALS, slowing the slope of disease progression.  
The Phase 1/2 first -in-man study evaluated the safety of a single initial dose of NurOwn® (MSC -
NTF cell) administered by two d ifferent routes. NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) were administered 
intramuscularly in a cohort of 6 early stage ALS patients ( ALS Functional Rating Scale –Revised , 
ALSFRS -R score ≥25) and intrathecally in 6 ALS patients with more progressive disease 
(ALSFRS -R score 15 -30) and insufficient muscle bulk. The 6 patients with early stage ALS 
received 24 IM injections of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) (~1 x 106 cells/site into 24 sites along 
the biceps and triceps muscles of one arm for a total of ~24x106 cells/pa tient), and the 6 patients 
with more progressive disease received NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) by IT administration (one 
dose of 1 x 106 NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)/kg of body weight). This study established the safety 
of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) administration via IT and IM at these IM and IT doses.  
The first Phase 2 trial was a dose -escalating study in three cohorts of 4 early -stage ALS patients 
(ALSFRS -R score ≥30) aimed at evaluating safety and collecting efficacy data of the combined 
IT and IM administration. Th e three patient cohorts received the initial Phase 1/2 dose, a 1.5-fold, 
and a 2 -fold dose respectively by combined IT and IM administration. This study established the 
higher doses to be safe and showed early signs of change in slope in the ALSFRS -R post -treatment 
compared to the slope pre -treatment.

Confidential  In both these studies, patients were followed for 3 months before and 6 months after 
transplantation. Additional outcome measures in these studies included change in: muscle strength 
grading (maximal voluntar y isometric contraction [MVIC]) by grip, forced vital capacity (FVC 
%), muscle bulk estimated by MRI of the upper extremities, upper and lower extremities 
circumference, electromyography (EMG) parameters 1. 
The second Phase 2a trial was a multicenter study conducted in U.S in 48 patients with early ALS 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) administered as single dose 
through a combination of IT and IM routes at a dose of 100 x 106 to 125 x 106 cells compared to 
placebo. The safety pr ofile of the single dose of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) showed it was well 
tolerated with majority of AEs being mild or moderate. In this study a s ignificant improvement 
was observed in the total ALSFRS -R scores based upon percent improvement in slope, 
post-transplantation compared to pre -transplantation in a pre -specified subgroup of rapid 
progressors.   
The purpose of the proposed BCT -101-US Phase 2 study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
three successive administrations of intrathecal injections of Nu rOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) given 
every two months to participants with progressive MS (EDSS 3 -6.5 at the Screening Visit). The 
clinical efficacy endpoints  (Timed 25 -Foot Walk  [T25FW], 9 -Hole Peg Test [9-HPT] , Expanded 
Disability Status Scale [EDSS], 12 item MS walking scale [MSWS -12], Physical function 
measured with  wearable sensor outputs, Low Contrast Letter Acuity [LCLA], and Symbol Digit

2. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN   
2.1. OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN   
This will be th e fifth clinical study conducted by Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics to study autologous 
NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) in a neuro degenerative  disease.  
The first three completed studies (two open label and one placebo -controlled study) in ALS patents 
demonstrated the safety of a single dose of NurOwn® administered either intramuscularly or 
intrathecally or by combined IM and IT administration.  
The ongoing Phase 3 double blind placebo -controlled  study for 200 ALS patients (randomized 
1:1) will evaluate the safety and efficacy of three repeat transplantation s, 2 months apart.  
This is a proof -of concept Phase 2 open label study that will be conducted in 20 participants with 
progressive MS with EDSS 3.0 -6.5 at the Screening V isit, at multiple study sites. After providing 
informed consent and signing a written informed consent document all participants will be 
observed for a total of 9-10 months (3 8 weeks).  
During the up to 10 -week  pretreatment period patients will be screened  and eligibility determined. 
Approximately 1-4 weeks after the screening visit , bone marrow will be harvested  and transferred 
to the cell manufacturing facility for the isolati on and cryopreserv ation of  autologous MSC s. Prior 
to each treatment , MSC will be thawed, cultured and induced to differentiate into MSC -NTF cells. 
A dose of ~125 x 106 MSC -NTF cells will be administered at each treatment. At the time of 
consent, participants will be informed that they may not receive the transplant in case  their 
autologous bone marrow fails to grow and reach the adequate numbers of MSC and/or MSC -NTF 
cells. The autologous manufacturing  process is on a per -subject basis and begins upon fresh bone 
marrow aspirate arrival to the cleanroom facility and is compl eted once the cells are ready for 
transplantation.  
The first transplantation visit (T1) will occur  approximately 6 weeks after the bone marrow 
aspiration visit ( 6-10 weeks after screening /enrollment ). The subsequent transplantation visits (T2 
and T3, at v isits 4 and 5) will follow interspaced by approximately 8 weeks (±14 days)  each ( Figure 
1). The patients will then be followed for 12 additional weeks after the last transplant visit (T3) at 
two additional visits, approximately 6 weeks apart . 
Assessments and procedures that will b e performed during the study are provided in Table 1 and 
Table 2 . Following the third and last treatment , participants will be followed for two additional 
monthly visits (through week 28) during which the T25FW , 9HPT  and other study outcomes will

AEs (see schedule of assessments (SOA) in  Table 1)  
2.2. STUDY SCHEMATIC  
The study comprises a n up to 10-week pre -treatment period, a n approximately 16 -week  treatment 
period, during which three transplantations will be performed followed by a 12 -week post -
treatment follow -up period  (Figure 1).  
Participants' bone marrow will be aspirated approximately 1-4 weeks following the first screening 
visit. The MSC isolation and cell propagation processes will last about 5 -6 weeks and will  be 
followed by NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) transplantation.  
At each transplantation visits, participants will be admitted to an inpatient study unit for study 
procedures and will be followed for up to 24 hours post transplantation.  
Following each treatment,  participants will be assessed at visits described in  
. After receiving the third treatment dose ( approximately 16 weeks after the first transplantation), 
all participants will be followed for 12 weeks for evaluation of key efficacy and safety assessments.   
Each participant will thus be followed for a total of about 38 weeks ( 9-10 months) from the first 
visit ( Figure 1).

Confidential  2.3. TREATMENT PLAN  
2.3.1.  Bone Marrow aspiration procedure  
Human bone marrow will be aspirated by a credentialed health care provider as per Medical Centre 
standard procedures, bilaterally from multiple punctures of the iliac crest of the pelvic bone of 
participants into 20 mL syringes prefilled with approximately 1 mL of a Heparin -containing 
solution (Heparin Solution, USP, 350 units/mL) in PlasmaLyte. A Transfer Pack container  – 600 
mL bag, containing Heparin will be pre -labelled. The bone marrow aspirated from each single 
puncture (~5 ml), will be injected into the bag. Immediately after bone marrow from each syringe 
is injected into the bag, the bag will be thoroughly mixed twice to avoid clotting of the bone 
marrow sample.  
A total of 80 to 100 mL of bone marrow will be aspirated from each participant.  
2.3.2.  Intrathecal Transplant Procedure  
Participants will undergo a standard lumbar puncture followed by IT injection of cells . 
When performing the IT transplantation of NurOwn® (MSC-NTF cells), the participant is 
typically placed in a left (or right) lateral position with his/her neck bent in full flexion and knees 
bent in full flexion up to his/her chest, approximating a fetal position as much as possible. 
Alternatively, t he patie nt may be placed in a prone position .  
Prior to IT injections the syringe sh ould be gently rotated for 20 -30 seconds until all cells are in 
suspension.  
The spinal needle is inserted into the patient only once the cells are fully resuspended (in 
suspension ). 
The area around the lower back is prepped using aseptic technique. A 20 G spinal needle (such as: 
BD Cat. No. 405253) is inserted between the lumbar vertebrae L3/L4 or L4/L5 to a depth at which 
there is a “give” indicating that the needle is past the ligamentum flavum.  
The needle is inserted further until there is a second ‘give’, indicating that the needle is now past 
the dura mater and in the subarachnoid space.  
The stylet from the spinal needle is then withdrawn for collecting about 5ml of CSF  eithe r directly 
from the spinal needle or after connecting a  3-way stopcock (such as Elcam Medical Cat. No. 
582682) to the spinal needle .  
Prior to the IT injection gently remove the syringe cap, with the syringe in the upright position. 
Slowly and carefully, p ush plunger up, until the cell suspension reaches the top of the syringe.  
Connect syringe to the 3-way stopcock , and inject the cells over at least 2 minutes.  
Approximately 1 mL of the previously collected CSF is injected, “washing” the spinal needle and  
ensuring that the entire cell suspension is transplanted into the subject.  
The procedure is completed by withdrawing the needle and immediately placing pressure on the 
puncture site.  
The participant is typically asked to lie on his/her back for at least 2 hours, in a Trendelenburg 
position and is monitored for signs of neurological problems.

Confidential  2.4. DURATION OF STUDY  
Participants will be screened and eligible participants will be enrolled  and will undergo viral safety 
testing within 7 days of the scheduled Bone Marrow Aspiration (BMA).  
Following aspiration, MSC will be isolated, propagated for about 2 weeks and cryopreserved. 
About 2 weeks prior to each treatment, MSC will be thawed, propagated and induced into MSC -
NTF cells. Participants will undergo IT administration  of NurOwn ® (MSC -NTF cells) on Day  0 
(Visit 3), Week 8 (Visit 4) and Week 16 (Visit 5). Following each cell transplantation, participants 
will be monitored as inpatients for a period of up to  24 hours. Participants will be discharged after 
up to 24 hours unless a clinical AE(s) occurs and requires continued inpatient monitoring and/or 
treatment. After the last dose, participants will be followed for approximately 12 weeks for efficacy 
and safety assessment. Each subject’s participation in the s tudy will last for approximately 38 
weeks.  
2.5. DISCUSSION OF DOSE  
The IT transplantation dose (~125 x106 cells) is the dose of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) that has 
been safely administered in the previous clinical trials in ALS study participants.

GROUP  
N/A. 
3. PATIENT POPULATION  
This study will be conducted in participants with a clinical diagnosis of Progressive MS (Primary 
and Secondary) with Diagnosis of MS based on the 2017 revised MacDonald C riteria1 and EDSS 
3.0-6.5, inclusive  and have confirmation by the investigator that the disease has entered the 
progressive phase  for at least 6 months prior to enrollment .  
This study will include primary (PPMS) and secondary progressive (SPMS)  participan ts, as 
abundant clinical, imaging, and genetic data suggest that PPMS and SPMS form part of the 
spectrum of progressive MS phenotypes, and analyses of natural history cohorts demonstrate that 
clinical characteristics and rates of clinical worsening proceed s at a similar rate in SPMS and 
PPMS  patients2. 
To be enrolled in this study, participants must meet all inclusion criteria in section 3.1 below and 
must not have any of the exclusion criteria listed in section 3.2.

4.9. SAFETY FOLLOW -UP  
All subjects who are treated or partially treated will have safety and efficacy follow -up for 
approximately 12 weeks  from last transplantation. Adverse events ( AEs) and serious adverse 
events  (SAEs)  will be followed up as described in Section 7.1.5 . For s ubjects who refuse further 
clinic study visits, telephone contact by study staff shall be attempted and documented to review 
for AEs  and medication changes .  
4.10. LOST TO FOLLOW -UP  
Every reasonable effort will be made to contact any subject apparently lost to follow -up during the 
course of the study to complete study -related assessments and record outstanding data.  
If a participant cannot be reached, the site should document that at least 3 reasonable attempts were 
made to contact the participant over a period  of 30 days from the time the site last had contact with 
the participant.   
Following 3 telephone contact attempts, an effort to contact the subject by mail using a method 
that provides proof of receipt will be attempted. Alternate contacts will be used if  the subject is 
not reachable (e.g., primary care providers, referring physician). Such efforts shall be documented 
in the subject’s source documents.  
If all efforts fail to establish contact, the subject will be considered lost to follow -up and 
documented  on the End of Study eCRF  page and , as of the date documented, the subject will be 
considered discontinued from the study . 
5. INVESTIGATIONAL PROD UCT INFORMATION  
5.1. GENERAL INFORMATION  
The cell therapy (NurOwn®) is based on the autologous transplantation of ad ult bone marrow 
derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) that are induced ex-vivo, using a medium based 
procedure, to secrete NTFs such as GDNF, BDNF, VEGF and HGF among others, and are thus 
designated MSC -NTF cells.  
MSC -NTF cells are adult stem cells that are used for autologous “Self " transplantation. There is 
no ethical or safety issue related to the  involvement of embryonic or fetal allogeneic cells. Since 
the cells are the s ubject's own cells there is no risk of rejection and no need for immunosuppressive 
agents, which can cause severe and/or long -term side effects.  
NurOwn ® (MSC -NTF cells) delivery is easy and safe by standard procedures (IT injections) and 
does not require surgical intervention.

Confidential  5.2. NUROWN® (MSC -NTF CELLS) PRO DUCT CHARACTERISTICS   
Participants’ bone marrow will be aspirated and MSC cells will be isolated from the total bone 
marrow mononuclear cell population, propagated in culture and induced to secrete NTFs. T he 
NurOwn® propagated MSC -NTF cells will then be transplanted back into the participant  as 
follow s:  
• ~125 x106 cells by I ntrathecal  administration (however, if less than 125 x 106 cells are 
available 100  x 106 cells are administered).  
The NurOwn® (MSC -NTF  cells) production process will be carried out in the absence of 
antibiotics, phenol red, and animal derived components. The production process will be cGMP 
compliant and will be performed under full environmental control, in a class 10,000 cleanroom 
(ISO 7). All cell manipulation procedures are performed in a class 100 (ISO 5) Biosafety cabinet.  
NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) will be provided in a ready -to-use subject -personalized unique 
treatment package with the appropriate primary and secondary labels. The tr eatment package 
consists of one 5 mL syringe for IT transplantation. Each treatment package consists of a ready -
for-injection syringe containing freshly harvested autologous cultured NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) 
at the dose defined in this clinical study protoc ol.  
Syringes will be capped with a stopper (not a needle). The 5 mL syringe for IT transplantation will 
be packed in a pouch.  
The treatment package will be delivered to the clinical site in a shipping system container designed 
for maintaining a temperature of 2 -8°C during shipment. The shipping system containing the 
syringes will be shipped to the clinical site. The product shall  be administered to the subject within 
the established shelf life of the product.  
The cell manufacturing  process, including the in -process controls is described in full detail in the 
Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) section and in the Investiga tor's brochure (IB).  
6. PRIOR AND CONCOMITAN T THERAPY  
6.1. PRIOR THERAPY  
Participants who received prior cell therapy of any kind will be excluded from the study (see 
Section 3.2).  
Study participants who begin an excluded medication during the study period will be discontinued 
from treatment. In order to minimize the amount and impact of missing data, study investigators 
will make all reasonable efforts to collect key efficacy and sa fety data on participants who 
discontinue treatment or discontinue from the study.  
All medications taken prior to the first transplantation will be recorded as Prior medications.  
6.2. CONCOMITANT AND EXCLUDED THERAPY   
Concomitant medications are those given to  the subject during or after the first transplantation. All 
concomitant medications will be recorded.

Confidential  Current use of immunosuppress ive medication or use of such medication within 6 months of study 
enrol lment (aside from approved B-cell immunotherapy) and a nticoagulation therapy are 
exclusionary.  
Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada), Cladribine (NDA submitted), Natalizumab (Tysabri), S1P modulators 
(such as Gilenya) high dose pulse intravenous methylprednisolone  (IVMP , 1 gram) to treat a 
relapse within the 6 months prior  to study entry or other investigative MS therapies  are 
exclusionary  due to safety considerations . However, a  single dose of IVMP 100 mg as part of the 
Ocrevus (or Rituxan) infusion protocol q6M is not exclusionary  and would be allowed in the study . 
6.3. ANTICO AGULATION  THERAPY  
Anticoagulation treatment increases the risk of bleeding -related complications associated with 
invasive procedures.  In this study the procedures of concern are the bone marrow aspiration at 
Visit 2, three stem cell transplants by lumbar puncture at visits 3, 4 and 5. Due to the risk involved 
in performing a lumbar puncture while on anticoagulation therapy it would be medically necessary 
to withhold anticoagulation prior to and immediately after any of these procedures.  
There are a number of variables that would determine individual patient risk of withholding 
anticoagulation prior to the procedure including: the indication for the anticoagulation and the type 
of anticoagulation  therapy . Consequently, the risk for study p articipants must be considered by the 
study investigator  on an individual, case -by-case basis , and a risk benefit assessment should be 
conducted, to evaluat e the risks of discontinuing anticoagulation for each subject with the potential 
benefits of partici pating in the clinical trial .   
7. SAFETY REPORTING  
For this study, AEs and SAEs will be collected from the time of informed consent  at the screening 
visit through the last study visit (Visit 7 or an Early Termination visit) as detailed in Section s 4.6.-
4.8. 
7.1. ADVERSE EVENTS DEFIN ITIONS  
Standard definitions for AEs are provided in this section for informational purposes.  
7.1.1.  Adverse Event (21 CFR 312.32(a))  
AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not consi dered drug related. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, 
without any judgment about causality.  
Within this investigation, adverse events also encompass procedurally related observations based 
upon physical examination of the patient, or laboratory assessments or spontaneously reported by 
the subject which are temporally associated with the administration of study medication.  
For adverse eve nts requiring medical interventions such as surgeries, diagnostic procedures and 
therapeutic procedures it is recommended that these be recorded as treatment of the adverse event 
or action taken rather than an additional adverse event .

Confidential  7.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event (21 CFR 312.32(a))  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” (SAE) if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening (an AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in 
the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject or subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected ad verse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death)  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization excluding:  
− A visit to the emergency room or other hospital department for <24 hours that does not 
result in admission (unless considered an important medical event or life -threatening)  
− An elective surgery planned prior to signing informed consent  
− Protocol specified admissions for planned procedures  
− Admission for social circumstance that has no bearing o n health status and requires no 
intervention (e.g., economic inadequacy, family circumstances, administrative  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defec t  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergi c bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
If it is not certain that an event meets th e above definitions of an SAE, the site Investigators will 
contact the Medical Monitor to discuss.  
7.1.3.  Relatedness (Causality)  
Investigators will assess relatedness of AEs to study drug using the following terms:  
• Definite : An AE that has a clear temporal as sociation with investigational product 
administration (e.g., within 72 hours); provides a plausible pharmacologic explanation for the 
event  
• Probable: There is a reasonable temporal association with administration of the 
investigational product; unlikely ca used by other drugs or underlying conditions  
• Possible : There is a plausible temporal association with the investigational product, but other 
etiologies are possible and relatedness to the investigational product cannot definitely be 
ruled out

Amendment 1.1 , June  2019  MSC -NTF cells (NurOwn®) Page 38 of 59 
 
Confidential  • Unlikely: The temporal association with the investigational product is implausible (but not 
impossible). The event is likely related to other drugs or conditions  
• Not Related : An AE with no temporal association with the investigational product but rather 
related to othe r etiologies such as concomitant medications or conditions or subject's known 
clinical state; subject has not received investigational product.   
7.1.4.  Severity (Intensity)  
The severity of an AE will be graded on a scale: mild, moderate, severe, as defined below :  
• Mild : Asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
• Moderate : Minimal, local or non -invasive intervention indicated; interferes with age -
appropriate activities of daily living  
• Severe : Disabling; unab le to carry out age -appropriate activities of daily living  
• Potentially Life -Threatening : Medical or operative intervention indicated to prevent 
permanent impairment, persistent disability, or death.  
7.1.5.  Follow -Up of AEs  
After the initial recording of an AE, t he Investigator shall proactively follow the subject. Any non -
serious AEs that are still on -going at the end of the study shall be reviewed to determine if further 
follow -up is required. The Investigator will document on the eCRF any/all on -going non -serio us 
AEs that will not be followed further after the subject exits the study. If in doubt, the Investigator 
shall consult the study Medical Monitor.  
All SAEs shall be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, or until the subject is 
lost to  follow -up, or otherwise explained. Once the SAE is resolved, the corresponding AE eCRF 
page shall be updated. Additionally, any relevant laboratory test reports, consultation reports from 
other health care professionals, discharge summaries, or other info rmation that has been gathered 
about the event shall be transmitted to the Sponsor.  
The Sponsor may request that the Investigator perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of 
any AE.  
7.1.6.  Outcome  
The following terms will be used during this  study:  
• Fatal  
• Not Recovered/not resolved  
• Recovering/resolving  
• Recovered/resolved  
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae  
• Unknown

Confidential  7.1.7.  Clinically Significant Laboratory Abnormalities  
Any laboratory abnormalities deemed clinically significant by the Investigator  shall be reported 
on the AE eCRF. A clinically significant abnormality is a confirmed abnormality that is changed 
sufficiently from screening visit so that in the judgment of the Investigator a change in 
management is warranted. This alteration may includ e: monitoring the laboratory test further, 
initiating other diagnostic tests or procedures, changing ongoing treatment, or administering new 
treatment. Whenever possible, the etiology of the abnormal finding (e.g., anemia) will be recorded 
on the eCRF. Rep eated additional tests and/or other evaluations required to establish the 
significance and etiology of an abnormal result shall be obtained when clinically indicated.  
7.2. REPORTING RESPONSIBI LITIES AND PROCEDURE S FOR AES AND SAES  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator or Sub -Investigator(s) to perform periodic assessment of 
all AEs/SAEs.  
A subject, who experiences an AE, whether serious or non -serious, shall receive appropriate 
treatment and medical supervision as clinically indicated. AEs/SAEs will be  followed throughout 
the subject’s participation in the study, until resolution/stabilization or until a time that is mutually 
agreed upon between the Medical Monitor and the Investigator.  
The Investigator must report to the Sponsor all SAEs within 24 hou rs of learning about the event 
regardless of relationship to study drug.  
• Site staff will complete the paper SAE report form and e -mail it within 24 hours to the 
following address: clinicalsafety@propharmagroup.com  
• In cases where the email system is unavai lable, site staff will send the SAE by fax to: 1-866-
681-1063 . 
If the SAE has not resolved at the time the Investigator submits an initial SAE report, the 
Investigator must provide a follow -up report as soon as the event resolves (or upon receipt of 
signif icant information if the event is still ongoing). Additional follow -up information must be 
reported within 24 hours of awareness following Investigator (or site) awareness of the 
information. However, the Investigator should not delay reporting an SAE in o rder to obtain 
additional information. Additional information, when available, should be reported per the 
reporting procedures described above.  
A written report is also required for all participants who died during the study. This report must 
document th e events surrounding the subject’s death and the cause of death. Attach a copy or 
summary of autopsy findings, if performed.  
All SAE reports and questions pertaining to an SAE shall be directed to responsible personnel as 
detailed in the table below:

Confidential  Any pregnancies will be followed through delivery or premature termination.  If a female subject 
(or female partner of ma le subject) becomes pregnant during the study, any complications of that 
pregnancy such as abortion (spontaneous or induced), premature birth, or congenital abnormality 
will be captured as SAEs.   
Following delivery or termination of pregnancy, the Pregnan cy Outcome Form should be 
completed.  Follow -up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal 
sequelae in the infant will be required . 
7.4. PROSPECTIVE ASSESSME NT OF THE OCCURRENCE  OF SUICIDALITY  
There is no evidence from animal or previous human studies to suggest that NurOwn® (MSC -NTF 
cells) transplantation will increase suicidal ideation or attempts; but, because these cells are 
delivered to the CSF and are active in the central nervous system, we plan to monitor suicidal 
ideation and behavior carefully during the trial.  
Suicidal ideation and behavior will be monitored using the C -SSRS  
(http://www.cssrs.columbia.edu) , as per the SOA. All study staff delivering the C -SSRS will be 
fully trained in its appropriate use and only study staff prepared to appropriately respond to 
participants exhibiting suicidal ideation or behavior will deliver the scale. The ‘Baseline’ 
questionnaire will be given at the Screening/Visit. The ‘Since Last Visit’ questionnaire will be 
given at the 28 -week visit  (Visit 7, See Appendix 3).  
8. STUDY DISCONTIN UATION   
8.1. STUDY OR SITE TERMIN ATION  
Conditions may arise during the study that could prompt the study to be halted or the study site to 
be terminated  from participation . Conditions that may prompt such considerations include, but are 
not limited to, the fo llowing:  
1. The discovery of unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the participants enrolled in the 
study.  
2. A decision on the part of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) to recommend 
suspending or discontinuing the study.  
3. A decision on the pa rt of Sponsor to suspend, discontinue, or shorten the study.  
4. Study conduct at the study site may warrant termination under conditions that include the 
following:  
a) Failure of Investigator(s) to enroll eligible participants into the study;  
b) Failure of  Investigator(s) to comply with International Conference on Harmonization  
(ICH) - Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) guidelines, or FDA guidelines and regulations;  
c) Submission of false information from the research facility to the Sponsor, the Clinical 
Monito r, the FDA, or IRB;  
d) Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements;

8.2. SUBJECT WITHDRAWAL F ROM STUDY  
Participants may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time during the course of the study 
for any reason, specified or unspecified, and without prejudice. The Investigator  will document 
the reason/circumstances for withdrawal in the appropriate eCRF  in a timely manner (preferably 
within 24 -48 hours).   
Participants can discontinue from the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Participants whose MSC or MSC -NTF cells fail to proliferate and to produce a sufficient 
number of cells for transplantation  (see Section 2.1) . 
• For any reason related to safety or tolerability  
• At the subject’s request  
• At the discretion of the Investigator, if deemed appropriate for any reason  
• At the discretion of the Sponsor, if deemed appropriate for any reason  
Efforts will be made to have participants who discontinue from the study for any reason, return to 
the site for an End of Study visit (Visit 7).  Such follow -up will include all relevant e valuations for 
safety and efficacy including clinical assessments and collection of laboratory study results as set 
out in this protocol .  
The subject will be asked if they agree to be followed over the phone at the remaining study visits. 
If a participant  refuses to return for the End of Study follow up visit and declines to be followed 
with any further clinic visits or assessments, site must document this providing the reason in the 
End of Study page eCRF in the electronic database. The documentation shou ld include the date 
the participant withdrew consent/discontinued, the reason for discontinuation, and the fact that the 
participant refuses to return for the end of study visit. The date documented will be considered the 
last date of contact and thus the participant’s last day on the study.  
Despite discontinuing from the study, if the site becomes aware of any adverse events or SAEs 
that occur within 12 weeks of the last transplant, they should be recorded in the database Adverse 
Event log  
8.3. TEMPORARY DISCON TINUATION FROM THE S TUDY  
Study treatment can be temporarily withheld in case of any serious adverse event (SAE) or 
significant inter -current illness  or cell-manufacturing and patient visit scheduling issues .

The Symbol Digit Modalit ies test (SDMT) will be evaluated as a change from baseline in each 
treated study participant  (See Appendix 2, Section 15.2. 7). 
9.3. STATISTICAL METHODS AND SAMPLE SIZE DETE RMINATION  
9.3.1.  Sample Size Determination  
No formal sample size calculation is performed. Efficacy and safety data on 20 subjects  will 
provide information to inform the design of a future randomized clinical study . 
9.3.2.  Statistical Methods  
Summaries for continuous variables will include the sample size, mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, and maximum. Minima and maxima will be rep orted with the same precision 
as the raw values; means, standard deviations, and medians will be presented to one additional 
decimal place than reported in the raw values. Summaries for discrete variables will include 
frequencies and percentages. All perce ntages will be rounded to one decimal place (i.e., XX.X%). 
The baseline visit will be defined as the last non -missing measure prior to initiation of 
investigational treatment (first treatment at Visit 3, Day 0-1).  
A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP ) will be will be completed prior to the first subject being 
treated .  
9.3.3.  Analysis Population  
The primary, secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the modified 
intent to treat (mITT) and Efficacy Evaluable ( EE) population s. The mITT population  will be 
defined in this study as all participants who received at least one treatment  and have at least one 
Timed 25 -Foot Walk (T25FW) or 9-Hole Peg Test (9 -HPT) assessment  post baseline.  Baseline 
will be defined as the most recent assessme nt prior to receiving the first transplantation on Day 0, 
at Visit 3. The EE population will be defined as a subset of the mITT population that receive all 3 
treatments and do not have any important protocol deviations impacting efficacy evaluation.  If the  
EE population is identical or very similar to the mITT population, analyses may only be generated 
for the mITT population.  
All safety analyses will be conducted on the Safety Population, which will be defined as all 
participants who were enrolled and had at least one transplantation performed .  
9.3.4.  Efficacy Analyses  
Efficacy analyses will be performed using the modified mITT and EE populations as described 
above.  
Efficacy endpoints  will be based upon : T25FW , 9-HPT ; blood and CSF biomarkers ; EDSS 
MSWS -12; Physical function measured with wearable sensor ; LCLA , and SDMT .  
Efficacy analyses of continuous data will be based upon change from baseline to each post -baseline 
timepoint.

Confidential  A subject will be defined as a respond er if over 28 weeks his/her T25FW walking speed  or 9-HPT  
improves by ≥25% as compared to baseline  (first transplant  visit), determined to be clinically 
meaningful for MS patients1.  
Responder analyses will compare the proportion of responders using various  definitions of 
responders using T25FW  or 9-HPT , blood and CSF biomarkers, EDSS, MSWS -12, Physical 
function measured with  wearable sensor , LCLA  and SDMT . 
All deaths related to disease progression will be defined as non -responders. Details of all statistical 
analyses will be provided in the SAP, which will be completed prior to the first subject being 
treated . 
The timed 25 -foot walking speed  (T25FW ) is a quantitative mobility and leg function performance 
test based on a timed 25  foot-walk. T25FW score is the average in seconds of the two successive 
trials . The T25FW  has high inter -rater and test -retest reliability and shows evidence of good 
concurrent validit y (https://www.nationalmssociety.org/For -
Professionals/Researchers/Resources -for-Researchers/Clinical -Study -Measures/Timed -25-Foot-
Walk -(T25 -FW, See Appendix 2, Section 15.2.2 ). 
The T25FW2, and 9-HPT3, are performed as part of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite 
(MSFC)  and the MSFC is a validated outcome measure in MS clinical trials4. A modified version 
of the MSFC consists of a 4-component test battery that includes T25FW, 9HPT, LCLA, and 
SDMT.  A 25% change in T25FW and 9 -HPT are considered clinically meaningful improvements.  
CSF and serum biomarkers will include neurotrophic factors, neurodegenerative, and 
inflammatory biomarkers  and MS specific biomarkers , such as Neurofilament Light C hain (NfL) 
and Neurofilament Heavy  Chain (Nf H).  
The EDSS is an objective approach to quantify the level of physical disability in MS. It provides 
a total score on a scale that ranges from 0 (no disability) through 1 to 10 ( death due to MS) in 0.5-
point steps. EDSS is widely used as an outcome measure in MS. A 1.0 -point change in the EDSS 
(EDSS <6) or 0.5 -point change in EDSS (EDSS 6.0 -6.5) are considered clinically meaningful  5. 
Additional details are included in Appendix 2, Section 15.2.4 .

The SDMT  is a validated clinical endpoint for measuring cognition in MS 2. A 4-point change in 
SDMT  is considered a clinically meaningful improvement  (See Appendix 2, Section 15.2. 7). 
9.3.5.  Safety analyses  
All safety analyses wi ll be based upon the Safety Population.  
All AEs will be coded to System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®). The number of treatment -emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) and the number of p articipants with any TEAEs (along with percentages) will be 
tabulated by SOC and PT .  
A TEAE is an AE that occurs for the first time after initiation of treatment or if it had occurred 
prior to treatment, worsens in severity after initiation of treatment.  
Separate summaries will be provided for the following categories of AEs:  
• TEAEs  
• TEAEs by severity  
• Treatment -related TEAEs  
• Serious TEAEs  
When evaluating changes in safety parameters, Baseline will be defined as the last measurement 
prior to first transp lantation (i.e., prior to initiation of treatment).  
Abnormalities in hematology, blood chemistry  and ECG assessments will be summarized .  
MRI (T1 and T2 weighted images ) will be assessed for study safety  at baseline and at the end of 
the study . 
9.3.6.  Biomarker Analysis  
CSF and/or serum samples will be analyzed for the concentration of biomarkers and their 
relationship to efficacy outcomes at each visit. In addition, relationships between neurotropic

Confidential  15.2.  APPENDIX 2: EFFICACY OUTCOME MEASURES  
15.2.1.  Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC)  
The original MSFC is a three -part, standardized, quantitative, assessment instrument for use in 
clinical studies, particul arly clinical trials, of MS (Cutter et al, 1999) . The MSFC initially included 
three components: T25FW, 9HPT, and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task [PASAT]  and 
was designed to reflect the varied clinical expression of MS across patients and over time on three 
areas: leg function/ambulation, arm/hand function, and cognitive function .  
Modifications were made to  the MSFC which now consists of  a 4-component test battery that 
includes T25FW, 9HPT, LCLA, and SDMT. The PASAT was replaced with the SDMT and the 
LCLA was added to test visual acuity. The scores for each area should change relatively 
independently over time. Administration time will vary depending upon the ability of the 
participant.  
Total administration time for all three measures should be approximately 20 -30 minutes. The 
MSFC can produce scores for each of the three individual measures as well as a composite score.   
15.2.2.  Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW)  
The T25FW is a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test based on a timed 25 -walk. 
It is the first component of the  MFSC  to be administered at each visit. The participant is directed 
to one end of a clearly marked 25 -foot course and is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as 
possible, but safely. The time is calculated from the initiation of the instruction to start and ends 
when the participant has reached the 25 -foot mark. The task is immediately administered again by 
having th e patient walk back the same distance. Participants may use assistive devices when doing 
this task.  
Administration time will vary depending upon the ability of the patient. Total administration time 
should be approximately 1 -5 minutes. The score for the T2 5FW  is the average of the two 
completed trials. This score can be used individually or used as part of the MSFC composite score.  
15.2.3.  9-Hole Peg Test (9 -HPT)  
The 9 -HPT is a brief, standardized, quantitative test of upper extremity function. It is the second 
component of the MSFC to be administered at each visit. Both the dominant and non -dominant 
hands are tested twice. The participant is seated at a table with a small, shallow container holding 
nine pegs and a wood or plastic block containing nine empty holes. On a start command when a 
stopwatch is started, the participant picks up the nine pegs one at a time as quickly as possible, 
puts them in the nine holes, and, once they are in the holes, removes them again as quickly as 
possible one at a time, replacing th em into the shallow container. The total time to complete the 
task is recorded. Two consecutive trials with the dominant hand are immediately followed by two 
consecutive trials with the non -dominant hand.  
Administration time will vary depending upon the ab ility of the participant. Total administration 
time should be approximately 10 minutes or less.  The score for the 9 -HPT can be used individually 
or used as part of the MSFC composite score.

Confidential  15.2.4.  Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS, Kurtzke)  
The EDSS is an objective approach to quantify the level of physical disability in MS. It provides 
a total score on a scale that ranges from 0 (no disability) through 1 to 10 ( death due to MS) in 0.5-
point steps.  The first levels 1.0 to 4.5 refer to people with a high deg ree of ambulatory ability and 
the subsequent levels 5.0 to 9.5 refer to the loss of ambulatory ability.   
In addition, it also provides eight subscale measurements called Functional System (FS) scores. 
The levels of function within each category refer to th e eight functional systems affected by MS : 
Pyramidal (motor function) (P); Cerebellar (C11); Brainstem (BS); Sensory (S); Bowel and 
Bladder (BB); Visual (V); Cerebral or Mental (Cb); Ambulation.  
Administration time will vary depending upon the condition of  the patient and the skill of the 
examiner. Although the FSS and EDSS themselves can be rated in a few minutes, the neurological 
examination that is needed to make the ratings can take anywhere from 15 minutes to a half -hour.  
Table 3. Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)  
0.0 Normal neurological exam (all grade 0 in all Functional System (FS) scores*).  
1.0 No disability, minimal signs in one FS* (i.e., grade 1).

4.5 Fully ambulatory without aid, up and about much of the day, able to work a full day, may 
otherwise have some limitation of full activity or require minimal assistance; characterized by 
relatively severe disability usu ally consisting of one FS grade 4 (others or 1) or combinations of 
lesser grades exceeding limits of previous steps; able to walk without aid or rest greater than  300 
meters.    
5.0 Ambulatory without aid or rest for about 200 meters; disability severe eno ugh to impair full daily 
activities (e.g., to work a full day without special provisions); (Usual FS equivalents are one 
grade 5 alone, others 0 or 1; or combinations of lesser grades usually exceeding specifications for 
step 4.0  
5.5 Ambulatory without ai d for about 100 meters; disability severe enough to preclude full daily 
activities; (Usual FS equivalents are one grade 5 alone, others 0 or 1; or combination of lesser 
grades usually exceeding those for step 4.0).

10.0 Death due to MS  
* Excludes cerebral function grade 1.  
Note 1: EDSS steps 1.0 to 4.5 refer to patients who are fully  ambulatory and the precise step number is 
defined by the Functional System score(s). EDSS steps 5.0 to 9.5 are defined by the impairment to 
ambulation and usual equivalents in Functional Systems scores are provided.  
Note 2: EDSS should not change by 1.0 s tep unless there is a change in the same direction of at least one 
step in at least one FS.  
 
15.2.5.  Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS -12) 
The MSWS -12 is a patient -reported outcome measure of the walking limitations due to MS during 
the past 2 weeks. It contains 12 questions that assess the impact of MS on different aspects of 
walking function and quality.  
Total administration time should be approximately 5 minutes. Activities are rated by participant 
from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely) and summed to calculate a total score using a scale from 0 to 
100 (ranging from low to high impact on walking).

Confidential  15.2.6.  Low Contrast Letter Acuity (LCLA)  
Sloan LCLA charts are administered binocularly or each eye can be tested individually.  The charts 
are placed on a retro -illuminated cabinet, eliminating the need for standardized room lighting, or 
on the wall in front of the participant. Participants are se ated 2 m away and asked to read the letters 
aloud proceeding top to bottom and from left to right until they can no longer see the letters.  
Total administration time, for a typical MS patient, is approximately 10 –15 minutes to complete, 
when testing each eye individually and binocular vision for two different contrast levels. The score 
for each chart is quantified as the number of letters identified correctly with a maximum score of 
70 letters.  
15.2.7.  Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)  
The SDMT invo lves a simple substitution task that normal children and adults can easily perform. 
Using a reference key, the examinee has 90 seconds to pair specific numbers with given geometric 
figures.  
Total administration time should be approximately 5 minutes. The standardized score is calculated 
from the participant’s raw score. The manual provides normative mean scores and standard 
deviations by age.

Confidential  15.3.  APPENDIX 3: C -SSRS  
Suicidal ideation and behavior is assessed using the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating S cale (C -
SSRS).  
The binary responses, yes or no, can be categorized in one of the following:  
Category 1 – Wish to be Dead  
Category 2 – Non-specific Active Suicidal Thoughts  
Category 3 – Active Suicidal Ideation with Any Methods (Not Plan) without Intent to Act  
Category 4 – Active Suicidal Ideation with Some Intent to Act, without Specific Plan  
Category 5 – Active Suicidal Ideation with Specific Plan and Intent  
Category 6 – Preparatory Acts or Behavior  
Category 7 – Aborted Attempt  
Category 8 – Interrup ted Attempt  
Category 9 – Actual Attempt (non -fatal)  
Category 10 – Suicidal Behavior  
Total administration time should be approximately 5 minutes. The suicidal ideation score is the 
maximum suicidal ideation category (1 -5 on the C -SSRS) present at the assess ment. If no ideation 
is present, the suicidal ideation score is 0.  
A “yes” answer at any time during treatment to any one of the five suicidal ideation questions 
(categories 1 -5) on the C -SSRS will be categorized as “Suicidal ideation”. A “yes” answer at any 
time during treatment to any one of the five suicidal behavior questions (categories 6 -10) on the 
C-SSRS will be categorized as “Suicidal behavior”. A “yes” answer at any time during treatment 
to any one of the ten suicidal ideation and behavior questi ons (categories 1 -10) on the C -SSRS 
will be categorized as “Suicidal ideation or behavior”.

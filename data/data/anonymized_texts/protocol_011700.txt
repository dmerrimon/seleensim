Version 2.0 / Jun/1 7/2020                                                  10                                         PR/ALPI -101-SYST  2. BACKGROUND/INTRODUCT ION 
Phacoemulsification, using  ultrasound energy, has evolved to be the most efficient 
method for cataract extraction and cataract surgery. The current trend for 
phacoemulsification includes smaller incision size, higher vacuum level usage, as well 
as continuously evolving techniques f or lowering ultrasound energy and more efficient 
cataract removal.    
The VERITASTM Vision  System is a next generation Phacoemulsification (Phaco) system 
from Johnson & Johnson Surgical Vision (JJSV) .  It aspirates the emulsified lens out of 
the chamber, and provides irrigation to help maintain the depth and pressure of the 
chamber. The VERITASTM Vision  system sub -modes allow the surgeon to also perform 
Diathermy (electrical cauterization) and Vitrectomy (a cutting action).  
3. CLINICAL HYPOTHESIS  
The VERITASTM Vision System  will achieve favorable surgeon acceptance and clinical 
performance  based on their responses to the key clinical performance questions  listed in 
Appendix D . 
4. STUDY DESIGN  
This study is a prospective, open -label clinical study of the VERITASTM Vision System.  
The study will be conducted at up to three  sites, with minimum 55 eyes and up to 150 
eyes to be treated .  The investigator or designee will perform the cataract surgery with 
the VERITASTM Vision System on the subjects.  The data from the  system log files , the 
questionnaire , the operative report and other medical records will be used to assess the 
clinical utilization of the VERITASTM Vision System.  
JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY DESIGN :  
The study is being conducted to evaluate the overall clinical performance of the 
VERITASTM Vision  System in human subjects and to confirm the overall surgeon 
acceptability .

7. STUDY PRODUCTS  
The VERITASTM Vision System is intended to be used to perform cataract surgery by 
utilization of Phacoemulsification technique. VERITASTM aspirates the emulsified lens 
out of the chamber, and provides irrigation to help maintain the depth and pressure of 
the chamber. The VERITASTM Vision System ’s sub-modes allow surgeon s to also 
perform Diathermy (electrical cauterization) and Vitrectomy (a cutting action).  
A set of preprogrammed default surgical modes and settings are provided with the 
system.  The surgeon controls the various aspects of the surgical procedure by pre -
programming the system (via VERITASTM Footpedal, remote, and/or touch screen) for 
the surgeo ns’ specifications, and then using a VERITASTM Footpedal to control the 
modes and power output during surgery.  
The VERITASTM Vision System is designed to be used with OPO73, Advanced Infusion 
(AI) and Advanced Fluidics (AF) packs. These packs are dual pum p fluidic tubing pack 
which interfaces with both the peristaltic and the vacuum -based pump related 
components.  Advanced Infusion (AI) pack supports both gravity -based irrigation and 
Gas Force Infusion (GFI), while Advanced Fluidics (AF) pack only supports  gravity -
based irrigation.  
The VERITASTM Vision System is also designed to be compatible with VERITASTM 
Swivel Handpiece as well as the legacy Phaco Handpieces. However, VERITASTM 
Swivel Handpiece is designed to be used with VERITASTM Vision System only. The 
VERITASTM Swivel  Handpiece is not intended for use with  JJSV’s legacy Phaco 
systems.  
Version 2.0 / Jun/1 7/2020                                                  13                                         PR/ALPI -101-SYST  The VERITASTM Vision System supports the newly developed VERITASTM Footpedal as 
well as the legacy JJSV’s Foot pedals.  
The VERITASTM Vision System is designed to be used with VERITASTM Remote Control 
only. It does  not support legacy Remote Control . 
Note:  The clinical study will be performed with the VERITAS system and available, 
compatible accessories such as fluidics packs, handpiece, foot pe dal and remote 
control. The components and accessories of the VERITA S system may be updated 
during the trial while ensuring that the system and accessories conform to the risk 
analysis and risk -benefit described in the protocol.

10. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
10.1 OVERVIEW  
This study will be conducted in accordance with, the Declaration of Helsinki, ISO 
14155:2011  and all other applicable laws and regulations.  The study will not begin until 
regulatory and IRB/IEC  approvals have been obtained.  
This study will be a prospective, open -label clinical investigation. Minimum 55 eyes and 
up to 150 eyes are expected to be  treated.    
Key operative data include system settings, surgeons’ subjective rat ing on various 
aspects of the surgeries, system log files  and report s, other medical records, medical 
complications, and adverse events during the study . 
Version 2.0 / Jun/1 7/2020                                                  17                                         PR/ALPI -101-SYST  10.2 VISIT SCHEDULE  
There will be three study visits (Preoperative, operative and 1 -2 days postoperative).  
The study visit schedule for all study subjects is outlined in Table 1 . Unscheduled visits 
may be conducted as necessary at the discretion of the investigator for medically 
indicated  follow -up.  
Table 1: Visit Schedule  
NAME OF 
VISIT VISIT VISIT WINDOW  
1 Preoperative  Within 45 days prior to surgery  
2 Operative  Day of surgery  
3 1-Day Post-Op 1-2 days postoperative  
 
10.3 PROCEDURES  
The procedures in the Pre-Op visit include Informed Consent  as well as  preop erative  
exams .  The procedures in the Operative  Visit include  cataract surgery  with the 
VERITASTM Vision System  and completion of the Questionnaire .  The procedures in the 
1-Day Post-Op visit include the UCDVA, slit lamp and other exams.  
Preoperative Procedures  
The Investigator or designee identifies potentia l study participants by reviewing medical 
records of subjects.  Potential study participants are scheduled for  the study visit s. 
Informed Consent  
At the visit, the Investigator or designee conducts the informed consent discussion and 
explains the study purpose, procedures, benefits, risks, discomforts, precautions and 
subject responsibilities to the potential study participant.   The Investigator may provide 
written delegation of authority to a trained and qualified study staff member (e.g., study 
coordin ator, technician) to conduct the consent discussion; however, the Investigator 
should be available to answer the potential participant’s questions, as needed.  
Once the Investigator or designee has answered all the potential participant’s questions 
to his/h er satisfaction and the potential study participant has voluntarily agreed to 
participate in the study, written informed consent is obtained using the IRB/IEC -
approved informed consent document.  The subject and the person conducting the 
consent discussion  (Investigator or designee) print their names, sign and date the 
consent.  If the subject is unable to read, the consent document can be read to the 
subject in front of an impartial witness, who also prints his/her name, signs and dates the 
consent.  
Version 2.0 / Jun/1 7/2020                                                  18                                         PR/ALPI -101-SYST  All su bjects enrolled in the study must sign the current IRB/IEC -approved informed 
consent document.  The informed consent must  be signed before any study -specific 
examinations are performed, and this must be documented in the source documents .  
An authorization  for use/disclosure of health information form (HIPAA authorization) or 
similar medical measurement privacy law documentation must also be signed.   
The Investigator maintains the signed informed consent document and the signed 
authorization form as a perm anent part of the subject’s medical records and provides a 
signed copy of the consent to the subject.  The Investigator or designee documents in 
the medical records that informed consent was obtained prior to any study -specific 
procedures and a copy of the  signed consent was given to the subject.  
Potential participants who are approached with the informed consent document will be 
documented on the Subject Accountability Log.  A subject who does not meet the 
eligibility criteria or who chooses to discontinue  study participation at any time is 
documented on the Subject Accountability Log as a Screen Failure or Exited Subject 
along with the reason. All subjects who sign the informed consent document are 
assigned a subject identifier.  
All preoperative testing fo r the study must be completed within 45  days prior to surgery.  
Data from routine (non -study -specific) preoperative cataract examinations performed 
prior to the informed consent process may be included, provided these tests are 
conducted no more than 45 da ys prior to surgery and the test date(s) are documented 
on the preoperative Case Report Form (CRF).  If a test/exam is required by the protocol 
but is not part of the routine testing the investigator performs for the cataract evaluation, 
that test/exam is considered to be study -specific and is not to be done until after the 
informed consent form has been signed by the subject.  Following the informed consent 
process, completion of the preoperative study exam and determination that the subject 
meets all of t he required entrance criteria, the subject may be scheduled for surgery.  
Preoperative testing to be performed for each eye includes the following:  
Medical and Ocular History  
To determine the presence of any systemic or ophthalmic factors that may affect th e 
subject’s eligibility based on the study inclusion and exclusion criteria in Section 8 , the 
Investigator or designee obtain the subject’s medical and ophthalmic history at the visit, 
including assessment of:   
1) demographic information (age, gender, race/e thnicity);  
2) ophthalmic conditions and medications;  
3) history of ocular surgery, ocular injury, ocular infection, ocular inflammation, 
ocular allergy, eyelid abnormality, or ocular surface abnormality;  
4) pregnant and breastfeeding conditions, if applicable;  
5) recent participation in another ophthalmic clinical trial;  
6) employment or relationship with any employee at the clinical study site.

source documents.  
Adverse Events  
Subjects should be assessed at each visit for occurrence of and/or change in status of 
any adverse events, particularly serious and/or device -related events.  See Section 11.0 
for further information.  
Ocular Symptom s (non -directed; spontaneous)  
Subjective ocular symptoms are to be assessed at the p reoperative visit  by asking “Are 
you having any difficulties with your eyes/vision?”  Subjects should not be prompted for 
specific responses; however, if a subject reports halos, night glare or starbursts, the 
level of severity should be determined (mild, moderate or severe).  
Biomicroscopic Slit -Lamp Exam   
A biomicroscopic slit -lamp exam must be performed at the study visit to determine if the 
subject meets inclusion/exclus ion criteria.   The Investigator or designee evaluates the 
eyelids, palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, iris , lens and other 
parts of eye using a slit lamp biomicroscope.  The Investigator or designee assesses the 
findings for the pr esence of any medical findings . 
Distance Visual Acuity  Testing   
Monocular uncorrected distance visual acuity ( UCDVA) is to be measured for each eye 
using a n ETDRS  chart  or per the site’s standard of care.  
Intraocular Pressure (IOP)  
Intraocular pressure (IOP) is to be measured for each eye using the investigator’s usual 
methods (e.g., Goldmann applanation or tonopen ).  It is recommended that the same 
methods be used for all study subjects at the site for the duration of the study.  
Anterior Chamber Depth (ACD)  
Anterior Chamber Depth is to be measured for each eye using the investigator’s usual 
methods.  
Corneal Densitometry  
The corneal densitometry is to be measured through Pentacam , Galilei G6 or other 
corneal densitometry system  at the designated visit s. The same corneal densitometry 
device is to be used throughout the duration of the study.

for all subjects postoperatively using an ETDR S chart  or per site’s standard of care . 
Biomicroscopic Slit -Lamp Exam   
A biomicroscopic slit -lamp exam must be performed at the postoperative visit to 
determine the presence or absence of any medical or lens findings, complications or 
adverse events.  
Findings of aqueous cells and flare, corneal edema, corneal clarity, posterior capsule 
striae (wrinkles), and posterior capsule opacification are to be rated using standardized 
grading scales of 0 to +4 (0  = none, +4  = severe) during the slit lamp  biomicro scopy.  
The specific grading scales are provided in Appendix C .   
Intraocular Pressure (IOP)  
Intraocular pressure (IOP) is to be measured using the investigator’s usual methods 
(e.g., Goldmann applanation or tonopen).  
Anterior Chamber Depth (ACD)  
Anterior  Chamber Depth is to be measured using the investigator’s usual methods.  
Corneal Densitometry  
The corneal densitometry is to be measured through Pentacam or Galilei G6 at the 
designated visit. The same corneal densitometry device is to be used throughout the 
duration of the study.  
Ocular Symptoms (non -directed; spontaneous)  
Subjective ocular symptoms are to be assessed at the postoperative visit by asking “Are 
you having any difficulties with your eyes/vision?”  Subjects should not be prompted for 
specific responses; however, if a subject reports halos, night glare or starbursts, the 
level of severity should be determined (mil d, moderate or severe).

to the first  study treatment . At the completion of all study treatments , the VERITASTM 
Vision System  will be shipped back to JJSV following the final accountability by a JJSV 
Study M onitor.  At all times, the storage, access and use of the VERITASTM Vision 
System must be controlled.   
10.5 EXIT OF SUBJECTS  
An Exit Case Report Form will be completed for all subjects, either when they complete 
the study or if they exit early.    
It is the responsibility of the investigator to provide complete follow -up data to JJSV for 
each subject, and every attempt should be made to gather that complete follow -up data 
for all subjects enrolled as missing data can have a negative effect on the st udy results.  
A subject will be considered a “screen failure” if he/she does not meet the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria or if consent is withdrawn prior to  cataract surgery .   
If a subject is exited early from the study, the investigator or designee will co mplete an 
Exit Case Report Form indicating the reason for study exit.  In the event of any serious 
adverse event, the subject may be exited from the study; however, efforts must be made 
by the investigator to follow the subject until resolution of the adve rse event.    
Following study completion or early exit, all study subjects are to be instructed to 
undergo regular eye examinations at least yearly and to return to their doctor if any eye 
complications are experienced in the interim.  
10.6 UNSCHEDULED VISITS  
During the study period  or immediately after (within 1 -week) , if a non -protocol -required 
visit is done for the purpose of medically indicated  follow -up for a study eye, data from 
this visit should be reported using the Unscheduled Visit CRF.  The need for 
Version 2.0 / Jun/1 7/2020                                                  23                                         PR/ALPI -101-SYST  unscheduled visits is at the investigator’s discretion.  Specific examinations to be 
performed at unscheduled visits are also at the discretion of the investigator (based on 
the reason for the unscheduled visit) and data are to be recorded in the appropria te 
section of the case report form.  
10.7 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
Any departure from the protocol procedures represents a protocol deviation.  Protocol 
deviations may be subject -based (e.g., inclusion/exclusion criteria, informed consent 
deviation, etc.) or procedur al-based (e.g., out -of-interval visits, non -compliance with 
testing procedures, etc.).  All protocol deviations will be documented in CTMS system .  
Any deviation made to protect the life or physical wellbeing of a subject in an emergency 
as well as any use  of the investigational device without obtaining informed consent must 
be reported to JJSV within 5 working days.  Protocol deviations will be monitored by 
JJSV, and if the non -compliance is persistent or egregious, JJSV may take action, 
including but not limited to termination of the investigator’s participation in the study.  
The investigator is also responsible for informing the reviewing IRB/IEC  of instances of 
protocol non -compliance in accordance with the IRB/IEC  requirements.

effectiveness, or performance of a device. This may include malfunction s, use error and 
inadequacies in labeling.  Product complaints can pertain to any marketed JJSV device 
being used in the study.  The investigator is to assess whether the deficiency could have 
led to a serious adverse event without suitable action or inter vention or under less 
fortunate circumstances.  
11.3 ADVERSE EVENT AND CO MPLAINT REPORTING RE QUIREMENTS  
All adverse events and any complaint encountered using any JJSV product, regardless 
of severity and whether or not attributed to the study device(s), are to b e reported to 
JJSV and recorded on the case report form corresponding to the visit during which 
awareness of the event occurred  (see Appendix E ).  Adverse events are  also to be 
reported to the reviewing IRB/IEC  as per the IRB/IEC ’s reporting requirements.  If 
required, adverse events will be reported to the appropriate regulatory agencies 
according to all applicable laws and regulations.   
Reporting of adverse events shall follow ISO 14155 and country -specific guidelines, of 
which the shortest/strictest tim eline requirement for reporting adverse events will be 
followed .  General guidelines are provided below:  
Adverse Event Reporting  
An adverse event that is not serious or device -related is to be reported to JJSV in a 
timely manner.  Notification of non -serious and non -device related adverse events will 
occur by recording events on the CRF when noted.  Such adverse events are also to b e 
reported to the reviewing IRB/IEC  per their reporting requirements.  
 
 
Version 2.0 / Jun/1 7/2020                                                  26                                         PR/ALPI -101-SYST  Complaints/Device Deficiency Reporting  
A general product complaint or device deficiency is to be reported to JJSV in a timely 
manner.  Notification of complaints/device deficiencies will occur by either recording 
complaints on the CRF when the complaint occurred (e.g. operative form) or by a phone 
call to the Sponsor.  Any device deficiency that could have led to a serious adverse 
event without suitable action or intervention, or unde r less fortunate circumstances, must 
be reported to the sponsor immediately (no later than 24 hours after detection ). Device 
deficiencies that could have led to a serious adverse event should also be reported to 
the investigator’s IRB/IEC  per their reporti ng requirements.  
Serious and/or Device -Related Adverse Event Reporting  
Serious and/or device related events (ADEs) are to be documented using the Serious 
Adverse Event/Adverse Device Effect (SAE/ADE) CRF.  In the event of a serious 
adverse event (SAE), whi ch may or may not be related to use of the study device, JJSV 
must be notified immediately (no later than 24 hours after detection).   Any SAE is to be 
reported by phone (and/or email) and by submitting the completed SAE/ADE CRF.  Any 
SAE or device -related AE should also be reported to the investigator’s IRB/IEC  per their 
reporting requirements.  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)/Unanticipated Serious Adverse 
Device Effect (USADE) Reporting  
If during the study, a serious adverse event occurs that may  reasonably be regarded as 
device -related and was not previously expected in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence, the investigator is to report the UADE/USADE to JJSV within 24 hours , and to 
the investigator’s IRB/IEC  as soon as possible (and no later  than 10  working days after 
learning of the event for sites in the USA as required by 21CFR812).  
11.4 CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP  
The investigator should always be alert to adverse events that may be related to the 
study device or the use of the study device (i.e., th e procedure specific to the initial 
application of the device).  An attempt should be made in every case to determine the 
causality of the event.  The following definitions are to be used as guidelines in 
determining the relationship between the event and the study device and/or use of the 
device.   
Definitely related:  If the event is associated with the device and/or the use of the 
device beyond a reasonable doubt, a causal relationship exists 
between the adverse event and the device and/or the use of the 
study device.  
Probably related:   There is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
between the adverse event and the device and/or the use of the 
study device and/or the adverse event cannot be reasonably 
explained by another cause.  
Possibly rela ted:   The adverse event has not been determined to be related to the 
device or the use of the device, but no other cause has been 
Version 2.0 / Jun/1 7/2020                                                  27                                         PR/ALPI -101-SYST  identified and the device and/or the use of the study device 
cannot be ruled out as a possible cause.  
Unlikely to be related:  The possibility of a potential causal relationship between 
adverse event and the device and/or the use of the device could 
exist, but the adverse event can be reasonably explained by 
another cause.  
Not related:  There is no possibility of a causal relationship between the 
adverse event and the device and/or the use of the study device 
and/or the adverse event can be attributed to another cause.  
If an adverse event is believed to be definitely, probably or possibly related to the study 
device and/or the use of the device, the event will be considered related to the study 
device and/or the use of the device.   
11.5 ADVERSE EVENT FOLLOW -UP 
For every adverse event, appropriate measures should be undertaken to treat and/or 
monitor the subject until resolution occurs.  Obtain and maintain in the subject's files all 
pertinent medical data relating to the event including the subject’s medical records and 
medical reports and/or judgments from colleagues or outside specialists who assisted in 
the measurements of the  subject. The investigator should keep JJSV closely informed 
as to the outcome of serious and/or device -related adverse events, thereby allowing 
JJSV to comply with the appropriate regulatory reporting requirements.  A SAE/ADE  
Follow -up CRF should be completed each time the subject returns to the investigator  for 
follow -up of serious and/or device -related adverse event until resolution of the event.  
Any subject who is exited from the study due to a serious and/or device -related adverse 
event or prior to resolution of such an event will be followed until the outcome is 
determined.  
12. PROTOCOL CHANGES/AME NDMENTS  
If the investigator desires to modify any procedure and/or the design of the study, he or 
she must contact and obtain consent from JJSV  regarding t he proposed changes prior to 
implementation .  Any modifications (including additional data collection) require approval 
of the governing IRB/IEC  prior to implementation.   
13. ETHICS REVIEW AND SUBJECT  WELFARE  
13.1 INDEPENDENT ETHICS C OMMITTEE (IEC) OR INSTITUTIONA L 
REVIEW BOARD (IRB)  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain prospective approval of the study 
protocol, protocol amendments or changes, informed consent forms and other relevant 
documents (e.g., advertisements) from the IRB/IEC .  All corres pondence with the 
IRB/IEC  should be retained in the Investigator Notebook.  Copies of IRB/IEC  
submissions and approvals should be forwarded to JJSV . 
Version 2.0 / Jun/1 7/2020                                                  28                                         PR/ALPI -101-SYST  The investigator is responsible for notifying the IRB/IEC  of reportable adverse events as 
well as any other  circumstance in which additional procedures outside the protocol were 
conducted to eliminate apparent hazards to subjects.  
13.2 INFORMED CONSENT  
The current version of the IRB/IEC -approved study informed consent must be signed by 
each study subject prior to an y study -specific examinations being performed.  The 
IRB/IEC -approved informed consent is to be signed and dated by the subject as well as 
by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion.  The signed informed 
consent will be maintained by the in vestigator as a permanent part of the subject’s 
medical records.  A copy of the signed and dated form is to be provided to the subject.  
The investigator will provide JJSV  written acknowledgement on the case report form that 
a signed agreement of informed consent has been obtained and is in the investigator’s 
possession for each subject.  As required by 21CFR812 Part G, the site shall document 
in the source documents that informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the 
study for each subject enr olled . 
NOTE:  The informed consent process also includes obtaining the subject’s signature on 
an Authorization for Use/Disclosure of Health Information for Research Form or 
equivalent documentation nec essary to comply with applicable privacy laws pertainin g to 
medical measurement in the governing countries.   
NOTE:  The sponsor will secure appropriate insurance for study subjects prior to study 
start.  
14. DOCUMENTATION  
14.1 SOURCE DOCUMENTS  
Source documents must be kept for all study subjects.  Source documents may include 
a subject’s medical records, hospital charts, clinic charts, the investigator’s subject study 
files, as well as results of any diagnostic tests or procedures such as topographies or 
laboratory tests with photographs or instrument printouts.  
Each si te is expected to adhere to the clinic’s own standard documentation requirements 
for medical charts/clinic notes.  However, for the purposes of this clinical study, the 
medical charts/clinic notes must also include, at a minimum, the following data that wi ll 
be considered source data and will be reviewed by JJSV : 
• Subject’s name and study identification number  
• Subject’s contact information  
• Study protocol number and the Sponsor name ( JJSV ) 
• A statement that informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study 
(including the date)  
• Dates of all subject visits throughout the duration of the study  
• Concurrent medications  
• Study measurements  
Version 2.0 / Jun/1 7/2020                                                  29                                         PR/ALPI -101-SYST  • Description of any adverse events and/or pro duct complaints/device deficiencies  
and documentation of appropriate reporting  
• The date the subject exited the study, and a notation as to whether the subject 
completed the study or reason for early exit.  
14.2 SUBJECT CONFIDENTIAL ITY 
Subjects will be assigned a  site/subject number to maintain subject confidentiality.  
Subject names may possibly be disclosed to the JJSV or regulatory agencies during 
inspection of medical records related to the study, but reasonable precautio ns will be 
taken to maintain confidenti ality of personal information to the extent permitted by 
applicable laws and regulations.  
14.3 CASE REPORT FORM COM PLETION  
This study will use a paper  or electronic data capture system.  The investigator is 
responsible for ensuring that data are properly record ed on each subject’s case report 
forms and related documents.  Prior to database lock, the investigator will verify 
completeness and accuracy of data submitted to JJSV.  
14.4 STUDY SUMMARY  
A final  investigator’s summary will be provided to JJSV and the reviewin g IRB/IEC  within 
3 months after termination or the completion of the study or the investigator’s part of the 
investigation .  
15. MONITORING  
JJSV  will perform three types of monitoring to ensure compliance with regulations: data 
monitoring, administrative moni toring, and safety monitoring . 
15.1 DATA MONITORING  
In order to ensure a well -controlled clinical trial, JJSV will follow specific data monitoring 
procedures, routinely generate reports and periodicall y review safety and effectiveness 
data.  To avoid bias, any analyses generated prior to site closures will not be 
disseminated to any of the investigative sites.  
To minimize data omissions and inconsistencies on clinical reports and to ensure that 
data ar e accurately transcribed to computer data files, JJSV will follow internal data 
processing procedures that include automated and manual quality control checks to 
identify any data discrepancies.  Any such items will be resolved and documented as 
needed on the case report forms at the investigative site and in the data management 
system at JJSV . 
Prevention of Missing Data  
Methods used to safeguard against missing data that can have deleterious effects on the 
study integrity and reliability of its outcomes wi ll include training study staff with 
centralized and on -site programs.  In addition, subjects will be encouraged at the time of 
Version 2.0 / Jun/1 7/2020                                                  30                                         PR/ALPI -101-SYST  informed consent to avoid missing study visits, as missing data may affect the study 
reliability and diminish the scientific val ue of their contribution to the study.  
15.2 ADMINISTRATIVE MONIT ORING  
Administrative monitoring procedures will ensure that study devices, subjects, and forms 
can be traced and will allow monitoring of investigator progress and compliance.  
Accountability and traceability of study devices will be monitored , as needed for 
compliance with study requirements . 
Device Accountability  
Complete Activator accountability will be maintained at the investigative site by 
maintaining records of investigational product receiv ed from and returned to JJSV.  A 
site log will be used to track investigational equipment for date of receipt, use and 
disposition/return to JJSV.  This site log and any other investigational product 
information will be maintained in the study binder and m onitored by JJSV personnel.  
During periodic investigative site monitoring visits, JJSV personnel will review 
investigative product inventory records and logs to ensure  Activator  accountability 
compliance and complete investigational traceability .   
Site M onitoring Plan  
Prior to performing site initiation, the requirements of the study and reporting  
mechanisms will be explained to each investigator  either personally at the investigative 
site or at a formal study investigator meeting.  When necessary, a pre -study site 
qualification visit may be performed to assess the adequacy of the site to perform the 
study for sites that have not previously worked with JJSV or have undergone significant 
changes, or have not been visited in the past year.  A study initiatio n visit will be 
conducted (either in -person or via a web -based meeting) for all sites prior to or at the 
time of the first study procedure.  A study initiation visit may be conducted prior to the 
first treatment .  
Throughout the duration of the study, site  visits to monitor compliance to this protocol will 
be made at each investigative site.  During interim site monitoring visits, JJSV will review 
informed consent documents and subject eligibility, and the data on study case report 
forms will be verified ag ainst subject charts and other source documents to ensure 
complete and accurate reporting.  The subject files will also be reviewed to assure that 
all adverse events and any issues encountered with JJSV products have been reported 
in a timely fashion.  
JJSV will also review source documents to verify that all required items have been 
documented in the subject medical charts.  Refer to Section 14.1, Source Documents, 
for a list of items that are required for source documentation.   
Training on study -specific  procedures may also be conducted during monitoring visits.  
Upon study completion, a final close -out site visit to each site will be made to monitor the 
last of the subject data records and finalize any outstanding study issues.  
Version 2.0 / Jun/1 7/2020                                                  31                                         PR/ALPI -101-SYST  A separate Study Monitori ng Plan will be established prior to study start that will define 
the type and frequency of monitoring visits and frequency of record monitoring.    
15.3 SAFETY MONITORING  
The Medical Monitor will review results throughout the clinical trial as necessary to 
ensure the continued safety of the device and to ensure that no subjects are exposed 
to unreasonable risk.  The medical monitor will be available to answer all questions 
from investigators.  The Medical Monitor will review and assess any reports of serious 
and/or device -related adverse events as well as device deficiencies that could have 
led to a serious adverse event, and discuss these with the reporting investigator(s) as 
necessary.  The Medical Monitor , as well as any other qualified personnel designated 
by JJSV, shall also review any interim progress reports, as applicable.  
16. PUBLICATIONS  
Refer to the Clinical Trial Agreement for information regarding JJSV publication policies . 
17. RISK ANALYSI S 
Potential Risks and Risk Management  
For the  VERITASTM Vision System , residual risks with rating of medium  to the subject s 
and operators can be grouped into possible induced harms;  
1) Corneal burn  
2) Eye contamination – such as endophthalmitis  
3) Subject  or user injury – such as pinch, cut, bruise  
4) Posterior capsular tear – can lead to vitreous traction, vitreous loss, and/or 
posterior dislocation of the cataractous lens  
5) Anterior capsular tear – can lead to IOL unable to be placed in capsular bag  
6) Endothelial cell loss  
7) Electrical shock  
8) Burn (second degree)  
9) Environment: Fire  
10) Laceration  
11) Irregular pupil or Iris Damage  
12) Vitreous Wick Syndrome  
General risks of cataract surgery and IOL implantation  
There are risks and complications associated with cataract  surgery and IOL implantation 
in general.  These can include worsening of vision, hemorrhage, loss of corneal clarity, 
inflammation, infections, retinal detachment, pupil changes, glaucoma, etc.  
Complications can result in poor vision, loss of vision or l oss of the eye.   
 
Version 2.0 / Jun/1 7/2020                                                  32                                         PR/ALPI -101-SYST  Risk Management  
Subjects will be closely monitored throughout  the trial duration. The occurrence of 
adverse events and complaints will be assessed at each study visit and reported to JJSV 
according to Section 11.0, Adverse Events and Pro duct Complaints.  Additionally, JJSV 
will monitor incoming data following the procedures outlined in Section 15.0, Monitoring.  
The Medical Monitor will ensure subjects are not exposed to additional risks by 
monitoring serious adverse events, device -relate d adverse events, and device -
deficiencies that could have led to serious adverse events (Section 15.3, Safety 
Monitoring).  
Potential Benefits  
The subject s may experience the following benefits:  
• Rapid visual rehabilitation  and alleviation of symptoms due to  cataract.  
• Early resumption of daily activities  
• Minimal ocular inflammation  
• Minimal postoperative astigmatism  
• Reduced potential for ocular complications  
 
Subject s who are participating in this trial may benefit from impro ved visual outcomes 
due to the phacoemulsification  procedure.   
Conclusion  
The hazards/risks associated with the VERITASTM Vision System are acceptable and 
within those of JJSV’s other phacoemulsification systems. The potential clinical benefits 
of the VERITASTM Vision system outweigh the residual risks when the device is used as 
intended.

JJSV)  
 
19. TERMINATION OF THE I NVESTIGATION  
The clinical investigation will be suspended in the event of high levels of complications 
and/or adverse events that are unexpected in nature and/or severity and evaluated as to 
causality rela tive to the study device.  The clinical investigation may be suspended if the 
Medical Monitor or IRB/IEC , upon review and evaluation of the clinical data, finds 
unacceptable clinical performance or the level of single or total complications and/or 
adverse events unacceptable for continuation of the investigation.  
If causality is shown not to be related to the study device, the study may be resumed in 
accordance with the IRB/IEC  and regulations of the FDA  and governing countries .  The 
study will be terminate d if causality is shown to be related to the study device.  
Additionally, the investigator, or JJSV, may stop a subject’s participation at any time.  
JJSV may also stop the study at any time for reasons it determines appropriate.  
However, no suspension of the study would be made to disadvantage the study 
subjects.  Following suspension of the study for any reason, all study subjects who have 
already received treatment would continue to be followed through completion of the 
study visit schedule.   
20. STATISTICAL  METHODS

bright.  
Trace  +1 Some loss of transparency involving the posterior capsule.  Red 
reflex fairly bright  
Mild +2 Mild loss of transparency with cloudiness extending through 
most of the posterior capsule.  There may be a few Elschnig’s 
pearls in the posterior capsule .  Red reflex mildly diminished.  
Moderate  +3 Moderate loss of transparency with difficulty visualizing the 
retina.  There may be multiple Elschnig’s pearls in the posterior 
capsule.  Red reflex markedly diminished.

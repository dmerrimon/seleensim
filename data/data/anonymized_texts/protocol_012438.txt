 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
Ⅰ. Protocol title:  
An Open -Label, Single -Arm Study of the Efficacy, Safety, and Pharmacokinetic Behavior  of 
Leuprolide Mesylate Injectable Suspension (LMIS 25 mg) in Subjects with Prostate Cancer  
Ⅱ. Objectives:  
LMIS 25 mg is the mesylate salt of leuprolid e and has the same biological activity profile as 
leuprolide acetate salt. It is a luteinizing hormone -releasing hormone (LH -RH) agonist acting 
as a potent inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion when given in therapeutic doses, and lowers 
testosterone levels to castrate levels. Leuprolide is the standard of care for palliative treatment 
of prostate cancer. This study is designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic 
(PK) profile of LMIS 25 mg when given as two separate subcutaneous injections a dministered 
12 weeks  apart in subjects with prostate cancer.  
1. Primary  objective:  
To assess the efficacy and safety of LMIS 25 mg for up to 24 weeks following 2 subcutaneous 
doses given 12 weeks apart in subjects with prostate cancer   
2. Secondary objective:  
To establish a PK profile of serum leuprolide for LMIS 25 mg in a subset of subjects with 
prostate cancer  
Ⅲ. Study drug:  
1. Name:  Leuprolide Mesylate Injectable Suspension  (LMIS ) 
2. Dosage form: Leuprolide extended release injectable suspension (US) or Leuprolide 
prolonged -release suspension for injection (EU), p refilled and supplied in 
one sterile syringe, re ady-to-use  
3. Dose: 25 mg  (as the mesylate salt)  
4.  Active ingredient: Leuprolide mesylate  
5. Dosing schedule: 25 mg leuprolide mesylate administered subcutaneously, when given as 
two separate injections at 12 weeks  apart ( Day 0  and Day 84).  
6.  Mechanis m of action:  
The LH -RH agonist leuprolide, is known to inhibit pituitary gonadotropin secretion and 
suppress testicular and ovarian steroidogenesis. Continuous administration has been shown 
to maintain testosterone suppression . Serum testosterone concentr ations in males have been 
reduced to levels associated with castration (≤  50 ng/dL in serum). This effect is generally 
observed within two to four weeks after the start of treatment and is maintained as long as 
treatment continues. Induction and maintenanc e of castrate levels of serum testosterone in 
prostate cancer is a standard form of  palliative treatment with a profound effect on  cancer 
cell growth. LMIS 25 mg contains 25 mg leuprolide mesylate formulated in 
 and , to provide a 
sustain ed release of the bioactive leuprolide over a 3-month period after subcutaneous

Ⅷ. Study design:  
This is a multi -nation al, multi -center, open -label, single -arm study to determine the efficacy, 
safety, and pharmacokinetic profile of LMIS 25 mg in subject s with prostate cancer. The study 
duration is approximately 24 weeks . Two doses of LMIS 25 mg will be given to subjects by 
separate subcutaneous injection approximately 12 weeks  apart in an unblinde d manner . LMIS 
25 mg will be administered on Day 0 (Visit 2) and Day 84 (Visit 13 ; week 12 ). At the end of 
week 12 (Day 84), all subjects who have tolerated LMIS 25 mg will be administered the 
second dose of LMIS 25 mg and will be followed for tolerability , safety, efficacy , and PK/PD 
parameters  for another 12 weeks  (Day 168 ; week 24 ).  
Blood samples will be collected at baseline (Day 0)  before LMIS 25 mg administration , 
immediately after LMIS 25 mg injection, and at specified time points to determine the 
pharmacokinetic (PK)  and pharmacodynamics profiles of leuprolide  and serum testosterone 
levels , respectively.  The serum levels of testosterone , leuprolide , PSA, and luteinizing  
hormone  (LH) will be measured during the study period. The PK parameters of leup rolide will 
be determined during the study period . 
The study period in the first enrolled 30 subjects  (considered as a subset of subjects)  will be 
extended for another 2  week s post Day 168 (Day 182  ± 3 days; week 26; Visit 23) to obtain 
the extended PK /PD profile of serum leuprolide  and testosterone levels . Approximately 13 3 
subjects will be enrolled in this study.  
All AEs and serious adverse events ( SAEs) which occur during the study period will be 
recorded in the case report forms ( CRFs ) and followed unti l resolution or  until they  are 
considered stable. In addition, SAEs will be recorded and reported as required by both local 
and international regulatory requirements.  
For early -termination (ET) subjects, phone contacts should be performed at 12 weeks  after 
the last injection of the investigational product  to collect drug -related AEs, concomitant 
medication or non -drug therapy received for AE treatment, disease progression status, and 
subject survival status.

Medical and medication history (including procedural and surgical history, blood donations, and vaccinations) will be recorded up to 6 months 
prior to screening visit. Concomitant medication use will be recorded up to 6 months prior to screening visit.  
3 Height will be only measured at screening visit. Weight will be measured at screening visit, Day 84, and Day 168 (EOS/ET).  
4 Vital signs include BP, HR, RR, and BT. 
5 12-lead ECG monitoring will be performed at specified time points. When 12-lead ECG has to be performed on dosing days, it will be performed 
prior dosing and at 4-hour post LMIS 25 mg injection in all subjects on dosing days (Days 0 and Day 84).  
6 Testosterone samples will be collected in the morning at specified time points as shown in the above schedule. On dosing days (Day 0 and Day 
84), blood samples for testosterone analysis will be collected before LMIS 25 mg administration. Serum testosterone levels will be analyzed at 
the QPS Bioanalytical Lab. For fast turn-around of assay results, a sample for the screening testosterone will also be sent to the Central Lab. After

diagnostic assays for fast turn-around of results. 
7 LH samples will be collected in the morning at specified time points as shown in the above schedule. On dosing days (Day 0 and Day 84), blood 
samples for LH analysis will be collected before LMIS 25 mg administration. Serum samples for LH concentrations will be analyzed at the BA 
lab using a validated ELIS A method. More frequent tests of LH may be ordered by the investigators at their discretion, and these samples can 
be analyzed at the Central Lab for a faster data turn-around. Serum samples to the BA Lab will be batched and shipped periodically. 
8 Hematology tests include CBC, Hb, Hct, RBC count, WBC count with differential, and platelet count.  
9 Biochemistry tests include ALT, AST, ALP, total bilirubin, BUN, Serum Cr, electrolytes (K, Na, Mg, Ca and P), blood glucose, and lipid profile 
(LDL, HDL, triglycerides).  
10 Urinalysis tests include pH, specific gravity, leukocyte, erythrocyte, urine glucose, nitrate, and protein.  
Note: Regarding the time window for blood sample collection, at 2, 4, 8 hours post LMIS 25 mg administration on Day 0 (Visit 1) and 
Day 84 (Visit 13), a 15-minute time window is allowed ; at Visits 6 to 9 (Day 7 to Day 28, week 4), a ± 1-day window is allowed. At

NTRODUCTION 
1.1. Background Information 
Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of deaths in men globally. [1, 2]. In the absence of 
sc
reening, disease progression of prostate cancer is asymptomatic in early stages and therefore, it is 
of
ten diagnosed late. More than 90% of prostate tumors are found locally or regionally. Men aged 
65 
years or older are the major group at risk; other common risk factors include ethnicity, family 
history, dietary habits, smoking, and occupational exposure. Since 1990, the use of molecular 
screening methods has greatly increased the diagnosis rate and the percentages of patients 
receiving early treatments [3]. 
Therapeutic choice for the treatment of prostate cancer is determined based on age, tumor grade 
and stage as well as other medical conditions. In conjunction with radiation and chemotherapy, 
hormona
l therapy is widely used in the treatment of prostate cancer patients. Recent evidence has 
sugg
ested that disease progression of prostate cancer is highly dependent on androgen levels. Long 
ter
m hormonal control helps to alleviate the growth of proliferating prostate cancer cells and may 
be
 beneficial to patient survival [4,5]. On this basis, the development of androgen deprivation 
therapy (ADT) has been the mainstay of hormonal treatment for prostate cancer over the years. 
Thus, various types of pharmaceutical agents have been developed to produce the effect of medical 
castration. These agents include gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, GnRH 
antagonist, estrogen agonist, and androgen inhibitors [6,7,8].  
1.2. The Development of Leuprolide Acetate 
Chronic administration of GnRH agonist leads to down-regulation of GnRH receptors in the 
pituitary gland, which results in the complete suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH), 
follicle
-stimulating hormone, and gonadal steroids after an initial stimulatory phase. Among 
c
urrently available GnRH agonists, administration of leuprolide acetate has shown satisfactory 
efficacy with tolerable side-effects [9 ]. 
Leuprolide acetate is the synthetic analogue of naturally-occurring GnRH. Chemically modified on 
residues 6 and 10, leuprolide acetate possess es higher binding affinity to androgen receptors and is 
more stable than the naturally-occurring GnRH [10 ]. Within weeks of treatment, prostate cancer 
patients receiving leuprolide acetate showed significant suppression of serum testosterone level, 
similar to surgical castration. Treatment with a GnRH agonist is considered the standard of care for 
palliative therapy for prostate cancer patients.

.3. Study Rationale 
Leuprolide acetate (Lupron Depot®)  was initially given by daily subcutaneous injections when it 
wa
s first approved in 1985. Eligard® 22.5 mg (Sanofi-Aventis US, LLC) was a novel formulation 
incor
porating leuprolide acetate with a biodegradable polymer matrix (Atrigel® delivery system). It 
was designed to deliver 22.5 mg of leuprolide acetate at a controlled rate over a 3-month period of 
ti
me. Thorough mixing of leuprolide acetate lyophilized powder and the co-polymer, poly (D,

-lactide- co-glycolide) (PLGA) prior to subcutaneous injection was essential and critical for 
de
livering a sufficient dose. Improvements in depot formulations enabled convenient subcutaneous 
or
 intramuscular injection of leuprolide given in the monthly basis. A variety of sustained-release 
for
mulations are now commercially available and some in development, including leuprolide 
mes
ylate. The current investigational product, LMIS 25 mg (Foresee Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd), is 
the me
sylate salt of leuprolide with biological activity comparable to Eligard® 22.5 mg. LMIS 25 
mg
 is designed to deliver 25 mg of leuprolide mesylate at a controlled rate over a 3-month period. 
The
 LMIS 25 mg formulation uses the same solvent,  
How
ever, a different polymer system,  is a pplied to allow 
sustained release of leuprolide. LMIS 25 mg successfully solved the stability issues of Eligard®. 
Thus, 
LMIS 25 mg is supplied as a single, sterile, pre-filled syringe. It is ready- to-use; no 
premixing is required prior to subcutaneous injection.  
Preclinical investigations with LMIS 25 mg have shown similar biological activity, 
pha
rmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety profiles, when compared to Eligard® 22.5 mg. A 
3-month depot leuprolide acetate formulation has been shown to possess similar clinical efficacy 
a
nd side effect profiles to marketed depot formulations. The 3-month depot formulation is 
c
onsidered a convenient treatment option for patients with prostate cancer [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. A 
12-month, open-label, multicent er clinical trial showed that in patients with prostate cancer, 
6-month leuprolide acetate injections induced reliable and effective suppression of testosterone 
c
omparable to bilateral orchiectomy [17]. A recent large-scale study also has shown favorable 
results [9] with 6-month leuprolide acetate treatment. Notably, a lower dose of leuprolide acetate 
a
lso showed efficacy in achieving castrat e testosterone levels and with tolerable safety profile in 
Asian prostate cancer patients [19]. Thus, different dosage forms of leuprolide acetate have been 
developed. 
With regard to human use experience with leuprolide mesylate injectable suspension (LMIS) 
de
veloped by Foresee, a recent Phase III study using LMIS 50 mg as a 6-month deport formulation 
in 
prostate cancer patients (study number FP01C-13-001) wa s conducted. The study design of 
FP01C-13-001 was in accordance with prior discussion with the FDA and was conducted in the 
USA, Europe, and Taiwan. Briefly, 137 subjects with prostate cancer were enrolled in the 
mul
ti-
nation al, multi-center, single-arm, open-label study. These subjects were treated with 2 
subcu
taneous doses of LMIS 50 mg given 6 months apart. Primary endpoints included sa fe ty and 
tolerability assessments throughout 1 year of treatment; efficacy evaluation was based on the 
percentage of subjects with a serum testosterone concentration suppressed to castrate levels (≤ 50 
ng/dL) by Day 28 ± 1 day following the first injection of LMIS 50 mg and the percentage of 
subj
ects with serum testosterone suppression (≤ 50 ng/dL) from Day 28 through Day 336 
(r
emaining duration of the study). The assessment of PK profile of leuprolide mesylate was also 
included.  
I
n the Phase III study (study number FP01C-13-001), a total of 137 subjects were enrolled and 
re
ceived at least one dose of the study drug (ITT population), and 124 subjects completed the study 
without major protocol violations that would affect the primary efficacy endpoint (per-protocol 
population (PP
)). The primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in 97.0% of subjects in both ITT 
a
nd PP populations. The 95% confidence interval from Kaplan-Meier estimates was (92.2%, 
98.9%), and the 95% Repeated-Confidence Interval (RCI) was (92.5%, 99.4%). By Day 28, mean 
testost
erone concentration was suppressed below the castrate level to 17.6 ng/dL, and the

28 suppre
ssion rate was 98.5% (135 out of 137 subjects achieved medical castration). No mean 
increase in testosterone was observed after the second injection. Four subjects did not have 
successful suppression of testosterone by the primary efficacy endpoint analysis, two of whom  
failed to achieve castration level on Day 28 and the other two had transient testosterone escapes.   
The secondary endpoints of this study were to determine the effect of LMIS 50 mg on (1) the 
proportion of subjects exhibiting post-suppression excursions of serum testosterone to > 50 ng/dL, 
either through “breakthrough” (i.e., episodes unrelated to LMIS 50 mg dosing), or through the 
“acute-on-chronic” surge (i.e., related to the second dose of LMIS 50 mg), (2) the effect of LMIS 
50 mg
 on serum PSA levels, (3) the effect of LMIS 50 mg on serum LH levels.    
I
n the FP01C-13-001 study, only two subjects exhibited post-suppression excursions. These 
post
-suppression excursions occurred after the second dose of LMIS 50 mg injection on Day 168 
to Day 171. These effects were attributed to mild, transient acute-on-chronic surge. Serum 
testost
erone levels in all the above subjects returned to below the castrate level shortly thereafter. 
No 
other breakthrough of serum testosterone to > 50 ng/dL was observed in this study.  
The
 administration of LMIS 50 mg significantly reduced the serum PSA levels from the first 
inj
ection until the end of study in both ITT and PP populations. The mean serum PSA level was 
re
duced by almost 85% and 89%, in ITT and PP populations, respectively, compared to the mean 
baseline level. The administration of LMIS 50 mg also significantly reduced the mean serum LH 
l
evels after the first injection and this effect remained until the end of study. The average serum LH 
level
 was significantly reduced by 98% by Day 336 in both ITT and PP populations.  
W
ith regard to the safety of LMIS 50 mg in prostate cancer patients, of 137 subjects enrolled, the 
most
 common (≥5%) TEAEs observed by preferred term was hot flush (48.9%), followed by 
hypertension (14.6%), pain in extremity (9.5%), injection site pain (7.3%), arthralgia (6.6%), 
fatigue (6.6%), nocturia (5.8%), back pain (5.1%) and nasopharyngitis (5.1%). With regard to the 
se
verity of TEAEs, most TEAEs were mild or moderate. Of 137 enrolled subjects, 62% subjects 
(85/137) were reported with drug-related AEs determined by investigators. The most common 
(≥5%) drug-related AEs observed by preferred term was hot flush (48.2%), followed by injection 
site pain (7.3%) and fatigue (5.8%).  
There were 3 deaths reported (3/137, 2.2%) in this study. All three fatal events were determined to 
be
 unrelated to the use of LMIS 50 mg by investigator.  Overall, the administration of LMIS 50 mg 
demonstrated a tolerable safety profile similar to that of Eligard® 45 mg . A 1-year (2 years total 
exposure) safety extension study of LMIS 50 mg in prostate cancer patients has been initiated and 
is currently ongoing to follow up on the safety profile of LMIS 50 mg (FP01C-13-001-EX). 
F
oresee Pharmaceuticals is  currently developing leuprolide mesylate 25 mg injectable suspension 
(
LMIS 25 mg) as a line-extension product. Foresee expects that the subcutaneous injection of 
LMIS 25 mg will be equivalent or similar to the pharmacodynamic effects of the Eligard® 22.5 mg 
3-month depot formulation in subjects with prostate cancer. The current study is designed to 
de
termine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of LMIS 25 mg for up to 24 weeks of exposure in 
subj
ects with prostate cancer. Moreover, the pharmacokinetic profile of serum leuprolide following 
2 separate subcutaneous injections of LMIS 25 mg will be evaluated.

DY DESIGN 
3.1. Overall Design 
This is a multi-national, multi-center, open -label, single-arm study.  All subjects will be males with 
prostate cancer judged to be candidates for medical androgen ablation therapy and all will receive 
L
MIS 25 mg in an unblinded fashion. Subjects with morning serum testosterone level > 150 ng/dL 
a
t screening, adequate organ functions, ECOG performance score ≤ 2, and have a life expectancy of 
a
t least 18 months will be eligible to enter the study. 
The
 study duration is approximately 24 weeks. Two separate doses of LMIS 25 mg will be given to 
subjects by subcutaneous injection at 12 weeks apart in an unblinded manner. LMIS 25 mg will be 
a
dministered on Day 0 (Visit 2) and Day 84 (Visit 13). At the end of 12 weeks (Day 84), all 
subj
ects who have tolerated LMIS 25 mg will be administered the second dose of LMIS 25 mg and 
will be followed for tolerability, safety, efficacy, PK/PD parameters for another 12 weeks (Day 
168/week 24).   
To evaluate the sustained castration testosterone level after two doses of LMIS 25 mg injections, the 
first enrolled 30 subjects are considered as a sub set for PK assessment and will be followed for an 
a
dditional 2 weeks (Day 182/week 26) post Day 168 (week 24) to establish the extended 
pha
rmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics profiles of serum leuprolide and testosterone levels. This 
a
dditional sampling is meant to assess the flexibility of the time period between doses during 
routine
 use of LMIS 25 mg. 
The efficacy assessments will be performed in both ITT and PP populations. Efficacy assessment 
will
 include the percentage of subjects reached the castrate levels (≤ 50 ng/dL) of serum 
testost
erone on Day 28 (week 4) post the first dosing of LMIS 25 mg, the effect of LMIS 25 mg on 
se
rum levels of testosterone, PSA, and luteinizing hormone (LH). The acute-on-chronic (surge) 
e
ffect of serum testosterone and LH will also be monitored in all subjects. In addition, the effects of 
L
MIS 25 mg on the percentage of subject with PSA relapse and on the percentage of subjects that 
a
chieves normal serum PSA level will be determined at the end of study. 
Safety assessments will include AE/SAE monitoring. All AEs and SAEs that occur during the study 
pe
riod will be recorded in Case Report Forms (CRFs) and followed until resolution or until the 
e
vents are considered stable. In addition, SAEs will be recorded and reported as required by both 
loca
l and international regulatory requirements.  
Additional safety assessments include vital signs , ph ysical examinations, local injection site 
reaction, assessments of bone pain, urinary signs, and symptoms, and laboratory assessments.  
All conc
omitant medication used during the study period will be recorded in the CRF until the end 
of the study. 
Pharmacokinetic assessments of serum leuprolide level s will  be performed using a validated liquid 
c
hromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method. To evaluate the sustained 
c
astration testosterone level after two doses of LMIS 25 mg injections, the first 30 subjects will 
ha
ve extended sampling time points to establish the full PK/PD profile of serum leuprolide by 
coll
ecting blood samples on Day 0 (prior to the first dose of LMIS 25 mg, and at 2, 4, and 8 hours 
post-dose), Days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, 77, 84 (week12: prior to the second dose and at 2, 4,

nd 168 (week 24/end of study (EOS)). 
The
 pharmacokinetic parameters of leuprolide will be determined during the study period using 
non-compartmental approaches with Phoenix WinNonlin®, including  Cmax, Tmax, Cweek4, Cweek12 , 
AUC 0-week4 , AUC 0-week 12, Cavg(0-12week)  after each dose. The Day 182 (week 26) leuprolide serum 
c
oncentration data from the first 30 subjects will also be determined. 
Serum testosterone and LH levels will be determined in all subjects using blood samples collected 
at t
he specified time points along with serum leuprolide analysis.

.3. Withdrawal Criteria 
Discontinuation from study is defined as discontinuation of all study visits and examinations. 
P
articipants may voluntarily withdraw from the study for any reason at any time. They may be 
considered withdrawn if they state an intention to withdraw, or fail to return for visits, or become 
lost to follow up for any other reason. 
Subjects will be withdrawn from the study if any of the following occurs during the study period, 
i.e. f
rom screening visit to the end of study (EOS): 
(
1) Lost to follow-up  
(
2) Subject withdrew consent 
(3) In investigator’s opinion that treatment with prohibited medications is needed  
(

5.1. Treatment Plan Summary 
This is a multi-nation al, multi-center, Phase III, open-label, single dose study. All eligibl e 
subjects will receive two separate doses of LMIS 25 mg by subcutaneous injection with 12 weeks 
a
part.  
LMIS 25 mg is a pre-mixed drug product containing 25 mg leuprolide mesylate (equivalent to 21 
mg
 of leuprolide free base) formulated in a suspension of NMP and PLGA to control and sustain 
the r
elease of the bioactive leuprolide over a 3-month period after a single subcutaneous 
a
dministration. It is intended to be used as the palliative treatment of prostatic cancer. 
Subject s with prostate cancer will be screened and enrolled into this study if eligible. After 
e
nrollment, subjects will receive the first dose of LMIS 25 mg by subcutaneous injection on Day 
0 a
nd then receive the second dose of LMIS 25 mg on Day 84 (week 12 after the first dose). All 
subj
ects will be followed for at least another 12 weeks after the second dose administration.  
5
.2. Treatment Assignment 
Subjects will be assigned a screening number after the subject signs the informed consent 
document. Only qualified subjects will be enrolled and uniquely identified by an enrolled number. 
The
 enrolled number should be recorded on the CRF.

.3. Description of Study Drug 
Leuprolide is a synthetic nonapeptide analog and agonist of the naturally occurring LH-RH or 
GnRH receptor. Leuprolide is a more potent agonist of the GnRH receptors relative to the natural 
GnRH peptide due to its increased affinity for the GnRH receptors and longer half-life. As a GnRH 
agonist, leuprolide functions as an inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion when administered 
continuously in therapeutic doses. Leuprolide acetate was introduced in 1985 for the treatment of 
prostate cancer as an alternative to surgical castration and estrogen therapy (NDA 19-010). Subjects 
with prostate cancer tend to accept this palliative treatment from a psychologic standpoint because it 
avoids
 surgical castration and also because its effects on gonadotropin are reversible when treatment 
is discontinued. 
Foresee Pharmaceuticals is developing LMIS 25 mg for the palliative treatment of prostate cancer. 
L
MIS 25 mg  is prefilled and supplied in a ready- to- use sterile syringe for subcutaneous injection 
and it is expected to deliver 25 mg  leuprolide mesylate per syringe in a biodegradable poly 
(D,L-Lactide- co-Glycolide) (PLGA) polymer formulation dissolved in a biocompatible solvent, 
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Investigational product dose administration procedures are 
outl
ined in the Investigational Product Instruction Manual. 
5.4. Rationale for Dose 
The LMIS 25  mg dosage form has been developed to deliver bioactive leuprolide over a 3-month 
pe
riod after subcutaneous administration with a controlled-release profile similar to that of the 
Foresee Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd

ard® 22.5 mg formulation. The LMIS 25 mg dosage and its use as a sustained-release or depot 
dosag
e form have shown to be both efficacious and safe in similar leuprolide products (i.e., 
Elig
ard® 22.5 mg) as summarized in the Investigator Brochure. 
5
.5. Warning and Precautions 
LMIS 25 mg contains the active pharmaceutical ingredient of leuprolide. Thus, the use of LMIS 25 
mg may cause adverse events similar to the established AE profiles observed in the use of leuprolide 
a
cetate. 
Leuprolide acetate has the following established significant AEs : 
 Tr ansient clinical testosterone flare reaction in men with prostate cancer 
 Oste oporosis 
Like other LH-RH analogs, leuprolide acetate causes a transient increase in the serum concentration 
of testosterone during the first week of treatment. This effect may cause subject s to experience a 
worsening of symptoms or an onset of new symptoms including bone pain, neuropathy, hematuria, or 
ureteral or bladder outlet obstruction. Long-term use of an LH-RH agonist has been reported to 
decrease bone mineral density which can increase the risk of osteoporosis and skeletal bone fractures. 
Other reported adverse events of leuprolide acetate include hypogonadism, reduction in glucose 
tol
erance, metabolic syndrome, anemia, and prolongation of the QT/QTc interval. 
5.6. Packaging and Labeling 
LMIS 25 mg will be provided to the investigator in a single use kit by Foresee Pharmaceuticals Co., 
Ltd
, or its designee. A sterile syringe pre-filled with LMIS 25 mg suspension will be supplied with a 
standard, sterile 18 gauge needle, a plunger rod, and a backstop to facilitate subcutaneous injection. 
LMIS 25 mg pre-filled syringes are individually packaged in blisters which are placed in individual 
carton boxes. LMIS 25 mg kits are to be stored at 2 – 8C.  
Ea
ch site will be provided with emergency back-up kits of study drug in case of contamination or 
other
 loss. The investigational sites will be directed to assign specific emergency kits to individual 
subj
ects when needed by matching the subject’s code to the kit label. 
All 
investigational products are labeled with the information below; however, any additional 
infor
mation appearing on the label will conform to local regulatory requirements. 
 P roduct name 
 B atch number 
 Protocol number

5.7. Supply, Delivery, Storage of Study Drug 
LMIS 25 mg  (investigational product, IP) is  supplied by Foresee Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. The IP 
will be shipped to the study site by a contracted delivery agent. The representative PI of the site will 
be in charge of the management and dispensation of the IP. Shipping receipts from receipt of IP or 
shipment of IP should be retained by the investigational site as part of the study records. 
LMIS 25 mg kits will be managed and stored at 2 – 8C, safely, and properly in a secured, lockable 
a
rea by a designated, qualified person at the investigative site. 
5.8. Drug Dispensation and Accountability 
The investigational product will be administered to the subject by site staff designated by PI. The 
investi
gator s and/or pharmacists must maintain records of the IP’s delivery to the study site, the IP 
inventory at the site, the use by each subject, and the return to the sponsor or alternative disposition 
of unused IP. These records will include dates of administration, batch/serial numbers, used-by 
da
tes, and the subject (enrollment ) number  assigned to the study subject. At the time of return to the 
sponsor or alternative disposition, investigators must verify that all unused or partially used IP have 
be
en returned by the investigational sites and no remaining IP is in the investigators’ possession. 
The
 investigator or his/her delegate should complete the Study Treatment Record in the CRF. 
5.9. Trea
tment Exposure and Compliance 
All subject s will be administered LMIS 25 mg  via subcutaneous injection at the study site. The 
a
dministration of the IP to the subject will be under the supervision of the investigator and 
controlled by the clinical site personnel delegated to IP dispensing, preparation, and administration 
role
s by PI. 
5.10. Treatment for Investigational Product Overdose 
The single-dose LMIS 25 mg will be carefully administered to each subject in two separate doses at 
12 we
eks apart by investigator s o r professional clinical site personnel delegated by the investigator. 
If any accidental overdose injection is given, the subject should be closely monitored for safety and 
terminated from the study.

Eligibility should be thoroughly checked by the investigator at the screening visit. See Section 
4.1 and Section 4.2, Inclusion and exclusion Criteria for details. 
7.1.4. E COG performance status 
ECOG performance status should be checked at the screening visit and on Day 0. The 
de
scription of the ECOG performance status scale is as follows: 
0: Normal activity. Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without 
restriction. 
1: Symptoms, but ambulatory. Restricted in physically strenuous activity, but ambulatory and 
able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature (e.g., light housework, office work). 
2:
 In bed < 50% of the time. Ambulatory and capable of all self-care, but unable to carry out 
a
ny work activities. Up and about more than 50% of waking hours. 
3: In bed > 50% of the time. Capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair more 
than 50%
 of waking hours. 
4: 100% bedridden. Completely disabled. Cannot carry on any self-care. Totally confined to 
bed or chair. 
5: Dead 
7.2. Efficacy Assessment 
Efficacy assessments will be performed based on the study schedule ( T able 1a  and 1b ). The 
pr
imary endpoint of efficacy is to determine the percentage of subjects with a serum testosterone 
concentration suppressed to castrate levels (≤ 50 ng/dL) on Day 28 ± 1 day (week 4) following the 
fir
st injection of LMIS 25 mg, and the proportion of subjects with serum testosterone suppression 
(≤ 50 ng/dL) from Day 28 ± 1 day (week 4) through Day 168 ± 5 days (week 24) until the end of 
the stud
y.  
The proportion of subjects exhibiting post-suppression breakthrough of serum testosterone to > 
50 ng
/dL from Day 28 ± 1 day (week 4) through Day 168 ± 5 days (week 24) until the end of the 
stud
y will also be determined. 
The secondary endpoints will determine the mean acute-on-chronic changes in serum 
testosterone level before injection of the second dose LMIS 25 mg on Day 84 (week 12) and on 
Da
ys 85, 86, 87 (week 13), and 98 (2 weeks post the second injection). The percentage of 
subjects observed with acute-on-chronic (surge) effect on serum testosterone and LH levels just 
be
fore the second dose administration and on Day 1 to Day 3 (Days 85, 86, 87) and 14 days (Day 
98) post the second injection of LMIS 25 mg will be analyzed.  
The
 effect of LMIS 25 mg on serum LH levels and the percentage of subjects with enhanced 
se
rum testosterone concentration suppression to ≤ 20 ng/dL on Day 28 ± 1 day (week 4) and on 
Da
y 168 ± 5 days (week 24) by LMIS 25 mg administration will also be determined. In addition, 
the e
ffects of LMIS 25 mg on the percentage of subject with PSA relapse and the percentage of 
subjects that achieves normal serum PSA level will be determined at the end of study.

56 7.2.1. Horm one level 
Serum testosterone will be examined at the screening visit for eligibility (> 150 ng/dL). The 
sc
reening sample of testosterone for eligibility will be sent to the Central Lab for analysis using a 
va
lidated commercial assay. Thereafter, the serum testosterone can be sent to the Central Lab for 
a
nalysis at the investigator’s discretion. The serum testosterone will also be measured at baseline 
(Day 0) and at each visit for analysis at the Bioanalytical Lab. Blood samples will be collected 
from approximately 133 subjects in the study.  
After enrollment, serum testosterone concentration in all subjects will be determined at baseline 
(D
ay 0) and at specified time points and will be sent for a nalysis at the Bioanalytical Lab. Blood 
samples for serum testosterone concentration measurement will be collected from all 133 
subj
ects in the present study. 
Serum testosterone concentrations will be measured by a validated LC/MS/MS method. The 
method va
lidation follows the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Guideline on Bioanalytical 
Method Validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009) and the FDA Guidance for Industry: 
Bioanalytical Method Validation, May 2001.  
For a faster sample turn-around, additional serum testosterone samples can also be analyzed by a 
validated, commercial diagnostic method. Additional testosterone tests (by a commercial method) 
will be ordered at a routine frequency of no more than monthly, which is consistent with 
standard medical practice for leuprolide therapy for t he purpose of safety monitoring. More 
frequent tests may be ordered by the investigators at their discretion. 
Serum samples for LH concentrations will be analyzed at the BA lab using a validated ELSIA 
method. More frequent te sts  of LH may be ordered by the investigators at their discretion, and 
these samples can be analyzed at the Central Lab for a faster data turn-around. 
To establish the extended serum PK/PD relationship between leuprolide and testosterone levels, 
blood samples for determining the serum testosterone concentrations will be collected in the first 
e
nrolled 30 subjects on Day 0 (prior to the first dose of LMIS 25 mg and 2 h, 4 h, and 8 h post 
dose
), Days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, 77, 84 (week 12: prior to the second dose and 2 h, 4 h,

7.3. Safety Assessment 
7.3.1.  Physical examinations and v ital signs 
Physical examination will be performed in all subjects at the screening visit, Day 84 ± 1 day 
(w
eek 12), and Day 168 ± 5 days (week 24, EOS/ET), by standard physical examination 
including
 general appearance, skin, eyes, ear/nose/throat (ENT), head and neck, heart, chest and 
lungs, abdomen, extremities, lymph nodes, musculoskeletal, neurological, and other body 
systems if applicable for describing the status of the subject’s health. 
Changed in physical examinations with clinical significance compared to baseline by principal 
investi
gator’s judgment will be analyzed. 
Height in centimeters (cm) will be measured while the subject is standing after removing his 
shoes, and the measurement will only be conducted at screening visit. Body weight will be 
mea
sured at the screening visit, Day 84 (week 12), and Day 168 ± 5 (week 24, EOS/ET) to the 
ne
arest 0.1 kilogram (kg) or pound (lb.) in indoor clothing without shoes. 
Vital signs will be measured at each visit, including resting blood pressures, heart rate, 
respiratory rate, and body temperature. 
7.3.2. L ocal injection site reaction assessment 
The
 specific injection location chosen should be an area with sufficient soft or loose 
subcutaneous tissue, for example, the upper- or mid-abdominal area. Local AEs hav e been 
reported in Eligard® studies. The local AEs t ypically seen with subcutaneously injected products 
include: transient burning, stinging, and pruritus at the injection site and are typically of mild 
int
ensity and brief duration. 
The local injection site reaction assessments should include itchiness, erythema, burning and 
sti
nging sensation. Assessments will be carried out after investigational product administration 
a
nd recorded on Day 0, Day 1, Day 2, Day 84, Day 85, and Day 86.  
An
y local site injection reactions will be captured under AE reporting at the next follow up visit 
if 
last longer than 3 days with any severity post LMIS 25 mg administration. The grading for the 
assessment of
 local injection reaction is provided in  Table 2.

Urinalysis will be collected from all subjects to assess the safety profile of LMIS 25 mg. The 
ur
inalyses will include urine pH, specific gravity, leukocyte, erythrocyte, urine glucose, nitrate, 
a
nd protein. 
The urinalysis will be performed at screening, Day 0 (prior to dosing), Day 14 ± 1 day (week 2), 
Da

7.3.5. E CG 
ECG examination will be performed by standard 12-lead at the screening visit for eligibility and 
on Day 0 (prior to dosing and at 4-hour post-dosing), Day 28 ± 1 day (week 4), Day 84 ± 1 (prior 
to dos
ing and at 4-hour post-dosing, week 12), and Day 168 ± 5 (week 24, EOS/ET).  
7.3.6. B one pain 
Pain is a common problem for men with prostate cancer, but not all men will have pain. The 
most
 common cause of pain is because cancer has spread to the bones, but even that more than 
25% 
of men don’t have any pain. If cancer has spread to several other body organs, men often 
only have pain in a few of these organs.  
Bone pain caused by cancer which has spread to the bones has a very specific feeling. Some 
subjects describe it as feeling similar to a toothache but in the bones, or like a dull aching or 
stabbing. Bone pain will be assessed by subject visual assessment scales (VAS) ranging from 1 
(no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) (see App endix II ), and will be evaluated at baseline (Day 0, 
pr
e dose), Day 1, Day 7 ± 1 day (week 1), Day 14 ± 1 day (week 2), Day 28 ± 1 day (week 4), 
Da
y 56 ± 3 days (week 8), Day 84 ± 1 day (pre dose, week 12), Day 112 ± 3 days (week 16), 
Da
y 140 ± 3 days (week 20), and Day 168 ± 5 days (week 24, EOS/ET).  
7.3.7. Ur inary signs and symptoms 
Urinary signs and symptoms will be assessed using the International Prostate Symptom Score 
(I-PSS)  including 7 questions (See Appendix III ). Based on the total score from answering the 7 
que
stions, the urinary symptom can be assessed as: 1-7 (Mild),  8-19 (Moderate), 20-35 (Severe). 
Ur
inary signs and symptoms will be evaluated at baseline (Day 0, pre dose), Day 1, Day 7 ± 1 
da
y (week 1), Day 14 ± 1 day (week 2), Day 28 ± 1 day (week 4), Day 56 ± 3 days (week 8),

y 84 ± 1 day (pre dose, week 12), Day 112 ± 3 days (week 16) , Day 140 ± 3 days (week 20), 
a
nd Day 168 ± 5 days (week 24). 
7.3.8. Adver se events 
S
ubjects will be asked to report AEs voluntarily. The investigator will also question and examine 
the 
subjects to identify any AEs at each visit (including screening visit). See Section 9.1 and 
S
ection 9.2 for detailed information on AEs.

.4. Pharmacokinetics Assessment 
7.4.1. P harmacokinetic assessments of LMIS 25 mg  
P
harmacokinetic assessments of LMIS 25 mg will be conducted by measuring the serum 
leupr
olide concentration using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC/MS/MS) method. 
To e
valuate the sustained castration testosterone level after two doses of LMIS 25 mg injections, 
the PK/PD analysis (serum testosterone and leuprolide levels) in the first enrolled 30 subjects on 
Day 182 (week 26) will also be determined. This additional sampling is meant to assess the 
flexibility of the time period between doses during routine use of LMIS 25 mg and these 30 
subj
ects will be considered as the subset population for PK analysis. Thus, the first enrolled 30 
subj
ects will have more intensive sampling to establish the extended PK profile of serum 
leupr
olide concentrations by collecting blood samples on Day 0 (prior to the first dose of LMIS 
25 mg, and at 2, 4, and 8 hours post-dose), Days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, 77, 84 (week 12: 
pr
ior to the second dose and at 2, 4, and 8 hours post the second dose), 85, 86, 87, 98, 112, 126, 
140, 161, 168 (week 24), and 182 (week 26/ EOS/ET).  
The
 remaining approximately 103 subject will have blood samples collected for determining the 
se
rum leuprolide concentrations on Day 0 (prior to the first dose of LMIS 25 mg, and 4 hours 
post the first dose), Days 1, 3, 14, 21, 28, 56, 77, 84 (week 12: prior to the second dose and 4 
hours post dose), 85, 86, 87, 98, 112, 140, 161, and 168 (week 24/EOS/ET ). 
All blood sa
mples will be collected from subjects by direct venipuncture (approximately 6 mL 
blood per sample). With regard to the time window for blood sample collection, at Visits 6 to 9 
(
Day 7 to Day 28), a ± 1-day window is allowed. At Vis its 10 and 12 (Day 42 to Day 77), a ± 
3-day window is allowed. At Visits 13 to 16 (Day 84, week 12 visit, for the second dose injection, 
to Day 87), only ± 1-day window is allowed. At Visits 17 to 21 (Day 98 to Day 161), a ± 3-day 
window is a
llowed. At Visit 22 (Day 168/week 24), a ± 5-day window is allowed. At Visit 23 
(
Day 182/week 26), a ±3-day window is allowed. 
All PK/PD blood samples will be centrifuged for serum at 1000   g for  15 minutes  as soon as 
possi
ble after collection. The samples will be maintained in an ice bath throughout sample 
c
ollection and preparation. Please see Laboratory Manual for complete instructions.  
All samples will be packed in dry ice and sent to the analytical facility. All shipments will be 
accompanied by an inventory list with other appropriate documents. Additional details of sample 
collection, handling, and processing are outlined in the Laboratory Manual. 
7.4.2. S erum sample analysis for Leuprolide Mesylate 
S
erum sample s collected on the above specified time points will be analyzed for leuprolide 
mesylate using a validated LC/MS/MS method. 
7.4.3. P harmacokinetic analysis of Leuprolide Mesylate 
The pharmacokinetic profile of leuprolide mesylate, including C max, Tmax, Cweek4, Cwee k12, 
AUC 0-week4 , AUC 0-week12,  Cavg(0-week12)  will be determined after each dose using Phoenix 
W
inNonlin® with non-compartmental approaches.

FETY MONITORING 
9.1. Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical 
investi
gation subject administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a 
c
ausal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sig
n, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or 
not considered related to the medicinal product. However, abnormal laboratory values or changes 
are not automatically reported as an AE if they are not clinically significant. They will only be 
re
corded as AEs if a therapeutic action is needed or the investigator judges them to be clinically 
sig
nificant. 
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by non-directive questioning of the subject at each visit 
a
nd/or telephone follow-up during the study. AEs also may be detected when they are volunteered 
by the subject during or between visits or through physical examination, vital sign measurement, 
labor
atory test or other assessments. All AEs must be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF with 
the f
ollowing information: 
1. AE te rm and description 
2. D uration (onset and resolution dates or if continuing at final exam) 
3. S everity grade (mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening, death) 
4. W hether the AE constitutes an SAE 
5. Relationship to the study drug (definite/ possible/ unrelated) 
6. A ction taken and treatment required 
7. O utcome (recovered/resolved , recovered/resolved with sequelae, recovering/resolving, not 
re
covered/not resolved, fetal) 
9.1.1. T he severity grade of AEs 
The investigator will make an assessment of the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration 
of the e
vent for all AEs reported during the study period using CTCAE version 4. The assessment 
will
 be based on the investigator’s clinical judgment. The severity of each AE and SAE recorded in 
the CRF should be assigned to one of the categories as described in Table 3 .

**Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. 
9.1.2. T he relationship to study drug 
The investigator will make an assessment of the relationship between the study drug and the 
occ
urrence of each AE/SAE. The reasonable possibility of causation will be determined based on 
the investigator’s clinical judgment. The causality should be considered as one of the categories 
described in Table 4 . 
The AEs should be followed until resolution or until the event is considered stable. Both regular 
re
turn visits and telephone contacts may be required.

.2. Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, 
c
ontraindication, side effect or precaution. With respect to human clinical experience, this includes 
any event which: 
 re sults in death, 
 is l ife-threatening, 
 re quires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, unless 
hospi
talization is for: 
 routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition. 
 elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study and has not worsened since the start of study drug 
 treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
de
finitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission 
 social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the subject’s 
general condition 
 re sults in persistent of significant disability / incapacity, or 
 is a c ongenital anomaly / birth defect, 
 is a sig nificant or important medical event that, based on appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed above. 
9.3. Serious Adverse Events Reporting Requirement and Emergency 
Procedures 
Any AE which is fatal or life threatening that occurs during the study must be reported promptly 
(within 24 hours) to the sponsor (Foresee) or QPS, irrespective of whether it is related to the use of 
investigational product. If reported to QPS, QPS will inform the sponsor on the same day or at the 
earliest possible time. At the time of the reporting, the following information should be provided if 
possible: study center, subject enrollmen t number, dose cohort during which the event occurred, a 
description of the event, date of onset and current status, outcome, action taken with the 
investigational drug, the reason why the event is classified as serious, and the Investigator’s current 
a
ssessment of the association between the event and investigational drug. 
Within the required timeframe, the investigator must provide further information on each SAE to 
F
oresee/QPS, and QPS will assist the investigator in submitting the SAE to the appropriate 
I
RB/EC, ADR reporting center, and Foresee. The SAE/SUSAR (Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adve
rse Reaction) will be reported to both competent authorities and relevant IRBs/IECs in 
accordance with the regulatory requirements of the country in which the SAE occurred. 
Each recurrent episode, complication, or progression of the initial SAE should be reported as a 
follow-up to the original episode within 24 hours of the investigator’s receiving the follow-up

mation. An SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely 
unrelated to a previous one should be reported separately as a new event. 
9.4. Pregnancies 
All subjects will be instructed to use adequate contraceptive precautions until the end of study. When 
pregnancy of a subject’s spouse has been discovered, the pregnancy must be reported to 
sponsor/Contract Research Organization (CRO). The pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous or 
voluntary termination, details of the pregnancy and birth, and the presence or absence of any birth 
defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications, will be followed. The 
infant’s medical record should be followed up to 1 year after birth.

TISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYTICAL PLAN 
10.1. Sample Size 
Approximately 133 subjects are expected to be enrolled in this study. A sample size of 120 will 
a
chieve 85% power to detect a difference (P1-P0) of 0.0700 by using a one-sided binomial test. The 
target significance level is 0.0250. This assumes that the population proportion under the null 
hypothesis is 0.9000 and under the alternative to be 0.97. The estimated drop-out rate is 10%, so 
approximately 13 subjects may drop out from the study before Day 168 (week 24).

0.2. Analysis Population 
In this study, there will be three populations, including intention-to treat (ITT), per protocol (PP), 
a
nd safety populations. The ITT and PP populations will be used for the efficacy analysis. The safety 
population will only be used for the safety analysis. The populations for analysis applied in this study 
are defined as follows: 
1. The  Intention- To-Treat (ITT) population will consist of any subject receiving at least one 
dose of LMIS 25 mg . 
2. The  Per Protocol (PP) population will be composed of those subjects who received 2 doses of 
LMIS 25 mg without major deviations that will impact the assessment of the primary 
e
fficacy endpoint. 
3. The  safety population will consist of any subject receiving a dose of LMIS 25  mg. 
10.3. Analysis Method 
For descriptive statistics, continuous variables will be presented as number of observations, mean, 
standa
rd deviation (SD), median, range, Hodges-Lehmann estimator, and 95% CI. 
C
ategorical variables will be presented by frequency  and percentage. 
Changes from baseline will be tested by paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test for continuous 
variables using a significance level of 0.05.

0.4. Efficacy Analysis 
The efficacy analysis will be based on the following endpoints assessments in both ITT and PP 
population
s. 
10.4.1.  Analysis of primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint of efficacy is to determine the percentage of subjects with a serum testosterone 
concentration suppressed to castrate levels (≤ 50 ng/dL) on Day 28 ± 1 day (week 4) following the 
fir
st injection of LMIS 25 mg and to determine the proportion of subjects with serum testosterone 
suppression (≤ 50 ng/dL) from Day 28 ± 1 day (week 4) through Day 168 ± 5 days (week 24) until 
the e
nd of the study. 
The percentage of subjects with a serum testosterone concentration suppressed to castrate levels (≤ 
50 ng/dL) on Day 28 ± 1 day (week 4 ) a nd on Day 168  ± 5 days (week 24) will be analyzed using a

testost
erone suppression (≤ 50 ng/dL) from Day 28 (week 4) through Day 168 ± 5 days (week 24 ) 
will
 be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier approach. 
I
nsufficient testosterone suppression is defined as suppression that does not occur by Day 28 (week 
4)
 or occurrence of a testosterone level >50 ng/dL between Day 28 (week 4) and Day 168 (week 
24). 
The
 following efficacy analyses will be provided in detail in the statistical analysis plan: 
• The  proportion of subjects with testosterone suppression (≤ 50 ng/dL) from Day 28 
(w
eek 4) through Day 168 ± 5 days (week 24)  
• S ubjects exhibiting post-suppression breakthrough of serum testosterone to >50 
ng
/dL 
• Time to e vent : A subject with a testosterone level > 50 ng/dL between Days 28 and 
168 is considered to have an event.  
To accommodate drop-out and missing values, the data censoring rules is shown in T able 5. 
10.4.2. Anal ysis of secondary endpoints 
The analyses of secondary endpoints will be based on the following: 
• The  mean acute-on-chronic (surge) changes in testosterone and LH levels from just 
prior to the second injection through 14 days after the second injection of LMIS 25 
mg (Day 98, week 14)    
The mean acute-on-chronic changes in serum testosterone concentration will be summarized by 
descriptive statistics. The change from baseline will be summarized descriptively and a paired t-test 
or
 Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be used, data significance level of 0.05.  
• Ef fect of LMIS 25 mg on change of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels  
• Ef fect of LMIS 25 mg on change of serum LH levels 
The serum PSA levels and serum LH levels during the study will be summarized as descriptive 
statis
tics. The mean acute-on-chronic changes in LH level from after the 2nd injection of LMIS 25 
mg
 will be summarized descriptively. The change from baseline will be summarized descriptively 
a
nd a paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be used, data significance level of 0.05.  
• The  percentage of subject with PSA relapse defined as after achieving the serum 
PSA level ≤ 4 ng/mL post LMIS 25 mg injection but with an increase in serum PSA 
of
 >50% PSA nadir by Day 168 (week 24). A post hoc analysis will be performed to 
de
termine the incidence of PSA recurrence. 
The incidence of PSA relapse is defined as after achieving serum PSA level ≤ 4 ng/mL post LMIS 
25 mg
 injection but with an increase in serum PSA > 50% compared with nadir will be presented

The analysis of AEs will be tabulated by system organ class (SOC) and preferred terms according 
to t
he current MedDRA dictionary. Preferred terms will be used and presented as standardized 
tabula
tions by frequency and incidence rates. AE incidence rates will be analyzed by severity and 
re
lationship to study drug. Any AE leading to death, discontinuation from the study, or change of 
dose 
will be listed as per regulations. If any SAE occurs, a summary of the SAEs will be described 
a
nd listed.

0.6. Pharmacokinetics Analysis 
The p harmacokinetic profile of leuprolide mesylate will be determined in a sub-set of subjects (first 
30 subjects enrolled) through more intensive PK sampling. PK analyses will also be conducted for 
other
 subjects as well and results will be used as supporting data.  
The
 serum pharmacokinetic profile of leuprolide following 2 subcutaneous injections of LMIS 25 
mg given 12 weeks apart will be determined from baseline (Day 0) to Day 168 (week 24). The 
se
rum pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics levels of leuprolide, testosterone, and LH will be 
followed for
 additional 2 weeks post Day 168 (Day 182, week 26) in the first enrolled 30 subjects 
t
o evaluate the PK/PD relationship between LMIS 25 mg and the sustained castration testosterone 
level after two doses of LMIS 25 mg injections. 
The PK parameters of leuprolide will be determined during the study period, including C max, Tmax, 
Cweek4, Cweek12 , AUC 0 -week4 , AUC 0-week 12, Cavg(0- 12 week) after each dose. The Day 182 (week 26) 
leuprolide serum concentration data will also be assessed in the first enrolled 30 subjects (PK 
sub
-set). The pharmacokinetic parameters of leuprolide ( Table 6 ) will be calculated from the serum 
c
oncentrations collected during the study. Phoenix WinNonlin® will be used for the pharmacokinetic 
analyses using a non-compartmental analysis model.

tatistical analyses will be performed for serum leuprolide using the SAS system for Windows or 
P
hoenix WinNonlin®. Arithmetic means, SD, and coefficients of variation will be calculated for the 
pha
rmacokinetic parameters listed above. 
For the pharmacokinetic assessment of leuprolide , all measured values below quantifiable limit 
(B
QL) will be set to zero for all pharmacokinetic and statistical evaluation. Any missing samples will 
be reported as ‘NS’ and will not be included for pharmacokinetic or statistical analysis. 
10.7. Handling of Missing Values 
For handling missing data related to a safety or efficacy endpoints, no missing data method will be 
pe
rformed. Some situations are noted for efficacy analysis by Kaplan-Meier method: 
1. The subject has an event and it will be analyzed as an event on the day of first testosterone 
esc
ape. 
2. The subject with more than one missing testosterone value will be censored on the day of last 
mea
surement 
3. Any subject having more than one missing testosterone values will be censored on the day 
with t
he last measurement before the first missing testosterone measurement 
4. 
 If subject does not have serum testosterone suppression to castrate level (i.e. serum 
testost
erone levels > 50 ng/dL) by Day 28 (week 4), the event date will be set as Day 28 for 
the a
nalysis of percentage of subjects with testosterone suppression (≤ 50 ng/dL) from Day 
28 (week 4) through Day 168 (week 24).

In
troduction  
The World Medical Association has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of ethical 
principles to provide guidance to physicians and other participants in medical research involving 
human subjects. Medical research involving human subjects includes research on identifiable human 
material or identifiable data. 
It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of the people. The physician’s 
knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty. 
The
 Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with the words, 
"The health of my subject will be my first consideration," and the International Code of Medical 
Ethi
cs declares that, "A physician shall act only in the subject's interest when providing medical 
care which might have the effect of weakening the physical and mental condition of the subject." 
Medical progress is based on research which ultimately must rest in part on experimentation 
involving human subjects. 
In medical research on human subjects, considerations related to the well-being of the human 
subject should take precedence over the interests of science and society. 
The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to improve prophylactic, 
diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and the understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of 
disease. Even the best proven prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods must continuously 
be challenged through research for their effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality. 
In current medical practice and in medical research, most prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic 
procedures involve risks and burdens.

al research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human beings and 
protect their health and rights. Some research populations are vulnerable and need special 
protection. The particular needs of the economically and medically disadvantaged must be 
recognized. Special attention is also required for those who cannot give or refuse consent for 
themselves, for those who may be subject to giving consent under duress, for those who will not 
benefit personally from the research and for those for whom the research is combined with care. 
Research Investigators should be aware of the ethical, legal and regulatory requirements for 
research on human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international requirements. 
No national ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of 
the protections for human subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
 
Basic Principle for All Medical Research  
 
I
t is the duty of the physician in medical research to protect the life, health, privacy, and dignity of the 
human subject. 
M
edical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles, 
be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, 
and on adequate laboratory and, where appropriate, animal experimentation. 
Appropriate caution must be exercised in the conduct of research which may affect the environment, 
and the welfare of animals used for research must be respected. 
The design and performance of each experimental procedure involving human subjects should be 
clearly formulated in an experimental protocol. This protocol should be submitted for consideration, 
comment, guidance, and where appropriate, approval to a specially appointed ethical review 
committee, which must be independent of the Investigator, the sponsor or any other kind of undue 
influence. This independent committee should be in conformity with the laws and regulations of the 
country in which the research experiment is performed. The committee has the right to monitor 
ongoing trials. The researcher has the obligation to provide monitoring information to the committee, 
especially any SAEs. The researcher should also submit to the committee, for review, information 
regarding funding, sponsors, institutional affiliations, other potential conflicts of interest and 
incentives for subjects. 
The research protocol should always contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and 
should indicate that there is compliance with the principles enunciated in this Declaration. 
Medic
al research involving human subjects should be conducted only by scientifically qualified 
pe
rsons and under the supervision of a clinically competent medical person. The responsibility for 
the human subject must always rest with a medically qualified person and never rest on the subject of 
the research, even though the subject has given consent.  
Every medical research project involving human subjects should be preceded by careful assessment 
of predictable risks and burdens in comparison with foreseeable benefits to the subject or to others. 
This does not preclude the participation of healthy volunteers in medical research. The design of all 
studies should be publicly available. 
Physicians should abstain from engaging in research projects involving human subjects unless they 
are confident that the risks involved have been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily

ged. Physicians should cease any investigation if the risks are found to outweigh the potential 
benefits or if there is conclusive proof of positive and beneficial results. 
Medical research involving human subjects should only be conducted if the importance of the 
objective outweighs the inherent risks and burdens to the subject. This is especially important when 
the human subjects are healthy volunteers. 
Medical research is only justified if there is a reasonable likelihood that the populations in which the 
research is carried out stand to benefit from the results of the research. 
The subjects must be volunteers and informed participants in the research project. 
The right of research subjects to safeguard their integrity must always be respected. Every precaution 
should be taken to respect the privacy of the subject, the confidentiality of the subject’s information 
a
nd to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and mental integrity and on the 
personality of the subject. 
In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, 
methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the 
researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail. 
The subject should be informed of the right to abstain from participation in the study or to withdraw 
consent to participate at any time without reprisal. After ensuring that the subject has understood the 
information, the physician should then obtain the subject's freely-given informed consent, preferably 
in writing. If the consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non-written consent must be formally 
documented and witnessed. 
When obtaining informed consent for the research project, the physician should be particularly 
c
autious if the subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under duress. 
In that case the informed consent should be obtained by a well-informed physician who is not 
engaged in the investigation and who is completely independent of this relationship. 
For a research subject who is legally incompetent, physically or mentally incapable of giving consent 
or is a legally incompetent minor, the investigator must obtain informed consent from the legally 
authorized representative in accordance with applicable law. These groups should not be included in 
research unless the research is necessary to promote the health of the population represented and this 
research cannot instead be performed on legally competent persons.  
 
When a subject deemed legally incompetent, such as a minor child, is able to give assent to decisions 
about participation in research, the investigator must obtain that assent in addition to the consent of 
the legally authorized representative. 
Research on individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy or advance 
consent, should be done only if the physical/mental condition that prevents obtaining informed 
consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population. The specific reasons for involving 
research subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent should be stated 
in the experimental protocol for consideration and approval of the review committee. The protocol 
should state that consent to remain in the research should be obtained as soon as possible from the 
indi
vidual or a legally authorized surrogate. 
Both authors and publishers have ethical obligations. In publication of the results of research, the 
investigators are obliged to preserve the accuracy of the results. Negative as well as positive results

Additional Principles for Medical Research Combined With Medical Care  
The
 physician may combine medical research with medical care, only to the extent that the research 
is j
ustified by its potential prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic value. When medical research is 
combined with medical care, additional standards apply to protect the subjects who are research 
subjects. 
The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new method should be tested against those of the 
best current prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods. This does not exclude the use of 
placebo, or no treatment, in studies where no proven prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic method 
exists. (See footnote*) 
At the conclusion of the study, every subject entered into the study should be assured of access to the 
best proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods identified by the study. 
The physician should fully inform the subject which aspects of the care are related to the research. 
The
 refusal of a subject to participate in a study must never interfere with the subject-physician 
re
lationship. 
I
n the treatment of a subject, where proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods do not 
e
xist or have been ineffective, the physician, with informed consent from the subject, must be free 
to use unproven or new prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic measures, if in the physician’s 
judgement it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing health or alleviating suffering. Where 
possible, these measures should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate their safety 
and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, published. 
The other relevant guidelines of this Declaration should be followed.  
 
*FOOTNOTE:  
Note of Clarification on Paragraph 29 of the WMA Declaration of Helsinki 
 
The
 WMA hereby reaffirms its position that extreme care must be taken in making use of a 
placebo-controlled trial and that in general this methodology should only be used in the absence of 
existing proven therapy. However, a placebo-controlled trial may be ethically acceptable, even if 
proven therapy is available, under the following circumstances: 
- Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons its use is necessary to 
determine the efficacy or safety of a prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic method; or 
- Where a prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic method is being investigated for a minor condition 
and the subjects who receive placebo will not be subject to any additional risk of serious or 
irreversible harm.  
 
All other provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki must be adhered to, especially the need for 
appropriate ethical and scientific review.

Visual Analogue Scale 
(VAS) 
The visual analog scale (VAS) is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity in adults. For this 
scale, subjects indicate their current level of pain along a 10 cm line with ‘no pain’ at one end and 
‘w
orst pain imaginable’ at the other. The VAS score is determined by measuring the line in 
c
entimeters from the left end to the point that the subject marks his degree of pain. 
I
nstructions for producing a VAS Card: 
• P rint or photocopy the diagrams to ensure that the line is exactly 10 cm in length. 
• Advic e the subject marks on the line to the point that they feel represents their perception 
of
 their current painful states.

ENDNOTES 
* C onsider using lower than recommended starting dose in the elderly, in subjects on multiple 
drugs, and in those with renal insufficiency (one half to two thirds recommended dose). Doses must 
be
 individualized. Low initial doses should be titrated upward if tolerated and clinical effect is 
inadequate. Doses can be increased in weekly increments. Studies of NSAIDs in the cancer 
population are meager; thus dosing guidelines are empiric. 
+ Although clinical experience suggests that any of the NSAIDs may be analgesic, pain is an 
a
pproved indication only for those drugs noted. 
§ At relatively high doses, consider monitoring for adverse effects, e.g., by checking for occult 
fe
cal blood of for changes in liver function tests, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine assessments, or 
urinalysis. 
II Oral dose that provides analgesia equivalent to 650 mg of aspirin. Starting dose may be higher 
or lower, and dose titration is needed after therapy is begun. 
# Dose that provides analgesia equivalent to 10 mg of IM morphine. The equianalgesic dose 
shoul
d not be interpreted as the starting, standard, or maximum dose, but rather as a guide; 
pa
rticularly useful in switching drugs or changing routes of administration. Depending on subject 
characteristics and prior opioid exposure, the starting dose can be lower of higher, and dose 
titration-either upward or downward-is repeatedly necessary in virtually all subject s. 
** Ex tensive survey data suggest that the relative potency of IM to PO morphine of   
1:6 changes to 1:2 or 1:3 with long-term dosing.

5.1.Summary of Study Design
This study  is a multicenter, nonrandomized, open -label, dose -escalation Phase 1b trial in 
approximately  180 patients with Stage IV non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC)to receive 
abemaciclib in combinat ion with 1) pemetrexed (Part A), 2) gemcitabine (Part B), 3) 
ramucirumab (Part C), 4) LY3023414 (Part D), and 5) pembrolizumab (Part E) as shown in 
FigureJPBJ.5.1.Patients will be enro lled into 1 of 5 study parts based on prior therapy or 
histology. During dose escalat ion, cohorts of at least 3 patients will be enro lled at each of the 
planned dose l evels. Abemaciclib will be administered orally at 100 mg, 150 mg, and 200 mg 
every Q12H on Day s 1 through 21 of a 21 -day cycle.Contingency for de -escalation to 
abemaciclib at 100 mg orally Q12H on Day s 1 through 21 of a 21 -day cycle will be permi tted. 
In study Parts A and B at l east 18 and up to 24 patients, in study  Part C at least 30 and up to 42 
patients, in study  Part D, at l east 30 and up to 48 patients, and in study  Part E, at l east 21 and up 
to 30 pati ents will be treated on the twice -daily schedule at a dose no greater than the established 
single-agent MTD (200 m g Q12H) with administrati on of abemaciclib on Days 1 through 21 of a 
21-day cycle.
All patients in the study  will continue to receive abemaciclib unless 1 or more of the criteria for 
discontinuat ion are fulfilled; the fo llow-up period for poststudy evaluation is 30 the criteria the 
date of the last dose of study  drug received.

study will be descriptive, except for possible explo ratory analysis as deemed appropriate. 
Exploratory analyses of the data not described in this SAP will be conducted as deemed 
appropriate.
Data analyses will be provided by study  part, dose group, and for all study  patients com bined 
wherever appropriate.  For continuous variables, summary statist ics will include number of 
patients, mean, m edian, standard de viation, minimum, and maximum.  Categorical endpo ints 
will be summarized using number of patients, frequency, and percentages.    
The following data handling conventions will be used in the analysis (see Table 6.1).
Table 6.1. Data Handling Conventions
Term Definition or Rule
Relative Study Day If assessment is on or after date of first dose then 
(date of assessment) –(date of first study drug dose) +1
If assessment precedes first dose of drug then 
(date of assessment) –(date of first study drug dose)
There is no study day 0.  Study day 1 is the date of first dose and study day -1 is the 
day before the first dose.
Baseline For change from baseline analyses, baseline value is defined as the last reported 
measure on or before the first dose date (prior to the dose administration), unless 
otherwise specified.

(patients who took at least one dose of study  drug) will be used in analyzing patient 
characterist ics, safety and efficacy data.  All treated patients with a baseline and at least one post 
baseline observation willbe used in analyzing the MDASI -LC score.   
6.2.Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data
Missing data will not be imputed.
6.3.PatientDisposition
A detailed description o f patient disposition will be provi ded.  It will  include a summary  of the 
number and percentage of patients entered into the study , enrolled in the study , reasons for 
I3Y-MC-JPBJ Statistical Analysis Plan Version 2 Page 10
LY2835219discontinuat ion from study treatment, and reasons for discont inuation from study.  Reason for 
discontinuat ion from both study  treatment and the study will be listed by  the pre-determined 
categories. If the reason for discont inuation isadverse event ( AE)or death, the associated AE or 
cause of death will be reported. All patients entered in the study  will be included in the summary .  
All clinically relevant protocol deviat ions will be lis ted by pre-determined categories ( for 
example, inclusion/exclusion criteria, non-compliance wit h protocol procedures, drug 
dosage/intervention, use of excluded treatments, informed consent/assent process, continuing 
after meeting withdrawal criteria, or ot her).
6.4.PatientCharacteristics

Health Organizat ion (WHO) drug dictionary .  All concomitant medicat ions will be listed and 
summarized using the preferred name for all pat ients on therapy  bydose level and overall study 
part.If concomitant medicat ion use is due to an AE, the associated National Cancer Inst itute’s 
(NCI) Commo n Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE) v4.0 (NCI 2009) termwill 
be listed.
6.6.Efficacy Analyses
The study  was not designed to make an inferential efficacy assessment.  However, tumor 
response data and progression free survival (PFS) data will be listedand summarized.   
Reported l esion data (target/ non -target or m easurable/ nonmeasurable) will be listed for all
enrolledpatients.Change fro m baseline in the sum oftarget lesion size will be listed by cycle
I3Y-MC-JPBJ Statistical Analysis Plan Version 2 Page 11
LY2835219and depicted as a waterfall plot.  The waterfall plot will depict eachpatient’s best change from 
baseline in the sum o f target lesion size while on study .  
Investigator-determined response by cycle and b est overall response for each patient will be 
listed.  Best overall response will be derived based on investigator assessment of r esponse and 
Response Evaluat ion Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1 .1) (Eisenhauer et al. 2009) . Response 
will be summarized using the Overall R esponse Rate (ORR) and Disease Control Rate (DCR).  
Overall Response Rate will be defined as the percentage of e nrolled patients with a best response 
of partial response (PR) or com plete response (CR).  Disease Control Rate will be defined as the 
percentage of enro lled patients with a best response of PR, CR, or stable disease (SD). Exact 
90% confidence intervals (CIs)for each of these measures will be calculated.
Progression -free survival time will be defined as the time from first dose of any study  drug to 
progressive disease (either due to obj ective progressio n or symptomat ic progression) or death , 
whichever oc curs first.  Patients are not known to have progressedor diedwhile on study  will 
have their PFS time censored at the date of the last post baseline radiographic assessment while 
on study.  Patients for which there is no record for progression, death, or post baseline 
radiographic assessment will have their PFS time censored on the day  of first dose of any study  
drug.  Progression -free survival time will be summarized by overall study part using the Kaplan -
Meier methodafter the end of the study .  Progress ion-free survival quartiles and PFS rates at 3 
and 6 months will  be estimated along with 90% CIs. Month is defined as days/30.4375.

baseline will be summarized at each postbaseline time point specified in the study  schedule.   The 
summary at each post baseline timepo int will include mean, median, and standard deviat ion.
Hospitalizationdata will be listed.
6.8.Bioanalytical and Pharmac okinetic/Pharmacodynamic Methods
Pharmacokinet icparameter estimates will be computed forabemaciclib , its metaboli tes, and 
whenever possible, for other ant icancer agents used in the co mbination (pemetrexed, 
gemcitabine, ram ucirumab, and tramet inib).  Thes e PK parameters will be co mputed by standard 
noncompartmental methods of analysis using WinNonlin Professional Edit ion on a com puter that 
meets or exceeds the minimum requirements for this program.
The primary  parameters for analysis will be maximum concen tration (Cmax) and area under the 
concentration -time curve (AUC 0-tlast, AUC0-∞, AUC0-tau).  Other noncompartmental parameters, 
such as time of half -life (t1/2), apparent clearance (CL/F), and apparent volume o f distribution 
(V/F) may  be reported.   
In addition to a standard noncompartmental assessment, the plasma concentration data of 
abemaciclib will also be analyzed by means of a compartmental approach using NONMEM.  
Plasma data fro m all patients will be pooled for analyses to determine the compart mental PK 
parameters and between -and within-patient variabilit y.  Covariates analysis will be also 
I3Y-MC-JPBJ Statistical Analysis Plan Version 2 Page 12
LY2835219performed.  Once a structural and statist ical model has been established, the effect of patient 
factors will be assessed.  Covariate data distributions will be assessed.
Additional exploratory analyses maybe performed if warranted by  data, and other validated PK 
software programs (for example, NONMEM) may  be used if appropriate and approved by 
Global Pharm acokinetic management.  The versio n of any software used for the analysis will be 
documented, and the program will meet the Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly ) requirements of 
software validat ion.
6.9.Biomarker Analyses
Biomarker analyses rel ated to the exploratory  objectives of thi s study will be described in a 
separate SAP.
6.10.Safety Analyses
6.10.1.Extent of Exposure
The number of cycles of treatm ent received, dose delays, and dose intensit y (for both 
abemaciclib and combinat ion therapies) will be summarized. Dose intensit ywill bedefined as 
the percentage ofthe planned cum ulative dose (based on treatment assignment) administered 
during the cy cle. Dose adjust ments including the reasons for dose adjust ment will also be listed 
and summarized. 
6.10.2.Dose Limiting Toxicities
A dose-limiting toxicit y (DLT) is defined as an AE occurring between Day  1andDay 21of 
Cycle1 for a patient enrolled in the dose escalat ion phasethat is possibly  related to the study 
regimen(either abemaciclib or the combinat ion therapy)andfulfills any 1of the following 
criteria:
Grade 3 o r 4 nonhematological toxicit y according to the NCI CTCAE V4.0 except for 
nausea, vo miting, diarrhea, or electrolyte disturbance.
Grade 3 or 4 nausea, vo miting, diarrhea, or electrolyte disturbance that persists more than 
2 days despite maximal supportive i ntervention.
Grade 4 hematological toxicit y that persists more than 5 days.
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocy topenia with bleeding.
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with fever.
Investigators, together with the Lilly clinical research physician ( CRP), can declare a DLT if a 
patient is experi encingincreasing toxicit y during treatm ent, and it becomes clear that it is not 
going to be possible to complete the treatment without exposing the patient to excessive risk.
A DLT-equivalent is defined as an AE that would have met the cri teria for DLT if it had
occurred during Cycle 1 for a patient enrolled in the dose escal ation phase,butthat occurs 
I3Y-MC-JPBJ Statistical Analysis Plan Version 2 Page 13
LY2835219between1) Day 1 and Day 21of Cycle 2 and b eyond for a patient enrolled in the dose escalat ion 
phase and 2) at any  time for a patient in the dose expansio n phase. 
Investigator-reported DLTs will be listed for all patients on therapy  in the dose escalat ion 
portions of each study  part. Invest igator reported DLT -equivalent toxicit ies will also be listed for 
all patients on therapy .
6.10.3.Adverse Events
All patients who receive at least 1 dose of any study drug will be evaluated for safet y and 
toxicity.  Adverse event terms and severit y grades will be assig ned by the invest igator using 
CTCAE, v4.0.In addition, AE verbat im text will also be mapped by the sponsor or designeeto 
corresponding termino logy within the Medical Dicti onary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA )
dictionary.  Adverse event s will be repor ted using a unified CTCAE/MedDRA reporting process:
The CTCAE v4.0 term reported by  the invest igator will be mapped to the MedDRA PT 
and system organ class ( SOC)of the corresponding MedDRA lowest level term (LLT), 
unless the reported CTCAE term is ‘Other –specify’
If the reported CTCAE term is ‘Other –specify’ the MedDRA LLT, PT and SOC 
mapped fro m the verbatim AE term will be used 
All listings and summaries will use the PT result ing from this process.
Pre-existing condit ions are defined as AEsthat beginprior to the fi rst dose of study  drug.  
A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) isdefined as any  AE that begins on or after the day 
of thefirst dose of abemaciclib or any pre-existing condit ion that increases in CTCAE grade on 
or after the day  of the first dose of abemaciclib . Comparisons of pre -existing condit ions to on-
treatment events at the LLT level will be used in the treatment -emergent computation.
A serious adverse event ( SAE)is any AE during this study  that resul ts in one of the following 
outcomes:
death
initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalizat ion (except for study  drug 
administration)
a life-threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)
persistent or s ignificant disabilit y/incapacity
congenital ano maly/birth defect
considered significant by  the invest igator for any other reason.
Important m edical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they  
may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervent ion to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definit ion.
I3Y-MC-JPBJ Statistical Analysis Plan Version 2 Page 14
LY2835219To assess the relat ionship of the AE to the study  drug, the fo llowing termino logies are defined 
(in Protocol Section 8.1.2):
Related:  a direct cause and effect relat ionship between the study  treatment and 
the AE is likely.
Possibly related :  a cause and effect relat ionship between the study  treatment and 
the AE has n ot been dem onstrated at this time and is not probable, but is also not 
impossible.
Unrelated:  without questi on, the AE i s definitely not associ ated with the study  
treatment.
As per Lilly’s standard operating procedures all “related” and “possibly related” AEs and SAEs 
will be defined as related to study  drug.
The following AE list ings and summaries will be produced:
List of pre -existing condit ions and AEs,
List of SAEs,
Summary  of all pre-existing condit ions,
Summary  of all TEAEs,
Summary  of related TEAE s,
Summary  of all SAEs,
Summary  of related SAEs .
6.10.4.Deaths
All deaths on study  will be listed al ong with the reason for death, if known. A summary  of 
deaths will also be produced.
6.10.5.Clinical Laboratory Evaluation
Laboratory  data will be listed for all patients on therapy . Abnormal results will be listed 
separately  for all patients on therapy . In addition to the Invest igator reported AEs, all relevant 
hematology and chemistry  laboratory  values will be graded accor ding to CTCAE v4.0. These 
calculated grades will be included on the list ing and summarized by maximum post -baseline 
grade over the entire study . 
6.10.6.Vital Signs and Other Physical Findings
Temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, respirat ion rate, wei ght andECOG performance status 
will be listed and summarized for all patients on therapy .
6.10.7.Electrocardiograms
All electrocardiogram ( ECG) data will be listed.  
I3Y-MC-JPBJ Statistical Analysis Plan Version 2 Page 15
LY28352196.10.8.Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (Part D Only)
Left ventricular ej ection fraction (LVEF)results andchange fro m baseline values will be listed.  
Change from baseline will also be summarized by cy cle.  Per protocol , LVEF can be assessed 
using either echocardiogram ( ECHO)or multi-gated acqui sition (MUGA)scans provided the 
assessment m odality is consiste nt across all assessments. Thus, change fro m baseline will only 
be calculated and reported for assessment time points where the method of assessment (ECHO or 
MUGA) i s consistent with the method used at baseline.
6.10.9.Ophthalmic Exams (Part D Only)
All ophthalm ic exam data will be listed.
6.11.Protocol Violations
Protocol violationsthat can be derived from the data and are related toinclusion/exclusion 
criteria ortreatmentwill be listed.  These vio lations will include those defined by:
Inclusion/Exclusio n Criteria
oDiagnosis
oAge
oBaseline hematol ogic, hepatic, and renal labs
oPerformance Status
oBaseline QTC interval
Treatment
oInitial dosing
oDose delays
oDose reductions
6.12.Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring 
Since this is a dose -finding study, data will be reviewed on a cohort-by-cohort basis during the
study, until the MTDs are determined for each combinat ion therapy. The purpose of these
cohort-by-cohortreviews is to evaluate the safet y data at each dose level and determine if a DLT
has been observed that would sugge st MTD for each co mbination therapy has been met 
orexceeded. The invest igators and the Lilly study team will make the determinat ion regarding 
dose escalat ion based upon their review o f the safety and tolerability data as described in this
protocol.
Duringthe dose-confirmation portion of each study  part, interim  analyses may be conducted to 
review available safet y, PK, PD, and efficacy data once enro llment to that particular part (A, 
B,C, D, or E ) has completed and all pat ients in that part have either co mpleted 2 cy cles of 
therapy or discontinued from the treatment.
I3Y-MC-JPBJ Statistical Analysis Plan Version 2 Page 16
LY28352196.13.Development Safety Update Report Analyses
The following reports will be produced for the Development Safet y Update Report (DSUR):
Summary  of patient demographics by age and gender
Summary  of patient demographics by racial groups
Summary  ofcumulative patientexposureinformation
Listing of patients who discontinued study treatment d ue to AEs
Listing of patients who discontinued study treatment d ue to death, with the except ion of 
those patients who discont inued due to study disease.
6.14.Clinical Trial Registry Analyses
Additional analyses will be performed for the purpose of fulfilling the Clinical Trial Registry  
(CTR)requirements.   
Analyses provided for the CTR requirements include the fo llowing:
Summary  of AEs, provided as a dataset which will be converted to an XML file .Both SAEs
and ‘Other’ AEsare summarized by treatment group andPT.
An AEis considered ‘Serious’ whether or not it is a TEAE.
An AEis considered in the ‘Other’ category if it is both a TEAE and is not serious.  For 
each SAE and ‘Other’ AE, for each term and treatment group, the fo llowing are provi ded:
othe number of participants at risk of an event
othe number of participants who exper ienced each event te rm
othe number of events experienced.
Consistent with www.ClinicalTrials.gov requirements, ‘Other’ AEs that occur in fewer 
than 5% of patients /subjects in every treatment group may not be included if a 5% 
threshold is chosen (5% is the m inimum thresho ld).
Adverse event reporting is consistent with other document disclo sures for example, the 
clinical study  report (CSR), manuscripts, and so forth. 
A participant flow will be created that will describe how many enro lled patients completed 
the study, and for those who did not, the frequency of each reason for not complet ing.  This 
analysis will be based on study  discontinuati on, not treatm ent discontinuation.  A patient will 
be identifiedas having com pleted the study  on the study  discontinuation eCRF only after 
completing the fo llow up visit.

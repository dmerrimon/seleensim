2. Objectives  
Goal:  Determine the value of PneumoniaCheck specimens for diagnosing SARS -CoV-2 infection and 
assessing disease state and understanding pathogenesis of disease.  
 
Aim 1: Determine the sensitivity and specificity of detecting SARS- CoV-2 RNA in cough -generated 
droplets captured with the PneumoCheck ™ 
 
Aim 2: Determine the value of detecting inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and other biomarkers 
in cough -generated droplets with PneumoniaCheck in evaluating disease in COVID -19 patients.  
 
3. Background  
A novel coronavirus (SARS -CoV-2) was detected in association with cases of severe respiratory illness 
and pneumonia (COVID -19) in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019(1). The virus  
 Detection of SARS -CoV-2 RNA and Biomarkers in Coughed Droplets from  
Patients with COVID -19 and Controls  
Page 4 of 12  Protocol Version: v3.10SEP2021   
 subsequently spread widely throughout China and globally. As of June 2 2020, over 6,000,000 cases and 
375,000 deaths have been reported globally and over 1,700,000 cases and 100,000 deaths in the United States(2). Addressing this unprecedented global pande mic is requiring all available tools to diagnose 
infection, manage ill patients, understand disease pathogenesis and virus transmission to guide efforts 
to decrease transmission and rapidly develop anti -viral drugs and vaccines. We propose to use the 
Pneum oniaCheck ™, a device developed collaboratively by investigators at Georgia Institute of 
Technology (GA Tech) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to help address these 
issues. This device, non -invasively, captures coughed droplets onto  a filter with minimal contamination 
from upper airway secretions(3, 4). In preliminary studies in cystic fibrosis, mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) patients and control patients, we detected bacterial DNA by PCR, inflammatory cytokines and 
chemokines by mu ltiplex Luminex assays, surfactant by enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and amylase by 
enzymatic assay. These data show that this device can provide high quality specimens from the lung 
with minimal risk to the patient and healthcare provider and much lower risk t han invasive procedures 
such as bronchioloalveolar lavage. In addition, with this device, we can acquire specimens from patients who do not have a productive cough (dry cough), a commonly reported symptom for COVID -19, and 
specimens with minimal upper resp iratory contamination unlike a sputum specimen. Thus, this device 
can provide lung secretion specimens to improve detection of SARS -CoV-2 RNA (lung specimens are 
better for detecting virus than upper respiratory tract specimens) and detect inflammatory and  other 
biomarkers  to explore pathogenesis  of disease,  identify  inflammatory  processes that might  be amenable 
to intervention, and identify biomarkers of disease severity for patient management and evaluation of vaccines and anti -viral drugs. We propose to determine how PneumoniaCheck ™ can help diagnose, 
manage, and understand pathogenesis of disease and transmission risk of  COVID -19. 
 
The PneumoniaCheck uses fluid mechanics to preferentially eliminate upper respiratory contaminants while capturing cough -generated droplets from the lung onto a filter. The device, illustrated in Figure 1, 
is designed to prevent upper respiratory tract fluids from entering the device, to direct residual upper airway (dead space) that may contain upper respiratory tract contamin ants to a balloon, and to direct 
coughed air from the lung through a filter. Once the balloon is filled with dead space air, air from the lung is diverted through the filter and the droplets captured onto the filter. DNA or RNA from bacteria, viruses, etc., or proteins and other molecules present in these droplets can be detected by real time  PCR 
for DNA or RNA or by enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for cytokines, chemokines, or other molecules. The ability to detect SARS -CoV-2 RNA and biomarkers indicative of in flammation and active disease should 
help  physicians  manage  COVID -19 patients  and researchers  understand  the disease  process  and possibly 
transmission risk. This study will develop data on detection of SARS -CoV-2 RNA and lung biomarkers 
with this device in  COVID -19 patients.

4. Study  Endpoints  
Aim 1. Determine the sensitivity and specificity of detecting SARS -CoV-2 RNA in cough -generated  
droplets captured with the  PneumoCheck ™. We have captured real time PCR detectable bacterial DNA 
from the lung with PneumoCheck ™ in the lung of adults with cystic fibrosis at a rate similar to that 
reported for detecting bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) specimens by culture(3). Since 
high levels of SARS -CoV-2 RNA can be detected in sputum specimens, the coughed specimens are a 
promising specimen to detect SARS -CoV-2 RNA for diagnosis, monitoring course of disease, and possibly 
indicating risk of transmitting virus to others.  
 
Aim 2. Determine the value of detecting inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and other biomarkers  
in cough -generated droplets with PneumoniaCheck  in evaluating disease in COVID -19 patients. We 
previously demonstrated that with PneumoniaCheck that we can detect inflammatory biomarkers in 
patients with acute respiratory illness as illustrated in Figure 2 . Using the amylase to indicate upper 
respirato ry origin and surfactant A to indicate lower respiratory tract origin, we demonstrate that 
PneumoniaCheck specimens come primarily from the lower respiratory tract ( Table ). We now propose 
to detect biomarkers of inflammation in coughed specimens from patie nt with COVID -19. We 
hypothesize that biomarkers of inflammation from the lung will indicate disease activity, inform 
pathogenesis of COVID -19 disease.

Figure 2.  Cytokines and chemokines in PneumoniaCheck specimens. PneumoniaCheck  specimens were collected 
in 4 subjects without respiratory symptoms (Panel 2.A) and 3 subjects (Panel 2.B) with respiratory symptoms. The 
PneumoniaCheck specimen was collected with 5 different collections of 10 coughs with each collection separated 
by > 1  hour. The device was stored at -80oC until processing. The specimen was eluted from the filter and tested by 
multiplex Luminex assay for cytokines and chemokines. Note  the marked difference in level of cytokines and 
chemokines detected in patients with re spiratory symptoms compared to those  without.

 Table 1. Pathogen detection and specimen 
quality determination. PneumoniaCheck 
specimens were collected in 9 CF patients and 2 non -CF control patients by 5 different 
collections of 10 coughs with each collection separated by > 1 hour. The device was stored 
at -80
oC until processing. The specimen was  
eluted from the filter and tested for Staphylococcus aureus (Staph A), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pseud A), and 
Streptococcus pneumoniae (Strep Pn) DNA by PCR, surfactant A (Surf A) by EIA, and amylase (Amyl) by an 
enzymatic assay. Neg = negative by PCR. Values are PCR CT values except for Amyl/SurfA which is the ratio of Amylase concentration over surfactant A concentration. Note  the much higher Amyl/SurfA ratio for the sputum 
compare to PneumoniaCheck specimens ind icating much lower or negligible levels of upper respiratory tract 
secretions in the specimen.  
 
5. Study Intervention/Investigational  Agent  
Description:  The PneumoniaCheck is a device uses fluid mechanics to preferentially eliminate 
upper respiratory contamin ants while capturing cough -generated droplets from the lung onto a 
filter. The device, illustrated in Figure 1 above.  
Device  Handling : The patient  will be given  the PneumoniaCheck  device  with  a sterile  ziplock  bag 
and cooler  with  cold  packs  to keep  the device,  shown  a video,  given  verbal  guidance  for collecting 
the first set of coughed specimens, and asked to do 4 additional sets of 10 coughs into the same 
device. The device will be stored in the ziplock bag in the cooler between  collections.  
6. Procedures  Involved:  
Patients seen at Emory COVID -19 testing centers will be asked to participate in the study. Those who 
consent  to participate  will have  a cough  specimen  collected  over  the following  24 hours  and their  medical 
record will be reviewed for age, sex, race/ethnicity, underlying medical conditions, their SARS -CoV-2 PCR 
test results, and other diagnostic test results if being seen for a COVID exposure or illness or other acute respiratory illness. The patient will be given the PneumoniaCheck device with a sterile ziplock bag and cooler  with  cold  packs  to keep  the device,  shown  a video,  given  verbal  guidance  for collecting  the first set 
of coughed specimens, and asked to do 4 additional sets of 10 coughs into th e same device. The device 
will be stored in the ziplock bag in a cooler between collections. After the specimen is collected, the specimen will be collected by study personnel and transported using standard operating procedures for specimen transportation to the laboratory. In the laboratory, in a BSL2 biosafety cabinet with BSL2+ conditions, the PneumoniaCheck will be double bagged for storage at - 80
oC. Later the specimen is 
processed  and tested  for SARS- CoV-2 RNA  by real time  PCR and biomarkers  by a multi plex Luminex  assay 
and mass spectrometry. Each specimen will be given an identification number, without personal identifying  information,  which  will be used  to link laboratory  results  to clinical and epidemiologic  data.  
 
 
 
Specimen Processing  
In the laboratory, in a BSL2 biosafety cabinet, with BSL2+ conditions, the PneumoniaCheck will be processed according to Biosafety approved processes.  
 
For processing, the filter is removed from the device (see Figure 1 for location of the filter) and capt ured 
coughed droplets eluted from the filter as described in Attachment 1. The 300ul of specimen containing elution buffer will be divided in 3 aliquots (RNAZol will be added to one aliquot) for storage at - 80
oC until  PneuCk 7  neg 30.08  neg 517.6

 testing. The Spin -X colu mn and filter will also be stored at - 80oC. The vials will be sprayed with 70% 
alcohol to inactivate any contaminating virus before storage.  
 
Specimen testing . The RNAZol containing specimen will be tested with the CDC SARS -CoV-2 N1 and N2 
primers accordin g to the CDC online protocol. One of the other aliquots will be thawed and tested by 
multiplex Luminex or Simoa Quanterix system assays for cytokines and chemokines (e.g., the 
Inflammation 20 -Plex Human ProcartaPlex ™ Panel , Invitrogen ™, Waltham, MA, USA) and enzyme 
immune assay for surfactant A (Human surfactant Protein A ELISA Kit, Abbexa Ltd UK) according to the 
manu facturer’s instructions. The specimens will also be tested for amylase by an enzymatic assay 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Before biomarker testing, SARS -CoV-2 will be inactivated 
with an Environmental, Health and Safety Office approved met hod (e.g., heat -inactivation at 56oC for 30 
min. protocol) and for novel biomarkers by mass spectrometry.  
 
7. Data and Specimen Banking  
Data will be analyzed based on specimen identification number and group (e.g., COVID -19 patient, non - 
COVID -19 acute  respiratory  illness  patient,  control).  Participants  will be consented  for future  contact  and 
use of data and/or specimens. At the completion of this study, we will store any remaining samples for possible  future  use. The remaining  samples  may  be stored  indefinitely  and may  be used  for future  studies 
of genetic  causes  of the disease.  The samples  will be stored  at Emory  Children’s  Center  and Emory  Labs.  
The sample will be given a unique identification number and stored without participant name or other identifiers. Only the investigator will have a list to know which sample is linked to which 
patient and this list will be kept confidential in a secure location. If the investigator distributes these samples for research into the causes of the disease, it will be released with the unique identifier, but without any names or medical record numbers.  
8. Sharing of Results with  Participants  
In general, we will not give any individual results from the study of the samples. If we find something of urgent medical importance, we will inform the participant or the participant’s primary care physician, 
although we expect that this will be a very rare occurrence.  
 
9. Study  Timelines  
Patients who consent to participate in the study will be instructed on method of c ollection and asked to 
collect 5 sets of 10 cough specimens over the next 24 hours with the same PneumoniaCheck device. In some cases, participants may be asked to collect additional samples at a later time period.  
 
10. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
We will  to enroll up to 75 adult SARS -CoV-2 PCR positive patients and up to 30 adult patients with a non - 
COVID -19 acute respiratory illness being treated either as inpatients or outpatients to participate in the 
study. We will also enroll up to 30 adult healthy controls. We will collect coughed specimens during 5 sessions of 10 or more coughs separated by at least 15 minutes . Patients who consent to participate in 
the study will be instructed on method of collection and asked to collect 5 sets of 10 cough specime ns 
over the next 24 hours with the same PneumoniaCheck device. After specimen collection is completed, the device is transferred to the laboratory and stored for processing. For processing, the filter (see Figure 1 ) with the captured coughed droplets is re moved from the device, captured droplets eluted 
from the filter, and the eluate and filter are stored at - 80
oC for later testing, PCR for SARS -CoV-2 RNA, 
multiplex Luminex and Simoa Quanterix system assays for biomarkers of inflammation, enzyme immunoassay  (EIA)  for surfactant  A, and an enzymatic  assay  for amylase.  The PCR results,  positivity  and 
CT values,  in 
 Detection of SARS -CoV-2 RNA and Biomarkers in Coughed Droplets from  
Patients with COVID -19 and Controls  
Page 8 of 12  Protocol Version: v3.10SEP2021   
 COVID -19 patients will indicate the sensitivity of this specimen for detecting SARS -CoV-2 RNA and in 
non-COVID -19 patients and controls the specificity. The ratio of surfactant A to amylase indicate lung 
and upper respiratory contributions to the specimen for all groups. The multiplex Luminex and Simoa 
Quanterix system data will give biomarkers of inflammation for each group and differences between 
groups biomarkers associated with COVID -19. We will also test some specimens with mass 
spectrometry to identif y novel biomarkers associated with COVID -19 lung disease.  
 
11. Vulnerable  Populations  
The population group for this study is adults age 18 and up. The study will initially be inclusive 
to English as a primary spoken language. At a later point, inclusion to other primary languages will be considered with available resources to that population group.  
 
12. Local Number of  Participants  
Up to 90 total participants will be accrued locally; taking into consideration those that consent but are not able are to provide speci mens. Those that consent and are unable 
to provide specimens will be considered screen failures and not counted toward overall enrollment.  
13. Recruitment  Methods  
Once the ECC -VRC staff learn of a potential participant, they may contact the patient’s 
physician to determine whether the patient is suitable for participation in a research study. The study staff may contact the potential participant and the LAR to determine their interest in participating in the study. The staff may learn of potential part icipants either by reviewing test 
results in the medical records (for example, a positive diagnostic test) or from physician colleagues.  
 
In the case of hospitalized patients, the patients’ physician must be willing to act as the liaison between the patien t, the patient’s LAR and the research team. For outpatients, the primary 
physician may be asked to serve as the contact person for the patient. If the patient is ambulatory and has recovered from the illness, such patients may be asked to visit the ECC -VRC 
if they are interested in participating in the study. There will be no monetary incentive for the patient’s physicians to refer patients to this study.  
 
In the case of healthy volunteers, ECC staff will utilize the adult participant database for those who  agreed to be contacted for future studies.  
 
Research staff will utilize the Emory IRB approved Oral Consent form to prescreen interested participants. If the subject/LAR provides oral consent, the research staff will proceed with a prescreening telephone questionnaire to exchange relevant study information with the subject. Research staff will collect the participant’s name, phone number, email, age, COVID history, respiratory history and medical history and offer time for questions and study information. If the subject/LAR is interested in participation, the first clinic visit will be made 
at which time full written consent or full oral consent (as stated in the consent section of this document) will be obtained prior to the initiation of any research acti vities.  
 
14. Withdrawal of  Participants  
 Detection of SARS -CoV-2 RNA and Biomarkers in Coughed Droplets from  
Patients with COVID -19 and Controls  
Page 9 of 12  Protocol Version: v3 10SEP2021   
 Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time by contacting the principle investigator. 
Subjects may also be withdrawn from the study at the investigators’ discretion, for example if the investigator thi nks this may affect the subjects’ wellbeing. If a subject withdraws, no further 
data will be collected. If data has been collected, it will not be destroyed.  
 
15. Risks to  Participants  
The most common risks and discomforts expected in this study are:  
• Participants may feel a slight discomfort from coughing repeatedly into the  device. 
The less common risks and discomforts expected are: 
• Loss of confidentiality, all necessary precautions will be in place to reduce breach  of 
confidentiality.  
 
16. Potential Benefits to  Participants  
Taking part in this research study will not benefit participants personally but the research may help learn new things that may help others in the future.  
 
17. Data Management and  Confidentiality  
Data Analysis . Data will be analyzed based on specimen identification number and group (e.g., 
COVID -19 patient, non -COVID -19 acute respiratory illness patient, control).  
 
The quality of the specimen captured on the filter, i.e. from the lung or upper respiratory or both will be indica ted by surfactant A (lung) and amylase (upper respiratory).  
 
The PCR results will be analyzed as positive or negative and by CT value. The PCR results in COVID -19 patients will indicate the sensitivity of this specimen for detecting SARS -CoV- 2 RNA 
and PCR results in non- COVID -19 patients and controls the specificity. The ratio of surfactant A 
to amylase indicate lung and upper respiratory contributions to the specimen for all groups.  
The multiplex Luminex data or Simoa Quanterix system will give biomarkers of inflammation for each group. We will also test some specimens with mass spectrometry to identify novel biomarkers associated with COVID -19 lung disease. Specimens will be saved for additional 
future research testing.

18. Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of  Participants  
There is no product being administered in this study. The study is no  more than minimal risk, so 
there is not a specific Data Monitoring and Participant Safety plan.  
 
19. Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of  Participants  
The privacy of the participants health information is important. As part of this study, we will be 
consenting the participants prior to the conduct of any research activities . During this process, health care entities who are covered by the Health Insuran ce Portability and Accountability Act and 
regulations (HIPAA) will be identified. The participant will be informed that the researchers who obtain 
IIHI (“individually identifiable health information” or “IIHI”) from the health care entities are not 
covered  by HIPAA. Once they receive the IIHI from the health care entities, they will put it in a separate 
research record that is not a part of the medical record and that IIHI placed in the separate research record is not be covered by HIPAA.  
We will also infor m them of their ability to provide research staff consent to access their IIHI for the 
purpose or research. Data and specimen collection will not be linked to individual participants for privacy interest as described in section 7.  
Participants are informed  that they do not have to sign the consent form. If they do not sign this 
consent form, then they may not participate in the research study.  
20. Economic Burden to Participants  
There will be no cost to participants for participating in the study, other than ba sic expenses like 
transportation. Participants will not be charged for any of the research activities . 
 
21. Consent  Process  
Once a potential participant is identified and confirms interest in the study, the study staff will initiate the informed consent proces s. The consent process may be initiated by the research team through a 
prescreening process utilizing an oral consent and phone screen document as described in the recruitment section of this document. In cases where the consent process begins in person, t he study 
coordinator will discuss the study with a potential participant or LAR in a private room within the 
hospital/clinic. The subject may be referred by a healthcare provider or may request information 
independent of a provider’s referral about the cou gh droplet specimen collection COVID 19 study and 
the purpose of the study will be shared. The subject will be given ample time to review the consent and 
ask questions. The consent will be signed in the presence of the coordinator. A signed copy will be gi ven 
to the participant/LAR. The participant/LAR will have the option to retain consent, discuss with family members, and sign the consent at a future date in the presence of a member of the study staff. In the 
case of a hospitalized participant, a copy of the consent will be made for the medical record.

Patients with COVID -19 and Controls  
Page 11 of 12  Protocol Version: v3 10SEP2021  
  
 In some scenarios, informed consent will be obtained verbally without signature through a waiver of 
documentation. This would be done in situations where it is important to minimize in -person exposure 
time to protect study staff and reduce risk of disease transmission in general or the potential 
participant’s LAR is not allowed to visit them (the potential participant) per containment policies. In this 
situation, hospital staff will provide the consent, or an emailed copy of the consent form will be made 
avail able to the participant/LAR from contact information provided by the hospital staff. The research 
staff will contact the individual by phone and proceed with the informed consent process. An informed consent progress note will be used to source document th e consent process, date, name of research 
staff conducting the process, and relationship to participant. The consent process will be the same as 
written consent (as described above) the only element missing will be the written signature, as the 
process is oral and not in person, from the participant/LAR.  
In the case of the adult SARS -CoV-2 PCR positive patients or the adult patients with a non - 
COVID -19 acute respiratory illness being treated as either inpatients or outpatients, the ability 
to consent will be made in conjunction with the study team and the advice of the primary care physician. For all cohorts, the appropriate time will be allowed for consenting, including questions and answers, as well as steps to reduce the risk of coercion or undue influen ce. 
Within the consent process, participants will be able to indicate optional consent for participation in future studies and genetic testing of samples. Currently there are no plans for genetic testing.  
Non -English -Speaking Participants  
At this time due to resource restraints we will not be seeking non -English speaking 
participants, however will seek amendment if this becomes available.  
Participants who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers)  
At this time, our target population will be adults ages 18 and up.  
Cognitively Impaired Adults  
Prior to and during the consenting process steps will be made to assure that consent is 
being received by cognitively intact participants and/or the LAR.  
Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process (consent will not be obtained, required information will not be disclosed, or the research involves deception)  
A partial HIPAA waiver for identification and recruitment may be utilized. Additionally, a waiver of written signature for cases where as described above in section 10 when oral consent will be obtained in lieu of written consent.  
 
22. Setting  
The research wil l be done at Emory Healthcare facilities either as an inpatient or 
outpatient, and Emory Children’s Center for Healthy Volunteers and follow up visits.  
23. Resources  Available  
• The research group at ECC has its own recruitment staff and utilizes research databases to 
satisfy recruitment  goals.  
• This research will be ongoing until the goals for recruitment have been  satisfied.  
• We are a research facility in which all staff members have been adequately trained on the protocol and appropriate training credentials are  on record.

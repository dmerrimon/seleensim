Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical tr ial (RCT) using a cross-over (repeated measures) 
design to evaluate safety and efficacy. The study will be conducted at multiple sites in an 
outpatient setting.    
 Each subject will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. The treatments and 
treatment schedule are detailed in the table below:  
 
 Treatment Group 1 Treatment Group 2 Treatment Group 3 Treatment Group 4 
Week 1 Tr. B Tr. A Tr. C Tr. A 
Week 2 Tr. B Tr. A Tr. C Tr. A 
Week 3 Tr. A  Tr. B Tr. A Tr. C 
Week 4 Tr. A  Tr. B Tr. A Tr. C 
 
*A=Study Product, B=Comparator Product 1, C=Comparator Product 2 
 
Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled to hav e 32 subjects for the evaluation. There will be 
two subject groups: those with VLU and those with DFU. Approximately 50% of the subjects will be in the VLU group and 50% of the subjects in the DFU group. Treatment sequence will be 
randomized so that a fair distribution is achieved. The total duration of the study will be 
approximately 4 weeks or 28 ± 2 days. 
 
Visit Schedule 
Potential study subjects will be screened for eligibility. Inclusion and exclusion criteria, vital 
signs, medical record reviews, subject demographics and informed consent will be performed 
and obtained at the Screening Visit (Day 0). If the pat ient meets the eligibility criteria, he or she 
will be enrolled and randomized into one of four tr eatment groups. The test wound dressing will 
be applied on the screening day (Day-0) and evaluations will take place twice weekly 
throughout the 4-week Treatment Period. The dressing will only be changed at Day 7 of each 
treatment week (e.g. Visit Days 7, 14, 21 and 28) or as needed at the discretion of the study 
doctor or investigator. There will be a total of 8 visits to the Vascular and Wound Care Center 
during the Treatment Period.  During those visi ts, evaluations will be performed to assess the 
condition of the wound dressing, the wound, wound pain and patient comfort.   
All study evaluations will be performed by a study doctor or nurse during the follow-up visit at 
the Vascular and Wound Care Center. 
All subjects in the VLU group will receive the same compression therapy and all subjects in the 
DFU group will receive the same off-loading footwear throughout the entire study period.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The impact of living with a wound is multifac torial and chronic wounds are associated with a 
range of morbidities; these wounds and their associated complications can have a significant effect upon a patient’s quality of life (QoL) (1, 2). Ineffective wound assessment and management can exacerbate this negative impa ct upon the patient (3). Wound management 
strategies should be optimized not only to effectively manage the wound, but also to avoid 
further wound complications. Frequently reported pati ent issues associated with chronic wounds 
include discomfort, pain, malodor, leakage and restriction to daily activities (2). 
Whilst dressings are an essential part of wound management, dressing-associated 
complications can hinder wound healing progression and cause unnecessary distress to the patient. Potential disturbances to the wound can occur as a result of suboptimal dressing 
choice. There are many potential ways in which a wound dressing, in close contact with the 
wound bed and surrounding skin, can damage or dist urb the wound. These include: sub-optimal 
moisture balance, adherence, mechanical stress, presence of foreign bodies, sub-optimal 
temperature, chemical imbalance, and chemical stress  (4). Of particular focus in the literature in 
recent years is the trauma and pain that wound dressing may cause, with the repeated 
application and removal of dressings that adhere to the wound bed causing trauma and 
epidermal stripping (5). Frequent application and removal of wound dressings can cause 
damage to the fragile wound or surrounding skin; th is can cause considerable suffering for the 
patient (4). Ultimately, this trauma to the wound can lead to an increase in wound size, exacerbated pain and delay healing (5). 
Pain is an important issue for clinicians to  consider when managing chronic wounds. Wound 
pain can occur from many sources, with w ound management procedures (including dressing 
changes) contributing to this pain (5). When co mpared to dressings with traditional adhesives, 
the use of wound dressings incorporating soft silicone can minimize traumatic injuries to the wound/peri-wound skin, as well as minimizing dressing-associated pain (6-8). Research has 
demonstrated the potential of these atraumatic  wound dressings in overcoming these issues. 
Whilst optimal dressing choice is important in achieving good healing progression, it is also 
important to minimize the frequency of dressi ng changes to enable healing to occur undisturbed 
(9). Frequent removal and reapplication of wound dressings may delay wound healing through mechanical disturbance to the healing process, temperature loss at the wound site (affecting the 
cellular healing process) and potential increase in the ingress of harmful bacteria to the wound site (9). Wound healing may be further hindered as a result of psychological stress and pain during dressing changes (9). 
A dressing’s ability to absorb and retain wound exudate is a key influential factor in terms of 
dressing wear time (9). Whilst exudate production is a part of the normal wound healing 
trajectory and an essential component to healing, when excessive exudate is not managed 
effectively it can have a negative impact on the patient (3). Wound exudate is associated with

several complications. These include: leakage, maceration, pain and discomfort, malodor, and 
psychological and psychosocial implications, al l of which can impede patient QoL (3, 10-13). 
Chronic wounds may produce high levels of exudate as a result of a prolonged inflammatory 
response. Both diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and venous leg ulcers (VLUs) are often associated 
with high levels of wound exudate (14-16). 
In terms of exudate management, the ideal wound dressing has several key functions: to 
optimally handle fluid (absorption and retention of exudate and its components, even under 
pressure); to reduce the risk of leakage; to reduce the spread of exudate onto the peri-wound area (thus reducing the risk of maceration); and to act as a bacterial barrier. The dressing should also ensure conformability, provide patient comfort, be easy to use, provide optimal dressing change frequency, minimize wound disturbance, and should be cost-effective (14). Previous research has demonstrated the ability of a layered foam dressing with siliconized 
adhesive to effectively manage wound exudate in exuding wounds, whilst maintaining a moist 
wound healing environment (6, 8, 17, 18). The adhesion of the dressing to the wound or 
surrounding skin is a further contributory factor th at affects dressing wear time. The ability of the 
dressing to conform to body contours helps to ensure dressing adhesion (9).  
Extended dressing wear may add value not only to the patient, but also to the health care 
provider. Frequent dressing changes are a huge cost driver and can impact greatly on 
resources (9). Minimizing the number of dre ssing changes (depending on the condition of the 
wound), may help to minimize unnecessary distur bance to the wound, minimize pain and stress 
for the patient, limit exposure of the wound to contamination and help to limit wound care costs 
(associated with nursing time, materials, pain medication, and medication for dressing-related 
trauma). 
The aim of this clinical investigation is to eval uate and compare three different foam dressings in 
the local management of chronic wounds (i.e. VLUs and DFUs) in an outpatient setting. 
Mepilex® Border Flex will be evaluated ve rsus Optifoam (Medline) and Allevyn Life 
(Smith&Nephew) within three focus areas; efficacy and safety of the dressings, subject-centric 
outcomes and health economic evaluation.  
2. OBJECTIVES 
Primary Objective 
To demonstrate superiority in efficacy of Mepilex® Border Flex versus Optifoam Gentle EX 
and Allevyn Life in the management of venous l eg ulcers (VLUs) and diabetic foot ulcers 
(DFUs) in an outpatient setting, as determi ned by dressing durability (i.e. wear time). 
 Secondary Objectives 
• To compare clinical wound characteristics during wound management with each of the 
test dressings (in combination with standard care), including the rate of wound healing, 
peri-wound skin condition, and local pain levels.

4.1 Overall Design and Flow Chart 
Study Design   
 
Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial (RCT) using a 2x2 cross-over (repeated measures) design to evaluate safety and efficacy. The study will be conducted in an outpatient setting of an academic clinical center.     Each subject will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. The treatments and 
treatment schedule are detailed in the table below:  
 
Table 1. Treatment Groups

Week 4 Tr. A  Tr. B Tr. A Tr. C 
 
*A=Study Product, B=Comparator Product 1, C=Comparator Product 2 
 
Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled to have  32 subjects for the evaluation. Approximately 
50% of the subjects will be in the VLU group and 50% of the subjects in the DFU group. 
Treatment sequence will be randomized so that a fair  distribution is achieved. The total duration 
of the study will be approximately 4 weeks or 28 ± 2 days. 
Visit Schedule 
Potential study subjects will be screened for eligibility. Inclusion and exclusion criteria, vital 
signs, medical record reviews, subject demographics and informed consent will be performed and obtained at the Screening Visit (Day 0). If the pat ient meets the study eligibility criteria, he 
or she will be asked to sign consent.  Study subjects will be randomized into one of four 
treatment groups. The test wound dressing will be applied at screening (Day-0) and evaluations 
will take place twice weekly throughout the Treatment Period. The scheduled dressing change 
will be on Day 7 of each treatment week (e.g. Visit Days 7, 14, 21 and 28), unless a dressing 
change is necessary because of strikethrough loss  of adherence or discomfort. There will be a 
total of 8 visits to the Wound Care Center duri ng the Treatment Period.  During those visits, 
evaluations will be performed to assess the condition of the wound dressing, the wound, wound pain and patient comfort.

All study evaluations will be performed by a study doctor or nurse during the follow-up visit at 
the Wound Care Center. 
 All subjects in the VLU group will receive the same compression therapy and all subjects in the DFU group will receive the same off-loading footwear throughout the entire study period.      
 
Study Methods 
 
 Wound dressings will be evaluated twice weekly by the study doctor or study nurse. All 
other evaluations will be performed once weekly before dressing change.     
 There may be an initial debridement (at the inve stigator’s discretion prior to enrollment).  
  Additional debridement is not allowed.   
 Wound dressing wear time and durability will be determined by study doctors’ judgement 
and by photography. 
 Exudate absorption and exudate dispersion will be determined clinically and by 
photodigital planimetry.  
 Wound surface area will be measured serially  using photo-digital planimetric software.  
 Wound and surrounding skin characteristics will be evaluated by the study doctor at 
dressing change. 
 Dressing comfort and subject-centric outcomes  will be captured at the end of weeks 2 
and 4. 
 SF12 will be captured at the initial visit and then bi-weekly 
 Local wound pain will be evaluated usi ng the Baker-Wong (Faces) Scale before and 
after each dressing change.

4.3.4 Withdrawal of Subjects from Treatment or Assessment  
A subject may be discontinued from the study at any time if the subject, the Investigator, or the 
Sponsor feels that it is not in the subject’s best in terest to continue.  The following is a list of 
possible reasons for study treatment discontinuation:  
• Screen failure 
• Subject withdrawal of consent  
• Subject is not compliant with study procedures 
• AE that in the opinion of the Investigator would be in the best interest of the subject to 
discontinue study participation 
• Protocol violation requiring discontinuation  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Sponsor request for early termination of study 
• Subject death 
All subjects are free to withdraw from participa tion at any time, for any reason, specified or 
unspecified, and without prejudice. Reasonable attempts will be made by the Investigator to 
provide a reason for subject withdrawals. The reas on for the subject’s withdrawal from the study 
will be specified in the subject’s source documents and the Case Report Form (CRF).   
If a subject is withdrawn from treatment due to an AE, the subject will be followed and treated by 
the Investigator until the abnormal parameter or symptom has resolved or stabilized. 
The Investigator must make every effort to contac t subjects who are lost to follow-up.  Three (3) 
attempted telephone contacts should be documented by key research personnel in order to 
consider the participant lost to follow-up. Furt hermore, a certified letter will be mailed to the 
participant’s address. If the participant does not respond, the certified letter receipt should be 
filed in the individual’s research record with a copy of the letter sent. Attempts to contact such 
subjects must be documented in the patients’ records (e.g., times and dates of attempted 
telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter, etc.). 
 
Handling of Participant Withdrawals or Termination 
Although subjects may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason, (or may be 
withdrawn at the Investigator’s discretion), s ubject withdrawal should be avoided as much as 
reasonably possible.  In any case, appropriate follow-up for endpoints should be continued.  
The reason for study discontinuation will be re corded on the subject’s source document and 
CRF. 
Subjects who prematurely discontinue are not to be  replaced.  For subjects considered lost to 
follow-up, the CRF must be completed up to the last visit performed.

This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient 
reasonable cause.  Written notification, doc umenting the reason for study suspension or 
termination, will be provided by the suspending or  terminating party to the Investigator, the 
Sponsor and the Institutional Review Board (IRB), as appropriate.  If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Investigator will  promptly inform the IRB and will provide the 
reason(s) for the termination or suspension.  
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  • Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stopping  • Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
• Determination of futility  
Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are 
addressed and satisfy the Sponsor and/or the IRB.

4.6.3 Safety Measurements and Variables 
Adverse Event (AE)/Adverse Device Effect (ADE), Serious Adverse Event (SAE)/Serious 
Adverse Device Effect (SADE), and Device Deficiencies (DD). The definition of AE, ADE, SAE, SADE and DD and procedures for reporting , SAE and SADE and DD that could have led to a 
SADE are presented in section 8 of this CIP. All AE, ADE, SAE, SADE and DD must also be recorded in the appropriate section of the CRF. It is of utmost importance that all staff involved 
in the clinical investigation is familiar with the c ontent of section 8. It is the responsibility of the 
Principal Investigator to ensure this. 
Signs of local infection will be judged by the investigator: 
• Pain and/or trauma since last dressing change 
• Foul odor 
• High levels of exudates 
4.6.4 Anticipated ADEs  
The conclusion of the Product Risk Managemen t Record (PD-518122 rev 05) and the Clinical 
Evaluation Report (PD-511948 rev 3) of Mepilex® Border® is: Mepilex® Border has substantial 
support for both performance and safety given the substantial amount of clinical investigations 
performed on the device, together with the low ri sk and long term performance and safety of the 
device. Before reaching the above conclusion, th e identified risks of the investigational device 
were mitigated to an acceptable level in the risks analysis process (following ISO 14971, 
Application of Risk Management to Medical Devices).  
The following events have been identified as anticipated effects in the Clinical Evaluation Report 
based on the Product Risk Management Record:   
• Pain at dressing removal 
• Trauma to the wound bed or surrounding skin 
• Skin stripping/irritation

• Skin irritation or local allergic reactions 
• Maceration 
• Infection 
All identified risks have been assessed. It is concluded that all applicable risk mitigation actions 
have been performed and verified to be effective. No unacceptable risks remain. Thus, the 
benefit of using the products outweighs the remaining risks. 
The Principal Investigator or designee is respon sible for judging whether the appearance of any 
of the above mentioned events are considered to be AEs or adverse device effects (ADEs). If this is the case, the event must be reported in the applicable section of the electronic Case 
Report Forms (eCRF) according to the timelines and definitions mentioned in section 8. 
Furthermore, worsening of an existing medical hi story during the intervention group may also be 
relevant to report as an AE or ADE and the Principal Investigator or designee is responsible for 
making this judgment.  
Concomitant treatments that are known to potentially affect the performance of the 
investigational device must be registered in the eCRF.  
There are no additional risks to the subjects by participating in this clinical investigation than 
there would be if the subject was treated with the investigational device (or standard care) under non-investigational settings. An additional benefit of participation may be more frequent and/or 
thorough wound assessments as part of this Clinical Investigation Plan. 
 
4.7 Data Qual ity Assurance 
4.7.1 Monitoring, Audits and Inspections 
During the investigation, the monitor will have regular contacts with the investigation site. These 
contacts will include visits to confirm that the facilities remain adequate to specified standards 
and that the investigation site team is carrying out the procedure stated in the Clinical 
Investigation Plan and supports the investigator. All data must be accurately recorded in the 
CRF. Source data verification (a comparison of data in the CRF with the subject’s 
hospital/practice and other records at the investigation site) with direct access to records will 
also be performed. 
The monitor or other Mölnlycke Health Care  personnel will be available between visits if the 
investigator or other staff at the site needs information and/or advice. 
Authorized representatives of Mölnlycke Health Care and/or a Competent Authority (CA) and/or 
the Ethics Committee (EC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB) may visit the investigation site to 
perform audits/inspections, including source data verification.

data from each individual subject for the st atistical analysis must be made and documented 
before locking the database.] 
 
4.8 Statistical Methods and De termination of  Sample Size 
4.8.1 Statistical Evaluation 
Two cross-over studies AB/BA will be performed. In the first one Mepilex® Border Flex will be 
compared with Optifoam and in the second one Mepilex® Border Flex will be compared with 
Allevyn Life. Exactly the same statistical methods will be used in both these cross-over studies. In this statistical section Optifoam and Allevyn Life will be substituted with active control. 
 
Primary efficacy variable, days to strikethrough, and probably all of the other efficacy variables 
are non-normal distributed. Therefor e, non-parametric tests are used. 
 
it is likely the status of the wounds will be bette r in the second period of the cross-over. This 
implies that the statistical analysis must adjust for period effect in the AB/BA crossover study. For primary efficacy variable days to strikethrough , all other continuous outcome variables, all 
ordered categorical variables and all dichotomous va riables the adjustment for period effect will 
be performed in the following way: 
For all subjects the difference in the efficacy variable between Period 2 and Period 1 in the 
cross-over will be calculated.  
These differences will then be compared between subj ects started with Mepilex® Border Flex in 
Period 1 and subjects started with active cont rol in Period 1 with an optimal two-sided two-
sample test. For continuous variables the differences will be analyzed with Fisher’s non-
parametric permutation tests between the two groups and for ordered categorical variables and 
dichotomous variables the differences, number and percentages improved, not changed and worsened, will be analyzed with Mantel-Haenszel Exact Chi-square test.  
The main statistical analysis will be performed on the full analysis set (ITT). Complementary 
statistical analysis will be performed on the Per Protocol (PP) set. 
The Full Analysis Set will include all subjects with at least one measurement of follow up. The 
Per Protocol population will include all subjects that fulfil all inclusion/exclusion criteria and that 
are not described as protocol violators. They should have been followed for the 2x2 weeks 
treatment period. Subjects identified as prot ocol violators will be documented and agreed 
between Mölnlycke Health Care and the Principal Investigator before declaration of clean-file, 
please see Section 4.7 . 
The Safety population include all subjects that have at least one application of the Mepilex® 
Border dressing or at least one of the other study dressings.

The distribution of continuous variables and change in continuous variables will be given as 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum a nd maximum and the distribution of categorical 
and dichotomous variables will be given as numbers and percentages. 
All statistical tests will be two-sided and conducted at the 5% significance level. 
A baseline table will be given for all included subj ects with the distribution of demographics and 
baseline variables. 
 
4.8.2 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
Primary efficacy analysis comparison of days to strikethrough between Mepilex® Border Flex 
and active control will be performed on the full analysis set (FAS) in the following way.  
For subjects randomized to Mepilex® Border Flex in the first period the difference in days to 
strikethrough between period 2 (active control) and period 1 (Mepilex® Border Flex) will be 
compared to subjects randomized to active control in the first period regarding the differences in 
days to strikethrough between period 2 (Mepilex® Border Flex) and period 1 (active control) 
with two-sided Fisher’s non-parametric permutation tests at significance level 0.05. Period 
adjusted mean differences in days to strikethrough between Mepilex® Border Flex and active 
control will be given with 95% confidence interv al based on Fisher’s non-parametric permutation 
tests. 
 
In both cross-over studies, Mepilex® Border Flex compared to Optifoam study and Mepilex® 
Border Flex compared to Allevyn Life, the same above analysis will be the primary analyses. Since there are two separated studies no multiplicity adjustment will be performed. 
4.8.3 Determination of Sample Size 
The expected mean differences in days to strikethrough between the differences Period 1-Period 2 between the two groups Mepilex® Border Flex and active control will be two times the 
difference in the effect Mepilex® Border Flex minus active control. 
We estimate (assume) the SD for the difference in time to strikethrough between Period 2 and 
Period 1 to be 0.65 days both in the group started with Mepilex® Border Flex and in the group 
started with active control.  
In order to find a difference in one half day between days to strikethrough between Mepilex® 
Border Flex and active control with a power of 80% a total of 16 evaluable subjects is needed. 
This implies that in the first cross-over st udy 16 subjects will be randomized to the sequence 
Mepilex® Border Flex in the first period and Optifoam in the second period and to the sequence 
Optifoam in the first period and Mepilex® Border Flex in the second period in proportions 1:1. 
 
In the second cross-over study 16 subjects will be randomized to the sequence Mepilex® 
Border Flex in the first period and Allevyn Life in the second period and to the sequence Allevyn 
Life in the first period and Mepilex® Border Fl ex in the second period in proportions 1:1. Both

b) led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either resulted in 
1) a life-threatening illness or injury, or 
2) a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or 
3) inpatient hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization or, 
4) medical or surgical intervention to prevent  life-threatening illness or injury or permanent 
impairment to a body structure or a body function. 
 
c) led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect. 
 
Note: Planned hospitalization for a pre-existing c ondition, or a procedure required by the CIP, 
without serious deterioration in health, is not considered a SAE. 
 
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE) 
ADE that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a SAE.   
 PROCEDURES FOR SAE AND/OR SADE REPO RTING OR REPORTING OF DD THAT 
COULD HAVE LED TO A SADE 
The investigator must inform Mölnlycke Health Care , within 1 calendar day of awareness of the 
event. When a SAE/SADE has been entered into the eCRF by the investigator /authorized site 
staff, the eCRF system will automatically generate a report to: Clinical_Investigations_Event_Reporting@molnlycke.com.  
 
In case of problem with the eCRF, a paper based version of the SAE/SADE report form 
(available in the Investigator Site File) shall be used and sent by email to: Clinical_Investigations_Event_Reporting@molnlycke.com.  
 
All SAEs/SADEs that occurs during the Clinical Investigation shall be reported, whether or not 
they are considered causally related to t he investigational device or the comparator.

TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  5 2 PRÉCIS  
2.1 Study  Title :  TRAIN- AD ( Trial  to Reduce Antimicrobial Use In Nursing home 
residents with Alzheimer’s disease and other Dementias ) 
2.2 Objective  
Conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial of an education and training intervention on 
infection management outcomes of 480 residents with advanced dementia (N=240/arm) in 24 
Boston- area nursing homes ( NHs) (N=12/arm).  
2.3 Design and Outcomes  
2.4 Design  
36 month cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT)  to evaluate a multicomponent intervention 
that me rges best practices in infectious diseases  and palliative care to improve infection 
management for suspected urinary tract infections (UTIs) and lower respirat ory tract infections 
(LRIs)  among 480 advanced dementia residents (240/a rm) living in 24 Boston area nursing 
homes (NHs)  (12/arm). Randomization and intervention implementation will be at the facility 
level. Outcomes will be measured at the resident level.   
2.5 Outcomes  
The following 12 -month outcomes related to suspected UTIs and LRIs will be compared 
between the intervention and control arms (usual care):  
PRIMARY OUTCOME :  
I. Total number of antimicrobial courses for suspected UTIs and LRIs/person -year  
 
SECONDARY OUTCOMES:  
II. Number of antimicrobial courses prescribed for suspected UTIs and LRIs when minimal criteria for treatment initiation we re absent based on consensus  guidelines/person- year  
III. Advance care planning about infection management over 12 months  defined as a 
documented discussions between proxies and providers  or a new advance directives to 
withhold antimicrobials  by any route 
oral, int ramuscular, or intravenous.  
IV. Number of burdensome procedures used to evaluate suspected LRIs and UTIs (hospital transfer, bladder catheterization, chest x -ray, and blood draws)/person -year.  
2.6 Interventions and Duration  
Each facility will participate for a total of 27 months, including a 3 -month start -up/planning 
period and 24 month intervention implementation (intervention NHs only) and data collection period. Residents will be enrolled during the first 12- months at each facility, and each resident 
will be followed for up to 12 months. 
The intervention has two main components, provider training and proxy education. 
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  6 1. Provider Training: Multifaceted approach to education of providers with direct care 
responsibilities for patients with advanced dementia.  Components include:  
a. In-person training 
b. On-line course  
c. Infection management algorithms  
d. Guidelines for communicating  with  proxies  
e. Prescribing feedback  
2. Proxy Education:  A booklet mailed to proxies of residents with advanced dementia 
describing issues related to infection management in a dvanced d ementia upon resident 
enrollment in study.  
2.7 Sample Size and  Population  
The study sample will included 480 NH resident with advanced dementia (N=240/arm). See 
statistical analytic protocol (SAP) for a full explanation of sample size calculations.

TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  11 4 PARTICIPATING  STUDY SITES  
The study is being conducted at 24 NH Boston area NHs . Eligible homes must have at least 60 
long stay beds and be within 60 miles of Boston. Sites are recruited from a pool of 95 eligible 
NHs in the Boston area.  Recruitment, randomization and study enrollment will be done in 4 waves  over a 12- month period, with each wave starting three months apart. In each wave, 6 NHs  
will begin the study (3 Control NHs and 3 Intervention NHs/wave ).  
 
STUDY OBJECTIVES  
4.1 Primary Objective  
Aim 1. To conduct a cluster RCT of an intervention to improve infection management among 480 
residents with advanced dementia (N=240/arm) residing in 24 NHs (N=12/arm) and compare the total number of antimicrobial courses for suspected UTIs and LRIs/person- year ( primary outcome) 
over 12 months in the intervention vs. control (usual care) arms. Data will be obtained from review of the residents’ charts and medication administration records q2months up to 12 months.  
H1. The number of antimicrobial courses/person- years will be lower in the intervention vs. control 
arms.  
4.2 Secondary Objectives  
Aim 2. To compare the number of antimicrobial courses prescribed for suspected UTIs and LRIs when minimal criteria for treatment initiation are absent based on consensus guidelines /person -
year in the intervention vs. control arm over 12 months.  H2. The number of courses prescribed when minimal criteria are absent /person- year will be lower 
in the intervention vs. control arm.  
Aim 3. To compare the following 2 outcomes in the intervention vs. controls arms over 12 months: i. A dvance care planning about infection management (e.g., documented discussions 
between proxies and providers, advance directives to withhold antimicrobials), and ii. N umber of 
burdensome procedures use d to evaluate suspected LRIs and UTIs (hospital transfer, bladder 
catheterization, chest x -ray, blood draws)/person- year.  
H3a. Advance care planning about infections will be higher in the intervention vs. control arms. H3b. The number of burdensome procedures/person -days will be lower in the intervention vs. 
control arms. 
5 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE   
5.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
The advanced stage of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias is characterized by the onset infect ions, which prior work suggests are widely mismanaged. Antimicrobials are extensively 
prescribed, most often without evidence to support a bacterial infection. Antimicrobial exposure is the main factor leading to multidrug - resistant organisms (MDROs); a g rowing public health 
threat. Moreover, the benefits of antimicrobials remain unclear for patients with advanced dementia, for whom infections are often a terminal event and comfort is most commonly the goal of care.  
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  12 In 2015, our group completed the S tudy of Pathogen R esistance and E xposure to A ntimicrobials 
in Dementia ( SPREAD) which prospectively examined antimicrobial use and MDRO 
acquisition in 363 NH residents with advanced dementia.9, 22 Antimicrobials were prescribed for 
72% of suspected infections, but only 44% of these episodes met guideline -based criteria for 
treatment.23 Suspected urinary tract (UTIs) and lower respiratory tract (LRIs) accounted for 94% 
of mistreated episodes. Criteria were more likely to be met when the residents’ proxies were 
counseled about antimicrobials. Two-  thirds of residents were colonized with MDROs. 
Antimicrobial use was the major risk factor for MDRO acquisition. Motivated by these findings, we conducted a pilot study (NIH R21) of a multi -faceted intervention to improve  management of 
suspected UTIs and LRIs. Unlike standard NH antimicrobial stewardship programs .
18,24 The 
intervention merged best practices in infectious diseases and palliative care, and targeted this 
unique population for whom the need and opportunity to improve infection management are 
particularly compelling.  
5.1.1 Epid emiology  
In the Choices, Attitudes, Strategies and Care of Advanced Dementia (CASCADE) study, led by 
Dr. Mitchell, 41% of participating  NH residents  with advanced dementia had suspected 
pneumonias and 53% had febrile episodes over 18 months. 1 In SPREAD, we found 66% of NH 
residents with advanced dementia had suspected infections over 1 year, most often UTIs and 
LRIs. 9 Approximately 50% of advanced dementia patients are di agnosed with pneumonia in the 
last 2 weeks of life.8, 9 The 6 -month mortality rate following pneumonia is 50%. 1, 34 
Antimicrobial use is extensive.6, 8, 35 -37 In prospective studies, 52- 66% of NH residents with 
advanced dementia received antimicrobials ov er 12 months, and 42% in the last 2 weeks of life.9, 
37 Much of this use may be inappropriate as antimicrobials are often started without adequate 
clinical evidence to support a bacterial infection. 9-15, 23, 38   Infections are often treated 
empirically in NHs without the benefit of objective tests (e.g., cultures). Thus, the Society for 
Healthcare Epidemiology of America endorsed minimal clinical criteria to initiate antimicrobials in NHs.
13  
5.1.2 Advanced dementia patients are reservoirs for multidrug resista nt organisms (MDROs  
The emergence of MDROs is a major public health threat,39-44 and growing concern in NHs.14, 16, 
19, 45 -47 Between 43 -62% of NH residents are colonized with either methicillin -resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin- resistant enteroc occi, or multidrug -resistant gram -negative 
bacteria.48, 49 MDRO colonization in NHs is associated with increased mortality,50-53 costs,54 
hospitalizations.55, 56 NH residents bring MDROs into hospitals.57-59  Our prior work showed that 
advanced dementia residents are 3 times more likely to have MDROs than other residents. 17 In 
SPREAD, we found 64% of the cohort was colonized with MDROs over 12 months.9 
Antimicrobial exposure is the strongest risk factor for MDRO acquisition,49, 51, 53, 60 -64 Thus, 
reducing  antimicrobial misuse in advanced dementia is a key opportunity to limit MDROs 
colonization in the NH setting.  
5.1.3 Benefits and burdens of treatment  
Two potential benefits may motivate treating  suspected infections in advanced dementia; 
prolonging life and sym ptom relief. In the absence of RCTs, observational studies help inform 
decision -making regarding these outcomes.6, 21, 65 -68 In CASCADE, residents with pneumonia 
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  13 treated with antimicrobials lived longer, but had more discomfort, than those who were not 
treated. 6 In SPREAD, treating suspected UTIs with antimicrob ials had no effect on survival.21  
Both the work -up and treatment of infections can be burdensome for these frail patients.69  In 
SPREAD, 74% of suspected infections involved a bladder catheterizati on, hospital transfer, 
blood draw, or chest x -ray. 69 Infections are the most common reason advanced dementia patients 
are hospitalized70 but can often be managed with similar efficacy in the NH. 6, 71, 72 Even oral 
antimicrobials may cause discomfort, as these patients often have swallowing problems.  Finally, 
older patients are more susceptible to adverse effects of antimicrobials such as Clostridium 
difficile  infections, allergic reactions, MDRO acquisition, and drug -drug interactions. 6, 37, 65, 73 -75  
5.1.4 Treatment  must align with the goals of care:  
A-quarter of all treatment decisions faced by proxies of NH residents with advanced dementia 
relate to infections. 76 Given the burdens and questionable benefits of antimicrobials, infection 
management should be approached using a framework of shared decision- making similar to 
other end- of-life treatment choices.77-80  This approach requires adherence not only to infecti ous 
disease guidelines, but also to the goals of care (e.g., life prolongation or comfort). In prior work, over 90% of proxies state comfort is the goal of care.
1, 9 For these patients, the burdens of 
assessing and treating infections may outweigh the bene fits, particularly when the likelihood of a 
bacterial infection is low.  
Several features characterize optimal shared decision -making. Ideally, counseling should be done 
as part of advance care planning rather than at the time of a crisis, and preferences documented in advance directives, such as the Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST) form. 
81 Proxies should be told to expect infections in end- stage disease, apprised of what an 
appropriate evaluation entails, and cautioned about common pitfalls leading to unnecessary antimicrobial use (e.g., asymptomatic bacteriuria). The benefits and burdens of evaluating and treating suspected infections should be presented, and the option of a purely palliative approach described (e.g., analgesics, ant ipyretics). Finally, providers should help proxies align the 
management approach with the goal of care. If the goal is to optimize comfort, it is reasonable to suggest that no evaluation be initiated for infections and palliation provided. For the minority  of 
patients for whom the goal remains to prolong life, evaluation and treatment is reasonable but only when there is adequate clinical evidence to support a bacterial infection. Optimal decision -
making does not routinely occur in practice, but when it doe s, data suggest care is improved. In 
SPREAD, only 45% of proxies were asked about preferences for antimicrobial use, and only 34% were counseled to expect infections or about treatment options. However, when they were counseled, minimal criteria for initia ting antimicrobials were more likely to be met. 
9 
5.1.5 Interventions to improve infection management in advanced dementia:  
The need to improve infection management in the general NH setting is well- recognized, 10, 24 as 
reflected in The Centers for Disease Con trol’s (CDC) recent call to expand antimicrobial 
stewardship activities in NHs.18  Although many NH residents have advanced illnesses, this CDC 
initiative as well as most standard NH antimicrobial stewardship programs, focus solely on infectious disease gu idelines, 
46, 72, 82 -87 and fail to integrate patient preferences or palliative care 
principles into prescribing algorithms, training materials, and evaluation metrics. At the same time, a growing literature has highlighted concerns about infection managem ent at the end -of-
life.
88 Our intervention merges best practices in infectious diseases and palliative care, and 
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  14 focuses on a unique subset of NH patients for whom the need to improve infection management 
is particularly compelling.  
While not focused on ad vanced dementia, prior antimicrobial stewardship NH research informs 
our study design. 46, 72, 82 -87 Loeb conducted two cluster RCTs in 22 Ontario NHs. In one, a 
facility -wide intervention to improve UTI management reduced antimicrobial use. 82 In the othe r, 
a clinical pathway for LRIs resulted in fewer hospitalizations. 72 These studies and others, 46, 72, 82, 
86, 87, 89 demonstrate that rigorous RCTs of NH interventions to improve infection management 
can be conducted and improve outcomes. Most successful  interventions have multiple 
components, and include prescribing feedback to providers to motivate behavior change. 18, 24, 86, 
87, 89, 90 More recent efforts have also recognized that for interventions to be adoptable and 
sustainable, they must target the  many interacting factors that influence NH care, and engage key 
stakeholders (e.g., medical providers, nurses, families, administrators) in learning, communication, self -monitoring, and on- going adaption. 
86, 87, 91, 92 One pilot study of a quality 
improvement program incorporating these features in 12 NHs significantly reduced antimicrobial prescriptions . 
86, 87  
5.1.6 Summary of significance.  
The significance is summarized as follows: 1. Advanced dementia is a leading cause of death. Most patients receive thei r care in NHs; 2. Advanced dementia residents are commonly 
suspected of having infections, for which antimicrobials are extensively prescribed. Minimal criteria to support a bacterial infection are absent for most treated episodes; 3. These residents are reservoirs for MRDOs. Antimicrobial use is the main risk factor for MDRO colonization; 4. 
As these residents are in the terminal phase of dementia, they may not clinically benefit from antimicrobials, especially when the likelihood of a bacterial infection is low; 5. Comfort is the goal of care for > 90% of these residents. The burdens associated with work- up and treatment of 
infections, generally do not promote comfort; 6. Most proxies are not counseled about infection management, but when they are, antimic robials are more likely to be used in accordance with 
guidelines; 7. NH interventions to improve infection management can be successfully tested in RCTs, but to be sustainable they must target the many factors that influence NH care, 8. Traditional NH antimicrobial stewardship programs do not include patient preferences or palliative care principles; and 9. TRAIN -AD builds  on prior work and address the existing  gaps, 
by applying state -of-the-art methodology for cluster RCTs 
95, 96 and conceptual underpinnings for 
successful program implementation in NHs, 86, 87, 91, 92, 97 to evaluate an intervention that merges best 
practices in infectious diseases and palliative care in a unique population for whom the need and opportunity to improve infection management i s especially compelling.  
With this foundation and leveraging a network of NHs and research infrastructure established in 4 prior NIH R01s, TRAIN -AD (Trial to Reduce Antimicrobial Use In Nursing home residents 
with Alzheimer’s disease and other Dementias),  is a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 
an intervention to improve infection management in advanced dementia. All intervention components integrate infectious disease and palliative care principles.   
6 STUDY DESIGN 
This cluster RCT will evaluate an infection management education and training program 
targeting direct care providers and proxies of residents with advanced dementia, on infection management in 480 (Control=240/  Intervention=240) patients  60 years or older with advanced 
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  15 dementia  residin g in 24 (12 Control/12 Intervention) participating Boston area nursing homes .  
The unit of randomization is the facility but the unit of analysis is the patient, clustered within 
the facility. The intervention will be implemented facility -wide, thus all pa tients with advanced 
dementia, cared for in the NHs during the 24- month implementation period are potential subjects 
in this study .  Data will be obtained from bi -monthly chart review of enrolled eligible  residents 
for up to 12 months. 
Outcomes to be compa red between patients in the intervention and control NHs include:  total 
number of antimicrobial courses for suspected UTIs and LRIs/person- year (primary outcome)  
over 12 months in the intervention vs. control (usual care) arms (Aim 1), number of 
antimicro bial courses prescribed for suspected UTIs and LRIs when minimal criteria for 
treatment initiation are absent based on consensus guidelines/person- year (secondary outcome) 
in the intervention vs. control arm over 12 months.(Aim 2), and : i. advance care pl anning about 
infection management (e.g., documented discussions between proxies and providers, advance directives to withhold antimicrobials), and ii. Number of burdensome procedures used to evaluate suspected LRIs and UTIs (hospital transfer, bladder cath eterization, chest x -ray, blood 
draws)/person -year (Aim 3) 
7 SELECTION AND ENROLL MENT OF PARTICIPANTS   
The intervention will be rolled out facility -wide . Participation  occur s at 3 levels.  Nursing homes 
will be recruite d, randomized and enrolled into  the stu dy.  Site administrators who agree to 
participate in the study will serve as gatekeepers within their facility.  Providers will be recruited to participate in the infection management training program, and eligible residents will be 
enrolled for ongoing ch art reviews to assess program effect  on infection management.  
7.1 Inclusion  Criteria  
7.1.1 Facility  inclusion criteria  
1) More than 60 beds  
2) Within 60 miles of Boston

7.3 Study Enrollment Procedures  
7.3.1 Facility Enrollment 
A total of 24 Boston area NHs will be recruited from a pool of 95 eligible NHs in the Boston area. NHs will be recruited,  randomized and enrolled in to the study in groups of 6 (3 Control / 3 
Intervention) every 3 months for one year.  T he project director will mail study information and 
a recruitment letter to the senior administrators of eligible NHs. The letter introduces  the 
intervention and implications of participation including randomization .  One week after the 
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  17 mailing, the project director  contact s the NHs’ administrators by telephone to answer questions 
and seek their participation . Face to face meetings to further explain the study are held  with 
administrators upon request.  
One month before the three- month planning period is scheduled to start, the list of 6 newly 
recruited homes will be randomiz ed.  (see SAP f or details on randomization procedures).  
Immediately following randomization, the project director contacts  each facility informing them 
of their study assignment and initiating the 3- month planning procedures.  
7.3.1.1  Facility Randomization and Stratification Procedures:  See SAP  
7.3.2 Provider Recruitment  
The research team  work s with the intervention NH leadership team and designated site  champion 
to facilitate provider recruitment and orientation throughout the intervention period.  At the start 
of the intervention and every 6 mo nths throughout intervention period, the project director 
requests a list of eligible providers from the site champion . The research team sends a packet of 
information to the providers introducing the trial, and providing them with intervention 
materials , contact information, and information related to upcoming TRAIN -AD training 
seminars . All aspects of provider participation are optional.  They can chose to participate in all, 
some or no aspects of the intervention, and can request exclusion at any time by  contacting the 
research project manager, whose contact information is provided in all outreach materials.  
7.3.3 Resident Enrollment  
We have obtained an IRB waiver of individual authorization for disclosure of personal health information (PHI) to screen and identify eligible residents.  At the start of the study and every 2 months for 12 months in each NH, the RA will interview unit nurses to identify eligible residents. Eligibility and proxy information will be confirmed by chart review. Within one week of eligibility screening, p roxies  of eligible residents  in the intervention NHs will be mailed study 
information, including  the infection management booklet and the project director’s ( PD’s ) 
contact information if  they wish to opt out.  In addition, flyers wil l be posted in ALL 
participating facilities (control and intervention) explaining  that the study is being conducted and 
that it includes data collection from the charts of residents with advanced dementia. The flyers will include contact information for th e PD to ask further questions and an opportunity for 
proxies to “opt -out”.  If proxies  do not contact the PD within two weeks , the resident will be 
enrolled  and included in bi -monthly chart review with data abstraction .  
PHI will not be removed from the fa cility. For purposes of recording and tracking eligible 
residents, s tudy IDs will be assigned to eligible residents at the point of eligibility screening.  A 
code  sheet containing the names  associated with assigned  study IDs will be stored in a secure 
location  within the participating NH.  
8 STUDY INTERVENTIONS ADMINISTRATION AND DURATION 
The entire trial will be conducted over. 36 month, each intervention facility will be involved for 
27 months which includes 3 months planning period 24 months of intervention implementation in each intervention  NH (See below) .  At each facility residents will be enrolled for the first 12 
months of the implementation period, and each resident will be followed for up to 12 months  
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  18 Control homes will follow the same timeline for resident enrollment and data collection, while 
they continue to receive usual care.  During the 3 month planning period, the research team works with the leadership and site champion in each NH to optimize program roll -out within 
each unique environment.   
The study intervention is a multi-component training and education program targeting direct care 
providers and healthcare proxies for advanced dementia NH residents, intended to improve the management of ur inary and lower respiratory tract infections in advanced dementia patients.  In 
partnership with NH leadership, the intervention is rolled out as a new program within the facility. There are two components to this practice intervention: 1. Provider Training, and 2. Proxy Education.  Intervention components aimed at the provider include: Professionally led infection management training seminars, online infection management course, and infection management guidance algorithms.  Additionally participating pres cribing providers will be sent 
bimonthly infection management feedback reports.  Proxy Education is completed by providing an infection management in Advanced Dementia booklet to proxies of patients with AD upon resident enrollment in study.    
 
8.1 Provider- directed Interventions  
Provider Training: Multifaceted approach to education of providers with direct care 
responsibilities for patients with advanced dementia.  Tr aining initiatives focus on appropriate 
diagnosis and treatment of suspected UTIs and LRIs in patients with advanced dementia.  All 
training initiatives include application of recommended diagnostic criteria, inclusion of goals of care in development of treatment plan, and provider communication training to optimize communication with healthcare  proxies throughout the process.  Communication training 
provided in the seminar and online course is further reinforced with provision of a communication tips pocket card. 
8.1.1 In-person training: 
At each NH during the start -up period and q6 months during the 24 month implementation 
period, the research team including a PI or trained physician educator,  and one or both PDs will 
lead on -site 1 -hour group training seminars to present principles of infection management in 
advanced dementia, intervention components, and approaches to proxy counseling. Seminars will include a didactic presentation, open discussion, and communication training for common challenging scenarios (e.g., proxy requesting a resident get antimicrobials when treatment is not clinically indicat ed).  To enhance sustainability, TRAIN- AD site champions will be trained to 
conduct the seminar enabling him/her to co- lead on -going sessions and be an on- site resource to 
reinforce the intervention principles. Providers that are unable to attend the on- site training will 
be offered a condensed 1:1 training session at their convenience.  

TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  19 8.1.1.1  Targeted attendees  
All providers with primary care responsibilities for residents with advanced dementia (e.g., 
medical providers (physicians, NPs, PAs, nurses) and other key individuals (e.g., Director of Nursing (DON), infection control monitor) will be t argeted to attend the seminars.  See section 
7.1.3 for description of provider eligibility criteria.  
8.1.1.2  Materials  
Invited providers will be sent a training seminar packet pr ior to the seminar which includes items 
presented in the seminar and will serve as an ongoing resource for participants , and for those 
unable to attend, the in- person training.  
8.1.2 On-line course  
The “Infection Management in Advanced Dementia" on- line course i s being offered through the 
Harvard Medical School Department of Continuing Education (HMS DCE) and has been  
approved for CME credit. The PIs created this peer -reviewed course through an iterative process 
with experts in infectious diseases, palliative car e, and geriatrics. The self -directed course 
consists of 4 virtual patient cases, 2 for UTIs and 2 for LRIs, with 3- 4 multiple choice 
questions/case , and 3 communication training videos embedded within the course . Participants 
receive response- specific, evi dence -based feedback, and complete a 12 -item multiple -choice 
pre/post knowledge test. Providers  including RNs, LPNs, NPs, PAs and MDs  with direct care 
responsibilities for advanced dementia residents will be targeted to complete the course. Instructions on how to access the course will be in the orientation package and reviewed at the initial training. Participating providers will receive $50 from the research team 1 CME credit for completing the course for which the usual $50 will be waived.  
Providers are encouraged to complete the course by the end of the first month following 
invitation .  The course website provides the research team with provider participation data, to 
inform ongoing engagement efforts directed toward providers .  Several strategies will be used to 
promote timely completion.   Weekly  reminders will be sent by the PD  to non- participant s for up 
to 1 month (mail/email)  and t he site champion will also be given the names of providers that 
have not completed the course to encourage their particip ation.  
8.1.3 Algorithms  
Algorithms guiding appropriate antimicrobial initiation for suspected UTIs and LRIs that 
integrate palliative care principles and patient preferences are used throughout the training program and displayed throughout intervention NHs t o reinforce provider learning .  Laminated 
5” X 7” pocket reference cards with the algorithms, will be given to providers in their orientation material packet  and made available throughout the study.  
8.1.4 Prescribing Feedback Reports  
A key component of the intervention is the provision of infection management feedback to prescribing providers within intervention NHs.  This, prescribing feedback reports will be sent to all prescribing providers and the site champions  based on data abst racted from the charts, 
including: 1. Proportion of residents given antimicrobials for suspected LRIs and UTIs when minimal criteria were absent in prior 2 months, and which criteria were absent, 2. Benchmarking 
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  20 of inappropriately treated episodes for indi vidual prescriber with other prescribers in the facility 
and in other intervention NHs, and 3. Time trends for these parameters.   
8.2 Proxy Education:  
The goal for proxy education is to promote informed decision- making for resident care that it is 
concordant with preferences, which is also desired goal for high quality nursing home care. At 
the time of resident enrollment, English -speaking proxies of enrolled residents will be sent a 
booklet written by the co -PIs, professionally reviewed and translated into 6th grade reading level 
that explains in a lay fashion:  i. the nature of urinary and respiratory tract infections in advanced 
dementia, ii. Treatment options (antimicrobials vs. only comfort care), iii. Concerns about antimicrobial overuse, and iv. Features  of appropriate antimicrobial use. Proxies will be sent the 
booklet following resident screening and encouraged to discuss infections in advanced dementia 
with their family member’s direct care providers .   
8.3 Handling of Study Interventions  
Intervention Imp lementation : The implementation plan aims to strike a balance between 
maximizing intervention adherence, and sustainability. While its components emphasize a 
standardized approach to UTIs and LRI  management , NHs will have the opportunity to adapt 
implementation to their own environment.  To increase likely program success , the research team 
will encourage ongoing communication between providers and proxies regarding infection management planning, and encourage integration of aspects of the  infection managem ent 
program into NHs’ quality improvement programming.  Various supports will be put in place to help sustain the program  and support the NH implementation team.  These supports include 
provision of information support for the site champions.  A compendium  of reference and 
guidance materials is provided to each site.  Additionally, the research team will be available to site champions for ongoing support through monthly huddles and one on one check in calls.   Finally , members of the research implementation  team will meet with the NH implementation 
and leadership team every 3 to 6 months to review program implementation and optimize as necessary.  
8.4 Facility Start -Up 
Program start up within all participating nursing homes  will happen over three month periods .   
8.4.1 Control home Start -up 
Following randomization, the project director contacts the administrator to inform them of the facility’s research assignment , facilitate a brief environmental scan questionnaire , and schedule a 
brief (30 minute) in- service for the l eadership team and staff to introduce them to the study and 
data collection procedures .  At the start of data collection , flyers informing residents and family 
members about the study will be posted throughout the facility . 
8.4.2 Intervention home Start -up 
Following randomization, the project director contacts the administrator of the intervention NH and informs them of their study assignment.  She reminds him/her of the implications of the intervention assignment, asks him or her to select a site champion a nd facilitates completion of 
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  21 the environmental scan questionnaire.  Study start- up within intervention homes will involve at 
least 3 in -person meetings and up to weekly check -in phone calls  between the research team PD 
and the site champion.  During  this time members of the TRAIN AD team will meet with 
members of the leadership team and site champion  within the NH to review the program and 
intervention components and strategize about the best way to implement them within the NH.  
The following activities will occur during the 3 month planning period within intervention facilities:   
1. Identify TRAIN -AD site champion  
2. Completion of infection management questionnaire  
3. Develop impleme ntation plan with NH leadership during 3 on- site planning meetings  
4. Identify target ed providers  
5. Schedule training seminar  
6. Provide orientation packages, conduct training seminars, and introduce on -line course to 
targeted providers  
7. Conduct final facility set- up (e.g., hang  posters of algorithms  and study flyers throughout 
NH).   
8.4.2.1 Identifica tion of site champion  
At the start of the planning period, each NH will designate at least one champion . This individual 
needs to be someone engaged in infection management who  understands the special concerns of 
advanced dementia residents. The site champ ion will most likely be either the DON, individual 
responsible for infection control, or nurse directing dementia care. The site champion will work 
with the research team throughout the planning and intervention period to facilitate successful program impl ementation.  He or she serves as a primary contact for both providers within the 
NH and for the research team.  Site champions are provided with a compendium of references and support tools at the start of the program and in encouraged to contact the proje ct director 
with questions or concerns.  Monthly phone conference huddles will be held when site champions from all intervention sites have the opportunity to discuss the program and provide suggestions/support to one another.  The champion is an on- site leader and resource, work ing 
with both facility and research team to increase likelihood of  program  success.   Site champion s 
will: 
• Help t ailor TRAIN -AD to NH culture  
• Identify and motivate providers  
• Facilitate training seminars  
• Review prescribing feedback reports  
• Encourage infection management discussions in care planning  
• Integrate program into quality improvement activities  
8.4.2.2  Development of i mplementation plan with NH leadership  
Successful program planning and implementation depends on teamwork between members of the facility team and the research team.  This starts with the 3 month planning period where in the 
research team and NH team meet at least monthly to review and optimize plan for program roll -
out.  Throughout the program, the research team will work with members of the facility team to optimize the program within the facility and to support program activities within the facility.   
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  22 8.4.2.3  Identify targeted providers  
See section 7.1.3 for description of provider eligibility criteria. Prior to the program’s i nitial 
provider training seminar and every 6 months  throughout the program (months 6,12, 18) , the site  
champion will generate a list of providers with primary care responsibilities for residents with 
advanced dementia who will be targeted to complete the t raining seminar and on- line course  
8.4.2.4  Provide orientation pack ets, conduct training seminars, and introduce on- line course to targeted 
providers  
Two weeks prior to all training seminars, the project director will send orientation packets to targeted providers .  Each provider will be invited to attend one of the seminars where the 
TRAIN -AD program and components will be reviewed in detail.  Providers will be asked to 
utilize reference materials and participate in the online course within one month of receiving the course invitation. Group seminars will be conducted at the NH twice the same day to reach various shifts .  One on one  sessions will be arranged for providers unable to attend the group 
training.   The first training seminar marks the official start of the intervention period within each 
facility.  
8.4.2.5  Conduct final facility set -up (e.g., hang posters of algorithms and study flyers throughout NH).   
Immediately following initial training seminar , intervention materials will be posted and made 
available throughout the facility.  The site champion will be asked to contact the research team for more materials as necessary throughout the intervention period.  
8.5 On-going implementation  
Ongoing implementa tion will involve a number of procedures and strategies  to support efforts 
within participating NHs and to encourage program success.   
1. The research team and a trained physician will meet with the NH leadership every 6 months to review the overall project status, prescribing feedback, provider training and course completion, and proxy reaction to booklets. They will strategize about ways to further improve implementation.  
2. On-site training seminars  will be conducted by our team every 6 months to train newly  
hired providers, reinforce learning for on -going providers, and review  cases to illustrate 
key points, and problem -solve ongoing concerns. (With time, the site champion will co -
lead these sessions ).  
3. Prescribing feedback reports will be sent to the TRAIN -AD site champion and 
prescribing providers every 2 months.    
4. The research team will facilitate huddles  every quarter for site champions  at multiple 
intervention facilities .   
5. Study materials will be available and on display and resident charts will be reviewed every other month throughout the intervention period. 
The chart below reflects the schedule of activities  which occur during the 24- month 
implementation period at each NH:  
 
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  23  
 
8.5.1 Materials distributed/displayed throughout NH  
Study materials will be posted and available throughout the intervention period.  Research notice 
flyers and a lgorithm posters will remain posted  throughout the intervention period.  All other 
study materials will be available through the study site champion and research team upo n request 
including:  booklets, algorithms and communication guidance cards  
8.5.2 Integration into care planning practices  
During the provider training seminar and throughout the intervention period, direct care providers are encouraged to include infection mana gement in quarterly care planning meetings.  
In the letter accompanying the booklet at the time of mailing, proxies are encouraged to discuss the booklet with their providers.   
8.5.3 Program Evaluation  
Throughout the intervention period, pr ogram implementation success will be monitored.  By the 
following metrics: i. the proportion of targeted provider s who attended an initial training  session, 
ii. the proportion of targeted providers who completed the online course, and iii. rate of suspected UTIs and LRIs treat ed when minimal criteria not present as measured by the q2month 
prescribing provider feedback reports. The project director will also regularly ( see section 8.5.4) 
with the site champion to review the project’s status, problem solve any issues, and adapt t he 
program as needed. The re search team encourages  the NH leadership team and site champion to 
include the TRAIN -AD program in their quality improvement initiatives . 
8.5.4 Team  check -in meetings  
Throughout the intervention period, the research PD will engage the champion in periodic check -
in meetings to address questions or issues that arise.  The PD will make monthly phone calls and schedule on- site meetings with champion and members of the leade rship team every 6 months or 
as desired to review  program progress , and address  questions and concerns  as they arise 
throughout the trial . 
8.5.5 Provider recruitment and training

8.5.6 Provider feed back reports  
Every 2months, starting in month 3, site champions and providers will be sent (mail/email) reports with aggregated facility data. Each provider will receive their own data.  
8.5.7 Resident screening and enrollment  
Bi-screening  eligibility screenin g and enrollment of new residents will be ongoing for the first 12 
months in each participating facility.  
8.5.8 Mail  booklet to proxies  
Within one week of every bimonthly resident eligibility screening, the project director facilitate s 
the mailing of study infor mation and the infection management booklet s to the proxies of eligible 
residents.  The mailing includes research team contact information for the proxy to use to request exclusion from the study and is accompanied by a letter from the site champion explai ning the 
contents and reason for the mailing .  Following the 12 month enrollment period, proxies and 
providers can still obtain a copy of the booklets from the site champion or by request to the research team.  
8.5.9 Resident follow -up 
Bimonthly chart reviews will be conducted for 12 months or until dea th for all enrolled residents.  
8.5.10 Quarterly  site champion “huddles”  
The research project director will facilitate monthly “huddles”  via conference call for all active 
site champions .  The huddles provide an opportunity  for the champions to exchange ideas and 
experiences in their role and provide an opportunity for them to support and problem solve with other site champions  
8.6 Concomitant Interventions  
Following randomization, but prior to initiation of intervention period, the PD conducts a structured survey with senior administrator s in all control and intervention facilities to ascertain 
information the facility’s infection management activities , advance care planning practices, and 
palliative care/hospice services. R egardless of whether or not participating facilities engage in a 
separate antimicrobial stewardship program s during our intervention period, all randomized NHs 
will be retained in the analyses in accordance with intention -to-treat principles.  
8.7 Intervention  fidelity 
Our approach fidelity monitoring reflects an attempt to balance intervention adherence with a pragmatic approach to implementation. All targeted providers will be sent the orientation package (printed training material, laminated cards with algorithms), and be exposed to the algorithms posters strategically place in the NH. We will aim for >90% attendance of providers at either an initial group training group or 1:1 session and 70% completion of the on- line course. 
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  25 Prescribing feedback reports will pr ovide an on- going measure of adherence to the management 
algorithms.  
9 DATA COLLECTION ELEM ENTS AND PROTOCOL   
9.1 Facility Data  
Nursing home data are collected prior to the start of the study for descriptive purposes and to 
inform the development of a list of eligible nursing homes for recruitment. Prior to recruitment 
efforts, NH characteristics that may be relevant to advanced dementia care,  were abstracted from 
the Medicare Nursing Home Compare, including: the number of beds, hospital -based, special 
care dem entia unit, nursing and nursing assistant hours/resident/day, and number of deficiencies 
on state inspections. Long -term Care: Facts on Care in the US ( http://www.ltcfocus.org/ ) is also 
used to gather information about potentially eligible NHs that will he lp balance factors for the 
randomization procedures (see SAP), including number of beds, number of residents with 
advanced cognitive impairment, and number of Black residents .  Administrators of participating 
facilities are al so asked whether NPs/PAs are o n staff and whether there is an open or c losed 
medical staff.  At the time of initial enrollment and e very 12 months during the implementation 
period, f ollowing randomization, but prior to initiation of intervention period, the PD conducts a 
structured wri tten survey with senior administrators in all control and intervention facilities to 
ascertain information the facility’s infection management activities, advance care planning practices, and palliative care/hospice services.  
9.2 Resident assessments  
Resident  data will be collected by RAs masked  to the study arms . All data will be obtained from 
the residents’ charts except for functional status  and proxy ability to communicate in English, 
which will be ascertained in a 1 -minute nurse interview . Data is collect ed from the medical 
records of enrolled residents every 2 months for up to 12 months , unless the resident passes or 
the proxy requests to opt out during that time.  Their charts are  abstracted at baseline, q2months, 
and within 30 days of death to determine  whether antimicrobials were prescribed. If a treated 
episode was a suspected LRI or UTI, documented signs/symptoms will be ascertained to assess 
whether minimal criteria to start antimicrobials were present. Procedures used to evaluate these episodes (chest x -rays, bladder catheterization, blood draws, hospital transfer), and documented 
advance care planning about infection management (provider/proxy discussions and advance directives to withhold antimicrobials) will also be collected.  A 1-minute nurse int erview at 
baseline will also be done to assess the resident’s functional status. 
Demographic:  (baseline) age, gender, race, ethnicity, length of NH stay, residing in a special care 
dementia unit, and proxy contact information (for mailing booklet) and rela tionship to resident.  
 
Medical co -morbidity : (baseline) All active medical diagnoses.  
Functional status: (baseline; nurse) Bedford Alzheimer’s N ursing Severity -Subscale (BANS 
range, 7 -28; higher score worse disability ) 
 
Antimicrobial exposure:  (q2months, death) While analyses focus on treatment of suspected LRIs 
and UTIs, details about all antimicrobial courses will be ascertained from the medication administration records, including; suspected diagnoses, administration dates, agent, dose, route, 
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  26 and pres cribing provider. There are many ways to quantify antimicrobial exposure. We chose 
number of courses/person- years as our primary outcome as it best captures the intent of the 
intervention which is to reduce antimicrobial initiation. A course will be define d as starting an 
antimicrobial after a > 3 -day treatment -free interval. Multiple antimicrobials given 
simultaneously for an episode will be considered single course for analytic purposes. For 
descriptive purposes, we will also quantify antimicrobial exposure as days of therapy (DOT)/person -days.  
Treated suspected UTIs and LRIs : (q2months, death): Documented  details will be collected for 
treated suspected UTIs and LRIs, including: i. vital signs, mental status changes, localized signs and symptoms (e.g., lun g sounds, cough, hematuria), ii. procedures used to evaluate including 
bladder catheterizations, chest x -rays, blood draws, iii. hospital transfer (admission or emergency 
room (ER), and vi. treatment discussions between providers and proxies. Signs and sym ptoms 
will be used to determine whether minimal criteria to initiate antimicrobials were met as operationalized in SPREAD and the pilot study.  
Advance care planning:  (baseline, q2months, death). The occurrence and date of advance care 
planning events will be ascertained from all available documentation (e.g., progress notes physician orders, POLST forms) and will include: discussions between providers and proxies about infection management and new directives to withhold antimicrobials (intravenous, intramus cular and/or oral) will be ascertained. Do -not-resuscitate and do -not-hospitalize orders 
will also be collected for descriptive purposes.  
Devices:  (baseline, q2months, death) feeding tubes, foley catheters  
Health services:  (q2months, death) hospitalizati ons, emergency room visits, hospice enrollment.

9.2.1 Consenting Procedure  (also see sections 7 and 16.2)  
In accordance with federal guidelines, the HSL IRB granted a waiver of informed consent for the 
participation of both providers and residents (i.e., from proxies) based on: i. The determination of 
minimal risk, ii. The trial could not be practically conducted without the waiver. The NH is the unit of randomization and the intervention will be implemented as a new program for all advanced dementia residents. Including all eligible residents (versus only those consenting) reflects how the intervention would be used in the “real -world,” thus enhances the trial’s 
generalizability and inter pretability, and iii. The trial does not adversely affect the rights and 
welfare of the subjects. Providers and proxies will have the opportunity to opt out  at the start and 
throughout the implementation period, as described in S ection 7.   
9.2.2 Baseline Assess ments  
The charts of all eligible residents will be including in the baseline data abstraction unless the proxy has contacted the study team with a request for exclusion.  Baseline assessments are chart review and data extraction along with a 1 minutes Bedf ord Alzheimer’s Nursing Severity -
Subscale (BANS) interview to assess residents functional status. Baseline assessment includes the following:  
• Demographics  
• Health status  
• Chronic or co- morbidi ties 
• Advanced directives  
• Recent history of treatments or investi gations  
• Healthcare utilization  
• BANS interview  
• Infection Screen  
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  28 9.2.3 Follow -up Visits  
Follow up chart reviews will be completed every 2 months for up to 1 year or until the resident 
dies.  If the resident dies during the 12 month follow up period, a post -death chart review will be 
conducted. Follow -up chart reviews include the following elements:  
• Demographics  
• Advance directives  
• Treatments/Investigations  
• Healthcare utilization  
• Sentin el Events  
• Infection Screen  
9.2.4 Post death Chart review  
Post death chart reviews will be conducted within 30 days of enrolled residents passing.  The research nurse will access the residents chart in the same way as she did for follow up chart reviews and collect the following information:  
• Advance directives  
• Treatments/Investigations  
• Health care utilization  
• Sentin el events  
• Infection Screen  
10 HUMAN SUBJECT PROTECTIONS  
10.1 Sources of Data  
Residents’ NH record : The residents’ medical record containing information collected for routine 
clinical care will be abstracted at the baseline, q 2month and death assessments for up to 12 months. The following information will be obtained from the chart: demographic inform ation, 
antimicrobial exposure and prescribing provider, lower respiratory and urinary tract episodes, medical comorbidity, advance care planning, devices, health care utilization, acute medical illnesses, and death date.  
Nurse interviews:  During screening  procedures, nurses will be asked to identify subjects who 
meet criteria for Global Deterioration Stage 7. For enrolled residents, at baseline only, nurses will be asked to rate the functional status of the patients using the Bedford Alzheimer’s Nursing Severity -Subscale during a 1- minute interview.  
  
On-line course:  Individual provider completion of the on- line course will be tracked.  
NH residents, proxies, and NH providers (intervention arm only) will be assigned a study number known only to the co- principal investigators (PIs) and research assistants (RAs). NH 
providers in t he intervention arm will be g iven a unique username and password to access the on-
line education course known only to them, the PIs and project director. All documentation will 
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  29 be stored in a locked area, accessible only to the PIs, RAs, and data manager. Data will be stored 
on computer workstations, accessible only through use of a unique password. Access to these 
data will be limited to study personnel on a “need to know” basis.  
11 POT ENTIAL RISKS OF STUDY PROCEDURES  
The study meets criteria for minimal risk. All the resident data will be obtained from their medical record and nursing interviews, and coded at the time of data entry to protect their confidentiality. The residents in the control NHs will receive usual care for suspected infections. Residents in the intervention arm will receive care for the suspected infections at the discretion of their primary care providers as guided by the practice intervention. Given that the intervention is based on consensus, peer reviewed guidelines, the risk from the intervention with regards to infection management is minimal.  
11.1 Potential Medial Risk to Study Participants  
Patients with advanced dementia are very frail. In the natural course of the d isease, we expect of 
40% mortality rate over one year. Thus, while deaths will be reported to the Data Safety Monitor , they are not considered an adverse event. The intervention does not involve any direct 
treatment of residents. Treatment of suspected inf ections is ultimately at the discretion of the 
nursing home primary care provider. Nonetheless, as part of this study, every 2 months, we will be collecting data from the residents ’ charts about the rates of suspected urinary and respiratory 
infections, tr eatment of these infections, and appropriateness of that treatments as defined by our 
primary outcome.  
11.2 Potential psychosocial (non -medical) risks, discomforts, inconveniences of study 
procedures  
We do not anticipate any potential psycho -social risks discomforts or inconveniences of study 
procedures beyond those encountered in usual care practices.  The intervention provides 
information for proxies about infections in advanced dementia resident s to promote informed 
decision -making that it is concordant with preferences, which is also desired goal for high 
quality nursing home care. The intervention was very well -received with no adverse events in the 
pilot study. Thus, we believe the intervention does not incur any greater distress than usual practice. Second, data collection conforms to the definition of minimal risk. No direct input from the residents or proxies is needed to complete any data for this study. All resident data are already being coll ected as part of routine medical care with the exception of the 1 -minute nursing 
interview at baseline to quantify the resident’s functional status for descriptive purposes.  All resident data are entered into a password protected encrypted software system  using unique study 
identifiers.  The data sheet linking residents with unique study ids is maintained in a separate secure system location at the discretion of the study site champion.  
 One additional potential burden of this study is the time commitment of the NH staff to assist with eligible subject identification, which involves 1 -minute baseline nursing interviews, and 
intervention implementation. We will make every effort to minimize staff burden. Staff at the ~60 facilities that have participated in our prior large studies that used similar methods to recruit residents with advanced dementia felt the procedures were not too onerous. Based on our experience, the baseline nursing interview to quantify functional status is expected to take ~1 
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  30 minute to c omplete. It is unlikely this burden will fall on a single nurse. Every effort will be 
made to conduct these interviews at times that are convenient for the nurses. Some burden will 
be experienced by the TRAIN -AD site champion and 15- 20 targeted providers/N H (12 -16 
nurses, 1- 3 physicians, 0- 3 NPs/PAs) in the 12 intervention NHs with respect to the time 
required for initial training, completion of the on -line education course, use of algorithms to 
guide antimicrobial initiation, and review of prescribing feed back reports. All training 
procedures will be done at the convenience of these providers. Their involvement is voluntary. Group seminars will be conducted twice the same day to reach various shifts, and 1:1 sessions will be arranged for providers unable to attend the group training. The on- line course can also be 
done at the providers’ convenience.  
11.3 Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
The study intervention is a facility level training and educational program in line with CDC 
recommendations for infection management and antimicrobial stewardship programming .  The 
research team has no direct contact with study participants .   W e do not anticipate any serious 
adverse events or adverse events to occur in this study .  
11.4 Reporting Procedures  
Although, th ere are no anticipated adverse events,  should an y unanticipated study -related event 
of concern come to the attention of any research team member (i.e., report by site champion, proxy or provider), it will documented on a ‘event of concern’ form by the PD a nd reviewed 
within 24 hours with the PI. Site champions will be trained on this procedure during the 3- month 
facility planning period.  Any unanticipated adverse event will be promptly reported in writing to 
the NIH and the HSL IRB  within 48 hours by the P I. 
11.5 Follow-up for Adverse Events :  
If an adverse even t was deemed to have occurred, the site c hampion will be instructed to check 
on the provider/ family /resident  who experienced the event  within  24 hours of the event t o see 
how he/she is managing. If deemed necessary, the individual will b e referred to the appropriate 
health care professional based on the nature of the event (i.e, counseling with a NH social 
worker , medical attention by a physician) . In the case of a provider or family member, if deemed 
necessary, the site champion  may suggest to the proxy that he/she contact his/her own primary 
care provider. The research project director will contact the facility site  champion within 48 
hours of the event  to determine the status of the provider/ family /resident  and whether further 
follow -up was deemed necessary. The project director will report the follow -up information to 
the PI (by telephone) and to the data safety monitor  (in writing) within 72 hours. 
11.6 Safety Monitorin g 
As agreed upon by the NIA and overseeing project officer, Dr. Marcel Salive, safety monitoring will be the responsibility of a Data Safety Monitor  (DSM), Dr. David Mehr of the University of 
Missiouri.  The PI will meet with Dr. Mehr during the preparatio n stage of the study via 
conference call, to provide input and guidance on the study evaluation and intervention protocols, data handling activities, and quality assurance and safety issues. Together they will agree on definitions of an adverse event and t he content of the regular DSM reports. Once the 
study starts, the DSM will be sent a report prepared by the research team summarizing the 
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  31 overall study status, recruitment, data completion rates, adverse events, protocol deviations, and 
outcomes (if desire d). Data will be presented aggregated for both arms of the RCT, and in a sub-
report that the PI will not see, in a semi- blinded fashion with study arms labeled as Group 1 and 
Group 2. The DSM will be free to determine the need to stop the continuation of t he study based 
on examination of these reports. 
12 INTERVENTION DISCONT INUATION  
The study may be discontinued at any time by the IRB, the NIA , OHRP  or other government 
agencies as part of their duties to ensure that research participants are protected. Individual NHs 
in the intervention arm may withdraw from study participation at any time at the discretion of their senior management or corporate supervisors. Providers can opt out of any part of intervention participation at any time, and while not being aske d to provide informed consent for 
this research, resident proxies can opt out of reading the infection management booklet and contact the research team at any time to request exclusion of their resident from ongoing data collection efforts.  Program being adopted into the clinical practice of participating intervention NHs. Such refusals are expected as part of this pragmatic trial.  
13 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  (SEE SAP)  
 DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
13.1 Data Use Agreements  
There are no Data Use Agreement (DUA) for this study .  All facility level data comes from 
public data sources and all resident data is obtained from residents’ medical charts, with the exception of a 1 -minute nurse interview at baseline to assess the resident’s functional statu s. 
13.1.1  Residents:  
Data will be collected by a trained RAs masked to the aims, outcomes, and that there are 2 arms. All data will be obtained from the residents’ charts except for functional status and proxy ability to communicate in English , which will be ascertained in a 1 -minute nurse interview at baseline. 
Charts will be abstracted (~20 minutes) when residents are first enrolled (baseline), q2months, and within 30 days of death, for up to 12 months. R EDcap will be used for collecting data  
electronically and tracking protocol elements.  
All resident data will be entered and managed in HSL  data systems under a confidential study 
ID. The code sheet linking study ID to individual resident will be kept in a secure location within the NH. HSL dat a bases will maintain data under subject study ID related to nursing home name, 
age, and gender . Access to this code sheet will be limited to the RA assigning the codes, the 
study site champion and the project manager as needed to facilitate mailing of booklets to proxies of enrolled residents.   
13.1.2  Proxies  
Proxy information is collected to facilitate mailing of the infection management booklet and study information. Information collected is limited to name and mailing address which is abstracted from the resi dent’s chart, and the proxy’s ability to communicate in English, which is 
obtained from the unit nurses.  All proxy information will be maintained in the secure study 
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  32 subject cod e sheet  maintained within the NHs.  
13.2 Identifiers to be stored separately from resident data  
13.2.1  Key or link to the codes  
A code sheet linking individual residents and proxy information with the assigned study IDs will 
be kept in hard copy and/or electronic format on a password protected flash drive in a secure location within the particip ating NH. The location and means of securing this data will be 
decided in collaboration with the NH leadership team and study champion.  
13.2.1.1 Individuals (or study roles) who will have access to identifiable data, or key/link to codes  
Research assistants who will be conducting eligibility screenings  and subsequent chart reviews, 
study site champions, and project director s who will be sending the proxy materials from within 
the nursing home  have access to the study ID code sheet.  
13.3 Data security measures  
All access to data is restricted to those in the research group who have been authorized by the PI to utilize this information.  Because HSL is a licensed hospital, the information technology group adheres to all the policies and practices under the HIPAA regulati ons.  Although not required, 
HSL treats all lines of business as HIPAA locations and hold them accountable to these security 
standards  therefore, creating a very tight computing environment.   In order to preserve 
confidentiality, subjects will be assigned  a study number known only to the co- PIs, PDs, RAs 
and data manager. A code sheet linking individual residents and proxy information with the 
assigned study IDs will be kept in hard copy and/or electronic format on a password protected flash drive in a sec ure location within the participating NH.  
All data collected electronically by RAs on laptop computer using internet- based electronic data 
capture programs (i.e., R EDcap) accessible only to research personnel through the use of unique 
password. All written  documentation with subject information will be stored in a locked area 
within the nursing home , accessible only to the RAs , PDs, and site champion. All data will be 
stored on computer workstations, accessible only through use of a unique password. Access to these data will be limited to study personnel on a “need to know” basis. If a NH resident is deemed ineligible for the study, all personal health information obtained for screening purposes will be destroyed as soon as possible.  
13.3.1 Timing of destruction o f materials containing identifiers and keys/links to codes  
Once the study has ended and all subjects have been followed for safety and study outcomes.  
13.3.2 Method for destroying materials with identifiers and keys/links to codes  
Paper documents will be shredded and electronic files will be deleted.  
13.4 Data Collection Forms  
There are three levels of d ata collection.  Data are collected at the start of the study and annually 
thereafter from NH leadership related to the site’s independent infection management initiatives and readiness for infection management program implementation.  Resident level data are 
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  33 collected at baseline and every 2 months for 12 months or until the resident deceases.  Provider 
level data are  collected via site champion interaction and from the ir participation in the HMS 
online course.  Finally, proxy name and mailing address is obtained from the resident’s chart during eligibility screening.  
13.4.1 Facility level data collection  
General facility information including its size, address, for -profit status, acuity status and 
demographic data is obtained from public data sources including Medicare Nursing Home Compare and LTCfocus.  Facility level data collection will be conducted by the research team in an effort to ascertain potential concomitant initiatives and to assess readiness for new program implementation.   This questionnaire has been built into the Redcap  data project and conducted 
prior to program planning efforts within the facility and annually thereafter.  
13.4.2 Resident Data collection forms  
The following data collection forms, programed into redcap are used for resident -level data 
collection: 
• Resident eligibility  screening  
• Baseline resident chart review  
• Resident bimonthly chart reviews  
• Post Death Chart review  
• Infection Screening (occurs at baseline and bimonthly chart reviews)  
• UTI and LRI infection modules (used when either UTI or LRI are recorded during an  
• infection screening)  
13.4.3 Provider level data collection  
Provider names and contact information will be obtained by the research project dire ctor from 
the site champion.  Data related to their participation in the online course will be obtained from HMS  website .  This data will include the provider results on the pre and post -test and course 
completion status.  Data will be uploaded and mainta ined in a R EDap provider  database 
maintained by the project manager within IFAR.  Access to this data will be limited to the project director and study data analyst in blinded form.  
13.5 Data Management  
Data management and analysis for the study will take place at HSL under the direction of the 
informatics and biostatistics cores at the Institute for Aging Research (IFAR). All access to data is restricted to those on the research team who have been authorized by the PI to use this information. The HSL information technology (IT) department adheres to all the policies and practices under HIPAA regulations and is responsible for securing IFAR's IT infrastructure including physical servers and application software. IFAR has established additional sensitive data poli cies and procedures in concert with the IRB to ensure safe data handling by faculty and 
staff.  
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  34 13.5.1 Resident/Proxy data collection  
One to t wo research a ssistants (RAs) will be responsible for screening subjects and conducting 
chart reviews. To the extent possi ble, the RAs collecting outcome data through chart reviews and 
follow -up proxy interviews will be blinded to nursing home randomization. All data will be 
collected and entered electronically by the RAs using laptop computers in the field. State -of-the-
art electronic data capture software and programming (e.g., R EDCap) will be used for these 
purposes. Once entered, the data will be downloaded and entered into the computer systems at 
HSL IFAR for cleaning, programming and analyses. 
13.5.2 Provider data collection and management  
The pre/post knowledge scores of providers doing the education modules in intervention NHs will be submitted to the research team by the staff at the HMS CME office using a password protected electronic computer file. Once received, HSL data m anagement will strip the scores of 
subject identifiers and enter the data into the electronic data file.   
13.6 Quality Assurance  
13.6.1 Training 
All research staff have been trained in human subject safety and data security measures.  SOPs document procedural require ments for all study related activities. Each member of the research 
team is  trained in their research role by the PI and PDs in accordance to the SOP.  Cross training 
among the research team ensures redundancy  within the team to ensure uninterrupted proced ures 
throughout the trial.   
13.6.2 Protocol  Deviations  
All identified protocol procedures will be tracked in a protocol deviations database by the project director and included in periodic reports to the data safety monitor for review . 
13.6.3 Monitoring 
The TRAIN -AD program is designed to be adapted to optimize implementation within each 
participating NH.  A few essential elements will be monitored by the research team during 
periodic site visits and implementation check -in meetings with the site champion s.  Essential 
components include the visible display of study flyers and infection management guidelines throughout the facility.  Additionally, the PD will ensure, through ongoing interactions with the site champion that all new providers are invited to participate in the on -site trainings and online 
course.  The RA conducting the periodic chart review will ensure that the procedures for maintaining securing around the participant code sheet are being followed within the facility. The PD will conduct monthly reviews of data collection to ensure that all targeted data collection is completed in a timely manner.  
14 PARTICIPANT  RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY   
14.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review  
This protocol and the informed consent and HIPAA waiver applications  have been reviewed and 
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  35 approved by Hebrew Senior Life’s IRB.  Continuation of study is contingent on annual review 
and approval by the IRB.  Any changes to study protocol or materials will be submitted to the IRB for review and approval prior to implement ation.   
14.2 Informed Consent Forms  
A waiver of informed consent and HIPAA Waiver of Patient Authorization was approved by the 
NIH, and Hebrew  Senior Life’s Institutional Review Board, based on federal guidelines  45 CFR 
46.116(d)):  
1. The research involves no mor e than minimal risk to the participants;  
2. The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the participants;  
3. The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration; and  
4. Whenever appropriate, the participants will be provided with additional pertinent information 
after participation.  
14.2.1 The study meets criteria for minimal risk as per HHS 45 CFR 45.102:  
“Minimal risk means that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research  are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or 
during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.”  
Explanation  
First, TRAIN -AD is an education and training program rolled out at the facility level which 
promotes the general recommendations of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) that NHs engage in antimicrobial stewardship activities as a standard of care.  The educational content of the program is aligned with CDC recommendations for  antimicrobial prescribing based on 
national consensus guidelines, intended to improve infection management for residents with advanced dementia.  The program also provides information for proxies about infections in advanced dementia residents to promote informed decision- making that is patient- centered and 
consistent with goals for patient care.  At no point will members of the research team have direct contact with residents or proxies or directly affect care.  
Second,  data collection conforms to the defi nition of minimal risk. Data collected for research 
purposes will be obtained through bimonthly review and abstraction from the charts of enrolled residents and a single 1 -minute nursing interview at baseline to quantify the resident’s functional 
status fo r descriptive purposes. Research data will be maintained in an encrypted, password 
protected database which uses unique study IDs for all enrolled residents and proxies. The code sheet linking study subjects with study IDs will be kept in a secure location  within the 
participating NH.  
14.2.2 The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of participants  
Explanation  
TRAIN -AD is a facility -wide education and training program that promotes CDC established 
best practices for infection management and CMS recommendations for antimicrobial stewardship within nursing homes.  The program promotes the provision of patient -centered care 
in an effort to improve care quality, but individual treatment decisions remain entirely at the discretion of the residents’ medical providers.  Research team members have no direct contact 
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  36 with residents or proxies and all. With the exception of the 1- minute nurse interview to 
characterize functional status, all resident data will be obtained from residents’ existing  s medical 
record, and recorded in the secure research database using unique study identifiers.  Study 
information is mailed to proxies of eligible residents and posted throughout the facility.  
Residents’ healthcare proxies can opt -out of allowing the res earch team to include resident data 
in the study at any time.  
14.2.3 The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration  
Explanation  
Obtaining individual informed consent for this study is impractical for this facility -level 
education and training program, which involves no direct contact by our research team with either residents or proxies and leaves resident care decisions entirely at the discretion of the providers. The intervention is being rolled- out facility -wide, so al l residents with advanced 
dementia within the facility are potentially affected by the program.  The waiver of consent enables us to assess the effect of the intervention as it is implemented in the real world.  
14.2.4 Whenever appropriate, the participants will b e provided with additional pertinent 
information after participation :  
Upon the study’s conclusion, results and publications will be provided by the research team to the NH administrators and providers, as well as proxies of residents with advanced dementi a, as 
requested.  
14.3 Participant Confidentiality  
This trial has been granted a HIPAA Waiver of Requirement for Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information for Research Purposes from the Hebrew Senior Life IRB.   In order 
to preserve confidentia lity, subjects will be assigned a study number known only to the RAs PDs 
and site champions . All physical documentation and IT assets are stored in a locked areas within 
the participating NHs and within  HSL, monitored 24- hours a day by security personnel, and 
accessible only by authorized employees. Access to the HSL cooperate computer network is strictly prohibited and all electronic research data will be stored on dedicated IFAR systems located on our private network. Access to these data will be limited to study personnel on a “need to know” basis. If a NH resident is deemed ineligible for the study, all personal health information obtained for screening purposes will be destroyed as soon as possible. 
15 STUDY DISCONTINUATIO N  
The study may be discontinued at any time by the IRB, the NIA, the OHRP, the FDA, or other 
government agencies as part of their duties to ensure that research participants are protected.  
16 ETHICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
Ethical consideration for the PROVEN trial will be in  accordanc e with the Federal Policy for the 
Protection of Human Subjects (HHS Human Subjects Research 45 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 46).

 1  STUDY SYNOPSIS  
 
Study T itle A Prospective, Multi -Center, Evaluator -Blinded Study Evaluating the Safety 
and Eff ectiveness  of the Renuvion APR Device  to Improve the Appearance 
of Lax Tissue in the Neck and Submental Region  
 
Study Device  Renuvion APR handpiece  
Note: For marketing reaso ns that do not affect the safety and effectiveness of 
the device, we have updated the name from Apyx Plasma/RF to Renuvion 
APR handpiece. (APR stands for Apyx Plasma/RF).  
 
Study 
Population  The study population will consist of males and females, 35-65 years of age  
(inclusive) , who desire a procedure to improve the appearance of lax  tissue 
in the neck and submental region  and meet the eligibility criteria of the study.   
 
Study  
Purpose  The purpose  of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the 
Renuvion APR Device  to improve the appearance of lax tissue in the neck 
and submental  region . 
 
Study Design  
 This is a prospective, multi -center,  multi -phase, evaluator -blinded study of 
subjects undergoing a procedure to improve the appearance of lax tissue  in 
the neck and submental region .  The study will be conducted at up to 8 
investigational centers in the United States.  All study subject s will be treated 
with the Renuvion APR handpieces .  Follow -up visits will occur 1 day, 7 
days, 14 days, 30 days , 90 days , and 180 days  post-procedure .  
 
Phase I (n=17)  of this study was conducted and provided to the FDA as an 
interim safety report of safety  data including information related to adverse 
events followed through resolution for all subjects.  Phase I of this study was 
conducted prior to Revision 9 of this protocol.  
 
Phase II (n=65)  of this study will be conducted as the pivotal study to 
demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the Renuvion APR Device to 
improve the appearance of lax tissue in the neck and submental region.  Phase 
II of the study begins with Revision 9 of this pro tocol.  
 
Study 
Endpoint s  
 Primary Eff ectiveness  Endpoint is improvement in the appearance of lax  
tissue in the  neck and submental region at 180 days compared to baseline  as 
determined by qualitative 2D photography assessment by blinded 
Independent Photographic Reviewers .   
 
Three experienced, blinded photographic reviewers will perform a qualitative 
analysis/review of the pre -treatment and post -treatment sets of images of  
each subject in a blinded and randomized order. Each blinded reviewer will 
choose which image is the post -treatment image. Success will be correct post -

 treatment image selection by at least 2 of the 3 reviewers.   The percentage of 
subjects with a correct post-treatment image selection will be calculated.  
 
The study design and sample size calculation assumes a 75% success rate of 
subjects with correctly identified 180-day images (i.e. 180-day images 
correctly identified by 2 out of 3 blinded Independent Photographic 
Reviewers) and the lower confidence interval greater than the performance 
goal of 55% (calculated with a one -side alpha of 0.025 and 90% power ).  
 
Primary Safety  Endpoint   
The prim ary safety endpoint is the level of pain and discomfort after 
treatment as reported by the subject on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) 
through the 7-day follow -up visit.   
 
Additional  
Endpoints   • The improvement in the appearance of lax tissue in th e neck and 
submental region at 90 days compared to baseline as determined by 
qualitative 2D photography assessment by blinded Independent 
Photographic Reviewers.   
• Subject Modified Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) at 90-day 
and 180-day FUV.  
• Investigator Modified GAIS at 90-day and 180-day FUV.  
• Subject satisfaction with procedure recorded at the 180-day visit.  
• Quantitative i mprovement in overall lift of the neck and submental area 
at 180-days as determined by quantitative assessment based on 2D 
photography.  
o The analysis will compare the population of subjects who respond 
to treatment by achieving at least 20 mm2 of lift of the submental 
region.  Responders will be determined based on change fr om 
baseline of area as measured by 2D photography in standard 
lighting conditions.   
o For the quantitative assessment, fixed landmarks on the subject’s 
face will be used to systematically place a horizontal line, 
including the point where the chin meets the  neck and 35 mm 
beyond.  At this point, a vertical line will be placed and the area 
of submental skin between the two lines will be calculated. An 
area reduction of more than 20 mm2 will be considered to be an 
improvement.  
• Quantitative improvement in subme ntal volume at 180 days  as 
determined by quantitative assessment based on 3D photography.  
• The evaluation of adverse events up to the 180 -day visit following 
treatment.  
• The evaluation of pain scores through the 30 -day follow -up visit as 
reported by the subject on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS).

 3  INTRODUCTION  
3.1 Study Background and Rationale   
Energy has been applied in some form to tissue since the beginning of recorded history.  The 
practice of applying heat to tissue through the use of cauter ies was used for thousands of years as 
an invaluable method of controlling hemorrhage.  Continuous imp rovement of methods for 
utilizing the beneficial effects of heat on tissue eventually led to the development of the basic 
concepts of electrosurgery we know today.  In October of 1926, Dr. Harvey Cushing used an 
electrosurgical unit developed by Dr. Willia m T. Bovie to successfully remove a highly 
vascularized brain tumor from a patient after previous failed attempts.  Today, electrosurgical 
instruments are used in almost every surgical procedure performed worldwide.1 
 
Through this long history, the heat ef fects of the radiofrequency (RF) alternating current used in 
electrosurgery on cells and tissue have been well established.  Normal body temperature is 37 °C 
and, with normal illness, can increase to 40 °C without permanent impact or damage to the cells 
of our body.  However, when the temperature of cells in tissue reaches 50 °C, cell death occurs in 
approximately 6 minutes .2  When the temperature of cells in tissue reaches 60 °C, cell death occurs 
instantaneously .3  Between the temperatures of 60 °C and just b elow 100 °C, two simultaneous 
processes occur .1  The first is protein denaturation leading to coagulation which will be discussed 
in more detail below.  The second is desiccation or dehydration as the cells lose water through 
the thermally damaged cellular wall.  As temperatures rise above 100 °C, intracellular water turns 
to steam , and tissue cells begin to vaporize as a result of the massive intracellular expansion that 
occurs.  Finally, at temperatures of 200 °C or more, organic molecules are broken down in to a 
process called carbonization.  This leaves behind carbon molecules that give a black and/or brown 
appearance to the tissue.  
 
Understanding these heat effects of RF energy on cells and tissue can allow the predictable 
changes to be used to accomplish b eneficial therapeutic results.  Protein denaturation leading to 
soft tissue coagulation is one of the most versatile and widely utilized tissue effects.  Protein 
denaturation is the process in which hydrothermal bonds (crosslinks) between protein molecules , 
such as collagen, are instantaneously broken and then quickly reformed as tissue cools.  This 
process leads to the formation of uniform clumps of protein typically called coagulum through a 
subsequent process known as coagulation.  In the process of coag ulation, cellular proteins are 
altered but not destroyed and form protein bonds that create homogenous, gelatinous structures.  
The resulting tissue effect of coagulation is extremely useful and most commonly used for 
occluding blood vessels and causing he mostasis.  
 
In addition to causing hemostasis, coagulation results in predictable contraction of soft tissue.  
Collagen is one of the main proteins found in human skin and connective tissue.  The 
coagulation/denaturation temperature of collagen is conventio nally stated to be 66.8 °C, although 
this can vary for different tissue types .4  Once denatured, collagen rapidly contracts as fibers 
shrink to one -third of their overall length .5  This principal of thermally -induced contraction of 
collagen through denatura tion and coagulation of soft tissue is well known in medicine and is 
used to achieve beneficial results in ophthalmology, orthopedic applications, and the treatment of 
varicose veins.  Once tissue is heated to the appropriate temperature, protein denaturat ion and 
collagen contraction occur resulting in a reduction of volume and surface area of the heated tissue.

 Noninvasive use of RF devices, lasers, and plasma devices have been used for the reduction of 
facial wrinkles and rhytides caused by thermal -induc ed collagen/tissue contraction since the mid -
1990s .6-11 
 
Recently, the use of thermal -induced collagen/tissue contraction has been expanded to minimally 
invasive procedures.  Laser -assisted lipolysis (LAL) and radiofrequency -assisted lipolysis 
(RFAL) devic es have combined the removal of subcutaneous fat with soft tissue heating to reduce 
the skin laxity that often results from fat volume removal.  These devices are placed in the same 
subcutaneous tissue plane as a standard suction -assisted lipolysis (SAL) c annula and are used to 
deliver thermal energy to coagulate the subcutaneous tissue including the underside of the dermis, 
the fascia, and the septal connective tissue.  The coagulation of the subcutaneous tissue results in 
collagen/tissue contraction that reduces skin laxity.   
 
Apyx Medical Corporation’s  product family of helium -based plasma technology  (Renuvion/J -
Plasma family of devices)  has FDA clearance for the cutting, coagulation, and ablation of soft 
tissue.  The Renuvion APR  Handpiece is a new device designed to be a part of this helium -based 
plasma technology family. All devices in the product family are a part of a system that consists 
of an electrosurgical generator unit, a handpiece, and a supply of helium gas.  RF energy is 
delivered to the handpiece by the generator and used to energize an electrode.  When helium gas 
is passed over the energized electrode, a helium plasma is ge nerated which allows heat to be 
applied to tissue in two different and distinct ways.  First, heat is generated by the actual 
production of the plasma beam itself through the ionization and rapid neutralization of the helium 
atoms.  Second, since plasmas a re very good electrical conductors, a portion of the RF energy 
used to energize the electrode and generate the plasma passes from the electrode to the patient 
and heats tissue by passing current through the resistance of the tissue, a process known as Joul e 
heating.  These two sources of tissue heating give the Renuvion APR  device some advantages 
during use as a surgical tool for the coagulation  and contraction  of subcutaneous soft tissue.   
 
Apyx Medical Corporation has developed a new product offering to add to the product family of 
helium -based plasma technology, the Renuvion APR  Handpiece , that delivers RF energy in a 
controlled fashion  that results in soft tissue co agulation  and contraction  within the fibroseptal 
network (FSN). This helium -based plasma device has technological features that result in a n 
effective method of action for coagulation  and contraction  of soft tissue.  These features  and 
benefits  are as follows:  
1. The Renuvion APR  Handpiece device achieves soft tissue coagulation  and contra ction  by 
rapidly heating the treatment site to temperatures greater than 85°C for between 0.040 and 
0.080 seconds.   
2. The tissue surrounding the treatment site remains at much cooler temperatures resulting 
in rapid cooling after the application of the energ y through conductive heat transfer.   
3. Focused delivery of energy on immediate heating of the fibroseptal network resulting in 
immediate soft tissue coagulation  and contraction  without unnecessarily heating the full 
thickness of the dermis.  
4. 360° tissue trea tment without the need for the user to redirect the flow of energy due to 
electrical energy taking the path of least resistance.  
5. Unencumbered delivery of power regardless of the tissue impedance due to the unique 
power output from the electrosurgical gener ator.

 6. Low current RF energy resulting in minimal depth of thermal effect and prevention of 
over-treating tissue when performing multiple passes.  
3.2 Study Device Description  
The Renuvion APR  system consists of a  handpiece  (Figure 1 ), an electrosurgical unit  (ESU, 
Figure 2) , and a supply of helium gas  (Figure 2) .  RF energy is delivered to the handpiece by the 
ESU and used to energize an electrode.  When helium gas is passed over the energized electrode, 
a helium plasma is generated which allows for conduction of the RF energy from the electrode to 
the subject  in the form of a precise helium plasma beam.

 4  STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Study Purpose  
The purpose  of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of  the Renuvion APR  device  
to improv e the appearance of lax tissue in the neck and submental region .  
4.2 Study Design  
This is a prospective, multi -center, evaluator -blinded study of subjects undergoing a procedure to 
improve the appearance of lax tissue  in the neck and submental region .  The study will be 
conducted at up to 8 investigational centers in the United States , with a maximum of 20 st udy 
subjects enrolled at each site .  All study subjects will be treated with the Renuvion APR  device.  
Follow -up will occur 1 day, 7 days , 14 days, 30 days, 90 days , and 180 days  post-procedure.     
 
Subjects will have the informed consent administered prior to performing any study related 
assessments.  Only subjects who sign the informed consent will have the screening assess ments 
performed.  
 
Phase II s tudy enrollment is expected to occur over 6-8 months. Imaging and study assessments 
will be conducted at each follow -up visit. Total Phase II study duration is expected to be 
approximately 14 months.  After all subjects have completed their 180-day visit, the study will 
be considered complete, the fi nal results will be determined, and a final report will be prepared.  
4.3 Study  Objectives and  Endpoints  
The following endpoints will be assessed in this study .  
4.3.1  Primary Effectiveness   
The primary effectiveness  endpoint is improvement in the appearance of lax tissue in the neck 
and submental region at 180-days as determined by qualitative 2D photography assessment by 
blinded Independent Photographic Reviewers.   
 
The primary effectiveness objective is to demonst rate that the proportion of successful subjects 
exceeds the performance goal (PG).  
 
Ho:  P < PG   vs   Ha:  P > PG  
 
Where P is the proportion of successful subjects and PG is the performance goal.  
 
Three experienced, blinded photographic reviewers will pe rform a qualitative analysis/review of 
the pre -treatment and post -treatment sets of images of each subject in a blinded and randomized 
order. Each blinded reviewer will choose which image is the post -treatment image. Success will 
be correct post -treatment image selection by at least 2 of the 3 reviewers.  The percentage of 
subjects with a correct post -treatment image selection will be calculated.

 The study design and sample size calculation assumes a 75% success rate of subjects with 
correctly identified 180-day images (i.e. 180-day images correctly identified by 2 out of 3 blinded 
Independent Photographic Reviewers) and the lower confidence interval greater than the 
performance goal of 55% (calculated with a one -side alpha of 0.025  and 90% power ).  
4.3.2  Primary Safety  
The primary safety endpoint is the level of pain and discomfort after treatment as reported by the 
subject on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) through the 7-day follow -up visit (see Section 7.5 ). 
 
The primary safety objective is to demonstrate that the proport ion of subjects with none -to-
moderate pain exceeds the performance goal (PG).  
 
Ho:  P < PG   vs   Ha:  P > PG  
 
Where P is the proportion of subjects with acceptable pain and PG is the performance goal.  
 
The performance goal is 55%. The null hypothesis tes t is that Renuvion APR  results in fewer than 
55% of subjects with maximal pain of “moderate” (NRS pain score of 7 or less) post-procedure  
and at the 1 -day and 7 -day follow -up visits  (i.e., more than 45% have severe pain).  The alternative 
is that more than 55% of subjects have moderate or less pain  (NRS pain score of 7 or less) 
immediately post -procedure and at the 1 -day and 7 -day follow -up visits , and fewer than 45% have 
severe pain . 
4.3.3 Additional E ndpoints  
Other endpoints to be evaluated include:  
 
1. The improvement in the appearance of lax tissue in the neck and submental region at 90 
days compared to baseline as determined by qualitative 2D photography assessment by 
blinded Indepe ndent Photographic Reviewers.   
2. Subject Modified Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) at 90-day and 180-day 
FUV.  
3. Investigator Modified GAIS at 90-day and 180-day FUV.  
4. Subject satisfaction with procedure recorded at the 180-day visit.  
5. Quantitative i mprovement in overall lift of the submental area at 180 days  as determined  
by quantitative assessment based on 2D photography.  
• The analysis will compare the population of subjects who respond to treatment by 
achieving at least 20 mm2 of lift of the submental region.  Responders will be 
determined based on change from baseline of  area as measured by 2D photography 
in standard lighting conditions.   
• For the quantitative assessment, fixed landmarks on the subject’s face will be used 
to systematically place a horizontal line, including the point where the chin meets 
the neck and 35 mm beyond.  At this point, a vertical line will be placed and the 
area of submental skin between the two lines will be calculated. An area reduction 
of more than 20 mm2 will be considered to be an improvement.  
6. Quantitative improvement in submental volume a t 180 days  as determined by quantitative 
assessment based on 3D photography.

 7. The evaluation of adverse events up to the 180 -day visit following treatment.  
8. The evaluation of pain scores through the 30 -day follow -up visit as reported by the subject 
on a Nume ric Rating Scale (NRS).

6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Informed Consent  
The Investigator must ensure that written informed consent to participate in the study and written 
authorization for use and disclosure of protected health information i s obtained before including 
any individual as a subject  in the study, and before conducting any study -related assessments. 
The Investigator must provide the prospective subject  with suff icient opportunity to consider 
whether or not to participate and  minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.  
 
To participate  in the study, a subject  must sign and date an IRB -approved consent document.  The 
original, signed documents will be kept with the subject s’ files and copies will be provided to the 
subject s. The informed consent process must be followed, and the subject’s participation in the 
study, must be documented in the subject’s medical record/chart.  
6.2 Pre-Procedure  
Study  subject s will have verification of eligibility criteria, a brief general examin ation including 
medical history,  and pre-procedure  assessments as detailed below  completed within 30 days prior 
to undergoing the study procedure. In response to the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID -19) 
pandemic, preoperative testing can be completed at the Investigator’s discretion.  Pre -operative 
testing should be performed as clos e to the scheduled study procedure as feasible, but in time to 
get the results. Up to t wo urine pregnancy test s must be obtained prior to study procedure for 
females with child -bearing potential  (one at pre-procedure screening and one on the day of the 
procedure  prior to the procedure  if pre-procedure screening and procedure are not performed on 
the same day ).  
 
The following p re-treatment  assessments will be performed:   
• 2D/3D photographic images will be captured.  The same standardized photography 
views wi ll be used throughout the study as documented in the image capture document 
developed for the study. In addition to the standardized photography views, the 
baseline 2D/3D photographic images will include an image of the subject performing 
a grimace to allo w for determination of subject eligibility related to the platysmal 
banding exclusion criteria.  Table 1  illustrates study procedures that will occur at each 
visit.   
• Urine pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential) . 
• General physical exam including medical history, vital signs, collection of patient 
demographic information, and BMI . 
 
Medications subject  is taking  upon entry into the study should also be documented in the Case 
Report Forms ( CRF ). Documentation  should include medications that  study subject s take on an 
Renuvion APR  Device  Neck and Submental Region  Study, VP-1902, Rev. No. 9.2        December 16, 2020

 elective basis  in addition to prescribed medications . Medication used for analgesia and/or 
anesthesia should  be recorded as concomitant medication as well. To ensure the capture of the 
foregoing  information on pre -existing condit ions, sites should also be attentive to the need to  
document without limitation and whenever discovered: (1) all chronic, episodic or ‘as  needed’ 
medications used before study enrollment; (2) prior episodic or ‘as needed’  therapeutic 
interventions, procedu res or hospitalizations; and, (3) recent or planned  surgical procedures.   
Medications at investigator discretion may be provided as follows:  
• Optional Pre -Procedure:  
o Antibiotics: Keflex 500mg BID (first dose just prior, within 60 minutes, to 
procedure) x 7 days. Alternative, Z -pack.  
6.3 Study Procedure  
On the day of the procedure and prior to  the study procedure, female subjects  with child -bearing 
potential  must complete a urine pregnancy test (result must be obtained prior to the procedure).   
Medications at investigator discretion may be provided as follows:  
• Optional for Procedure (given within 90  minutes prior to procedure):  
o Ativan 2mg or Valium 10 -20mg  
o Norco 5 -10mg , Hydrocodone 5 -10mg, or Ultram 200mg  
 
A responsible driver (friend  or family member) is required if these medications are prescribed.  
 
During the study procedure , subjects will be treated with  the Renuvion APR  device  according to 
the product  IFUs and procedures described in this section  of the protocol . The bilateral treatment 
area includes the tissue of the neck ( to the posterior border of the  sternocleidomastoid muscle) 
and submental area . Treatment will be performed through three (3) incisions (2 periauricular and 
1 submental) with each incision large enough to allow for gas egress, see Figure 1 . Each incision 
site will be anesthetized with 1 % or 2% Lidocaine with Epinephrine (1:100,000) prior to incision 
being made.

Figure 1: Treatment incisions (2 periauricular and 1 submental).  
The treatment area will be infused with  standard of care tumescent solution  referr ed to as a Klein 
solution. The solution consists of 1% or 2% Lidocaine (Plain) to make a 0.2% concentration 
(double Klein ) and Epinephrine 1mg/1ml (1:1, 000) and optional Sodium Bicarbonate 8.4% added 
to Normal Saline or Lactated Ringers. Infuse area with 150-250cc or until the area is taut . To 
prevent lidocaine toxicity, 35-55mg/kg should not be exceeded16.  
Once infused with Klein solution, undermining of the tissue  in the area to be treated will be 
performed using a cannula 3-4mm in diameter .  No energy (i.e. radiofrequency, ultra -sound, or 
laser energy) or suction will be used during the undermining  of the tissue.   
After undermining, t he Renuvion APR  device  treatment  will be p erformed using 4-6 treatment 
passes with settings of 70% power and 1.5 LPM of helium flow  with an activation speed of 
approximately 1 -3 cm/s .  Prior to performing treatment through each one of the three (3) incisions, 
the investigator will evaluate activation speed by performing the following steps  in the sterile 
field at a safe distance from the subject :  
1. Using a sterile ruler, two parallel lines will be drawn in the sterile field that are 10cm 
apart.  
2. The investigator will place the tip of the device on one of the lines and simulate the 
activation speed until the tip reaches the second parallel line.  
3. While the investigator performs this simulation, an assistant will measure the amount of 
time it takes for the tip of the device to travel from one  line to the other using a stopwatch

 or timer.   The measured time must be between 3.3 seconds and 10 seconds inclusive to 
correspond to an activation speed of 1 -3 cm/s.   The investigator will repeat the simulation 
until the measured time falls within this range.   The final measured simulation time will 
be recorded in the Procedure CRF for  each incision site to provide evaluation of the 
activation speed at the beginning, middle, and end of the procedure.  
6.4 Follow -up Procedures  
6.4.1 Immediately Post -Proced ure  
Following treatment with the Renuvion APR  device, surveillance aspiration and manual 
expression will be performed to evacuate any excess helium gas and/or residual fluid in the 
treatment area . Surveillance aspiration will be performed using  a 10cc locking syringe and a 
2.5mm or smaller single hole cannula . Aspiration amount will be limited to 8cc maximum .  
 
Following the procedure, the research staff and the subject will care for the treated areas using 
the Post -Procedure Care Instructions  listed below  and the following optional medications  at 
investigator discretion may be provided as follows:  
• Optional Post -Procedure  
o Norco 5 -10mg , Hydrocodone 5 -10mg, or Ultram 200mg  
o Tylenol (OTC) as needed  
6.4.2 Post-Procedure Care Instructions  
The subject will receive a printed copy of the Take -Home P ost-Procedure Care Instructions , see 
Appendix C.  
 
Compression Garment Instructions : 
The investigator or directed staff will place a Velcro chin -strap  neck compression garment on the 
subject prior to the subject departing the site.  Subjects will be directed  to wear the compression 
garment as follows:   
 
• Days 0 -3: Wear the neck compression garment for 22 hours per day, removing only for 
showering/bathing.  
• Days 4-21: Wear the neck compression garment at night . 
Additional Instructions:  
Subjects will be instructed to:  
• Complete Subject Diary daily through your 14 -Day Fo llow-up Visit.  
• Report any treatment effects by noting them in the Subject Diary.  
• Call the investigator or study staff if you have a complication outside of the Expected 
Treatment Effects listed in the Subject Diary.  
• Bring your Subject Diary in with you to  each visit, through the 14 -Day Follow -up Visit 
when you will turn the Subject Diary into study staff.  
• Continue to keep your study doctor and/or study staff aware of any new complications 
you may experience beyond the 14 -Day Follow -up Visit.

 6.4.2. Follow -up Visits  & Subject Contact outside of Follow -up Visits  
Subjects will be asked to return to the study site at the following times post -procedure:  
• 1 (+2) day  
• 7 (±1) days  
• 14 (±3) days  
• 30 (±7) days  
• 90 (±10) days  
• 180 (±15) days  
 
Post-procedure assessments and 2D/3D photographic imaging will be performed during the 
follow -up visits. The same standardized photography views will be used throughout the study as 
documented in the image capture document developed for the study. Table 1  illustrates study 
procedures that will occur at each visit.  
 
Due to the challenges of COVID -19, if a subject is unable to return to the office for an in -person 
visit, follow -up visits will be conducted virtually. If a visit is completed virtually, missing  
assessments such as photographs will be documented as a protocol deviation specifically noting 
COVID -19. Outside of photographs, study investigators and study staff will ensure all other 
assessments  related to each follow -up visit  are completed virtually  if the visit is done virtually . 
For virtual visits, the investigator and/or study staff completing the visit and assessments will be 
identified on the case report form; as well, the manner in which the visit was completed will also 
be marked on the Case Re port Form  (i.e. video call, phone call, etc.). Virtual visits should be done 
via video call if possible, to ensure subject identi ty. If a telephone call must be done, the 
investigator and/or study staff must positively identify the subject prior to conduct ing the virtual 
visit by requesting the subject to state their address  and date of birth. Subjects will be strongly 
encouraged to come in (albeit safely) for their D180 visit; this visit is vitally important as this is 
the primary endpoint and photographic  images are needed for many of the assessments.  Only 
investigators and study staff who have been trained and delegated to conduct virtual visits as 
indicated on the delegation log may conduct virtual study visits.  
 
Subjects  may be seen for an unscheduled appointment at any time at investigator’s discretion . 
Study staff will contact (phone, text, email, video call at subject’s preference) all subjects with 
ongoing Adverse Events at the following time points , as applicable:  
• 21 (±5) days  
• 45 (±5) days  
• 60 (±5) days  
• 75 (±5) days  
• 105 (±5) days  
• 120 (±5) days  
• 135 (±5) days  
• 150 (±5) days  
• 165 (±5) days  
 
If the subject is unreachable by the preferred method of contact, another method of contact may 
be attempted. Three attempts will be made to contac t the subject before considering the subject 
contact visit missed and protocol deviation recorded.

 7 EVALUATION TOOLS  
The following evaluation tools will be used in this study:  
7.1 2-Dimentional and 3 -Dimensional Photography  
Two-dimensional (2D) photographic images will be  extracted from three -dimensional (3D) 
images which are  captured utilizing the Canfield Scientific, Inc. Vectra M4 Plus 3D imaging  
system.  The same standardized ph otography views will be used throughout the study as 
documented in the Image Capture document developed by Canfield for the study.  Images will be 
monitored for quality to ensure standardized images and subject alignment between baseline and 
follow -up visit s. If the Canfield image monitoring team notes differences in head position /tilt or 
noncompliance with study requirements (headband, tank  top, no makeup, no facial expressions, 
no jewelry) , a reshoot will be requested and noted in the Photography Result Re port provided by 
Canfield. Study staff should review photos with particular care during each visit to ensure 
consistent alignment  to prevent having to bring the subject back for a reshoot. If a reshoot is 
required, the reshoot should be taken within the vi sit window.  Study staff should review 
Photography Result Reports (provided within 48 hours of image upload) for all images taken to 
check for reshoot requests.   
7.1.1 Independent Photographic Assessments  (Primary Effectiveness Endpoint)  
Three experienced, blinded photographic reviewers will perform a qualitative analysis/review of 
the pre -treatment and post -treatment sets of images of each subject in a blinded and randomized 
order. Each blinded reviewer will choose which image is the post -treatment image. Success will 
be correct post -treatment image selection by at least 2  out of 3 reviewers.   The percentage of 
subjects with a correct post -treatment image selection will be calculated.  
 
Assessment of each subject’s baseline and follow -up images v iewed simultaneously will be 
performed by the Independent Photographic Reviewers (IPR) who will be blinded to the study 
subject’s visit (baseline and follow -up visit).  Each IPR will view each subject’s randomized pre-
treatment and post-treatment  images an d assess which set of images represent the subject’s post -
treatment images. Each photograph will have a unique identification number, but the sets of 
images will not be arranged in any specific order (i.e., randomized order).  Canfield will prepare 
and admi nister the IPR.  
 
7.1.1.1 Independent Photographic Review Evaluation Process:  
1. Each blinded assessor will be provided with identical photos to be assessed.  The pre -
treatment and post-treatment  photos will be consistent in lighting, subject positioning , and 
focus.  Each photo’s visit interval, i.e., pre -treatment and post-treatment , will NOT be 
marked. The images placement (right or left) will be randomly ordered for pre -treatment 
and post-treatment  images. Images for each subject will be grouped together into one set 
with all pre -treatment and post-treatment  images in the same loca tion (right/left) for the 
subject set.  
2. Each blinded assessor will conduct their assessment independently with no input from 
another b linded assessor.  
3. Each blinded assessor compares the Lef t and Right photo for change  that may be striking 
(substantial and i mmediately noticeable) , readily apparent but modest in nature, or sli ght 
and subtle in nature that may require close examination. Assessors should look through 
Renuvion APR  Device  Neck and Submental Region  Study, VP-1902, Rev. No. 9.2        December 16, 2020  
 
Confidential    Page 26 of 54 
 
 each view and assess change.  Enough time should be allowed to do this for each subject, 
so the assessments are not rushed.  
4. The assessor chooses which photo they believe to be the post-treatment photo (i.e., Left 
photo or Right photo) once all images in the subject set have been reviewed.  
5. Post-Analysis Coding of Masked Assessment:  
• If the assessor incorrectly chooses the post-treatment photo, this will be coded as 
an “Incorrect post -treatment selection”.  
• If the assessor correctly chooses the post-treatment photo, this will be coded as a 
“Correct post -treatment selection”.  
6. Success wil l be determined by correct identification of post -treatment photographs by at 
least two out of three blinded, independent reviewers.  
 
7.1.1.2 Independent Photographic Review Training Process:  
IPR assessors will participate in a training session prior to completing the IPR. The purpose of 
the training is to provide guidance to the IPR assessor s on the methods for reviewing the study 
images and to provide sample images from the Phase I safety stu dy for scoring and discussion of 
the scoring by IPR assessors. Instructions will include that each blinded assessor should pay close 
attention to changes in:  
• Fullness of neck  
• Neck lines  
• Neck muscle definition  
• Jawline definition  
• Submental laxity  
• Mandibular angle  
• Jowling  
• Marionette  lines 
• Overall appearance  of the treatment area  
IPR assessors will complete a 10 -subject mock IPR using images from the Phase I safety study 
to determine comprehension of the training or need for additional training. The IPR training 
presentation , 10-subject mock IPR , and mock IPR response instructions/response form are 
provided as three separate stand -alone documents.  
7.1.2 Quantitative Assessment of Lift ( Additional  Endpoint)  
The right profile view of extracted 2D images will be analyzed by Canfield software using marks 
at the lateral canthus of the eye, anterior nostril margin, and the chin attachment point of the neck 
to allow for the analysis of submental area as shown in re d in the image below, see Figure 2. The 
analysis will compare the population of subjects who respond to treatment by achieving at least 
20 mm2 of lift of the submental region.  Responders will be determined based on change from 
baseline of area as measured  by 2D photography in standard lighting conditions.  An area 
reduction of more than 20 mm2 will be considered to be an improvement.

Figure 2: Quantitative Assessment of Submental Area  
7.1.3 Quantitative Assessment of Volume ( Additional  Endpoint)  
A series of anatomically defined landmarks on the baseline 3D image will define the submental 
area of interest for the volume difference measurement, see Figure 3. The landmarks will be 
transposed based on surface tracking to the correspo nding follow -up image. The Canfield analysis 
software will reference the landmarks and create a volume difference model within the area of 
interest and report measurements of positive, negative, and total volume change.

 7.2 Modified Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS)  (Additional Endpoint)  
The Modified Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) is a subjective rating of improvement 
in treatment results compared to pre -treatment.  The Investigator will grade  the overall 
improvement of treatment area  as indicated in Table 2 by comparing the subject ’s appearance at 
follow -up visits against a photograph taken prior to procedure .  Likewise, the subject  will also 
rate their improvement compared to pre -treatment  as shown in Table 3.   
 
The modified GAIS results will be collected at the 90 -day and 180 -day follow -up visits .

 7.4 Subject Diary  
Study subjects will be asked to complete a daily diary (see Appendix B) starting from the 
procedure date (after study procedure, at home) until the 14-day follow -up visit to complete daily 
11-point NRS  pain assessments and document any complications they h ave experienced.  
7.5 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) (Primary Safety Endpoint)  
The s tudy subject s will be asked to complete a 1 1-point Numeric Rating Scale  (NRS ) for the level 
of pain and discomfort associated with the study procedure  – to be completed by the subject s on 
the day of the procedure prior to  the procedure , following the procedure,  and at all follow -up 
visits.  The average pain score for the entire region treated will be recorded. Directions to subject  
will be : “Please rate the average pain you are experiencing in the treatment area on a scale of 0 -
10, with 0 being ‘ Best/ No Pain’ and 10 being the ‘Worst Possible Pain’ .” 
 
 
Pain will be defined in this study as the average pain reported in the treatment area using the 
following categories: None (Score of 0), Mild (Score of 1 -5), Moderate (Score of 6-7), and Severe 
(Score of 8-10). Classifications of NRS pain scores have been documented in literature20.  
Moderate and severe pain/discomfort are considered Adverse Events ( AE). Severe subject 
reported pain does not necessarily correlate to a “severe” adverse event classification. Events will 
be classified by investigator based on clinical evaluation, the effect to daily activities, and 
mitigation needed as per Section 8.6  of this protocol.  
 
Subjects experiencing pain adverse events will be considered resolved when their pain score is 
documented as returning to a 0 score.  
7.6 Adverse Event Reporting  
The definitions of Adverse Events (AEs) and the subtypes are provided in Section 8  of the  
study protocol.  Adverse events will be classified by the investigator as to:  
• Anticipated vs unanticipated  
• Serious vs not seriou s 
• Expected Treatment Effect (ETE) vs Adverse Event (AE)  
• Severity:  mild, moderate, severe  
• Device causality:  not related, related, undetermined  
• Procedure causality:  not related, related, undetermined.  
7.7 TEN Testing of Sensory Nerves  
Compares sensation in injured/non -injured areas in response to light -moving touch where 10/10 
is normal and 0/10 is no sensation. TEN Testing will be performed as follows : 
• Light moving touch (examiner’s finger) is applied to the area to be tested as well as to 
an area of normal sensation (such as arm).  
• The subject is asked to rate  the best level of sensation they feel in the test area.

Confidential    Page 30 of 54 
 
 • Ten is normal sensation, diminished sensation is rated on a scale of 0 -10, with 0 being 
no sensation, 5 being half of normal, 10 being full sensation.  
 
Subjects experiencing sensory nerve adverse eve nts will be considered resolved when their T EN 
Testing score is documented as returning to a 10/10 score.  
7.8 Examination of Facial Motor Nerves  
Observe:  
1. Face at rest for any facial asymmetry not apparent at baseline.  
2. Any facial tics, asymmetry of eye blinking or eye closure  
3. During smiling  
 
In Palsy:  
1. Blink: The eyelid on the affected side closes just a trace later than the opposite 
eyelid.  
2. Nasolabial folds: The weaker one is flatter.  
3. Mouth: The affected side droops and participates manifestly less in speaking.  
 
Subjects experiencing motor nerve adverse events will be considered resolved when their motor 
nerve assessment returns to baseline observations by study investigator.  
7.9 Burn Depth  Assessment (Burn Adverse Events Only)  
Burn depth assessment may be difficult, Table 4  aids in accurate estimation of burn depth, should 
a burn adverse event be reported. Suspicion of deep partial thickness or full thickness burns 
warrants notification of study Sponsor .

8  ADVERSE EVENTS ASSESSMENT  REPORTING  
8.1 Adverse Events Evaluation  
Safety evaluations for this study include an interview with the study subject  at each follow -up 
visit by the  Investigator or Research Coordina tor to elicit information about any medical 
occurrence that meets the definition of Adverse Event. Th is information will be  documented in 
CRF without regard for cause or relation to device and/or procedure.  
 
In addition, study subject s will be instructed in the Informed Consent Form, post -procedure take -
home instructions, and verbally  by study staff  to report all complications experienced post study 
procedure to the site personnel as soon as they occur/ are observed.  Study staff will ensure that 
monitoring and management of all adverse events is prioritized. To ensure this, study staff will 
contact (phone, text, email, video call at subject’s preference) all subjects with ongoing Adverse 
Events at the following time p oints , as applicable : 
• 21 (±5) days  
• 45 (±5) days  
• 60 (±5) days  
• 75 (±5) days  
• 105 (±5) days  
• 120 (±5) days  
• 135 (±5) days  
• 150 (±5) days  
• 165 (±5) days  
Three attempts will be made to contact the subject before considering the subject contact visit 
missed and proto col deviation recorded.  If subjects are unable to be contacted via their preferred 
method of contact, another method of contact may be utilized.  
 
Subjects may be asked to come into the site at any time to assess adverse events.  
 
Study investigators are pr ovided liberty to mitigate adverse events as deemed necessary per IHC 
GCP Guidelines E6(R2)4.3.2 which states “During and following a subject’s participation in a 
trial, the investigator/institution should ensure that adequate medical care is provided to a  subject 
for any adverse events related to the trial”.  
 
Adverse event resolution dates will be determined by investigator using either in -person or remote  
(phone, video call,  text, email , etc.) examinations or communication with the subject.  To ensure 
the most accurate reporting of adverse event durations, investigators are instructed not to wait 
until scheduled office follow -up visits to assess resolution.  
 
It is the Investigator’ s responsibility to determine seriousness, severity, and relatedness of the 
Adverse Event to the device and procedure using the definitions below.  
Renuvion APR  Device  Neck and Submental Region  Study, VP-1902, Rev. No. 9.2        December 16, 2020

 8.2 Adverse Event (AE) Definition  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject , 
including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the subject ’s participation in the research,  
whether or not considered related to the subject ’s participation in the research.  
 
A preexisting condition (one that is present at the start of the study) will be recorded as an AE 
only if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worse ns during the study period.   
Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are reported as an 
AE in the following circumstances:  hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or 
elective surgical procedures fo r a preexisting condition. Surgery should not be reported as an 
outcome of an AE if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was 
uneventful.  
8.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Definition  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is an adverse event that:  
• Led to a death or  
• Led to a serious deterioration in the health of a subject that:  
o Resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury,  
o Resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or body function,  
o Required in -patient  hospitalization or  prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
o Resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent impairment to body 
structure or a body function, or  
o Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.   
 
All SAEs that occur during the study period, whether considered to be related to the study  device  
or not , must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. IRB reporting 
requirements may also apply for SAEs.  
8.4 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADEs) Definition  
An unanticipated adverse device effect  (UADEs)  is defined as any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, 
if that eff ect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with 
a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.   
In addition, any UADEs  will be reported to the Sponsor and the reviewing IRB as soon as 
possible, but no later than within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.   
All adverse events, anticipated or unanticipated, will be monitored until they are adequately 
resolved or explained.    
8.5 Reporting Requirements  
All Adverse Events (AEs) and Expected Treatment Effects (ETEs) obser ved by study subject s, 
investigators,  or other study staff from first exposure to the study product through last study 
follow -up visit w ill be recorded. If a device -related AE, ETE, SAE, or unanticipated serious 
Renuvion APR  Device  Neck and Submental Region  Study, VP-1902, Rev. No. 9.2        December 16, 2020  
 
Confidential    Page 33 of 54 
 
 device related effect is ongoing at the final study visit, the subject  will be followed until 
resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or  the subject  is 
lost to follow -up. The investigator should make every effort to ensure that follow -up includes any 
supplemental investigations as may be indicated to elucidate, as completely as practical, the 
nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. This may include unscheduled follow up visits for AE 
assessment.  
 
Study subject s will be instructed in the ICF, post -treatment take home instructions, and verbally 
by study staff to report all AEs to the clinical study staff.  AE information will be collected 
throughout the duration of the study and  recorded on CRFs. Subjects experiencing ongoing 
adverse events will be contacted as per Section 8.1 .                                                                                                                                                
8.6 Severity of Adverse Events  
The severity of adverse events  will be categorized by investigator based on clinical evaluation, 
the effect to daily activities, and mitigation needed using the following criteria:  
• Mild:  easily tolerated by the subject , causing minimal discomfort and not interfering 
with everyday activities. These events generally do not require treatment.  
• Moderate:  sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.  
These events are usually relieved by simple therapeutic measures.  
• Severe:   prevents normal, everyday activities.  These events may require systemic 
drug therapy or other medical treatment.  
8.7 Relationship  to the Study Device and /or Procedure  
The investigators should differentiate  between device and procedure related AEs by classifying 
events directly attributable to the device itself as “device related”  and events that occur from the 
procedure, irrespective of the device, as “procedure related”.  Since the study device delivers 
helium -based plasma energy to the tissue, events directly attribut able to the application of energy 
to the tissue (i.e. burns) o r the use of helium (i.e. gas buildup) should be  classified as device 
related.  Events that are known to occur in subdermal procedures utilizing tumescent anesthesia 
and/or undermining of soft tissue (i.e. edema17,18, hematoma18,19, nerve injury19, 
pain/te nderness17) without the use of the study device should be classified as procedure related.  
 
The relationship to the study device and /or procedure will be determined by the investigator 
utilizing the following categories:  
 
• Not Related:  An event for which an alternative explanation is conclusively identified 
– e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), and/or the relationship in time 
suggests that a causal relationship is highly unlikely.  
 
• Related : The adverse event follows a reasonable tempor al sequence related to 
treatment by the device  and/or study procedure , follows a known or suspected 
response pattern and a plausible alternative etiology cannot be identified.  
 
• Undetermined : The relation of the adverse event has some temporal relationship  to 
the device  and/or study  procedure , is not clearly due to another condition and the 
involvement of the study device is unknown.

 8.8 Stopping Guidelines / Stopping Rules: Safety  
The Sponsor and/or investigator may recommend termination or modification of the study if there 
is an occurrence of any device - or treatment -related Serious Adverse Event, using the clinical 
protocol definitions of Serious Adverse Event in Section 8.3  of this protocol. In addition, 
termination or modification may be recommended for any other perceived safety concern based 
on clinical judgment, including but not limited to a severe burn (anticipated or unanticipated), a 
higher than anticipated rate for any c omponent of the safety measures, device failures resulting 
in Adverse Events, or unexpected SAEs.  Enrollment and treatment would be suspended during 
root cause investigation to determine the cause of the respective AE.

 9  RISK AND BENEFITS  
9.1 Benefits  
A possible benefit of using the Renuvion APR  device  is the potential for improvement in the 
appearance of lax tissue in the neck and submental  region .   
9.2 Risks  
This treatment modality was designed to inherently minimize the risk to the subject. However, 
treatment with energy -based modalities  (laser, radiofrequency, and plasma devices) produce  
subsequent heating of the soft tissue that could involve the following commonly Expected 
Treatment Effects (ETEs):  discomfort/pain, edema, erythema,  ecchymosis, hypoesthesia, 
temporary sensory nerve injury ( touch sensitivity, itching, temporary numbness/tingling ), 
transient migratory firmness, and temporary and/or  transient c repitus.  
In addition to commonly expected treatment effects, treatment with the Renuvion APR device 
could involve the following risks:  helium embolism into  the surgical site due to inadvertent 
introduction into the venous or arterial  blood supply system, u nintended burns (deep or 
superficial), pneumothorax,  temporary or permanent motor nerve injury , ischemia, fibrosis, 
infection, gas  buildup , bleeding, hematoma, seroma, subcutaneous induration, pigmentation  
changes, increased healing time, unsatisfactory sc arring, asymmetry and/or  unacceptable 
cosmetic result.  
Subject s using drugs that reduce coagulation (aspirin or NSAIDs) may experience increased 
bruising or bleeding at the treatment site.  
A grounding pad is used to ground/neutralize the electrical current . Subjects undergoing 
radiofrequency treatment will be kept away from contact with metal parts which are grounded,  or 
which have appreciable capacitance to earth.  
 
Risks associated with tumescent anesthesia (lidocaine and epinephrine) include blurred vision, 
mental/mood changes, drowsiness, dizziness, unusually slow heartbeat, rash, itching, swelling, 
anxiety, apprehensiveness, restlessness, tremor, weakness, sweating, palpitations, pallor, nausea 
and vomiting, headache, and respiratory difficu lties.  
 
Side effects and subject instructions for medications that are at investigator discretion include:  
• Keflex  
If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly:  
o Diarrhea  
o Nausea  
o Vomiting  
o Upset stomach  
 
This medication may rarely cause a severe intestinal condition due to resistant bacteria. 
This condition may occur during treatment or weeks to months after treatment has 
stopped. Do not use anti -diarrhea or opioid medications if you have any of the follow ing

 symptoms because these products may make them worse. Tell your doctor right away if 
you develop:  
o Persistent diarrhea  
o Abdominal or stomach pain/cramping  
o Blood/mucus in your stool  
 
A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, get medic al help right away 
if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, including:  
o Rash  
o Itching/swelling  
o Severe dizziness

 Other things to note:  
This drug usually has no side effects. If you have any unusual effects, contact your doctor or 
pharmacist promptly.  
Any unexpected or unforeseen complications will be managed by the investigator throughout the 
conduct of the study. Unforeseen or unexpected side effects not listed above will be reported to 
the sponsor and regulatory representatives (IRB) as they occur.  
9.3 Mitigation of Risks  
These risks are mitigated by utilizing qualified clinical Investigators who have t raining and are 
experienced in  (1) procedures to improve  the appearance of lax tissue in the neck and submental 
region  and (2) following study treatment procedures.  In addition, risks are mitigated by including 
only those subject s that meet the study eligibility  criteria.  This study also includes evaluation of 
study subject  satisfaction with this procedure. Given the anticipated acceptable risk, the risk -
benefit assessment of the use of the Renuvion APR  device  to improve  the appearance of lax tissue 
in the neck and submental region  appears to offer a substantial clinical benefit at  a reasonable 
risk.

 10  STUDY MANAGEMENT/COMPLIANCE/ QUALITY ASSURANCE  
10.1 Protocol Deviation Reporting  
A protocol deviation is an event in which the investigator or site personnel did not conduct the 
study in accordance with the protocol or the Clinical Trial Agreement.  Prior approval by the 
Sponsor is expected in situations where the Investigator anticipates, contemplates, or makes a 
conscious decision to deviate.  Prior approval is not required when a deviation is necessary to 
protect the life or physical well -being of a subject in an emergency.  Prior approval is not expected 
in situations where unforeseen circumstances are beyond the Investigator’s control (e.g. 
inadvertent errors, product failure, or inability to perform required procedures due to subject ’s 
illness).   
All protocol deviations are to be reported to the Sponsor, along with the justification for the 
deviation, on the Protocol Deviation CRF.  Protocol deviations should be reported as soon as 
possible upon center notification of the deviation.   
10.2 Discontinuat ion of Study Subjects  
A subject  may discontinue  from the study at any time  without any penalty or loss of benefits to 
which the subject  is otherwise entitled. An Investigator may also discontinue  a subject  from the 
study without the subject ’s consent, if t he Investigator feels it is in the best medical interest of the 
subject .  The date and the reason for study withdrawal will be indicated on the Study Exit CRF.  
Every effort should be made to contact subject s lost to follow -up at least 3 times by contact 
method of their choice. Sites may choose to send a registered letter as a last attempt to contact. 
All such efforts should be documented in the subject’s file.  Subjects will be deemed “Lost -to-
Follow -up” if they have not returned within six weeks after the last follow -up target  date. 
10.3 Supply of Study materials  
The clinical study  site will be provided with the study  devices. A Device Accountability Log will 
be used to track the receipt, use , and return of study devices at each study site. All study  devices 
will be returned to study Sponsor after enrollment of all subject s. Study Sponsor will provide 
appropriate packa ging and shipping  instructions to the study site . 
10.4 Device Malfunction/Observations  
All malfunctions of, or defects of the delivery system will be recorded on the Device 
Malfunction/Observation Case Report Form and reported to the Sponsor by the investi gational 
sites.  This will include situations where the delivery system did not perform as intended; user 
errors; study device/component being physically defective, including out of the box failure.   
10.5 Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the study S ponsor to ensure that proper monitoring of this clinical 
investigation is conducted.  Appropriately trained personnel appointed by the Sponsor will 
conduct monitoring activities, as needed, and ensure that the investigation is conducted in 
accordance with the study protocol, the Clinical Trial Agreement, applicable laws and regulations 
(including ICH GCP ), and overseeing IRBs.

 Prior to study initiation at the investigational site, approval to enroll subject s will be given by the 
Sponsor and/or designee.   
The Sponsor will determine frequency and timing of interim or periodic monitoring visits based 
on enrollment rate, volume, study compliance, and findings from previous visits.  The site will be 
visited at least annually.  During a monitoring visit, the Monitor will evaluate the site’s 
compliance with regulatory and protocol requirements, verify data recorded on CRFs to available 
source documents, etc.  
In addition, the Monitor will check whether all AEs and SAEs have been reported appropriately 
within the t ime periods required.  
Data Clarification Forms (DCFs) will be created for identified errors on CRFs that have been 
submitted to the Sponsor to ensure errors/omissions are corrected.  New and previous findings 
and recommended corrective and preventative actions, if they exist, will be communicated with 
the study staff during the visit, and will also be addressed in a final letter that wi ll be sent to the 
Investigator after the visit.  
10.6 End of Study  
The end of study will be defined as completion of all study visits by all enrolled subject s. If a 
device -related AE, SAE, or unanticipated serious device -related effect is ongoing at the fi nal 
study visit, the subject  will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the 
event is otherwise explained, or the subject  is lost to follow -up.  
A study closure visit may be conducted at the study  site in order to review record  retention 
requirements, device disposition requirements, etc., with site personnel.  The Sponsor may choose 
to conduct the closure visit via telephone contact if appropriate.  
10.6.1  Premature Termination or Suspension of the Study or a Study S ite 
The stud y or parts of the study may be prematurely terminated or suspended by the Sponsor. This 
discontinuation may be based on a significant number of AEs of a similar nature that warrant such 
action. Furthermore, the study may be prematurely ended if the regulat ory authority or the IRB 
make a recommendation to terminate or suspend approval for the study, the study site, or the 
Investigator.  
 
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended for any reason, the investigator must inform 
the subject s and assure ap propriate follow -up treatment. Within the timeframes noted in 
applicable regulations, the Sponsor will promptly inform the investigators, study sites, the IRB, 
and regulatory authorities of the termination or suspension of the study, as appropriate  
10.7 Audits/Inspections  
The Sponsor, their designee, and the reviewing IRB may monitor  or audit the study center. 
Likewise, r egulatory authorities may inspect Sponsor or CRO files or any study center to eval uate 
the conduct of the study. The Investigator must all ow access to the subject  files and inspection of 
their clinical research protocol procedures when requested.

 11 STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY  
This section describes the statistical analyses foreseen at the time of study planning.  
 
Any deviations from planned analyses, the reasons for such deviation, and all alternative or 
additional statistical analyses that may be performed before database close will be summarized in 
the Clinical Study Report.  
 
Full details of primary effectiveness objective and endpoint, primary safety objective and 
endpoint, additional endpoints, and planned statistical analyses will be outlined in a separate 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for the study . Please referred to Section 8  of the SAP for detail ed 
information on handling missing data , sensitivity analyses of missing data , and poolability .  
11.1 Determination of Sample Size  
11.1.1 Primary Effectiveness  Hypothesis Test  
The primary effectiveness  objective of this study is to demonstrate response to treatment with the 
Renuvion APR handpiece . The 3 IPRs will assess each subject’s pre -treatment and post -treatment 
images in blinded random order and independently record which image they believe is the “post -
treatment” image.  The proportion of  subjects achieving at least 2 out of 3 correct IPR assessments 
will be calculated; this is the proportion of treatment successes.  
 
The sample size s were estimated using PASS 201921 with the following parameters (See Table 
5): 
• A performance goal (PG) of 5 5% success.  
• A one -sample, one -sided binomial exact test  against the PG.  
• α = 0.0 25. 
• Power = 90%  
• Plasma/RF  success proportions (P) of 7 5%  
• The t est is the binomial  Exact Test.

 11.1.2 Primary Safety Hypothesis Test  
The sample size was also calculat ed for the primary safety hypothesis.  Coincidentally, the 
parameters were identical to those for the primary effectiveness hypothesis, so the sample size 
was an identical test.  
11.2 Performance Goal Rationale  
11.2.1 Primary  Effectiveness  Hypothesis  
A Performance Goal (PG)  of 55% will be used for testing.  A PG of 5 5% is clinically relevant to 
ensure that there are significant benefits of the procedure to outweigh its risk. The lower bound 
of the confidence interval of the proportion of subject achieving tr eatment successes will be 
compared against this Performance Goal.  This primary effectiveness endpoint definition and 
performance goal is  more conservative and  supported by the results of the Ulthera System study 
that was conducted to support  equivalent  indications cleared under K121700 . Moreover, this PG 
is supported by the hypothesis and results of the clinical studies conducted to support the 
following cleared devices and studies published in clinicaltrial.gov as s ummarized in Table 6 .

COMBINED (unweighted)  256 150 63%  50%  
11.2.2 Primary Safety Hypothesis  
A PG of 55% was also established for the primary safety hypothesis test.  There were two parts 
to establishing the PG:  
1. Determining which values on a n 11-point NRS  scale correspond to mild pain and which 
to moderate.  
2. Determining what percentage of subjects  with no -to-moderate pain through 7-days is 
minimally acceptable for a cosmetic procedure.  
 
The first part was answered by Boon stra et al (201 6)20, who showed that on a 11-point NRS , cut-
off points of 5 for mild pain and 7 for moderate pain were appropriate. The second part was 
answered by Broug hton et al (2006)23, who estimated that approximately 55% of subjects reported 
no-to-moderate pain during the first week post -procedure.  
 
The Broughton estimate was taken from Table 3  of the journal article (see Table 7) , which 
tabulated the percentage s of patients reporting pain levels following liposuction by time  following 
the procedure  and number of treatment areas.  Using the data for subjects receiving treatment in 
1-2 areas, we found that 53.4% of subjects reported no higher than moderate pain during  the first 
week post -procedure:  
Renuvion APR  Device  Neck and Submental Region  Study, VP-1902, Rev. No. 9.2        December 16, 2020

Table 7: Exert of Table 3 Broughton article  
Table 3: 1 -2 Areas Liposuctioned 
Discomfort Level by Final Report (per Subject)  
  None  Mild  Moderate  Severe*  TOTAL

* Gray cells not used in calculations.  
 
Therefore, we set our PG at 55%. The null hypothesis test is that Renuvion APR  results in fewer 
than 55% of subjects with maximal pain of “moderate” (NRS pain score of 7 or less) during the 
first week post -procedure (i.e., more than 45% have severe pain).  The alternative is that more 
than 55% have moderate or less pain  (NRS pain score of 7 or less) immediately post -procedure 
and at the 1 -day and 7 -day follow -up visits , and fewer than 45% have severe pain.  
11.3 Statistical Analysis  
These analyses will be pe rformed as follows.  The primary effectiveness and primary safety 
objectives will include hypothesis tests which will be analyzed with Fisher’s exact test. All 
analyses of  additional endpoints will be descriptive; standard descriptive statistics will be 
reported:  
• Continuous variables (e.g. age) will be reported as the mean, number of observations , 
standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the mean.  
• Categorical variables (e.g. sex) will be reported as the percentage and numb er of 
observations in each category and the 95% CI of the percentage.  
• Time -to-event variables (e.g. time since last dose of anticoagulant drug) will be reported 
by the number at risk, the event rates over time and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  
Kaplan -Meier time -to-event analysis will be used to make the estimates.  
• Count variables (e.g. number of hospitalizations in the last year) will be reported by the 
frequency and percentage in each count category, and the 95% CI of each.  Poisson 
regression or negative binomial regression will be used to make the estimates; the me thod 
will depend on data dispersion.  
 
Please refer to Section 9.4  of the SAP for a detail ed description of all  analyses . 
11.4 Subgroup Analysis  
Difference s in outcomes in age, sex, ethnicity , and body mass index will be explored if the number 
of study participants in each category is adequate to make such analysis feasible.  Please refer to 
Section 9.5  of the SAP.

 41. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
1.1. Myelofibrosis with Myeloid Metaplasia 
Myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM) is a rare (0.4-1.3 per 100,000 in Europe, 
Australia and USA), chronic, ma lignant disorder that was first described in 1879 by 
Henck who called it osteosclerosis.  MMM was classified as a myeloproliferative 
disorder (1951) and further char acterized as a clonal prolifera tive disorder of a 
pluripotent stem cell (1978).   
There is some evidence of genetic transmission evidenced by a h igher incidence rate in 
the Ashkenazi Jewish population in Northern Israel.  It is also  theorized that exposure to 
Thorotrast, industrial solvents ( benzene and toluene) and the a tomic bomb predisposes 
people to development of the disorder. 
The primary pathogenetic mechan ism of proliferation of a plurip otent stem cell clone 
leads to ineffective erythropoies is, dysplastic-megakaryocyte h yperplasia, and an increase 
in the ratio of immature granulocytes to total granulocytes. Th is clonal myeloproliferation 
is characteristically accompan ied by reactive myelofibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis) and 
by extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen or in multiple or gans. The diagnosis is 
often suspected when teardrop-shaped red cells and myeloid prec ursors are detected in 
the peripheral blood. The typical cl inical features include mar ked splenomegaly, 
progressive anemia, and constitutional symptoms. The terms “mye loid metaplasia” and 
“extramedullary hematopoiesis” ar e used interchangeably to desc ribe a pathologic 
process of ectopic hematopoietic  activity that may occur in any  organ system but that 
affects primarily the liver and spleen. 
1.1.1. Differential Diagnosis 
The term “myelofibrosis with mye loid metaplasia” is usually res erved for subjects with 
agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMMM, also known as idiopathic myelofibrosis) and for 
those with a history of Polycythemia Vera (PV; 25-50% of subjects) or Essential Thrombocythemia (ET; 2-3% of s ubjects). Fibrosis can also be observed in Philadelphia-
positive chronic myelogenous leuke mia (CML).  These three disease states are part of the 
differential diagnosis in the early cellular phase of MMM with minimal marrow fibrosis.  These must be distinguished base d on cytogenetics and clinicopa thologic features.  Other 
entities that must be included i n the differential diagnosis in clude acute megakaryocytic 
leukemia (AML), primary thromboc ytopenia, lymphoma, Hodgkin’s d isease, metastatic 
malignancies (e.g., breast and col on cancer), tuberculosis (TB), histoplasmosis, 
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), Hairy Cell Leukemia and plasma cell dyscrasias.  
While the diagnosis is often one of  exclusion, there are some discriminating findings.  
1.1.2. Prognosis 
At the molecular level, a JAK2 t yrosine kinase mutation (JAK2
V617F) has recently been 
described in MMM with the reported mutational frequency ranging  from 35% to 57% 
with 9-29% homozygosity. To date, however, the presence of JAK2V617F in MMM has 
October 21, 2013 
2007-0199 
 5not been shown to have prognostic relevance. Presence of this m utation, change in its 
prevalence during the course of treatment, and associations wit h outcomes may provide 
further insight into its potentia l use as a biologic marker to track the effectiveness of 
therapies for MMM. 
Adverse prognostic factors for survival include older age and anemia (hemoglobin < 10 
gm/dL).  The etiology for the latter finding is usually multifa ctorial and related both to 
marrow failure and hypersplenism .  Poor prognosis has also been correlated with 
leukocytosis, leukopenia, circulating blasts, increased numbers of granulocyte precursors, thrombocytopenia, abnormal kar yotype, and hypercatabolic sympto ms. 
The course of the disease is hi ghly variable.  Median survival from time of diagnosis 
ranges from 3 to 6 years; survi val rates are 68% at 2 and 40% a t 5 years. The usual causes 
of death are progressive marrow failure, transformation into a nonlymphoblastic 
leukemia, and portal hypertension. 
1.1.3. Signs and Symptoms 
The clinical picture of MMM involves constitutional symptoms (e .g., cachexia, night 
sweats, bone pain, fatigue, fever —present in 40% of subjects), splenomegaly, 
anisopoikilocytosis with teardr op erythrocytes, progressive ane mia, immature myeloid 
and erythroid precursors in the  peripheral blood (in one-third of the subjects), elevated 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and fibrosis of the marrow (as evaluated by reticulin 
and trichrome [collagen] stains) .  The leukoerythoblastic pictu re is postulated to be 
related to both the intramedullar y sinusoidal marrow and splenic hematopoiesis.  
The disease generally occurs in adults, 70% of the subjects are  over the age of 50 years 
and the median age ranges from 54 to 62 years. Anemia is appare nt in 50% to 70% at 
diagnosis and 25% will have severe anemia with hemoglobin level  < 8.0 gm/dL. 
Splenomegaly is present in 85% to 100% of the subjects at diagn osis, and is massive in 
10%.  Approximately half of the subj ects present with an elevated white cell count 
(WBC), 28% with thrombocytosis (platelet count > 500 x 10
9/L, and 37% with 
thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 150 x 109/L).   
Growth factor and cytokine variations are multiple.  It is uncl ear whether the aberrations 
in cytokine production and in the va sculature are pathogenic or  whether they represent a 
nonspecific reaction associate d with the underlying clonal acti vity. Increased levels of 
basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF) have been reported in sub jects with MMM.  Both 
transforming growth factor–beta ( TGF-beta) and bFGF regulate ce ll growth and 
differentiation.  In addition to their  potent fibrogenic activi ty, TGF-beta and bFGF 
regulate hematopoiesis by selective actions on primitive stem c ells.   Basic FGF has been 
shown to augment the activity of stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), 
granulocyte-macrophage colony s timulating factor (GM-CSF), or e rythropoietin on 
committed progenitor cells.  Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) has mul tiple biological effects, 
including the regulation of hema topoiesis, immune responses, an d acute phase reactions.  
IL-6 appears to be a potent megakaryocytic maturation factor.  Other cytokines/proteins 
that are disregulated in MMM incl ude; tumor necrosis factor-alp ha (TNF-alpha) and 
angiogenic agents like vascular  endothelial growth factor (VEGF ).

 61.1.4. Treatment of MMM 
No standard therapy exists for  MMM.  Hydroxyurea is the most commonly used agent in 
the proliferative pha ses of the disease.  I nterferon-alpha had yielded hematologic 
responses and reductions in spl enomegaly in 30% to 50% of subjects, especially those in 
a proliferative phase; however, it tends to be poorly tolerated.  Therapies for anemia 
management include androgens a nd/or erythropoietin.  Splenectom y and/or splenic 
irradiation have been used to manage symptomatic splenomegaly.  Splenectomy has been 
associated with risk of leukemic transformation in some series,  and splenic irradiation 
can result in severe myelosuppression. 
No medical therapy has been prove n to prolong overall survival for these subjects. 
Subjects with an intact qualit y of life and no threatening hematologic abnormalities, such 
as erythrocytosis or thrombocytosis, have usually been observed  without any therapy; 
however, new therapeutic modalities are currently being conside red in determining 
treatment indications. 
Advances in the pathogenesis of  MMM are expected to facilitate the development of 
molecularly targeted therapy. In t he meantime, current manageme nt strategies include 
observation for low risk cases, pa rticipation in experimental d rug therapy at the 
intermediate risk level and alloge neic stem cell transplantation for high-risk disease. 
From a therapeutic standpoint, benefit to a subset of subjects has been demonstrated for 
both allogeneic stem cell tran splantation and novel drugs, incl uding the thalidomide-
derived immunomodulatory anal ogs known as immunomodulatory drug s. 
1.2. Rationale for CC-4047 in MMM 
The efficacy of thalidomide has been significantly limited by a dverse effects, which 
include sedation, neuropathy, constipation, and deep vein throm bosis. This toxicity 
profile seems dose-related and dura tion-related, s purring the d evelopment of IMiDs, 
which have the potential of improved potency and reduced toxici ty.  By modifying 
thalidomide structure through the addition of an amino group at  the 4 position of the 
phthaloyl ring (to generate CC- 4047) and with the further removal of a carbonyl on the 
ring to form another analog ( CC-5013), such analogs are up to 5 0,000 times more potent 
at inhibiting TNF-alpha than the thalidomide parent compound in vitro  and are markedly 
more stable. Indeed, when CC-5013 w as tested at a dose range of  5 to 50 mg/d, 25 mg/d 
was determined to be the maximum  tolerated dose without a signi ficant level of the side 
effects of constipation and neur opathy as had been typical of thalidomide. Along with the 
improved tolerability, impressive  response rates were realized in the treatment of multiple 
myeloma (MM) and MDS.   In multiple myeloma IMiDs not only act to inhibit angiogenesis through inhibition of 
bFGF, VEGF and TNF-alpha induce d endothelial cell migration, bu t also block the 
increased secretion of myeloma cell growth, survival, and migra tory factors such as 
interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necr osis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF). In additi on, they expand natural killer (NK) cell and T-cell 
numbers and are potent co-stimula tors of T-cells when activated through the T-cell 
receptor.   CC-4047, an IMiD, enhances produc tion of gamma interferon (INF γ) and 
interleukin (IL)-2, and augmen ts IL-10 production. Many of the cytokines active in MM 
October 21, 2013 
2007-0199 
 7are similar to those noted in MMM:  increased levels of bFGF, TNF-alpha, VEGF and 
IL–6. Therefore, there is reason to expect that CC-4047 may have a b eneficial effect in 
the treatment of MMM.  
In vitro  models of anti-TNF activity have shown that CC-4047 has an IC 50 of 24 nM 
(6.55 ng/mL) and 25 nM (6.83 ng/mL) against TNF produced by Lip o-polysaccharide 
(LPS)-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and L PS-stimulated human 
whole blood respectively. Tha lidomide, by comparison, has a TNF  IC 50 in human 
peripheral blood mononuclear cel ls of approximately 194 µM (50.1 µg/mL). 
There is previous human experien ce with the treatment of MMM by  the original IMiD, 
thalidomide.  Single-agent thalidomide at “conventional” doses (> 100 mg/d) has been 
evaluated in MMM based on its ant iangiogenic properties and the prominent 
neoangiogenesis that occurs in MMM. Thalidomide monotherapy at such doses produces 
approximately a 20% response rate in anemia but is poorly toler ated (an adverse dropout 
rate of >50% in 3 months). To improve efficacy and tolerability, 21 symptomatic subjects 
(hemoglobin level < 10 g/dL or symptomatic splenomegaly) with MMM were treated 
with low-dose thalidomide (50 mg/d) along with a 3-month oral p rednisone taper 
(beginning at 0.5 mg/kg/d). The combination therapy was well to lerated in all enrolled 
subjects, with 20 subjects (95%) ab le to complete 3 months of treatment. An objective 
clinical response was demonstr ated in 13 (62%) subjects, all im provements in anemia. 
Among 10 subjects who were transfusion dependent, 7 (70%) impro ved and 4 (40%) 
became transfusion independent. Improvements in anemia correlat ed with lower 
pretherapy CD34+cell counts in the peripheral blood (median, 81.2 CD34+ cells/μ L 
versus 554 CD34+ cells/μL [nonresponders]; P = 0.03) as well as lower numbers of 
circulating blasts (media n, 0.8% versus 4.7% in nonresponders; P = 0.03).  Among 8 
subjects with thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100 x 109/L), 6 (75%) experienced a 
50% or higher increase in their platelet count. In 4 of 21 subj ects (19%), spleen size 
decreased by more than 50%. Res ponses observed were mostly durable after 
discontinuation of the prednisone . The dose of thalidomide in this study (50 mg/d) was 
better tolerated than the highe r doses used in previous studies . Adverse events associated 
with corticosteroid therapy were mild and transient. Clinical responses did not correlate with improvements in either intr amedullary fibrosis or angiogen esis. The thalidomide-
prednisone combination was we ll tolerated and appeared to be a promising drug regimen 
for treating cytopenias in subjects with MMM.  
Ten of the MMM subjects completed an additional 3 month thalido mide-only treatment 
phase of the study.  After discontinuation of the prednisone, clinical responses were 
maintained in 62% in terms of anemia, 66% in terms of thrombocytopenia, and 50% of 
the splenomegaly responses. (Mesa, 2003) 
In 2006, results of 2 similarly designed but separate phase 2 s tudies involving single-
agent lenalidomide (CC-5013, Revlimid) have been published, inv olving in a total of 68 
patients with symptomatic myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia  (MMM). Protocol 
treatment consisted of oral lenalidomide at 10 mg/d (5 mg/d if baseline platelet count < 
100 x 10(9)/L) for 3 to 4 months wit h a plan to continue treatm ent for either 3 or 24 
additional months, in case of response. Overall response rates were 22% for anemia, 33% 
for splenomegaly, and 50% for thr ombocytopenia. Response in anemia was deemed 
October 21, 2013 
2007-0199 
 8impressive in 8 patients whose hemoglobin level normalized from a baseline of either 
transfusion dependency or hemoglobin level lower than 100 g/L. Additional treatment 
effects in these patients included resolution of leukoerythrobl astosis (4 patients), a 
decrease in medullary fibrosis and angiogenesis (2 patients). G rade 3 or 4 adverse events 
included neutropenia (31%) and thrombocytopenia (19%). The auth ors (Tefferi, 2006) 
concluded that lenalidomide e ngendered an intriguing treatment activity in a subset of 
patients with MMM that includeed an unprecedented effect on peripheral blood and bone marrow abnormalities. Interestingly, some patients previously t reated with thalidomide 
responded to lenalidomide.  Prompted by the activity of single-agent oral lenalidomide (LEN )
 in primary or secondary 
(post-essential thrombocythemia or post-polycythemia vera) myelofibrosis (MF), 
Quintas-Cardama and colleagues (2008) sought to evaluate the sa fety and efficacy of the 
combination of LEN and prednisone (LEN+PRD) in a phase II study for patients with 
MF. The rationale was that the potent antiangiogenic and cytokine-modulating activity of 
LEN may be enhanced by PRD to reduce marrow fibrosis and improv e hematopoiesis in 
MF. Therapy consisted of LEN 10mg/d PO (dose level [DL] 0) on days 1–21 of a 28-day 
cycle in combination with PRD 30mg/d PO during cycle 1, 15mg/d during cycle 2, and 15 
mg/d every other day during cycle 3. LEN was to be given for a minimum of 6 cycles and 
continued indefinitely in responders. LEN dose could be reduced to 5 mg/d (DL –1) or to 
5 mg/d every other day (DL –2), or increased to 15 mg/d (DL +1) or 20 mg/d (DL +2) 
according to toxicity or lack of response. Forty patients (23 male) have been treated. 
Median age was 62 years (range, 41–86), time from MF diagnosis to LEN+PRD therapy 
10 months (range, 0–122), WBC count 87x109/L (range, 1.1–89), hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL 
(range, 7.8–17.3), and palpable splenomegaly 10cm (range, 0–25). Patients had received a 
median of 1 prior therapy (range 0–4), including hydroxyurea (n=14), azacitidine (n=6), 
thalidomide (n=4), and IFN-  (n=3). Ten (25%) patients were treatment-naïve. The 
JAK2V617F mutation was detected in 18 (50%) of 36 tested patients and 20 (50%) of 40 
had abnormal cytogenetics. 341 cycles have been administered. P atients have received 
therapy for a median of 18 months (range, 6–24.5). According to the International 
Working Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Therapy (IWG-MRT) criteria, 12 (30%) 
patients responded, including 8 JAK2V617F-positive, 3 previously untreated, and 2 who 
had failed prior thalidomide-based therapy. Three (7.5%) partial response (PR), and 9 
(22.5%) clinical improvement (CI) were seen. Anemia improved in 7 (30%; 3 PR and 4 
CI) of 23 patients with pretreatment Hb <10g/dL o r transfusion dependency. 
Splenomegaly significantly decreased in 10 (42%; 2 PR and 8 CI) of 24 patien ts. Again, 
few patients previously exposed to thalidomide responded to len alidomide therapy. 
Responses occurred after a median of 12 weeks (range, 2–32), have been sustained for a 
median of 15 months (range, 4.1–20), and are ongoing in 10 of 12 responders still 
receiving LEN. After 12 months of therapy, a significant decrease was observed in the 
JAK2V617F allele burden among the 8 JAK2V617F positive responders (p=0.03). Four of the 
8 JAK2V617F-positive responders had >50% reduction of the mutant allele burden, 
becoming undetectable in 1. Serial histopathology analyses revealed sign ificant 
reductions in bone marrow cellula rity (p=0.01) and reticulin fibrosis (p=0.02) after 12 
months of therapy in 8 assessable responders. The most frequent grade 3–4 toxicities were 
neutropenia (65%), anemia (50%), fatigue (30%), and thrombocytopenia (20%). Twenty-

October 21, 2013 
2007-0199 
 9four (60%) patients required one dose level reduction (5 required further reduction to dose 
level -2), 1 (2.5%) had the dose escalated, and 15 (25%) remained at the initial dose level. 
Thirty (75%) patients discontinued therapy due to lack of response (n=15), pt’s decision 
(n=3), grade 3–4 toxic ity (n=9), allogeneic stem cell transplant ( n=1), loss of response 
(n=1), and poor compliance (n=1). No transforma tion to acute myeloid leukemia has been 
observed. In summary, prolonge d administration of LEN is generally well-tolerated, and 
yields long-lasting clinical, histopathological, and molecu lar responses in patients with 
MF when administered in a continuous manner. 
 Very recently, a dose-escalation tri al to determine whether CC-4047 can be given safely 
to MMM patients has been concluded (Mesa 2009).  A classic phase-I 3 x 3 trial was done 
in persons with symptomatic MMM (anemia and/or symptomatic splenomegaly). The 
starting dose was 2.5 mg/d d 1-21 every 28 d. Dose-escalation at increments of 0.5 mg/d 
was done if no subject had a DLT (≥ grade-4 hematologic toxicity , ≥grade-3 febrile 
neutropenia or ≥grade-3 non-hemato logic toxicity) in cycle-1. S ubsequent cohorts were 
treated until the maximum tolera ted dose (MTD) was reached (dose level before that 
resulting in DLT in >1 of 6 subj ects). 12 subjects with MMM wer e enrolled 06/08-12/08.  
8 had primary MMM, 3, post-polycythemia vera MMM and 1, post-es sential 
thrombocythemia MMM.  Median age was 67 years (range, 51-83), 7 were female. 9 had 
a JAK2-V617F mutation.  11 were RBC-transfusion–dependent and 1  had a hemoglobin 
<10 g/dL.  Median WBC was 4.5 x 10e9/L (range, 2–64 x 10e9/L).  Median platelets 
were 111 x 10e9/L (range, 52-538 x 10e9/L). 10 subjects had splenomegaly, median size 
of 12 cm below the LCM (range, 4-2 6 cm). 3 subjects were enroll ed in each of the 2.5, 
3.0, and 3.5 mg dose cohorts.  DLTs were observed at the 3.5 mg  level: 2 of 3 subjects 
had grade-4 neutropenia and 1, gr ade-3 thrombocytopenia.  3 mor e subjects were enrolled 
at the 3.0 mg level cohort confir med this dose as the MTD.  4 of 9 subjects receiving ≥3.0 
mg/d had grade-3 neutropenia and 1 had grade-3 thrombocytopenia.  Other toxicities 
were <grade-3 including fatigue , dyspnea, rash, lymphadenopathy and headaches. 
Subjects received a median of 3 cycles (range, 2-6 cycles).  8 subjects remain on-study; 
reasons for discontinuation were progression (N=2) and no response (N=2).  Therefore, 
data indicate the dose of CC-4047 can be increased to 3.0 mg/d for 21 d of a 28 d cycle.  
The DLT at higher doses is neutropenia.   
ADDENDUM 11/10/09: 
An update of the Phase 1 trial done  at the Mayo clinic (Dr. Rub en Mesa, personal 
communication) was provided. Nineteen MMM patients were enrolle d between June, 
2008 and March, 2009. Most of the subjec ts were intermediate-2 or high risk by the 
International Prognostic Scoring System for MF. Median duration of disease at 
enrollment was 24 months (range, 1 -173 months). Most were RBC-t ransfusiondependent 
and had symptomatic splenomegaly. Three subjects enrolled into the 2.5 mg/d, 3.0 g/d, 
and 3.5 mg/d cohorts (given for 3 weeks, with one week break). The dose limiting 
toxicity (DLT) was bone marrow suppression which occurred in 2 of 3 subjects in the 3.5 
mg/d cohort. 3 additional subjec ts received 3.0 mg/d confirming  this as the MTD. 7 
additional subjects were enrol led at the MTD of 3.0 mg/d. Becau se no efficacy was seen 
at 3.0 mg/d (21 of 28 days) the dose was decreased to 0.5mg/d ( given continuously daily 
for 4 weeks; no break in therapy) after three cycles in 8 subje cts. 7 subjects responded

 10for Clinical Improvement (IWGMRT CI). All responders had an IWG-MRT CI for 
anemia (6 previously RBC transfu sion-dependent). 2 of these ane mia responders also had 
a decrease in splenomegaly. The eligibility criteria excluded t he possibility of an IWG-
MRT CI for thrombocytopenia. How ever all 5 subjects with pre-st udy platelets of 50-
100x109/L had an increase in their platelet number, with 3 of these achieving normal platelet levels. Responses occurred after a median of 4 months (range, 2-9 months) and only after reduction to 0.5mg/ d in 5 responders including the 2  subjects with decreased 
spleen size. These responses o ccurred after 1 and 2 cycles afte r dose reduction, 
respectively (1-3 months). Res ponses were durable; 5 responders  continue on-study. 
 In addition, results of randomi zed Phase II study have been published (Tefferi, 2009). In 
a phase II randomized, multicenter, double-blind, adaptive desi gn study, four treatment 
arms were evaluated: pomalidomide (2 mg/day) + placebo, pomalidomide (2 mg/day) + prednisone, pomalidomide (0.5 m g/day) + prednisone, and prednisone + placebo. 
Pomalidomide was administered f or up to twelve 28-day treatment  cycles. Prednisone (30 
mg/day) was given in a taperi ng dose schedule during the first three cycles. Response 
was assessed by International Work ing Group criteria. Eighty four patients with MMM-
associated anemia were randoml y assigned to the above-listed tr eatment arms: 22, 19, 22 
and 21, respectively. All active patients have completed six cy cles of treatment. Response 
in anemia was documented in 20 patients, including 15 who becam e transfusion-
independent. Response rates in the four treatment arms were 23% , 16%, 36% and 19%. 
The corresponding figures f or patients receiving  3 cycles of treatment ( n=62) were 
38%, 23%, 40% and 25%. Response to pomalidomide  prednisone was durable (range 
3.2-16.9+ months) and significantly b etter in the absence of le ukocytosis (37% vs. 8%; 
p=0.01); JAK2V617F or cytogenetic status did no t affect response. Grade 3 toxicities 
were infrequent and included (i n each treatment arm) neutropeni a (9%-16%-5%-5%), 
thrombocytopenia (14%-16%-9%-5 %) and thrombosis (9%-5%-0%-0%). Pomalidomide 
therapy at 0.5  an abbreviated course of prednis one is well tolerated in patie nts with 
myelofibrosis and active i n the treatment of anemia.  
 Finally, 20 patients have been accrued into current study so fa r, with starting dose of 
3mg/day. After median follow up of 2 months, most patients had to interrupt the therapy 
due to side effects: 13 patients experienced myelosuppression, 3 had rash/swelling. The 
study accrual has been put on hold, pending modification of the dose to 0.5mg/day (given continuously).  
ADDENDUM 3/30/11: 
Since the last amendment final r esults (previous amendment prov ided preliminary 
results) of the Phase I study of  pomalidomide has been published (Phase1/-2 study of 
Pomalidomide in myelofibrosis. M esa RA, Pardanani AD, Hussein K, Wu W, Schwager 
S, Litzow MR, Hogan WJ, Tefferi A. Am J Hematol. 2010 Feb;85(2) :129-30.): “We 
conducted a dose-escalation st udy to see if higher doses of pom alidomide (previously 
shown to be safe and effective for myelofibrosis associated ane mia at 0.5 mg/day [with 
prednisone] or 2.0 mg/day) increased anemia responses. 3.0 mg/d  given for 21 of 28 
consecutive days was the maximu m-tolerated dose (MTD), with mye losuppression being

 11dose limiting. Nonresponders at the MTD had their dose decrease d and the therapy 
interval increased to daily. Seven of 19 subjects had an anemia-response and two had a 
spleen response. Most responses  occurred after dose-reduction to 0.5 mg/d, suggesting 
higher doses are associated with i ncreasing myelosuppression wi thout increasing (or 
possibly decreasing) efficacy. 
 
Very recently, a Phase II study r esults were published, examini ng low dose 
pomalidomide 0.5mg/day as a sing le agent, without prednisone (A  phase-2 trial of low-
dose pomalidomide in myelofibrosis. Begna KH, Mesa RA, Pardanani A, Hogan WJ, 
Litzow MR, McClure RF, Tefferi  A. Leukemia. 2011 Feb;25(2):301- 4.): “In a previous 
study, we reported on the safety and efficacy of low-dose (0.5 mg) pomalidomide and 
prednisone and pomalidomide alone ( 2 mg/day), for the treatment of anemia associated 
with myelofibrosis (MF). The c urrent study examined the value o f low-dose 
pomalidomide alone. The main elig ibility criterion was transfus ion-dependency or 
hemoglobin of 10gm per 100 ml. Anemia response was assessed by International 
Working Group criteria. Pomalidomide (0.5 mg/day) was given to 58 patients (median age 68 years); 46 (79%) were transfusion-dependent. Anemia response was seen in 17% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 thromboc ytopenia/neutropenia occurred  in 2%/ 0% of patients”. 
This experience was not as good as previously published result when pomalidomide 
0.5mg/day was combined with prednisone (36% response in anemia) , as explained above 
in the “ADDENDUM 11/10/09” (Tefferi, 2009).  Finally, preliminary interim res ults of this study are availabl e, as described in section 5.5: 
20 evaluable patients have been observed for at least 6 cycles on therapy with single 
agent CC-4047 at 0.5mg/day. We ha ve observed 3 patients that ha s become transfusion 
independent (response rate of 15 %). In terms of toxicity, the t herapy with such a low 
dose of pomalidomide was very s afe: one occurrence of neutropen ic fever and one 
occurrence of leg DVT (both in th e same patient). Therefore, we  propose to study low 
dose pomalidomide 0.5mg/day in com bination with prednisone, to extend previously 
noted activity of the combinati on (22 patients treated with 36% response rate) as reported 
by Tefferi (2009).

as required in the POMALYST REMS™ program.  All study participants must be 
registered into the mandatory POMALYST REMS™ program, and be wi lling and 
able to comply with the requiremen ts of the POMALYST REMS™ prog ram. 
Before starting study drug:  
Subjects must follow pregnancy tes ting requirements as outlined  in the 
POMALYST REMS™ program.  
  
Treatment Period:  
Subjects meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive 0.5mg CC-4047. 
Prednisone will be given during first 3 cycles of therapy.  It will be dosed orally at the 
dose of 30 mg/day during cycle 1, 15 mg/day during cycle 2, and  15 mg every other day 
during cycle 3, and then it will be discontinued. Prednisone will be used from 
commercially available supplies. 
Subjects will remain on study treat ment in the Treatment Period  in the absence of disease 
progression or toxicity warranting discontinuation of therapy.  Twenty-eight days is 
considered one cycle of thera py.  Subjects may be taken off study at 6 months if there is 
no response, however, they should c ontinue to be followed until  disease progression or 
initiation of an alternate therapy.

Appendix M: Schedule of Assessments.  
For females of child bearing pot ential, counseling about pregna ncy precautions and the 
potential risks of fetal exposure must be conducted at a minimu m of every 28 days. 
During counseling, subjects must be reminded to not share study  drug and to not donate 
blood. 
Pregnancy testing and counseling must be performed if a subject  misses her period or if 
her pregnancy test or her menstrual bleeding is abnormal.  Stud y drug treatment must be 
discontinued during t his evaluation. 
In addition to the required pregna ncy testing, the Investigator  must confirm with FCBP 
that she is continuing to use two reliable methods of birth con trol at each visit.   
Counseling for all men about the r equirement for latex condom u se during sexual contact 
with females of childbearing pot ential and the potential risks of fetal exposure must be 
conducted at a minimum of every 28 days. During counseling, sub jects must be reminded 
to not share study drug and to not do nate blood, sperm, or seme n. 
An unscheduled visit can occur at any time during the study.  S ource documentation must 
be maintained for these unsche duled visits. The date for the visit and any data generated 
                                                                                                                                               
  
October 21, 2013

 18must be recorded on the appropriate source.  Source documents for these unscheduled 
visits must also be maintained. 
At treatment discontinuation, s ubjects will undergo off study evaluations as outlined in 
Appendix M:  Schedule of Assessments.  In addition, a safety as sessment will be done 
approximately 28 days post the last dose of study drug.   
3.5. Drug Administration 
3.5.1. Treatment 
Subjects who meet entry criteri a will be eligible to receive 0. 5mg CC-4047 and 
prednisone. 
3.5.2. Dosing regimen 
Initial dosing of CC-4047 for e ligible subjects will be 0.5mg d aily. Subjects will receive 
oral CC-4047 from day 1 through day 28, continuously, in the ab sence of disease 
progression or toxicity warran ting discontinuation of therapy.  Twenty-eight days is 
considered one cycle of therapy.  Dosing will be at approximate ly the same time each 
day. CC-4047 capsules should be swallowed whole, and should not  be broken, chewed or 
opened.  CC-4047 should be taken without food, at least 2 hours  before or 2 hours after a 
meal. If a dose of CC-4047 is missed, it should be taken as soo n as possible on the same 
day.  If it is missed for the entire day, it should not be made  up, rather it should be taken 
at the next scheduled time point. Patients who take more than t he prescribed dose of CC-
4047 should be instructed to seek emergency medical care if nee ded and contact study 
staff immediately.   
Only one cycle of study drug will  be supplied to the subject ea ch cycle. Prednisone will 
be given during first 3 cycles of therapy.  It will be dosed or ally at the dose of 30 mg/day 
during cycle 1, 15 mg/day during cycle 2, and 15 mg every other  day during cycle 3, and 
then it will be discontinued.  
Subjects must also receive oral low-dose aspirin (81 mg) as prophylactic anti-thrombotic 
treatment unless it is contraindi cated or the subject has a platelet count less than 
75,000/µL.  If low-dose aspirin is contraindicate d, the investi gator should prescribe 
another appropriate prophylactic anti-thrombotic therapy. 
Single oral CC-4047 doses of 1 and 50 mg in healthy adult males were safe and resulted 
in Cmax values of 11.2 and 288 ng/mL respectively. Given the sh ort half-life in healthy 
adult male humans (approximately 8 to 11 hours) and once daily dosing, minimal 
accumulation is expected. A daily dosing schedule will be utili zed for this study. 
Subjects experiencing adverse events may need study treatment m odifications (Table 1). 
3.5.3. Special Handling Instructions 
Females of childbearing potenti al should not handle or administ er the clinical dosage 
forms unless they are wearing gloves. 
October 21, 2013 
2007-0199 
 193.5.4. Record of administration 
Accurate recording of all study dr ug administration (including dispensing and dosing) 
will be made in the appropriate section of the source documents .   
3.6. Dose Continuation, Modification and Interruption 
All adverse events/t oxicities are to be grad ed according to the Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE Version 3.0). Subjects who c annot tolerate dose of 
0.5mg are to discontinue tre atment.  The dose of CC-4047 is not  to be escalated.   
3.6.1. CC-4047 Dose Reduction Steps No reduction of the dose below  0.5mg a day is planned (Table 1) . 
3.6.2. Initiation of a New Cycle of Therapy A new course of treatment ma y begin on the scheduled Day 1 of a  new cycle if: 
 The ANC is ≥ 1,000/μL (≥ 1 X 10
9/L); 
 The platelet count is ≥  50,000/μL (≥ 50 X 109/L); 
 Any CC-4047-related allergic reaction/hypersensitivity or sinus  bradycardia/ other 
cardiac arrhythmia adverse event that may have occurred has resolved to ≤ grade 1 
severity; 
 Any other CC-4047-related adverse event that may have occurred has resolved to ≤ 
grade 2 severity 
If these conditions are not m et on Day 1 of a new cycle, the su bject will be evaluated 
weekly and a new cycle of CC-4047 will not be initiated until t he toxicity has resolved as 
described above.

 213.6.4. Treatment compliance 
At all times, when dispensing st udy drug, research center personnel will review the 
instructions, printed on the p ackaging, with subjects. Subjects  will be asked to maintain a 
diary to record the drug administration. Subjects will be asked to bring any unused study 
drug to the research center at t heir next visit.  Research pers onnel will count and record 
the number of used and unused study drug capsules at each visit  and reconcile with the 
subject diary.   
3.7. Concomitant therapy   
3.7.1. Recommended concomitant therapy   
All supportive measures consistent with optimal subject care wi ll be given throughout the 
study.  Packed red blood cell transfusions are allowed when nec essary.  Growth factor 
use (including erythropoietin) i s not allowed with the exceptio n of the use of filgrastim 
(G-CSF) or pegfilgrastim, which is permitted when used to treat  febrile neutropenia or 
those who have ≥ grade 3 neutropeni a and at the i nvestigators discretion for prolonged 
neutropenia.  Subjects should rec eive full supportive care, inc luding transfusions of blood 
products, antibiotics and antiemetics and prophylactic treatment for potential 
hypersensitivity reactions and tumor lysis syndrome when appropriate. Splenic infarcts 
occasionally occur and should be managed with analgesics at the discretion of the clinician and do not nece ssarily require withdrawal from the st udy.  
3.7.2. Anticoagulation Consideration   
CC-4047 may increase the risk of t hrombotic events in subjects who are at high risk or 
with a history a thrombosis, in particular when combined with o ther drugs known to 
cause thrombosis. When CC-4047 is combined with other agents su ch as steroids (e.g. 
dexamethasone, prednisone), anthracyclines (Doxil, adriamycin) and erythropoietin the 
risk of thrombosis may be increased.  
Subjects must receive oral low- dose aspirin (81 mg) as prophyla ctic anti-thrombotic 
treatment unless it is contraindi cated or the subject has a platelet count less than 
75,000/µL.  If low-dose aspirin is contraindicate d, the investi gator should prescribe 
another appropriate prophylactic anti-thrombotic therapy. 
3.7.3. Prohibited concomitant therapy 
Concomitant use of growth factor s (including erythropoietin and  excluding G-CSF and 
pegfilgrastim), cytotoxic chem otherapeutic agents (e.g. hydroxy urea), or other 
experimental drug or therapy for mye lofibrosis while the subjec t is on study is prohibited. 
Filgrastim (G-CSF) is permitted for use during the study when u sed to treat febrile 
neutropenia or those who have ≥  grade 3 neutropenia and at the investigators discretion 
for prolonged neutropenia. Chronic use (>2 weeks) of greater th an physiologic doses of a 
corticosteroid agent (dose e quivalent to >10 mg/day of predniso ne) is not permitted 
during the study. Anagrelide is  allowed to be used during the study to control elevated 
platelet count. 
October 21, 2013 
2007-0199 
 223.8. Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
Subjects will receive oral CC-4047 daily from day 1 through day 28 every 28 days in the 
absence of disease progression or  toxicity warranting discontin uation of therapy. Therapy 
will continue as long as there is a benefit, as judged by treat ing physician. 
Treatment with study drug is t o be discontinued when any of the  following occurs: 
 Lack of therapeutic effect 
 Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the Investigator, may  cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rul e out continuation of study drug. 
 Withdrawal of consent 
 Lost to follow up 
 Death 
 Suspected pregnancy 
3.9. Follow-Up   
Subjects who discontinue treatment for any reason, will be followed every three months until disease progression or initiation of alternate therapy.  At treatment discontinuation, 
subjects will undergo a safet y assessment approximately 28 days  post the last dose of 
study drug.  In addition, off study eva luations per the Schedul e of Assessments, 
Appendix M will be done.

 234. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
4.1 Serious Adverse Event  
 
An adverse event or suspected adv erse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view 
of either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of  the following outcomes: 
 Death 
 A life-threatening adverse  drug experience – any adverse 
experience that places the patien t, in the view  of the initial 
reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experienc e as 
it occurred. It does not include a n adverse experience that, ha d it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
 Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitali zation 
 A persistent or significant incap acity or substantial disruptio n of 
the ability to conduct normal life functions. 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered  a serious adverse drug experience when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the pati ent or subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
this definition. Examples of such medical events include allerg ic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in a n emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result i n inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32). 
 Important medical events as defined above, may also be consider ed serious 
adverse events. Any important m edical event can and should be r eported as an 
SAE if deemed appropriate by the Pr incipal Investigator or the IND Sponsor, 
IND Office. 
 All events occurring during the c onduct of a protocol and meeti ng the 
definition of a SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance w ith the 
timeframes and procedures outlined in “The University of Texas M. D. 
Anderson Cancer Center Instituti onal Review Board Policy for In vestigators 
on Reporting Unanticipated Advers e Events for Drugs and Devices ”.  Unless 
stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpec ted, must be 
reported to the IND Office, regar dless of attribution (within 5  working days of 
knowledge of the event). 
 All life-threatening or fatal events,  that are unexpected, and related  to the 
study drug, must have a written report submitted within 24 hours  (next 
working day) of knowledge of the eve nt to the Safety Project Ma nager in the 
IND Office.   
 Unless otherwise noted, the elect ronic SAE application (eSAE) w ill be 
utilized for safety reporting to the IND Office and MDACC IRB .  
October 21, 2013 
2007-0199 
 24 Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the fi rst 
protocol-specific intervention,  until 30 days after the last dose of drug, 
unless the participant withdraws consent. Serious adverse event s must be 
followed until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory tes ts have 
returned to baseline, progression of the event has stabilized, or there has 
been acceptable resolution of the event. 
 Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the 3 0 day time 
period that are related to the study treatment must be reported  to the 
IND Office. This may include t he development of a secondary 
malignancy. 
 
Reporting to FDA: 
 Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by the IND Spon sor (Safety 
Project Manager IND Office) according to 21 CFR 312.32. 
 
It is the responsibility of the PI and the research team to ens ure serious adverse 
events are reported according to the Code of Federal Regulation s, Good Clinical 
Practices, the protocol guidelin es, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional 
Review Board policy. 
 
4.1.1. Expedited reporting by investigator to Celgene 
 
Serious adverse events (SAE) ar e defined above.  The investigator must inform 
Celgene in writing using a Celgene SAE form or MEDWATCH 3500A f orm of 
any SAE within 24 hours of being awa re of the event.  The writt en report must be 
completed and supplied to Celge ne by facsimile within 24 hours/ 1 business day.  
The initial report must be as complete as possible, including a n assessment of the 
causal relationship between the e vent and the investigational product(s), if 
available.  Information not avail able at the time of the initia l report (e.g., an end 
date for the adverse event or l aboratory values received after the report) must be 
documented on a follow-up report.  A final report to document r esolution of the 
SAE is required.  The Celgene t racking number (PO-MMM-PI-0011) and the 
institutional protocol number should be included on SAE reports  (or on the fax 
cover letter) sent to Celgene.  A copy of the fax transmission confirmation of the 
SAE report to Celgene should be a ttached to the SAE and retaine d with the 
patient records.

4.1.2. Pregnancies 
 
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test 
regardless of age or disease stat e) of a female subject occurri ng while the subject 
is on IP, or within (insert time-frame which must be at least 2 8 days of the 
subject’s last dose of IP), are considered immediately reportab le events. IP is to be 
discontinued immediately. The pr egnancy, suspected pregnancy, o r positive 
pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety immediat ely by 
facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the Pregnancy Initial Report Form, or approved equivalent form. 
The female subject should be r eferred to an obstetrician-gyneco logist, preferably 
one experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation  and counseling. 
 The Investigator will follow t he female subject until completio n of the pregnancy, 
and must notify Celgene Drug Saf ety immediately about the outcome of the 
pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome) using the Pregnan cy Follow-up 
Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  If the outcome of the pregna ncy was abnormal (e.g., spontaneous  or therapeutic 
abortion), the Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the 
abnormal outcome meets any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE 
to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by facsimile, or other appro priate method, 
within 24 hours of the Investigat or’s knowledge of the event using the SAE 
Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  
All neonatal deaths that occu r within 28 days of birth should b e reported, without 
regard to causality, as SAEs . In addition, any infant death aft er 28 days that the 
Investigator suspects is relat ed to the in utero exposure to th e IP should also be 
reported to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by facsimile, or ot her appropriate 
method, within 24 hours of the Inves tigator’s knowledge of the event using the 
SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  
Male Subjects If a female partner of a male subject taking inve stigational pr oduct becomes 
pregnant, the male subject tak ing IP should notify the Investig ator immediately, 
and the pregnant female partner should be advised to call their healthcare provider 
immediately.

 265. BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
5.1 Overview 
This is two stage, phase II tria l designed to assess the effect of CC-4047 and prednisone 
in subjects with Primary, Post Polycythemia Vera, or Post Essen tial Thrombocythemia 
Myelofibrosis (PMF, post-PV MF, or post-ET MF). Secondary objective is to determine 
the safety of CC-4047 and predni sone in this population.  
5.2 Datasets to be analyzed 
All subjects meeting the eligibil ity criteria that have signed a consent form and have 
begun treatment will be evaluable for response. 
5.3 Statistical  Methodology 
5.3.1. Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint of this tria l is best overall response. An  evaluable subject will be 
classified as a treatment success for the primary endpoint if t he subject’s best overall 
response is CR, PR or  CI (Clinical Improvement) as determined b y International 
Working Group Criteria over the first 6 cycles of study treatme nt at 0.5mg/day dose. The 
largest success proportion where t he proposed treatment regimen  would be considered 
unpromising in this population is 5%, representing the probability of a response by 
chance. The smallest success propo rtion that would warrant further subsequent studies 
with the proposed treatment r egimen in this subject population is 20%. 
5.3.2. Study Design 
Subjects receiving CC-4047 al one, and the new study cohort of p atients receiving CC-
4047 and prednisone in combination will be evaluated using the same statistical design: a 
two stage design with one interim analysis will be used to perm it early reporting of 
efficacy results if there is s trong evidence that the study reg imen is inactive. 37 evaluable 
subjects will be accrued onto this study unless undue toxicity is encountered. We 
anticipate accruing an additio nal 10-20% of subjects to account  for ineligibility or 
cancellation; i.e. we may accrue as many as 70 subjects to this  study. Subjects who have 
been taken off study due to toxicity related to high dose pomal idomide (i.e. those who 
started therapy with 3mg/day) wi ll be replaced with new patients that will start therapy 
with 0.5mg/day), so that the goals of the study can be accompli shed.   
 
 Decision Rule: If 3 or fewer treatment successes are observed a fter all 37 evaluable 
subjects have been followed for a t least 6 cycles, we will conc lude that the treatment 
is insufficiently active in this subject population. If 4 or mo re treatment successes are 
observed, then this will be consid ered adequate evidence of pro mising activity, and 
the treatment may be recommended f or further testing in subsequent studies.  
October 21, 2013 
2007-0199 
 27 Over accrual: if more than the t arget number of subjects are ac crued, the additional 
subjects will not be used to eva luate the stopping rule or used  in any decision making 
process. However, they will be i ncluded in final point estimate s and confidence 
intervals. 
 Study duration: The anticipated accrual rate for this group of subjects is 
approximately 3 subjects per month. It will take approximately 14 months to accrue 
37 evaluable subjects. The analy sis can begin as soon as the 37th evaluable subject has 
been observed for 6 cycles (168 da ys), i.e., approximately 20 m onths after the trial 
opens.  
5.3.3. Analysis Plan 
Primary Endpoint 
The observed response rate over th e first 6 cycles of therapy a t 0.5mg/day will be 
estimated by the number of respons es (confirmed CR, PR or CI) over the first 6 cycles 
divided by the total number of evaluable subjects. Confidence i ntervals for the true 
response rates will be calculated according to the approach of Duffy and Santner. 
Secondary Endpoints Duration of response: duration of r esponse is defined as the da te at which the subject’s 
objective status is first noted t o be a CR, PR or CI to the dat e progression is documented 
(if one has occurred) or to the da te of last follow-up (for tho se subjects who have not 
progressed). 
Time to response: The time to response is defined as the time from study registration to 
the first date at which the subjec t’s objective status was clas sified as a response (CR, PR 
or CI). In subjects who do not achie ve a response, time to resp onse will be censored at 
the subject’s last evaluation date. The distribution for each o f these event-time variables 
(duration of response and time t o response) will be estimated b y Kaplan-Meier curves.  
Best overall response as determined by the International Workin g Group Criteria over the 
first 12 cycles of study treatme nt: will be estimated by the nu mber of responses 
(confirmed CR, PR or CI) over th e first 12 cycles divided by th e total number of 
evaluable subjects. Confidence in tervals for the true response rates will be calculated 
according to the approach of Duffy and Santner. 
Cytogenetic responses and molecu lar response: cytogenetic respo nses and molecular 
responses will be summarized as well as evaluated graphically. Correlations among 
clinical responses and laboratory variables will be explored us ing a Wilcoxon/Kruskal-
Wallis test for ordered contingency tables. Mutation status will be explored in relation to 
clinical outcome (re sponse) using Fisher’s exact test.  
Quality of Life (QOL) assessments: For each of the QOL assessme nt components, 
changes from baseline to each of  the follow-up time points will  be reported. The change 
will be compared between two subgroups: subjects who response to the treatment and subjects who do not response. Normality testing via the Shapiro -Wilk procedure will 
determine whether or not parametric or nonparametric procedures will from the basis for analysis (two-sample t-test, Wilcoxon rank sum test).  
October 21, 2013 
2007-0199 
 28Toxicity: As per NCI CTCAE Ve rsion 3.0, the term toxicity is de fined as adverse events 
that are classifie d as either possibly, probably, or definitely  related to study treatment. 
Such adverse events will be cap tured by Principal  Investigator and his staff in a database. 
The maximum grade for each type of  toxicity will  be recorded for each subject, including 
start/stop dates, and frequency tables for each group will be r eviewed to determine 
toxicity patterns. In addition, w e will review all adverse even t data that is graded as 3, 4, 
or 5 and classified as either “unrelated or unlikely to be rela ted” to study treatment in the 
event of an actual re lationship developing. 
5.4 Safety evaluation 
Data from all subjects who rece ive any study drug will be inclu ded in the safety analyses. 
Subjects who entered the study and did not take any of the stud y drug and had this 
confirmed, will not be evaluated for safety. 
The severity of the toxicities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v3.0 whenever 
possible.  
Toxicity Stopping Rule:  
This phase II clinical trial will have a stopping rule based on  toxicity defined as an 
adverse event considered to be at least possibly related to tre atment. In particular accrual 
to the study will be temporarily suspended if: a) 2 or more amo ng the first 10 subjects 
treated on this trial experien ces a Grade 4 cardiac, lung, live r or neurological toxicity that 
is felt to be drug related. b)  20% or more of subjects (when more than 10 subjects have 
been accrued) experience a G rade 4 cardiac, lung, liver or neur ological toxicit y that is felt 
to be drug related. After consideration by the study team (stud y chair[s], statistician, etc.) 
a decision will be made as to whether accrual can resumed. 
5.5 Interim analyses  
An interim analysis will be performed after the first 20 evaluable subjects have been 
observed for at least 6 cycles . If 1 or fewer treatment succe sses are observed in these 20 
subjects, this treatment regime n will be considered inactive in  this population and accrual 
will be terminated. If 2 or more treatment successes are observ ed in these 20 subjects, 
decisions about activity must await the final analysis. Enrollm ent into the study will 
continue while waiting for the 20th eligible subject to compl ete at least 6 cycles of 
treatment. These additional subjects will not be used to evalua te the interim stopping rule. 
5.6. Sample size and power considerations 
Assuming that the number of successes is binomially distributed, this decision rule has a significance level of 0.09; i.e., there is a 9% chance of findi ng the drug to be effective 
when it truly is not. The probability of declaring that this re gimen warrants further studies 
(i.e. statistical power) under various success proportions and the probability of stopping 
after the first stage can be ta bulated as a function of the tru e success proportion as shown 
in the following table: 
If the true success proportion is . . . . . 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 
then the probability of declaring that the 0.09 0.44 0.75 0.91 0.97 
October 21, 2013 
2007-0199 
 29regimen warrants further studies is . . . . 
And the probability of stopping at stage I 
is: 0.74 0.39 0.18 0.07 0.02 
In particular, this decision rul e has 91% power to detect an ef fective treatment given that 
the true response rate is at least 20% using this treatment.  If the true success rate is 5%, 
the chance of stopping early at the first stage is 0.74 and the  chance of concluding that the 
treatment is active is 0.09. If the true success rate is 20%, t he chance of stopping early at 
the first stage is 0.07 and the cha nce of concludi ng that the t reatment is active is 0.91 
(power).

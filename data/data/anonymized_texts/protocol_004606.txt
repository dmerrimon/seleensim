Study Drug Etirinotecan Pegol (NKTR-102)
ObjectivesPrimary Objective:
•To evaluate the 18-week progression free survival (PFS) rate of relapsed 
SCLC patients treated with NKTR-102.
Secondary Objectives:
•To evaluate the objective response rate.
•To evaluate the duration of response.
•To evaluate the overall survival.
•To evaluate the toxicity of NKTR-102 in this patient population.
Correlative Objective:
•To explore the correlation between UGT1A1 polymorphisms and 
NKTR-102 toxicities.
Study DesignThis is a single stage Phase II study of relapsed small cell lung cancer patients 
who have received only one prior systemic therapy regimen. There will be 2 patient cohorts: those progressing on first-line therapy < 3 months after completion of treatment (Group A: chemo resistant) and those progressing on first-line therapy ≥ 3 months after completion of treatment (Group B: chemo 
sensitive). Etirinotecan pegol will be administered at 145 mg/m
2 IV once 
every 3 weeks. Cycles will be repeated every 21 days (± 3 days ) until disease 
progression. Patients who develop metastases in the central nervous system (CNS) as the only site of disease progression could receive therapeutic whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), or gamma knife radiosurgery and after completion of WBRT continue on NKTR-102. Imaging studies are scheduled to be obtained after every other 21-day cycle.
Target Accrual and Study 
DurationThis study will accrue a total of 38 patients  over approximately 3 years 
(Group A; 20 patients, Group B; 18 patients). Patients will be on study for approximately 18 – 24 months.
Study ProceduresAdverse Events:  From time of Cycle 1 Day 1 until 30 days after receiving 
last dose of study drug.
Hematology:  ≤ 14 days prior to initiation of study drug, Cycle 1 (Day 1 and 
weekly), and prior to treatment on Day 1 of subsequent cycles, 30-Day Follow-Up.
Chemistry:  ≤ 14 days prior to initiation of study drug, Cycle 1 (Day 1 and 
weekly), prior to treatment on Day 1 of subsequent cycles, 30-Day Follow-Up.
Physical Examination (including vital signs, body weight, and height):

Performance Status:  ≤ 14 days prior to initiation of study drug, Cycle 1 
(Day 1 and weekly), and prior to treatment on Day 1 of subsequent cycles, 30-Day Follow-Up.
12-Lead ECG:  ≤ 14 days prior to initiation of study drug and prior to 
treatment on Day 1 of Cycle 2 and Cycle 3, if clinically indicated.
Statistical AnalysisEfficacy Assessments:
•18-week PFS is defined as the proportion of patients whose disease has 
not progressed at 18 weeks after getting etirinotecan pegol.
•Tumor response is defined as a complete response (CR) or partial 
response (PR) by RECIST 1.1 criteria, which will be evaluated by CT-scan every other cycle.
•OS is defined as the time from enrollment to death from any cause.
Safety Assessments:
•The maximum grade for each type of adverse events (AEs) will be 
recorded for each patient based on NCI CTCAE version 4.0, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine AE and toxicity (unrelated, unlikely, possible, probably, or definitely related to study treatment) patterns in each group.
•A single-stage design will be used to assess the primary endpoint 
separately for each. Based on this, the primary endpoint of this trial will be the proportion of patients who are progression-free at 18 weeks.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/16/2017

01/27/2017 Page 16 of 681 BACKGROUND
Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the most aggressive and lethal cancers in humans. It 
accounts for 15% - 20% of lung cancer. The standard combination cytotoxic chemotherapy agents have shown antitumor activity with initial responses seen in 70%–90% for both limited-stage disease (LD) and extensive-stage disease (ED) of SCLC.
1-3 Fifty to 60% of patients with 
LD and 20% - 40% of patients with ED will achieve a clinical complete response (CR) to initial chemotherapy with or without thoracic radiotherapy. Long-term survival is low and most patients eventually develop progressive disease. Overall, the median survival time (MST) for LD 
and ED is 12 – 15 months and 8 – 10 months, respectively, with 5-year survival of 10% (LD) and 0% - 2% (ED).
4,5 Even among patients who achieve CR, there is a high rate of relapse.6 In 
previous studies, 60% of LD patients achieved a CR.1,3 Seventy percent of these CR patients 
relapsed within 2 years. Although SCLC is very responsive to initial treatment, most patients relapse with relatively resistant disease. Moreover, among patients who relapse, prognosis remains poor with second-line therapy. Response to  subsequent therapy is influenced by the 
progression-free interval from cessation of initial therapy. Patients who relapse within 3 months are considered to have refractory disease and typically have response rates to second-line therapy that are inferior to patients considered to have ‘sensitive’ disease, generally defined as those who 
relapse more than 3 months after therapy.
7 The first generation topoisomerase-I inhibitors such 
as; topotecan and irinotecan are the second line treatment for relapsed SCLC with the response rate (RR) 13% - 47% and progression-free survival (PFS) 2.2 - 3.7 months compared with other single cytotoxic drugs or best supportive care ( Table 1 ).
6,8-12 Based on the high relapse rate after 
CR, leveling off of the therapeutic results, and poor long-term survival, it is clear that new active agents are needed in the treatment of relapsed SCLC.
The anti-tumor activity of topoisomerase-I inhibitor, irinotecan, has been demonstrated in 
multiple tumor types including SCLC
13-18, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)19-21, gastric 
adenocarcinoma22,23, colorectal cancer24,25 and ovarian cancer26-28. Immediately after dosing, 
however, standard topoisomerase-I inhibitors reach high peak concentrations and diffuse quickly throughout the body, penetrating and damaging healthy tissue, such as bone marrow, as well as tumor tissue. Subsequent rapid metabolism limits topoisomerase-I exposure in tumor cells, reducing the duration of their effect and resulting in a much lower tumor exposure to the active metabolite that may limit their efficacy. The usage of irinotecan is often hampered by its sub-optimal toxicity profiles and pharmacokinetics. It has a half-life (t½) of approximately 9 hours in humans, and repeat dosing demonstrates the saw-tooth pharmacokinetic (PK) profile that typifies a short t½ for both irinotecan and its major active metabolite, 7-ethyl-10- hydroxy-camptothecin (SN38), with a t½ of about 47 hours ( Figure 1 ). Additionally, there is no good second-line 
therapy available. Accordingly, due to the activity observed as front-line therapy and some activity of each of the single agents as second-line therapy, this study will investigate the efficacy of novel generation of topoisomerase-I inhibitor, NKTR-102, against relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer. Because of the fact that second-line treatment is not curative and these patients have a limited survival, this study will explore NKTR-102 that would be less toxic than irinotecan and would be applicable in the community practice.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/16/2017

1.1 Study Drug: NKTR-102
Etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) is a polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugate of irinotecan. It is a 
unique and a next generation topoisomerase I-inhibitor designed for prolonged tumor cell exposure using the polymer conjugate technology  platform which conjugates cytotoxic small 
molecules to a uniquely engineered macromolecu lar polymer core using specialized linkers 
which provide a continuous concentration of active drug in tumor cells with reduced peak concentrations and minimizing its toxicities ( Figure 1 ).APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/16/2017

Tumors
Unlike first generation topoisomerase-I inhibitors that exhibit a high initial peak concentration and short half-life, NKTR-102's unique pro-drug design results in a lowered initial peak concentration of active topoisomerase-I inhibitor in the blood ( Figure 2 ). It provides an extended 
release of irinotecan thereby providing a more continuous exposure to the active metabolite SN38. By reducing peak concentration and markedly prolonging the t½ of SN38 to about 50 days, it is possible that anti-tumor activity can be enhanced while maintaining a favorable toxicity profile. The large NKTR-102 molecule is inactive when administered. Over time, natural processes in the body continuously free active drug that then works to stop tumor cell division through inhibition of topoisomerase-I.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/16/2017

1.2 Preclinical Studies
Pharmacokinetic, pharmacologic, and toxicologic characteristics of NKTR-102 have been 
studied in mice, rats, and dogs. Pharmacokinetic studies in mice, rats, and dogs showed slower plasma clearance (CL) as well as greater and sustained exposure to irinotecan and SN38 following NKTR-102 dosing compared to irinotecan dosing. In mice and rats, the SN38 terminal t½ increased by approximately one order of magnitude, and SN38 total exposure, expressed in terms of area under the curve (AUC), increased by more than two orders of magnitude.

01/27/2017 Page 20 of 68Prolonged exposure to irinotecan and SN38 was also observed in dogs, where SN38 t½ values 
increased by approximately one order of magnitude and SN38 AUC values increased 2- to 6-fold following NKTR-102 dosing, when compared to equivalent irinotecan dosing.
The anti-tumor activity of NKTR-102 was evaluated in several tumor xenograft studies, and 
included cell lines from human colorectal (HT29), non-small cell lung (NCI H460), breast (MCF-7), ovarian (A2780), and gastric (NCI-N87) tumors. Significantly longer tumor growth delays were seen with NKTR-102 compared to irinotecan in all tumor xenograft studies. NKTR-102 is hypothesized to be more efficacious than irinotecan due to greater and prolonged topoisomerase-I inhibition resulting from prolonged tumor cell exposure to both irinotecan and SN38. The relative benefit was sustained in combination studies comparing anti-tumor activity of NKTR-102 to irinotecan each given with other therapy. These included NKTR-102 or irinotecan given with cetuximab in a mouse model of human DLD-1 colorectal tumor, NKTR-102 or irinotecan given with bevacizumab in a mouse model of human HT29 colorectal tumor, and NKTR-102 or irinotecan given with 5-FU in a model of human HT29 colorectal tumor.
The safety of NKTR-102 was evaluated in both single and repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and 
dogs. Toxicity studies included a comparator group of irinotecan-treated animals. In all studies conducted, NKTR-102 was better tolerated than equivalent doses of irinotecan. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of NKTR-102 in toxicology studies was 25% to 50% higher for NKTR-102 than irinotecan based on irinotecan equivalent dosing. Direct comparison of NKTR-102 with irinotecan at the same doses in a 4-weekly dose study in dogs showed substantially lower neutropenia and gastrointestinal (GI) effects with NKTR-102. A 3-month toxicity study in the dog has demonstrated that a dose of 30 mg/kg of NKTR-102 (600 mg/m
2), 
every two weeks, was tolerated without major overt  toxicity; the no observed adverse effect level 
(NOAEL) was determined to be 6 mg/kg of NKTR-102; the MTD was determined to be ≥ 30 mg/kg of NKTR-102.
1.3 Clinical Studies
1.3.1 Clinical Pharmacokinetics
The t½ for SN38 after NKTR-102 administration is approximately 50 days, whereas after 
irinotecan administration, the SN38 t½ has been reported as 10 to 47 hours.
29 This greatly 
increased SN38 t½ results in plasma SN38 concentrations that are significantly more sustained between doses than are possible with irinotecan. Shown in Figure 4 , a single 145 mg/m
2 dose of 
NKTR-102 results in approximately the same SN38 plasma exposure (AUC) as a 350 mg/m2 
dose of irinotecan, but exposure is continuous throughout a 21-day cycle rather than intermittent (there is no measurable SN38 after approximately 1 week with irinotecan), and maximal concentrations are approximately 5- to 10-fold less for NKTR-102 versus irinotecan.

Simulation of SN38 after irinotecan administration is based on Xie et al., 2002 .30 Simulation of SN38 after 
NKTR-102 administration is based on 06-IN-IR001 derived population parameters for SN38.
Interpatient variability in SN38 clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V) is similar to that 
reported for SN38 following irinotecan administration. There has been no obvious correlation of toxicity or SN38 PK parameters with age, race, gender, past or present smoking status, or baseline liver or renal function. Cumulative plasma SN38 AUC is not predictive of the occurrence of NCI-CTCAE Grade 2 or higher diarrhea. Further exploratory analyses, including assessment of toxicity based on uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 ( UGT1A1 ) 
status, are ongoing.
1.3.2 Clinical Safety
As of July 2012, a total of 397 patients across all clinical studies (completed and ongoing; 
single-agent and combination therapy) have received at least 1 administration of NKTR-102. Safety data from 309 patients are included in the Investigator’s Brochure, version 8.0. Observations across all studies (including safety data from ongoing studies) have been generally 
consistent with regard to the overall safety profile of NKTR-102. Gastrointestinal toxicity, especially diarrhea, is the most common and clinically significant toxicity occurring with the use NKTR-102. Other frequently observed AEs have been nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and dehydration (secondary to diarrhea and/or vo miting). Diarrhea and dehydration were also the 
most common serious adverse events (SAEs) across all studies evaluating NKTR-102. The incidence of Grade 3 diarrhea in the Phase II study in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) at the recommended dose and schedule equaled 23%, with 11% Grade 3 dehydration and 6% Grade 3 vomiting (there was no Grade 4 diarrhea, dehydration or vomiting). Prolonged severe diarrhea with associated dehydration leading to pre-renal azotemia/kidney failure has been fatal in 3 patients in the ongoing Phase II studies in metastatic colorectal, ovarian, and breast cancers (one each of an ovarian cancer a nd breast cancer patient on the 14-day schedule; 
one CRC patient on the 21-day schedule). Early c holinergic toxicities (including diarrhea), 
commonly associated with irinotecan, has not been observed with the use of NKTR-102 in any of the completed or ongoing clinical studies. Late-onset, severe diarrhea can occur: the median APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/16/2017

to 107 days). Early, proactive and aggressive intervention with anti-diarrheal therapy, IV hydration, and maintenance of electrolyte balance was observed to have a significant favorable effect on the clinical course of events, as this may prevent volume depletion, electrolyte imbalances and the development of kidney fail ure. Myelosuppression, especially neutropenia, 
can occur in patients receiving NKTR-102; however, data from clinical studies evaluating NKTR-102 suggest a lower frequency and severity of neutropenia than for irinotecan. NKTR-102 administered at a dose level of 145 mg/m² in a q21d schedule overall across all ongoing Phase II studies showed an overall incidence of neutropenia of ≤ 20% (all NCI-CTCAE 
grades) with 11% reported as NCI-CTCAE Grade 3/4. The onset of neutropenia in the concomitant setting of severe diarrhea and de hydration with fever and infection must be 
carefully monitored and proactively treated as it can potentially lead to neutropenic sepsis, which may be fatal.
1.3.3 Clinical Efficacy
Nektar initiated its NKTR-102 clinical program with the Phase I Study 06-IN-IR001. 
Study 06-IN-IR001 evaluated three treatment schedules (wx3 q4wk, q21d, and q14d) in patients with refractory solid tumors. In all schedules, NKTR-102 was administered as an IV infusion over 90 minutes. NKTR-102 demonstrated anti-tumor activity in a broad spectrum of tumors (Table 2 ). Eight of the 76 patients enrolled in this study had a confirmed partial response (PR) 
by RECIST 1.0 (for an ORR of 11%). These responses were seen in lung cancers (SCLC and NSCLC), breast, bladder, cervix, maxillary sinus, pancreas, and colorectal cancers. Two unconfirmed responses were seen in colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer. These findings led to 
the initiation of a Phase II development program in colorectal cancer and in cancers not normally associated with use of irinotecan in the US, but for which preliminary evidence was seen of anti-tumor activity associated with NKTR-102 (ovarian and breast). On the basis of the results of this study, the recommended Phase II dose was initially identified as 170 mg/m
2 on either a q14d or 
q21d schedule. The dose was later revised to 145 mg/m2 q14d or q21d after additional safety 
data related to diarrhea were received from this Phase I study and from the ongoing Phase II studies.

A Phase II study (Protocol 08-PIR-05) of NKTR-102 in patients with MBC evaluating two treatment regimens (145 mg/m
2 q14d and q21d; n = 70; 35 per treatment regimen) showed 
significant antitumor activity.31 The study showed the following activity in the two treatment 
regimens combined: The ORRs in the total population was 29%, including 2 complete responders and an additional 4 patients who had complete resolution of target lesions. The ORR was maintained in patients with advanced or high-risk disease (ORR equal to 31% in patients who had received prior anthracycline, taxane, capecitabine [ATC]; ORR in patients with triple negative breast cancer [TNBC] was 39%). As of May 2011, median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 4.6 months and 10.3 months, respectively; the q21d schedule had longer PFS and OS than the q14d regimen (5.3 months versus 3.5 months, and 13.1 months versus 8.8 months, respectively). Based on better tolerability, a trend towards improved OS and PFS, as well as the convenience of a less frequent dosing regimen, the q21d 145 mg/mg
2 treatment schedule of NKTR-102 was selected for the Phase III study.
A Phase II study (Protocol 08-PIR-04) of NKTR-102 in patients with platinum resistant ovarian 
cancer evaluated two treatment regimens (145 mg/m2 q14d and q21d; n = 71; 36 and 35 patients 
per treatment regimen). Overall, NKTR-102 produced a RECIST 1.0 ORR of 23% and

patients whose disease had progressed following both platinum (within 6 months) and liposomal doxorubicin (n = 33), ORR equaled 21%, median PFS equaled 5.4 months and OS equaled 13.9 months.
33 Based on these data, enrollment to the q21d regimen continued for patients with 
platinum resistant disease whose disease has also progressed following pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. A randomized Phase II study (Protocol 08-PIR-03) comparing single-agent NKTR-102 to single-agent irinotecan in patients with 2
nd-line metastatic colorectal cancer 
(whose malignancy is positive for a KRAS mutation) is ongoing.
The Phase IIa study of NKTR-102 in combination with cetuximab (Protocol 07-PIR-02) is 
completed and the Phase I study of NKTR-102 in combination with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (FULPIRI) (Protocol 09-PIR-07) is in progress. See the Investigator’s Brochure for additional information on these clinical trials.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/16/2017

1.4.1 Pharmacogenetics
The genes that have been associated with irinotecan pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic 
pathways include those responsible for activation, inactivation and transport of the drug. These genes include ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCG2, BCHE, CES1, CES2, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, SLCO1B1, 
TOP1, UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A7, 1A8, 1A9  and UGT1A10 . As NKTR-102 is a conjugate of 
irinotecan, most of the irinotecan pathway genes may interact with it thus resulting in similar phenotypic effects. Hence, several genetic variants associated with the pathways may contribute to the clinical outcome of NKTR-102 therapy.
Some of the well-known genetic variants that have been associated with irinotecan clinical 
outcomes include the polymorphic repeat in UGT1A1  promoter region ( UGT1A1*28 , rs8175347; 
UGT1A1*93 ) and the ABCB1  (1236C > T, 2677G > T/A, 3435C > T), ABCC2  (-24C > T, 1249G 
> A, 3972C > T), and ABCG2  (34G > A, 421C > A) polymorphisms. It is reported that nearly 
50% of the variations in neutropenia among indivi duals could be explained by a combination of 
genetic polymorphisms and non-genetic covariates, w ith gene combinations attributing to 28% of 
the variations, suggesting a polygenetic basis for neutropenia.
32 UGT1A1*28  and *93 genotypes 
have been associated with toxicity; ABCC2 3972C > T with severe diarrhea in both Korean and 
European patients while SLCO1B1*5  allele is reported to be associated with increased risk of 
severe neutropenia in Asians, and the SLCO1B1*1b  allele is suggested to be protective of 
neutropenia.32-35
This Phase II study (38 patient samples) will initially focus, in an exploratory manner, on the primary genes which will activate ( CES1, CES2, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 ) and inactivate 
(UGT1A1 ) NKTR-102. It is hypothesized that germline polymorphic variants in CES1, CES2, 
CYP3A4, CYP3A5  and UGT1A1  may affect toxicity as well as response to NKTR-102 therapy.
SNP Identification:  We will generate tagSNPs from National Center for Biotechnology 
Information (NCBI), HapMap and/or the Genome Variation Server databases using the 
Caucasian SNP information for these 5 genes in addition to using SNPs previously reported in literature. These SNPs will be selected with sufficient frequency that its impact on the clinical outcome at a population level would be meaningful and have some degree of likelihood to alter the function of the gene in a biologically relevant manner. Fifty-three SNPs have been identified for genotyping.
Genotyping:  The tagSNPs will be genotyped using the MassARRAY Compact system 
(Sequenom) at RPCI as previously described.36 Whenever possible, the published methods and 
primers will be used for polymorphic variants such as UGT1A1*28.
1.5 Risks Associated with NKTR-102
A majority of NKTR-102 related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in the 
system organ class (SOC) of GI disorders with diarrhea experienced most commonly by 85.5% of patients, followed closely by nausea (77.6%), fatigue (51.3%), and vomiting (48.7%). Other clinically significant NKTR-102-related TEAEs with an incidence rate > 10% included anorexia, dehydration, alopecia, electrolyte disturbances like hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/16/2017

diarrhea with dehydration leading to pre-renal azotemia and subsequent acute renal insufficiency has been fatal in three patients in the ongoing Phase II studies in metastatic colorectal, ovarian, and breast cancers (one patient in each study). To date, early onset cholinergic diarrhea (as seen with irinotecan) has not been observed in any patient who received NKTR-102. Given the extended t½ of SN38 derived from NKTR-102 (approximately 50 days), late onset diarrhea may occur and can be life-threatening if treatment is delayed. Early, proactive, and aggressive intervention with anti-diarrheal therapy, IV hydration, and maintenance of electrolyte balance is essential to prevent volume depletion, electrolyte imbalances, and the development of kidney failure.
Myelosupression, especially neutropenia, can occur in patients receiving NKTR-102. 
Neutropenia in the setting of dehydration and unresolving GI toxicities may lead to the development of life-threatening or fatal sepsis. To date across all clinical studies, three patients have died within 30 days from last dose of NKTR-102 due to potentially drug-related neutropenic sepsis or complications of neutropenic sepsis, such as septic shock.
Prior to retreatment, patients must meet minimal requirements with respect to hematopoietic 
function especially neutrophil count with an ANC of ≥ 1.5 x 10
9/L. Except for diarrhea 
(complete resolution of diarrhea to Grade 0 should be present for at least seven days without the need for anti-diarrheal medications and/or supportive care prior to retreatment with NKTR-102), all Grade 3 or higher toxicities must resolve to baseline or Grade 1 severity prior to retreatment. Supportive care may be implemented in order to ameliorate diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, or myelosuppresion. Dose reductions must also be implemented for patients who experience recurrent or specific severe toxicities as define d by the dose modification guidelines included in 
each protocol.
Hypersensitivity or mild allergic reactions characterized by itching, flushing, dizziness, muscle 
twitching, and/or temporary speech impairment have been observed in some patients. In most cases, symptoms were mild in severity and management with antihistamines and/or steroids led to successful resolution of these events. In many patients, NKTR-102 rechallenge has been successful in subsequent cycles of therapy following premedication with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids.
2 RATIONALE
Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the mo st aggressive and lethal cancers in humans. 
Although standard combination cytotoxic chemotherapy agents have shown antitumor activity with initial responses seen in 70% - 90% for both limited and extensive stages of SCLC, long-term survival is low and most patients eventually develop progressive disease within the first 2 years. Moreover, among patients who relaps e, prognosis remains poor with second-line therapy 
(Table 1 ).
Etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) is a targeted, long-acting topoisomerase-I inhibitor designed to 
provide continuous exposure to SN38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), while reducing excessively high irinotecan and SN38 plasma concentrations associated with toxicities upon administration of irinotecan.

3 OBJECTIVES
3.1 Primary Objective
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the 18-week progression free survival (PFS) 
rate of relapsed SCLC patients treated with NKTR-102.
3.2 Secondary Objectives
•To evaluate the objective response rate.
•To evaluate the duration of response.
•To evaluate the overall survival.
•To evaluate the toxicity of NKTR-102 in this patient population.
3.3 Correlative Objective
•To explore the correlation between UGT1A1 polymorphisms and NKTR-102 toxicities.
4 METHODOLOGY
4.1 Study Design
This is a single stage Phase II study of relapsed small cell lung cancer patients who have 
received only one prior systemic therapy regimen. There will be 2 patient cohorts:  those progressing on first-line therapy < 3 months after completion of treatment (Group A: chemo resistant) and those progressing on first-line therapy ≥ 3 months after completion of treatment 
(Group B: chemo sensitive). Etirinotecan pegol will be administered at 145 mg/m
2 IV once every 
3 weeks. Cycles will be repeated every 21 days (± 3 days ) until disease progression. Patients who 
develop metastases in the central nervous system (CNS) as the only site of disease progression could receive therapeutic whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), or gamma knife radiosurgery and after completion of WBRT continue on NKTR-102. Imaging studies are scheduled to be obtained after every other 21-day cycle.
4.2 Target Accrual and Study Duration
A maximum of 38 subjects (20 patients from Group A and 18 patients from Group B) at multiple 
sites, including RPCI will be enrolled. Accrual is expected to take up to 4 years. Patients will be 
on study for approximately 18 – 24 months.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/16/2017

NKTR-102 will be shipped to participating sites. Each site will document the date of receipt and 
condition of the shipment. Drug shipment records will be retained by the investigational pharmacist or designee.
6.3 Reconstitution and Handling
The NKTR-102 for injection vial is for single use only. Allow vial(s) to reach room temperature 
(approximately 30 minutes). 
Using pharmacy standard operating procedure, withdraw 20 mL of D5W from a 250 mL D5W 
infusion bag using sterile needle and syringe and inject into each vial of lyophilized study drug required for a given dose. The final concentration in the vial is now 5 mg/mL. Note: Normal 
Saline (0.9% w/w) may also be used as diluent for reconstitution. It is not necessary to remove overfill. 
Gently invert vial for 1-5 minutes until study drug has fully dissolved. Visually inspect vial 
contents for particulate matter and repeat inspection when study drug is withdrawn from vial into syringe. If any particulate matter is seen, return the syringe contents to the vial and invert several 
more times.
If the study drug does not fully dissolve and particulates or small matter is identified in the 
reconstituted NKTR-102, it is recommended that the reconstituted drug in question NOT be used. Please document in the investigational drug accountability log and prepare a new dose for the patient. Please also quarantine the drug in que stion and contact Nektar with the following 
additional information: 
i. Details on how the NKTR-102 was reconstituted ii. What diluents were used and in what volume(s)? iii. How long was the drug product reconstituted for? 
Due to the high viscosity, the study drug solution in the syringe may contain trapped 
bubbles. This is normal. 
Inject the required volume of reconstituted study drug back into the 250 mL infusion bag. The 
final concentration of NKTR-102 in a 250 mL D5W or Normal Saline infusion bag must be within a range of 0. 2 to 1.6 mg/mL and 0.16 to 1.6 mg/mL respectively. 
Inspect the 250 mL infusion bag for particulates prior to infusion. If the particulates do not clear 
with gentle inversion, discard the bag, document in the investigational drug accountability log and inform Nektar.   
The reconstituted drug may be stored protected from direct ambient lighting at room temperature 
(15°C to 30 °C) for up to 6 hours prior to start of infusion. Other drugs must not be added to the 
infusion solution.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/16/2017

7 TREATMENT PLAN
7.1 Dosage and Administration
NKTR-102 will be administered 145 mg/m
2 IV dose over a 90-minute period once every 
3 weeks. Cycles will be repeated every 21 days (± 3 days ). The patient’s actual weight at 
baseline (Day 1 of Cycle 1) will be used. It is  not necessary to correct dosing based on ideal body 
weight. If the patient’s weight changes by > 10% during the course of the study, the body surface area and drug doses should be recalculated.
Treatment will be administered in an outpatient basis. Reported adverse events (AEs) and 
potential risks are described in Investigator’s Brochure. Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 7.2 . No other investigational or commercial drugs or therapies other that 
those described below may be administered with the intent to treat the subject.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/16/2017
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: I 225612
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE
01/27/2017 Page 32 of 687.2 Dose Modification Due to Toxicity
All AEs should be assessed according to the NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. In the event of multiple 
toxicities, dose delays and modifications should occur in accordance with the worst toxicity observed. NKTR-102 dose modifications (reductions or delays) must be recorded for each patient in the appropriate section of the electronic case report form (eCRF).
7.2.1 Retreatment Criteria
To ensure safe use of NKTR-102, subjects must meet requirements with respect to hematopoietic 
function (Hgb ≥ 8.0 g/dL; ANC ≥ 1.5 x 10
9/L; platelets ≥ 75 x 109/L) prior to initiation of 
subsequent cycles. Diarrhea must be fully resolved to Grade 0 for at least 7 days without supportive antidiarrheal measures prior to retreatment. Any non-hematologic toxicities must have resolved to baseline or Grade 1 except for alopecia. Supportive care may be implemented in order to ameliorate diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or myelosuppression. Dose reductions may also be implemented for subjects who experience recurrent or specific severe toxicities.
7.2.2 Treatment Delay
If the patient fails to meet the criteria for re-treatment, treatment may be delayed, followed by an 
additional evaluation to determine feasibility of retreatment. Initiation of subsequent doses may be delayed for a maximum of 28 days to allow recovery from any toxicity to permit retreatment. Subjects whose treatment delays are ≥ 14 days but ≤ 28 days due to a drug-related toxicity must 
initiate their next treatment cycle with a dose reduction. Subjects who require > 28 days delay due to unresolved toxicity must be withdrawn from treatment, unless, in the Investigator’s opinion, continuing in the study is of benefit for the patient. In this case, the reason of continuation must be documented.
7.2.3 Dose Reductions
NKTR-102 doses for an individual patient may be reduced 25 mg/m
2 based on conditions listed 
in the Table 3  below. Only 2 dose reductions are permitted. Subjects should be discontinued 
from the study treatment if toxicity requires a dose reduction beyond the 2 dose reduction steps. Dose re-escalation for NKTR-102 is not permitted.

01/27/2017 Page 36 of 687.3 Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care
7.3.1 Anti-Emetic Therapy
Prophylactic anti-emetics will be allowed according to standard practices.Based on investigator discretion, an investigator may prescribe prophylactic antiemetics prior to 
the first dose of the study drugs. The patient must be carefully monitored throughout the study period, and given adequate fluid and electrolyte replacement to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Dexamethasone, ondansetron, lorazepam or prochlorperazine can be given at the discretion of the treating physician.
7.3.2 Anti-Diarrheal Therapy
Severe diarrhea can occur without any evidence of significant GI toxicity observed in preceding 
courses of treatment with NKTR-102. Exposure to SN38, the active metabolite of NKTR-102, is a function of dose, schedule, and each patient’s capacity to metabolize and eliminate NKTR-102 and SN38. Given the extended t½ of SN38 derived from NKTR-102 (approximately 50 days), late onset diarrhea may occur and can be life threatening if treatment is not delayed. Early proactive and aggressive intervention with anti-diarrheal therapy, IV hydration, and maintenance of electrolyte balance is essential to prevent volume depletion, electrolyte imbalances, and the development of kidney failure.
Prophylactic antidiarrheal medications should not be used, as they can confound the evaluation 
of recovery to Grade 0 and monitoring of diarrhea associated with NKTR-102. Use of antidiarrheal medications for the treatment of diarrhea or loose stool is mandatory.
Guidelines for the treatment of diarrhea include:
1. Each patient must be instructed to immediately begin taking loperamide at the very first 
episode of poorly formed or loose stools or the earliest onset of bowel movements that are more frequent than normally expected for the patient.
2. One dosage regimen for loperamide used in clinical trials consisted of the following: 
4 mg at the first onset of diarrhea and then 2 mg every 2 hours until the patient is diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours. Loperamide is not recommended to be used for more than 48 consecutive hours at these doses, because of the risk of paralytic ileus. During the night, the patient may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours.
3. The use of concomitant drugs with laxative properties should be avoided because of the 
potential for exacerbation of diarrhea. Patients must be advised to contact their physician to discuss any laxative use.
4. Patients must be instructed to contact their physician or nurse if any of the following 
occur: diarrhea for the first time during study drug treatment; black or bloody stools; symptoms of dehydration such as excessive thirst, dry lips and mouth, lightheadedness, dizziness, or faintness; inability to take fluids by mouth due to nausea or vomiting; inability to get diarrhea under control within 24 hours; or fever or evidence of infection.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/16/2017

01/27/2017 Page 37 of 685. Patients who are dehydrated must promptly receive adequate IV fluids, electrolytes to 
combat electrolyte imbalance if present and antibiotics in case of fever. Serial complete and differential blood counts must be done for early identification of the concomitant occurrence of neutropenia.
7.3.3 Platelet Transfusion
Patients may receive transfusions (platelets or blood products) at the Investigator’s discretion. If 
platelet count < 20,000/mm
3, 1 unit single-donor apheresis platelet transfusion may be given. A 
post-transfusion platelet count should be collected at 15 minutes post-transfusion to demonstrate increment.
7.3.4 Growth Factor Use
Prophylactic use of growth factor support is not permitted, however use of growth factor support 
in a setting of neutropenia is permitted. Use of growth factor support must follow American Society Clinical Oncology (ASCO), ESMO guidelines or standard of care at the local institution. If a patient required growth factor support during a pre vious cycle, a patient may be administered 
prophylactic growth factor support during a subsequent cycle at the investigator’s discretion.
7.3.5 Other Antineoplastic Therapy
The administration of other antineoplastic therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, hormone therapy, 
immunotherapy, targeted therapy, monoclonal antibodies and radiation therapy) is not permitted. Patients requiring radiation therapy after the start of the study are considered as having progression of disease and must discontinue study treatment.
7.3.6 Bisphosphonates and Denosumab
Patients may continue or start Bisphosphonates and Denosumab if required during the study.
7.3.7 Medications NOT ALLOWED During Study 
(P450 inhibitors/inducers)
Because there is a potential for interaction of drug with other concomitantly administered drugs 
through the cytochrome P450 system, the electronic case report form (eCRF) must capture the concurrent use of all other drugs, over-the-counter medications, or alternative therapies. The Investigator should be alerted if the subject is taking any agent known to affect or with the potential to affect selected CYP450 isoenzymes.
In vitro drug interaction studies of NKTR-102 with cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme (CYP3A4) 
have not been done. However, drug interactions have been documented between CYP3A4 enzymes and irinotecan and are listed in the Camptosar® USPI August 2010. Please refer to the Camptosar® package insert for further information.
St. John’s Wort:  St. John’s Wort is an inducer of CYP3A4 enzymes. Exposure to the active 
metabolite SN-38 is reduced in patients receiving concomitant St. John’s Wort. St. John’s Wort should be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to the first cycle of irinotecan, and St. John’s Wort 
is contraindicated during irinotecan therapy.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/16/2017
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: I 225612
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE
01/27/2017 Page 38 of 68Anticonvulsants:  Exposure to irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 is substantially reduced 
in adult and pediatric patients concomitantly receiving the CYP3A4 enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants phenytoin, phenobarbital or carbamazepine. The appropriate starting dose for patients taking these anticonvulsants has not been formally defined. The following drugs are also CYP3A4 inducers: rifampin, rifabutin. For patients requiring anticonvulsant treatment, consideration should be given to substituting non-enzyme inducing anticonvulsants at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of NKTR-102 therapy. Dexamethasone does not appear to alter the 
pharmacokinetics of irinotecan.
Ketoconazole:  Ketoconazole is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 enzymes. Patients receiving 
concomitant ketoconazole have increased exposure to irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38. Patients should discontinue ketoconazole at least 1 week prior to starting irinotecan therapy and 
ketoconazole is contraindicated during irinotecan therapy.
Neuromuscular blocking agents:  Interaction between irinotecan and neuromuscular blocking 
agents cannot be ruled out. Irinotecan has anticholinesterase activity, which may prolong the neuromuscular blocking effects of suxamet honium and the neuromuscular blockade of non-
depolarizing drugs may be antagonized.
Atazanavir sulfate : Coadministration of atazanavir sulfate, a CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 inhibitor 
has the potential to increase systemic exposure to SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. 
The Principal Investigator should be contacted with any questions related to concomitant 
medications (from 4 weeks prior to the first dose of NKTR-102 through 4 weeks after the last dose of NKTR-102).
7.4 Duration of Treatment
Subjects may remain on study treatment in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity, and withdrawal from study or study termination. Patients who develop metastases in the central nervous system (CNS) as the only site of disease progression could receive therapeutic whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), or gamma knife radiosurgery and after completion of WBRT continue on NKTR-102. Imaging studies ar e scheduled to be obtained after every other 
21-day cycle.
7.5 Treatment Discontinuation
Upon treatment discontinuation all end of treatment evaluations and tests will be conducted. All 
subjects who discontinue due to an AE must be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes. Appropriate medical care should be provided until signs and symptoms have abated, stabilized, or until abnormal laboratory findings have returned to acceptable or pre-study limits. The final status of the AE will be reported in the subject’s medical records and the appropriate eCRF.
Reasons for treatment discontinuation should be classified as follows:
•Death
•Progressive disease
•Treatment-related toxicity

•Noncompliance
•Investigator judgment
oThe Investigator may withdraw a subject if, in his/her judgment, it is in the 
subject’s best interest to do so.
•Subject voluntary withdrawal
oA subject may withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason. If a subject 
discontinues treatment, an attempt should be made to obtain information regarding the reason for withdrawal.
Subjects who are unavailable for follow-up evaluations should be classified as lost to follow-up 
for 1 of the following reasons:
•Lost to follow-up: For a subject to be considered lost to follow-up, the investigator must 
make 2 attempts to re-establish contact with the subject. The attempts to re-establish subject contact must be documented (e.g., certified letter).
•Death: Date and cause of death will be recorded for those subjects who die within 
30 days after last dose of study drug (telephone contact is acceptable).
7.6 Compliance
On Day 1 of each treatment cycle, study-treatment administration will be documented on the 
eCRF. Any deviations from the protocol-specified study drug administration will be documented, including the date and reason for each dosing noncompliance.
7.7 Subject Randomization and Registration
This is a non-randomized study. Patients will be categorized into two groups depending on their 
prior response to treatment. Group A (chemoresistant group) includes patients progressing < 3 months after first-line therapy and Group B (chemosensitive group) includes patients progressing ≥ 3 months after first-line therapy.

8 EFFICACY EVALUATIONS
8.1 Objective Tumor Response
All protocol-defined imaging studies must be performed at the investigative site or sponsor-
approved facility using protocol-defined parameters. The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. RECIST 1.1 will be used to assess objective tumor response.
8.2 Target Lesions
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, will be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions will be selected on the basis of their size. Lesions with the longest diameter (short axis for lymph nodes) and are ≥ 10 mm (CT and MRI), ≥ 15 mm lymph 
nodes, > 20 mm CXR and are for accurate repetitive measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically) will be chosen. A sum of the longest diameter (short axis for lymph nodes) of all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. This will be used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/16/2017

01/27/2017 Page 45 of 68•Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any lymph nodes must have 
a reduction in short axis to < 10 mm. Changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat studies performed no less than 6 weeks after the criteria for response are first met.
•Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat studies performed no less than 6 weeks after the criteria for response are first met.
•Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as references the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.
•Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest  sum diameter while on study. Subjects having 
a documented response with no confirmation of the response will be listed with stable disease.
8.3 Non-Target Lesions
All other small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or lymph nodes ≥ 10 mm to < 15 mm short 
axis) and non-measurable lesions (i.e., leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, blastic bone lesions, or abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable by imaging) should be identified as non-target lesions and indicated as present in the source documents at baseline. The general location will also be documented on the images drawing a regularly-shaped Region of Interest. Measurements of the non-target lesions will not be performed, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up and evaluation.
•Complete Response: Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level, if applicable. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).
•Non-Complete Response/Non-Progressive Disease: Persistence of 1 or more non-target 
lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the upper limits of normal.
•Progressive Disease: Appearance of 1 or more new lesions or the unequivocal progression 
of existing non-target lesions. Although a clear progression of non-target lesions is exceptional, in such circumstances, the opinion of the treating physician should prevail and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time.
8.4 Evaluation of Response
Time point response assessments will be performed every other cycle (timed to coincide with the 
end of a cycle) with a confirmatory assessment (required for non-randomized trials) no less than

Any Yes PD
1 Non-CR/non-PD is preferred over SD for non-target disease since SD is used as endpoint for assessment of 
efficacy in trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not advised.
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of study treatment until progression or death or discontinuation for any reason (the end of treatment taking into account any requirement for confirmation). In general, the subject’s best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria and will be determined by combining the subject’s status of target lesions, non-target lesions, and new lesions.
•Symptomatic Deterioration: Subjects with global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time, and not related to study treatment or other medical conditions should be reported as progressive disease due to “symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment due to symptomatic deterioration. Symptomatic deterioration that may lead to discontinuation of treatment include, but is not limited to, symptoms such as:

pain/increasing requirement for narcotic analgesics).
oDecline in performance status of > 1 level on ECOG scale.
8.5 Confirmation Measurement
The main goal of confirmation of objective response in clinical trials is to avoid overestimating 
the response rate observed. This aspect of response evaluation is particularly important in nonrandomized trials where response is the primary endpoint. In this setting, to be assigned a status of partial response or complete response, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments that should be performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. Longer intervals as determined by the study protocol may also be appropriate.
In the case of stable disease, measurements must have met the stable disease criteria at least once 
after study entry at a minimum interval (in general, not less than 6 – 8 weeks).
8.6 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline a nd during follow-up. Imaging-based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.
•Clinical Lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm diameter as assessed 
using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.
•Chest x-ray: Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable.
•Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan 
based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g., for body scans).
Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/16/2017

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE
01/27/2017 Page 48 of 68the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe  specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all 
scanners, body parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible.
•PET-CT: At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET-
CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements. However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.
•Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, becau se they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and meas urements will be taken from one assessment to 
the next. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.
•Endoscopy, Laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation 
is not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological 
response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.
•Tumor Markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a subject to be considered in complete clinical response.
•Cytology, Histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses 
(PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable  disease (an effusion may be a side effect of 
the treatment) and progressive disease.
•FDG-PET: While FDG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:
•Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/16/2017

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE
01/27/2017 Page 49 of 68•No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: If the positive FDG-PET at 
follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD. If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET scan). If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.
•FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring. The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and supported by disease-specific medical literature for the indication. However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.
Note: A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.
9 SAFETY EVALUATION
9.1 Adverse Events
9.1.1 Definition
 An adverse event or adverse experience (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated 
with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. Therefore, an AE can be ANY unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (i nvestigational) product (attribution of ‘unrelated’, 
‘unlikely’, ‘possible’, ‘probable’, or ‘definite’).
An AE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at 
the specificity or severity that has been observed; or if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan in other study-related documents.
9.1.1.1 Diagnosis Versus Signs and Symptoms
If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the CRF rather than individual signs and symptoms 
(e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be clinically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow-up information.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/16/2017
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: I 225612
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE
01/27/2017 Page 50 of 689.1.1.2 Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) 
should be identified by their primary cause. For example, if severe diarrhea is known to have resulted in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the CRF.
However, clinically significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated 
in time should be recorded as independent events on the CRF. For example, if a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be recorded separately on the CRF.
9.1.1.3 Abnormal Laboratory Values
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that require active management will be 
recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF (e.g., abnormalities that require study drug dose modification, discontinuation of study treatment, more frequent follow-up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.).
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 x the upper limit of normal associated with cholecystitis), only the diagnosis (e.g., cholecystitis) needs to be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF.
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the 
abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE  or SAE on the CRF. If the laboratory abnormality 
can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE or SAE. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia”
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should 
not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF, unless their severity, seriousness, or etiology changes.
9.1.1.4 Preexisting Medical Conditions (Baseline Signs and Symptoms)
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, 
severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. When recording such events on an Adverse Event CRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).
9.1.2 Grading and Relationship to Drug
The descriptions and grading scales found in the CTEP Version 4 of the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be utilized for AE reporting. CTEP Version 4 of the CTCAE is identified and located at: http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . AEs not covered by 
specific terminology listed should be reported with common medical terminology, and 
documented according to the grading scales provided in the CTCAE Version 4.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/16/2017

•Unrelated: The event is clearly related to other factors such as the patient’s clinical state, 
other therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs administered to the patient.
•Unlikely: The event is doubtfully related to investigational agent(s). The event was most 
likely related to other factors such as the patient’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs.
•Possible: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, but could have been produced by other factors such as the patient’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs.
•Probable: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, and follows a known response pattern to the study drug. The event cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the patient’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs.
•Definite: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, follows a known response pattern to the study drug, cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the patient’s condition, therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs; AND occurs immediately following study drug administration, improves upon stopping the drug, or reappears on re-exposure.

9.2.1 Definition
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event (experience) that in the opinion of either the 
investigator or sponsor results in ANY  of the following:
•Death.
•A life-threatening adverse event (experience). Any AE that places a patient or patient, in 
the view of the Investigator or sponsor, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred. It does NOT  include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death.
•Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (for > 24 hours).
•A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.
•A congenital anomaly or birth defect.
•Important Medical Event (IME) that, based upon medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above.

10 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING
This study will be reviewed at the scheduled RPCI data and safety monitoring committee 
meetings and the minutes are forwarded to the IRB for review.
11 STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY
11.1 Sample Size Determination and Analysis
In a Phase II and Phase III study of single agent topotecan or single agent irinotecan as shown in 
Table 1  in recurrent SCLC, the median time to progression of the arms were 2.2 - 4 months.
6,8-12 
Based on this, the primary endpoint of this trial will be the proportion of patients who are progression-free at 18 weeks. Progression-free survival was chosen as the primary endpoint, rather than response rate, as this is appropriate clinical endpoint for cytotoxic agents such as NKTR-102 and for SCLC.  A single-stage design will be used to assess the primary endpoint for each patient group. A treatment success was defined as a patient who was progression-free at 18 weeks. To evaluate Group A, the largest success proportion where the proposed treatment regimen would be considered ineffective in this population is 5%, and the smallest that would warrant further subsequent studies is 25%. Twenty evaluable patients will be entered on this study. If 2 or fewer successes are observed, this regimen will be considered ineffective in this patient population. If 3 or more successes are observed, this will be considered evidence that this treatment may be recommended for further testing in subsequent studies. Assuming that the APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/16/2017

and has 90% power to detect 25% 18-week PFS rate. To evaluate Group B, the largest success proportion where the proposed treatment regimen would be considered ineffective in this population is 10%, and the smallest that would warrant further subsequent studies is 35%. Eighteen evaluable patients will be entered on this study. If 3 or fewer successes are observed, 
this regimen will be considered ineffective in this patient population. If 4 or more successes are observed, this will be considered evidence that this treatment may be recommended for further testing in subsequent studies. Assuming that the number of successes is binomially distributed, this design controls the Type I Error to be < 10% and has 90% power to detect 25% 18-week PFS rate. Patients who come off study (e.g., due to toxicity) and start an off-protocol therapy prior to 18 weeks will be considered failures at that point.
The evaluable population is defined as patients who meet eligibility requirements and receive 
any protocol treatment. Unevaluable patients will be replaced.
Progression-free survival is defined as the time from registration to the date of first documented 
disease progression or death. Survival time is defined as the time from registration to death due to any cause. Patients who loss-to-follow-up or aliv e at time of analysis will be censored at the 
last contact of known alive. The distribution of time to disease progression and survival time will be estimated in each group using the method of Kaplan–Meier. Probability of PFS at 18 weeks and 24 week and probability of survival at 3, 6, and 9 months will be estimated. All eligible and treated patients will be included in the analysis of the primary endpoint.
All adverse events, regardless of attribution, will be summarized (overall and by group).

11.2 Randomization
This is a nonrandomized study. No randomization scheme will be generated. Subjects will be 
assigned to each group based on their relapsed time.
11.3 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Descriptive statistics (as appropriate: n, percent, mean, median, min and max) will be used to 
summarize demographic and baseline characteristics.
11.4 Efficacy Analysis
Objective tumor response will be tabulated overall (and by dose level if appropriate). Best 
Response is defined to be the best objective status recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient’s best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria. The RECIST 1.1 criteria will be used for solid tumor evaluation and patients will be re-evaluated every other cycle. Responses will be summarized by simple descriptive summary statistics delineating complete and partial responses as well as stable and progressive disease in the cohorts (overall and by tumor group).APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/16/2017

01/27/2017 Page 57 of 6811.5 Safety Analysis
As per NCI CTCAE v 4.0, the term toxicity is defined as adverse events that are classified as 
either possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment. Non-hematologic toxicities will be evaluated via the ordinal CTC standard toxi city grading. Hematologic toxicity measures of 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and leukopenia will  be assessed using continuous variables as 
the outcome measures (primarily nadir) as well as categorization via CTC standard toxicity grading. Overall toxicity incidence as well as t oxicity profiles by dose level, patient and tumor 
site will be explored and summarized. Frequency distributions, graphical techniques and other descriptive measures will form the basis of these analyses.
11.6 Adverse Event
The number and severity of all adverse events (overall, by regimen, and by dose level if 
appropriate) will be tabulated and summarized. The Grade 3+ adverse events will also be described and summarized in a similar fashion. This will provide an indication of the level of tolerance for this treatment combination in this patient group.
12 CORRELATIVE DATA ANALYSIS
Correlation between correlative study (pharmacogene tic analysis) and other outcome measures 
like toxicity and response will be carried out in an exploratory manner as described below.
12.1 Pharmacogenetic Analysis
The genes that have been associated with irinotecan pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic 
pathways include those responsible for activation, inactivation and transport of the drug. These genes include ABCB1 , ABCC2 , ABCG2 , BCHE , CES1 , CES2 , CYP3A4 , CYP3A5 , SLCO1B1 , 
TOP1, UGT1A1 , 1A3,1A4,1A6, 1A7 ,1A8, 1A9 and UGT1A10 . As NKTR-102 is a conjugate of 
irinotecan, most of the irinotecan pathway genes may interact with it thus resulting in similar phenotypic effects. Hence, several genetic variants associated with the pathways may contribute to the clinical outcome of NKTR-102 therapy. Some of the well-known genetic variants that 
have been associated with irinotecan clinical outcomes include the polymorphic repeat in UGT1A1  promoter region ( UGT1A1*28, rs8175347; UGT1A1*93) and the ABCB1  (1236C > T, 
2677G > T/A, 3435C > T), ABCC2  (-24C > T, 1249G > A, 3972C > T), and ABCG2  (34G > A, 
421C > A) polymorphisms. It is reported that n early 50% of the variations in neutropenia among 
individuals could be explained by a combin ation of genetic polymorphisms and non-genetic 
covariates, with gene combinations attributing to 28% of the variations, suggesting a polygenenic basis for neutropenia.
32 UGT1A1*28  and *93 genotypes have been associated with toxicity; 
ABCC2  3972C > T with severe diarrhea in both Korean and European patients while 
SLCO1B1*5  allele is reported to be associated with increased risk of severe neutropenia in 
Asians, and the SLCO1B1*1b  allele is suggested to be protective of neutropenia.32-35
This Phase I study will initially focus, in an exploratory manner, on the primary genes which will 
activate (CES1, CES2, CYP3A4, CYP3A5) and inactivate  (UGT1A1) NKTR-102 . It is 
hypothesize that germline polymorphic variants in CES1, CES2, CYP3A4, CYP3A5  and UGT1A1 
may affect toxicity as well as response to NKTR-102 therapy.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/16/2017

Information (NCBI), HapMap and/or the Genome Variation Server databases using the 
Caucasian SNP information for these 5 genes in addition to using SNPs previously reported in literature. These SNPs will be selected with sufficient frequency that its impact on the clinical outcome at a population level would be meaningful and have some degree of likelihood to alter the function of the gene in a biologically relevant manner. Fifty-three SNPs have been identified for genotyping.
Genotyping: The tagSNPs will be genotyped using the MassARRAY Compact system 
(Sequenom) at RPCI as previously described.36 Whenever possible, published methods and 
primers will be used for polymorphic variants such as UGT1A1*28 .
13 ETHICAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS

for further processing is allowed.
The Investigator shall provide a copy of the information sheet and of the signed consent form to 
the subject and the signed original shall be maintained in the Investigator File. A copy of the signed consent form must be filed in the subject file. At any stage, the subject may withdraw from the study and such a decision will not affect any further treatment options.
14 STUDY RESPONSIBILITIES
14.1 Data Collection
Data entry into the database is to be completed in a timely fashion (approximately within 
28 days) after the subject’s clinic visit. If an AE is considered serious it is captured on both the Adverse Event page and the Serious Adverse Event Form, which is handled in an expedited fashion.
Data management activities will be performed using EXPeRT. EXPeRT is a suite of software 
tools that enables the collection, cleaning and viewing of clinical trial data. CRS data management will design the study-specific database and facilitate its development by the EXPeRT Information Technology team. Once the database design is approved by the Investigator, Statistician, and Clinical Research Coordinator, the database will be put into production and data entry can begin. Data can be entered and changed only by those with the rights to do so into the eCRFs. EXPeRT is compliant with all relevant technical aspects of relevant GCP guidelines.
•The system can generate accurate copies of stored data and audit trail information in human readable form.
•System access is limited to authorized individuals through the controlled assignment of unique ID and password combinations.
•The system is designed to periodically force users to change their passwords and verifies that user ID and password combinations remain unique.
•The system automatically generates a permanent time-stamped audit trail of all user interactions.
When data entry is complete, data management will review the data and will query any missing, 
incomplete, or invalid data points for resolution by the Clinical Research Coordinator and Investigator. Once all queries have been resolved, the data can be released to the statistician for analysis.
14.2 Maintenance of Study Documents
Essential documents should be retained per RPCI’s policy for 6 years from the study termination 
date. These documents could be retained for a longer period, however, if required by the applicable local regulatory requirements or by an agreement with RPCI. It is the responsibility of RPCI to inform the Investigator/ institution as to when these documents no longer need to be APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/16/2017

 iii SYNOPSIS  
 
This is a p ilot p hase II study evaluating the clinical activity and safety of  Enzalutamide (formerly  
known as MDV3100) a novel androgen rece ptor (AR) inhibitor in men with high -risk prostate 
cancer who have undergone local definitive therapy with radical prostatectomy. Despite the 
limitations of interpreting PSA outcome in this clinical setting, time to disease progression (TTP) 
(serologic progression ) was selected as the primary endpoint of the trial. Traditional secondary 
endpoints in this setting will include tolerability and safety. All eligible patients will receive 
enzalutamide, 16 0mg orally daily  in a 28 -day cycle regimen for 24 months o r until disease 
progression or drug intolerance. Radiographic assessment will be conducted only if patients 
devel op biochemical recurrence.

 1 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1. Primary Objectives  
 
1.1.1.  To evaluate the clinical efficacy of enzalutamide  in patients with high -risk 
prostate cancer  with regards to:  
 
1.1.1.1.  Time to disease progression defined by biochemical recurrence ( BCR) 
 
1.2. Secondary Objectives  
 
1.2.1.  To further evaluate the safety of enzalutamide in patients with high -risk prostate 
cancer  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Disease  
Prostate cancer is the second -leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States. 
It is expected that more than 2 41,74 0 new cases will be diagnosed in 201 2. [1] Despite 
the widespread use of prostate -specific antigen (PSA) screening, a significant number of 
patients are diagnosed with high -risk or local ly advanced disease.  
 
Existing risk -stratification criteria including more contemporary tools have permitted us 
to define this population at risk for systemic disease. [ 2, 3] To date, pathological stage, 
Gleason Score (GS) and nodal disease after surgery remain the most common features 
used to determine the risk of recurrence after radical prostatectomy . According to the 
preoperative D ’Amico criteria, RP alone in patients with high -risk PCa leads to a cure in 
about 50% of cases. [ 3] Although quite heteroge neous, recurrence is mostly due to 
distant micrometastases and is often manifested first by a rising PSA. The goal of 
adjuvant therapy is to control and/or treat distant micrometastases, delay/avoid 
progression and ultimately improve survival. Outside of p ost-operative radiation 
therapy  (RT) for those with node negative high -risk disease, no standard adjuvant 
systemic treatments after surgery exist. Existing data using adjuvant androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT) significantly improves survival in patients w ith positive lymph 
nodes. [ 4, 5] The limitation of this data however is the lack of understanding of the 
appropriate timing to initiate ADT  and the known long -term complications of 
testosterone suppression .  In the case of negative lymph nodes, the surviva l advantage 
has not been demonstrated. [ 6]  
 
Similar data exist with chemotherapy when offered to high -risk patients in the peri -
operative setting . [7, 8] Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been studied in multiple phase 
2 trials. Despite  the heterogeneity  in th e chemotherapy regimen, the utility of this 
approach is quite limited. Although chemotherapy prior to surgery appears to be safe, 
no pathological complete response (pCR) has been observed. Similarly, time to PSA 
CCF- Adjuvant Enzalutamide in High -risk PCa  
Protocol Version # 13:08JUN20 15 
 2 progression and overall survival remained un affected. [ 9-13] Two large studies have 
addressed the role of adjuvant therapy for high -risk disease. The first one, TAX305 
unfortunately  closed due to  pour  accrual. [14] This trial randomized patients to either 
observation or treatment. Patients on the tr eatment arm were randomized to receive 
standard androgen  deprivation therapy +/ - 6 cycles of docetaxel based chemotherapy. 
Cross over to the treatment arm was allowed at the time of biochemical recurrence 
(BCR) for patients initially rando mized to the obse rvation  arm.  A similar trial, SWOG 
(Southwest Oncology Group) S9921 randomly assigned 983 men with high -risk features 
at prostatectomy to receive adjuvant therapy with androgen deprivation (ADT) alone or 
in combination with mitoxantrone chemotherapy. ADT c onsisted of goserelin and 
bicalutamide for 2 years. SWOG 9921 was closed to further accrual after three cases of 
acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were reported of a total of 487 patients in the 
mitoxantrone treatment arm. [15] Although the final primary tr eatment comparison 
results have not been published, a report by Dorff et al [16] reported the outcome of 
patients receiving ADT -alone (n=485). The estimated 5 -year biochemical failure -free 
survival was 92.5% (95% CI, 90 to 95), and 5 -year overall survival was 95.9% (95% CI, 
93.9 to 97.9).  
 
Radiotherapy has been another modality commonly employed to treat patients with 
high -risk disease after RP. The rationale for immediate adjuvant RT is to gain local 
control by eradicating residual tumor  in patients with u ndetectable PSA but featuring 
high -risk pathologic features (eg, high Gleason score, extraprostatic extension,  seminal 
vesicle invasion  [SVI], and positive surgical margins (PSM). Two recent, large, 
randomised trials demonstrated the impact of this approac h in this cohort of patients. 
Adjuvant RT decreases biochemical recurrence risk with improved local control, delays 
time to metastases, time to ADT initiation and in the intergroup US trial improvement in 
OS. [17-19] 
 
Despite of the existing data, the mana gement of high -risk patients remains a major 
clinical challenge. There is no convi ncing evidence that either systemic therapies or local 
adjuvant RT truly impact outcome. As such, most patients in the US elect to undergo 
observation. Understanding  the risk  of recurrence in this cohort of patients, there is a 
pressing need to develop novel and non toxic therapies that can be utilized in the 
adjuvant setting with the goal of reducing the risk if recurrence and to improve overall 
survival.  
 
2.2 Enzalutamide and An drogen Receptor  
The androgen receptor (AR) is a well -known target in prostate cancer as disease growth 
is initially dependent on androgens. Depleting or blocking androgen action has been a 
mainstay of treatment for over 6 decades in the setting of metastat ic disease or when 
prostate cancer recurs following resection and/or radiation. In addition, AR expression 
has been noted in a variety of breast cancers and an emerging body of data suggests 
that tumor growth may be promoted through the AR. Enzalutamide is an androgen 
receptor signaling inhibitor (ARSI) rationally designed to block multiple steps in the AR 
CCF- Adjuvant Enzalutamide in High -risk PCa  
Protocol Version # 13:08JUN20 15 
 3 signaling pathway and to be devoid of agonist activity. Enzalutamide  inhibits androgen -
induced receptor activation (binding of androgens to ARs in the cy tosol), inhibits nuclear 
translocation of activated ARs, and inhibits the association of the activated AR with 
chromatin, even in the setting of AR overexpression and in prostate cancer cells 
resistant to anti -androgens such as bicalutamide. The consequenc e of enzalutamide  AR 
signaling inhibition is decreased growth of prostate cancer cells, induction of cancer cell 
death, and tumor regression. The apoptotic effect of enzalutamide  is consistent with AR 
blockade. Enzalutamide  induces cleavage of poly (adenos ine diphosphate -ribose) 
polymerase (PARP), a marker of apoptosis, in prostate cancer cells while bicalutamide 
treatment has no effect on PARP cleavage . [20] In a mouse xenograft model of 
castration -resistant prostate cancer, enzalutamide  dose -dependently r educed tumor 
volume while bicalutamide treatment showed no significant benefit [Investigator ’s 
Brochure 2012].  
 
2.3 Non Clinical and Clinical Data  
2.3.1 Non Clinical  
Safety pharmacology studies in mice, rats, and dogs were performed with enzalutamide  
to assess  any a cute effects on central nervous system, respiratory, and cardiovascular 
parameters. No  enzalutamide -related effects were note d in the central nervous system 
study assessing a  functional observation battery and in a respiratory study in rats. 
Enzalutamide  inhibits the human  ether -a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel; however, 
the highest free concentrations of  enzalutamide  expected in patient plasma at a steady -
state dose of 160 mg/day are well below the  hERG IC50 value. No enzalutamide -related 
effects on ca rdiac electrophysiology were noted in a  safety pharmacology study in 
conscious, telemetered dogs.   
 
As enzalutamide  inhibits the GABA -gated chloride channel, convulsion potential was 
assessed in  single - and multiple -dose studies in mice . [21]. Oral enzalut amide  daily for 7 
days was  associated with convulsions in a dose -dependent manner with doses ≥200 
mg/kg being active.  When administered as a single dose of 400 mg/kg enzalutamide  
treatment was also associated with  convulsions. At the highest dose at which no 
convulsions occurred (single dose, 100 mg/kg), the  maximum plasma concentration 
(Cmax) and area under the curve at 24 hours after dosing  (AUC24) were at least 2.5 -
times higher than those in patients receiving 160 mg/day.  Enzalutamide  is metabolized 
prim arily to 2 metabolites, M1 (a carboxylic acid derivative) and M2  (N-desmethyl 
enzalutamide ). The metabolite M2 has a pharmacology profile similar to that of the  
parent molecule and may contribute to the therapeutic effects of enzalutamide  in 
patients. M2  also binds to and inhibits the GABA -gated chloride channel with potency 
similar to that of the  parent molecule and may contribute to convulsion risk. Metabolite 
M1 does not have  significant pharmacological actions and probably does not contribute 
to the the rapeutic effects  of enzalutamide . 
 
2.3.2 Clinical  
The pharmacokinetics (PK), tolerability, and antitumor activity of enzalutamide  were 
CCF- Adjuvant Enzalutamide in High -risk PCa  
Protocol Version # 13:08JUN20 15 
 4 first studied in a multi -center, open -label, first -in-human, dose -escalation study in 140 
patients with castration -resistant pr ostate cancer (S -3100 -1-01) [Scher, 2010]. Patients 
who were chemotherapy -naïve or who had previously failed docetaxel -based 
chemotherapy were treated with enzalutamide  at doses of 30 to 600 mg/day until 
disease progression or intolerable side effects deve loped. Enzalutamide  was absorbed 
rapidly after oral administration, with the time to Cmax after a single dose typically 
occurring at 1 -hour post dose . No major deviations from dose proportionality were 
observed over the dose range 30 to 600 mg. Due to the long t1/2 (~ 5.8 days) ; it took 
approximately 1 month to reach steady state. With daily oral administration, 
enzalutamide  accumulation was observed at steady state with an 8.3 -fold higher 
exposure (steady -state AUC) relative to a single dose. Based on the mean peak -to-
trough ratio, the average difference between the peak (Cmax) and trough (Cmin) 
concentrations was ≤ 25%. As a result of the low daily fluctuations, plasma profiles at 
steady -state resembled a constant infusion. The Cmin values in individual patients 
remained constant beyond Day 28 of chronic therapy, suggesting time -linear PK once 
steady state was achieved.  
 
The maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 240 mg daily. Enzalutamide  
demonstrated antitumor activity across endpoints in patients both with and without 
previous exposure to chemotherapy. The antitumor activity  endpoints included 
prostate -specific antigen (PSA) reduction from baseline, median time to PSA 
progression, responses on imaging, and circulating tumor cell conversion from favorable 
to unfavorable counts. Three potential enzalutamide -associated toxicitie s were 
identified in this study: fatigue, rash, and seizure. Three seizures (2 witnessed, 1 
unwitnessed) occurred in this study at doses of 360, 480, and 600 mg/day, and were 
reported between 26 and 48 days after initiation of enzalutamide .  
 
After review of all data available from the S -3100 -1-01 study, the optimal dose of 
enzalutamide  for evaluation in Phase 3 clinical trials was determined to be 160 mg/day. 
A Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled efficacy and safety study of 
oral enzaluta mide  (160mg daily) in patients with progressive castration -resistant 
prostate cancer (CRPC) previously treated with docetaxel -based chemotherapy (CRPC2, 
also known as AFFIRM) was conducted in 1199 men, 800 of whom received treatment 
with enzalutamide . 
 
A formal interim analysis of overall survival was performed at 520 events (80% of the 
650 targeted number of events for final analysis) and demonstrated a statistically -
significant increase in the duration of survival among patients treated with 
enzalutamide  compared with patients treated with placebo [hazard ratio = 0.631 (95% 
CI 0.529, 0.752), p < 0.0001]. Median survival was 18.4 months in the enzalutamide  arm 
and 13.6 months in the placebo arm ( Ä = 4.8 months). The survival benefit was seen in 
all pre -spec ified patient subgroups defined by age, geographic region, ECOG 
performance status, pain score, Gleason score, number of prior chemotherapy 
regimens, type of disease progression at study entry, baseline level of PSA, baseline 
CCF- Adjuvant Enzalutamide in High -risk PCa  
Protocol Version # 13:08JUN20 15 
 5 level of hemoglobin, and basel ine level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). There were also 
statistically -significant increases in radiographic progression -free survival (assessed by 
CT or MRI and by bone scan); time to first skeletal -related event; time to PSA 
progression; PSA response, a nd overall objective soft tissue radiographic response 
among patients treated with enzalutamide  compared to placebo. In addition, 
statistically -significant differences favoring enzalutamide  over placebo in pain palliation 
and pain progression rate at Week 13 were also observed.  
 
2.4 Enzalutamide Key Safety Summary Information  
The safety and tolerability of enzalutamide  have been evaluated in 13 studies, including 
2 completed studies (Phase 1), 7 active studies (Phase 1 through 3), and 4 enrolling 
studies  (Phase  2 through 3). It is estimated that a total of 124 healthy volunteers, 16 
subjects with hepatic impairment, and approximately 1800 patients with prostate 
cancer have been exposed to enzalutamide  in completed, open -label, and ongoing 
blinded studies. In the  completed interim analysis of the randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled Phase 3 efficacy and safety study in patients with progressive 
castration -resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel -based 
chemotherapy (CRPC2), 800 patients r eceived enzalutamide  (160 mg daily). The 
duration of enzalutamide  exposure in this study ranged from 1 day to 23.3 months 
(median 8.3 months).  
  
Safety data are presented from the formal interim analysis of data from the CRPC2 
study, with a data cut -off da te of 25 September 2011. Table 1 provides an overview of 
exposure to study drug, adverse events, and deaths.

Protocol Version # 13:08JUN20 15 
 6 study  of 1199 patients with progressive castration -resistant prostate cancer previously 
treated with  docetaxel -based chemotherapy. Adverse events reported by those treated 
with enzalutamide  (160  mg daily) with an incidence of at least 5% and by at least 2% greater 
than by those who  received placebo included fatigue (33.6% v 29.1%), diarrhea (21.4% v 
17.5%), hot flush  (20.3% v 10.3%), musculoskeletal pain (13.6% v 10.0%), headache (11.6% v 
5.5%), i nsomnia  (8.6% v 6.0%), anxiety (6.4% vs. 4.0%), hypertension (6.1% v 2.8%), and 
nasopharyngitis  (5.1% v 3.0%).  Other adverse events reported less commonly than 5% but 
that may be associated with  enzalutamide  treatment after careful assessment of the 
advers e events include: falls (4.0% vs.  1.3%), dry skin (3.6% vs. 1.3%), and pruritus (3.5% vs. 
1.3%).  
 
A greater proportion of patients  in the enzalutamide  -treated group (4.1% vs. 1.8%) 
reporting the following adverse event terms:  memory impairment, cognitive  disorder, 
amnesia, disturbance of attention, and dementia. In  addition, event terms related to 
hallucination (visual hallucination  and tactile hallucination) were reported more frequently 
in the enzalutamide  -treated group (1.6% vs. 0.3%).  Serious adverse  events that occurred at 
a ≥ 0.5% absolute difference in event frequency and  more frequently in the enzalutamide  
arm than the placebo arm included: spinal cord compression  (6.0% vs. 3.8%), bone pain 
(1.5% vs. 1.0%), metastatic pain (1.5% vs. 0.8%), patholo gical  fracture (1.5% vs. 0.5%), 
urinary tract infection (0.9% vs. 0.3%), and cauda equina syndrome  (0.8% vs. 0.0%).  Seizure 
is a known potential toxicity of enzalutamide . In vitro studies have shown that Enzalutamide  
and its metabolite M2 bind to the GABA -gated chloride channel with IC50 values of 1.2 
ìg/mL  and 3.3 ìg/mL, respectively and in a cell -based assay inhibit the channel ’s activity with 
IC50  values of 1.4 ìg/mL and 1.07 ìg/mL, respectively. Some compounds that inhibit the 
GABA -gated  chloride channe l are associated with seizures . [21] In the first clinical study of 
enzalutamide  (S-3100 -1-01), a dose -escalation study in men with  castration -resistant 
prostate cancer with and without prior exposure to chemotherapy, the  following doses 
were evaluated: 30 , 60, 150, 240, 360, 480 (as 240 mg twice per day [BID]),  and 600 (as 300 
mg BID) mg/day. Three patients were reported to have dose -limiting toxicities  of seizure, 
one each at doses of 360, 480, and 600 mg/day. The results of this study led to the  selectio n 
of the clinical dose of  Enzalutamide  of 160 mg/day.  
 
As of the database cut -off date for the respective unblinded or open -label studies reported 
in the  Investigator ’s Brochure, 7 patients out of a total of 1100 patients (0.6%) exposed to 
enzalutamide  at a dose of 160 mg/day have reported a seizure during the enzalutamide  
treatment emergent  adverse event reporting period. These include one patient each in 
studies 9785 -CL-0007 and  9785 -CL-0321, and 5 patients in the CRPC2 study. Two additional 
patients have  been identified  by the Sponsor to have experienced adverse events that may 
have been seizures, including one  case reported by the Investigator as syncope (CRPC2) and 
the other reported as a transient  ischemic attack with an abnormal electroencephalogram 
(CRPC -MDA -1). As of the data cut -off date, treatment with enzalutamide  at a daily dose of 
160 mg is associated with a 0.6 -0.8% risk of  seizure in men with late-stage castration -
resistant prostate cancer. Taking into account  information from ongoing blinded studies and 
events occurring after the database cut -off date, the range for seizure risk is unchanged. No

Protocol Version # 13:08JUN20 15 
 7 seizures have been reported in the blinded placebo  controlled  Phase 3 study PREVAIL with 
over 1300 patients enrolled  (randomized 1:1 to enzalutamide  160 mg/day or placebo). One 
additional patient in the CRPC2  study has been reported to have had a seizure after the 
safety data cut -off date, and one  additional patient in an ongoing blinded study (9785 -CL-
0222) has also reported a seizure.  Please see the m ost current version of the Investigator 
Brochure for additional details.  
 
3 Rationale  
The current standard  of care for men with high -risk prostate cancer after radical 
prostatectomy is observation  or adjuvant RT . Although RT has demonstrated to impact 
outcom e, timing of this technique remains controversial. Similarly, the utility of RT for men 
with high -risk disease with microscopic disease in lymph nodes remains unknown. ADT for 
this patient population also remains controversial due to the long -term complica tions 
related to early testosterone suppression. The existing clinical data with enzalutamide in the 
castrate -resistant setting is quite robust and provides the support to test this novel AR 
inhibitor in an earlier state of the disease with the goal of imp roving outcome in patients 
with high -risk disease who m are destined to develop systemic disease.

6 Treatment Plan  
6.1 Identity of Investigational Product  
Enzalutamide has the chemical nam e 3-(4-cyano -3-trifluoromethylphenyl) -1-[3-fluoro -4- 
(methylcarbamoyl)  phenyl] -5,5-dimethyl -2-thioxoimidazolin -4-one. It is a white to off -
white solid that is insoluble in water and no salt forms are available at ~pH 2 to 10. The 
drug substance is formulat ed in the surfactant caprylocaproyl polyoxylglycerides, or 
Labrasol ®. The product will be supplied as white to off white gelatin capsules containing 
40 mg of enzalutamide.  
 
6.2 Agent Administration  
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis and wil l consist of 28 -day cycles.    
A delay of cycle due to holidays, weekends, and bad weather or other unforeseen 
circumstances will be permitted and not counted as a protocol deviation.  
 
6.2.1 Patients will receive daily oral therapy with enzalutamide at 160mg (4 c apsules) 
orally once daily (QD). Patients will continue on study until progressive disease, 
drug intolerability, consent withdrawal or completion of study at 24 months.  
 
6.2.2 Enzalutamide tablets should be taken at approximately the same time of day and 
at regu lar intervals (i.e., approximately every 24 hours). If a patient misses a dose 
of study drug, he may take the missed dose at any time up to 6 hours before the 
next intended dose on that day and should not be taken on a subsequent day. 
Patients will be inst ructed to notify study site personnel of any missed doses . 
CCF- Adjuvant Enzalutamide in High -risk PCa  
Protocol Version # 13:08JUN20 15 
 11  
6.2.3 Enzalu tamide can be taken with or without food  
 
6.3 Treatment Compliance  
At all times, when dispensing study drug, research center personnel will review the 
instructions, printed on the packaging, wit h subjects. Subjects will be asked to maintain 
a diary to record the drug administration. Subjects will be asked to bring any unused 
study drug and empty bottles to the research center at their next visit. Research 
personnel will count and record the numbe r of used and unused study drug capsules at 
each visit .   Regardless of the reason, the maximum time off enzalutamide allowed will 
be 21 consecutive days.  
 
6.4 Dose Reduction/Dose Adjustment  
Patients who experience a Grade (G) 3 or greater toxicity that cannot  be ameliorated by 
the use of adequate medical intervention may have their treatment interrupted until 
the toxicity improves to a Grade 2 or lower severity. Patients may subsequently be re -
started on study drug at a reduced dose as per Section 8. 
 
6.5 Manageme nt of Overdose  
An overdose is defined as 2 days of study drug taken over the course of a 24 hour 
period. Neither the effects of overdose of enzalutamide nor an antidote to overdose are 
known. In case of overdose of enzalutamide, symptomatic treatment with frequent 
monitoring is recommended.  
 
6.6 General Concomitant Mediations and Supportive Care Guidelines  
Medication taken within 4 weeks prior to enrollment  and any medications prescribed 
chronically or intermittently during the study or dose adjustments of thes e medications 
must be captured on the research nurse notes. Concomitant medications will be 
assessed at screening and all clinic visits. The dosage and regimen of the following 
medications and any chronic permitted concomitant medications should be stabili zed 
during the screening period and held constant throughout the study . 
No formal clinical drug -drug interaction studies have been completed with 
enzalutamide.  
In vitro studies show that enzalutamide is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP2C19 with 
lesser inhib itory effects on CYP2B6 and CYP2C9. Substrates of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
and CYP2C19 that have a narrow therapeutic index should be used with caution.  
 
In vitro studies show that enzalutamide is an inhibitor of the efflux transporter 
permeability glycopro tein (P-gp). Use caution when co -administering P -gp substrates 
during enzalutamide treatment.  
 
In vitro studies show that enzalutamide is an inducer of CYP3A4. Induction of CYP3A 
occurs via activation of the nuclear pregnane X receptor (PXR), which is expe cted to 
result in co -induction of CYP2C. Co -administration of enzalutamide with CYP3A or CYP2C  
CCF- Adjuvant Enzalutamide in High -risk PCa  
Protocol Version # 13:08JUN20 15 
 12 substrates may reduce oral bioavailability and/or accelerate elimination of the 
substrates.  
In vitro studies show that enzalutamide is metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4/5. Strong 
inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes may affect enzalutamide exposures. Use caution 
when co -administering strong inhibitors of CYP2C8 or CYP3A4/5 during enzalutamide 
treatment, as enzalutamide concentrations may increase. Use caution wh en co -
administering strong inducers of CYP2C8 or CYP3A4/5 during enzalutamide treatment, 
as enzalutamide concentrations may decrease.  
 
6.7 Prohibited Medications while on Study Drug  
6.7.1 Cytotoxic chemotherapy  
6.7.2 Hormonal therapies (e.g., anti -androgens, abiraterone, estrogens; testosterone ; 
dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], etc.)  
6.7.3 Biologics and vaccines (e.g., sipuleucel -T) 
6.7.4 Any other investigational agent.  
6.7.5 Caution is advised when considering the concomitant use of the following 
medications:  
6.7.5.1  Medications known to lower the seizure threshold. These include but are not 
limited to:  
6.7.5.1.1  Aminophylline/theophylline  
6.7.5.1.2  Atypical antipsychotics (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, 
ziprasidone)  
6.7.5.1.3  Bupropion  
6.7.5.1.4  Lithium  
6.7.5.1.5  Pethidine  
6.7.5.1.6  Phenothiazine antipsychotics (e.g., chlorpromazine, mesoridazin e, 
thioridazine)  
6.7.5.1.7  Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, 
desipramine, doxepin, imipramine, maprotiline, mirtazapine)  
6.7.5.1.8  Substrates of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 that have a 
narrow therapeutic index (e.g., phenytoin, warfarin).  Based on in vitro 
data, enzalutamide is an inhibitor of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and 
CYP2C19 and may be an inducer of CYP3A4  
6.7.5.1.9  Substrates of CYP3A4/5 that have a narrow therapeutic index. Co -
administration of enzalutamide  with CYP3A4/5 substrates may affect 
oral bioavailability and/or elimination of the CYP3A4/5 substrate  
6.7.5.1.10  Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) or strong CYP3A4/5 
inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, grapefruit , 
grapefruit juice  and soft drinks that contain grapef ruit juice ). In vitro 
studies showed that enzalutamide  is metabolized by CYP2C8 and 
CYP3A4/5  
6.7.5.1.11  Sensitive P -gp substrates (e.g., digoxin, fexofenadine). In vitro studies 
show that enzalutamide and metabolite M2 are potential inhibitors of 
P-gp. Co -administrat ion of enzalutamide with P -gp substrates may 
CCF- Adjuvant Enzalutamide in High -risk PCa  
Protocol Version # 13:08JUN20 15 
 13 increase the plasma concentrations of the P -gp substrate.  
 
6.8 Dura tion of Therapy  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue 
until one of the following criteria applies:  
6.8.1 Dise ase progression

6.8.6 Lost to follow up  
6.8.7 Failure to recover from toxicity despite  a dosing interruption of up to 21 days  
6.8.8 Patient decides to withdraw from the study  
6.8.9 General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
6.8.10  Study termination  by the sponsor, IRB, ethics committee, or regulatory agency .  
6.8.11  Death  
 
6.9 Duration of Follow -up 
Patients will be followed for safety purposes for 4 weeks after removal from study or 
until death, whichever occurs first.  Patients removed from study for unacceptable 
adve rse event(s) will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.  
Patients will be followed for progression, via phone call or visit, every 3 months for the 
first year after completing therapy, then every 6 months for 2 years, then ann ually 
thereafter  for 5 years . 
 
6.10 Criteria for Study Discontinuation  Treatment  
Patients will be removed from study when any of the criteria listed in  Section 7.8 
applies.  The reason for study removal and the date the patient was removed must be 
documented in  the medical chart.  
6.10.1  The primary efficacy endpoint is time to disease progression (PSA, radiographic) , 
as defined in Section  13 Patients should ordinarily be maintained on study 
treatment until confirmed serologic or radiographic progression . Study 
treatmen t should be stopped and patients advised regarding available treatment 
options.  
 
7 Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  
7.1 The NCI Cancer Clinical Trials Common Toxicity Criteria (version 4.0) will be  utilized.  
7.2 Toxicity will be evaluated as outlined by the study c alendar [Table 2]  during the course 
of the study.  
7.3 All toxic events should be managed with optimal supportive care  
7.4 Subjects who experience a Grade 3 or greater adverse event that cannot be ameliorated  
by the  use of adequate medical intervention must have enzalutamide interrupted . 
7.5 Enzalutamide  may be  resumed when the adverse event has improved to a Grade 2 or 
CCF- Adjuvant Enzalutamide in High -risk PCa  
Protocol Version # 13:08JUN20 15 
 14 lower  severity. If the adverse  event is considered not related to enzalutamide by the 
investigator, enzalutamide  may be resumed at  the same dose.  
7.6 If the adverse event is considered possibly or probably related to enzalutamide,   
enzalutamide  may be resumed either at the same dose or at a n initial  reduced dose of 
120mg and, if needed, a second reduction to 80 mg once daily,  based on the discretion 
of the i nvestigator.  
7.7 Enzalutamide  must be permanently discontinued if  subject experiences any criteria  
 listed below:  
7.7.1 Any adverse event that is intolerable to the subject and that cannot be 
ameliorated by the use  of adequate medical intervention, or that in the opinion 
of the investigator would lead to  undue risk to the subject if dosing continued  
7.7.2 Any seizure

12 Measurement of Effec t 
12.1 Progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228 -247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter 
(unidimen sional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in 
the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
12.2 PSA progression will be defined by a PSA value > 0.4ng/mL repeated in two 
consecutive occasions  at least 2 weeks apart . 
12.3 Definitions  
12.3.1  Evaluable for Toxicity: All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of 
their first treatment with enzalutamide  
12.3.2  Time to PSA Progression : The start of the time to PSA progression is the day 
treatment is initiated. The end date is the time of PSA progression as defined in 
CCF- Adjuvant Enzalutamide in High -risk PCa  
Protocol Version # 13:08JUN20 15 
 20 section above.  
12.3.2.1  Radiographic Progression -Free Survival  
   A patient is considered to have progressed by scans if  
12.3.2.2  The f irst bone scan with ≥1 new lesions compared to baseline is observed  
12.3.2.3  The first CT A/P with any new evidence of disease as per RECIST 1.1   
     compared with baseline scans.  
 
13 Adverse Events/Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
13.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An adverse  event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject 
administered a study drug and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnorma l laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not related to the study drug.  
An abnormality identified during a medical test (e.g., laboratory parameter, vital 
sign, physical exam) should be defin ed as an AE only if the abnormality meets one of 
the following criteria:  
1. Induces clinical signs or symptoms  
2. Requires active intervention  
3. Requires interruption or discontinuation of study medication  
4. The abnormality or investigational value is clinically sig nificant in the opinion 
of the investigator.  
 
13.2 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAEs)  
An adverse event is considered “serious ” if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
13.2.1.1  Results in death  
13.2.1.2  Is life  threatening (an adverse event is considered “life-threatening ” if, in 
the view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the 
subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event that, 
had it occurred in a more severe  form, might have caused death)  
13.2.1.3  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial 
disruption of the ability t o conduct normal life functions  
13.2.1.4  Results in congenital anomaly, or birth defect  
13.2.1.5  Requires inpatient hospitalization or leads to prolongation of 
hospitalization (hospitalization for treatment/observation/examination 
caused by AE is to be considered as  serious).  
13.2.1.6  Other medically important events.  
 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that 
may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but 
may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes l isted in the definition above. These events, including those that may 
CCF- Adjuvant Enzalutamide in High -risk PCa  
Protocol Version # 13:08JUN20 15 
 21 result in disability/incapacity, should also usually be considered serious. Examples of 
such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blo od dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; 
or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Additionally, Astellas requests 
that all medical events listed in Appendix 3 (Adverse Events Always Considered to be 
Serious), Appendix 4 (Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment) and Appendix  5 
(Common Serious Adverse Events) be reported by the Investigator as SAEs, even if 
none of the above criteria apply.  
 
13.3 Criteria for Causal Relationship to the Study Drug  
Adverse events that fall under eit her "Possible" or "Probable" should be defined as 
"adverse events whose relationship to the study drugs could not be ruled out".  
Table 3.  Adverse Events  
 
Causal relationship to the study drug  Criteria for causal relationship  
 
Not Related  
 A clinical eve nt, including laboratory test abnormality, 
with a  temporal relationship to drug administration 
which makes a causal  relationship improbable, and/or 
in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease 
provide plausible explanations.  
Possible  A clinical e vent, including laboratory test abnormality, 
with a reasonable time sequence to administration of 
the drug, but which  could also be explained by 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. 
Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or 
unclear.  
 
Probable  
 A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, 
with a reasonable time sequence to administration of 
the drug, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease 
or other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a 
clinically reasonable response  on re - administration 
(rechallenge) or withdrawal (dechallenge).  
 
13.4 Criteria for Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event  
Severity of adverse events will be graded according to the Cancer Therapy and 
Evaluation  Program (CTCAE) Common Terminology Criteria f or Adverse Events v. 
4.03. For terms not specified within NCI -CTCAE, the following guideline should be 
used to determine grade:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CCF- Adjuvant Enzalutamide in High -risk PCa  
Protocol Version # 13:08JUN20 15 
 22 Table 4 Criteria for Severity of Adverse Event Terms Not Specified Within 
NCICTCAE  
 
Grade  Description  
Grade 1  Mild; asym ptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or 
diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention 
indicated; limiting age  appropriate instrumental 
activities of daily living.  
Grade 3  Severe or m edically significant but not immediately life -
threatening; hospitalization or prolongation or 
hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self  
care activities of daily living  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention 
indicated.  
Grade 5 Death related to AE.  
 
13.5 General Requirements  
13.5.1  Investigators are required by Federal Regulations to report serious adverse 
events as defined in the table below.  Investigators are required to notify the 
Investigational Drug Branch (IDB), Study Chair, and th eir Institutional Review 
Board if a patient has a reportable serious adverse event (follow guidelines in the 
table below). This study will utilize the Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0 to 
determine the severity of the reaction for adverse event reportin g. 
13.5.2  Reporting requirements and procedures depend upon: (1) whether agents are 
suspected of causing the adverse event, (2) whether the possibility of such an 
adverse event was reported in the protocol, consent form, or manufacturer's 
literature (expected or unexpected adverse event), (3) the severity or grade of 
the adverse event, (4) the phase of the study and attribution (the determination 
of whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or procedure).  
13.5.3  All reactions in a "reportable" category must be reported. Reactions attributable 
to a regimen that includes commercial agents must be reported using the FDA 
Form #3500 (MedWatch).  
 
13.6 Monitoring And Reporting Guidelines  
Data related to these trials are discussed at weekly scheduled study group or s ite 
committee meetings where the result of each patient ’s treatment is discussed. The 
discussion will include for each treatment arm/dose level, the number of patients, 
significant toxicities as described in the protocol, dose adjustments, and responses 
observed.  Additionally, the study team will meet quartly to review protocol and 
evaluate accurance of data entered into the OnCore database.  Twice yearly, 
summaries will be submitted to the Data Monitoring Committee for review.  
 
13.7 Review and Oversight Requirem ents  will be communicated to: XTANDI Adverse 
Event Reporting: 800-888-7704 ext. 8224  or email: safety -us@usastellas.com  
CCF- Adjuvant Enzalutamide in High -risk PCa  
Protocol Version # 13:08JUN20 15 
 23 13.7.1  Adverse Event  – Reported By Phone Within 24 Hours  
13.7.2  Adverse events requiring expedited re porting by phone within 24 hours (as 
described in the protocol) will also be reported by phone to the Clinical Research 
Support Services (CRSS) administrator within one working day.  Confirmation 
that all appropriate parties (including the CCF Committee on  Human Research) 
were notified will be done at this time.  Hardcopies or electronic versions of FDA 
Form #3500 (MedWatch) and/or any other documentation available at that time 
will also be reviewed by the DMC Committee Chair who will determine if 
immediate  action is required. Within ten working days all subsequent SAE 
documentation that is available will be submitted to the DMC Committee Chair 
who will determine if further action is required.  All information will be tracked 
in the Case Comprehensive Cancer  Center ’s database.  
13.7.3  If the AE occurs on a multiple -institutional clinical trial coordinated by the Case 
Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Principal Investigator will insure that all 
participating sites are notified of the event and resulting action within o ne 
working day of the determination.  
13.7.4  Adverse Event  – Reported within 10 Days  
13.7.4.1  Adverse events requiring expedited AE reports in writing within 10 
working days (as described in the protocol) will be sent to the CRSS office. 
Hardcopies or electronic versions of FDA Form #3500 (MedWatch), or other 
required forms will be submitted for review by the DMC Committee Chair to 
determine if further action is required.  This information will be tracked in 
the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center ’s database.  
 
13.8 Study Progress – Quarterly Review  
13.8.1  Principal Investigators are required to submit quarterly study progress reports to 
determine whether accrual projections are being met, to summarize adverse 
reactions reported, and to determine if the trial should be continued based upon  
the likelihood of timely completion.  These quarterly reports are reviewed at 
Data Monitoring Committee meetings.  Failure to submit such reports will result 
in trial suspension.  
13.8.2  An overall assessment of accrual, toxicities as described in the protocol, a nd 
responses will enable the committee members to assess whether significant 
benefits or risks are occurring that would warrant study closure. This information 
is provided by study committee/site committee meeting minutes, internal data 
quality audits, and  annual DMC audits, all of, which is required of all research 
studies at Case Comprehensive Cancer Center.  The committee will also receive 
all external DSMB reports and external data audits and may request further 
information from the Principal Investigat or or Site Committee.  
13.8.3  The Data Monitoring Committee recommendations for modifications to the trial 
or corrective actions are forwarded to the Protocol Review Committee and the 
Clinical Research Steering Committee. The Principal Investigator is notified of this 
recommendation in order that he/she may alert all investigators, at the Case 
Comprehensive Cancer Center and at external sites involved in the trial, about 
CCF- Adjuvant Enzalutamide in High -risk PCa  
Protocol Version # 13:08JUN20 15 
 24 the potential action.  At this time the Principal Investigator may submit to the 
Clinical Resea rch Steering Committee additional information that could affect 
the Committee ’s decision.  The Clinical Affairs Committee will notify the Principal 
Investigator if they concur with the Data Monitoring Committee 
recommendations, including suspension or clos ure.  The DMC Chair will notify all 
investigators involved with the study at Case Comprehensive Cancer Center and 
external sites, the IRB, the sponsor and the funding agency and provide written 
documentation of these notifications to the Clinical Research Steering 
Committee. The Case Comprehensive Cancer Center Clinical Research Steering 
Committee (CRSC), composed of Cancer Center senior leaders oversees these 
activities.  
 
13.9 Review of Adverse Event Rates  
13.9.1  Once a month, adverse event rates will be monitored uti lizing the Case 
Comprehensive Cancer Center Clinical Trials database.  If any study has had two 
or more of the same AE reported in a month or more than six of the same AE in 
six months, the DMC Chair will review the summary of SAEs, discuss events with 
Principal Investigator, and conduct a more detailed review with the Principal 
Investigator or the external DSMB if warranted.  The Committee Chair will 
determine if further action is required. If this occurs on a multiple -institutional 
clinical trial coordina ted by the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Safety 
Coordinator will insure that all participating sites are notified of the resulting 
action . 
13.9.2  Astellas  instructions for rapid notification of serious adverse events  
13.9.3  The principle investigator has the obl igation to report all serious adverse events 
to the FDA, IRB, and XTANDI Adverse Event Reporting: 800-888-7704 ext. 8224  
or email: safety -us@usastellas.com  
13.9.4  All events reported to the FDA by the investigator a re to be filed utilizing the 
Form FDA 3500A (MedWatch Form).  
13.9.5  All events must be reported  to XTANDI Adverse Event Reporting: 800-888-7704 
ext. 8224  or email: safety -us@usastellas.com  within 24 hours of learni ng of its 
occurrence. This includes serious, related, labeled (expected) and serious, 
related, unlabeled (unexpected) adverse experiences. All deaths during 
treatment or within 30 days following completion of active protocol therapy 
must be reported within  5 working days.  
13.9.6  Any serious adverse event occurring after the patient has initiated study 
treatment dosing and until 4 weeks after the patient has stopped dosing study 
drug  must be reported. This includes the period in which the study protocol 
interferes with the standard medical treatment given to a patient (e.g. treatment 
withdrawal during washout period, change in treatment to a fixed dose of 
concomitant medication).  
13.9.7  Serious adverse events occurring more than 4 weeks after last dose of study 
drug  need o nly be reported if a relationship to the Astellas  study drug (or 
therapy) is suspected.  
CCF- Adjuvant Enzalutamide in High -risk PCa  
Protocol Version # 13:08JUN20 15 
 25 13.9.8  For Comparator Drugs/Secondary Suspects (Concomitant Medications), all 
serious adverse experiences will be forwarded to the product manufacturer by 
the investigator.  
 
13.10  Pregnancies  
Any pregnancy that occurs during study participation should be reported. To ensure 
patient safety each pregnancy must also be reported to Astellas  within 24 hours of 
learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up to determine 
outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, and the 
presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities or maternal and 
newborn complications.  
 
14 Statistical Considerations  
14.1 Study Design/Endpoints   
This is a pilot phase II single institutional open label study. The primary endpoint of 
the trial is time to progression, defined by serologic  criteria. That is a PSA value > 0.4 
in two separate occasions  at least two weeks apart .  
 
Secondary endpoints include safety base d on CTCAE version 4.0 3 criteria.  
 
14.2 Statistics  
The primary goal of this trial is to assess the efficacy of enzalutamide in high risk 
patients following radical prostatectomy as measured by the biochemical failure -
free (BFF) interval . Historically the 5 -year BFF interval in this population is 
approximately 55%  (Hernandez et al., Urology,  70:931 -935, 2007) . Assuming the BF 
interval follows an exponential distribution, accrual will take approximately  24 
months . There will be at least 12 months of additional fo llow -up once accrual is 
completed . A sample size of 40 eligible and evaluable  patients is recommended in 
order to have 80% power to detect a 75% decrease in the risk of biochemical failure 
(based on a 2-sided exponential MLE test that makes use of a Normal  
approximation, and a 5% type I error). To allow for a 5% exclusion rate, a total of 42 
patients will be accrued. A secondary goal of the trial is to assess safety. Adverse 
events will be coded and graded according to CTCAE version 4.03 criteria. With 40 
eligible and evaluable  patients the likelihood of a specific type and/or grade of 
adverse event can be estimated using an exact 95% confidence interval that has a 
maximum half -width of 1 7%. BFF interval will be summarized using the Kaplan -
Meier method; and proportional hazards models will be used to  assess the impact of 
factors such as Gleason Score, PSA at diagnosis, seminal vesicle invasion,  and nod al 
status.  
 
14.3 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
The required sample size will be based upon evaluating the primary stud y objective. 
A total of 42 patients, 40 of whom are expected to be eligible and evaluable , will be 
entered into the study and treated with enzalutamide. Similar studies in high -risk 
CCF- Adjuvant Enzalutamide in High -risk PCa  
Protocol Version # 13:08JUN20 15 
 26 populations previously conducted at our institution have accrued an averag e of 2 -3 
patients per month.  Thus it is estimated that 24 months will be required to complete 
total accrual for the clinical trial.

 32 APPENDIX IV 
Liver Safety  Monitoring and A ssessment  
 
If laboratory testing for a subject enrolled in study and receiving study drug reveals an increase 
of serum aminotransferases (AT) to > 3x ULN, or bilirubin > 2x ULN, at least all four of the usual 
serum hepatic measures (ALT, AST, ALP, and TBL)  should be repeated. Testing should be 
repeated within 48 -72 hours of notification of the test results. If applicable, for studies for 
which a central laboratory is used, alerts will be generated by the central lab regarding 
moderate and marked liver abnor mality to inform the investigator, study monitor and study 
team. Subjects should be asked if they have any symptoms suggestive of hepatobiliary 
dysfunction.  
 
Definition of Liver Abnormalities  
Confirmed abnormalities will be characterized as moderate and ma rked where ULN:  
    ALT or AST    Total Bilirubin  
Moderate   > 3x ULN  or >   2x ULN  
Marked   > 3x ULN  and   > 2x ULN  
 
In addition, the subject should be considered to have marked hepatic abnormalities for any of  
the following:  
 ALT or AST > 8x ULN  
 ALT or AST > 5x ULN for more than 2 weeks  
 ALT or AST > 3x ULN and INR > 1.5  
 ALT or AST > 3x ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper  
 quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%).  
 
The investigator may determine that  abnormal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may qualify as moderate or marked abnormalities and require additional monitoring 
and follow -up. Discontinuation of treatment must occur if subject has marked abnormalities. In 
addition, if c lose monitoring for a subject with moderate hepatic laboratory tests is not 
possible, drug should be discontinued.  
 
Follow -up Procedures  
Confirmed moderate and marked abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly 
characterized by obtaining approp riate expert consultations, detailed pertinent history, physical 
examination and laboratory tests. The site should complete the Liver Abnormality Case Report 
Form (LA -CRF) or an appropriate document. Subjects with confirmed abnormal liver function 
testing should be followed as described below.  
Confirmed moderately abnormal LFTs should be repeated 2 -3 times weekly then weekly or less 
if abnormalities stabilize or the study drug has been discontinued and the subject is 
asymptomatic.  
Marked hepatic liver func tion abnormalities, in the absence of another etiology, may be  
considered an important medical event and reported as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE). The  
sponsor should be contacted and informed of all subjects for whom marked hepatic liver

Protocol Version # 13:08JUN20 15 
 33 function abnormal ities possibly attributable to study drug are observed.  
 
To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory findings, the investigator is expected to:  
 Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases. Symptoms 
and new onset -diseases should be recorded as ’adverse events ’ on the AE page of CRF. 
Illnesses and conditions such as hypotensive events, and decompensated cardiac disease 
that may lead to secondary liver abnormalities should be noted. Non -alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) is see n in obese hyperlipoproteinemic, and/or diabetic subjects and 
may be associated with fluctuating aminotransferase levels. The investigator should ensure 
that the medical history form captures any illness that pre -dates study enrollment that may 
be relevant  in assessing hepatic function.  
 Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including non -prescription medication, 
complementary and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and 
special diets. Medications, including dose, should be enter ed on the concomitant 
medication page of CRF. Information on alcohol, other substance use, and diet should be 
entered on the LA -CRF or an appropriate document.  
 Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents  
 Based on the subject ’s history, ot her testing may be appropriate including:  
a. Acute  viral hepatitis (A,B, C, D, E or other infectious agents).  
b. ultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary tract disease  
c. other laboratory tests including INR, direct bilirubin  
 Consider gastroenterology or hepat ology consultations  
 Submit results for any additional testing and possible etiology on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document.  
 
Study Discontinuation  
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFTs, such as viral hepatitis, pre -existing or acute 
liver d isease or exposure to other agents associated with liver injury, the subject may be 
discontinued from the study. The investigator may determine that it is not in the subject ’s best 
interest to continue study enrollment.  
 
Discontinuation of treatment must occur if:  
 ALT or AST > 8x ULN  
 ALT or AST > 5x ULN for more than 2 weeks  
 ALT or AST > 3x ULN and TBL > 2x ULN or INR > 1.5  
 
Discontinuation of treatment should be considered if:  
 ALT or AST > 3x ULN with the appearance of fat igue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%).  
 In addition, if close monitoring for a subject with moderate hepatic laboratory tests is not 
possible, drug should be discontinued.

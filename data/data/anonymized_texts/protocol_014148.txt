Study Title:  A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study of the Efficacy, Safety, 
and Tolerability of Serlopitant for the Treatment of Pruritus in Adults with Plaque 
Psoriasis 
Protocol Number:  MTI-109 
Sponsor:  Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  
Development Phase:  Phase 2  
Study Objectives:  Primary objective: T o assess the efficacy of serlopitant for the treatment of 
pruritus in adults with plaque psoriasis . 
Secondary objectives:  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated oral doses of serlopitant 
in adults with plaque psoriasis.  
• To assess the psychometric properties of Worst -Itch Numeric Rating 
Scale (WI -NRS).  
Study Design:  This is a double -blind, randomized, placebo -contro lled study to assess the 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in 
adults with plaque psoriasis . Subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be 
randomized in a 1 :1 ratio to receive daily oral doses of serlopitant 5 mg or placebo 
for 8 weeks. The study will be conducted at approximately 40 study sites  in North 
America. 
The study will consist of three periods, for a total study period of  approximately 
12 or 14 weeks:  
• Screening period: 2 or 4 weeks   
• Treatm ent period: 8 weeks  
• Follow -up period: 2 weeks  
During the screening period, subjects will undergo eligibility evaluation and will 
have their baseline symptom scores established. Subjects who require a washout of prior therapies per study criteria will perfo rm their Screening visit 4 weeks prior to 
randomization. Subjects who do not require a washout of prior therapies can 
perform the Screening visit 2 weeks prior to randomization. Subjects must be 
willing and able to complete an electronic diary (eDiary) within a consistent 
timeframe on a daily basis, to wear actigraphy devices during sleep,  and to comply 
with restrictions on allowable concomitant therapies for the duration of the study.   
At the B aseline visit, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to r eceive 
serlopitant 5 mg  or placebo. Subjects will take a loading dose (3 tablets taken 
orally) at the site on the first day of the treatment period (Study Day 1). Starting 
on Study Day 2, subjects will take one tablet per day orally . Serlopitant may be 
taken with or without food . 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed at Week 8 of treatment.  
After completion of the treatment period  or early discontinuation of study drug , all 
subjects will enter a 2 week follow -up period.  
Safety Review:  An internal  safety monitoring team consisting of representatives from Menlo 
Therapeutics Inc. and its designees will monitor blinded safety data on a regular basis throughout the study.  
Planned Sample Size:  Approximately 200 subjects will be randomized. 
Study Population:  The study will consist of adults with plaque psoriasis who have pruritus.

Study Drug : Serlopitant 5 mg oral tablets and matching placebo.  
Dosage:  Serlopitant: 5 mg once daily by mouth for 8 weeks, following a 3 -tablet loading 
dose on the first day of the treatment period.  
Matching placebo: Once daily by mouth for 8 weeks, following a 3 -tablet loading 
dose on the first day of the treatment period.  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  The primary efficacy endpoint is the WI-NRS 4 -point responder rate at Week 8. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  The key secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows:  
• WI-NRS 4 -point responder rate at Week 4  
• Change in WI -NRS from baseline to Day 7  
• Change in WI -NRS from baseline to Day 3  
Additional secondary efficacy endpoints include the following:  
• Change in number of night -time scratching events from baseline to Week 
8 
• Change in WI -NRS from baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8  
• The WI-NRS 3 -point responder rate at Weeks 4 and 8  
• Change in Static Patient Global Assessment of Itch Severity (sPGA)  
• Patient Global Impr ession of Change in Itch Severity (PGIC)  
Safety Endpoints:  Safety endpoints include the following:

adverse events (SAEs)  
• Change in clinical laboratory parameters following study drug exposure  
• Changes in vital sign and electrocardiogram ( ECG ) parameters following 
study drug exposure  
• Plasma concentrations of serlopitant and metabolites  
Exploratory Endpoints:  Exploratory endpoints include the following:  
• Change in Body  Surface Area ( BSA ), and Physician Global Assessment 
(PGA) of psoriasis

• Change in sleep efficiency  
• Change in mean activity during the sleep period 
Decision Rule and Sample 
Size The decision rule is based on the Phase 2b screening methodology presented in 
Fleming and Richardson ( Fleming 2004).  This two -category decision guideline 
compares the observed one -sided p- value for the primary endpoint to two 
categories: (0.025, 0. 05) and (0, 0.025].  
• If the one -sided p- value is between 2.5% and 5 % then the serlopitant -
based regimen is plausibly efficacious and should be evaluated definitively in a subsequent Phase 3 clinical trial.   
• If the one -sided p- value is less than 2.5%, then the serlopitant -based 
regimen will have met the generally accepted level of evidence required to demonstrate efficacy.   
The sample size of 1 00 per group has been selected to achieve 90% power for the 
primary endpoint with  
• 5% one -sided alpha and responder rates of 2 4% (placebo) and 43.5% 
(serlopitant)  
• 2.5% one -sided alpha and responder rates of 2 4% (placebo) and 46% 
(serlopitant)  
Testing of the key secondary endpoints  will take place should statistical 
significance be reached for the primary endpoint.  Testing within the key secondary endpoints will be hierarchical with testing starting with the WI -NRS 
Week 4 responder rate, then the Day 7  WI-NRS endpoint , and finally the Day 3 
WI-NRS endpoint.  
Statistical Methods:  Primary e fficacy analyses will be based upon an intent -to-treat (ITT) philosophy.  
The primary efficacy population will be the Full Analysis Set (FAS) which  will 
include all randomized subjects  who received at lea st one dose  of study drug . 
Analyses performed on the Per Protocol (PP) population will be considered 
supportive.  Subjects will be analyzed within the treatment group to which they are 
randomized. 
Efficacy Analyses:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is a binary  variable taking on values of responder 
or non -responder.  Subjects will be considered a responder if they have at least a 4-
point  reduction in WI -NRS between baseline and Week 8. Missing data 
imputation will be used for subjects who fail to complete the eDiary at Week 8. 
The primary endpoint will be summarized with descriptive statistics by treatment group and study week . 
 
The difference in the primary efficacy outcome measure between treatment groups will be tested using  a Cochran Mantel Haenszel  (CMH) test  controlling for the 
stratification factors.  The same test will be used for the Week 4 responder rates. 
Testing , using an analysis of co variance (AN COVA) model , of the  change in WI -
NRS to Day 7 and Day 3 will be employed.

Version 2.0  Page 9 Safety Analyses:  
The incidence of all adverse events ( AEs) and treatment -related AEs will be 
tabulated by treatment received. These AEs will be classified by system organ 
class and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). For incidence reporting, if a subject reported more than one AE that was coded to the same system organ class or preferred term, the subject will be counted only once for that specific system organ class or preferred term. An overview of AEs, which includes subject incidence of AEs, treatment -related AEs, 
AEs by severity, SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to discontinuation, will be presented.  
Clinical safety laboratory values  will be measured by a central laboratory. 
Summary statistics for actual values and for changes f rom baseline will be 
tabulated for laboratory results by scheduled visit. Graphs of laboratory values 
over time will also be produced.   
Subjects with clinical laboratory values outside of the normal reference range at 
any post -baseline assessment will be summarized. Shifts from baseline laboratory 
values will be tabulated.  
The observed vital signs and ECG data and change from baseline for each 
measurement day will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  
Study Sites:  Approximately 40 study sites in North  America.  
Expected Duration of Subject’s Participation  Approximately 12 or 14 weeks: 2 or 4 weeks of screening, 8 weeks of treatment, 
and a follow -up period of  2 weeks.  
 
This study will be conducted in accordance with the Guidelines of Good Clinical Practices (GCPs).

Version 2.0  Page 16 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Psoriasis and Pruritus  
Psoriasis is a chronic, non-communicable, immune- mediated inflammatory disease affecting 
at least 100 million individuals worldwide ( Boehncke 2015; “Global report on 
Psoriasis”  2016). The most common clinical variant is plaque psoriasis (also known as 
“psoriasis vulgaris”), which affects approximately 85 –90% of all patients with psoriasis; this 
typically manifests as raised, well -demarcated erythematous skin plaques with adherent 
silvery scales, which are a result of a hyperprol iferative epidermis with premature maturation 
of keratinocytes and parakeratosis ( Nestle 2009 ). Next to scaling of the skin (reported by 
92% of patients with plaque psoriasis), the most frequently reported symptom is itching 
(reported by 72 –87%) ( “Global report on Psoriasis” 2016).  In a survey of over 3,400 U.S. 
patients with psoriasis, itching was consistently reported as the most influential factor in determining their perception of psoriasis se verity ( Lebwohl 2016).  In addition, pruritus has 
been associated with reduced health care quality of life in psoriasis patients , including 
impaired sleep quality and reduced psychological well -being ( Zhu 2014). 
1.2 Current Treatment Options for Pruritus in the Setting of Psoriasis  
At present, there are no FDA -approved therapies specifically indicated for the treatment of 
psoriatic pruritus.  Treatment of pruritus in patients with psoriasis has traditionally b een 
directed toward resolution of the skin lesions, as disease remission is thought to be associated with pruritus relief.  However, several reports suggest that there may be no clinically meaningful correlation between pruritus severity and psoriasis dise ase severity.  In a study of 
102 patients with plaque-type psoriasis, pruritus was found in 89% of patients; no significant correlation was found between disease severity and presence or intensity of pruritus (Reich  2010).  More recently, Roblin et al ( Roblin 2014) reported baseline data for 
157 psoriatic patients enrolling for a clinical trial; these patients had mild to moderate psoriasis according to Investigator Global Assessment.  Of these, 97% of patients had pruritus, with 34% reporting severe pruritus (VAS score of greater than 70 mm).  These data 
suggest that even when adequate control of psoriasis lesions can be achieved, patients may continue to experience pruritus out of proportion to their visible disease burden.   
Recommendations for available treatments directed specifically to ward reduction of itch in 
psoriatic patients, beyond standard of care psoriasis therapies, include topical agents such as 
bland emollients, pramoxine, menthol or capsaicin; sedating antihistamines such as hydroxyzine; and antidepressants such doxepin or mi rtazapine ( Szepietowski 2016; 
Dawn  2006).  However, with the exception of topical capsaicin ( Ellis 1993) and oral 
mirtazapine ( Hundley 2004), evidence r egarding efficacy with these agents for treatment of 
psoriatic pruritus is limited.  Use of capsaicin and/or mirtazapine may also be limited by safety issues; topical capsaicin should not be applied to broken skin, and the sedative properties of mirtazapin e limit its use during waking hours.

Version 2.0  Page 17 1.3 Substance P and the Neurokinin- 1 Receptor  
Substance P (SP) is an undecapeptide that belongs to the tachykinin family of neuropeptides, 
a group that also includes neurokinin A (NKA) and neurokinin B (NKB) ( Hökfelt 2001). 
SP has been implicated in a number of biological functions, both physiological and pathophysiological, including pruritus perception, vomiting reflex, pain perception, and immunomodulatory responses (Lotts 2014; Andoh 1998; Steinhoff 2014). 
 The biological 
actions of SP are mediated by tachykinin receptors, which consist of seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains coupled to G-proteins. Three tachykinin receptors have been identified : the neurokinin- 1 (NK -1), neurokinin- 2 (NK -2), and neurokinin- 3 (NK -3) 
receptors ( Harrison 2001 ). The NK -1 receptor (NK
1-R) in particular has been studied in great 
detail. NK 1-R is the p rimary receptor for SP in the human body, and is found on multiple cell 
types, include central and peripheral neurons, keratinocytes, and mast cells.  
NK 1-R stimulation has been shown to be an important pathway for pruritus perception 
(Stander 2015). Inhibition of this pathway results in decreased pruritus and scrat ching 
reflexes in animal models ( Akiyama 2015). Preceding the development of serlopitant for 
pruritus- related conditions, a commercially available NK 1-R antagonist (aprepitant, 
Emend) has been used as a therapy to decrease pruritus in patients with chronic pruritus 
due to etiologies such as cutaneous T- cell lymphoma ( Duval 2009; Torres 2012; 
Booken 2011) and erlotinib-induced pruritus ( Santini 2012; Gerber 2010). Additionally, in a 
study of 20 patients with chronic pruritus of various etiologies treated with aprepitant, 16/20 
patients (80%) experienced a considerable reduction of itch intensity ( Stander 2010). 
Radioimmunoassay and immunohistochemical staining studies have demonstrated that biopsies of skin from psoriasis patients contain more neurons immunoreactive for SP, NKA and NK-2 receptors, as well as non-neuronal inflammatory cells positive for SP, NKA, and NK-1 and NK-2 receptors, compared with healthy controls; in addition, numbers of SP positive nerves in plaque- bearing skin are si gnificantly correlated with pruritus intensity 
(Amatya 2011). These findings suggest a role for SP signaling in psoriasis and psoriatic 
pruritus, and are also consistent with the robust body of evidence indicating the key role of SP signaling through its primary receptor, NK
1-R, in the transmission of itch across multiple 
disease states . (Crowe 1994; Santini 2012; Akiyama 2015; El -Nour 2006; Lotts 2014; 
Hon 2007; Ward 2004; Slattery 2011 ). 
1.4 Serlopitant  
1.4.1 Serlopitant Background and Nonclinical Summary  
Serlo pitant is a small molecule, highly selective NK 1-R antagonist that is administered orally 
and metabolized by CYP3A4, with a plasma half -life of 45 –86 hours. It binds with high 
affinity to the human NK 1-R with a dissociation constant (K d) of 46 pM; displacing SP 
binding with a half- maximal inhibition concentration (IC 50) of 61 pM. Serlopitant is a potent 
functional antagonist of SP-induced inositol phosphate generation. 
Serlopitant has been extensively studied in animal toxicology studies, including chronic 
toxicology and carcinogenicity studies. In non-clinical chronic toxicology studies in rats, 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol MTI -109 
 
Version 2.0  Page 18 mice and dogs, treatment related findings of potential clinical significance included increased 
salivation, decreased body weight gain and food consumption, slight changes in hematology and serum biochemistry parameters, mild increases in liver weight and mild histomorphologic changes. The histomorphologic changes were seen only in rats (not in dogs or mice) and included: very slight ovarian interstitial cell hypertrophy, mammary gland and uterine and ovarian atrophy; decreased corpora lutea; increased histiocytes in lung and mesenteric lymph nodes; slight skeletal and cardiac muscle degeneration; slight increased hematopoiesis in bone marrow; and slight to moderate vacuolation in kidney tubules. These nonclinical findings occurred at systemic exposures exceeding those anticipated to provide efficacy of serlopitant for pruritus indications in humans (1 to 5 mg tablet daily). No cardiac lesions have been observed in dog toxicity studies up to 9 months in duration nor in a 3-month mouse range-finding study and 2- year mouse carcinogenicity study at exposure 
higher than the lowest level which caused cardiotoxicity in rats. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL ) in rats for histomorphological changes in the reproductive tract, 
mammary gland and bone marrow provides a 2- fold margin for the maximum- targeted 
exposure (5 mg tablet daily). The rat NOAEL for histomorphological changes in muscle and kidney provides a 4- fold margin for the maximum- targeted exposure (5 mg tablet daily).   
In summary, the nonclinical toxicity noted with serlopitant provides no contraindications to the continuation of clinical trials via the oral route. Findings in the developmental toxicity  
studies support inclusion of women of childbearing potential in clinical trials in accordance with the study protocol and local regulatory guidances.  
1.4.2 Serlopitant Clinical Data in Phase 1 and Non- Pruritus Studies  
In humans, serlopitant has been administered to over 1000 individuals. Single doses up to 
400 mg have been well tolerated in healthy young adult males and single doses up to 25 mg have been well tolerated in the elderly. Multiple doses of up to 50 mg a day for 4  weeks have 
been well tolerated in healthy young  adult males , and a single (loading) dose of 15 mg 
followed by daily doses of 5 mg for 2  weeks have been well tolerated in elderly males and 
females.  Multiple daily doses of 4 mg liquid filled capsule (LFC) (bioequivalent to 5 mg 
tablets) for 1  year have been well tolerated in adult males and females with overactive 
bladder ( OAB ).
 Plasma concentrations  of serlopitant appear to increas e in a dose-
proportional fashion up to 35 mg in  both young adult and elderly  subjects ( with no 
gender differences ). Peak plasma concentrations after  a single  oral dose occurred  at ~2 to 
4 hours in both young adult and elder ly subjects . 
In a Phase 2 study examining treatment of OAB  (Study P003) , the most common AEs during 
the initial 8 -week base period across all treatment groups were headache (5.7%), diarrhea 
(5.2%), urinary tract infection (4.7%), dry mouth (4.5%), nasopharyngitis (4.5%), upper respiratory tract infection (4.3%), fatigue (4.1%), dizziness (3.8%), back pain (2.9%), nausea (2.3%), and peripheral edema (2.2%).  
1.4.3 Serlopitant in Pruritus -Related Studies  
Serlopitant has been evaluated in two completed Phase 2 studies of subjects  with chronic 
pruritus (TCP -101 and TCP-102).  
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol MTI -109 
 
Version 2.0  Page 19 TCP-101 
TCP-101 was a double-blind, placebo- controlled, multi -center study that c ompared 
serlopitant 0.25 mg, 1 mg, or 5 mg vs. placebo for the treatment of chronic pruritus . A total 
of 257 adult subjects  18–65 years of age with chronic pruritus were randomized to receive 
one of the four dose groups in a 1:1:1:1 randomization. Subjects  received a loading dose of 
3 tablets on Day 1 and thereafter received 1 tablet per day for 6  weeks. The primary efficacy 
endpoint was itch severity as measured on a VAS, summarized as a percentage change from 
baseline.  
Mean percent decreases from Baseline in VAS score were larger in the active- treatment 
groups versus placebo at every scheduled post- baseline study visit. Overall, the results were 
the most profound for the serlopitant 1 mg and 5 mg groups. For the percent change from 
Baseline in VAS pruritus scores (the primary efficacy variable), the Week 6 pairwise least squares mean difference compared to placebo was 5.8 mm, 13.2 mm, and 14.2 mm for serlopitant 0.25 mg, 1  mg, and 5 mg, respectively.   
The frequency of TEAEs and study drug related AEs was h igher in the serlopitant 1 mg and 
5 mg groups compared to the serlopitant 0.25 mg group, and the frequency in all three treatment groups were higher than in the placebo group. The frequency of AEs leading to study drug discontinuation was comparable in the serlopitant 5 mg and placebo group and higher than in the serlopitant 0.25 mg and 1 mg groups. There was one SAE reported in the serlopitant 1 mg group (spontaneous abortion, considered not related). There were no deaths. The most common AEs in the serlopitant groups were diarrhea (6.2%, 1 mg group), upper respiratory tract infection (4.7%, 0.25 mg group), somnolence (4.7%, 5 mg group), nasopharyngitis (4.6%, 1 mg group), headache (4.7%, 5 mg group), urinary tract infection (3.1%, 5 mg group), dry mouth (3.1%, 1 mg group), nausea (3.1%, 1 mg group), arthralgia (3.1%, 0.25 mg group), musculoskeletal pain (3.1%, 1 mg group) and pruritus (3.1%, 1 mg  group). The most common AEs in the placebo group were headache (6.3%), 
nasopharyngitis (3.2%), upper respiratory tract infection (3.2%), urinary tract infection (3.2%) and asthma (3.2%).  
TCP-102 
TCP-102 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled multi- center study that 
evaluated serlopitant 5 mg vs. placebo for the treatment of prurigo nodularis. A total of 128 adult subjects  18–80 years of age with prurigo nodularis were randomized to receive 
serlopitant or placebo in a 1:1 randomization. Subjects  received a loading dose of 3 tablets on 
Day 1 followed by 1 tablet per day for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the average VAS score as recorded at the study visits. Results at Week 4 and Week 8 were the primary timepoints.  
Serlopitant 5 mg was superior to placebo for the reduction of pruritus as measured by change in average VAS from baseline. For the primary endpoint, change from baseline at Week 4 and Week 8 by repeated measures analysis, the decrease from baseline was significantly greater in the serlopitant group than the placebo group, with a mean difference (serlopitant minus placebo) of -1.0 at Week 4 and - 1.7 at Week 8. The mean difference at Week 2 was 
also significant, -0.9. In a post- hoc analysis of the percentage of subjects who were 4 -point

Protocol MTI -109 
 
Version 2.0  Page 20 responders on average VAS at Week 8, 25.0% of placebo subjects  and 54.4% of serlopitant 
subjects  were 4 -point responders. 
TEAEs were reported for 71.9% of serlopitant-treated subjects and 61.9% of placebo- treated 
subjects. The most frequently reported TEAEs in the serlopitant group were nasopharyngitis 
(17.2% serlopitant, 3.2% placebo), diarrhea (10.9% serlopitant, 4.8% placebo), and fatigue (9.4% serlopitant, 6.3% placebo). Treatment-related TEAEs were reported for 48.4% of serlopitant- treated subjects and 34.9% of placebo-treated subjects. The most frequently 
reported treatment -related TEAEs in the serlopitant group were fatigue (7.8%) and diarrhea, 
peripheral edema, dizziness, and headache (each 6.3%). Most TEAEs were mild or moderate; severe TEAEs were reported for 9.4% of serlopitant-treated subjects and 4.8% of placebo-treated subjects. There were no deaths during the study. Five subjects (3 serlopitant, 2 placebo) had SAEs. The SAE s were actinic elastosis, depression, dizziness, and vertigo in 
the serlopitant group; and bradycardia, syncope, respiratory failure, and neurodermatitis in the placebo group. Nine subjects (3 serlopitant, 6 placebo) discontinued due to TEAEs. 
No clinically relevant changes were observed in chemistry, hematology, vital signs, or 
electrocardiogram (ECG)
 results.  
The results of the Phase 2 studies in prurigo nodularis and chronic pruritus , together with the 
extensive safety experience with serlopitant to date and the scientific rationale for NK 1-R 
inhibition in the treatment of pruritus associated with psoriasis, serve to support the evaluation of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in patients with  psoriasis.  
Please refer to the Investigator ’s Brochure for further information regarding serlopitant. 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in adults with plaque psoriasis. 
The secondary objectives of this study are as follows : 
• To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated oral doses of serlopitant in adults with 
plaque psoriasis. 
• To assess the psychometric properties of Worst -Itch Numeric Rating Scale ( WI-NRS).  
 
3 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Overall Study Design 
This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety, 
and tolerability of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in adults with plaque psoriasis. Subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to r eceive daily 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol MTI -109 
 
Version 2.0  Page 21 oral doses of serlopitant 5 mg or placebo for 8 weeks. The study will be conducted at 
approximately 40 study sites in North America.  
The study will consist of three periods, for a total study period of approximately 12 or 14 weeks:  
• Screening p eriod: 2 or 4 weeks  
• Treatment period: 8 weeks 
• Follow-up period: 2 weeks  
 
During the screening period, subjects will undergo eligibility evaluation and will have their 
baseline symptom scores established. Subjects who require a washout of prior therapies per study criteria will perform their Screening visit 4 weeks prior to randomization. Subjects who do not require a washout of prior therapies can perform the Screening visit 2 weeks prior to randomization. Subjects will be provided an electronic  diary (eDiary)  at screening and are 
expected to complete the diary daily for the duration of the study.  Subjects must be willing and able to complete the electronic diary within a consistent timeframe on a daily basis, to 
wear actigraphy devices during sleep, and to comply with restrictions on allowable concomitant therapies for the duration of the study.  
At the B aseline visit (Day 1) , eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive 
serlopitant 5 mg or placebo. Subjects will take a loading dose (3 t ablets taken orally) at the 
site on the first day of the treatment period (Day 1). Starting on Study Day 2, subjects will 
take one tablet  per day taken orally. Serlopitant may be taken with or without food.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed at Week 8  of treatment.  
After completion of t he treatment period  or early discontinuation of study drug , all subjects 
will enter a 2 week follow-up period.  
3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Dose Selection 
In the TCP-102 study in patients with prurigo nodularis, serl opitant 5 mg taken daily for 
8 weeks was superior to placebo for the reduction of pruritus, in both the overall study 
population as well as the subgroup of subjects  with an atopic diathesis. Similarly, in the 
TCP-101 study in patients  with chronic pruritus, serlopitant 5 mg and 1 mg taken daily for 
6 weeks were superior to placebo for the reduction of pruritus, in both the overall study population and the subgroup of subjects  with an atopic diathesis.  
In both the TCP-102 and TCP-101 studies, serlopitant was generally well -tolerated and 
demonstrated an overall favorable safety profile at the doses evaluated.  
The current MTI -109 study is designed to investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in patients  with psoriasis. The serlopitant 5 mg dose 
was selected for this study based on the following factors: 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol MTI -109 
 
Version 2.0  Page 22 • The favorable efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of serlopitant at the 5 mg dose 
level, as demonstrated in the TCP -102 and TCP -101 studies. These data are supported by 
safety experience across the serlopitant clinical development program. Over 250 subjects  
have been exposed to serlopitant at doses of 5 mg tablet equivalent daily for at least 6 weeks, and 41 subjects have been exposed for one year. 
• Human CNS PET receptor occupancy (RO) data for serlopitant in healthy young males 
(Study P002) demonstrated that a serlopitant 5 mg LFC once daily dose is likely to achieve ~ 93 % NK
1 RO at steady state. In previous dose- ranging experience with the 
NK 1-R ant agonist aprepitant , optimal clinical efficacy for the relief of 
chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) was achieved at dose levels 
resulting in > 90% CNS NK 1 RO and preferably > 95% ( Chawla 2003;  Carstens 2010).

5.8 Assignment to Treatment  
5.8.1 Randomization 
Eligible subjects  will be randomized to receive serlopitant 5 mg or placebo in a 1:1 ratio . 
Stratified permuted block randomization will be used. Randomization will be stratified by the 
subject’s reported WI -NRS score for  the 24-hour period prior to the initial Screening visit 
(7-8, 9–10).  An IWRS will be used to perform the randomization.  
5.8.2 Blinding  
This study will be  conducted as a double- blind study with the treatment assignment 
concealed from the subjects, the investigators and their staff, the Sponsor, and any designees of the Sponsor as required. The placebo will be formulated to be indistinguishable from the active study product(s). Study materials will be packaged and issued in a manner designed to 
maintain the blind for subjects and all study personnel involved in the direction and execution  of study procedures, study assessments, and collection of data. The randomization 
code for each subject will be available to the sites  for use only in an emergency situation. For

Section 7.6.  
5.9 Trea tment Compliance  
Records of study drug used, dosages administered, and intervals between visits will be kept 
during the study. Subjects will record in the eDiary the doses administered  and whether a 
dose was taken within 2 hours of eating a meal.  Subjects will be asked to return all partially used and empty bottle s to the study site at each visit. The site staff will count and record the 
number of remaining tablets in each returned bottle. Compliance will be calculated based on tablet counts as recorded on the eCRF. The site staff will review the subject’s eDiary to help evaluate compliance with dosing at each study visit. Discrepancies between compliance as assessed by tablet counts and doses recorded in the eDiary will be reconciled and documented at each visit. A subject who has deviated significantly from the once- daily 
dosing regimen will be counseled.  
6 STUDY SCHEDULE AND ASSESSM ENTS  
6.1 Efficacy Parameters  
6.1.1 Itch Numeric Rating Scale  
The Itch NRS  is a validated, self -reported instrument for m easurement of itch intensity 
(Kimball 2016). It uses a 24 -hour recall period and asks subjects  to rate the intensity of their 
itch on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable). Higher 
scores indicat e greater itch intensity. In this study, worst itch intensity (WI -NRS) during a 
24-hour recall period will be captured. Subjects will record their Itch NRS scores once daily via eDiary at the same time each day (+/ - 3 hours) throughout the screening, treatment, and 
follow-up periods, as outlined in Appendix A . Subjects may be allowed to adjust the timing 
of eDiary completion within the first week of Screening as needed. Standardized training and instructions will be provided to all subjects prior to eDiary use.  
6.1.2 Actigraphy 
High -resolution actigraphy is an objective method for quantifying nocturnal scratching 
events  and sleep -related parameters using high resolution actigraphy devices on each wrist. 
The device weighs 16  g (0.56 oz) without the strap, and is made of medical device grade 
housing material. The device is water resistant up to 10 meters, dust-tight, and drop- resistant 
to 0.5 m. It is functional for operation be tween 41 –104°F (5 –40°C).  
The assessment requires each subject  to wear the actigraphy devices, which are the size of a 
medium size wrist watch, on each wrist at night ( during sleep), with the option to wear them 
during the waking hours as well ; if tolerated by the subject, keeping at least one watch on 
24/7 would be expected to optimize data quality.  It is strongly suggested that subjects wear 
the actigraphy devices for at least four consecutive nights within any given week; while intermittent breaks f rom wearing actigraphy devices due to temporary irritation or disc omfort  
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol MTI -109 
 
Version 2.0  Page 31 are permitted, they should ideally be limited to a maximum of three consecutive nights per 
week throughout the study.   
The devices will be programmed and activated prior to being provided to subjects. Once 
received, the subjects can simply put the devices on their wrists and they will record  
automatically . The devices are returned to the study site at each subsequent study visit where 
the data are downloaded and sent for analysis.   
The 3 -D acceleration data (m/sec2) from the actigraphy device is analyzed with a neural 
network that was developed to discriminate scratching from other nighttime events. The 
algorithm was developed and tested in a study of 24 subjects (6 healthy, 18 with atopic dermatitis) who were video recorded for one night in a sleep  lab while wearing actigraphy 
devices on each wrist. The video recordings were scored to quantify the time and duration of each scratching event. A strong correlation  was shown  (r = 0.98) between the number of 
scratching events per hour measured with the actigraphy analysis versus the video scoring. In contrast, subjective questionnaires completed by the subjects the following morning had a poor correlation with the true number of scr atching events. For example, the best correlation 
was 0.6 with a VAS . The full description of the algorithm and the study has been submitted 
to IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics ( Moreau 2016 ). 
Actigraphy  measurement s will be assessed as outlined in Appendix A . 
6.1.3 Static Patient Global Assessment of Itch Severity  
The
 sPGA is designed to assess overall itch severity. Each subject is asked to rate the 
severity of his/her itchiness in the past 7 days on a 5-point scale as none, mild, moderate, severe, and very severe. The sPGA will be collected as outlined in Appendix A . 
6.1.4 Patient Global Impression of Change in Itch Severity 
The PGIC in Itch Severity is a single item u sed to assess the change in overall itch severity 
since the B aseline visit. Each subject will rate the change in his/her itch severity on a 7 -point 
scale from very much better, moderately better, a little better, no change, a little worse, moderately worse,  to very much worse. PGIC will be collected as outlined in Appendix A . 
6.1.5 Body Surface Area  
The BSA is used to assess the overall extent of plaque psoriasis at a given time point.  The evaluator will measure the percentage (%) of skin covered with plaque psoriasis by the hand 
method.  The hand method is commonly used for estimation with the assumption that 1 hand = 1% of the total body surface area.  One hand is defined as the subject’s palm to the proximal interphalangeal joint. For scoring, multiple small lesions must be “merged” to measure.  Also if central  clearing is noted, include only the affected area in calculation.  The 
percent BSA involvement will be collected as outlined in Appendix A .  The same qualified 
evaluator should assess a subject across all study visits for BSA and PGA, when possible. 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol MTI -109 
 
Version 2.0  Page 32 6.1.6 Physician Global Assessment of Psoriasis   
The PGA is the physician’s determination of a patient’s overall plaque psoriasis lesions at a 
given time point (“ Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products Indicated for 
the Treatment of Psoriasis” 2004). Overall, lesions are assessed for induration, erythema, and scaling on a scale ranging from clear (0), almost  clear (1), mild (2), moderate (3), severe (4), 
to very  severe (5).  PGA scores will be assessed as outlined in Appendix A . The same 
qualified evaluator should assess a subject across all study visits for BSA and PGA, when possible. 
Score  Grade  Definition  
0 Clear  No plaque elevation above normal skin level; may have residual 
nonerythematous discoloration; no psoriatic scale  
1 Almost Clear  Essentially flat with possible trace elevation; faint erythema; no 
psoriatic scale  
2 Mild  Slight but definite elevation of plaque above normal skin level; may 
have up to moderate erythema (red coloration); fine scales with some 
lesions partially covered  
3 Moderate  Moderate elevation with rounded or sloped edges to plaque; moderate 
erythema (red coloration); somewhat coarse scales with most lesions 
partially covered  
4 Severe  Marked elevation with hard, sharp edges to plaque; severe erythema 
(red coloration); coarse, thick scales with virtually all lesions covered 
and a roug h surface  
5 Very Severe  Very marked elevation with very hard, sharp edges to plaque; severe 
erythema (very red coloration); very coarse, very thick scales with 
virtually all lesions covered and a very rough surface  
 
6.1.7 Patient- Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Itch 
Questionnaire (PIQ)  
Patient -Reported Outcome Measurement  Information System (PROMIS®) Itch Questionnaire 
(PIQ) is an  itch-specific instrument that measures quality of life impairment related to itch in 
the previous week. The PIQ includes 4 domains (general, scratching behavior, mood and 
sleep,  and activity and clothing ) as noted in Appendix C .  Subjects will complete  the PIQ  
short forms  as outlined in Appendix A .    
6.2 Safety Parameters  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording protocol- defined adverse events 
(AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs); vital signs; physical examinations; clinical laboratory assessments ; ECGs; pharmacokinetics (PK) measurements; and other protocol-
specified tests that are deemed critical  to the safety evaluation of the study drug.

Version 2.0  Page 42 6.6 Early Termination 
Early termination of a subject from the study may occur due to the following reasons: 
• lost to follow-up 
• withdrawal of consent by the subject  
 
In accordance with legal requirements and International Co nference on Harmonisation 
(ICH)  – Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, every subject or his/her legal 
representative has the right to withdraw from  the study at any time and without providing 
reasons.  If a subject  is willing to provide a reason for withdrawal, this will be recorded in the 
electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). The Investigator or site staff must make every effort to 
contact subjects who are suspected of being lost to follow- up.  A minimum of two attempted 
telephone contacts and a certified letter are required before a subject can be deemed as lost to follow-up. Attempts to contact such subjects must be documented in the subject’s source documents. 
7 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
7.1 Definitions  
7.1.1 Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. 
AEs include treatment emergent exacerbations of pre- existing illnesses and AEs that occur as 
a result of protocol-mandated interventions. 7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is considered “serious” if it results in any of the following outc omes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening AE (i.e. the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred. An event that might have led to death if it had occurred with greater severity is 
not “life -threatening”)  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongat ion of existing hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol MTI -109 
 
Version 2.0  Page 43 • Congenital anomaly/ birth defect  
• Important medical event (i.e. an event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospitalization, but which may be considered serious by the investigator or 
Sponsor, as it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above). Examples of such medical  events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
The following are not considered SAEs: a visit to the emergency room or other hospital 
department < 24 hours that does not result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event), an elective surgery planned prior to signing consent, 
admission as per protocol for planned medical/surgical procedure, and/or routine health assessments requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (e.g. , routine 
colonoscopy). 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity refers to the int ensity of an 
AE (e.g., mi ld, moderate, or severe pain); the event itself may be of minor medical 
significance (e.g., s evere back pain). “Serious” is a regulatory definition, as defined above. 
Seriousness (not severity) serves as the basis for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs and SAEs on 
the eCRF.  
7.1.3 Abnormal Physical Exam, Laboratory, Vital Sign, and Electrocardiogram Findings  
Abnormal physical exam findings that are clinically significant and are identified prior to the first dose of study drug should be recorded as medical history. New or worsening clinically significant abnormal physical exam findings identified after the first dose of study drug should be recorded as AEs.   
Only abnormal laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings that are considered clinically 
significant by the investigator (e.g., require active management or are associated with accompanying symptoms/signs) will be recorded as medical history or AEs on th e eCRF. 
Abnormal laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings that occur prior to the first dose of study drug should be recorded as medical history, and abnormal findings that occur after the first dose of study drug should be recorded as AEs. 
If the clinical ly significant laboratory, vital sign, or ECG abnormality is a sign associated 
with a confirmed disease  or condition (e.g., elevated creatinine in a subject diagnosed with 
chronic kidney disease ), only the diagnosis (chronic kidney disease ) needs to be recorded on 
the AE eCRF.  
Separate instances of the same clinically significant laboratory, vital sign, or ECG 
abnormality across visits should not be recorded as separate AEs or SAEs . 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol MTI -109 
 
Version 2.0  Page 44 7.1.4 Deaths  
Any deaths that occur from the time of informed consent to the Follow-up visit, regardless of 
attribution, must be reported within 24 hours of investigator’s awareness of the death. See MTI-109 SAE Report Form and Pregnancy Report Form Completion Guidelines  for 
complete instructions.  
The Sponsor should be provided a copy of any post- mortem findings and/or relevant medical 
reports, including histopathology. 
7.1.5 Pregnancies and Contraception Requir ements for Females  
For the purposes of this study, a female of childbearing potential is  defined as any female 
who has experienced menarche and is pre- menopausal .  A postmenopausal state is defined as 
no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause in a previously menstruating 
female; in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is not sufficient evidence of postmenopausal status.  
For the purposes of this  study, acceptable contraception is defined below based on 
Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Tria ls and Marketing 
Authorization for Pharmaceuticals:  ICH M3(R2) dated January 2010, and other available 
guidelines ( “U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, 2010 ” 2010; 
“Recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy testing in clinical trials” 2014; 
“M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing 
Authorization for Pharmaceuticals ” 2010) :  
All female subjects of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception, which includes the use of one or more of the following acceptable methods:  
1. Surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal occlusion or ligation , hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) 
2. Total (as opposed to periodic or cyclic) abstinence from heterosexual intercourse 
3. Hormonal contraception associated with consistent inhibition of ovulation; these may 
include (but are not necessarily limited to) oral, intravag inal, implantable, injectable, or 
transdermal delivery methods.   
a. Progesterone only oral contraceptives are excluded as a highly effective method, as 
they do not consistently inhibit ovulation. 
4. Intrauterine device/system s 
5. Exclusive monogamous heterosexual intercourse with a sterilized (i.e., vasectomized) or otherwise non- fertile (e.g., castrated) male partner  
 
Any pregnancy occurring in a female subject or the female partner of a male subject, from 
the first study drug administration through the Follow-up visit must be reported within 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol MTI -109 
 
Version 2.0  Page 45 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the pregnancy. See MTI-109 SAE Report Form 
and Pregnancy Report Form Completion Guidelines for complete instructions .  
The investigator will follow the pregnancy to delivery or othe r pregnancy outcome.  
Pregnancy in a female clinical trial subject or female partner of a male clinical trial subject is 
not an SAE per se. Complications of such pregnancies (for example, spontaneous abortion) may qualify as SAE s and should be reported as such  even if they occur after the Follow -up 
visit. Any congenital anomalies/birth defects must be recorded and reported as SAEs. See MTI-109 SAE Report Form and Pregnancy Report Form Completion Guidelines  for 
complete instructions.  
7.1.6 Worsening of Pruritus or Psoriasis  
Pruritus or psoriasis should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if considered by the 
investigator to have unexpectedly worsened in severity or worsened beyond the subject’s normal fluctuations during the study. It is important to include a description of the nature of the unexpected worsening when recording the AE or SAE (e.g., new psoriasis lesions in previously uninvolved skin or pruritus requiring use of excluded therapy). 
7.2 Methods and Timing for Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
7.2.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
Any AE occurrence during the study must be recorded on source documentation and eCRF at 
the site, in accordance with protocol instructions.  
AEs and SAEs will be recorded from the first study drug administration through the Follow-
up visit. After the F ollow-up visit, only SAEs that are believed to be drug-related should be 
reported. 
After informed consent, but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs considered by the 
investigator to be caused by a protocol-mandated intervention will be collected (e.g., SAEs related to invasive procedures such as blood collection). These procedure- related SAEs 
should only be reported on the source documents and SAE form, not on the AE eCRF. Subjects  who undergo screening procedures but are not randomized into the study will not 
have SAEs recorded in the clinical database.  
7.2.2 Eliciting Adverse Events  
Investigators will seek information on AEs and SAEs at each subject  contact through the 
Follow-up visit. All AEs and SAEs, whether reported by the subject or noted by authorized study personnel, will be recorded in the subject ’s medical record and on the AE eCRF page, 
and, if serious, on the SAE form. For each AE and SAE recorded, the investigator will make an assessment of seriousness, severity, and causality. 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol MTI -109 
 
Version 2.0  Page 46 7.2.3 Assessment of Severity 
All AEs  entered into the eCRF will be graded for severity using the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03 (“Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)” 2010) to describe the maximum intensity of the adverse event.   
If the AE cannot be found in the event- specific NCI CTCAE grading criteria, the investigator 
should use the definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Table 1. Table 1 Adverse Event Grading  
Grade  Severity  Alternate Descriptiona 
1 Mild (apply event- specific NCI 
CTCAE grading criteria)  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or 
diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated.  
2 Moderate (apply event- specific NCI 
CTCAE grading criteria)  Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention 
indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living (ADLb) 
3 Severe (apply event -specific NCI 
CTCAE grading criteria)  
 Severe or medicall y significant but not 
immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitalization indicated; 
disabling; limiting self care ADLc 
4 Very severe, life threatening, or 
disabling (apply event -specific NCI 
CTCAE grading criteria)  Life-threa tening consequences; urgent 
intervention indicated.  
5 Death related to AE   
a Use these alternative definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 events when the observed or reported AE is not in 
the NCI CTCAE listing.  A semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the alternate description of the grade.  
b Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, 
managing money, etc.  
c Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, fee ding self, using the toilet, taking medications, 
and not bedridden.  
Source: National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03  
(“Common Terminology Crit eria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)”   2010 ) 
 
Note that severity, a measure of intensity, is not equivalent to seriousness, a regulatory 
definition of outcome. Regardless of severity, some AEs may meet the criteria for seriousness. See Section 7.1.2 for the definition of an SAE. 
If an adverse event changes in severity during the same study period (e.g., treatment period), 
only the highest severity grade will be recorded on the eCRF.  
7.2.4 Assessment of Causality  
The investigator’s assessment of causality m ust be provided for all AEs  (serious and non-
serious). An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol MTI -109 
 
Version 2.0  Page 47 reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE. 
Causality of an AE will be assessed by the investigator using the following terms: 
• Likely Related: A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected study drug; and for which other potential etiologies are considered less likely factors than the study drug. 
• Likely Unrelated: A reaction that, considering all potential etiologies, is most likely due to factors other than the study drug. 
 
7.3 Follow- up of Adverse Events and Serious  Adverse Events  
The investigator must make every effort to follow all AEs and SAEs regardless of attribution 
until judged resolved or stabilized, the subject  is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined 
that study drug treatment or participation in the study is not the cause of the AE or SAE. 
7.4 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor and Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC)  
The Sponsor or designee is under obligation to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities related to investigational drugs in clinical trials. The Sponsor or designee must be notified within 24 hours of an AE when the investigator determines that an AE meets the protocol definition of an SAE, regardless of the cause or relationship to study drug.  
An SAE related to study participation occurring before study drug administration and after 
informed consent should be promptly reported to the Sponsor. If the investigator learns of any SAE at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and the SAE is considered likely related to study drug, the SAE should be promptly reported to the Sponsor. 
Please see the MTI-109 SAE Report Form and Pregnancy Report Form Completion 
Guidelines for safety reporting instructions.  The investigator must also comply with applicable requirements concerning reporting of 
SAEs to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee. This may include initial or follow-up notification of an SAE or other safety information. 
7.5 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Regulat ory Authorities and Study 
Investigators 
The Sponsor, or its designee, is responsible for submitting reports of serious, unexpected 
related adverse events to regulatory authorities on an expedited basis, according to the ICH E2A Guideline and to other regulatory authorities according to national and local regulations as required. The Sponsor, or its designee, is responsible for prompt submission to the IRB or EC of any expedited SAE reports submitted to regulatory authorities. All investigators participating  in ongoing clinical studies with serlopitant will receive copies of the SAE 
reports submitted on an expedited basis to regulatory authorities. 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol MTI -109 
 
Version 2.0  Page 48 7.6 Emergency Unblinding  
The investigator will immediately notify the Sponsor or the medical monitor to discuss the 
need for unblinding any subject via IWRS. There is no specific antidote for serlopitant and usual supportive medical management is recommended in the case of a medical emergency.  
8 STATISTICAL METHODS  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. No interim analyses are planned. Endpoints will be summarized with  descriptive statistics  by treatment 
group and visit. For continuous variables, the following information will be presented: n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. For categorical variables counts and percentages will be used. 
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be the method of Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation. As one sensitivity analysis, the last observation carried forward method (LOCF) will be used (i.e., the last available on-therapy observation for a subject will be used to estimate subsequent missing data points). As a second sensitivity analysis, a repeated meas ures model will be used on observed data. 
Baseline for measures other than the eDiary and actigraphy daily measures, will be the last recorded value prior to the start of treatment. For daily measures including the WI- NRS, 
baseline will be the average resu lt measured over the week prior to treatment. Additionally, 
the daily measures will be summarized at Weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8 by averaging the daily results associated with these weeks.  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP), describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a separate document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study treatments. 
8.1 Decision Rule and Sample S ize  
The decision rule is based on the Phase 2b screening methodology presented in Fleming and 
Richardson ( Fleming 2004). The  two-category decision guideline as applied to this clinical 
trial compares the observed one-sided p-value for the primary endpoint to two categories: (0.025, 0.05) and (0, 0.025). 
• If the one- sided p -value is betw een 2.5% and 5% then the serlopitant- based regimen is 
plausibly efficacious and should be evaluated definitively in a subsequent Phase 3 clinical trial.   
• If the one- sided p -value is less than 2.5%, then the serlopitant-based regimen will have 
met the generally accepted level of evidence required to demonstrate efficacy.   
 
The sample size of 100 per group has been selected to achieve 90% power for the primary 
endpoint with  
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol MTI -109 
 
Version 2.0  Page 49 • 5% one-sided alpha and responder rates of 24% (placebo) and 43.5% (serlopitant) 
• 2.5% one-sided alpha and responder rates of 24% (placebo) and 46% (serlopitant) 
 
Testing of the key secondary endpoints will take place should statistical significance be 
reached for the primary endpoint.  Testing within the key secondary endpoints will be hierarchical with testing starting with the WI -NRS Week 4 responder rate, then the Day 7 
WI-NRS endpoint, and finally the Day 3 WI -NRS endpoint. 
The sample size calculations have been performed in PASS 13  (“PASS 13 Power Analysis 
and Sample Size Software” 2014) and use a Chi- Squared test. The primary analysis will 
control for the stratification factors. It is expected that this unstratified power estimate will 
under- estimate the true power as it does not take the variance reduction  resulting from 
stratification into account  (Matts 1988). 
8.2 Handling of Missing Data and Excluded Therapy Use  
Should a determination of treatment period (on treatment, pre- treatment) be required for 
adverse events or concomitant med ication but the corresponding date is missing, or is a 
partial date, the event/medication will be considered on treatment unless the portions of the date that are available indicate this is not possible.  
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be MCMC multiple imputation. Imputation will be conducted within each treatment group independently, so the pattern of missing observations in one treatment group cannot influence missing value estimations in another. For each imputation process, 25 imputations will be performed.  
If a subject fails to complete their eDiary for a week or more the primary endpoint  
(WI-NRS ), may be missing. If the Week 8 measure from the eDiary is unavailable because 
the subject withdrew from the study due to lack of eff icacy, or the subject uses an excluded 
therapy to treat psoriasis or pruritus, their responder status will be defined as non-responder.  If the Week 8 value is missing for any other reason , the WI -NRS change from baseline value 
will be based on imputed data. Missing Week 8 WI-NRS values from which the 4-point responder status is derived will be estimated by MCMC.  
Missing WI -NRS data will be derived for the analysis using the method of MCMC multiple 
imputation. Since both primary and key secondary endpoints require WI -NRS, the following 
steps will be followed: 
1. Using the daily eDiary data, calculate Baseline and Week 2 through Week 8 values by averaging available values. If any values are available, these will be used i.e. a minimum of 1 observation is require d to compute a week’s average.  
2. From step 1, create a dataset for each treatment group, of subjects with observed values and those needing estimation by MCMC. The missing WI-NRS values in each dataset will be filled in using the MCMC method to generate 25 datasets. 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol MTI -109 
 
Version 2.0  Page 50 The resulting datasets for each treatment arm will be combined into one complete 
dataset.  
Syntax:  
proc mi data=datain out=dataout seed=&seed. Nimpute=25 <options>;     where trtpn=(TRT);   /* Note TRT = [1, 2]; depending on treatment group */;    mcmc chain=single;  
   var baseline d2 d3 d4 d5 d6 d7 week2 week3 week4 week5 week6 week7 week8; run;  
3. From each complete dataset, the dichotomous responder rate will be determined.  
 
Each complete dataset formed by multiply imputed data will be analyzed as specified for the 
particular analysis. The results from the analyses will be combined into a single inference using SAS® PROC MIANALYZE. In the case of the primary analysis and the secondary responder analyses, the Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) statistics computed in the analyses of WI -NRS responder rates will be normalized using the Wilson- Hilferty transformation 
prior to combining them using SAS® PROC MIANALYZE 
A total of 2 random seeds will be needed to impute missing data. Those random seeds have 
been pre-specified by using a random number generator: 
• WI-NRS Serlopitant: Seed= 85162995      
• WI-NRS Placebo: Seed= 878201528       
 
8.3 Analysis Population s  
Primary e fficacy analyses will be based upon an intent- to-treat (ITT) philosophy. The 
primary efficacy population will be the Full Analysis Set (FAS) , which will include all 
randomized subjects  who received at least one dose of study drug . Subjects  will be analyzed  
within the treatment group  to which they are randomi zed.  
The primary safety population will be all treated subjects  with at least one post- baseline 
assessment . For safety analyses, subjects  will be classified based upon the treatment 
received.   
Additiona l analyses performed on the Per Protocol (PP) population will be consi dered 
supportive.  The PP population will include all subjects in the safety population who 
complete the Week 8 evaluations without any significant protocol violations (i.e., any subject or investigator activity that could have possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment efficacy). The PP population will include subjects in the safety population who do not meet any of the following criteria:  
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol MTI -109 
 
Version 2.0  Page 51 • Violated the inclusion/exclusion criteria;  
• Received a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (See Appendix B ); 
• Received an excluded medication  which may plausibly impact the primary endpoint 
at Week 8   
• Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e. subjects must comply with 
80−120% of the expected dosage of study medication during participation in the 
study);  
• Have not completed Week 8 visit within ±7 days window 
Subjects  who  discontinue from the study drug due to an  adverse event related to study 
treatment  or documented  lack of treatment effect , or who met protocol-defined non-responder 
criteria , will be included in the PP population. Prior to breaking the blind, other additional 
criteria may be added to the lis ts above to accommodate for unforeseen events that occurred 
during the conduct of the trial that result in noteworthy study protocol violations. 
8.4 Subject Disposition  
An accounting of all randomiz ed subjects  by disposition will be presented. Subjects  who 
discontinue study drug prematurely or withdraw from the study will be summarized and 
listed, with a description of the reason for early termination/withdrawal.  
8.5 Subject  Characteristics   
Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be summari zed. 
8.6 Concom itant M edications   
Concomitant medications will be coded by the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary  to Anatomical Therapeutic Classification (ATC) and preferred drug name. Concomitant medications will be summarized by ATC level and preferred drug name and listed.  
8.7 Treatment Compliance and Extent of Exposure  
Compliance with study drug dosing will be determined based on tablet counts recorded on 
the eCRF. Compliance will be calculated by analyzing expected number of tablets returned versus actual number of tablets returned.  S ummaries of treatment exposure will also be 
produced. 
8.8 Efficacy Analyses  
The efficacy endpoints will be summarized within the FAS and PP populations usi ng 
descriptive statistics by time point and treatment. Results including averaged imputed values 
will be summarized at Baseline, Week 2, 4, 8 and Follow-up and the change from baseline 
for these measures will be summarized at Week  2, 4, 8 and Follow-up.  T he WI -NRS 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol MTI -109 
 
Version 2.0  Page 52 measures will also be summarized at Week 6.  The WI -NRS and change from baseline will 
also be presented for each study day.  The PGIC is a measure of change and so will only be 
summarized at Week 2, 4, 8 and Follow-up. 
For the 4 and 3 point respo nder rate endpoints, subjects will be considered responders if they 
have at least a 4 / 3  point reduction between baseline and the corresponding week and the 
subject did not use an excluded medication to treat their pruritus or psoriasis.   The difference in the primary efficacy outc ome meas ure (WI-NRS 4-point responder rate at 
Week 8 ) will be tested using a CMH test co ntrolling for the ‘as randomized’ stratification 
factor s. Conceptually t he hypotheses being tested are:  
H
0:PPlacebo  ≥ PSerlopitant   H a: PPlacebo  < PSerlopitant  
where P Placebo  is the percent of placebo responders and P Serlopitant is the similar percent for 
serlopitant. The primary endpoint will utilize the missing data rules as outlined in 
Section  8.2.   
The remaining key secondary endpoints will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model with treatment group and stratification factor as fixed effects and the respective baseline values as a covariate.   Both least squares means and observed means will be 
presented.  
To confirm the assumptions for the ANCOVA model (i.e., that the errors are normally 
distributed with equal variances), residuals will be examined using the Shapiro- Wilk test. If 
there is overwhelmingly strong evidence that the a ssumptions are not satisfied, the data will 
be rank -transformed prior to submitting to the ANCOVA. Results of the rank- transformed 
analysis then will be considered the primary analysis; however, results of the non- rank-
transformed analysis will also be presented.  
The preceding analyses  are to be conducted for the FAS and PP populations.  
8.9 Sensitivity Analyses  
8.9.1 Last Observation Carried Forward  
As a sensitivity analysis, missing values will be imputed using LOCF. Each primary and key 
secondary endpoint will be analyzed as it was using the multiply imputed data.  8.10 Psychometric Analyses   
A psychometric assessment of the WI -NRS will be conducted to assess test -retest reliability, 
construct validity and responsiveness. These will be conducted outside of the statis tical 
analysis plan for this study and will include analyses of : intra -class correlation coefficients 
(ICC), Pearson’s correlations, and change scores for test- retest reliability; Pearson Product 
Moment or Spearman Correlations for concurrent validity; t-t est analyses or ANOVA for 
known groups validity; and correlations of change scores for WI-NRS and other measures for

Version 2.0  Page 53 responsiveness. Anchor- and distribution-based methods also will be used to assess 
responsiveness as well as support a responder definition. 
8.11 Safety Analyses  
8.11.1 Adverse E vents   
The incidence of all AEs and treatment -related AEs will be tabulated by treatment received. 
These AEs will be classified by system organ class and preferred term using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (Med DRA). For incidence reporting, if a subject  
reported more than one AE that was coded to the same system organ class or preferred term, the subject  will be counted only once for that specific system organ class or preferred term. 
An overview of AEs, which includes subject  incidence of AEs, treatment -related AEs, AEs 
by severity, SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to discontinuation, will be presented.  
SAEs will be listed and summariz ed in a similar manner to AEs . 
8.11.2 Clinical Safety Laboratory R esults   
Clinical safety laboratory values will be measured by a central laboratory. S ummary statistics 
for actual values and for changes from baseline will be tabulated for laboratory results by 
scheduled visit. Graphs of laboratory values over time will also be produced.  
Subjects  with clinical laboratory values outside of the nor mal reference range at any 
post- baseline assessment will be summarized. Shifts from baseline laboratory values will be 
tabulated . 
8.11.3 Vital Signs  
The observed data and change from baseline for each measurement day will be summari zed 
with descriptive statistics.  8.11.4 Electrocardiograms  
The overall ECG assessment (abnormal or normal) will be summarized along with a 
summary of how many subjects developed a post treatment abnormal result. The stud y 
relevance of the finding (i.e. clinical significance as determined by the investigator) will be 
provided in a listing. 
8.11.5 Physical Exams  
Physical exam finds will be recorded by the sites within medical history or adverse events 
and otherwise not summarized. 
8.12 Pharmacokinetics Analysis  
The plasma concentrations of serlopitant and metabolites will be reported in a PK report that 
will be a part of the clinical study report.

Version 2.0  Page 54 The plasma concentrations of serlopitant and metabolites will also be combined with the data 
from other serlopitant clinical studies for population PK analysis with PK endpoint of individual model parameter estimates and covariates identification. A specific population PK data analysis plan will be developed that will outline the detailed app roach to data handling, 
model development and diagnostics, individual model parameter estimation, exploration of covariate effects, and final model evaluation techniques. The population PK  analysis report 
will not be a part of the clinical study report.    
9 ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS  
9.1 Changes to the Protocol 
Protocol amendments must be made only with the prior written approval of the Sponsor. An 
investigator signature will be obtained for the initial protocol and any amendments. Substantial amendments will be pro vided to the appropriate regulatory authorities. No 
protocol changes affecting the following will be made without the written approval of the Sponsor and the responsible IRB: 
• Safety and/or eligibility of subjects  
• Data integrity  
• Study design or conduct 
• Willingness of a subject to participate in the study 
 
9.2 Study T ermination  
The Sponsor has the right to terminate this study at any time. Reasons may include, but are 
not limited to, evidence of a potential safety risk in this study or other serlopitant studies or poor enrollment. A written statement fully documenting the reasons for study termination will be provided to the IRB. 
9.3 Monitoring and Auditing Procedures  
The Sponsor will designate study monitors who will be responsible for monitoring the 
conduc t of this study. A separate study Monitoring Plan will include details regarding the 
responsibilities of the study monitors, investigator responsibilities in providing access to records and addressing issues identified, the frequency and structure of monitoring visits, and adherence to subject confidentiality as outlined in the Informed Consent Form (ICF). 
9.4 Transfer of Obligations 
The Sponsor will delegate certain aspects of study oversight to Contract Research 
Organizations (CROs). The specific responsibili ties will be detailed in Transfer of 
Obligations documents.

Protocol MTI -109 
 
Version 2.0  Page 55 9.5 Informed Consent  
The purpose of the study, the procedures to be carried out, and any potential risks of study 
participation will be described in non- technical terms in the ICF. After having reviewed and 
understood the ICF, subjects will be required to read, sign, and date an IRB -approved 
consent form before any study- specific procedures are carried out. Subjects will be assured 
that they may withdraw from the study at any time without jeopardizing medical care related to or required as a result of study participation. The original signed consent form will be maintained in the investigator site file. Copies of signed consent forms will be provided to the subject.  
9.6 Communication with the Institutional Review Board  
The IRB is constituted and operates in accordance with the principles and requirements described in the ICH E6 guideline. The protocol, informed consent form, other written subject information, and any proposed study advertising material must be submitted to the IRB for written approval. IRB approval of these documents will be provided to the investigator. The study will not start until the IRB has granted its approval of the study materials and procedures.  
Protocol amendments will be submitted to the IRB as explained in Section 9.1. SAE information will be submitted to the IRB as explained in Section 7.4. 
If the study is terminated by the Sponsor, a written statement fully documenting the reason(s) 
for study termination will be provided to the IRB.  
9.7 Disclosure and Confidentiality  
By signing this protocol, the investigator agrees to keep all information provided by the Sponsor in strict confidence and to require the same confidentiality from site staff and the IRB. Study documents provided by the Sponsor (e.g., protocol, IB, eCRFs) will be stored appropriately to ensure their confidentiality. The information provided by the Sponsor to the investigator may not be disclosed to others without direct written authorization from the Sponsor, except to the extent necessary to obtain informed consent from subjects who wish to participate in the study.  
The investigator must ensure that the subjects be identified by a unique subject study 
number. Other study-related documents that may contain confidenti al participant information 
(e.g., signed ICFs) will be kept in strict confidence by the investigator and be stored in a secure location with access restricted to the study staff.  
9.8 Records and Electronic Case Report Forms  
All study data except central laboratory, PK, eDiary, actigraphy, and ECG data will be recorded in an eCRF system. Data will be entered at the site by the appropriately designated and trained site personnel. All source documents from which eCRF entries are derived should be placed in the subject’s medical records. eCRFs will be completed for every subject screened in the study.  
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol MTI -109 
 
Version 2.0  Page 56 The study monitor will review all eCRFs in detail and will have access to participant medical 
records, laboratory data, and other source documentation to allow required eCRF fields to be verified by source data.  
Data consistency and plausibility checks against data entered into the eCRF will be included in the eCRF system. Data corrections can be performed in the eCRFs by the site. For each instance of data modification, the system requires a reason for change. The system keeps a full audit trail of the data values, the date and time of modification, and the electronic signature of the user who performed the change.  
After a full review of the eCRFs by the study monitor and resolution of any data 
clarifications, the investigator will review, sign, and approve the subject’s eCRF. All essential documents, source data, clinical records, and laboratory data will be retained by the site in accordance with the ICH E6 guideline and the site’s data retention policies. These records must be available for inspection by the Sponsor, monitor, and regulatory authorities. 
Further detail regarding data management and eCRFs is included in the Data Management 
Plan.  
9.9 Good Clinical Practices and Ethical Study Conduct  
The study procedures outlined in this protocol will be conducted in accordance with applicable ICH Guidelines, including ICH E6: Good Clinical Practices. As this study is conducted under a US IND, the investigator will also ensure that the basic principles of “Good Clinical Practice”, as outlined in 21 CFR 312, subpart D, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators”, 21 CFR, part 50 and 21 CFR, part 56 are adhered to. 
The study procedures outlined in this protocol will also be conducted in accordance with the 
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. 
9.10 End of Study Notification 
The Sponsor will notify appropriate regulatory authorities and the IRB within 90 days from 
the end of the clinical study. The end of the clinical study is defined as the last study visit for the last subject.  
9.11 Publication of Results  
All publications (e.g., manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) based on this study or relying on data from this study must be submitted to the Sponsor f or review 
and release before submission for publication. The Sponsor is responsible for final approval of all publications. 
9.12 Final Report  
A clinical trial summary report will be provided to the appropriate regulatory authorities 
within one year of the end of the clinical study.

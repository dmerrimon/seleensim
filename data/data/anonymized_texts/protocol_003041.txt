3.1. Background and Rationale 
 
Biochemical changes in dermal connective tissue lies at the foundation of skin laxity, often leading to the inevitable “Aging Face Syndrome.”  The appearance of a young and 
well defined neck is deemed to have cervicomental angle of 90 ° – 105 °, a good tone, a 
well-defined mandibular border, no accumulation of fat in the submental area, and no evidence of platysma bands [1].   In the course of aging, the neck serves as an indicator for the loss of collagen and elastin causing excessive skin laxity, an increase in submental fat and loose jowls along the mandibular border.  A 2014 American Society for Dermatologic Surgery consumer 
survey found 68 percent of respondents were concerned about excess fat under the chin 
and neck. Data were obtained through a bl ind online survey conducted in April 2014 
through the web-based Contribute service. The survey received 8,315 responses.  Laxity of submental area is therefore, a common cosmetic complaint of the aging population . As the “baby boomer” generation reaches later life,  aesthetic surgical medical 
interventions are becoming increasingly sought after by patients to aid and improve the cosmetic profile of these persons.  
Thermi plans to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ThermiRF™ radiofrequency in 
the treatment of submental skin laxity using.  The planned treatment uses targeted 
temperature controlled RF to achieve lifting in subjects with mild to moderate severity 
defined as normal muscle and mild to moderate skin laxity and mild to moderate fat on 
the submental area.  Additionally biomechanical changes of the skin will be evaluated 
using the Cutomer® which may be evident as a result of the  ThermiRF treatment [6]. 
The ThermiRF system uses radiofrequency to apply heat to target areas using 
electrocoagulation; this is a percutaneous minimally -invasive technique.  
ThermiRF Device 
 
The ThermiRF device is a minimally invasive radiofrequency solution, and an established therapeutic modality for the treatment of nerve tissue ablation and electrocoagulation. The use of radiofrequency in aesthetics is well published. [2-4]. the temperature controlled radiofrequency is less-invasive and provides a better safety profile (reduced 
risk) when compared to surgery, other more invasive treatments and non-temperature 
controlled energy devices.  The ThermiRF device delivers a controlled thermal endpoint as a result of its proprietary software algorithm and feedback loop that consistently measures the tissue temperature at the tip of the treatment RF electrode.    As the electric current permeates a tissue layer, ions found within that layer, deliver or 
carry the current. This, in turn, increases the kinetic activity of the ions. Increased ion 
kinetics and oscillations engenders re sistive tissue thermogenesis.

Thermogenesis is calculable via the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) equation, which assesses local electrical conductivity and magnitude of local electric current density generated around the electrode (Equation 1). 
 
The electric field strength generated is capable of heating tissue in close proximity to the 
electrode. Thermal conduction attenuates the heat ing of tissue as you move further from 
the electrode. With proper controls, generating the ideal thermal endpoint will occur very 
close to the electrode, thereby affecting only the intended target tissue area (Figure 1).  
Figure 1: Distribution of RF-induced heat 
 
 
Regulation of tissue temperature derives from power control. Power (P) is equal to the voltage multiplied by the current; the Power is delivered via the radiofrequency electrode. Depending on the tissue impedance, the power will need further adjustment, ensuring the 
proper voltage/current is delivered to satisfy the tissue impedance. Finally, thermal 
sensors – thermocouples – integrated within the radiofrequency electrode to allow for 
accurate measurement of tissue temperature and th e system will adjust power to maintain 
the physician selected therapeutic temperature. With these proper controls in place, selective thermogenesis serves as a viable treatment for numerous medical conditions.  The generation of heat is enough to promote tissue necrosis within a defined area. Accordingly, percutaneous radiofrequency can be administered for destruction of terminal fibers, which in turn, contracts tissue. Overall, percutaneous radiofrequency administers energy in a highly selective manner to induce the desired clinical outcome; “lift” achieved through tissue contracture and tightening.  
 
3.2. Regulatory Status 
 
The ThermiRF
® Device is classified by the FDA/IEC as a Class 2 radiofrequency device. 
The device used in this study was cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for dermatological and general surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis [K130689] .

6.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
 
This is an open-label, single-center, single-treatment prospective evaluation of the ThermiRF device in the treatment of submental skin laxity.   The purpose of this prospective study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of the ThermiRF device in achieving overall submental lift. 
In this study, “Lift” is defined as a ≥ 20 mm
2 lift of the submental area after the 
ThermiRF treatment. 
A total of 70 male and female healthy volunteers between the age of 35 and 65 will be 
considered for this study.  Subjects who sign the informed consent form and meet all 
entry criteria will be enrolled in this study and will be assigned a unique number/code to 
preserve confidentiality. 
A total of six study visits are planned as described below: 
x Visit 1:  Screening visit  – (Day 1) 
x Visit 2:  Single Treatment visit  
x Visit 3:  Day 30 safety assessment (± 7 to 14 days)  
x Visit 4: Day 60 safety and Image capture for validation exercise (± 7 to 14 days)  
x Visit 5:  Day 90 safety and effectiveness follow-up visit (± 7 to 14 days)  
x Visit 6:  Day 180 safety and effectiveness follow-up visit - (± 7 to 14 days)  
Photo images (2D and 3D) will be collected at Visits 1, Visit 4 (on first 30 subjects only), 
and at Visits 5 and 6 using a standard camera (2D) and the Vectra XT system (3D).   The 
purpose of the photos are to quantitatively and qualitative evaluate treatment 
effectiveness using objective and subjective assessments to measure physical changes to 
the skin’s microstructure and aesthetic skin features  over time. 
A skin elasticity assessment using the Cutomer® will be collected at Visits 1 (screening), 
5 (Day 90) and 6 (Day 180) to assess if any biomechanical changes of the skin occurred 
as a result of the ThermiRF treatment. 
Safety assessments will be collected using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) a 10-point 
scale, and adverse events reports (observed or reported). 
The overall study duration is approximately 12 months (i.e., 5-6 month recruitment 
period and 6 month study visits).   
6.2. Discussion of the Study Design and Subject Selection 
 
The study design represents a prospective evaluation of the ThermiRF system effectiveness in the treatment of submental laxity throu gh electrocoagulation and neocollagenesis 
towards achieving Lift.  Submental laxity is a common occurrence of the aging population affecting not only the submental area near the uppe r part of the neck but also the jawline.  
For the purposes of this study, subjects between the ages of 35 and 65 years old, are likely 
to show architectural changes of aging on the submental area, with a clearly noticeable

Page 15 of 51 “mild to moderate” severity defined as having “normal”  muscle, “mild to moderate”  skin 
laxity and “mild to moderate”  fat.  Sub ject’s skin laxity severity will be confirmed by the 
investigator at the screening visit to ensure appropriateness in subject selection. In an effort to eliminate variance across the group and with respect to treatment response, each subject will serve as his/her own control   The application of RF treatment  on this category of subjects is  “superficial” in nature 
with no adjuvant therapies needed.  It is anticipated the benef its will be “lift”  of the 
treated (submental) area following a minimally invasive approach resulting in less adverse outcomes such as swelling, bruising, and pain.

7.6. Blinded Rater Reliability Assessment 
 
Prior to the completion of the study, the panel of raters will undergo a validation process 
as defined by the sponsor using photo images collected at Day 60.  The method used to evaluate and validate the reliability of the blinded panel (Appendix 10), will follow the 
approach taken by Kim, et al. [5], where a range of possible outcomes can be detected 
from “no improvement” to “some improvement” to “significant imp rovement”  at the 
specified time point.  The approach implemented by Kim, et. al., is deemed consistent 
with ICH guidelines for validation of analytical procedures. 
7.7. Expected / Unexpected Risk 
The anticipated risks and/or discomforts associated with the procedure are described 
below: 
General Statement: 
The device has risk of burns or fire, and therefore, cannot be used near conductive 
materials such as metal bed parts, inner-spring mattress, etc.  A disposable grounding pad is used to ground/neutralize the electrical current.   Subjects undergoing radiofrequency treatment will be kept away from contact with metal parts 
which are grounded or which have appreciable capacitance to earth.   The device cannot be used in subjects with a pacemaker, implantable defibrillators, or 
monitoring equipment. 
Risk Associate with the PRD Procedure 
Known risks associated with the use of ThermiRF include:  
x Erythema 
x Edema 
x Electric shock: operator risk only: mitigated through electrical safety testing. 
x Postoperative pain and edema that resolved within three days 
x Second-degree burn treatment 
x Treatment induced ulcers and fistulas 
 
Although no immediate risks are anticipated, all aspects of this clinical 
investigation will be conducted under the direct supervision and oversight of the 
investigator and designated study staff.  Adverse events whether spontaneous, or self-reported, will be collected and analyzed. 
 
Other Risk 
Surgical shock, pulmonary complications, irregular surface area.  Proper pre and post 
treatment safety precautions will reduce the risk of these complications.

Upon arrival, subjects will have the following assessments performed:  
x Verify conformance with eligibility criteria 
x Urine pregnancy test (must be performed prior to treatment at V1 or V2)  
 Provided the subject conforms to all entry criteria, the subject will be prepared for surgery and the visit will proceed as follow:  The subjects will be placed in a sitting or supine position.  Using a surgical pen or marker the investigator will outline the treatment ar ea and the area will be anesthetized using 
tumescent solution containing lidocaine and ep inephrine.  Sufficient time will be allowed 
for the anesthesia to take effect prior to the surgical procedure 
 
Up to three small incisions measuring approximately 2 mm in length will be made to the 
right and left of the jaw line below the ear l obe, and below the chin.  Each incisions will 
act as the point of entry for the investigational device probe.  
 The depth of penetration is approximately 2 mm below the dermis.  The affected area of the neck will be infused with standard tumescent Hunstad formula (50-100cc).  The investigator will proceed with the treatment by inserting the electrode to the distal portion of the first pass.  Once in position, and the electrode temperature will be brought to the “procedure set temperature” in accordance with the suggested te mperature ranges below 
(Figure 4).

Page 25 of 51 9. ASSESSMENTS    
9.1. Clinical Evaluations 
 
The following clinical evaluations will be conducted during the study review: 
 
x Medical and medication history  – An assessment of the participant’s  health status 
prior to enrollment to ascertain appropri ateness for study participation based on 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
x Brief Physical Examination – A brief physical exam of the major organ systems will 
be performed at Visit 1 (screening) to assess the subject’s phy sical/medical state prior 
to Visit 2.  Adverse events reported during the conduct of the study will be evaluated 
by organ system with respect to the baseline physical evaluation. 
 
x Vital Signs - Collected at Visit 1 (screening) and will include pulse, respiration, heart 
rate (systolic and diastolic), temperature, height and weight.  The height and weight 
will be used to calculate and confirm the body mass index (BMI) requirement.     
 
x Urine Pregnancy Assessments - Urine pregnancy test will be collected (for females 
of child bearing potential) at Visit 2 prior to treatment.  Subjects with a positive result 
will be excluded from the study. 
 
x Adverse Event Reporting – Investigator examination of the treatment area and 
surrounding anatomy and notation of any observations made by the study investigator 
of a potential adverse event.  
 
x Cutometer Elasticity Measurement – an elasticity measurement use to determine 
skin pliability prior to, and post treatment.  This measurement may serve as an 
indicator for how the subject’s dermis will behave after exposure to RF treatment 
(Appendix 6).  
x Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)  – a unidimensional 10-point scale used to measure 
pain intensity from “no pain”  to “worst pain possible” ( Appendix 7). 
 
x Photography  - Standard photo images (2D) and 3D photography using the Vectra 
XT will be collected for study visits as defined in the protocol.  The subject 
positioning is planned to deliver the following views: 
 
o “frontal view” ; 
o “lateral Right and Left view” ; 
o “ 450 angle Right and Left” .   
 
For reproducibility of the subject’s positioning during the phot o session, every effort will 
be made by the investigator to replicate th e same position and facial expressions from

Page 27 of 51 10. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
10.1. Introduction 
All observed or volunteered adverse events regardless of treatment group or suspected 
causal relationship to the ID(s) will be reported as described in the following sections.  
For all adverse events, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both 
to determine the outcome of the adverse event and to assess whether it meets the criteria 
for classification as a serious adverse event requiring immediate notification to the sponsor or its designated representative.  For all adverse events, sufficient information 
should be obtained by the investigator to try to  determine the causality of the event.  For 
adverse events with a suspected causal relationship to the ID, follow-up by the investigator is required until the event or its sequel resolve or stabilize at a level 
acceptable to the investigator, and Sponsor concurs with that assessment. 
10.2. Reporting Period 
Serious adverse events  require immediate notification within 24 hours  to the Sponsor or 
its designated representative. When reporting a serious adverse event, the investigator or 
designee completes the SAE form with as much information as possible however, at a 
minimum the Subject ID, Name of ID, SAE, and Name of person reporting the event. The completed form must be: 
x Emails to the sponsor: 
Attention:  Toni Fournier __ (Vice President Commercialization)  
PH: 617- 216-8211  
Email: Tfournier@thermi.com  
And,  
Attention:  Claudia Jennings __ (Study Manager-Thermi Consultant)  
Phone: 973-222-8335  
Email: Cjennings@Thermi.com  
 
All adverse events (serious and non-serious) must be collected on the subject’s CRF from 
the time the subject signed informed consent through last subject visit. 
10.3. Definition of an Adverse Event 
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation 
associated with the use of an investigational product in human subjects.  The event need 
not necessarily have a suspected causal relationship with the treatment or usage.   
Examples of adverse events include but are not limited to:   
Investigational Device:  ThermiRF  
Protocol No.:  Thermi_0005 Version Date:  Final 10-May-2016 
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL 
Page 28 of 51 x Abnormal test findings 
x Clinically significant symptoms and signs 
x Changes in physical examination findings 
x Hypersensitivity 
x Progression/worsening of underlying disease 
Additionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from: 
x Product misuse 
x Product dependency 
x Extravasation 
x Study related procedure 
10.4. Serious Adverse Events 
A medical device adverse event is serious when both of the following criteria are 
fulfilled: 
x The event involves patient/subject/consumer contact 
x The event results in: 
 Death 
 Serious deterioration in state of health.  This includes: 
o Life-threatening illness or injury 
o Permanent impairment of a body function 
o Permanent damage to a body structure 
 Requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent 
impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure 
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization 
10.5. Severity Assessment 
If required on the adverse event case report forms, the investigator will use the 
adjectives MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity of the adverse event.  For purposes of consistency, these intensity grades are defined as 
follows:
 
MILD  Does not interfere with subject's usual function.  
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with s ubject's usual function. 
SEVERE  Interferes significantly with subject's usual function.  
Investigational Device:  ThermiRF  
Protocol No.:  Thermi_0005 Version Date:  Final 10-May-2016 
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL 
Page 29 of 51 Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an adverse event.  A 
severe event is not necessarily a serious event.  For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with subject's usual function) but would not be classified as 
serious unless it met one of the criteria for serious adverse events, listed above. 
10.6. Causality Assessment 
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be prov ided for all adverse events 
(serious and non- serious).  An investigator’s causality assessment is the determ ination of 
whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the ID caused or contributed to an 
adverse event.  If the investigator’s final determi nation of causality is unknown and the 
investigator does not know whether or not ID caused the event, then the event will be 
handled as “related to ID” for reporting purposes.  If the investigator's causality 
assessment is "unknown but not related to ID", this should be clearly documented on 
study records.   
In addition, if the investigator determines a serious adverse event is associated with study 
procedures, the investigator must record this suspected causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with 
the serious adverse event reporting requirements, if applicable.

COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL 
Page 30 of 51 11. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE 
SIZE 
All data collected on CRFs will be presented in data listings. The safety analyses will be 
carried out using the safety population. All efficacy analyses will be analyzed using the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population.  Any formal statistical tests will be performed at α = 
0.05 and will be two-sided, unless otherwise specified. All statistical analyses will be 
conducted in a validated instance of SAS 9.1 or higher.  Other analyses, including the 
creation of figures, may be performed in SAS 9.1 or higher or R 3.2.4 or higher. 
11.1. Study Hypothesis 
The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the ThermiRF™ in the 
treatment of submental skin laxity with respect to “Lift”.  The  study design assumes that 
at least 70% of the population that consists of the target demographic (those that meet the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria) will have 20 mm
2 or more of lift.  The null hypothesis is that 
subjects have a response rate of 45% or lower. 
11.2. Sample Size Determination 
The sample size calculation is based on the following assumptions: 
x The true response rate for subjects that do not drop out will be 70%. 
x The null response rate is 45%, so a successful trial will reject the null hypothesis 
that the true response rate is less than or equal to 45%. 
x The dropout rate will be approximately 12.5%.  While some subjects that drop out 
may have data from Day 60 that can be carried forward in the primary 
effectiveness analysis, the sample size calculation assumes that none does and will therefore be treated as non-responders. 
x The primary effectiveness analysis is based on a one-sided binomial proportion 
test that compares the null proportion to the alternative proportion. 
Based on these assumptions, a minimum of 68 subjects is required to achieve 80% power 
at one-sided α = 0.05, so a sample size of 70 subjects provides greater than 80% power. 
Additionally based on the rule of three, sample size of at least 60 makes it possible to 
observe any adverse event that occurs with a frequency > 5% with  95% confidence. 
11.3. Analysis Populations 
x Intent-to-Treat (ITT):  The ITT population includes all subjects that meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, have a signed informed consent form, and are 
enrolled in the study.  The primary effectiveness analysis will be on the ITT 
population. 
x Safety:  The safety population will include all randomized subjects who received 
at least one treatment.

Protocol No.:  Thermi_0005 Version Date:  Final 10-May-2016 
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL 
Page 31 of 51 x Per-Protocol Population (PPP): The PPP will include all subjects who: 
o Completed the Day 90 visit 
o Have an evaluable photograph to estimate area of lift from the Day 90 
visit 
o Have not used an excluded medication 
11.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic data and baseline characteristi cs will be summarized for the Safety 
population.  Demographic data (age, gende r, ethnicity and race) and baseline 
characteristics (height, weight, BMI, he art rate, respiration, blood pressure, and 
temperature) will be summarized in a table and presented in a listing.  A summary of all 
prior and concomitant medications will be presented. 
11.5. Analyses 
11.5.1  Primary Effectiveness Analysis 
 
The primary effectiveness analysis will compare the proportion of subjects who respond to treatment by achieving at least 20 mm
2 of lift of the submental region to a null 
proportion 45% using a one-sided binomial proportion test at α = 0.05.  Responders will 
be determined based on change from baseline of area as measured by Vectra XT 3D photography in standard lighting conditions.  The primary effectiveness analysis will be based on the ITT population, so any missing data, including withdrawn consent and lost 
to follow up, will be treated as non-response. 
11.5.2  Secondary Effectiveness Analyses 
 
Analysis of all effectiveness endpoints will be conducted on the ITT population and on the PP population.  Continuous endpoints will be tested using the paired t-test, ordinal 
endpoints will use the Wilcoxon-Pratt signed rank test, and binary endpoints will be tested using the binomial proportion test.  Raters’ assessment of improvement will be validated based on a comparison of the 
blinded raters’ assessments to unblinded raters’ assessments at  Day 60 as outlined in Kim 
et al. (Kim et al. 2004) using 30 subjects at Day 60 selected at random.  Two unblinded clinicians, who know which photos are baseline and which are Day 60, will assess the 2D 
photography at baseline and Day 60.  Three blinded clinicians, who do not know which 
photos are baseline and which are Day 60, will assess the same photos.  The assessments of the unbl inded and blinded raters will be compared using Cohen’s unweigh ted kappa 
statistic (Fleiss et al. 1969).  The assessments will be considered validated according to the scale detailed by Landis et al. (Landis & Koch 1977), where <0.00 is considered poor agreement, 0.00-0.20 is slight agreement, 0.21-0.40 is fair agreement, 0.41-0.60 is moderate agreement, 0.61-0.80 is substantial agreement, and >0.80 is almost perfect 
agreement.  Accordingly, any score greater than 0.60 will validate the method.

13.1. Protocol Amendments and Administrative Changes 
Amendments and administrative changes are not to be made to this protocol without 
consultation with and the agreement of the Sponsor.  The investigator and Sponsor should discuss amendment or administrative change.  If agreement is reached, such amendment 
or administrative change will be developed in writing by the Sponsor and submitted to 
the investigator. 
The investigator will be responsible for ensuring that all protocol amendments are 
approved in writing by the appropriate IRB or IEC before the institution of the changes 
specified in the amendment (except when nece ssary to eliminate an immediate hazard to 
the subjects).  The investigator will also ensure that the Sponsor receives a copy of the 
written IRB or IEC approval of these changes. 
The investigator will be responsible for ensuring that the IRB or IEC receives written 
notification of all administrative changes to the protocol prior to institution of the 
specified changes.  The investigator will ensure that the Sponsor receives a copy of these 
written notifications. 
13.2. Data Handling and Record Keeping 
The investigator will document all study related procedures directly on the source record 
or medical chart as the primary source of data collection.  Study related information/data 
points required by the sponsor for analysis will be transcribed by the investigator or designee from the source record, onto the CRF/eCRF (data collection tool) for this study 
using good documentation practices.   
In some instances, the sponsor will provide a CRF template for use as the primary source 
of data collection. 
The investigator is encouraged, however not required to maintain additional source 
records on matters respective to the subject’s safety and wellb eing not already captured 
on the CRFs/eCRF or source template.   
Black or blue ink must be used on all data collection requirements.  All errors and 
omissions must be crossed out by means of a single line, and the date and initials of the 
correction or addition of correct informati on must be provided.  Use of white-out or 
write-overs will not be permitted.  All study related records will be kept in a secure and 
locked location, and shall only be accessible to the assigned study personnel during the 
conduct of the study, and to the regulatory authorities in the event of an inspection. 
13.3. Case Report Forms / Electronic Data Record 
As used in this protocol, the term case report form (CRF) should be understood to refer to 
either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study.

Page 35 of 51 A CRF is required and should be completed for each enrolled subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole property of the sponsor and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of the sponsor or 
appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from the sponsor. 
It is the investigator's responsibility to ensure completion, review and approve all CRFs.  
CRFs must be signed by the investigator or by an authorized staff member.  These 
signatures serve to attest that the information contained on the CRFs is true and accurate.   
At all times, the investigator has final personal responsibility for the accuracy and 
authenticity of all clinical and laboratory data entered on the CRFs.    In cases where the 
source documents are the hospital or the physician's chart, the information collected on 
the CRFs must match those charts.  
13.4. Record Retention 
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or the Sponsor, the 
investigator agrees to keep records including the identity of all participating subjects 
(sufficient information to link records, e.g., CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent forms, copies of all CRFs, serious adverse event forms, source 
documents, and detailed records of treatment di sposition.  The records should be retained 
by the investigator according to ICH guidelines, local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement, whichever is longer. 
If the investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the study, the 
Sponsor should be prospectively notified of the event, and the location of study records. 
The study records must be transferred to an acceptable designee, such as another 
investigator, another institution, or to the Sponsor.   
The investigator must obtain Sponsor's written permission before disposing of any 
records, even if retention requirements have been met.

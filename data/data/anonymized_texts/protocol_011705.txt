/alemtuzumab/GZ402673  STUDY No : ASY15905  
TITLE  Collection of blood samples from   patients with relapsing  forms of 
Multiple Sclerosis  (RMS) who have developed Immune 
thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) after LEMTRADA® treatment  
INVESTIGATOR/TRIAL LOCATION  USA;  may be expanded to Canada 
STUDY OBJECTIVE(S)  Primary objective:  
To collect b lood samples, in a new cohort of RMS patients   who have 
developed Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) after LEMTRADA  
treatment, for future DNA analysis as part of a global biomarker project 
assessing pre -identified candidate SNPs associated to the 
develo pment of ITP after LEMTRADA treatment.   
Exploratory objective s: 
 To collect from these patients additional serum, plasma,
circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and
RNA samples together with their retrospective demographic
and clinical data  related to MS disease and ITP status.
STUDY DESIGN  Phase IV , single -center, non-randomized study.  
Some retrospective demographic and clinical  data will be captured 
through the patient’s physician, patient reporting, and medical records. 
The only interve ntion will be the blood draw s performed during study  
visit(s). 
This study is part of a global biomarker project that aims to collect 
samples from different studies to potentially confirm correlations 
between  ITP and other autoimmune conditions and specific  single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genetic set . 
STUDY POPULATION  
Main selection criteria:  Inclusion criteria : 
I 01. Male and female a dult patients who have been treated  with 
LEMTRADA , with development of ITP subsequent to 
treatment. Patients do not need to be currently on 
LEMTRADA  treatment . 
I 02. Patients who have s igned the study informed consent form 
(ICF) . 
Total expected number of patients:  Approximately 35 
Expected number of sites:  1 center  
STUDY TREATMENT(s)  No investigational medicinal product(s) will be administered to  
patients . 
PRIMARY ENDPOINT(S) AND MAIN 
SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  Primary endpoints : DNA will be  extracted from peripheral blood 
Exploratory endpoints :  
 Peripheral blood will be collected for the preparation of
serum, plasma, and PBMCs , which will be stored for up to
5 years , and RNA , which  will be stored up to 15 years  after
completion of the study .

disease and ITP status  will be collected for correlative 
analysis . 
Safety : Adverse ev ents and serious adverse events related to study 
procedures  during the visit (s).  
ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE  The study will consist of one single  visit which includes a subject 
interview and a blood draw.  However, for safety reason and  at the 
discretion of the m edical team, the blood draw mig ht occur in more 
than one visit,  
Blood  draw  will be performed to collect samples from which DNA, 
serum,  plasma, PBMC s, and RNA  will be further extracted . 
Additionally the following data points will be captured if available fr om 
the prescriber, patient, and/or medical records : 
 Age/date of birth, gender, race/e thnicity  
 Body mass index ( BMI) if possible , otherwise most recent 
weight and height  from medical records  
 Time since MS s ymptom onset/ MS diagnosis  
 Previous MS therapies  
 Prior history of ITP /  coagulation disorders, thyroid or renal 
problems ; date of ITP symptoms/diagnosis onset  
 Prior evidence of other autoimmunity disorders  
 Symptoms associated with ITP prior to time of diag nosis  
 Details of laboratory and medical confirmation of ITP clinical 
diagnosis  
 Treatments and duration to achieve response/resolution of 
ITP 
 Smoking history  
 Recent laboratory data (last data available): platelets, thyroid 
function, urinalysis  
 Present MS cl inical status:  
- Medical record documentation of time and intensity of 
relapses  
- Recent magnetic resonance imaging reports  
- Recent (1 -2 years) evidence of disability progression  
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 Sample  size determination  
Sample size for this study  was based upon empirical considerations. 
No sample size calculation was performed.  
Phamacogenomic  analysis  
The statistical analysis of pharmacogenetics variables will be part of a 
global biomarker program and is not in the scope of this study.  
Safety  
Safety analysis (AEs  and SAEs ) will be based on the review of 
individual values, and descriptive statistics.   
DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD  
(per patient)  One to 70 days . 
One visit is required for blood draw . However, f or safety reason and  at 
the discretion of the  medical team, the blood draw might occur in more 
than one visit.

4.1 INTRODUCTION  
Multiple sclerosis (MS ) is a demyelinating disease of the centr al nervous system (CNS ) that  
affects more than  2.3 million people worldwide (1). Its clinical course is typically  characterized 
by initial episodes of transient neurological compromise with full recovery,  followed by a phase 
of cumulative deficits that may increase with each new episode. Most  relapsing patients 
eventually develop secondary progression leading to a constellation of chronic  sequelae includ ing 
profound muscle weakness, impaired gait and mobility, bladder and bowel  dysfunction, and 
cognitive and visual impairments.  MS is believed to arise from the interplay of polygenic 
inherited susceptibility and as yet  unidentified environmental agents. Ag e of onset typically 
ranges from 10 to 59 years, with most  cases occurring between 20 and 40 years of age. As with 
most other autoimmune disorders, MS is  more than twice as common among women. 
Pathologically, MS is characterized by focal and nonfocal  tissue injury of the brain and spinal 
cord due to the complex interplay of inflammation,  demyelination, axonal injury, astrocytosis, and 
tissue atrophy. Lymphocytes are believed to play a  central role in MS pathogenesis.  
Alemtuzumab ( LEMTRADA®) is a humanized m onoclonal antibody that binds to CD52, a cell  
surface antigen present at high levels on T and B lymphocytes, and at lower levels on natural  
killer cells, monocytes, and macrophages (2). Alemtuzumab acts throug h antibody -dependent 
cellular cytolysis and complement -dependent cytotoxicity following cell surface binding to T and 
B lymphocytes.  The mechanism by which alemtuzumab exerts its therapeutic effects in MS is 
unknown, but may  involve immunomodulation throug h the depletion and repopulation of 
lymphocytes  subsets.  It effects rapid and sustained lymphocyte depletion and has shown potent 
efficacy in treatment -naïve as well as treatment -refractory patients with relapsing remitting 
multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Treat ment with alemtuzumab 12 mg/day is efficacious in patients 
with RRMS and is associated with clinically meaningful and statistically significant 
improvements in clinical endpoints, imaging endpoints and composite disease measures, 
compared with subcutaneous  (SC), high -dose, high -frequency interferon -beta-1a (IFNB -1a). 
The most important adverse r eactions are autoimmunity (eg, i mmune thrombocytopenic purpura 
(ITP), thyroid disorders,  nephropathi es, cytopenias), infusion -associated reactions, and serious 
infections. Serious events of ITP have been observed in approximately 2% of patients with 
relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS ) treated  with alemtuzumab in clinical trials. The onset of ITP 
generally occurred between 14 and 36 months after the first alemtuzumab exposure but might also 
occur later.  Fatality in the index case of ITP, which was reported in the Phase 2 study, highlights 
the seriousness of the risks associated with the disorder.

In a previous analysis on  a small number of  patients  from the Ph3 clinical trial population , a 
specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP ) genetic set  was identified show ing a strong 
correlation with development of ITP after treatment by alemtuzumab  (unpublished internal data) . 
However samples from an independent cohort of post -marketing RMS patients who have 
developed I TP would be needed to confirm these data.  
The current study  will focus on the collection of blood samples to extract  DNA from patient s who 
developed ITP consequently to Lemtrada treatment. The DNA will be subjected to  further 
sequencing  pre-identified sp ecific candidate genes of interest to evaluate their polymorphism 
status and correlate these assessments with demographic and clinical data from the patients as 
well as the occurrence of LEMTRADA -induced ITP.  DNA sequencing and corresponding 
analysis are n ot part of this study . 
Complementary to these objectives  serum, plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC s), 
and RNA samples will be collected and stored to be further explored in t his patient population to 
potentially identify new safety and LEMTRADA  treatment response markers . 
This study is part of a global biomarker project that aims to collect samples from different studies 
to potentially confirm correlations between ITP and othe r autoimmune conditions and specific 
SNP genetic set. Genomic data collected in other studies from MS patients who are treated with 
LEMTRADA  but did not develop any autoimmune condition will be used as controls to validate 
the preliminary findings.  The ultimate goal of this global biomarker project is to enhance the 
benefit/ risk ratio of LEMTRADA  with the objective of discovering a panel of biomar kers to 
predict which patients are at risk of developing auto -immunity events .

Adverse events ( AEs) and serious adverse events ( SAE s) related to study procedures will be 
recorded spanning from the signature of the ICF until the end of the study. As there is no 
investigational product administration, assessment of the relationship of AE s or SAEs to 
procedures (ie, blood sampling) will be performed by both the Investigator and the Sponsor.  
9.2 PHARMACOGENETIC S 
9.2.1  Pharmacogenetic assessment  
Sampl es will be processed for DNA  isolation .  
These blood sample s will be transferred to a site that will, on behalf of Sanofi, extract DNA.  
Material extracted will remain labelled with the same identifiers used d uring the study (ie, patient  
ID, sample ID ). The y will be transferred to a Sponsor site (or a subcontractor site ) which can be 
located outside of the country  where the study is conducted. DNA  and RNA sample collection, 
handling, storage, and future analysis will conform to all applicable national guidan ce and 
regulations.   
As part of a global biomarker program and outside the scope of this study, this DNA will be 
further subjected to sequencing  analysis. Genomic data generated from these samples will be used 
to confirm  previous  findings of a potential se t of SNPs  observed  in patients with RMS who have 
developed ITP after LEMTRADA treatment.  
The DNA will  be stored for up to 15 years from the completion of the clinical study report in the 
US.  
9.2.2  Sampling times

The Investigator is the primary person responsible for m aking all clinically relevant decisions on 
safety issues.  
10.1 ADVERSE EVENT MONITO RING  
All events will be managed and reported in compliance with all applicable regulations, an d 
included in the final clinical study report.  
10.2 DEFINITIONS OF ADVER SE EVENTS  
10.2.1  Adverse event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
Adverse even ts and SAEs  related to study procedures will be recorded spanning from the 
signature of the ICF until the end of the study. As there is no investigational product 
administration, assessment of the relationship of AE s or SAEs to procedures (ie, blood sampli ng) 
will be performed by both the Investigator and the Sponsor.  
Adverse even ts will be graded according National Cancer Institute ( NCI) Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE ) v4.03 and classified by system organ class / preferred term 
according the last available version of the MedDRA dictionary. For AEs not included in the NCI 
CTCAE, the Investigat or will be required to assess the intensity of the adverse drug/biologic 
experience using the CTCAE general guideline:  
 Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
 Grade 2:  Moderate; min imal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age 
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL ). Instrumental ADL refer to 
preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clot hes, using the telephone, managing money, 
etc. 
 Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care 
ADL. Self -care ADL refer to bathing, d ressing and undressing, feeding self, using the 
toilet, taking medications and not bedridden.  
 Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
 Grade 5:  Death related to AE.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential  Page 24 10.2.2  Serious adverse event  
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any un toward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death, or  
 Is life -threatening, or  
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not ref er to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
 Is a congenital anomaly/bi rth defect, or  
 Is a medically important event:  
- Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention  to prevent one of 
the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  
Note: Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency roo m or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, alanine 
aminotransferase ( ALT )> 3 x upper limit of normal ( ULN ) + total bilirubin > 2 x ULN 
or asymptomatic ALT increase > 10 x ULN, or development of drug dependenc e or 
drug abuse.    
10.3 OBLIGATION OF THE IN VESTIGATOR REGARDING  SAFETY REPORTING  
10.3.1  General guidelines for reporting adverse events  
All AEs  related to stud y procedure s, regardless of seriousness , spanning from the signature of the 
ICF until the end of the study as defined by the protocol, are to be recorded on the corresponding 
page(s) or screen(s) of the case report form  (CRF ) for included subjects. For screen failed 
subjects, recording in the CRF  is only performed in case of SAE occurring during the screening 
period or in case of AE when some screening procedures expose the subject to safety risks 
(eg, any substance administered as pretreatment or for phenotyping, invasive tests performed or 
chronic treatment interrupted).  
Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. The 
Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensit y (see definitions in Section  10.2.1 ), 
correc tive treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed (eg, in the case of 
dermatologic lesions photographs are required), outcome, and Investigator’s /Sponsor’s  opinion .

ASY15905  - alemtuzumab  Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential  Page 25 In order to ensure the safety of the subjects, the Investigator should take appropriate measures to 
follow all AEs until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, 
or until progression h as been stabilized, or until death.  This may imply that observations will 
continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol, and that additional investigations may be 
requested by the monitoring team.  
10.3.2  Guidelines for reporting serious adverse events  
In the case of a SAE, the Investigator must immediately:  
 SEND (within  24 hours , preferably by fax or e -mail)  the signed and dated corresponding 
page(s) in the CRF  to the representative of the monitoring team whose name, fax number, 
and e -mail address appear on  the clinical trial protocol.  
 ATTACH the photocopy of all examinations carried out and the dates on which these 
examinations were performed. Care should be taken to ensure that the subject’s identity is 
protected and the subject’s identifiers in the clinic al trial are properly mentioned on any 
copy of source document provided to the Sponsor. For laboratory results, include the 
laboratory normal ranges.  
 All further documentation should be sent to the monitoring team within 24 hours of 
knowledge. In addition,  every effort should be made to further document within the week 
(7 days) following initial notification any SAE  that is fatal or life threatening.  
Any SAE brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after the end of the study for the 
subject  and considered by the Investigator to be caused by the study procedures  with a reasonable 
possibility, should be reported to the monitoring team.

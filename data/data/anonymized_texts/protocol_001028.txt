Studied period (years):

  Date of last completed: TBD  Phase of development:   2 
Objective s:  
The principle objective of this study is to evaluate the hypothesis that INTERCEPT Platelets in 100% plasma stored for 5 or more days ( up to 7 days ) after apheresis collection retain 
sufficient viability for therapeutic transfusion efficacy. T he post -infusion recovery and survival  
of autologous radiolabeled  7 day  INTERCEPT platelets  (Test) stored  in 100% plasma will be 
measured in comparison to “fresh” autologous radiolabeled platelets ( Control ) according to 
FDA guidance for platelet testing (FDA 1999)  in Stage 2 of this study protocol . 
A secondary objective is to compare the r ecovery and survival results for Test platelets 
prepared for radiolabeling using the procedures outlined by the Biomedical Excellence for Safer Transfusion Colla boration (BEST , Appendix B ) or a  variation of the BEST procedure 
(referred to as Variant  1, Appendix C ) in Stage 1 of this study protocol . Cerus has 
demonstrated that the  Variant  1 method, which does not  incorporate an initial soft spin in the 
presence of ACD -A, results in improved in vitro  platelet recovery and quality during 
preparation for radiolabeling compared to the BEST procedure. This comparison will evaluate the hypothesis that preparation methods prior to radiolabeling may influence  in vitro  quality of 
the radiolabeled platelets and  post -infusion viability outcome s.

Study Design  
The study will be performed in two  stages (Table S -1). Stage 1 is a randomized, 2 -period 
crossover design. Test platelets stored for 7 days will be radiolabeled based on either the BEST 
or Variant  1 methods (depending on the period and randomization scheme for the Test 
platelets) for 12 healthy subjects.  The recovery and survival for Test platelets prepared with 
the BEST and Variant  1 methods will be compared with each other and against the  fresh 
platelet Control. With agreement from the FDA (BQ200481, July 8, 2020), completion of 
Stage 1 is not required.  
Stage 2 is a single arm design.  Test platelets from 24 healthy subjects , stored for 7 days , will 
be prepared for radiolabeling following the Variant  1 methodology.  The recovery and survival 
for Test platelets will be compared against the fresh platelet Control. Stage 1 subjects with  
evaluable Variant 1 method data will contribute to the require ment of the 24 subjects for Stage 
2. 
For both stages, t he study population will consist of healthy subjects who meet the FDA, 
AABB, and site -specific research donor eligibility criteria for apheresis platelet donation.  
Apheresis platelets will be collecte d in 100% plasma  on the Trima Accel® Automated Blood 
Collection  system .  
Each study apheresis collection will be processed using the INTERCEPT Blood System for 
Platelets . Platelet c omponents  containing 3.0 to 7.9 x1011 platelets in 300 to 420 mL of plasma 
will be processed using the INTERCEPT Dual Storage (DS) set.  The INTERCEPT process 
will begin on either the day of collection  (Day 0) or the day following donation (Day 1); 
illumination must occur within 24 hours after the end of collection. Test  platelet s components 
will be stored for up to 7 days, from day of collection, in 100% plasma.   
During each stage s amples  for in vitro  platelet testing will be collected prior to INTERCEPT 
treatment  (Day 0/1) , post INTERC EPT treatment and at the end of storage, Day 7 (see In vitro  
evaluation of platelets below).  
At the end of storage , an aliquot of Test platelets  will be aseptically removed from each 
subject’s INTERCEPT platelet storage container for preparation of samples for  radiolabelin g 
using either the BEST (Stage 1) or Variant  1 (Stages 1 and 2) methodology.  The in vitro  
quality of the Test platelet sample  used for radiolabeling will be assessed prior to and 
following the pre -radiolabeling platelet sample preparations. The i ndices to be measured  in 
Stage 1  are volume, pH 22°C, CD62P, platelet count , red blood cell (RBC) count and white 
blood cell (WBC) count .  Assessments of these indices will enab le the determination of platelet 
processing recovery for each  sample preparation method and evaluation of RBC and WBC 
contamination in samples prior to radiolabeling. In Stage 2 platelet processing recovery during 
sample preparation will be calculated from  volume and platelet count  and pH 22°C, will be 
measured in the sample prior to radiolabeling . 
On the day corresponding to the end of storage for the Test component, healthy subjects will 
return to the site , and 43 mL of whole blood (WB) will be  drawn into a syringe containing 
9 mL of Anticoagulant Citrate Dextrose Solution, Formula A ( ACD- A). The sample will be 
used to prepare Control platelets following the BEST methodology . Test and Control platelets

Platelets treated with the INTERCEPT 
Pathogen Reduction System Suspended in 100% Plasma  and stored for up to 7 days  
will be randomly radiolabeled with either 51Cr (approximately10 -30μCi) as sodium 
radiochromate (Na 251CrO 4) or 111In (approximately 10- 30 μCi) as indium oxine , depending 
upon the randomization assignment  and period as  applicable. Subjects will be randomized with 
equal probability to the radiolabeling sequences (111In/51Cr vs. 51Cr/111In) for Test/Control.  
The isotope labels will be assigned randomly with equal probability that Control and Test platelets will be labeled with each isotope, and the same randomization  assignment of isotope 
labels will b e utilized for both apheresis collections for the same subject  in Stage 1 . After 
radiolabeling, the autologous Control and Test platelet samples will be simultaneously infused into the subject (approximately 10- 30 mL). A negative pregnancy test for females of 
childbearing potential is required before infusion. 
Blood samples  will be  drawn immediately before infusion and for radioactivity measurements 
at 1 hour ± 15 min and 2 hours  ± 15 min post -infusion (Day 0) , and 6 more samples will be 
drawn at 1, 2, 3, 4 (or 5 or 6), 7 or 8, and 11±1 days post -infusion (DPI) , at approximately the 
same time of day as the radiolabeled platelet infusion was administered (±4 hours). The exact 
time of each sample draw will be recorded.  
For subjects enrolled in S tage 1, there will be a minimum washout period of four  weeks 
between the two study periods (e.g., four  weeks after the last blood sample at 11±1 DPI, in 
Period 1). Subjects will be monitored for safety (adverse events) from the first apheresis 
procedure until  24 hours after  the last DPI  blood sample is drawn.

Radioactivity measurements  
Samples will be obtained from the radiolabeled Control  and Test  platelets  before infusion and 
used as a radioactive standard. T he total dose of radioactivity infused will be calculated  based 
on the volume of labeled platelets infused. In vitro  elution of the label from the transfused 
platelets, as well as the in vivo  elution of  radioactivity from the serial blood samples obtained  
post-infusion will be determined by the BEST elution assessment method ( Appendix B ). 
The radioacti vity of the samples will be determined by use of a gamma counter with correction 
for isotope spill over. Duplicate whole blood (WB) samples will be counted for each time point. Sample dilutions for enumeration of radioactivity of the standards will be calibrated to ensure that measured values are at least 10 -fold above background values. The subject’s WB 
samples will be corrected for t he activity in the cellular fraction determined by simple 
centrifugation and non -platelet residual activity using the 11 ±1 DPI  results . Data points 
greater than 20 hours post -infusion will be used to calculate  the post infusion recovery after all 
radioact ive corrections have been made.  A multiple -hit model will be used to estimate the 
survival of the radioactively labeled platelets.  
At defined  post infusion timepoints , a portion of the subject’s WB  sample  will be applied  to a 
Ficoll gradient  to allow for separation of the RBC/WBC  fraction from the 
plasma/platelet/WBC fraction of the WB .  The radioactivity of the non- RBC and RBC 
fractions will be measured by use of a gamma counter  to allow for the characterization of the 
extent of radiolabeled  RBC contamination in the WB sample.  This assessment will be 
performed at 1, 4 (or 5 or 6), and 11±1 DPI  during  Stage 1 and at 11 ±1 DPI for Stage 2 ; the 
radioactivity will be measured alongside  radioactivity measurement of  the subject’s cellular 
fraction derived from centri fugation of the WB .

Reference therapy  and mode of administration:  
Autologous fresh, whole derived platelets  isolated from platelet rich plasma (Control platelets)  
processed and radiolabeled using the BEST protocol will be administered simultaneously with the radiolabeled T est platelets into the subject. 
 
Criteria for evaluation:  
Efficacy:  
Primary endpoint s 
The primary efficacy endpoints for Stage 1 and Stage 2 : 
• Post-infusion recovery at end of storage   
• Post-infusion survival  at end of storage  
Using the FDA standard on platelet viability by radiolabeling (i.e., recovery and survival compared to a “fresh” autologous platelet sample as control, drawn and prepared on day of 
reinfusion of radiolabeled test samples), the acceptance criteria are:  
• Lower bound of a two- sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the mean treatment 
difference (Test -0.66×Control) in post -infusion recovery is greater than or equal to 
zero.  
• Lower bound of a two- sided 95% CI for the mean treatment difference 
(Test -0.58×Control) in survival is greater than or equal to zero.  
For Stage 1 , the above criteria for recovery and survival of INTERCEPT components will be 
evaluated separately for INTERCEPT platelets  (Test)  labeled with the BEST and Variant  1 
procedures.  
Secondary endpoints  (product  parameter evaluation of platelet components)  
For each stage, t he secondary efficacy endpoints will be summarized descriptively and are 
based on product parameters post -INTERCEPT treatment  and at end of storage.   
Product Parameters at the end of INTERCEPT Treatment  
• Platelet count, volume, and dose (≥3.0×1011)

Platelets treated with the INTERCEPT 
Pathogen Reduction System Suspended in 100% Plasma  and stored for up to 7 days  
Primary endpoints  
Stage 1’s recovery and survival data with 7- day platelet storage will be assessed separately by 
the pre -radiolabeling platelet sample preparation (BEST or Variant 1) and compared with its 
paired control descriptively.   
For Stage 2, t he following acceptance criteria fo r recovery and survival will be used to 
demonstrate  non- inferiority of Test ( stored INTERCEPT treated) platelets against Control 
(fresh) platelets:  
(1) For post -infusion recovery:  
 H0: Test -  0.66×Control <0 vs. H 1: Test -  0.66×Control ≥0 
The null hypothesis will be rejected if the lower bound of a two- sided 95% CI for the mean 
treatment difference (Test -  0.66×Control) is greater than or equal to zero.  
(2) For survival : 
 H0: Test -  0.58×Control <0 vs. H 1: Test -  0.58×Control ≥0 
The null hypothesis will be rejected if the lower bound a two -sided 95% CI for the mean 
treatment difference (Test -  0.58×Control) is greater than or equal to zero.  
The primary analysis population for the primary efficacy endpoints will only include subjects 
who have both pai red (Test and Control) recovery and paired survival data for the relevant 
study stage  and/or radiolabeling method.  The two- sided CIs will be computed using the 
variance estimated from a paired t test.  
In the event that non- inferiority cannot be declared for the primary endpoints for Stage 2  with a 
minimum of 24 evaluable subjects, additional exploratory analyses may be conducted to 
quantify the proportions of subjects whose recovery and survival data me et the 0.66 and 0.58 
cutoff, respectively (e.g., platelet recovery from a Test platelet component greater than or equal 
to 66% of platelet recovery from the paired fresh control platelets). 
Secondary e ndpoints  
Data will be summarized descriptively for each stage.  T he proportions of Test platelet 
components with platelet dose  ≥3.0 ×1011 (end of INTERCEPT treatment) , physical platelet 
recovery ≥80%  (end of INTERCEPT treatment), and pH 22°C ≥6.2 (end of storage) will be  
summarized , with the corresponding lower bound of a one -sided 95% CI for the proportion 
provided.

Cerus Corporation considers this document to be confidential and not subject to

The INTERCEPT Blood System for P latelets is intended to be used for ex vivo preparation of 
pathogen- reduced apheresis platelet components  (PCs) in ord er to reduce the risk of 
transfusion- transmitted infection (TTI), including sepsis, and as an alternate to gamma 
irradiation for prevention  of transfusion- associated graft -versus -host disease (TA -GVHD).  
The INTERCEPT Blood System  for P latelets is a Class III medical device consisting of plastic 
disposable sets and an illumination device (INTERCEPT Illuminator), which provides a 
controlled dose of ultraviolet A (UVA) light to the PC. The final product is either transfused or stored accor ding to blood center standard operating procedures (SOP), US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), and American Association of Blood Banks ( AABB ) Guidelines.  
The INTERCEPT Blood System  for P latelets was approved by the FDA i n December 2014  for 
treatment of platelets collected in a commercially available platelet additive solution.  In March 2016, the FDA approved the use of the INTERCEPT System  for treatment of platelets 
suspended in 100% plasma.  As part of the approval, Cerus committed to a post -approval study 
to evaluate the recovery and survival of apheresis platelets suspended in 100% plasma and treated with the INTERCEPT Blood System for Platelets . Cerus also received approval for 
INTERCEPT Processing Sets manufactured with alternate p lastics and design changes and the 
INT100G2 Illuminator in May 2018. 
The current maximal expiration dating period for INTERCEPT platelet s in the U.S. is 5 days. 
Prior limitations to storing platelets beyond 5 days have been due to increased risk of bacteri al 
proliferation associated with initial contamination of the platelet components and subsequent 
increased risk of transfusion related sepsis ( Kleinman , et al. 2013). These limitations may be 
resolved by the INTERCEPT pathogen reduction technology to reduc e the risk of transfusion 
related sepsis. Extension of apheresis platelet component expiration dating to 6 or 7 days  after 
collection would increase the availability and reduce the wastage of PCs. The feasibility for 
extension of storage of INTERCEPT platelets for up to 7 days  without increasing the risk of 
bacterial contamination and transfusion- related sepsis is supported by studies demonstrating 
effective inactivation of bacteria generally >4 log
10 with negative cultures at outdate  
(Schmidt  2015, W agner 2016) , in vitro  platelet function stud ies (CLI 00123 and CLI  00124) 
and an in vivo  recovery and survival pilot study ( CLI 00099) of apheresis -derived PCs 
suspended in either 100% plasma or platelet additive solution (35% plasma/ 65%  PAS -3). The 
therapeutic efficacy of INTERCEPT PC s stored for 7 days  is supported by a Phase 3 study 
(Lozano , et al. 2011) and post -marketing experience obtained in several European countries 
where the INTERCEPT Blood System  for Platelets  is licensed for 7 days  of storage. Four 
years of safety data from Switzerland with INTERCEPT plat elets stored up to 7 days  have 
demonstrated no cases of definite transfusion related sepsis (Amsler and Jutzi, Swissmedic Haemovigilance Annual Report 2014). Routine experience in Innsbruck, Aus tria showed no

and no effect in clinical outcomes in massively transfused patients  (Amato 2016, Nussbaumer 
2017) . Cumulatively, this body of evidence warrants the in vivo characterization of recovery 
and survival of INTERCEPT PCs stored for up to 7 days .   
This study will compare the in vivo  post -infusion radiolabeled recovery and survival of 
INTERCEPT platelets (Tes t) suspended in 100% plasma and stored for up to 7 days to fresh 
autologous platelets  (Control)  prepared from platelet rich plasma (PRP) isolated from whole 
blood. The results of this study are intended to support an extended shelf -life claim beyond 5 
days of storage for INTERCEPT platelets suspended in either 100% plasma  or 35% plasma/ 
65% PAS -3 using the currently approved INTERC EPT platelet processing sets (Small 
Volume, SV, Large Volume, LV or Dual Storage, DS).  
Although radiolabeling studies have been performed with stored apheresis platelets in additive 
solutions (Vassallo 2010 and Dumont 2013)  and apheresis platelets in 100% plasma 
(Dumont  2002 and Vassallo 2004), quality control of the platelet samples processed for 
radiolabeling has not been perform ed.  Cerus has evaluated variations  of the Biomedical 
Excellence for Safer Transfusion Collaboration ( BEST)  platelet handling methods prior to 
radiolabeling to optimize  platelet recovery and improve platelet quality (VAL 00376 and 
REL 00556).  These studies have shown that the platelet preparation procedure described in 
the BEST version 4.2.1 protocol may not be optim al for preparing  stored apheresis platelets  
for radiol abeling  (Steps 4.2 and 5.2 of the BEST Platelet Radiolabeling Procedure 
Version  4.2.1, Appendix B ).  The first two step s in preparing stored platelet s amples for 
radiolabeling involve anticoagulation an d acidification of the sample , using ACD- A, and a soft 
spin to separate and remove contaminating RBCs and WBCs  (Table 1 ). The se steps are not 
necessary for stored apheresis platelets since the platelet components are collected in ACD- A 
and have low RBC and WBC contamination due to the apheresis collection proce dures.  
Furthermore, the first two steps of the platelet preparation steps  have been shown to decrease 
physical platelet recovery and negatively impact platelet quality ( described further in 
Section  3.2.1.3) .  The Variant  1 of BEST method (referred to as Variant  1, Appendix C ) does 
not include t he first two steps of the platelet preparation steps  (Table 1 ).

INTERCEPT platelets (Test) prepared for radiolabeling using the procedures outlined by BEST or Variant  1. This comparison will test the hypothesis that optimizing platelet recovery 
and retaining platelet in vitro  quality while preparing samples  from platelet components for 
radiolabeling will influence the outcome of post -infusion recovery.  
3.1 Name and Description of the Investigational Product  
The INTERCEPT Blood System  for P latelets is a medical device (Table 2, Figure 1)  
consisting of a single -use processing set (INTERCEPT Processing Set for platelets) and an 
illumination device (INTERCEPT Illuminator), which provides a controlled dose of ultraviolet A (UVA) light to the platelet component(s). The apheresis -derived platelet component  (PC), 
prepared with the INTERCEPT Blood System  for P latelets , is an investigational biological 
product  in this study ( INTERCEPT p latelet  component ). The radiolabeled Control platelets  are 
also considered investigational.

3.2 Summary of Nonclinical and Clinical Studies  
The nonclinical and clinical studies are s ummarized in the Package Insert 
(SPC  00701- AW v3.0 INTERCEPT Blood System for Platelets – Dual Storage (DS) 
Processing Set). The following paragraphs provide additional background for the proposed 
study. 
3.2.1 In Vivo  Assessments of Stored INTERCEPT Platelets   
Extension of platelet storage for up to 7 days  for INTERCEPT platelets has been explored in 
in vitro  studies ( CLI 00094, CLI  00095, CLI  00123 and CLI  00124) . The results from these 
studies show  that the in vitro  quality of INTERCEPT platelets stored in 65% PAS -3/35% 
plasma or 100% plasma is adequate when compared to untreated platelets and similar to the 
results published for conventional Amicus platelets stored in Inter Sol (Vassallo  2010) and 
Trima platelets in 100% plasma stored for 5 days (Dumont  2013).  
In addition, Cerus has conducted an in vivo  pilot recovery and survival study ( CLI 00099) for 
INTERCEPT PCs suspended in platelet additive solution (35% plasma/65% PAS -3) and 100% 
plasma stored for 7 days  and a  study of recovery and survival of INTERCEPT platelets in 35% 
plasma/65% PAS -3 stored for either 6 or 7 days  (CLI 00116).

Apheresis Platelet Components ( CLI 00099)  
A pilot study ( CLI 00099) assessed the post -infusion recovery and lifespan (also referred to as 
survi val) of 7-day I NTERCEPT PCs stored in either  35% plasma/65% PAS- 3 or 100% 
plasma , as compared to “fresh” radiolabeled platelets. Preliminary results provide d evidence of 
the feasibility for I NTERCEPT platelets to be stored for up to 7 days , while maintaining 
adequate transfusion viability, regardless of the suspension media.  
Mean radiolabel 24 -h recovery ratios (Test/Control [“fresh” autologous platelets]) of 
INTERCEPT apheresis -derived PCs suspended in 35% plasma and 65% PAS- 3 and stored for 
7 days  was 65.3%  and for INTERCEPT platelets in 100% plasma was 70.9 %. Mean lifespan 
ratio (T est/Control ) was 57.5% for I NTERCEPT PCs suspended in 35% plasma and 65% 
PAS-3 and for INTERCEPT PCs in 100% plasma was 61.0% (Table 3 ). Although, the small 
sample sizes and wide standard deviations limit the conclusions that can be deri ved from this 
pilot study, the results suggest 7- day storage  of INTERCEPT platelets  is feasible.

3.2.1.2 Recovery and Lifespan of Radiolabeled Autologous INTERCEPT 6 and 7- day 
Stored Apheresis Platelet Components ( CLI 00116)  
CLI 00116, a random ized, cross -over analysis of platelet recovery and survival after 
autologous transfusion of 6- day and 7- day stored INTERCEPT treated Amicus platelets in 
PAS-3 (Inter Sol), was conducted at both HBC and Dartmouth Hitchcock ( DH). While 
conducting CLI  00099 and CLI 00116 studies, modifications to BEST version 4.2.1 were 
implemented at HBC to improve platelet yield in response to low recovery after processing 
platelet samples for radiolabeling ; whereas, BEST version 4.2.1 was followed at DH  for 
CLI 00116. The modifications implemented at HBC involved combining the pellets from both 
the soft and hard spins due to observations of platelet loss during the soft spin of the platelet 
sample in ACD- A.

Cerus Corporation considers this document to be confidential and not subject to 
disclosure without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  In study CLI  00116, the DH Investigator noted that 4 of 15 recovery assessments for Control 
(fresh) WB platelets demonstrated recoveries of >100% (101.5; 106.8%; 113.1% and 193.5%); 
the results were highly variable and not aligned with historical data (Dumont 2013; Vassallo 2010) (communicatio n from Dr. Dumont dated 4/11/2017). In addition, initial data from HBC 
in CLI  00116 was reported by the Investigator to show diminished performance with respect to 
the in vivo recovery/survival outcomes compared to CLI  00099.  
At DH it was noted also that radioactivity of the standards was  not sufficiently high above 
background radioactivity to provide reliable measurement of  specific activity. This problem 
may have been responsible for the unusual results showing radioactivity recoveries of > 100% in 4 subjects . A modification in the preparation of the standard samples for gamma counting 
was instituted  in CLI  00116 by using decreas ed dilution before counting. This resulted in a 50 
to 100- fold increase in the corrected radioactivity counts for the standards above background 
and provided good precision . These DH studies demonstrated the need to implement controls 
to ensure adequate signal -to-noise ratios when measuring the radioactivity associated with the 
standards  as described in this protocol .  
CLI 00116 was terminated for futility  caused by poor platelet recovery yields after 
radiolabeling.  
3.2.1.3 Method optimization of preparation of stored platelets for radiolabeling 
A small investigational study was performed to assess the radiolabeling methodologi es used at 
HBC during CLI  00116.  The results of this study indicated that the addition of acidic 
(pH 4.5 -  5.5), undiluted ACD- A to stored apheresis platelets before the first soft spin per the 
BEST protocol (designed to remove residual RBC and WBC from P RP derived from fresh 
blood) resulted in poor platelet recovery yield and inferior in vitro  platelet quality of the 
aliquots compared with platelets resuspended in diluted, pH adjusted (pH 6.5- 6.8) 
ACD- A/saline. Together with the recovery and survival results from CLI  00099, these data 
indicated that injury may be induced by the addition of a high [H+] -containing solution 
(ACD- A) when added to stored apheresis PCs.  
Based on the investigational study results, a prospective in vitro  study (VAL 00376) was  
designed and completed to assess two alternative platelet preparation methods based on the BEST version 4.2.1 protocol for preparation of stored platelet samples for radiolabeling using 
both untreated and INTERCEPT platelets in 100% plasma, collected on the Trima platform and stored for 5 days.  The results of t his study showed that platelet aliquots processed with 
variations of the BEST protocol  for preparing platelet samples prior to radiolabeling [ Variant  1 
(hard spin only) or Variant 2 (addition of buffered ACD- A/saline instead of ACD- A and 
recombining slow and fast spin pellets )] led to improved in vitro  platelet pH levels, yield 
recovery and quality, when compared to the samples processed with the original

modi fications exhibited similar in vitro  characteristics, but slightly differed with respect to 
platelet yield recovery (proportion), platelet lysis, platelet activation and metabolism.  
Cumulatively , the study results supported the use of either variant method as an improved 
platelet sample prep aration method for stored apheresis platelets compared to the original 
BEST version 4.2.1 method.  Variant  1 was selected for further study as the use of a soft spin 
and recombining of pellets in Variant 2 wa s considered redundant.  
Following the completion of VAL 00376, and based  on FDA concerns that the Variant  1 
procedure  would result in higher RBC and WBC contamination and therefore might provide 
misleading results for platelet recovery and survival , Cerus conducted another study to 
characterize the RBC and WBC contamination level of samples prepared using either the 
BEST or Variant  1 methods  (REL 00556) . 
Data from REL 00556, provided i n Table 4 , confirm that when the BEST protocol is 
performed on INTERCEPT platelet s, stored for 7 days, the in vitro  recovery of platelets is 
reduced by ~29.4% (BEST 2391 ±381: Variant  1 3389 ±378), rais ing the possibility that 
radiolabeling would be biased by the labeling of a selected subset of platelets when using the 
BEST protocol. Although t he manual and flow cytometry- based RBC counts showed that 
apheresis platelet samples prepared with the Variant  1 procedure have higher RBC and WBC 
contamination tha n the BEST protocol , the levels are well  below levels considered to be 
material to the outcome of radiolabeling studies.  B oth the BEST and Variant  1 protocols 
result ed in < 1:10,000 contamination of the platelet preparations with either RBC or WBC by 
cell count and <1:1,000 by cell volume (assuming that the Mean Platelet Volume wa s 10% of 
the volume of an RBC or lymphocyte).

The labeling efficiency using Chromium -51 has been reported to be 10- fold lower for platelets 
compared to RBCs, 9% versus 90% (Baldini 1960), whereas Indium -111 will preferentially 
label platelets compared to RBCs or WBCs (Mountford 1985).  Even with the differences in 
labeling efficiency for Chromium -51 (which would represent half of the samples collected for 
INTERCEPT stored platelets, as the radiolabeling is randomized between Test and Control for Chromium -51 and Indium -111). Cerus data for RBC contamina tion levels suggest s that the 
contribution of the RBC levels between stored apheresis platelets processed with the BEST or Variant  1 protocols represents a scientifically insignificant difference  (<1% of Chromium -51 
labeling) . 
Furthermore , the BEST protocol includes one final sample on Day 10, 11, or 12. The last 
sample is called the “baseline” sample and is used to correct for inadvertent labeling of other 
blood components (BEST 2005). The rationale  for this sample  is that contaminating RBC s 
have a longer in vivo lifespan than platelets and that any radioactivity rema ining in the 
circulation after D ay 10 must be from contaminating RBC s in the sample preparation or from 
in vivo elution for the radiolabel from platelets and labelling of other blood components .

Cerus Corporation considers this document to be confidential and not subject to

0.0008% or 0.0035% of the cellular content in the sample, using the BEST or Variant  1 
procedures, respectively and therefore is not scientifically relevant as a source of contamination. In comparison, the RBC contamination of the fresh WB  derived  platelets is 
approximately 0.0085% of the cellular content and the WBC contamination is 0.0035% of the cellular content  for WB  derived  platelets (versus 0.000000044% for stored, INTERCEPT 
apheresis platelets).  
CLI 00127 will evaluate both Variant  1 and the BEST procedure, which is the current standard 
for preparing stored platelet samples for  recovery and survival studies . RBC contamina tion 
will also be assessed using a Ficoll gradient technique as a secondary confirmation of RBC contamination levels.  
3.3 Summary of Potential Risks and Benefits  
3.3.1 Benefits of Study Participation  
There are no direct benefits to the subjects in this study. 
3.3.2 Risks of Study Participation  
A summary  of the safety experience with INTERCEPT platelets is provided in the Package 
Insert  (SPC 00701- AW v3.0 INTERCEPT Blood System for Platelets – Dual Storage (DS) 
Processing Set ). The cumulative experience suggests no excess treatment -related morbidity 
associated with the transfusion of INTERCEPT PCs  compared to conventional PCs . With the 
limited exposure to autologous platelets in the study proposed herein ( approximately 10 to 
30 mL  infusion), systemic risks are considered unlikely. 
3.3.2.1 Risk of Receiving an Incorrectly Labeled Platelet Component  
PCs will be prepared, labeled, and tracked using site SOPs to ensure that appropriate 
identification of study components is maintained at all times. Verification of each subject’s 
platelet component will occur prior to infusion as an additional check on component identity.

Cerus Corporation considers this document to be confidential and not subject to 
disclosure without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  3.3.2.2 Risk of Transfusion -Transmitted Infectious Disease  
The risk of transfusion- transmitted infections (TTI) is considered minim al for study subjects 
who will receive approximately 10 to 30 mL  of washed radiolabeled autologous Test and 
Control platelets. All standard viral pathogen testing performed routinely by the Blood Centers 
will be performed. Since subjects will be receiving autologous platelets that have been 
screened for TTIs , the risk of infection transmission is minimal.  All Test PC s will be treated 
with the INTERCEPT system which  has demonstrated high levels of bacterial inactivation 
efficacy through 5 days  and 7 days  of storage ( Wagner , et al . 2015)  and four years safe 
experience with 7  day stored INTERCEPT PC in Switzerland. Bacterial contamination is 
possible during radiolabeling due to required use of an open system. However, only a small 
aliquot of labeled platelet s will be re -infused shortly after labeling, thus the risk of bacterial 
proliferation due to contamination during the radiolabeling procedure is minimized. Based on laboratory studies demonstrating inactivation of viruses and bacteria, the infectious disea se 
risk to recipients of Test platelets is  reduced compared with that of conventional platelet  
component s.  
3.3.2.3 Risk of Transfusion Reaction  
Transfusion reactions known to occur following transfusion of conventional platelets may occur following infusion of st udy platelets (e.g., fever, chills, itching, rash, hives, 
bronchospasm, nausea/vomiting, hypertension/hypotension, TRALI, TACO, and anaphylaxis). 
The risk of experiencing a transfusion reaction is considered minimal from the small 
autologous infusions used in this study ( approximately 10- 30 mL ).  
3.3.2.4 Risk of Apheresis Collection  
Risks associated with the apheresis collection  of platelets include: blood pressure changes, a 
temporary decrease in platelets, a small loss of white blood cells, problems with vein acc ess 
(including pain, bleeding, and infection at the catheter site), effects of the anticoagulant on the 
donor's calcium level (including paresthesias from citrate -induced hypocalcemia), and allergic 
reactions to the anticoagulant or other products used, which may be life -threatening .  On very 
rare occasions, risks associated with the apheresis collection include nerve damage, serious 
problems and death. Allergic reaction due to iodine allergy is possible if an iodine solution is 
used to cleanse the phleboto my site to meet standards in 21 CFR 640.4(f). Blood pressure 
changes can sometimes cause nausea, fatigue, and dizziness. Platelet loss may increase the risk of bleeding from cuts or wounds.  Venous access problems can cause bruising referred to as a 
hematoma. While donating, a supply of calcium antacid tablets is usually kept close by to 
replenish the calcium lost. Because the anticoagulant works by binding to the calcium in the blood, a donor 's levels of calcium -  and especially of active calcium ions -  decrease during the 
donation process. The lips may begin to tingle or there may be a metallic taste; since calcium

susceptible, at least during the donation process. Unusually low calcium can cause more 
serious problems such as fainting, nerve irritation and short -duration tetany. Such an acute 
hypocalcemia is usually due to low calcium levels prior to donation, aggravated by the 
anticoagulant. Hypocalcemia can be curtailed by modestly increasing dietary calcium intake in 
the days prior to donation. Nerve damage which is more rarely observed may result in numbness, pain or paralysis.  Serious problems are extremely rare and may include heart attack and stroke. The apheresis procedure can also result in a need for extended medical treatment 
and can be fatal.  A pheresis donors are routinely monitored during the long donation process.  
3.3.2.5 Risk Related to Whole Blood Collection  
Use of experienced phlebotomists will reduce the likelihood of these types of injuries. Blood 
collection may be associated with hematoma formation, local irritation , or infection. Local 
care can be given to prevent hematoma formation, accordi ng to standard medical practice.  
3.3.2.6 Risk Related to Infusion Procedure  
The infusion procedure  may be associated with hematoma formation, local irritation , or 
infection. Local care can be given to prevent hematoma formation, according to standard medical pract ice. 
3.3.2.7 Risk Related to Radiation Exposure  
111Indium  Oxine (111In) and Na 251CrO 4 (51Cr) are routinely used for radiolabeling and infusion 
of fresh or stored platelets in humans. The amount of radiation that the subjects will receive in 
each study infusion is estimated to be up to approximately 60 m rem, below the annual 
maximum limits typically considered to be safe.  
No known risks are associated with 51Cr administration at the level of chromium exposure 
used in this study. Allergic dermatological reactions have been reported in association with 
111In.

The principle  objective of this study is to evaluate the hypothesis that INTERCEPT Platelets in 
100% plasma stored for 5 or more days (up to 7 days ) after apheresis collection retain 
sufficient viability for therapeutic transfusion efficacy. The post -infusion recovery and 
survival  of radiolabeled 7- day INTERCEPT platelet s (Test)  stored in 100 % plasma will be 
measured  in comparison to their “fresh” radiolabeled platelet  (Control ) according to FDA 
guidance for platelet testing (FDA 1999)  in Stage 2 of this study protocol .  
A secondary objective is to compare the recovery and survival results for Test platelets

protocol . This comparison will evaluate the hypothesis that preparation methods prior to 
radiolabeling may influence in vitro  quality of the radiolabeled platelets and post -infusion 
viability outcomes.   In addition, in vitro  function will also be evaluated for the stored Test 
INTERCEPT platelets .

5.1 Overall Trial D esign and P lan 
The study population will consist of healthy subjects who meet the FDA, AABB, and site -
specific research donor eligibility criteria for an apheresis platelet collection .   
In each stage, apheresis platelets (single or double) will be collected in 100% plasma on the 
Trima Accel® Automated Blood Collection  system .  Each study apheresis collection will be 
processed using the INTERCEPT Blood System for P latelets ; apheresis platelets containing a 
platelet dose of 3.0 to 7.9 x1011 platelets in 300 to 420 mL  of plasma will be processed using 
the INTERCEPT Dual Storage (DS) processing set. The INTERCEPT process will begin on either the day of collection (Day 0) or the day following collection (Day 1); illumination must occur within 24 hours after the end of coll ection. Test platelet components will be stored for 
up to 7 days , after collection , in 100% plasma. In vitro  platelet function will be evaluated on 
Days 0/1 (pre -treatment) and at end of storage ( Day 7) for both stages  (Table 11).   
At the end of storage, duplicate  aliquot s of Test platelets will be aseptically removed from 
each subject’s INTERCEPT platelet storage container and prepared , in tandem, for 
radiolabeling using either BEST version 4.2.1 method (Stage 1) or Variant  1 modification  
(Stages 1 and 2) .  One of the Test  platelet sample aliquots will be used to assess the in vitro  
quality prior to and following the pre -radiolabeling platelet sample preparations. The i ndices to 
be measured in Stage 1 are volume, pH
22°C, CD62P, platelet count, RBC count , and WBC 
count  (Table 10).  Assessments of these indices will enable the determination of platelet 
processing recovery due to each sample preparation method and evaluation of residual  RBC 
and WBC contamination in samples prior to radiolabeling. In Stage 2 , only platelet processing  
recovery (calculated from volume and platelet count) and pH 22°C measured following the pre -
radiolabeling platelet sample preparatio ns. The second Test platelet sample aliquot will be 
used for radiolabeling.  
The study will be performed in two stages ( Table 5 ). Stage 1 is a randomized, 2- period 
crossover design. Test platelets stored for 7 days will be radiolabeled using either the BEST or 
Variant  1 methods (depending on the period and randomization scheme for the Test platelets ) 
for 12 healthy subjects  (6 subjects from each site) . The recovery and survival for Test platelets 
prepared with the BEST and Variant 1 methods will be compared with each other and against 
the fresh platelet Control. Stage 2 is a single arm study in which all Test platelets will be 
prepared for radiolabeling using the Variant  1 methodology. The recovery and survival for 
Test platelets will be compared against the fresh platelet Control. Recovery and survival of 
INTERCEPT platelets will be assessed after 7  days  of storage for 24 evaluable subjects  (target 
12 subjects with a minimum of 8  at a single  site) .

which have completed the period.  
b  Stage 1 subjects with evaluable Variant 1 method data will contribute to the requirement of the 24 subjects for Stage 2.  
 
On the day corresponding to the end of storage for the Test component, healthy subjects will 
return to the site, and 43 (±2) mL  of whole blood (WB) will be drawn into a syringe containing 
9 mL  of Anticoagulant Citrate Dextrose Solution, Formula A ( ACD- A). The sample will be 
used to prepare fres h Control platelets from platelet rich plasma following the BEST 
methodology.  In addition, a blood sample in EDTA will be drawn for use in determination of radiolabel elution.  
Test and Control will be randomly radiolabeled with either 
51Cr as sodium radiochromate 
(Na 251CrO 4) or 111In as indium oxine, depending upon randomization period and assignment. 
Subjects will be randomized with equal probability to the radiolabeling sequences  
(111In/51Cr vs. 51Cr/111In) for Test/Control. After radiolabeling, the aut ologous Control and Test 
platelet samples will be simultaneously infused  into the subject .  
Blood samples will be drawn immediately before infusion and for radioactivity measurements 
at 1 hour ± 15 min and 2 hours ± 15 min post -infusion (Day 0), and 6 more samples will be 
drawn at 1, 2, 3, 4 (or 5 or 6), 7 ( or 8), and 11±1 days post -infusion (DPI), at approximately 
the same time of day as the radiolabeled platelet infusion was  administered (±4 hours) .

Cerus Corporation considers this document to be confidential and not subject to 
disclosure without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  For su bjects enrolled in  the S tage 1 cross over study, there will be a minimum washout period 
of four  weeks between the two study periods (e.g., four weeks after the last blood sample at 
11±1 DPI  in period 1). Subjects will be monitored for safety (adverse event s) from the first 
apheresis procedure until 24 hours after the last DPI blood sample is drawn.  
Stage 1 is a randomized, 2- period crossover design. Test platelets stored for 7 days  will be 
prepared for radiolabeling using either the BEST or Variant  1 metho ds (depending on the 
period and randomization scheme for the stored apheresis platelets) for up to 12 healthy 
subjects. T he post -infusion recovery for Test platelets prepared with the BEST and Variant  1 
methods will be compared with each other and against the fresh platelet Control. Stage 1 will 
have up to 12 completed pairs. 
Stage 2 is a single arm study in which all Test platelets will be prepared for radiolabeling using 
the Variant  1 method.  Recovery  and survival of Test platelets will be assessed after  7 days of 
storage for 24 evaluable subjects ; Stage 1 Variant 1 data, will be applied to Stage 2 to achieve 
24 evaluable pairs based on FDA feedback  (BQ200481) .  The goal of this stage is to complete 
the qualification of Test platelets collected on the T rima separator and stored for 7 days in 
100% plasma using the Variant 1  procedure.  
The duration of the study for each Stage 1  subject will be 17- 19 days  following apheresis per 
period with an initial screening window of up to 15 days , or a total duration of approximately 
77 to 81 day s. For subjects enrolled i n Stage 2 the duration is approximately 32 to 34 days .  
5.2 Randomization and B linding  
Cerus will gener ate the randomization scheme separately for each study stage to be executed 
by the  blood center s. In this study, eligible  subjects who are enrolled in S tage 1 will be 
randomized in 1:1 ratio to one of the two platelet pr eparation  procedure sequences  for Test 
platelets  (BEST/ Variant  1 or Variant  1 /BEST).  Subjects will also be randomized across 
radiolabeling sequences  (111In/51Cr or 51Cr/111In for Test /Control ) for both Stage 1 and Stage 2. 
In addition, an equal number of subjects will be targeted at each study site for both Stage 1 (6 
subjects per  site)  and Stage 2  (12 subjects with a minimum of 8 at a single site ). Subjects will 
receive both Test and Control platelets at the same time.   To reduce the potential confounding 
effect from radiolabel  for the BEST vs. Variant 1 comparison in Stage 1 , the same randomized 
radiolabeling sequence (either 51Cr or 111In for Test platelets) will be utilized throughout both 
donation periods for a given subject as applicable. Randomized subjects who do not have both paired (Test and Control) recovery and paired survival data for a given stage or who are unable to provide a second matched donation for a cross -over stage will be replaced, unless the 
enrollment goal is me t.

5.3 Treatment and Dose 
5.3.1 Administration of Study Product  
The study platelets ( approximately 10 to 30 mL  of washed radiolabeled fresh  [Control]  and 7-
day st ored autologous radiolabeled platelets  [Test] ) are administered by intravenous in fusion 
in a peripheral vein  using a  butterfly infusion needle. 
5.3.2 Preparation of the Study  Test Platelet Component  
5.3.2.1 Apheresis Platelet Collection  
Study subjects who qualify to participate in either  stage of the study will provide one single or 
double apheresis platelet collection ( Stage 2 ) or two single or double apheresis platelet 
collections ( Stage 1) as specified in Section 5.3.6.2.  All study apheresis donations will be 
collected in 100% plasma on the Trima Accel® automated blood collection system according 
to blood center SOPs and the manufacturer’s instructions, with leukocyte reduction by 
centrifugation as part of the collection process and with anticoagulant ACD, using FDA approved collection sets (Trima produc t code: 80400 or 80440). A small sample may be 
acquired to obtain the subject’s platelet count.  
The subject’s platelet count and body mass prior to the first donation will determine if a single or double -dose collection will be performed. For S tage 1 each  subject will provide the same 
type of apheresis collection for both study apheresis platelet collections. If a subject is unable to provide a second evaluable donation (two attempts , at least two  week s apart,  to obtain a 
second donation can be made  if the  subject meets the eligibility requirements for donation ), the 
study subject will be replaced.  
After collection, the platelet components will be handled following the manufacturer’s instructions which include static rest followed by continuous agitation a t 20°C to 24°C. 
Platelets will have an RBC content <4x10
6/mL and should be free of visible  aggregates prior 
to INTERCEPT treatment . Platelet components with an RBC content >4x106/mL will be 
excluded from the study. 
At several different steps in the preparation  of the Test component , the component  volume will 
be measured by weight. The tare weight for each of the different platelet containers (empty dry 
container with standardized tube length) will be used to determine the net product weight. Tare weights will be reported.

• [Gross weight (g) of the component – tare weight of the container (g)] ÷ specific 
gravity of platelets]  
• The specific gravity of platelets used for calculations for this protocol will be:  
• 100% plasma: 1.03 g/mL Apheresis Platelets  
5.3.2.2 Preparation of Test Platelets  
Platelet input components will be sampled and evaluated for parameters described i n 
Table  11.  
Treatment with INTERCEPT ( Figure 2 ) will begin within 24 hours of  collection . The 
processing steps described in SPC 00701- AW v3.0, (INTERCEPT Blood System for 
Platelets -Dual Storage (DS ) Processing Set ) will be followed, unless  superseded by 
instructions presented in this protocol  (i.e. sampling of components and extended storage 
durations) . 
Each Test input component will contain 3.0 to 5.2×1011 platelets in 300 -390 mL in 100%  
plasma (single  collection) or 5.3 to 7.9×1011 platelets in 375- 420 mL  in 100%  plasma ( single 
or double collection) . If the input platelet component volume is greater than 420 mL , the 
volume will be adjusted to 300 to 420 mL  by sterile connecti on to an empty container and 
removing the excess volume, which will be discarded.   The Test input platelet dose and 
volume should be comparable for both treatment periods  of Stage 1 .   
Each Test input component will be connected to the tubing of the INT25 Dual  Processing Set 
using a sterile connect ion device (SCD). The final storage containers of the INTERCEPT set 
will be labeled “Test -A” for single collections and  randomly labeled “Test -A” and  “Test -B” 
for collections with input doses ≥ 5.3×1011 platelets/unit.  
Amotosalen will be added to the component by passing the entire contents of the Test input 
component through the amotosalen container and into the illumination container. After the 
component is mixed and air has been returned to the input container , the tubing connecting the 
amotosalen container  to the illumination container will be sealed and the amotosalen container 
and the original platelet container will be detached.  
Test in -process platelet components will then be illuminated with a target dose of 3.9 J/cm2 
UVA treatment on the INT ERCEPT Il luminator. A treatment report will be printed and 
attached to the processing batch production record.   Following illumination, Test in-process platelets will be transferred to the container with the 
CAD, the illumination container will be detached, and the platelets will be placed in an

time the platelets are transferred to the container with the CAD and the time the CAD is placed 
into agitated stor age will be recorded.  
The duration of agitated storage with  the CAD will be 12 to 24 hours. The time when the 
container with the CAD is removed from agitated storage will be recorded. For cross -over 
stages the CAD duration for the second period should be within 2 hours of the first period.  The container with the CAD will be hung and platelets will be transferred by gravity into 1 or 
2 storage containers and  any air returned to the empty container with the CAD. The 
INTERCEPT storage containers and connected tubing will be weighed; the net weight will be used to determine the total post INTERCEPT volume. This volume will be used for determination of platelet dose and volume recoveries. For  input platelet dose greater than 
5.3×10
11, the platelet volume will b e divided as evenly as possible (by weight) to make 2 equal 
INTERCEPT platelet (Test) components, randomly designated “Test -A” and “Test -B” that 
will remain connected during storage or will be stored in two separate containers f or input 
platelet dose great er than 7.1×1011 according to the Instructions for Use . The empty container 
with the CAD will be detached and discarded  using a  heat seal technique to preserve sterility . 
The individual INTERCEPT storage containers will be weighed for calculation of post -
treatment volume  and the post INTERCEPT sample will be removed as described in 
Section  5.3.2.1 for assessment of the indices describ ed in  Table 11.  
All INTERCEPT platelets (Test)  will be stored under standard conditions of continuous 
agitation using licensed platelet agitator  and temperature control (20 °C to 24°C) until the time 
of radiolabeling on Day 7  post - collection .

On the day of scheduled radiolabeling and infusion (Day 7 post -apheresis), samples will be 
aseptically removed from the component for radiolabeling and in vitro  platelet function 
testing.  The Test platelets are prepared for radiolabeling using either the BEST version 4.2.1 
method (Stage 1; Appendix B ) or the V ariant 1 method (Stage 1 and Stage 2; Appendix C ). 
The Test platelet sample will be evaluated prior to and post preparation for radiolabeling (Table 10).  
5.3.2.5 Preparation of Control Platelets  – Fresh Platelets  
On the scheduled day of radiolabeling/infusion approximately 43 (±2) mL  of whole blood is 
collected from the subject  in a syringe containing ACD- A to prepare the Control platelets  
(fresh platelets) . The fresh platelets are separated from the whole blood by centrifugation to 
prepare platelet rich plasma.  The Control platelets will be  labeled with the alternate 
radionuclide to the one used for the paired Test platelets. The Control platelets are radiolabeled according to the BEST version  4.2.1 method ( Appendix B ).  
5.3.2.6 Platelet I nfusion 
The study platelets (approximately 10 to 30 mL  of washed radiolabeled fresh [Control] and 7-
day stored, washed, radiolabeled autologous platelets [Test]) are administered by intravenous infusion in a peri pheral vein using a 19 -gauge  butterfly infusion needle.  
5.3.3 Duration of Subject Participation  
Within 15 days prior to participating in either  study stage , subjects will be screened for

specified in the Schedule of Assessments (see Table 7 ) and Study Schem a (Table 6 ) for each 
stage of the study.  
 Platelet Apheresis Collection and S torage
5.3.6.1 Day 0:  Prior to Apheresis C ollection  
Prior to apheresis collection  in any study stage/period, the donor weight and vital signs will be 
recorded. A blood sample  (approximately 13 mL)  for hematology (including platelet count) 
and chemistry panels (see list of specific parameters in  Table 9 ) will be taken ; hematology and 
chemistry p anels do not need to be repeated if screening assessments were performed within 
7 days  prior to apheresis.  Subjects will be asked about concomitant medications , nicotine  
and/or cannabis  use, and updates to baseline medical history . 
5.3.6.2 Day 0:  Apheresis C ollection  
Study subjects who qualify to participate in any study stage  will provide one  or two  single or 
double apheresis platelet collections (depending upon whether it is a crossover stage)  as 
described in Section 5.3.2.1. 
Subjects will be asked about AE s (serious or non- serious) that may have taken place during or 
following the collection,  and these will be recorded . 
5.3.6.3 Day 0- 1: Post  Apheresis Collection Input  Sample  
A sample (approximately 10- 20 mL ) will be aseptically removed  from the component  for 
in vitro  platelet assessments ( Table 11).  
5.3.6.4 Day 0-1: Platelet  Pathogen Reduction  with the INTERCEPT Blood System   
INTERCEPT treatment  (Figure 2 ) will begin with in 24 hours of collection (Day 0) following 
the steps outlined in Section 5.3.2.2. The INTERCEPT platelet s will be weighed for 
calculation of post -treatment volume.   
Following the INTERCEPT treat ment process , the individual INTERCEPT storage containers 
will be weighed for calculation of post -treatment volume. A post INTE RCEPT sample will be 
removed using the integrated sample bulb ( on the  “Test -A” container and approximately 3 mL  
of platelet component will be withdrawn to measure the post -INTER CEPT platelet coun t.  The 
volume, dose and platelet yield retention will be calculated ( Table 11).

Cerus Corporation considers this document to be confidential and not subject to disclosure 
without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  5.3.7 Bacterial Testing  
A sample  (approximately 8 to 20 mL)  of the Test  platelets will be withdrawn 1, 2 or 3 days 
prior to the end of storage for bacterial contamination screening. Testing for bacterial 
contamination will utilize an approved system for aerobic culture of potential viable bacteria. Bacterial detection testing is not considered a licensure  requirement for INTERCEPT platelet 
components treated within the first 24 hours after collection based on studies that have demonstrated effective inactivation of bacteria through 7 days  of storage. INTERCEPT 
technology is appr oved to replace current bacterial detection methods. However, bacterial 
detection will be used in this study because the study subjects are healthy volunteers who will 
derive no benefit from platelet rein fusion. Bacterial detection testing will provide an extra 
measure of safety for these volunteer subjects. In addition, in the event that any subject 
experiences a post transfusion febrile reaction, the bacterial detection samples will be useful to evaluate the cause of the febrile reaction.  
5.3.8 Plate let Storage : Stage  1 Days 1- 7; Stage  2 Days 1 -7 
All INTERCEPT platelet s will be stored under standard conditions of continuous  agitation  
with approved devices  and temperature control (2 0°C to 24°C) until the end of  Day 7  post - 
collection  for each stage.  
5.3.9 Platelet Radiolabeling and Infusion, Day 7 (0 DPI ) 
5.3.9.1 Subject Procedures Prior to Infusion  
On the scheduled infusion day ( 0 DPI or D ay 7 of component storage ), subject s will return to 
the laboratory. Subject’s  weight and vital signs , urine  or blood pregnancy test  (if applicable 
subject is female ), and a  blood sample  (approximately 13 mL)  for hematology and chemistry 
panels (see list of specific parameters in  Table 9 ) will be taken. Subjects will be asked about 
concomitant medications , nicotine  and/or cannabis use  and AE s (serious or non- serious) that 
may have taken place.   
5.3.9.2 Collection of F resh P latelets (Control)  
On the day of scheduled infusion, 43 (±2) mL  of the subject’s blood will be drawn into a 
syringe containing 9 mL  of ACD- A for preparation of the Control PRP platelets . In addition, 
approximately 10 mL  of the subject’s blood will be collected in an EDTA tube  to determine 
the elution for each radiolabel using the BEST version 4.2.1 method ( Appendix B ).  
Fresh platelets wi ll be prepared from the 43 (±2) mL sample according to the following 
procedure: Collect 43 ( ±2) mL of w hole blood into a syringe containing 9 mL of ACD -A and

of whole blood can be collected with 7 mL of ACD -A followed by a 1- 2 h holding period) .   
The tubes will be centrifuged at 200 ×  g for 15 minutes  to prepare platelet -rich plasma (PRP), 
and the PRP from each tube will be transferred to another conical tube. ACD -A equal to 15% 
of the PRP volume will be added. Prior to radiolabeling the Control platelet sample will be 
evaluated as described in  Section 8.2.1. 
5.3.9.3 Release criteria  of Test platelets  
At the end of storage (Day 7), prior to radiolabeling, Test platelet sample  must fulfill the 
release criteria, as detailed in  Table 8 . Test components  that do not fulfill the release criteria, 
will not be radiolabeled or transfused and hence will not be included in the primary efficacy analysis for the platelet recovery and survival.

5.3.9.4 Preparation of Test Platelets for radiolabeling – Test  Platelets Stored for 7  Days  
On the day of scheduled radiolabeling and infusion (Day 7 post -apheresis), two matched 
samples of 10- 30 mL will be aseptically removed from the “Test -A” container  for 
radiolabeling.  For Test platelets stored in one container, the sample for radiolabeling will be 
removed before the unit is sampled for in vitro  platelet function testing. The final storage 
containers will be weighed to determine platelet component volume after sampling. 
The Test platelets are prepared for radiolabel ing using either the BEST version 4.2.1 method 
(Stage 1; Appendix B ) or the Variant 1 method (Stage 1 and Stage 2;  Appendix C ) and 
protocol specific modifications listed in  Table 15 and Table 16, respectively .  Prior to 
processing and immediately before  radiolabeling  the Test platelet samples will be evaluated as 
described in Section 8.2.1. 
Percentage process recovery  prior to the radiolabeling procedure  will be calculated from the 
pre and post processing platelet counts and sample volumes for Test platelets.

Previously stored Test  platelets and fr esh PRP  Control  platelets will b e radiolabeled according 
to randomization assignment for that subject with either 51Cr as sodium radiochromate 
(Na 251CrO 4), or 111In as indium oxine, following the labeling and washing procedures outlined 
in the BEST version 4.2.1 procedure  (Appendix B ) or the Variant 1 procedure ( Appendix C ), 
dependent upon Stage and where applicable, randomization. The isotope labels will be 
determined by a random number table such that equal numbers of fresh platelets  (Control)  and 
stored Test  platelets  will be labeled with each isotope.  
For both Control and Test platelets, a fter resuspension in a small volume  of ACD- A/saline , 
either 50 –100 μCi 51Cr or  50–60 μCi of 111In is added to the  platelets and incubated for 20 +2 
minutes  at room temperature to achieve radioactive labeling. The platelets are washed to 
remove excess radioactivity and then resuspended in autologous platelet -poor plasma.  
5.3.9.5.1 Radiolabeling E fficiency 
Efficiency of labeling will be measured for each radioactive isotope according to the BEST version 4.2.1 procedure ( Appendix B ) or Variant 1 procedure ( Appendix C ), as 
applicable.   
5.3.9.5.2 Elution of Radioactivity from Labeled Platelets  
Radiolabel spontaneously dissociate s (elut ion) from platelets both in vitro  and in vivo  
(Holme , et al. 1993, Snyder , et al.  2004). To correct for elution before  calculation of recovery 
and survival , the mean elution of radioisotope into the plasma after radiolabeling will be 
measured  in vitro  and modeled using an assay to estimate in vivo  elution  using the BEST 
elution assessment method  (BEST version 4.2.1 m ethod, Appendix B ). 
5.3.9.6 Stored Test Platelet In Vitro Function Testing  
An aliquot (10- 20 mL ) of the stored Test  platelets will be aseptically removed from the  
subject ’s test container  on the scheduled day of infusion; pH and in vitro  platelet function 
assessments will be performed  (Table 11).   
For Test components stored in one container, remove the sample for radiolabeling before the 
unit is sampled for in vitro  platelet function testing. For platelets stored in two containers, t he 
samples  for pH assessment and for radiolabeling will be removed from “Test -A” container and 
sample  for the in vitro  platelet function testing will be removed from the “Test- B” container.

7.1 Treatments  
In each study stage, and in each study period of Stage 1 , each subject will provide one 
apheresis platelet compone nt and receive one infusion of autologous radiolabeled fresh 
Control platelets  combined with Test platelets stored for 7 days  (approximately 10- 30 mL ). 
Platelets are administered by intravenous infusion in a peripheral vein  via a 19- gauge  butterfly 
infusion needle.  
Procedures will be as follows: On Day 0 of each study period, each healthy volunteer subject 
provides a single or double apheresis platelet  collection .  
On Day 7 (0 DPI ), subjects  will return to the laboratory, and 43(±2) mL  of blood will be drawn 
into a syringe containing 9 mL  of ACD- A, USP (2.13% free citrate ion)  (alternatively, 43 mL 
of WB  can be collected with 7  mL of ACD -A follo wed by a 1- 2 h holding period)  and held for 
30 minutes .  Fresh platelets will be prepared from this sample  for radiolabeling according to 
the BEST method. Two  matched aliquot s (10-30 mL) of the stored autologous Test  platelets  
will be aseptically removed from each subject ’s platelet storage container  and prepared for 
radiolabeling according to either the BEST  (Stage 1)  or the Variant 1 (Stage 1 and Stage 2) 
method, depending upon randomization, where applicable, and study stage . Previously stored 
(Test) and fresh platelets ( Control ) will be radiolabeled with either 51Cr as sodium 
radiochromate (Na 251CrO 4), or 111In as indium oxine, depending upon randomization order, 
following the labeling and washing procedures outlined in Appendix B  (BEST method) or 
Appendix C  (Variant 1) . The isotope labels will be determined by a rando m number table 
such that equal numbers of fresh platelets and stored INTERCEPT platelets will be labeled 
with each isotope. Aliquots of the fresh Control  will be radiolabeled with the BEST method 
and stored Test  platelets will be radiolabeled in tubes with  the BEST method  (Stage 1)  or the 
Variant 1  (Stage 1 and Stage 2)  method, depending upon stage, and where applicable , method 
randomization. After radiolabeling, the autologous fresh and stored platelets will be simultaneously infused into the subject (appr oximately 10- 30 mL ). The pregnancy test for 
females is  required  to be negative before infusion in each period. 
Subject b lood  samples for radioactivity measurements will be drawn during each period  as 
follows: pre -infusion,1 ± 15 min and 2 hours post -infusion, and on Days 1, 2, 3, 4 ( or 5 or 6), 7 
(or 8), and 11 ±  1 DPI  (see schedule in  Table 6  and Section 5.3.12.7 Blood Sampling ).

Subjects will visit the st udy site on Day 0 to have single or double apheresis platelets  
collected. On day of scheduled infusion, subjects will return to the study site , and blood 
samples will be drawn to prepare a fresh platelet sample (Control) and to test for radiolabel 
elution . Fresh and stored  INTERCEPT platelets will be radiolabeled and infused to the 
subject s (autologous infusion). Subjects will have to stay in or return to the study site or 
facility where blood is being drawn unt il the 2 hours  ± 15 min post -infusion blood sample is 
drawn. Thereafter, subjects will visit the study site on 1, 2, 3, 4 ( or 5 or 6), 7  (or 8), and 11 ± 1 
DPI (within 4 hours of the initial infusion time) .  
Subjects will be instructed to abstain from t reatment with aspirin or aspirin -containing 
medications within 7 days  of apheresis  or treatment with non -steroidal anti- inflammatory 
drugs (NSAID), anti -platelet agents or other drugs affecting platelet viability within 3  days of 
apheresis  (e.g., ibuprofen or other NSAIDs) . 
Subjects will not engage in any strenuous activity while confined to the research unit and will follow the rules governing their activities, as set forth by the unit.  
7.2 Concomitant and Excluded Therapy  
Conc omitant medications ( including drugs of abuse ) will be recorded during study 
participation. Subjects taking medications that preclude apheresis platelet donation per AABB 
reference standards and subjects with positive amphetamine and/or cocaine test results are 
excluded from participating in the study.   
Treatment with aspirin or aspirin -containing medications within 7 days  of apheresis  or 
treatment with non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAID), anti -platelet agents or other 
drugs affecting platelet viability within 3  days of apheresis  (e.g., ibupr ofen or other NSAIDs) 
will preclude apheresis . 
7.3 Subject Compliance  
Healthy subjects who understand the study commitments and sign the informed consent will 
be enrolled in the study.  
Treatment compliance will be tracked by the Investigator  or designee , reco rded on the CRF, 
and monitored by the Sponsor.

• Post infusion r ecovery of  Test platelets at end of storage (Day 7 )  
• Post infusion survival  of Test platelets at end of storage  (Day 7)  
Post-infusion platelet recovery and survival  will be estimated by using radiolabeled platelets  
with a computerized multiple hit gamma function analysis  with a curve fitting algorithm.  
Post-infusion blood samples will be corrected for plasma associated radioisotope and the 
spontaneous in vitro  and vivo dissociation (elution) of radiolabels using the method described 
in the BEST version 4.2.1 ( Appendix B ).  
Recovery and survival  of INTERCEPT components will be evaluated separately  for platelets  
prepared for radiolabeling  with the BEST and Variant 1 procedures.  Results will be compared 
as described in the statistical plan.

b The processed platelet sample for radiolabeling test is assessed for CD62P in Stage 1 only.  
 
Characterization of residual RBCs will be performed either by manual counting or using an 
antibody to CD235a which is expressed on erythrocytes and erythrocyte precursors and is  
associated with the MNS blood group (Reid 2009; Gahmberg, et al . 1978).  
Characterization of residual WBCs will be performed using the Leucocount Kit (Becton Dickenson) which uses propidium iodide that stains the nucleic acids of the DNA contained 
within the WBCs and is analyzed using flow cytometry. 
8.2.2 Radioactivity M easurements  and Recovery and Survival  Estimation  
Samples will be obtained from the radiolabeled Control  and stored Test platelets before 
infusion and used as a radioactive standard. By measuring the volume infus ed, the total dose of 
radioactivity infused will be calculated. The radioactivity of the samples will be determined by 
use of a gamma counter. Sample dilutions for enumeration of radioactivi ty of the standards 
will be calibrated to ensure that measured values are at least 10 -fold background values. 
Duplicates of the subject’s WB will be measured for radioactivity while singletons of all other 
samples will be evaluated. Post -infusion blood sam ples will also be corrected for plasma 
associated radioisotope and the spontaneous in vitro  and vivo  dissociation (elution) of 
radiolabels using the BEST elution assessment method ( BEST version 4.2.1, Appendix B ).

Post infusion blood samples will be also used to determine the level of RBC/WBC  
contamination in the radioactivity  measurements.  Ficoll gradient centrifugation of the WB  
sample will allow for separation of the RBCs  and some WBCs  from the plasma , WBC  and 
platelets . The radioactivity associated with the RBC and non- RBC associated fractions will be 
measured . RBC contami nation will be determined on 1, 4 (or 5 or 6)  and 11±1 DPI in Stage 1 
and only on 11±1 DPI  in Stage 2.  
8.2.4 In Vitro Platelet Assessments  
Samples for analysis of pH need to be analyzed shortly after preparation. The remaining 
indices listed in Table 11  should be tested or prepared for testing following site SOPs. 
Samples for assessment of ATP will be prepared by the site and sent to a centralized lab for 
analysis.  Samples for assessment of CD62P, LDH, glucose, morphology (if fixed) and lactate 
can be prepared and stored for analysis at a later date per site specific SOPs .

9.1 Safety Parameters  
9.1.1 Safety Endpoints  
• Adverse events  
• Vital signs  
• Hematological profile  
• Serum chemistry profile  
9.2 Methods and Timing of Safety Parameters  
Subjects  will be actively monitored for AEs during apheresis collection and during the 
radiolabeled platelet infusion, until they are discharged from the study site . After discharge 
from the study site , all AEs reported by the subject to the study staff will be recorded on the 
CRF . AE and SAE data may be collected by phone or in person by study staff.  
Vital signs are collected  for all stages at screening, and for ea ch study period prior to apheresis 
collection (Day 0), on the day of infusion ( pre-infusion, and approximately  1 and 2 hours  post -
infusion), and on 1, 2, 3, 4 (or 5 or 6), 7 (or 8) and 11 ± 1 DPI . Clinically significant changes  
in vital signs as assessed b y the study investigator will be recorded as AEs .   
Blood samples for hematology and chemistry panels will be obtained from each subject at 
screening,  and for each study period, prior to apheresis platelet collection (Day 0) , prior to 
platelet infusion, and at the last scheduled blood draw  (11±1 DPI ). Clinically significant 
laboratory findings will be recorded as AE s. The subject laboratory assessments are identified 
in Table 9 .  
9.3 Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator records and assesses all AE /SAE s that occur following the start of  the 
apheresis collection through 24 hours after the last DPI blood sample is drawn. All AE /SAE s 
are recorded on the CRF.  
9.3.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  or clinical investigation subject 
administered an investigational product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with

(ICH  E2A II/A/1, 21 C FR 312.32). 
9.3.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death   
• Life-threatening event (results in an immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred)  
• Hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitaliza tion may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judge ment, they may jeopardize the subject  and/ or the subject may require intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
9.3.3 Definition of Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused 
by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
9.3.4 Assessing Relationship of the Adverse Event to  the Study Procedure  
The Investigator is required to assess whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study procedures (apheresis platelet collection and/or study infusion) caused or contributed to an AE , 
per Table 12. Determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study 
apheresis platelet collection or the infusion of radiolabeled  study platelets  caused or 
contributed to an adverse event includes assessing temporal relationships, biologic plausibility, dechallenge/rechallenge information (if available), association (or lack of association) with underlying disease, and presence (or abse nce) of a more likely cause.

9.3.5 Assessing Severity of Adverse Event  
The severity (intensity) of each AE is assessed using the standard severity grading scale 
provided in Table 13.   
Table 13  Severity Grading Scale 
Grade  Definition  
Grade 1 Mild : the recipient required no medical intervention.  
Grade 2 Moderate : the recipient may have required medical intervention (e.g. symptomatic 
treatment) but lack of such would not result in permanent damage or impairment of a 
bodily function   
Grade 3 Severe: signs and symptoms requiring inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of 
hospitalization directly attributable to the event; and/or the event results in persistent 
or significant disability or incapacity; or the event necessitated medical or surgical 
intervention to preclude permanen t damage or impairment of a bodily function.   
Grade 4 Imminently life -threatening: unstable vital signs with major treatment intervention 
required  to prevent death  (e.g. vasopressors, intubation, transfer to intensive care ). 
Grade 5 Death: adverse event resulting in death  following  the implicated apheresis platelet 
collection or transfusion .

10.1 Analysis Sets  
The analysis sets will be defined as follows:  
Safety Analysis Set:  
All randomized subjects who successfully initiate an apheresis collection . 
Evaluable Analysis Set (EAS):  
All randomized and infused subjects who have both paired (Test and Control) recovery 
and paired survival data for the rel evant study stage and/or radiolabeling method, and 
otherwise complied with the protocol without any other major protocol deviation.   
Summaries for the efficacy endpoints will be presented using EAS. All other summaries will be presented using the safety a nalysis set unless stated otherwise.  
10.2  Statistical Methods  
This study utilizes a paired design to characterize the recovery and survival of autologous 
apheresis INTERCEPT Test platelet components stored for 7 days  compared  to their untreated 
“fresh” Control  platelet components.  
In addition, the study is designed to evaluate two different approaches (BEST and  Variant 1  
for Stage 1 , and Variant 1 for Stage 2 ) to radiolabeling stored INTERCEPT platelets for 
evaluation of recovery and survival. R ecovery and survival of INTERCEPT Test platelets will 
be evaluated separately  for each radiolabeling method. 
Data will be summarized descriptively by mean, standard deviation, median, and range 
(minimum, maximum) for continuous parameters and by frequencies and percentages for 
categorical data variables. Summaries will be presented by radiolabeling method across all 
study sites and within each study site. 
Data will be compared between the two radiolabeling methods in Stage 1 .  Correlations 
between the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints may also be explored using graphs 
and/or regression analysis.

Cerus Corporation considers this document to be confidential and not subject to disclosure 
without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  10.2.1 Efficacy An alyses  
10.2.1.1 Primary Endpoints  
Primary efficacy endpoints are the p ost infusion recovery and survival of Test platelets at end 
of storage  for both Stage 1 and Stage 2.  P ost-infusion recovery and survival  of platelets  will 
be calculated based on the corrected r adioactive counts observed from the six post -infusion 
sampling time points at 1, 2, 3, 4 (or 5 or 6), 7 (or 8) , and 11 ± 1 day s post infusion. The 
following acceptance criteria for recovery and survival will be used to demonstrate 
non-inferiority of stored Test platelets against fresh Control  platelets  at the end of Stage 2 :  
1. Post-infusion recovery:  
 H0: Test -  0.66×Control <0 vs. H 1: Test -  0.66×Control ≥0 
The null hypothesis of inferiority will be rejected in favor of the alternati ve hypothesis of non-
inferiority at the two -sided 0.05 significance level  if the lower bound of a two- sided 95% CI 
for the mean treatment difference (Test -  0.66×Control) is  greater than or equal to zero.   For 
any platelet recovery values  that are more tha n 100%, they will be capped at 100% for the data 
analysis.  
2. For survival : 
 H0: Test -  0.58×Control <0 vs. H 1: Test -  0.58×Control ≥0 
The null hypothesis  of inferiority will be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis of non-
inferiority at the two -sided 0.05 significance level  if the lower bound a two -sided 95% CI for 
the mean treatment difference (Test -  0.58×Control) i s greater than or equal to zero.  
The two -sided 95% CI will be constructed using the variance estimated from a paired t test . 
The above acceptance criteria will also be explored for Stage 1 separately  for each 
radiolabeling method that is evaluated  (BEST or Variant 1).   
The primary analysis population for the primary efficacy endpoints will only include subjects who have both paired  (Test and Control)  recovery and paired survival data  for the relevant  
radiolabeling method. Subjects who do not have both paired recovery and paired survival data 
may be replaced  to ensure sufficient number of subjects is reached for the primary analysis . 
Reasons for absence of primary endpoint measurement(s) for any subject will be listed in the 
study report.   
In the event that non- inferiority cannot be declared for the primary endpoints with a minimum 
of 24 evaluable subjects , additional exploratory analyses may be conducted to quantify the 
proportions of subjects whose recovery and survival  data meet the 0.66 and 0.58 cutoff,

recover from the paired fresh control).   
10.2.1.2 Secondary Endpoints  
Data will be summarized descriptively for each stage.  The proportions of Test platelet components with platelet dose ≥ 3.0 ×10
11 (end of INTERCEPT treatment), physical platelet 
recovery ≥80% (end of INTERCEPT treatment), and pH 22°C ≥6.2 (end of storage) will be 
summarized, with the corresponding lower bound of a one -sided 95% CI for the proportion 
provided.

In vitro  assessment of processed platelet samples will be summarized descriptively by 
treatment group (Test vs. Control), sample preparation method (BEST vs. Variant 1) , and 
radiolabeling (51Cr  vs. 111In) as applicable.  Additionally , the proportions of Test platelet 
samples prior to radiolabeling with pH 22°C ≥6.2 and physical platelet recovery ≥80%  will be 
summarized separately for the BEST and Variant  1 procedures as applicable.  
10.2.2.3 Evaluation of Red Blood Cell Contamination  
Assessment of the RBC /WBC  contamination as by Ficoll gradient centrifugation will be 
summarized  descriptively by day post i nfusion, study arm (Test and Control), sample 
preparation method (BEST vs. Variant 1), and radiolabeling (51Cr  vs. 111In).  
10.2.3 Safety Analyses  
Treatment -emergent AEs  (defined as AEs with onset on or after the initiation of apheresis 
platelet collection ) will be su mmarized descriptively.  Other safety data (e.g., vital signs, lab 
data) will be provided in the data listings. 
10.3 Determination of Sample Size 
A sufficient number of subjects will be enrolled to provide 24 evaluable subjects with both 
paired (Test and Control) recovery and paired survival data  for Stage 2.  The sample size of 24  
for Stage 2  is chosen to provide reasonable estimate s of the primary efficacy endpoints.

Collection of accurate, c onsistent, and reliable data will be ensured through the use of written 
standard practices and procedures. Clinical study monitors will assure that CRFs  are 
completed correctly and that complete information has been provided. The Cerus Corporation 
Department of Quality Assurance (QA) will review data collected for this trial. At the discretion of the Sponsor, in addition to the study monitor, a QA representative(s) of the Sponsor may visit a site to ensure proper conduct of the trial in terms of collection and 
recording of data and maintenance of records as appropriate for a study performed under an 
Investigational Device Exemption. 
The clinical site will be monitored routinely to ensure  Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) 
compliance and data quality . The CRF will be verified against the source document and any 
queries concerning the CRF will be generated and resolved/reconciled to assure data integrity.  
The clinical site may be audited by the Sponsor or Sponsor designee for quality control and quali ty assurance purposes, as specified in the Sponsor’s SOPs for GCP compliance.  The 
clinical site may also be audited by a regulatory agency.  
The study will be monitored by the Sponsor's representatives at all stages of study conduct from inception to compl etion in accordance with current GCPs. This monitoring will include 
both centralized and on- site review and source document verification of the data . Centralized 
data will include remote review of the data ( data capture sheets  and electronic CRFs) that are 
provided to Cerus on a regular basis.  On- site monitoring involves the visit of a monitor to the 
investigational site.  The Sponsor's monitor or representative will notify the Investigator prior 
to conducting any investigational site visit.  It is importa nt that the Investigator and other study 
personnel are available during the monitoring visits, and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process. The frequency of these visits will depend upon the progress of the study and will 
encompass all aspects of th e study conduct (i .e. review of all study related procedures, tour of 
the facilities , inspection of  equipment  and appropriate records , completion of electronic CRFs, 
recruiting  methods , record- keeping, protocol adherence, data collection, AE reporting, etc. ). 
Frequency of on -site monitoring may also be decreased due to institutional restrictions on site 
access or research activities due to COVID -19 (FDA 2020) .

The Investigator will maintain appropriate subject records filed by each participating subject. 
Clinical information gathered during this study will be recorded on CRF s. As used in this 
protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an electronic data record or  both, depending on the data collection method used in this trial. 
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject. The completed original 
CRFs are the sole property of Cerus and should not be made available in any form to third 
parties , except for authorized representatives of Cerus or appropriate regulatory authorities, 
without written permission from Cerus.  
It is the investigator's responsibility to ensure completion and to review and approve all CRFs. CRFs must be signed by the inves tigator or by an authorized staff member. These signatures 
serve to attest that the information contained on the CRFs is true. At all times, the investigator has final personal responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all clinical and laboratory 
data entered on the CRFs. Subject source documents are maintained at the trial site. In cases 
where the source documents are the blood donation record, the information collected on the CRFs must match those charts.  
In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document. In these cases, Cerus and the 
investigator must prospectively document which items will be recorded in the source documents and for which items the CRF will stand as the source document.  
All raw data generated at the blood centers wi ll be retained at the blood center.  Raw data 
generated at any external testing facility will be retained by that facility.  Cerus will receive a 
copy of all primary data. Primary data provided to Cerus and generated by Cerus will be 
retained in the Cerus Corporation archives, managed from 1220 Concord Avenue, Suite 600, 
Concord, CA  94520. 
Investigator/institution and the Sponsor shall maintain all study records  required (by subpart 
21CFR 812.140) during the investigation and for a period of two years after the latter of the 
following the two dates: 1) the date on which the investigation is terminated or completed, or 
2) the date that the records are no longer required for purposes of supporting a premarket approval application or a notice of completion of a product development protocol. Investigator/institution shall not destroy any such records prior to obtaining written permission 
from Cerus.

Cerus Corporation considers this document to be confidential and not subject to disclosure 
without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  Introduction  
This file contains a procedure for the radiolabeling of both stored and fresh platelets 
and their autologous reinfusion for the determination of recovery and survival as published in 
the November , 2006, supplement to Transfusion. It is being made available on the BEST 
website in a downloadable format to facilitate implementation as the routine procedure in 
laboratories performing this kind of work. When referencing this procedure, please cite the Transfusion Supplement. 
As detailed in other manuscripts in the Supplement, this procedure was derived from 
the validated,  seminal work of Andrew Heaton, Stein Holme and colleagues in Norfolk, 
Virginia, and adapted for application to Scott Murphy’s insightful approach of comparing a 
new platelet preparation to fresh platelets from the same subject. The effort of adapting the 
procedure (kindly made available by the American Red Cross) for this purpose and thoroughly discussing and debating its content were undertaken by the members of the Biomedical Excellence for Safer Transfusion (BEST) Collaborative through multiple meetings  over a two -
year period. The validation of the adaptation and its application can be found reviewed in other papers in this Supplement. Deviations from this procedure should be accompanied by appropriate validation and documentation. 
Many individuals contr ibuted substantial time and effort in developing, reviewing, and 
validating this procedure. In particular, the leadership of the authors of the other articles in this Supplement should be noted as well as the meticulous reviewing undertaken by Lisa Cooke, Louise Herschel, Jill Roger, Sherrill Slichter, and Ralph Vassallo.  
BEST welcomes receipt of comments regarding the procedure and suggestions for 
further development.

without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  Procedure 
 Purpose: To describe a technique for radioisotopic labeling and infusion of f resh or 
stored platelets with 111 In Oxine (111Indium) and Na 251CrO 4 (51Chromium). 
 While the measurement of platelet recovery and survival can be used for a 
variety of purposes, this procedure is intended for assessment of the in vivo  
viability of platelets that have been stored and/or treated in comparison with fresh platelets from the same subject.  
 This procedure includes the basic calculations for determining platelet recovery and survival. The recommended manner of comparing the results between control and test infusions is through comparison of the paired differences and calculation of upper confidence intervals as detailed by Dumont in this supplement (See 2.6.).

 Preparation of Platelets for Labeling with 111Indium Oxine  
 Preparation of freshly collected platelets  
4.1.1 Using a 19- gauge needle, collect 43 mL (± 2 mL) of venous blood into a 
60 mL sterile plastic syringe containing 9 mL of ACD -A.  Avoid a 
traumatic venipuncture at the start of blood drawing. Care should be 
taken to avoid excessive negative pressure in the syringe during draw to prevent activatio n of the platelets. (Alternatively, 43 mL of whole blood 
can be collected with 7 mL of ACD -A followed by a 1- 2 h holding 
period in Step 4.1.3.)  
4.1.2 At the same time as 4.1.1, collect one 5 or 7 mL blood sample from the subject into an EDTA tube. Mix well. Rese rve for determination of 
radiolabel elution (see Step 9.0).  
4.1.3 Using sterile technique, in a laminar flow hood, remove the needle and express the contents of the syringe into two sterile 50 mL screw -cap 
conical centrifuge tubes. A hold period of 30 minutes for the ACD -
A/blood mixture before further processing should be utilized.  
4.1.4 Centrifuge (soft spin) the conical tubes at 180 to 200 x g for 15 minutes at 20 to 24°C  with the brake off to produce red cell -poor platelet –rich 
plasma (PRP) .   
4.1.5 Remove the PRP from both tubes with a sterile transfer pipette or spinal needle and syringe and place into a single 50 mL sterile conical plastic centrifuge tube.  Avoid aspirating any contaminating red cells.  
4.1.6 Add a volume of sterile ACD -A equal to 15% of the volume of PRP to 
the PRP.  Cap the tube and mix gently by inversion. Continue with Step 4.3. 
 Preparation of aliquot from stored platelet unit  
4.2.1 Ensure unit is thoroughly mixed and platelets are completely suspended.  
4.2.2 Using sterile technique, in a laminar flow hood, gently re move 10 mL 
from the stored platelet unit using a 20 mL syringe and 16 ga needle.   
4.2.3 Remove the needle and express the contents of the syringe into a  15 mL screw -cap conical  labeled centrifuge tubes containing  1.5 mL sterile 
ACD- A . Cap and mix gently by inversion. 
4.2.4 Centrifuge (soft spin) the conical tubes at 180 to 200 x g for 5 minutes at 20 to 24°C  with the brake off to produce red cell -poor platelet -rich 
plasma (PRP).   
4.2.5 Remove the PRP with a sterile transfer pipette or spinal needle and syringe and plac e into a new 15 mL sterile conical plastic centrifuge 
tube.  Avoid aspirating any contaminating red cells. Continue with Step 4.3.

 Centrifuge (hard spin) the ACD -PRP at 1500- 2000 x g for 15 minutes at 20 to 
24ºC with brake off.   
 Remove the platelet -poor plasma (PPP) produced, as completely as possible 
and transfer to a new sterile conical tube. Spin PPP a second time (1500- 2000 x 
g for 15 minutes with brake off), discard pellet and reserve supernatant PPP in a 
sterile tube for later use (Steps 4.6.2 and 4.6.5). 
 Using a sterile pipet, resuspend the harvested platelet pellet with 2 mL of ACD -
A/saline solution. Make sure a complete resuspension is achieved with no visible aggregates or clumps before starting radiolabeling. (Failure to obtain complete resuspens ion of platelets is a cause for discontinuation of the 
procedure) .  
 Platelet Labeling with 111 Indium -Oxine  
4.6.1 Add 50 to 60 µCi of 111 Indium -Oxine labeling solution (Step 3.13) to 
the washed platelet suspension. Incubate at 20 to 24°C  for 20 minutes to 
achieve labeling. (Note: 1 Ci = 3.7x1010 Bq). 
4.6.2 At the end of incubation, add 3.5 mL of ACD -A/saline and 0.5 mL of 
the reserved PPP (from Step 4.4) directly to the incubation tube containing the platelets in ACD -A/saline and 
111In. 
4.6.3 Centrifuge the tube at 1250 x g at 20 to 24°C  for 10 minutes with brake 
off. 
4.6.4 Remove the supernatant and retain in a separate test tube.  Determine the activity of this supernatant and the labeled pellet in a dose calibrator. Calculate and note the efficiency of labeling by dividing the  activity of 
the pellet by the combined activities of the pellet and supernate.  
4.6.5 Gently resuspend the platelet -pellet in 2 mL of PPP reserved previously 
(from Step 4.4). (Failure to obtain complete resuspension of platelets is a cause for discontinuation of  the procedure.) After complete 
resuspension, add an additional 4 mL of PPP.

 Resuspend the harvested platelet pellet in one tube with 3 mL of ACD -A/saline 
solution.  Using a sterile transfer pipette, transfer the resuspended platelets to 
the other tube containing the platelet pellet.  Resuspend the second platelet button. Make sure a complete resuspension is achieved with no visible aggregates or clumps before starting the next step.  
 Platelet Labeling with Na251CrO4  
5.6.1 Add 50 to 100 µCi Na 251CrO 4 to the washed platelet  suspension. 
Incubate at 20 to 24°C  for 20 minutes to achi eve labeling.  
5.6.2 At the end of incubation, add 2.5 mL of ACD -A/saline and 0.5 mL of 
the reserved PPP (from Step 5.4) directly to the incubation tube containing the platelets in ACD -A/saline and Na
251CrO 4. 
5.6.3 Centrifuge the tube at 1250 x g at 20 to 24°C  for 10 m inutes with brake 
off. 
5.6.4 Remove the supernatant and retain in a separate test tube.  Determine the activity of this supernatant and the labeled pellet in a dose calibrator. Calculate and note the efficiency of labeling by dividing the activity of the pellet by the combined activities of the pellet and supernatant.  
5.6.5 Gently resuspend the platelet -pellet in 2 mL of PPP reserved previously 
(from Step 5.4). (Failure to obtain complete resuspension of platelets is a cause for discontinuation of the procedure.) After  complete 
resuspension, add an additional 4 mL of PPP.  
 Injectate and Standard Preparation  
 Label five 100 mL volumetric flasks and five 12 x 75 mm polystyrene tubes with the isotope used, subject name and/or unit identification, date prepared and In STD, Cr  STD, and STD I, II or III.  
NOTE: The In STD and the Cr STD are necessary only if calculation of “cross -
up” and “cross -down” corrections requires them.  
Add 1.8 mL 0.9% saline to each 12 x 75 mm standard capped tube.  Weigh 
each tube and record the weights.  Take care that the saline does not touch the 
cap.Add 10 mL of 0.2% SDS -saline solution (1 part saturated (20%) SDS + 99 
parts 0.9% saline) to each flask.  
 Mix each single labeled platelet aliquots (from Steps 4.6.5 and 5.6.5). Draw 
0.3mL of each suspension into its own 1cc syringe through a 16- gauge needle. 
 Weigh the filled syringe, needle and needle cover accurately.  Record the weight.

 Carefully add 0.2 mL of each injectate directly into each flask, “Cr STD” or “In 
STD”, as appropriate.  Add 0.9% saline to the flask to bring to volume.  Mix carefully. Weigh the syringe, needle and needle cover accurately and determine the mass of labeled injectate placed in each standards flask.  
 Draw the appropriate radioactive dose of 51Cr-labeled platelets into  a labeled 
syringe.  Weigh the syringe and record the radioactive dose. 
NOTE: The activity needed to be injected is dependent on a number of 
variables, such as the gamma counter’s crystal size.  In general, 10- 20 µCI are 
required to be injected for accurat e determinations. The injectates of the fresh 
and stored platelets should have approximately the same activities.  
 Remove 111In-labeled platelets from the centrifuge tube until the dose intended 
to be injected is remaining. Measure and record the radioacti ve dose.  Record 
the weight of the tube.  
 Carefully verify subject identification on the chromium syringe and indium 
tube.  Inject the 51Cr-labeled platelets into the centrifuge tube containing the 
111In-labeled platelets.  
 Mix the labeled injectate in the tube.  Prepare final mixed injectate for infusion by using an 18 gauge spinal needle and a syringe labeled with subject information to aspirate all but at least 1 mL of labeled solution in conical tube. (This remaining amount will be used for preparation of  standards and 
determination of cell bound activity.)  
 Remove the spinal needle and replace with a sterile syringe cap. Record the weight of the final injectate syringe and cap.   
 Draw approximately 0.8 mL of the remaining labeled solution from the tube containing the 
51Cr- and 111In-labeled platelets into a 1cc syringe through a 
16-gauge needle to be used for standard preparation. 
 Record the weight of the filled syringe, needle, and needle cover.  
 Carefully add 0.2 mL of the injectate directly into the flas k labeled "STD I”.  
Add 0.9% saline to the flask to bring to volume.  Mix carefully.  
 Reweigh the 1 cc syringe, needle and needle cover and record this weight and the difference between the two weights (this being the net weight of the mixed injectate added  to the standards flask).  
 Repeat Steps 6.14 and 6.15 for the remaining two flasks. 
 Pipet 0.2 mL of each standard into the appropriate pre -weighed capped tube 
containing 1.8 mL saline, one sample tube per standard.  
 Weigh the capped tubes and record the weight.  Take care that the sample does not touch the cap.

 Infusion Procedure  
 Allow recipient to sit in the donor bed to stabilize.  Record pre -infusion vital 
signs. 
 Verify that recipient's identifiers match the information on the infusion syringe. 
 Perform ve nipuncture with a 19- 21 gauge butterfly infusion needle.  Draw one 
10 mL EDTA (lavender -top) tube for the pre -infusion sample. 
 Flush the line with saline to ensure patency of the vein.  Inject labeled platelet 
suspension slowly.  Record exact time (starting from time 1/2 of injectate has been infused).  
 Flush butterfly line and needle with 10 mL of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride.    
 Remove butterfly needle and apply pressure to injection site.  Apply bandage when bleeding has stopped. 
 Weigh empty infusion syringe, needle and needle cover.  Record weight on the data sheet.  Record the net weight of injectate.  
 Dispose of used supplies in the receptacle labeled for radioactive waste.  
 Measure and record post -infusion vital signs.  
 Sampling Procedure and  Sample Preparation  
 One 5 -10 mL EDTA (lavender -top) tube sample is to be drawn by direct 
venipuncture at the post -infusion times:  
8.1.1 Pre-infusion (from Step 7.3). 
8.1.2 Optional: 2 hours after infusion. (Collect from the contralateral arm to that used for infusion.)  
8.1.3 One sample daily between days 1 through day 7 (except weekends for samples after  Day 1) and one final sample on day 10, 11 or 12. (The last 
sample is called the “baseline” sample and is used to correct for inadvertent labeling of other blood components.)  
NOTE: As the points at the beginning of the curve are most important in 
determining the parameters of the curve, daily sampling on Days 1, 2, 
and 3 afford more accurate projections of recovery and survival parameters and should be taken if at all possible. A total of at least 5 data points from samplings on Days 1- 7 should be obtained. 
Delaying the final sample from Day 10 to Day 12 results in lower counts and, potentially, counts that are inadequate to achieve desired accuracy. Obtaining the final sample on Day 10, if possible, is desirable.

 Sample Processing:  
NOTE:  Processing should be completed as soon as possible after 
sampling to prevent post -sampling elution from skewing the proportion 
of activity found in the cellular fraction. 
8.2.1 Prior to the infusion, label and weigh capped 12 x 75 mm polystyrene 
tubes:  one for each sampling tim e (including pre -sample) for whole 
blood, packed cells and plasma. Tubes for daily samples may be labeled and weighed on the day of use or beforehand.  
8.2.2 Just prior to aliquoting sample, thoroughly mix each timed sample from the subject manually or for a maxi mum of two minutes on a rocker.  
8.2.3 Pipet approximately 2.0 mL of the mixed whole blood into the appropriate pre -weighed tube using a positive displacement pipettor and 
replace cap.  
8.2.4 Weigh the capped tube and record the weight.  Take care that the sample does not touch the cap.  
8.2.5 Pipet approximately 2.0 mL of blood into the appropriate tube labeled for packed cells.  
8.2.6 Centrifuge this second set of tubes at 2000 x g for 15 minutes at room temperature.  
8.2.7 Pipet the plasma from the packed cell tubes to the appropriate tub e 
labeled for plasma.  
8.2.8 Count the "splits" (packed cell and plasma tubes, including the injectate). (When possible, count the “splits” on the day of sampling.)  
NOTE: The size of sample volumes may be increased if desired.  
 Elution of Radioactivity from Labele d Platelets in Whole Blood  
 Add 10 µL of the mixed injectate into a 5 or 7 mL EDTA tube of blood collected from the subject as soon as possible after the infusion of the labeled cells procedure. (See Section 4.1.2 or 5.1.2.) . 
Note: This timing is anticipating infusion of the radiolabeled platelets at the 
earliest  possible time. If delay in infusion is anticipated, the elution steps 
described in this section should be begun so that the separation of the supernatant after the next step occurs approxi mately coincidently with the 
infusion. 
 Mix and incubate the tube for two hours at 37ºC in a wet incubator (water bath) 
or a dry incubator in a cylinder of water.  
 Pipet approximately 2 mL into a 12 x 75 mm capped tube.

 Spin at 2000g for 15 minutes. 
 Transfer the supernatant plasma to a capped 12 x 75 mm capped tube.  
 Count the splits.  
 The activity found in the cells and plasma will be used to evaluate the in vivo 
cell-bound activity of the labeled platelets for each of the two radiolabels. 
Elution = (CPM super nate)/[( CPM cells) + (CPM supernate )] 
 Counting  the Samples   
 Ensure required quality control and preventive maintenance procedures are performed according to the operating instructions. Load racks into counter and start counting. Count whole blood samples once all samples from the subject have been collected and processed (including Day 10, 11 or 12 sample). (One can also count standards and splits, daily.)  
 Load the gamma counter in a standard order, such as:  blank/background, standards, elutions, pre -infusi on, and post -infusion timed specimens in order 
collected.   
 Select appropriate counting program. Set count time to achieve a 2% accuracy, including background.  
 When the tubes have finished counting, label the instrument printout. Verify that the background has not drifted significantly.  Verify that all samples counted for expected times.  Place the gamma counter printouts in the appropriate file.  
 Transfer all data to appropriate spreadsheets for calculations. Verify accurate transcription. 
 Calculations  
 Determine corrected CPM /g for each sample.  
Most gamma counters correct automatically for background activity and decay 
during counting as well as for “cross -up” and “cross -down”, that is, counting of 
one isotope’s activity in the other’s channels. Samples and standards must all be corrected for these parameters as well as corrected to the same time for 
calculations to be valid. Using these corrected CPM values reported by the 
gamma counter (CPM
corrected ), determine CPM/g for standards and timed subject 
sample s as follows:  
11.1.1 Standards: STD = CPM corrected  * dilution factor/mass counted, where 
dilution factor = mass of standard/mass of injectate added

Cerus Corporation considers this document to be confidential and not subject to disclosure 
without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  NOTE: Since the diluent for the standard is water, the specific gravity of 
the standard may be assumed to be 1.00, and the final volume of the standard in mL may be taken as its mass in g. 
11.1.2 Timed sample activity: SAMPLE = CPM
corrected  /mass counted  
 Determine cell -bound proportion for timed count adjustment  
Using timed split samples (Section 8.2.8), determine the proportion of the activity in each timed sample that can be associated with the cellular fraction:   
Cell Bound Fraction (CBF
Time t) = (Activity of cells)/(Activity of 
cells + Activity of plasma) = (CPM cell bound )/[( CPM cell bound ) + 
(CPM plasma )] 
 Standard a djustment for injectate elution:  
11.3.1 Determine the mean CPM of the three mixed standards  
(Steps 6.1 and 11.1.1).  
11.3.2 Multiply the mean CPM of the standard samples by the elution 
correction (Step 9.7).  
STD corrected  = STD * (1 -Elution)  
 Adjustment for cell -bound proportion and baseline  
The following two adjustments should be made to the timed sample 
CPM/g counts. These adjustments result in “fully adjusted counts” used 
for curve fitting.  
11.4.1 Adjustment of timed sample for cell- bound proportion (Steps 11.1.2, 
11.2):  
SAMPLE Time t  = SAMPLE (CPM/g) x (CBF Time t ) 
Adjust for non- platelet residual activity baseline, according to the day 
on which the “baseline” sample was taken. (This results in fully 
adjusted timed sample counts.) .  
11.4.1.1 Day 10  
Fully adjusted count = SAMPLE Time t  –  [SAMPLE Day 10  x  (1.20- 0.20

Fully adjusted count = SAMPLE Time t  –  [SAMPLE Day 12  x  (1.24- 0.24 
(Time t/Time of Day 12 sample)]  
Note: “Time t” is the elapsed time in hours from the time of infusion 
(Step 7.4) to the time of sampling. “Time of Day 10 sample” is the 
elapsed time in hours from time of infusion (Step 7.4) to the time the 
sample was obtained on Day 10 following infusion. 
These calculations are based on the published experience of reference 
2.3 and the expectation that 51Cr persistence is the primary source of 
persistent activity. Persistent activity attrib utable to 111In is less of a 
concern because of its shorter half -life, its higher elution from any 
contaminating red cells that were labeled and the lack of oxine to 
facilitate labeling after elution from platelets.  
 Determination of expected time 0 count following infusion  
11.5.1 Calculate blood volume:   
Male: BV (mL) = ([0.3669*{height (m)} 3] + 0.03219*weight 
(kg) + 0.6041)*1000  
11.5.2 Female: BV (mL) = ([0.3561*{height (m)}3] + [0.03308*weight  (kg)] 
+ 0.1833)*1000Convert the blood volume calculated in 11.5.1 to blood 
mass by multiplying the volume by the specific gravity of whole blood. The specific gravity may be taken as 1.05 g/mL, or, if the subject’s hematocrit is known, it may be estimated as (1541 + Hct)/1500 (Subject hematocrit is expressed as a percentage rat her than a decimal; expected 
SG usually between 1.053 and 1.060 g/mL.). 
11.5.3 Determine expected time
0 (t=0) count (Steps 11.3.2, 7.0, 11.5.2)  
Time 0 Count  = STD corrected  * Infusate mass (g) / Blood mass  
 Determine recovery for each timed sample (optional)  
Take e ach fully adjusted sample count (11.4.2) and divide by the 
expected time0 count (11.5.3) to calculate the recovery at each sampling 
time:

 Kinetic curve fitting  
The fully adjusted timed -sample counts (Step 11.4.2) for times greater than 20 
hours are used for kinetic curve fitting and estimation of recovery and survival. 
That is, the 2 hour time sample is not used for kinetic curve fitting. These 
parameters may be estimated using a validated non -linear curve fitting routine 
found in various statistical and pharmacokinetic computer program packages. 
The use of COS T software, one of these software packages, is described below. 
Optionally, the recovery of timed- samples calculated in Step 11.6 may be used. 
Recovery is determined as the extrapolated y -axis intercept (t=0) of the survival 
curve, expressed as the blood cell -bound activity in proportion to the expected 
activity as projected from the blood volume -based dilution.  
The fully adjusted count data (CP M/g) for each timed sample point are entered 
into the COST program as y values, the time after infusion (in hours) as x 
values, and the expected time 0 count. (Optionally, the recovery of each timed 
sample from 11.6 may be entered as y values.)  
11.7.1 Activate the  COST program. 
11.7.2 Select the appropriate group in COST into which the subject's data will 
be entered.

count, Step 11.4.2) for each timed sample. Double check entry accuracy. (Optionally, enter the y value as recoveries from 11.6) . 
11.7.5 Enter the time
0 count from 11.5.3 into counts/milliliter field. (If the 
individual timed recoveries from 11.6 are used as y values, enter 100 into the counts/milliliter field in COST to set the 100% recovery point).  
11.7.6 Perform data analyses using the multiple hit model.  
11.7.7 If outliers are found, determine potential source of error and flag for review by medical director. Remove point from curve only if clearly a spurious res ult. 
11.7.8 Save and print results. Append to unit records.

This file contains a procedure for the radiolab eling of both stored and fresh platelets 
and their autologous reinfusion for the determination of recovery and survival as published in 
the November, 2006 supplement to Transfusion. It is being made available on the BEST website in a downloadable format to facilitate implementation as the routine procedure in 
laboratories performing this kind of work. When referencing this procedure, please cite the 
Transfusion Supplement. 
As detailed in other manuscripts in the Supplement, this procedure was derived from 
the validated, seminal work of Andrew Heaton, Stein Holme and colleagues in Norfolk, 
Virginia, and adapted for application to Scott Murphy’s insightful approach of comparing a new platelet preparation to fresh platelets from the same subject. The effort of adapting the procedure (kindly made available by the American Red Cross) for this purpose and thoroughly 
discussing and debating its content were undertaken by the members of the Biomedical 
Excellence for Safer Transfusion (BEST) Collaborative through mult iple meetings over a two -
year period. The validation of the adaptation and its application can be found reviewed in other papers in this Supplement. Deviations from this procedure should be accompanied by 
appropriate validation and documentation. 
Many indi viduals contributed substantial time and effort in developing, reviewing and 
validating this procedure. In particular, the leadership of the authors of the other articles in this Supplement should be noted as well as the meticulous reviewing undertaken by Lisa Cooke, 
Louise Herschel, Jill Roger, Sherrill Slichter, and Ralph Vassallo.  
BEST welcomes receipt of comments regarding the procedure and suggestions for further 
development.

 Purpose : To describe a technique for radioisotopic labeling and infusion of fresh 
or stored platelets with 111 In Oxine (111Indium) and Na 251CrO 4 (51Chromium).  
 While the measurement of platelet recovery and survival can be used for a 
variety of purposes, this procedure is intended for assessment of the in vivo viability of platelets that have been stored and/or treated in comparison with fresh platelets from the same subject  
 This procedure includes the basic calculations for determining platelet recovery and survi val. The recommended manner of comparing the results between 
control and test infusions is through comparison of the paired differences and calculation of upper confidence intervals as detailed by Dumont in this supplement (See 2.6.)

 Label five 100 mL volumetric flasks and five 12 x 75 mm polystyrene tubes with the isotope used, subject name and/or unit identification, date prepared and 
In STD, Cr STD, and STD I, II or III  
NOTE: The In STD and the Cr STD are necessary only if calculation of 
“cross --p” and “cross -down” corrections requires them  
 Add 1.8 mL 0.9% saline to each 12 x 75 mm standard capped tube.  Weigh 
each tube and record the weights.  Take care that the saline does not touch the cap. 
 Add 10 mL of 0.2% SDS -saline solution (1 part saturated (20%) SDS + 99 parts 
0.9% saline) to each flask. 
 Mix each single labeled platelet aliquots (from Steps 4.6.5 and 5.6.5). Draw 0.3mL of each suspension into its own 1cc syringe through a 16- gauge needle. 
 Weigh the filled syringe, needle and needle cover accurately.  Record the weight  
 Carefully add 0.2 mL of e ach injectate directly into each flask, “Cr STD” or “In 
STD”, as appropriate.  Add 0.9% saline to the flask to bring to volume.  Mix carefully. Weigh the syringe, needle and needle cover accurately and determine the mass of labeled injectate placed in each  standards flask  
 Draw the appropriate radioactive dose of 51Cr-labeled platelets into a labeled 
syringe.  Weigh the syringe, and record the radioactive dose

 Sampling Procedure and Sample Preparation  
 One 5 -10 mL EDTA (lavender -top) tube sample is to be drawn by direct 
venipuncture at the post -infusion times:  
8.1.1 Pre-infusion (from Step 7.3)  
8.1.2 Optional: 2 hours after infusion. (Collect from the contralateral arm to 
that used for infusion.)  
8.1.3 One sample daily between days 1 through day 7 (except weekends for samples after  Day 1) and one final sample on day 10, 11 or 12. (The last 
sample is called the “baseline” sample and is used to correct for inadvertent labeling of other blood components.)  
NOTE: As the points at the beginning of the curve are most important in 
determining the parameters of the curve, daily sampling on Days 1, 2, 
and 3 afford more accurate projections of recovery and survival parameters and should be taken if at all possible. A total of at least 5 data points from samplings on Days 1- 7 should be obtained 
Delaying the final sample from Day 10 to Day 12 results in lower 
counts and, potentially, counts that are inadequate to achieve d esired 
accuracy. Obtaining the final sample on Day 10, if possible, is desirable. 
 Sample Processing:  
NOTE:  Processing should be completed as soon as possible after sampling to prevent post -sampling elution from skewing the proportion 
of activity found in the cellular fraction.  
8.2.1 Prior to the infusion, label and weigh capped 12 x 75 mm polystyrene tubes:  one for each sampling time (including pre -sample) for whole

and weighed on the day of use or beforehand  
8.2.2 Just prior to aliquoting sample, thoroughly mix each timed sample from the subject manually or for a maximum of two minutes on a rocker  
8.2.3 Pipet approximately 2.0 mL of the mixed whole blood into the appropriate pre -weighed tube using a positive displacement pipettor and 
replace cap  
8.2.4 Weigh the capped tube and record the weight.  Take care that the sample does not touch the cap

8.2.8 Count the "splits" (packed cell and plasma tubes, including the injectate). (When possible, count the “splits” on t he day of sampling.)  
NOTE: The size of sample volumes may be increased if desired  
 Elution of Radioactivity from Labeled Platelets in Whole Blood  
 Add 10 µL of the mixed injectate into a 5 or 7 mL EDTA tube of blood collected from the subject as soon as poss ible after the infusion of the labeled

Note: This timing is anticipating infusion of the radiolabeled platelets at the 
earliest possible time. If delay in infusion is anticipated, the elution steps described i n this section should be begun so that the separation of the 
supernatant after the next step occurs approximately coincidently with the 
infusion

 Counting the Samples  
 Ensure required quality control and preventive maintenance procedures are 
performed according to the operating instructions. Load racks into counter and start counting. Count whole blood samples once all samples from the subject have been collected and processed (including Day 10, 11 or 12 sample). (One can also count standards and splits, daily.)  
 Load the gamma counter in a standard order, such as:  blank/background, 
standards, elutions, pre -infusion, and post -infusion timed specimens in order 
collected  
 Select appropriate counting program. Set count time to achieve a 2% accuracy, including background.  
 When the tubes have finished counting, label the instrument printout. Verify that the background has not drifted significantly.  Verify that all samples counted for expected times.  Place the gamma counter printouts in the appropriate file  
 Transfer all d ata to appropriate spreadsheets for calculations. Verify accurate 
transcription  
 Calculations  
 Determine corrected CPM /g for each sample  
Most gamma counters correct automatically for background activity and decay 
during counting as well as for “cross -up” an d “cross -down”, that is, counting of 
one isotope’s activity in the other’s channels. Samples and standards must all be corrected for these parameters as well as corrected to the same time for 
calculations to be valid. Using these corrected CPM values repor ted by the 
gamma counter (CPM
corrected ), determine CPM/g for standards and timed subject 
samples as follows:  
11.1.1 Standards: STD = CPM corrected  * dilution factor/mass counted, where 
dilution factor = mass of standard/mass of injectate added  
NOTE: Since the diluent for the standard is water, the specific gravity of 
the standard may be assumed to be 1.00, and the final volume of the standard in mL may be taken as its mass in g. 
Dilution of standards must be calibrated to ensure that measurements at 
baseline are > 10 fold higher than background

corrected  /mass counted

 Determine cell -bound proportion for timed count adjustment  
Using timed split samples (Section 8.2.8), determine the proportion of the 
activity in each timed sample that can be associated with the cellular fraction: 
Cell Bound Fraction (CBF Time t) = (Activity of cells)/(Activity of cells + 
Activity of p lasma) = (CPM cell bound )/[(CPM cell bound ) + (CPM plasma )] 
 Standard adjustment for injectate elution:  
11.3.1 Determine the mean CPM of the three mixed standards (Steps 6.1 and 
11.1.1)  
11.3.2 Multiply the mean CPM of the standard samples by the elution correction (Step 9.7)  
STD
corrected  = STD * (1 -Elution)  
 Adjustment for cell- bound proportion and baseline  
The following two adjustments should be made to the timed sample CPM/g 
counts. These adjustments result in “fully adjusted counts” used for curve fitting  
11.4.1 Adjustment of timed sample for cell- bound proportion (Steps 11.1.2, 
11.2):  
SAMPLE 
Time t = SAMPLE (CPM/g) x (CBF Time t) 
11.4.2 Adjust for non- platelet residual activity baseline, according to the day 
on which the “baseline” sample was taken. (This results in ful ly 
adjusted timed sample counts.)  
11.4.2.1 Day 10  
Fully adjusted count = SAMPLE Time t – [SAMPLE Day 10  x (1.20-
0.20 (Time t/Time of Day 10 sample)]  
11.4.2.2 Or, Day 11  
Fully adjusted count = SAMPLE Time t – [SAMPLE Day 11  x

sample was obtained on Day 10 following infusion 
These calculations are based on the published experience of reference 
2.3 and the expectation that 51Cr persistence is the primary source of 
persisten t activity. Persistent activity attributable to 111In is less of a 
concern because of its shorter half -life, its higher elution from any 
contaminating red cells that were labeled and the lack of oxine to 
facilitate labeling after elution from platelets  
 Determination of expected time 0 count following infusion  
11.5.1 Calculate blood volume:   
Male: BV (mL) = ([0.3669*{height (m)} 3] + 0.03219*weight (kg) + 
0.6041)*1000 
Female: BV (mL) = ([0.3561*{height (m)}3] + [0.03308*weight (kg)] + 
0.1833)*1000 
11.5.2 Convert the blood volume calculated in 11.5.1 to blood mass by 
multiplying the volume by the specific gravity of whole blood. The specific gravity may be taken as 1.05 g/mL, or, if the subject’s hematocrit is known, it may be estimated as (1541 + Hct)/1500 (Subject hematocrit is expressed as a percentage rather than a decimal; expected 
SG usually between 1.053 and 1.060 g/mL.). 
11.5.3 Determine expected time
0 (t=0) count (Steps 11.3.2, 7.0, 11.5.2)  
Time 0 Count = STD corrected  * Infusate mass (g) / Blood mass  
 Determine recovery  for each timed sample (optional)  
Take each fully adjusted sample count (11.4.2) and divide by the expected 
time 0 count (11.5.3) to calculate the recovery at each sampling time:  
Recovery Time  t  = Fully Adjusted Count  Time  t  / Time 0 Count   
NOTE: The recovery result that is reported from the study is determined using 
the time0 extrapolation of the curve fitting program  
 Kinetic curve fitting  
The fully adjusted timed -sample counts (Step 11.4.2) for times greater than 20 
hours are used for kinetic curve f itting and estimation of recovery and survival. 
That is, the 2 hour time sample is not used for kinetic curve fitting. These 
parameters may be estimated using a validated non -linear curve fitting routine

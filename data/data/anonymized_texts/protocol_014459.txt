1 Description of objectives and endpoints  
 
The objectives of this study are to evaulate the clinical e fficacy, safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of ISIS  396443 administered intrathecally to patients with later-onset 
Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA).   
1.1 Primary objective, primary endpoint, secondary and tertiary efficacy endpoints  
The primary obje ctive of the study is to examine the clinical efficacy of ISIS  396443 
administered intrathecally to patients with later -onset SMA.   
The primary endpoint is the change from baseline Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale – 
Expanded (HFMSE) score at 15 months. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints are 
• the proportion of subjects who achieve a 3- point or greater increase from baseline 
HFMSE score at 15 months 
• the proportion of subjects who achieve any new motor milestone at 15 months 
• the number of motor milestones achieved per subject at 15 months 
• the change from baseline in Upper Limb Module Test at 15 months 
• the proportion of subjects who achieve standing alone at 15 months 
• the proportion of subjects who achieve walking with assistance at 15 months. 
 The tertiary efficacy endpoints are  
• the change from baseline in CSF SMN protein concentration 
• Clinical Global Impression of Change (investigator and caregiver assessments) 
• the change from baseline in Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL)  
• the change from baseline in Assessment of Caregiver Experience with Neuromuscular 
Disease (ACEND)  
• disease-related hospitalizations and adverse events. 
 
1.2 Secondary objective and endpoints  
The secondary objective is to examine the safety and tolerability of ISIS  396443 administered 
intrathecally to patients with later -onset SMA.  
Safety/tolerability endpoints are adverse events, clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry, 
hematology, urinalysis), ECGs, vital signs, weight, neurological examinations, use of concomitant medications and phy sical examinations.  
 
1.3 Tertiary objective  
The tertiary objective is to examine the cerebral spinal fluid and plasma PK of ISIS  396443 
administered intrathecally to patients with later -onset SMA.

2 Study design 
 
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, sham-procedure-controlled study of ISIS 396443 administered intrathecally over 15 months to patients with later-onset SMA.  Approximately 117 subjects will be randomized 2:1 to receive a 12 mg dose of ISIS 396443 
or undergo a sham procedure as control, respectively.  Randomization will be stratified based 
on the subject ’s age at screening: <6 years versus >6 years.  A separate randomization list will 
be used for Japan.  If a subject does not successfully receive the first dose of ISIS 396443 or 
undergo the first sham procedure, they will be replaced.  
ISIS 396443 will be administered using a loading regimen (dosing on Study Days 1, 29, and 
85) followed by a maintenance dosing 6 months thereafter (Day 274).  Subjects randomized to 
the sham -procedure control group will undergo a sham-procedure on Study Days 1, 29, 85, 
and 274.  
No adjustment of dose is permitted.  However, should a concurrent illness prevent the dosing 
procedure from being performed safely, each scheduled dose may be delayed by up to 4 
weeks.   
The study will consist of screening, treatment, and post- treatmen t follow -up-periods.  The 
total duration of participation in the study is approximately 16 months.  
Blinded safety data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the Sponsor and the Medical 
Monitor. Unblinded safety data will also be reviewed on an ongoing basis by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) (Section 6.6). In the protocol it was planned that an interim analysis may be conducted when all subjects will have completed the month 6 
assessment and at least 39 will have completed the month 15 assessment. An interim efficacy 
analysis will be conducted using a targeted cut-off date of 31 August 2016 for the clinical data. At the time of the interim analysis, it is expected that approximately 52 subjects will have attended the Month 15 assessment and all 126 subjects will have had the opportunity to attend the assessment at Month 6 (Section 5.1).   In the event of a decision by the study Sponsor to terminate the study earlier on the grounds that conducting a sham-controlled study is no longer deemed ethical based on an updated risk benefit assessment of ISIS 396443 from the planned interim analysis, all subjects will be invited for the end- of-double-blind-period (EODBP) study visit, during which all Day 456 
assessments will be conducted. After  comp leting the EODBP visit, subjects will be 
considered study completers and will be allowed to enroll into the open- label extension study.  
 
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
11 2.1 Screening  
 
After informed consent is obtained, subjects will undergo a screening evaluation no greater 
than 28 days prior to administration of the first dose or first sham procedure at which their eligibility for the study will be examined.   
 
2.2 Treatment  
Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be admitted to the study center on Day 1, 
undergo pre-dose evaluations, and then receive either an LP injection of ISIS 396443 or 
undergo a sham procedure.   
Both the sham procedure and ISIS 396443 will be administered by dedicated study personnel 
who are unblinded to treatment assignment (this will not be any of the key study s ite 
personnel such as the Principal Investigator, study coordinator, or outcomes assessors) in a 
dedicated room and the key study personnel and the parents will not be present during the 
procedure to ensure blinding of treatment assignment.   
ISIS 396443 w ill be administered as an intrathecal slow bolus (1 -3 minute) LP injection.  ISIS 
396443 will be administered using a ‘spinal anesthesia’ needle and 5 mL syringe.  A 22G to 
25G spinal anesthesia needle is recommended.  The target site for needle insertion is the 
L3/L4 space, but may be 1 segment above or 1-2 segments below this level, if needed.  
General anesthesia or sedation may be used for the LP injection procedure depending on 
institutional guidelines.  
Subjects randomized to undergo a sham procedure w ill have a small needle prick on the lower 
back at the location where the LP injection would otherwise normally be made in subjects assigned to active treatment. The needle will break the skin but no LP injection or needle 
insertion into the deeper structures will occur. The needle puncture site will be covered with the same bandage that is used to cover the LP injection normally, thus simulating the 
appearance of an LP injection. If anesthesia or sedation is used for the LP procedure in ISIS 
396443- treated  subjects, then in order to maintain the blind, minimal sedation should be used 
for the sham procedure, following institutional procedures. The study subject will be kept in 
the procedure room for the same amount of time that subjects administered study dr ug are 
kept, thus simulating the time period of a study drug administration procedure.  
Study drug and sham kits will be packaged in a blinded fashion.  Blinded kits for sham 
procedure contain artificial CSF (5.0 mL solution per 6 mL vial) that will not be injected but 
will be used to simulate CSF samples for that subject.   
Subjects will return to the study center on Days 29, 85, and 274 for follow-up evaluations and 
subsequent injections/sham procedures. Following the injection/sham procedure on Day 1, 
subjects will remain at the study center for at least 24 hours post- procedure for safety 
monitoring. Following the injection/sham procedure on Days 29, 85, and 274, subjects will 
remain at the study center for at least 6 hours post- procedure for safety monito ring. Safety 
monitoring visits will occur Study Days 30, 86, 92, 169, and 275 (through the last 
injection/sham procedure).  In addition, the study center will monitor the subject’s condition 
through telephone contact on a monthly basis. 
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
12 For subjects receiv ing ISIS 396443, a CSF sample for PK analysis will be taken pre-dose on 
each injection day in a manner that protects the blind.  
Subjects who terminate early from the study will be encouraged to complete assessments per 
the Day 456 visit. Subjects who are randomized but do not successfully receive the first dose of ISIS 396443/undergo the first sham procedure will be replaced. Results from these subjects 
will be reported in the CSR as occurring before the start of treatment and will not be included 
in the f ormal analyses.   
 
2.3 Post -treatment follow -up 
After completion of the Day 275 visit, subjects will enter the 6 -month post- treatment 
evaluation period.  This period consists of two visits on Day 365 and 456 and follow-up 
phone assessments on a monthly basis. After completion of the Day 456 visit, subjects may be eligible to participate in an OLE study, pending study approval by the IRB or IEC and the appropriate regulatory authority.  
The end of study is last subject, last visit (either in -person visit or telephone contact).    
2.4 Schedule of procedures 
Day 1 is considered to be the day when the first dose of ISIS 396443 is administered or when 
the first sham procedure is performed. Subjects are to return to the clinic 4 weeks later on Day 
29 (±1 day), 12 weeks later on Day 85 ( ±2 days), 13 weeks later on Day 92 (±1 day), 24 
weeks later on Day 169 ( ±2 days), 39 weeks later on Day 274 ( ±7 days), 12 months later on 
Day 365 ( ±7 days), and 15 months later on Day 456 ( ±7 days) for final follow -up.  
The schedule of events follows.

16 3 General considerations  
 
In this Statistical Analysis Plan, the terms “control” and “control group” refer to the set of 
subjects who were randomized to undergo the sham procedure, and the terms “treatment” and 
“dosed” are used interchangeably to describe those subjects in the ISIS 396443 group who 
received at least one intrathecal injection of ISIS 396443.  
In order to distinguish nominal visit names from duration defined in terms of days, visit 
names will be referred as “Day 29”, “Day 85,” etc., and “29 days” or “85 days,” etc. will be 
used to define time intervals.  In the protocol definitions of the efficacy endpoints, and 
description of the interim analysis, “Month  6” is used to refer to “Day 169” and “Month 15” 
is used to refer to “Day 456” and this convention will be followed in this SAP. 
The Intent -to-treat (ITT) Set and the Per -protocol Set (PPS) will be used for the efficacy 
analyses.  The ITT Set is defined as all subjects who are randomized and received at least one 
dose of study drug/sham procedure.  Subjects will be analyzed in the treatment group to which they were randomized.  This will be the primary population for the analysis of efficacy endpoints.   
An Interim Efficacy Set will be defined for presentation of the WHO motor milestone 
endpoints in the event an interim analysis is performed.   The Interim Efficacy Set will be 
defined as the subset of subjects in the ITT Set who have the opportunity to be assessed at the 
Month 15 visit. Specifically, the Interim Efficacy Set will include all subjects with a Month 15 visit and all subjects with time difference of at least 463 days (456 plus 7 day window) between date of first dose and the targeted clinical cut -off date for the interim analysis (i.e., 
dosed on or before May 27, 2015). However, a subject who has died or withdrawn will be included provided that there is a time difference of at least 449 days ( 456 minu s 7 day 
window) between the date of first dose and the targeted clinical cut-off date of Aug 31, 2016 for the interim analysis (i.e., dosed on or before June 10, 2015). 
In the event of the study being stopped early, an Efficacy Set will be similarly define d for the  
analysis of motor milestones.   If, however, the study continues to completion as planned, the 
ITT Set will be used for the final analysis of motor milestones.  
The PPS will include the subset of the ITT who complete at least the initial 3 doses o f study 
drug/sham procedures, have baseline and Day 169 efficacy assessments and who have no significant protocol deviations that would be expected to affect efficacy assessments. Significant protocol deviations will be determined prior to database lock bu t will include 
subjects who had onset of signs and symptoms consistent with SMA at less than or equal to 6 months of age, who cannot sit independently, whose HFMSE is <10 or >54 at screening, who had respiratory insufficiency at Screening (defined as medical necessity for invasive or non-invasive ventilation for >6 hours during a 24-hour period), and subjects who took any medicines (such as valproate, riluzole, creatine, sodium phenylbutyrate, hydroxyurea, salbutamol, olesoxime) during the study for the tre atment of SMA, shown to modulate SMN 
gene expression or SMA disease progression in humans or preclinical models. The Safety Set, 
comprised of all subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of study drug 
or underwent one sham procedure, will be used for the analysis of safety data. Subjects 
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
17 randomized to receive sham procedure, incorrectly treated with ISIS 396443 will be counted 
in the ISIS 396443 group from the first dose of ISIS 396443 received. 
The Pharmacokinetic Population is comprised of all subjects who were randomized and for 
which there is at least one evaluable post -dose/post-sham procedure pharmacokinetic sample.  
Analysis of immunogenicity data will also be based upon this population. 
A listing denoting inclusion/exclusion of pa tients in all the analysis populations will be 
provided.  
The individual sites in this multicenter study will be pooled for the purpose of statistical 
analysis.   
Summary statistics will be presented throughout.  For continuous endpoints, the summary 
statistics will generally include number of subjects with data, mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum and maximum. For categorical endpoints, the summary statistics will generally include:  number of subjects randomized and/or dosed, number of subjects with 
data, and the percentage of those with data in each category.  Frequency distributions will be 
presented as appropriate.   
The statistical software, SAS
® version 9.3 or above, will be used for all summaries and 
statistical analyses.  
4 Study subjects  
 
4.1 Subject accountability  
The number of subjects who were screened, who were randomized, who were dosed, and who completed treatment, along with reasons for discontinuing treatment and withdrawing from 
the study, will be presented by treatment group and overall.  I n certain cases, CRF text 
detailing the reasons for discontinuation and/or withdrawal may suggest additional 
clarification of the reason provided on the CRF.  Therefore, additional information for subject 
accounting may be presented, utilizing reasons for discontinuing treatment and/or 
withdrawing from the study reclassified based on the detailed CRF text, prior to database lock.  Listings of those subjects who discontinued treatment and/or withdrew from the study 
and the reasons for discontinuation/withdra wal will be presented.   
4.2 Demographic and baseline disease characteristics  
Baseline data (demography, medical history, SMA history, baseline disease characteristics, 
baseline quality of life) will be summarized.   
Demography includes age, sex, ethnicity and r ace.  Medical history will be coded in MedDRA 
and the number and percentage of subjects with each history by preferred term presented, including the presence of scoliosis and presence of contractures.  SMA history includes age of symptom onset, time from disease onset to enrollment, age at SMA diagnosis, time from 
diagnosis to enrollment, number of copies of the SMN2 gene, highest motor function 
achieved, current motor function, wheelchair use, and amount of physical therapy.   
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
18 Baseline disease characterist ics will be assessed by weight, height, ulnar length, weight for 
age, height for age, HFMSE, motor milestones, Upper Limb Module Test.  These assessments 
are further described in the next paragraph and Section 5. 
Weight for age and height for age will be summarized using the WHO child growth standards 
(WHO Child Growth Standards, 2006) for subjects aged up to 5 years and similarly the WHO 
growth reference data (WHO, 2007) for older subjects.   These standards comprise percentiles 
for weight and height for age by sex and are available on a website (www.who.int) in txt files. 
Subjects will be cross referenced with these files, given the age and sex of the subject to determine below which percentile they lie for each parameter.   The frequency and percentage 
will then be summarized for each of weight for age and height for age in the following 
categories:   ≤ 1
st, ≤ 3rd, ≤5th, ≤15th, ≤25th, ≤50th and > 50th percentile.   The standards do not 
provide weight for age percentiles for subjects aged > 10 years since this is not an appropriate measure due to the confounding effect of the pubertal growth spurt. Therefore, subjects aged > 10 years at baseline will not be included in the summary for this parameter.     
Baseline quality of life and caregiver burden of SMA will be assessed by PedsQL and 
ACEND, respectively . 
Demographic, baseline disease characteristics, and baseline quality of life will be presented 
for the ITT Set, PPS and the Safety Set as appropriate.    
Formal statistical analyses will not be done to test for homogeneity between treatment groups.  
If there are apparent heterogeneities between the groups in any of the subject characteristics that are of clinical importance or could affect the treatment outcome, the impact of the 
imbalances will be investigated a nd, if appropriate, adjustments made in the efficacy and 
safety analyses.   
4.3 Extent of exposure  
The number of doses received and the number of sham procedures performed will be 
displayed using frequency distributions. The amount of ISIS 396443 administered w ill be 
presented using summary statistics.  
Overall time on study will be defined as the total number of days a subject is known to be followed on study calculated as follows:  
 
Overall time on study =  
                     (Last date on study) – (Date of first dose or first sham procedure) + 1.   
The last date on study is defined as the latest visit or telephone contact or evaluation date or 
time of death from all available data for a given subject.  
Time on study will be categorized into the following inter vals: 0 to <=90, 91 to <= 180, 181 
to <=270, 271 to <=360, 361 to <= 450, >450 days and summarized by treatment group and overall.   
Given the long half-life of ISIS 396443, subjects are considered to be exposed to study drug 
from the time the first dose was administered to the last day of follow -up.  Essentially, 
exposure is equivalent to time on study.

19 4.4 Concomitant therapy  
Throughout the study concomitant medications or treatments deemed necessary for treatment 
of adverse events or to provide adequate supportive care may be prescribed.  A concomitant 
medication is any non-protocol specified drug or substance including over-the-counter 
medications, herbal medications and vitamin supplements.  Subjects are prohibited from 
receiving other experimental agents during the study including marketed agents at 
experimental doses that are being used for the treatment of SMA (e.g., oral 
albuterol/salbutamol, riluzole, carnitine, creatine, sodium phenylbutyrate, valproate, hydroxyurea).   All concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health 
Organization drug dictionary (WHODrug).   
A concomitant procedure is any therapeutic intervention (e.g., surgery/biopsy) or diagnostic 
assessment (e.g., X -ray) performed between screening and last visit.  All ancillary proc edures 
will be coded using MedDRA.   
For the purposes of analysis, a concomitant therapy (including medication or ancillary 
procedure) is defined as any therapy that was taken on or after the first injection of ISIS 396443 or first sham procedure.  This includes therapies that were started prior to the 
initiation of dosing/sham procedure if their use continued on or after the date of the first 
injection/first sham procedure.  In order to define concomitant therapies with missing start or stop dates, the fol lowing additional criteria will be used:  
• if both the start and stop dates of a particular therapy were missing, that therapy is 
considered concomitant;  
• if the start date of a therapy was missing and the stop date of that therapy fell on or 
after the date of dosing, that therapy is considered concomitant; 
• if the start date of a therapy was prior to the date of dosing and the stop date of that therapy was missing and the therapy was listed as continuing, that therapy is 
considered concomitant;  
• if the start date of a therapy was prior to the date of dosing and the stop date of that 
therapy was missing and the therapy was listed as not continuing, that therapy is 
considered concomitant; or 
• if the start/stop date of a therapy is partial then where it is not possible to rule out that 
it was not taken concomitantly it will be considered concomitant. 
 
Denote the end date of medication as CMENDT and the study treatment/sham procedure start date as TRTSTDT. The medication is classified concomitant provided any of the following is NOT true: 
• CMENDT is complete and CMENDT is less than TRTSTDT.  
• Day of CMENDT missing and year/month of CMENDT is strictly before year-month of 
TRTSTDT.  
• Month of CMENDT is missing and year of CMENDT is strictly before year of 
TRTSTDT.  
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
20 The number and percentage of subjects taking each type of concomitant medication at 
baseline and during the study will be presented by preferred name for Safety Set .  The number 
and percentage of subjects who underwent each type of ancillary procedure during the s tudy 
will be presented.   
Medications taken as part of the sham or lumbar puncture procedure are collected in the 
unblinded CRF and these will be presented separately.   
 
4.5 Protocol deviations  
Protocol deviations identified during site monitoring will be captured in a protocol deviation 
log and categorized as major or minor deviations.  These deviations will be listed.  Major 
protocol deviations will be summarized including those that lead to exclusion from the Per-
protocol Set.

5 Efficacy data  
 
The primary , secondary, and tertiary efficacy endpoints are listed in Section 1.1. 
 
5.1 Interim and final efficacy analyses  
 An interim analysis may take place when all subjects have completed the 6 -month assessment 
and at least 39 subjects have completed the 15-month as sessment  with a targeted clinical cut -
off date of 31 August 2016. At the interim analysis, only the primary endpoint will be tested. The final efficacy analysis will take place when the last subject completes the 15 -month 
assessment or earlier if the study  is terminated on the grounds that conducting a sham-
controlled study is no longer deemed ethical based on the assessment of risk-benefit of ISIS 396443.    At the interim analysis and final analysis, the same analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used in analyzing the change from baseline in HFMSE score to month 15. At the 
interim analysis, the month  15 endpoint values will not be available for some patients, so a 
multiple imputation method will be used to estimate them ( Section 5.3).  This method will 
also be used in the final analysis for the primary endpoint     The interim analysis results will be reviewed by an independent D ata Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB) and an Unblinded Senior Management Team from the Sponsor. Recommendation will be made o n whether it is appropriate for the trial to continue according 
to the current protocol or whether the protocol needs to be modified. During the interim analysis, subjects will continue in the study.  In the protocol it had been planned to conduct the inte rim efficacy analysis with an alpha of 
0.02, however in finalizing this statistical analysis plan it was decided to conduct the interim analysis at a significance level of 0.025.  If the study is not stopped at the interim analysis, the 
final analysis (test and confidence interval estimate procedures) will be conducted at a significance level determined by the resampling procedure as follows.   
 Let T
1 and T 2 be the standardized test statistics at the interim and final analyses, respectively. 
In order to de termine the alpha level for the final analysis, the correlation between T 1 and T 2 
is first estimated based on the resampling approach (Westfall and Young 1993): 
• Among the 126 subjects enrolled in the study, randomly assign 84 subjects to the ISIS 
396443 group and 42 subjects to the sham control group. 
•  Apply the re- randomized treatment assignment to the interim data and obtain the 
standardized test statistics T 1.  
• Apply the re-randomized treatment assignment to the final data and obtain the 
standardized tes t statistics T 2. 
Repeat the above procedure N times (N=10000) and obtain N pairs of test statistics T 1 and T 2. 
The correlation between T 1 and T 2 will then be estimated as the sample correlation of the N 
pairs.   
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
22 Let c 1  be the cut -off point for the interim two -sided test corresponding to an alpha of 0.025. 
Once the estimated correlation ρ is available, the cut-off point c 2 for the final analysis is 
obtained by solving the nonlinear equation Pr(|T 1| ≥ c 1 or |T 2| ≥ c 2) =0.05, where  (T 1, T2) 
follow a bivariate normal distribution with mean vector (0, 0), standard deviations of 1 and 
correlation ρ.   
5.2 Statistical testing procedures 
 Secondary efficacy endpoints have been rank prioritized:  
• the proportion of subjects who achieve a 3- point or greater increase from  baseline 
HFMSE score at 15 months 
• the proportion of subjects who achieve any new motor milestone at 15 months 
• the number of motor milestones achieved per subject at 15 months 
• the change from baseline in Upper Limb Module Test at 15 months 
• the proportion of subjects who achieve standing alone at 15 months 
• the proportion of subjects who achieve walking with assistance at 15 months. 
 In order to control the Type I error rate at 0.05 across interim and final analyses for the testing of primary and secondary ef ficacy endpoints, a stage wise hierarchical strategy utilizing 
independent alpha spending functions for primary and secondary endpoints (Glimm et al. 2010) will be applied. In the framework of the stage wise hierarchical testing, since the secondary endpoi nts will not be tested at the interim (i.e., no alpha spending), at the final 
analysis alpha = 0.05 will be used in the sequential testing. The entire procedure is described below.
    
 At the interim analysis, the primary efficacy endpoint will be tested a t an alpha of 0.025. If 
the primary efficacy endpoint is statistically significant at the interim analysis, then the secondary endpoints may be descriptively reported. No formal statistical comparison will be performed and no p- values will be calculated for statistical inference for these endpoints.  The 
only alpha spending proposed at the interim analysis is based on analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, the only endpoint at the interim for which formal statistical testing will be conducted.  In the
 event of a decision by the study Sponsor to terminate the study earlier on the grounds 
that conducting a sham -controlled study is no longer deemed ethical based on an updated 
risk-benefit assessment of ISIS 396443 from the planned interim analysis, all subj ects will be 
invited for the EODBP study visit, during which all Day 456 assessments will be conducted.  
The EODBP visit should occur no less than 2 weeks from the most recent dosing/sham procedure administered. After completing the EODBP visit,
 subjects w ill be considered study 
completers and will be allowed to enroll into the OLE  study.  Under this scenario, since 
patient participation and monitoring continue until the study is stopped, the final analysis that incorporates the accrued data will be conduct ed. At the final analysis, the primary efficacy 
endpoint will not be tested again since significance has already been achieved at the interim.  The secondary endpoints will be tested at an alpha of 0.05 as shown in the diagram below.    
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
23 In a scenario where the primary efficacy endpoint is not significant at the interim analysis, no 
additional data will be evaluated. In this case, at the final analysis, the primary endpoint will be tested at an alpha level determined based upon the resampling approach method. If the primary endpoint is not significant at the final analysis, then the testing of the secondary endpoints will be considered exploratory. If the primary endpoint is significant at the final analysis, then the secondary endpoints will be tested at an alpha of 0.05 as shown in the diagram below.  
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
24  
In the event that a secondary endpoint is not significant and formal testing is ended, the 
remaining endpoints will be tested but the results will be considered exploratory.  Proportion of subjects

25 Analyse s of tertiary efficacy endpoints will not include adjustments for multiplicity.  
 
The analysis of safety data for the interim analysis will include all subjects who have received at least one dose of study treatment as of the targeted clinical cut -off date. 
 Although statistical stopping guidelines have been pre- specified for the interim analysis, a 
number of factors must be considered thoroughly as part of the decision to modify or stop the study. A recommendation to modify or stop the study will, therefore, not be based solely on statistical grounds.  
 
5.3 Multiple Imputation of missing data  
 In the protocol it was stated that the multiple imputation procedure would be used to impute missing values for all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.  However in f inalizing this 
statistical analysis plan it was decided that to handle the missing data in the WHO motor milestones, the multiple imputation  procedure won’t be used because historical data showed 
that it’s very rare for non- ambulatory SMA patients to achie ve certain milestones (such as 
walking alone).  Therefore, an imputation approach based upon multiple imputation would face challenges due to low or zero numbers of subjects in the sham arm achieving a response.   
The imputation rules and analyses for motor milestones are detailed in Section 5.6.2.      
Multiple imputation for HFMSE , upper limb module test endpoint, PedsQL and ACEND 
 
Since month 15 HFMSE score values will not be available for many of the patients at the 
interim analysis, missing data will b e handled using the multiple imputation (MI) method 
(Schafer 1997; Schafer 1999).  The same method for imputation of missing values will be 
used at the final analysis.  
 The imputations will be performed on total scores  for baseline and post- baseline visits . The 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method will be used under the multivariate normality assumption to impute the missing score by treatment grou p.  The treatment variable will be 
coded so that the ISIS 396443 group is the first in the sort order and the refore as the MI 
procedure is by treatment the imputation will be performed on ISIS 396443 subjects first.  Prior to the Proc MI step the dataset will be sorted by treatment and then ascending unique subject identifier (USUBJID).   The variable list for imputations will include the baseline total 
score, age at consent, as well as all available post -baseline total scores. A set of 100 complete 
imputed data sets will be generated and the relative efficiency (RE) parameter will be checked.  The RE is a very common parameter used in MI to determine the acceptability of the imputed results.  Regarding the number of imputations, since the sample size in this study is relatively small and proportion of missing information is large, it will be important to run a large number of imputations to get an RE that is close to 98% or higher.   
 For PedsQL and ACEND the imputation will be performed independently on each dimension or summary score (constructed using all, or a subset of dimensions) separately, rather than at the item level.  
 The following pseudo SAS code and seeds will be used to perform the multiple imputation.

Multiple imputation analysis methods 
 For the HFMSE, PedsQL, ACEND, upper limb module the imputations will be performed on the ITT population.  In any sensitivity analyses using multiple imputation such as repeating the main analysis in the PPS the subset of subjects in the PPS will be selected from the 
multiple imputed datasets obtained from the ITT population. If the MI procedure imputes any 
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
27 values outside the expected range for the scale e.g. from 0 to 66 for HFMS-E then va lues 
below 0 will be set to 0 and values above 66 will be set to be 66.   
 For each of the 100 imputed datasets, the endpoint will be compared between treatment groups using an ANCOVA model for continuous endpoints or logistic regression for binary endpoints as described in the main analysis for each endpoint.  The estimates from the 100 fitted models will be combined to provide an overall estimate with corresponding confidence intervals and p-value [Little et al, 2002].  For the continuous endpoints, the difference between treatments and the corresponding CI will be presented.  In addition, for each subject the median change from baseline to each visit will be calculated across the multiple datasets and summarized by treatment group.  For the analyses using  logistic regression the odds ratio and corresponding CI will be presented.  In 
addition, the estimates of the binomial proportions in each treatment arm and the differences between treatments will be presented (Ratitch, 2013).  
 If, due to a small sample s ize or other unforeseen scenario, the multiple imputation model 
does not converge or encounters computational difficulties, then the number of iterations will be increased.  If the model still fails then a Mixed Effects Model with Repeated Measures will 
be used as the primary analysis as described in Section 5.5.1.2.    In the presentation of results from multiply imputed data, the number of subjects with missing data and the degree to which it is missing will be summarized.      
 
5.4 Baseline  
In all efficacy analyses, baseline is defined as the last non -missing assessment prior to the first 
dose of ISIS 396443 or first sham procedure.  
5.5 Analysis methods for the primary endpoint  
The HFMSE is a tool used to assess motor function in children with SMA. The scale was 
originally developed with 20 scored activities and was devised for use in children with Type 2 
and Type 3 SMA with limited ambulation to give objective information on motor ability and 
clinical progression. The expanded scale includes an additional module of 13 items developed to alleviate the ceiling effect and allow evaluation of higher functioning and ambulatory SMA 
patients. Each item is scored 0 (unable), 1(performs with modification or adaptation) or 2 
(able) and the total score is calculated by summ ing the 33 items and ranges from 0 to 66 with 
higher scores indicating greater motor function. If 6 or fewer items are missing, then these 
items will be imputed to be 0 when summing all 33 items. If greater than 6 items are missing, 
then the total score wi ll be set to be missing.  
The primary endpoint is the change from baseline HFMSE score at 15 months.  
An interim analysis based on the primary endpoint may take place ( Sections 5.1 and 5.2) and 
the analytical methods for the final ( Section 5.5.1) and interi m analyses ( Section 5.5.2) are 
described.  
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
28 5.5.1  Final analysis of primary endpoint 
5.5.1.1  Main analysis  
The main analysis is to compare the change from baseline HFMSE score at 15 months 
between the two treatment groups based on the ITT Set.  The data will be analyzed using an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group as a factor and age at screening and baseline HFMSE score as covariates.  The null hypothesis is that ISIS 396443 
and sham procedure control groups have the same change from baseline HFSME score at 15 
months. Missing post- baseline HFMSE  data will be handled using the multiple imputation 
method. 
5.5.1.2  Sensitivity analyses  
Several sensitivity analyses will be performed for the final analysis of the primary endpoint.   
In the first, the main analysis  will be repeated using the dataset from multiple imputation of 
the missing data in the ITT Set, to compare treatment groups using the PPS.   
In the second, the analysis will be performed using a Mixed Effects Model with Repeated 
Measures (MMRM) with an unstructured covariance matrix, where the treatment group, time 
(as a categorical variable), treatment by time interaction, and patient age at screening will be 
included in the model as fixed effects; patient will be a random effect; baseline HFMSE and baseli ne by time interaction will be included as a covariate. No imputation for missing visit 
data will be performed and the analysis will be performed on the ITT Set. 
In the third sensitivity analysis, only the subset of subjects in the ITT Set who have non-
missing values at 15 months will be analyzed using the same ANCOVA model as for the 
main analysis, in essence an analysis of ‘completers’.  
In the fourth sensitivity analysis the missing Month 15 values will be impute d by ‘last 
observation carried forward’.  This will be performed on the ITT set and data will be analyzed 
by analysis of covariance with treatment group as the factor and subject age at screening and 
baseline value as covariates.  
In the fifth sensitivity analysis the main analysis using multiple imputation will be repeated 
but for subjects who have a missing 15 -month assessment and discontinue due to treatment 
failure  or death  the worst of the last observed value or the baseline value w ill be imputed.   
The reasons for treatment termination are captured in the CRF in several  categories as: ‘Investigator judgment’, ‘Voluntary withdrawal’, ‘Pregnancy’, ’Ineligibility’, ’Protocol 
deviation’, ‘Adverse Event’ or ‘Other’, and a free text field captures further detail.  Therefore, a blinded medical review will be conducted, prior to unblinding to adjudicate if any are due to 
treatment failure.  This list will then be used in determining a subject’s response.  
From each imputation method, the data will be analyzed by analysis of covariance with treatment grou p as the factor and subject age at screening and baseline value as covariates.  
5.5.1.3   Exploratory analyses  
In order to further explore the change in HFMSE score during the study and the difference between treatment groups the change from baseline to each visit will be analyzed using an 
ANCOVA model and multiple imputation as described for the main analysis.  A plot of mean 
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
29 change from baseline (based on the estimates from the ANCOVA model)  over time will be 
provided by treatment group.  
The total HFMSE score and  change from baseline to each visit will be presented using 
observed values. Individual items of the HFMSE and changes from baseline to each visit will 
be investigated to determine the pattern of shifts. 
Graphical representations to show each individuals response and Forest plots to summarize 
the primary endpoint and corresponding sensitivity analyses may be presented. 
Analyses will be conducted on the ITT Set and PPS. 
5.5.2  Interim analysis of primary endpoint 
5.5.2.1  Main analysis  
An interim analysis may take place as described in Section 5.1.  At the interim analysis,  the 
primary endpoint will be analyzed using t he same ANCOVA model as planned for the final 
analysis.  Endpoint values will not be available for many of the subjects at the interim analysis 
and the approach to handling missing post- baseline HFMSE  data will also be the same as for 
the final analysis using the multiple imputation method (Section 5.3).   
Analyses will be conducted on the ITT Set. 
5.5.2.2  Sensitivity analyses  
The sensitivity analyses planned for the final analysis of the primary endpoint will be repeated 
at the interim with the exception of the PPS analysis.  
The analysis of subjects with non-missing Month 15 values described for the primary 
endpoint will be performed at 15 months, but it is noted that s ince this is an interim analysis 
the number of subjects available will be small so this is included to explore the trend. 
One exploratory analysis using the same ANCOVA model as the primary analysis may be 
performed based upon the IES.  In the event a subj ect is in the IES but has a missing value at 
15 months then the median value for the subject at Month 15 across the 100 datasets from the multiply imputed data will be used in the imputation.   
The exploratory analyses outlined in Section 5.5.1.3 will be performed  at the interim on the 
ITT Set using the imputed dataset from the main analysis .

31 5.6 Analysis methods for the secondary endpoints 
 
For many of the secondary endpoints, if a subject discontinues due to treatment failure or death  then the subject will be defined to be a non-responder.  This will be determined as 
described in Section 5.5.1.2   
5.6.1  Proportion of subjects who achieve a 3 -point or greater increase from baseline in 
HFSME at 15 months  
5.6.1.1  Final analysis  
Main analysis 
The multiple imputation datasets produced for the analysis of the primary endpoint will be 
utilized.  If a subject terminates the study prior to the 15 -month assessment due to treatment 
failure or death, then the imputed value from the multiple imputation will be ign ored and the 
subject will be considered a non-responder.  Any subject in the ITT Set who has an increase from baseline HFMSE score of 3 or more points at Month 15 will be defined as a responder; 
otherwise, a subject will be considered a non-responder. 
Treatment groups will be compared using logistic regression adjusting for each subject’s age at screening and baseline HFSME score.   
Sensitivity analysis  
Four sensitivity analyses will be performed.  In the first, the main analysis described above will be per formed on the PPS.   
In the second, performed on the ITT Set without any imputation, any subject who has an 
increase from baseline in HFMSE score of 3 or more points at Month 15 will be defined as a 
responder.  If this was not achieved or the Month 15 value is missing , a subject  will be 
defined as a non-responder.  
In the third, performed on the ITT Set without any imputation, if a subject terminates the 
study prior to the 15-month assessment due to treatment failure or death , then the subject will 
be consi dered as a non -responder, if the subject has missing Month 15 due to any other 
reason , he/she will not be included in the analysis.  
In the fourth sensitivity analysis, only the subset of subjects in the ITT Set who have non-missing values at 15 months will be analyzed.  Any subject who has an increase from baseline 
in HFMSE of 3 or more points at Month 15 will be defined as a responder; otherwise, he/she 
will be  considered a non-responder. 
Treatment groups will be compared using logistic regression adjusting for each subject’s age 
at screening and baseline score.

5.6.2  Proportion of subjects who achieve any new motor milestones at 15 months  
 
The WHO motor milestones are a set of six milestones in motor development, all of which would be expected to be attained by age 24 months in healthy children. The individual milestones are:  
 
• Sitting without support 
• Standing with assistance  
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
33 • Hands and knees crawling 
• Walking with assistance  
• Standing alone 
• Walking alone 
 
Per the study inclusion criterion number 5, subjects would be expected to all have achieved 
and maintained at baseline the milestone ‘Sitting without support’ but none would have 
achieved the milestone of ‘Walking alone’.  The motor milestones are assessed at seven stud y 
visits using the WHO motor milestone criteria [WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group 2006]. As part of the assessment, the examiner records an overall rating of the subject’s emotional state and then for each milestone one of the following four cl assifications:  
 
• No (inability) – Child tried but failed to perform the milestone    
• No (refusal) – Child refused to perform despite being calm and alert 
• Yes – Child was able to perform the milestone  
• Unable to test – Could not be tested because of irritability, drowsiness or sickness 
 
Imputation for motor milestones  
 If for a milestone either ‘No (refusal)’ or ‘Unable to test’ are observed at a visit then the result will be first set to missing. Imputation will be performed for missing data considering each  
milestone separately using the following rules for scheduled visits.  For baseline, the closest non- missing milestone prior to or at first dose will be selected.  If the 
motor milestone is still missing then the missing value will be imputed as the median  of the 
non-missing values of the stratum to which the subject belongs to: Age at screening < 6 years 
or Age at screening >= 6 years.   In the event that the median at baseline is 0.5 then then the 
missing value will be imputed as 1.   If, for the subject wi th a missing value  at a particular visit 
the corresponding visit is flanked by visits with non- missing milestones, the missing value 
will be imputed by using the worst result from the flanking visits.   Otherwise, if the imputation is the last visit, the missing value will be imputed as the lowest value observed across all subjects who have a non- missing value at this visit within the stratum: Age at 
screening < 6 years or Age at screening >= 6 years  within the treatment group . Of note, only 
observed data w ill be u tilized for imputation purposes and in a situation where unscheduled 
visit data is available these values will be utilized if these flank a missing visit.  Missing motor milestone items will be imputed first prior to any analysis.    
 
5.6.2.1  Final analysis  
Main analysis 
Treatment groups will be compared using logistic regression adjusting for each subject’s age 
at screening and baseline number of milestones.  Missing data will be handled as described in Section 5.6.2.  If a subject terminates the study prior to the 15-month assessment due treatment failure or death then  any imputed value will be ignored and the subject will be 
considered a non-responder. For the remaining subjects, the 15- month milestone data will be 
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
34 assessed and if the baseline milestones achieved are still maintained at Month 15 and the 
subject has achieved at least one new milestone, he/she will be considered a responder. 
 Should the number of responders be less than 5 in either group, Fisher’s exact test will be used instead. If Fisher’s  exact test is used, the unconditional confidence interval for the 
difference in response rates will be provided (Santner and Snell 1980). 
Sensitivity analysis  
Several sensitivity analyses will be performed.  In the first, the analysis described above will  
be performed on the PPS.  In the second, the analysis will be performed on the ITT Set and 
any subject who is missing all six milestone assessments at Month 15 will be considered a 
non-responder.  If 5 or fewer milestone assessments are missing at Month 15 then any missing 
individual milestones will be set to ‘Not (Inability)’ and for each subject the Month 15 
milestone data will then be assessed compared to baseline to determine response as in the 
main analysis.  In the third sensitivity analysis, performed on the ITT Set, any subject who is 
missing the Month 15 visit due to treatment failure or death  will be considered to be a non-
responder.  Any subject who is missing all Month 15 milestone assessments for any other 
reason will be excluded from the analy sis; otherwise, the analytical method will be the same 
as that for the previous analysis.  
In the fourth  sensitivity analysis, only the subset of subjects in the ITT Set who have non-
missing values for all six milestones at 15 months will be analyzed.   If  the baseline 
milestones achieved are still maintained at Month 15 and the subject has achieved at least one 
new milestone they will be considered as a responder.  Treatment groups will be compared 
using logistic regression adjusting for each subject’s age at screening and baseline score.       
Exploratory analysis 
 Several additional analyses will be performed on the ITT Set (without any imputation) to further explore the consistency in achievement and maintenance of motor milestones during the course of the study.  In the first analysis, the proportion of subjects who achieve at least one new milestone compared to baseline and then maintain this milestone at successive visits will be assessed.  In order to be assessed as a responder, subjects would need to have completed the study and the following will also apply: 
• Milestones achieved at baseline are maintained across all study visits  
• The visit at which a subject first achieves at least one new milestone will be 
considered.  At least one of any new milestones achieved at this visit will then need to be maintained at subsequent visits 
•  At least two successive visits are required.  Thus, the first new milestone will 
need to be achieved at the latest by Month 12 in order to allow confirmation at Month 15 
 In the second analysis, the proportion of subjects who achieve new milestones compared to 
baseline and maintain these milestones at successive visits will be assessed.  The definition will be similar to the first analysis but whenever a subject achieves any new  milestone , this 
milestone will need to be maintained to Month 15.  Having first achieved any new milestone 
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
35 compared to baseline, if a subject is unable to demonstrate maintenance of the milestone(s) at 
future visits , he/she will be defined as a non- respon der.  
The proportion of subjects defined as responders under each definition will be analyzed by 
logistic regression adjusting for the subject’s age at screening and baseline number of 
milestones.   In addition, for each of these analyses, the number of vi sits at which a subject 
was judged to maintain the milestone as a responder will be summarized using counts and 
percentages. In this summary, non-responders will be presented as zero and 2, 3, 4 and 5 will 
be possible counts for responders.

5.6.3  Number of new motor milestones achieved per subject at 15 months  
5.6.3.1  Final analysis  
Main analysis  
The main analysis is to comp are the total number of new motor milestones achieved at 15 
months between the two treatment groups, based on the ITT Set.  Missing data will be handled as described in Section 5.6.2. and a total score for each visit calculated by summing 
the six milestone s.   
For each milestone the Month 15 and baseline values will be compared and if the subject can 
achieve a new milestone compared to baseline then it will be counted +1, if the subject is 
unable to achieve the milestone then it will be scored -1 and if the milestone has been 
maintained then it will be scored 0.   These scores will then be summed to give a total score 
which could range between - 6 (if a subject was able to perform all milestones at baseline but 
lost the ability and could not perform any milestones at Month 15) and + 6 (if a subject was unable to achieve any milestones at baseline but could achieve all at Month 15). 
The total number of new milestones achieved by each subject at Month 15 will be compared 
between treatment groups by analysis of co variance with treatment group as the factor and 
subject age at screening and baseline number of milestones as covariates.  
Sensitivity analysis  
Three sensitivity analyses will be performed.  In the first, the analysis described above will be 
performed on th e PPS.   In the second, the same analysis will be repeated in the ITT, with an 
exception to assign the worst of last available observation and zero (0) new motor milestones 
achieved for subjects who terminate the study prior to the 15-month assessment the study 
prior to the 15-month assessment.  In the third sensitivity analysis, only the subset of subjects in the ITT Set who have non- missing values for all six milestones at 15 months will be 
analyzed.

5.6.4  Change from baseline in Upper Limb Module Test at 15 months  
 
The upper limb module test (Mazzone et al. 2011) referenced in the protocol was developed 
to assess the upper limb functional abilities in SMA patients using 9 items. However, a revised version of the upper limb module test developed by the Upper Limb Module Working 
Group will be performed in this study consisting of 20 items. The first item is assessed on a 
seven point scale ranging from 0 - ‘No useful function’ to 6 – ‘Can abduct both arms simultaneously elbows in extension in a full circle until they touch above the head’. This first 
item will not contribute to the total score. The remaining 19 items are assessed on a three 
point scale using the following criteria: 0 - Unable to achieve independently; 1 - Modified 
method but achieves goal independent of physical assistance from another person; 2 - Normal 
– achieves goal without any assistance. For each item, a score will be collected on the left and 
right side. A derived total score will be calculated by summing the scores from these 19 individual items and ranges from 0 i f the subject fails all activities to 38 if the subject 
achieves all activities. If, for an individual item, a response is recorded for both the left and right side the highest score will be used in calculating the total. If 3 or fewer items are still 
missing responses then it will be assumed that the score was 0.  If greater than 3 items are 
missing, then the total score will be set to be missing.

38 5.6.4.1  Final analysis  
Main analysis 
The main analysis is to compare the change from baseline upper limb module test  total score 
at 15 months between the two treatment groups based on the ITT Set.  The method of multiple 
imputation will be used as described for the HFMSE. The change will be compared between treatment groups by analysis of covariance with treatment group  as the factor and subject age 
at screening and baseline value as covariates .  
Sensitivity analysis  
Four sensitivity analyses will be performed.  In the first, the analysis described above will be performed on the PPS.  In the second, the analysis will be performed using a Mixed Effects 
Model with Repeated Measures (MMRM) with an unstructured covariance matrix, where the treatment group, time (as a categorical covariate), treatment by time interaction, and patient age at screening will be included in the model as fixed effects; patient will be a random effect; 
baseline upper limb score and baseline upper limb score by time interaction will be included 
as a covariate. No imputation for missing visit data will be performed and the analysis will be performed on the ITT Set.  In the third, the main analysis will be repeated but for subjects 
who terminate the study prior to the 15-month assessment due to treatment failure or death , 
the worst of the last observed value or the baseline value will be imputed.    In the fourth 
sensitivity analysis, only the subset of subjects in the ITT Set who have non- missing values at 
15 months will be analyzed.  For both of these treatment groups will be compared by analysis of covariance.

Main analysis 
The main analysis will be performed on the ITT Set and m issing  data will be imputed as 
described in Section 5.6.2 .  If, a subject terminates the study prior to the 15 -month assessment 
due to treatment failure or death  then any imputed value will be ignored and the subject will 
be considered as a non-responder.  For t he remaining subjects, if the subject was unable to 
achieve standing alone at baseline but could achieve this at Month 15 then they will be 
considered a responder.  Treatment groups will be compared using logistic regression 
adjusting for each subject’s age at screening and baseline ability to stand alone.  
Sensitivity analysis  
Four sensitivity analyses will be performed.  In the first, the analysis described above will be performed on the PPS.  In the second, performed on the ITT Set without any imputation, any 
subject who has no assessment of standing alone at Month 15 will be considered as a non-responder; otherwise the analytical method is the same as that for the main analysis.   
In the third sensitivity analysis, performed on the ITT Set, any subject w ho is missing the 
Month 15 assessment due to treatment failure or death  will be considered to be a non-
responder.  Any subject who is missing the Month 15 assessment for any other reason will be 
excluded from the analysis ; otherwise the analytical method will be the same as that for the 
main analysis.  In the fourth sensitivity analysis, only the subset of subjects in the ITT Set 
who have non-missing values for standing alone at 15 months will be analyzed.

41 5.6.7  Interim  Analysis 
 
No testing of the secondary endpoints will be performed at the interim but summary statistics for each measure may be provided as follows.  For the HFMSE and upper limb endpoints the multiple imputation approach will be used as described in the main analysis, based on the ITT Set.  For the endpoints evaluating WHO motor milestones, the analysis will be performed as described but based on the IES.  To further explore the response in the cohort of subjects in the IES for the HFMSE and upper limb endpoint the main analysis will be repeated .  In these 
analyses if M onth 15 is missing then the median of the MI values will be imputed.  For 
HFMSE if the reason for the missing Month 15 value is treatment failure or death then they would be set to be a non-responder and this would override any imputation.    
As an explora tory analysis for the WHO milestones  the main analysis will be conducted based 
on data from Month 6, Month 9 and Month 12, separately. Specifically, let X denote Month 6, Month 9, or Month 12. The evaluable set at the interim analysis for the Day X visit is defined as the subset of subjects in the ITT Set who have the opportunity to be assessed at the Day X visit. Specifically, it will include all subjects with Day X visit and all subjects with time difference of at least X+7 days between the date of first dose and the targeted clinical cut -off 
date of Aug 31, 2016 for the interim analysis. However, a subject who has died or withdrawn 
will be included provided that there is a time difference of at least X -7 days between the date 
of first dose and the targete d clinical cut -off date of Aug 31, 2016 for the interim analysis.  
 In a situation where an interim analysis is performed and a subject is in the evaluable set for a summary of WHO milestones but has missing data at this visit then this will be imputed using the rules in Section 5.6.2 up to the last visit at which a subject qualifies for inclusion in an evaluable set.  So a subject who is in the Month 12 evaluable set but not the IES and has a 
missing value at Month 12 then this will be imputed but a Month 15 value will not be imputed.  In the event of a successful interim and subjects rolling over early to open label treatment, for the early final analysis the secondary endpoints will be evaluated as described for interim and evaluable set s for Month 6, Month 9, and Month 12 visits will be similarly defined as subsets 
of the ITT Set . 
 
5.6.8  Exploratory analysis  
 
For each secondary endpoint in order to further explore the change over time, the change from 
baseline to each visit or the proportion responding in each group at each visit will be analyzed as described in the main analysis for the final analysis.  Summaries will be provided by 
treatment group.   
The following displays may be presented by visit using observed data with no imputations for 
missing total scor es: 
• Thresholds of response in HFMSE, frequency and percentage 
• Change in total motor milestones  
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
42 • Change in upper limb score   
Graphical representations to show each individuals response and Forest plots to summarize 
the primary endpoint and corresponding sensitivity analyses may also be presented.  
Analyses will be conducted on the ITT Set and PPS.

5.7.1  Change from baseline in CSF SMN protein concentration  
CSF SMN protein is collected pre-dose from subjects randomized to ISIS 396443 on Day 1 (the baseline assessment) and pre-dose on Days 29, 85 and 274.   
The change and percentage change from baseline CSF will be presented by visit for subjects 
randomized to ISIS 396443.  A plot of the mean and percentage change from baseline over 
time will be pr esented.  
Scatter plots of change from baseline in HFMSE versus change from baseline in CSF SMN 
protein and corresponding Pearson’ s correlation coefficient will be presented by visit.  
Analyses will be conducted on the ITT Set and PPS.   
5.7.2  Clinical  Global Im pression of Change (Investigator and Caregiver assessments) 
The Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI) is assessed at five visits post first dose on Days 92, 169, 274, 365 and 456.  At each visit the investigator and the subject’s caregiver 
each score how the subject has changed compared to ‘admission to the project’.  The 
assessment is scored on a 7 - point ordinal scale (1= Very much improved, 2 = “Much 
improved”, 3 =”Minimally improved”, 4= “No change”, 5= “Minimally worse”, 6= “Much worse”, 7 = “Very  much worse”).  
In order to investigate response on these scales, three definitions of responder will be defined:  
“Much improved”: Responder (<=2) versus Non-responder (>=3), “Any improvement”: 
Responder (<=3) versus Non-responder (>=4), “No worsening”: Responder (<=4) versus Non-responder (>=5).   
Main analysis 
The proportion of subjects who were responders  based on the “Much improved” definition of 
responder will be presented by visit. 
Exploratory analyses 
The main analysis will be repeated for the two alternative responder definitions of ‘Any 
improvement’ and ‘No worsening’.   
Agreement between investigator and caregiver  
The agreement in assessment between the investigator and the caregiver will be examined.  
For each visit the proportion of assessments which agree (have the same assessed value) will 
be presented.  In addition, at each visit the weighted Kappa coefficient will be calculated.  No 
statistical significance testing will be performed but the coefficient will be interpreted in line with the ra nges suggested by Landis and Koch (1977) for strength of agreement.   
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
43 The analyses will be presented by treatment group and overall for the ITT Set .  
Exploring the relationship between CGI and HFMSE 
The change in HFMSE from baseline for CGI responders/non-responder defined using the 
‘Much improved’ definition will be presented by treatment group, overall and by visit for both the investigator and caregiver assessment.  A similar analysis will also be performed 
presenting the proportion of subjects who achieve at least 2, 3 and 4 points improvement in 
HFMSE for CGI responder/non-responder by treatment group, overall and by visit for the ITT Set. 
5.7.3  Change from baseline in Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory  
Subjects will be evaluated using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL™) 
Measurement 4.0 Generic Core Scales and 3.0 Neuromuscular Module (Varni et al. 1999) at screening (the baseline assessment) and on Days 92, 169, 274, 365 and 456.  
The questionnaires are specific to the age of the subject, and s ites are instructed to get both 
subjects and caregivers to complete the same age specific questionnaire as was collected at 
baseline irrespective of whether or not the subjects cross an age boundary at a subsequent 
visit.   
The PedsQL parent questionnaire is collected for children in the following age categories: 2 -
4, 5-7, 8-12 and 13-18 years.  Four dimensions are collected: Physical, Emotional, Social and 
School functioning and each item is scored on a 5 point ordinal scale (0= Never, 1 = Almost 
Never, 2= Sometimes, 3 = Often, 4 = Almost Always).  The PedsQL patient questionnaire is collected for children in the following categories: 5 -7, 8-12 and 13-18.  Similar dimensions 
and 5-point ordinal scale are used as for the parents but for subjects aged 5 to 7 years a 3 -
point ordinal scale is collected, omitting the response levels of 1 and 3.   
In the neuromuscular module, one parent questionnaire is collected for all subjects 
irrespective of age with three dimensions: ‘About my child’s neuromuscular disease’, 
Communication’ and ‘Family resources’.  The same 5- point ordinal scale is collected for each 
question.  The patient neuromuscular disease questionnaire is collected for subjects in the 
following age categories: 5-7, 8-12, 13 -18. The questionnaire for subj ects aged 5 -7 years uses 
the 3 -point ordinal scale as above and has only one dimension - ‘About my Neuromuscular 
disease’.  The questionnaires for the remaining two age categories cover dimensions for ‘Communication’ and ‘Family resources’ and use the 5-point ordinal scale.   
In scoring a dimension the first step is to reverse and linearly transform to a 0- 100 scale (0 = 
100, 1 =75, 2=50, 3= 25, 4= 0), so a higher score is indicative of a better health related quality 
of life.  If greater than 50 percent of  the items within a dimension are missing then the 
dimension score will not be computed, otherwise the mean score for the dimension will be 
calculated as the sum of items over the number of items answered.  
A psychosocial health summary score, constructed f rom three dimensions, will be calculated 
as the sum of items over the number of items answered in the emotional, social and school functioning scales. A total score will be calculated as the sum of all the items over the number 
of items answered on all the scales.  If greater than 50 percent of the items are missing, then 
the summary score or total score will be set to be missing.   
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
44 For the neuromuscular module, a score for each dimension and then total score will be 
calculated in the same manner, no health  summary scores are evaluated.   
For the generic PedsQL and neuromuscular module, the change and percentage change from 
baseline in the total score will be presented by visit and treatment group for both the parent and subject assessments.  Similarly, the changes in the individual dimensions and health 
summary score will also be presented.   
The change and percentage change from baseline score (each total score and parent/subject evaluation separately) to each visit will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model wi th treatment 
group as a factor and age at screening and baseline score as covariates.  A statistical test for a 
treatment effect will be performed at Days 92, 169, 274, 365 and 456.  
Multiple imputation as described in Section 5.3 will be used to impute missing post baseline 
values.  The imputation will be performed separately for each dimension and total and 
psychosocial summary scores.   Due to the age specific nature of these questionnaires, subjects aged 2 -4 years would not be expected to complete the s elf-evaluation and if this is 
the case then imputations will not be performed and the subjects will be excluded from the analysis.  
A plot of mean change from baseline (each questionnaire and parent/subject separately) based 
on the estimates from the ANCOVA  model over time will be provided by treatment group.   
Analyses will be conducted on the ITT Set and PPS. 
5.7.4  Change from baseline in Assessment of Caregiver Experience with Neuromuscular 
Disease  
Parents of subjects will complete the Assessment of Caregiver E xperience with 
Neuromuscular Disease (ACEND) questionnaire at screening and on Days 169 and 456.   This 
assessment instrument has been designed to quantify the caregiver impact experienced by 
parents of children affected with severe neuromuscular diseases,  including children with SMA 
(Matsumoto et al. 2011).  
The ACEND includes a total of seven domains assessing physical impact (including 
feeding/grooming/dressing, sitting/play, transfers, and mobility) and general caregiver impact 
(including time, emotion,  and finance) and each domain comprises several items.  The total 
score for a domain with n items, each item assessed on ordinal scale from 1 to z , is derived as 
follows: 100 multiplied by (Mean of the n items in the domain -1) divided by ( z-1).  This tota l 
score will be on a scale of 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating a greater impact on the caregiver.  At least two items for the time domain and one item for the remaining domains 
need to be non- missing for a total to be calculated; else the total score will be set to be 
missing.  
The change and percentage change from baseline for each domain will be presented by visit and treatment group.  An ANCOVA model will be used to analyze the change and percentage 
change from baseline through to 15 months with mi ssing data handled by multiple imputation 
as was described for PedsQL. Similarly, plots of the mean and percentage change from 
baseline over time, based on the ANCOVA model will be provided by treatment group.  
Analyses will be conducted on the ITT Set and PPS.  
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
45 5.7.5  Disease- related hospitalizations and adverse events 
A blinded medical review of the adverse events will be conducted in order to define those 
events which would be considered disease related.   The adverse event page in the CRF 
captures if an event is  serious and one of the criteria of a serious event is if inpatient 
hospitalization required or hospitalization is prolonged. 
The number of disease related adverse events, and as a separate analysis the subset of these 
events which required hospitalization will be analyzed using the rate at which they occur.   
For descriptive purposes, the aggregate rate will be calculated for each treatment group by 
dividing the total number of events that occurred in a group by the total number of subject-
years on study.   
Annualized event rate will be calculated for each subject as the number of events that the 
subject experienced divided by the number of days on study and this ratio multiplied by 365. 
Although disease related adverse events occur as a stochastic process,  and can be assumed to 
be from a Poisson distribution, studies in other therapeutic areas have shown that data of this 
type are typically over -dispersed, i.e., the variation seen is greater than that predicted by the 
Poisson model.  To account for over-dispersion in the annualized rate of events, the negative binomial distribution will be used.  Thus, on the basis of event rate, treatment groups will be compared using a negative binomial model adjusting for the stratification factor, age at 
screening.  An “offset” parameter, the logarithm of the time on study, will be included in the 
model.  If the data are underdispersed, or if the negative binomial regression model does not converge, a Poisson regression model with the same covariate will be used instead of the 
negative binomial regression model.  Dispersion will be evaluated from the Pearson chi-
squared statistic.    
Analyses will be performed on the ITT Set and PPS.  
5.8 Subgroup analyses  
 
The main analysis for the primary endpoint and each secondary endpoint will be presented for the following subgroups: 
• geographic region (North America, Europe and Asia- Pacific).   
• below and above the stratification factor used in the randomization (Age at 
screening < 6 years versus >=6 years)  
• Disease duration (time from SMA onset to Screening  in months ) by tertiles  
 
The difference between treatments for continuous endpoints and the proportion of responders in each treatment group and the odds ratio for the binary endpoints will be presented. 
If the number of subjects in a subgroup is too small (e.g., < 15% of total number of subjects in 
the ITT population), the analysis in that subgroup may not be performed.  In the event an interim analysis is performed then  subgroup analyses will be performed but the number of 
subjects with a Month 15 value within a  subgroup will be assessed and if <40% of subjects 
have a Month 15 value then these may not be presented .  No statistical tests will be performed 
in the subgroups.  
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
46 It is anticipated that 8 subjects will be enrolled in Japan and a separate set of tables and listing 
will be presented for Japanese subjects.  
 
5.9 Unblinding Plan for the Interim Analysis  
 
The interim analysis will be performed by a contract research organization (Parexel) and reviewed by an independent Data and Safety Moni toring Board (DSMB) overseeing the study 
and an Unblinded Senior Management Team from the sponsor.  The DSMB, in accordance with its Charter, will make a recommendation to the study Sponsor on whether or not the study should continue according to the protocol or any modifications are needed based on the emerging benefit/risk profile.  
 After the review of the interim analysis results the Unblinded Senior Management Team will decide whether or not to proceed with regulatory submissions.  This decision will be based on totality of the data including the overall consistency of the data and the benefit/risk assessment.  If the Unblinded Senior Management Team decides to continue the study without regulatory submission, no additional personnel from the Sponsor will be unblinded to the interim data.  Should the Unblinded Senior Management Team decide to proceed with regulatory submissions, an internal filing team will be unblinded to the interim data.  The internal filing team will prepare and submit the marketing a pplications to the regulators.  
Members of both the Unblinded Senior Management Team and the internal filing team will not be involved with study management or operations after being unblinded to the interim data.  All internal individuals who had access to the unblinded interim data will no longer be involved in the conduct of the blinded study.

6 Safety data  
Analyses of safety data will include adverse events and serious adverse events ( Section 6.1), 
laboratory data ( Section 6.2), ECGs (Section 6.3), vita l signs ( Section 6.4), and neurological 
examinations ( Section 6.5).   Any worsening or new findings noted from the physical 
examinations will be reported as AEs.  
Analyses of safety data will be based on the Safety Set.  Baseline is defined as the last non -
missing result prior to the first dose of ISIS 396443 or the first sham procedure.  
6.1 Clinical adverse events  
All adverse events (AEs) will be analyzed based on the principle of treatment emergence.  An 
adverse event will be regarded as treatment -emergent if it was present prior to receiving the 
first dose of ISIS 396443 or first sham procedure and subsequently worsened in severity, or was not present prior to receiving the first dose of ISIS 396443 or first sham procedure but subsequently appeared.   
In the situation where change in severity (but no change in seriousness) occurs for an adverse 
event, study sites are instructed to enter an end date and start a new record for the adverse event. In the new record, the changed severity is to be recorded and the st art date will be set to 
be the end date of the previous record. Data linking those records are collected in the data base. Consider three scenarios:  
 
• The first AE record occurs prior to the first dose, the second AE record occurs on or 
after the first dose , and the severity increases: Only the second record will be counted 
as treatment -emergent.  
• The first AE record occurs prior to the first dose, the second AE record occurs on or after the first dose, and the severity decreases: Neither record will be counted as 
treatment -emergent.  
• Both records occur on or after the first dose: If the AE severity on the second record is 
worse than the severity on the first record, then count both records as treatment-
emergent.   But, if the severity improves, then only count the first record as treatment -
emergent.  
Of note, when counting the total number of treatment-emergent events, events linked through change in severity will still be counted as separate events.  
For events with missing start or stop dates, the following criteria will be used for the purpose of identifying treatment- emergent adverse events:  
• if both the start and stop dates for a particular event are missing, then the event is considered to have occurred on or after the first dose or sham procedure; 
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
48 • if the start date for a particular event is missing and the stop date/time falls after the 
first dose or first sham procedure date/time, then the event is considered to have 
occurred on or after the first dose or sham procedure; 
• if the start time is missing and the start date is same as the first dosing or first sham 
procedure date, then the event is considered to have occurred on or after the first dose 
or sham procedure. 
• If it cannot be determined whether or not an event has occurred on or after dosing due 
to a miss ing or partial date, then the event will be assumed to have occurred on or after 
the first dose for the purpose of identifying treatment- emergent adverse events.  
Specifically, let AESTDT denote the start date of an adverse event and TRTSTDT be the start 
date of treatment/sham procedure. For the purpose of identifying treatment emergent adverse 
events, the following algorithm will be used for the imputation of missing or partial date:  
• If AESTDT is completely missing or the year is missing, then impute AESTDT  to 
TRTSTDT.  
• If, in AESTDT, year is present and month/day are missing and year is equal to the 
year portion of TRTSTDT, then impute the month/day portion of AESTDT to the 
month/day portion of TRTSTDT. 
• If, in AESTDT, year is present and month/day are missing and year is not equal to the 
year portion of TRTSTDT, then impute the month/day portion of AESTDT to January 
01. 
• Consider the situation in AESTDT where year and month are present with only day 
missing. If the year and month are the same as those for TRTSTDT, then impute day 
in AESTDT with day in TRTSTDT. Otherwise, impute the day in AESTDT with the first day of the month. 
It is important to emphasize that the imputed date will not be used for calculations such as onset and duration of an adverse event.  
Due to the long half-life of ISIS 396443, analyses of treatment- emergent adverse events will 
include all events reported during the study. Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary.  This coding system provides 
more than five levels to classify adverse events.  In general, adverse events will be presented by system organ class and preferred terms but other classifications may be used if warranted.   
The incidence of treatment- emergent adverse events will be summarized by treatment group 
and overall.  A subject having the same adverse event more than once will be counted only 
once in the incidence for that adverse event.  The summary tables will include incidence estimates for overall system organ class as well as for preferred terms within each  system 
organ class.  Incidence will be presented by decreasing order by system organ class and by decreasing order by preferred term within each system organ class.  The most common 
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
49 adverse events, i.e., those that occurred in at least 5% of subjects in either treatment group, 
will be presented.  In addition, adverse events that occurred with an incidence 5% or higher in 
the ISIS  396443 group than in the control group will be presented.  Upon examination of the 
actual data, different cut -offs may be used i f it is deemed more appropriate.   
6.1.1  Adverse events over time  
The incidence of AEs will be evaluated by time of onset by 90- day time intervals.  For a given 
time interval, the number of subjects who were followed for adverse events during that time 
interval w ill be presented along with the incidence of adverse events during that time interval.  
Therefore, for a given System Organ Class (SOC) or preferred term (PT), subjects will be 
counted only once for a given time interval but may be counted once across time intervals.  
The incidence of AEs will also be evaluated by treatment phase (loading phase: Day 1 to Day 
272, maintenance phase: Day 273 and beyond) using the same methodology as described above.  For classifying adverse events into different time intervals , the algorithm in Section 6.1 for 
the imputation of missing or partial start dates will be used.  
 
6.1.2  Adverse events by severity 
The investigator is to record the severity of each adverse event as mild, moderate, or severe.  
If a subject experiences the same adverse event multiple times, the event with the worst 
severity will be counted.  For each treatment group, the incidence within each category will be presented.  The incidence of severe events will be summarized by treatment group.  
6.1.3  Adverse events by rel ationship to study treatment 
The investigator is to record the degree to which each adverse event is related to study drug (not related, unlikely or remotely related, possibly related, and related).  If a subject 
experiences the same adverse event multiple times, the event with the strongest relationship to 
study drug will be counted.  For each treatment group, the incidence within each category will be presented.  The incidence of drug- related  events (those categorized as possibly related or 
related) will be summarized by treatment group.   
6.1.4  Serious adverse events  
The incidence of treatment- emergent serious adverse events will be summarized by treatment 
group.  All serious adverse events will be listed including any that occurred prior to 
commencement of study treatment.  Similar tables will be generated for adverse events that 
led to discontinuation of study treatment and those that led to withdrawal from the study.  
6.1.5  Deaths  
All adverse events which led to death will be listed.  
6.1.6  Adverse events following dosing /sham procedure  
To examine the onset of any adverse events following dosing or the sham procedure the incidence of events that occur 0 -6 hours, 6-24 hours, and 24-72 hours following dosing or 
sham procedure will be presented by treatment group.  In addition, presentations of events 
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
50 that occurred in the first 24 hours and the first 72 hours following dosing or sham procedure 
will be provided.   
AEs potentially related to LP occurring within 7 days of dosing, such as the PTs headache and 
back pain will be summarized.    For identifying adverse events following dosing or the sham procedure, the algorithm in Section 6.1 for the imputation of missing or partial start dates will be used. If time is missing and the event occurs on the same day as the day for dosing/sham procedure, the time for the dosing/sham procedure will be used as the imputed time.  
6.1.7  Adverse events by anti -ISIS 396443 antibody status  
To determine the impact of the formation of anti-ISIS 396443 antibodies on the safety of ISIS 
396443, the incidence of adverse events in those ‘persistently’ positive, ‘transiently’ positive, 
and antibody negative will be presented.  The definition of persistence is given in Section 8 .  
6.1.8  Adverse Events Related to SMA  
The analysis of disease related events in Section 5. 7.5 will present the overall incidence of 
events.  To further explore the nature of these events the following categories of event will be presented.   A blinded medical review prior to database lock will be conducted to ensure these 
proposed groupings are appropriate. 
• Respiratory events: events that are coded into the SOC of respiratory, thoracic, 
and mediastinal disorders, either as their primary SOC or their secondary SOC  
• Symptoms of gastric reflux: events identified by standardized MedDRA query 
(SMQ) fo r gastrointestinal nonspecific inflammations  
• Athralgia and other issues related to joints: events identified by SMQ for 
arthritis to initially identify terms.  The final set of terms will be refined by the 
medical review  
• Scoliosis: events identified by the  PT Scoliosis  
• Contractures:  events identified using the PTs: Extremity contractures, joint 
contracture, muscle contracture and tendinous contracture 
6.1.9  Presentations  
The following presentations will be shown:  
• an overall summary showing, for each treatment group, the number and percentage of 
subjects with an adverse event, a moderate or severe event, a severe event, a possibly 
or related event, a related event, a serious event, an event that led to discontinuation of study drug, and an event that led to withdrawal from the study  
• incidence by primary system organ class and preferred term  
• incidence, by preferred term, in at least 5% of subjects in either treatment group  
• incidence, by preferred term, of adverse events that occur with an incidence 5% or 
higher in any treated group (upon examining the actual data, different cut-off points 
may be used to examine the incidence of these adverse events if it is deemed more appropriate) 
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
51 • incidence of mild, moderate and severe events by primary system organ class and 
preferred term   
• incidence of severe events by primary system organ class and preferred term  
• incidence of not related, unlikely to be related, possibly related, and related events by primary system organ class and preferred term  
• incidence of drug -related events by primary system organ class and preferred term   
• incidence of serious adverse events by primary system organ class and preferred term and a listing of serious adverse events 
• incidence of death and a listing of each death  
• incidence of events leading to discontinuation of study drug by primary system organ class and preferred term and a listing of such events  
• incidence of events leading to withdrawal from the study by primary system organ class and preferred term and a listing of such events 
• incidence of  adverse events  determined as  following dosing/sham, by antibody status 
and events related to SMA  (each category presented separately) by primary system 
organ class and preferred term and a listing of such events. 
To avoid the potential for misleading int erpretation of analysis of adverse events, no statistical 
testing will be performed.   
6.2 Clinical laboratory data 
Blood is to be drawn and urine collected for laboratory analysis at screening, and on Day 1 
(pre-dose), 2, 29, 85, 169, 274 and 456.  The followi ng clinical laboratory parameters are to 
be assessed:   
• Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, WBC count with 
differential both as absolute values and as a percentage (neutrophils, eosinophils, 
basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes), and platelet count.   
• Blood chemistry: liver function (total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT/SGPT, 
AST/SGOT,) kidney function and electrolytes (BUN, creatinine, sodium, potassium, 
chloride), total protein, albumin, calcium, phosphorous, bicarbonate, glucose, cystatin 
C, and CPK.  
• Urinalysis: specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, blood, RBC, 
WBC, epithelial cells, bacteria, casts, and crystals.   
As described below, laboratory data will be examined using an analysis of “shifts”. However  
further analyses may be undertaken to more fully characterize potential laboratory safety 
signals, such as assessment of timing, recovery, reversibility, association with adverse events, 
etc.  
In the second approach, each subject’s laboratory values will be classified according to 
whether the test result is “low” (i.e., below the lower limit of normal [LLN]), “normal” 
(within the normal range), or “high” (i.e., above the upper limit of normal [ULN]).  If a 
subject is missing a baseline value but had a post- baseline value, then the baseline assessment 
is labeled as “unknown”.  Likewise, if a subject had a baseline value but had no post- baseline 
values, then the minimum and maximum are labeled as “unknown”.  Post- baseline laboratory 
results are defined as any  assessment taken after the first dose, including data collected from 
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
52 local laboratories.  The shifts (relative to the normal range) from baseline to the minimum and 
maximum post- baseline values will be presented.  Should a treatment affect a laboratory 
parameter, that parameter could be affected at different times for different subjects.  
Therefore, these analyses present the most extreme values for each subject.  For many laboratory parameters, the effect could be in either direction, (i.e., an increase or a decrease), 
so both the maximum and minimum values have been analyzed.  From these, the shifts 
(relative to the normal range) from baseline to low and high will be calculated.  If a subject's value shifts, it can change from normal to either low or high, from low to normal or high, 
from high to normal or low, or from unknown to low, normal, or high.  For each parameter, 
the incidence of shift to low will be summarized using the minimum post- baseline values.  
Shift to low includes subjects with a normal, high, or unknown baseline value and at least one 
post- baseline value of the given test.  Similarly, the incidence of shift to high will be 
summarized using the maximum post-baseline values.  Shift to high includes subjects with a 
low, normal, or unknown baseline value and at least one post- baseline value.   All blood and 
urine samples will be used in the shift analyses.  
Blood and urine samples for laboratory analysis are to be processed at a central laboratory.  
For many parameters, the laboratory has addit ional ranges, e.g., a notification to the site by 
telefacsimile that the subject’s result is outside the normal range significantly enough to warrant notification, and/or a panic alert involving a telephone call made to the investigational site to notify them that the subject’s result is outside of the normal range with potentially critical implications for the subject (see the table below).  For shift tables of lab parameters, those additional categories will be combined with the conventional categories. S pecifically,  
• LT (Low – telefacsimile) and LP (Low panic) will be classified as L (Lower limit of 
normal) 
• HT (How – telefacsimile) and HP (How panic) will be classified as H (Upper limit of 
normal) 
For liver function tests, additional categories will be def ined to present the baseline and post-
baseline values as within the upper limit of normal,   >1-<3 x ULN, ≥3-<5 x ULN, ≥ 5-<10 x 
ULN, ≥ 10 - <20 x ULN, >=20 x ULN for ALT/AST, >1 -<2 x ULN, ≥ 2 x ULN for total 
bilirubin, and >1-1.5 x ULN and ≥  1.5 x ULN for alkaline phosphatase.

6.3 ECGs  
ECGs are to be recorded  at screening, and on Days 2, 29, 92 and 456 and will be quantified 
prior to the final database lock at a central reading laboratory.  ECG qualitative results include 
an overall interpretation of ‘normal’, ‘abnormal but not clinically significant’ or ‘abnormal 
and clinically significant’.  ECG quantitative parameters include heart rate, PR interval, QRS 
duration, uncorrected QT interval, and corrected QT interval.   
ECGs will be analyzed using two approaches.    
6.3.1  Qualitative analysis  
Incidence tables will summarize both the number and percentage of subjects with an abnormal, clinically relevant baseline ECG and the number and percentage of subjects with 
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
54 abnormal, clinically relevant worsening, defined as a post- baseline ECG interpreted as 
abnormal and clinically relevant, with a comparison with baseline value of deteriorated, not 
available, not required, or missing.  The incidence of clinically relevant worsening will be 
summarized at any time post-baseline and by visit post-baseline.  In addition, a summary of abnormality types and findings within abnormality types will be provided for subjects with an 
abnormal, clinically relevant baseline ECG and for subjects with abnormal, clinically relevant 
worsening.  
6.3.2  ECG outliers  
Outlier analyses will be performed for the corrected Fridericia QT interval.  This will include 
summaries of the number and percentage of subjects with a post- baseline corrected Q T 
interval greater than certain threshold values (e.g., >450 msec, >480 msec, and >500 msec) 
and the number and percentage of subjects with an increase from baseline in corrected QT 
interval in various categories (e.g., >30 msec and >60 msec).  These summaries will be 
performed on an overall basis, as well as separately for subjects whose baseline corrected Q T 
intervals a re normal ( ≤ 450 msec) and elevated (>450 msec).   
6.4 Vital signs  
Vital signs are to be measured at screening, pre-dosing and at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 20-24 hours post-
dosing on dosing days (Days 1, 29, 85 and 274).  Additionally, assessments are made on Days 
92, 169, 365 and 456.  At each of these times, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be measured.  
If multiple evaluations are on the same visit day and visit time, then the mean of these 
evaluations will be selected for inclusion in the analysis. 
The analysis of vital signs will be approached in two ways. 
6.4.1  Acute effects after dosing  
On each dosing day, the change in each vital sign from pre-dosing on that day to post-dosing 
(i.e., from pre-dosing to 1 hour post-dosing, to 2 hours post-dosing, etc.) will be calculated.  Summaries of actual values and change from pre-dosing for each dosing day will be 
presented.   
6.4.2  Chronic effects  
To examine for possible chronic effects, the change from baseline (the pre-dosing value on 
Day 1) to the pre-dosing value on later dosing days and to Days 92, 169, 365 and 456 will be 
determined.  Summaries of actual values and change from baseline to each of these time 
points will be presented.  
6.5 Neurological examinations 
Neurological examinations include  assessment of mental status, level of consciousness, 
cranial nerves, reflexes, motor system, coordination/cerebellar function and sensation – 
temperature and vibration. These are to be assessed at screening, pre-dosing and at 5 and 20-
24 hours post-dosing on dosing days (Days 1, 29, 85 and 274) and on Day  92,169, 365 and 456.  
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
55 The result collected for the majority of the tests is ‘normal’ or ‘abnormal’, however the 
assessment of sensations is reported as ‘present’ or ‘absent’ and the assessment of reflexes is 
captured on an ordinal scale.  For each test it is recorded if secondary to SMA.  
6.5.1  Acute effects after dosing  
On each dosing day, the shifts from pre-dosing assessment on that day to post-dosing (i.e., 
from pre -dosing to 5 hours post-dosing, to 24 hours post-dosing) will be determined.   
For each test and post dosing time point, the number and proportion of subjects who moved from ‘Normal’ to ‘Abnormal’ will be presented, for sensations the number and proportion who move from ‘Present’ to ‘Absent’ will be presented.  For the assessment of reflexes 
decreases (from pre -dosing 1 to post doing 0, 2 to1 etc) will be presented.  Only changes not 
deemed secondary to SMA will be presented. 
6.5.2  Chronic effects  
To examine for possible chronic effects, changes from bas eline (the pre-dosing value on Day 
1) to the pre-dosing value on later dosing days and to Day 92, 169, 365 and 456 will be 
determined.  Summaries will be presented in a similar manner to that described for the acute 
effects.   
6.6 Interim safety analyses  
Safety  data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the Sponsor and the Medical Monitor.  
Safety data will also be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the independent DSMB.  The DSMB 
will be assembled to review safety, tolerability and efficacy data collected on ISI S 396443 
during this study and to review the results of the predetermined interim efficacy analysis (Section 5.1).  Based on its ongoing assessment of the safety and tolerability of ISIS 396443, the DSMB will provide recommendations to the Sponsor for modifying, stopping or 
continuing the study as planned.  
Details on the safety assessments, frequency of review, meeting schedules and controlled 
access to unblinded data at the interim safety analyses are outlined in the DSMB Charter.   
 7 Pharmacokinetic data 
CSF and Plasma samples will be collected at protocol designated times for ISIS 396443 pharmacokinetic assessments from both treatment groups in the Pharmacokinetic Population. The Pharmacokinetic Population includes all subjects who are randomized and for which 
there is at least one evaluable post -dose/post-sham procedure pharmacokinetic sample.  
7.1 CSF Concentration Data 
CSF concentrations of ISIS 396443, along with the scheduled (nominal) and actual sampling 
times (i.e., time from IT dosing) will be listed (w hen applicable) for each patient, and day.  
Differences between scheduled and actual sampling days will also be listed for all patients.  
Percent differences between actual administered dose and nominal dose will also be listed.   
CSF concentrations below t he lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) will be indicated by 
“BLQ”.  For the purpose of calculating typical descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, %CV, geometric mean, geometric %CV, median, minimum, and maximum) for CSF concentrations, 
all BLQ values will b e set to zero.  Mean CSF concentrations that are BLQ will be presented 
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
56 as BLQ, and the SD and %CV will be reported as not applicable.  Summary statistics of the 
ISIS 396443 CSF concentrations will be tabulated by day.  At the discretion of the 
pharmacokine ticist and/or biostatistician, samples may be excluded from descriptive statistics 
if there are large deviations between scheduled and actual sampling days or times, or large 
deviations between actual dose and nominal dose.  
Due to the limited CSF samples collected no CSF pharmacokinetic parameters will be 
calculated.   
7.2 Plasma Pharmacokinetics  
7.2.1  Plasma Concentration Data  
Plasma concentrations of ISIS 396443, along with the scheduled (nominal) and actual 
sampling times (i.e., time from IT dosing) will be listed  (when applicable) for each patient, 
treatment group, and day.  Percentage differences between scheduled and actual sampling times will also be listed for all patients.  Percentage differences between actual administered dose and nominal dose will also be listed.   
Plasma concentrations below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) will be indicated by “BLQ”.  For the purpose of calculating typical descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, %CV, geometric mean, geometric %CV, median, minimum, and maximum) for pla sma 
concentrations, all BLQ values will be set to zero.  Mean plasma concentrations that are BLQ will be presented as BLQ, and the SD and %CV will be reported as not applicable.  Summary statistics of the ISIS 396443 plasma concentrations will be tabulated  by day and scheduled 
time point.  At the discretion of the pharmacokineticist and/or biostatistician, samples may be excluded from descriptive statistics if there are large deviations between scheduled and actual sampling times, or large deviations betwee n actual dose and nominal dose.  
ISIS 396443 plasma concentration versus time (actual) profiles from Day 1 to Day 29, for each patient, as well as the mean (±SD) plasma concentration versus time (scheduled) profiles for the applicable treatment group, will be presented graphically on linear and 
semilogarithmic scales. ISIS 396443 plasma concentration versus time (actual) profiles from 
Day 29 to Day 456, for each patient, as well as the mean (±SD) plasma concentration versus time (scheduled) profiles for the applicable treatment group, will be presented graphically on 
linear and semilogarithmic scales. Additionally, ISIS 396443 plasma concentration versus 
time (actual) profiles (Day 1) from 0 to 8 hours for all patients, as well as the mean (±SD) plasma concentration versus time (scheduled) profiles (0 to 8 hours) for the applicable 
treatment group will be presented graphically on linear and semilogarithmic scales. 
Additional plasma concentration versus time (actual) profiles, for all patients and for individual patients may also be generated, including but not necessarily limited to Day 1, 0 to 
24 hours; Day 85, 0 to 4 hours; and comparisons between Day 1 and Day 85, 0 to 8 hours.  
Samples may be excluded from the mean plots if there are large deviations between scheduled and actual sampling times, or large deviations between actual dose and nominal dose.  
7.2.2  Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis of ISIS 396443 will be carried out on each 
individual subject data set using Phoenix WinNonlin version 6.0 or higher (Pharsight 
Corporation, Mountain View, CA).  Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters in each patient 
(when applicable) will be determined.  For calculation of PK parameters, all BLQ values will 
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
57 be set to zero.  The following plasma PK parameters will be calculated (when applicable) and 
based on actual sampling times:  
• Cmax:  the maximum observed drug concentration in plasma, and  
• Tmax:  the time at which C max occurs.  
The following PK parameters may be calculated using actual sampling times where 
appropriate data exists at the discretion of the pharmacokinetic scientist:  
• AUC 0-24h:  areas under the plasma concentration -time curve from zero time (pre -dose) 
to 24 hours after the IT administration will be calculated using the line ar trapezoidal 
rule,  
• AUC 0-8h:  areas under the plasma concentration -time curve from zero time (pre -dose) 
to 8 hours after the IT administration will be calculated using the linear trapezoidal 
rule, and  
Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters (if applicable) wi ll be summarized using descriptive 
statistics (n, mean, SD, %CV, geometric mean, geometric %CV, median, minimum, and maximum) by treatment group, and day.   
Additional plasma pharmacokinetic parameters may be calculated (if applicable) at the 
discretion of the pharmacokineticist.  
Exposure-response relationships between selected pharmacodynamic (included but not 
limited to change in HFMSE) and pharmacokinetic measures (including but not limited to CSF concentrations, plasma AUC
0-8hr, Cmax, and plasma trough concentrations) may also be 
explored (including with and without stratification by antibody status), where appropriate. 
 8 Immunogenicity data  
Immunogenicity (IM) testing (anti-ISIS 396443 antibody positivity), using designated plasma 
samples collected from  each study subject, is planned to be conducted and reported.  
Immunogenicity plasma samples are to be collected pre-dosing on Days 1, 29, 85, and 274, and on Day 169 and 456.  Plasma samples collected at other time points for ISIS 396443 concentration determinations may also be evaluated for IM testing if of further interest and 
deemed warranted by the pharmacokinetic scientist.  An individual sample result will be 
designated ‘antibody positive’ based on both positive screening and confirmation assay resul ts 
(i.e., confirmed positive result), and otherwise will be deemed ‘antibody negative’.  A study 
subject will be given ‘antibody positive’ status if they have at least one confirmed positive 
sample result at any time during the treatment or post- treatment evaluation periods.  A study 
subject will be given ‘antibody negative’ status if all evaluated IM sample results are antibody 
negative and they have at least one evaluable IM result from Day 85 or later during the 
treatment and post- treatment evaluation periods.  Otherwise, a study subject will be given 
‘antibody inconclusive’ status.   
The IM incidence and IM incidence rate at each evaluated study time point, and for the 
overall treatment and post-treatment evaluation period, will be determined and appropr iately 
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
58 summarized, by treatment, as the number of and percentage of evaluated subjects with 
antibody negative, antibody positive, and antibody inconclusive status.  In addition, in 
antibody positive study subjects, antibody titers of any antibody positive samples will be 
reported (listed) and also appropriately summarized across subjects and by treatment (e.g., at each evaluated time point, or by observed peak titer values, etc.) at the discretion of the 
designated study pharmacokineticist and/or statistician.   
Antibody positivity in anti-ISIS 396443 antibody-positive subjects will also be designated 
(when possible) as being either ‘persistent’ or ‘transient’, but only for those subjects in which 
at least one confirmed antibody positive sample result is followed (>100 days later) by at least 
one additional IM sample assessment (which can be either a confirmed positive or negative result(s)).  Those study patients meeting the above criteria and with at least 2 confirmed 
positive IM results occurring greater than 100 days apart (~5 immunoglobulin half- lives) will 
be considered to have a ‘persistent’ antibody response.  All other subjects meeting the above 
criteria will be considered to have a ‘transient’ antibody response.  Those remaining anti- ISIS 
396443 antibody- positive subjects who do not meet the above criteria will not be classified as 
either ‘persistent’ or ‘transient’, and thus will be given the designation ‘ND’ (not determinable) for persistent/transient IM status.   
When and where warranted, PK (e.g., elevated plasma trough level) and selected safety and efficacy (e.g., HFMSE) results may be further summarized (stratified) by antibody status (antibody negative versus positive subjects) and treatment. In previous clinical trials, only 
minimal immunogenic ity samples have confirmed positive for anti-ISIS 396443 antibodies, 
therefore, if no, or minimal, patients are designated ‘antibody positive’ stratification by 
antibody status will not be summarized.  
9 Sample size justification  
 
The sample size for this study was estimated based on limited available natural history data for the target population and data from studies ISIS 396443- CS1 and ISIS 396443-CS2.  
Seventy patients in the treated group and 35 patients in the control group will give at least 90% power to detect a 3 -point difference between control and treated groups in the change 
from baseline HFMSE with a standard deviation of 4.4, using a two-sided test with an alpha level of 0.05.  117 patients enrolled will ensure that a small dropout rate will not affect the power of the primary efficacy analysis.

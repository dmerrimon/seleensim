Aims of the Study  Aim 1: Implement and evaluate a remote optic nerve assessment (RONA) protocol using telemedicine to identify glaucoma-associated disease in at-risk rural patients using portable multimodal structural and functional assessment of the optic nerve and retina. Also assess for diabetic retinopathy, cataract, visual acuity impairment, and refractive error.  Aim 2: Identify and evaluate remediation strategies for the barriers to patient adherence with referral and follow-up appointments by comparing the eRectiveness of ﬁnancial incentives along with a validated patient education program versus a validated patient education program alone.   Aim 3: Investigate the cost-eRectiveness of the telemedicine program in diagnosing glaucoma using RONA versus usual in-person care from a glaucoma specialist.

Background  Prioritizing Vision Health. Vision health is an important public health concern aRecting Americans of all ages. The 2016 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) elevated the importance of a population health action framework that would transform “vision impairments from common to rare and eliminate correctable and avoidable vision impairments in the U.S. by 2030” .1 The report also called on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to develop a research agenda to provide evidence on eRective policies, practices, and interventions that could delay the onset and progression of eye diseases and “achieve eye and vision health equity by improving care in underserved populations” .2 Improving the “visual health of the nation through prevention, early detection, treatment, and rehabilitation” is also a Healthy People 2020 goal.3  Speciﬁcally, this research plan focuses on a novel telemedicine-based care delivery model for the detection and management of the eye diseases of glaucoma, primarily, as well as other eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy (DR). The public health challenge is that if eye conditions such as glaucoma and DR had been detected early in the disease course, vision impairment would be preventable, and sometimes reversible, with currently available ophthalmic treatments.   Epidemiology of Glaucoma. Glaucoma is one of the most common eye diseases of aging and is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss and blindness in older African Americans. Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), the most common form of glaucoma, is a chronic progressive optic neuropathy traditionally characterized by changes in the optic disk, thinning of the retinal nerve ﬁber layer, and gradual loss of vision, with both peripheral vision and central vision aRected depending on disease severity. The prevalence of POAG increases with age, aRecting more than 1.8% of the population over 40 but increasing to 23.2% among African Americans and 9.4% among non-Hispanic whites over the age of 75.4 With the rapid growth in older populations, the number of POAG cases will increase 250% by 2050, directly aRecting over 7 million lives.5 These numbers are speciﬁcally for POAG and do not include those who are monitored and treated for elevated intraocular pressure or for glaucoma suspect status, which along with POAG can all be considered glaucoma associated diseases (GAD). While the number of patients with glaucoma will nearly double over the next 20 years, the number of US ophthalmologists is expected to grow only 0.67%.4,5 The at-risk population for glaucoma in the U.S. is large, with older age as the primary risk factor as well as African Americans or Hispanics ≥ 40 years old, Asians, non-Hispanic whites ≥ 50 years old, older persons with diabetes, and those with a family history of glaucoma. POAG is at least 4-5 times higher in African Americans, progresses more rapidly and appears about 10 years earlier as compared to those of European descent.6,7 Fortunately, vision loss from glaucoma can be prevented by early detection, consistent follow-up, and control of intraocular pressure with medication or surgery.

Diabetes, and its ocular complications, is the leading cause of new cases of blindness in adults age 20-74 years in the US.8,9  African Americans are 2 times more likely to have DR than whites.10 In 2005-2008, 4.2 million (28.5%) Americans with diabetes ≥ age 40 had DR and of these, 655,000 (4.4%) had advanced DR that often leads to severe vision loss.11 The number of people with DR is expected to increase more than 3-fold by 2050, creating an immense, costly public health problem.9,12-14 Despite the risk of vision loss, only 50-60% of people with diabetes follow the recommendation to receive an annual dilated eye exam and this is even less in low-income and minority populations.15-17  Successful management of DR includes early diagnosis, tight glycemic and blood pressure control, and medical or surgical treatment to prevent vision loss.18-20  Epidemiology of Cataract and Refractive Error. Cataracts are a major cause of preventable visual impairment and blindness, especially in African Americans, with over 24 million people in the US having cataracts.10 A major risk factor for cataracts is aging and thus there is an expected 50% increase in cataracts by 2030.21 Additionally, studies have shown that African Americans have a reduced likelihood for curative cataract surgery, highlighting possible racial disparities in access to care for a reversible cause of visual impairment.22,23 Refractive error is another major cause of preventable visual impairment in the US. Over 48 million people over age 40 in the US have refractive error, with the majority having myopia. Uncorrected refractive error has also been found to be associated with racial disparities.24   Personal Burden of Eye Disease. The personal burden of eye disease and its accompanying visual impairment is undisputed and widely documented. Adults with glaucoma experience reductions in health-related quality of life and mobility problems including ambulatory and driving diRiculties and limitations in physical activity.25-41 Persons with vision impairment, regardless of etiology, are at increased risk for depression, social disengagement, employment challenges, and problems accessing health care.40,42-45 Several studies have demonstrated an association between vision impairment in adults and increased mortality risk, including studies focused on persons with glaucoma, cataract, and refractive error.46-52    Thus, interventions to improve early detection, eRective follow-up and implementation of evidence-based treatments for glaucoma, and patients’ adherence to medication plans will improve the health and well-being of persons with this condition and at-risk for the condition.  Economic Burden of Eye Disease. The economic burden of eye disease in the U.S. is staggering. Analyses commissioned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Prevent Blindness America estimate the annual cost of adult vision problems in the U.S. at about $139 billion.53 In Alabama, the cost of vision problems is $2.2 billion.53 This includes U.S. economic factors such as direct medical costs, other direct costs (e.g., nursing home care stemming from vision impairment), and productivity losses (i.e., lower wages for

The direct medical costs of glaucoma are $5.8 billion/year, which does not include indirect costs such as incremental nursing home placements and productivity losses.53 For people aged 40- 64 years, the annual medical costs of glaucoma are $1490/person and for those aged ≥ 65 years, they are $2580/person.53 The annual medical costs of blindness and low vision per person from all causes, including glaucoma, are $5870 and $10,020 for people aged 40-64 years and ≥ 65 years, respectively.53 Cost-eRective beneﬁts to quality of life have been reported for early detection and treatment of eye conditions such as glaucoma.54,55  Given projected Medicare shortfalls and potential reductions in Medicaid coverage, developing high quality and eRicient means to provide care for these individuals will become increasingly important.  Barriers to Eye Care. Inadequate access to eye care delays diagnosis and increases the personal and economic burdens of eye disease and visual disability.56 Problems accessing eye care are the most commonly cited barrier to care by African Americans in Alabama and elsewhere.57-59 Older African Americans are less likely to receive routine comprehensive eye care, when damaging eye conditions could be detected and treated early, and less likely to adhere to prescribed glaucoma therapies, thus contributing to higher rates of eye disease.10,60-63 The lower rate of receiving routine eye care may be contributing to higher rates of disability from eye disease. Factors underlying lower utilization include inadequate knowledge of basic symptoms, risk factors and available treatments; reduced ﬁnancial resources; limited transportation; low trust in health care providers; and high cost.57,64,65 Ophthalmologists rarely practice in rural areas where African Americans represent the majority of the population in Alabama.66 This produces a problem accessing ophthalmological care, especially subspecialist care.   Alabama’s Black Belt Region, named for its rich black soil, is a rural area with one of the highest poverty rates in the US. The Birmingham News has characterized it as America’s Third World.67 It has one of the highest concentrations of African American residents of any region of the country, representing over 50% of the population. In addition to having widespread poverty, the region is characterized by inadequate education, transportation, community resources, and a shortage of healthcare providers including a shortage of ophthalmologists and optometrists.66   To summarize, glaucoma is a blinding eye disease and a leading cause of irreversible vision loss in Americans, and THE leading cause in African Americans. In many rural counties in Alabama and the rest of the South, the majority of the population is African American. African Americans are less likely to receive routine, dilated comprehensive eye care that would facilitate early detection and thus prognosis. The number of cases of glaucoma and DR are expected to increase in the US. The personal burden of glaucoma, DR, cataract, refractive error, and vision impairment is heavy, with numerous negative implications for quality of life, and the economic burden is dramatically large. Ophthalmologists

Thus, all the factors we have discussed above -- the shortage of ophthalmologists in general but especially in communities with high concentrations of African Americans, the rising cost of care, and rapid growth in glaucoma prevalence in the population -- clearly necessitates an alternative model of care for these individuals.  Given the barriers to implementation of population-based screening for glaucoma, telemedicine is a potential strategy to improve disease detection and management as well as to improve eRectiveness, access, and adherence with routine eye care. Telemedicine refers to the electronic communication of medical information from one site to another to improve a patient’s clinical health status.68 It has already been utilized in many healthcare ﬁelds and can improve health outcomes, increase accessibility to specialty care, and increase patient satisfaction.68,69 By utilizing current technologies, telemedicine transmits patient data from a primary care clinic to another remote site for review by specialist physicians and thus, the standards of specialty care are more accessible to patients who live where no specialists practice. Telemedicine is well suited for the detection and management of certain eye conditions since there have been great strides made in the development of non-invasive ocular imaging devices that provide high levels of diagnostic reliability, ease of training of testing personnel, and electronically transmissible results. Telemedicine has been implemented in some areas of eye care but the vast majority of the literature on telemedicine for the chronic eye conditions of adulthood is focused on DR screening. Acceptance of telemedicine for DR using digital fundus photography has increased steadily around the world over the years stemming from its proven eRicacy, cost-eRectiveness, and ability to reach underserved populations.70-72   Applying Previous Experience in a New Way. This project focuses on the development and implementation of a community-based detection model for the two most common vision-threatening eye diseases in the African American population, POAG and DR. This will be achieved through a novel telemedicine program using RONA, based on integrated and collaborative partnerships, to improve both the quality of and access to eye care. The program will use advanced eye imaging technology to remotely assist in the detection and management of POAG, DR, cataract, and refractive error in a predominantly African American community receiving primary care through FQHC’s in rural counties of Alabama, where African Americans represent 56% of the population.73 Many of these rural counties are in Alabama’s Black Belt Region that was described in detail above. Compared to many other states, Alabamians, particularly African Americans, have a disproportionately high prevalence of many risk factors for POAG and DR. Alabama has a higher prevalence of diabetes than any other state (~13%), and African American Alabamians have a diabetes mortality rate 2.5 times greater than white Alabamians.74 The relative lack of specialists in communities with high concentrations of African Americans, combined with the rapid growth in glaucoma and diabetes prevalence, clearly necessitates an innovative and community-based approach to eye care.

One method to try to increase adherence levels has been through ﬁnancial incentives. Previous research in rural populations with improving adherence to preventive services such as mammography and inﬂuenza vaccination has shown that ﬁnancial incentives are the only method to increase adherence compared to other behavioral interventions.75 In addition to showing eRectiveness of ﬁnancial incentives, there are ethical considerations as to the appropriateness of incentivizing health behaviors through ﬁnancial means. Shea et al. found that patients were willing to engage in incentive programs and had a positive experience without impact on the relationship with their physician.76 In relation to eye care, Tan et al. found improved adherence to tertiary eye care services after community-based screenings in low socio-economic areas with the addition of an incentive care scheme.77 That study provided a one-time transportation allowance to the appointment and a subsidy for the ﬁrst tertiary eye care consultation.77 In our proposed study, in addition to providing the eye health education program, ﬁnancial incentives will also be used in the study sites in order to encourage patient adherence to referral and follow-up appointments.

Protocol  Source Population.  This consisted of patients seeking healthcare at three FQHCs in north central Alabama. The three FQHCs are part of the Cahaba Medical Care Foundation, an Alabama-based FQHC. They care for a population of approximately 16,000 patients per year, including 58% who are African American, 38% White, and < 3% Hispanic. Among the active patients in these FQHCs, health insurance status is 25% Medicaid, 30% Medicare, 25% private insurance, and 20% uninsured. The study clinics are in rural Alabama towns: Centreville (Bibb County), Maplesville (Chilton County), and Marion (Perry County). This region of Alabama borders or is part of the region known as the Black Belt named for its rich black soil that supported cotton agriculture. In the 19th century, the agricultural workers were enslaved African Americans. The Black Belt consists of 9 of 10 of the poorest counties in the state. Poverty is directly link to health disparities in the Black Belt.78 Today this region’s population is over 50% African American.  Inclusion criteria.  Patients presenting at these clinics were eligible to participate if they had one or more risk factors for GAD79 and volunteered to participate: (1) African American or His-panic ≥40 years of age; (2) White ≥50 years of age; (3) anyone ≥18 years of age with diabetes, (4) anyone ≥18 years of age with a GAD; and (5) anyone ≥18 years of age with a family history of glaucoma. All participants spoke and understood English.  Exclusion criterion: If patients did not complete written informed consent to participate, they did not participate.  Study Design. This study had two arms. The protocol, as described below, was identical in both arms, except for the following.  One arm consisted of participants not receiving any ﬁnancial incentive for attending recommended follow-up care with an optometrist or ophthalmologist based on positive eye screening results. The other arm had a ﬁnancial incentive, that is, participants recommended to attend a follow-up care exam with an optometrist or ophthalmologist received $50 for attending the appointment. In the second arm, we conﬁrmed with the eye care provider through the optometrist’s or ophthalmologist’s electronic medical records (EMR) whether the participant attended the follow-up appointment. We considered randomizing patients to each of the two arms. We decided not to use this approach because we were concerned that patients may talk among themselves (they live in small rural communities) about some receiving a ﬁnancial incentive to attend recommended follow-up visits versus others not receiving a ﬁnancial incentive. This was viewed as causing a potential conﬂict for patients in terms of their participating in the study and viewed as potentially unfair by patients.  Thus, our approach was to ﬁrst enroll half of the total number of patients in the non-ﬁnancial incentive arm, and then when that was complete, to enroll the second half of the total number of patients in the ﬁnancial arm. The goal was to enroll 500 patients in each arm.

These are each described below. All were completed in a single visit to the FQHC. All eye and visual function measurements were performed on each eye separately. The clinical coordinators (certiﬁed ophthalmic technicians) collected all data including questionnaires.  Demographic review.  Questionnaires obtained information on birthdate, gender, race, ethnicity, marital status, medical insurance status, transportation availability, education level, employment status, whether they received an eye examination in the past two years, reasons for not seeking an eye examination in the past two years, and contact information (address, phone number).  Self-reported clinical characteristics. Questionnaires obtained information on the following: smoking status, family history of glaucoma or blindness, and ocular history of major chronic eye diseases or conditions. Family history of glaucoma was considered positive if a participant reported a glaucoma diagnosis for a ﬁrst degree relative (parent, sibling, child).  Ocular screening. All measurements were completed under undilated conditions, as follows.  (1)  Distance visual acuity was assessed using a Snellen chart presented at 20 feet while participants wore whatever correction (if any) they were habitually wearing for distance. (2) Autorefraction was carried out with the QuickSee (PlenOptika Inc) or Retinomax (Nikon). (3) Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured with the iCare portable rebound tonometer (iCare USA). A second measurement was taken if the IOP was > 21 mm Hg. If these 2 IOPs diRered by more than 2 mm Hg, a third measurement was taken. If IOP was measured twice, the mean value was used as the IOP; if it was measured 3 times, the middle value was used. Participants with IOP ≥30 mm Hg were referred to an optometrist or ophthalmologist in our fast-track protocol: IOP > 30 mm Hg within 2 weeks; IOP > 35 mm Hg, within 1 week; and IOP > 40 mm Hg, an urgent referral within 1 day. (4) Visual ﬁeld was assessed using three methods: the Humphrey Field Analyzer 3 (HFA3) using the Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm Fast screening strategy (Carl Zeiss Meditec), the Melbourne Rapid Fields, a tablet-based perimetry test (M&S Technologies), and the Alleye test (Oculocare Medical).  Retinal imaging.  Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD- OCT) was performed using the Maestro2 (Topcon Medical Systems), measuring the thickness of the retinal nerve ﬁber layer of the optic nerve head and of the macula by a single wideﬁeld OCT scan measuring 12 ×9 mm (512 ×128 pixels). This encompassed both the macula and disc. The Maestro2 also provided high-resolution fundus photographs encompassing both the optic nerve and macula.   Telemedicine. All the above ocular screening data and retinal imaging, as well as the medical and ocular history and demographics (age, gender, race, ethnicity) were

With respect to visual ﬁeld data, only HFA3 data were transferred since the other two ﬁeld tests are not routinely used in standard of care in glaucoma assessments. The ophthalmologist made the following diagnostic judgments based on the screening in terms of the presence of the following conditions: glaucoma, glaucoma suspect, ocular hypertension, diabetic retinopathy, cataract, refractive error, or any other ocular conditions identiﬁed through the above screening data.  Diagnoses for GAD conditions are as follows. Ocular hypertension is deﬁned as no glaucomatous appearing disc changes (described below), a normal visual ﬁeld (described below), and statistically elevated IOP ≥23 mm Hg. Glaucoma suspect is deﬁned as the presence of glaucomatous-appearing disc changes (de- scribed below), normal visual ﬁeld (described below), and statistically normal IOP < 23 mm Hg. Glaucoma refers to the presence of glaucomatous appearing disc changes (de- scribed below) and an abnormal visual ﬁeld (described be- low). A glaucomatous appearing optic disk is deﬁned as evidence of excavation, neuroretinal rim thinning or notching, localized or diRuse retinal nerve ﬁber layer (RNFL) defect, or a between-eye asymmetry of the vertical cup disc ratio > 0.2. A glaucomatous visual ﬁeld defect is deﬁned as a reliable SAP Humphrey 24-2 ﬁeld (deﬁned as < 33% false- positives results, false-negative results, and ﬁxation losses) that exhibits a pattern standard deviation outside of the 95% normal limits, or a glaucoma hemiﬁeld test outside of the 99% normal limits consistent with an RNFL defect pattern based on clinical review. A normal eye that meets none of these deﬁnitions of GAD is deﬁned as not having glaucomatous-appearing disc changes and having a normal visual ﬁeld and statistically normal IOP < 23 mm Hg (both described above). Diagnoses of DR were made based on the National Health Service Grading Classiﬁcation System.80  Each participant, the FQHC primary care provider, and their eye care provider (if they had one) received the ﬁnal report about the ophthalmologist’s screening-based diagnoses.  These were sent out electronically within 14 days of the participant’s screening visit date. The report contained diagnostic information on the conditions mentioned above plus visual acuity, IOP , recommended treatment, and whether a follow-up exam was recommended.  Recommendations from the telemedicine ophthalmologist.  Participants whom the ophthalmologist clinically judged as normal were recommended to undergo an annual comprehensive eye examination on a routine basis. The following participants were recommended for a follow-up examination visit with an optometrist who was partnered with the FQHC (located in a separate oRice), or an ophthalmologist at the Glaucoma Service at UAB, the Lions Eye Clinic at UAB, or an ophthalmologist whose clinic was located in the FQHC geographic area: participants with 20/40 or worse visual acuity and/or with an IOP ≥23 mm Hg in either eye, as well as those with GAD (glaucoma, glaucoma suspect, or ocular hypertension), DR, and/or other ocular condition that the ophthalmologist viewed as needing to be examined in per- son.

Vision-Speciﬁc Health-Related Quality of Life.  This was assessed using the National Eye Institute Visual Function Question – 9.81  Satisfaction with the RONA screening.  Following the ocular screening, participants’ satisfaction with the telemedicine screening was evaluated by a questionnaire using Likert scales. Questions address satisfaction with the vision screening and the time that it took to complete it (very satisﬁed/satisﬁed/dissatisﬁed/very dissatisﬁed), as well as how convenient the venue was (very convenient/convenient/inconvenient/very inconvenient). Participants were also asked whether they would recommend the ocular screening to others, whether they could return to the same venue in 12 months for another screening, and whether they could make a follow-up visit to an optometrist or ophthalmologist if referred for a problem identiﬁed by the screening (very likely/somewhat likely/not very likely/not at all likely)

Statistical Analysis Plan  Demographic, socioeconomic, medical, and ocular factors were compared across groups who did and did not receive incentives for obtaining follow-up care using unpaired t-tests for continuous data and using the Fisher’s exact test for categorical data. The proportion of individuals in each group who were recommended for a follow-up comprehensive eye exam and, among those individuals, the proportion who attended that exam was compared using chi-square tests. Given the demographic diRerences in the study groups, the impact of incentivization was evaluated using a subset of incentivized and non-incentivized patients matched on age, sex and race. The impact of COVID-19 on follow-up attendance was estimated by correlating the rate of COVID-19 deaths in Alabama obtained from the Alabama Department of Public Health and the average number of daily hospitalizations per month with the proportion of those attending follow-up referrals during each month of the study.  P-values ≤ 0.05 (two-sided) were considered statistically signiﬁcant.

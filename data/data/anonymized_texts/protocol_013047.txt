2 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONAL E 
The heart has a complex network of autonomic innervation with the majority of input occurring at a series of ganglionated ple xi. These 
ganglionated plexi are found in the epicardial adipose tissue around the base of the heart and interruption of these regi ons, most 
commonly through endocardial ablation, has been a potential treatment for multiple cardiac arrhythmias . This approach has become an 
accepted strategy for treating  atrial fibrillation  but may also be of value for  vasovagal syncope, sinus node dysf unction, and heart block. 
Identification of the ganglionated plexi is challenging and multiple techniques have been utilized. We anticipate that using standard 
cardiac computed tomography (CT) to identify epicardial adipose tissue can provide a safe, non -invasive option to locate these regions 
and guide appropriate intervention. We also anticipate that a consistent network of innervation between the GPs will be identifiable  with 
distinct innervation of the sinus and AV nodes . 
2.1 Study Rationale  
Despite progress made in treating atrial fibrillation with catheter ablation, outcomes remain suboptimal with pulmonary vein isolation 
alone. Ablation of ganglionated plexi has been shown to be beneficial in patients with atrial fibrillation although optim al strategies of 
localization of these regions have yet to be determined. We aim to develop a novel strategy of CT guided ganglionated plexi 
localization to guide ablation in patients with atrial fibrillation.  We also aim to clarify the network of innerva tion between GP to 
clarify the optimal ablation strategy.  
2.2 Background  
Autonomic cardiac innervation arises from the brainstem and travels to the heart via the cervical and thoracic stellate gangl ion 
(sympathetic system) and the vagus nerve (parasympathetic system). The two systems combine to innervate the heart in a dense network 
of post -ganglionic axons called the ganglionated plexi (Hou Y, et al). These ganglionated plexi are located at the base of the heart in the 
epicardial adipose tissue (Goudis CA, et al; Armour JA, et al).  
 
With direct visualization of the epicardial adipose tissue at the time of cardiac surgery, autonomic modulation with injectio n of botulinum 
toxin has been shown to reduce short and long term burden of atrial fibrillation (Romanov A et al; Waldron et al).  Several techniques 
have been proposed to identify the ganglionated plexi at the time of endocardial procedures. Anatomic approaches have been ut ilized 
targeting classical regions of autonomic innervation, although this procedure has several limitations inc luding individual anatomic

variation.  In addition, high frequency stimulation mapping to identify local vagal responses has been used (Kim MY, et al; H u F, et al). 
This technique is limited by the need for general anesthesia and the duration of time required to map the entire atriu m, which is especially 
relevant for non -atrial fibrillation ablation procedures where such mapping would not otherwise be required. More recently, techniques 
to evaluate local electrograms have been developed based on the principle that fractionated electr ical activity may be noted in the 
endocardium beneath ganglionated plexi due to the inter -myocardial nerve fibers that interrupt normal myocardial -to-myocardial 
conduction (Pachon M JC, et al; Lellouche N, et al).  
 
We have recently shown that there is an association between left atrial epicardial adipose tissue identified by CT imaging an d 
electrogram fractionation (Zghaib T, et al). This association is consistent with other descriptions of local electrograms at the site of 
successful ablation of ganglionated plexi.  Given the routine nature of pre -procedure imaging, which is frequently performed prior to 
atrial fibrillation ablation to clarify relevant anatomy, and the ability to identify this epicardial adipose tiss ue, we anticipate CT can 
provide a safe, non -invasive option to locate these regions and guide appropriate intervention.  Ablation targeting ganglionated plexi 
have been used to treat atrial fibrillation as well as vasovagal syncope, sinus node dysfunction , and heart block. A simple and reliable 
method of identifying ablation target could improve the safety and efficacy of these procedures.  
 
Update to 1/23/24 version: Although tragus stimulation has been frequently utilized, there is evidence to suggest more robust  vagus 
nerve innervation in the region of the cymba concha  (Frangos et al 2015; Rong et al 2012; Courties et al 2022).  For this reason, electrodes 
positioned in this area may have more consistent physiologic effects related to vagus nerve stimulation.  
2.2.1  Clinical Adverse Event Profile  
Potential complications of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation include bleeding, vascular injury, cardiac perforation, a trioesophageal 
fistula formation, phrenic nerve injury, bradycardia, arrhythmia induction, myocardial infarction, and stroke. These  complications are 
related to the insertion of catheters from the femoral veins into the heart and across the intra -atrial septum to the left atrium as well as 
the delivery of radiofrequency energy in the left atrium.  We do not anticipate the mapping p ortion of the procedure, which will be 
performed with a standard ablation catheter, to confer significant additional risk. The  most likely increased risk from high frequency 
stimulation is the induction of atrial fibrillation, which is common as part of routine ablation procedures and does not pose  significant 
risk. We do not anticipate these risks to be significant modified by t he additional ablation targeting ganglionated plexi, which are 
located in regions frequently targeted in ablation of atrial fibrillat ion and atypical atrial flutters.

2.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment  
2.3.1  Known Potential Risks  
As discussed above, potential risks of ablation of ganglionated plexi include the risk factors associated with catheter ablat ion for atrial 
fibrillation as discussed above. An additional theoretical  risk includes increased sinus rates following vagal denervation, which has 
been described as transient in the literature and not seen in our own experience.  Potential risks of ear stimulation include local 
discomfort or skin irritation/burns. Potential risks of high frequency stimulation include pain, which will  not be perceived given the 
use of general anesthesia, and the induction of atrial fibrillation, which routinely occurs during atrial fibrillation ablati ons. 
2.3.2  Known Potential Benefits  
Potential benefits include the reduction in burden of atrial fibrillation by eliminating vagal triggers for atrial fibrillati on.  In addition, 
societal benefits include the development of procedural techniques that may improve treatment of atrial fibrillation, vasovagal 
syncope, and other conditions.  
2.3.3  Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits  
The risks of participating in the study are not significant beyond the risks associated with routine clinical care (including  pre-
procedural CT imaging, atrial mapping and ablation). Therefore , the potential benefits to the individual subject and to society 
outweigh the risks of participating in the study.

4 STUDY PLAN  
4.1 Study Design  
This is a n observational , single -center study evaluating feasibility and efficacy of CT and high frequency stimulation guided GP 
mapping and ablation in patients with AF undergoing catheter ablation with pulmonary vein isolation.  
4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
This study is designed to characterize the association between CT identified epicardial adipose tissue and HFS mapping identi fied GP 
sites in the right and left atrium. Given the evidence that GP ablation can be beneficial for patients undergoing catheter ablation for 
atrial fibrillation, all patients will undergo GP ablation following mapping in addition to standard pulmonary vein isolation . The  
hierarchical relationship within the network of cardiac GPs is unknown as is the  optimal order of GP ablatio n. Given equipoise in the 
order of GP ablation, we will equally allocate the site of initial ablation between the 8 major G P ablation locations .  
4.3 End of Study Definition  
A participant is considered to have completed the study if he or she has completed all phases of the study including the last  visit.

STUDY INTERVENTION  
4.8 Study Intervention(s) Administration  
4.8.1  Study Intervention Description  
All patients will have GP mapping performed using the Nicolet (Natus) Cortical Stimulator (see attached) with 12V output at 20Hz 
frequency with 10ms pulse duration with at least 3grams of contact force. Stimulation will be provided for up to 10 seconds o r until 
vagal response is noted  (>2s ventricular asystole, AV block, or R -R interval increase by at least 50%) . Natus stimulator had FDA 
clearance (K072964) for cortical stimulation.  Prior to ablation, baseline ear vagus nerve stimulation will be performed  via stimulation 
of bilateral cymba concha  to document response  using Parasym tragal stimulator (IDE information attached) . Ablation of mapped GPs 
will be performed using standard ablation catheter with routine approaches to ablation energy delivery and monitoring  (see below 
flowchart) . Foll owing ablation  of each GP , local HFS will be repeated  in all GP regions  and ear vagus nerve stimulation will be 
repeated  via bilateral cymba concha . After all GP are ablated, a ll patients be given IV atropine (0.04mg/kg max: 4mg) to assess global 
vagal tone. Following this, patients will undergo pulmonary vein isolation using standard equipment  and techniques .   
Devices will be obtained from the manufacturer (Natus and Parasym respectively) and will be stored in a secured laboratory sp ace. No 
particular temperature or climate requirements are present for either device.  All devices will be labeled according to the  manufacturer 
guidance and will be returned to the manufacturer in the event of any device failure.  Devices will be stored and managed in 
compliance with OCR guidelines.

5 STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT 
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
 
5.1 Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a participant from the study for the following reasons:  
• Pregnancy  
• Significant  non-compliance  with follow -up visits  
• If any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation occurs such that continue d 
participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the participant  
• If the participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously recognized) that precludes further 
study participation  
The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the Case Report Form (CRF). Subje cts 
who sign the informed consent form and are randomized but do not undergo ablation  may be replaced.  Subjects who sign the informed 
consent form and  are randomized and undergo ablation , and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or discontinued from the study , 
will not  be replaced.]  
5.2 Lost To Follow -Up 
A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she fails to return for two scheduled visits and is unable to be con tacted by 
the study site staff.

The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  
• The site will attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit within 3 months  and counsel the participant on 
the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the participant wishes to and/or should continue i n 
the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make every effort to regain contact with the 
participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address 
or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record or study file.  
• Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a 
primary reason of lost to follow -up.

6 STUDY  ASSESSMENT AND PROCEDURES  
6.1 Efficacy Assessments  
• Elimination of local HFS response and ear vagus nerve stimulation will determine acute procedural efficacy  
• Loop recorder or ambulatory monitors interrogations to evaluate presence and burden of atrial fibrillation  
• History to identify symptomatic atrial fibrillation and to identify episodes of AF that may have been vagally mediated  
6.2 Safety and Other Assessments  
• Physical examination will be performed following the ablation procedure to identify any procedural complications including 
vascular or neurological injury.  
• Repeat examination and history will be performed at follow -up visit to identify any potential procedural complications.  
6.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
6.3.1  Definition of Adverse Events (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention  in humans, whether or not 
considered intervention related. Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  
A pre-existing condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity or the char acter of the condition changes.

Adverse events are classif ied as serious or non -serious. A serious adverse event is any AE that, in the view of either the i nvestigator or 
the sponsor, is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospital stay  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  when the event does not fit the other outcomes, but the event may jeopardize the patient and may 
require medical or surgical intervention (treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes.  
• required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage ( for devices  only) 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening but  are clearly o f major clinical significance. They 
may jeopardize the subject and  may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious ou tcomes noted above. For example, drug 
overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in -patient hospitalization, or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency 
department would typically be considered serious . 
6.3.3  Classification of an Adverse Event  
6.3.3.1  Severity of Event  
For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines wil l be used to describe 
severity.

• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may 
cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe 
events are usually potentially  life-threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to 
“serious”.  
6.3.3.2  Relationship to Study Intervention  
All adverse events (AEs) must have their relationship to procedure  assessed by the clinician who examines and evaluates the 
participant based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be gra ded using 
the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be considered . 
• Related – The AE is known to occur with the GP mapping or ablation , there is a reasonable possibility that the procedure  
caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the procedure  and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the  procedure  and the AE.  
• Not Related – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the procedure  caused the event, there is no 
temporal relationship between the procedure  and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  
6.3.3.3  Expectedness  
The primary investigator  will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event (AE) is expected or unexpected.  An AE will be 
considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previous ly described 
for the procedure.

6.3.4  Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -Up 
Safety will be assessed by monitoring and recording potential adverse effects using the CTCAE grading system at each study visit. 
Participants will be monitored by medical histories, physical examinations, and loop recorder interrogations.  If CTCAE  grading does 
not exist for an adverse event, the severity of mild, moderate, severe, life -threatening, and death, corresponding to Grades 1 -5, will be 
used whenever possible.  
At each contact with the subject, the investigator will seek information on adverse events by non -directive questioning and, as 
appropriate, by examination. Adverse events may also be detected when they are volunteered by the subject during the screenin g 
process or between visits, or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments. Information on all adverse events 
will be recorded in the source documentation. To the extent possible, adverse events will be recorded as a diagnosis and sym ptoms 
used to make the diagnosis recorded within the diagnosis event.  
As much as possible, each adverse event or follow -up information will be evaluated to determine:  
1. Severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 -5) 
2. Duration (start and end dates)  
3. Relationship to the study treatment or process – [Reasonable possibility that AE is related: No (unrelated/ not suspected) or 
Yes (a suspected adverse reaction)]. If yes (suspected) - is the event possibly, probably or definitely related to the 
investigati onal treatment?  
4. Expectedness to study treatment or process – [Unexpected – if the event severity and/or frequency is not described in the 
investigator brochure (if applicable) or protocol].  
5. Action taken with respect to study or investigational treatment or process (none, dose adjusted, temporarily interrupted, 
permanently discontinued, unknown, not applicable)

6. Whether medication or therapy taken (no concomitant medication/non -drug therapy, concomitant medication/non -drug 
therapy)  
7. Whether the event is serious  
Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and assessment 
should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the  study 
treatment, the in terventions required to treat it, and the outcome.  
 
 
6.3.5  Adverse Event Reporting  
Reporting Period  
Adverse events will be reported from the time of informed consent until study completion.  
Investigator Reporting: Notifying the Study Sponsor  
Every SAE, regardless of suspected causality (e .g., relationship to study product (s) or study procedure (s) or disease progression) must 
be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  
Recurrent episodes, complications, or progression of the initial SAE must be reported to the Sponsor as a follow -up to the original  
episode within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. A SAE considered completely unrelated to a 
previously reported one should be reported separately as a new event.  
New information regarding the SAE will be reported as it becomes available and in the same manner that the initial SAE (i.e. SAE 
form ). The investigator must follow the event to resolution or until the event is deemed and documented irreversible, whichever i s 
longer.

Investigator  Reporting: Local Reporting Requirements  
The investigator will report AEs and SAEs to the  IRB/EC of record and other local regulatory groups per the local requirements.  
6.3.6  Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
The study investigator shall complete an Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect Form and submit to the study sponsor and to the 
reviewing Institutional Review Board (IRB) . The study sponsor is responsible for conducting an evaluation of an unanticipated 
adverse device effect and shall report the results of such evaluation to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  and to all reviewing 
IRBs and parti cipating investigators  per the applicable regulation.  
6.4 Unanticipated Problems  
6.4.1  Definition of Unanticipated Problems (UP)  
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others t o 
include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -
related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved research protocol and informed consent document; 
and (b) the  characteristics of the participant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that  the 
incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, econom ic, 
or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
6.4.2  Unanticipated Problem Reporting  
Unanticipated problems (UPs) such as:

• Post-marketing withdrawal of a drug, device, or biologic used in a research protocol due to safety concerns.  
• FDA ban of a drug, device, or biologic used in a research protocol due to safety concerns.  
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks, or the complaint cannot be resolved by the research  
team  
• Breach of confidentiality  
• Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C and the investigator believes it  
is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study  
• Premature closure of a study (e.g., due safety, lack of efficacy, feasibility, financial reasons, etc.)  
should be reported by the investigator to  the Institutional Review Board (IRB) . The UP report will include the following information:  
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experienc e, or outcome represents an UP;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are proposed in response to the 
UP. 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported  using the following timeline:  
• UPs that are serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported as any other SAE.  
• Any other UP will be reported to the  IRB 10 business days  of the investigator  becoming aware of the problem.  
• All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by an institution’s written reporting procedur es), 
the supporting agency head (or designee), and the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) within 10 business  days of 
the IRB’s receipt of the report of the problem from the investigator.

7 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
7.1 Statistical Hypotheses  
• Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s):  We anticipate anatomic correlation between CT identified epicardial adipose tissue within 3 
pixels (0.625x3=1.875mm) of an endocardial mapping point where HFS confirmed a vagal response consistent with ganglionated 
plexus innervation.  
• Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s): Acute procedural success defined by elimination of ear vagus nerve stimulation response will 
be achievable in all patients . 
 
7.2 Statistical Analyses  
7.2.1  General Approach  
• For descriptive statistics, categorical data will be presented as percentages and continuous data will be presented as median s 
with intraquartile ranges.  
• All statistical tests will be 2 -sided, with p<0. 05 indicating statistical significance.  
7.2.2  Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
• Anatomic correlation between CT and GP mapping will be defined based on review of electroanatomic maps from the ablation 
procedure merged with segmented pre -procedural CT images.  
7.2.3  Analysis of the Secondary Endpoint(s)  
• AF burden will be defined based on loop recorder interrogation and patient history of requiring cardioversion

8.1.8  Data Handling and Record Keeping  
8.1.8.1  Data Collection and Management Responsibilities  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the site investigator.  The investigator is 
responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  
All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data.  
Hardcopies of the study visit worksheets will be provided for use as source document worksheets for recording data for each 
participant enrolled in the study.  Data recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) derived from source documents should be 
consistent with the data re corded on the source documents.  
Clinical data (including adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, and expected adverse reactions data) and clinical lab oratory 
data will be entered into our data collection system.  The data system includes password protection and internal quality checks, such as 
automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered d irectly from 
the source documents.  
8.1.8.2  Study Records Retention  
Study documents should be retained for a minimum of 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an Internat ional 
Conference on Harmonization  (ICH) region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or 
until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the trial. These documents should be 
retained for a longer period, however, if required by local regulations. No records will be destroyed without the written con sent of the 
sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator when these documents no longer need to be 
retained.  
8.1.9  Protocol Deviations

Hypokit  1 mg during the other period . 
Study location:  Approximately 8 clinical research centers in North America and Europe. 
Study duration:  The estimated duration of study participation for each individual subject is 
approximately 4 weeks. The estimated duration of the entire study is 8 months. 
Sample size:  It is anticipated that approximately 200 subjects will  be screened for this study 
to achieve 122 randomized subjects and a goal  of 111 subjec ts who are 
evaluable for treatment both periods .   
Subjects:  The study will include male and female subjects with T1D between the ages of 
18 and 75 years, inclusive, at Screening. 
Inclusion Criteria:  1. Males and  females diagnosed with T1D for at least 24 months.  Women of 
childbearing potential require a negative urine pregnancy test and must use medically accepted contraception throughout the study and for 7 days after the last dose of study drug.

Study Methods : Subjects will complete the screening procedures to determine eligibility up to 30 days before enrollment in to the treatment period and administration of study 
drug.  Subjects not meeting eligibility criteria may  be rescreened 30 -days after 
an initial screen failure .  A single re- screen is permitted, and this re- screen is 
only permissible if the reason for the prior screen failure was for laboratory measurements.  Blood  for clinical laboratory tests can be redrawn after a 30 -day 
wait; however, other screening procedures do NOT need to be repeated.  If the new clinical laboratory test results meet eligibility, the subject may be dosed. Otherwise, the subject is not eligib le for dosing or further re -screening.  
The evening prior to each inpatient study visit, subjects with confirmed plasma glucose not greater than 350 mg/dL (19.44 mmol/L) will be admitted for an overnight stay between 6 and 8 pm.  Subjects will be provided a standardized 
dinner and will continue their usual insulin regimen per PI discretion .  At the 
Investigator’s discretion, subjects may receive a standardized snack before midnight the day before treatment. 
Subjects will be instruc ted to fast after midnight.  If site staffing allows for 
appropriate oversight, a n intravenous  (IV)  catheter will be placed, and 
maintenance fluids will be  administered.  Otherwise , the subject’s own infusion 
pump will be used overnight.  The subject ’s plasma glucose will be monitored 
overnight, and glucose (IV or oral tablets) and/ or insulin (IV or subcutaneous 
[SC]) will be administered as necessary to maintain plasma glucose with in a 
recommended target  range of 80 to 150 mg/ dL (4.44 to 8.34 mmol/L) . 
Overnight glucose measurements outside of this recommended range will not 
be considered protocol deviations.  At a minimum, glucose will be assessed by 
BGM or YSI (not CGM) at midnight, 3 am, and 6 am, with ±30 minutes for 
these mea surements, which will be entered into the EDC. 
Subjects will continue to fast the morning of the procedure and an IV  catheter 
for blood sampling will be inserted , ideally in the antecubital fossa of  the arm.  
The hand used for blood sampling will be kept warm by use of a heated-hand 
box to increase blood flow and achieve “arterialized” samples.  Subject s will be 
kept supine and covered under a blanket to maintain warmth . 
The subject will be eligible to begin the b aseline euglycemic steady state period 
when the ir plasma glucose is confirmed to be within the range of 70  to 
270 mg/dL  (3.89 to 15.0 mmol/L) .  IV insulin will be administered to maintain 
the plasma glucose within the range of 75 to 115 mg/dL (4.17 to 6.38 mmol /L) 
for 30  minutes.  If the plasma glucose has been maintained within the range of 
75 to 115 mg/dL (4.17 to 6.38  mmol/L) for at least 30 minutes, and the insulin 
infusion rate varies no more than ± 20%, the induction procedure may 
commence.  
XSGP -304 Clinical Protocol   
G-Pen (glucagon injection)   
 9 
Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 Eligible subjects  will enter a state of insulin -induced hypoglycemia in a gradual 
and controlled fashion, through a monitored, standardized induction protocol.   
During the baseline phase, plasma glucose measurements will be taken every 15 
minutes. During the induction phase, p lasma glucose measurements will be 
taken every 1 0 minutes while glucose is >  80.0 mg/dL (> 4.44 mmol/L) and at 
5-minute intervals once plasma glucose is ≤  80.0 mg/dL  (≤ 4.44 mmol/L). 
Once the initial plasma glucose measurement < 5 4.0 mg/dL (< 2.78 mmol/L) is 
achieved, the IV insulin infusion will be returned to the rate established at the 
end of the baseline euglycemia steady state period . After 5 minutes, the IV  
insulin infusion will be  stopped, and a confirmatory plasma glucose reading 
will be taken to determine whether a hypoglycemic steady state has been 
reached, which is defined as a plasma glucose value ≥ 42 mg/dL  
(≥ 2.33 mmol/L) and < 5 4 mg/dL  (< 2.78 mmol/L) with an  8-minute linearly 
extrapolated value for plasma glucose ≥ 42 mg/dL  (≥ 2.33 mmol/L). 
If the subject is not in a hypoglycemic steady state, plasma glucose should be rechecked at up to two subsequent 5-minute intervals .  If th e second  or third  
confirmatory glucose is ≥ 42 mg/dL (≥ 2.33 mmol/L) and < 54 mg/dL (< 2.78 mmol/L) with an 8- minute linearly extrapolated value for plasma 
glucose ≥ 42 mg/dL (≥  2.33 mmol/L), the subject will be deemed to be within a 
hypoglycemic steady state.  
After the th ird confirmatory reading, if plasma glucose is < 42 mg/dL 
(<2.33 mmol/L), the procedure will be terminated, study glucagon will NOT be administered, and the visit will be rescheduled after a minimum 3 -day wait.   
If plasma glucose is > 54 mg/dL (>2.78 mmol /L) at any of the 3 confirmatory 
readings, IV insulin will be restarted at the rate used prior to the initial plasma glucose < 54 mg/dL being obtained. 
When a state of stabilized insulin -induced hypoglycemia is verified, s ubjects 
will be administered the  randomly assigned dose of either G -Pen glucagon 1 mg 
SC or GlucaGen  Hypokit  1 mg  SC to the abdomen, around the umbilicus at a 
90º angle to the skin.  
Study drug will not be prepared ahead of time.  Rather, preparation of glucagon 
for administration  will begin once the confirmatory plasma glucose reading is 
obtained, i.e., upon a “decision to dose.” 
After  administration of study drug, plasma glucose will be monitored at  5-
minutes intervals for  90 minutes , and afterwards every 30 min utes through 
180 minutes post treatment . 
The induction procedure may elicit symptoms of hypoglycemia. Th erefore , 
subjects will complete a questionnaire regarding hypoglycemia symptoms at the 
start of the hypoglycemia induction period and periodically through180 minutes 
posttreatment .   
After 180 minutes posttreatment , subjects will resume insulin pump therapy, if 
applicable, and will be given a meal.   Subject may be discharged after 180 
minutes posttreatment if their plasma  glucose is  > 100 mg/dL (5.56 mmol/L) 
and if medically stable.   At the Investigator ’s discretion,  subject s’ prescribed  
insulin  regimen  can be restarted,  or the meal can be given sooner, but not earlier 
than 90 minutes post- glucagon  treatment , to prevent hyperglycemia or rebound 
hypoglycemia . 
After a wash -out period of 7 to 28 days, subjects will return to the CRC and the 
study procedures will be repeated with each subject crossed over to the other 
treatment.  After study -related procedures are performed on each of the 
treatment days, subjects will be discharged.  A Follow -Up Visit will be

 10 
Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 conducted 2  to 7 days after administration of the final dose  of study drug  as a 
safety check.  
Tolerability will be assessed by comparing AE  reports between the  G-Pen and 
GlucaGen Hypokit  treatment groups.  In  addition, at the end of each treatment 
period the subjects will complete questionnaires to assess injection site 
discomfort, and the  Investigator  will use a modified Draize scale to evaluate the 
injection sites after  each administration.  
Data management 
and statistical 
analysis: Data will be entered into an electronic Case Report Form  (eCRF) by the study 
site personnel.  Data will be monitored at on -site visits by Xeris personnel or by 
a contract research organization ( CRO ) delegated by  Xeris.   A stand -alone 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written to detail all protocol specified 
analyses. The SAP will take precede nce over the protocol. The primary 
endpoint will be analyzed using an exact test procedure based on the 
conditional distribution for a maximum clinically acceptable non-inferior margin of ≤ 5%.  
Sample Size Determination: For the primary analysis, a failure is recorded if the subject’s plasma glucose 
fails to reach a concentration >70 mg/dL (>3.88 mmol/L) and fails to increase 
by at least 20.0 mg/dL (1.11 mmol/L) within 30 minutes of the decision to 
administ er the dose of glucagon .  The determination of a constant clinically 
non-inferior margin for the cure rate difference is generally difficult in practice 
for a number of reasons.  To alleviate this concern, it has been recommended to use an Odds Ratio of success rates for estimation  because the corresponding 
clinically non- inferior margin on the difference scale is getting small when the 
underlying succ ess rate becomes large and close to 1.  In this study, it is 
expected that the  subject’s recovery (su ccess rate) will be high and approaching 
100%.  Since this is a cross -over design and each subject will serve as his/her 
control, power is improved.  
The sample size was derived for 80% power of detecting non- inferiority with 
respect to the Odds Ratio of subject recovery rates at an alph a of 0.025 under a 
cross -over design. Based on an underlying Odds Ratio of 1.0, and failure rates 
of 0.2 versus 0.25, 111 subjects are required for the study. With an anticipated 10% drop-out rate, the total sample size for the study is 122 randomized subjects.

Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 6. BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
6.1. Indication  
The proposed indication is for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia. 
6.1.1. Background 
The investigational product is glucagon.  Glucagon is a 29 amino-acid polypeptide with a 
molecular weight of 3485 Daltons.  The peptide is secreted by the alpha cells of the islets of 
Langerhan’s in the pancreas, and functions as an anti- hypoglycemic agent and a gastrointestinal 
motility inhibitor.  A single glucagon g ene encodes a larger proglucagon biosynthetic precursor 
in mammals.  Tissue -specific processing of proglucagon gives rise to glucagon, and to glicentin, 
oxyntomodulin, glucagon -like peptide-1 ( GLP -1), and glucagon -like peptide -2 (GLP -2).  As a 
natural (non-steroid) hormone synthesized in the pancreatic islet cells, it binds to glucagon 
receptors in the liver, causing liver cells to convert glycogen polymers into glucose molecules.  
The cloned glucagon receptor encodes a 485 amino acid protein with a predict ed molecular 
weight of 54,962 Daltons [ Jelinek ], which signals through both adenylate cyclase and 
intracellular calcium with a  concentration at which a 50% effect is observed ( EC 50) of ~ 1 nM 
[Wakelam ].   
Historically glucagon is being used as rescue therapy for severe hypoglycemia.  One of the main 
complications of diabetes treatment  with insulin is the emergence of hypoglycemia, and the 
absolute or relative excess of therapeutic insulin is the determinant of risk.  Hypoglycemia in 
diabetes is defined by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) as “all episodes of abnormally 
low plasma  glucose concentration that expose the individual to potential harm” [ ADA], and 
presents as diaphoresis, pallor, nausea, palpitations, tremors, and anxiety.  If hypoglycem ia 
becomes severe, symptoms may then include confusion, abnormal behavior, blurred vision, 
psychomotor abnormalities, loss of consciousness, seizures, and coma [ DCCT/EDIC) Study 
Research Group ].  Recent reports have found that from 6% to 10% of deaths of patients with 
type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1D) are attributable to hypoglycemia [ Skrivarhaug , U.K. 
Hypoglycaemia Study Group].  The ADA Workgroup recommends that patients with drug-
treated diabetes (insulin secretagogue or insulin) become concerned about developing 
hypoglycemia at a plasma glucose concentration of ≤70 mg/ dL (3.9 mmol/L) [ ADA].  
Therapy  with insulin causes hypoglycemia during the course of established T1D , and 
progressively more frequently over time in type 2 diabetes mellitus  (T2D).  The U.K.  
Hypoglycemia Study Group reported an incidence of 110 severe hypoglycemic episodes per 
100 patient -years in patients with T1D treated with insulin for < 5 years, and an incidence of 320 
episodes per 100 patient -years in those with T1D treated for > 15 years [ U.K. Hypoglycaemia 
Study Group].  Type 1 diabetics suffer an average of two symptomatic hypoglycemic events per week , and a severe, temporarily disabling event approximately once a year [ McLeod ].  Insulin-
using T2D  typically have several hypoglycemic episodes in a given year, one t o two  of these 
being severe episodes.  There are currently approximately 1.4 million T1D patients and 3.8 million insulin -using T2D patients in the United States ( US), as reported by the US Center 
for Disease Control [ CDC ].  On average, the total insulin-using patient population experiences 
about 3 million severe hypoglycemic events per year.   
XSGP -304 Clinical Protocol   
G-Pen (glucagon injection)   
 22 
Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 The ADA recommends that all insulin - and sulfonylurea- using diabetics carry gluc agon 
emergency kits (GEKs) and use glucagon as first line therapy in the event of a severe 
hypoglycemic event  [ADA].  However , a recent survey indicates that only approximately  30% of 
the insulin -using diabetic patients carry GEKs [ Close Concerns ].  The current standard of care 
for severe hypoglycemia is an injection of glucagon.  Administration of glucagon with current products (i.e. Lilly Glucagon  for Injection, and Novo GlucaGen
®) is a 9-step process including 
assembly of the kit, aqueous reconstitution of the powdered glucagon, and manual administration of the dose [ Glucagon, Novo GlucaGen].   
6.1.2. Rationale 
Patients with diabetes frequently develop defective regulatory responses to hypog lycemia 
associated with reduced or absent glucagon responses.  This is an important clinical problem, as 
current diabetes management with intensive insulin regimens usually increases the risk and 
frequency of severe hypoglycemic events  that may require the rapeutic intervention. 
In response to the unmet medical need for a simple and ready- to-use (RTU) glucagon for 
episodes of severe hypoglycemia, Xeris Pharmaceuticals , Inc.  (Xeris ) is developing a glucagon 
rescue pen referred to as  “G-Pen”, which utilize s Xeris’ biocompatible, non-aqueous 
peptide/protein reformulation technology.  This technology has enabled Xeris to create a 
concentrated, low volume, stable glucagon formulation, pre-mixed and pre-loaded into a 
prefilled syringe and auto -injector pen.  This creates a product with a number of advantageous 
features, which include the follow ing:  a RTU  treatment with no reconstitution required; precise 
and rapid dosing; a hidden needle; enhanced portability and availability due to room- temperature 
stability , providing a superior alternative to currently marketed treatments.  
6.2. Non-Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology Experience with 
Glucagon  
Native glucagon for injection (bovine, porcine origin) was approved for use in humans in 1960 [FDA CDER #1 ].  The 29- amino  acid sequence of pancreatic glucagon is identical in humans, 
cows, pigs, dogs, and rats, and is also conserved in biosynthetic versions of glucagon [ Eistrup ].  
Glucagon for injection (recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid [ rDNA] origin) was approved in 
1998 and is currently the drug substance identified in two approved New Drug Applications 
(NDAs ) ([NDA 20 -928] and [NDA 20-918]).  Complete NDA-required pharmacology and 
toxicology data have been reviewed and accepted by the United States Food and Drug 
Administration  (FDA ), as described in Lilly Glucagon  (glucagon for injection ) and Novo 
GlucaGen (glucagon for injection) labeling [ Glucagon, Novo GlucaGen]. Novo GlucaGen 
Hypokit 1 mg is sold in the U.K. and European Union ( EU) under marketing authorization 
PL 04668/0027, and pharmacology and toxicology information have been submitted to and 
accepted by European Medicines Agency (EMA)  [Novo Hypokit ]. 
As Xeris  G-Pen drug product is produced by solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), which also 
conserves the glucagon peptide sequence, the rDNA glucagon information is pertinent to the 
development of G- Pen for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia.  A summary of this  information 
can be found in current G- Pen Investigator’s Brochure, which is  provided to each Investigator 
participating in this study.

Information on the nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology of G- Pen 
(glucagon  injection) is provided in the current G- Pen Investigator’s Brochure.  
6.3. Description and Composition of Drug Product  
Synthetic glucagon is the drug subst ance in G- Pen.  Glucagon c urrent Good Manufacturing 
Practice ( GMP ) grade drug product is manufactured, packaged and released by Bachem AG 
(Bubendorf, Switzerland), conforms with United States pharmacopeia ( USP) standards and has a 
Type II Drug Master File filed with the FDA.  G-Pen is a sterile subcutaneous  (SC) injectable 
non-aqueous formulation of glucagon for treatment of severe hypoglycemia.  G- Pen delivers 
1 mg of glucagon, with trehalose and dimethyl sulfoxide  (DMSO) as excipients.  The drug 
product is stored at controlled room temperature (20 to 25°C [68° to 77°F]) prior to use.   
G-Pen is supplied in a 1 mL long Crystal Zenith® pre-filled cyclic olefin polymer syringe with 
Flurotec® coated plunger.  The pre- filled syringe is loaded into a Molly® single -use, disposable 
auto-injector from SHL Group, and is packaged in a sealed poly/ foil pouch. 
6.4. Clinical Experience with Glucagon  
Glucagon has a long history of medical use in the US and EU and is currently marketed by Eli 
Lilly & Co. in the US and Cana da as Glucagon (Glucagon Injection [rDNA origin]), and by 
Novo Nordisk in the US, Canada, and EU as GlucaGen® HypoKit®, both reference listed drugs 
(RLD ) at a dose of 1 mg per injection for treatment of severe hypoglycemia.  Glucagon has a 
rapid onset of a ction and an extremely short half -life, and its safety, efficacy , and clinical 
pharmacology have been well established  since it was first approved for use in humans in 1960 
[FDA CDER #2 ]. 
Xeris has completed  eight  clinical studies using G-Pen, which include the following:  A Phase 1 
bioequivalence study of G- Pen auto -injector (Configuration A) and G- Pen manual syringe 
(Configuration B), 4 Phase 2 exploratory studies, a Phase 3 study in pediatric subjects with T1D, and 2 Phase 3 studies in adults with T1D.   
Phase 1  Study X SGP-101 was a randomized, open- label, two -way crossover bioequivalence 
(BE) and safety study in healthy subjects.  The study involved two treatment visits scheduled 
3 to 7 days apart.  Subjects were randomly assigned to a treatment sequence to receive G -Pen 
glucagon 1 mg SC via Configuration A (auto -injector [AI]) or Configuration B (prefilled syringe 
[PFS]).  Both configurations were administered to the abdomen around the umbilicus.  Each treatment visit was preceded by an overnight stay in the clinical study center.  PK analyses 
performed on plasma glucagon area under the concentration versus time curve from time 0 to 
240 minutes (AUC
(0-240)) and  maximum observed concentration (C max) in healthy subjects 
administered Xeris glucagon 1 mg SC in the abdomen via Configuration A and Configuration B satisfied the bioequivalence ( BE) test criterion and  establish ed PK bioequivalence.  
Pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses performed on plasma glucose AUC

XSGP -304 Clinical Protocol   
G-Pen (glucagon injection)   
 24 
Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 were generally safe and  well tolerated; safety findings were generally similar between the two 
administration groups. 
Phase 2 safety/efficacy S tudy XSGP -201 demonstrated that a 1 mg SC injection of Glucagon 
RTU was therapeutically equivalent to Lilly G lucagon for Injection 1 mg, when administered to 
healthy subjects.  There were no serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (A Es) were 
gener ally mild in nature and similar to the known effects of rescue doses of glucagon.  The most 
commonly reported AE was injection site pain, the incidence of which was significantly higher 
in the Xeris 0.5 mg and Xeris 1 mg groups compared with the Lilly Gluc agon  1 mg group.  
However, edema and erythema at the injection site occurred infrequently and did not vary 
significantly with treatment.   
Phase 2 Study XSGP -202 was an open -label crossover study in adult T1D subject s that explored 
the use of Glucagon RTU at doses of 0.5 and 1 mg in the treatment of insulin-induced 
hypoglycemia .  All subjects had a positive response with complete resolution of symptoms by 30 
minutes after injection for  both treatments.   AEs were generally mild and corresponded to known 
effects of rescue doses of glucagon.  A single episode of vasovagal syncope was observed 
approximately 2 ¼ hours after treatment, which the investigator deemed to meet the definition of 
an SAE as an important medical event.  The attending investigator felt this event was attributable 
at least in part to the study procedures, which included a post- study meal that was consumed 
about 90 minutes after treatment.  There were no other clinically significant safety findings I this study.  
Phase 2 Study XSGO-201evaluate d micro -doses of Glucagon RTU administered with an 
OmniPod
® infusion pump and equivalent doses of reconstituted GlucaGen in T1D subjects.  
Micro -doses of Glucagon RTU (0.3 to 2.0 μg/kg) demonstrated comparable PK and efficacy to 
GlucaGen as discrete SC inf usions with an OmniPod pump.  All treatments were well tolerated, 
no SAEs were observed with either product and AE s were generally of mild severity.  Well -
defined erythema and edema were the two most common adverse events and they occurred more frequently with Glucagon RTU.  Most observations of edema and erythema were mild and transient.  
Phase 2 S tudy XSMP -202 compared the safety and efficacy of oral glucose tablets to mini-doses 
(0.15 and 0.3 mg) of Xeris Glucagon RTU SC  administered to T1D subject s as 
treatment/prevention of mild to moderate hypoglycemia.   A total of 20 subjects between the ages 
of 18 and 64 years were randomized in this 3- week, 2 -period cross-over study with a 3- week 
follow-up period during which subjects had free choice of using either Glucagon RTU or glucose tablets to treat/prevent hypoglycemia.   Glucagon RTU successfully treated  mild-to-moderate 
hypoglycemia and may be a useful alternative to treatment with oral carbohydrate.   All 
treatments were well tolerated, no SAEs were observed and A Es were generally of mild severity 
and consisted primarily of pain or tingling at the injection site.  O
bservations of edema and 
erythema were generally mild and transient.  Nausea occurred only at the higher dose of 0.3 mg, in 
one-third of the subjects. 
Phase 3 Study XSGP -301 was a non -inferiority, randomized, single- blind, 2-way crossover 
comparative efficacy and safety trial in adult subjects with T1D.  The study  demonstrated that G-
Pen 1 mg SC was comparable to Lilly Glucagon via an intent- to-treat analysis.  The study 
demonstrated that administration of G- Pen and Lilly Glucagon either increased plasma glucose 
≥ 20 mg/dL at 30 minutes post- injection or resulted in a plasma glucose >  70 mg/dL within 30 
XSGP -304 Clinical Protocol

Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 minutes post-injection.  Symptomatic relief of hypoglycemia after glucagon injections was 
similar for G —Pen compared with Lilly Glucagon, based on the trends observed across average 
hypoglycemia symptom questionnaire scores.  Symptom scores did not differ significantly 
between treatment groups for  average autonomic, neuroglycopenic, or overall symptoms.  As 
expected for both Glucagon RTU and Lilly glucagon, as plasma glucose levels increased, mean 
hypoglycemia symptom scores decreased with peak symptom relief occurring approximately 30 minutes post injection.   G-Pen injections to the abdomen around the umbilicus demonstrated 
faster absorption when compared to injections to the outer arm and outer leg.  Both G-Pen and Lilly Glucagon were generally safe and well tolerated and safety findings were generally similar between the two treatment groups.  The most common treatment- emergent adverse event 
(TEAE) was nausea, which was reported more frequently for subjects after G- Pen treatment 
compared with Lilly Glucagon.  
Phase 3 Study XSGP-303 was a non- infer iority, randomized, single- blind, 2-way crossover 
comparative efficacy and safety study in adult subjects with T1D.  The study demonstrated that 
G-Pen 1 mg SC was non- inferior to Lilly Glucagon via an intent- to-treat analysis.  Overall, this 
study further supports the conclusion that G- Pen 1 mg SC reverses severe hypoglycemia in a 
reliable manner that is comparable to Lilly Glucagon 1 mg; and confirmed the results for Symptomatic relief of hypoglycemia after glucagon injection reported in Study XSGP -301.  Both 
G-Pen and Lilly Glucagon treatments were generally safe and well tolerated and safety findings 
were generally similar between the two treatment groups.  There were no SAEs or severe A Es 
reported in either treatment group.  The most common TEAE was naus ea, which was reported 
more frequently in subjects administered G-Pen compared to Lilly Glucagon. 
Phase 3 Study XSGP -302 was an efficacy and safety study in pediatric subjects with T1D that 
evaluated PK and PD.  The study included subjects age 2 to < 18 ye ars administered G -Pen 
0.5 mg, with subjects age 12 to < 18 years also receiving G- Pen 1 mg after a wash -out period.  
Statistically significant increases from baseline in mean plasma glucose were observed in each 
age category  (p<0.001 for all groups) at 30 minutes after  administration of G-Pen. Based on the 
results of the XSGP-201 study, the transition to the adult dose of G- Pen (0.5 mg to 1 mg) i s 
recommended  at 40 to 45 kg, corresponding to the average weight at approximately 12 years of 
age.  Age categories  were generally similar with respect to  in mean plasma glucose area under 
the concentration vs time curve from time 0 to 90 minutes ( AUC
(0-90)), Cmax, and  tmax.  Overall, 
G-Pen was generally safe and well tolerated in each of the 3 pediatric age groups.  There were no 
AEs leading to discontinuation and no SAEs were reported in this study.  Nausea and vomiting were the most commonly reported treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) in this study and 
were expected for subjects receiving glucagon.  While the incidences of injection site discomfort, 
erythema, and edema were relatively high (at 10 and 30  minutes post G-Pen administration), pain 
and modified Draize Scale scores were at the low end of the assessment scales.

7.1. Study Overview  
This is a multi-center, randomized, active-controlled, single-blind, two- way crossover efficacy 
and safety in -patient  study in subjects  with T1D.  The study involves two clinical research center 
(CRC) visits scheduled 7 to 28 days apart .  Subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment 
sequence for which they will receive G -Pen glucagon 1 mg during one period and GlucaGen  
Hypokit 1 mg during the other.  Each daytime visit will be preceded by an overnight stay in the 
CRC.  Subjects  will complete the screening procedures up to 30 days before randomization to 
determine their eligibility before enrollment in to the treatment phase.  Subjects not meeting 
eligib ility criteria may be rescreened after a 30 -day wait.  
During t he evening prior to each in -patient  study visit, subjects will be admitted for an overnight 
stay between 6 and 8 pm.  At the Investigator ’s discretion, plasma  glucose may be assessed 
periodicall y during the overnight stay via CGM, Yellow Springs Instruments ( YSI) model 2300 
or 2900 or an FDA/ CE/Health Canada cleared blood glucose meter  (hereafter, simply “glucose 
meter”) .  Subjects will be asked to refrain from consuming alcohol during the day prior to the 
overnight stay.  Upon arrival in the evening , plasma glucose will be measured by a blood glucose 
meter and confirmed to be ≤  350 mg/dL  (≤ 19.44 mmol/L) , or the visit will be rescheduled . 
At the CRC, subjects will receive a standardized dinner meal as per the usual practices of the 
clinical site.  Subjects should complete dinner before 9 pm.  Subjects should follow their usual, 
prescribed insulin regimen at dinner time under the supervision of a study nurse, and will 
continue their usual, prescr ibed insulin regimen until midnight per PI discretion. 
Subjects will be instructed to fast starting at midnight, at which point an intravenous (IV) 
catheter will be placed, and maintenance fluids will be administered.  Overnight, blood glucose 
will be conf irmed by YSI. BGM or CGM  as necessary ; these data will be maintained in the 
source documents only.  At a minimum, blood glucose will be assessed by BGM/YSI (not CGM) 
at midnight, 3 am, and 6 am, with ±30 minutes for these measurements, which will be entered into the EDC.  
After midnight, the Investigator should optimize plasma  glucose within a target range of 80 to 
150 mg/dL (4.44 to 8.33 mmol/L) through the administration of IV /SC insulin and/or IV/oral 
glucose.  If operational considerations at a site  preclude IV administration of insulin  overnight, 
no catheter will be placed, and oral g lucose tablets and the subject’s own insulin infusion pump 
will be used  to optimize blood glucos e within a target  range of 80 to 150 mg/ dL (4.44 to 8.33 
mmol/L) .  This range is considered a target only, and values outside of this range will not be 
considered protocol deviations.   
In the morning of the inpatient study visit, each  subject’s plasma glucose will be measured and 
verifie d to be within the range of 70 to 270 mg/dL (3.89 to 15.0 mmol/L) to confirm their  
eligibility  for continuation to the insulin induction procedure.  If this criterion  is not met, the  visit 
will be rescheduled after a minimum 3 day wait.  
Subject s will continue to fast  during the morning of the procedure and another IV catheter for 
blood sampling will be inserted in the ir contralateral  arm. Ideally , the sampling IV catheter 
should be placed in a vein within the antecubital fossa.  The hand used for blood sampling will 
be kept warm by use of a heated -hand box to increase blood flow to achieve “arterialized”

Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 samples.  The subject will be kept supine and the abdomen and torso will be covered  under a 
blanket to maintain warmth .  
The baseline euglycemic steady state period will begin when the plasma glucose is confirmed to 
be within the range of 70  to 270 mg/dL (3.89 to 15.0 mmol/L).  IV insulin will be administered 
to maintain the plasma glucose concentration within  the range of 75 to 115 mg/dL  (4.17 to 
6.83 mmol/L)  for 30 minutes. If the plasma  glucose has been maintained with in the range of 
75 to 115 mg/dL  (4.17 to 6.83 mmol/L)  for at least 30 minutes and the insulin infusion rate 
varies  no more than ±20%, the induction procedure may commence.  
During the induction procedure, the subject  will enter a state of hypoglycemia through the 
administration of regular insulin diluted in norma l saline (see Section 7.2), within a controlled 
and monitored setting.  Use of  the insulin dose adjustment algorithm will be facilitated by real 
time data capture, allowing Sponsor personnel to monitor the induction procedures virtually in real time.  
The combination of one or more IV bolus doses of insulin along with continuous IV infus ion of 
insulin will be used to gradually decrease a subject’s plasma glucose to a target < 54.0 mg/dL  
(< 3 mmol/L) .  As per Section 11.2, all plasma glucose levels will be based on the average of two 
readings taken via YSI glucose analyzer at each time point.   Plasma glucose measurements will 
be taken every 1 0±5 minutes while glucose is >  65.0 mg/dL (>  3.61 mmol/L) and every 
5±2 minutes once plasma glucose is ≤  65.0 mg/dL (≤ 3.61 mmol/L) . 
Once the initial plasma glucose measurement < 54.0 mg/dL (<  3 mmol/L) is achieved, the IV 
insulin infusion will be returned to the rate established at the end of the baseline euglycemia steady state period.  After 5 minutes, the IV insulin infusion will be stopped, and up to three 
confirmatory plasma glucose reading s will be taken at subsequent 5- minute intervals to 
determine whether a hypoglycemic steady state has been reached,  which is defined as a 
confirmat ory plasma glucose value ≥ 42 mg/dL (≥  2.33 mmol/L) and < 54 mg/dL (< 3 mmol/L) 
with an 8- minute linearly extrapolated value for plasma glucose ≥ 42 mg/dL (≥  2.33 mmol/L). 
If a hypoglycemic steady state is not documented after any of three confirmatory readings, and plasma glucose is < 42 mg/dL (<2.33 mmol/L) after the third confirmatory reading , the 
procedure will be terminated, study glucagon will NOT be administered, and the visit will be rescheduled after a minimum 3 -day wait.  At the Investigator’s discretion, the subject should be 
treated with IV glucose or oral carbohydrates, it should be verified that the subject achieved a euglycemic state and is medic ally stable pri or to discharge. 
If plasma glucose is > 54 mg/dL (> 3 mmol/L) at any of the 3 confirmatory readings, IV insulin 
will be restarted at the 120% of the rate used prior to the initial plasma glucose < 54 mg/dL being obtained. 
If a hypoglycemic  state is verified  by either the first, second, or third confirmatory reading, the 
subject will be eligible to receive either G-Pen or GlucaGen Hypokit in one of the randomized 
treatment sequences shown in Table 3 .  The time of th e Investigator’s “decision to dose” will be 
documented.

Plasma  glucose levels will be monitored for 180 minutes post-dosing.  It is believed that plasma  
glucose < 54 mg/dL  (< 3 mmol/L)  will be low enough to generate neuroglycopenic and 
autonomic symptoms in most subjects, yet high enough (i.e., > 4 2 mg/dL  [> 2.33 mmol/L)] ) to 
avoid the impairment of consciousness.  Consequently, subjects will complete a questionnaire 
about symptoms of h ypoglycemia [ Nermoen ] during the hypoglycemia induction phase, and for 
180 minutes after treatment with glucagon.  
After a wash -out period of 7 to 28 days, subjects will return to the CRC and the procedure will 
be repeated with each subject crossed over to the other treatment.  
After study -related procedures are performed on each of the treatment days  (see Table 5 ), 
subjects will be discharged after consuming a meal  as per each site’s usual practice.  A follow-up 
visit as a safety check will be conducted 2 to 7 days after  administration of the final dose of 
study drug.   
The last subject last visit (LSLV) for each site is defined as the date the last subject completes 
the Follow- Up Visit (Visit 4), with the understanding that final review by the Investigator may 
be delayed  a few days to allow for receipt of final lab results.  The end of the trial is the date of 
the LSLV for the last site.  
7.2. Hypoglycemia Induction Procedure and Justification  
The most commonly used hypoglycemia insulin induction method cited in the literature 
[Nermoen ] involves constant insulin infusion rates many-fold above normal basal infusion rates.  
As hepatic glucose production is determined by the glucagon to insulin ratio, this procedure may 
not create realistic circumstances for evaluating the effectiveness of glucagon in raising blood 
glucose.  A predecessor study (XSGP -301), therefore, utilized a comparatively lower rate of 
insulin infusion at 1 to 2 times the normal basal rate, combined with push of an IV bolus dose of 
insulin derived from the subject’s own self-reported glucose correction factor.  About 30% of the procedures performed in Study XSGP -301 resulted in plasma glucose < 40 mg/d L 
(< 2.22 mmol/L) .  To get more precision in achieving a steady state of plasma glucose below 
50 mg/d L (2.78 mmol/L), individual procedure data from the Study XSGP -301 were fitted to a 
model of insulin action allowing identification of opportunities for algorithm enhancements.  The 
algorithm was modified accordingly and tested in the model of the procedures representing a broad spectrum of subjects, including the two extremes of insulin sensitivity that were associated 
with low plasma glucose in Study XSGP -303. The algorithm was further refined for use in the 
current study based on experiences in the XSGP-303 trial.  
Hypoglycemia Induction Procedure 
The evening before treatments subjects will be admitted to the CRC and follow the procedures 
described in  Table 5 .  
XSGP -304 Clinical Protocol   
G-Pen (glucagon injection)   
 29 
Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 Baseline Euglycemic Steady State 
Prior to starting the hypoglycemia induction procedure, the subject must have stable plasma 
glucose for at least 30 minutes  at 95±20 mg/d L (75 to 115 mg/dL [4.17 to 6.38 mmol/L]) and a 
stable IV insulin infusion rate varying no more than ±20% during which plasma glucose must be 
measured at least every 15 ±2 minutes.  
Induction Start  
For the induction, the starting plasma glucose level will be determined as the average of  the last 
three YSI measurements taken during the baseline steady state period  (i.e., start of baseline, next 
after 15 minutes, end of baseline after 30- minute baselin e confirmation period).  The following 
procedures will then be performed : 
1. Subjects will continue the IV insulin infusion at the final rate of the baseline euglycemic steady state.   
2. Subjects then will be given an initial IV bolus push dose of regular insulin diluted in saline:  
a. The dose will be calculated as 75% of the dose estimated to reduce plasma glucose 
from the subject’s starting plasma glucose level to 5 4 mg/dL (3 mmol/L) based on the 
subject’s self -reported glucose correction factor.  This dose will be referred to as “1 
bolus (i.e., full bolus dose)” subsequently.  The Investigator  may use discretion to 
decrease the amount of the calculated bolus dose based upon the subject’s insulin 
sensitivity factor .  However, the Investigator  is not allowed t o increase the amount of 
the bolus dose. 
b. Plasma glucose will be measured every 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the current 
plasma glucose value (see Table 4). 
c. The first insulin adjustment will be made no earlier than 20 minutes after the initial bolus but will otherwise follow the directions for insulin adjustments shown in Table 4. 
The Investigator may override the insulin dosing algorithm at their discretion. Note: investigator 
does not have discretion to give bolus doses once plasma glucose is 65 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L) or 
less (see numbers 3.b.i and 4.b.i below). 
When plasma glucose is > 80 mg/dL  (> 4.44 m mol/L ), insulin adjustments should not be made 
more frequently than every 1 0 minutes. When plasma glucose is ≤  80 mg/dL  (≤ 4.44 mmol/L ), 
the minimum time between adjustments to decrease, terminate or re-start insulin is either 10 or 5 
minutes, as indicated in Table 4. 
1. While plasma glucose is > 80 mg/dL ( > 4.4 mM /L): 
a. Measure plasma glucose every 10 minutes.  
b. When 10 minutes have passed from the last insulin dose adjustment: 
i. Bolus: If the rate of plasma glucose decrease is < 0.15 mg/dL∙min (< 0.01 
mM/min), then an additional 1 bolus (full bolus dose) should be 
administer ed.

(< 0.03 mM/ min), then the insulin infusion rate should be increased by 
20%. 
2. While plasma glucose is 66  to 80 mg/dL (3.66-4.4 mM/L): 
a. Measure plasma glucose every  5 minutes.  
b. When 10 minutes have passed from the last insulin dose adjustment: 
i. Bolus: If the rate of plasma glucose decrease is < 0.15 mg/dL∙min 
(< 0.01 mM/min), then an additional 1/2 bolus (half-bolus dose) should be 
administered.  
ii. Infusion Rate:  
1) If the ra te of plasma glucose decrease is < 0. 33 mg/dL∙min

increased by 20%.  
2) If the rate of plasma glucose decrease is > 0.5 mg/dL∙ min 
(> 0.03 mM/ min), then the insulin infusion rate should be 
decreased by 2 0%. 
3. While plasma glucose is 61  to 65 mg/dL (3. 39 to  3.61 mM):  
a. Measure plasma glucose at least every 5 minutes.  
b. When 10 minutes have passed from the last insulin dose adjustment: 
i. Bolus: not allowed. 
ii. Infusion Rate: 
1) If the rate of plasma glucose decrease is < 0.25 mg/d L∙min 
(< 0.01 mM/ min), then the insulin infusion rate should be 
increased by 2 0%. 
2) If the rate of plasma glucose decrease is > 0.33 mg/d L∙min 
(> 0.02 mM/ min), then the insulin infusion rate should be 
decreased by 20%. 
4. While plasma glucose is 5 4 to 60 mg/dL (3 to  3.33  mM):  
a. Measure plasma glucose at least every 5 minutes.  
b. When 10 minutes have passed from last insulin adjustment:  
i. Bolus: not allowed. 
ii. Infusion Rate: 
1) If the rate of plasma glucose decrease is < 0.15 mg/d L∙min 
(< 0.008 mM/ min), then the insulin infusion rate should be:  
a. Increased by 20%, or

Note:  This escalation in rate can be performed every 
5 minutes until the rate of decrease is > 0.15 mg/dL∙hr 
(> 0.008 mM/hr) 
3) If the rate of plasma glucose decrease is greater than 0.25 up to 0.33 mg/dL∙min ( >0.014 - 0.02 mM/min), then the insulin infusion 
rate should be decreased 20%.  
4) If the rate of plasma glucose decrease is greater than 0.33 up to 0.50 mg/dL∙min (>0.002 - 0.03 mM/min), then the insulin infusion 
rate should be decreased 50%. 
5) If the rate of plasma glucose decrease is > 0.5 mg/dL∙min (> 0.03 mM/min), then the insulin infusion rate should be stopped.  
After 5 min utes, the insulin infusion should be restarted at the rate 
used at the end of the baseline period.  
5. If the plasma glucose is < 54 mg/dL (<  3 mM), th en the IV insulin infusion should be 
returned to the baseline insulin infusion rate used at the end of the baseline period  for 
5 minutes , and then stopped. 
Induction Termination 
At any time, the induction procedure may be terminated at the Investigator’s discretion.  If the 
procedure is terminated, appropriate measures (oral or IV glucose) will be administered at the Investigator’s discretion.  If a subject exhibits signs of coma or convulsions, a IV bolus dose of  
dextrose will be given  per standard of practice.  Signs and symptoms should be monitored, and if 
the subject’s condition fails to improve in a timely manner, additional dextrose or other medical 
interventions may be give n at the Investigator’s discretion. 
Note: Study glucagon should NOT be administered as hypoglycemia rescue in this context.  
Euglycemia will be confirmed and the subject should be medically stabilized per Investigator discretion before being released.  The treatment visits should be rescheduled after a minimum 3-day wait.  
If an SAE occurs during hypoglycemia induction, the procedure will end, and IV insulin will be safely withdrawn.  Causality should be fully assessed by both the Investigator and the Sponsor. 
Note: subjects will undergo a maximum of 4 hypoglycemia inductions in this study to achieve 
two successful procedures.

As described in Section  7.1 , administration of study glucagon is only permitted if a subject 
meets the criteria for a hypoglycemic steady state. Administration of study glucagon to a subject 
not in a hypoglycemic stead y state will be deemed a major protocol violation.  
At 30 minutes post- glucagon administration, if a subject fails to achieve an increase of plasma 
glucose of at least 20 mg/dL (1.11 mmol/L), appropriate measures (oral or IV glucose) will be taken  at the Investigator ’s discre tion. 
Post-administration of study glucagon, if a subject exhibits signs of coma or convulsions, a IV 
bolus dose of dextrose will be given per standard of practice.  Signs and symptoms should be monitored, and if the subject’s condition fails to improve in a timely manner , additional dextrose 
or other medical intervention s may be given at the Investigator’s discretion. 
Note: A second dose of study glucagon should NOT be administered as hypoglycemia rescue i n this context.  
Euglycemia will be confirmed and the subject should be medically stabilized per Investigator 
discretion  before being released.  If applicable, completion of a subsequent treatment visit will be 
at the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor.

study staff in the Dose Administration form in the electronic data capture ( EDC ) system.   
8.4. Subject Numbers  
Subjects will be screened, and if eligible , enrolled and eventually randomized for the study.  All 
screened subjects will be entered in the EDC.  As each subject is added to the EDC system, they 
will be assigned a Screening number, which will consist of a unique 2- digit site code (starting 
with 01) and a unique 2- digit sequential number (starting with 01 at each site) indicating the 
sequence at which the subject was screened for eligibility.  This Screening number will remain with the subject through enrollment and randomization, and will be considered their Subject identification ( ID) if randomized into the study.  
Subjects will be eligible for rescreening.  Once laboratory results are obtained and a final determination of eligibility is made, subjects will be contacted to schedule the first treatme nt 
visit.  While immediate re -testing of laboratory results is not allowed, subjects failing to meet 
laboratory- based eligibility criteria may be rescreened for laboratory- based eligibility after a 
30 day wait.   If this occurs, the subject will maintain th e same Screening number , but will have 
all eligibility reviewed and reconfirmed prior to enrollment.

randomized, the subject will be analyzed for the study.  Each subject will receive a single SC  
injection to the abdomen around the umbilicus on each of the two treatment days, with a period 
of 7 to 28 days between treatment 1 and treatment 2 .   
9.2. Blinding  
For this study, the subject but not the Investigator will be blinded  (single -blind design).  The 
G-Pen 1 mg device makes a series of two audible clicks when the dose is administered.  To help 
ensure blinding, the subject will wear headphones that play music to mask sound during dosing 
procedures.  The subject’s ability to see the injection equipment and procedure will be obstructed 
by use of a blindfold placed prior to dosing.  The subj ect will be instructed not to talk with the 
study staff about their impression of which product he/she received at a visit until the end of the 
second treatment sequence.  At which time, the subject will be asked to guess what their first 
treatment was, an d what their second treatment was from the choices of “Xeris Glucagon, G-Pen, 
administered by auto -injector ” or “Comparator Glucagon, GlucaGen Hypokit, administered by 
needle and syringe”.  The subject’s responses will be recorded in the e lectronic Case Report 
Form  (eCRF ) for the Subject Study Drug Assignment Questionnaire (see Appendix 5).  
In the event that a subject is  inadvertently unblinded during one or both of the treatment 
sequences , the investigator will note the event as a protocol violation, and the subject will be 
allowed to continue further study treatments  as per the protocol.   
9.3. Drug Supplies  
9.3.1. Drug Product Form ulation and Packaging 
Xeris G- Pen is a non-aqueous, injectable liquid formulation of glucagon.  The G-Pen drug 
product consists of 1 mg synthetic glucagon peptide dissolved in a primary DMSO solvent, with 
trehalose added as a stabilizing excipient.  G -Pen drug product is filled into West 
Pharmaceutical’s 1 mL long Crystal Zenith® cyclic olefin polymer (plastic) pre- filled syringe 
with a Flurotec® coated plunger.  The pre- filled syringe is loaded into a n SHL Molly® single -use, 
disposable auto-injector, and packaged in a sealed poly/ foil pouch.  The drug product is stored at 
controlled room temperature (20 to 25°C [68° to 77°F]) prior to use. 
The G -Pen drug product is manufactured under c urrent GMP by Pyramid Laboratories, Inc. 
(Costa Mesa, CA), and packaged under current GMP by SHL Group (Deerfield Beach, FL), both 
contract manufacturers for Xeris.

G-Pen (glucagon injection)   
 38 
Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 9.3.2. GlucaGen Hypokit for Injection  
GlucaGen Hypokit (Novo Nordisk) will be purchased commercially  and provided by Xeris.  The 
glucagon will be stored at the C RC pharmacy according to labeled storage conditions. 
9.3.3. Preparation, Dispensing and Administration 
G-Pen will be supplied as 0.2 mL of non-aqueous solution in a plastic Crystal Zenith 1 mL long 
syringe loaded into a Molly disposable AI .  Subcutaneous administration will be performed by a 
qualified CRC staff member who has read the written Instructions for Use provided by Xeris.  
In the case of GlucaGen Hypokit , a new vial of lyophilized glucagon will be fully reconstituted  
immediately prior to abdominal administration  using 1 mL of sterile diluent provided in the 
commercial kit as per the GlucaGen Hypokit Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and 
Prescribing Instructions [Novo Hypokit ].  
Study drug will be administered according to the randomization schedule accessed in the EDC 
system  (see 8.3).  R andomization will occur at the start of the induction p rocedure, or about 2 to 
3 hours prior to administration of study drug.  When the I nvestigator believes the hypoglycemia 
induction procedure is approximately 1 hour from completion, a member of the study team will deliver the correct investigational product (IP)  for the visit to the clinic area, making sure to 
maintain subject blinding. 
The s tudy drug s will not be prepared ahead of time.  Instead , preparation of the investigational 
product ( IP) (i.e., re -constitution of GlucaGen  Hypokit ) will begin after  the confirmatory plasma 
glucose reading is obtained, indicat ing that a hypoglycemic  steady state has been achieved, i.e., 
upon a “decision to dose.” 
G-Pen is being developed for SC injection.  The marketed comparator is labeled for both SC and 
intramuscular (IM) injection.  Both products will be administered via the SC  route to the 
abdomen, around the umbilicus. 
The G- Pen auto -injector is made to be pressed against the skin perpendicularly (i.e., at a 90° 
angle) to the injection site.  Th e injection technique for G- Pen will follow printed instructions for 
use (IFU) provided by Xeris. For GlucaGen  Hypokit, the skin should be pinched to avoid an IM injection.  The needle will be 
inserted into the loose tissue under the injection site at a 90° angle and the product injected 
smoothly over 1 to 3 seconds.  Following injection, light pressure should be applied to the injection site, as the needle is withdrawn.  
Prior to administration  of the study drugs, the intended injection site should be steri lized with an 
alcohol wipe and examined to ensure it has a normal appearance and is free from signs of 
inflammation or injury.   The site staff will document the administration act (i.e.  location, study 
product/dose) in the Vision EDC  system . 
9.3.4. Drug Storage and Drug Accountability 
Unless notified otherwise by the Sponsor, all supplied G- Pen auto -injectors and GlucaGen  
Hypokit kits are to be stored at controlled room temperature (20°C to 25°C [68° to 77°F]). Excursions between 15° and 30° C (59° and 86 °F) that are experienced in pharmacies, hospitals, 
XSGP -304 Clinical Protocol    
G-Pen (glucagon injection)   
 39 
Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 and warehouses, and during shipping are allowed. Drug solution should be clear and of a water-
like consistency at time of use.  
The Investigator or an approved member of the study staff will ensure that th e study drugs  are 
stored in a secure area under recommended storage conditions and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. 
The site will maintain appropriate documentation of continuous storage conditions and these 
records will be monitored in an on-going basis by the monitor.  Any deviations in the storage 
conditions must be documented (including minimum and maximum temperature excursion as 
well as estimate of total duration of storage outside the recommended storage conditions).  Such deviations must be communicated to the Sponsor as soon as identified by the site with an 
appropriate course of action taken , regarding the future use of the study drugs,  upon consultation 
with Xeris.  
After administration, used vials of GlucaGen Hypokit should be returned to the kit and stored for accountability, while the syringe is disposed as per each site’s standard practice.  Used G -Pens 
should be returned to the foil pouch, which will be sealed with tape, and stored for 
accountability.  Any devices that fail to function should be handled in a similar  manner , but they 
should also be identified on the pouch label as a failure.  Disposal of the study products should occur away from the subject in a manner that ensures blinding.  
The Investig ator must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss or other 
disposition of the investigational drug products and supplies.  Unused G-Pens and Novo 
GlucaGen Hypo kits will be returned to Xeris.  Used G- Pen auto -injectors will be returned to 
Xeris after accountability is performed during site close -out.  Used GlucaGen  Hypokits and other 
used supplies, will be destroyed  according to local regulation and applicable Xeris standard 
operating procedures ( SOPs ), following accountability by Xeris or its designee. 
9.4. Concomitant Medications  
All subjects must be questioned about concomitant medications at each visit.  Medications taken 
within 4 weeks before Day 1 will be documented in the e CRF.  Any changes to a subject’s 
concomitant medication regimen after the first treatment on Day 1 will also be documented in 
the e CRF.  
Except for  those medications (e.g., warfarin) listed under the exclusion criteria (see Section 8.2) 
and other current investigational agents which are absolutely proscribed, there are no medications that are specifically prohibited during participation in the study.  Subjects should be 
on a stable dose of all concomitant medications for at least 30 days prior to Screening, and they 
will be encouraged to avoid making changes to their concomitant medication regimen during participation in the study.   In addition, Investigators are encouraged to avoid adding to or 
changing a  subject’s  medications during study participation unless deemed medically necessary.

Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 10. STUDY PROCEDURES  
A schedule of assessments for this study is provided below in Table 5.  
10.1. Visit 1 – Screening (Day -3 0 to - 3) 
Subjects will be screened to confirm they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study.  
Prior to completing any screening activities, the Investigator  or study team member will obtain 
informed consent from each subject in accordance with the procedures described in  Section  16.3.  
A copy of the consent/authorization form will be given each subject.  The original will be kept 
by the site for the  source document. 
Subjects will be instructed to complete a Screening Visit at least 3 days (to allow for receipt of 
blood test results), and no more than 30 days prior to the anticipated date of the first Treatment Visit (Day 1 ).  The following evaluations will be completed during the S creening V isit to 
confirm subjects meet eligibility criteria for this study:  
1. Assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria by a study investigator, including a review of 
the subject’s medical history and medications. 
2. Recording of the subject’s insulin correction factor (i.e., the reduction in blood glucose in mg/d L per 1 unit of insulin taken).  
3. Measurement of height and weight (no shoes, lightly clothed). 
4. Physical examination, excluding breast , pelvic, and genitourinary exams.  
5. Performance of a 12 -lead ECG after the subject has completed a 5-minute supine rest. 
6. Assessment of vital signs, including measurement of BP, after a 5- minute seated rest.  
7. Urine drug screen.  Note: At the Investigator’s discretion, s ubjects with a positive result 
will be allowed to participate if the subject reports use of a concomitant medication that 
explains the result (e.g., positive urine test for opiates in a subject reporting use of cough 
syrup containing Dextromethorphan).  
8. Urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential and discussion about study 
requirements regarding contraception. 
9. If applicable, a discussion about study requirements regarding breast feeding. 
10. Collection of venous blood for the following tests as outlined in the Schedule of 
Activities: hemoglobin A1C, c -peptide, complete blood count (without differential), 
metabolic set (including creatinine, liver set, and electrolytes), and screening for HIV, 
HBV and HCV ( Table 7 ).  
11. Gold scale for hypoglycemia unawareness  (Appendix 4).  Note: this is being collected for 
informational purposes only; no scores are considered exclusionary. 
Once laboratory results are obtained and a final determination of eligibility is made, subjects will 
be contacted to schedule the first treatment visit.  While immediate r e-testing of laboratory 
results is not allowed, subjects failing to meet laboratory -based eligibility criteria may be 
rescreened after a 30- day wait.   A single re -screening is permitted, and this re -screening is only 
permissible if the reason for the prior screen failure was for laboratory measurements.  Blood for 
XSGP -304 Clinical Protocol    
G-Pen (glucagon injection)   
 41 
Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 clinical laboratory tests can be redrawn after a 30 -day wait; however, other screening procedures 
do NOT need to be repeated.  If the new clinical laboratory test results meet eligibility, the 
subject may be dosed. Otherwise, the subject is not eligible for dosing or further re- screening.  
10.2. Treatment and Follow -Up Phase  
Subjects will be instructed to eat normal meals during the day but to refrain from alcohol, and to 
follow their usual insulin reg imen prior to their evening clinic arrival.  Subjects will be instructed 
to arrive at the clinic between 6 and 8 pm on Day -1, having not had dinner.  
10.2.1. Visit 2 – Treatment 1 (Day  -1 and Day 1) 
The following procedures will be carried out at V isit 2. 
10.2.1.1. Day -1 
Clinic Arrival  
1. Plasma  glucose (via glucose meter ) will be assessed .  If the result is > 350.0 mg/dL  
(19.44 mmol/L), no further procedures should be performed, and the visit should be 
reschedu led after a minimum 24 -hour wait. 
2. The subject will be questioned regarding any changes in concomitant medications will be 
documented in the e CRF , and it will be confirmed that the subject is not receiving a 
medication that is exclusionary . 
3. Women of childbe aring potential will receive a urine pregnancy test, which must be 
negative before further participation is allowed.  
If it has been more than 30 days since Visit 1 (i.e., the visit is occurring outside of the allowed time window ), venous blood will be coll ected for a repeat of baseline 
hematology and serum chemistry assessments.  However, the visit may continue based on 
qualification at the Screening visit.  
Note: At check -in for Visit 3, venous blood will be collected for a repeat of hematology 
and serum chemistry assessments  as baseline for the first dose of study glucagon.  
4. Full vital signs  will be assessed after a 5 -minute seated rest.  It will be confirmed that the 
subject continues to meet eligibility requirements for SBP and DBP.   Other assessm ents 
of vital signs will be made during the visit as specified in the footnote s to Table 5. 
Evening Meal in Clinic   
1. A standardized healthy meal will be provided to the subject (see Section 7.1) with a goal 
of completion by 9 pm.   
2. The subject should follow their normal prescrib ed regimen for insulin  per PI discretion , 
including meal- time correction, until midnight.

Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 10.2.1.2. Day 1 
Overnight Monitoring  (starting at approximately midnight)   
1. Subjects will be instructed to fast, taking nothing but water and oral glucose tablets  if 
necessary, starting at approximately  midnight and will be monitored for compliance by 
the CRC staff.  
2. An IV catheter will be placed  in one arm , maintenance fluids will be started , and the 
subject’s insulin pump will be discontinued, if applicable.  If use of an overnight IV is not 
possible due to site staffing considerations, use of the subject’s own insulin infusion 
pump or SC  insulin  will be used overnight.  
3. Plasma  glucose will be monitored overnight by CGM, YSI or glucose meter ; these  data 
will be kept in the source documents.  At a minimum, glucose will be assessed by BGM 
or YSI (not CGM) at midnight, 3 am, and 6 am ; these data will be entered into the EDC . 
IV glucose or oral glucose tablets  will be given and/or insulin will be administered by IV 
or infusion pump as necessary to optimize  achieving  plasma  glucose with in a target range 
of 80 to 150 mg/ dL (4.44 to 8.33 mmol/L) .  If the glucose is outside the recommended 
target range, it will not be considered a protocol deviation.  
4. Ideally, about 1 hour prior to the start of the Morning Procedures outlined below, subjects will be transitioned from SC to IV administration of insulin ; any use of IV glucose will 
be discontinued. 
5. If the subject has plasma glucose < 270 mg/dL  (< 15.0 mmol/L) in the morning as 
measured by YSI, then  the subject will be eligible to begin the Morning Procedures. 
Morning Procedures (starting at approximately 6 am)  
1. In the morning, plasma glucose (via YSI) will be assessed, and if > 270.0 mg/dL  
(> 15.0 mmol/L), the visit will be rescheduled after a minimum 3- day wait.   Otherwise, 
the subject will be administered IV insulin to induce a baseline euglycemic steady state.  
2. If not already placed, an IV catheter will be placed for administration of insulin and 
maintenance fluids.  
3. A second IV catheter will be placed for blood sampling, ideally located in a vein within the antecubital fossa.  
The hand used for blood sampling will be kept warm by use of a heated-hand box to increase blood flow and achi eve “arterialized” samples.  Note: The subjects will remain non -caloric 
fasting the morning of the procedure. 
Baseline Euglycemic Steady State (early morning)  
Prior to starting the hypoglycemia induction procedure, the subject must have stable plasma 
gluco se for at least 30 minutes at 95±20 mg/dL  (75 to 115 mg/dL [4.17 to 6.38 mmol/L] ) at a 
stable IV insulin infusion rate varying no more than ±20% during which plasma glucose must be 
measured at least every 15 minutes .

G-Pen (glucagon injection)   
 43 
Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 Hypoglycemia Induction Procedure (following baseline euglycemic steady state)  
Induction Start   
For the induction, the starting plasma glucose level will be determined as the average of 
3 measurements taken over the final 30 minutes of the baseline euglycemic steady state period . 
The following procedures will then be performed : 
1. Subjects will continue the IV insulin infusion at the final rate of the euglycemic steady state.  
2. Subjects will be given an initial IV bolus push dose of regular insulin diluted in saline: 
a. The dose will be calculated as 75% of the dose estimated to reduce plasma glucose 
from the subject’s starting plasma glucose level to 5 4 mg/dL  (3.0 mmol/L)  based on 
the subject’s self -reported glucose correction factor.  This dose will be referred to as 
“1 bolus (full bolus dose)” subsequently. 
b. Plasma glucose will be measured no less frequent ly than every 10 minutes. 
The first insulin adjustment will be no earlier than 20 minutes after the initial bolus but will 
otherwise follow the directions for insulin adjustments shown in Section 7.2 (see also  Table 4).  
Insulin D ose Adjustments   
Insulin dose adjustments will be performed as outlined in Section 7.2 (see also Table 4).  
Randomization 
Once the initial bolus dose of insulin has had time to take effect and the subjects is observed to 
be in a controlled rate of glucose decline, which will generally occur at approximately  30 to 
60 minutes after the beginning of the induction period, the subject will be random ly assigned  to 
receive either G-Pen or GlucaGen  Hypokit in one of the treatment sequences shown  in Table 3 .  
Confirmation of Hypoglycemic Steady State 
Once the initial plasma glucose measurement < 54.0 mg/dL (<  3 mmol/ L) is achieved, the IV 
insulin infusion will be returned to the rate established at the end of the baseline euglycemia 
steady state period. After 5 minutes, the IV insulin infusion will be stopped, and up to 3 confirmatory plasma glucose readings will be taken at subsequent 5- minute intervals to 
determine whether a hypoglycemic steady state has been reached.  
A hypoglycemic steady state is defined as a confirmatory plasma glucose value ≥ 42 mg/dL (≥ 2.33 mmol/L) and < 54 mg/dL (< 3 mmol/L), and an 8- minute linearly extrapolated future 
plasma glucose value ≥ 42 mg/dL (≥  2.33 mmol/L).  
To determine whether a hypoglycemic  steady state has been achieved, confirmatory plasma 
glucose measurement s will be taken as necessary at 5, 10 and 15 minutes after an initial plasma 
glucose < 54 mg/dL (<3 mmol/L) . Depending on the outcome, the following procedures will be 
followed. 
1. If any of the confirmatory measurements meets the criteria for hypoglycemic steady state, 
the subject wi ll be eligible to receive study glucagon, and further confirmatory plasma 
glucose measurement are not required.  
XSGP -304 Clinical Protocol    
G-Pen (glucagon injection)   
 44 
Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 2. If the final confirmatory plasma glucose value is < 42 mg/dL (<  2.33 mmol/L), the 
procedure will be terminated, study glucagon will NOT be admin istered, and the visit 
will be rescheduled after a minimum 3 -day wait.  At the Investigator’s discretion, the 
subject should be treated with IV glucose or oral carbohydrates, it should be verified that 
the subject achieved a euglycemic state and is mediall y stable prior to discharge. 
3. If any of the confirmatory plasma glucose measurements are > 54 mg/dL (> 3 mmol/L), 
then the IV insulin infusion will be re-started, and insulin adjustments will be made as per 
the induction procedure described above (see Table 4). Once another initial plasma < 54 
mg/dL (< 3 mmol/L) is obtained, the sequence of up to 3 confirmatory plasma glucose readings will repeated . 
Note : If a subject fails to achieve a hypoglycemic steady state within 60 minutes of the first 
plasma glucose measurement < 54 mg/dL (<  3 mmol/L) , the procedure will be terminated , and 
the visit re -scheduled after a minimum 3 -day wait . 
Decision to Dose   
If the subject is deemed to be within a hypoglycemic  steady state, then the subject is ready to be 
dosed with study drug (decision to dose).  At this time, the subject will be eligible to receive the randomized study drug. 
Preparation an d Administration of Study Drug  
1. Once the induction procedure has begun and glucose < 5 4 mg/dL (< 3 mmol/L) is 
predicted to occur within approximately 1 hour, t he study staff member who will be 
performing the study drug injection should be notified that the  induction procedure is 
reaching conclusion .  At this time the  study staff member will bring the appropriate 
unopened test article (pouched G- Pen or Novo GlucaGen Hypokit kit) to the bedside, as 
assigned by the EDC system.   
2. Once the hypoglycemic steady state is confirmed, the Investigator will confirm that it is 
appropriate to administer study drug to the subject.  T he clock time of this “ Decision to 
Dose” will be captured in the source documents. 
3. At this point, the subject will receive the blindfold and headphones with music playing to 
maintain the blind.  
4. The treatment administrator will then open the study drug container (kit or pouch) and begin preparation of the glucagon for administration following the applicable IFU.  An 
Investigator should verify that the contents of the vial of lyophilized GlucaGen  Hypokit 
have been fully reconstituted prior to administration. 
5. Subcutaneous administration of the study drug will be made to the abdomen around the 
umbilicus  as per Section 9.3.3.  Clock time of study drug  administration  will be recorded 
in the source documents.  After study drug injection , the study product will be disposed 
in a location away from the subject  in a ma nner that maintains the blind.  After disposal, 
the blindfold and headphones will be  removed from the subj ect.  
6. Following study drug administration , plasma glucose will be measured every 
5±2 minutes through 90 minutes, and every 30±2 minutes  thereafter through 180 minutes 
post-dosing.

 45 
Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 7. At 180 minutes post-dosing, the subject will resume insulin therapy and be given a meal  
as per the standard practice at each site.  The subject can be discharged from  the clinic if 
their plasma glucose is  >100 mg/dL (> 5.55 mmol/L) and the subject is deemed 
medically stable.  
8. After study drug administration  and before 180 minutes post-dosing, if rising glucose 
levels  are observed and  if deemed medically necessary , insulin  therapy or other medical  
intervention may be initiated by the Investigator.  
a. Such intervention is not recommended to occur before 90 minutes post-dosing of 
study drug.  
b. Plasma glucose data and assessments of neuroglycopenic symptoms will be censored after the time of intervention, per the statistical analysis plan.   
c. These interventions ( such as  insulin, carbohydrates, or a meal) prior to 180 minutes 
post study drug administration  should be captured  in the source documents, and 
further glucose measurements may be performed  at the discretion of the Investigator . 
Hypoglycemia Symptom Assessments 
Subjects will complete a questionnaire regarding severity of hypoglycemia sympto ms 
(Appendix 1) at the following time points : 
1. Just before the IV bolus push dose of insulin is given a t the start of the hypoglycemia 
induction procedure (baseline) , 
2. Every time blood is drawn for evaluation of plasma glucose concentration during the 
induction procedure, 
3. Just before study drug is administered ,  
4. Every 5 ±2 minutes after glucagon  is administered until 90 minutes post-dosing, and 
every 30 minutes (coinciding with plasma glucose measurements) between 90 and 180 minutes post study drug administration .  
Local Tolerability  and Adverse Events  
Local tolerability and AEs  will be assessed as follows:  
1. Subjects will complete a Visual Analog  scale (VAS) questionnaire regarding injection 
site discomfort ( Appendix 2) at 30 ±5, 90±5, and 180±5 minutes after injection of study 
drug. 
2. Subjects will complete an Injection Site Discomfort Description and Duration Questionnaire at 30±5 minutes post-dosing.  If discomfort is ongoing at 30 minutes post-
dosing, the questionnaire will be updated before the subject leaves the clinic to document the final duration.  
3. The I nvestigator will use the modified Draize scales ( Appendix 3) to assess erythema and 
edema formation at the injection site at 30±5, 90±5, and 180±5 minutes after injection of study drug.  If any scores remain > 1 at the 180-minute evaluation, the subject may leave 
the clinic but will be instructed to contact a study  staff member  if the condition fails to 
resolve.   The CRC will make every attempt to ensure that  the same investigator will 
assess the in jection sites on the subject, during both treatment visits.

4. AEs reported by the subject or observed by an Investigator  during the visit will be 
recorded in the e CRF.  
10.2.2. Visit 3 – Treatment 2 (Day 7-28) 
The subject will return to the CRC 7 to 28 days after the first Treatment  Visit.  The procedures 
that will be repeated at Visit 3 are described  in Section  10.2.1.  Note that  venous blood will be 
collected for a repeat of baseline hematology and serum chemistry assessments  at Visit 3 .  At 
Visit 3, the subject will cross over to receive the other study drug , which will be administered at 
the time of Decision to Dose , so that ea ch subject will have received one dose of G- Pen and one 
dose of GlucaGen Hypokit during the study.  At the end of Visit 3, the subject will be asked to 
guess what their first treatment was, and what their second treatment was from the choices of 
“Xeris Glu cagon, G- Pen, administered by auto -injector” or “Comparator Glucagon, GlucaGen 
Hypokit, administered by needle and syringe”.  The subject’s responses will be recorded in the eCRF  for the Subject Study Drug Assignment Questionnaire  (see Appendix 5). 
10.2.3. Visit 4 – Follow- Up (Day 9-35) 
The subject will attend a Follow- Up Visit within 2 to 7 days after completing the final dosing 
visit or premature discontinuation.  This visit will include the following assessments: 
1. Review of changes in concomitant medications . 
2. Physical examination, excluding breast , pelvic and genitourinary exams .  To include 
review of injection sites to document any residual inflammation, pain or induration. 
3. Body weight (no shoes, lightly clothed). 
4. 12-lead ECG after 5-minute supine rest. 
5. Vital signs after 5 -minute seated rest . 
6. Urine pregnancy test (females of child -bearing potential only). 
7. Blood draws for complete metabolic count and complete blood count.  
8. Solicitation of AE s by asking the subjects to respond to a non-leading question such as 
“how do you feel?” 
In case of any premature discontinuation from the study, the subject will, if possible, be scheduled for a final follow-up visit. 
10.3. Subject Withdrawal  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, or they may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor for safety, behavioral, or 
administrative reasons.   
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact the 
subject to determine the reason(s) why the subject failed to return for the scheduled visit, and to reschedule the missed visit.   This includes contacting subjects, family members, or emergency

for a Final Visit, and f urther follow-up with the subject regarding any unresolved AE s.  It will be 
documented whether or not each subject completed the study.  Any subject who receives at least 
one treatment dose of study drug  will be included in the safety analysis.  
If a decision by the Investigator or Sponsor is made to withdraw a subject, a Final Visit should be scheduled soon after the decision to withdraw is made.  The subject will be asked to return to site for the assessments described  in Section  10.2.3.  
If the subject withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected.  The Sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent.

Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 11. ASSESSMENTS 
Every effort should be made to ensure that the required tests and procedures are completed as 
described.  However, it is anticipated that there may be circumstances outside the control of the 
Investigator, who will take all steps necessary to ensure the sa fety and well -being of the subject.  
When a protocol-required test cannot be performed, the Investigator will document the reason(s) 
and any corrective and preventive actions taken to ensure that study processes are adhered to as 
soon as possible.  The study team and the Sponsor will be informed of these incidents in a timely 
manner . 
For all blood and urine collections , an effort should be made to obtain these samples at roughly 
the same time of day (i.e., morning or afternoon) across all visits  as well  as at the  time periods 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5 ).  In addition, visits to the site must occur 
within the pre-defined windows outlined in this protocol; otherwise, they will be considered protocol deviations.  
11.1. Blood Volume  
There will be approximately 50 PD blood samples of approximately 2 mL  drawn at each 
Treatment Visit for a total of about 100 mL  of blood per visit.  The two treatment visits will be 
7 to 28 days apart.  There will be 10.5 mL blood sample s drawn at Screening , Visit 3  and at the 
Follow-up Visit for analysis of a clinical chemistry panel and hematology, with an additional 10.5 mL blood sample  drawn  at Scr eening for eligibility determination  (HbA1c, C -peptide, and 
Serology).  A total of approximately  250 mL  of blood will be drawn over the duration of the 
study ( Table 6 ).

1 Female participants of childbearing potential require a negative pregnancy test at Screening and prior to dosing 
for each of the 2 Treatment Visits. Pregnancy testing will be repeated as the Follow -up visit for safety reasons.  
2 Drug screening performed at Screening will include: cocaine, THC, opiates, amphetamines, methamphetamine, 
and phencyclidine. Analytes other than those listed above m ay be included in the test kits provided to the sites. 
Investigator will exercise discretion in allowing or excluding a subject from study participation based on a 
positive test for one of these analytes  if the subject reports use of a concomitant medicati on that explains the 
result (e.g., positive urine test for opiates in a subject reporting use of cough syrup containing 
Dextromethorphan). . Except as noted below, continuation in the study requires all tests to be negative.  
A central laboratory will be utilized for analysis of all blood analyses  except for  rapid plasma 
glucose measurements made during treatment visits.  A procedures manual will be provided to 
each site by the central laboratory.  This manual will cover procedures for the collection, 
proces sing and shipping of blood samples, and normal ranges for the central laboratory.  
The central laboratory will provide sites with all supplies needed for collection, processing and 
shipping of all blood samples, as well as point-of- care urine pregnancy tes ts and rapid urine drug 
screen kits . 
If a subject tests positive for a drug of abuse, the subject will normally be excluded from further study participation.  However, if a subject reports use of a concomitant medication (prescription 
or over the counter [ OTC ]) that provides a reasonable explanation for a positive result (other 
than THC) , the subject may be allowed to participate in the study at the Investigator ’s discretion.  
If the subject is not able to provide a reasonable explanation but still refutes a positive finding, a 
urine sample will be sent to the central laboratory for confirmation.  The result of this confirmatory test will be considered definitive.   The remaind er of the S creening visit should still 
be completed in this case.  
During treatment visits, plasma glucose concentrations  will be measured using a bedside YSI 
rapid glucose analyzer  model 2300 or 2900.  At each time point specified in Section 10, the 
result s of both the black and white leads to one decimal place will be record ed in the source

 Calculation: 74.4+74.5=148.9/2=74.45=74.5 mg/dL recorded result  
The glucose analyzer will be set to auto -calibrate following the standard practice at each site .  
Before each subject visit, performance checks will be made as per the standard practice at each 
site, and sites will maintain a log of these results.  
The EDC system  implemented for this study will allow entry of plasma glucose values in either 
mg/dL or mmol/L.  For reference, both units are provided in the written description and summary ( Table 4) of the insulin dose adjustment algorithm.  For reference, Table 8  provides a 
conversi on chart  for key values of plasma glucose referenced throughout the protocol.

Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 • 12-lead ECGs should be obtained before assessment of BP and heart rate, and prior to 
blood collections.  
11.4. Blood Pressure and Heart Rate  
The BP and heart rate will be measured at the times specified in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 5 ).  Additional or changes to collection times, or collection of BP and heart rate using 
automated devices is permitted, as necessary, to ensure appropriate subject safety.  
BP and heart rate will be measured in the seated  position with the subject’s arm supported at the 
level of the heart and recorded to the nearest mm Hg. The subject should be rested for at least 
5 min utes before the BP is obtained.  Measurements of both the BP and heart rate must be taken 
at least 2 min utes apart an d recorded in the e CRF.

Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 12. SAFETY AND ADVERSE E VENT (AE) REPORTING  
12.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which is not necessarily required to have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  Examples of AEs include: 
• Abnormal test findings. 
• Clinically significant symptoms and signs . 
• Changes in physical examination findings which are untoward and deemed clinically significant by the Investigator. 
• Allergy/hypersensitivity . 
The criteria for determining wheth er an abnormal objective test finding may be reported as an 
AE are as follows:  
• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms . 
• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention . 
• Test result leads to a change in study  dosing or discontinuation from the study. 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other treatment. 
• Test result is considered to be an AE by the Investigator or Sponsor. 
Repeat of a test based on an abnormal result in the absence of the above conditions does not constitute an AE.  Any abnormal test result determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE.  
A TEAE is an AE that either commenced following initiation of study treatment or was present prior to study treatment but increased in frequency or severity following initiation of study treatment.  
Standard medical terminology should be used in describing AEs.  Informal descriptions should be avoided. 
12.2. Reporting Adverse Events  
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treat ment sequence or suspected causal 
relationship to the study treatment will be reported with two exceptions.  Since it is being experimentally induced in this study, hypoglycemia will not be considered an AE in this study unless the event meets one of the d efinitions of a SAE (see Section  12.4).  Injection site reactions 
will not be considered an AE unless a skin reaction or pain requires medical intervention.   
For all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and attempt to obtain information adequate to 
determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the FDA criteria for classification as an SAE, requiring immediate notification to Xeris.   
XSGP -304 Clinical Protocol    
G-Pen (glucagon injection)   
 55 
Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 For all AEs, follow-up by the Investigator is required until the event resolves or stabilizes at a 
level acceptable to the Investigator  to consider it resolved . For  unresolved AEs to be considered 
stable , the Xeris Medical Monitor must concur with that assess ment.  
As part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non- SAE  that is determined to 
be serious (according to the FDA definitions of an SAE) will be reported by the Sponsor as an 
SAE.  To assist in the determination of case seriousness, furt her information may be requested 
from the Investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the 
clinical study.  
12.3. Reporting Period  
For all AEs, the reporting period to Xeris begins from the subject providing informed consent, through the Follow-up Visit.  All adverse events will be followed until resolution or the subject is medically stable.  
12.4. Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that  at any dose:  
• Results in death , 
• Is life -threatening , 
• Requires in -patient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization , 
• Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity, or  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in d etermining whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  These should 
also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm or blood dyscrasias or convulsions which do not result in hospitalization. 
12.5. Severity Assessment  
On the AE eCRF, the Investigator  will use the adjectives “mild,” “moderate,” or “severe” to 
describe the maximum intensity of the AE.  These intensity grades are defined as follows in 
Table 9 . 
Table 9 AE Severity Assessment  
Mild  Does not interfere with subject’s usual function . 
Moderate  Interferes to some extent (<50%) with subject’s usual function . 
Severe  Interferes significantly (≥50%) with subject’s usual function . 
The terms “serious” and “severe” are not synonymous.  The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event.  The event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance.  This is not the same as “serious,”  which is based on 
XSGP -304 Clinical Protocol    
G-Pen (glucagon injection)   
 56 
Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 subject/event outcome or action criteria.  Accordingly, a severe event is not necessarily a serious 
event.  
12.6. Causality Assessment  
The Investigator will answer “yes” or “no” to the following question when assessing causality 
between an adve rse event to the study drug, where an answer of “yes” designates the event as 
related to study drug and a “no” designates the event as not related to study drug : “Is there a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event?” A ‘‘reasonable possibility ’’ means that 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  The 
Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs.  The Investigator must 
record the causal relationship in the eCRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse event reporting requirements, if applicable ( Section  12.9).   
12.7. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events  
Withdrawal due to AE should be distinguished from withdrawal due to insufficient response and 
recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  When a subject withdraws due to an SAE, the SAE must be 
reported in accordance with the report ing requirements (see Section  12.9).  
12.8. Eliciting Adverse Event Information and Reporting  
The Investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by the 
study subject.  Each study subject will be questioned about AEs.  Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs.  If an SAE occurs, expedited reporting will follow the provisions of Section 12.9. 
12.9. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
If an SAE occurs, Xeris is to be notified within 24 hours of awareness of the event by the 
Investig ator.  In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, notification to Xeris must be 
made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AE information.  This time frame also 
applies to follow-up on previously forwarded SAE reports. 
In the ra re event that the Investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately (e.g., a study subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the Investigator is to 
report the event within 24 hours after learning of the event and document the t ime of first 
awareness of the AE.   
A death occurring during the study, during the per-protocol follow-up period, or within 30 days 
after stopping treatment with test drug must be reported to Xeris or its designee(s) immediately, 
whether or not it is consi dered treatment -related.  Initial SAE reports must be followed by 
detailed descriptions.  These should include copies of hospital case records and other documents 
when requested.  Telephone and e- mail reports must be confirmed promptly either by facsimile 
or by overnight courier or mail. 
Under 21 Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) 312.32(c), Xeris or its designee(s) is required to 
notify the FDA and all participating Investigators in an Investigational New Drug Application  
(IND) safety report (i.e., 7- or 15-day expedited report) of potentially serious risks from clinical 
XSGP -304 Clinical Protocol    
G-Pen (glucagon injection)   
 57 
Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 trials or any other source as soon as possible, but no later than 15 calendar days after the safety 
information is received and a determination is made that the  information qualifies for reporting.  
12.10.  Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
All AEs will be reported on the AE page(s) of the eCRF.  AEs should be reported using concise medical terminology on the eCRFs as well as on the form for collection of the SAE information. 
12.11.  AE Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities  
AE reporting  by the Sponsor, including suspected serious unexpected adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable regulations. 
The Investigator must notify the Institutional Review Board  (IRB)/Independent Ethics 
Committee  (IEC) of the occurrence of any  SAE, in writing, as soon as is practicable and in 
accordance with local regulations.  A copy of this notification must be provided to Xeris or its 
designee.  
In the event of an SAE that meets the criteria for expedited reporting, an SAE report will be prepared for submission to the FDA and any other applicable authorities by Xeris or its designee. 
12.12.  Pregnancy  
The active pharmaceutical product in Xeris G- Pen is glucagon, which is in Pregnancy 
Category  B.  Female subjects of child bearing potential will be tested (rapid, urine) for 
pregnancy at the S creening V isit.  Any subject found to be pregnant at the S creening V isit 
(Visit 1) will not be enrolled in the treatment phase.  At both Treatment Visits and at the Follow-Up Visit (i.e., Visits 2, 3 and 4), pregnancy test ing will be repeated .  Any subject who is found to 
be pregnant at one of the Treatment Vi sits will be withdrawn from the study immediately  and no 
further study treatments will be given .  Pregnancy at the follow-up visit will be noted, but the 
visit will be completed.  Any pregnancy in a subject who received at least one dose of study drug 
will be followed until resolution (i.e., birth or voluntary or spontaneous termination of the 
pregnancy).  Any pregnancy outcome that meets the criteria for an SAE will be reported as an SAE.  
12.13.  Subject Monitoring  
Subjects will be monitored for AEs throughout the study by the study unit staff.  The pri ncipal 
Investigator or designated sub-Investigator will be on site for drug administration and until 3 hours after administration of study drug to the last subject.  The principal Investigator or designated sub- Investigator  will also be on call for the remainder of the treatment visit.  If 
necessary, a physician, either at the study site or in a nearby hospital, will administer treatment for any AEs.  
Safety parameters, including laboratory results and ECGs, will be assessed by the principal 
Investigator or his delegate using the site’s criteria for clinical laboratory and ECG acceptance 
ranges as suggested guidelines in making the medical assessment.  
XSGP -304 Clinical Protocol

 58 
Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 Scheduled safety measurements will be repeated according to appropriate SOPs or upon request 
from a physician.  Any abnormal repeated measurement will be evaluated by a physician and 
repeated if judged necessary.  Further action may be taken on the physician’s request.  
Subjects will be advised to notify their health care professionals (e.g., physician, dentist, and/or 
pharmacist) that they are participating in a clinical research study of a drug called synthetic 
Glucagon Injection before taking any medicines or undergoing any medical procedure.

13.1. General Approach  
Detailed method ology for descriptive and inferential statistical analyses of the data collected in 
the XSGP -304 study will be documented in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  The SAP will be 
prepared by the Sponsor’s contract research organization (CRO) and agreed upon by the 
Sponsor.  The SAP will be finalized and approved by signature and dates prior to locking the database.  Additional graphical representations of the results may be produced after review of the 
data (post hoc).  The SAP will take precedence over the protocol.  The primary objective of the 
study is to test whether G -Pen is no worse than the GlucaGen Hypokit for injection in terms of 
hypoglycemia relief.  Any major modifications of the definition of the Primary Endpoint or analysis will be reflected in a protocol amendment. 
13.2. Sample Size Calculation  
For the primary endpoint analysis, a failure is recorded if the subject’s plasma glucose fails to reach a concentration >70 mg/dL (>3.88 mmol/L) and fails to increase by at least 20.0 mg/dL 
(1.11 mmol/L) within 30 minutes of the decision to administer the dose of glucagon.  The 
determination of a constant clinically non- inferior margin for the cure rate difference is generally 
difficult in practice for a number of reasons.  To alleviate this concern, it has been recommended 
to use an Odds Ratio of cure rates because the corresponding clinically non-inferior margin on 
the difference scale is getting small when the underlying cure rate becomes large and close to 1 [Lui and Chang(a) ]. In this study, it is expected that the recovery (cure rate) will be high and 
approaching 100%. Since this is a cross-over design and each subject will serve as his/her control, power is improved.  
The sample size was derived for 80% power of detecting non-inferiority with respect to the Odds 
Ratio of subject recovery rates at an alpha of 0.025 under a cross-over design [ Lui and Chang(b) ] 
Based on an underlying Odds Ratio of 1.0, and rates of 0.20 versus 0.25, 111 subjects are 
required for the study. With an anticipated 10% drop- out rate, the total sample size for the study 
is 122 randomized subjects. 
13.3. Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint comparison will be performed using both the Intention to Treat (ITT) and the per -protocol (PP) populations.  The evaluable set for the PP population will be defined as all 
randomized subjects who, during both study periods, successfully complete the insulin induction 
procedure, fulfill the criteria for having achieved a hypoglycemic steady state, and successfully 
receive a dose of both study drugs (G-Pen followed by GlucaGen Hypokit, or GlucaGen Hypokit followed by G-Pen).  For analysis of the primary endpoint, a failure for the study treatment 
(G Pen or GlucaGen Hypokit ) will be recorded if  the increase in plasma glucose remains 
< 20 mg/d L (< 1.11 mmol/L) throughout the 0- to 30- minute  period from injection of study drug, 
while a  success is defined as a n increase in plasma glucose ≥  20 mg/dL (≥ 1.11 mmol/L) in 
subjects from a state of insulin -induced hypoglycemia within the 0 - to 30-minute period from 
injection of study drug.

G-Pen (glucagon injection)   
 60 
Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 Non-inferiority will be established based on the calculated 95% confidence interval for the 
difference in failure rates between G -Pen and GlucaGen Hypokit.  Non-i nferiority will be 
declared if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in failure rates is 
≤ 5%; where the absolute failure rate of G -Pen treatment is ≤  5%.  
13.4. Secondary Endpoints  
The following secondary endpoints will be assessed:  
1. Rate of achieving a positive plasma glucose response, defined as either a plasma glucose concentration > 70 mg/dL (>  3.88 mmol/L) or an increase in plasma glucose 
concentration > 20 mg/dL (>1.11 mmol/L) within 30 minutes from injection of study drug.  
2. Rates of positive symptomatic response, defined as relief of neuroglycopenic symptoms 30 minutes from a decision to dose. 
3. Rates of positive treatment response, defined as exhibiting either a positive plasma glucose response or a positive symptomatic response.  
4. Time to a positive plasma glucose response from injection of study drug. 
5. Time to administer study drug from time to a decision to dose. 
6. PD characteristics of mean plasma glucose concentration (0 to 90 minutes post-dose), 
Cmax, tmax, AUC (0-90), and area under the concentration versus time curve from time 0 to 
180 minutes (AUC (0-180)). 
7. Time to (a) initial relief and (b) complete resolution of autonomic and neuroglycopenic 
symptoms of hypoglycemia from a decision to dose.  
8. Time to resolution of the overall feeling of hypoglycemia from a decision to dose. 
9. Safety endpoints, including: AE/ SAE rates, and changes in vital signs, laboratory variables, and physical exam/ECG findings. 
10. Tolerability endpoints measured at 30, 90, and 180 minutes post-dosing, including: Draize scale scores for injection site erythema and edema as assessed by the investigator, and injection site discomfort and duration as assessed by subject questionnaire responses. 
13.4.1. Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
The PD endpoints will be derived from the individual glucose profiles. 
Pharmacodynamic characteristics, including: plasma glucose area under the concentration versus 
time curve ( AUC ), C
max, and t max, time to achieve a ≥  20.0 mg/dL (≥  1.11 mmol/L) increase from 
glucose nadir, and time to reach ≥  70.0 mg/dL  (≥ 3.89mmol/L) , will be compared between the 
treatment groups from time of glucagon administration.   Comparison between the treatment 
groups will be performed using a mixed model with treatment, period and sequence as terms.

G-Pen (glucagon injection)   
 61 
Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 13.4.2. Hypoglycemia Symptoms 
Symptom relief will be analyzed as aggregate scores for the four autonomic symptoms , four 
neuroglycopenic sym ptoms , and 8 total (autonomic and neuroglycopenic) symptoms  (see 
Appendix 1).  
For analysis , “relief” will be defined as a return to a score no more than one unit above baseline 
symptoms during the euglycemic baseline period. 
The time to the minimal score post baseline will be described and compared between the 
treatment groups using a mixed model with  treatment, period and sequence as terms.  Similarly, 
the time to first reporting of “no” for the overall hypoglycemia question  (“Do you currently feel 
hypoglycemic?”)  will be described and compared between the groups. 
13.4.3. Glucagon Preparation Time 
The time between “decision to dose” and time of study drug administration to the abdomen 
around the umbilicus will be measured and called the glucagon preparation time.  This time 
measurement will be used for analysis of study end points.  The total preparation time required to inject to the abdomen around the umbilicus  from a decision to treat will be compared between 
the treatment groups, as measured between the “time of decision to dose” and “ time of study 
drug administration.”  
13.5. Safety Analysis 
All safety analyses will be performed using the safety population, namely those subjects receiving at least one dose of the study drug . 
The following variables will be compared between the treatment  groups for safety purposes:  
• AEs and SAE s 
• Laboratory safety variables (Screening to Final Visit)  
• Physical examination (Screening to Final Visit)  
• Vital signs  
• Body weight (Screening to Final Visit)  
• ECG (Screening to Final Visit)  
• Local tolerability, including:  
o Subjective injection site discomfort as reported by subjects using a 100- mm visual 
analog scale ( VAS ) and ordinal pain scales ( Appendix 2).  
o Erythema and or edema formation at site of injection assessed using the Draize scale ( Appendix 3).  
13.5.1. Adverse E vents  
All verbatim AE  terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) and summarized by system organ class  (SOC), preferred term  (PT) , and study drug.   
AE collection will begin from the time of  informed  consent.  Listings of all AEs (including non-

Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 TEAEs), SAEs, and TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation will be provided by treatment 
group, site, subject, verbatim term, MedDRA SOC and PT , star t and end dates, seriousness flag, 
severity, relationship to study drug, action taken with study treatment, frequency, and outcome. 
AEs will be summarized overall by the number and percentage of subjects who experienced at 
least 1 AE of the following categories in each treatment group: any AE, any TEAE, any drug 
related TEAE (defined as possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug), any severe or life-threatening TEAE, any serious TEAEs, any drug- related SAE, any SAE leading to death, 
any TEAE le ading to premature discontinuation of study drug, and any SAE leading to 
premature study drug discontinuation.  
The number and percentage of subjects reporting a TEAE in each treatment group will be 
tabulated by SOC and PT ; by SOC, PT , and severity (mild, moderate, and severe/life-
threatening/death); and by SOC, PT, and relationship (unrelated [defined as unrelated or unlikely 
related to study drug] or related [defined as possibly, probably, or definitely related] to study 
drug).  
For all analyses of TEAEs,  if the same AE (based on PT ) was reported for the same subject more 
than once, then the AE will be  counted only once for that PT  and at the highest severity and 
strongest relationship to study drug.  The numbers and percentages of subjects reporting an SA E or reporting a TEAE leading to 
premature discontinuation of study drug in each treatment group will be summarized by SOC 
and PT . 
Subjects will be analyzed for safety according to the study treatment received.  
13.5.2. Laboratory Safety A ssessments 
Laboratory values (biochemistry and hematology) will be flagged if outside the normal range  
and a listing of clinically significant abnormal values will be presented.  Laboratory assessments 
will be summarized at S creening and at the Follow-up Visit.  Sign ificant deviations/changes 
from the Screening Visit to the Final Visit will be documented as AEs if the Investigator judges them to  be clinically significant.  
13.5.3. Physical examination 
Subjects with any findings in the physical examination evaluation at S creeni ng will be listed.  
Changes to physical examination from Screening to end of study will be recorded as AEs if the Investigator judges them to be clinically significant.  
13.5.4. Vital signs and body weight  
Vital signs and body weight will be summarized by descriptive statistics.   Significant changes 
from pre - to post- dosing at treatment visits or from the Screening Visit to the Final Visit will be 
documented as AEs if the Investigator judges the m to be clinically significant.
  
13.5.5. ECG  
Any clinically significant ECG chan ges will be recorded and  followed as appropriate.  The 
Investigator’s evaluations will be summarized in a  data listing.

13.5.6. Local Tolerability  
The incidence of any injection site discomfort (score > 0 on the ordinal rating scale) will be 
analyzed descriptively.  The incidences of erythema and edema will be analyzed in a similar 
manner.  Descriptive st atistics (only) will be provided for time of onset and duration (of 
discomfort) and discomfort description (i.e., pain, irritation, itching, etc.).  Mean VAS scores 
will be compared between the treatments . 
13.6. Subgroup Analysis  
Analysis of subgroups is not planned or powered for this  study.  Any subpopulations analyzed 
will be described in the SAP. 
13.7. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized for all subjects overall and by 
treatment.  Summary statistics (e .g., number of subjects, mean and  standard  deviation, median 
and range) will be generated for all continuous variables ( i.e., age and weight,) and the number 
and percentage of subjects within each category will be presented for all categorical variables (i.e., gender, race, ethnicit y,).

AUDITS  
15.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical study staff under the supervision of the 
Investigator.  During the study, the Investigator will maintain complete and accurate documentation for the study. 
As defined  in the ICH Guidelines for GCP  (E6(R2)), Section 1.52, source documents may 
include:  original documents, data, and records ( e.g., hospital records, clinical and office charts, 
laboratory notes, memoranda, participant’s diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing 
records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as bein g accurate and complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or 
magnetic media, x -rays, participant files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, 
and at medico -technical departments involved in the clinical study).  
As used in this protocol, the term e CRF is  understood to refer to an electronic data record.  An 
eCRF is required and should be completed for each individual subject.  The completed original eCRFs are the property of Xeris and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Xeris or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from Xeris.   
Completion of eCRFs will be accomplished using a 21 CFR Part 11 compliant web -based EDC 
system. Sites will use exi sting computers to enter all other study- related data into the EDC 
system.  
The Investigator has the responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safety and 
laboratory data entered on the eCRFs and any other data collection forms (source documents) 
and ensuring that these are accurate, authentic, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, 
contemporaneous, enduring and available when required.  The eCRFs must be signed by the Investigator or by an authorized study staff member to attest that the data contained in the e CRFs 
is true.  Any corrections to entries made in the e CRFs  or source documents must be dated, 
initialed and explained (if necessary) , and should not obscure the original entry. 
In most cases, the source documents are the h ospital’s or physician’s subject chart.  In these 
cases, data collected on the e CRFs must match the data in those charts.  In some cases, the eCRF, 
or part of the eCRF, may also serve as source documents.  In these cases, a document should be available at the Investigator ’s site as well as at Xeris and clearly identify those data that will be 
recorded in the eCRF, and for which the eCRF will stand as the source document . Queries 
generated by Data Management will be sent to the study site for resolution.  Th e Investigator is 
responsible for the review and approval of all responses to eCRF queries. 
15.2. Record Retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Xeris, the Investigator agrees 
to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link 
records, e.g., eCRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent documents, 
copies of all eCRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment 
XSGP -304 Clinical Protocol    
G-Pen (glucagon injection)   
 66 
Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (e.g., letters, meeting 
minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be retained by the Investigator  according 
to the ICH, local regulat ions, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement, whichever is 
longer.  The Investigator must obtain written permission from Xeris before disposing of any 
records, even if retention requirements have been met.  
15.3. Monitoring  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed by Xeris and/or its designee will be implemented 
to ensure compliance with FDA and ICH GCP guidelines. 
The Xeris designated representative (the monitor or auditor) will contact the Investigator and 
conduct regular visits to the clinical site .  The monitor will be expected and allowed to verify the 
Investigator ’s qualifications, to inspect clinical site facilities, and to inspect study records, 
including proof of IRB/ IEC review, with the stipulation that subject confidentiality will be 
maintained in accordance with regional, local , and federal regulations (including Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 [ HIPAA ] requirements ).  The monitor will 
also be responsible for confirming adherence to the study protocol, inspecting eCRFs and source 
documents, and ensuring the integrity of the data.  Electronic  CRFs will be checked for accuracy, 
completeness, and clarity and will be cross -checked for consistency with source documents, 
including laboratory test reports and other subject records.  Instances of missing or uninterpretable data will be resolved in coordination with the Investigator.  
The monitor/auditor will also investigate any questions concerning adherence to regulatory 
requirements.  Any administrative concerns will be c larified and followed.  The monitor will 
maintain contact with the site through frequent direct communications with the study site by 
e-mail, telephone, facsimile, and postal mail.  The Investigator and all other site personnel agree 
to cooperate fully wit h the monitor and will work in good faith with the monitor to resolve all 
questions raised,  and difficulties detected by the monitor. 
15.4. Audits and Inspections  
The Investigator understands that regulatory authorities, the IRB/ IEC, and/or Xeris or their 
design ees have the right to access all eCRFs, source documents, and other study documentation 
for on -site audit or inspection and will retain this right from the start of the study to at least 
2 years after the last approval of a marketing application or for at least 2 years after clinical 
development of the study drug for the indication being studied has been discontinued.  The Investigator is required to guarantee access to these documents and to cooperate with and support 
such audits and inspections.

ICH E6, local and regional ethical and regulatory requirements, including the Federal Food, 
Drug and Cosmetic Act, U.S. applicable CFR  (title 21), any IRB/IEC requirements relative to 
clinical studies.   
Should a conflict arise, the Investigator will follow whichever law or guideline affords the 
greater protection to the individual subject.  The Investigator will also ensur e thorough 
familiarity with the appropriate administration and potential risks of administration of the study 
drug, as described in this protocol and the G- Pen Investigator’s Brochure, prior to the initiation 
of the study. 
16.2. Institutional Review Board  and Et hics Committee  
The IRB/IEC must be a properly constituted board or committee operating in accordance with 
21 CFR Part 56, “Institutional Review Boards.”  This protocol, any protocol amendments, the 
associated informed consent forms, and the informed consent procedures must be submitted to 
the IRB /IEC  for review and approved before the enrollment of any subject into the study.  Study 
drug may not be shipped to the Investigator until Xeris has received a copy of the letter or certificate of app roval from the IRB/ IEC for the protocol and any protocol amendments. 
All types of subject recruitment or advertising information must be submitted to Xeris or its designee and to the IRB/ IEC for review and approval prior to implementation.  IRB approval of 
any protocol amendments must be received before any of the changes outlined in the amendments are put into effect, except when the amendment has been enacted to eliminate a potential hazard to study subjects.  In such cases, the chair of the IRB/ IEC should be notified 
immediately,  and the amendment forwarded to the IRB/ IEC for review and approval. 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, e.g., 
recruitment advertisements from the IRB /IEC.  All correspondence with the IRB/ IEC should be 
retained in the Investigator File.  Copies of IRB/ IEC approvals should be forwarded to Xeris. 
16.3. Subject Information and Consent  
All parties will ensure protection of subject personal data and will not include subject names on 
any Sponsor forms, reports, publications, or in any other disclosures.  Subject names, address, 
date of birth and other identifiable data will be replaced by a numerical code consisting of a 
numbering system provided by Xeris to de- identify the study subject.  In the case of data 
transfer, Xeris will maintain confidentiality and protection of subject personal data.  
The informed consent document used in this study, and any changes made during the course of the study, must be prospectively approved by both the IRB/ IEC and Xeris before use.  The 
Investigator must ensure that each study subject is fully informed about the nature and objectives 
of the study and possible risks associated with participation.  The Investigator , or a study staff 
member designated by the Investigator, will obtain written informed consent from each subject 
before any study -specific activity is performed.  The Investigator will retain the original of each

or potential subject’s eCRF.  The signed informed consent document must remain on file at the 
study site and be available for verification by the study monitors a t all times.  
16.4. Subject Recruitment  
All types of subject recruitment or advertising information must be submitted to Xeris or its 
designee and to the IRB/ IEC for review and approval prior to implementation.  Advertisements 
approved by the IRB/ IEC may be used as recruitment procedures.  
16.5. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol  
In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (i.e., clinical hold), or if the Investigator is 
aware of any new information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of 
the investigational product, Xeris should be notified immediately.  In addition, the Investigator 
will inform Xeris immediately of any urgent safety measures taken by the Investigator to protect 
study subjects against any immediate hazard, and of any serious breaches of this protocol.

TERMINATING THE STUD Y 
17.1. Protocol Modifications and Deviations  
The principal Investigator must sign this protocol a nd its amendments (if any) before initiating 
the study at a particular site.  The Investigator will make all reasonable efforts to comply with the 
written protocol.  Protocol modifications to ongoing studies that affect the safety of subjects or 
that alter  the scope of the investigation, the scientific quality of the study, the experimental 
design, dosing, study assessments, the number of subjects exposed to test drug, or subject 
selection criteria must be made only after consultation between Xeris and the Investigator .  All 
protocol modifications must be reviewed and approved by the IRB/ IEC before the revised 
protocol can be implemented.  Emergency revisions that eliminate an apparent hazard to subjects do not require preapproval by the IRB/ IEC.  However, t he IRB /IEC must be notified in writing 
as soon as possible after the modification has been made.  A copy of this communication must be 
forwarded to Xeris.  All departures from the protocol must be fully documented in the source 
documents and the e CRFs of t he subjects involved. Protocol deviations will be tracked in an 
electronic system implemented by the Sponsor or designated representative.  
17.2. Study Termination  
The study may be prematurely terminated at any time because of a regulatory authority decision, 
change in opinion of the IRB/ IEC, safety problems  resulting in subject  deaths, or at the 
discretion of Xeris or the principal Investigator.   
Circumstances that may warrant premature study termination include, but are not limited, to the 
following: 
• Determinat ion of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subjects, 
• Failure to enter subjects at an acceptable rate,  
• Insufficient adherence to the requirements of the protocol,  
• Insufficient provision of complete and evaluable data, or 
• Plans to modify, suspend, or discontinue development of the study drug. 
If the study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Xeris will promptly notify the Investigator s and  document the reason for study termination.  S pecific procedures for 
termination will be arranged by th e Sponsor in coordination with the Investigator s.  After 
notification, the Investigators must contact all participating subjects within 7 days.  All study materials must be collected and all e CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible, and all study 
materials must be returned to Xeris or its designee within an additional 28 days.

Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 APPENDICES  
APPENDIX 1. HYPOGLYCEMIA SYMPTOM QUESTIONNAIRE  
Investigative Site Instructions:  The subject should complete the Hypoglycemia Symptom 
Questionnaire at the following time points: 
• Just before the IV bolus push dose of insulin is given at the start of the hypoglycemia 
induction procedure. 
• Every time blood is drawn for evaluation of plasma glucose concentration during the 
induction procedure. 
•  Just before study drug is administered. 
• Every 5 ±2 minutes after glucagon is administered  until 90 minutes post- dosing.  (Data 
will be collected 18 times) . 
• Every 30±5 minutes (coinciding with plasma glucose measurements) between 90 and 
180 minutes post study drug dosing (90 minutes, 120 minutes, and 180 minutes). Note: If a subject is unable to physically complete the questionnaire, the subject will 
provide verbal responses, which will be recorded  on the questionnaire by study staff.  
Documentation will be provided on each completed questionnaire as to who 
completed the form. 
Subject Instructions:  Please rate the current intensity (severity) of each of the following 
symptoms on a scale of 1 -6, with a minimum score of “1” meaning the symptom was absent and 
a maximum score of “6” meaning the symptom was severe. For the final question, please answer “yes” or “no.”

Protocol XSGP-304 v2.1  Confidential 17 December  2018 APPENDIX 2. INJECTION SITE DISCOMFORT ASSESSMENT  
Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Injection Site Discomfort  
Investigative Site Instructions:  The subject should complete the 100- mm Visual Analog Scale 
(VAS) for Injection Site Discomfort at 30±5 and 90±5 minutes after  injection of study drug, and 
again at 180±5 minutes after injection of study drug. The 180- minute evaluation  after injection 
of study drug is still required even if glucose monitoring ends at an earlier timepoint.  The 
subject  will complete the VAS by drawing a single vertical line through the scale corresponding  
to the perceived intensity (severity) of discomfort according to the instructions below. The goal 
is for the subject to report the amount of discomfort, if any, remaining at each time point, as 
opposed to reporting the transient pain associated with needle insertion. 
Note: If a subject is unable to physically complete the questionnaire, the subject will indicate the 
point on the VAS corresponding to their level of discomfort, and study staff will enter a vertical 
line at that point. Documentation will be provided on each completed questionnaire as to who completed the form. 
Please verify the length of the VAS line to be 100 -mm before providing it to the subject.  
Subject Instructions:  Ignoring any pain from insertion of the needle, please draw a single verti cal 
line through the scale below that corresponds to the intensity (severity) of any discomfort you are 
feeling right now  at the study drug injection site.  
Discomfort could include stinging, burning, tingling, throbbing or pain. The further to the right you make your vertical mark, indicates the more intense discomfort you are feeling.  
You should normally draw a straight line across the scale to indicate your current level of discomfort. However, if you are currently feeling no discomfort, you should circle the vertical line on the left end of scale (above the word “no”). If you are currently feeling the worst discomfort possible, you should circle the vertical line on the right end of the scale.

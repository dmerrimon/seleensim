SUMMARY 
 
 
 
 
Title: Internet Surveys and their Impact on Adherence to Brimonidine topical gel  and 
QOL in Patients with Rosa cea 
 
  Source of Funding : Wake Forest University Health Sciences  
 
Objective: 
Primary  Objective: To assess adh erence to topi cal brimonidine  topical gel, 0.33%  for the 
treatment of rosacea.  
Secondary Objectives: To determine  the impact of reported adherence on rosacea 
outcom es, to identi fy factors that  affect adh erence to ros acea treatment and to assess Q OL. 
 
Study  Design: 
 
An investig ator-blind ed, prospective, 6 month  study of subjects with persistent erythema 
associated with active rosacea will be condu cted in 20 subjects aged 18 years and older. 
All subjects will receive standard-of-care brimonidin e topical gel, 0.33% with instru ctions  
to apply it once daily per package insert. Adherence will be assess ed using weekly internet 
surveys to document  how o ften the medi cation is being used,  as well as reminders about 
rosacea triggers and general use of brimonidine.  
 
Patients with persistent er ythem a associat e d with  rosacea will be recruited from the 
Wake Forest Baptist H ealth Dermatology Clinics and IRB approved advertisin g. At the 
baseline screening visit, subj ects will have the diagnosis  of rosacea confirmed  by an 
invest igator. Patients will be classifi ed as having erythem atotelangiectatic or a 
combin ation erythematotel angiectatic and papulopustul ar. We will evaluate  whether patients 
believe they have constant erythema  or more int ermitt ent flushing  and blushin g. Subje cts 
will be informed of the benefits and risks  of treatment. If they agree to particip ate, the 
subjects will give written  consent approved by the Institutional R eview  Board and will be  
seen in fol low up at 3 months and 6 months.  
 
Subje cts will be randomized 1:1 to be in the weekly internet survey group (appendix) or 
the stand ard care non-survey group. The internet survey will ask them  how often they 
have used their  medi cation that week, as well as giving them treatment tips and remind ers 
about rosacea trig gers. They will be asked a variety of questions during  the weekly internet 
survey- such as the amount  of erythema they currently have (measured by VAS scale), 
how much  burni ng and stinging they have, how often they have used the medi cation 
and where did they apply the medi cation, as well as any additional  side effects they

 may be having from the medi cation. 
 
Subje cts in the non-internet survey group will just get these  identic al surveys at the Month  3 
and Month 6 visits. We are also inte rested in learning through the adherence surveys if 
subjects begin using  the medi cation on an as needed basis, and if this affects the side 
effect profile and satisfaction with the  medication. 
 
 
 
At each visit,  review  of the internet survey use and medi cation weights will be 
done. Dise ase severity measures ((Clinici an’s Erythema Assessment (CEA ), 
Patient Severity Assessment (PSA, Lesion counts )) will be obtain ed. Investigator 
and subject Visu al Analog Scale (VAS) to measure facial erythema will be 
obtained. Adverse events will be logged at every visit.  Attention  will be paid 
to any symptoms  of r ebound  erythema  and more detailed  information 
concerning location and timing  will be  collected. QOL surve ys will be  compl eted 
at the end of  study visit.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Rosa cea is a chronic  disease with great psychosocial and emotional  impact. 
Topi cal the rapies are the mainst ay of rosacea treatment; however patients often 
continue  to suffer from rosacea after being prescribed a treatment; poor adherence 
likely plays a role in poor  treatment outcom es. Non-adherence is a patient’s 
failure to follow a medication re gimen as directed by the physician. In many 
cases, non-adherence, rather  than non- response, is the  underlying cause of 
treatment failure. 
 
 
 
 
Brimonidine  is a topical treatment for the persistent erythema  associated with 
rosacea. Some  patients have noticed some  rebound  flushing  when using the 
medication. This r aises the question  about adherence to the medication in the 
setting of adverse effects. The  general thought is that there is a relationship  
between adverse effects from medi cations  and treatment adherence- the more  often 
side effects occur the less often a medi cation may be taken. However that is not 
always the case. Many patients take medi cations  such as isotretinoin  and topical 
fluorouracil with well document ed side effects. Yet adherence to these  medi cations  
is often very good.  So do any adverse effects from b rimon idine affect patient  
adherence? 
 
 
 
 
Return office visits  are used to follow  treatment complian ce and adherence. An 
online surv ey may provide  an effective and more p ractical alternative to an extra 
office visit as a method to measure and promote  improved adherence. Internet 
surveys may improve intrinsic  motivation  to take medi cation by making the patient 
feel cared for, enhancing a trusting  patient-physician relationship. A  good deal of 
real time  information can be obt ained through an internet survey. 
 
 
 
2.0     STUDY OBJECTIVES 
Primary  Objective: To assess adh erence to topi cal brimonidine  for the 
treatment of rosacea. 
 
Secondary Objectives: To determine  the impact of reported adherence on 
rosacea outcom es, To identi fy factors that affect adherence to rosacea 
treatment and to assess Q OL. 
 
2.1       Study Design 
 
An investig ator-blind ed, prospective, 6 month  study of subjects with 
WFUHS Dept of Dermatology 
Winston-Salem, NC   
7 
 persistent erythema associated with active ros acea will be condu cted 
in 20 subjects aged 18 years and older. All subjects will  receive standard-
of-care brimonidine topical gel 0.33%  with instru ctions  to apply it once 
daily per package insert. Adheren ce will be assess ed using weekly 
internet surveys to do cument  how often the medi cation is being used, as 
well as remind ers about ros acea triggers and general use of  brimonidine . 
Before starting treatment, s ubjects will be reminded that bromonidine is 
indicated for persistent, not transient, erythema. They will be given a copy of 
the product package insert and a copy of the American Academy of 
Dermatology website ( www.aad.org ) information on rosacea that contains 
standardized information about the diagnosis and triggers.  
 
 
 
 
Patients with persistent e r yt h e m a  d u e  t o  rosacea will be recruited from 
the Wake Forest Baptist Health Dermatology Clinic  and IRB approved 
advertisin g. At the b aseline screening visit,  subjects will have the diagnosis  
of rosacea confirmed by an investig ator. Patients will be classifi ed as having 
erythem atotelangiectatic or a combin ation erythematotelangiectatic and 
papulopustul ar. We will evaluate wh ether patients believe they have 
constant erythema or more intermitt ent flushing  and blushi ng. Subje cts 
will be informed of the benefits and risks  of treatment as indicated in the 
package insert . If they agree to particip ate, the subjects will give written 
consent approved by the Institutional  Review  Board and will be seen in 
follow  up at 3 months and  6 months.  
 
 
 
 
Subje cts will be  randomi zed (according to st andard randomi zation tabl es)1:1 
to be in  the weekly internet survey group (appendix) or the standard care 
non-survey group.  The internet survey will ask them  how often they have 
used their medi cation that week, as well as giving them  treatment tips and 
remind ers about ros acea triggers. They will be asked a variety of 
questions  during the weekly internet survey- such as the amount  of erythema 
they currently have (measured by VAS scale), how much  burning  and 
stinging they have, how often they have used the  medi cation and where did 
they apply it, as well as any additional  side effects th ey may be having 
from the medi cation. Subjects in the non-internet survey group will just 
get these identic al surveys at the Month  3 and Month  6 visits. We are also 
interested in learning  through the adherence surveys if subjects begin 
using  the medi cation on an as needed basis, and if this affects the side 
effect profile and satisfaction with the m edication. 
 
At each visit,  review  of the internet survey use and medi cation weights 
will be don e. Disease severity measures (CEA, PSA,  lesion  counts)  will 
be obtain ed. Investigator and subject VAS scales to measure facial erythema 
WFUHS Dept of Dermatology 
Winston-Salem, NC

 will be obtain ed. Adv erse events will be logged at every visit.  Attention  will 
be paid to any symptoms  of rebound  erythema and more detailed  
information  concerning loc ation and timing  will be collected.  The lesion 
counts will  also measure any papules or telangiectasia that may 
become more readily visible with the improvement in background 
erythema. Telangiectasia  will be counted individually by facial 
quadrant as noted in the Lesion Count Appendix.  Measuring 
individual visible telangiectasia is important as subjects may 
confuse these with u nderlying erythema of rosacea, thus affecting 
subject assessment of their disease. QOL surve ys will be compl eted at 
the end of  study visit.  
 
 
Descriptive  statistics will be generated with mean  ± standard  deviation  
(S.D.)  or medi an (interquartile range) for continuous  measures depending on 
the distribution  of the data and frequency distribution  for categorical 
variables. Estimate  for adherence rates will be obtain ed as the mean 
adherence rate along with the  correspondi ng 95% confid ence interval.

Subjects will be random ized 1:1 to be in the weekly internet survey 
group (appendix) or the stand ard care non-survey group. 
 
Principal Investigator will be blinded to randomization and study group 
assignments for all study participants for the duration of the study.  The 
study coordinator will perform randomization.  All assessments at sub -
sequential visits will be performed prior to review of survey inquiries.  
 
 
5.0 SUBJECTS RISKS AND BENEFITS 
 
5.1 Potential Risks of Study Parti cipation  
 
The risks  of this study are minim al. Subje cts would  have the same 
risk of using  bromonidine whether they were in the  study or not. 
 
Alternative treatments will be discuss ed with all subjects prior to 
enrolling in  the study. Alternative treatments for rosacea includ e, but 
are not limited to,  topical (applied to the skin)  antibiotic  treatments, 
such as clindamycin, o ral antibioti cs such as cephalexin, and the  use 
of antibacterial so aps. 
 
Answering questions  on the QOL surveys may make the  subject feel 
uncomfo rtable. Subje cts will answer these  surve ys in the privacy of 
WFUHS Dept of Dermatology 
Winston-Salem, NC   
11 
 the exam room a nd results will be  kept con fidential as part of  the 
study data. 
 
5.2 Adverse Ev ents 
 
An adverse event in this study of approved medications  is considered 
any unf avorable, harmful, or patholo gical change in a research subject 
as indi cated by physical signs, symptoms,  and/or clinically 
significant labo ratory abnorm alities that are consid ered product-
related. This d efinition  includ es: intercurrent illness; injuries; 
exacerbation of pre- existing  conditions  (excluding rosacea) ; adverse 
events occurring as a result of product withdr awal, abuse,  or 
overdose; and a change in a laboratory variable if consid ered by the 
attending physician to be clinically significant or if it caused (or 
should  have caused)  the clinici an to reduce or discontinue  the use  of 
the product or institute  therapy.  This definition  does not include  
inpatient  or outpatient  elective surgery for a condition  that was 
present prior to the start of the trial and which has not worsened 
unexpectedly during  the trial. 
  
To capture any adverse events related to rosacea, changes in lesion 
counts, papules and telangiectasia will be captured in the lesion count 
assessments. If a subject has an increase in visible papules (once t he 
erythema is improved with the study drug), then this will be captured 
as an AE if a concomitant medication is added.  
 
The investig ator will monitor  the occurrence of adverse events 
during the course  of the study. The investig ator must  provide  to the 
Sponsor appropriate information concerning any findi ngs that 
suggest significant h azards, contraindications, side effects or 
precautions  pertinent to the safety of the  study. 
 
All adverse events occurring after the Baseline visit must  be 
recorded on the Adverse Event Case Report Form page. 
 
 
 
 
5.3 Serious Adverse Ev ents 
 
1. Definition  An adverse event is co nsidered a serious adverse 
event (SAE)  if it: 
 
1. Is fatal  
2. is life  threatening (i.e., results in an immedi ate risk of 
death); 
3. is persistent ly or significantly disabling/incapacitating; 
WFUHS Dept of Dermatology 
Winston-Salem, NC   
12 
  
4. results in, or p rolongs, hospitali zation; 
 
5. results in a congenital anoma ly; 
 
6. is an event which, in the opinion  of the investig ator/Medi cal 
Monitor,  may jeopardize  the subject and may require  medi cal or 
surgical intervention  to prevent one  of the outcom es listed  in 
this s ection. 
 
The definition  of an SAE  encompass es both known  and 
unexpected events. 
 
2. Recording and Repo rting Obligations for  SAEs  
 
The investig ator will provide  the IRB  appropriate information  
concerning any findin gs that suggest the re has been an SAE  
related to the study drug. Any adverse event that  is consid ered 
serious  must  be reported within  one working day 
(IMME DIATELY) to the IRB .  Serious  adverse events 
(regardless of relationship)  must  also be reported to FDA. Clinic al 
judgment  should  be exercised in deciding wh ether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situ ations. Impor tant medi cal 
events that may not be immedi ately life- threatening, results in 
death, or hospitali zation but may jeopardize  the p atient or may 
require  intervention  to prevent one of the outcom es listed  
above, should  also be considered serious  and reported to the 
sponsors.  
 
 
 
 
5.4 Adverse Ev ent Follo w-up 
 
After the compl etion of the Screening visit,  all untoward medical 
events ( as defined in Section 5.2 above) will be document ed as 
Adverse Events throu gh the 6 Mo visit.  Any adverse events not 
resolved  by the 6 Mo visit and consid ered to be potential ly related 
to the study medi cation will be follow ed as clinically indicated until 
their resolution or, if non-resolvi ng, until conside red stable. 
 
5.5 Confid ential ity 
 
All information  provided by study particip ants will be kept 
confidential and identifi cation numbers/initi al will replace  particip ant 
names once enrolled and at data entry. All study materials (including  
compl eted qu estionn aires, medi cal histo ries, severity scores and 
WFUHS Dept of Dermatology 
Winston-Salem, NC   
13 
 adherence measures) will  be kept in locked files accessible  only to 
key study personn el. If the results of this study are written about in a 
journ al article  or presented at a profession al meeting, individu al 
participant n ames will not be us ed. 
 
5.6 Parti cipant Benefits 
 
Subje cts will be given bromonidine  gel at no cost to them. Subje cts 
may have dise ase improvement resulting  from particip ation in the 
study. Subje cts will  also be seen frequently in the dermatology clinic 
with the oppo rtunity to have  questions about th eir dise ase answer ed. 
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice 
or impact on their future health care.  
 
Subje cts will not be compens ated for particip ation in 
the study.  Study medication and study visits are 
provided at no cost.

6.3 Termination of S tudy 
 
Any subje ct may be discontinu ed from the study at any time at 
the disc retion of the investig ator if he/she feels it is in the best 
interest of that subj ect. 
 
A discontinu ation occurs when an enrolled subject ceases 
particip ation in the study prior to compl etion of the 6 month  
visit, regardless of reason. The investi gator must  determine  the 
reason for  discontinu ation of the study. If the subject 
discontinu es from the  study because of a serious  adverse 
event, the event must  be reported immedi ately to the IRB and 
be recorded in the case report form. 
 
Discontinuation 
 
A subje ct must be discontinued from the stu dy if he or 
she: 
1. Uses any medi cations used in the exclusion 
criteria 
2. Has an allergic reaction to the stu dy 
medi cation 
3. The investig ator decides it is in the subject’s best interest 
to discontinue  
4. Study is cancelled by PI or by the Institutional Review Board  
 
7.0 CONCOMITANT THERAPY 
 
Concomitant  medi cation is defined as any medication the subject takes that is not 
specified in the treatment protocol.  All such medi cations  must  be recorded in the 
subject’s medi cal record. The patient must  not use any of the medications listed  in 
the exclusion criteria, with one exception. If the subject complains of increased papules 
once baseline erythema has cleared and the patient  desires treatment for the papules, a 
topical therapy (such as metronidazole) may be added per standard of care. This should 
help with s ubject retention over the course of the study while not interfering with the 
overall objective of the study to measure adherence to brimonidine.  
 
 
WFUHS Dept of Dermatology 
Winston-Salem, NC   
17 
  
The subject is not allowed to undergo radiation therapy, use cytostatic drugs, or 
any investi gational agents for  the du ration of the stu dy. 
 
 
 
8.0 STUDY MANAGEMENT AND MATERIALS 
 
8.1 Study Materials 
 
Study medication will be  provided to the subject by the 
sponsor. . 
 
8.2 Study Documentati on 
 
8.2.1 Case  Report Forms (CRFs) and Sour ce Document Completion  
and Transf er of Study  Data  
 
The investi gator is required to prepare and maintain  adequate and 
accurate case histo ries (i.e. medi cal records) designed to re cord all 
observations and other  data pertinent to the study for each study 
particip ant. The medi cal records must  contain  adequate information  
to allow for verification of subj ect identi ty throughout the study. 
Investigators must  retain a subject identifi cation code list, should  they 
need to contact the subjects after the stu dy. This list should  contain  
subject’s name, study ID numb er and tel ephone  number  and/or

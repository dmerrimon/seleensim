Study  
Objectives  Primary objectives :  
1- To assess the safety and tolerability of LAU -7b in Cystic Fibrosis (CF ) patients by the 
incidence of treatment emergent advers e events as compared to placebo;  and  
2- To assess the efficacy of LAU -7b as depicted by the absolute change from Baseline in 
the Forced  Expiratory  Volume in 1 second ( FEV 1) percent predicted, relative to placebo -
treated patients.  
Secondary objectives:   
1- To assess the normalizing effect of LAU -7b on the key lipidomic markers in plasma 
phospholipids, such as arachidonic acid (AA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and the 
AA/DHA ratio;  
2- To evaluate the efficacy of LAU -7b on other clinically relevant parameters, such as 
Time -to-first protocol -defined Pulmonary Exacerbations (PEx ) and incidence of protocol -
defined PEx, change in weight and Body Mass Index (BMI ), usage of new antibiotics, and 
the change in C F Questionnaire Revised (CFQ -R);   
3- To evaluate the change in selecte d systemic inflammat ion markers;   
4- To d etermine if LAU -7b has an effect on lung colonization with Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa (Ps A), as measured by CFU in sputum;   
5- To explore the pharmacodynamics of LAU -7b on select systemic metabolipidomic 
markers, oxidative stress markers, bone formation/resorption , and ceramides subclass 
concentration;   
6- To explore the change in plasma AA/DHA ratio, inflammat ion markers and FEV 1 
between the start and the end of IV antibiotic treatment for a PEx (performed only in 
patients who  receive IV antibiotics for what their treating physician considers a PEx ); and  
7- To explore clinical scoring using the Matouk Disease Scorei. 
 
 
 
 
 
Study Rationale  
 
 
 
 
 
  
LAU -7b is a novel oral formulation of fenretinide developed as a first -in-class , once -a-
day, oral therapy with potential to be a master regulator of membrane lipid composition  
(essential fatty acids and sphingolipids) playing a dual role in i) the resolution of 
inflammation, and ii) stabilization of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance  
Regulator (CFTR) in the epithelial apical membrane duri ng inflammatory stress. Patients 
with CF have increased AA and decreased DHA levels, and th e abnormal metabolism of 
these lipids results in disruption in homeostasis of AA - and DHA -derived mediators 
eicosanoids and docosanoids, respect ively, which are profoundly involved in the 
modulation of the inflammation process. LAU -7b was shown to  trigger pro-resolving 
DHA pathway  endogenously , a new therapeutic approach using the body’s own ability to 
modulate inflammation without inducing immunosuppression.  An imbalance is also

Study Rationale 
(cont’d)  observed in certain sphingolipids, which are key components of membrane self -defense 
mechanism. More recently, LAU -7b was shown to enhance the partitioning of CFTR into 
sphingolipid -rich microdomains during cell ular stress , an effect that resulted in increased 
CFTR function.  
LAU -7b was recently tested in a  dose-ascending Phase 1b clinical study in adult CF 
patients, showing good safety and tolerability, vastly improved  pharmacokinetic s at doses 
up to 300mg , and promising pharmacodynamic  results.

Study Design 
Overview  
 
 
 
 
 
 APPLAUD is an international, multicentre, randomized, do uble-blind (patients, 
Investigators and blinded study staff), placebo controlled Phase II study of LA U-7b for 
the treatment of CF through its effect on the CF -linked AA/DHA imbalance.  
 
A minimum of  136 patients will be recruited and randomized for the treatment phase of 
the study with the expectation that at least  120 patients complete the study as per protocol. 
Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 double -blinded fashion to either LAU -7b 
(active) group or placebo (control) group, after stratification for 1 - baseline FEV 1, 2- PEx 
number in prior year,  and 3- Co-administration or not of Kalydeco® (ivacaftor) , 
Orkambi® (ivacaftor/lumacaftor) , Symdeko ® (ivacaftor/tezacaftor)  or another 
commercia lly available CFTR modulator product . Patients will  be enrolled at 
approximately 35-40 centers in the United States of America , Canada  and Australia, 
possibly in Europe .  
 
Patients undergoing PEx during the study will also be subjected to PEx -related 
assessments prior to - and after the therapeutic antibiotic course if the PEx severity meets 
the criteria for IV antibiotic treatment. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (D SMB) will 
be created for this study.

 • Screening  FEV 1 between 40 % and 100% predicted value for age, gender and height , 
in patients  capable of proper ly performing the test , and baseline FEV 1 within 15% of 
the screening value, indicative of stable pulmonary function at entry : 
• History of pulmonary exacerbation s, defined as at least one (1) pulmonary 
exacerbation in the year prior to Screening which resulted in documented IV or oral 
antibiotics ; 
• Clinically stable patients, i.e. patients that had n o change in their standard antibiotic 
medication within 5 weeks  prior to randomization, of which 2 weeks minimum are 
prior to  Screening ; 
• Patients are eligible independently of their history of  pulmonary PsA infection and 
their PsA status at screening. Medical charts will be reviewed for the  PsA history in 
the 12 months prior to screening ; 
• If taking Kalydeco® (ivacaftor) , Orkambi® (ivacaftor/lumacaftor) , Symdeko ® 
(ivacaftor/tezacaftor)  or another commercially available  CFTR modu lator product , 
patients must be taking it  for a minimum of 3 months prior to scree ning if naïve to 
CFTR modulators and 1 month if switched from another CFTR modulator  product , 
and deemed to tolerate it;  
• All patients, whether prescribed pancreatic enzyme re placement therapy or not, are 
eligible. However, modifications of the dosing regime during the study should be 
avoided ;  
• No change in CF and allowed systemic chronic therapy f or a minimum of 5 weeks 
prior to randomization, of which 2 weeks minimum are  prior to screening. Change s in 
non-CF therapy may be allowed during this period, on a case -by-case basis, after  
consultation with Laurent Pharmaceuticals .  Allowed concomitant diseases and 
treatment are listed in specific section ;  
• Female patients of child bearing potential should be on a highly effective contraceptive 
method during the study, such as hormonal contracepti ves, intrauterine device or tubal 
ligation.  Women of childbearing potential are defined as any f emale who has 
experienced menarche and who is NOT permanently sterile or postmenopausal. 
Postmenopausal is defined as 12 consecutive months with no menses without an 
alternative medical cause . In addition , since the potential of fenretinide to reduce the 
effectiveness of oral contraceptives  has not been established , such patients will be 
required to use a second contraceptive method such as a barrier metho d. The 
contraceptive methods will all be continued for a minimum of a month after the last 
dose of study treatment.  Periodical abstinence, calendar based methods and 
withdrawal are not considered effective methods of co ntraception ; 
• Male patients with spouse or partner of child bearing potential, or pregnant, are eligible 
if they use an appropriate method of contraception, such as condoms a nd spermicide, 
and if their non -pregnant spouse or partner use an appropriate method of contraception 
such as oral contraceptives or intrauterine device . The contraceptive methods will all 
be continued for a minimum of a month after the last dose of study treatment . Male 
patients with documented sterilization are allowed to waive the contraceptive me thods ; 
• Patients deemed capable of adequate compliance including attending scheduled visits 
for the duration of the study ; 
• The patient must be able to swallow the study drug cap sules.  
Study Exclusion Criteria:  
• Pregnancy: due to the potential teratogenic effects of retinoids, pregnant women are 
NOT eligible ; 
• Breast milk feeding by study patient is NOT allowed ; 
• Health condition deemed to possibly interfere with th e study endpoints and/or the 
safety of the patients. In case of doubt, the Investigator should consult with th e 
Sponsor’s medical representative ;

• Study treatment will be administered on top of current Standard of Care therapies.  
Statistical 
Analysis   
Sample size:  
A mi nimum of 136  CF patients will be randomized in this study. Sample size calculation 
is based on  the primary efficacy variable, FEV 1 % predicted (absolute change)  and on the 
following assumptions:

Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  9 of 94  • A t-test of the difference of the mean  absolute change in  FEV 1 of each group 
(active versus placebo) will be used;  
• The FEV 1 (absolute change) data is normally distributed in each treatment group;  
• The FEV 1 variance, expressed as the Standard Deviation (SD) is 8%;  
• The FEV 1 clinical difference of interest (effect size) is 4%;  
• The minimum statistical power of the t -test is 80% (0.8);  
 
A minimum of 60 completed patients per group will be required to detect as significant a 
difference of 4% between fenretinide and placebo for FEV 1 % predicted (absolute change).  
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis:  
In the analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline in FEV 1 % 
predicted (absolute change), including all measurements up to Week 28 (both during and 
after treatment measurements, including after treatment discontinuation) will be analyzed 
based on a mixed -effect repeated -measure model. Even though no imputations will be 
used in the primary analysis, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted where missing data 
points will be imputed using appropriate interpolation methods; extrapolation me thods 
will be used for truncated FEV 1 % predicted values . 
The model will include the absolute change from basel ine in FEV 1 % predicted as the 
dependent variable; treatment, visit, and treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed effects; and 
patient as a random effect with adjustments for a) FEV 1 % predicted determined at the 
Screening/Baseline Visits (average where possible), b) PEx number in the prior year ,	and	
c) Co -administration or not of Kalydeco® (ivacaftor) , Orkambi® (ivacaftor/lumacaftor) , 
Symdeko ® (ivacaftor/tezacaftor)  or another commercially available CFTR modulator 
product . The primary result obtained from the model will be the treatment effect at Week 
24. The estimated mean treatment effect, a 95% confidence interval, and a 2 -sided P value 
will be generated.  
 
The statistical analyses for the other study paramet ers are summarized in the Statistical 
Analysis, Section 12, and will be detailed in the SAP.

LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  19 of 94  5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Investigational product  
LAU -7b is a solid oral dosage form of fenretinide (100mg capsules). Fenretinide, a small molec ule synthetic 
retinoid derivative, is an investigational drug (new chemical entity) with we ll-documented history of safety 
in non-clinical and clinical studies (R.W. Johnson, US National Cancer Institut e (NCI) since 1992). The 
active product ingredient is N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide, also referred to as 4-HPR or FRD, and is a 
synthetic amide of all-trans retinoic acid with a molecular formula C 26H33NO 2. An earlier oral formulation 
of fenretinide (corn oil-based 100mg softgel) has been extensively studied in clinic al studies, mostly for th e 
prevention and treatment of cancer. Fenretinide has not yet been commercialized in any country.  
 
LAU -7b is a novel and improved oral formulation of fenretinide. The investigational product form ulation of 
LAU -7b contains the following non-medicinal ingredients: polyvinylpyrrolidone, butylated hydroxyanisole, 
butylated hydroxytoluene, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, microcrystalli ne cellulose, dibasic 
calcium phosphate dihydrate and ascorbic acid. The capsule shell contains the foll owing dyes: FD&C Red 
#3, FD&C Yellow #6 and titanium dioxide. 
 
An orange opaque, size 00 hard gelatin capsule without active substance will be used as a control and 
matching placebo for blinding purposes and contains the same non-medicinal ingredients. 
 
5.1.1 Rationale for LAU-7b, a novel and improved oral formulation of fenretinide 
 
Fenretinide is poorly absorbed following oral administration, and it suffers from a wide  inter-patient variation 
in bioavailability when delivered orally in an oily vehicle, such as the softge l capsules used in most oncology 
trials, which contains fenretinide suspended in corn oil. The poor bioavailability a nd the large size of the 
softgel capsules was a limiting factor in the clinical studies conduct ed so far, especially in pediatric 
population. 
In the past, fenretinide has also been formulated in a lipid matrix, Lym-X-Sorb (L XS) 1, containing 2% of 
fenretinide and administrated as an oral powder delivered in non-milk fat-containing foods , and especially 
as a slurry in non-milk fat-containing, or soy-based nutritional supplements. However, thi s formulation has 
been shown to be associated with significant gastrointestinal side-effects , especially at higher doses2, as well 
as to significant patient withdrawal due to the taste and texture of the medication.   
There was thus a need for new pharmaceutical dosage form of fenretinide, especia lly for oral administration, 
capable of overcoming the poor oral bioavailability of corn-oil based formulation and the fair patient 
compliance. Dosage forms such as hard gelatin capsules, tablets, caplets, suspensions, or powders for 
suspensions were to be considered.  
Laurent Pharmaceuticals has developed a novel oral dosage form of fenretinide wit h increased oral 
bioavailability and formulated as a powder that can be encapsulated or compress ed in various sizes, thus with 
expected better compliance for both adult and pediatric patient populations, more s pecifically by reducing 
the size/number of unit dosage forms to ingest. The new formulation (LAU-7b) is an a morphous solid 
dispersion of fenretinide obtained by spray-drying and formulated as 100mg, size 00, hard gelati n capsules. 
A first generation of this capsule formulation (stored at -20 °C) was successfully tested by Laurent 
Pharmaceuticals in a Phase 1b study involving adult CF patients 3. A slightly modified, second generation 
capsule formulation was developed for this Phase 2 study, having an improved chemical  stability allowing 
storage under refrigerated conditions (2-8°C). The se changes consist in adding non-medicinal anti-oxidants 
that are not expected to modify the oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profile of fenretinide.

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common fatal hereditary disease among Cauca sians, affecting an estimated 
70,000 people worldwide. CF is caused by mutations in the gene encoding for the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ), a protein that acts as a chloride channel. Over 1,900 
mutations have been described in the  CFTR  gene, the most common of which is F508del. The disruption of 
chloride and sodium transport is considered the basic defect in CF, resulting in vi scous secretions in different 
exocrine tissues, mainly the respiratory tract, pancreas, gastrointestinal tra ct, and sweat glands. The most 
debilitating consequence is the viscous secretions blocking the airways and i mpairing mucociliary clearance, 
the primary defense mechanism that protects the lungs from deleterious effects  of pathogens, leading to 
chronic lung infections, most commonly involving Pseudomonas aeruginosa  (PsA).  
CF is also characterized by an abnormally activated inflammatory response in the lung, which overreacts in 
the presence of pathogens and leads to irreversible lung damage 4, 5. More recent evidences suggest that the 
excessive and persistent inflammation in the human CF airways is indicat ive of an inflammatory response 
that begins early in life, is of greater magnitude than is observed in patients  without CF and persists beyond 
apparent eradication of infectious stimuli 6. Multiple studies involving infants have demonstrated that the 
inflammatory response in CF lung may be upregulated even before evidence of infection or m ucus plugging, 
including increased levels of multiple cytokines and infiltration of neutrophils 7. Paradoxically, this pro-
inflammatory and predominantly neutrophilic environment is still unable to fight the opportunistic 
pathogens. On the contrary, constant inflammation stimulates more mucus secret ion, and the inability to clear 
mucus from the lungs results in frequent bacterial infections, which triggers more inflammatory responses, 
resulting in an inflammation-infection vicious cycle that leads to chronic i nflammation and infection, and to 
progressive loss in lung function over time. Severe pulmonary dysfunction is the usual ca use of death in CF. 
Since both lung defense mechanisms are compromised by the mutant CFTR, there is  a high need of disease-
modifying therapies addressing not only the mucociliary clearance, but also the com promised immune-
inflammatory response.  
In addition to the disruption of inflammatory response mechanisms in the lung, CF pati ents have long been 
known to be associated with abnormal fatty acid metabolism, which is now be lieved to be directly linked to 
the defective CFTR function 8, 9, 10, 11. CF patients display an increased level of arachidonic acid (AA), which 
is an agonist of inflammatory pathways, and low level of docosahexaenoic acid (DH A) that has anti-
inflammatory, protective and pro-resolving roles during the inflammatory process 12.  
AA and DHA are essential fatty acids that cannot be synthesized by huma ns, and are derived from nutritional 
intake. Their metabolism is the source for the synthesis of eicosanoids (AA-de rived, such as prostaglandins, 
leukotrienes and lipoxins), and docosanoids (DHA-derived, such as resolvins and protectins ). Eicosanoids 
and docosanoids are key inflammatory mediators involved in the modulation of the innate  immune-
inflammatory response following bacterial challenge or other type of injury. Thus, the hom eostasis of 
eicosanoids and docosanoids is crucial in maintaining an efficient and balance d immune-inflammatory 
response.  
The high AA levels displayed in CF patients may increase the pro-inflamma tory factors and stimulate mucus 
secretion, while the low DHA levels, important in the anti-inflammatory de fense and the resolution of 
inflammation, may explain why CF patients have an exaggerated and unresolved inflam matory response that, 
paradoxically, is unable to fight opportunistic infections 13, 14, 15. Thus, the innate lipid imbalance found in 
all CF patients could play a major role in the initiation, maintenance a nd degree of progression of the 
infection-inflammation vicious cycle in CF patients, potentially being the “ missing link” between the 
defective CFTR and the compromised host response 16, 17.

Despite the significant advances made in CF research in the recent years , Cystic Fibrosis remains a complex 
and heterogeneous genetic disorder with a large unmet medical need. There has be en progress made on 
several fronts hence the longer (and still lengthening) life expectancy of CF patie nts. There is no permanent 
cure available for CF, and the current drug therapies goals are to reduce the symptom s of disease, such as 
preventing progression of lung infection by removal of the mucus plugging from the lungs, controlling the 
infection and inflammation, controlling the nutrition level, and ultimately increa sing survival. Gene therapy, 
which means adding a normal copy of the CFTR  gene, was unsuccessful to date because of the challenges in 
finding a good delivery vehicle that can bring the gene to the targeted organs.  
A recent and promising area of research has been the development of CFTR  modulators, some being 
potentiators, some being correctors of the CFTR- protein function, the basic defect in CF. Because there are 
many gene mutations in CF, the CFTR-modulators developed are very specific and targe ting only 
subpopulations of CF patients. For example, Kalydeco Ò (ivacaftor), Orkambi Ò (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) and 
Symdeko Ò (ivacaftor/tezacaftor), the only CFTR -modulators approved, target currently about 6% and 
greater than 30/30% of CF patients, respectively. Since its launch in 2012, Kalydec oÒ showed promising 
results in the improvement of the function of the defective CFTR  protein, leading to better lung function, 
weight gain and lower sweat chloride levels. The R&D effort continues in order t o develop better generations 
of CFTR- modulators, targeting more mutations and re-establishing more of the defective protei n function. 
This is exemplified by the recent discovery that it is possible to potenti ate the function of CTFR  by targeting 
key membrane lipids (essential fatty acids and sphingolipids). 
Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the pathogenesis of CF, the connection 
between CFTR  dysfunction and the chronic inflammation is still not completely understood, espec ially, being 
the least addressed component of CF airway disease at this time. Current a nti-inflammatory treatments (high 
doses of ibuprofen and corticosteroids) have limited effectiveness in improving the s ymptoms of 
inflammation and the side effects associated with these drugs are severe  thus they are rarely prescribed. 
Nevertheless, whether they are currently available or in development, anti-inflam matory, mucus regulation, 
anti-infective and nutritional therapeutic approaches only improve the quality of life  of the patients and seek 
to ameliorate symptoms that are later stage manifestations of the disease.  
It is in this context (Figure 1) that Laurent Pharmaceuticals is targeting a long time neglected approach in 
CF: the innate AA/DHA imbalance present in all CF patients, and whic h could play a major role in the 
initiation, maintenance and degree of progression of the infection-inflammation vici ous cycle. Furthermore, 
through recent advances, LAU-7b is also targeting the stabilization of CFTR i n the epithelial apical 
membrane during inflammatory stress, thus potentially increasing CFTR function.

5.4 Study Rationale  
 
Notwithstanding the significant advances made in CF research, the mechanism  by which the mutation in the 
CFTR  gene leads to the compromised immune-inflammatory response remains unclear. Al though the 
dysfunction of the CFTR -protein explains the mechanisms leading to mucus plugging and the defective 
mucociliary clearance in the lungs, which creates a favorable environment for infe ction, it does not entirely 
explain the predisposition for exaggerated inflammatory response even in the absence  of detectable infection. 
It is neither fully understood why the inflammation remains neutrophilic and does not resolve, nor the 
inability of the innate immune system to manage lung infections, especiall y when opportunistic pathogens 
are involved. 
Indeed, a recent study involving Kalydeco Ò in G551D homozygote patients showed that the CFTR -
modulation improves FEV 1, reduces exacerbations, improves Quality of Life and reduces PsA colonization, 
but does not impact the inflammation markers 18. Moreover , CFTR -modulators only address specific CF 
phenotypes and they are not expected to completely reverse the existing organ damage , and patients still have 
exaggerated but ineffective airway inflammation failing to eradicate pulmonary opportunistic pathogens .  
Due to its abnormality and chronic manifestations, the regulation of inflammatory response remains one of 
the most important and unaddressed pathogenic mechanisms in CF. With ibuprofen being t he only anti-
inflammatory drug recommended in patients with CF, but only used in about 10% of patients , there is a 
significant need for novel therapies that can control inflammation in the lung ti ssue in a disease-modifying 
manner, addressing the link between the CFTR  dysfunction and the aberrant immune-inflammatory response. 
Previous attempts to control inflammation in the inflamed CF lungs have been uns uccessful and resulted in 
frequent lung exacerbations and serious adverse events 19. This is likely due to the fact that inhibition of 
inflammation can also inhibit the ability of patient’ immune system to fight infections 20. 
While there are many therapies addressing the mucociliary clearance and rel ated complications, little was 
done to understand and address the delicate balance between pro-inflammatory and a nti-inflammatory 
signaling in CF, so essential for lung homeostasis. Thus, there is a high need for novel anti-inflammatory 
therapies that can safely control inflammation in the lung tissues of patie nts without suppressing their 
immune response. This is a particularly challenging unmet need, and a better unde rstanding of the 
inflammatory and immune responses in CF lungs is needed. The development of such tre atments could also 
prevent the initiation of the inflammation-infection vicious cycle and the cons equent lung damage, which is 
Confidential and Proprietary  
Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  23 of 94  the most frequent cause of mortality in CF. Therefore, drugs that interfere upstream with the cycle of 
infection and inflammation, and that can be administrated early in life, are the best hope for preventing the 
decline in lung function, representing one of the highest unmet needs for this disease. 
All anti-inflammatory approaches explored thus far exclusively targeted the inhibiti on of pro-inflammatory 
signaling. The history of their failure showed that aggressively turning “off” the infla mmatory process may 
result in inhibition of the ability of patient’ immune system to fight infecti ons and could result in more 
infections and pulmonary exacerbations 19, 20. New approaches are needed for targeting the underlying 
mechanism between the CFTR dysfunction and the compromised innate immune-inflamm atory response. It 
is in this context that targeting the AA/DHA imbalance is emerging a s a new treatment paradigm, with 
potential to modulate both “on” and “off” inflammatory signaling and re-establish t he lung homeostasis in a 
disease-modifying manner. Likewise, more recent evidences show that the sta bilization of membrane 
sphingolipid self-protection mechanism 21 can have effects on CFTR protein insertion and stability in the 
airway epithelial apical membrane, thus confirming the important link betwe en inflammation and the basic 
defect in CF. 
5.4.1 Inflammation and fatty acids metabolism in CF 
Alterations in the metabolism of key fatty acids are known for decades as one  of the hallmarks of CF and 
have been validated in patients and in multiple animal models of disease . CF patients have increased levels 
of AA and decreased DHA. AA and DHA are considered essential fatty ac ids because they cannot be 
synthesized by humans, and are received from nutrition. Their metabolism is the s ource for the synthesis of 
eicosanoids (AA-derived, such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes and lipoxins), and docosanoids (DHA-
derived, such as resolvins and protectins). Eicosanoids and docosanoids are key inflamm atory mediators 
involved in the modulation of the innate immune-inflammatory response following bacteri al challenge or 
other type of injury.  
The homeostasis of eicosanoids and docosanoids is crucial in maintaining an e fficient and balanced immune-
inflammatory response. The high AA levels displayed in CF patients may increa se the pro-inflammatory 
factors and stimulate mucus secretion, while the low DHA levels, import ant in the anti-inflammatory defense 
and the resolution of inflammation, may explain why CF patients have an exaggerate d and unresolved 
inflammatory response that, paradoxically, is unable to fight opportunistic infections such as PsA.  
The abnormal AA/DHA metabolism was initially believed to result ei ther from notorious bacterial infections 
occurring the lungs of CF patients, or being a consequence of malabsorption, hepatic dysfunct ion or 
secondary to infection. The intense basic research by several laboratories, have demonstrated that imbalance 
of AA and DHA represents a primary effects in CF, linked with CFTR gene defici ency and not secondary to 
other disease manifestations 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 22, 23, 24.  The abnormal fatty acids metabolism observed in CF 
patients has major impact on the cellular and intracellular phospholipid mem branes. They are important 
regulators of signaling channels, protein function, permeability, caveolae building and are  involved in the 
regulation of several genes expression 9. Lipid imbalance can be observed even in newborn mice with ablated 
CFTR gene, which are kept in pathogen free conditions 12, 25, 26. Furthermore, a correlation was shown 
between the severity of CF lung disease and lipid deregulation  10, 13. Interestingly, the lipid imbalance 
“signature” does not appear to be related to the type of CFTR mutation, thus holding the promise of a therapy 
that could benefit all CF patients. 
In response to injury or infection, macrophages and epithelial cells secrete che mokines and cytokines, which 
stimulate AA release from membrane lipids, leading to production of pro- inflamm atory eicosanoids (such 
as leukotrienes and prostaglandins). These pro-inflammatory mediators further stimulat e mucus secretion by 
goblet cells and promote acute tissue inflammation, with neutrophil accumula tion in infected/damaged sites 
to neutralize and eliminate potentially injurious stimuli. Once the sti muli are neutralized, the inflammation 
enters the resolution phase, where apoptotic neutrophils undergo surface changes enabling phagocytes to

Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  24 of 94  recognize and ingest them 15, 27. Resolution of inflammation not only depends on the removal of apoptotic 
cells but also on suppression of pro-inflammatory mediators’ production, as well as  the active involvement 
of anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediators generated from AA (such as lipoxins) and from DHA 
precursors (such as resolvins and protectins). The timely resolution of inflammation is as important as the 
initiation phase and a good balance between pro- inflammatory and anti-inflammatory (and pro-resolving) 
mediators is key to maintaining an efficient and harmless inflammatory respons e. Incomplete resolution leads 
to chronic inflammation and destruction of lung tissue, and ultimately to lung insuffi ciency and impairment 
15, 27. 
Inflammation signaling in the CF lung is a reflection of an imbalance betwee n the initiation and resolution 
of the inflammatory response, with pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators being over-e xpressed, while 
anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediators are suppressed (Figure 2). When counter-regulat ory controls 
are abnormal, an imbalance occurs, resulting in prolonged and excessive inflammatory mediator production, 
fueling the destructive inflammatory cascade.  
 
Figure 2: Imbalance in inflammatory signalling in CF lung  
It is unlikely that a single defect in one pathway accounts for the entirety of the exaggerated inflammatory 
response. Airway surface fluid from CF patients contains large concentrations of pro-i nflammatory mediators 
including the tissue necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, and granulocyte-mac rophage 
colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF) 28. The synthesis of these mediators is promoted by a few transcription 
factors including AP-1, nuclear factor (NF)-κB, and mitogen-activated protein kinases  (MAPK ), 
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2). In addition to a heightened pro-inflamm atory arm, there 
appears to be inappropriately decreased counter-regulatory pathways, particularly those involving IL-10 and 
nitric oxide. 
Another mechanism of inhibiting NF-kB activity occurs via up-regulation of peroxisome prol iferator 
activating receptor (PPAR). CF tissues appear to be deficient in PPAR 29, 30, 31, 32, leading to an imbalance 
between IκB and NF-κB and favors increased inflammation. Activation of PPAR may quell the CF 
inflammatory response. Interestingly, abnormalities in the fatty acid content of CF  cells, with deficiencies of 
both DHA and linoleic acid, may contribute to impaired PPAR signaling. Indeed, the  pro-inflammatory 
response and altered fatty acid metabolism in CF are linked to decreased e xpression of PPAR in epithelial 
cells and macrophages and corrected by DHA treatment in CFTR mice model 33, 34. $  Pro-inflammatory mediators

underlying physiological abnormality due to abnormal CFTR. The end result is that the delicate balance 
between the pro- and anti-inflammatory arms is disrupted, and pathways promoting the  activation and 
perpetuation of the inflammatory response are favored.  
Inhibiting the exaggerated pro-inflammatory signaling while augmenting the anti-inflam matory and pro-
resolving signaling is a desired but never achieved approach to address the abnormal immune-inflammatory 
response in CF. The documented AA/DHA defective metabolism, resulting in an abundance and persistence 
of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, together with a defective generation of anti-infla mmatory and pro-
resolving lipid mediators in the airways of CF patients, may be the link betw een the CFTR gene defect and 
the compromised immune-inflammatory response, thus emerging as an important therapeutic target.  
Thus, AA/DHA modulation could address the aberrant immune-inflammatory response in a disease-
modifying manner, with effect on the inflammation-infection vicious cycle, as show ed by Dr. Radzioch’s 
team at McGill University in the next section.  
5.4.2 Fatty acids metabolism and fenretinide; Preclinical Evidence and Propos ed Mechanism of 
Action  
5.4.2.1  Preclinical Evidences 
Evidence of early upregulation of inflammation and lipid imbalance was also show n in Cftr.KO (Knock-
Out) mice by Dr. Radzioch team . This team, in collaboration with Dr. Lap-Chee Tsui team at University of 
Toronto, developed a specific mouse model (B6-Cftr.KO) that has most of the characte ristics of human CF 
lung disease: inflammatory cell infiltration and mucus accumulation, ineffect ive mucociliary transport, 
interstitial basement membrane thickening and chronic inflammatory cell rec ruitment leading to progressive 
lung impairment, even when they were not exposed to any lung pathogens  25, 26, 35.	Based on these evidences 
it is postulated that inflammation in CF has two components:  
• Intrinsic inflammation : An innate over-expression of pro-inflammatory genes related to the CFTR  gene 
defect, resulting in an imbalanced and over-reactive inflammatory response that fails to defend against 
infection with opportunistic bacteria such as PsA. This effect is measurable by the presence of increased 
pro-inflammatory factors and AA levels, and decreased anti-inflammatory factors and DHA levels, 
known to be a hallmark of CF disease in patients, regardless of their type of mutation.  
• Secondary inflammation : Triggered by the chronic lung infection, thus indirectly affecting the CFTR 
protein function and subsequent defective mucociliary clearance. 
 
Using B6-Cftr.KO animal models, the McGill team demonstrated that oral tre atment with fenretinide was 
able to increase the levels of DHA in CFTR -knockout mice, and it brought the levels of AA down to the 
levels observed in wild-type mice. Normalization of AA/DHA ratios transl ated into decreased expression of 
inflammatory genes normally overexpressed in CFTR -KO mice (IL-1β and S100A8) and also resulted in a 
dramatic improvement in fighting pulmonary infections of PsA. Results also showed that fenretinide caused 
a significant and rapid corrective effect on the AA/DHA imbalance in the liver, ileum and pancreas of CFTR -
KO mice 24. 
In the same vein fenretinide normalized the levels of a few species of ce ramides, which levels correlated with 
the AA/DHA imbalance, an observation made in both the CF mouse model and CF patients, providing more 
insights on the importance of lipid homeostasis in CF 36.  
Very relevant to CF is the recent discovery using the CFTR channel functional mode l (Ussing chamber) on 
human airway epithelial cells from CF donors under bacterial stress. Fenretini de has the ability to increase

the formation of CFTR-containing platforms in response to cellular stress during infla mmation. This effect 
is due to the rebalancing of very long chain ceramide levels by fenretinide in t he cells membrane. This 
functional effect on CFTR is enhanced when cells are stressed with PsA, then treated with fenretinide. This 
effect is further enhanced in the presence of CFTR correction by lumacaftor (VX-809) 21, 37. 
A study by the same group at McGill characterized the protective effect of fenretinide on the early onset of 
osteoporosis in CFTR -knockout mice 38. Reduced bone mineral density, resulting in osteopenia and 
osteoporosis, is a common phenotype associated with CF. Treatment with fenreti nide dramatically increased 
trabecular bone volume compared to controls in animal models, an effect correlate d to down-regulation of 
phospholipid-bound AA in the CFTR -deficient mice. 
In mouse model of spinal cord injury, fenretinide treatment resulted in significant enhancement of locomotor 
recovery and greater protection of spinal motor neuron fibers compared to untreated mic e 39. Fenretinide 
treatment lead to a reduction of AA and increase of DHA levels in the pl asma and spinal cord as well as a 
reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α and iNOS, and attenuation of 
oxidative stress after the contusion injury of spinal cord. Fenretinide was also found to be an effective agent 
targeting inflammation, oxidation, and lung pathology observed in a mouse model of allergic asthma 40. 
 
5.4.2.2  Proposed Mechanism of Action 
Fenretinide is not a typical retinoid; it does not have a terminal carboxyl group  believed to be an essenti al 
feature for active retinoids. However, it has been shown to have certain biologic al activities associated with 
the retinoid class. Fenretinide is a potent transactivator of retinoid aci d receptor (RAR)γ and a moderate 
activator of RARβ, but is not an activator of RARα and retinoid-X-receptor (RXR)α 41. 
Fenretinide corrects AA/DHA imbalance by a mode of action addressing the c omplex links between lipid 
metabolism and inflammatory signaling, which is distinct from the retinoid c lass mechanism of action. 
Although the complete mechanism of action in CF is not fully elucidated, it was shown that fenretinide 
corrects the AA/DHA imbalance and inhibits macrophage inflammatory mediat ors via the ERK 1/2 pathway 
42. Fenretinide was also shown to inhibit the activation of the pro-inflammatory transcriptional NF- κB 43, as 
well as inhibit the downregulation of PPARγ, which is known to have a role in lipid metabolism 44. The pro-
inflammatory response and altered fatty acid metabolism in CF are linked to decreased expression of PPARγ 
in epithelial cells and PPARα in macrophages. 	More recent evidences demonstrated fenretinide’s ability to 
modulate ceramide biosynthesis by reducing the dihydroceramide desaturase (Des1) expre ssion 45 and to 
increase the function of CFTR protein through its activity on the lipid microdomains (rafts) in the cell 
membrane. This multi-target mechanism of action in CF is illustrated in Figure 3.

Figure 3: Fenretinide proposed mode of action in CF  
All three targets, ERK 1/2, NF-κB and PPARγ are known to be important components of the pro-
inflammatory pathways in the CF lung, and are all influenced by fenretinide. The ant i-inflammatory and pro-
apoptotic role via modulation of ceramides is still in exploration, but there a re evidences suggesting that their 
modulation is also important in balancing the pro- and anti-inflammatory responses, in neutrophils apoptotic 
mechanism, as well as in the internalization of PsA bacteria 24, 36, 46. Dr. Radzioch group also shown that 
fenretinide is able to reduce the markers of oxidation, potentially protecting DHA  from peroxidation 39, which 
is particularly important in periods of intense oxidative stress such as pulmonary exacerbations.  
Low-dose fenretinide appears to modulate DHA metabolism via ∆6-desaturase in CF patients (Phase 1b of 
LAU -7b in CF patients, unpublished data). The effect of fenretinide on other desaturases was already 
described in literature: modulation of ceramide biosynthesis by reducing the express ion of dihydroceramide 
desaturase (∆4-desaturase) 45, and inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (∆9-desaturase) in retinal cell 
lines47. The protection of the DHA from peroxidation during the constant inflammatory state in the lungs 
would indirectly decrease the AA, as DHA is a natural down-regulator of AA. Overall, fenretinide appears 
to affect the inflammation process at multiple levels, involving both pro- and a nti-inflammatory pathways, 
thus confirming a multi-target effect usually seen with disease-modifying drugs. 
Of particular relevance to the current treatment trends in CF is the modulat ing effect of fenretinide on specific 
ceramides, down-regulating long chain ceramides and up-regulating very long chain cera mides (VLCC) 
through ceramide synthase 5 (Cers 5). VLC C are sphingolipids constituents of the lipid rafts at the surface 
of cell membrane and are essential to stabilize the CFTR protein 21. These results in improved trafficking 
and expression of corrected CFTR 37. While CFTR protein function can be improved by CFTR correctors 
(e.g. VX-809, lumacaftor), the CFTR protein still needs structured lipid rafts in order t o migrate to the cell 
surface and express itself. Therefore, fenretinide could have a dual effect on CFTR: i) increasing CFTR 
trafficking and its functional expression at the surface of cell membrane by improvi ng composition of the 
lipid rafts, and ii) protecting lipid rafts from oxidative depletion in an environment of constant inflammation.   
 
Thus, an efficacious lipid modulator can potentially address the inflammation-i nfection vicious cycle by 
acting upstream on the immune-inflammatory pathway, and being complementary to the mucociliary 
correction provided by the CFTR -modulators. If the benefits seen in CFTR -KO mice are duplicated in

irrespective of their type of mutation.  Fenretinide has the potential of being one of the few therapies that 
could prevent early colonization in younger patients by improving the host response, protect from 
deterioration the lungs in chronic patients by promoting a pro-resolving effect on inflamm ation. Moreover, 
since the lipid imbalance is present in all patients and is targeti ng an alternative pathogenic pathway, this 
drug would not compete but rather complement all the other therapies, symptomatic  or disease modifying. 	
Furthermore, by its effect on CFTR lipids raft and trafficking LAU-7b can also have a  potentiating effect on 
CFTR modulators.

5.4.3 Supportive nonclinical experience with fenretinide 
5.4.3.1  Mechanism of Action in Cancer and other Indications  
Fenretinide appears to act by different pathways than those mediated by retinoid receptors. Studies in breast 
cancer cell lines have demonstrated that fenretinide has a low binding affini ty for nuclear retinoic acid 
receptors (RARs) compared with trans-retinoic acid. Despite the similaritie s with other retinoids, 
comparative studies with the parent compound ATRA (all-trans-retinoic acid) sugges t that fenretinide 
mediates its key apoptotic and anti-tumor cytotoxic activity through a novel mec hanism, not completely 
understood 48, 49, 50, 51, potentially involving modulation of saturated and unsaturated ceramides in cell lines 
from various tumors. Furthermore, evidence shows that another of the drug’s molecular target s is mammalian 
Target Of Rapamycin “mTOR”, which is a central control of cell growth and divi sion. The differential 
responsiveness of numerous cell lines, confirms that fenretinide has a mechanis m of action distinct from the 
retinoid receptor pathway. 
 
Fenretinide was also shown to form complexes with the retinol binding protein (RBP )4, reducing serum 
concentrations of retinol (vitamin A), which is potentially associated wit h the reversible delayed dark 
adaptation (nyctalopia, also called night blindness) in some patients. However, the effect on RBP4 is also a 
potential disease-modifier in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), an unaddres sed chronic eye

5.4.3.2  Fenretinide Nonclinical Toxicity 
 
R.W. Johnson conducted toxicity studies of fenretinide via per-os (PO), intra-peritoneal (IP), or intravenous 
(IV) routes of administration in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs, and many of the studies  carried out were 
published 53, 54, 55, 56. Doses of up to 7000 mg/kg were given in acute studies, while in multiple-dose s tudies 
doses of up to 1800 mg/kg/day were administered. No mortality was observed in acute studies. Clinical 
observations following administration of high oral doses consisted primarily of diarrhea, loose stools, 
unkempt appearance, and reduced spontaneous activity. In multiple dose toxicity studie s, up to one-year 
duration, mortality in fenretinide-treated animals was rare and occurred in less than 5% of animals tested. 
Dose-related toxicities were observed in some of these studies including mi ld intermittent reductions in body 
weight and food consumption, decreased erythrocyte parameters and serum protein levels, and increased 
plasma alkaline phosphatase and serum cholesterol levels. In addition, modest dose-related elevations in 
serum ALT and/or AST levels were observed in the 3-month rat and 1-year dog studi es. Collectively, the 
reduction in serum protein levels and elevations in serum cholesterol and liver enzymes levels may be 
indicative of a mild hepatic dysfunction following high doses of fenretinide. Pathologic  or histopathologic 
evidence of liver damage was generally not observed in toxicity studies with fe nretinide, although liver 
pathology was observed in the 3-week IP studies in rats and mice at doses equiva lent to the 21-day estimated 
LD 50 values for fenretinide in these species. Finally, in a dog cardiovascular toxic ity study, fenretinide up to 
10 mg/kg was not shown to affect cardiovascular parameters, including ECG, heart rat e and mean arterial 
pressure. 
 
Carcinogenic Potential . The carcinogenic potential of fenretinide administered PO in the food was 
evaluated in 2-year studies in rats and mice. After 24 months of treatment, t here were no gross observations 
of tumors at necropsy in the rat study. However, histopathologic examination during a 1 -year interim analysis 
of the 2-year mouse study revealed an increased incidence of hemangiosarcomas at  the highest dose of 
fenretinide administered (1000 mg/kg/day). After 20 months of treatment, tumors were als o found in animals 
administered with 100 mg/kg/day (males only) and 300 mg/kg/day of fenretinide. The occurrence  was dose 
and time dependent 54. The clinical significance of this finding is uncertain due to over 10,000-fold higher 
susceptibility of hemangiosarcomas to develop in mice than in humans 57.  
 
Reproductive Toxicity Studies . Doses ranging from 20 to 800 mg/kg/day (120 - 4800 mg/m2) had no effect 
on the fertility and general reproductive performance of female or male rats; howeve r, the complete inhibition 
of uterine implantation has been reported in mice receiving 100 mg/kg/day of fenretinide . Studies in rats and 
rabbits indicated that 800 mg/kg/day dose of fenretinide was teratogenic. The key role of retinoic acid in 
embryonic development mediates the high teratogenicity of retinoid pharmaceutica ls, such as isotretinoin 
used for treatment of cancer and acne. Oral megadoses of pre-formed vitamin A (ret inyl palmitate), and 
retinoic acid itself, also have teratogenic potential by this same mec hanism. A screen of retinoids for 
developmental toxicity following single-dose PO administration to hamsters on D ay 8 of gestation suggested 
that fenretinide was less teratogenic than ATRA 58, 59. Late gestation, parturition and pup survival were 
unaffected in a peri-postnatal toxicity study.

genotoxic effects 60. Its major metabolite, 4-MPR, was also negative in the mammalian cell mutation assa y. 
 
Metabolism and Excretion . Animal and human studies indicate that fenretinide undergoes significant phase  
1 and phase 2 biotransformation in-vivo. The most abundant metabolite produced in human, dogs and rodents 
in in-vivo is N-(4-methoxyphenyl)retinamide (4-MPR) 61, 62, whereas additional minor metabolites, 4-oxo-
N-(4 hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-oxo-fenretinide) and 4-hydroxy-N-(4 hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4- OH-
fenretinide), have been subsequently reported 63. In contrast to rodents, 4-oxo-fenretinide is present at low 
concentrations in humans. Although 4-MPR is now generally considered to be inactive  64, 65, 4-oxo 
fenretinide was found to be an active metabolite that inhibits cell proliferation 63, 66. 
The enzymes responsible for production of 4-MPR (phase 2, methylation reaction) were not clearly 
determined, however they include microsomal amine-N-methyltransferases, that are  known to be involved 
in the metabolism of many drugs and carcinogens 67. The oxidative metabolism (phase1) is predominantly 
carried out by cytochromes P450 (CYP)s 3A4, 3A5, 2C8 and 26A1. Glucuronidation was shown to not 
playing a major role in the metabolism and clearance of fenretinide and its metabolites at clinically relevant 
levels 68. The metabolic profile of fenretinide in human indicates a relatively low pot ential for drug-drug 
interactions. 
5.4.4 Clinical Evidences  
5.4.4.1  Phase Ib with fenretinide in Adult CF Patients 
 
Laurent Pharmaceuticals in collaboration with The Research Institute of the  McGill University Health Centre 
recently completed a Phase Ib, First-In-CF-Patients study 3. It was a single-site, double-blind, placebo-
controlled escalating multiple oral dose study of fenretinide (LAU-7b formulation) in adult CF patients. It 
involved 15 patients randomized 3:1 (active:placebo) who received each dose level in a sequential fashion,  
for cycles of 21 days spaced by drug-free periods of a minimum of 7 days. The study drug or mat ching 
placebo was to be taken once a day, orally, along with the morning meal in addit ion to current Standard of 
Care therapies. Three (3) ascending dose levels of fenretinide as LAU-7b were a dministered (100mg, 200mg 
and 300mg/day). The rationale behind the dose selection was to achieve, on avera ge, a mean plasma 
concentration at steady state (Css) between 1-2 µM. This target was bas ed on pre-clinical evidences in the 
mouse model. 
All tests relating to safety, PK and PD were performed at screening to obt ain baseline values and then 
repeated at the end of each treatment cycle. The end of each treatment c ycle was scheduled 21 days (± 2 
days) from the first day of treatment. In total, these tests were performed four ti mes throughout the study 
period. The tests included safety laboratory tests, PD laboratory tests, lung func tion tests and physical 
examination. For patients enrolled in the PK portion of the study (first 12 patient s enrolled), the blood 
samples for safety and efficacy were obtained prior to taking the drug dose for that da y, and on Day 21 this 
meant approximately 24 hours after their previous dose. The main objectives of the study were: 
 
Primary objective  
• To establish the safety and tolerability of fenretinide in adult CF patients , using a novel oral formulation 
designed to optimize fenretinide bioavailability.

• To determine the recommended doses of fenretinide to be used in future Phase II trials; 
• To evaluate the preliminary PD of fenretinide using the plasma AA/DHA ratio as a surrogate lipidomic 
marker; 
• To evaluate selected plasma and urine inflammatory markers and explore potenti al correlation with

The key inclusion/exclusion criteria were as follows: 
Inclusions:  Men and women 18 years and older, having a diagnosis of CF, Chronic CF lung disease wit h 
baseline FEV1 equal or superior to 40% predicted, stable at time of enrollment, Chronic pulmonary 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa  colonization and/or infection. 
Exclusions:  Pregnant or breastfeeding women, inadequate contraception, presence of nyctalopia, other 
serious ophthalmological condition, serious dermatological conditions at enrolment, c linically abnormal liver 
or renal functions, history of gastrointestinal surgery or underlying gastrointestinal disorders  of motility, and 
unstable intake of retinoids or lipid supplements. 
 
Results and conclusions of the study 
 
SAFETY RESULTS: 
Overall, fenretinide was shown to be safe at all three doses studied for 21 days. The vast majority of adverse 
events (AEs) reported were mild, reversible with no sequelae, and without any ac tion needed. Interestingly, 
the number of AEs in the active group decreased with the increase in fenretini de dosing. Many of these events 
were expected within the CF population studied, such as pulmonary exacerbations, characteristic of CF 
evolution, as well as reversible nyctalopia and dry skin which have been reported for fenretinide in other 
patient populations. 
A particular attention was given to symptoms of nyctalopia. Fenretinide was  shown to form reversible 
complexes with the circulating RBP, thus reducing the serum concentrations of reti nol, an effect that may be 
associated with delayed dark adaptation in some patients. This is a we ll-documented and generally mild AE 
of fenretinide, as shown in previous clinical trials 52, 54, 69, 70. Moreover, it was shown to be fully reversible 
with treatment cessation and to be easily controlled by vitamin A supple mentation and drug-free periods 
built within treatment regimens for chronic use.  
However, because CF patients are known to be prone to vitamin A deficiency, the ir retinol levels and 
occurrence of ophthalmological AEs were closely monitored during the Phase Ib. The frequent probing of 
the patients about vision abnormalities resulted in a few referrals to the ophthalmologist but none of these 
reports resulted in objective measurements of nyctalopia or ophthalmologic abnormal ities upon detailed 
examination. Also , the final ophthalmological examination did not reveal any abnormality or signs of retinal 
damage in these patients. 
Biochemical and hematological safety parameters were not affected by fenreti nide at all  dose levels. The 
reduction of serum retinol levels as compared to baseline appeared to be smal ler in CF patients than those 
reported in other patient populations. Two (2) SAEs occurred during this study, both class ified as unrelated 
to fenretinide with one related to CF disease (exacerbation with hospitaliz ation) and easily explained by the 
condition of the patient, and one related to a concomitant disease (varicella case).

Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  32 of 94  Pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) were reported as an AE, but also have a particular significance. PEx are part 
of the natural evolution of CF, and were defined as pulmonary symptoms clinically si gnificant enough to 
justify a change in the patient’s medications (to another oral or IV antibioti c±systemic corticosteroids). It has 
to be noted that sometimes PEx symptoms are difficult to differentiate from asthma, therefore they are all 
reported as exacerbations.  PEx could also represent an exploratory efficacy endpoint, since a reduction of 
their intensity and/or incidence could indicate a good therapeutic response to an investigational drug. 
However, adult CF patients usually develop 1-3 PEx per year, which makes unrealis tic any safety/efficacy 
evaluation of a drug effect on this endpoint if the study duration is too short, or the s ample size too small 71, 
72. In some patients, the changes in symptoms were more suggestive of predominantly underlying asthma 
exacerbations and at times a combined asthma and CF PEx in which case it was labelled as a CF PEx. Since 
this was a Principal Investigator’s driven decision, severity of PEx was refl ected by the prescribed therapy: 
IV antibiotics therapy (more severe cases), or PO antibiotics therapy (mild-moderate cases).  
A total of 7 patients reported at least one episode of pulmonary exacerbation (PE x) during the study. All 
these subjects were in the fenretinide group. 	The fact that no PEx occurred in the placebo group was 
considered to be related to the small number of patients in this group (4/3/4) rathe r than related to a drug 
effect, such conclusion being supported by the following rationale: 
- The incidence of PEx per cycle, in the PEx-affected patients, decreased whe n the fenretinide dose was 
increased: from 6/15 patients with the100 mg dose, to 5/15 patients with the 200 m g dose, and to 2/14 
patients with the 300 mg dose. 		
- All PEx episodes were reported after a minimum of 21 days of treatment. There were long drug-free 
periods between treatment cycles (average of 57 days between Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, and 27 days between 
Cycle 2 and Cycle 3), precluding the consideration that the treatment was continuous  from a cycle to 
another. This discontinuity was confirmed by the absence of any pharmacokinetic carry -over between 
cycles. 
- The overall incidence of patients with PEx for the whole Phase Ib study duration was 7/15 patients 
(46%), which is less than the incidence for the same cohort in the 6 months prior t o the trial (11/15 
patients or 73%) 70. In terms of numbers of episodes, this longitudinal evaluation also shows a reduced 
frequency (14 episodes) during the 6-month Phase Ib study, as compared with the 6-month pre -study 
interval (16 documented episodes), and less than half when compared with one-year pre-st udy interval 
(36 documented episodes). 	 
- Only two (2) patients were on placebo for all three cycles, the other three havi ng switched treatments 
between cycles without reporting any PEx. 
In conclusion, the safety and tolerability of fenretinide in adult CF patients wa s comparable with the reported 
safety profile associated with the use of this drug in other patient populations  over similar or longer periods 
of treatment, and with comparable systemic exposure levels. The study Safet y Review Committee has 
acknowledged the safety of the drug in this patient population and has recommended 300mg QD as the dose 
to be tested in Phase II trial 3. 
 
PHARMACOKINETIC RESULTS: 
Following single and multiple doses of fenretinide as LAU-7b, plasma exposure (C max and AUC) increased 
with dose, and this increase was judged dose proportional (p-value > 0.05). The plasma concentration profile 
indicated first-order elimination kinetics. The concentration at 8 hours (C 8h and C ss8h, following the first and 
last doses, respectively) reached the fenretinide plasma concentration targe t range of 1–2 μM at the 200 mg 
dose level with mean values of 1.32 μM and 1.85 μM following single and multiple doses of fenretinide, 
respectively (C avg: 1.40 µM at steady- state) . Not all patients had a C 8h reaching the lower value of the target

of 1.81 μM) and C ss8h was slightly above the target range on Day 21 (mean of 2.70 μM, and C avg: 2.06 µM). 
Generally, inter-patient variability was modest for the fenretinide PK parameters, even with the small sample 
size. After a single dose, the mean t 1/2 was consistent across the dose range studied with values ranging from 
6.99 h to 7.50 h. Mean t 1/2 values at PK steady-state ranged from 8.25 h to 16.65 h. Taking into consideration 
the expected higher bioavailability of LAU-7b based on modeling from pre-clinical pharma cokinetic study, 
exposure and disposition kinetics in adult CF patients are comparable to what was observed in non-CF adults, 
themselves comparable to non-CF pediatric populations. 
 
EFFICACY RESULTS: 
In this study, we showed an association between a fenretinide dose-related inc rease in the DHA levels, a 
decrease in the AA/DHA ratio in plasma phospholipids and a decrease in the markers of oxidative stress that 
may be indicative of a reduced peroxidation and better protection of DHA, especial ly during episodes of 
increased inflammation such as pulmonary exacerbations. The improvement of the CF-a ssociated AA/DHA 
imbalance, as well as a decreased oxidative stress in a majority of patients, appears to produce a shift towards 
an anti-inflammatory pattern, particularly at the highest dose. While the change s were not significant 
statistically, the expected rise in certain inflammatory markers during P Ex seemed blunted in participants 
while on LAU-7b, and the rise in IL-8 during the course of the study was numerically less when on LAU-
7b.  
This improvement in inflammatory markers is presumed to be caused by treatment  with fenretinide which 
resulted in a dose-dependent normalization of the plasma AA, DHA and AA/DHA  ratio at the onset of PEx. 
The effect on AA and DHA was  superior to what was measured at onset and during the treatment of PEx 
with antibiotics in the previous, non-interventional, cohort characterization study conducted in the same type 
of CF patient cohort of the same clinical site in Montreal 70. At the highest dose (300mg), the improvement 
of the anti-inflammatory profile at onset of PEx in the Phase 1b study was compara ble (IL-6 and neutrophils) 
or better (IL-8 and IL-10) than at the end of the PEx treatment in the cohort charact erization study. A better 
systemic anti-inflammatory profile at onset of PEx was shown to correlate wi th increased odds to better 
respond to antibiotics for PEx 73, 70. It is hypothesized that the cumulated benefits of fenretinide, both during 
and outside the PEx episodes, will translate into clinical benefits suc h as pulmonary function preservation, 
reduced incidence and severity of PEx episodes, and ultimately a better Quality of Life for CF patients . 
In conclusion, the Phase Ib study attained its objectives of demonstrating safet y of fenretinide in CF patients, 
enhanced systemic exposure comparable to non-CF population after taking into considerat ion the higher 
bioavailability of fenretinide afforded by LAU-7b and observing a convergence of dose-related 
pharmacodynamic effects of fenretinide on markers of lipid imbalance, oxidative stre ss and inflammation. 
Moreover, the highest dosing regimen tested (300 mg/day for 21 consecutive days) was recom mended as an 
optimal dose for future Phase II trials, since it was deemed safe and achi eved the 1-2 µM fenretinide target 
plasma C ss8h in all patients treated, as well as the C avg. 
5.4.4.2  Supportive clinical experience with fenretinide 
Fenretinide has been extensively studied in humans, mostly for the prevention and tre atment of cancer. There 
is a large body of safety data existing for fenretinide from previous low-dose/long-term clini cal studies (1-
2μM plasma concentration) and mid/high-dose clinical studies (2-14.5μM plasma c oncentrations) 	using oral 
administration of fenretinide, as well as very high doses (up to 28 μM plasma c oncentration) with IV 
administration. These Phase I to Phase III studies have been carried out in more than 3,000 subjects, including 
both adults and pediatric patient populations, some for as long as 5 years of treatme nt (with the low doses). 
Most recent clinical studies have been carried out by the US National Ca ncer Institute (NCI) using the 
original corn-oil based softgels formulation. In total, NCI conducted 19 clinical studi es: 5 low-dose (2x Phase 
Confidential and Proprietary  
Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  34 of 94  II and 3x Phase III) and 14 high-dose (4x Phase I, 1x Phase I/II and 9x Phase II) . A decision in 2013 was 
taken to stop the development of the drug and request withdrawal of their IND beca use the development of 
the original oral (corn-oil based) softgel formulation has been discontinued. 
Fenretinide was originally explored in adult patients primarily as a chemopre ventive agent, and in that setting 
it was used at low doses to avoid side effects. Numerous clinical studi es employing chronic oral doses of 200 
to 800 mg fenretinide/day (≤ 3 μM plasma levels) using the corn-oil based formulat ion, have been well 
tolerated in previous trials, with the 200 mg/day dose tolerated for as long as fi ve years in the case of 
chemoprevention trials 69, 74, 75, 76, 77. Most of these studies utilized a once daily administration, some with a 
3-day drug-free rest period every 4 weeks to prevent potential symptoms of nyctalopia.  
 
Low-dose / long-term clinical trials 
Toxicity of oral chronic doses achieving 1-2 μM plasma levels of fenretinide in chemoprevention clinical 
trials has been minimal 69, 74, 78.  
Fenretinide has been safely administered in chemoprevention trials up to dose of 300 mg per day (1-1.5 μM 
plasma levels) for prolonged periods of time from 6 months to 5 years in large cancer populations with no 
significant toxicity 69, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81,. Mild grade of nyctalopia and dermatologic disorders (dry skin, pruritus) 
were the most common side-effects of fenretinide treatment; rate of occurrence  of both types of events tended 
to decrease with time or to recover spontaneously during the treatment period or short ly after cessation of 
dosing. Fenretinide plasma concentration (12 h post dose) at steady state was e stimated to be ~1µM at 200mg 
dose and ~1.5µM at 300 mg dose. Adverse effects typical of other retinoids, such as de creased bone density, 
ligament calcification, and skeletal hyperostosis were not observed in these  studies. Even after five years of 
therapy, abnormalities in night vision improved significantly after 7 days off therapy, and completely 
resolved one month after stopping fenretinide; plasma retinol concentrations returned t o normal in one month 
following discontinuation of fenretinide 80, 81.  
Single and repeat daily dose PK studies with fenretinide softgel formulation i n healthy subjects and patient 
population indicate that fenretinide plasma exposure (C max, AUC) also increased upon repeat daily dosing to 
reach a steady state level at 4-5 days 82, 74, 83. Presence of food increased significantly the plasma levels of 
the drug and has been used since as standard recommendation for fenretinide dosing74. The increase in 
exposure was dose proportional up to 800mg. Plasma exposure on Day 21 with 300mg/day dose of LA U-7b 
formulation in adult CF patients was approximately equivalent to the exposure at  the dose of 800mg on Day 
28 in healthy adults with the softgel formulation, indicating an increase in fenre tinide bioavailability by a 
factor of >2 with LAU-7b. 
 
High-dose clinical trials 
Phase I trials of high-dose (up to 14.5 μM plasma levels) oral fenretinide in pedi atric solid tumors have been 
conducted with the corn-oil softgel formulation 76, 79, 84.  
In two Phase I studies in children with neuroblastoma, fenretinide was given up t o the dose of 4000 
mg/m2/day over 28 days (3-6 patients/dose level), followed by a 7-day interruption, for a period of 6 -25 
courses 	without dose-limiting (DLT) toxicity 76, 84. Fenretinide pharmacokinetics was linear in the dose range 
100–1,700 mg/m2. Steady state peak plasma concentrations between 1.3 µM at 100mg/m2 and 14.5 µM at 
4000mg/m2 were observed in the first course of treatment on Day 28.  Similar to what ha s been observed in 
adult patients, cutaneous toxicity (dry skin and lips) and nyctalopia (Grade 1-2) were  the most common 
adverse effects observed at most dose levels which rapidly reversed during the 7-da y drug-free intervals and 
did not appear to be dose related. Grade 2 toxicities included skin xerosis (6 ca ses), hepatic toxicity (1 case),

with the 1000mg/m2 dose. None of the patients discontinued the drug because of toxicity. The maximum 
tolerated dose was not reached in these studies; 	however, they were terminated due to difficulties with patient 
compliance in consuming the required number of corn-oil based softgel capsules. 
In a study in 54 children (2-20 years old) with high-risk solid tumors 	conducted by the Children's Cancer 
Group “CCG”, a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral fenretinide, divided BID - TID, given for 7 days, 
every 3 weeks, was defined as 2475 mg/m2/day, which achieved fenretinide peak plasma levels of 9.9 ± 5 
μM with minimal systemic toxicity 79. Increased steady-state fenretinide levels were seen by Day 7 of 
therapy. Plasma retinol levels were decreased on Day 1 at all levels, and further decreased to an average of 
33% of baseline by Day 7, with recovery to 55-106% of baseline by Day 21 (start of next course).  
In all these high-dose pediatric studies, a wide range of peak plasma concentrations  were observed at a given 
dose. It is possible that the differences of tolerability observed in these tw o studies (MTD achieved vs. no 
DLT observed) was dose-schedule dependent (i.e., TID vs. QD).  
5.4.4.3  Conclusion 
The results from both adult (Phases I-III) and pediatric Phase I trials of high-dose oral fenretinide suggest 
that peak plasma levels exceeding 10 μM can be achieved with tolerable toxicity.  
Prolonged periods of fenretinide treatment (up to 5 years) in the cancer prevention studie s were associated 
with fenretinide steady-state peak plasma concentrations of 1-2 µM at dai ly doses of 200 to 400mg and no 
significant toxicity/safety concerns. In the cancer treatment studies in chi ldren the peak plasma 
concentrations reached 14.5 µM with relatively mild adverse effects. In general , no significant toxicity was 
observed in children with peak plasma levels below 3µM. The incidence and s everity of the most commonly 
observed toxicities related to fenretinide treatment such as nyctalopia, hea dache, dry eye, cutaneous, ungual, 
or mucosal toxicities observed in patients with 3–10 µM peak levels increa sed at peak levels >10µM. The 
adverse events were resolved after dose reduction or after discontinuation of the tre atment. Maximum 
tolerated dose was not reached in children with neuroblastoma at daily doses of 4000mg/m2 and fenretinide 
plasma peak levels of 14.5 µM.  
Fenretinide is reducing plasma retinol levels and retinol binding protein potential ly leading to development 
of symptoms of nyctalopia in some patients. This effect was rarely dose limi ting, and quickly reversible 
following dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment. Moreover, this effect does not s eem to be 
proportional to the dose. In previous fenretinide clinical studies a drug free period of 3-7 da ys following a 
28-day oral exposure was proven to help prevent or alleviate nyctalopia and was integra ted in all clinical 
studies. 
Based on the Phase Ib study data in adult CF patients, the dose of 300mg/day (equiva lent to 800mg/day of 
corn-oil formulation of fenretinide) resulted in steady state 8-hour plasma concentration of fenretinide on 
Day 21 of 2.7µM and average drug plasma concentration of 2.06 µM, at the upper range of “low  doses”. 
There were no serious adverse events related to fenretinide recorded in the st udy, and the overall number of 
adverse events tend ed to decrease with the increase of the dose. The incidence of nyctalopia s ymptoms 
reported in this study is consistent with the incidence of symptoms of diminis hed dark adaptation reported 
in other clinical trials with fenretinide.  Ad-hoc and scheduled ophthalmological examinations did not reveal 
any abnormality or signs of retinal damage in these patients. The reduction of se rum retinol levels, as 
compared to baseline, appears to be smaller in CF patients than other patie nt populations for which lower 
doses of fenretinide were used. This might be explained by the fact that current practices of vitamin A 
supplementation in CF patients may protect these patients from fenretinide-induced retinol decrea ses.

21 days of fenretinide dosing followed by a 7-days drug-free periods. 
 
5.4.5 Specific Rationales for this Phase II study 
5.4.5.1  Design/Structure 
This is a randomized, double-blind (patients, Investigators and blinded study staff), plac ebo controlled, Phase 
II study (details are presented in Section 7.2). There will be no active control treatment but patients will 
undergo the Standard of Care at their institution. A randomized, double-blind study design wil l avoid 
observer bias and reduce symptoms or outcomes arising from the patients' knowledge of treatment. A parallel 
design will better detect treatment effects and is appropriate for this phase of development. 
A Phase Ib study with fenretinide was conducted recently in adult CF patient s. The safety results show that 
LAU -7b is well tolerated over 3 x 21-days cycles of progressively increasing oral doses up to 300 mg/day. 
The anticipated duration of treatment in the Phase II study is 6 cycles of 21 days, totalling around 24 weeks. 
Compared to the Phase Ib study, this duration of treatment will permit all safety and efficacy variables to be 
measured for an additional 3 months to obtain a more robust assessment that is  less affected by short-term 
variability and influence of PEx.  
The 24-weeks duration is anticipated to facilitate detection of significant  changes in the primary efficacy 
endpoint FEV 1, and to also help determine the impact of fenretinide on secondary efficacy varia bles such as 
the PEx-related variables, weight and BMI, bone density, systemic bone formation/res orption markers as 
well as the Quality of Life assessments. While it is anticipat ed that the effect on the lipidomic and 
inflammation biomarkers endpoints will appear rapidly after the start of treatm ent, a 24- weeks duration will 
allow for an assessment of the durability of response for all parameters. The fol low-up period of 
approximately one month after the last dose is deemed adequate for assessing safety, biomarkers and 
efficacy, because fenretinide and its metabolites are expected to reach unde tectable levels within 7-10 days 
after the last dose. Thus, the follow-up period will be mostly on a drug free background. T his period will 
also enable assessment of whether some effects on pharmacodynamic markers l ast longer than the drug 
systemic presence. The study also aims at gathering efficacy and additional  safety information about LAU-
7b in CF patients. 
5.4.5.2  Selected Dose and Regimen 
 
In the previous Phase Ib study, three doses of LAU-7b were investigated and all show ed good tolerability. 
Doses for that study were chosen based on the enhanced bioavailability that LA U-7b capsule formulation 
conferred to fenretinide, the active product ingredient, and the target concentration range derived from pre-
clinical pharmacology experiments conducted in mouse models. In essence, the Pha se Ib was a 
concentration-driven study, while aiming at finding a maximum tolerated dose. On t he exposure standpoint, 
the Phase Ib dose of 300 mg (highest dose) achieved or slightly surpassed the circula ting level (Css8h) 
objective set a priori, in all patients and as of Day 1, which was not the  case for certain patients receiving the 
200 mg/day dose. There was no evidence of saturation of exposure with 300 mg when compa red to the two 
lower doses. From the efficacy standpoint, the improvement of the CF-associated A A/DHA imbalance, as 
well as a  decreased oxidative stress in a majority of patients, appeared to produce a s hift towards an anti-
inflammatory pattern, particularly at the highest dose of 300 mg. Therefore, this st udy will aim at testing a 
daily dose of 300 mg of fenretinide as LAU-7b, using a similar  approach as in the Phase Ib, which consisted

Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  37 of 94  of dosing cycles of 21 days on study drug treatment spaced by drug-free periods averaging 57 days between 
Cycles 1 and 2 and 27 days between Cycles 2 and 3.  
In this Phase II study of 6 cycles of 21 days, the intermittent dosing scheme wi ll also be employed but the 
drug-free periods will have a set duration of 7 days. The drug-free periods aim to prevent as much as possible 
any risks of clinically significant nyctalopia. Symptomatic reversible nyctalopia i s an expected and well-
documented adverse effect of fenretinide, due to its affinity for RBP resulting in decre ased plasma retinol 
levels. The drug-free periods, allowing for restoration of retinol levels, have been in use in oncology-related 
fenretinide development and have resulted in low incidence/severity (CTC Grade 1 i n most cases) of 
nyctalopia, even for long periods of administration, as described in Section 5.4.4.2. Likew ise, in the Phase 
Ib in adult CF patients, reported nyctalopia was not confirmed by objective ophthalmologi cal examination, 
despite frequent symptom probing with specific questionnaires. Post-study full ophthalmol ogical 
examination did not reveal any significant changes from the baseline examinati on 3. The 7-days drug-free 
periods are not expected to influence the treatment continuity, as the PK eva luation in CF patients showed a 
slight degree of fenretinide plasma accumulation after 21 days of continued administration. 	
This study is intended to be a definitive Proof-of-Concept and therefore it is appropriat e to assess the potential 
of fenretinide at the highest dose tested in the previous Phase Ib, considering i ts good tolerability. This dose 
also gives assurance that the target therapeutic systemic concentrations  will be reached in all patients while 
remaining in a concentration range associated with a very good safety profile in non -CF patient populations. 
Assuming positive outcome for this study, it is intended to thoroughly assess the minimally effective dose 
during Phase III confirmatory studies, through an adaptive approach. 
 
5.4.5.3  Rationale for Study Assessments 
The safety and PK assessments are standard parameters for clinical st udies in drug development. The efficacy 
assessments are widely accepted and generally recognized as reliable, a ccurate, and relevant to the study of 
patients with CF. 
Spirometry: Because lung disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortali ty for patients with CF, CF 
lung disease is the desired primary target of fenretinide therapy. FEV 1 as measured by spirometry is the most 
widely implemented standardized assessment to evaluate lung function in CF and the absolute change from 
baseline of FEV 1 percent predicted is the primary efficacy endpoint of this study. 
PEx-related measures : These assessments (time to first protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbation, incide nce 
of protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbation, time to first antibiotic use, number of antibiot ic treatments over 
the study treatment period, number of days of antibiotic treatment) are outcomes used to assess efficacy in 
therapies targeting improvement in CF disease. CF PEx are a compilation of pa tient signs and symptoms that 
often result in the need for aggressive treatment, including the use of IV antibi otics that may require 
hospitalization. To date, there is no generally accepted objective definition of a PEx. Despite the lack of a 
standard definition, reduction in pulmonary exacerbation rate has served as a key cli nical efficacy measure 
in definitive CF clinical studies, supporting the registration of 2 chronic CF pulmona ry therapies (inhaled 
recombinant human DNase and inhaled tobramycin). To evaluate the potential effec t of fenretinide on the 
PEx, the variables enumerated above will be derived, with distinction betwee n oral and IV antibiotic 
treatments for PEx. For data analysis purpose, this protocol utilizes a definit ion of pulmonary exacerbation, 
which is based on the definition of Fuch, presented in Section 9.3.1. 
Weight and BMI: Malnutrition is common in patients with CF because of incre ased energy expenditures due 
to lung disease and fat malabsorption. Given that fenretinide is a systemic  therapy, it has the potential to 
improve extra-pulmonary manifestations of CF, including those in the gastrointestinal system. Improved 
nutritional status, defined as an increase in weight and/or BMI, is considered a n appropriate endpoint for

on growth/health, depicted by change in weight and BMI, will be determined. 
Bone density and systemic bone formation/resorption markers: Early onset osteoporosis i s becoming more 
prevalent in the CF population as the median survival increases. The effect of new drugs on bone homeostasis 
should be evaluated as a safety measure in patients with CF, many who are treated with corticosteroids. 
Furthermore, since it was shown that fenretinide eloquently increased bone volume and density in the 
knockout mice model of CF, it is appropriate to explore in this study if this protec tive effect can be 
reproduced in CF patients. For this purpose, all patients will be sampled before and after the study treatment 
for systemic bone formation/resorption markers, and a subset of 24 patients at sele ct sites with the capability 
for doing bone densitometry according to specific criteria, will contribute pre- and post -study bone density 
data. The selected systemic bone formation/resorption markers are serum osteoc alcin, serum C-telopeptide 
(CTx) and serum P1NP. Bone density will be assessed on the lumbar spine as it  is the most appropriate site 
for monitoring the effect of a treatment for osteoporosis 85. 
Lipidomic, inflammation and metabolipidomic biomarkers : There is ample demonstration that key lipid 
imbalance is linked to CF and it was demonstrated in non-clinical pharmac ology studies at McGill that 
fenretinide corrects the AA and DHA imbalance in a specific animal m odel of CF (Sections 5.4.1 and 
5.4.2.1). Supported by the findings of the recent Phase Ib study, it is planned that lipidomic s (AA, DHA) and 
in a more exploratory manner, metabolipidomics (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), se lective eicosanoids, 
docosanoids and ceramides, etc) will be assessed serially in this study. As a drug with a potential to modulate 
pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving inflammation cascades, the effect of fenretinide on a  series of 
inflammation markers will be measured serially in this study, building on the know ledge from the Phase Ib 
study 3 and others working in the field 73. 
CFQ-R and Matouk Disease Score: The CFQ-R is a validated CF-specific inst rument that measures the 
health-related quality of life of patients with CF. The instrument measure s quality-of-life domains including 
respiratory symptoms, digestive symptoms, emotion, and health perception. Furthermore, the  CFQ-R has 
been evaluated in clinical studies involving therapies for CF lung disease. Li nguistically validated versions 
of the CFQ-R are available, thereby allowing consistent interpretation of the res ults in this international 
study. As an exploratory outcome, the Matouk Disease Score will be assesse d for its potential to complement 
more established parameters such as FEV 1. Given the lack of recognized biomarkers for CF inflammation 
clinical studies, and the long time required for FEV 1 to show changes, we believe that exploring additional 
alternatives, such as this scoring system, will be welcomed by the CF community. 
Markers of oxidative stress : CF disease is characterized by high levels of oxidation due to the abnormal 
inflammatory response, chronic bacterial infections and the reduced anti-oxidant mec hanisms86, 87. 
Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as AA and DHA, are particularly s usceptible to oxidation due to 
their molecular structure with few double bonds between carbons. Malondialdehyde (MDA ), a marker of 
lipid peroxidation, was found to be abnormally high in CF patients 88. Nitrotyrosine (NT3) is a marker of 
protein oxidation. The levels of NT3 were also found to be high in CF patients 89, 90. MDA and NT3 plasma 
levels will be measured in order to explore the oxidation of lipids and proteins. We have previously seen 
correlations between MDA levels and DHA whereby lower levels of the oxidat ion marker were observed in 
conjunction with higher DHA levels 3. Thus, in this study, it will be explored whether fenretinide would 
reduce these oxidative stress markers in patients following fenretinide treatment.

Primary objectives:   
1- To assess the safety and tolerability of LAU-7b in CF patients by the inci dence of treatment emergent 
adverse events as compared to placebo; and  
2- To assess the efficacy of LAU-7b as depicted by the absolute change from Base line in FEV 1 percent 
predicted, relative to placebo-treated patients. 
 
Secondary objectives:   
1- To assess the normalizing effect of LAU-7b on the key lipidomic markers in pla sma phospholipids, such 
as AA, DHA and the AA/DHA ratio; 
2- To evaluate the efficacy of LAU-7b on other clinically relevant parameters, s uch as Time- to-first 
protocol-defined PEx and incidence of protocol-defined PEx, change in weight and BMI, usage of ne w 
antibiotics, and the change in CFQ-R; 
3- To evaluate the change in selected systemic inflammation markers; 
4- Determine if LAU-7b has an effect on lung colonization with PsA, as measured by CFU in sputum; 
5- To explore the pharmacodynamics of LAU-7b on select systemic metabolipidomic markers, oxidative 
stress markers, bone formation/resorption, and ceramides subclass concentration; 
6- To explore the change in plasma AA/DHA ratio, EPA, inflammation markers a nd FEV 1 between the start 
and the end of IV antibiotic treatment for PEx (performed o nly in patients who receive IV antibiotics for 
what their treating physician considers a PEx );  
7- To explore clinical scoring using the Matouk Disease Scoreii. 
 
Rationale for the selection of objectives: 
 
This is a Phase II study that aims at gathering efficacy data as wel l as expanding and confirming the safety 
and pharmacodynamic information obtained during the Phase Ib study in adult CF patients.  
In that latter study 3, LAU-7b administered at doses up to 300 mg per day for 21 days at each dose level, on 
a background of normal standard of care showed good tolerability and no treatment-emergent l aboratory 
abnormalities. The pharmacokinetic profile of LAU-7b fully achieved the targeted bl ood levels and dose 
selection rationale. The treatment also normalized the lipid imbalance  and decreased oxidative stress in a 
vast majority of patients, causing a shift towards an anti-inflammatory patte rn particularly at the highest dose 
tested, and potential association with stability of some clinical para meters. The most promising effects were 
observed after dividing the patients into those that did not experience episodes of PEx and those who did, 
the latter subgroup showing stronger positive pharmacodynamic responses. This requires furthe r 
confirmation and correlation of the findings with clinically relevant outcomes. H owever, the sample size was 
small and for most of these measures, variability prevented reaching statist ical significance or robust 
conclusion on efficacy. 
This proposed Phase II study design follows the regulatory guidance from the European Medic ines Agency 
(EMA), as well as recommendations for the conduct of clinical trials wit h agents addressing inflammation 
in CF, recently published by the CF Foundation Anti-inflammatory Therapy Working Group 91. 
It is hypothesized that 6-month treatment with 300 mg of LAU-7b, administered al ong with the Standard of 
Care, orally once-a-day in cycles of 21 consecutive days, spaced by 7-day drug-free interval s, will be safe 
and well tolerated by the study population. It is also hypothesized that LAU-7b treatment in CF will have

depicted by the absolute change in FEV 1% predicted, the primary efficacy endpoint of the study. The 
secondary line of efficacy assessments will include the PEx-related vari ables, the measures of systemic pro- 
and anti-inflammatory markers, as well as with the evolution of other clinica l parameters. To help establish 
the benefits to the patients, health economists and payers, the Quality- Of-Life assessments such as the CFQ-
R and measures of long-term benefit such as the PsA colonization in sputum will be assessed, compared to 
placebo, and correlated with primary and other secondary endpoints, to develop a better unde rstanding of the 
inter-relations of the study variables and their interactions with the disea se. As an exploratory outcome, the 
Matouk Disease Score will be assessed for its potential to compleme nt more established parameters such as 
FEV 1. 
The study will also evaluate the impact of LAU-7b therapy on the subset of pa tients with IV antibiotic-treated 
PEx, in the light of recent clinical evidence showing a good correlation of syste mic inflammation biomarkers 
with FEV 1 and response to antibiotics during PEx events 3, 73. The robust dataset of efficacy endpoints 
collected will allow the selection of clinically relevant endpoints for the pivotal studies, and the identification 
of parameters susceptible to become validated surrogate endpoints, assuming a good correlation is 
demonstrated.  
With pulmonary function as the primary efficacy variable, this study is aimed at  the population at risk of 
losing lung function if left on the current standard of care. Consequently, the lower lim it of inclusion for the 
baseline FEV 1 will be set at 40%, and the upper limit at 100% predicted, depicting that pat ients have a fairly 
decent pulmonary function at entry. These are values that do not represent mutually exclusive entry criteria 
with the other inclusions destined to enrich the study population in patients sus ceptible to experience a PEx 
episode during the study (see below). PEx episodes and the ensuing lack of proper resoluti on of inflammatory 
defense mechanism are responsible for the lung structure losses and associat ed non-return to pre-PEx lung 
function in a sizeable proportion of patients. The entry criteria of the study have t herefore been set to enrich 
the study population with patients more susceptible to develop a PEx episode. Ba sed on the newly discovered 
regulator effect of LAU-7b on key membrane lipids, such as the stabilization of CF TR, the more mildly 
affected CF patients may benefit as well from LAU-7b therapy.  We plan to e nroll patients with at least one 
pulmonary exacerbation in the previous 12 months that required a documented change of anti biotic, whether 
oral or IV. It is known that patients who required IV antibiotics to treat a PEx episode in the prior year have 
about a 30% chance of having an IV-treated exacerbation during a 24- week  study 92. In the case of no IV 
administered antibiotics for PEx, the odds drop by half 71.  
Since our planned inclusion criteria are aligned to enroll patients susceptibl e to lose pulmonary function 
because of their baseline FEV 1, and in light of the potential for LAU-7b to stabilize and augment the function 
of CFTR protein in the cell membrane, an effect shown to more evident with CF patients with higher 
pulmonary function, as depicted by FEV 1, the prior requirement for a minimum of one (1) IV antibiotic-
treated PEx episode in the prior 12 months, deemed to likely limit the nece ssary number of observations 
required to reach significance for the primary efficacy comparison is presumed to not  be weakened by the 
enrollment of less severely affected patients. For this study, a difference of i nterest in absolute change of 
FEV 1 over a period of 6 months is set to 4%; this target difference is similar t o what was planned and found 
to be clinically meaningful in some previous confirmatory clinical trials, suc h as those of 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination therapy 93.  In addition, considering that fenretinide reduced PsA lung 
burden compared to no treatment in the Cftr. KO mouse model, there is a distinct possibility that in the 
planned study, fenretinide also exerts an anti-infective activity, susceptible to cause a net improvement (not 
just a stabilization) of FEV 1 in CF patients, distancing itself from the FEV 1 decay expected in placebo-treated 
patients.

7 STUDY DESIGN  
7.1 Endpoints  
7.1.1 Primary Endpoints: 
• The safety and tolerability of LAU-7b will be assessed in all patients  through the performance of physical 
examinations, vital signs, ECG, safety laboratory tests, and adverse events report ing, compared to placebo 
treated patients; 
• The absolute change in FEV 1 percent predicted at the Day 161 visit (24 weeks) relative to pre-study values, 
LAU -7b compared to placebo treated patients. 
7.1.2 Justification for the Primary Endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Fenretinide is proposed as an anti-inflammatory therapy wi th the ability to 
normalize plasma AA/DHA ratio, and in pre-clinical work, reduce Pseudomonas  burden. Chronic lung 
inflammation and infection are at core of the lung destruction over time. Along wi th safety, it is therefore 
most relevant to assess the effect of correction of the lipidomic abnormalit y on FEV 1, a clinically meaningful 
outcome in CF and the most characterized index for assessing lung function in CF. If indeed fenretinide has 
positive effects on the immune-inflammatory response, on the function of CFTR and exert anti-infective 
effect against PsA, this will result in a positive absolute difference in the lung function rela tive to placebo-
treated patients, an effect that should be observed over the 6-months duration of the study. Other variables 
susceptible to be positively affected by an anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving thera py will be evaluated as 
secondary endpoints. 
Safety as a Primary Endpoint: In the proposed study, due to the longer duration of treatme nt in CF patient, 
relative to the previous Phase Ib and the increased sample size, these are relevant reasons for nominating 
safety as a co-primary endpoint, along with assessing efficacy. Similar to the  previous study, safety will be 
assessed during and after the study, taking the screening and baseline status of the patients as a reference. In 
addition, particular attention will be put on objectively investigating reported sym ptoms of nyctalopia and/or 
dermatological disorders, the latter being known class effect of retinoids (includi ng vitamin A). Fenretinide 
has a very good safety record in other indications at doses superior to the one evalua ted in this study, and 
was shown to be well tolerated in the Phase Ib study with only few adverse events deemed related to the 
study drug. Still, by administering the study drug over a longer period of time, it is nec essary to err on the 
safe side and continue to build a comprehensive safety database on fenretinide in CF.

LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  43 of 94  To be eligible for the study, patients must have a diagnosis of CF, be aged 18 ye ars and above, have 
undergone at least one IV antibiotic-treated PEx in the year prior and meet all other study inclusion and 
exclusion criteria at screening.  
Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1, after stratification for 1- base line FEV 1, 2- PEx number in prior 
year, and 3- Co-administration or not of Kalydeco®, Orkambi®, Symdeko®  or another commercially 
available CFTR modulator product, to either LAU-7b (active) group or placebo (control) group. Afte r 
randomization, patients will enter the treatment phase of the study. There w ill be no active control treatment 
but patients will undergo the CF Standard of Care at their institution. 
A minimum of 136 patients will be recruited and randomized for the treatment phase of the study in the 
expectation that at least 120 patients complete the study as per protocol. Patients will be enrolled a t 
approximately 35-40 centers in the United States of America, Canada  and Australia, possibly in Europe. The 
study treatment (LAU-7b or matching placebo) will be administered in the fed s tate with the first meal of the 
day (morning if possible) for cycles consisting of 21 days on treatment followed by a 7-day treatment-free 
period. 
Patients will be evaluated at pre-specified times during and after the s tudy treatment period, for safety, 
efficacy, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, as well as Quality of Life. Patients undergoing PEx 
during the study will also be subjected to PEx-related assessments prior t o- and after the therapeutic antibiotic 
course if the PEx severity meets the criteria for IV antibiotic treatment. 
This design is appropriate for this phase of development and will ensure that the  highest quality of data is 
collected with minimal bias and the patient’s safety and wellbeing are  preserved. A Data and Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be created for this study.

Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  44 of 94  The DSMB will be composed of: 
• Two physicians involved in the care of CF patients, experienced in clinical re search, independent of 
Laurent Pharmaceuticals and not involved as an Investigator on the study. 
• One Ophthalmologist experienced in clinical research, independent of Laurent Pharmaceuticals . 
• One study biostatistician that can be unblinded with regards to patient randomi zation, meaning that it is 
not involved in the statistical design, analysis and reporting of the study. 
• Ad-Hoc members recruited to provide specific expertise and meet the Board’s mandate. 
 
Each DSMB member will sign a Conflict of Interest Statement which incl udes current affiliations, if any, 
with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies (e.g., stockholder, consultant), and any othe r relationship 
that could be perceived as a conflict of interest related to the study and / or associated with commercial 
interests pertinent to study objectives.  
Data will be presented in a blinded manner during the open sessions of the DSM B unless noted otherwise 
below. At DSMB meetings data and discussion are confidential. Participant identities will not be known to 
the DSMB members. 
 
Mandate of the DSMB (to be defined in greater detail in the DSMB Charter): 
• Review safety information emerging from the study (and any other study of fenretinide). Parti cular 
attention will be paid to PEx incidence and due to the profile of fenretinide, oc ular and dermatological 
AEs. Moreover, the DSMB will have access to the randomization code, if justified.  
• Meet at specific times of the study to review the safety data cumula ted to date. The following specific 
times have been selected a priori: 
o When a minimum of half of the enrolled patients have completed at least one  dosing cycle and 
corresponding safety information is available, along with Day 21 plasma retinol and retinol 
binding protein concentration data. This will not be a full unblinding; it will be  an unblinded 
safety analysis of Active versus Placebo;  
o When a minimum of half of the enrolled patients have completed the first 3 dosi ng cycles and 
corresponding safety data is available for review. This will not be a full unbli nding; it will be 
an unblinded safety analysis of Active versus Placebo; 
o Outside of the above, every 6 months; 
o Anytime as needed for review of clinically significant safety information brought t o the 
attention of the DSMB. 
 
• Provide guidance to the study team with regards to safety trends. Recommendation t o implement a 
systematic dose reduction or continue the study at the planned dose level wi ll be made by the DSMB and 
reviewed by the Laurent Pharmaceutical’s Team, who will take the final decision to pursue dosing or not 
(see Sections 7.2.3, 7.2.4 and 8.4.1 for Study/Treatment Arm Stopping Rule Guideline, Treatme nt Arm 
Dose Reduction Guideline, and Individual Patient Stopping Rules, respectively).  
 
7.2.3 Study / Treatment Arm Stopping Rule Guideline 
The following should serve as a guide for the DSMB to recommend stopping the enrolment  and/or further 
drug administration in a given treatment arm. An agreement will be reached w ith the DSMB on the guideline 
prior to the study. Other considerations may be used to arrive at such decisions, which must involve Laurent 
Pharmaceuticals Executive Management.

Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  45 of 94  • Occurrence of any case of death that may be attributed to fenretinide (in such a  case, the blind will have 
to be broken and allocated treatment identified); 
• Occurrence of an increased number, relative to placebo, of unexpected SAEs that could be attributable 
to the drug (at least probable causality relationship) that raise Investigators/DSMB concerns about 
patients’ safety; 
• Increased frequency and/or severity of drug-related adverse events, relative to place bo, that in the 
judgment of the Investigators /DSMB , will result in the advice to discontinue fenretinide treatment. 
 
7.2.4 Treatment Arm Dose Reduction Guideline  
The following should serve as a guide for the DSMB to recommend the reduction of the dose in the 
fenretinide arm from 300 to 200 mg/day. An agreement will be reached with the DS MB on the guideline 
prior to the study. Other considerations may be used to arrive at such decisions, which must involve Laurent 
Pharmaceuticals Executive Management. 
• Increased frequency and/or severity of drug-related adverse events that in the judgment  of the 
Investigators /DSMB , will result in the advice to reduce the dose of fenretinide treatment. 
 
7.3 Blinding and Randomization  
Given the potential for bias in the interpretation of safety and Quality of Life  endpoints, as well as the 
potential for treatment bias that would affect PEx severity and related ant ibiotic treatment route of 
administration and duration, among other factors that could potentially bias the t rial, the APPLAUD study 
must be placebo-controlled, double-blinded, and randomized in order to obtain sufficiently robust data. 
 
7.3.1 Rationale for Placebo Control 
There is no permanent cure for CF, and the current drug therapies goals are to reduce t he symptoms of 
disease, such as preventing progression of lung infection by removal of the mucus plugging from the lungs, 
controlling the infection and inflammation, controlling the nutrition level, and ulti mately increasing survival. 
As they are achieving their goals it is therefore appropriate to assess the  safety and potential benefit of LAU-
7b added to the standard of care for CF patients. A placebo control is suitable a nd will permit to have unbiased 
assessment of the several variables. It is essential to maintain t he patients on their standard of care, assuming 
this meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria, as well as allowed vitamin suppleme nts.  
 
7.3.2 Blinding and Breaking the Blind 
This is a double-blind study. Patients, Investigators and Site Staff, sponsor and CRO personnel, and data 
managers will be kept blinded to treatment assignments until the end of the  study, except for emergency 
unblinding as described below. More specifically, to ensure the blinding is mainta ined when there are no 
safety concerns requiring unblinding, pharmacokinetic data, pharmacodynamic biomarker results , including 
post-screening plasma retinol and retinol-binding protein, will not be communicated back to blinded staff.  
Only the Clinical Trial Material manufacturer’s and Packaging/Distribution provi der’s unblinded staff and 
CRO staff administering the interactive web response system (IWRS) will be knowledgeable of individual 
treatment assignments. As well, in the case of emergency unblinding as des cribed below, some additional 
people will become aware of treatment assignment for specific patient(s).

Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  46 of 94  The study blind may be broken for an individual patient or several patients in the e vent of an emergency in 
which knowledge of the treatment assignment is needed for the safety of the pat ient(s) and/or for medical 
decision-making or as required by local regulatory authority. Unless the event for whic h the blind needs 
breaking is life threatening, the investigator should first contact the CRO’s medi cal monitor (or designee) 
prior to breaking the blind. The investigator will obtain unblinding information from the st aff administering 
the IWRS in the form of IWRS access and sealed randomization envelopes. The rea son and justification for 
breaking the blind must be fully documented in the source documentation and captured on t he patient(s) 
electronic case report form (e-CRF). Additionally, all SAE, as they are receive d but in respect of the reporting 
requirements enunciated in the DSMB charter, will be referred to the chair of the DSMB, who may request 
unblinding of the patient, and may call an ad hoc meeting of the DSMB to review the data relevant to the 
study stopping/dose reduction guidelines. 
 
7.3.3 Randomization Scheme and Stratification 
Computer-generated randomization sequences will be programmed into the IWRS. At the  time of 
Randomization during Visit 2, not before, the IWRS will assign a randomization number to each patient.   
 
Randomization will be stratified by  
1- FEV 1 severity collected at the Screening Period (<70% versus ≥70% predicted);  
2- Number of PEx (all PEx episodes, whether treated by oral or IV antibiotics): ≤ 3 versus > 3 PEx episodes 
in prior year; and 
3- Co-administration or not of Kalydeco® (ivacaftor), Orkambi® (ivacaftor/lumacaftor),  Symdeko® 
(ivacaftor/tezacaftor ) or another commercially available CFTR modulator product. 
 
Once stratified, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 double-blinded fashion to e ither LAU-7b (active) group 
or the placebo (control) group. Stratification will enable an even distribution of seve rity and key baseline 
characteristics among the two treatment groups. 
 
Detailed instructions for randomization will be provided separately.

8.1 Screening Inclusion Criteria  
Patients may be enrolled in and randomized to the study only if they meet all of the following criteria at  
screening: 
1. Signed Informed Consent; 
2. Adult men and women (as per State or Province laws) and  18 years and older;  
3. Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (positive sweat chloride test) or confirmation (ca n be historical) of two 
genetic mutations (one mutation on each of the two alleles of the CFTR gene) causing CF; 
4. Screening FEV 1 between 40% and 100% predicted value for age, gender and height, in patients capable 
of properly performing the test, and baseline FEV 1 within 15% of the screening value, indicative of stable 
pulmonary function at entry; 
5. History of pulmonary exacerbation, defined as at least one (1) pulmonary exacerbation in the 12 months 
prior to Screening which resulted in documented IV or oral antibiotic treatment; 
6. Clinically stable patients, i.e. patients that had no change in their sta ndard antibiotic medication within 5 
weeks prior to randomization, of which 2 weeks minimum are prior to Screening; 
7. Patients are eligible independently of their history of pulmonary PsA infection and their PsA status at 
screening. Medical charts will be reviewed for the PsA history in the 12 months prior to screening; 
8. If taking Kalydeco® (ivacaftor), Orkambi® (ivacaftor/lumacaftor), Symdeko® (ivacaftor/t ezacaftor ) or 
another commercially available CFTR modulator product, patients must be taking i t for a minimum of 3 
months prior to screening if naïve to CFTR modulators and 1 month if switched from anot her CFTR 
modulator product, and deemed to tolerate it; 
9. All patients, whether prescribed pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy or not, are eligible. However, 
modifications of the dosing regime during the study should be avoided;  
10. No change in CF and allowed systemic chronic therapy for a minimum of 5 weeks pri or to randomization, 
of which 2 weeks minimum are  prior to screening. Changes in non-CF therapy may be allowed during 
this period, on a case-by-case basis, after consultation with Laurent Pharmace uticals. Allowed 
concomitant diseases and treatment are listed in specific section; 
11. Female patients of child bearing potential should be on a highly effective contra ceptive method during 
the study, such as hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine device or tubal ligation.  Women of childbearing 
potential are defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who is N OT permanently sterile 
or postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined as 12 consecutive months with no mens es without an 
alternative medical cause. In addition, since the potential of fenretinide to reduce the effectiveness of or al 
contraceptives has not been established, such patients will be required to us e a second contraceptive 
method such as a barrier method. The contraceptive methods will all be conti nued for a minimum of a 
month after the last dose of study treatment. Periodical abstinence, cale ndar based methods and 
withdrawal are not considered effective methods of contraception; 
12. Male patients with spouse or partner of child bearing potential, or pregnant, are el igible if they use an 
appropriate method of contraception, such as condoms and spermicide, and if their non-pregnant spouse 
or partner use an appropriate method of contraception such as oral contraceptives or int rauterine device. 
The contraceptive methods will all be continued for a minimum of a month afte r the last dose of study 
treatment.  Male patients with documented sterilization are allowed to waive the contraceptive  methods; 
13. Patients deemed capable of adequate compliance including attending scheduled visits for the duration of 
the study; 
14. The patient must be able to swallow the study drug capsules.

10. Presence of a cancerous tumor, active or in remission, treated or not, except squa mous or basal cell 
carcinomas of the skin that have been treated and deemed resolved; 
11. Presence of nyctalopia (also called night-blindness, which is the inability t o see well at night or in poor 
light) or hemeralopia (the inability to see in bright light) at enrolment, or any other serious retinal, 
ophthalmological condition (eg: retinitis pigmentosa, choroidoretinitis, xerophtalmia,  uncontrolled 
glaucoma); 
12. Presence of serious dermatological conditions at entry, including inflammatory or xerot ic pathologies 
such as psoriasis or ichthyosis; 
13. Intake of chronic systemic steroids in the month prior to screening and during the study. Inhaled 
corticosteroids for treating asthma/rhinitis are allowed as well as sys temic corticosteroids ( £5 mg/day of 
prednisone or equivalent  or a higher loading dose tapered down in subsequent days) administered 
temporarily to control asthma exacerbations or pulmonary infections associated wi th bronchospasm 
(topical corticosteroids for dermatologic conditions may be allowed, subject to Inve stigator and 
Sponsor’s representative authorization); 
14. History of acute infections (viral/bacterial/fungal) within 5 weeks prior to random ization, of which 2 
weeks minimum are prior to screening, whether or not treated and resolved. Exceptions  are topical skin 
infections under treatment/treated with a local non-prescription antibiotic; 
15. Presence of infection with Burkholderia cepacia  (including all species within the Burkholderia cepacia  
complex group, and Burkholderia gladioli ) in the 12 months prior to screening (resolution of previous 
episode confirmed by quarterly negative cultures for the 12 months prior to screening); 
16. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis (as per the CFF diagnostic criteria) of Allergic Bronchopulmonary 
Aspergillosis “ABPA” and actively being treated with corticosteroids and/or antifungals agents;

of the prior study (or a minimum of 5 elimination half-lives) prior to screening; 
18. Any other clinically significant condition that is considered by the principal i nvestigator as being 
susceptible to put the patient at greater safe ty risk, influence response to study product, or interfere with 
study assessments. 
 
8.3 Withdrawal of Patients  
Patients should be withdrawn from the study in the event of any of the following:  
1. If a patient does not continue to meet eligibility criteria at baseline , the patient will be withdrawn prior 
to randomization;  
Confidential and Proprietary  
Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  49 of 94  2. Occurrence of a SAE  deemed definitely or probably related to drug that is a life-threatening adverse 
reaction or one resulting in hospitalization; 
3. If a patient withdraws consent during the treatment period, and more specificall y consent to contribute 
additional outcome information, the patient shall be withdrawn from the study (al though it is 
recommended that the investigator attempt to perform a Treatment Discontinua tion Visit Evaluation). If 
the patient withdrawing consent to further treatment agrees to contribute additi onal outcome information, 
then the regular schedule of visits could be maintained, for safety and relevant out come measures of 
efficacy.  
4. If a patient is serially and persistently noncompliant with study procedures and/ or visit schedules, the 
investigator or the sponsor may withdraw the patient from the study 
5. A patient's treatment is unblinded by the Investigator.  
6. If a female patient or a female partner of a male patient has a confirmed pregnancy (with the exception 
of a pregnancy resulting from in-vitro  fertilization), this should be immediately reported to the Medical 
Monitor and Laurent Pharmaceuticals (within 1 working day of discovery) and the patient  shall be 
withdrawn. Pregnan cy, whether in a patient or in a partner of a patient should be followed up until 
conclusion, with an assessment of child health at birth. 
 
The reason for patient withdrawal will be noted on the e-CRF. The investigator s hould attempt to follow 
patients withdrawn after first dosing until resolution of any adverse events, or at  least 4 weeks after the last 
dose of study agent, or until completion of pregnancy. Upon withdrawal, no further dosing should be 
performed for these patients. Investigators shall make reasonable attempts to contact lost- to-follow-up 
patients for evaluation. 
 
8.4 Treatment Discontinuations  
Patients should discontinue treatment with the study treatment, but remain on the study for adequate follow-
up, for any of the following reasons:  
• Patients may discontinue study drug treatment at any time if the patient, Investigator, or Laurent 
determines that it is not in the best interest of the subject to continue treatment. 
• Unacceptable toxicity associated with treatment (see below stopping rule, section 8.4.1) 
• Clinically significant lab abnormalities or adverse events that, in the Inves tigator’s judgment, would 
preclude continued treatment.  
 
The reason for treatment discontinuation will be noted on the e-CRF.  
If a patient discontinues treatment due to unacceptable toxicity or any other s afety reason, that patient should 
either continue to be assessed according to the planned visit schedule for safe ty and for relevant efficacy 
parameters, or at the minimum, attend a Treatment Discontinuation Visit  four (4) weeks after having received 
the last dose of study drug.  
8.4.1 Individual Patient Stopping Rule 
The following should be used as a guide for the Investigator to determine if the s tudy drug administration is 
to be interrupted based on toxicity (see Section 11.1.1.3 on Study Drug Action Taken, for more detail on 
documentation): 
• A subject develops a medical condition that requires prolonged concomitant therapy with a prohibited 
medication or prolonged interruption of the study drug;

Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  50 of 94  • Occurrence of a SAE that could be attributable to the drug (at least probably causality relationship), and 
causes discontinuation of study drug for more than 3 weeks; 
• High and unexpected frequency and/or severity of “at least probably related” advers e events that in the 
judgment of the Investigator, requires withdrawal from the study. 
	 
8.5 Replacement of Patients  
Patients who are withdrawn or lost- to-follow-up prior to Baseline, or who do not meet the Baseline criteria, 
will be replaced to ensure 136 eligible patients are enrolled into the study. Patients who withdra w after 
Baseline will not be replaced. 
 
9 STUDY CONDUCT  
9.1 Timing of Assessments  
All questionnaires must be performed before any other assessment at the clinic visits with the  CFQ-R 
questionnaire performed first, followed by the Night Vision Questionnaire (NVQ) and the Patient sel f-
assessment form of the Matouk Disease Score (at selected sites only). For the remaining as sessments, the 
following assessments must be performed (if possible) in the following order when more than 1 assessme nt 
is planned at a particular time point: 
1. 12-lead ECG recordings 
2. Vital signs 
3. Pulmonary function tests (FEV 1) and Sputum Induction 
4. Safety laboratory assessments (i.e., blood draws) 
5. PK sampling 
9.2 Study Visits and Procedures  
9.2.1 Screening and Eligibility Assessments (Visit 1, Day -28 to -1): 
Within 28 Days of randomization, interested CF patients will undergo a screening session, Visit 1:  
1. Verification of identity and age; 
2. Prior to any study specific screening activities, all potential patients will sign the Study Informed Consent 
Form (ICF). The consent forms will comply with all applicable regulations governing the protection of 
human subjects. An ICF Form, approved by Laurent Pharmaceuticals and the site's institutional review 
board (IRB) or ethics committee (EC), must be used. At this point, the site as signs a “subject/patient 
number” to each patient, in order of screening. This will serve to identify the pa tient for the entire study 
participation. This is not the randomization number, which is generated by the IWRS  at Visit 2, at time 
of randomization; 
3. Confirmation of the CF diagnosis will be obtained, with proper genetic data if available; 
4. Verification of all inclusion and exclusion criteria; 
5. Obtain medical history including history of prior pulmonary infections, pulmonary exacerbations  and 
their causative pathogens, all recent and current medications and therapies, non -prescription drug intake, 
pancreatic enzyme quantities (where applicable) as well as  vitamin supplementation (types and 
quantities). Particular attention will be put on obtaining the history of presence or absence of PsA in 
throat or sputum cultures, the dates of start of oral/IV antibiotics taken to treat PEx episodes, both in the 
12 months prior to screening. This will help establishing a background exacerbation PsA and PEx pattern ; 
6. Verification of the medications against list of disallowed medications and associate d ban periods; 
Confidential and Proprietary  
Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  51 of 94  7. Body weight, height, with BMI calculated; 
8. Complete Physical examination; 
9. A 12-lead ECG; 
10. Vital signs including respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and body temperature; 
11. A pulmonary function test comprising at a minimum FEV 1, to be performed under the care of a trained 
study personnel. Three FEV 1 measurements will be collected and the best of three FEV 1 values 
(according to American Thoracic Society standards) will be recorded. Central revi ew of the expiratory 
loops will be performed to ensure accurate baseline FEV 1; 
12. Eligibility-defining laboratory tests including at a minimum, urinalysis (dipsti ck), hematology, serum 
chemistry, plasma retinol and retinol-binding protein, and pregnancy test if applicable; 
13. A Night Vision Questionnaire will be self-administered; 
14. Complete ophthalmological examination (includes examination of visual acuity, exa mination for 
amblyopia, examination of eyelids, conjunctiva, cornea, pupillary reactions to light a nd accommodation, 
low contrast visual function (Contrast Sensitivity), specific dark adaptation t ests (see note in Section 
11.5), lens, vitreous humor, fundus examination of retina and retinal vessels, fundus visualiz ation of optic 
nerve and macula), will also serve as the baseline exam; 
15. Sputum  will be induced using hypertonic saline for the assessment of the CFU for PsA. Patients with 
known intolerance to hypertonic saline will not undergo the procedure, as judged by their t reating 
physician.  A precise set of instructions will be provided and applied across sites to minimize sampling 
variations and ensure sputum sample quality; 
16. Screening may be split into more than one visit and all results must be a vailable prior to randomization 
so that the study Investigator can determine eligibility and schedule the baseline visit. 
9.2.1.1  Repeat performance of screening assessment(s) 
Repetition of individual screening assessment(s) that did not meet eligibility criteria is  not permitted with 
the following exceptions: 
• If there is clear and documented evidence of a laboratory error (e.g., hemolyzed sample) or equipment 
malfunction, collection of a repeat sample for the appropriate laboratory test or assessment may be 
permitted; 
• Due to the unstable nature of CF, any clinically significant laboratory test abnormality, but deemed 
transient by the Investigator, may be retested within the screening window. 
If repeat values of the individual assessment(s) are within the eligibility criteria and compl eted within the 
screening window, then the patient is eligible for the study. 
9.2.1.2  Rescreening  
Patients may only be rescreened with the approval of the medical monitor. If a patient is rescreened, a ll 
screening assessments will be repeated except CF genotyping (if not already in the patient’s me dical 
history), and the ophthalmologic examination (if performed within the last 3 months). If a patient is 
rescreened, the screening window will begin once the first rescreening assessment has been init iated. 
9.2.2 Baseline and First Dosing Visit (Visit 2, Day 1) 
1. Eligible CF patients will be invited to the study site for the baseline  procedures and first dosing. This 
visit must be within 28 days of screening otherwise all or a part of expired sc reening procedures will 
need to be repeated/updated (see Section 9.2.1.2); 
2. Confirmation of continued eligibility by verification of the inclusion/exclusion criteri a, review of the 
results of the screening safety laboratory tests including plasma retinol and re tinol-binding protein, 
performance of baseline vital signs, urine pregnancy test for women, and focused physical examination;

Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  52 of 94  3. Pulmonary function tests (FEV 1). The actual baseline FEV 1 value for the study will be the average of the 
screening’s best value and the best value obtained during the baseline visit  as long as the screening and 
baseline FEV 1 values are within 15% of each other. A higher difference in FEV 1 % predicted indicates a 
lack of acceptable pulmonary function stability and the patient should not be randomized on study; 
4. Body weight, with BMI calculated; 
5. At sites that participates in the bone density exploratory assessment, the first 24 pat ients who consent to 
the additional procedure of measuring bone density prior to and after the study treatment , will undergo 
their baseline assessment; being not exclusionary, this test may be sche duled within a few days of first 
dose but not after; 
6. Baseline Quality of Life questionnaire will be filled out (CFQ-R); 
7. At select sites participating in the investigation of the Matouk Dis ease Score, the Baseline Score will be 
determined; 
8. Pre-dose blood sampling and urine collection for baseline safety laboratory tests, pregnancy test if 
applicable, plasma retinol and retinol-binding protein, lipidomic tests, ceramide s, metabolipidomic tests, 
systemic bone formation/resorption markers, inflammation and oxidative stress markers;  
9. All eligible patients will be stratified according to 1- Baseline FE V1, 2- PEx number in the prior year, 
and 3- Co-administration of Kalydeco® (ivacaftor), Orkambi Ò (ivacaftor/lumacaftor), Symdeko® 
(ivacaftor/tezacaftor ) or another commercially available CFTR modulator product, and equally 
allocated/randomized to either a daily dose of 300mg of LAU-7b, (as 3 x 100 mg oral hard gelatin 
capsules), or matching placebo. 
10. Randomized patients will receive their first dose of study treatment under supe rvision, under fed 
condition and will receive a 21-day supply of study treatment. Patients will be discharged after tolerability 
of the first dose has been observed (minimum one hour post-dose). 
9.2.3 Report of a pulmonary exacerbation (any time during the study) 
 
Patients will be instructed to adhere to the standard of care in use at the institution, that is to contact their 
treating physician and team when they feel that they are experiencing a change  in symptoms for at least 3 
days (ease of breathing, cough, quantity and nature of sputum, activity tolerance). If indic ated based on the 
initial interaction, the study team will invite the patients to the clinic to do a proper assessment and determine 
a course of action such as antibiotic treatments. Being an efficacy variabl e, particular attention will be put 
on obtaining precisely the start of any antibiotics, whether oral or IV. If an IV ant ibiotic is prescribed and 
the patient can attend the study site prior to starting the IV antibiotics  and after the planned end of antibiotics, 
this will trigger a set of pre- and post-antibiotic treatment additional blood sampling for study-related 
markers, a pulmonary function test (FEV 1), as well as measurements of weight, with BMI calculated. Details  
are presented in Section 9.3 “Pulmonary Exacerbation Reporting and Evaluation”. 
9.2.4 Telephone contacts (around Days 10, 38, 66, 94, 122 and 150) 
 
All patients will be contacted by phone on or about 10 days post-first dose of each c ycle, to inquire about 
potential adverse events. Specific attention will be put on probing about adverse events related to visual 
disturbances or dermatological problems as follows: “How is your vision since t he last visit/phone call?” and 
“How is your skin since the last visit/phone call?”  Actions may be taken if necessary. 
9.2.5 End-of-Cycle Visits (Visits 4, 5, 6 and 7, on Days 21(window: Days 21-22), 49(window: Days 
49-51), 77(window: Days 77-79), 105 (window: Days 105-107) and 161(window: Days 161-163) 
 
Special attention will be put on reports of symptoms/signs of pulmonary exacerbati on by patients as this may 
trigger a set of additional assessments. Details are presented in Sec tion 9.3 “Pulmonary Exacerbation 
Reporting and Evaluation”. Adverse events will be monitored and captured at all visits.

9.3 Pulmonary Exacerbation Reporting and Evaluation  
Below is the protocol definition of a pulmonary exacerbation, based on patient reporting i t to the Study Staff 
at the time of scheduled visits of the study or patient reporting it by communic ating with the Study Staff 
between scheduled study visits. Patients will be provided with contact inform ation cards to facilitate the 
reporting, which is deemed to be standard of care at the site. Since there are several PEx-related efficacy 
endpoints, all potential PEx-related signs and symptoms will be carefully doc umented in the specific e-CRF 
screening tool, in order to determine during the analysis phase if they met the protoc ol definition of PEx. A 
sample of this PEx screening tool can be found in the Sample Case Report Form.  
If indeed these result in a suspicion of a PEx requiring IV antibiotic treatm ent or any need to attend the 
clinical site, the patient will be invited to the clinical site  to complete the assessment and for the Study 
Investigator to determine if an intervention is required and in particular if a new  antibiotic (oral or IV) is 
required to treat the signs and symptoms. This visit at the clinical si te should be scheduled at the earliest 
convenience to avoid any worsening of the patient’s condition, e.g. not waiting for the ne xt scheduled study 
visit if it is not happening soon enough to ensure the proper standard of care. If the PE x happens when the 
clinical site cannot attend to it, then the patient may miss the pre-P Ex visit and procedures without impacting 
study participation. 
At the time of the visit, the site staff including the Study Investigator w ill confirm the previously reported 
signs and symptoms and any changes affecting them, as well as perform PEx ass essments such as pulmonary 
function tests, oxygen saturation and measure weight. It will also be an occas ion to review concomitan t 
medications and update adverse events. The Study Investigator will determine t he proper treatment, if any, 
for the signs and symptoms, all to be reported as adverse events, and if the Study Investigator determines 
that they constitute a PEx, they will also be reported as such in the e-CRF  and the patient’s records, along 
with the prescribed treatment. If an IV antibiotic course is required and the patient can attend the clinical 
study site prior to starting the IV antibiotics, then this will trigger the actions listed below in Section 9.3.2, 
prior to starting the first dose of IV antibiotics. The IV antibiotics may be administered at clinics more 
convenient for the patient, but under some oversight by the Study Investigator. 
During the IV antibiotic treatment days, the patients should receive the proper Standard of Care. They should 
be informed that another study visit will happen immediately or shortly after completing the IV antibiotic 
course.  That visit can coincide with the visit to the clinical sit e to receive the last dose of the IV antibiotic if 
indeed the antibiotic was administered at the clinical site. 
9.3.1 Protocol Definition of a Pulmonary Exacerbation  
The presence of a protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbation is defined by the following, the criteria of Fuch 
et al. 94: "Exacerbation of respiratory symptoms": a patient treated with parenteral antibiotics for any 4 of 
the following 12 signs or symptoms:  
Change in sputum  New or increased hemoptysis  Increased cough  
Increased dyspnea  Malaise, fatigue or lethargy  Temperature above 38°C  
Anorexia or weight loss  Sinus pain or tenderness  Change in sinus discharge  
Confidential and Proprietary  
Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  55 of 94  Change in physical 
examination of the chest  Decrease in pulmonary function by 
10 percent or more from a previously 
recorded value  Radiographic changes indicative of 
pulmonary infection  
This definition is not a guide to determine the need for a given type of treatme nt (for example: Oral versus 
IV antibiotics, corticosteroids or no). Each Investigator will determine to the best of its clinical judgement 
and for the benefit to the patient, the best treatment for the exacerbation epi sode. However, if indeed an IV 
antibiotic course is selected based on the severity of the PEx and other fac tors and the patient can attend the 
study site prior to starting the IV antibiotics, this will trigger the performa nce of PEx-specific assessments 
prior to initiating the IV antibiotic course and at the end of the course. This is outlined below: 
9.3.2 Specific additional testing for patients undergoing a pulmonary exacerbation treated with an 
IV antibiotic treatment cycle.  
 
Prior to starting and after completing the IV antibiotic treatment: 
1. Blood sampling for selective biomarkers such as: 
a. Plasma lipidomics: AA, DHA, calculated AA/DHA ratio and EPA; 
b. Markers of inflammation in: 
• Whole blood: total white cell count and absolute neutrophil count; 
• Serum: high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA); 
• Plasma : interleukins IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-
CSF), calprotectin, ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin, and neutrophil elastase antiprotease 
complexes ( NEAPC ). 
2. Clinical parameters such as FEV 1 percent predicted, weight, with BMI calculated. 
9.3.3 Pulmonary Exacerbation Evaluation and Conventions 
 
The duration of PEx antibiotic treatment, whether IV or Oral, should be set at the shortest possible duration 
achieving the desired eradication of infection and alleviation of the PEx symptom s. It should always be 7 
days or more in duration. Corticosteroids, albeit authorized for the treatment of PEx e pisodes, should be 
reserved for the more severe cases and their usage (dose and duration) set to the minimum required. 
 
For reporting purposes, a PEx episode is considered an adverse event and its severit y should be 
commensurate with the type of treatment required. The following is the informati on required at a minimum 
when reporting a PEx episode; please refer to the PEx case report form for more details. 
 
1. Precise dates of initial reporting by the patient to the study staff; 
2. Date of appointment set to evaluate the PEx; 
3. Complete list of items from the Fuch scale listed in Section 9.3.1 observed for the patient; 
4. Investigator judgment on the Severity of the PEx episode; 
5. Prescribed antibiotic treatment (name of medication, route of administration and planned duration of 
treatment) and other support medications (e.g. corticosteroids); 
6. Record of PEx-related specific blood sampling for pre-antibiotic treatment biomarkers, body weight 
and BMI, if the prescribed antibiotic treatment is intravenous; 
7. Record of PEx-related specific pre-antibiotic treatment FEV 1 value, if the prescribed antibiotic 
treatment is intravenous; 
8. Precise record of initiation of intravenous antibiotic treatment, if applicable; 
9. Record of PEx-related specific blood sampling for post-antibiotic treatment biomarkers, body weight 
and BMI, if the prescribed antibiotic treatment is intravenous;

treatment is intravenous; 
11. Actual time of completion of intravenous antibiotic treatment, if applicable; 
12. Any other information required in the case report form. 
 
9.4 Study Drug Treatment  
The total duration of study treatment is 6 cycles of 21 consecutive days of eit her LAU-7b or placebo treatment 
each followed by a 7-days treatment-free period. This represents approximately 24 weeks in total. 
During the study, eligible CF patients aged 18 years and older will be randomize d, after stratification 
according to 1- FEV 1 severity categories, 2- Number of PEx episodes in prior year, and 3- Co-administration 
or not of Kalydeco®, Orkambi®, Symdeko® or another commercially available CFTR modula tor product, 
using a 1:1 allocation to LAU-7b 300 mg per day or matching placebo, in a double blind fa shion. Treatment 
assignments will be determined through the IWRS system. 
In all cases, the study treatment will be administered on top of current Standard of Care therapies.  
9.4.1 LAU-7b (fenretinide) 
It consists of an orange opaque, size 00, hard gelatin capsule containing 100 mg of fenret inide. The 
formulation contains the following non-medicinal ingredients: polyvinylpyrrolidone, butylated 
hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, microc rystalline 
cellulose, dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate, ascorbic acid. The capsule she ll contains the following dyes: 
FD&C Red #3, FD&C Yellow #6 and titanium dioxide.  
The capsules are dispensed in dedicated Patient Kit (Drug Packs, 21 sache ts /Drug Pack). Study medication 
and their outer boxes must be stored in a -20oC freezer until dispensing to the patient who will then store in 
the refrigerator (2 to 8°C).  
9.4.2 Placebo 
A matching orange opaque, size 00 hard gelatin capsule without fenretinide will be used as a placebo for 
blinding purposes and will contain the same non-medicinal ingredients. 
The capsules are dispensed in dedicated Patient Kit (Drug Packs, 21 sache ts /Drug Pack). Study medication 
and their outer boxes must be stored in a -20oC freezer until dispensing to the patient who will then store in 
the refrigerator (2 to 8°C). 
9.4.3 Packaging, Labeling, and Shipping 
Study medication will be provided in patient kits containing enough medication for one  treatment cycle. 
Study drug will be specifically identified and bear instructions to ensure proper order of intake at all time s.  
Each Patient Kit box will bear a label that conforms to the appropriate l ocal regulations. The details will be 
described in the Pharmacy Manual. 
Shipments will be done using a Sponsor-defined courier, under frozen temperature (target -20oC), a 
temperature data logger may accompany the shipment to ensure an adequate chain of custody. 
9.4.4 Storage, Dispensing and Compliance Verification of Study Drug 
Upon receipt of the study drug shipper container, the investigator should record the receipt , date, time, and 
temperature of the product based on inspection or on the temperature logger reading. Any st udy drug that 
arrives in improper storage conditions or is damaged in any way must be reported to t he Laurent designee, 
Confidential and Proprietary  
Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  57 of 94  as instructed in the Pharmacy Manual, as soon as possible and shall not be administered until instructed 
otherwise. 
At the clinical sites, the study drug kits will be stored in a suitabl e -20oC (-15°C to -25°C) freezer in a secure 
location with limited access. Most preferably, the storage freezer will  be continually monitored and alarmed 
in order to document any excursion outside the desired temperature range. Alternativel y, the use of a 
calibrated min-max thermometer in the storage freezer is acceptable a s long as the thermometer readings are 
taken daily during weekdays, at a minimum. 
Upon instructions from the IWRS, the pharmacy/site staff will, at the time  of dispensing, formally identify 
and remove the assigned Patient Kit box(es) from the -20oC freezer and will check the expiry date on the 
labels on the Patient Kit box(es), at a minimum. Where applicable, the ne cessary Patient Kits will be sent (in 
an isolated container with ice packs) to the site staff actually dispensing the study drug to the pat ients. 
The study drug may only be used as directed in this APPLAUD protocol. It is aga inst regulations to use 
investigational products for other purposes. 
Prior to some of the end-of-cycle visits (Days 21, 77 and 161), the patients will be reminded to bring their 
used box(es) of supplies including the capsule containers, for drug accountability. The numbe r of capsules 
consumed per cycle will be recorded for the 21 days of study drug treatment. Patients  will be encouraged 
toward full compliance with instructions. 
9.4.5 Administration of Study Drug Treatment 
At specific patient visits, the patient will receive a number of Patient  Kit boxes sufficient until the next 
dispensing visit. To insure compliance (given the 7-days drug-free interval) SMS or phone reminders will be 
put in place at the beginning of each cycle. 
Study drug will be taken orally, along with the first meal of the day, morning if pos sible, along pancreatic 
enzyme supplements, where applicable. 
9.4.6 Study Drug Reconciliation and Destruction 
Investigators must maintain accurate records regarding the receipt, dispensing, and return or destruction of 
study drug for each patient in the study. Any used study drug containers, as well as a ny unused containers or 
unused portions of containers, must be maintained until accounted for by the monitor. Afte r accountability 
by the monitor and approval from the sponsor, the study drug and containers should be destroyed per t he 
site’s SOP for destruction of biological waste or returned to the Sponsor or Sponsor des ignee for disposition.  
9.5 Treatment and Protocol Compliance  
Patients are expected to receive oral daily doses based on the protocol sche dule and have all procedures done 
within the allowable time windows (detailed in the schedule of events, page 10).  
Regardless of allowable visit windows, study drug treatment cycles should alwa ys be 28 days, each 
consisting of 21 consecutive days of either LAU-7b or placebo treatment, followed by a  7-days treatment-
free period. In the event a patient misses  to start a cycle on time, he/she should start the cycle as soon as 
possible and inform the study site staff so that future visit schedule be adjusted accordingly. 
In the event a patient misses a scheduled assessment visit, this s hould be rescheduled for the earliest possible 
date. Patients who are persistently noncompliant may be withdrawn from the st udy at the investigator’s or 
the sponsor’s discretion.

The standard of care for patients with CF includes several medications, nutrit ional recommendations and 
procedures destined to improve their quality of life, treat symptoms and prevent pulmona ry infections. This 
section outlines the general study specific requirements in terms of concomit ant medications, vitamin 
supplements and potential drug interactions. Details and lists of specific allowed/disallowed 
medications/interactants will be provided as part of the Study Reference Manual. 
9.6.1 Allowed Concomitant Treatments: 
1. While it is understood that vitamin supplementation is essential for CF pa tients, in order to standardize 
and keep constant their intake, patients will discuss with study personnel t heir vitamin supplementation 
in daily standard dose oral multivitamin supplement (e.g.: AquADEK ™), so the a mount of vitamins 
intake can be agreed upon and monitored carefully. Particular attention will be placed on Vitamin A, for 
which existing supplementation must be assessed in detail such as ident ifying their type (provitamin A 
carotenoids, preformed Vitamin A) and quantities, so as to derive their Retinol A ctivity Equivalents 
(RAE). Patients should report any deviation to their agreed upon Vitamin A, D, C, E or K intake, 
including over-the-counter or fitness-related supplements. Plasma retinol and retinol-bi nding protein 
levels will be monitored regularly during the study. Also of interest is the z inc content of any 
supplementation taken by the patient at entry, which should be kept constant during the study; 
2. Medications to treat concomitant health conditions are allowed as long as  their intake has not changed in 
the in the 5 weeks prior to randomization, of which 2 weeks minimum are prior to s creening and is kept 
constant throughout the entire duration of the study participation. Included in this cate gory are pancreatic 
enzyme supplements, which should remain generally constant during the study.  Howeve r, patient self-
instructed acute dose increases justified by dietary fluctuations are acce ptable, and should be noted. 
Patients will report immediately any unexpected change/addition to their conc omitant medications, 
including medications added to treat a non-CF-related acute condition. Some cla sses of medication may 
be restricted; please see below the list of disallowed medications; 
3. Inhaled corticosteroids for asthma/rhinitis control are allowed. Systemic corti costeroid for asthma control 
should be minimized and should be restricted to control asthma exacerbations or pul monary infections 
associated with bronchospasm. A maximum dose of 5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent (or a higher 
loading dose tapered down in subsequent days)  will be acceptable on study for the above purpose but not 
chronic dosing; 
4. Steroids (but not corticosteroids) for routine metabolic deficiency states are a llowed, as long as their dose 
can be kept constant during the trial; 
5. Antibiotics treatments recommended by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation guidelines  which includes 
chronic suppressive aerosol antimicrobial therapy (tobramycin, preservative free tobramyc in (aerosol or 
powder), colistin or aztreonam) or azithromycin as an anti-inflammatory antibiotic. No other antibiotics 
than those recommended in the CCF guidelines are permitted. In all cases, cha nges or additions of oral, 
inhaled or intravenous antibiotics will be recorded on the Case Report Forms. 
9.6.2 Disallowed medications: 
After consulting the Study Reference Manual, in case of doubt about a patient’s concomitant medication, 
study personnel should consult with the Sponsor’s representative before enrolling/pursue participation of a 
patient on study. 
 
1. Any drugs that can lower plasma retinol levels, such as cholesterol-lowering m edications 
(cholestyramine, colestipol and colesevelam), neomycin, certain weight loss medi cations (orlistat, and 
olestra) and laxatives containing mineral oil; 
2. Drugs known to cause night blindness such as chloroquine and phenothiazines;

Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  59 of 94  3. Intake of omega-3 fatty acid is completely prohibited from the first date of scree ning and for the entire 
duration of participation to the study. The cessation of consuming any such supplements  must be at least 
2 weeks prior to randomization (Baseline); 
4. Intake of medications that may potentially act as modulators of intracellul ar ceramide levels or ceramide 
cytotoxicity, sphingolipids transport, or p-glycoprotein “MDR1” or “MRP1” drug/lipid transporters, such 
as: cyclosporine A or analogue; verapamil; tamoxifen or analogue; ketoconazole, chl orpromazine and 
thioridazine; RU486 (mifepristone); indomethacin; or sulfinpyrazone; 
5. Intake of CFTR potentiators/correctors. Only the intake of Kalydeco® (ivacaftor), Orka mbiÒ 
(ivacaftor/lumacaftor), Symdeko® (ivacaftor/tezacaftor) or another commercially ava ilable CFTR 
modulator product, is allowed, as long as administered over a minimum of 3 months prior to screening 
if naïve to CFTR modulators and 1 month if switched from another CFTR modulator product dee med to 
be well tolerated by the treating physician; 
6. Any other investigational drug is prohibited unless discontinued at least 30 days, m eaning from the last 
study drug administration of the prior study (or five elimination half-lives, whichever is longer) prior to 
screening. 
 
 
10 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
10.1 Spirometry  
 
All sites will be provided with spirometers to be used for all study asse ssments. Spirometry data will be 
transmitted to a centralized spirometry service for quality review. 
 
Spirometry will be performed according to the American Thoracic Society Guideli nes at time points noted 
in the Schedule of Events, page 10, and  according to the additional instructions that follow. Pre-
bronchodilator spirometry is defined as spirometry testing performed for patients who have 
• Withheld their short-acting bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol) or anticholinergic (e.g., ipratropium) for 
more than 4 hours before the spirometry assessment; 
• Withheld their long-acting bronchodilator (e.g., salmeterol) for more than 12 hours before the s pirometry 
assessment; and  
• Withheld their once-daily, long-acting bronchodilator (e.g., tiotropium bromide) for more than 24 hours 
before the spirometry assessment. 
 
During the Screening Period, spirometry assessments may be performed pre- or post-bronchodilat ors. At all 
other visits, all spirometry assessments should be performed "pre-bronchodilator." During the Treatment 
Period, spirometry assessments must be performed before dosing. In the event that a patient forgets to 
withhold bronchodilator(s), spirometry should be performed according to the following: 
 
• If a patient's Day 1 spirometry is pre-bronchodilator but on a subsequent visit, the pat ient forgets to 
withhold bronchodilator use, a post-bronchodilator spirometry will be obtained for that visit  only, and 
the visit will not be rescheduled. 
• If, on Day 1, the patient forgets to withhold his/her dose of bronchodilator, spirometry should be  
performed post-bronchodilator, and all subsequent spirometry measurements (according to the Schedule 
of Events, page 10) should be performed post-bronchodilator. 
• Each spirometry assessment will be recorded in the source documents as pre-bronc hodilator or post-
bronchodilator.

10.2 Lipidomic endpoints   
 
Blood samples for the scheduled determination of lipidomic endpoints (AA, DHA  and EPA) will be obtained 
at the time points listed in the Schedule of Events, page 10, specificall y on Days 1, 21, 161 and 189 ( Visits 
#2, 3, 7 and 8, respectively). Results will not be communicated to blinded staff, in order to maintain the study 
blind, unless required for emergency reasons. In addition, if the patient experiences a PEx episode during the 
study and this episode requires an IV course of antibiotic treatment, this wil l trigger pre- and post-antibiotic 
blood sampling for several markers including lipidomic; this PEx-related asses sment is detailed in Section 
9.3.2. Details of collection, storage and processing are provided in the Study Referenc e Manual and when 
instructed to do so, prepare all the samples in need of shipment to the designa ted central lab LabConnect 
LLC, for dispatch to the specialist laboratory, Invitrozyme Inc., 500 West Cartier Boulevard, Laval, Québec, 
Canada H7V 5B7 and subsequently to Altasciences (Algorithme Pharma Inc), 575 Armand-F rappier Blvd., 
Laval, Quebec, Canada.  
The lipids will be extracted from the sample and esterified by methods ins pired by Folch 95 and Gellerman 
& Schlenk 96. The esters will be quantified by chromatography and tandem mass sp ectrometry. The 
concentrations of the fatty acids AA, DHA  and EPA, will be normalized by plasma phospholipids and free 
fatty acids content and will be expressed as nmol/ mL. Extraction from and normalization by red blood cell 
phospholipids will also be explored using samples collected at specific clinical sites .  
10.3 Markers of inflammation  
Blood samples for the scheduled determination of systemic markers of inflammati on will be obtained at the 
time points listed in the Schedule of Events, page 10, specifically on Days 1, 21 and161 (Visits #2, 3 and 7, 
respectively). In addition, if the patient experiences a PEx episode during the s tudy and this episode requires 
an IV course of antibiotic treatment, this will trigger pre- and post-antibiotic  blood sampling for several 
markers including inflammation; this PEx-related assessment is detail ed in Section 9.3.2. Details of 
collection, storage and processing are provided in the Study Reference Manual and w hen instructed to do so, 
prepare all the samples in need of shipment to the designated central lab  LabConnect LLC, for whole blood-
based analyses and dispa tch of plasma and serum to the specialist laboratory, CTRC Core Laboratory, 
Aurora, CO. 
 
For immunological, inflammation markers, an aliquot of whole blood, plasma or serum w ill be used 
according to the test, as following:  
- Whole anti-coagulated blood will be used for the determination of: total white  cell count and absolute 
neutrophil count;

Height (screening only) and weight will be measured with shoes off at time poi nts listed in the Schedule of 
Events, page 10, specifically at screening and on Days 1, 21, 77, 161 and 189 ( Visits # 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8, 
respectively).   Weight will be measured before the morning dose of the study drug, where applicable. T he 
body mass index (BMI) will be calculated using standard methods. 
 
In addition, if the patient experiences a PEx episode during the study and this epi sode requires an IV course 
of antibiotic treatment, this will trigger pre- and post-antibiotic assessm ent of a few clinical variables 
including weight and BMI; this PEx-related assessment is detailed in Section 9.3.2. 
 
10.5 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PsA) density in sputum  
 
Sputum will be obtained by hypertonic saline induction at time points listed  in the Schedule of Events, Page 
10, specifically at screening, Days 77 and 161 (Visits #1, 5 and 7, respectively)  In order to minimize inter-
site variability in the quality of the sputum samples, a protocol for inducing and obtaining sputum samples 
will be used across sites. It can be found in the Study Reference Manual. Trai ning on the procedures will be 
provided to the clinical site staff.  
 
The initial processing of the samples will be carried out at the clini cal sites; the sputum induction will result 
in the patient producing a series of sputum samples. Upon obtaining the samples , their quality will be 
confirmed on the spot by macroscopic examination and weighing. Tubes containing suita ble samples will be 
shipped overnight within 24 hours, in refrigerated state to the specialist laboratory  Advanced Diagnostic 
Laboratories, National Jewish Health, 1400 Jackson Street, Denver, CO 80206, USA. 	
 
10.6 Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire – Revised  (CFQ -R) 
 
Patients will be asked to complete the CFQ-R in their native language, i f validated translations are available.  
The CFQ-R will be completed before dosing at visits noted in the Schedule of E vents, Page 10, specifically 
on Days 1, 77, 161 and 189 (Visits #2, 5, 7 and 8, respectively). The respiratory domain subsc ore will be 
extracted at time of data processing. The questionnaires provide information about de mographics; general 
quality of life, school, work, or daily activities; and symptom difficulties (perta ining to CF). Copies of the 
CFQ-R used in this study will be provided in the Study Reference Manual. Validat ed translations  of the 
CFQ-R, if available, will be provided for non-English-speaking patients/clinical s ites. The CFQ-R must be 
completed before the start of any assessments scheduled at that visit a s mentioned in the Timing of 
Assessments, Section 10. 
 
10.7 Fenretinide Through Samples  
 
In this study, patients will contribute PK samples for the determination of steady- state fenretinide through 
concentrations (C min), 4-methoxy fenretinide (4-MPR), a significant but inactive metabolite as well as those

Cmin will be obtained pre-dose or 24 hours post-previous dose, at the time of the safety la b sampling, on Days 
21 and 161 time points, as listed in the Schedule of Events, Page 10. More spec ifically, since this is a double 
blind placebo controlled study, all patients whether or not on fenretinide, will undergo the sampling 
procedure. Results will not be communicated to blinded staff, in order to maintai n the study blind, unless 
required for emergency reasons. 
Patients will be informed at time of screening of the mandatory nature of the PK procedure and pre-dose 
requirements (arrive fasting at the clinical site on Days 21 and 161). All t he blood collection and sample 
processing must be carried out in reduced light condition. Details of collecti on, storage and processing are 
provided in the Study Reference Manual and when instructed to do so, prepare all the samples in need of 
shipment to the designated central lab LabConnect LLC, for dispa tch to the bioanalytical laboratory,

10.8 Other exploratory biomarkers: ceramides, metabolipidomics , systemic bone 
formation/resorption markers  and oxidative stress markers  
 
Blood samples for the determination of other biomarkers, such as ceramides, metabol ipidomic, systemic 
bone formation/resorption markers and oxidative stress markers, will be obtained a t the time points listed in 
the Schedule of Events, Page 10. 
10.8.1  Ceramides 
In this study, ceramides will be analyzed by, and according to a method developed by Dr. Juan de Sanctis at

10.9 Bone density  
The bone density will be determined at time points listed in the Schedule of Events, Page 10, specifically on 
Days 1 and 189 (Visits #2 and 8, respectively), at selected sites and in t he first 24 patients who volunteer to 
participate in this additional investigation at the given study sites. T he lumbar spine bone mineral density 
will be measured with a dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) instrument. Specifics  to ensure consistency of 
DXA measurement such as the expression of results as a Z-score normalize d according to age and gender, 
the need to use the same instrument and the need to follow the institutiona l procedure to ensure within-patient 
comparability of measurements will be described in the Study Reference Manu al. 
 
10.10  Matouk Disease Score  
 
The Matouk disease score will be determined at time points listed in the Schedule of Events, Page 10, 
specifically on Days 1, 77, 161, 189, (Visits #2, 5, 7 and 8, respectively), at selec ted sites who will volunteer 
to participate in this exploratory investigation. The objective of this investi gation is to further validate the 
Score in the framework of a well controlled therapeutic study. An example of the  subsection questionnaires 
is presented in the Study Reference Manual. Given the lack of recognized biomarke rs for CF inflammation 
clinical studies, and the long time required for FEV 1 to show changes, we believe that exploring additional 
alternatives will be welcomed by the CF community. 
The Matouk Disease Score was previously published 97, 98, and reviewed by Hafen 99 and was used recently 
in two studies; 1- A non-interventional study on pulmonary exacerbations by Dr Matouk and 2- A Phase Ib 
study of fenretinide 3, 100. Hafen recommends Matouk scoring as a potential tool to assess the clini cal response 
to various treatment regimens on a short-term basis. The validation showed its  value in prognostic evaluation 
of patients in end-stage disease, providing better discrimination for survival in the last 2 years of life than 
FEV 1 % predicted alone 98. 
The Matouk Disease Score is a sum comprised of four subsections: clinical , pulmonary function tests (PFT), 
chest radiographic score (CXR) and complications score. The 3 key subsections wit h high impact on the total 
score internal consistency are the Clinical, the PFT and the Complication subsections. The CXR score is not 
essential for the Matouk score to perform well. If a new CXR is available, t hen its grading is used. Otherwise, 
the most recent CXR can be used instead. In the absence of a CXR, the radiographi c score is omitted, and 
the total score internal consistency, as depicted by the Cronbach’s coefficient alpha, is preserved. 
Consequently, the CXR score is optional.  
The clinical subsection involves the evaluation of the patient’s symptoms by the physician. The symptoms 
evaluated are weight, weight change, dyspnea, cough frequency, sputum colour, thickness and vol ume, 
physical examination (air entry, crackles, hyperinflation), respiratory rate/cardiac frequency, sputum culture, 
appetite and general condition.  
The PFT subscore is based on the results of pulmonary function test.

Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  64 of 94  The complication sub-score tabulates the serious events that are known to ne gatively impact CF disease: 
pulmonary exacerbation requiring therapy, pneumothorax, haemoptysis, respiratory failure, cardiac 
enlargement or congestive heart failure and pulmonary surgery.  
The CXR score is the evaluation of the chest x-ray [optional in this study] 
For the clinical subsection, the PFT and CXR subscores, the higher the better. For the complications score, 
the lower score is better. The total score is calculated by subtracting the complications score from the three 
subscores (total score = clinical + PFT + CXR (if available) – Complications). 
The score uses information and measurements that should already be available at the clinical site. To 
facilitate the data entry/capture, the Sponsor will develop clear  and simple templates to collect such data, 
and training will be provided. The sites will be instructed to send the completed forms to a centralized 
location for scoring and interpretation.

Safety evaluations will include reporting of Adverse Events (AEs), clinical l aboratory assessments, clinical 
evaluation of vital signs, ECGs, as well as ophthalmological questionnaires and examinations.  
 
11.1 Adverse Events  
 
All AEs will be assessed, documented, and reported in accordance with ICH GCP guidelines. 
11.1.1  Documentation of Adverse Events 
 
Adverse events will be collected from the time of informed consent until t he last scheduled study follow-up, 
4 weeks after the last dose of the study drug, or until the last unscheduled safe ty-related assessment whichever 
occurs latest. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence (which does not neces sarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment). An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational product, whether or not related to the study drug. This includes any oc currence that was new 
in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline condition. Planned hospit al admissions or 
surgical procedures for an illness or disease that existed before the patient  was screened in the study are not 
to be considered AEs unless the condition deteriorated in an unexpected manner during the study (e.g. surgery 
was performed earlier than planned).   
 
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities, are  considered AEs if 
they result in any one of the following:   
• Discontinuation of study treatment; 
• Require treatment or any other therapeutic intervention; 
• The necessity for further diagnostic evaluation (excluding a repetition of the same  procedure to confirm 
the abnormality); 
• Association with clinical signs or symptoms that may have a significant  clinical impact, as determined 
by the Investigator.  
 
Patients are encouraged to report AEs spontaneously or in response to general, non-direc ted questioning. All 
AEs are to be followed until resolution or until a stable clinical endpoint is reached. The investigator should 
question patients about AEs and changes in pre-existing illnesses since the ir last visit and must record the 
information in the patients’ medical records. The onset and end dates, severity, relationship to study agent, 
action taken, and outcome must be recorded for each AE. All AEs are to be re corded on the appropriate e-
CRF and in detail on the source documents. 
 
Any AE that occurs within 4 weeks following the last dose of the study drug wil l be considered treatment 
emergent (TEAe) and must be recorded in the e-CRF and, if an SAE, reported immedia tely to the Sponsor. 
Adverse events that are ongoing at the end of th e 4-week follow-up period should be marked as ongoing. 
However, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to follow up on these events  until resolution, according 
to standard medical care.   
 
Any AE or SAE that the investigator becomes aware of outside of the reporting pe riod until the end of the 
study that has or is believed to have a causal relationship to the study drug s hould be reported to Laurent

Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  66 of 94  Pharmaceuticals via telephone.  Patients who experience AEs will be monitored with relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory tests, as determined by the Investigator. All AE s and laboratory abnormalities 
encountered during the study should be followed until resolution or stabilization of the event(s). Any action 
taken and follow-up results must be recorded in the patient’s medical record. Foll ow-up laboratory results 
should be filed with the patient’s source documentation and e-CRF. For all AEs t hat require the patient to 
discontinue treatment, relevant clinical assessments and laboratory test s should be repeated on at least a 
monthly basis until final resolution or stabilization of the event(s). These as sessments should be captured in 
the source data and SAE forms but will not be entered in the e-CRF. 
 
All AEs for randomized patients will be recorded in the e-CRF and the patient 's source documents. AEs for 
patients who are screened but not subsequently randomized in the study will be re corded only in the patient's 
source documents. The following data should be documented for each AE:  
• Description of the event; 
• Classification of "serious" or "not serious"; 
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable); 
• Severity; 
• Causal relationship to study drug(s); 
• Action taken; 
• Outcome; 
• Concomitant medication or other treatment given   
 
An independent DSMB will assess AEs that are reported from study sites. T he DSMB will meet at regular 
intervals throughout the duration of the study or will meet as determined by the DS MB chair, and may 
recommend systematic treatment arm dose reduction or early termination of the  study for safety reasons (see 
Section s 7.2.4 and 7.2.2). 
11.1.1.1  Adverse Event Severity 
 
The Investigator must determine and record the severity of all serious and non-seri ous AEs. The Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.03, (Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program  
website; available at: http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  ; 
accessed 01 December 2015) should be used for grading the severity of AEs. AEs of CTCAE  Grades 4 and 
5 should be documented as "life-threatening." 
 
The severity of an AE that does not appear in the CTCAE scale should be dete rmined according to the 
definitions below. Clinically significant laboratory tests should be recorded as A Es in the patient's source 
documents and e-CRF.  
 
Severity will be assessed according to the following criteria: 
Classification Definition 
Mild (Grade 1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular 
activities  
Moderate (Grade 2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes 
with regular activities  
Confidential and Proprietary  
Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  67 of 94  Severe (Grade 3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular 
activities  
Life-threatening (Grade 4) Any adverse drug experience that places the patient, in the 
view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death  
11.1.1.2  Adverse Event Causality 
 
Causality will be assessed according to the following criteria: 
Classification Definition 
Definitely Related Reasonable temporal relationship to study drug 
administration 
Follows a known response pattern (i.e., drug is known to 
cause this AE) 
There is no alternative etiology  
Probably Related Reasonable temporal relationship 
Follows a suspected response pattern (i.e., based on similar 
drugs) 
Little or no evidence for a more likely alternative etiology  
Possibly Related  Reasonable temporal relationship 
Some evidence for a more likely alternative etiology  
Not Related Does not have a temporal relationship. Or, 
Definitely due to alternative etiology  
ICH guidelines (March, 1995) clarify “reasonable causal relationship” to mean “tha t there are facts 
[evidence] or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.” 
The causality assessment must be made by the Investigator based on informat ion available at the time that 
the AE/SAE worksheet is completed. The initial causality assessm ent may be revised as new information 
becomes available. 
11.1.1.3  Study Drug Action Taken 
 
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken should be 
classified according to the categories shown below: 
 
Classification Definition 
Dose Not Changed Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE; 
Dose Interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE;  
Confidential and Proprietary  
Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  68 of 94  Drug Withdrawn Study drug administration permanently discontinued in 
response to an AE;  
Not Applicable Action taken regarding study drug administration does not 
apply. "Not applicable" should be used in circumstances 
such as when the investigational treatment had been 
completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is 
possible. 
 
11.1.1.4  Adverse Event Outcome 
 
An AE should be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final  outcome. The outcome 
should be classified according to the categories shown below: 
 
Classification Definition 
Recovered/Resolved Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms; 
Recovered/Resolved with 
Sequelae Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms;  
Not Recovered/Resolved 
(Continuing) Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an 
AE, such that it remains ongoing;  
Fatal Outcome of an AE is death. "Fatal" should be used when 
death is at least possibly related to the AE;  
Unknown Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,a patient lost to follow-
up). 
 
11.1.1.5  Treatment Administered 
 
The Investigator will ensure adequate medical care is provided to patients for any AEs, including clinically 
significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the Investigator will describe whether any 
treatment was administered for the AE. "Yes" is used if any treatme nt was administered in response to an 
AE and may include treatments such as other medications, hospitalization, surgery, or physical therapy. "No" 
indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE. 
11.1.2  Clinically Significant Assessments 
 
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, ophthalmological examinati ons and vital signs should 
be assessed and those deemed a clinically significant worsening from basel ine documented as an AE. When 
possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment should be provided rather than the abnormal test result 
alone (e.g. urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, the abnormal study assessment 
itself should be listed as the AE (e.g. bacteria in urine or decreased hemoglobin).  
Confidential and Proprietary  
Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  69 of 94  An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the patient has one or more of the 
following: 
• Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment; 
• Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
• A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from study drug treatment.  
 
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence  of any of the above criteria, does 
not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determinati on of whether the study assessment results 
are clinically significant must be made by the Investigator. A laboratory abnorma lity judged to be Grade 4, 
in itself, may not constitute an SAE unless the clinical status of the patient indicate s a life-threatening AE. 
11.1.3  Serious Adverse Events 
 
SAEs are generally any AEs that result in one or more of the following:   
• Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after participation 
in the study but within 30 days post-study, and is suspected of being a delayed toxicit y due to 
administration of the study drug); 
• Is immediately life threatening (i.e., presents an immediate risk of death at the time of the AE, not an AE 
that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe);  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization*; 
• Causes persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
• Other important medical events that may not be immediately life threat ening or result in death or 
hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical judgment, are thought to jeopardize the patient and/or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes defining an SAE. 
 
*An inpatient hospitalization is defined as an admission for any length of time . A hospitalization for 
administration of study drug, for routine or planned clinical procedures, or for “social” reas ons (not the result 
of any adverse change in the patient’s condition) should not be considered an AE and shoul d not be reported 
as a SAE. If the patient experiences any adverse change in condition during hospita lization, the condition 
must be reported as an AE or SAE according to the above definitions. 
 
For the APPLAUD study, the following AEs may not require expedited reporting based upon the judgment 
of the Investigator: 
• AEs that occur due to Standard-of-Care CF therapies and are consistent with the  package labels for such 
products; 
• AEs due to Pulmonary Exacerbation and unrelated to the study drug. 
The investigator should consult with the medical monitor if there is any doubt re garding classification of an 
SAE.  
 
Definition of Life-Threatening Adverse Experience: 
An adverse experience is life threatening if the patient was at immedi ate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred (i.e., it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more seri ous form, might have caused 
death). For example, drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be 
considered life threatening, even though drug-induced hepatitis can be fatal. 
 
 
Definition of Disabling/Incapacitating Experience:

Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  70 of 94  An adverse experience is incapacitating or disabling if the experience result s in a substantial and/or 
permanent disruption of the patient’s ability to carry out normal life functions.  
 
Any SAE that occurs during this study , including death from any cause other than disease progression, 
must be reported to the designated contact for SAE reporting within 24 hours via the e-CRF (preferred), 
telephone, fax, or email, whether or not related to the study agents. If initially reported via telephone or email, 
this must be followed up by a e-CRF/written report and submitted within 24 hours of the  occurrence of the 
SAE.  Follow-up information after the initial report, including the causality assess ment and a narrative, should 
be sent via e-mail using the paper SAE report form.

11.1.3.1  Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
It is imperative that the safety desk be informed within 24 hours of an SAE so that reporting to the health 
authority can be met within the required time frame.  
 
Because of the need to report to health authorities all serious adverse react ions in a timely manner, it is vitally 
important that an Investigator report immediately any adverse experiences which would be considered 
serious, even if the Investigator does not consider the adverse experience to be c linically significant or drug 
related. Should the Investigator become aware of an SAE (regardless of relationshi p to study drug) that 
occurs within 4 weeks after the last dose of the study drug, the SAE must be reported in accordance with the 
procedures specified in this protocol.  
 
All SAEs that are not resolved by the end of the study, or that were not resolve d upon discontinuation of the 
patient’s participation in the study, are to be followed until the AE resolves , the AE stabilizes, the AE returns 
to baseline values (if a baseline value is available), or it is shown that the AE is not attributable to the study 
drug or study conduct. If a patient or a female partner of a patient becomes pregnant duri ng the study, the 
patient will be removed from the study without receiving further study medication. Fol low-up regarding the 
outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae in the infant is required. Pregnanc ies are considered 
immediately reportable AEs (within 1 working day) and are to be documented in the e-CRF. 
11.1.3.2  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR)  
SUSARs are SAEs that are possibly related or related to the study drug and a re unexpected (i.e., not listed in 
the investigator brochure). SUSARs will be collected and reported expeditiously to competent authorities 
and independent ethics committees (IECs)/institutional review boards (IRBs) acc ording to regulations. 
Medical and scientific judgment is to be exercised in deciding whether expe dited reporting is appropriate in 
other situations, such as for important medical events that are not immedia tely life threatening or do not 
result in death or hospitalization, but jeopardize the patient or the patient population.

tests. Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local Inves tigator for management of emergent 
urgent medical conditions. If a local laboratory test result is found to be abnormal  and clinically significant, 
it should be verified by the central laboratory as soon as possible after the Inves tigator is made aware of the 
abnormal test result. The Investigator may base the assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value if it is 
not possible to send a sample and obtain a timely report back from the central laboratory. 
 
In addition, according to the Schedule of Events, the following tests are also performed:

performed locally. 
• Pregnancy (β-human chorionic gonadotropin) tests for females of childbearing potential: Se rum or urine 
samples will be obtained as specified in the Schedule of Events, page 10 a nd analyzed at the central 
laboratory (serum) or locally (urine). The urine pregnancy test on Day 1 must be negative before the first 
dose of study drug. A positive result during the study will result in immediate i nterruption of study drug. 
• Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH; Screening Period only): Blood sample for FSH wi ll be measured for 
any suspected postmenopausal female with at least 12 months of continuous sponta neous amenorrhea. 
Serum FSH levels must be ≥40mIU/mL to be considered postmenopausal. 
• Plasma retinol and retinol binding protein: while this is to support an exploratory correlation with 
ophthalmological assessments, measurements may be used to support decisions made in relation with 
ophthalmological TEAe. Abnormal values may result in ad-hoc follow-up determinati ons, when 
associated with ophthalmological TEAe. Post-screening results will not be communicated to blinded 
staff, in order to maintain the study blind, unless required for emergency reasons. 
 
Finally, clinical laboratory evaluations may be performed at other times if j udged to be clinically appropriate 
by the Investigator. 
 
11.3 Vital Signs and Physical Examinations 
 
Vital signs, complete Physical Examinations (PE) and Focused PE will be performed according to the 
Schedule of Events, page 10. 
A complete PE (review of all body systems) will be performed at screening a nd completion visits. At all 
other scheduled visits, a Focused (symptom-directed as well as mandatory pulm onary examination) PE will 
be performed as appropriate.  
A complete PE includes a review of the following systems: head/neck/thyroid, eyes/ears/nose/throat, 
respiratory, cardiovascular, lymph nodes, abdomen, skin, musculoskeletal, and neurological. Brea st, 
anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed only when medically indi cated. After screening, any 
clinically significant abnormal findings in PE should be reported as AEs. 
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature (oral or tympanic), pulse rate, oxygen 
saturation and respiratory rate. These will be assessed following a 5-minute  rest (seated) and before any 
scheduled blood sample collection and Pulmonary Function Testing, but after ECG and questionnaires (see 
Section 9.1 for Timing of Assessments). At visits when study drug is taken at the site, vital sign assessments 
will be collected before dosing. 
 
11.4 Electrocardiograms 
 
Standard, digital 12-lead ECGs will be performed according to the Schedule of Events, page 10.  
 
Sites will use their own ECG equipment. A window of ±15 minutes will be permitted around the nominal 
times for all post-dose ECG assessments. Additional 12-lead ECGs should be pe rformed at any other time if 
clinically indicated and such instances should be recorded in the proper unscheduled event e-CRF. 
 
Performance of all ECGs must adhere to the following guidelines in order to minim ize variability and 
consistent assessments of each patient from time point to time point. 
Confidential and Proprietary  
Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  73 of 94   
• ECGs will be performed after the patient has been supine for at least 5 minutes; 
• The ECG will be performed before any other procedures that may affect heart rate (H R; e.g. blood draws, 
including PK, see Section 9.1 for Timing of Assessments); 
• The ECG will be performed before the morning dose of study drug during the Treatment Period. 
 
A hard copy of the ECG will be printed and signed by the Investigator at the site . To ensure the safety of the 
patients, the Investigator or designee at the clinical site will compa re all QT segment-corrected (QTc) 
measured after predose on Day 1 to the average of the predose measurements of QTc  on Day 1. If the QTc 
is increased by >45msec from the average of the predose measurements on Day 1 or t he absolute QTc value 
is >500msec for any scheduled ECG, two (2) additional ECGs will be performed within 10 minutes, at least 
1 minute apart, to confirm the original measurement. If either of the QTc values from these repeated ECGs 
remains above the threshold value (>45msec from the average of the 3 predose values on Day 1 or 
>500msec), a single ECG must be repeated at least hourly until QTc values from 2 successive ECGs fall 
below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement. If the QTc va lue remains above the 
threshold value (>45 msec from the average of the 3 predose values on Day 1 or >500 msec) on repeated 
measurement or is noted on >2 occasions with no identified alternative etiology for the increased QTc study 
drug, then discontinuation from study drug treatment may be required after discussion with the Medical 
Monitor. Patients in whom treatment is discontinued for increased QTc should ha ve their QTc monitored 
closely until it normalizes or returns to baseline. 
 
11.5 Ophthalmologic Examinations and Night Vision Questionnaire 
 
A particular attention will be paid to ophthalmological safety, since fenret inide is known to cause a decrease 
in circulating vitamin A that may result in symptoms of nyctalopia, generall y mild and rapidly reversible. In 
order to capture as much information as possible on ophthalmological TEAes, ophthalm ological assessments 
are performed at planned timepoints, and include both specific tests and use of a  patient questionnaire. At 
screening, a Night Vision Questionnaire (NV Q) will be self-administrated, along with a full 
ophthalmological examination, and any abnormality will be recorded in the e-CRF. Cli nically significant 
abnormalities may result in exclusion from the study, in particular low light vi sion abnormalities or dark 
adaptation abnormalities. 
 
Moreover, the NVQ will be used according to the Schedule of Events, Section 2, t o ask three (3) specific 
questions probing possible ophthalmological AEs. These questions will cover the fol lowing elements: 
Question 1: Dark adaptation difficulties; Question 2: Vision in condition of poor l uminosity; Question 3: 
Recovery after dazzling. Results will be compared to previous occurrence to detec t changes. Furthermore, 
possible ophthalmological AEs will be sought using non-suggestive questions at i ntermediate assessments 
done via phone calls. Details and specific questionnaire sheets are present ed in the Study Reference Manual. 
 
Proposed escalating safety monitoring of dark adaptation in planned Phase 2 
 
Step 1: Night Vision Questionnaire (NV Q) 
 
A specific questionnaire will be employed to assess  the extent of reported symptoms and to trigger 
an escalation of objective assessments to determine if indeed the reporte d symptoms translate into a 
confirmed episode of nyctalopia. Also, a severity grading using CTCAE shall be used in order to 
qualify the confirmed episode of nyctalopia. The planned NVQ is presented below:

LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  74 of 94  Question 1. Dark adaptation difficulties: In comparison with people around you, do you adapt eas ily 
to semi-obscurity when going from a bright to a dim environment, such as daylight t o a movie theatre 
or tunnel. 
 
Question 2. Vision in condition of poor luminosity: Are you able to perceive t he outlines of objects in 
a domestic and semi-obscure environment, such in the indoor candlelight or poor str eetlight, or to 
see the content of closets and kitchen cabinets?  
 
Question 3. Recovery after dazzling: When you transition from a semi-obscure e nvironment to a 
strongly lit one, do you remain dazzled? 
 
Questions Q1 and Q2: Y (Yes) means normal. Questions Q3: N (No) means normal. 
 
Assessment of the extent of reported symptoms : Level 0: no abnormal answer; Level 1: one abnormal 
answer ; Level 2: two abnormal answers; and Level 3: three abnormal answers. 
 
NVQ administration: Screening, Day 21, Day 77, Day 161, Day 189. 
 
Level 1 NVQ will result in the given symptom to be considered a Grade 1 AE. However, it will not 
trigger an escalation to Step 2. Level 2 or 3 NVQ will automatically t rigger a complete 
ophthalmological examination (Step 2) and its AE severity graded by the ophthalmologist. 
 
Step 2: Complete ophthalmological examination, including specific dark adaptation tests 
 
Administration: Screening, Day 77 and Day 189, and following any Level 2-3 NVQ report. 
Suggested dark adaptation test to be included: a test able to evaluate da rk-adaptation changes such as 
cone-rod break and the final rod threshold (see note below).  Severity grading using CTCAE to be 
performed on confirmed nyctalopia episodes. If the reported symptoms do not get confirmed by t he 
objective measures in Step 2, the default CTCAE severity Grade 1 will be used. 
 
Step 3: Electroretinogram (ERG) 
 
Administration: to be performed only if clinically indicated, in particular if t he ophthalmological 
examination results are equivocal, or the type of signs/symptoms requires it. 
 
 
 
Ophthalmologic examinations will be performed by (or under the oversight of) a licens ed ophthalmologist 
at screening, Day 77 and Day 189 visits. It can also be triggered on demand if a patient reports signs of 
ophthalmologic nature upon questioning or at the time of the scheduled ophthalmologic ques tions posed on 
several occasions, according to the Schedule of Events, page 10.  
 
The scheduled complete ophthalmologic examination will consist of the followi ng: Examination of visual 
acuity, examination for amblyopia, examination of eyelids, conjunctiva, cornea, pupillary reactions to light 
and accommodation, low contrast visual function (Contrast Sensitivity), specific da rk adaptation testsiii, lens, 
	
iii	Specific Dark adaptation tests: May consist either of a dark adaptometry test performed with a dark adaptometer or 
equivalent OR a full field ERG test of the scotopic vision, and if possible the photopic vision, aft er dark adapting 
and light -adapting the patient, respectively. The order of testing may be done according to specific equipment in use.

macula. 
 
The ad-hoc ophthalmologic examinations may differ since directed to potential m edical condition based on 
the referral by the study Investigator. Such on-demand examinations should be recorded in det ail, with results 
appended, in the proper unscheduled event e-CRF. The Medical Monitor should be notified of any additional 
ophthalmologic examinations. 
 
The results of the post-study scheduled examination and any ad-hoc examination must  be contrasted with 
the baseline ophthalmologic examination and any new adverse finding should be reported a s an AE. Those 
that meet the definition of clinically significant assessment (see s ection 11.1.2 on clinically significant 
assessments) should be brought to the attention of the Medical Monitor, for forwarding to the DSMB. 
 
 
 
  
	
The use of an ERG in lieu of the dark adaptometry test waives the need for further second line ERG testing, un less 
requested by the ophthalmologist. In extenuating circumstances such as the inability to locate  the equipment to 
perform the above specific da rk adaptation testing despite thorough feasibility assessments, such testing may be 
waived for a given clinical site. In all cases howeve r, the site must have access, even distally, to an ERG in case a 
second line ERG examination is requested .

A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide details of the methods  of analysis to address all study objectives. 
The SAP may be amended during the course of the study, but will be finalized before  the cutoff date for any 
analysis.  
 
Data summaries by treatment group will be presented. For continuous variables, da ta will be summarized 
with the number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, and minimum and maxi mum values by 
treatment group. For categorical variables, data will be tabulated in frequency tables to display the number 
and proportion of patients for each category by treatment group. Baseline assessments for each outcome 
variable will be defined as the last measurement obtained before the first  dose of study drug except the 
baseline FEV 1 which will be the average of the screening and baseline best values, to re duce variability. 
Statistical significance will be set at the 5% level. 
 
Diligent efforts will be made to prevent missing data in the study. For exa mple, patients who discontinue the 
study treatment early or initiate medication changes (including those prohibited by the protocol) should still 
be followed for all regularly scheduled visits for safety and relevant efficacy as sessments, or for a minimum 
of a 1-month follow-up. A clear  distinction should be made between treatment discontinuation and study 
withdrawal. Efficacy assessments occurring after treatment discontinuation s hould not be included in the 
per-protocol analysis. 
 
12.1 Sample Size Determination  
 
The primary measure of efficacy is the absolute change in percent predicted FE V1 from baseline to Week 
24, fenretinide compared to placebo-treated patients. The sample size has been estimated for t his endpoint. 
 
A minimum of 136 adult CF patients will be randomized in this study. The foll owing is calculated based on 
comparing changes in the parameter (compared to baseline) between groups: 
 
FEV 1 % predicted (absolute change) : The sample size was estimated according to the following 
assumptions:  
• A t-test of the difference of the mean  absolute change of FEV 1 of each group (active versus placebo) will 
be used;  
• The FEV 1 data (absolute change) is normally distributed in each treatment group; 
• The variance, expressed as SD is 8%; 
• The clinical difference of interest (effect size) is 4%; 
• The minimum statistical power of the t-test is 80% (0.8). 
 
Below in Figure 6, are isotherms showing the required number of observations per treatm ent group (X-axis) 
as a function of the difference of interest (Y-axis) for different experimental assum ptions of power (p) and 
SD (VanDevanter, direct communication).

Figure 6: Isotherms of detectable significant differences as a function of sample size per treatment gro up 
(assuming a 1:1 randomization) under different assumptions of statistical power (p) and varia nce of FEV1 % 
predicted (absolute change) . 
 
For the assumptions listed above, the solid blue line represents the applica ble isotherm. Therefore, a 
minimum of 60 completed patients per group  will be required to detect as significant a difference of 4% 
between fenretinide and placebo for FEV 1 % predicted (absolute change). While there will be patients that 
drop out after starting dosing, it is not expected to exceed 10%, hence the need to randomize 136 patients, a 
multiple of 8, due to the use of 3 stratification factors (2x2x2). The desired number of c ompleters is also a 
multiple of 8. 
 
More than 136 patients will be recruited to ensure that at least 136 patients start dosing. Patients who are 
withdrawn or lost to follow-up prior to baseline will be replaced to ensure at least 136 eligible patients start 
dosing. 
 
12.2 Analysis Populations  
 
• The intent-to-treat (ITT) population  will include all patients randomized to a treatment group who 
complete the baseline evaluations. The ITT population will be used for the pri mary analyses of all 
study endpoints, taking into consideration the specific populations described below.  
• The per-protocol (PP)  population  will include all patients randomized to a treatment group to whom 
at least 5 cycles of study treatment are administered in accordance wi th the protocol. The PP 
population will serve as the basis for secondary analyses of all study endpoints, taking into 
consideration the specific populations described below. 
• The FEV 1 population  will include all patients who have validated FEV 1 values (values judged to be 
obtained from adequate expiratory curves by central review) for at least 4 time points of the study 
comprising at the minimum the baseline and Day 161 assessments.

Study Protocol LAU -14-01 
LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  78 of 94  • The PEx subset population  will include all patients who experience an IV antibiotic treated PE x 
episode during the study after completing at least one cycle of study drug treatment. 
• The safety  population  will include all patients randomized to a treatment group who received at  
least one dose of study drug treatment. This population will serve as the basi s for analyses of all safety 
endpoints.  
• The pharmacokinetic population  will include all patients randomized to the LAU-7b treatment 
group and provided the C min blood samples. This population will serve as the basis for the between-
group comparison of the steady-state fenretinide pharmacokinetics grouped according to the  a priori  
stratification factors and to compare the results with those obtained during the prior Phase Ib study.   
 
 
12.3 Baseline and Demographic Characteristics  
 
Demographic and baseline data will be summarized by treatment group using desc riptive statistics. 
Demographics will include, among others, date of birth, gender, ethnicity, weight, height , body mass index. 
Childbearing status and pregnancy test results will be summarized descriptivel y for each treatment group. 
Protocol deviations/violations will be provided as a patient data listing onl y. Major protocol deviations/ 
violations will be identified for analysis purposes. 
 
The demographics and baseline characteristics summary will be presented for the ITT and the PP populations 
to allow review of the characteristics of those included in the efficacy a nalyses, which will be based on these 
analysis sets. The PEx subset will also be summarized separately. 
12.3.1  Prior and Concomitant Medications 
 
Medications used in this study will be coded by using the World Health Organiz ation Drug Dictionary 
Enhanced and categorized as the following:  
• Prior medication: Any medication that started before the first dose of study drug, i ndependently of when 
it ended. 
• Concomitant medication: Medication continued or newly received at or after first  dose of study drug to 
the last follow-up (4 weeks after the last dose of study drug). 
• Post-treatment medication: Medication continued or newly received after the last follow-up (4 weeks 
after the last dose of study drug). 
 
A given medication can be classified using the above, in one or more categories . If a medication has a missing 
or partial missing start/end date or time and cannot be determined whether w as taken before the first dose of 
study drug, concomitantly, or after 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug, it will  be considered as prior, 
concomitant, and post-treatment. Prior medications and concomitant medications will be summarized 
descriptively based on the ITT population. Post-treatment medications will be listed for each pat ient. 
12.3.2  Study Drug Exposure 
 
The duration of study drug exposure is defined as follows: Last dose date minus first  dose date plus 1 day, 
regardless of any interruptions in dosing. If the last dose date of study drug is missi ng, the patient's 
discontinuation or completion date will be used for analysis purpose. Duration of study drug exposure will 
be summarized descriptively as a continuous variable (number, mean, SD, median, m inimum, and 
maximum), by study group, using the safety population subset of the ITT population. 
12.3.3  Study Drug Compliance

LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  79 of 94  Study drug compliance will be performed on the Safety population. Study drug compliance wi ll be assessed 
by calculating as follows: 100 × (1 − [total number of days of study drug interruption]/[(duration of study 
drug exposure) – (total duration of planned drug free intervals)]). The total number of days of study drug 
interruption is defined as the sum of (number of days of each study drug interruption), where numbe r of days 
of each study drug interruption is defined as the interruption end date minus the correspondi ng interruption 
start date plus 1 day. Treatment compliance percentages will be summari zed descriptively as continuous 
variables (number, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum). The percentage of patie nts whose 
compliance is <80% or ≥80% will be summarized, by study group. 
 
12.4 Efficacy Analysis  
12.4.1  Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
 
The study will be considered successful if a statistically significant  advantage for fenretinide over placebo is 
obtained for the absolute change in FEV 1 percent predicted from baseline to Week 24. 
Values for percent predicted FEV 1 as well as their change relative to baseline will be tabulated by time point 
and descriptive statistics will be used. In the analysis for the primary e fficacy endpoint, change from baseline 
in FEV 1 % predicted (absolute change), including all measurements up to Week 28 (both during and after 
treatment measurements, including after treatment discontinuation) will be analyzed based on a mixed-effect 
repeated-measure model. Even though no imputations will be used in the primary ana lysis, a sensitivity 
analysis will be conducted where missing data points will be imputed usi ng appropriate interpolation 
methods; extrapolation methods will be used for truncated FEV 1 % predicted values. 
The planned model will include the absolute change from baseline in FEV 1 % predicted as the dependent 
variable; treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effec ts; and patient as a random effect 
with adjustments for a) FEV 1 % predicted determined at the Screening/Baseline Visits (average where 
possible), b) PEx frequency in the prior year, and c) Co-administration or not of Kalydeco® (i vacaftor), 
Orkambi® (ivacaftor/lumacaftor), Symdeko® (ivacaftor/tezacaftor) or another commerci ally available 
CFTR modulator product. Additional post-hoc analyses may be performed in an exploratory manner 
depending on the frequency of other phenotypes or concomitant drugs. The primary result obtained from  the 
model will be the treatment effect at Week 24. The estimated mean treatment effect, a 95% confidence 
interval, and a 2-sided P value will be generated. Alternative methods wil l be used if necessary due to data 
not meeting the standard requirements for the proposed analysis. 
Full details will be specified in the SAP. 
12.4.2  Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
 
For all secondary efficacy endpoints, the primary analysis will be based on data  obtained at Week 24 or 
cumulated up to Week 24. 
 
Pre-defined Clinical Parameters: 
 
• Count data variables: The time to first antibiotic use, the number of antibiot ic treatments, the number of 
days of antibiotic treatment (other than chronic inhaled antibiotics already st arted prior to trial or oral 
chronic azithromycin) and the number of protocol-defined PEx will be tabulated by treatm ent and 
compared using Count regression will be used for the group comparison of the number of antibiot ic 
treatments and the number of days of antibiotic treatment. The number of protocol-defi ned PEx will take

described below for the time to event data. 
• Time to event data variables: The time to first protocol-defined PEx, the t ime interval between IV 
antibiotic-treated PEx episodes will be tabulated by treatment and compare d using a Cox proportional 
hazards regression analysis. The model will include treatment as main e ffect with covariates for age 
category at baseline, FEV 1 % predicted category (as per entry stratification), PEx number category in 
prior year (as per entry stratification). A patient without exacerbation before wi thdrawal or completion 
of the study is considered censored at the time of withdrawal or completion of t he study. If the 
proportional hazards assumption is violated, a stratified analysis will be c onducted using stratified Cox 
regression. Additionally, Kaplan-Meier methods will be used to produce graphical pre sentations of the 
survival (exacerbation-free survival) by treatment and to estimate cumulative survival rates by treatment.  
• Relative change (in %) in FEV 1 % predicted from baseline to Week 24: Analysis of this variable will be 
similar to that of the primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint 
• Body weight and BMI changes from baseline/screening will be summarized using desc riptive statistics 
by treatment and compared between treatments using a linear mixed-effects model with treatment as 
fixed effect; visit and treatment-by-visit interaction as random effects; and adjustment for FEV 1 % 
predicted category (as per entry stratification), PEx number category in prior year (as per entry 
stratification) and weight or BMI at baseline as covariates. 
 
Pharmacodynamic Endpoints:  
 
Values for AA, DHA and AA/DHA ratio as well as their change relati ve to baseline will be tabulated by time 
point and descriptive statistics will be used. The rate (frequency) of normaliz ation (normalization meaning a 
parameter value reaching the mean parameter value observed in healthy controls ± 1 Standard Deviation) will 
be calculated for the end-of-treatment cycle values, and the treatments wi ll be compared using two-sided 
multivariate logistic regression with baseline AA/DHA ratio as a c ovariate. Alternative methods will be used 
if necessary. 
 
Values for pharmacodynamic parameters EPA , inflammation markers, metabolipidomic markers, systemic 
bone formation/resorption markers, markers of oxidative stress, ceramides), as measure d in plasma (or 
serum, or blood, as required), as well as their change relative to baseline, wi ll be tabulated by time point and 
descriptive statistics will be used. An analysis of variance will be  used to compare treatments assuming 
datasets meet standard pre-requisites for such analysis (normal or log-normal dis tribution and homogeneity 
of variance). Alternative methods will be used if necessary. 
 
Pharmacokinetic Endpoints: 
 
Blood samples for fenretinide C min analysis will be obtained from all patients randomized to fenretinide. 
Patients randomized to placebo will provide samples (to maintain the study blind) but will not contribute to 
the C min dataset. 
 
Plasma fenretinide C min concentrations will be presented in a tabular summary, by sampling day and 
compared between groups of CF patients receiving fenretinide grouped according to the a-priori  stratification 
factors. 	
 
 
 
Quality of Life Endpoints:

LAU -7b for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in Adults   Amendment 3, V1.3, Jul 31st, 2019  81 of 94  Quality-of-life data will be derived from the questionnaires according to the corre sponding scoring manuals 
and will be summarized by treatment group. Patients’ health state will be derived from the CFQ-R 
questionnaire, including the extracted CFQ-R respiratory domain, a separate endpoint. Addit ional 
exploratory health condition will be evaluated by the Matouk Disease Score. Da ta will be summarized by 
treatment group using descriptive statistics.  Analysis of the absolute cha nge from baseline for the CFQ-R 
(overall and respiratory domain) will be performed similarly to that of the primary e fficacy endpoint with 
the addition of the CFQ-R respiratory domain score at baseline as a covariate. 
12.4.3  Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints 
 
• On the subset of patients that exacerbates and are treated with IV anti biotics, the changes of selective 
biomarkers in blood, serum and plasma from prior to the start of IV antibiotics to a fter the IV antibiotic 
treatment will be summarized by treatment group and analyzed using descriptive  statistics. The mean 
changes will be compared between fenretinide and placebo using parametric and no n-parametric 
statistics, where appropriate.  
• The overall change in the PsA density in the sputum, from baseline through 12 and 24 weeks of treatment, 
and the AUC of the CFU from baseline to 24 weeks will be the variables st udied for this investigation. 
Data will be summarized by treatment group and analyzed using descriptive st atistics. The mean changes 
and the AUC data will be compared between fenretinide and placebo using parame tric statistics assuming 
datasets meet standard pre-requisites for such analysis (normal or log-normal dist ribution and 
homogeneity of variance).  
• The overall change in lumbar spine bone mineral density, from baseline to last follow-up on Week 28 
will be summarized by treatment group and analyzed using descriptive statist ics. The mean changes will 
be compared between fenretinide and placebo using parametric statistics as suming datasets meet standard 
pre-requisites for such analysis (normal or log-normal distribution and homogeneity of variance). 
• Data from this trial may be collected and analyzed in various other retrospec tive analyses as detailed in 
the SAP. 
12.5 Safety Analys es  
 
The safety analyses will be performed at least thrice, 1- when a minimum of half of the enrolled patients 
have completed at least one dosing cycle and corresponding safety information is available, along with Day 
21 plasma retinol and retinol binding protein concentration data, 2- when at least half of the enrolled patients 
have completed a minimum of 3 dosing cycles and corresponding safety information is available, along with 
Day 77 plasma retinol and retinol binding protein concentration data, and 3- at the t ime of final analysis. 
Safety analyses will be performed on the safety population (those patients who re ceive at least one dose of 
study drug). Blinded safety data will be assessed by the DSMB at regular meet ings. The DSMB may request 
unblinding of patients for safety concerns in addition to receiving the unblinded mid-study analysis results. 
The study will remain double blinded to the Investigators, patients and sponsor’s st aff until the end of the 
study, unless circumstances require unblinding. 
 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by the following:  
• Adverse events described and categorized according to the MedDRA, version 16 or more recent.  
• Clinically relevant changes from baseline in vital signs  
• Clinically relevant changes from baseline in 12-lead ECG  
• Clinically relevant changes from baseline in physical examinations  
• Clinically relevant changes from baseline in safety laboratory assessments (hematology with differential 
count, biochemistry, and urinalysis)

ophthalmological symptoms, more specifically nyctalopia  
• Change in PEx incidence and antibiotic treatment requirement. 
12.5.1  Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be tabulated with reported incidences by treatment, numbe r of patients that presented 
adverse events by treatment, serious adverse events by treatment, number of adverse  events by body system 
and by treatment. Summaries will be presented by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term.  
For the purpose of analyses and tabulations, AEs will be classified as pret reatment AEs, TEAEs, or post-
treatment AEs. More specifically: Pretreatment AE are those that s tarted before the first dose of study drug. 
TEAE are those that increased in severity or that was appeared at or aft er the first dose of study drug and 
before or at the last follow-up, planned for 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug. P ost-treatment AEs are 
those that increased in severity or that appeared after the last follow-up, pla nned for 4 weeks after the last 
dose of study drug. For AEs with missing or incomplete start dates, if there is  no clear evidence that the AEs 
started before or after the first dose of study drug, then the AEs will be classified as TEAEs.  
AE summary tables will be presented for TEAE only and will include the fol lowing: All TEAEs, TEAEs by 
relationship, TEAEs by maximal severity, TEAEs leading to treatment dis continuation, Serious TEAEs and 
fatal TEAEs. All AEs, including pre-and post-treatment AEs, will be presente d in individual patient data 
listings. 
The number and percentage of patients with at least one AE, as classifi ed by preferred term and system organ 
class, will be summarized for each treatment group. For these summaries, pa tients with multiple events will 
be counted only once per preferred term. AEs will also be summarized by severity and relationship to study 
drug. At each level of summarization, the event with the highest level of se verity or strongest drug 
relationship will be presented. 
All AEs must be listed. In addition, detailed listings will be provided for patients who die, experience a SAE, 
or discontinue the study because of an AE. These listings will include trea tment, patient’s age, duration of 
follow-up, amount of fenretinide received, and time since last intake. Patients  who develop Grade 3-4 
toxicities will also be listed separately. 
A Fisher’s Exact test will be used in an exploratory sense to evaluate differences between treatment groups 
in the incidence of treatment-emergent and clinically significant AEs, grade d according to CTCAE outlined 
in Section 11.1.1.1.  
12.5.2  Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
 
Safety laboratory variables (e.g., hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis results) wil l be presented in SI 
units at each time point using descriptive statistics (mean, standard de viation, median, minimum, and 
maximum). Change from baseline values for each variable will also be presented by treatment group. The 
number and percentage of patients with shift changes from baseline (normal/missi ng, high, and low 
according to the reference range) to the highest/lowest laboratory evaluation during the  TEAE period will be 
tabulated by treatment group. 
 
Summary tables of laboratory results will be prepared to examine the worst toxi city grade on study. Cross-
tabulations of patients by maximum post-baseline toxicity will be presented, as appropriate. Patients who 
develop Grade 3-4 laboratory toxicities will also be listed separately.

in the incidence of laboratory toxicities graded according to CTCAE grading outlined in section 11.1.1.1.  
12.5.3  Vital Signs  
Vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, oxygen saturation and respiration rate) will be presented 
at each time point using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviati on, median, minimum, and maximum). 
Change from baseline values for each variable will also be presented by treatment group.  
 
The number and percentage of patients that meet the abnormal criteria for wi th shift changes from baseline 
of the vital signs during the TEAE period will be presented by treatment group. The  specific changes of 
interest are:  
• Diastolic Blood Pressure ≤45 mmHg and decrease from baseline ≥10 mmHg, Dias tolic Blood Pressure 
≥110 mmHg and increase from baseline ≥10 mmHg; 
• Systolic Blood Pressure ≥160 mmHg and increase from baseline ≥20 mmHg, Diastol ic Blood Pressure 
≤45 mmHg and decrease from baseline ≥10 mmHg; 
• Temperature ≤35oC and ≥38oC 
• Heart rate ≤50 bpm and decrease from baseline ≥20 bpm, heart rate ≥120 bpm and inc rease from baseline 
≥20 bpm; 
• Oxygen saturation values and respiratory rate determined by the Investigator to be c linically abnormal 
(and reported as an AE). 
No statistical analyses of vital signs are planned. 
12.5.4  ECG 
 
For ECG measurements, a summary of raw values and change from baseline values will be provided by 
treatment group for each scheduled time point for the following standard digital ECG measurements: PR, 
QT, and QT corrected for heart rate (QTc) intervals, QRS duration, and HR. The numbe r and percentage of 
patients with shift changes from baseline (normal/missing, not clinically s ignificant, and potentially clinically 
significant according to overall ECG evaluation) to the worst ECG evaluation during the TEAE period will 
be tabulated by treatment group.  
 
In addition, the number and percentage of patients will be tabulated by maximum on -treatment value of 
QT/QTc intervals, categorized as ≤500msec and >500msec, as well as ma ximum on-treatment change from 
baseline value of QT/QTc intervals, categorized as >30 msec.  
 
No statistical analyses of ECG data are planned. 
12.5.5  Ophthalmologic Examinations and Night Vision Questionnaire 
 
The answers to the NVQ questionnaires and the resulting Levels will be  summarized by treatment group. 
The results (normal/abnormal, new adverse findings) of the planned post-study ophthalmologic  examinations 
will be presented and summarized by treatment group. Ad-hoc examinations and findings will also be 
presented and contrasted with the baseline examination. All reported symptoms of nyctalopia and 
hemeralopia will be tabulated by treatment group. Reported symptoms confirmed by objec tive measures will 
be tabulated separately by treatment group. Individual data will be presented in listings.

13.1 Case Report Forms  
 
All patient data generated by the study will be recorded in each patient’s e-CRFs. Data reported on the e-
CRFs that are derived from source documents should be consistent with the source doc uments or the 
discrepancies should be explained. e-CRFs will be considered complete when all  missing and/or incorrect 
data have been resolved and all safety data have been recorded. 
 
The Investigator, or designated representative, should complete the e-CRF as soon as  possible after 
information is collected. e-CRFs must be completed only by persons designated by the  Investigator. The e-
CRF system should enable an audit trail that will provide the user's ident ification information and the date 
and time of any entry/correction. The completed e-CRF will be reviewed by Laurent Pharmaceuticals or its 
agents on a routine basis. 
 
The Investigator must approve formally all the information in the e-CRFs for the pati ents for whom he/she 
is responsible. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may ins pect all records related to 
the study. 
13.1.1  Source Documentation 
 
Source documents are considered to be all information in original records and certifi ed copies of original 
records of clinical findings, observations, data, or other activities in a clinic al study necessary for the 
reconstruction and evaluation of the study. The Investigator and designees agree to ma intain accurate e-CRFs 
and source documentation as part of the case histories. Source documents are the  originals of any documents 
used by the Investigator, sub-Investigator, or hospital/institution that will allow  verification of the existence 
of the patient and substantiate the integrity of the data collected during the  trial. All data entered into the e-
CRF also must be available in the source documents. The Investigator will a llow designated representatives 
of Laurent Pharmaceuticals, IRB and regulatory bodies, including the FDA  to have direct access to the source 
documents to verify the data reported in the e-CRFs. Personally identifiable source  documentation shall not 
be copied or removed from the Investigator site, and to the extent permitted by law  and/or regulations, will 
not be made publicly available. All representatives of Laurent Pharmaceutic als, IRB and regulatory bodies 
must respect confidentiality. 
13.1.2  Record Retention  
 
Study records and source documents need to be preserved for at least 15 years after t he completion or 
discontinuation of/withdrawal from the study, or 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in 
an International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) region, whichever is the longest time period.  
 
14 MONITORING  
 
In accordance with current applicable regulations, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and Laurent 
Pharmaceuticals procedures, monitors will contact the site before the sta rt of the study to review with the site 
staff the protocol, study requirements, and their responsibilities to satisfy regula tory, ethical, and Laurent 
Pharmaceuticals requirements. When reviewing procedures for data collection, the discussion will include 
identification, agreement, and documentation of data items which will be recorded in each patie nt’s e-CRF.

access to all relevant documents. 
 
15 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 
The sponsor or its designee will perform the quality assurance and quality control activities of this study. 
However, responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of the st udy data presented to Laurent 
Pharmaceuticals lies with the principal or qualified Investigator generating the data. 
 
Laurent Pharmaceuticals or its designated representative will conduct a study site visit to verify the 
qualifications of the principal Investigator and sub-Investigators, inspect clinica l site facilities as needed, and 
inform the Investigator of responsibilities and procedures for ensuring adequate and correct study 
documentation. 
 
Study data for randomized patients will be entered into an e-CRF by clinical s ite staff using a secure, 
validated web-based electronic data capture (EDC) application. Select dat a for patients not randomized will 
also be collected in e-CRFs.  
 
Instances of missing, discrepant, or uninterpretable data will be queried with t he Investigator for resolution. 
Any changes to study data will be enacted in the e-CRF and documented in an audi t trail, which will be 
maintained within the clinical database. 
 
16 COMPLIANCE, PROTOCOL AMENDMENT AND DEVIATION  
16.1 Compliance  
 
It is very important that no modifications to the protocol should be made without t he approval of Laurent 
Pharmaceuticals and Investigators. Changes that significantly affect the safe ty of the patients, the nature, the 
scope and the scientific integrity of the study will require IRB/IEC notification/ approval before their 
implementation. Exceptions are cases where the modification is necess ary to abrogate an apparent immediate 
risk to the patients. Laurent Pharmaceuticals or designee will submit a ll protocol modifications to IRB/IEC 
and the required regulatory authorities. When there is a need for immediate deviat ion from procedure s 
enunciated in the protocol, the Investigator will contact Laurent Pharmaceutic als to discuss the course of 
action and possible alternatives, if at all possible, before any implementa tion of changes. Any deviation from 
protocol must be fully documented in the source documentation and in the study document ation on protocol 
deviations.

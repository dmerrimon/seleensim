Although fetal s upraventricular tachyarrhythmia s (SVAs), including atrial flutter (AF) and other forms of 
supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), are the most common causes of intended in -utero fetal therapy, none of the 
drugs used has ever been eva luated for their effects on the mother and her child in a Randomized Clinical  Trial 
(RCT). In the absence of such evidence, there is no consensus for the optimal manag ement. The Fetal Atrial 
Flutter and Supraventricular Tachycardia ( FAST) Therapy Trial is a prospective multi -centere d trial that 
address es this knowledge gap to guide future fetal SVA therapy to the best of care.  
Study components of the FAST Therapy  Trial include:  
 Three prospective RCT  sub-studies  (FAST RCT)  to determine the efficacy and safety of specific 
transplacental drug regimens in suppressing fetal AF without hydrops, SVT without hydrops, and SVT with 
hydrops . Additional information  on the RCT sub -studies is available at ClinicalTrials.gov under listing 
#[STUDY_ID_REMOVED].  Participation in the regulated FAS T RCTs is currently restricted to pre -selected centers.   
 
A prospective observational cohort study (FAST Registry)  is a non-regulated Registry  which seeks to establish 
an international database of fetal SVA management done to date , to be used to  publish i nformation on the results 
of current prenatal care and to evaluate  the need for additional  FAST RCTs . Participation in FAST Registry 
requires site REB approval and an executed legal contract with the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto  (REB 
Number#  1000048953) .  
  
This protocol applies to centers that are participating  in the RCT sub -studies.  
The primary outcome  of the FAST  RCT  will be the proportion of term deliveries  of live -born child ren with a 
normal cardiac rhythm. Term delivery is defined as bi rth 37 0/7 weeks gestation or later.3, 4 Secondary outcomes  
will det ermine the efficacy of 1st line, 2nd line, 3rd line, and maintenance drug therapy in controlling the different 
arrhythmias prior to birth and patient safety. We expect faster cardioversion to be significantly associated with 
higher rates of normal term deliveries and less perinatal mortality, morbidity and r esource utilization due to 
shorter hospitalization.  
 
2.  STUDY BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE   
2.1 CLINICAL RELEVANCE O F SVA . SVA is the most common cause  of fetal tachycardia  ≥180 b pm, affect ing 
1/4,000 pregnancies.  Despite its relative rarity, i t is a leading  cause of fetal heart failur e, prematurity and 
perinatal death . The development of fetal hydrops  (defined by  >1 of these symptoms: abdominal, pleural,  
pericardial effusion (s); skin edema ) is associated with perinatal mortality  as high as 35% . The risk of hydrops 
increases if SVA  presents at a younger gestational age and is rapid and enduring, but even intermittent SVA  may

fetuses with SVT presented with hydrops, which was associated with a perinatal mortality rate of 21%.1 In 
another study by Simpson et al , fetal hydrops occurred in 41% of 127 SVA cases and was associated with 27% 
mortality.5 In the a bsence of fetal hydrops, the risk of SVA -related perinatal mortality is much lower (0% -4%).1, 5  
2.2 MECHANISM S OF SVA . The main mechanisms of fetal SVA,  AF and SVT,  may be  distinguished by 
echocardiograph y.7, 8 Their prenatal differentiation is clinically relevant since AF is associated with a lower 
conversion rate to sinus rhythm in response to antiarrhythmic  drug  therapy  compared with SVT .1 AF is sustained 
by a circular macro -reentrant pathway within the atrial wall and the AV node is not part of the reentry circuit.9 
Typical atrial rate s range  between 400 and 500 bpm, which is  most commonly  associated with 2:1 AV conduction  
and ventricular rates between 200 -250 bpm. The atrial rate  in SVT is almost  always  <300 bpm. Fetal SVT itself is 
produced by 3 main mechanisms: 1) AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT), involving the AV node for antegrade 
(AV) conduction and a fast retrograde (VA) conducting accessory pathway; 2) permanent junctional reciprocating 
tachycardia (PJRT) , like AVRT but with slow retrograde pathway conduction; and 3) atrial ectopic tachycardia 
(AET) due to an atrial focus with enhanced automaticity. The differentiation of AVRT , PJRT  or AET by fetal 
echocardiography  can be difficult  and will n ot be required for the RCT sinc e there is no evidence that it a ffects the 
result of therapy. In addition, AVRT (60%) and AF (30%) account for 90% of all fetal SVA cases.1 Rare cases 
with SVT and AF will be classified in FAST accord ing to the main  mechanism at the 1st exam.9  
2.3 MANAGEMENT AND OUTCO ME OF FETAL SVA . Management opt ions upon a new diagnosis of  fetal SVA 
include observation, drug therapy, and delivery with pos tnatal cardioversion. Care  decisions are largely influenced 
by SVA characteristics, gestational age, fetal-maternal health, and willingness of the mother to undergo treatment. 
Close observation  without drug therapy is  usually a safe approach for the fetus with infrequent , brief SVA  
episodes, as heart failure  will rarely develop. Conversely , fetuses  with incessant SVA  tend to develop fetal 
hydrops if left in tachycardia . Prior to 3 7 weeks, transplacental pharmacological treatment  to obtain a normal 
rhythm is the preferred option because the hazard associated with preterm  delivery outweighs the risks of drug 
therapy. After 3 7 0/7 weeks, primary delivery by caesar ean section  is often elected . Cardioversion prior to birth 
will also facilitate vaginal delivery by allowing the interpretation of the fetal heart rate tracings during labor. In 
the study by Jaeggi1, 15% of mothers did not  receive prenatal treatment  because the arrhythmia was considered 
insignificant, 15% were immediately delivered for postnatal cardioversion, and 70% receiv ed transplacental drug 
therapy . Still, p reterm delivery was a frequent outcome  of treated cases (37%)  due to failure of the elected drug to 
rapidly control the fetal SVA. Ne wborns with SVT typically receive  antiarrhythmic  drug therapy  during  the 1st 
year, while AF is expected to not recur .9    
Optimizing the management to improve  outcome s of fetal SVA  is a major  research focus  of the FAST Therapy 
Trial . Unnecessary interventions and complications could be prevented with the primary use of the most efficient 
therapy for fetal SV A. Based on published data , the preterm birth rate should be no higher than 7.6% .10, 11 With an 
incidence of 37% preterm  deliveries  in Jaeggi’s study ,1 fetal S VA was associ ated with 5 -fold increased odds of 
prematurity . Preterm infants are at substantially greater risk s for mortality and morbidity than term infants due to 
immaturity -related complications , including  respiratory distress syndromes (7.5 fold increased  risk e.g. at 37 vs. 
>38 weeks ).12 The neonatal need of intensive car e and length of hospital stay are inverse ly related  to the

term infants.14 In addition , compared with term babies , deliver y <38 weeks is associated with poorer  
development al and educational outcomes , and increased burden of later disease .11, 15, 16 Finally, delivery by 
caesarean section is associated wit h a substantial list of maternal risks , with correlations that typically favor 
vaginal delivery , including  shorter hospital stays , less m aternal morbidity,  lower  costs , and  lower risks for adverse 
obstetric and perinatal outcomes for next births .11, 17  
2.4 TRANSPLACENTAL THERAP Y OF SVA . The rationale to offer transplacental drug therapy  to mothers with fetal 
SVA is to achieve rapid and lasting  cardio version , to prevent or treat fetal heart failure , and to allow the 
pregnancy to continue to term with the delivery of a healthy child. Transplacental  fetal therapy generally occurs 
with one of three 1st line agents , digoxin, flecainide, and sotalol , which  all have been used for decades to treat 
fetal SVA. Amiodarone or direct fetal drug administration  are mainly reserved for therapy -resistant  SVA  because 
of increased  risks of maternal and fetal adverse events (AE s).5-9, 18-31  Detailed descriptions o f drug a ctions and 
possible AEs related to the use  of the study drugs are provided in the Monographs . In brief:  
 DIGOXIN  actions include parasympathetic slowing of sinus node and prolongation of the AV nodal 
refractoriness. In the absence of hydrops, o ral digoxin is well absorbed and  transferred to the fetus , to reach 
fetal serum concentrations that are close to those in ma ternal serum (F/M ratio 0.8 -1) within 3 -5 days.2 No 
serious AE s (SAE s) have  been reported , but nausea, anorexia, headache, visual disturbances and dizziness  are 
among the more common patient complaint s.1   
 
 FLECAINIDE  inhibits Na+ channels, slowing conduction and increasing refractoriness of all cardiac tissues. 
Flecainide is well -absorbed and transferred to the fetus to reach therapeutic levels within 3 days (F/M ratio 
0.7-0.9).2, 32 At maternal  serum concentrations >1 mcg/ml,  the QRS interval may prolong and the risk of 
proarrhythmia increase. Infrequent m aternal  AEs include blurred vision, nausea, constip ation, dizziness, and 
headache . Maternal  SAEs have not  been reported  but there is one case of unexplained in-utero demise  of a 
non-hydropic fetus 23 years ago.6 
 
 SOTALOL  is both an iKr channel and β -blocker, with β -blockade as the main effect at doses <160 mg/day. The 
combined effects decrease heart  rate, and prolong action potential duration  and tissue refractoriness throughout 
the heart.33, 34 Sotalol is well  absorbed  and transferred to reach a fetal steady state level similar to maternal 
plasma level (F/M ratio 0.7-2.1).2, 22 The agent  is usually well-tolerated and maternal SAEs have not been 
reported. Maternal sotalol up to 480 mg/day did not cause significant prolongation of neonatal QTc.35 
Symptoms related to β -blockade may include fetal or maternal bradycardia.1 There is a single case of 
unexplained fetal death  in the abs ence of fetal hydrops  in the literature .21  
In summary , antiarrhythmics act o n one or several ion channels and/or the autonomous system.  Drug-specific 
differences in actions  and pharmacokinetics likely predetermine  the potential of a compound in terminating and, 
once ach ieved, in suppressing S VA recurrence.36 AVRT involve s myocardium, the AV node an d accessory 
pathway (s) in the reentrant circuit. Alteration of the conduction and refractoriness properties of any of these 
tissues may terminate AVRT . Digoxin  prolongs AV nodal refractoriness . If the prolongation is sufficient, reentr y 
will terminate beca use the AV node beco mes refractory to premature depolarization. Flecainide  delays the

system at faster rates. Sotalol  delays AV nodal conduction and pr olongs the refractory period to electrical 
stimulation of the myocardial and conduction tissues. Suppression of arrhythmias confined to atrial tissue (AET; 
AF) is possible by flecainide  and sotalol that directly act on atrial cells. Digoxin has probably no such direct 
effects on  atrial cells but slows tachycardia rates, owing to improved ventricular filling with lower atrial pressure 
and distension. The hemodynamic changes  may alter electr ical tissue properties and indirectly suppress AF.37 
2.5 EFFICACY  OF TRANSPLACENTAL THERAPY .  
PROSPECTIVE STUDY.  There are no  other prospective randomized studies of fetal SVA therapy to date .  
RETROSPECTIVE STUDIES . Retrospective studies report  inconsistent  success rates for all 1st line agents in 
treating fetal SVA.2 In studies (total n=226) using oral digoxin  monotherapy , in-utero cardioversion has been 
reported in 50% to 100% of SVA without  hydrops, but in <20% of SVA with hydrops.5, 8, 9, 18, 24, 30 Flecainide 
(n=70) has resulted in sinus rhythm in 58% to 100% of SVA cases without  hydrops and in 43% to 58% of those 
with hydrops.6, 18, 24, 26, 29, 31 Sotalol (n=56) has be en successful in 40% to 100% of SVA  without  hydrops , and in 
50% with hydrops.21, 22, 29 While the studies confirm that there is no single medication that can convert all fetal 
SVAs to a normal rhythm, direct comparisons of study results is impossible as study cohorts varied in disease 
severities, definitions of treatment success, drug doses, schedule s, and many other factors. Data on the impact of 
the same agents as 2nd line monotherapy or in  combination  to treat therapy -resistant SVA is largely unavailable .2  
DRUG COMPARISONS . The only study to directly compare transplacental drug therapies  by Jaeggi et al ., an 
initiator of the FAST Therapy Trial,  represented  the experience of 3 sites, each using a different 1st line agent .1 An 
adverse primary outcome, defined as a) preterm delivery, b) perinatal death, or c) persistent SVA to birth , was 
documented in 45% of 75 treated SVT cases (outcome a) 32%; b) 8%; c) 5%) and 58% of 36 treated AF cases (a) 
50%; b) 3%; c) 6%), and was mainly related to incomplete SVA control at the time of the event . However, Jaeggi’s 
study also demonstrated that the fetal response to treatment independently depended on the SVA pattern , fetal 
state  and the choice of 1st line therapy . AF [Fig. 1 ] and fetal hydrops [ Fig. 2 ] were independently associated with  
 
Fig. 1.  Freedom from termination of fetal 
SVT vs. AF despite drug treatment (n=111).  
AF responded more slowly to drug therapy than 
SVT (HR=2; p=0.005). Cardioversion at 5 and 
10 days was achieved i n 50% and 63% of 
fetuses with SVT and in 25% and 41% of cases 
with AF.  Fig. 2.  Freedom from termination of fetal SVT 
with and without hydrops (n=75).  Treatment 
failure was also more likely if SVT was associated 
with fetal hydrops (HR=1.8; p=0.04) at the time of 
diagnosis. It took more than twice as long (9 vs. 4 
days) for conversion of 50% of SVT cases to a 
normal rhythm if fetuses were hydropic. 21% of the 
hydropic cases died.

termination rates [ Fig. 3 ] while flecainide or digoxin was superior in terminating SVT [ Fig. 4 ] and in lowering 
tachycardia rates if SVA persisted [ Fig. 5 ].  None of the agents as 2nd line therapy was asso ciated with a greater 
rate of SVA termination although sotalol tended to be superior for AF. Once fetal SVA was converted to sinus 
rhythm, chronic drug therapy to birth with the drug(s) that successfully terminated the SVA was used to prevent 
recurrences. Recurrence of SVT and AF was documented in 8% and 15% of cases during the first month of 
maintenance treatment.1 
 
 
  
 
Fig. 4.  Freedom from termination of fetal SVT 
(n=75): For patients with SVT, in multivariate models 
adjusted for hydrops and SVT pattern, the use of 
flecainide  (HR:  2.9; p=0.01) or digoxin (HR: 2.1; 
p=0.02) as 1st therapy were associated with increased 
likelihood of SVT termination compared to sotalol. The  
median time to conversion of 50% of cases was 3 days 
with digoxin, 4 days with flecainide but 12 days with 
sotal ol. Fig. 3.  Freedom from termination of fetal AF 
(n=36): For patients with AF, in multivariate models 
adjusted for arrhythmia pattern, 1st line sotalol  was 
associated with a greater likelihood of AF termination 
compared with digoxin (HR: 5.4; p=0.05) or flecainide 
(HR: 7.4; p=0.03). Time to conversion of 50% was 12 
days with sotalol, but not achieved with the other drugs 
before delivery.  
Fig. 5. Effects of 1st line treatment on tachycardia 
rates.  When incessant SVT (n=23) or AF (n=22) 
persisted to day 5  of treatment, ventricular rates were 
lowered more with flecainide and digoxin than with 
sotalol  (p<0.001). This suggests that flecainide and 
digoxin are similarly effective in reducing the 
tachycardia to better tolerated rates while sotalol has no 
or only  modest heart rate slowing effects.

outcome of the pregnancy significantly depend on  any of these three variables:  
 The underlying SVA mechanism  (AF vs. SVT)   
 The fetal state  (fetal hydrops  vs. non -hydrops ), and 
 The primary choice of antiarrhythmic therapy  
The optimal choice of therapy at the time of a new SVA diagnosis is of critical importance as it is the only 
variable  that may be  directly influenced by the treating physician ’s decisions . 
While the study by Jaeggi provided  new data on the potentials and limitations of prenatal drug therapy and in 
selecting agents for the FAST Therapy Trial, several limitations inherent to the retrospective study design may 
limit the validity of some study findings. This includes : a) relatively small case numbers due to the relative rarity 
of SVA (111 treated cases; 3 therapy arms); b) differences in disease severity among patient cohorts; and c) 
insufficient data to address AEs and 2nd line therapy. One important study conclusion none theless was that 1st line 
therapy initiation with only one antiarrhythmic is probably safe unless fetal heart failure is present  (21% perinatal 
mortality), leading to this proposal to start with single drug therapy in the absence of hydrops  (RCT Sub-study  A 
and B)  and dual therapy with hydrops  (RCT Sub-study  C). This approach is also supported by latest clinical data 
that showed no mortality with the primary use of digoxin and flecainide in fetal SVT with hydrops.38 
2.6 SAFETY OF TRANSPLACE NTAL THERAPY  There is extensive retrospective data on the safe use of digoxin, 
sotalol, and flecainide, either alone or when used in combinations  for this indication, with the limitation that AEs 
were  most likely inconsistently documented and thus underreported in retrospective studies. Although minor  
drug-related AEs ar e not infrequent patient complaints based on our own retrospective experience1 and drug 
monographs , life-threatening AEs owing to the use o f fetal antiarrhythmic drug therapy in predominantly healthy 
mothers have not been reported.2, 36 However, virtually all antiarrhythmic agents may have the potential to 
provoke new or to exacerbate existing arrhythmias. This  risk increases with toxic drug levels, maternal heart 
disease, ventricular arrhythmia, and hypokalemia .39-41 Previously reported mortality rates of treated fetuses with 
SVA without  hydrops were between 0% and 5%, whereas about 20% of fetuse s with SVA with hydrops had died, 
usually due to treatment -resistant SVA.2, 5 In our large experience, we never observed unexpected SAEs, 
irrespective whether single or multiple drug therapy was used.1 
To minimize risks of SAE s a) only mothers without serious health and pregnancy concerns other than fetal  SVA 
are eligible for participation in the RCTs (see Section 7.2); b) the primary physician and pa rticipant  both are 
informed about the assigned drug therapy from the time of randomization to study end (open label trial); c) drug 
dosages will be used that are considered to be safe and effective (see 7.6), thus avoiding toxic levels (digoxin) and 
excessive QTc prolongation >0.5 (sotalol); and d) initiation of therapy is recommended in -hospital to monitor 
maternal/fetal heart rates and wellbeing, followed by serial outpatient encounter once arrhythmia control is 
achieved (see 7.7).

3.1 SURVEYS . To determine  feasibility  of the FAST Therapy Trial , we conducted two large surveys.  
In Survey I , of which 87 tertiary maternal -fetal (47%) and fetal cardiology (61%) sites replied, we determined:   
a) caregivers responsible for the management of fetal SVA at each site; b) avera ge number s of treated cases/year 
and site; c) the willingness to participate in a prospective RCT (94% support) and/or a prospective registry (90% 
support ); d) current 1st line drug choices [ Fig. 6 ] and e) drug preferences f or hypothetical RCTs  [Fig. 7 ]. 
In Survey II , we obtained (89 potential study sites , 23 countries ): a) numbers of treated SVA cases based on 
institutional reviews of 2011 -2012 [Fig. 8 ], b) expected maternal consent/recruitment rates at each center (mean: 
81%), and assessed c) participation rates in the AF/no hydrops RCT (n=75; 86%), SVT/no hydrops RCT (n=76; 
87%), SVT/hydrops RCT (n=78; 90%), and/or the registry (n=69; 79%) . Of 87 centers  willing to participate in at 
least one RCT, three RCTs were elected by 66 (76%), 2 RCTs by 12 (14%), and  1 RCT by 7 (8%) centers. We 
also obtained >80 letters of collaboration from major fetal -maternal centers that wish to participate in the FAST 
Therapy Trial, incl.  10 Canadian sites. All study goals are achievable within <5 years with <50 average sized 
centers.  
Fig. 6.  Current 1st line drug choices (Survey I; n=87)    
Digoxin was most commonly quoted as 1st choice agent to 
treat SVT and AF without hydrops. If there was fetal 
hydrops, flecainide for SVT and sotalol for AF were 
slightly preferred over digoxin. Less than 20% currently 
use 1st line therapy with more than one agent to treat 
SVA/hydrops despite the slow cardioversion r ates to drug 
monotherapy (Fig. 2 ) and the high risk of adverse 
outcome.  
 
 
 
 
Fig. 7. Elected  1st line drug comparisons  in potential 2 -
arms RCTs (Survey I; n=81)   
 SVT without  hydrops : digoxin vs. flecainide  
 AF without  hydrops : digoxin vs. sotalol  
 SVT or AF  with hydrops : digoxin plus flecainide vs.     
    digoxin plus sotalol .  
Potential 2 -arm comparisons selected in the survey are in 
agreement with the study results of Jaeggi  et al1, 
eliminating the agent that was associated with the weakest 
cardioversion rate for SVT (sotalol) and AF (flecainide) 
in the comparisons (Fig. 3 -4)

3.2 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULAT IONS . Based on our survey results and the retrospective study by Jaeggi et al, we 
expect 70% of SVA cases to be SVT (50% no hydrops; 20% hydrops) and 30% AF (25% no hydrops; 5% 
hydrops).1 Survey II suggests that an average of 2.3 SVT/no hydrops, 1.21 AF/no hydrops and 1.03 treated 
SVT/hydrops cases/year/center will be eligible for RCT enrolment, with average consent rates of 81%. Sample 
size calculation for 2 -arm treatment comparisons was performed using PASS (Power and Sample Size) v12 
(NCSS, LLC, Kaysville, Utah, USA). To calculate sample size requirements for this study we expected the 
proporti on of patients with normal pri mary outcome to be 55% with SVT without hydrops, 30% with AF without 
hydrops, and 30% of SVT with hydrops with the inferior treatment arm (i.e. the null hypothesis). We aim to detect 
an improvement of +20% in the proportion of  patients with a normal primary outcome with the super ior RCT arm 
(i.e. 75% for SVT without hydrops; 50% for AF without hydrops and SVT with hydrops; i.e. the alternative 
hypothesis). The test statistic used is the two -sided Likelihood Ratio test which is equivalent to the Wald chi -
square for logistic regression models which will be used to analyze our primary outcome. The significance level 
of the test of significance was targeted at 0.05, with a power of 80%. Assuming those  metrics, we will need  550 
RCT participants , with a minimum number of patients in each of the three RCTs of:  
AF without hydrops  (RCT A) :  186 (93/arm) treated cases ← 232 approached cases with 80% consent rate  
SVT without  hydrops  (RCT B) : 178 (89/arm) treated cases ← 222 approached cases with 80% consent rate  
SVT with hydrops  (RCT C) :    186 (93/arm) treated cases ← 232 approached cases with 80% consent rate  
 
With 50 average sized sites , we anticipate 225 treated patients/year (mean: 4.5) to be approached during the study 
period which should be sufficient to recruit the required number of patients with SVT without  hydrops (RCT B) in 
1.9 years, AF without  hydrops (RCT A) in 3.8 years and SVT without hydrops (RCT C) in 4.4 years.  In contrast, 
we do not expect suf ficient cases for a separate AF with hydrops  RCT (0.27 cases/year and site). Study completion 
<5 years would require a minimum of 20 average sized centers in RCT B (4.7 years), 40 c enters in RCT  A (4.7 
years), and 45 centers in RCT C  (4.9 years).  The site investigator will be responsible for recruiting participants 
and conducting the study at the participating center. There is no data on consent rates for a prospective fetal SVA 
trial. Survey II suggests average consent rates of 81%. Consent rates are available from other fetal -maternal 
RCTs. Despite the more invasive nature of these studies, consent was obtained in 71.4% of eligible mothers to 
study the impact of serial amnioreductio n vs. selective fetoscopic laser photocoagulation to treat fetal twin -twin

25% and 20% of SVA cases. Sample size c alculations 
(2.11) are based on data of “qualified centers.” No 
AF/hydrops RCT is planned (5% of SVA cases).

myelomengocele;43 and in 86% of mothers to study the impact of fetal endoscopic tracheal occlusion with 
standard postnatal care for congenital diaphragmatic hernia.44 As we will not compare experimental but standard 
therapy, we would expect equal or higher maternal co nsent rates.      
IN SUMMARY , most sites contacted in our Surveys agree d that there is a need for prospective studies, and would be 
willing to participate  in sufficient numbers to complete all components  of the FAST Therapy Trial with <5 years . 
Other research colla borations already exist with and among many potential study sites (e.g. TTTS laser 
interventions; PIAF study; Fetal Intervention Registries; retrospective mu lti-institutional collaborations (SVA, 
CHB, Ebstein, etc.). Potential 2 -arm comparisons [ Fig. 7 ] are in agreement with our previous study  findings1 that 
suggested better results with 1st line flecainide or digoxin for SVT  [Fig. 4 ] and with sotalol for AF  [Fig. 3 ]. Health 
Canada has issued letters of no objection  for the RCTs.  
 
4.  STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 TRIAL C OMPONENTS . The FAST Therapy T rial is a prospective trial of patients with a new diagnosis of fetal 
SVA. The study aims to compare the impact of different perinatal treatment strategies from the time of SVA 
diagnosis to 30 days after birth  or death. Research components as shown in Figu re 9 include : 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.2 RANDOMIZED TRIAL . (See 7  for conduct details ). The FAST  RCT Sub-studies  A, B and C are open label 
phase III  trials of standard 1st line therapy, which either is started as monotherapy (no hydrops) or as dual therapy 
(hydrops).  To participate as a patient in an RCT  sub-study , all maternal and fetal inclusion  criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria must be fulfilled (see below). D ifferentiation between “AF vs. SVT” and “hydrops vs. non -
hydrops” is required  for randomization into the appropri ate sub -study  (Fig. 9) . The site investigator will be 
responsible for diagnosis , eligibility assessment and randomization  in the appropriate RCT arm.  Each participant 
will be assigned a unique study identifier to protect privacy and to be used for communic ation with the site 
investigator.  The Echo Core Lab at SickKids will review  as soon as possible, but not prior to randomization or 
treatment initiation , all uploaded baseline data and will ensure d iagnostic accuracy by  review ing de-identified  Three prospective RCT sub -studies  to determine the 
efficacy and safety of specific transplacental drug 
regimens in suppressing: A) fetal AF without  hydrops 
(RCT A); B) SVT without  hydrops (RCT B); and C) 
SVT with hydrops (RCT C).  
  
A prosp ective observational cohort study (FAST Registry)  
to document the outcome of patients because randomization 
is not offered o r not possible, non -study 1st line medication 
is used, or observation without treatment is elected  (REB 
Number#  1000048953).

started on 1st line therapy, t he treating physician  will at any time be free to modify and/or change treatment  for the 
remainder of gestation . Patient care maps for the different treatment arms are provided that may help and be used 
to guide most perinatal management decisions to birth . Maternal questionnaire and , if applicable,  case report 
forms (CRFs) will be used  to assess for maternal and fetal AEs  and specified outcomes (5.2.1)  at each participant  
encounter .  
With  50 centers and 80% consent rates per RCT, actual study periods are expected to take 1.9 years ( RCT B: SVT 
without  hydrops ), 3.8 years ( RCT A: AF without  hydrops ), and 4.4 years ( RCT C:  SVT with hydrops ), 
respectively. This will allow postnatal follow-up to a minimum of 30 days after birth  of all study participants.  
Recruitment for the RCT sub -studies will be competitive and once a predetermined number of participant s are 
enrolled, new patients will be considered for the registry only.  
4.3 REGISTRY . Registry data will be used to determine the outcome of the non -randomized  (treated),  and 
untreated SVA study population to examine the impact and outcome of alternative treatment approaches.  This 
includes fetal AF with hydrops , which is not studied by a separate RCT due to the rarity of the association . 
4.4 STUDY WITHDRAWAL . A subject is free to withdraw from participation in the trial at any time, for any 
reason, specified or unspecified, and without prejudice. The reason for the subject’s withdrawal from the study (if 
given) will be documented in the Study Completion/Exit F orm.  If the subject withdraws, data that has already 
been coll ected up to that point in time will be kept (as indicated in the patient informed consent).  
4.5 PARTICIPANT  REPLACEMENT . Study p articipants withdraw ing from  the trial will be replaced 1:1 to obtain 
the target number of evaluable participants per RCT arm.   
4.6 NONPARTICIPAT ION. If an eligible  patient has been approached for the RCT  but elects to not participate  the 
screening information  should still be documented in REDCap, including the patient’s decision to not participate. 
Collection of basic screening information by the sponsor is important as it will allow an analysis of pati ent 
willingness to participate , of excluded cases and an estimation of the number of total SVA cases. Moreo ver, 
information on the rate of non -participation will be essential for future publications.   
5.  STUDY SAFETY  
5.1 SAFETY PROCEDURES . The FAST RCTs  will assess standard prenatal treatment  that has been used for 
decades because the fetus suffers from a life -threatening yet treatable cardiac condition and other management  
options including direct treatment or  premature delivery  are considered more invasive, more harmful , or both . 
Perinatal d emise is not an unusual outcome of hydropic fetuses with SVA, irrespective of the choice of treatment .  
Health Canada , FDA  (US)  and MHRA  (UK) have  approved all three  RCT  sub-studies . There is extensive data on 
the safe u se of the study agents for this indication. Minor drug -related maternal AEs are not infrequent 
[monographs ],1 but maternal SAEs owing to fetal antiarrhythmic drug therapy have not been reported.2, 36 
However, virtually all antiarrhythmics have proarrhythmic potentials  to provoke new or exacerbate existing

and hypokalemia .  
Procedures for study participants to minimize the risk of SAEs include:  
 only mothers without serious health and pregnancy concerns other than fetal SVA are el igible for 
participation in RCT  sub-studies  (see 7);  
 the primary physician and pa rticipant  both are informed about the assigned drug therapy from the time of 
randomizati on to study end (open label trial);  
 drug dosages will be used that are considered to be safe and effective, thus avoiding toxic levels (digoxin) 
and excessive QTc prolongation >0.5 (sotalol);  d) concomitant medication (7.6.2) that  may interact with a 
study drug are not to be used or, if no alternative exists, used with caution during the trial;  and  
 initiation of therapy is recommended in -hospital to monitor maternal/fetal heart rates and wellbeing, 
followed by serial outpatient  encounter once arrhythm ia control is achieved.   
5.2 ADVERSE EVENT  ASSESSMENT  AND DOCUMENTATION . A main objective of FAST  RCTs  is patient safety. 
This is accomplished by the systematic recording of AEs.  
Adverse Event (AE) : is defined as any untoward medical occurrence of a symp tom that may or may not  
have a causal relationship with the treatment used.  Examples include a rash noted during a physica l exam, 
abnormal lab results, or a change from a baseline condition.  
Failure of the drug does not constitute an AE. Sources of information will include observation (physical exam; 
ECG; echo; lab result), patient statement, patient charts, and serial assessment at each encounter by questionnaire 
for changes from baseline (↑ severity/frequency of pre -existing symptom(s)) or new AEs ).  
It will be the responsibility of the primary physician to identify , and to classify the seriousness, severity , causality 
and expectedness of an AE  as follow s:  
a) Assessment if event qualifies as serious : 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) : A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death,  
 Is life -threatening , 
 Requires inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity   
 Results in congenital ab normalities or birth defect  
Other events may be treated as SAEs if the Principal Investigator considers it to be an important medical event 
that may jeopardize the participant or require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above .

Mild  Events are considered MILD if s igns/symptoms are mild, clinical relevance is marginal, 
laboratory findings are asymptomatic and  no specific medical intervention is required.   
Moderate  Events are considered MODERATE if they r equir e minimal, local, or non -invasive 
intervention only . 
Severe Events are considered SEVERE if they  interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities 
and generally require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually 
incapacitating.  
 
c) Causa lity assessment : 
Definitely related  There is a certainty that the event is related to the study drug(s).  
Probably related  There is high likelihood that the event is related to the study drug(s).  
Possibly related  There is a likelihood that the study drug (s) is the cause of the event, but other causes 
cannot be ruled out.  
Unlikely related  It is not likely that the event is related to the study drug(s), and other more likely causes 
are present.  
Unrelated   Evidence exists that the event is related to something other than a study drug.  
 
d) Expectedness assessment : 
An event is considered unexpected if the nature, severity or frequency is not  consistent with the risk 
information listed in the Product Monograp h. 
Pregnancy - and treatment -related AEs will be documented by the site investigator. Prior  to the start of drug 
therapy ( pretreatment forms ), a thorough medical history should be obtained to document all preexisting maternal 
symptoms, complaints and health  concerns.  As many pregnancy related symptoms are intermittent in nature, a 
thorough history including variations in severity and frequency should be taken. AEs should be reassessed at each 
participant  encounter. If signs or symptoms remain similar to base line or are less in severity, frequency, or both, 
they will be considered within the usual range and do not need to be documented as AEs. In contrast, signs and 
symptoms that are new or, if preexisting, are more frequent/severe, need to be documented, asse ssed for severity 
and causality, and followed up until resolution.

 the Sponsor  
  According t o Institutional guidelines  
 
The Sponsor will work with the National Coordinating centers in each regulatory jurisdiction to report events as 
required to the appropriate regulatory authority.  
5.4 EARLY STOPPING RULE . All three RCT  sub-studies , individually or as a group, can be temporarily stopped 
for safety reasons at any tim e, at the discretion of the Data &  Safety Monitoring Board [DSMB  Charter ; also see 
6.4]. An RCT can be stopped for benefit at the time of an interim analysis if results unequivocally favor on e 
treatment arm over the other at the p<0.001 level . If one is demonstrably superior to the other, it would be 
unethical to continue the sub -study as is. Stopping of the study for benefit will be decided based on discussions of 
the DSMB with the study PI and the Trial Steering Committee.  
6.  STUDY MANAGEMENT & RESPONSIBILITIES  
6.1 MEDICAL  OVERSIGHT Medic al oversight ) of participant s at each study site will be the responsibility of the 
PI at each centre. Procedures for medical oversight must be implemented at each site  and responsibilities in care 
and assessments delegated to appropriately trained staff . Documentation  of this oversight  must be maintained for 
the length of the trial  (as required by your institution and regulatory authority) .  
6.2 TRIAL OVERSIGHT  will be maintained by the Sponsor -Investigator , Edgar Jaeggi .1, 2, 7, 9, 23, 36, 45 -52. He and his 
team of physicians and trial support staff will oversee the conduct of the study .

redcap.org ) will be used to enter de -identified patient data by the participating sites . Credentialing to access 
REDCap will be managed centrally by the FAST Trial study team in cooperation with the Cardiovascular Data 
Management Centre (CVDMC) . Individual access wi ll be limited to data from individual sites. The system is 
deployed through a secured/encrypted server hosted at SickKids  and will be  managed by an experienced Clinical 
Research Project Manager (statistician and database manager) from the CV DMC . REDCap is available anytime, 
anywhere in the world, is completely automated and will allow new patient input and randomization 
instantaneously once a center becomes eligible to participate in the FAST Therapy Trial; thereafter all required 
CRFs (incl. patient charac teristics, treatment information, outcomes) will be available with basic data validation at 
the time of data entry (physiological range, validation of time interval, pre -determined coding, required fields, 
etc.). Regular updates of key findings will be req uested from the site investigator up to 1 month of life. Once 
completed, pa rticipant  data will be verified for completeness and validity by the FAST Trial team , and any 
queries will be sent to the site investigator. Once the record is deemed complete/valid , it will be locked so that 
further edits will not be possible to ensure highest data quality.  
6.4 DATA & SAFETY MONITORING BO ARD  (DSMB ). An independent DSMB of 4 members will monitor the 
progress of the RCT  sub-studies  and review the safety data  [DSMB Charter  of the Randomized Clinical Sub -
trials ]. The DSMB will review the result of interim analyses and other safety data and, if required, will provide 
recommenda tions to the study sponsor  including to stop the trial if there are safety concerns .  
6.5 STEERING COMMITTEE MEMB ERS. The clinical research aspect of this study  has been developed and will be 
conducted under the supervision of a highly experienced multidisciplinary team of experts in the field who 
collectively have published >1,300 refereed papers , incl. 45 on fetal tachyarrhythmia and >50 RCTs. The 
committee includes  the PI, Edgar  Jaeggi , and 10 co -investigators who initiated /designed the F AST Therapy Trial, 
including this  Protocol and the Care Maps. Members include: Brian McCrindle,  Director of t he Cardiovascular 
Clinical Research Unit  at SickKids Heart Center; Martin Offringa, Head of the Child Health Evaluative Science 
Program at SickKids with a vast experience in the design, conductance and reporting of evidence -based clinical 
trials in childre n; Nico Blom, Phil J Saul, Julene Carvalho, Bettina Cuneo, Anita Moon -Grady, Ulrich Gembruch 
and Greg Ryan , who are leading experts in electrophysiology, cardiology and maternal -fetal medicine, 
respectively, and last but not least, Ed Kelly  who directs a large Neonatal Follow -up Clinic. Members of the 
Steering Committee may be consulted if there is disagreement between a study site and the Echo Core Lab 
regarding a fetal diagnosis. The c ommittee will assist in interpretation of study outcome  data and with the 
development of practice guidelines and interdisciplinary knowledge transfer. The committee will communicate 
via e -mail and have intermittent conference calls to discuss study issues. Annual meetings are planned to discuss 
study progress and any relevant issues. These meetings may also include national and site investigators . 
6.6 NATIONAL COORDINATOR S. In countries with larger nu mbers of participating centers investigators have 
been identified to function as National Coordinators . Their ro le will be to assist the FAST Trial Team by 
providing regional oversight and support for running of the RCTs . Responsibilities of National Coordinating 
Centers may include help with obtaining ethical approval, applications/ reporting to the local regulatory  authorities

1) are to occur on the same day if there is an immediate need of fetal treatment.  
7.1  PATIENT IDENTIFICATI ON. The site investigator will be responsible for identifying and recruiting RCT 
participants and conducting th e study at the participating center. The invest igator will inform a patient who fulfills 
eligibility criteria about the study early on with the help of a Patient Brochure .  
Study Logs for screening and enrolment are to be kept securely at sites with access only to FAST study team 
members.  These Logs will be  de-identified prior to inspections and audits or if requested by the Sponsor for 
monitoring purposes. De -identification is also necessary before being sent to the Sponsor at end of study.  
A Screening Log  of all patients screened should be kept with  the following information : screening date, patient 
name, institutional number, confirmation of sub -study screened for, eligibility status, enrolment status and a 
reason if not enrolled.  
Once pati ents have consented to participate in the study, screened for eligibility and are enrolled into the study, 
their information should be entered into an  Enrolment Log  with the following information : participant’s  name, 
study ID number , institutional number, da te and time of enrolment, study enrolled in, as well as an indication if 
and why a participant has withdrawn. Once a baby is born to a mother in the study, sites will need to keep a Child 
Enrolment  Log with the child’s name and institutional number, as wel l as the mother’s corresponding study ID 
number.  
7.2 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA .  Subjects are eligible for participation in an RCT sub -study if they  meet ALL of the 
following inclusion criteria and NONE of the exclusion criteria . All subjects will be screened by Investigators for 
study eligibility prior to randomization  and enro lment .

7.3 INFORMED CONSENT (IC) The consent process at each site will be performed as approved by local REB  or as 
per institutional p ractices . The study is explained to the patient in detail , including the alternatives (registry, non -
participation)  and any questions are answered prior to signing the consent form. The person obtaining consent 
must co-sign the form with date and time. A copy of th e consent form must be given to the patient.  
7.4 PATIENT DATA  ENTRY .  Completion  of the enrol ment and randomization process requires submission of  the 
following baseline information into the patient’ s electronic REDCap form  prior  to any treatment:   
 Name  and center of the site investigator , incl. conta ct information   
 SVA: date/gestational age at diagnosis, mechanism, pattern, rate and AV relationship  
 Fetal state : presence/ location of effusion(s), skin edema, and fetal movements  
 Confirmation of enrol ment in to prospective randomized trial and selection of the sub -study  
 Checklist  of eligibility criteria for participation  
Following randomization and treatment intita tion, s ites m ust upload de-identified images  to REDCap  that 
document the pretreatment fetal arrhy thmia mechanism and health state  (M-mode and/or Doppler still images , 2-
dimensional images of the fetal abdomen /chest for proof of hydrops)  and maternal 12-lead ECG  for review by the 
Sponsor  Echo Core Lab. M oving clips confirming the fetal SVA mechanism  should also be sent via secure file 
transfer  for review by the FAST Trial Echo Core Lab. If de-identification is not possible at the site , an 
arrangement c an be m ade with the Sponsor to have  images and clips sent via secure file transfer for de-
identifica tion prior to storage.

the randomization into the appropriate sub -study. SickKids will function as the Echo Core Lab Facility to review 
patient diagnosis and fetal state to determine if  the initiated drug therapy is appropriate . The Core Lab provides 
support to ensure accurate diagnosis and classification and if requested will provide a review of findings within 48 
hours . Other  Core Lab physicians or steering committee members will arbitrate if there is no agreement in 
diagnosis with the site investigator . This approach will avoid inaccuracies  in diagnosis and study results.  
7.6 RANDOMIZATION TO  FIRST LINE THERAPY . An individual ID code is assigned  by REDCap  at first data entry 
to protect patient privacy. Once  participant  screening, eligibility data , and confirmation of consent data has been 
entered into REDCap, they will be asked to confirm diagnosis  and then be allowed to randomize to a drug 
assig nment in the selected treatment arm.   
Participants will be randomiz ed into one of two possible 1st line therapy arms, which either will be started as 
monotherapy ( AF or SVT without hydrop s) or as dual therapy ( SVT with hydrops) . First line drug therapy is pre-
defined including the initial  dose and mode of administration :

Initiate above Digoxin treatment in combination with oral Sotalol  160 mg BID (320 mg/day).  
 
IV DIGOXIN : additional recommendations  
For RCT A, B or C Digoxin can be  administered as oral tablets or IV. For IV the Digoxin Injection can be 
administered undiluted or diluted with a 4 -fold or greater volume of 0.9% NaCl injection, or 5% Dextrose 
Injection. The use of less than a 4 -fold volume of diluent could lead to preci pitation of the digoxin. 
Immediate use of the diluted product is recommended. Slow infusion of digoxin over a period of 5 
minutes or longer is preferable to bolus administration. Rapid infusion of digitalis glycosides has been 
shown to cause systemic and c oronary arteriolar constriction, which may be clinically undesirable. 
Mixing of intravenous digoxin with other drugs in the same container or simultaneous administration in 
the same intravenous line is not recommended.  
7.6.1  CONCOMITANT MEDICATI ONS  
Medication to be avoided d uring trial participat ion or, if no alternative exists , used with caution  and appropriate 
monitoring of the QTc, include medications that prolong QT and/or increase risk for Torsades de Pointes (TDP) 
(List available online at:  https://crediblemeds.org/healthcare -providers/ ). Concomitant medication use of 
pentamidine is to be avoided and additional anti -arrhythmics to be used with caution.  See relevant drug 
monographs f or detailed information on precautions  and possible drug interactions .  
7.7   STUDY CONDUCT    
PATIENT CARE . The treating physician will be responsible for the medical care of enrolled participant s and 
medical oversight will be the responsibility of the local PI . The type and frequency of standard clinical care 
patient  assessments , should not differ from a non -study participant with the same clinical findings . The medical 
management of study participants should also not differ from a non -study patient wit h comparable clinical 
findings. This includes , in agreement with accepted management guidelines53,  the recommendation  to commence 
1st line treatment as well as any significant changes in drug therapy in -hospital to allow close monitoring of the 
fetal-maternal treatment effects and well -being by ECG, echocardiograms, digoxin level, and biophysical profile, 
until fetal cardioversion or heart rate control is achieved. After discharge from hospital, s erial fetal heart rate 
monitoring to birth by the physician (usually by weekly fetal echocardiograms) and the mother (by daily Doppler 
monitoring at home) is recommended  to detect SVA recurrences and to allow treatment adjustments, as required.  
What will differ from standard procedures  is the requirement to assess  and document AEs, including whether the 
event is serious , the severity , causality  and expectedness of the event , as well as  to follow -up on and document  the 
outcome . The sponsor PI (Dr. Edgar Jaeggi and his team) will assume the role of Medical Monitor /Advisor  and 
should be contacted for questions regarding the study and  patient safety ( e-mail: FAST.Trial@sickkids.ca ).  
TREATMENT.  All management d ecisions after initiation of  the first-line treatment will be  at the discretion of the 
primary physician.  This means that the responsible physician is at any time free to adjust the dosage of 1st line 
medication , to add or switch to a 2nd line agent, or to deliver a fetus  based on his/her own clinical judgment . It is

thera peutic fetal drug levels  with transplacental medication . A premature change to 2nd line therapy prior to 3 -7 
days of therapy is therefore not advised unless t here is significant worsening of  the fetal state (e.g. new hydrops) , 
the SVA pattern (>20% increase in SVA rates and duration) , or both . Members of the FAST Trial steering 
committe e have developed consensus -based recommendations  [Care Maps] to adjust the prenatal 
pharmaco therapy to the most common treatment outcomes and clinical scenarios , e.g. if 1st, 2nd or 3rd line 
treatment appears ineffective . Care Map  recommendations may include: a) no change in therapy (sinus rhythm; ↓ 
SVA <10% of time); b) escalation of drug dose (some S VA response); or c) addition of or change to different 
medication (no SVA response). The responsible physician is free to follow the recommendations or to elect 
treatment that differs from the Care Map.  Cross over  to a different medication , fetal demise, preterm delivery , and 
SVA that persists to birth will be considered as 1st line treatment failure . Removal of an agent from treatment 
following sustained conversion to a normal rhythm  (treatment success) does not constitute treatment failure.  
Following sustained conversion to a normal rhythm of at least 24 hours ( acute 1st line treatment success ), it is 
recommended to not change the successful treatment until birth if the treatment is tolerated  and the SVA does not 
recur . Any new documentation of fetal SVA on maintenance therapy that is confirmed by fetal echocardiography  
or by heart rate monitorin g during labor  will be considered as maintenance treatment failure . Near -complete 
suppression of SVA does usually not require a change in maintenance therapy. Maternal drug therapy will be 
maintained until time of delivery and discontinued immediately ther eafter. The choice of postnatal neonatal drug 
therapy  will be at the discretion o f the primary physician. Postnatal  outcomes will be assessed to a minimum of 1 
month of age.  
7.8  PROCEDURES OUTSIDE O F STANDARD CARE . The conduct of the RCT  sub-studies  requires procedures that 
are not part of usual patient management and documentation of findings . This  include s:  
 The process of randomization to 1st line therapy   
 The mode of supply and d ispensation of 1st line medication   
 Home fetal heart rate monitoring  (FHRM) offered to  participants  
 The documentation of de-identified study  results in CRFs and REDCap  
 Participant  questionnaires ( AEs and fetal heart rate monitor),  medication  diary, fetal heart rate monitoring log  
 AE assessment and reporting  
 Adherence rate to treatment assessment   
DATA  DOCUMENTATION : The table of events summarizes the study conduct and procedures  
PRENATAL . Following randomization and treatment intita tion, s ites m ust upload de-identified images  to 
REDCap  of pre -treatment M -mode and/or Doppler still images , 2-dimensional images of the fetal abdomen, and 
12-lead maternal ECG for review and confirmation of diagnosis by the FAST Trial Echo Core Lab. Moving clips 
confirming the fetal SVA mechanism  should be sent via secure file transfer for  Echo  Core Lab review .   
Following treatment initiation , it will be  possible to document the result of up to 25 prenatal pa rticipant  
encounters in REDCap (from day 1 of  treatment to birth or death ). Pre-natal pa rticipant  encounters during

DRUG  SUPPLY.   In accordance with institutional and national regulations, 1st line medication to birth or 
treatment failure will be supplied as specified in site agreements and dispersed as agreed with the pharmacy  and in 
adherence with national regulatory guidelines . There may be bri ef periods of time when 1st line medication will be 
dispensed from an alternative clinical supply such as during labour and delivery. If this occurs it will be 
documented but not r ecorded as a protocol deviation, however  attempt s should be made to obtain i nformation 
regarding the lot number and manufacturer. All responsibility for study medication, packaging and labeling is 
delegated to the Site Investigator as outlined in the Study Agreement. As this is a study of 1st line treatment 
only,once the pa rticipa nt changes therapy to  second line medication  the medication will be supplied from clinical 
supply and documentation of accountability will no longer be applicable.  
ACCOUNTABLITY.   An accurate and current accounting of the dispensing and return of study drug for each 
subject will be maintained on an ongoing basis by an Investigational P roduct  Accountability L og kept by the Site 
Investigator.  The amount  of study drug dispensed and re turned b y the subject will be recorded i n this  log.  The 
responsibility of keeping records of drug accountability will be delegated to the study site . This Accountability 
Log is only required for 1st line study medication for the RCTs.  
COMPLIANCE AND ADHER ENCE.  Most mothers with fetal SVA understand the importance of regular drug 
intake to improve the chances of a normal pregnancy outcome and non -compliance is highly unusual. 
None theless, participant  compliance should  be assessed at each visit ( for 1st line study medication ) by inspecting 
the medication remaining since last dispensing.  Adherence rate to treatment since last visit will be calculated as 
percentage of the prescribed medication that has been taken by the pa rticipant  since last encounter.  In the event 
that the mother is admitted to hospital and is administered treatment drugs from the hospital pharmacy and not 
from her personal study medication, self-reporting of dosage will be taken into  accou nt when determining 
adherence. Non-compliance may be  suspected if the adhere nce rate is <80%, is self -reported , digoxin level tests 
turn out too low or is negative, among others.   
 
7.9   RCT CENTERS & DURATION . Requirements of a study site to be considered eligible to participate in the FAST 
Therapy RCT include :  
 The centre  provide s the primary care of RCT participants from the time of SVA diagnosis to birth  or death.   
 Neonatal and maternal outcomes t o 30 days  after birth  is ascertained . 
 The site investigator/site  have the experience , the commitment , and the infrastructure to successfully conduct 
this research .  
 REB approval has been  obtained including,  if applicable, for affiliated institutions.  
 Regulatory approval has been  obtained by the study site or , if applicable, the  national  coordinating center .  
 Contracts (data share, legal and financial agreements)  have been finalized .          
With an anticipated  50 average sized centers and 80% consent rates per RCT, actual study periods are expected to 
take 1.9 years (SVT without hydrops), 3.8 years (AF  without  hydrops ), and 4.4 years (SVT with hydrops), 
respectively. This will allow follow -up to 30 days after birth  of corrected age of all study participants. Study

4.7 years), 40 centers in the RCT A (AF without  hydrops : 4.7 years) , and 45 centers in RCT C (SVT with 
hydrops : 4.9 years ).  
FOLLOW UP STUDIES.  Participant  outcomes  will be ascertained to 30 days  after birth  or death. T o be able to 
provide participants with information regarding the outcome of the study and to request their participation in 
follow -up studies (for example to determine the neurodevelopmental outcome of survivors beyond 1 month of 
life) we will request the parental  perm ission  for electronic contact information (e -mail) . The information will be 
sent to the sponsor via secure file transfer  and stored securely at SickKids with only study ID number and e -mail 
on the form.   
7.10 OUTCOME MEASURES . Identical outcome measures wi ll be used for RCT and Registry subjects.  We expect 
significant differences in various outcomes among drug regimens based on our preliminary work.1  
PRIMARY OUTCOME   
 Term delivery (≥37 0/7 weeks gestation ) with a normal cardiac rhythm  (ECG) . 
SECONDARY OUTCOME  
 Proportion of pa rticipant s with cardioversion over time  
 Proportion of pa rticipants  with treatment failure  
- Number of participants with treatment failure compared to number of par ticipants with successful treatment. 
Treament failure is defined as one of the following:  
1. cross-over to another drug  
2. SVT/AF that persists to birth  
3. preterm birth  
4. death  
 Cause of death ( prenatal, postnatal ) 
 Proportion of participants with arrhythmia related death  
 Average gestational age at birth  
 Birth weight (z-scores ) 
 Average days of maternal and neonatal hos pitalization related to SVA therapy  
 Maternal prevalence of pregnancy/treatment -related AEs and outcomes  
 Proportion of AEs / adverse outcomes ( prenatal, postnatal ) 
The primary outcome measure is  absolute (term delivery without tachyarrhythmia) with no room for 
interpretation. Secondary outcomes will be the time interval from treatment initiation to the beginning of 
permanent cardioversion, and once established, the freedom from SVA recurrence on maintenance therapy. Only 
the final outcome will be considered to classify cases. Cross -over to another agent, fetal demise, development of 
fetal hydrops, and delivery for SVA will be considered treatment failures. Any recurrence of fetal SVA after

treatment failure.   
7.11  STATISTICAL ANALYSES . All statistical analyses using SAS (SAS Institute, Cary NC) with standard settings 
will be performed by very e xperienced statistician  from the Cardiovascular Data Management Centre  (CVDMC ) 
at SickKids. As a general precept, all 3 RCTs  will be analyzed separately. RCT a nalyses will be performed on an 
intention -to-treat basis , although a separate subgroup analysis w ill be performed. Descriptive statistics for all 
study variables , for each study groups separately , will be created using means with standard deviation, median 
with inter -quartile range , and frequencies as appropriate . Baseline characteristics that should be equally 
distributed between groups th rough randomization ( age at diagnosis, baseline fetal heart rate, incessant vs. 
intermittent SVA , maternal  age) will be assessed in a test of randomization. The test of randomization will be 
performed using Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and Student’s t -test (with Satterthwaite method for 
variance estimat ion) for continuous variables.  
The PRIMARY OU TCOME  (proportion of term deliveries without SV A) will be a binary outcome (yes/no). For 
this type of outcome, the proportion of pa rticipant s in each therapy arm will be compared using logistic regression 
models (PROC LOGISTIC ) with likelihood ratio test t o determine regression model fit, Wald chi -square test from 
maximum likelihood estimates (Fisher’s scoring technique) to determine statistical significance of the therapy arm 
and c -statistic from the regression model’s area under the curve (AUC) to measure  model accuracy. Effect size 
estimate and standard error will be converted into odds ratio with 95% confidence (95% CI) limits to facilitate 
comparisons between the different trials.  
SECONDARY OUTCOME will also be  expressed as binary variables (incl. prop ortions of pa rticipant s: 
requiring 2nd line therapy  and 3rd line therapy; with SVA recurrence on maintenance therapy ; delivery without 
SVA termination ; death <1 month ; etc.) will be assessed between the different therapy arms in the same way as 
the primary  outcome. For outcome s with time dependent variables ( proportion of participant s with cardioversion 
over time ; timing of mortality from initiation of therapy ), Kaplan -Meier survival curves will be used to depict the 
event proportion over time for each group. Single phase parametric hazard regression model (PROC PHREG) will 
be used to compare the 2 therapy arms (with likelihood ratio test to determine regression m odel fit and maximum 
likelihood estimates chi -square to determine statistical significance of the therapy arm. Effect size estimate and 
standard error will be converted into hazard ratio with 95% CI to facilitate comparisons between the different 
trials.  Finally, for outcomes with continuous variables ( average gestational age at birth /birth weight z -score ; 
average days of neonatal hospitalization related to SVA therapy ), linear regression models using maximum 
likelihood estimates for parameter estimation will be used (PROC GENMOD : Akaike's information criterion 
(AIC) criterion to assess regression model fit ; Wald chi -square test from maximum likelihood estimates ). Effect 
size estimate and standard error will determine the difference between the therapy arms in the same original units 
of measurement as the outcome.  
SUB -ANALYSIS will attempt to determine the factors associated w ith successful RCT outcomes. T o accomplish 
this, we will use our primary outcome as the dependent variable. Fetal factors (age at diagn osis) , SVA 
characteristics (heart rate; arrhythmia pattern; SVT subtype s) and treatment metrics (agent(s); dose) will be 
considered as potential independent variables. In a first , all variables will be evaluated separately in univariable

in a bootstrap bagging algorithm (500 random resamples) . Those variables with high reliability (selected in >50% 
of the random resamples) will be included in a  multivariable logistic regression model (PROC LOGISTIC ) with 
likelihood ratio test to determine regression model fit, Wald chi -square test from maximum likelihood estimates 
(Fisher’s scoring technique) to determine statistical significance of the therapy arm and c -statistic from the 
regression model’s area under the curve (AUC) to measure model accuracy with backward selection of variable 
(p<0.05 to enter ) to obtain a final model. Effect size estimate and standard error will be converted into odds ratio 
with 95% CI to facilitate comparisons of effect size between the different covariates. This final model would 
indicate factors associated with greater odds of positive outcome and, providing that analog results are fo und 
between the effects of 1st line therapy between the 2 models (primary RCT analysis as above and sub -analysis).  
FREQUENCY OF ANALYSIS . Pre-specified interim a nalyse s of the 3 strata will be performed separately at 
50% of enrol ment. Each analysis will focus on the primary outcome and safet y report including review of 
between -groups differences and ind ividual review of AEs , other maternal, fetal and infant outcomes,  and other 
safety concerns, if any. All interim analyses will be blinded (with potential un -blinding at the request of the 
DSMB ) as to not influence the final analysis.  
SUBGROUP ANALYSIS . Additional subgroup analyses will includ e comparisons with registry pa rticipant s and 
impact of tachycardia rates : 1) cardioversion rates over time of RCT  participant s with SVT  and AF + hydrops ; 
and 2) tachycardia  rates of ca ses with persistent SVA at ±1 week  of acute therapy  (all arms ).1

  Version Date: July 07 , 2017                                                                                                              the trial sponsor. All identifiable documents will be stored securely by the site investigator and will only be 
accessible by trial staff and authorized  personnel.  
REIMBURSEMENTS  OF SITES  AND  SUBJECTS .  Reimbursement s of the study site and study participant 
are to cover expenses related to the preparation and submission of study documents  to REB and regulatory 
authorities , the 1st line medication , the collection /reporting of participant  data into CRFs and REDCap  and fetal 
heart rate monitors as ag reed to by the sponsor . No other participant  expenditure will be covered as the care 
outlined in this protocol is standard of care for these participant s and will not req uire extra -time or extra -visits 
from the participant s.   
7.13  AGREEMENTS AND POLIC IES 
LEGAL AND FINANCIAL Financial and legal a greements wi ll be made directly between the Trial Sponsor 
(Edgar Jaeggi and The Hospital for Sick Children ) and the Primary Responsible Site I nvestigator (s) and his/her  
Institution (s). In some countries , site agree ments and some responsibilities may be delegated to a National 
Coordinating Site . These Centres will  manage and coordinate  the national  regulatory , and where applicable, the  
research ethics requirements . This may include delegation of certain on -site monitoring responsibilities as 
required, from the sponsor to a National Coordinating Site to the extent required by Health Canada . Whether there 
are requirements for additional monitoring by national regulatory authorities outside Canada will have to be 
further assessed.  Reimbursements will be based on the role of a study site/investigator in the conduct of the trial 
(National Coordinating Center vs. Participating Center ) and the total number of enrolled participant s. 
Reimbursements  will reflect a compromi se between average costs per RCT participant  and the available funds to 
allow us to successfully conduct and complete the FAST Therapy Trial.  The FAST Therapy Trial receives no 
funds from pharmaceutical companies.  
HEART RATE MONITORS . We will be able to reimburse costs of up to 100 heart rate Doppler devices to 
allow fetal heart rate home monitoring of RCT participant s at home  (1-2 devices per site, d epending on expected 
RCT enrol ment rates  of the site ).  
ACCESS TO SOURCE DOCUMENTS .  The sponsor is oblige d to monitor the accuracy and completeness of 
source documents of a portion of the participant s in the trial. To comply with this Health Canada regulation, each 
trial site agree s upon request to provide direct access  to a qualified team member of the study  sponsor to monitor 
source documents and other trial related essential documents.  Source document review  and verification will be 
randomly chosen  but may also be risk-based triggered . Documents may either be faxed to the study  Monitor,  or 
be sent via secure file transfer . These documents will be viewed and then securely deleted or destroyed according 
to SickKids policy  on destruction of confidential  documents .

Dissemination of results will be decided by the PI and Steering Committee. Publication policy for the FAST 
Therapy Trial will be included in the study agreement. It is expected that results of the FAST Therapy Trial will 
be published in several papers by Writing Commi ttees to be determine d by the Committee . Individual a uthorship 
will be based on the investigator’s  contribution to  a study component (RCTs , Registry ; other  outcome studies)  and 
journal guidelines  of authorship . As per the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 
(http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles -and-responsibilities/defining -the-role-of-authors -and-
contributors.html ) authorship will be based on these 4 criteria: a) Substantial contributions to the conception or 
design of the work; or the acquisiti on, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND  b) Drafting the work 
or revising it critically for important intellectual content; AND  c) Final approval of the version to be published; 
AND d) Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the wor k in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy 
or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved . Submission of case materials 
alone does not satisfy the  ICMJE authorship requirement. Study Investigators and Collaborato rs who  have 
significantly contributed but are no t included as author s on a manuscript will be listed under "The FAST Therapy 
Trial Participants" which is a searchable designation in PubMed.

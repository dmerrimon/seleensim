Confidential and Proprietary 6 6 June 2022 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
Study Title:  
A Phase 1, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlle d, Single Ascending Dose Study in Healthy 
Volunteers to Evaluate the Safety, Tolera bility, and Pharmacokinetics of RGLS8429 
Protocol Number: RGLS8429-01 (IND 158708) 
Indication: Treatment of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) 
Study Type: Phase 1, dose range-ranging study in healthy volunteers 
Study Population: Approximately 32 healthy volunteers  
Study Sites:  Phase 1 Clinical Research Unit in the USA 
Sponsor: Regulus Therapeutics Inc. 
Study Drugs:  
RGLS8429 injection will be provided in 2 mL clea r glass vials containing sufficient volume to 
extract the labeled volume of 1 mL of 150mg/mL of RGLS8429 in 0.3% saline.  
Placebo injection will be provided in 2 mL clear glas s vials containing sufficient volume to extract 
the labeled volume of 1 mL of 1.5 μg/mL of riboflavin in 0.9% sodium chloride. 
Both RGLS8429 and placebo solutions are clear and colorless to pale yellow.  
Study Rationale:  
ADPKD is a monogenic systemic disease char acterized by slowly progressive, bilateral 
enlargement of fluid-filled polycystic kidneys wher e increase in total kidney volume occurs long 
before detectable decline of renal function. Fifty percent of ADPKD patients develop end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD) by the age of 60, accounting for 5% of all ESRD patients in the United States 
(US) requiring renal replacement therapy such as dialysis or transplant.  
RGLS8429 is a potent and selective anti-miR-17 oligo nucleotide that dose-dependently inhibits the 
function of miR-17 in kidney cells in vitro and in  animal models of polycystic kidney disease 
(PKD) in vivo. The expression of the miR-17 fa mily of microRNAs has been shown to be 
increased in kidney samples from both mous e ADPKD models and patients with ADPKD. Kidney-
specific knockdown of the miR-17~92 cluster attenu ates disease progression and increases overall 
survival in multiple transgenic  mouse models of PKD and su bcutaneous (SC) dosing with 
RGLS8429 resulted in improvement in two di fferent mouse models of PKD. In the Pkd1F/RC mouse 
model, RGLS8429 significantly reduced kidney weight-to-body weight ratio, serum blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN), kidney cyst index, a nd kidney cyst proliferation. In the Pcy/DBA mouse model, 
RGLS8429 significantly reduced kidney weight-to-bo dy weight ratio, Taken together, these studies 
demonstrate that miR-17 is a promising ther apeutic target for the treatment of ADPKD.

Study Design and Methodology: 
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controll ed Phase 1 study, a single ascending dose of 
RGLS8429 or placebo will be administered via SC inj ection to healthy volunteers to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, and PK of RGLS8429.

Protocol RGLS8429-01 v3.0  Regul us Therapeutics Inc. 
Confidential and Proprietary 8 6 June 2022 Eight subjects will be randomized 3:1 RGLS8429:Pl acebo into each of 4 sequential cohorts (32 
subjects in total).  
Cohort 1  0.5 mg/kg RGLS8429 or placebo 
Cohort 2 1.0 mg/kg RGLS8429 or placebo 
Cohort 3  2.0 mg/kg RGLS8429 or placebo 
Cohort 4 4.0 mg/kg RGLS8429 or placebo 
In each cohort, 6 subjects will be randomized to  receive RGLS8429 and 2 will be randomized to 
receive placebo. Enrollment into subsequent cohorts will be initiate d after review of safety (AEs 
and safety laboratory tests) from the prior cohort. 
For Cohort 1, the first two subjects will receive RGLS8429 or placebo (randomized such that one 
subject receives RGLS8429 and one receives placebo) and this sentinel grou p will be monitored for 
48 hr prior to dosing the rema ining subjects in the cohort. 
An unblinded pharmacist will be responsible fo r preparing RGLS8429 or placebo and providing 
the study drug to blinded study personnel for administration according to the randomization 
procedures.  
Subjects will be admitted to the study center on Da y -1, one day prior to the day of study drug 
administration (Day 1), and will be discharged on Da y 2, no less than 6 hr after the collection of 
the 24-hr PK sample. Subjects will be followed for a total of 4 weeks after dosing and will return to 
the site for follow-up visits weekly from Weeks 1 through 4. The sentinel subjects will remain in 
the clinic for 48 hr after dosing. 
Dose Escalation and Stopping Rules: 
Prior to dose escalation, the Sponsor and the In vestigator will perform a blinded review of the 
safety data (e.g., AE and safety laboratory tests th rough Day 15) for all subjects at the current dose 
level to make a dose escalation decision.

calculated from the date of the last dosing in th e previous study to Day 1 of the current study. 
Statistical Methods: 
Tabular summaries and analysis results will be ge nerated by dose level for RGLS8429 and placebo 
(pooled across all cohorts). Descriptive statistic s by dose level and treatment group will be 
tabulated by visit. 
Sample Size  
Formal sample size calculations were not performe d for this study. The dose cohort size is 8 
subjects randomized 3:1 to RGLS8429 versus placebo. The size of each dose cohort was chosen to 
provide sufficient information to allow assessment of the safety and tolerability of RGLS8429.  
Safety Analysis  
Safety data (e.g., frequencies of treatment-eme rgent adverse events [TEAEs] and SAEs, changes 
from baseline in SARA test scores , safety laboratory test results, vital signs, ECG parameters and 
Holter monitoring) will be summarized descriptiv ely by dose level and treatment group, as 
appropriate. No formal statistical tests will be co nducted to assess the safety or tolerability of 
RGLS8429.  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
PK samples will be analyzed for RGLS8429 concentration using a validated, sensitive, specific 
bioanalytical method. The laboratory analyzing th e PK samples will be unblinded, so PK analysis 
is performed only on subjects re ceiving RGLS8429. Placebo samples will be analyzed if necessary. 
Using non-compartmental methods, the plasma and urine concentration versus time data will be 
used to derive the following PK parameters: C max, Tmax, AUC 0-24, AUC 0-t, AUC inf, t½, CL/F, V z/F, 
fe, and Ae.  
Dose proportionality will be explored using the power model for C max, AUC 0-24, AUC 0-t, and 
AUC inf s data permit. 
Biomarker Analysis 
Descriptive statistics will be used to characteriz e urine (e.g., PC1, PC2, NGAL, KIM-1, MCP-1, 
B2M, and CLU) and serum (e.g., Cystatin -C, IGFALS, Alb, CT-proAVP, N-acetyl-1-
methylhistidine, and others) biomarkers in all subjects .

Confidential and Proprietary 18 6 June 2022  1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Disease Background  
ADPKD, the most common form of polycystic kidney disease (PKD), is  a monogenic systemic disease 
driven mostly by mutations in either PKD1  or PKD2  genes, leading to re duced expression and/or 
function of their encoded-proteins polycystin-1 (PC1) and/or polycysti n-2 (PC2), excessive proliferation 
of the renal tubular ep ithelium and formation of multiple cysts ( Torres, 2009 ; Chapman, 2015 ). Indeed, 
PC1 and PC2 levels in patients’ ur inary exosomes were shown to corr elate inversely w ith the height-
adjusted total kidney volume ( Hogan, 2015 ). ADPKD is characterized by sl owly progressive, bilateral 
enlargement of the fluid-filled pol ycystic kidneys, with kidney volume increasing long before detectable 
decline of kidney function. In addi tion to renal cysts, extrarenal cy sts can also develop in the liver, 
pancreas, seminal vesicles, and arachnoid. Typical symp toms include flank pain, hematuria, proteinuria, 
renal colic, urinary tract infec tion, hypertension, and intracranial aneurysms. Fifty percent of ADPKD 
patients develop end-stage renal disease by the age of 60, accounting for 5% of all end-stage renal 
disease patients in the United States (US) requiri ng renal replacement therapy such as dialysis or 
transplant ( Chebib, 2016 ). 
1.2. miR-17 and ADPKD 
PKD1  and PKD2  genes, which are central to ADPKD pathogenesi s, are both direct target genes of miR-
17 (Patel, 2013 ). Increased miR-17 expression has been de tected in kidney samples from both mouse 
ADPKD models and human ADPKD patients ( Hajarnis, 2017 ). Kidney-specific overexpression of miR-
17~92 repressed Pkd1  and Pkd2  expression and produced kidney cysts in mice ( Patel, 2013 ), whereas 
genetic knockdown of miR-17~92 attenuated disease pr ogression in multiple mouse models of PKD 
(Patel, 2013  and Hajarnis, 2017 ). Importantly, inhibition of miR-17 has been shown to increase PC1 and 
PC2 levels and reduce cyst growth in primary human ADPKD cyst cultures ( Hajarnis, 2017  and Lee, 
2019 ), whereas re-expression of PC1 and PC2 has been  shown to rapidly reve rse total kidney volume, 
cell proliferation, fibrosis, and infl ammation in mouse models of ADPKD ( Dong, 2021 ). Therefore, 
preferential targeting of the mi R-17 family of miRNAs in the kidne y is an attractive therapeutic 
approach to treat ADPKD. 
Nonclinical pharmacology studies using anti-miR-17 oligonucleotid es including the first-generation 
investigational product, RG LS4326, demonstrated that miR-17 inhibiti on confers therapeutic efficacy in 
multiple mouse models of PKD in vivo  and human ADPKD donor prim ary cyst culture samples in vitro  
(Hajarnis, 2017  and Lee, 2019 ). Moreover, miR-17 inhibition has b een shown to improve expression of 
pathogenic gene networks and pathways in PKD, including de-repression of messenger RNA (mRNA) 
of Pkd1  and Pkd2  genes in mouse models of ADPKD. The coordinated alterati on of the polycystic 
kidney transcriptome towards a normal kidney profile following miR -17 inhibition exemplifies the 
potential of an anti-miR-17 oligonucleotide as a disease-mo difying treatment for ADPKD ( Lee, 2019 ). 
Importantly, recent data from the fi rst cohort of a Phase 1b clinical  trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) demonstrated 
clinical evidence that trea tment with RGLS4326 increased urinary PC1 and PC2 level ( Lee, 2021 ) in 
RGLS8429 
Protocol RGLS8429-01 v3.0  Regulus Therapeutics Inc. 
Confidential and Proprietary 19 6 June 2022  patients with ADPKD, likely throug h inhibition of miR-17 in the ki dney. These results imply ongoing 
cis-repression of PC1 and PC2 by the overexpressed  miR-17 in ADPKD patients prior to treatment with 
anti-miR-17, further vali dating miR-17 as a therapeutic target for ADPKD. 
1.3. Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics , Pharmacology, and Toxicology 
The following is a brief summary of the Nonclinical information. Please see the RGLS8429 
Investigator’s Brochure for a more detail ed presentation of this information.  
In nonclinical ADPKD efficacy studies, RGLS8429 tr eatment reduced disease progression in both 
Pkd1F/RC and Pcy/DBA mouse models. In the Pkd1F/RC mouse model, RGLS8429 caused a significant 
reduction in kidney weight -to-body weight ratio, serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), kidney cyst index, 
and kidney cyst proliferation. In the Pcy/DBA mouse model, RGLS8429 re duced kidney weight-to-body 
weight ratio significantly. In a ddition, the combination of RGLS 8429 and tolvaptan demonstrated a 
greater reduction in disease progres sion than either drug alone in the  Pcy/DBA mouse model. 
Based on in silico bioinformatics analysis and in vitro receptor binding studies, RGLS8429 appears to 
have low potential for off-targe t effects towards ribonucleic acid  (RNA) and receptor targets. 
RGLS8429 had no effects on cardiovas cular, respiratory, and central  nervous system function at 
supraclinical concentrations a nd dose levels in animals. RGLS8429 had no meaningful effect on the 
human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hER G) potassium channels in vitro. 
In nonclinical PK and toxicokine tic studies, SC administration of  RGLS8429 demonstrated rapid 
absorption (time to maximum concentration [T max] 1-2 hr) followed by relatively rapid plasma clearance.  
The plasma t 1/2 in mice (~ 2 hr) whereas t 1/2 ranged between 6 -7 hr in monkeys. 
Plasma exposure increased in a generally dose -proportional manner across all dose levels, and no 
meaningful accumulation was observed in mice or monkeys. RGLS8429 is highly bound to plasma 
protein in mice, monkeys and humans, monkeys, and mice (79.1% ,86.6%, and 81.6 %, respectively). 
RGLS8429 distributes rapidly to the ki dney and liver, is metabolically stab le with only trace amounts of 
metabolites measured, and is  excreted rapidly in the urine, primar ily in the first 24 ho urs after dosing. Of 
note, the decreased renal function pr esent in patients with ADPKD is expected to decrease the renal 
clearance of RGLS8429, and ther efore, will be monitored cl osely in clinical trials. 
Based upon in vitro  studies, RGLS8429 has little  potential for PK interact ions with other drugs via 
either cytochrome P450 enzymes or transporters. In Pcy/DBA mouse model, co-administration of 
RGLS8429 and tolvaptan had no signif icant effect (defined as <2-fo ld change) on tolvaptan PK in 
plasma and RGLS8429 PK in kidney and liver. 
Toxicity studies of RGLS8429 comple ted to date demonstrate that RG LS8429 is not acutely toxic at up 
to 2000 mg/kg in mice.  
In a 13-week Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxici ty study in CD-1 mice evaluating 60, 300 and 600 
mg/kg weekly of RGLS8429, the no observed adverse effects level ( NOAEL) was determined to be 60 
mg/kg, with dose-limiting hepatotoxicity at highe r dose levels. Minimal single-cell hepatocellular 
necrosis with 2 to 3-fold elevations in ALT a nd AST were observed at 6 00 mg/kg; in addition, one 
RGLS8429 
Protocol RGLS8429-01 v3.0  Regulus Therapeutics Inc. 
Confidential and Proprietary 20 6 June 2022  mouse at 300 mg/kg had single-cell he patocellular necrosis in the absenc e of elevations in ALT or AST 
at that dose level. Other findi ngs at 300 mg/kg included: decr eased thymic lymphocytes with 
corresponding decreased thymus size and weight, and mild decreased red cell ma ss with compensatory 
hematopoiesis in the spleen and bone  marrow, both of which were consid ered to be anti-miR-17 effects. 
Additional changes at 300 mg/kg included transien t nose/muzzle swelling pos t-dose, decreased serum 
cholesterol, karyomegaly and increased mitotic figures of hepato cytes in the liver (correlating with 
increased liver weight), and increase d foamy macrophage infiltration in th e injection site(s), all of which 
were considered non-adverse. 
In a 13-week GLP toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys evaluati ng 15, 75 and 150 mg/kg weekly of 
RGLS8429, highest dose of RGLS8429 ( 150 mg/kg) was well tolerated an d was determined to be the 
NOAEL. The following findings, all of which were considered to be non-adverse, include: minimal 
increases in fibrinogen, minimal but transient incr eases in activated throm boplastin time (APTT), dose-
related dark red discoloration at the injection site with microscopi c findings of fibrosis, macrophage 
infiltration, perivascular inflammation, and hemorrhag e, vacuolated macrophage s in the lymph nodes, 
and basophilic granules within Kupffer cells in the liver.  
SC administration of the clinical formulation (150 mg/kg in water for injection) was well tolerated in 
rabbits. RGLS8429 has shown no poten tial for genotoxicity in two in vitro  studies (Ames test and 
micronucleus assay).  
RGLS8429 did not cause overt cytot oxicity and showed no evidence of  mitochondrial t oxicity. Although 
certain oligonucleotides have exhi bited the propensity to cause th rombocytopenia in animals and/or 
humans, in vitro  studies suggest that RGLS8429 has minimal potential for adve rse effects on platelets, 
which is consistent with the absence of  adverse effects in mice and monkeys. 
In addition, RGLS8429 did not induce genes involved in inflammation, consistent with the low pro-
inflammatory effects observed. 
1.4. Dose Rationale 
The starting dose and dose levels  selected for first-in-human dosing are based on the NOAELs and 
toxicity profiles in the GLP 13- week toxicity studies of RGLS 8429. The NOAELs in mice and monkeys 
were 60 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg, respectively, for human equivalent doses (HED) of 5 and 48, 
respectively. Based on the HED in the more sensitiv e species (mouse) and usi ng a safety factor of 
approximately 10 (in accordance w ith FDA Guidance for Industry, Estimating the Maximum Safe 
Starting Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteers [July 2005]), the 
starting dose in this study is 0.5 mg/kg and maximum dose will not exceed 5 mg/kg.

Confidential and Proprietary 23 6 June 2022  2.3.5.  Vital Signs 
Body temperature, seated systolic and diastolic blood pr essure (BP), heart rate (H R), and respiratory rate 
(RR) will be measured at times specified in the Schedule of Assessments and Procedures (see Table 1) .  
Body temperature may be measured or ally, via the external auditory canal, or vi a the temporal artery 
(forehead). Temperature should be measured in a consistent manne r for each subject throughout the 
entire study. 
The use of an automated device for measuring BP a nd HR is acceptable. For BPs, a properly sized and 
calibrated BP cuff should be used for each measurem ent. Subjects should be seated for approximately 5 
minutes before the BP is measured. The BP should be measured with th e subject’s feet flat on the floor, 
back supported, and arm supported at the level of the heart. The BP should be recorded to the nearest 
millimeters of mercury (mmHg).  
When the timing of these measuremen ts coincides with a blood sample collection, obtain the vital signs, 
and then collect the blood sample.

3.1. Overview of Study Design 
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 st udy, a single ascending dose of 
RGLS8429 or placebo will be administer ed via SC injection to healthy vo lunteers to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, and PK of RGLS8429. Eight subjects will be randomi zed 3:1 to receive RGLS8429 or 
placebo in each cohort.  
Cohort 1 0.5 mg/kg RGLS8429 or placebo Cohort 2 1.0 mg/kg RGLS8429 or placebo Cohort 3 2.0 mg/kg RGLS8429 or placebo Cohort 4 4.0 mg/kg RGLS8429 or placebo 
In each cohort, 6 subjects will be randomized to receive RGLS8429 and 2 will be randomized to receive 
placebo. Enrollment into subsequent c ohorts will be initiated after review of safety (AEs and safety 
laboratory tests) from the prior cohort.  
For Cohort 1, the first two subject s will receive RGLS8429 or place bo (randomized such that one 
subject receives RGLS8429 and one receives placebo)  and this sentinel group will be monitored for 48 
hr prior to dosing the remain ing subjects in the cohort. 
An unblinded pharmacist will be responsible for preparing RGLS8429 or placebo and providing the 
study drug to blinded study personnel  for administration according to the randomization procedures.  
Subjects will be admitted to the study center on Day -1, one day prior to the day of study drug 
administration (Day 1), and will be discharged on Da y 2, no less than 6 hr after the collection of the 24-
hr PK sample. Subjects will be followe d for a total of 4 weeks after dosin g and will return to the site for 
follow-up visits weekly from Weeks 1 through 4. The sentinel subjects will  remain in the clinic for 48 hr 
after dosing. 
3.2. Dose Escalation and Stopping Rules 
Prior to dose escalation, the Sponsor  and the Investigator will perform a blinded review of the safety

labeled volume of 1 mL of 1.5 μg/mL of riboflavin in 0.9% sodium chloride. The solution is clear and 
colorless to pale yellow. 
6.3. Storage of Study Drug 
Site staff must ensure that all study drug is stored in a secured area with cont rolled access under required 
storage conditions and in accordance with applicable  regulatory requirements. To ensure that the 
investigative staff are not unblinded, only unblinded pha rmacy staff and an unbli nded clinical research 
associate should have access to th e unblinded study drug. The clinic and non-pharmacy staff should be 
provided only with blinded syringes for injection to subjects. 
Study drug vials should be stored in  their original containers and in  accordance with the labels. Study 
drug must be stored in a freezer at  -20° ± 5°C. The study drug should be  stored in its car ton to protect it 
from light until it is removed from the car ton to prepare for administration.  
The site must be capable of m easuring and documenting the daily minimum and maximum temperatures 
for all freezers used to store study drug. Temperatur e monitoring information s hould be captured from 
the time of study drug receipt thr oughout the duration of the study. A s ite procedure that ensures active 
evaluation for temperature excursions should be in  place and appropriate docum entation of temperature 
monitoring must be available. The minimum a nd maximum temperature should be checked each 
business day to confirm that no excursion occurred, a nd the site should have the capability to view the 
minimum/maximum temperature fo r all nonworking days upon return  to normal operations. The 
temperature monitoring device and freezer used to st ore study drug should be inspected regularly to 
ensure that they are maintained in working order.  
Any excursions from the labeled st orage conditions should be reporte d to Regulus or designee upon 
discovery. In the event of an excurs ion, the site should ensure that the product is returned to the storage 
conditions described in the labeli ng as soon as possible. Deviations  from the storag e requirements, 
including any actions taken, must be documente d, and reported to Regulus or designee.  
Receipt of study drug, opening and closing the freezer, and other routine handling operations where the 
study drug is briefly out of the temperature range described in the labeling will not be considered 
excursions.

The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability  of RGLS8429. Secondary 
objectives include characterizing th e PK of RGLS8429 and to characteri ze several exploratory urine and 
serum biomarkers.  
Tabular summaries and analysis results will be generated by do se level for RGLS8429 and placebo 
(pooled across all cohorts). Descri ptive statistics by dose level and tr eatment group will be tabulated by 
visit. For continuous endpoints, the descriptive statistics will include  the number of observations, mean, 
median, standard deviation, coeffi cient of variation (%CV), first and third quartiles, minimum and 
maximum. Geometric mean and geom etric %CV will be presented where appropriate. For categorical 
endpoints, the number and percentage  of subjects will be summarized by dose level and treatment group. 
Details of all statistic al methods will be provided in  the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
8.2. Sample Size Determination 
Formal sample size calculations were not performe d for this study. The dose cohort size is 8 subjects 
randomized 3:1 to RGLS8429 versus placebo. The si ze of each dose cohort was chosen to provide 
sufficient information to allow assessment of  the safety and tolerability of RGLS8429. 
8.3. Analysis Populations, Subgroups, and Covariates 
8.3.1.  Analysis Populations 
Safety Population 
The Safety Population consists of all subj ects who received a dose of study drug.  
Pharmacokinetic Full Population The PK Full Population consists of all subjects w ho received a dose of RGLS 8429 and have at least 1 
concentration data point. Subjects will be analyzed based on dose level received. 
Pharmacokinetic Evaluable Population The PK Evaluable Population consists of all subj ects who received a dose of  RGLS8429 and have at 
least one PK parameter that can be reliably estimated. Subjects will be analyzed based on dose level received. 
Biomarkers Population 
The PD Population consists of all randomized subjects who have at l east one Screening and/or pre-dose 
value for the biomarker parameters.  
8.4. Final Analysis 
The final analysis of th e study will be performed when all subj ects have received study drug and been 
followed for 4 weeks.

Confidential and Proprietary 40 6 June 2022  8.4.1.  Disposition 
The number and percent of subjec ts enrolled, receiving assigned treatment, completed assigned 
treatment, and completing study will be tabulated by treatment cohort.  Subjects who withdraw from 
study drug and/or study premat urely will be summarized by treatme nt cohort with the reason for early 
discontinuation.  
8.4.2.  Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Subject demographics (age, sex, race, ethnicity) and baseline characteristics will be summarized 
descriptively by treatme nt cohort and for all subjects ba sed on the Safety Population. 
8.4.3.  Safety Analysis 
The Safety Population will be used fo r all safety analyses. No formal statistical tests will be conducted 
to assess the safety or tolerability of RGLS8429.  
Subject incidence of all TEAEs, a ll TEAEs related to study drug, and all SAEs will be tabulated by 
system organ class and preferred te rm. All fatal adverse events, SAEs, and TEAEs leading to withdrawal 
from study drug will also be listed. 
The incidence of DLTs will be summar ized by dose level and treatment group. 
The analyses of safety laboratory tests, vital signs,  and ECGs will include summa ry statistics over time 
tabulated by cohort. Similarly, changes from base line will be summarized. Shifts based on normal 
ranges between the baseline and the worst on-study value will be tabulated by dose level and treatment 
group. 
The results from the central reader assessment of EC Gs extracted from the Holter data will be used in all 
statistical analysis. The following intervals will be summarized by treatment group: PR, QRS, RR, HR, 
uncorrected QT, QTcB, and QTcF. Details of additio nal analyses will be provided in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan. 
The total dose of study drug and the proportion of s ubjects receiving each dose le vel will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics. 
Changes from baseline in the SARA test scores will be summarized descriptively over time and by 
treatment cohort for each category and the total score. The SARA is a tool for assessing ataxia. It has 
eight categories with accumulative score ranging from 0 (no ataxia) to 40 (most se vere ataxia). When 
completing the outcome measure, each  category is assessed and scored accordingly. Scores for the eight 
items range as follows:  
1. Gait (0-8 points),  
2. Stance (0-6 points),  
3. Sitting (0-4 points),  
4. Speech disturbance (0-6 points),  
5. Finger chase (0-4 points),  
6. Nose-finger test (0-4 points),  
7. Fast alternating hand mo vement (0-4 points),

Confidential and Proprietary 41 6 June 2022  8. Heel-shin slide (0-4 points).  
Once each of the 8 categories has been assessed, the total is calculated to de termine the severity of 
ataxia. 
For motor activities of the four ex tremities (Items 5-8), assessments are performed bilaterally, and the 
mean values are used to obtain the total score. 
8.4.4.  Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
PK samples will be analyzed using a validated, sensit ive, specific method. The laboratory analyzing the 
PK samples will be unblinded to ensure that PK analysis is performed only on subjects receiving 
RGLS8429. Placebo samples will be analyzed if necessary. Descri ptive statistics for plasma 
concentrations by time point and by cohort will be tabulated. Descriptiv e statistics for PK parameters 
will be summarized by cohort.  
Concentration data will be  presented and summarized for the PK Full population. 
Using non-compartmental methods, the plasma and urine concentration data will be used to derive the 
following PK parameters: C max, Tmax, AUC 0-24, AUC 0-t, AUC inf (where calculable), t ½, CL/F, V z/F, fe, 
and Ae. Additional PK parameters may be calculate d as appropriate. The PK Evaluable Population will 
be used for these analyses. 
Dose proportionality will be explor ed using the power model for C max, AUC 0-24, AUC 0-t, and AUC inf as 
data permit. 
8.4.5.  Biomarker Analysis 
Descriptive statistics will be  used to characterize urine (e .g., PC1, PC2, NGAL, KIM-1, MCP-1, B2M, 
and CLU) and serum (e.g., Cysta tin-C, IGFALS, Alb, CT-proAVP, N- acetyl-1-methylhistidine, and 
others) biomarkers in all subjects. The analysis of urine and se rum biomarkers is exploratory. The PD 
Population will be used for these analyses.

9.1. Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is any noxiou s, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or 
worsen in a subject during a study. It may be a new inte rcurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, 
an injury, or any concomitant impai rment of the subject’s health, incl uding laboratory test values (as 
specified by the criteria in Section 9.3 ), regardless of etiology. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically 
significant adverse change in  the frequency or intensity of a pre-ex isting condition) should be considered 
an AE. A diagnosis or syndrome sh ould be recorded on the AE page  of the CRF rather than the 
individual signs or symptoms of  the diagnosis or syndrome.  
Overdose (accidental or intentional), abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity, or to xicity to a study drug should be 
reported as an AE. If an overdose is associated with  an AE, the overdose and AE should be reported as 
separate terms. Any sequelae of an accidental or intentional over dose of a study drug should be reported 
as an AE on the AE CRF. If the sequelae of an over dose are a SAE, then the sequelae must be reported 
on the AE CRF and marked as serious. The overdose resulting in the SAE shoul d be identified as the 
cause of the event on the CRF but should not be reported as an SAE itself.  
In the event of overdose, the subj ect should be monitored as appropr iate and should re ceive supportive 
measures, as necessary. There is no known specific antidote for RGLS84 29 overdose. Actual treatment 
should depend on the severity of th e clinical situation a nd the judgment and expe rience of the treating 
physician. (Please refer to the RGLS8429 Investigator’s  Brochure, Summary of Data and Guidance for 
the Investigator for additional information.)  
All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study. Assessments may include monitoring of any or 
all the following parameters: the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory, pathological, radiological, or 
surgical findings, physical examin ation findings, or find ings from other test s and/or procedures. 
All AEs and SAEs will be recorded by the Investigator with the start of study drug administration until 
EOS Visit. All SAEs made known to the Investigator at any time thereafter that  are suspected of being 
related to study drug will also be recorded. AEs and SAEs will be recorded on the AE page of the CRF 
and in the subject’s source documents.  
9.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events 
A qualified Investigator must ev aluate all adverse events.  
9.2.1.  Seriousness  
An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that: 
x Results in death. 
x Is life-threatening (i.e., in the opinion of the In vestigator, the subject is at immediate risk of 
death from the AE). 
x Requires inpatient hospitalizati on or prolongation of existing hospitalization (hospitalization 
is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay). 
x Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to condu ct normal life functions). 
x Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
RGLS8429 
Protocol RGLS8429-01 v3.0  Regulus Therapeutics Inc. 
Confidential and Proprietary 43 6 June 2022  x Constitutes an important medical event. Important medical events are defined as those 
occurrences that may not be im mediately life-threatening or re sult in death, hospitalization, or 
disability, but may jeopard ize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the other outcomes listed above. Medical a nd scientific judgment should be exercised in 
deciding whether such an AE should be considered serious. 
Events not considered  to be SAEs are hospitalizations for: 
x A standard procedure for protocol therapy administration. However, hospitalization or 
prolonged hospitalization for a comp lication of therapy administration will be reported as an 
SAE.  
x Routine treatment or monitoring of the st udied indication not associated with any 
deterioration in condition. 
x The administration of blood or platelet transf usion as routin e treatment of a concurrent 
medical condition. However, hospitalization or  prolonged hospitalization for a complication 
of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE. 
x A procedure for protocol/disease-related i nvestigations (e.g., surg ery, scans, endoscopy, 
sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling). However,  hospitalization or prolonged 
hospitalization for a complication of such  procedures remains a reportable SAE. 
x Hospitalization or prolongation of  hospitalization for technical, pr actical, or social reasons, in 
absence of an AE. 
x A procedure that is planned (i .e., planned prior to start of  treatment on study); must be 
documented in the source document and the CRF. Hospitalization or prolonged 
hospitalization for a complication remains a reportable SAE. 
x An elective treatment of or an elective procedure for a pre-existing condition, unrelated to the 
studied indication that has not  worsened from baseline.  
x Emergency outpatient treatment or observati on that does not result in admission, unless 
fulfilling other seriousness criteria above. 
If an AE is considered serious, the AE page/screen of the CRF mu st be completed and marked as 
serious. 
For each SAE, the Investigator will provide informati on on severity, start, and stop dates, relationship to 
the study drug, action taken regard ing the study drug, and outcome. 
9.2.2.  Severity/Intensity 
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator must as sess the severity/intensity of the event.  
The Investigator will assess the grade of the AE acco rding to the FDA’s Guidance for Industry: Toxicity 
Grading Scale for Healthy Adult a nd Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in  Preventive Vaccine Clinical 
Trials (September 2007) except for AEs associated  with abnormal serum creatinine level. The 
Investigator will use the KDIGO Clinical Pr actice Guideline for Acute Kidney Injury 
(https://kdigo.org/wp-content/upl oads/2016/10/KDIGO-2012-AKI-Guidelin e-English.pdf) to grade the 
severity of an AE associated with  abnormal serum creatinine level. Toxicities that are not specified in 
these guidances will be defined as follows:  
RGLS8429 
Protocol RGLS8429-01 v3.0  Regulus Therapeutics Inc. 
Confidential and Proprietary 44 6 June 2022  x Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms ; clinical or diagnosti c observations only; 
intervention not indicated 
x Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local, or noninva sive intervention i ndicated; limiting age-
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) 
x Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization indicat ed; disabling; limit ing self-care ADL 
x Grade 4: Life-threatening consequen ces; urgent intervention indicated 
x Grade 5: Death related to AE 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the inte nsity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or 
severe myocardial infarcti on); however, the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance 
(such as severe headache). This criterion is not the same as “serious”, wh ich is based on subject/event 
outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. 
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining regulatory obligations. 
9.2.3.  Causality 
The Investigator must determin e the relationship between the st udy drug and the occurrence of an 
AE/SAE. This relationship is indicated by as “unrelat ed” or “related” in res ponse to the question: Is 
there a reasonable possibility that  the event may be caused by the st udy drug. In addition to a temporal 
relationship, the Investigator shou ld consider the following when de termining the relationship between 
an AE and study drug: whether an alternative etiol ogy has been identified, m echanism of action of the 
study drug, and/or the biological pl ausibility of a relationship. 
9.2.4.  Duration 
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator will provide a r ecord of the start and stop dates of the event. In 
all cases, the AE must have the same verbatim term thr oughout. Within the durati on of the SAE or AE, 
the maximum grade should be used to categorize severity. 
9.2.5.  Action Taken 
The Investigator will report the actio n taken with study drug as a result of  an AE or SAE, as applicable 
and report if concomitant and/or additiona l treatments were given for the event.  
9.2.6.  Outcome 
Subjects will be followed until AEs have either resolv ed, returned to baseline status, or are deemed 
stable or commensurate with ongoi ng disease processes, per th e Investigator’s judgment.  
One of the four outcomes liste d below must be  recorded:  
x Resolved  – The subject has recove red fully from the event with no residual effects 
observable or returned to baseline status.  
x Resolved with sequelae  – The subject has recovered fro m the event with some residual 
effect(s) observable. The residual effect (s) will be recorded in the CRF.  
RGLS8429 
Protocol RGLS8429-01 v3.0  Regulus Therapeutics Inc. 
Confidential and Proprietary 45 6 June 2022  x Ongoing  – Effects of the event are still present, re gardless of whether th e effect is changing 
or stable and persistent.  
x Fatal outcome (for serious adverse events only)  
9.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values 
An abnormal laboratory value is an AE if the abnormality: 
x Results in discontin uation from the study. 
x Requires treatment, stopping or  holding study drug, or any othe r therapeutic intervention. 
x Is judged to be clinic ally significant, e.g., one that indi cates a new disease process and/or 
organ toxicity; or is an exacerbation or worsening of an existing condition. 
Regardless of severity grade, only la boratory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion need to be 
documented as a serious adverse event. 
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis  or syndrome, then only the diagnosis or 
syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF. If the abnormality was not a part of a 
diagnosis or syndrome, then the la boratory abnormality should be r ecorded as the AE. If possible, the 
laboratory abnormality should be record ed as a medical term and not s imply as an abnormal laboratory 
result (e.g., record thrombocytopenia rather than decreased platelets) . 
9.4. Pregnancy 
All pregnancies or suspected pregna ncies occurring in either a female  subject or female partner of a 
male subject are immedi ately reportable events .  
In the event that a pregnancy or susp HFWHGSUHJQDQF\LQFOXGLQJHOHYDWHGȕK&*RUSRVLWLYHSUHJQDQF\
test in a female subject) should o ccur while the subject is in study, or  within 90 days of the subject’s 
dose of study drug, it will be considered an immedi ately reportable event. The pregnancy, suspected 
pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to the st udy pharmacovigilance group 
immediately by email using th e Pregnancy Reporting Form. 
The female subject may be referred  to an obstetrician-gynecologist or  another appropriate healthcare 
professional for further evaluation. 
The Investigator will follow the female subject un til completion of the pregnancy and must notify the 
study pharmacovigilance group immediately about the ou tcome of the pregnancy (normal or abnormal 
outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow-up Report Form. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy wa s abnormal (e.g., spontaneous aborti on), the Investigator should 
report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any of the seri ous criteria, it 
must be reported as an SAE to  the study pharmacovigilance group with in 24 hr of the Investigator’s 
knowledge of the event. 
All neonatal deaths that occur within  28 days of birth should be repor ted, without regard to causality, as 
SAEs. In addition, any infant death af ter 28 days that the Inve stigator suspects is re lated to the in-utero 
exposure to the study drug should also be reported to  the study pharmacovigilanc e group within 24 hr of 
the Investigator’s know ledge of the event.

Confidential and Proprietary 46 6 June 2022  9.4.1.  Male Subjects 
If a female partner of a male subj ect taking study drug becomes pregna nt, the male subject taking study 
drug should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female partner should be advised to call their 
healthcare provider immediately.  
9.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
All AEs that meet criterion for an  SAE must be entered on the AE CRF  and marked as serious in the 
clinical database. All SAEs must  be reported to the study pharmac ovigilance group within 24 hr of 
knowledge of the event.  
The Investigator is required to ensure that the da ta on these forms is accura te and consistent. This 
requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to study drug) that occur during the study 
(from the administration of study drug until the EOS Vi sit) or any SAE made known to the Investigator 
at any time thereafter that are susp ected of being related to study drug.  
The SAE report should provide a detailed descripti on of the SAE and include  a concise summary of 
hospital records and other relevant documents. If a subj ect died and an autopsy has been performed, copies 
of the autopsy report and death certificate are to be sent to the study PV mailbox as soon as these become 
available. Any follow-up data should  be detailed in the AE CRF.  
Where required by local legislation, the Investigator  is responsible for informing the Institutional 
Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) of the SAE and providing them with a ll relevant initial and 
follow-up information about th e event. The Investigator must keep copies of all SAE information on file 
including correspondence w ith the study pharmacovigila nce group and the IRB/EC. 
9.6. Safety Queries 
Queries pertaining to SAEs will be communicated from the study pharm acovigilance group to the site 
via electronic mail. The response time is expected to  be no more than five (5) business days. Urgent 
queries (e.g., missing causality asse ssment) may be handled by phone. 
9.7. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events 
For the purpose of regulatory reporting, the Sponsor’s  Lead Physician will determine the expectedness 
of events suspected of being re lated to study drug based on info rmation in the Reference Safety 
Information section of the Investigator Brochure.  
All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S USARs) will be reported in an expedited manner 
in accordance local and FDA (21 CFR 312.32) regulations. 
The study pharmacovigilance group shall notify the Investigator of the following information: 
x Any AE suspected of being related to the use of study drug in this st udy or in other studies 
that is both serious and unexpected (i.e., SUSAR). 
x Any finding from tests in laborat ory animals that suggests a significant risk for human 
subjects including reports of mutagenici ty, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity. 
Where required by local legislation, th e Investigator shall notify his/he r IRB/EC promptly of these new 
serious and unexpected AE(s) or significant risks to subjects.

by Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as described in  International Conferen ce on Harmonisation (ICH) 
Guideline E6 (R2) and in accordance with the genera l ethical principles outlined  in the Declaration of 
Helsinki. The study will receive a pproval from an IRB/EC prior to commencement. The Investigator 
will conduct all aspects of this study in accordance with applicable national, state, and local laws of the 
pertinent regulatory authorities. 
12.2. Investigator Responsibilities 
Investigator responsibilitie s are set out in the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6 (R2) and in 
the local regulations. Regulus staff or an authoriz ed representative will evaluate and approve all 
Investigators who in turn will select their staff. 
The Investigator should ensure th at all persons assisti ng with the study are adequately informed about 
the protocol, amendments, study trea tments, as well as study-related  duties and functions, including 
obligations of confidentiality of Regulus information. The Investigator should ma intain a list of Sub-
Investigators and other a ppropriately qualified persons to whom he or she has delegated significant 
study-related duties. 
The Investigator is responsible for keeping a record of all subjects w ho sign an informed consent form 
(ICF) and are screened for entry into the study. Subjects who fail Sc reening must have the reason(s) 
recorded in the subject’s source documents. 
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s st aff, must be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries a nd allow direct access to su bject records (e.g., medical 
records, office charts, hospital charts, and study -related charts) for sour ce data verification. The 
Investigator must ensure timely and accu rate completion of CRFs and queries. 
The information contained in the protocol and amendments (excep t for the information provided by 
Regulus on public registry websites)  is considered Regulus confiden tial information. Only information 
that is disclosed previously by Regulus on a public  registry website may be  freely disclosed by the 
Investigator or its institution, or as outlined in th e Clinical Trial Agreement. The Regulus protocol, 
amendments, and IB information are not to be made publicly available (for example on the 
Investigator’s or their institution’s website) withou t express written approval from Regulus. Information 
proposed for posting on the Investigato r’s or their institution’s website must be submitted to Regulus for 
review and approval, providing at least 5 business days for review. 
At the time results of this study are made availabl e to the public, if requested, Regulus will provide 
Investigators with a summary of th e results that is written for th e lay person. The Investigator is 
responsible for sharing these results  with the subject and/ or their caregiver as agreed by the subject. 
12.3. Subject Information and Informed Consent 
The Investigator must obtain inform ed consent of a subject and/or a subject’s legal representative prior 
to any study-related procedures.

the informed consent process shoul d be recorded in the study subj ect’s source documen ts including the 
date. The original ICF signed and dated by the st udy subject and by the pe rson consenting the study 
subject prior to the study subject’ s entry into the study, must be main tained in the Investigator’s study 
files and a copy given to the study subject. In additi on, if a protocol is amended and it impacts on the 
content of the informed consent, the ICF must be re vised. Study subjects partic ipating in the study when 
the amended protocol is implemented must be re-consented with the revised version of the ICF. The 
revised ICF signed and dated by th e study subject and by the person c onsenting the study subject must 
be maintained in the Inves tigator’s study files and a copy given to the study subject. 
12.4. Confidentiality 
Regulus affirms the subject's right to protection against invasion of pr ivacy and to follow ICH and other 
local regulations (whichever is mo st stringent). Regulus requires the Investigat or to permit Regulus 
representatives and, when necessary, representatives fr om regulatory authorities, to review and/or copy 
any medical records relevant to the study in accordance with local laws. 
Should direct access to medical records require a waiv er or authorization separate from the subject’s 
signed ICF, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain su ch permission in writing from the 
appropriate individual. 
12.5. Protocol Amendments 
Any amendment to this protocol must be approved by the Sponsor and submitted to the IRB/EC for 
written approval. Written approval must be obtained before implem entation of the amended version 
occurs. The written signed approva l from the IRB/EC should specifica lly reference the Investigator 
name, protocol number, study title, and amendment number(s) that are applicable. Amendments that are 
administrative in nature do not require IRB/IEC a pproval but will be submitted to the IRB/IEC for 
information purposes. 
12.6. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Review and Approval 
Before the start of the study, the study protocol, ICF, and any othe r appropriate documents will be 
submitted to the IRB/EC with a cover letter or a fo rm listing the documents s ubmitted, thei r dates of 
issue, and the site (or region or  area of jurisdiction, as applicab le) for which approval is sought. If 
applicable, the documents will also be submitted to  the authorities in accordance with local legal 
requirements. 
RGLS8429 can be supplied to an Investigator by Regul us or its authorized representative only after 
documentation on all ethical and lega l requirements for starting the study has been received by Regulus 
or its authorized representative. This documentation must also include  a list of the members of the 
IRB/EC and their occupation and qualifications. If th e IRB/EC will not disclose the names, occupations, 
and qualifications of the committee me mbers, it should be asked to issu e a statement confirming that the 
composition of the committee is in accordance with  GCP. For example, the IRB General Assurance 
Number may be accepted as a substitute for this list.  Formal approval by the I RB/EC should mention the 
protocol title, number, am endment number (if applicab le), study site (or region or  area of jurisdiction, as 
applicable), and any other documen ts reviewed. It must mention th e date on which the decision was 
made and must be officially signed by a committee me mber. Before the first subject is enrolled in the

13.1. Data/Documents 
The Investigator must ensure that  the records and documen ts pertaining to the c onduct of the study and 
the distribution of the study drug are complete, accurate, filed, a nd retained. Examples of source 
documents include hospital records;  clinic and office charts; labora tory notes; memoranda; subject’s 
diaries or evaluation checklists; disp ensing records; recorded data from automated instruments; copies or 
transcriptions certified after verifi cation as being accurate copies; mic rofiche; x-ray film and reports; 
and records kept at the pharmacy, and the la boratories, as well as copies of CRFs. 
13.2. Data Management 
Data will be collected via CRF, and data entry will be performed through username- and password-
protected access to a secure database. These data  will be verified electr onically through use of 
programmed edit checks specified by the Sponsor. Disc repancies in the data will be brought to the 
attention of the Sponsor and investigational site person nel, as necessary. Resoluti ons to these issues will 
be reflected in the database. An audit trail within the system will track all changes made to the data. 
13.3. Record Retention 
Essential documents must be retained by the Investig ator according to the period outlined in the Clinical 
Trial Agreement. The Investigator must retain thes e documents for the time period described above or 
according to local laws or requirements, whichever is longer. Essential docu ments include, but are not 
limited to, the following: 
x Signed ICFs for all subjects 
x Subject identification code list, Screening log (if applicable), and enrollment log 
x Record of all communications betwee n the Investigator and the IRB/EC 
x Composition of the IRB/EC 
x Record of all communications between the In vestigator, Regulus, and their authorized 
representative(s) 
x List of Sub-Investigators and ot her appropriately quali fied persons to whom the Investigator 
has delegated significant study-related duties,  together with thei r roles in the study, 
curriculum vitae, and their signatures 
x RGLS8429 accountability records 
x Record of any body fluids or  tissue samples retained 
x All other source documents (subject records,  hospital records, labor atory records, etc.) 
x All other documents as listed  in Section 8 of the ICH c onsolidated guideline on GCP 
(Essential Documents for the C onduct of a Clinical Trial) 
The Investigator must notif y Regulus if he/she wishes to assign the essential documents to someone else, 
remove them to another location, or  is unable to retain them for a specified period. Th e Investigator 
must obtain approval in writing from Re gulus prior to destruction of any records. If the Investigator is

Confidential and Proprietary 54 6 June 2022  unable to meet this obligation, the Investigator must ask Regulus fo r permission to ma ke alternative 
arrangements. Details of these arra ngements should be documented.  
All study documents should be made av ailable if required by re levant health authorit ies. Investigator or 
institution should take measures to  prevent accidental or  premature destructi on of these documents.

All aspects of the study will be m onitored carefully by Regulus or it s authorized representative for 
compliance with applicable government regulati ons with respect to current GCP and SOPs. 
14.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification 
Regulus or designee ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during, and 
after the study. All as pects of the study are reviewed with th e Investigator and the staff at a study 
initiation visit and/or at an Invest igators’ Meeting. Prior to enroll ing subjects into the study, a Regulus 
representative or designee will review the protocol , CRFs, procedures for obtaining informed consent, 
record keeping, and reporting of AEs/SAEs with the Investigator. Monitoring w ill include on-site visits 
with the Investigator and his/her staff as well as any appropria te communications by mail, email, or 
telephone. During monitoring visits , the facilities, study drug storag e area, CRFs, subject’s source 
documents, and all other study documentation will be inspected/reviewed by the Regulus representative. 
Accuracy will be checked by perfor ming source data verification that  is a direct comparison of the 
entries made onto the CRFs against the appropriate source documenta tion. Any resulting discrepancies 
will be reviewed with the Investigator and/or his/ her staff. Any necessary corrections will be made 
directly to the CRFs or via queries  by the Investigator and/or his/ her staff. Monitoring procedures 
require that informed consents, adherence to incl usion/exclusion criteria, and documentation of SAEs 
and their proper recording be ve rified. Additional monitoring activit ies may be outlined in a study-
specific monitoring plan. 
14.2. Audits and Inspections 
In addition to the routine monitori ng procedures, a representative of  Regulus or designee may conduct 
audits of clinical research activ ities to evaluate compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and 
regulations. 
The Investigator is required to pe rmit direct access to th e facilities where the st udy took place, source 
documents, CRFs, and applicable supporting records of study subject partic ipation for audits and 
inspections by IRB/ECs, regulator y authorities, and company-aut horized representatives. The 
Investigator should make every effort  to be available for th e audits and/or inspecti ons. If the Investigator 
is contacted by any regulatory aut hority regarding an inspection, he /she should contact Regulus or 
designee immediately.

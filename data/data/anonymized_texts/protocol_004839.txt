Title  An Open -label, Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety and 
Tolerability of Treprostinil Inhalation Powder  (TreT)  in Subjects 
with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Currently Using Tyvaso  
Study Phase  1b 
Indication  Pulmonary arterial hypertension  (WHO Group 1)  
Primary Objective  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Treprostinil Inhalation 
Powder  (TreT ) in subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension 
(PAH) currently treated with Tyvaso® 
Secondary Objective(s)  1. To evaluate systemic exposure and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
treprostinil in subjects with PAH when delivered as Tyvaso 
and TreT  
2. To evaluate 6 -Minute Walk Distance (6MWD) at study entry 
and after 3 weeks of treatment with TreT  
3. To evaluate long -term safety an d tolerability of TreT  in 
subjects with PAH previously treated with Tyvaso   
4. To evaluate subject satisfaction with and preference for 
inhaled treprostinil devices  with the Preference 
Questionnaire for Inhaled Treprostinil Devices  (PQ-ITD). 
5. To evaluate patie nt-reported PAH symptoms and impact with 
the PAH -Symptoms and Impact  (PAH -SYMPACT ) 
Questionnaire . 
Study Design  This is a Phase 1b safety and tolerability single -sequence study in 
which subjects on a stable regimen of Tyvaso will switch to a 
corresponding dose of TreT.  At Baseline, subjects currently taking 
stable doses of Tyvaso (6 to 12 breaths 4 times daily [QID] ) will 
take a dos e of Tyvaso in the clinic and undergo  PK assessments , 
safety assessments , and a 6-Minute Walk Test ( 6MW T).  Following 
the in -clinic assessments, subjects will switch from Tyvaso to the 
corresponding dose of TreT and take their first dose of TreT in the 
clinic.  Following  3 weeks of treatment with TreT, subjects will 
return to the clinic and receive 1 dose of TreT in clinic and undergo 
PK assessments, safety assessments, and a 6MWT as performed at 
the Baseline Visit.   
Following the Week 3 Visit, subjects will be offered the opportunity 
to participate in the Optional Extension Phase of the study .  Subjects 
who elect to discontinue TreT  at the end of the Treatment Phase will 
return to the clinic in 2  weeks for an End of S tudy Visit.   Subjects 
who elect to enter the Optional Extension Phase will remain on TreT 
and attend follow -up study visits that will occur every 8 weeks until 
the study is terminate d or the drug/device becomes commercially 
available.   If the subject disco ntinues TreT  prematurely during the 
United Therapeutics Corp.  TIP-PH-101 Protocol Amendment 2  
 Treprostinil Inhalation Powder (TreT)  
Version Dat e 02 April 2020  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 5 Optional Extension Phase, he/she must return to clinic as soon as 
possible for an Early Termination Visit .

Study Entry  Treatment Phase  
Tyvaso Dose 
(QID)  TreT Dose (QID)  Device Requirement  
6 to 7 breaths  32 µg 32 µg cartridge  
8 to 10 breaths  48 µg 48 µg cartridge  
11 to 12 breaths  64 µg 32 µg + 32 µg cartridges  
Control Group  None  
Route of  
Administration  TreT  will be administered via a dry powder inhaler in 3  dose levels 
supplied as cartridges filled to provide 32 µg, 48 µg, and 64 µg of 
treprostinil .  Tyvaso inhalation solution will be administered via 
ultrasonic nebul ization using the commercially available Tyvaso 
Inhalation System.  
Procedures  Screening Phase : Prospective subjects will be assessed during the 
Screening Phase to determine eligibility for the study.  The 
Screening Visit must occur within 14  days prior to Baseline .  During 
this Screening Phase, eligible subjects will sign the Informed 
Consent form and undergo screening assessments.  Subjects who 
satisfy all eligibility  criteria during the Screening Phase  may return 
to the clinic at Baseline for enrollment.  If subjects are able to satisfy 
all eligibility criteria on the same day, a combined 
Screeni ng/Baseline Visit may be conducted.   
United Therapeutics Corp.  TIP-PH-101 Protocol Amendment 2  
 Treprostinil Inhalation Powder (TreT)  
Version Dat e 02 April 2020  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 Treatment Phase : The Treatment Phase consists of 2 study visits to 
the clinic separated by 3 weeks of treatment with TreT .  At Baseline, 
subjects will receive 1 dose of Tyvaso in clinic and undergo PK 
assessments  (at th e following timepoints: 15  minutes before dose 
and 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 90, 120, 180, 240, and 300 minutes after dose), 
safety assessments, and a 6MWT .  No additional dose of Tyvaso 
will be administered, nor will TreT be started, until after the PK 
sampl ing assessment is complete .  Following these assessments, 
subjects will be assigned a corresponding dose of TreT  based upon 
their current stable Tyvaso dose  and will receive the first dose of 
TreT in the clinic .  Each subject will receive TreT  QID by oral 
inhalation for 3 weeks.  Following 3  weeks of treatment, s ubjects 
will re turn to the clinic and r eceive 1 dose of TreT  in clinic and 
undergo PK assessments , safety assessments, and a 6MWT as 
performed at the Baseline Visit .  Questionnaire s evaluating patient 
preference for inhaled treprostinil devices and patient -reported PAH 
symptoms and impact will also be administered .  At each study visit  
during the Treatment Phase , adverse events (AEs) will be assessed, 
vital signs will be recorded, an d a physical examination  will be 
performed.  Following the Week 3 Visit , subjects may choose to 
participate in the Optional Extension Phase of the study.  If the 
subject does not elect to participate in the Optional Extension Phase 
of the study, he/she  must discontinue TreT, may resume Tyvaso, and 
must return to the clinic 2 weeks after TreT discontinuation for an 
End of Study Visit.    
Optional Extension Phase : The Optional Extension Phase will 
occur following completion of the Treatment Phase and continue 
with clinic visits every 8 weeks until the study is terminated for any 
reason or the drug/device becomes commercially available.  To be 
eligible for the Optional Extension Phase, subjects must complete 
the Treatment Phase, elect to continue TreT , and agree  to attend 
follow -up visits in the clinic.   Dosing titration  will be encouraged  
during the Optional Extension Phase; the dose of TreT  should be 
titrated  upward , as clinically tolerated , to identify a maximum stable 
dose in each subject .  Subjects who discontinue TreT  must complete 
an Early Termination Visit as soon as possible . 
Statistical 
Considerations  Plasma concentrations of treprostinil above the lower limit of 
quantitation will be used to calculate area under the curve from time 
0 to 300 minutes  (AUC 0-300) and maximal drug concentration ( Cmax) 
for each treatment.  PK and safety parameters will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics.  The 6MW T results will also be 
summarized using descriptive statistics.  The number and percent of 
subjects with AEs will be tabulated for treatment phases by Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA) System Organ 
Class and P referred Term by relationshi p to treatment and severity.

1.1 DEFINITION OF CLINIC AL PROBLEM  
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), defined as an elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure 
and pulmonary vascular resistance, is a severe hemodynamic abnormality associated with  a 
variety of diseases and syndromes.  Elevation in pulmonary arterial press ure causes an increase 
in right ventricular afterload, impairing right ventricular function , and ultimately leading to heart 
failure and death  (Rubin 1997) . 
There are 3 major factors thought to contribute to the increased pulmonary vascular resistance 
seen in this disease: vasoconstriction, remodeling of the vessel wall, and thrombosis.  There are 
several metabolic pathways which  contribute to these changes that involve  vasoactive mediators 
such as the vasodilators , nitric oxide and prostacyclin  (PGI 2), and  the vasoconstrictor , 
endothelin -1.  These substances affect both vascular tone and remodeling , leading to the ir use as 
pharmacologic targets  (Farber  2004 ). 
Approved pharmacotherapies for PAH in the US include intravenous (IV) PGI 2 (epoprostenol  
sodium or Flolan , Veletri®); the PGI 2 analogues , subcutaneous, IV, and inhaled treprostinil 
(Remodulin®, Tyvaso®), oral treprostinil diethanolamine (also referred to as treprostinil 
diolamine; Orenitram®), oral selexipag (Uptravi®), and inhaled iloprost (Ventavis®); the 
phosphodiesterase  type 5 inhibitors  (PDE5 -Is), tadalafil (Adcirca®) and sildenafil (Revatio®); the 
oral endothelin receptor antagonists  (ERA s), bosentan (Tracleer®), ambrisentan (Letairis®, 
Volibris®), and macitentan (Opsumit®); and a soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator, 
riociguat (Adempas®). 
1.2 INHALED TREPROSTINIL  BACKGROUND  
1.2.1 Treprostinil Inhalation Powder  
United Therapeutics Corporation (UTC) is developing a combination drug -device product which 
is comprised of a dry powder  formulation of Treprostinil Inhalation Powder (TreT) and a small, 
portable, dry powder inhaler.   The dry powder contains  treprostinil and an inhalation excipient , 
fumaryl diketopiperazine (FDKP), which is an excipient present in  Afrezza®, an Food and Drug  
Administration ( FDA )-approved drug product that is listed in the FDA Inactive Ingredient 
Database.

 Treprostinil Inhalation Powder (TreT)  
Version Dat e 02 April 2020  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17 1.2.1.1  Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient: Treprostinil  
Treprostinil, [[(1R,2R,3aS,9aS) 2,3,3a,4,9,9a hexahydro 2 hydroxy 1 [(3S) 3 hydroxyoctyl] 1H 
benz [f]inden 5 yl]oxy]acetic acid, is a chemically stable tricyclic analogue of PGI 2.  The 
pharmacology of treprostinil has been extensively characterized in well -established models, all 
confirming the suitability of the drug for the treatment of PAH following either t he 
subcutaneous, IV, inhaled (as treprostinil sodium) , or oral (as treprostinil diethanolamine) routes 
of administration.  
The major pharmacological actions of treprostinil are direct vasodilation of pulmonary and 
systemic arterial vascular beds and inhibit ion of platelet aggregation.  In vitro , treprostinil 
induced concentration -dependent relaxation of rabbit isolated , precontracted , mesenteric arteries 
and inhibition of adenosine diphosphate -induced platelet aggregation in human and rat platelet -
rich plasm a.  In animals, the vasodilatory effects of treprostinil reduce right and left ventricular 
afterload, thereby increasing cardiac output and stroke volume.  Prostacyclins lower pulmonary 
artery pressure, increase cardiac output without affecting the heart r ate (HR), and improve 
systemic oxygen transport as well as possibly reversing pulmonary artery remodeling.  There is 
also increasing evidence that the ability to block the proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth 
muscle cells may contribute, along with vas odilation, to the therapeutic effects of PGI 2 in the 
treatment of PAH.  The mechanism of action is therefore likely to be multifactorial.  
1.2.2 General Toxicology  
1.2.2.1  Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient: Treprostinil  
A well -defined clinical safety profile exists for tr eprostinil sodium; acute toxicity studies, repeat -
dose toxicity studies, reproductive toxicity studies, and genotoxicity studies have been performed 
in both rats and dogs and support the chronic administration to patients (Remodulin Package 
Insert 201 8, Tyvaso Package Insert 2017 ).   
The toxicokinetic profile of treprostinil was also evaluated in acute and repeat -dose toxicity 
studies of up to 13 weeks in duration in rodents and dogs, which supported the chronic 
administration of inhaled treprostinil to p atients.  In addition, a 2 -year rat carcinogenicity study 
was performed with treprostinil for inhalation at target doses up to 5.25, 10.6, and 
34.1 µg/kg/day, which found no evidence for carcinogenic potential associated with inhaled

maintenance dose of 54  µg.   
1.2.3 Clinical Experience  
1.2.3.1  Inhaled Treprostinil (Tyvaso)  
A series of acute and chronic investigator -initiated clinical studies were conducted with inhaled 
treprostinil to optimize the formulation for inhalation ; determine dose response, tolerability, and 
safety ; and also to evaluate safety and tolerability when combined with other PAH therapies 
(Channick 2006, Voswinckel 2006).  In the acute dosing studies, a dministration of inhaled 
treprostinil resulted in pulmonary vasodilation at relatively low doses.  In the chronic studies, 
administration of inhaled treprostinil resulted in sustained improvement of exercise capacity.   
A randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, Phase 3 study (TRIUMPH -I) was conducted to 
assess the safety and efficacy of inhaled treprostinil in combination with approved PAH 
therapies.  Two hundred thirty -five subjects who were clinically stable on an approved 
background oral PAH therap y (bosentan or sildenafil) were randomly allocated to receive either 
placebo or inhaled treprostinil for 12 weeks.  The primary efficacy endpoint was change in 
exercise capacity at Week 12 as measured by 6 -Minute Walk Distance (6MWD).  At Week  12, 
subjects  receiving inhaled treprostinil had a median improvement of +21.6  m in 6MWD , and 
subjects in the placebo group had a median improvement of +3.0  m.  The Hodges -Lehmann 
placebo -corrected median change from baseline in peak 6MWD was +20.0  m (p=0.00044).  The 
durability of this result was supported by secondary measures related to the trough 6MWD, 
which was measured at least 4  hours after the last dose of inhaled treprostinil.  At Week  12, 
trough 6MWD showed a placebo -corrected median treatment effect of 13.7  m (p=0.0066).  The 
most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) in the inhaled treprostinil group were cough 
(54%), headache (41%), and nausea (19%).  There were no remarkable treatment -related changes 
in chest x -rays, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), or cli nical laboratory parameters 
(McLaughlin  2010).  
An open -label, extension study of the TRIUMPH -I study to evaluate the use of long -term inhaled 
treprostinil therapy was also conducted (TRIUMPH -OL).  Subjects received 1 to 12  breaths (6 to 
72 µg) 4 times dail y (QID) to achieve daily doses of 24 to 288  µg.  The longest duration of 
United Therapeutics Corp.  TIP-PH-101 Protocol Amendment 2  
 Treprostinil Inhalation Powder (TreT)  
Version Dat e 02 April 2020  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 inhaled treprostinil exposure in the open -label study was 5.4 years and the mean duration 
2.3 years.  There were observed improvements in median 6MWD at 6, 12, 18, and 24  months of 
28, 31, 32, and 18  m, respectively.  These data support the durability of improvement in 6MWD 
obtained with inhaled treprostinil as demonstrated during the double -blind phase of the study.  
Therapeutic benefit was also noted with improvements in the Borg dys pnea score, New York 
Heart Association Functional Classification, and quality of life .  Survival was robust with 1 - and 
2-year Kaplan -Meier survival estimates of 97% and 91%, respectively, for subjects that remained 
in the study.  The most frequently repor ted AEs during the open -label study were cough (39%), 
headache (31%), upper respiratory tract infection (22%), and nausea (22%).  There were no 
clinically significant changes in clinical chemistry or hematology parameters.  Unique findings 
that related to the inhaled route of administration, in addition to cough, were throat pain and 
throat irritation, occurring in 12% and 10% of subjects, respectively.  These events were usually 
of mild or moderate severity and transient in duration.  In a few subjects, th ese specific AEs were 
more pronounced as 6  subjects ( 3%) discontinued inhaled treprostinil due to cough, including 
1 subject (<1%) with dry throat . 
1.2.3.2  Treprostinil Inhalation Powder  
An open -label, single ascending dose (SAD) study in healthy normal volunteers, MKC -475-001, 
was conducted to assess the safety and tolerability of TreT.  A total of 36  healthy volunteers 
were sequentially assigned to 6  cohorts (6 subjects per cohort) of ascending dose levels of TreT 
(30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180  µg).  Ea ch subject received 1  dose of TreT by oral inhalation 
during the Treatment Period.  The incidence and severity of AEs were assessed and 
pharmacokinetic ( PK) parameters were measured by analyzing plasma concentrations of 
treprostinil.  Bioanalysis data conf irmed  treprostinil  plasma concentrations and exposure at 
clinically relevant concentrations when TreT is administered as a dry powder via oral inhalation.  
Treprostinil exposure, as measured by maximal drug concentration ( Cmax) and area under the 
curve ( AUC), increased in a linear manner with increasing dose up to 180  µg tested , which 
would correspond to a 30 -breath dose of Tyvaso.

Administrations of 30  µg to 180  µg Treprostinil Inhalation Powder  (TreT ) 
 
The most frequently reported AEs overall were cough (3 1%) and headache (22%).  There were 
no severe AEs, serious AE (SAEs), or deaths during this study.  No AEs led to a subject’s early 
termination.  No clinically significant abnormalities on oropharyngeal examinations, clinical 
laboratory evaluations, electro cardiograms ( ECGs ), or PFTs  (spirometry) were observed.  
Overall, TreT  was safe and well  tolerated as oral inhalation doses of 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150  µg.   
1.3 RATIONALE FOR DEVELO PMENT OF STUDY DRUG IN 
DISEASE/CONDITION  
UTC  is developing a combination drug -device product which is comprised of a dry powder 
formulation of TreT and a small, portable, dry powder inhaler.   This combination product is a 
change in dosage form for treprostinil from a solution for oral inhalation  (Tyvaso) to a dry 
powder for oral inh alation.  The dry powder contains the inhalation excipient, FDKP,  which is an 
excipient present in  Afrezza,  an FDA -approved drug product that is listed in the FDA Inactive 
Ingredient Database.  The properties of the dry powder are suitable for dosing by or al inhalation 
(eg, particle size suitable for pulmonary delivery).  The device is a reusable, breath -powered, dry 
powder inhaler that does not require software , electrical power, or cleaning .  For these reasons, it

therapies.  
1.4 CLINICAL HYPOTHESIS  
This study hypothesizes that the systemic exposure, PK, and tolerability of treprostinil will be 
similar in patients with PAH when administered as TreT and Tyvaso.  
2 OBJECTI VES  
2.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TreT  in 
subjects with PAH currently treated with Tyvaso . 
2.2 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES  
A secondary objective of this clinical study is to e valuate systemic exposure and PK of 
treprostinil in subjects with PAH when delivered as Tyvaso and TreT.  Additionally, this study 
will evaluate 6MWD at study entry and after 3  weeks of treatment with TreT.  The Optional 
Extension Phase of this study will evaluate long-term safety and tolerability of TreT  in subjects 
with PAH previously treated with Tyvaso .  Further, this study will evaluate subject satisfaction 
with and preference for inhaled treprostinil devices with the PQ -ITD and patient -reported PAH 
symptoms and impact with the Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension -Symptoms and Impact 
(PAH -SYMPACT®) Questionnaire . 
3 EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a Phase 1b safety and tolerability single -sequence study in which subjects on a stable 
regimen of Tyvaso will switch to a corresponding dose of TreT.  At Baseline, subjects currently 
taking stable doses of Tyvaso (6 to 12 breaths QID) will take a dose of Tyvaso in the clinic and 
undergo PK assessments , safety assessments , and  a 6MW T.  Following the in -clinic assessments, 
subjects will switch from Tyvaso to the corresponding dose of TreT and take their first dose of 
TreT in the clinic.  Following 3 weeks of treatment with TreT, subjects will return to the clinic 
and receive 1 dose of TreT and undergo PK assessments, safety assessments, and a 6MWT as 
performed at the Baseline Visit.   
United Therapeutics Corp.  TIP-PH-101 Protocol Amendment 2  
 Treprostinil Inhalation Powder (TreT)  
Version Dat e 02 April 2020  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 Following the Week 3 Visit, subjects will be offered the opportunity to participate in  the 
Optional Extension Phase of the study.  Subjects who elect to discontinue TreT at the end of the 
Treatment Phase will return to the clinic in 2 weeks for an End of Study Visit.   Subjects who 
elect to enter the Optional Extension Phase will remain on T reT and attend study visits every 
8 weeks until the study is terminate d or the drug/device becomes commercially available.  If the 
subject discontinues TreT  prematurely  during the Optional Extension Phase, he/she must return 
to the clinic as soon as possible for an Early Termination Visit .   
Screening Phase : Prospective subjects will be assessed during the Screening Phase to determine 
eligibility for the study.  The Screening Visit must occur within 14 days prior to Baseline.  
During this Screening Ph ase, eligible subjects will sign the Informed Consent Form (ICF) and 
undergo screening assessments.  Subjects who satisfy all eligibility criteria during the Screening 
Phase may return to the clinic at Baseline for enrollment.   If subjects are able to sati sfy all 
eligibility criteria on the same day, a combined Screening/Baseline Visit may be conducted.  
Treatment Phase : The Treatment Phase consists of 2 study visits to the clinic separated by 
3 weeks of treatment with TreT .  At Baseline, s ubjects will recei ve 1 dose of Tyvaso in the clinic 
and undergo PK assessments  (at the following timepoints: 15 minutes before dose and 5, 10, 15, 
30, 45, 90, 120, 180, 240, and 300 minutes after dose), safety assessments, and a 6-Minute Walk 
Test ( 6MWT ).  No additional dos e of Tyvaso will be administered, nor will TreT be started, until 
after the PK sampl ing assessment is complete.   Following these assessments, subjects will be 
assigned a corresponding dose of TreT  based upon their current stable Tyvaso dose  and will 
receive the first dose of TreT in the clinic .  Each subject will receive TreT  QID by oral inhalation 
for 3 weeks.  Following 3  weeks of treatment, s ubjects will re turn to the clinic and r eceive 1 dose 
of TreT  in the clinic and undergo PK assessme nts, safety assessments, and a 6MWT as 
performed at the Baseline Visit .  Questionnaire s evaluating patient preference for inhaled 
treprostinil devices and patient -reported PAH symptoms and impact  will also be administered.  
At each study visit, AEs will be  assessed, vital signs will be recorded, and a physical 
examination ( PE), including oropharyngeal examination, will be performed.  Following the 
Week 3 Visit, subjects may choose to participate in the Optional Extension Phase of the study.  If 
the subject does not elect to participate in the Optional Extension Phase of the study, he/she must

discontinuation  for an End of Study Visit.   Blood samples for an optional evaluation of change in 
biomarkers (specific targets to be determined) will be collected at the Baseline Visit and Week 3 
Visit.  An additional blood sample for an optional evaluation of whole genome sequence will be 
collected at the Baseline Visit.  
Option al Extension Phase : The Optional Extension Phase will occur following completion of 
the Treatment Phase and continue with clinic visits every 8 weeks until the study is terminated 
for any reason or the drug/device becomes commercially available.  To be eligible for the 
Optional Extension Phase, subjects must complete the Treatment Phase, elect to continue TreT , 
and agree to attend follow -up visits in th e clinic.   Dosing titrat ion will be encouraged during the 
Optional Extension Phase; the dose of TreT should be titrated upward , as clinically tolerated , to 
identify a maximum stable dose in each subject .  Subjects who discontinue TreT  must complete 
an Early Termination Visit as soon as possible .  A blood sample for an optional evaluation of 
change in biomarkers will be collected at the Week 51 Visit .

3.3.1 Efficacy Assessments  
3.3.1.1  Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Fifteen minutes prior to administration of the in -clinic dose of  Tyvaso or  TreT  at the Baseline 
Visit and the Week 3 Visit , qualified study personnel, as delegated by the Investigator, will 
obtain a predose  blood sample of  approximately  5 mL via an indwelling IV catheter or by direct 
venipuncture.  The predose sample should occur at least 4  hours after the subject’s last dose of 
Tyvaso or TreT .  Subsequent serial blood samples of approximately 5 mL will be taken in a 
similar manner at the following timepoints  (±3 minutes):  5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 90, 120, 180 , 240, and 
300 minutes after Tyvaso or TreT  administration  (see Table 3-2).  Blood samples will be 
analyzed for treprostinil plasma concentrations.  
3.3.1.2  6-Minute Walk Test  
The 6MWT is a validated and reliable measure of exercise capacity in patients with chronic 
respiratory diseases (Holland 2014).  This study will utilize an unencouraged 6MWT to minimize 
potential bias associated with encouragement.  All 6MWTs will be condu cted by qualified, 
trained personnel in a designated 6MWT area which meets the requirements as described in 
Appendix 15.1.  Subjects who have not previously perfor med the 6MWT at the study site on the 
course intended for use during the study must perform a practice 6MWT at the study site at least 
1 day prior to the Baseline Visit.  Subjects will perform a peak 6MWT at Baseline to confirm 
their eligibility to partici pate in the study (6MWD ≥ 150 m per Inclusion Criteri on 7).  Prior to the 
start of each 6MWT , the subject must rest (seated ) for at least 10  minutes.   To assist with subject 
scheduling, the baseline 6MWT may be conducted within 24  hours prior to PK sampling  (eg, 
previous day).  If the baseline 6MWT is conducted the day prior to PK sampling, then the Week 3 
6MWT must also be conducted on the day prior to PK sampling for consistency.   Peak 6MWTs 
will be conducted at  study visits  as specified in Table 3-1.  All 6MWT s should  be conducted  
between  10 to 60  minutes after the most recent dose  of Tyvaso or TreT .  If the 6MWT is 
conducted concurrently with the PK sampling,  the 6MW T should occur between 45  to 60 minutes 
after the most recent dose .  Subjects receiving supplemental oxygen during the Baseline 6MWT 
should continue to receive the same flow rate at the Week 3 6MWT .  Pulmonary rehabilitation

the Week 3 Visit.  
3.3.1.3  Preference Questionnaire for Inhaled Treprostinil Devices  
The Preference Questionnaire for Inhaled Treprostinil Devices (PQ -ITD) will  be administered at 
the Baseline  Visit to assess the subject’s current use  of the Tyvaso Inhal ation System  and at the 
Week 3 Visit  or the Early Termination Visit  to assess the subject’s use of the TreT Inhaler .  The 
PQ-ITD for TreT will only be administered during an Early Termination Visit if the subject 
discontinues during the 3 -week Treatment Phase .  The PQ -ITD should be completed as the first 
assessment during the visit before the subject completes any of the other scheduled visit 
assessments.  Copies of the PQ -ITD (Tyvaso and TreT versions) can be found in the Study 
Reference Manual  and will only be administered  at study sites where available.  
3.3.1.4  PAH -SYMPACT Questionnaire  
The PAH -SYMPACT is a patient reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire consisting of  
11 symptom and 11 impact items , which was  developed based on interviews of PAH patients and 
following PRO guidance  from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  (McCollister  2016, 
Chin 2018) . 
The PAH -SYMPACT questionnaire will be administered at the Baseline Visit, Week 3 Visit, and 
the Week 11 Visit (subjects participating in the Optional Extension Phase ) or the Early 
Termination Visit.  Detailed instructions on how to administer the PAH -SYMPACT to subjects 
will be provided to the sites.  A copy of the PAH -SYMPACT questionnaire can be found in the 
Study Reference Manual  and will only be administered  at study sites where available.  
3.3.1.5  Optional Biomarker  and Optional Whole Genome Sequencing  
For subjects consenting to the optional bio marker sample , blood will be collected for the 
evaluation of biomarkers (specific targets to be determined) at Baseline , Week  3 Visit , and at the 
Week  51 Visit for subjects participating in the Optional Extension Phase  (or upon early 
termination if prior to Week 51).  These samples will be shipped to the central laboratory for 
processing and storage prior to analysis .

 Treprostinil Inhalation Powder (TreT)  
Version Date 02 April 2020  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 31 For subjects consenting to whole genome sequence analysis, a blood sample will be collected at 
Baseline.   These samples will be shipped to the central laboratory for processing and storage 
prior to analysis.   Whole genome sequences will be analyzed for genetic markers that may be 
associated with clinical response and tolerability.    
Samples for the optional biomarker and optional whole genome sequencing will be coded in a 
manner that allows them to be matched to a study site and/or a subject number, but will not carry 
personal identifiers that could be traced to a specific individual.   Complete instructions r egarding 
the processing, packaging, and shipping of samples will be provided in a separate laboratory 
manual.  
3.3.2 Safety and Tolerability Assessments  
Safety assessments include incidence and severity of reported AEs, as well as changes from 
screening in vital signs,  clinical laboratory tests, ECGs, and PEs.  
3.3.2.1  Insp iratory Criteria Assessment  
The subject’s ability to perform inhalation maneuvers will be assessed at the Screening Visit and 
the Baseline Visit.  Subjects must be able to perform inhalation maneuvers  using the BluHale® 
technology  that meets inspiratory training criteria .  Subjects who are not able to demonstrate 
proper technique will be considered screen failures.  
3.3.2.2  Medical History and Physical Examinations  
A complete medical history  (including pulmonar y hypertension history ), demographics, and PE 
(including an oropharyngeal exam ) will be conducted during the Screening Visit.  Significant 
past or present illnesses, current prescription or nonprescription medications (including vitamins 
and herbal product s), and history of allergies or idiosyncratic responses to drugs should be 
recorded.  Any significant changes to the subject’s medical condition and physical examination 
must be documented throughout the course of the study.  A complete PE will be conducte d by 
appropriate study personnel at the Screening Visit, Baseline Visit, Week 3 Visit, and the Early 
Termination Visi t.  For subjects continuing in the Optional Extension Phase, a physical exam 
will conducted at each Extension Visit.  Any clinically signif icant changes from Baseline noted 
during the study should be reported as AEs.

Vital signs will be assessed at study visits  as specified in  Table 3-1.  Vital signs measured will 
include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), HR, respiratory rate ( RR), and weight.  Vital 
signs must be assessed following at least 5  minutes of rest (sitting) to ensure accurate 
measurement.  No other measurements or proc edures should be performed during this 5 -minute 
period.  When possible, vital signs should be collected prior to the 6MWT.  If vital signs cannot 
be obtained prior to the 6MWT , then they should be obtained after recovery from the 6MWT.  
Vital signs should also be assessed and reported in the case of abnormal clinical signs and 
symptoms.   
3.3.2.4  12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG will be recorded after at least 5  minutes of rest at  the Baseline Visit and End of 
Study Visit  or Early Termination Visit .  Recordi ngs should include lead II as a rhythm strip and 
contain at least 5 QRS complexes.  ECG parameters to be collected include rhythm, HR, PR 
interval, QT interval, QRS duration (uncorrected), and any clinically significant abnormalities.   
3.3.2.5  Clinical Laboratory  Assessments  
Clinical laboratory assessments will be collected at the Baseline Visit, Week 3 Visit, End of 
Study Visit or Early Termination Visit, and at follow -up visits in the Optional Extension Phase  
as specified in Table 3-1.  Clinical laboratory results outside the normal reference range must be 
assessed for clinical significance by the Investigator.  Clinically significant refers to a laboratory 
value that is unusual with respect to the subject’s medical history or current health status.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory test values will be reported as AEs and treat ed and/or 
followed -up until the symptoms or values return to normal or acceptable levels, as judged by the 
Investigator.  Where  appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed to assess and 
document resolution.   
3.3.2.5.1  Clinical Chemistry and Hematology  
Blood for the measurement and evaluation of clinical chemistry and hematology collected at 
study visit s will be used to assess for treatment -emergent chan ges in clinical chemistry and 
hematological laboratory parameters.  Values for the following parameters will be obtained :

3.3.2.5.2  Pregnancy Testing  
Women  of childbearing potential  (WOCBP)  will undergo a urine pregnancy test at study visit s as 
specified in Table 3-1.  A positive pregnancy test will exclude the subject from further 
participation in the study.  Pregnant subjects who are discontinued from the study will be 
transitioned to an alternate therapy at the discretion of the Investigator.  
3.3.2.6  Adverse Events  
AEs will be recorded throughout the course of the  study from the time that each subject signs the 
ICF until the time screen failure is documented, or until the subject is either discontinued from 
the study or all End of Study Visit assessments have been completed.  Each subject will be 
questioned for AEs  at each scheduled study visit.  Subjects will also be instructed to 
spontaneously report all AEs throughout the study.  
All AEs should be followed until either resolution (or return to normal or baseline values), until 
they are judged by the Investigator t o no longer be clinically significant, or for at least 30  days if 
the AE extends beyond the final study visit.  All AEs meeting the criteria for serious (ie, serious 
AEs [SAEs]) should be followed until resolution, death, or the subject is lost to follow -up even if 
they are ongoing more than 30  days after completion of the final study visit (End of Study Visit 
or Early Termination Visit ).  All AEs/SAEs that occur while the subject is in study will be 
recorded as instructed in this protocol.  
Sections 9 and 15.2 provide the guidelines and definitions for recording AEs.  
3.3.2.7  Concomitant Medications  
All concomitant medications taken during the conduct of the study, including those taken for 
AEs or other me dical events as well as vitamins and herbal supplements, should be recorded in

6.1 DRUG DO SAGE, ADMINISTRATION , AND SCHEDULE  
6.1.1 Tyvaso  
Treprostinil for inhalation solution (0.6  mg/mL) is delivered via ultrasonic nebulization using the 
commercially available Tyvaso Inhalation System , which emits a dose of approximately 6  µg per 
breath.  All subject s will receive their current dose of Tyvaso in  the clinic at the Baseline Visit 
for the 6MWT and PK sampling.  
6.1.2 Treprostinil Inhalation Powder  
During the Treatment Phase, TreT will be supplied in single -use cartridges that contain either 
32 µg or 48 µg of treprostinil  per cartridge . All subjects will initiate TreT at a dose 
corresponding to their current Tyvaso regimen per  Table 6-1.  Subjects will be trained on 
inhalati on of TreT using the in haler device.  Detailed instructions for the use of this device will 
be provided to all study subjects.  In addition, all subjects will receive a copy of the TreT 
Instructions for Use . 
Table 6-1 Treatment  Phase  Assignments  
Study Entry  Treatment Phase  
Tyvaso Dose (QID)  TreT Dose (QID)  Device Requirement  
6 to 7 breaths  32 µg 32 µg cartridge  
8 to 10 breaths  48 µg 48 µg cartridge  
11 to 12 breaths  64 µg 32 µg + 32 µg cartridges  
Abbreviations: QID, 4 times daily ; TreT, Treprostinil Inhalation Powder   
 
A single -use cartridge is manually inserted into the dry powder inhaler,  which is a proprietary, 
breath -activated, reusable , dry powder inhaler  that will deliver TreT to the lungs.  Powder is 
discharged from the inhaler when the subject  inhales.  Each subject will be trained on inhalation 
technique prior to the first dose of TreT in clinic.  Additionally, subjects must be able to perform 
inhalation maneuvers  using the BluHale technol ogy that meets inspiratory training criteria .  
Subjects who are not able to demonstrate proper technique will be considered screen failures.  
At the end of the Treatment Phase, subjects will be offered the opportunity to continue therapy 
with TreT or resum e Tyvaso therapy .  If the subject continues therapy with TreT during the 
Optional Extension Phase, the dose of TreT should be  titrat ed upward,  as clinically tolerated , to

Version Date 02 April 2020  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 identify a maximum stable dose in each subject .  During the Optional Extension Phase,  a 64 µg 
cartridge  strength  may be dispensed as appropriate  to meet dosing requirements .  Dose titration 
may start at the Week 3 Visit after all study assessments have been completed  and subject agrees 
to participate in the Optional Extension Phase .  
6.2 COMPL IANCE  
Each subject will be provided with a dosing diary in order to record dosing information from 
Baseline Visit through End of Study Visit.  Subjects will be asked  to return  the completed dosing 
diary , all used and unused TreT  cartridges , and all TreT inhalers  to each scheduled study visit.  
At each visit, all TreT  cartridges and inhalers returned by the subject (used and unused) will be 
collected and new TreT  cartridges and inhalers will be dispensed.  The appropriate study 
personnel must document the nu mber of used and unused cartridges and determine if the 
appropriate amount of TreT cartridges  remain based on the dose of TreT prescribed.  
Subject compliance with the prescribed dosage regimen will be monitored throughout the study.  
At each study visit, the subject will be asked whether he or she has been compliant with dosing 
instructions.  If it is determined that a subject is not complian t with TreT , then site personnel 
must re -educate the subject on proper doing compliance and its importance.  Continued 
noncompliance during any phase of the study may lead to withdrawal of the subject from the 
study after consultation between the Investiga tor and the Sponsor.

 Treprostinil Inhalation Powder (TreT)  
Version Date 02 April 2020  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44 to the 32 µg and 48 µg cartridges, and may be dispensed as appropriate to meet dosing 
requirements .  Once a subject is receiving study drug in the blister packaging, subsequent 
Extension Visits  will occur every 8 weeks . 
7.7 STUDY CONTACTS  
At least w eekly telephone contact is required throughout the Treatment Phase to assess for AEs 
and concomitant medications .  During the Optional Extension Phase, telephone contact must 
occur at least every 2 weeks between Week 3 and Week 11, and must occur a t least monthly 
after Week 11 to encourage uptitration in addition to assessing AEs and concomitant 
medications.  These contacts may be replaced by a face -to-face interaction on the weeks where 
study visits occur and the information can be obtained during the visit.  The subject may be 
contacted via email in lieu of a telephone call; however, email should not replace direct 
follow -up by telephone or in the clinic for clinically significant AEs or other emergent issues.  A 
copy of the emails and/or telephone  contact sheets (ie, AEs reported and/or concomitant 
medication changes) must be documented in the subject’s source docu mentation .  
8 STUDY TERMINATION  
8.1 CRITERIA FOR SUBJECT  WITHDRAWAL  
A subject may voluntarily withdraw or be withdrawn from the study and/or TreT  by the 
Investigator at any time for reasons including, but not limited to, the following:  
 The subject wishes to withdraw from further participation.  
 A serious or life -threatening AE occurs or the Investigator considers that it is necessary to 
disconti nue TreT  to protect the safety of the subject.  
 The subject consistently deviated from the protocol.  
 The subject has a l ung transplant.  
 The subject becomes pregnant.  
 The subject’s behavior is likely to undermine the validity of his/her results .  
If a subjec t is discontinued from the study prematurely, the Investigator must provide an 
explanation in the eCRF and an Early Termintion Visit should be completed as soon as possible .  
If TreT  has been administered, the Investigator should make every effort to perfo rm all 
scheduled evaluations prior to discharge.  In the event that a subject discontinues TreT  
prematurely due to an AE, the subject will be followed until either the Investigator determines 
United Therapeutics Corp.  TIP-PH-101 Protocol Amendment 2  
 Treprostinil Inhalation Powder (TreT)  
Version Date 02 April 2020  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 45 that the AE has resolved, it is no longer considered clinically significant, the subject is lost to 
further follow -up, or for 30 days if the AE extends beyond the final visit.  
If a subject withdraws consent from either the optional biomarker and/or whole genome 
sequencing and/or requests sample destruction, the investi gator must document the request and 
inform the Sponsor.  The Sponsor will only keep data that are collected or generated up to the 
point at which consent to use the sample is withdrawn by the subject.  Withdrawal of consent 
from the optional biomarker and/ or optional whole genome sequencing does not affect consent to 
participate in any part of the analysis for which the subject has not withdrawn consent, nor does 
it affect consent to participate in the main clinical study . 
8.2 CRITERIA FOR TERMINA TING THE STUDY  
The study may be stopped at any time if, in the opinion of the Investigator and/or Sponsor, 
continuation of the study represents a serious medical risk to the subjects  or if the drug/device 
becomes commercially available .  This may include, but is not lim ited to, the presence of 
serious, life -threatening, or fatal AEs or AEs that are unacceptable in nature, severity, or 
frequency.  The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study for any reason at any time.   
8.3 CRITERIA FOR DISCONT INUING THE SITE  
The s tudy may also be terminated at a given center if:  
 The Investigator elects to discontinue the study  
 The Sponsor elects to discontinue the study at the site  
 US FDA, European, or other national regulations are not observed  
 The protocol is violated  
 Changes in personnel or facilities adversely affect performance of the study . 
9 ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING  
9.1 DEFINITIONS  
9.1.1 Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical experience occurring to a subject during the clinical study  
whether or not it is related to the study drug.   
United Therapeutics Corp.  TIP-PH-101 Protocol Amendment 2  
 Treprostinil Inhalation Powder (TreT)  
Version Date 02 April 2020  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 46 An AE may include  any of the following : 
 An intercurrent illness, injury, or any other concomitant impairment of the subject’s 
health, as well as abnormal laboratory findings if deemed to have clinical sign ificance.  
 A worsening of existing symptom or condition or post -treatment events that occur as a 
result of protocol -mandated procedures (eg, exacerbation of a pre -existing illness 
following the start of the study or an increase in frequency or intensity of  a pre -existing 
episodic event or condition).  
Thus, no causal relationship with the study drug is implied by the use of the term “adverse 
event.”  
An AE does not include the following:  
 Medical or surgical procedures ( eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extractio n, transfusion); 
however, the condition for which the surgery is required may be an AE.  
 Planned surgical measures permitted by the study protocol and the condition(s) leading to 
these measures are not AEs.  
 Day-to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease or  conditions present or detected at the 
start of the study that do not worsen.  
 Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred ( eg, hospitalizations 
for cosmetic elective surgery, social and/or convenience admissions).  
All AEs will be docum ented from the time of informed consent until the time screen failure is 
documented, or until the subject is either discontinued from the study or all End of Study Visit 
assessments have been completed . 
9.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is an AE occurring during the clinical study  that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
 Death  
 A life -threatening AE  
 Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
In addition, important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and require medical/surgical interve ntion to prevent 1 of the 
United Therapeutics Corp.  TIP-PH-101 Protocol Amendment 2  
 Treprostinil Inhalation Powder (TreT)  
Version Date 02 April 2020  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 47 outcomes listed above.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization, or the dev elopment of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Life-threatening means that the subject was, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred.  It does not mean that the event, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, migh t have caused death.  
9.2 DOCUMENTATION OF ADV ERSE EVENTS  
An AE or SAE occurring during the study must be documented in the subject’s source 
documents and on the appropriate eCRF page.  Information relating to the AE , such as onset and 
cessation date and times,  intensity, seriousness, relationship to study drug, and outcome , is also 
to be documented in the eCRF (see Section 9 and Appendix 15.2 for definitions).  Where 
possible, AEs should be recorded using standard medical terminology.  If several signs or 
symptoms are clearly related to a medically defined diagnosis or syndrome, t he diagnosis or 
syndrome should be recorded on the eCRF page, not the individual signs and symptoms.  
All AEs should be followed until either resolution (or return to normal or baseline values), until 
they are judged by the Investigator to no longer be clin ically significant, or for at least 30 days if 
the AE extends beyond the final visit.  All SAEs that occur during the study will be followed 
until resolution, death, or the subject is lost to follow -up even if they are ongoing more than 
30 days after compl etion of the final visit.  Supplemental measurements and/or evaluations may 
be necessary to investigate fully the nature and/or causality of an AE or SAE.  This may include 
additional laboratory tests, diagnostic procedures, or consultation with other heal thcare 
professionals.  The eCRF pages should be updated with any new or additional information as 
appropriate.  
The inhaler  to be used in this clinical study is identical in all aspects , including function,  to the 
inhaler of the  FDA -approved Afrezza drug-device combination  product  except for minor 
changes (these  changes do not change  drug delivery device performance) .  Any device 
complications associated with the use of the inhaler  reported by the subject/health professional 
will be forwarded by UTC to the d evice manufacturer according to the specified timeline.  
United Therapeutics Corp.  TIP-PH-101 Protocol Amendment 2  
 Treprostinil Inhalation Powder (TreT)  
Version Date 02 April 2020  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 48 9.3 REPORTING RESPONSIBI LITIES OF THE INVEST IGATOR  
Sites should enter initial or follow -up SAE information regardless of causality or expectedness 
into the Sponsor’s Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system (primary method)  within 24 hours of 
awareness of SAE.  The SAE will be directly transmitted from the EDC system to the Argus 
Safety Database.  If the site is unable to enter the SAE electronically into the EDC system, the 
alternative for reporting is submi tting the paper SAE Report Form via email to 
 or fax to  within 24 hours of awareness.  If the paper 
SAE Report Form is submitted, the site will also be required to enter the SAE data into the EDC  
system .  SAE source doc uments (eg, hospital discharge summary or death certificate) will be 
submitted by the site via email  or fax .  The 
Investigator or Sponsor (if appropriate) must also notify their Institutional Review Board (IRB), 
Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), and/or other local equivalent body of the reported SAE, 
including any follow -up information.  Copies of each report and documentation of 
IEC/IRB/local equivalent body notification and receipt will be kept in the Clinical 
Investigator’s study file.  
9.4 SAFETY REPORTS  
In accordance with national regulations, the Sponsor will notify the appropriate regulatory  
authority(ies)  and all participating Investigators of any AE that is considered to be possibly  
attributable to study drug a nd is both serious and unexpected.  The Investigator must report  these 
AEs to their IRB or Ethics Committee ( EC) in accordance with applicable national  regulations 
and guidelines set forth by the IRB or EC.  
9.5 PREGNANCY  
If a study subject becomes pregnant dur ing participation in this clinical study, site staff must 
notify the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy by completing the Pregnancy 
Notification and Outcome Form and submitting via fax or e -mail to Global Drug Safety at UTC  
) and withdraw the subject from the study .  The 
United Therapeutics Global Drug Safety department will follow  up with the Investigator to 
ensure appropriate data are provided regarding the outcome of the pregnancy, and to ask the 
Investigator to update the Pregnancy Notification Form.  Pregnancy only becomes an AE/SAE if 

United Therapeutics Corp.  TIP-PH-101 Protocol Amendment 2  
 Treprostinil Inhalation Powder (TreT)  
Version Date 02 April 2020  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 49 there is an abnormal outcome, a spontaneous abortion, an elective termination for medical 
reasons, or a congenital anomaly in the offspring.  
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 DATA PROCESSING  
The results of assessments will be transcribed into an eCRF for each subject who signs an ICF 
until study completion, or study discontinuation for any reason.  A representative from the 
sponsor will verify eCRF data fields ag ainst source documentation.  All data transmitted from 
the site will be reviewed and entered into a quality assured computerized database.  Data 
clarifications will be generated, and the database will be edited as appropriate.  The eCRF 
screens are to be r eviewed by the Investigator for completeness and accuracy.  The Investigator 
must electronically sign each subject’s eCRF to signify his/her approval of the data.  The 
Investigator will be required to re -sign an eCRF if changes are made to a subject’s eCRF  by the 
site after the Investigator initially signs the eCRF.   The database will be final when all 
outstanding queries have been resolved and all data management quality assurance procedures 
are complete.  
10.2 SAMPLE SIZE  
Total sample size is planned to be 45 s ubjects.  No formal sample size calculation has been 
conducted.  
10.3 ANALYSIS PLAN  
All PK and safety data will be listed and summarized in tables .   
10.3.1  Pharmacokinetic  Analysis  
PK parameters  of treprostinil  (Cmax, time of maximal plasma concentration,  t½, and AUC  from 
time 0 to 300  minutes  [AUC 0-300]) will be obtained from the resulting plasma drug concentration -
time data .  Plasma concentrations of treprostinil above the lower limit of quantitation will be 
used to calculate AUC 0-300 and C max for each treatment.  P K parameters will be compared 
between Tyvaso and TreT and among all dose levels.  PK parameters will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics.

The Investigator is responsible for TreT  accountabili ty and reconciliation overall and on a 
per-subject basis.  Drug accountability records are to be maintained during the study , and these 
records include, but are not limited to the amount of TreT  received from the Sponsor, the amount 
dispensed to each subje ct, and the amount of used/unused TreT returned to the site by the 
subject.  
At each visit, site personnel will:  
 Collect and document all inhalers and all TreT cartridges  and/or blister packaging  
returned by the subject (both used and unused).  
 Compute study drug compliance using the dosing instructions given to the subject since 
the previous study visit and the amount of TreT cartridge s and/or blister packaging 
returned.  
 Re-educate the subject about the importance of following the prescribed dos ing regimen 
(if compliance is low).  
 
Once a representative from the Sponsor is able to confirm drug accountability for a completed 
subject, TreT  cartidges and/or blister packaging will be returned to a Sponsor -designated 
location for destruction and/or des troyed onsite per institutional policy.  All used and unused 
inhalers  will be collected by the Sponsor for additional testing .  In the event of device 
malfunction, at any point during the study, the inhalers should be returned to the Sponsor.

15.1 PROCEDURES FOR A 6 -MINUTE WALK TEST  
General Procedures  
The 6MWT should be administered by the same tester at each  study site throughout the study, 
whenever possible .  The administration of the test and specifications of the testing area should be 
generally consistent with the American Thoracic Society guidelines and the usual practice of the 
investigative site  (ATS Statement  2002).  Subjects receiving supplemental oxygen during the 
Baseline 6MWT must continue to receive the same flow rate  at the Week  3 6MWT.   
The area used for the 6MWT should be pre -measured at approximately 30 m in length and at 
least 2 to 3 m in width.  There must be no turns or significant curves to the 6MWT area.  The 
length should be marked with gradations to ensure the accurate measurement of the distance 
walked.  The area should be well ventilated.  The tester may be at the starting end of the corridor 
or at the midpoint of the corridor with a stop -watch.  Intermittent rest periods are allowed if the 
subject can no longer continue.  If the subject needs to rest briefly, he/she may stand or sit and 
then begin again when he/she is sufficiently rested but the clock will continue to run.  The 
subject may use ambulatory aids if needed.  At the end of 6  minutes, the tester will call “stop 
where you are” while simultaneously stopping the watch and then measure the distance walked.   
Instructions to the Subject  
Subjects will be instructed that the preceding meal should be light.  Subjects should be told to 
wear comfortable clothing and sneakers or comfortable walking shoes.  The person 
administering the test will use the following exact  dialogue with the subject:  
“The purpose of this test is to find out how far you can walk in 6 minutes.  You will start 
from this point and follow the hallway to the marker (eg, chair) at the end, turn around and 
walk back.  When you arrive back at the starting point you will go back  and forth again.  
You will go back and forth as many times as you can in the 6 -minute period.  You may 
stop and rest if you need to.  Just remain where you are until you can go on again.  
However, the most important thing about the test is that you cover as much ground as you 
possibly can during the 6 minutes.  I will tell you the time, and I will let you know when 
the 6 minutes are up.  When I say ‘STOP, ’ please stand right where you are.”

 Treprostinil Inhalation Powder (TreT)  
Version Date 02 April 2020  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 58 After these instructions are given to the subject, the person admi nistering the test will then ask:  
“Do you have  any questions about the test?”  
The person administering the test will then start the test by saying the following to the subject:  
“Are you ready?”  
“Start when I say ‘GO.’” 
The person administering the test wil l tell the subject the time at each minute  by saying:  
“You have 5 minutes to go .” 
“You have 4 minutes to go .” 
“You have 3 minutes to go .” 
“You have 2 minutes to go .” 
“You have 1 minute to go .” 
At 6 minutes, the person administering the test will tell the s ubject:  
“Stop where you are .” 
No other instruction or encouragement will be given during the test.  Eye contact with the subject 
should be avoided during the test.

 Treprostinil Inhalation Powder (TreT)  
Version Date 02 April 2020  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 59 15.2 GUIDELINES AND DEFIN ITIONS FOR RECORDING  ADVERSE EVENTS  
The Investigator  or a designated member of his/her staff will probe each subject for any AEs that 
may have occurred.  The Investigator  should always ask the same question when conducting the 
verbal probe in order to ensure uniformity between subjects.  The Investigator  should ask:  
“How are you doing (feeling)?”  
Based on the subject’s response to this question, the Investigator  should ask additional questions 
relevant to the specific complaint such as:  
“How severe is/was the symptom?”  
“How often did the symptom occur?”  
“How  long did the symptom last?”  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review the results of all diagnostic and laboratory tests as 
they become available and ascertain if there is a clinically significant change from baseline.  If 
the results are determin ed to be a clinically significant change from baseline, this should be 
reported as an AE.  The Investigator may repeat the diagnostic procedure or laboratory test or 
request additional tests to verify the results of the original tests.  When possible, a di agnosis 
associated with the abnormality should be used as the reported AE.  
Using provided definitions, the Investigator  will then:  
(1) rate the intensity and seriousness of the AE, (2) estimate the causality of the AE to study 
drug, and (3)  note actions ta ken to counteract the AE.  
Definitions of Intensity, Seriousness, Causality, Action Taken, and Outcome  
INTENSITY  
An assessment of the relative intensity (severity) of an AE is based on the Investigator ’s clinical 
judgment.  The maximum intensity encountered  during the evaluation period should be checked.  
The assessment of intensity should be independent of the assessment of the seriousness of the 
AE.

An SAE is one that represents an actual or potential significant hazard.  This includes, but  is not 
limited to, an event that is fatal, life -threatening, permanently or severely disabling, requires or 
prolongs inpatient hospitalization, is a congenital abnormality (offspring of subject) , or is 
medically significant (important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, 
or require hospitalization may be considered a n SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent 1 of the outcomes l isted in this definition).  
Hospitalizations that would not be considered SAEs include those for:  
 Routine treatment or monitoring of the study indication not associated with any 
deterioration in condition (eg, hospitalization for a routine right heart cathe terization ). 
 Treatment which was elective or pre -planned, for a pre -existing condition not associated 
with any deterioration in condition (eg, pre -planned operation which does not lead to 
further complications , etc). 
 Treatment of an emergency, in an outpat ient setting for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of serious as given above and not resulting in hospital admission.  
CAUSALITY  
An estimate of causality between a specified AE and the study drug is made by the Investigator .  
Several factors sh ould be considered when determining causality.  These factors include 
temporal relationship and response to withdrawal or reintroduction of the study drug.  
Definitions of the causality  categories are as follow s: 
 NOT RELATED – There is not a temporal relat ionship to study drug administration (too 
early, or late, or study drug not taken), or there is a reasonable causal relationship 
between another drug, or  concurrent disease and the SAE, or any of the following:  
 An event that precedes the first administration of study drug  
 An event for which the cause is clearly related to an external event  
 Temporal relationship to study drug is atypical  
 Is readily explained by an intercurrent illness AND has an expected level of severity, 
duration, and resolutio n 
 An alternative explanation (concomitant drug, intercurrent illness) is likely  
 POSSIBLE  – There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the 
SAE.  Dechallenge information is lacking or unclear, study drug administration was not 
modif ied in response to the SAE, or any of the following:

Version Date 02 April 2020  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 61  Has a reasonable temporal relationship to study drug  
 The event has a plausible biological link to the activity of the study drug  
 Is unlikely to be related to an intercurrent illness or has an unexpected degree of 
severity, duration , or complication  
 PROBABLE  – There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the 
SAE.  The event responds to dechallenge —the event resolves or improves with 
modification of study drug administration .  Rechal lenge (the original study drug was 
restarted) is not required, or any of the following:  
 Has a reasonable temporal relationship to study drug  
 The event has a plausible biologic link to the activity of the study drug  
 Not readily explained by an intercurrent illness  
 Not readily explained by external event  
 Improves on discontinuation of study drug  
 If study drug has been discontinued, may recur or reintroduction of study drug  
ACTION TAKE N 
STUDY DRUG  DOSE MODIFICATION*  
 Dose Not Changed – The dose or regimen of th e study drug  was not changed.  
 Dose Increased – The dose or regimen of study drug was increased .  
 Dose Decreased – The dose or regimen of study drug was decreased . 
 Drug Interrupted – Administration of the study drug  was stopped temporarily . 
 Drug Withdrawn – Administration of the study drug  was stopped permanently and not 
restarted . 
 Unknown – Changes to the administration of the study drug  cannot be determined . 
 Not Applicable  
NOTE:  Only the last study drug action should be recorded in the eCRF.  For example, if the 
study drug is withdrawn and then the decision is made to restart, the dose modification of “Drug 
interrupted” should be reported on the SAE form.  
OUTCOME  
 Fatal – The study subject died . 
 Not Recovered/Not Resolved – The AE was ongoing  at the  time of death or at the time 
the subject was lost to follow up.  
 Recovered/Resolved – The AE resolved . 
 Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae – The AE is conside red resolved ; however , there is 
residual sequelae.   Some events do not return to baseline, such as me tastasis or 
progression of disease; however, once these events are determined by the Investigator to

with sequelae.  
 Recovering/Resolving – The AE is improving but is n ot yet completely 
recovered/resolved . 
 Unknown – The outcome o f the AE cannot be determined.

improvement in heart failure functional class, quality of life, left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular end-systolic volume 12,13. We 14-18 and others 19 have recently shown that low level vagus nerve stimulation (LLVNS), at voltages substantially below the threshold for slowing the sinus rate or AV conduction, suppressed AF inducibility and decreased the duration of AF episodes that were induced by strong cholinergic stimulation. In those experiments, LLVNS applied to both vagal trunks dissected in the neck 14-16, to the right vagus nerve alone 18, or to the vagal preganglionic fibers at the posterior wall of the superior vena cava 17, exerted equally strong anti-arrhythmic effects.  The anti-inflammatory properties of the VN have been recently recognized 20,21. The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway can be activated experimentally by electrical VN stimulation to inhibit inflammatory cytokine production (including TNF-Į), prevent tissue injury and improve survival in multiple experimental models of systemic inflammation and sepsis 20-24. A substantial body of evidence suggests that AF and inflammatory pathways have a bidirectional relationship 25. Several studies suggested that inflammation may confer an increased risk of AF. In a large population-based study, CRP levels predicted both the presence of AF at baseline and the development of AF during follow-up, even after adjustment for other known cardiovascular risk factors, and the risk of AF was progressively higher with increasing CRP quartiles 26. In a recent experimental study, TNF-Į overexpressing mice developed spontaneous episodes of AF and were found to have electrophysiological and structural changes known to promote AF, including increased calcium transient and atrial fibrosis 27. Whether AF is the cause or the consequence of inflammation cannot be determined on the basis of the available evidence. Based on the observation that transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the tragus, the anterior protuberance of the outer ear, where the auricular branch of the vagus nerve is located, elicits evoked potentials in the brainstem in humans 28, we examined the effects of low-level tragus stimulation (LLTS) for inhibiting AF in a canine model of rapid atrial pacing 29. Notably, the anti-arrhythmic effects of LLTS were similar to those of LLVNS delivered to the cervical vagus nerve trunk 29. We recently translated these results into patients with drug-refractory AF undergoing AF ablation, and showed that LLTS for just one hour significantly shortened the AF duration, and suppressed inflammatory cytokines, indicating that neuromodulation by LLTS is a very promising, non-invasive therapy to treat AF and AF-related inflammation 30. Before these results can be translated into clinical practice, the long-term clinical efficacy of this approach needs to be shown in ambulatory patients with AF. It has been recently shown that transcutaneous VN stimulation applied for just 15 minutes in healthy volunteers increases heart rate variability (HRV) and reduces sympathetic nerve activity 31. In this study, we hypothesize that intermittent (1 hour daily) LLTS for 6 months may decrease AF burden and suppress inflammatory cytokines in patients with paroxysmal AF. These investigations will establish the first evidence of the long-term effects of LLTS on AF suppression in patients with paroxysmal AF and may provide the basis for a potential expansion of the therapeutic targets of this treatment modality beyond AF, into other inflammatory conditions, including atherosclerosis 32.

LLTS suppresses AF in dogs: We studied the effects of transcutaneous electrical stimulation at the tragus for inhibiting AF. In 10 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs, LLTS (20 Hz) in the right ear 
was accomplished by attaching two alligator clips onto the tragus. The voltage slowing the sinus rate was used as the threshold for setting the LLTS at 80% below threshold. The antiarrhythmic effects of LLTS were similar to those of LLVNS delivered to the cervical VN trunk (Figure 1A). In contrast, LLTS after transection of both VN failed to show any antiarrhythmic effect, indicating that the efferent VN are essential for its antiarrhythmic effects (Figure 1B). We concluded that LLTS can reverse RAP-induced atrial remodeling and inhibit AF inducibility, suggesting a potential non-invasive treatment for AF 29.  Neuromodulation suppresses AF and inflammation in humans: We have recently shown that transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve at the tragus (low-level tragus stimulation; LLTS) in humans has antiarrhythmic and anti-inflammatory effects 30. Forty patients with paroxysmal AF who presented in sinus rhythm for AF ablation, were randomized to either 1 hour of LLTS (n=20) or control (n=20). LLTS in the right ear, 50% lower than the voltage that slowed the sinus rate, was accomplished by attaching a flat metal clip onto the tragus. Under general anesthesia, AF was induced at baseline and after 1 hour of LLTS or sham stimulation and were analyzed for inflammatory cytokines, LQFOXGLQJ71)ĮDQG&53XVLQJDPXOWLSOH[LPPXQRDVVD\3DFLQJ-induced AF duration decreased significantly by 6.3±1.9 min compared to baseline in the LLTS group, but not in the control (p=0.002 for comparison between groups; Figure 2A). AF cycle length increased significantly from baseline by 28.8±6.5ms in the LLTS group, but not in the control (p=0.0002 for comparison between groups). Systemic (femoral vein) but not coronary sinus TNFĮ and CRP levels decreased significantly only in the LLTS group (Figure 2B). Importantly, the magnitude of decrease in TNF-Į levels by LLTS was comparable with the difference between patients with active vs. inactive inflammatory diseases 33. We concluded that LLTS acutely suppresses AF and decreases inflammatory cytokines in patients with paroxysmal AF, supporting the emerging paradigm of

neuromodulation to treat AF 30. The results of this study were published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology 30.  D. Research design and Methods Specific Aim 1: To examine the effect of intermittent (1 hour daily) LLTS on AF burden in patients with paroxysmal AF over a 6-month period. This is a prospective double-blind randomized controlled study. Patients with paroxysmal AF, documented by ECG, pacemaker/implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) electrogram or Holter monitor, within 3 months of randomization on 2 separate occasions, at least 1 day apart, of at least 30 seconds duration, will be eligible for inclusion in the study.  Patients will be excluded if they have any of the following: 1. Left ventricular dysfunction (Left ventricular ejection fraction <40%) 2. Significant valvular disorder (i.e., prosthetic valve or hemodynamically relevant valvular diseases)  3. Recent (<6 months) stroke or myocardial infarction  4. Severe heart failure (NYHA IV) 5. Left atrial dilatation (>55mm) 6. Recurrent vaso-vagal syncopal episodes 7. Unilateral or bilateral vagotomy 8. Sick sinus syndrome, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block, bifascicular block or prolonged (PR>300ms) 1st degree AV block Patients will be recruited from the inpatient services and outpatient clinics of the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. A meeting with all study personnel to review the study protocol will be held before initiation of the study, as well as every 3-6 months, depending on study progress. Informed consent will be obtained prior to enrollment in the study. The randomization schedule will be implemented with the use of concealed envelopes and it will be stratified by sex. Blocked randomization will be used to decrease the chance of imbalances in the two groups over time. After informed consent and screening procedures are completed, all patients will undergo noninvasive continuous ECG monitoring for 2 weeks to evaluate their AF burden (the percent of time spent in AF) using an adhesive waterproof continuous monitoring patch (Zio® Patch). The Zio® Patch (iRhythm Technologies, Inc) is an FDA approved, single-lead, lightweight, 14-day ambulatory ECG adhesive patch monitor. The patch is well tolerated and allows significantly longer continuous monitoring than a regular Holter monitor, leading to an improved AF detection rate 34. After the 2-week monitoring period, patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to active or sham LLTS. Patients will be blinded to the treatment allocation, and every effort will be made to conceal from the study personnel the nature of the intervention in each study arm. Blinding of the patients will be accomplished by having a sham control arm, in which stimulation will be delivered to a different site (the ear lobe), devoid of vagal innervation 35. By doing so, all patients will be aware that they are receiving stimulation, but they will not be told which site achieves active VN

Specific Aim 2: To examine the effect of intermittent (1 hour daily) LLTS on inflammatory cytokines and their gene expression in patients with paroxysmal AF over a 6-month period. The same group assignment described in Aim 1 will be used for Aim 2. The importance of this Aim is highlighted by accumulating evidence that inflammation promotes the persistence of AF 25,41. Blood samples (10ml) will be collected at baseline and at 3 and 6 months for cytokine measurement. Samples will be centrifuged (4000g for 10 min), and serum will be stored in aliquots at -20°C until assayed. Patients’ serum will be saved frozen and processed in batches of 10 to 12. The investigators performing the cytokine assays will be blinded to group assignment. All assays will be run at the Humphrey Lab at OUHSC. Inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-Į, and IL-6, will be measured using commercially available immunoassays analyzed on a flow cytometer (multiplex assays). In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be isolated using MACS magnetic bead purification. Inflammatory cytokine gene expression profile will be measured at the above time points, using commercially available microarrays. Finally, we will perform exploratory analyses in order to determine relationships between clinical and cytokine responses to LLTS and identify predictors of response based on baseline cytokine levels. It is known that vagus nerve stimulation attenuates inflammation through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway 20-24. If this pathway is important in AF as well, we expect that the decrease in cytokines will be correlated with the anti-arrhythmic effect.   Duration of participation Enrolled patients will participate for a maximum of 7 months with 3 outpatient office visits at 1, 3 and 6 months. Patient enrollment A maximum of 52 patients meeting the inclusion criteria and not meeting the exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. The enrollment period is expected to last for at least 17 months, given that on average 30 patients with paroxysmal AF are seen in our clinics each month and assuming that 1 out of 4 eligible patients would agree to participate in the study.   Data collection and analysis The final data will be pooled and analyzed by the investigators.    E. Statistical methods The primary outcome of this study is the percent of time spent in AF over the monitoring period (AF burden) at the 6-month time point. Secondary outcomes include total duration of AF over the 2-week monitoring period, longest daily duration of AF, measures of HRV and serum cytokine levels. Outcomes will be compared between groups using a Generalized Estimating Equations modeling approach, with 3 time points (baseline, 3 months, 6 months) and 4 terms included in the model (group effect, time effect, group by time interaction, adjustment for baseline measure).

      IRB NUMBER: 5631 IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/10/2017   
Significant interactions will be followed by time trend analyses stratified by intervention group. If the interaction is not significant, the interaction term will be dropped from the model and the between-group comparisons will be made by combining the 3-month and 6-month data. For all pair-wise testing, we will adjust for multiple comparisons using Tukey’s method. The modeling assumptions will be evaluated by plotting the residuals by the predicted values (for the constant variance assumption) and comparing the normal QQ plot with the QQ plot of the residuals (for the normality assumption). If the modeling assumptions are not satisfied, we will perform a natural log transformation of the data, to better satisfy these assumptions. For 0 values, a value of 0.01 will be added to each measure before applying the natural log. Analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. In post-hoc exploratory analyses, we will use logistic regression analysis to identify predictors of clinical and cytokine response to LLTS, defined as a decrease of AF burden and a decrease in cytokines at 6-month follow-up, respectively. Those variables that which are associated with response to LLTS in univariate analysis at p<0.1 will be entered into a multivariate logistic regression model, using a backward elimination method to identify the most parsimonious model. In light of the limited sample size, such analyses will be underpowered and will be considered hypothesis-generating only. Statistical significance will be declared at p<0.05.  Sample size and power calculations: For purposes of sample size calculations we have simplified the analysis to focus on the AF burden at the 6-month time point between the 2 groups. Assuming a mean±standard deviation AF burden in the control group of 28.4±31.2% 34 and a 87% reduction in the LLTS group  to 3.7% (assuming a common standard deviation of 31.2%), 26 patients per group would provide 80% power to detect the specified effect sizes at a two-VLGHGVLJQLILFDQFHĮlevel of 0.05. Approximately 30 patients with paroxysmal AF are seen in our clinics each month. Assuming that 1 out of 4 eligible patients would agree to participate in the study, we should be able to enroll the required number of patients within the proposed 17 months, allowing for 6 months of additional follow up and a final month for data analysis.   F. Gender/Minority/Pediatric Inclusion for Research Participants will be age 21 or older. Race, minority status and gender will not affect enrollment. G. Human participants The study population will include 52 male/female patients with paroxysmal AF, aged 21 or older, including all races. Since AF is extremely rare in patients less than 21 years old, this age limit is not expected to affect the overall results.  Inclusion Criteria: 1. Male and female patients older than 21 year old  2. Paroxysmal AF  Exclusion Criteria:

Identify sources of research material in the form of specimens, records or data. The research information will consist of the AF burden and serum inflammatory cytokines at each time point specified in the protocol (see Figure 4).  3.  Describe plans for recruitment and consent procedures to be followed. a.  Describe the location where consent is most likely to take place (will consent be obtained while an inpatient, in the ER/ICU, will consents be mailed with follow-up meeting to discuss the consent, etc.). Patients will be recruited from the inpatient services and outpatient clinics of the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. All candidate subjects will have the purpose of the study explained to them, including the benefits and risks and options, prior to scheduled ablation procedure, will be asked to read the consent form, and after questions have been answered, will be asked to participate. Finally, they will be asked to sign the consent form.  b. Describe provisions for recruiting non-English speaking participants. Only English-speaking persons will be recruited. Non-English-speaking adults constitute less than 1% of the patients referred for ablation. c.   Describe measures to decrease coercion of participants (allowing adequate time to review the consent, avoid recruitment of your own private patients – or have a qualified assistant assist with the consent of these individuals, avoid recruiting employees or staff to serve as controls, etc.).  Patients will have adequate time to review the consent. Recruiting of employees or staff by the principal investigator will be avoided.  3. Describe risks and assess likelihood and seriousness.

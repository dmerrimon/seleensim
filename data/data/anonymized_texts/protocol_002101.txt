Trial  center(s): This trial will be conducted at multiple trial centers located in the United States  (US), 
 Canada,  and Europe  
Phase of development: 3 
Objectives:  
Primary: 
• To compare the pharmacokinetics (PK ) of the  once daily  (QD) and once week ly  (QW ) formulations 
 of setmelanotide 
 Seconda ry:  
• To asses s the safety of the QW  formulation of setmelanotide with up to 6  months (26 week s) of drug 
 administration 
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
    
Methodology:  
This trial is designed to compare the safety, PK, and nd   of the QW and QD formulations of 
 setmelanotide, as wel l as to evaluate the safety and   ofof up to 6 months of  QW setmelanotide 
 administration in patients with Bardet -Biedl syndroommee ( (BBBBS)S), biallelic PPL ( POMC [pro -
opiomelanocortin], PCSK1 [proprotein conve rtase subtilisin/kexin Type  1], LEPR [leptin receptor]), or 
 heterozygous PPL. Eligible  patients are those wh o are currently taking QD set melanotide in 
 Trial RM-493 -022, referred to as the long -term extension (LTE)  trial, for at least 6  months with 
 accep table safety and tolerability, and who w ish to continue with setmelanotide treatment, and w ho 
 otherwise meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Approximately 30  patients will be targeted in 3  age 
groups  as follows:  approximately 20 patients who are ≥18  years old; approximately 6 patients ≥12 to 
<18 years old; and approximately 4 patients ≥6  to <12 years old at the time of trial entry.  
The trial consists of a S creening Period for transition from the LTE trial, a Run-in Period  of up to 1 week  
of continuation on the patient’s current dose level of QD set melanotide (2, 2.5, or 3 mg), a 13-week

The patient will have a Run -in Period of 1 day t o 1 week  on QD set melanotide at the dose they were on in 
 the LTE trial. The first day  of the Run-in Period (Visit 2) should coincide with the patient’s last visit in 
 the LTE trial to avoid an interruption of treatment. On the first day  of the Run -in Period , patients will 
 have serial blood samples taken for measurement of setmelanotide concentrations (QD f ormulation) and 
24-hour  PK profiles wi ll be performed.  
On Day  1 (Visit 3) , patient s will be randomized 1:1 to receive either QD o r QW  setmelanotide. Patients 
 who were on QD set melanotide at a dose of 2  mg at the time of trial entry will be randomized to receive 
 either QD set melanotide 2  mg or QW setmelanotide at a dose of 20  mg, whereas patients who were on 
 QD set melanotide at a dose of 2.5  mg will be randomized to receive either QD s etmelanotide 2.5  mg or 
 QW setmelanotide at a dose of 25  mg, and finally  patients who were on QD set melanotide at a dose of 
 3 mg will be randomized to receive either QD s etmelanotide 3  mg or QW  setmelanotide at a dose of 
 30 mg. Study medication  will be administered in a doubl e -dummy fashion in order to maintain the double  
blind. Patients will receive the first QW  dose on Day 1 of the randomized treatment period  (Visit 3) . The 
randomization will be stratified by age group.   
• Patients randomized to QW setmelanotide will receive blinded  QW setmelanotide and QD p lacebo 
 injections until the Week  14 visit (ie, completion of  13 weeks of blinded dose administration) . 
Starting with  Week  14, patients will continue with open-label QW in jection s of setmelanotide 
 during  the 13 -week  non -random ized phase.  
• Patients randomized to QD set melanotide will receive blinded  QD set melanotide and QW  placebo  
injections  until the Week  14 visit (ie, completion of  13 weeks of blinded dose  administration). 
 Starting with  Week  14, patients will continue with open-label QW in jection s of setmelanotide 
 during  the 13 -week  non -random ized phase.  
Prior to the QW dose of study dr ug at prespecified time points  during the double -blind treatment phase,  
predose blood samples will be collected for trough plasma drug concentrations in all patients. At 
Week  14, serial blood samples (including a predose blood s ample) will be  taken for measurement of 
 steady -state setmelanotide concentrations (QD an d QW formulations) for a 24-hour PK profile .  
For the 3-week  Follow-up Period, all patients will return to their run -in dos e of QD  setmelanotide. The 
trial design is depicted in the figure below.

The safety and tolerability of setmelanotide will be assess ed by the frequency and severity of adverse 
 events (AEs)/serious adverse ev ents (SAEs) and injection site reactions (ISRs), as wel l as changes in 
 physical examination  (to include comprehensive skin examination) , electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital 
 signs (including resting bl ood pr essure [BP] and he art rate [HR]), routine laboratory evaluations , 
development of anti -drug antibodies, and the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) . 
  
   
Number of patients (planned):  
It is intended that a total of ~30 patients will be enrolled in the trial. Patients will come from 3  targeted 
 age groups :  ≥18 years old (~20 patients), ≥12  to <18 years old (~ 6 patients), and ≥6  to <12 years old 
 (~4 patients).

Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  9 of 68   Duration of treatment:  
Total duration of treatment with setmelanotide in this trial will be ~3 0 week s: a Run-in P eriod of 1 day to 
 1 week  on QD set melanotide, 13  week s on randomized setmelanotide treatment (QD o r QW ), 13 week s 
 on non-randomized QW setmelanotide, followed by 3 week s on the QD f ormulation.  
Reference therapy, dosage and m ode of administration:  
QD or QW matching pl acebo for SC injection. Placebo is vehicle only and is identical in appearance to 
active treatment. 
Criteria for evaluation:  
Primary Endpoint:  
• Comparison of  s teady -state PK parameters ( maximum plasma concentration [Cmax,], time to 
 maximum plasma concentration [Tmax], trough plasma concentration [Ctrough], area unde r the 
 plasma concentration -time curve over the dosing interval  [AUC 0-tau]) for QW  compared with QD 
 setmelanotide 
 Seconda ry Endpoint:  
• Safety out comes, including AEs/SAEs, ISRs, and  changes in laboratory parameters, vital signs, 
 ECG recordings, and ph ysical examination findings, etc.   
   
  
   
   
   
   
  
   
   
  
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
Statistical methods:  
The primary objective is to asses s steady -state PK parameters (Cmax, Tmax, Ctrough, AUC 0-tau) for QW 
 compared with QD set melanotide. The sample size is based on availability of the patients enrolled in the 
 LTE trial and is not driven by formal statistical hypot hesis testing on no n-inferiority/similarity. 
The PK profile of the 2 formulations of setmelanotide will be characterized and the steady -state PK 
parameters (Cmax, Tmax, Ctrough, and AUC 0-tau) will be summarized for QD an d QW  setmelanotide by dose

2. SCHE DULE OF ACTIVITIES  
The Schedule of Activities (S oA) to be conduc ted are depicted in Table  1.  
Any patient withdrawing from the trial will complete the Early Termin ation Visit, if possible.   
Screening Period: To ensure continuity of treatment, informed consent for this trial will be 
obtained and eligibility of the patient will be confirmed before the patient is withdrawn from the  
long- term extension  (LTE) trial. Visit procedures from the last visit of the LTE trial  and first 
 visit of this  trial are not intended to be dupl icated. Thus, any repeat assess ments do not need to 
 be conduc ted and da ta from the last visit of the LTE trial will be used as Visit 1 data in this trial, 
as ap plicable.  
Run-in Period: Day 1 of  the Run- in Period should coincide with the patient’s last visit in the LTE 
 trial to avoid an interruption of treatment.  The patient will have a R un -in Period of 1  day to 
 1 week on Q D setmelanotide at the dose they were on in the LTE trial.

the trial center . On the days of in-person  clinic visits, the patients/caretakers will self -administer/administer the QD dose of study drug  in the clinic in the 
 presence of the clinical staff to assure proper technique. For accountability, patients/caretakers will return all used vials to the clinic when they visit; the trial

 profiles are done, the predose (trough) PK sample will be drawn within 30  minutes prior to any study drug administration. No visit window is allowed for 
 Week  14, which must occur exactly 7  days after the Week  13 (V15) dose administration. (i.e., if the Week  13 (V15) visit occurs on Day 86, the Week  14 
(V16) visit must occur on Day 93). Patients /caretakers will be reminded that there should be NO study drug administration at home on the day of cl inic visits; 
 the drug will be administered in the clinic AFTER the predose PK sample is obtained. For the PK sample, the actual collection  (clock) time will be recorded, 
 as well as the time of the previous day’s study drug injection as reported by the pati ent/caretaker.  
14 Patients will undergo serial blood samples taken for measurement of steady -state setmelanotide concentrations (both QD and QW) and PK profiles will be 
 performed. On the first day of the Run- in Period, blood samples for the QD PK profile will be drawn within 30 minutes prior to dose administration . Postdose 
 samples will be collected a t: 0.5, 1, 2  (±5 mins), 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours  (±30 min). At minimum, mandatory postdose samples must be collected at: 6 and 
8 hours  (±30 min)  and at 24 hours (±30 min) . At Week  14, blood samples for the PK profiles will be drawn within 30 minutes prior to dose administration. 
 Postdose samples will be collected at: 0.5, 1, 2  (±5 mins) , 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 168 hours (±30 min). At minimum, mandatory postdose samples 
 must be collected at:  6 and 8 hours (±30 min) , 24 hours (± 30 min) , 48, 72, 96, 120 hours (±30 min) , and 168 hours (±30 min)  In case of significant challenges 
 with the collection of  any PK  sample, the investigator s hould confirm  sample  prioritization with the sponsor. Patients/caretakers will be reminded that there 
 should be NO study drug administration at home on the day of clinic visits and that the predose (trough) blood draw must occu r PRIOR to study drug 
 adminis tration. The blood draws for the Week 14 PK sampling must occur exactly 7 days after the prior visit. The Investigators will adhere to the site -specific 
 blood volume  limits for safety laboratory and PK analyses both to ensure minimal distress and reduce th e number of venipunctures in pediatric patients. For 
 patients <18 years of age, it may not be possible to  collect all labs at every trial visit, though efforts should be made to collect as many PK samples per 
 protocol. Venipuncture reduction is allowed sho uld a patient <18 years of age experience unacceptable discomfort as deemed by the Investigator.  
15 Injection site evaluations and scoring (by the clinical staff) will include identification of areas of erythema, edema, and i nduration, as well as the presence of 
 localized pain, tenderness, and itching. At in -person trial visits, the clinical staff will also record measurements of areas of erythema, edema, and induration  if 
possible.  Unscheduled evaluations may also be recorded as warranted by clinical conditions . 
16 Safety laboratory tests will include: complete blood count  with platelet count and standard indices, chemistry panel, coagulation, and urinalysis with 
 microscopic analysis (if positive findings on dipsticks warrant further examinati on). For patients <18 years of age, it may not be possible to collect all 
 laboratory samples at every trial visit. Screening may be performed over multiple days, to complete the required assessments.  After enrolllmmeenntt,,  iiff  nnoott  aallll  llaab

Protocol  RM-493- 037 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  24 of 68   3. INTRODUCTION  
3.1. Rationale for the Trial  
Obesity is a multifactorial disease caused by va rious environmental, neurobehavioral, 
immunological, endoc rine, medical, and ge netic/epigene tic factors or a complex interplay 
 between 2  or more o f these factors ( Maes 1 997 ; Schous boe 2003 ;  Silventoinen 2010 ; Hall 2012 ;  
Pigeyre 2016;  Sheikh 20 17; Thaker 2017). In a subset of individuals with obesity, rare genetic 
 variants may result in severe obesity. The identification of key genetic determinants of the 
neuronal pathways and signaling m olecules (e.g., leptin) regulating appetite and body w eight has 
led to the discovery of multiple rare genetic disorders of obesity  (RGD O)  (van der Klaauw 
 2015 ). A key neuronal pathway, the central melanocortin and melanocortin- 4 receptor (MC4R) 
 pathway, plays an important role in appetite, hun ger, and energy ut ilization. T he melanocortins 
are a family of peptide hormones (including adrenocorticotropic hormone , α-melanocyte-
 stimulating hormone [ MSH ], β-MSH, and γ -MSH) derived from the commo n precursor, pro -
opiomelanocortin ( POMC). Originating in the hypothalamus, the MC4R pathway  concertedly 
 modulates appetite (feelings of hung er and satiety), energy intake (as caloric consumption), and 
energy expenditure (basal metabolism, thermogenesis, and physical activity) to define long- term 
body w eight. 
In hum ans and animal models, ge netic defects in the MC4R pathway, such as POMC deficiency, 
 result in severe forms of early -onset obesity and hype rphagia ( Farooqi 2008). P atients with rare 
 genetic variants in leptin receptor (LEPR) and patients with Bardet -Biedl syndrome ( BBS, a rare 
 pleiotropic autosomal recessi ve disorder caused by mutations in as m any as 24 di fferent genes) 
also present with unr emitting hung er and severe obesity caused in part by a lack of activation of  
the MC4R pathway. As a result of hyperphagia, individuals with RGDO have increased calorie 
intake leading to early -onset, severe obesity, and obe sity -related comorbidities such as type 2 
 diabetes.  The Spons or is developing setmelanotide (also know n as RM-493), an MC4R agonist, 
 as a treatment for patients with RGDO. Setmelanotide bypasses upstream signaling defects to 
directly activate MC4R. Setmelanotide binds with high affinity (inhibitory constant = 2.1 nM ) to 
the hum an MC4R and is efficient in activating MC4R (50% effective concentration = 0.27 nM ). 
Thus, setmelanotide, has the potential to restore reduced activity in the MC4R pathway in 
patients with these a nd ot her genetic defects and may serve as a f orm of “replacem ent” therapy 
 to re-establish weight and appetite control in patients with these disorders.

The purpose of this trial is to compare the QW and QD formulation s of setmelanotide in patients 
 with biallelic PPL , heterozygous  PPL, and patients with BBS . QW dosing is expected to provide 
 a more convenient dosing regimen for these patients  and w ould be more suitable for younge r 
 patients than QD dosing . In addition, QW dosing w ould be expected to improve compliance, 
 especially given the long-term requirement for continued dos e administration in order to achieve 
sustained benefits. 
3.2. Setmelanoti de Benefit/Risk Assessment  
In patients with RGDO , setmelanotide has been associated with clinically meaningful reductions 
 in weight and improvement in hunge r. In particular, in patients with POMC or LEPR deficiency 
obesity, who are characterized b y early -onset obesity, severe hunge r and pr ogressive weight 
 gain, setmelanotide has demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant weight 
reduction, of ten bringing patient s with very high morbid obesity body m ass index ( BMI ) 
(>40 kg/ m2) to BMI ranges in the overweight or normal range (<30  kg/m2). In addition to weight 
 loss, setmelanotide has demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant decreases 
in hunge r. Both the decreased hunge r and the weight loss continued over 52 weeks of treatment 
and are maintained with continued setmelanotide treatment. Furthermore, following the 
significant weight loss with setmelanotide treatment, there were improvements in lipids  and 
CCI

Protocol  RM-493- 037 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  26 of 68   other parameters , as well as body c omposition w ith decrease d fat mass a nd decreased waist 
 circumference. These w eight loss ch anges were accompanied by improvements in quality of life.  
Setmelanotide is well tolerated. Side effects of setmelanotide are predictable, well understood , 
and do not  present significant safety concerns. Collectively, safety data obtained to date show 
that adverse ev ents ( AEs) commonly associated with setmelanotide include injection site 
 reactions  (ISRs) and skin hype rpigmentation. L ess commonly, nausea and vomiting w ere 
 reported and rarely, sexual AEs  have been observed. Potential mechanistic -based events such as 
 hype rtension have been assessed throughout  the setmelanotide clinical development program and 
have not been observed. Events asso ciated with severe obesity such as depression and suicidal 
ideation occurred infrequently and were asses sed as not related to setmelanotide.  
Specifically, regarding children less than 12 ye ars old, the AEs reported in this popu lation w ere 
consistent with those reported in other studies of setmelanotide. Adverse events reported as 
related to setmelanotide treatment were consistent with the known safety profile. No evidence for 
concern regarding bone  development has been observed.  
Daily injection of setmelanotide is technically challeng ing for pediatric patients and patients with 
 poor coordination /vision or other physical challenges, thus, the Spons or is developing the weekly 
 formulation on tto io immpprrove compliance and to addres s user limitations , with the hypot hesis that 
 safety and  b between the two formulations will be comparable.  
In summary , the QD setmelanotide formulation has a positive benefit- risk profile in patient s with 
 genetic defects upstream of the MC4R  pathway and the QW formulation may have the added 
 advantage of a more conve nient dosing regimen. 
More detailed information about the know n and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expected AEs of setmelanotide may be found i n the Investigator’s Brochure.

 6 months of QW setmelanotide administration in patients with BBS, biaialllleeliclic P PPPL,  or 
heterozygous PPL. Eligible patients are those who are currently taking QD setmelanotide in 
Trial RM -493-022, referred to as the long-t erm extension (LTE)  trial, for at least 6  months with 
 accep table safety and tolerability, and who w ish to continue with setmelanotide treatment, and 
who ot herwise meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Approximately 30 patients will be 
 targeted in 3  age groups  as follows: approximately 20 patients ≥18 years old; approximately 
 6 patients ≥12 to <18 ye ars old; and approximately 4 patients ≥6 to <12 years old at the time of 
trial entry.  
The trial consists of a Screening P eriod for transition from the LTE trial, a Run-in Period  of up to 
 1 week of continuation on the patient’s current dose level of QD setmelanotide  (2, 2.5, or 3 mg), 
 a 13- week double- blind phase in which the patients will be randomized to either QD or QW 
 setmelanotide, a 13 -week non- randomized open- label phase w here all patients will receive  open-
 label QW  setmelanotide , and a 3- week  follow -up pe riod in which all patients will return to their 
 run-in dos e level of QD setmelanotide  to prepare for re -enrollment into Trial  RM-493-022 or  to 
 resume the QD formulation in some other way . 
The safety and tolerability of setmelanotide will be as sessed by the frequency and severity of 
 AEs/ serious adverse ev ents ( SAEs ) and  ISRs, as well as ch anges in physical examinations (to 
 include comprehensive skin examinations), electrocardiograms ( ECGs ), vital signs (including 
 resting bl ood pressure [BP] and heart rate [HR]), routine laboratory evaluations , development of 
 anti-drug antibodies (ADA), and the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS ).

5.1.2.  Run-In Period  
The patient will have a Run-in Period of  1 da y to 1 w eek on Q D setmelanotide at the dose they 
were on in the LTE trial . The first day  of the Run-in Period (V isit 2) should coincide with the 
 patient’s last visit in the LTE trial to avoid an interruption of treatment. The first dose of QD 
 setmelanotide as p ar t of the RM-493-037 trial will occur in clinic on the first day of the run -in 
period. 
On the first day  of the Run-in P eriod , patients will have serial blood samples taken for 
 measurement of setmelanotide concentrations  (QD formulation) and 24- hour PK profi les will be 
 performed.

Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  31 of 68   5.1.3.  Double -Blind and O pen- Label Treatment Periods  
On Day  1 (Visit 3) p atients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either QD or QW set melanotide. 
 Patients who were on QD setmelanotide at a dose of 2  mg at the time of trial entry will be 
 randomized to receive either QD setmelanotide 2  mg or QW setmelanotide at a dose of 20 m g, 
 whereas p atients who were on QD setmelanotide at a dose of 2.5  mg will be random ized to 
 receive either QD setmelanotide 2.5 or QW set melanotide at a d ose of 25 mg, and finally patients 
 who were on QD setmelanotide at a dose of 3  mg will be randomized to receive either QD 
 setmelanotide 3 mg  or QW set melanotide at a dose of 30  mg. Study m edication will be 
 administered in a doubl e-dummy fashion in order to maintain the double blind. Patients will 
 receive the first QW dose on Day  1 of the random ized treatment period (Visit 3). The 
 random ization w ill be stratified by a ge group.  
 • Patients randomized to QW set melanotide will receive blinded QW set melanotide and  
QD placebo injections until the Week  14 visit (ie, completion of 13 w eeks of blinded 
 dose administration). Starting with  Week  14, pa tients will continue with open- label 
 QW injection s of setmelanotide during the 13-week non- randomized phase.  
 • Patients randomized to QD setmelanotide will receive blinded QD setmelanotide and 
QW placebo injections until the Week  14 visit (ie, completion of 13 w eeks of blinded 
 dose administration). Starting with  Week  14, pa tients will continue with open- label 
 QW injections of setmelanotide during the 13-week non- randomized phase.  
 Prior to the QW dose of study dr ug at prespecified time points during the doubl e -blind treatment 
 phase, predose blood s amples will be collected for trough p lasma drug concentrations in all 
patients.  At Week  14, serial blood samples (including a predose blood s ample) will be taken for 
 measurement of steady  state setmelanotide concentrations (QD and QW  formulations) for  
24-hour PK profiles .  
5.1.4.  Follow- up Period  
For the 3- week Follow- up Period, all patients will return to their run -in dose of QD 
 setmelanotide to prepare for re -enrollment into Trial  RM-493-022 or  to resume the QD 
 formulation in some other way.  
5.1.5.  Patient and Trial Completion  
A patient is considered to have completed the trial if h e/she has completed the trial through the 
3-week follow-up pe riod. 
A patient who di scontinues before completing all planned visits is to attend an Early Termination 
visit within 14  days (±7  days) after their last dose of study m edic ation  for final trial assessments.  
The end of the trial is defined as the date of the last visit of the last patient under the auspices o f 
the current trial.  
5.2. Discussion of Trial  Design  
Patients to be enrolled in this trial  will be those who ha ve been on op en -label QD setmelanotide 
 treatment in the LTE trial for at least 6  months with acceptable safety and tolerability, and the 
 dose level must have been stable at 2 , 2.5, or  3 mg of setmelanotide for at least the last 3  months. 
CCI

Protocol  RM-493- 037 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  32 of 68   Switching these patients from the daily to the weekly formulation w ill allow intra -patient  
ccomompaparriison of the PK profiles  of the 2 formulations as well as comparisons of safety and 
  b between the 2 formulations.  
FForor pa pattiieentntss random ized to QW setmelanotide, t his trial design will allow the pattern of  
  t to be observed for 6 months on the QW formulation as a patient switches frorom thm thee  
ddaailyily   fforormmuulation du ring the Run- in Period  to the weekly formulation of  setmelanotide.  
 To maintaiin n tthehe bl bliind dur nd dur iing tng thehe  randomized treatment periodd,, a all pll paatietienntsts  wwill rill reecceive placebo 
 injections   from the QD formulation or  fr from the QW 
 formulation)on) i in an addiddittiion ton to to thehe s seetmelanotide injections in a doubloublee--dudummmmy fy faasshihion. Pon. P lacebo and 
active study dr ug will be visually indistinguishable. 
A formal non -inferiority trial design for the QD vs QW formulation  is not feasible because a 
 large sample size would be required, which is  unachievable in RGD O. Therefore, the sample size 
 is primarily  driven by availability of patients on stable doses of setmelanotide and by other 
 clinical considerations . 
5.3. Dosing Rationale  
Patients to be enrolled in this trial  will be those who are on op en- labelel   QDQD  setsetmmelanotide 
 treatment at a dose level of 2 , 2.5, or 3 mg . Given the PK, safety, and  r results for 
 otherwise healthy pa tients with obe sity in TTriariall  RMRM -493-026, it is anticicipipaatetedd  t that 30 mg QW  
setmelanotide will provide PK, safety, and  co comparable to the 3  mg QD  setmelanotide 
 dose.  
Likewise, it is anticipated that 25 mg QW  setmelanotide  will provide PK, safety, and  
 comparable to thehe  2.5 2.5 mgmg QD  setmelanotide dose  and that 20 mg QW  setmelanotide wwillill pr provovide 
 PK, safety, and   comparable to the 2 mg QD setmelanotide  dose.  
5.4. Trial Termination  
This trial may be terminated, if in the opinion of the Investigator (at a participating site) or the 
Spons or, there is sufficiently reasonable cause. The terminating pa rty will provide written 
notification documenting the reason for termination to either the Investigator(s) or Sponsor. 
Circumstances that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of  unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to patients 
 • Failure to enter patients at an acceptable rate  
• Insuf ficient adherence to protocol requirements  
• Insufficient complete and/or evaluable data  
• Plans to modify, suspend, or discontinue the development of the study d rug 
 Should the trial be closed/termin ated, all trial materials must be returned to the Spons or or 
designee.

Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  33 of 68   5.5. Trial  Conduct During the  Coronavi rus Pande mic 
The worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19) pandemic may impact the conduct of 
clinical studies due to the challenges from quarantines, site closures, travel limitations, and other 
considerations if site personnel or trial participants become potentially exposed to or infected 
with COVI D- 19. To assure the safety of trial participants, to maintain compliance with Good 
 Clinical Practice (GCP), and to minimize risks to trial integ rity, if necessary, in consultation w ith 
 the Spons or, the method of assessment may be changed (e.g., paper assessments replaced by 
electronic assessm ents). In addition, site visits may be replaced with telephone, internet -based 
 video‑conferencing applicati ons, or home visits by qualified health care professionals. Normal 
 procedures, as detailed in this protocol, will be resumed as so on as possible thereafter.  
More detailed gui dance on trial condu ct during the COVID- 19 pandemic is provided in 
 Appendix 1.

 estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR ). 
5. Significant dermatologic findings relating to melanoma or pre -melanoma skin lesions 
 (excluding non- invasive basal or squamous cell lesion), determined as part of 
 comprehensive skin evaluation pe rformed by the Investigator during screening. A ny 
concerning lesions identified dur ing the Screening Period w ill be biopsied and results 
CCI

Protocol  RM-493- 037 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  35 of 68   must be known to be benign prior to enrollment. If the pretreatme nt biopsy results are 
 of concern, the patient should be excluded from the trial.  
 6. Diagnos is of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, personality disorder, or other psychiatric 
disorders that the Investigator believes will interfere significantly with trial 
compliance. Neurocognitive disorders affecting ability to consent will not be 
disqualifying as long a s an appropriate guardian able to give consent has been 
appointed. 
 7. Clinically significant depression or suicidality as defined by: any suicidal ideation of  
 type 4 or 5 on the C- SSRS, any lifetime history of a suicide attempt, or any suicidal 
 behavior in the last month or a Patient Health Questionnaire -9 (PHQ- 9) score of 
 ≥15 during Screening i n patients with no significant neurocognitive deficits .

 research assistant, pharmacist, trial coordinator, or other staff directly involved with 
 the conduc t of the trial.  
6.3. Re-Screening  
Patients may be re -screened onc e if the screen failure is due to an entry criterion result that may 
 change over time  (e.g., Hb A1c >9.0% ). In this situation, the patient may be re -screened after at 
 least 1  month and no m ore than 6 months. Re- screening of a patient is up to the discretion of the 
 Spons or and must be approved by t he Spons or prior to any re- screening procedures. Re- screened 
 participants must be informed and provide consent again at re- screening. All screening 
 procedures and assess ments must be performed at re- screen.  
6.4. Patient Withdr awal Criteria  
Given this rare patient population, e very effort will be made to encourage and ke ep patients 
enrolled in the trial until completion, regardless o f  premature study dr ug discontinuation, unless 
 there are any safety concerns necessitating withdrawal of the patient. The Spons or  will provide 
 assistance for patient and caregiver travel and will provide other necessary logistical support to 
ease t he burden on the patient in order to facilitate compliance.  
If the patient withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sp onsor may retain and 
 continue to use any da ta collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
If a patient withdraws from the trial, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and 
not tested, and the I nvestigator must document this in the site tria l records.  
CCI

Protocol  RM-493- 037 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  36 of 68   Patients will be informed that they have the right to withdraw from the trial  at any time for any 
 reason, without prejudice to their medical care. The Investigator also has the right to withdraw 
patients from the trial for reasons such as:  
• AEs, which in the opinion of the Investigator, justifies  treatment or trial withdrawal. 
 Appendix 3 
 • Non-adherence to the study dr ug regimen or protocol requirements.  
• Non-compliance with instructions or failure to return for follow -up. 
7. TREATMENT OF PAT IENT S 
7.1. Description of Stu dy Medication  
All study medication is for investigational use only and is to be used onl y within the context of 
this protocol. All investigational study m edication (setmelanotide QW formulation , QD 
 formulation , and ve hicle placebos) will be supplied by t he Spons or. 
 Setmelanotide QW formulation w ill be provided as a st erile solution at a concentration of 
 30 mg/mL for administration at dose levels of 20, 25, a nd 30 mg  by S C injection. Setmelanotide 
 QW drug pr oduc t consists of setmelanotide dissolved in a liquid lipid pha se consisting of key 
excipients, soy phos phatidylcholine and gl ycerol dioleate. The solution is a clear, pale yellow to 
yellow solution, practically free from particles.  The placebo for the QW formulation will consist 
 of the vehicle only (no active ingredient) and w ill be visually indistinguishable from the QW 
 drug pr oduc t. 
Setmelanotide QD drug pr oduc t ( ( ) w) will be provided as  a 
sterile solution at a concentration oon off  10 10 mgmg/mL/mL f foor r aaddmmininisistrtraatiotionn  atat dos dose levels of 2, 2.5,  and 
 3 mg by S C injection. S etmelanotide is a clear  to slightly opalescent , colorless to pale yellow  
solution essentially free of visible particulates. The QD formulation will be  provided in clear 
 glass v ials. The placebo for the QD formulation will consist of the vehicle only (no active 
 ingredient), will be visually indistinguishable from the drug produc t, and will be provided in 
 clear glass vials.  
7.2. Random ization an d Blinding 
Patients will be randomized on D ay 1 (Visit 3)  to treatment with either QD or QW 
 setmelanotide. The trial staff will utilize an interactive respons e technology (IRT) system to 
 obtain the randomization number for each patient.  
 No random ization or blinding w ill be done  for the 13- week open -label phase o r for the 3- week 
 QD follow -up pha se.

Protocol  RM-493- 037 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  37 of 68   Emergency unblinding for AEs may be performed through a n IRT system. The IRT system will 
be programmed with blind- breaking instructions. In case o f an emergency, the Investigator has 
 the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a patient’s intervention assignment is 
warranted. Patient safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination. 
If the Investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the Investigator should make every effort 
 to contact the Spons or before unblinding a patient’s intervention assignment unless this could 
delay emergency treatment for the patient. The date and reason for the unblinding by  the 
Investigator must be recorded. If a patient’s intervention assignment is unblinded, the Spons or 
must be notif ied by the Investigator within 24  hours that an unblinding occurred. The 
 Investigator should not reveal to the Sponsor the patient’s treatment allocation unless the 
 Sponsor requests this information for safety purposes.  
For any une xpected SAE that is treat ment -related (e.g., pos sible or probable), the blind will be 
 lifted by the Sponsor only for that specific patient. The blind will be maintained for persons 
respons ible for the ongo ing conduc t of the trial (such as the monitors, investigators, etc.) and 
 those responsible for data analysis and interpretation of  results at the conclusion of  the trial (such 
as biometrics personne l). Unblinded information will only be accessible to those who ne ed to be 
involved in the safety reporting to Health Authorities, Ethi cs Committees, and/or Institutional 
 Review Boards ( IRBs ). Investigators will receive only blinded information unless unbl inded 
 information is judged necessar y for safety reasons.  
7.3. Administration  
Details on preparation and administration of setmelanotide for dosing are provided in the 
Pharmacy Man ual. Extensive training on drug administration , including educational materials , 
will be provided to the patients/caregivers . Trial -specific training materials will be provided to 
 both the investigative staff and trial participants and caregivers. Both the QW and Q D 
 formulations of setmelanotide will be administered by SC injection.  A home healthcare provider 
 may be contracted to observe or perform th e administration of injections of the QW study dr ug to 
the patient at the patient’s home.   
All patients will receive QD setmelanotide injections during the Screening (supplied by the LTE 
trial) and during the Run -in Periods (supplied under this protocol). For the QD doses of study 
 drug supplied unde r this protocol , patients/caretakers will draw up and self- administer/administer 
 the study d rug each morning during the  Run -in Period . 
Starting on D ay 1 (Visit 3) of the trial and throughout  the duration of  the doubl e-blind period,

 differentiated from those resulting from QW study drug. 
During the non-random ized pha se, all patients will receive open- label QW set melanotide 
 prepared and administered by t he trial  staff at the trial center or by the patient, caretaker , or 
health home care provider, as ap plicable,  at the patient’s home . During the follow-up pe riod, a ll 
 patients will return to QD setmelanotide  (self-administered or administered by the patient’s 
 caretaker ) at the dose they were on at the time of trial entry . 
Dose adjustment is not permitted during the trial . Any change in dose must be cap tured as a 
 protocol violation, regardless of the rationale for the dose adjustment. 
7.4. Treatment Compliance 
Accountability for the study dr ug (including placebo) at the trial site is the responsibility of the 
 Investigator. The Investigator will ensure that the study dr ug is used onl y in accordance with this 
protocol. Where allowed, the Investigator may choos e to assign dr ug accountability 
respons ibilities to a pharmacist or other appropriate individual. Drug accountability records 
indicating the delivery date to the site, inventory at the site, use by each patient, return of all used 
study dr ug to the trial cente r, and return to the Spons or (or disposal of the drug, if approved by 
 the Spons or ) will be maintained by the clinical site. Reasons for departure from the expected 
 dispensing regimen  must also be recorded. The Spons or or its designee will review drug 
 accou ntability at the site during monitoring  visits.  
Compliance with dosing w ill be monitored throughout the trial  by ha ving the patient /caregiver  
capture dosing in an electronic diary, and by a ccounting for vials dispensed and returned (used 
and partially used ). 
7.5. Preparation/Handl ing/Storage/Accountabi lity  
Only patients enrolled in the trial may receive study m edication and onl y authorized site staff 
may supply study m edication. A ll study m edication m ust be stored at the trial center  in a secu re, 
 environmentally  controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in acco rdance with the 
 labeled storage conditions with access limited to the I nvestigator and authorized site staff.  The 
Investigator is responsible for study d rug accountability, reconciliation, a nd re cord maintenance 
 (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). 
All study medication m ust be kept at a temperature between 2°C to 8°C . Both formulations are 
stable at room temperature for a short time period that will allow patients to trans port study dr ug 
 home; ice packs and cooler bags will be provided for patients and caretakers who ha ve to travel a 
long di stance from the clinic. Once at hom e, the unope ned study m edication m ust be stored in 
the patient’s refrigerator.  
For accountability, patients/caretakers will return all used vials to the clinic when they visit, the 
trial staff will record the number returned, and bo th study dr ug administration in the clinic  and 
outpatient study dr ug administration will be recorded in a trial  diary .

 mellitus (e.g., liraglutide up to  a daily dose of 1.8 mg) as long a s (1)  it is not being prescribed for 
 the treatment of obesity, (2) the dose has been stable for at least 3  months prior to enrollment, 
 (3) the patient has not experienced weight loss during the previous 3 months, AND (4) the 
patient intends to keep the dose stable throughout  the course of the trial. 
All concomitant medications should be kept at a stable dose throughout  the course of the trial, 
unless a d ose change is necessa ry to treat an AE.  
The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are any qu estions regarding concomitant or 
prior therapy. 
Patients should not  make significant changes to their diet or exercise routines during the course 
of the trial. 
7.6.1.  Prohibited Medications  
Medications that are approved to treat obesity (e.g., or listat, lorcaserin, phentermine- topiramate, 
 naltrexone -bupropion) are not allowed within 3 m onths prior to the  first dose of study medication 
 (e.g., e nrollment) and are prohibited during the course of the trial. GLP -1 receptor agonists being 
 prescribed for the treatment of obesity are not allowed. 
8. ASSESSM ENT S 
Trial procedures and their timing are summa rized in the So A (Section  2). Adherence to the trial 
 design requirements, including those specified in the SoA is essential and required for trial 
conduc t. 
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential patients 
meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all 
 patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reason s for screening failure, as applicable.  
When scheduled at the same time point, the order of procedures should be as follows: obtain 
vital signs, perform 12 -lead ECG, and perform blood dr aws (at the specified time point, if 
 applicable). Adjustments may be m ade depending upon s pecific circumstances and in 
 consultation with the Sponsor. 
For patients <18  years of age, it may not be possible to perform all planned assess ments at each 
 visit. Thus, as described in the SoA ( Section  2), the Investigator will be given latitude to adjust 
CCI

Protocol  RM-493- 037 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  40 of 68   the planned assess ments and blood draws as ap propriate for the optimal medical care of the 
patients.  
Immediate safety concerns sho uld be discussed with the Spons or immediately upon oc currence 
 or awareness to determine if the patient should continue or discontinue study t reatment. 
8.1. Infor med Conse nt/Assent 
The method of obtaining and doc umenting the informed consent and assent (if appli cable) and 
 the contents of the consent will comply with current International Council for Harmonisation 
(ICH) E6 GCP Guidelines an d all applicable laws and regulations. A complete description of the 
 trial is to be presented to each potential patient or par ent/legal guardian and a signed and da ted 
 informed consent form (ICF) and/or assen t form is to be obtained before any trial -specific 
 procedures are performed. Patients must be informed of and provide consent/assent to the most 
current version of the ICFs during their participation in the trial , and a copy of the ICF(s) must 
 be provided to the patient or their legally authorized representative.  Patients who reach the age of 
 consent during the trial must be re-consented, as applicable, per local laws. 
Procedures conduc ted as part of the LTE trial or  patient’s routine clinical management (e.g., 
 laboratory tests ) and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilize d for screening or baseline 
 purposes provided the procedures met the protocol- specified criteria and were performed within 
 the time frame defined in the So A (Section  2). 
8.2. Inclusion/Exclusion  Review  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria must  be carefully  reviewed to ensure the patient  is eligible for 
 the trial. 
8.3. Demographics, Concomitant Medications and Medical History 
Medical history and de mographic data including the patient’s gender, race, date of birth, and 
concomitant medication use will be obtained for all patients during the Screening Period. 
Additionally, the patient’s history of childhood o besity and previous weight loss efforts will be 
collected.  
The m edical history should be upda ted on D ay 1 (Visit 3)  prior to the first dose of randomized 
 study dr ug, to assess co ntinued trial eligibility and adherence to final inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
 This medical history update includes a review for changes from screening and a review of the 
patient’s recent medication use to assess w hether any changes have occurred since the previous 
visit. 
8.4. Height 
For patients ≥21 ye ars of age, height should be measured at Screening onl y. For patients aged 
 <21 years, height is to be measured at the time points designated in the SoA (Section  2). 
Height (cm) will be measured, without shoes, socks or hats using a wall-mounted stadiometer. 
The stadiometer should be calibrated by s ite personne l on a  daily basis prior to height 
assess ment. All me asurements will be done in triplicate at each time  point and recorded to the 
 nearest half centimeter .

8.6. Pharmacoki netic Assessments 
For all blood sa mples  collected  for PK analysis, the actual (clock) time the blood sample is 
 drawn  will be recorded in the source documents and e lectronic case report form (eCRF ). Plasma 
 will be harvested from each blood sample and the plasma will be frozen, shipped to a 
 bioanalytical laboratory designated by the Spons or, and analyzed for setmelanotide 
concentrations.  A temporary indwelling catheter may be placed to obtain serial blood samples for 
 the PK profiles.  
Patients/caretakers will be reminded that the re should be no s tudy dr ug administration at hom e 
 on the day of clinic visits so that samples for  trough ( predose) concentrations can be drawn 
 within 30 m inutes prior to dos ing at the clinic . 
8.6.1.  Blood sampling  
Blood samples will be collected from all patients according to the SoA  (Table  1) instructions for 
 PK sampling . All efforts will be made to obtain all PK s amples relative to dos ing. The exact time 
of sample  collection will be noted.  
In case of significant challenges with the collection of  any PK sample, the investigator should 
confirm sample prioritization with the sponsor.

8.8. Safety Assessments  
8.8.1.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs include systolic and diastolic BP, HR, respiration rate, and bod y temperature (°C). 
Vital signs will be obtained in the sitting position following at least 5  minutes of rest.  Note that 
 for virtual visits, BP will be collected.  
All BP and HR measurements will be taken in triplicate, approximately 2  minutes apart. When 
 possible, BP should be taken in the non-dominant arm throughout the trial, using the same 
 methodo logy (automated or manual). 
Repeat measures and m ore frequent monitoring can be implemented for significant increases in 
BP or HR.  In addition, i f results from outpatient measurement of vital signs indicate clinically 
 significant abnormalities, these results should be re- checked either by the patient’s primary care 
 phys ician or at t he investigative site.  
8.8.2.  Physical Examination   
A complete phys ical examination w ill be conduc ted at s creening and at the end of  trial  visit 
 (Week  30). At other tim e points, an abbreviated examination will be performed.  All physical 
 examinations are to be conduc ted in adequate light ing. 
• A complete phys ical examination w ill include review of peripheral lymph node s, 
head, eyes (including conjunctiva), ears, nos e, mouth and or opharynx, ne ck, he art, 
lungs , abdomen, musculoskeletal including ba ck, extremities, and ne urologic. 
 • The abbreviated examination should focus on he art, lungs , skin, ne urologic 
examination, and any areas of previous abnormal findings, noting any changes from 
baseline.  
• Tanner Staging for assessment of pubertal development will be conduc ted for those 
patient s who have yet to reach Tanner Stage V.

Tanner Staging. 
Changes from baseline in any phys ical examination findings identified by the Investigator a s 
clinically significant must be recorded as an  AE on the appropriate eCRF.  
8.8.3.  Comprehensive Skin Examination 
 A comprehensive skin examination will be performed by the Investigator or qualified designee . 
The skin examination should include a full body (head-to-toe) examination. If any concerning 
lesions are identified during screening, the patient should be referred to a dermatologist. Any 
 concerning lesions will be biopsied by the dermatologist and results must be classified as benign 
prior to the first dose of setmelanotide. If th e pretreatment biopsy results are of concern, the 
 patient will be excluded from the trial.  
During the course of the trial, any concerning lesion or  change in an existing lesion must be 
 evaluated by the dermatologist and bi opsied, if clinically indicated in the opinion of  the 
dermatologist.  The decision to continue the patient on setmelanotide treatment or to discontinue 
 treatment will be decided by the Investigator after discussion with the Medical Monitor.  
8.8.4.  Electrocardiogram  
Single 12- lead ECG s will be performed with the patient in the supine position following a period 
 of at least 10  minutes of rest.  
 8.8.5.  Laboratory Assessm ents  
Blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory tests are to be collected after patients have been 
fasting for 8 hours. Samples are to be collected prior to setmelanotide administration.  
The Investigators will adhere to the site -specific blood vol ume limits for safety laboratory and 
 PK analyses to ensure minimal distress to pediatric patients. Due to the age of the children  
potentially eligible for participation in this trial, it may not  be possible to collec t all labs at every 
 trial visit in this patient popul ation, though e fforts should be made to collect as many PK samples 
 per protocol. Screening may be completed over multiple days to complete the required 
assess ments.  Venipuncture reduction is allowed should a patient experience unaccep table 
 discomfort as deemed by the Investigator. After enrollment, if not all lab tests are possible, then 
the tests should be collected in the following de scending or der of priority: safety , anti -drug 
antibodies, trough P K, hemoglobin A1c, and then lipid panel. 
All clinically significant laboratory abnormalities will be followed -up by r epeat testing and 
 further investigated according to the judgment of the Investigator.  
The r outine c linical laboratory parameters to be evaluated  are as f ollows:  
Hematology 
Complete blood c ount with platelet count and standard indices will be obtained. 
Chemistry

Urinalysis  
Urine pH, glucose, protein, ke tones, bilirubin, blood, ur obilinogen, specific gravity, nitrite, and 
leukoc ytes by dipstick analysis or machine urinalysis. Urine microscopic examination will be 
performed if positive findings on dipsticks warrant further examination.  
8.8.6.  Anti -Drug Antibodies  
Blood samples for measurement of ADA will be collected according to the S oA in Table  1. Any 
 patient with a positive titer will be followed until resolution . 
8.8.7.  Pregnancy  and C ontraception  
In animal reproduc tion studies, setmelanotide was not teratogenic at doses >10 times the 
maximum recommended hum an dos e of 3 mg. No evidence of embryo- fetal toxicity was 
 observed. Pre-and pos t-natal development studies in rats showed no a dverse setmelanotide-
related effects. Please refer to the Investigator’s  Brochure for additional information.  
Females of childbearing  potential, defined as fertile, following menarche and unt il becoming 
 post- menopausal unless permanently sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral 
 oophor ectomy) must not be pregnant and m ust have a negative serum pregnancy test result at the 
Screening Visit. A urine pregnancy test may be performed to expedite availability of results prior 
to dos ing on  Day 1. S erum pregnancy testing w ill also be performed; however, setmelanotide 
dosing m ay continue with results pending. F or females of childbearing po tential, a highly 
effective form of contraception (as defined in the Inclusion Criteria, Section  6.1) must be 
 used/practiced througho ut the trial and for 90 da ys following the trial.  
 Highly effective forms of contraception include:  
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovul ation (oral, intravaginal, or transdermal)  
 • Progestogen-only hor monal contraception associated with inhibition of  ovulation 
(oral, injectable, implantable)  
 • Intrauterine device  
 • Intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
 • Bilateral tubal occlusion  
 • Vasect omy/vasect omized partner (provided that the vasectomized partner is the sole 
sexual partne r of the female participant, and the vasectomized partner has received 
 medical assessment of surgical success)  
• Sexual abstinence, only if it is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. 
CCI

Protocol  RM-493- 037 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  46 of 68   Females of non-childbearing po tential, defined as permanently sterile (status post hysterectomy, 
bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy) or post -menopausal for at least 12  months 
 (and confirmed with a screening FSH  hormone level in the post-menopa usal range) do not  
 require contraception du ring the trial .  
Younge r female patients who ha ve not reached sexual maturity at trial entry will be assessed  for 
Tanner Staging, a nd upo n reaching Tanner Stage V or menarche, will be couns eled on pregnancy 
and required to comply with contraception requirements and pregnancy tests at all visits for the 
remainder of the trial. 
It is not known if th is treatment will affect spermatogenesis. Therefore, males with female 
partners of childbearing potential must agree to use contraception ( e.g., if they have not had a 
 vasect omy then should either (a) abstain from reproductive sexual intercourse or (b) use a doubl e 
barrier method [i.e., condom and di aphragm with spermicide] during intercourse) if th ey become 
 sexually active during the trial and for 90 days following the trial. Tru e abstinence is acceptable 
 only if it is the preferred and us ual lifestyle of the patient. Male patients must not dona te sperm 
for 90 da ys following their participation in the trial. 
In the event of pregnancy dur ing setmelanotide treatment, setmelanotide is to be permanently 
discontinued. 
If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator should inform the Spons or within 24 hour s of 
learning of  the pregnancy and should follow the SAE reporting pr ocedures outlined in 
Appendix 3. 
Details of all pregnancies in female patients and female partners of male patient s will be 
 collected after the start of study treatment through 30  days after the last dose of se tmelanotide in 
 the trial. 
Note that pregnancy itself is not considered a SAE . However, abnormal pregnancy out comes 
 (e.g., s pontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, conge nital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are 
considered SAEs.  
8.8.8.  Injection Site  Examination 
 Injection sites will be carefully inspected, evaluated, and scored by t he clinical staff during each 
 in-person and telehealth trial visit . It is important to distinguish injection sites for the QW 
 formulation from those with the QD formulation.  It is recommended to use a d edicated part of 
 the body (such as a single quadrant of the abdomen) for the QW injections to facilitate this 
process.   
The injection site evaluation will include identification of areas of erythema, edema, and 
induration, a s well as the presence of localized pain, tenderness, and itching. At in -person trial 
 visits, the clinical staff will also record measurements of areas of erythema, edema, and 
induration. A sample injection site evaluation form is  included in  Appendix 2. 
 In addition, unscheduled evaluations may also be recorded as warranted by clinical conditions. 
CCI

Protocol  RM-493- 037 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  47 of 68   8.8.9.  Suicidal Ideation and D epression Monitoring  
As setmelanotide is considered to act through t he central nervous system (CNS), a patient should 
be referred to a mental health professional (MHP) if he/she has:  
• Any suicidal behavior 
 • Any suicidal ideation of  type 4 or 5 on the C- SSRS 
• A PHQ- 9 score ≥10  
A referral to a MH P should also be made if in the opini o n of the Investigator it is necessary for 
 the safety of the patient. If a patient’s psychiatric disorder can be adequately treated with psycho - 
and/or pharmacotherapy, then the patient, at the discretion of the MHP, should be continued in 
the trial. 
In cognitively impaired patients or pediatric patients, the ability to complete the following 
Mental Health Assessm ent instruments as i ntended  may be limited. If in the clinical opinion of 
 the Investigator a specific patient cannot complete the instrument, the following strategies may 
 be employed: 
 • Site staff may administer the questions directly to the patient or may ask for the 
information from a third party, such as a caregiver or family members, as  appropriate. 
 • The Investigator may use his/her clinical judgme nt to skip any questionnaires that 
 he/she feels are not appropriate for a specific patient. 
 Any de viation from the intended use of an instrument should be documented by t he Investigator, 
along w ith the reason for the deviation. If the C -SSRS is  not administered, the Investigator 
 should document that the issue of suicidality was assessed  clinically (e.g., discussion w ith 
caregivers).  
8.8.9.1.  Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
As required in the US by the Food a nd Drug A dministration ( FDA) , for clinical trials of CNS -
acting medications, changes in depression/suicidality as as sessed  by the C -SSRS will be 
 monitored over the course of the trial to ensure patient safety.  
The C -SSRS is a tool used not  only to predict suicide attempts but to assess the full range of 
 evidence- based ideation and behavior items, with criteria for next steps (e .g., referral to a  MHP). 
There are 2  versions of the C- SSRS that will be administered:  
• The Screen ing  version of the scale documents recent (within the past month) scores 
 from the sc reening C - SSRS scale. This version can assess a p atient’s eligibility based 
 on inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
[Note that patients will have completed the Baseline/Screening version of the 
 C-SSRS scale during the index trial and are therefore not expected t o complete this 
 version in the current trial. Thus, the baseline assessm ent that was collected at the 
beginning of the index trial  should continue to be used as the baseline for this 
 trial. (The Baseline/Screening version of the scale combines the Baseline  and 
Screening forms to asses s suicidality in a patient’s lifetime and during a predefined 
time period. This version can assess a patient’s lifetime suicidality for data collection 
CCI

Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  48 of 68   purposes as well as eligibility, based on inclusion/exclusion criteria, for  the index 
 trial.)] 
• The Since Last Visit version of the scale assess es suicidality since the patient’s last 
visit. This version is meant to assess  patients who have completed at least 1  initial 
 C-SSRS assessm ent and should be used in every subsequent visit. The ‘Since Last 
 Visit’ version of the C -SSRS is asking about any suicidal thoughts or behaviors the 
 patient/participant may have had since the last time you have administered the 
C-SSRS.  
To be eligible for the trial, a patient cannot have suicidal ideation of  type 4 or  5, any lifetime 
 history of suicide attempt, or any suicidal behavior in the last month in patients with no 
significant neurocognitive deficits . 
Pediatric  patients may not be able to complete the C-SSRS as intended. If in the clinical opinion 
 of the Investigator a specific patient cannot complete the instrument, the following strategies 
may be employed: 
 • Site staff may administer the questions directly to the patient or may ask for the 
information fro m a third party, such as a car egiver or family members, as appropriate. 
 • The Investigator may use his/her clinical judgment to skip any questionnaires that 
he/she feels are not appropriate for a specific patient. 
 Any de viation from the intended use of an instrument should be documented by t he Investigator, 
along w ith the reason for the deviation. If the C- SSRS is  not administered, the Investigator 
 should document that the issue of suicidality was assessed  clinically (e.g., discussion w ith 
caregivers).  
A patient should be referred to an MHP if he/she has:  
• Any suicidal behavior. 
 • Any suicidal ideation of  type 4 or 5 on the C- SSRS.  
A referral to a MH P should also be made if , in the opinion of the Investigator, it is necessa ry for 
 the safety of the patient. If a p atient’s psychiatric disorder can be adequately treated with psycho- 
 and/or pharmacotherapy, then the patient, at the discretion of the MHP, should be continued in 
the trial. 
8.8.9.2.  PHQ -9 
The PHQ -9 is a 9- item depression scale of the Patient Health Questionnaire.  The PHQ -9 is a tool 
 for assisting clinicians in diagnosing depression as well as selecting and monitoring treatment. 
After the patient has completed the PHQ -9 que stionna ire, it is scored by t he trial staff.  
8.8.10.  Overdose  
In the event of an ove rdose, the Invest igator should contact the Medical Monitor immediately. 
 Appropriate suppor tive treatment should be initiated according to the patient ’s clinical signs and 
 symptoms. 
CCI

Protocol  RM-493- 037 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  49 of 68   The quantity of the excess dose and the duration of the overdose are to be documented in the 
eCRF .  
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the I nvestigator in 
 consultation with  the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of  the patient. 
 8.8.11.  Adverse a nd Serious Adverse E vents 
 AEs will be reported by t he patient (or, when appropriate, by a  caregiver, surrogate, or the 
 patient’s legally authorized representative).  
The Investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, doc umenting, a nd recording 
events that meet the defini tion of  an AE or SAE and remain respons ible for following up A Es 
 that are serious, considered related to the study treatment or trial procedures, or that caused the 
patient  to discontinue study treatment (see Section  6.4).  
Details on recording A Es and SAEs, including de finitions, are provided in Appendix 3. 
 8.8.11.1.  Time Period and Fr equency for Collecting AE and SA E  Information  
All AEs, including SAEs, will be collected from the start of the Run -in Period to the end -of-trial 
visit (Week  30). AEs reported after starting the Run-in Period will be considered treatment -
emergent AEs.  
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of the Run- in Period  but after obtaining informed 
 consent will be recorded on the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions section of the 
eCRF not the AE section.  
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hour s from the 
point in time when the I nvestigator becomes aware of the SAE.  All SAEs must be reported 
 whether or not considered causally related to the study dr ug. The Investigat or will submit any 
 upda ted SAE data to the Spons or within 24 hours of it b eing available.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAE s in former trial patients. However, if 
 the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a patient has been 
discharged from the trial , and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the trial 
 treatment or trial participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the Spons or. 
 The method of recording, evaluating, and assess ing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures 
for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3. 
 8.8.11.2.  Method of Detecting AEs a nd SAEs  
Care will be taken not  to introduce bias when detecting A Es and/or SAEs. Open-ended and non-
leading verbal questioning of  the patient is the preferred method to inquire about AE 
occurrences.  
8.8.11.3.  Follow- up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each patient  at 
subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed unt il resolution, s tabilization, the event is 
otherwise explained, or the patient is lost to follow -up. F urther information on f ollow-up 
 procedures is given in Appendix 3. 
CCI

Protocol  RM-493- 037 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  50 of 68   8.8.11.4.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
• Prompt notification by the Investigator to the S ponsor of a SAE is essen tial so that 
 regulatory obligations and ethical respons ibilities toward  the safety of patients and the 
 safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met.  
• The Spons or has a legal respons ibility to not ify both the local regulatory authority 
and ot her regulatory agencies about the safety of a study t reatment unde r clinical 
investigation. The Spons or will comply with country- specific regulatory requirements 
 relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB s, and investigators.  
• Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and Spons or policy 
and forwarded to Investigators, as necessar y.  
• An Investigator who receive s an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other 
 specific safety information (e.g., summa ry or listing of SAEs) from the Spons or will 
 review and then file it along w ith the Investigator’s Brochure and w ill notify the IRB, 
if appropriate according to local requirements.  
9. STATISTICS  
This section describes the plans for analysis. Details of the statistical methodology for summaries 
and statistical analyses will be provided in a sep arate statistical analysis plan ( SAP), which will 
 be maintained by t he Sponsor. The SAP may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; how ever, 
any m ajor modifications of the primary endpoi nt definition and/or its analysis will also be 
reflected in a protocol amendment. If, after the trial  has completed, changes are made to th e SAP , 
then these deviations to the plan will be listed, along w ith an explanation as to why they 
occurred, in the clinical trial r eport for the trial, as appropriate. 
9.1. Sam ple Size Determination  
The primary objective is to asses s steady -state PK parameters (m aximum plasma concentration 
 [Cmax,], time to maximum plasma concentration [Tmax], trough plasma concentration [Ctrough], 
area unde r the plasma concentration- time curve over the dosing interval [ AUC 0-tau]) for QW 
 compared with QD setmelanotide. The sam ple size is based on availability of the patients 
enrolled in the LTE trial  and is not driven by f ormal statistical hypot hesis testing on non-
 inferiority/similarity . 
9.2. Popul ations for  Analyses  
The analysis popul ations are  defined as fol lows :  
• Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PKAS): All patients who  receive at least 1 dose of 
 setmelanotide and who have a su fficient number of measurable plasma concentrations 
to permit assessm ent of noncompartmental parameters.  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All pat ients who receive at least 1  dose of setmelanotide. 
 Patients will be analyzed according to their randomly assigned treatment.

Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  55 of 68   APPENDIX 1. GUI DANCE ON TRIAL  CONDU CT DURI NG THE 
 COR ONAVIRUS PANDEMIC 
The coronavirus disease 2 019 (COVID -19) pandemic could  impact the conduct of this clinical 
 trial for several reasons, including: self -isolation/quarantine by patients and trial site personnel; 
 travel restrictions/limited access to public places, including hospitals; and reassi gnment of  site 
personnel to critical tasks.  
In accordance with recent health authority guidance, the Sponsor is providing temporary 
considerations for trial conduc t in the event of disruption of the trial. This guidance does not 
supersede any local or government requirements or the clinical judgment of the I nvestigator. If at 
 any time a patient ’s safety is considered to be at risk, trial intervention will be discontinued, and 
 trial follow -up w ill be conduc ted. 
 If COVI D-19 restrictions are imposed on or  by the trial site and the site cannot fully carry out 
 normal operations, the following m easures are recommended on a  temporary basis during the 
COVI D- 19 pa ndemi c:  
• Where possible, every effort should be made to complete all protocol-required 
assess ments. In place of a required site visit, a qualified healthcare provider could 
perform trial -related procedures as p er the Schedule of Activitie s (Section  2) via a 
home visit, including bu t not limited to collection of body w eight, vital signs, 
phys ical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs ), r, reeccoorrdidingng of adverse events 
 (AEs), collection of blood and urine samples. Most  a assessm ents could 
 potentially be done  off site. Investigators should usee t theheiirr c clliinical judgm ent to 
determine whether a patient  can continue trial treatment in the ab sence of on -site 
clinic visits or consider alternatives such as temporary treatment interruption or trial  
discontinuation. 
 • All protocol -required assessm ents missed due to COVID restrictions should be 
 documented in detail within the patients’ source documen ts and should be clearly 
 designated as “COVID -19 R ELATED”. It must be documented if a site visit is 
 instead conducted remotely. Source documentation should detail how  each 
assess ment was co llected (e.g., remote vs. on -site, central vs. local laboratory, vi tal 
signs taken at home by caretaker vs. delegated in -home nursing, etc. ). 
• If applicable, discontinuations of trial interventions and withdrawal from the trial due 
 to disruption of trial conduct by the pandemic should be documented with the prefix 
“COVI D-19 RELA TED” in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). 
• If a patient is unable to attend a site visit, investigational product may be shipped 
directly to the patient.  
COVI D-19 Infection in T rial Patients:  
There is currently no available data suggesting that patients treated with setmelanotide should 
have treatment interrupted dur ing the COVID-19 pandemic. If a patient develops symptoms 
associated with coronavirus infection, it is recommended to confirm the diagnos is using locally 
approved laboratory kits and report it to the local health authorities, as required. Patients with 
positive test results for severe acu te respiratory syndrome coronavirus -2 (SARS -COV-2) should

Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  58 of 68   APPENDIX 3. ADVERSE EVENTS: DEFINITIONS AND PRO CEDURES 
FOR RECORDING, EVALUATING, F OLLOW -UP, AND  
 REPORTING  
Definition of Adverse E vent ( AE) 
AE Definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial patient, temporally associated with 
 the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment.  
• NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study treatment.  
 
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urin alysis) or other safety 
 assessme nts ( e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from 
 baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator ( i.e., not 
related to pro gression of underlying  disease).  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency 
 and/or intensity of the  condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even th ough it may have been 
 present before the start of the  trial. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant 
medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken 
with possible suicidal/self -harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of  sequelae.  
•  or “failure of expected phhararmmacacoollogical action” per se will not be reported as an AE or 
SSAAEE..  SSuucchh  iinnssttanancesces will be capapttuurreded  iinn  tthhe e   assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or 
clinical sequelae resulting from    wwiillll  be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil l the definition of 
 an AE or  SAE.  
 
Events NOT  Meeting the AE Definition  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments which are 
associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the Investigator to be more severe than expected for 
 the patient’s  condition.  
• The disease/disord er being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being 
 studied, unless more severe than expected for the patient’s  condition.  
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g. , endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the  procedure is 
 the AE. 
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or  convenience admission to a  
hospital).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start 
 of the trial that do not worsen.

Protocol  RM-493- 037 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  59 of 68   Definition of Serious Adverse E vent ( SAE) 
 If an event is not an AE per definition above , then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met ( e.g., hos pitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease unde r trial, death due to 
 progression of  disease).  
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurren ce that, at any dose:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening  
The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of 
 death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if 
it were more severe.  
c. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing  hospitalization  
In general, hospi talization signifies that the patient has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight 
 stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been 
appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are 
AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. 
When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be cons idered 
 serious. 
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not 
 considered an AE.  
d. Results in persistent  disability/incapacity  
• The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life  functions.  
• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as 
uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma ( e.g., sprained ankle) 
 which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial  disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
f. Important medical  event  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether S AE reporting is appropriate in other 
 situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
 hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious.  
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood d yscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or 
 development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
CCI

Protocol  RM-493- 037 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  60 of 68   Recording and A E and/or SAE  
AE and SAE Recording  
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all documentation ( e.g., 
hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) related to the  event.  
• The Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the  eCRF .  
• It is not accep table for the Investigator to send photocopies of the patient’s medical records in lieu of 
 completion of the AE/SAE e CRF  page.  
• There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested. In  this case, all 
 patient identifiers, with the exception of the patient number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical 
records before  submission. 
 • The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or oth er 
clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be 
documented as the  AE/SAE.  
 
Assessment of Intensity  
Intensity of all AEs including clinically significant treatment -emergent laboratory abnormalities, injection site 
 reactions and potential systemic reactions will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version  5.0. The CTCAE grade refers to the severity of the 
 AE and ran ges from Grade  1 (mild AE), Grade  2 (moderate AE), Grade  3 (severe AE), and Grade  4 (life -
threatening or disabling AE) to Grade  5 (death related to AE).  
Adverse events not listed by the CTCAE will be graded as follows:  
• Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the patient, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with 
everyday  activities.  
• Moderate: An event that causes sufficiently discomfort and interferes with normal everyday activities.  
• Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An  AE that is assessed as severe should not be 
 confused with a SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and 
SAEs can be assessed as  severe.  
• An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least one  of the predef ined outcomes as described in the 
 definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as  severe.  
 
Assessment of Causality  
• The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment and each occurrence of each 
 AE/SAE. 
• A “reasonable possibilit y” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to 
 suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. 
• The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the  relationship.  
• Alternative causes, s uch as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the 
 temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration will be considered and investigated.  
• The Investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure and/or Product Information, for marketed 
 products, in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the Investigator must  document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the 
AE/SAE and has provided an assessme nt of  causality.  
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred, and the Investigator has minimal information to 
 include in the initial report. However, it is very important that the Investigator always make an 
 assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE  data.  
CCI

Protocol  RM-493- 037 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  61 of 68   Assessment of Causality  
• The Investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send a SAE 
 follow -up report with the updated causality  assessme nt. 
 • The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting  requirements.  
A medically qualified Investigator must assess the relationship of any AE (including SAEs) to the use of the 
study drug, as related or not related, based on clinical judgment and using all available information, and may 
include consideration of the following factors:  
• Possible alternative causes of the AE, including the disease under treatment, pre- existing conditions, 
 concomitant use of other drugs, and presence of environmental or genetic factors.  
• The temporal association be tween study drug exposure and onset of the  AE. 
• Whether the manifestations of the AE are consistent with known actions or toxicity of the study  drug.  
• The AE resolved or improved with decreasing the dose or stopping use of the study drug (dechallenge). 
Judgm ent should be used if multiple products are discontinued at the same time.  
The causal relationship between the study drug and the AE will be assessed using one of the following categories:  
• Not Related: Factors consistent with an assessment of Not Related  include: 
− Temporal relationship is lacking ( e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time frame following 
 administration of the study drug);  or 
− Other causative factors more likely explain the event ( e.g., a pre -existing condition, other concomitant  
treatments).  
• Related : Factors consistent with an assessment of Related  include:  
− There is a "reasonable possibility" of a relationship,  i.e., there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to 
 suggest a causal relationship (not just that “a relationship cannot be ruled out”);  
− There is a positive temporal relationship ( e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time frame 
 following administration of study  drug); 
− The AE is more likely explained by the investigational product than by another cause ( i.e., the AE shows 
 a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of the investigational product or the class of the study  
drug).  
 
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
• The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or 
 evaluati ons as medically indicated or as requested to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE 
 as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological 
examinations, or consultation with other health car e professionals.  
• If a patient dies during participation in the trial or during a recognized follow -up period, the Investigator will 
 provide a copy of any postmortem findings including  histopathology.  
• New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed  CRF .  
• The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of receipt of the  
information.

Protocol  RM-493- 037 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  63 of 68   APPENDIX 4. CONS IDERATIONS FOR RE DUCING P AIN AND  
 DISTRESS IN THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION  
Although t he trial procedures an d assessm ents required per protocol are classified as “No or 
Minimal Risk”, which may be classified as “M inor Increase over Minimal Risk”) according to 
the 2008 Guidance Document “Ethical Considerations for Clinical Trials o n Medicinal Produc ts 
 Conduc ted with the Paediatric Population”, considerations for reducing pain and di stress in 
patients <18  years of age are suggested below.  
• The clinical trial may only be conducted if it exposes the person concerned to as little 
burden and other foreseeable risks as possible. 
 • Physical and emotional pain should be prevented as much as possible, and effectively 
treated when  unavoidable. This includes  adherence to site -specific blood vol ume 
 limits  for safety laboratory and PK analyses (as ap plicable)  to ensure minimal distress 
 and reduce the num ber of excessive venipunctures in pediatric patients.  
• In order to minimize pain, distress, and fear, facilities should be appropriate to 
childcare, and the personnel should be trained to look a fter children and supervised by 
experienced health care professionals. Staff should be trained to communicate with 
both parents (or legal representative) and children. Generally, this would assume non- 
adult patients are being studied at experienced pediatr ic centers.  
• For most procedures, the child should always be accompanied by a  trial- related staff 
 member who could provide reassurance. At the sign of  distress and/or dissent, the 
procedure should be stopped. A short pause to allow the child to feel in control, 
further explanation, and an assess ment of the situation may be needed to reassu re the 
child, or to decide to definitely abandon the procedure at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  
• In all situations, investigations/interventions should be limited to the minimum 
required for obtaining va lid data and performed using size- /age-appropriate material 
 and de vices, including limiting in advance the number of attempts for sampling. 
 • Study dr ug injections should onl y be performed by pa rents (or hom e health care 
professionals), unless the child is of suitable age and competency, and de sires the 
ability to do so. 
 • Although a lmost all trial procedures are classified as low risk, risk should be 
 continuous ly monitored and assessed by a ppropriate personne l. 
 • For assess men ts in which there is a psychological compone nt, measures should be 
 taken to minimize distress. For example, Tanner Staging assessments could utilize a 
diagram for the child to point to and indicate what stage they currently are, vs. having 
to have an exam without clothes.  
A comment on benefit risk : Risk is very low, from procedures and/or known safety profile of 
 the drug (both clinically and toxicologically, where large margins and pr eliminary data from 
juvenile toxicology s tudies have not identified any new or concerning safety concerns) and ba sed 
on one  representative example of rare genetic disorder of obesity impacting the MC4R pathway, 
there is the possibility of major benefit.

Clinical Quality Assurance auditors or other authorized personnel appointed by the 
Spons or, by a ppropriate IRB members, and by i nspectors from regulatory  authorities. 
 Data Quality Assurance 
All patient data relating to the trial will be recorded on printed or electronic case report form 
(eCRF) unless transmitted to the Sponsor electronically (e.g., e -diary). The Investigator is 
 responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by physically or electronically 
signing the eCRF. 
 The Investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the 
information entered in the eCRF. 
The Investigator must permit trial-related monitoring, a udits, IRB review and regulatory agency 
inspections and provide direct access to source data documents.  
Monitoring details describing strategy (e.g., risk-based initiatives in operations and qu ality such 
as Risk Man agement and Mitigation Strategies and Analytical Risk -Based Monitoring), methods , 
 responsibilities an d req uirements, including ha ndling of  nonc ompliance issues and m onitoring 
 techniques (central, remote or on -site monitoring) are provided in the Monitoring Plan.

Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  66 of 68   The Spons or or designee is responsible for the data management of this trial  including qua lity 
 checking of the data. 
The Spons or assumes accountability for actions delegated to other individuals (e.g., C ontract 
Resear ch Organizations).  
Trial monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into the 
 eCRF by a uthorized s ite personnel are accu rate, complete, and verifiable from source documents; 
 that the safety and rights of patients are being protected; and that the trial is being conducted in 
accordance with the currently approved protocol and any ot her trial agreements,  ICH GCP , and 
 all applicable regulatory requirements.  
In an exceptional case w here a local restriction for the on -site Monitoring Visit at the 
 investigator site is implemented (e.g., due  to COVI D-19) , the Clinical Resear ch Associate ( CRA ) 
 will perform routine scheduled Remote Interim M onitoring Visits (rI MV) for active sites. The 
 aim of the remote activities is to ensure adequate ongoing oversight of trial activities to identify 
and eliminate any immediate risk to the safety and integrity of the patient s. Each individual 
 RMV should be approved by t he Sponsor on a case-by- case basis.  
There are 5  types of rIMV that may be performed, where approved by t he relevant local 
 authorities, which include:  
• Remote Source Data Monitoring (rSDM) visits  
• Remote Data Verifica tion (rDV) visits  
• Audio Data Verification (ADV) visits: An alternative approach for remote data 
verification of critical patient data, when Monitor asks Investigator site staff me mber 
 to read patient  source documents during a telephone call while reviewing the Case 
 Report Form (C RF) to verify patient  safety is protected and the data reported by 
 Investigator (e.g., in the CRF) is accurate and complete  
• Video Source Data Monitoring visits: Process for conduc ting SDM during a video 
call/conference between the Monitor and Investigator site staff member, when the 
Investigator site staff member shares the patient source documents with the Monitor 
via camera s o that the Monitor can perform Source Data Review and Source Data 
 Verification as per the project -specific instructions.  
• Remote Site Monitoring  Contact (SMC) visits  
Depending on t he local regulation, s ome of these types of rIMV  may be allowed or not. 
 Recor ds and documents, including signed ICFs, pertaining to the conduc t of this trial must be 
 retained by the Investigator for at least 2  years after the last marketing application approval or 
 2 years after formal discontinuation of the clinical development of the investigational product or 
according to applicable regulatory requirement(s). If th e Investigator withdraws from the 
respons ibility of keeping the trial records, custody must be transferred to a person w illing to 
accept the respons ibility. The Spons or must be notified imme diately by telephone or e -mail and 
 the notification confirmed in writing if a custodial change occurs.

Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  67 of 68   Source D ocuments  
Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the patient  and substantiate the integrity 
 of the data colle cted.  Source documents are filed at the Investigator’s site.  
Data entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with the 
source documents or the discrepancies must be explained.  The Investigator may need to request 
 previous medical records or transfer records, depending on t he trial. Also, current medical 
records must be available.  
Any electronic trial data are to be entered into a secure, validated data processi ng system and a 
backup m aintained. Any changes to electronic trial data will be documented. 
Trial  and Si te Closure  
The trial is to be discontinued if the required approval or favorable approval is revoke d. Trial 
sites will be closed upon trial completion. A  trial site is considered closed when all required 
 documents and trial supplies have been collected and a trial -site closure visit has been 
 performed. 
The Investigator may initiate trial -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause an d 
 sufficient  notice is given in advance of the intended termination. 
 Reasons for the early closure of a trial site by the Spons or or investigator may include but are not 
 limited to:  
For trial termination:  
• Discontinuation of further trial intervention de velopment.  
 For site termination:  
• Failure of the I nvestigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB 
 or local health authorities, the Spons or's procedures, or GCP guidelines. 
 Inadequate or no recruitment (evaluated after a reasonable amount of time) of patients by the 
Investigator.  
• Total number of patients included earlier than expected.  
If the trial is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Spons or shall promptly inform the 
investigators, the IECs/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and any contract research organization(s) 
used in the trial of the reason for termination or  suspension, as specified by the applicable 
regulatory requirements. The Investigator shall promptly inform the patient and should assure 
appropriate patient therapy and/or follow -up.

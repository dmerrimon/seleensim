OVERALL RATIONALE FOR PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 07: 
Based on historical and emerging external data, event accrual f or event-free survival (EFS) 
analysis is expected to slow down in long-term follow up after de finitive surgery for resectable 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Recurrence dynamics after c omplete res ection for stage I/II 
NSCLC show a constant recurrence r ate of 6-7 events per 100 perso n-years of follow-up during 
the first 4 y ears, decreasing to 2 events pe r 100 person-year thereafter.1 A similar slowdown was 
seen with stage III NSCLC. In a randomized, Phas e III trial com paring neoadjuvant 
chemoradiation and chemotherapy both followed by surgery in stag e III NSCLC, no difference 
was seen in progression-free survival (PFS, primary e ndpoint), with the PFS curves dropping 
sharply during the first year indicating init ial high h azard rates, then flattening thereafter 
suggesting a markedly decreasing and stabilizing hazard rate.2Such pattern of recurrence 
dynamics was repeatedly seen in other neoadjuvant trials conduc ted in Stage I-III NSCLC.3,4
Furthermore, preliminary data from recentl y published Phase II trials inc orporating nivolumab into 
neoadjuvant regimens suggest potentially further decreased haza rd rates for rec urrence after 
surgery by the flattened shape of Kaplan-Meier curves of EFS/PFS. For example, in the single-
arm NADIM trial of neoadjuvant nivolumab + chemotherapy followed b y surgery and adjuvant 
nivolumab for Stage IIIA NSCLC, the 24-month PFS rate was 77.1% ( 95% CI 59.9-87.7), greatly 
exceeding historic standards.5,6
To account for the aforementioned event dynamics which may prec lude the necessary EFS events 
from accruing in a reasonable timeframe or potentially never accru ing, the statistical analyses plan 
has been updated to model the assumptions based on a piecewise exponential distribution and 
incorporate a calendar-based rule in addition to the existing even t-driven approach to trigger 
analysis timing. Moreover, one additional EFS interim analysis (IA ) has been added  
 at 90% of EFS ev ents information fraction  
. No changes have been made to the target number of events for the existing 
interim and final analyses, and the overall ty pe 1 error has be en maintained. At the time of this 
amendment, EFS and overall survival (OS) remain blinded and have  not been analyzed by the 
Sponsor or investigators.

1 SYNOPSIS
Protocol Title: Randomized, Open-Label, Phase 3 Trial of Nivolumab plus Ipilimu mab or 
Nivolumab plus Platinum-Doublet Chemotherapy versus Platinum-Do ublet Chemotherapy in 
Early Stage NSCLC
Study Phase: 3
Rationale:
Approximately 80% of lung cancer cases are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with most 
patients presenting with late-stage disease. At initial diagnosi s, 20% of patients present with stage 
I or II disease, whereas 30% present with stage III disease and 50% with stage IV disease. With 
enhanced lung cancer screening techniques, the percentage of pa tients diagnosed during the early 
stages may increase over the duration of the trial. A standard TNM staging system is used to 
determine the staging for NSCLC ( Appendix 1 ). Patients with pathologic stage I NSCLC have a 
5-year survival of approximately 6 0%. Stage II to III NSCLC patients have a 5-year s urvival of 
approximately 25% to 40%.1Surgical resection remains the mainstay of treatment for stage I and 
II patients; however, despite potenti ally cur ative surgery, approximately 50% of stage IB and 
60-75% of stage II NSCLC patients w ill relapse and eventu ally die of their disease.2,3A rational 
approach to improve survival in these patients is to eradicate micrometastatic disease and to 
minimize the risk of relapse after adjuvant or neoadjuvant chem otherapy.
This phase 3 study, CA209816, w ill evalu ate the clinical efficacy of ni volumab plus ipilimumab
or nivolumab plus platinum doublet ch emotherapy in operable lung  cancer. Specifically, this study 
will compare event free survival (EFS) and compare the pathologi c complete response (pCR) rate
among participants with Stage IB-IIIa NSCLC treated with nivolum ab plus platinum doublet 
chemotherapy to the EFS and pCR rates in participants treated with  platinum-doublet 
chemotherapy.
Study Population:
1) Key Inclusion Criteria

evaluation prior to randomization. The tumor tissue sample may be fresh or archival if 
obtained within 3 months prior to enrollment. 
ii) Tissue must be a core needle biopsy, excisional or incisiona l biopsy. Fine needle 
biopsies obtained by EBUS is not considered adequate for biomar ker review and 
randomization. Core needle biopsies ob tained by EBUS are acceptable for 
randomization. 
e) All suspicious mediastinal lymph nodes including those that are pathologically enlarged or 
FDG avid on PET/CT require further sampling for pathological co nfirmation if accessible 
by EBUS, thoracoscopy , or mediastinoscopy. 
2) Key Exclusion Criteria:
a) Presence of locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic diseas e. 
b) Participants with known EGFR mutations or ALK translocation. If testing is done, testing 
will be done using an FDA-approved assay and will be performed locally.

Overall Design:
This is an open-label, randomized clinical trial of up to 3 cyc les of neoadjuvant nivolumab 
(3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) and a single dose of 1 mg/kg dose of ipil imumab, up to 3 cycles of 
nivolumab (360 mg) plus platinum doublet chemotherapy every 3 w eeks, or neoadjuvant platinum 
doublet chemothe rapy (up to 3 cy cles) in participa nts with early stage (Stage IB [≥ 4 cm], II, and 
resectable IIIA [N2]) NSCLC. 
Revised protocol 03 withholds rando mization into Arm A of neoadjuvant nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab but continues randomizing eligible participants into  either neoadjuvant nivolumab plus 
platinum doublet chemotherapy arm  or platinum doublet chemotherapy  arm. Participants already 
randomized in the original 2-arm part (neoadjuvant nivolumab pl us ipilimumab vs neoajduvant 
chemotherapy) and in the arm of neoadjuvant nivolumab plus ipil imumab in 3-arm part defined 
by revised protocol 02 will remai n in trial and continue schedu led trial procedures.
Study Schema
Eligible participants will be randomized between 2 arms in a 1:1  ratio. Participants will be stratified 
by:
•PD-L1 expression ( ≥1% or <1%/not evaluable/indeterminate)
•Disease stage (IB/II vs IIIA)
•Gender
PD-L1 status will be determined by immunohistochemical (IHC) st aining of PD-L1 protein in the 
submitted tumor sample and categorized as follows: 
•PD-L1 positive -  defined as ≥ 1% tumor cell mem brane staining positive in a minimum of 
100 evaluable tumor cells
•PD-L1 negative – defined as < 1% tumor cell membrane staining positive in a minimum of 
100 evaluable tumor cells
•PD-L1 not evaluable/indeterminate - defined as participants with i nsufficient sample quantity 
or quality to stain for PD-L1 status or those in whom PD-L1 stat us could not be determined

despite appropriate amounts of tissue sample. For the purpose o f stratification, this category 
will be grouped with PD-L1 negative participants. No more than 10% of p articipants will be 
randomized into this category.
Tumor tissue (archival  [blocks/slides ≤3 months old] or recent tumor biopsy) must be submitted 
to a third-party vendor for determination of PD-L1 status testi ng prior to randomization. 
PET/CT including contrast from the base of the skull to upper t highs will be performed at baseline 
(within 28 days pri or to randomization) and within 14 da ys prior to planned definitive surgery. A 
separate CT, with contrast, of the chest, abdomen, and all othe r suspected sites of disease (as well 
as the PET/CT) is required if the CT component of a PET/CT is no t of sufficient diagnostic  quality 
for RECIST 1.1 measurements. Subsequent assessments (CT, includ ing contrast, of the chest
including adrenal glands and CT or MRI of other additional suspected/known sites of disease.) 
will be performed in accordance with the Schedule of Activities . Tumor assessments must continue 
per protocol until disease recurrence/progression is confirmed by BICR per RECIST 1.1. Details 
will be outlined in the radiology manual. OS will be followed c ontinuously every 3 months via in-
person or phone contact after Post-neoadjuvant Follow-up Visit 2 or after completion of adjuvant 
therapy, when applicable. 
Following the completion of neoadjuvant treatment, all par ticipants who r emain operative
candidates will undergo definitive surgery for NSCLC. Surgery s hould be performed within 
6 weeks after completing neoadj uvant treatment for each treatment arm.
Following definitive surgery, participants in each arm may rece ive adjuvant chemotherapy with or 
without radiation per institutional standard at the discretion of the investigator. 
Number of Participants: 
Approximately 350 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio  (175 participants in each arm) to 
the 2 arms (neoadjuvant nivolumab plus platinum doublet chemothe rapy and platinum doublet 
chemotherapy) from 1:1:1 randomization in revised protocol 02 a nd 1:1 randomization in revised 
protocol 03.
In addition, it is expected to have around 70 participants rando mized in the original 2-arm study
(Arm A and Arm B) and approximately another 75 participants rand omized in the arm of 
neoadjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimu mab (Arm A) when the study ha d 3 arms. 
Treatment Arms and Duration:
Arm A: Participants randomized into Ar m A received nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV over 30 minutes 
every 2 weeks for up to 3 doses (ie, 6 weeks of treatment; each cycle is 14 days). In Cycle 1 Day 1 
only, nivolumab will be followed by a single dose of ipilimumab  1 mg/kg IV over 30 minutes.
Arm B: Participants randomized to Arm B w ill receive investigator-choic e of platinum doublet 
chemotherapy regimens in 3-week cycles up to a maximum of 3 cyc les of IV chemotherapy 
(ie, 9 weeks of treatment; each cycle is 21 days).

Independent Radiology/Pathology Review:
Independent pathology and radiol ogy review will be established for central review and 
confirmation of e ndpoints. Imag es and tumor/lymph node samples will be submitted  to these third-
party vendors for central review. Sites will be trained prior t o enrolling the first study participant. 
Images and pathology samples acquisition guidelines and submission process will be ou tlined in 
the study Imaging/Laboratory Manuals to be provided by the vend ors.
Tumor and lymph node collection from definitive surgical resect ion and sampling of fresh tumor 
sample in RNAlater for biomarker studies (as applicable depende nt on the size of the residual 
tumor) is mandatory on the day of surgery. RNAlater sample will  not be collected in China.
Processing the remainder of the specimen for histopathologic an alysis should be performed within 
72 hours of the procedure. Sections will be used for central pa thology review assessing pathologic
complete response (pCR) and major pathologic response (MPR). Any tumor, tumor bed or lymph 
node specimens that are reviewed  locally must be submitted for central pathology review. Gross 
examination on the entire specime n should be performed which includes all tumor, and associated 
lymph node tissue and uninvolved parenchyma. The specimen s hould be sectioned at 0.5 cm 
intervals, and blocks should be submitted for the full cross sec tion for every other 0.5 cm interval. 
For very large tumors with no gross evidence of response, a minimum of 1 slide/cm is required for assessment of pathologic respons e. When estimating viable tumor , in situ carcinoma should not be 
included. Pathology specimen collection and processing guideline s are outlined in the CA209816 
Laboratory Manual. A blinded pathology review process will be u tilized to assess for confirmation 
of endpoints.
Radiologic tumor assessments should be submitted to the third-party radiology vendor as they are 
performed on a n ongoing basis.
Tumor assessments will be sent to and reviewed by a Blinded Ind ependent Central Review (BICR) 
from a third-party radiology vendor on an on-going basis. At th e time of investigator assessed 
radiographic progression per RECIST 1.1, the site must request a BICR- for confirmation of 
progression or disease recurrence. However, BICR confirmation o f progression should not be 
requested if investigator judges the progression will not precl ude surgery. Participants should 
proceed to definitive surgery and tumor assessments post surger y should be continue per schedule 
of activities. Details of the BICR responsibilities and procedur es will be specified in the BICR 
charter.
Participants whose disease progre ssion or disease recurrence is  not confirmed by central review 
will be required to continue t umor assessments (if clinically fe asible) according to the protocol-
specified schedule, even after the initiation of subsequent ant i-cancer therapies. Subsequent tumor 
assessments must be submitted to the third party radiology vend or for subsequent review and may 
be discontinued when the invest igator and independent radiologi sts both assess the participant to 
have met RECIST 1.1 criteria for progression or disease recurrence.

BMS-936558 nivolumab
3 INTRODUCTION
Nivolumab (BMS-936558) is a fully human, IgG4 (kappa) isotype m Ab that binds PD-1 on 
activated immune cells and dis rupts engagement of the receptor with its ligands PD-L1 
(B7 H1/CD274) and PD-L2 (B7-DC/CD273), thereby abrogating inhibi tory signals and 
augmenting the host antitumor response. In early clinical trial s, nivolumab has demonstrated 
activity in several tum or types, including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
CTLA-4, an activation-induced T-cell surface molecule, is a mem ber of the CD28:B7 
immunoglobu lin superfamily that competes with CD28 for B7. The proposed mechanism of action 
for ipilimumab is interference of the interaction of CTLA-4 wit h B7 molecules on APCs, with 
subsequent blockade of the inhibitory modulatio n of T- cell activation promoted by the CTLA 4/B7 
interaction.Nivolumab is in clinical development for the treatment of patie nts with NSCLC, RCC, melanoma, 
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and other tumors (eg, glioblastoma 
multiforme, mesothelioma, small cell lung cancer, gastric). The  combination of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab is in clinical development for the treatment of NSCL C, RCC, and other tumors. 
Opdivo® is approved in the United States (US), European Union, and other countries for the 
treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma,  advanced NSCLC with
progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy, advanced R CC whose disease progressed 
on an antiangiogenic therapy ( US only), classical Hodgkin lymph oma that has relapsed or 
progressed after a utologous hemat opoietic stem cell tran splantation and post-transplantation 
brentuximab vedotin treatment (US only), head and neck carcinom a (US only), and bladder cancer 
(US only). Opdivo is also approved in combination with Ye rvoy
®in unresectable and metastatic 
melanoma. 3.1 Study Rationale
Approximately 80% of lung cancer cases are NSCLC, with most pat ients presenting with late-stage 
disease. Of patients with NSCLC, 20% present with stage I or II  disease, whereas 30% present 
with stage III disease and 50% with stage IV disease. With enha nced lung cancer screening 
techniques, the percentage of those diagnosed during the early stages may increase over the 
duration of the trial. A  standard TNM staging system is used to determine the staging for NSCLC 
(Appendix 1 ). Patients with pathologic stage I NSCLC have a 5-year surviva l of approximately 
60%. Stage II to III NSCLC patients have a 5-year survival of a pproximately 25% to 40%.
1
Surgical resection remains the mainstay of treatment for stage I and II patients; however, despite 
potential curative surgery, a pproximately 50% of stage IB and 6 0-75% of stage I-II NSCLC 
patients will relapse and eventually die of their disease.2,3A rational approach to improve survival 
in these patients is to eradicate micrometastatic disease and t o minimize the risk of relapse with 
adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Many adjuvant studies hav e been performed, and these 
trials are summarized in Table 3.1-1 . Although there are some conflicting results, the overall 
evidence from these studies suggests that adjuvant platinum dou blet chemotherapy is beneficial 
for good Performance Status patients with stage ≥I disease. The benefit to stage IB patients is less

clear and may depend on the size of the pr imary tumor and other risk factors. The LACE 
meta-analysis of modern adjuvant and neoadjuvant trials, all of  which used cisplatin-based 
chemotherapy, suggested a 5% absolute survival advantage at 5 y ears from adjuvant chemotherapy 
with the benefit being greatest for stage II and IIIA patients.  A 2010 meta-analysis including both 
older and more recent trials confirmed the survival benefit sho wn in the LACE meta-analysis and 
also suggested a benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage IB disease.4

The early-stage (IB-III) NSCLC represents a population o f high unmet need with a 5-year s urvival 
rate of 25-50%.2,3,5The current available standard of  care (SOC) only provides a 5%  absol u te 
improvement in 5-year overall survival (OS).6,7,8,9The SOC comprises adjuvant or neoadjuvant 
platinum doublet chemotherapy for patients with operable stage IB-IIIA NSCLC or 
chemoradiation for patients with unresectable stage IIIA/B NSCL C. Follow-up of adjuvant trials 
are long and may require decades before a new treatment is intr oduced into clinical pr actice. 
Preoperative or neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been assessed in a  number of trials for patients with 
operable NSCLC. A meta-analysis based on 7 trials involving 988  patients suggested that 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy improved OS when given preoperatively in a similar magnitude to

those observed with adjuvant chemotherapy.10Neoadjuvant therapy offers the possibility for the 
identification of s urrogate clinical and biol ogical ma rkers that may c orrelate with res ponse to 
therapy and a potential long-term outcome. Studies that address  the role of preoperative 
chemotherapy have found chemotherapy compliance to be favorable  in the preoperative 
setting.6,7,8Randomized trials are currently on-going to explore the potenti al benefit of nivolumab 
in the adjuvant and locally adva nced unresectable NSCLC setting . In addition, the safety and 
efficacy profile of neoadjuvant nivolumab monotherapy or in com bination (nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab or nivolumab plus chemotherapy) are being evaluated in ongoing trials.   
The phase 3 study, CA209816, will evaluate the clinical efficac y and will establish the safety of 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab, especially nivolumab plus platinum d oublet chemotherapy, in 
resectable lung cancer. Specifically, this study will compare EFS and pCR rate among participants 
treated with neoadjuvant nivolumab plus platinum doublet chemot herapy vs participants treated 
with platinum doublet chemotherapy, and will describe pCR r ate and EFS for those treated with 
neoadjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab in Stage Ib-IIIa NSCLC.
3.1.1 Research Hypothesis
In participants with stage IB ( ≥4 cm), II or IIIA (N2) NSCLC considered resectable by the local  
multidisciplinary team, administration of neoadjuvant nivolumab  plus platinum doublet 
chemotherapy (up to 3 cycles) has superior efficacy to neoadjuv ant platinum doublet 
chemotherapy (up to 3 cycles).
3.2 Background
3.2.1 Indication Background
Approval of nivolumab in advanced NSCLC was based on 2 phase 3 trials (CheckMate 017 and 
CheckMate 057) which demonstrated survival benefit over docetax el across histologies. The 
approval in squamous NSCLC was based on the results of CA209017 , a randomized trial of 
nivolumab versus docetaxel. The median OS for patients in the n ivolumab arm was 9.2 months 
versus 6 months for those in the docetaxel arm (HR = 0.59). Im provement in survival was observed 
for nivolumab regardless of PD-L1 expression, though there was a trend toward better efficacy for 
those with PD-L1 expressing tumors. A single-arm trial (CA20906 3) of 117 patients with 
metastatic squamous NSCLC with progression after platinum-based chemotherapy and at least 
1 additional systemic regimen showed a 15% objective response ra te (ORR); 59% of participants 
with an ORR had response durations of 6 months or longer.11
The approval of nivolumab for the treatment of non-squamous NSCLC is based on a second phase 3 study, CA209057, which met its primary endpoint of superior OS of nivolumab versus docetaxel 
in patients with previously treated non-squamous NSCLC at a pre planned interim analysis (IA). 
Patients in the nivolumab arm had a 27% reduction in risk of de ath (HR = 0.73; P = 0.0015). 
Interaction P values, reported for PD-L1 e xpression subgroups by each of the predefined 
expression levels, suggested a clinically important signal of a  predictive association. Nivolumab 
also significantly improved ORR vs docetaxel (P=0.0246), with O RR as high as 36% in patients 
with PD-L1 expressing tumors. OS approximately doubled with niv olumab vs docetaxel at 1%,

seen between nivolumab and docetaxel when PD-L1 was not expresse d in the tumor, although 
these patients also experienced durable responses, and the safe ty profile was more favorable for 
nivolumab vs docetaxel.12
Although the first-line CA209026 trial did not demonstrate that  single agent nivolumab provided 
superior efficacy over platinum doublet chemotherapy, the effic acy of nivolumab was similar to 
that of chemotherapy in this first line patien t population. In the ongoing st udy CA209012, 
77 patients were treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W + ipilimumab  1 mg/kg Q12W or Q6W.
Overall response rates wer e observed in 43% of all treated pati ents and in 57% and 92% of patients 
with ≥1% and ≥50% tumor PD-L1 e xpression, respectively. Six investigator-assessed CRs (8%) 
and 3 pathologic responses wer e observed.  The median duration of response (DOR) was not 
reached in the overall p opulation or s ubpopulations. Duration of response ranged from 1.4+ to 
27.9+ months.13Recent 2-year OS data in CA 209012 showed survival data in all treated patients 
and by PD-L1 expression. All treated patients (n = 77) showed a  1 years OS of 76% and 2 year OS 
of 49%. When analyzed by PD-L1 expression, patients with ≥1% PD-L1 (n = 47) had a 1 years 
OS of 87% and 2 year OS of 58%, which increased to 100% and 62% , respectively for ≥50% 
PD-L1 patients. Nivolumab plus ipilimumab remained tolerable, a s most treatment-related AEs 
were manageable and no new safety concerns were identified in f ollow-up.14
The ongoing phase 3 CheckMate 227 study enrolled patients with stage IV or recurrent NSCLC 
that was not previously treated. Those with a level of tumor PD -L1 expression of at least 1% were 
randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab 
monotherapy, or chemotherapy;  those with a tumor PD-L1 e xpression level of less than 1% were 
randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab plus 
chemotherapy, or chemotherapy. Tumor mutational burden was determined by the FoundationOne CDx assay. Recently, in the pre-specified analysis of patients with high tumor mutational b urden 
at a prospective cutoff of ≥10 mutations/MB, progression-free survival was significantly lo nger 
in the group treated by nivolumab  plus ipilimumab compared to c hemotherapy, demonstrating a 
median PFS of 7 .2 months vs 5.5 months, respectively (HR 0.58; 97.5% CI 0.41, 0.81) (Nivolumab 
plus ipilimumab in lung cancer wit h a high tumor mutational bur den.
15The treatment effect was 
consistent in a pre-specified multi-variate analysis when adjus ted for PD-L1 expression, histology, 
and other clinical factors. The ORR was also significantly grea ter for the nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab group (45.3% vs 26.9%; tr eatment difference 18.4%; 9 5% CI (7.6, 28.8), and the 
responses appeared durable with 68% of responses ongoing after 1 year and the DOR not reached (95% CI 12.2, NR) compared to 5.4 months (95% CI 4.2,6.9) for chemotherapy. In patients with TMB <10 mut/Mb, ORR was 24.6% in  nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm and 25.9% in 
chemotherapy arm, HR for PFS being 1.07 (95% CI: 0.84, 1.35). I n all ra ndomized patients 
(irrespective of TMB or PD-L1 status), 1-year PFS was also high er with nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab than with chemotherapy [30.9% vs 17%; HR 0.83 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.96)]. The rate of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events in all tr eated population (regardless of TMB or

safety profile was overall consistent with previously reported d ata with no new safety signals.
Nivolumab added to chemotherapy has been evaluated in several c ohorts of chemotherapy-naïve 
subjects with advanced NSCLC in CA209012.16Nivolumab 10 mg/kg was combined with 
gemcitabine and cisplatin or pemetrexed and cisplatin. Nivoluma b 10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg was 
combined with paclitaxel an d carboplatin. The safety profile of  nivolumab plus platinum-doublet 
chemotherapy reflects additive toxicities of the individual age nts, which were manageable using 
established safety guidelines. No dose- limiting tox icities were observed during first 6 weeks of 
treatment. The ove rall response r ate across all the nivolumab and chemotherapy c ohorts range 
from 33-47% and median duration of response was 27.3 weeks. The  1-year survival rate for all 
cohorts combined is 71%. 
In the ongoing CheckMate 227 trial, data in patients with tumor  of <1% PD-L1 expression became 
also available recently.17In the setting of first line NSCLC with <1% tumor PD-L1 expression, 
PFS was improved with nivolumab plus chemotherapy vs chemothera py (mPFS: 5.6m vs 4.7m; 
HR=0.74 [95% CI: 0.58 to 0.94]), mPFS of nivolumab plus ipilimu mab was 4.4 months (95%CI: 
3.1 to 6.0). ORR wa s 36.7% in nivolumab plu s chemotherapy arm, 23.1% in chemotherapy arm, 
and 25.1% in nivolumab  plus ipilimumab arm. mDOR was 7.2 months  in nivolumab plus 
chemotherapy arm, 4.7 months in chemotherapy arm, and 18.0 mont hs in nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab arm. The rate of gra de 3 or 4 treatm ent-related adve rse events was 52% with 
nivolumab plus chemotherapy, 35% with chemotherapy, and 25% wit h nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab, overall, for nivolumab plus chemotherapy, the safet y profile and efficacy are 
consistent with previously reported data as w ell as d ata from other P D-(L)1 blockades in 
combination with chemotherapy.
Both nivolumab plus ipilimumab and nivolumab plus chemotherapy compare favorably in terms 
of the expected clinical benefit including response r ate and overall s urvival observed with platinum 
doublet chemotherapy i n first line NSCLC. These data suggest th at nivolumab plus ipilimumab or 
nivolumab plus platinum doublet chemotherapy have the potential  to provide superior pathologic 
response and event-free surviva l compared to platinum doublet c hemotherapy as neoadjuvant 
therapy in early-stage NSCLC.18
In general, nivolumab plus ipilimumab or nivolumab plus platinu m doublet chemotherapy is well 
tolerated, with a favorable safety profile relative to anticipa ted toxicities based on an 
immunostimulatory mechanism of action. Nivolumab plus ipilimuma b and nivolumab plus

3.2.2 Nivolumab Mechanism of Action
Cancer immunotherapy rests on the  premise that tumors can be re cognized as foreign rather than 
as self and can be effectively attacked by an activated immune system. An effective immune 
response in this setting is thought to rely on immune surveilla nce of tumor antigens expressed on 
cancer cells that ultimately results in an adaptive immune resp onse and cancer cell death. 
Meanwhile, tumor progression may depend upon acquisition of tra its that allow cancer cells to 
evade immunosurveillance and escape effective innate and adapti ve immune responses.19,20,21
Current immunotherapy efforts attempt to break the apparent tol erance of the immune system to 
tumor cells and antigens by eith er introducing cancer antigens by therapeutic vaccination or by 
modulating regulatory checkpoints  of the immune s ystem. T-cell stimulation is a complex process 
involving the integration of numerous positive as well as negat ive co-stimulatory signals in 
addition to antigen recognition by the T- cell r eceptor.22Collectively, these signals govern the 
balance between T- cell activation a nd tolerance. 
PD-1 is a member of the CD 28 family of T-cell co -stimulatory receptors that also includes CD28, 
CTLA 4, ICOS, and BTLA.23PD-1 signaling has been shown to inhibit CD-28-mediated 
upregulation of IL-2, IL-10, IL-13, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and Bc l-xL. PD-1 expression has also been 
noted to inhibit T cell activation, and expansion of previously  activated cells. Evidence for a 
negative regulatory  rol e of  PD-1 com e s  from  studi es of  PD-1 def icient mice, which develop a 
variety of autoimmune phenotypes.24These results suggest that PD-1 blockade has the potential 
to activate anti-self T -cell responses, but these responses are  variable and dependent upon various 
host genetic factors. Thus, PD-1 deficiency or inhibition is no t accompanied by a universal loss of 
tolerance to self-antigens.
In vitro, nivolumab (BMS-936558) binds to PD-1 with high affini ty (EC50 0.39-2.62 nM), and 
inhibits the binding of PD-1 to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 (IC 50 ±1 nM). Nivolumab binds 
specifically to PD-1 and not to rela ted members of the CD28 family such as CD28, ICOS, CTLA-4 
and BTLA. Blockade of the PD-1 pathway by nivolumab results in a  reproducible enhancement 
of both proliferation and IFN-γ release in the mixed lymphocyte  reaction (MLR). Using a CMV 
restimulation assay with human PBMC, the effect of nivoluma b on antigen specific recall response 
indicates that nivolumab augmented  IFN-γ secretion from CMV spe cific memory T cells in a 
dose-dependent manner versus isotype-matched control. In vivo b lockade of PD-1 by a murine 
analog of nivolumab enhances the anti-tumor immune response and result in tumor rejection in 
several immunocompetent mouse tumor models (MC38, SA1/N, and PA N02).25

3.2.3 Ipilimumab Mechanism of Action
CTLA-4, an activation-induced T-cell surface molecule, is a mem ber of the CD28:B7 
immunoglobulin superfamily that comp etes with CD28 for B7. CTLA -4 mediated signals are 
inhibitory and turn off T cell-dependent immune responses.26Ipilimumab is a fully human 
monoclonal IgG1κ that binds to the CTLA-4 antigen expressed on a subset of T cells from human 
and nonhuman primates. The proposed mechanism of action for ipi limumab is interference of the 
interaction of CTLA-4 with B7 molecules on APCs, with subsequen t blockade of the inhibitory 
modulation of T-cell activation promoted by the CTLA 4/B7 inter action.
3.2.4 Nivolumab Combined with Ipilimumab Clinical ActivityCA209012 (Checkmate 012) is a multi- arm phase 1b trial evaluati ng the safety and tolerability of 
nivolumab in patients with chemotherapy-naïve advanced NSCLC, a s either a monotherapy or in 
combination with other agents including ipilimumab, at differen t doses and schedules. The primary 
endpoint of the  study was safety with secondary endpoints of ob jective response rates (ORR) and 
24-week PFS. Exploratory endpoints included OS and efficacy by PD-L1 expression. In the study, 
patients were tested for PD-L1 and 69% had evaluable PD-L1 expression. Participants were 
enrolled to receive nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q 12W or Q6W (n = 77), and 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W (n = 52). ORR was 43% in all tr eated patients and 57% and 92% in 
patients with ≥ 1% and ≥ 50% tum or PD-L 1 expression, respectivel y, 6 investigator-assessed CRs 
(8%); including 3 pathologic responses were achieved in the niv olumab 3 mg/kg Q2W + 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg  Q12W/Q6W cohorts. The median duration of re sponse (DOR) was not 
reached in the overall population or s ubpopulations.  Duration of  response ranged from 1.4+ to 
27.9+ months . 
The rate of treatment-related adverse events in the Q12W/Q6W (7 9%) arms were comparable to 
monotherapy (73%). In the study, Grades 3 to 4 AEs were 36% and  19% for the Q12W/Q6W and 
nivolumab monotherapy arms, respectively. Treatment-related Gra d e  3 - 4  A E s  l e d  t o

patients across all tr eatment arms were skin-related (31%), gastrointestin al (19%), endocrine 
(18%), and pulmo nary (6%). 
As described in Section 3.2.1 , ongoing phase 3 CheckM ate 227 study ra ndomized patients with 
stage IV or recurrent NSCLC that was not previously treated in various study treatment arms by 
tumor PD-L1 status. Recently, in the pre-specified analysis of patients with high tumor mu tational 
burden at a prospective cutoff of ≥ 10 mutations/MB, progressio n-free survival was significantly 
longer in the group treated by nivolumab plus ipilimumab compar ed to chemotherapy, HR of PFS 
being 0.58 (97.5% CI 0.41, 0.81). The treatment effect was consi stent and independent of PD-L1 
expression, or histology. The ORR was also significantly greate r for the nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab group (45.3% vs 26.9%) and the responses appeared mo re durable with median DoR 
not reached (95% CI 12.2, NR) compared to 5 .4 month s (95% CI 4.2, 6.9) for chemotherapy. In 
patients with TMB <10 mut/Mb, similar efficacy was seen in term s of PFS and ORR between 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab and chemotherapy. The safety profile was overall consistent with

previously reported data with no new safety signals. In another  readout focusing on patients with 
tumor of <1% PD-L1 expression, nivolumab plus ipilimumab showed  similar efficacy to 
chemotherapy in terms of PFS and ORR but with much longer D oR, with a consistent safety profile 
of previously reported data. 
As of revised protocol 03, the nivolumab plus ipilimumab has st opped enrollment.
3.2.5 Immuno-oncology Treatment Combined with Chemotherapy Clinical 
Activity
The combination of immuno-oncology agents and traditional chemo therapy has been explored. In 
addition to the additive effects of combining drugs with differ ent mechanisms of action, emerging 
evidence indicates that one of the mechanisms of actions of che motherapy is via activation of the 
immune system through multiple pathways.13The subsequent cytotoxic cell d eath from 
chemotherapies and subsequent a ntigen release may provide  immun e stimulation. Certain 
chemotherapy regimens have a broad effect on cell d eath and physiological response. As an 
example, cyclophosphamide reduces the number of circulating Tre g cells, which are a key 
component in immunosuppre ssion and gemcitabine have also been s hown to reduce MDSCs and 
hence interferon-gamma, which have inhibitory roles in the immu ne response.27,28The dual role 
of cytotoxicity and immune activation from chemotherapy has pro vided the biological rationale 
for the development of combinations with immunotherapy.29
Nivolumab added to chemotherapy has been evaluated in several c ohorts of chemotherapy-naive 
patients with advanced NSCLC in study Checkmate 012. Nivolumab 10 mg/kg was combined with 
gemcitabine and cisplatin or pemetrexed + cisplatin. Nivolumab 10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg was 
combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin.
The safety profile of nivoluma b plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy reflects additive toxiciti es of 
the individual agents, which were manageable using established safety guidelines. No 
dose-limiting toxicities were observed during first 6 weeks of treatment. The frequency of most 
immune-related select AEs was higher for the combination than w hat has been observed for 
nivolumab monotherapy. However, these treatment-related AEs, including pneumonitis, were 
effectively managed and did not lead to any d eaths. Pneumonitis of any grade was reported in 
7 subjects (13%): Grade 3-4 in 4 subjects (7%). Twelve (21%) sub jects discontinued due to 
treatment-related AEs ( Table 3.2.5-1 ).

combination with chemotherapy.
3.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
The early-stage (IB-III) NSCLC represents a population o f high unmet need with a 5-year s urvival 
rate of 25-50%. The current av ailable SOC, including adjuvant o r neoadjuvant platinum doublet 
chemotherapy, only provides a 5% absolute improvement in 5-year  OS.
Follow-up of adjuvant trials are long and may require decades b efore a new tr eatment is introduced 
into clinical practice. Preoperative or neoadjuvant chemotherap y has been assessed in a number of 
trials for participants with operable NSCLC. A meta-analysis based on 7 trials involving 
988 participants suggested that neoadjuvant chemotherapy improve d OS when given 
preoperatively in a similar magnitude to those observed with adjuvant chemotherapy. Several 
studies have also shown preoperative cytotoxic chemotherapy to be safe prior to surgical resection 
of NSCLC with no difference in extent of surgical procedures pe rformed, operative morbidity and 
mortality.
The clinical activity o f nivoluma b observed to date in NSCLC, including 2 positive phase 3 studie s 
demonstrati ng prol onged s urvival with nivolumab monotherapy compared to docetaxel in 
squamous and non-squamous NSCLC after platinum failure, suggest s the potential f or improved 
clinical outcomes. CA209057 (non-squamous NSCLC) study demonstrated OS was superior for 
participants receiving nivolumab compared to those receiving do cetaxel. In this study, interaction 
P values reported for PD-L1 e xpression s ubgroups by each of the pre-defined expression levels 
suggested a clinically important signal of a predictive associa tion. Higher confirmed ORRs in 
PD-L1 expressors were seen in the combination arm compare to th e nivolumab monotherapy arm 
in CA209012. Based on these data,  CA209816 will st ratify partic ipants based on PD-L1 status, 
disease stage at randomization, and gender.  
In CA209012, ni volumab plus ipilimumab provides a higher ORR (4 3%) than nivolumab 
alone.27,30In first-line metastatic NSCLC, this regimen also provided enco uraging overall survival, 
with an acceptable safety profile. Combination of anti-PD1 plus  chemotherapy has also shown 
encouraging ORR and PFS with an acceptable safety profile compa red to platinum doublet 
chemotherapy in first-line metastatic NSCLC. These data support  our b elief that combination of 
nivolumab with ipilimumab or platinum doublet chemotherapy will  demonstrate superior benefit 
over platinum chemotherapy doublets in the neoadjuvant setting with an acceptable safety profile.

In general, nivolumab is well tolerated, with a favorable safety  profile relative to anticipated 
toxicities based on an immunostimulatory mechanism of action. O verall, the safety profile of 
nivolumab monotherapy as well as combination therapy is managea ble and generally consistent 
across completed and ongoing clinical trials with no maximum to lerated dose (MTD) reached at 
any dose tested up to 10 mg/kg. Most AEs were low-grade (Grade 1  to 2) with relatively few 
related high-grade (Grade 3 to 4) AEs. There was no pattern in the incidence, severity, or causality 
of AEs with respect to nivolumab dose level.
The ongoing phase 3 CheckMate 227 study randomized patients wit h stage IV or recurrent NSCLC 
not previously treated in various  study treatment arms by tumor  PD-L1 status. Recently, in the 
pre-specified analysis of patients with high tumor mu tational  burden at a prospective cutoff of ≥ 10 
mutations/MB, PFS was significan tly longer in the group treated  by nivolumab plus ipilimumab 
compared to chemotherapy, HR of PFS being 0.58 (97.5% CI 0.41, 0.81). The treatment effect 
was consistent and independent of PD-L1 expression, or histology. The ORR was also significantly 
greater for the nivolumab p lus ipilimumab group (45.3% vs 26.9%) and the responses appeared 
more durable with median DoR not reached (95% CI 12.2, NR) compared to 5.4 months (95% CI 
4.2, 6.9) for chemotherapy. In patients with TMB <10 mut/Mb, si milar efficacy was seen in terms 
of PFS and ORR between nivolumab plus ipilimumab and chemothera py. The safety profile was 
overall consistent with previously reported data with no new saf ety signals. In another readout 
focusing on patients with tumor of <1% PD-L1 expression, nivolu mab plus ipilimumab showed 
similar efficacy to chemotherapy in terms of PFS and ORR but wi th much longer DoR, the safety 
profile was consistent with previously reported data.
In the setting of first line NSCLC with  <1% tumor PD-L1 e xpression in the ongoing CheckMate 
227 trial, PFS was improved with nivolumab plus chemotherapy vs  chemotherapy (mPFS: 5.6m

The potential benefit of nivolumab plus ipilimumab or nivolumab  plus platinum doublet 
chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy in Stage I-III NSCLC are no t yet known. The platinum 
doublet ch emotherapy regimens have w ell described safety profiles, characterized by 
myelosuppression and other reg imen-specific non-hematologic tox icities, such as peripheral 
neuropathy, nausea/vomiting, and renal impairment. 
In order to assess the potential benefit of nivolumab plus plat inum doublet chemotherapy over 
platinum doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy in Stage I -III resectable NSCLC, this trial 
will rando mize participants to 2 arms: nivolumab plus platinum doublet chemotherapy, or platinum 
doublet ch emotherapy alone. Under revised protocol 02, particip ants already enrolled in the 
original 2-arm part and in the arm of nivolumab plus ipilimumab  in the 3-arm part per revised 
protocol 02 will continue scheduled trial procedures. To assure  an ongoing favorable risk/benefit 
assessment for participants enrolled onto CA209816, an independe nt Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC) will be utilized to monitor the safety and activity of th e treatments throughout the conduct 
of the trial.4 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS

5 STUDY DESIGN
5.1 Overall Design
This is an open-label, randomized clinical trial of up to 3 cyc les of neoadjuvant nivolumab 
(3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) and a single dose of 1 mg/kg dose of ipil imumab, nivolumab 360mg flat 
dose plus platinum doublet chemotherapy (up to 3 cycles), or pl atinum doublet chemotherapy (up

to 3 cycles) as neoadjuvant treatment in participants with early  stage (Stage IB [ ≥4 cm], II, and 
resectable IIIA [N2]) NSCLC. 
The original study design (before revised protocol 02) had two arms. After signing the informed 
consent form and upon confirmation of the participant’s eligibi lity, participants were randomized 
in an open-label fashion (1:1 ratio) to either neoadjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab or platinum 
doublet chemotherapy.
Revised protocol 02 added a new, neoadjuvant nivolumab plus plat inum doublet chemotherapy 
arm. When the third arm had opened and as each site had receive d IRB/EC approval of revised 
protocol 02, the IRT switched to a 1:1: 1 randomization at the respective site.  Starting from that 
point on, the sites were only enrolling under revised protocol 02. 
Revised protocol 03 withholds rando mization into the arm of neoadjuvant nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab but continues randomizing eligible participants into  either neoadjuvant nivolumab plus 
platinum doublet chemotherapy arm  or platinum doublet chemotherapy arm. Participants already 
randomized in the original 2-arm part (neoadjuvant nivolumab pl us ipilimumab vs neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy) and in the arm of neoadjuvant nivolumab plus ipil imumab in 3-arm part defined 
by revised protocol 02 will remain in trial and continue schedu led trial procedures.
Participants will be randomized between 2 arms in a 1:1 r atio to neoadjuvant nivolumab plus 
platinum doublet chemot herapy or platinum doub let chemo therapy. Eligible participants will be 
stratified by:
•PD-L1 expression ( ≥1% or <1%/not evaluable/indeterminate)
•Disease stage (IB/II vs IIIA)
•Gender
PD-L1 status will be determined by immunohistochemical (IHC) st aining of PD-L1 protein in the 
submitted tumor sample and categorized as follows: 
•PD-L1 positive - defined as ≥1% tumor cell membrane staining positive in a minimum of 
100 evaluable tumor cells
•PD-L1 negative – defined as < 1% tumor cell membrane staining positive in a minimum of 
100 evaluable tumor cells
•PD-L1 not evaluable/indeterminate - defined as participants with insufficient sample quantity 
or quality to stain for PD-L1 status or those participants in whose samples PD-L1 status could 
not be determined despite appropriate amounts of tissue sample.  For the purpose of 
stratification, this category w ill be grouped with PD-L1 negative participants. No more than 
10% of participants enrolled in this trial will be PD-L1 not ev aluable/indeterminate category.
Screening begins by establishi ng the particip ant’s initial elig ibility and signing of the informed 
consent (ICF). Tum or tissue (archival [slides/block ≤3 month] or recent tumor biopsy) must be 
submitted to a third-party vendor for determination of PD-L1 status prior to randomization.
All screening assessments and procedures must be performed in accordance with Table 2-1.

Within 7 days of randomization, the participants must receive t he first dose of study medication. 
Participants may be dosed no less than 12 days between nivoluma b doses in Arm A and no less 
than 18 days between nivolumab doses in Arm C. If a dose is del ayed for any reason, participants 
should be dosed no later than 7 days following a planned dose o n any arm. If more than 7 days 
delay is needed for any reason, the intended dose should be skipped. If a participant receiving chemotherapy on a Day 1 and Day 8 schedule (ie, cisplatin/gemcit abine) is unable to receive Day 
1 of chemotherapy but recovers in time to receive the Day 8 dos e, the Day 8 dose of chemotherapy 
may be administered. Doses that are skipped or missed will not be replaced. Surgery s hould be 
performed within 6 weeks after completing up t o 3 cy cles (last dose) of neodjuvant treatment as 
indicated by the institutional SOC.  
•For participants who are unable to tolerate cisplatin, the reas ons for intolerability should be

All Arms
PET/CT including contrast from the base of the skull to upper thighs will be performed at baseline 
(within 28 days prior t o randomization) and within 14 days prior to planned definitive surgery. A 
separate CT, with contrast, of the chest, abdomen, and all other suspected sites of disease (as well as the PET/CT) is required if the CT component of a PET/CT is n ot of sufficient diagnostic quality 
for RECIST 1.1 measurements. Subsequent radiologic assessments C T, with contrast, of the chest 
including adrenal glands and CT or MRI of other additional susp ected/known sites of disease will 
be performed in accordance with Table 2-3 and Table 2-4. Tumor assessments must continue per 
protocol until disease recurrence/progression is confirme d by BICR per RECIST 1.1 ( Appendix 5 ),
even after the initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapies. Exceptions are cases where disease 
progression does not preclude surgery, regardless of whether it  has been confirmed by BICR, 
participants should proceed to definitive surgery and continue to get tumor assessments per Table 
2-3and Table 2-4. Tumor assessments should be done as per Table 2-3 for those who did not get 
definitive surgery. Pharmacokinetics assessments are described in Section 9.5 , and biomarker 
assessments are described in Section 9.8. OS will be followed continuously every 3 months via in-
person or phone contact after Post-neoadjuvant Follow-up Visit 2 or after completion of adjuvant 
therapy, when applicable.

will recommend continuation, modification, or discontinuation o f this study based on reported 
safety data. Representatives of the Sponsor w ill serve only as c oordinators of the committee, 
without having full member responsibilities or privileges. In a ddition, the Sponsor will 
independently review safety data in a blinded manner during the  conduct of this trial to ensure that 
any safety issues are identified and addressed. Available effic acy data will also be reviewed by the 
DMC during the conduct of the study. Details of the DMC respons ibilities and procedures will be 
specified in the DMC charter.
Independent Radiology/Pathology Review
Independent pathology and radiol ogy review will be established for central review and 
confirmation of endpoints. Images and tumor/lymph node samples will be submitted to these 
third-party vendors for central review. Sites will be trained p rior to enrolling the first study 
participant. Images and pathology  samples acqui sition gui delines and submission process will be 
outlined in the study Imaging/Laboratory Manuals to be provided  by the vendors. 
Independent Pathology Review: Tumor and lymph node collection fr om definitive surgical 
resection and sampling of fresh tumor sample in RNAlater for bio marker studies (as applicable 
dependent on size of residual tumor) is mandatory on the day of  surgery. RNAlater sample will 
not be collected in China. Processing of the remainder of the s pecimens for histopathologic 
analysis should be performed  within 72 hours of the procedure. Sections will be used for central 
pathology review assessing pathologic complete response (pCR) a nd major pathological response 
(MPR). Any tumor, tumor bed, or lymph node specimens that are r eviewed locally must be 
submitted for central pathology review. Gross examination on th e entire specimen should be 
performed which includes all tum or, associated ly mph node tissue, and uninvolved parenchyma. 
The specimen should be sectioned at 0.5 cm intervals, and block s should be submitted for the full 
cross section for every other 0.5 cm interval. For very large t umors with no gross evidence of 
response, a minimum of 1 slide/cm is required for assessment of  pathologic response. When 
estimating viable tumor, in situ carcinoma should not be includ ed. Pathology specimen collection 
and processing guidelines are outlined in the CA209816 Laborato ry Manual. A blinded pathology 
review process will be utilized to assess for confirmation of e ndpoints.
Independent Radiology Review: Radiologic tumor assessments will  be sent to and reviewed by a 
Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) from a third-party ra diology vendor on an on-going 
basis. At the time of investigator assessed radiographic progres sion per RECIST 1.1, the site must 
request a BICR- review confirmation of progression or recurrence . However, BICR confirmation 
of progression should not be requested if investigator j udges the progression does not preclude

protocol 03. 
In addition, it is expected to have around 70 participants rando mized in the original 2-arm st udy 
(Arm A and Arm B) and approximately another 75 participants rand omized in the arm of 
neoadjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab (Arm A) when the study ha d 3 arms. 
5.3 End of Study Definition
The start of the trial is defined as the first participant’s fi rst visit. The analysis of pCR rate will 
take place after 350 participants on Arms B and C from 1:1:1 randomization defined by revised 
protocol 02, and 1:1 randomization by revised protocol 03 have the opportunity for surgery. After 
this analysis, participants will be followed for EFS and OS. Two formal interim analyses for EFS 
are planned after 148 events and 167 events have been observed in the participants on Arms B and 
C, which is projected  to occur a pproximately 48 and 58 months after 1:1:1 randomization (the 
second interim analysi s will take  place when 167 events are observed  
). Thes e formal comparisons of EFS will 
allow for determination of superiority. The final analysis (FA) of EFS will be c onducted after 
approximately 185 participants in Arms B and C have experienced an event (approximately 73
months from 1:1:1 ra ndomization), or 4 years after the last par ticipant’s randomization.  
 
5.4 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
5.4.1 Rationale for Open-Label Design
This study will use an open-label design. Due to the obvious di fference in chemotherapy- and 
immunotherapy-related toxicities, histology-dependent chemother apy options, different dose 
modification rules for safety management, including different d ose delay rules per arm, and 
different premedication requirements according to chemotherapy,  an open-label design is

appropriate. An open-label design will also help ensure that im mune-related tox icities in 
participant receiving immunotherapy are promptly identified and  managed.
Because this study will be open-label, independent pathology an d radiology review will be used 
for central review and confirmation of pathologic and clinical responses in all randomized 
participants to determine all response-related endpoints.
5.4.2 Rationale for Preoperative Systemic Therapy in NSCLC
Follow-up of adjuvant trials may  require decades until a new tr eatment can be introduced into the 
early treatment setting. Preoperative chemotherapy has been ass essed in a number of trials for 
patients with resectable NSCLC, though most trials were closed early when the adjuvant 
chemotherapy data revealed a survi val advantage. A meta-analysi s based upon 7 trials involving 
988 participants suggested that neoadjuvant chemotherapy improv ed OS when given 
preoperatively (5-year survival 20% vs 14% without neoadjuvant chemotherapy). This 
improvement in survival is similar to that noted in the meta-an alyses of predominantly adjuvant 
chemotherapy.31,32
Several studies have shown preoperative cytotoxic chemotherapy to be safe prior to surgical 
resection of NSCLC with no difference in extent of s urgical procedures pe rformed, operative 
morbidity, and mortality.6,33,34Immune checkpoint inhibition has the potential to provide benef its 
in early-stage disease. Among these benefits are the opportunity to evaluate EFS in a 
moderate-sized population of early-stage NSCLC patients and the  potential to demonstrate 
long-term, disease-free s tatus in these patients .7,35,36,37
5.4.3 Rationale for Immuno-oncology Treatment in Neoadjuvant NSCLC
In contrast to the adjuvant setting in which only micrometastat ic disease is present, one may 
hypothesize that the higher tum or burden present at the time of  induction treatment may be 
necessary for abundant antigen release and presentation to the immune system, and consequently, 
development of a robust immune response to immune checkpoint in hibitors. 
In an ongoing feasibility trial with nivolumab monotherapy, a m ajor pathologic res ponse (MPR) 
rate was observed in 45% (9/20) of stage IB-IIIA NSCLC particip ants who were evaluable post-
surgery after 2 cycles of nivolumab. Two patients (10%, 2/20) a chieved a pathologic complete
response. Major pathologic response was defined as ≤10% residual viable tumor at resection.38
Responses were observed across histology and regardless of PD-L1  expression. High tumor 
mutation burden and neoantigen density was associated with pathological response following 
neoadjuvant nivolumab treatment. With a median post-op follow-u p of 12 months (range of 0.8 to 
19.7 months), 1 patient with MPR had a mediastinal lymph-node r ecurrence that was treated with 
concurrent chemoradiation and was free from further progression at more than 12 months of 
follow-up. Two patients without MPR have recurrence of lung cancer (1 solitary brain metastasis 
which was treated with radiotherapy and has no evidence of furt her recurrence at more than 16 
months of follow-up; 1 systemic rec urrence 1 year after surgery and died from recurrent disease 4 
months later). Two additional deaths were reported including 1 disease progression in an 
unresected patient and 1 death not related to drug or disease).

Nivolumab was well toler ated with a safety profile comparable to that observed in the p hase 3 
program. Administration of nivolumab in the neoadjuvant setting  was deemed to be feasible with 
no surgical delays or post-surgical complications (within 30 days post-surgery). This trial was 
recently expanded to include an additional 30 participants, who  will be tr eated with nivolumab 
monotherapy (n=15) and nivolumab plus ipilimumab (n=15). In addition, nivoluma b monotherapy 
will be extended to 3 cycles. It is hypothesized that the additi on of a single dose of ipilimumab to 
3 doses of nivolumab and the addition of chemotherapy to nivolu mab will result in the achievement 
of higher rate and deeper pathologic responses while maintainin g an acceptable safety profile.
The 45% MPR rate from nivolumab in neoa djuvant NSCLC compares with a r ate of approximately 
20% from platinum doublet chemotherapy in this con text. The pCR of 10% also compar es 
favorably to the histo rically obse rved pCR r ate of approximately 4% with platinum doublet 
chemotherapy. 
In another ongoing phase 2 trial , patients with resectable stage IIIA N2 NSCLC r eceive 3 cycles 
of neoadjuvant therapy consisting of nivolumab 360mg IV plus pa clitaxel/carboplatin IV Q3W 
then proceed to definitive surgery after which patients receive  1 year adjuvant nivolumab.39In the 
first 22 patients in whom surgical resection was performed foll owing neoadjuvant therapy, pCR 
was recorded in 13 patients (60%), MPR was noted  in a further 4  patients (18%). Neoadjuvant 
nivolumab plus paclitaxel/carboplatin was well tolerated and su rgery was not delayed. 
These findings, coupled with encouraging survival data from niv olumab plus ipilimumab and anti-
PD1 plus chemotherapy in first-line advanced NSCLC suggest that  nivolumab plus ipilimumab, 
especially nivolumab plus platinum doublet chemotherapy, may im prove both EFS and pathologic 
response relative t o plati num doublet chemotherapy, while provi ding an acceptable safety profile 
in the neoadjuvant treatment of NSCLC.27
5.4.3.1 Rationale for Combination of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab (Arm A):
Combining immunotherapeutic agents with different mechanisms of  action offers the possibility 
of synergistic response. PD-1 and CTLA-4 are both co-inhibitory  molecules, but evidence suggests 
that they use distinct mechanisms, to limit T-cell activation. P reliminary indirect data from 
peripheral T-cell assessments suggests that a given T-cell chec kpoint inhibitor may modulate host 
immune cell phenotype rendering them more susceptible to altern ate checkpoint inhibitors and 
thereby enhancing anti-tumor activity.
Preclinical data indicate that the combination of PD-1 and CTLA -4 receptor blockade may 
improve antitumor activity. In vitro combinations of nivolumab plus ipilimumab increase IFN-γ 
production 2- to 7-fold over either agent alone in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. Increased 
antitumor activity of the combination was also observed in 3 of  5 syngeneic murine cancer models. 
In a murine melanoma vaccine model, blockade with either CTLA-4  or PD-1 antibodies increased 
the proporti on of CTLA-4 and PD-1-e xpressing CD4/CD8 tumor infiltrating T effector cells, and 
dual blockade increased tumor infiltration of  T effect or cells and decreased intratumoral 
T regulatory cells, as compared to either agent alone.40

The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab was evaluated in CA 209004 (MDX1106 -04), a 
phase 1b, multiple ascending dose study in participants with tr eatment-naive and 
previously-treated advanced melanoma. Results showed promising activity with higher but 
tolerable toxicity than ipilimumab alone. Based on these data, CA209069, a phase 2 study, 
compared the combination to ipilimumab alone in treatment-naïve  participants with advanced 
melanoma: nivolumab  1 mg/kg and ip ilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks versus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses.41In 
participants with BRAF wild type tumors, the ORR was 61% (44/72), including 22% (16/72) CRs 
in the group treated with the combination, compared to 11% (4/3 7) with 0 CRs in those treated 
with ipilimumab alone. The median PFS was not reached in the co mbination versus 4.4 months 
for ipilimumab alone (HR = 0.4). Recently, a phase 3 study (CA209 067, n = 945) reported 
significantly improved PFS and ORR with the combinati on of nivolumab and ip ilimumab versus 
ipilimumab alone in previously unt reated melanoma. The median PF S was 6.9 months (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 4.3 to 9.5) in the nivolumab group, 11.5 months (95% CI, 8.9 to 16.7) in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group, and 2.9 months (95% CI, 2. 8 to 3.4) in the ipilimumab 
group. Significantly longer PFS was observed in the nivolumab p lus ipilimumab group than in the 
ipilimumab group (ha zard ratio for death or disease progression , 0.42; 99.5% CI, 0.31 to 0.57; 
P < 0.001) and in the nivolumab group than in the ipilimumab group (hazard ratio, 0.57; 99.5% 
CI, 0.43 to 0.76; P < 0.001). The hazard ratio for the comparison  between the nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab group and the nivolumab group was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.60 to 0.92).
42
In addition, deep and durable responses were observed in previo usly treated, extensive stage small 
cell lung cancer (SCLC), with a response r ate of 31.1% with the combination of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab.43
Based on the initial data in melanoma and the activity observed with nivolumab and ipilimumab 
in lung cancer, the nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination has been also evaluated as first-line 
therapy in participants with advanced NSCLC. In CA209012, early  combination cohorts evaluated 
2 dosing schedules that were studied in the CA209004 study in me lanoma.44
•Nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg, every 3 weeks for 4 dos es, followed by nivolumab 
3 mg/kg q 2 weeks (Arms G and H, n=24);
•Nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg, every 3 weeks for 4 dos es, followed by nivolumab 
3 mg/kg q 2 weeks (Arms I and J, n=25)
These regimens resulted in signi ficant toxicity, with 39% of pa rticipants discontinuing treatment 
due to a treatment-related adverse event. Thus, additional comb ination cohorts were initiated 
(Arms N, O, P, Q), using lower doses of both nivolumab and ipili mumab, or the approved dose of 
nivolumab with less frequent dosing of ipilimumab. These new re gimens were better tolerated, 
and the safety data are not dissimilar to what has been observe d in the nivolumab monotherapy 
cohort (Arm F in CA209012) ( Table 5.4.3.1-1 ).

Recently, the  pooled results from the  CA209012 (Checkmate 012) nivolumab 3 m g/kg Q2W and 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q12W and Q6W cohorts showed continued clinic al benefit (OS and PFS) 
with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in all patients and those with ≥1% and ≥50% tumor PD-L1 
expression.45ORR was 43% in all treated patients and 57% and 92% in patients  with ≥ 1% and 
≥50% tumor PD-L1 expression, respectively, consistent with the p revious report. Additionally, 
6 investigator-assessed complete re sponses ([CRs] 8%; including 3 pathologic responses) were 
achieved in the Q12W/Q6W cohorts.46Median duration of response had not yet been reached in 
the overall  population or in subgroups with <1%, ≥1%, or ≥50% PD-L1 expression; durati on of 
response ra nged from 1.4+ to 27.9+ months. All treated patients (n = 77) showed a 1 year OS of 
76% and 2 year OS of 49%. When analyzed by PD-L1 e xpression, patients with ≥1% PD-L1 
(n = 47) had a 1 years OS of 87% and 2 year OS of 58%, which incr eased to 100% and 62%, 
respectively for ≥50% PD-L1 patients. Nivolumab plus ipilimumab remained tolerabl e, as most 
treatment-related AEs w ere manageable and no new safety concern s were identified in follow-up.

stage IV or recurrent NSCLC that was not previously treated in various study treatment arms by 
tumor PD-L1 status. Recentl y, in the pre-specified analysis of patients with high tumor mu tational
burden at a prospective cutoff of ≥10 mutations/MB, progression-free survival was significantly 
longer in the group treated by nivolumab plus ipilimumab compar ed to chemotherapy, HR of PFS

expression or histology. The ORR was also significantly greater  for the nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab group (45.3% vs 26.9%) and the responses appeared mo re durable with median DoR 
not reached (95% CI 12.2, NR) compared to 5 .4 month s (95% CI 4.2, 6.9) for chemotherapy. In 
patients with TMB < 10 mut/Mb, similar efficacy was seen in ter ms of PFS and ORR between 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab and chemotherapy. The safety profile was overall consistent with 
previously reported data with no new safety signals. In another  readout focusing on patients with 
tumor of <1% PD-L1 expression, nivolumab plus ipilimumab showed  similar efficacy to 
chemotherapy in terms of PFS and ORR but with much longer DoR, the safety profile was 
consistent with previously reported data.
5.4.3.2 Rationale for PD-1 Inhibitor with Chemotherapy (Arm C)
The interaction of a tumor with the immune system is complex. T umors and the tumor 
microenvironment are known to express a variety of factors that  impede a robust immune response 
from eliminating the  tumor. Soluble and membrane-bound factors have been shown to inhibit the 
cytolytic activity of tumor infiltrating T-cells (eg, PD-L1 exp ression; TGF-beta). In addition, some 
tumor-derived factors are able to enhance the immune system cou nter-regulatory systems 
(eg, increased T-regulatory cells). Finally, suboptimal tumor an tigen delivery and presentation has 
been postulated as another mechanism by which tumors can succes sfully evade immune system 
recognition. 
Cancer therapeutics such as ch emotherapy may modulate tumor/immu ne-system interactions in 
favor of the immune system. Chemotherapy can result in tumor cell death with a resultant increase 
in tumor antigen delivery to antigen-presenting cells. Tumor ce ll death may also lead to a reduction 
in soluble and membrane-bound factors inhibiti ng tumor-inf iltrating T-cells. Chemotherapy may 
also disrupt immune system regulatory networks by decreasing nu mbers of T-regulatory cells.
Nivolumab added to chemotherapy has been evaluated in several c ohorts of chemotherapy-naive 
subjects with advanced NSCLC in study CA209012. Nivolumab 10 mg /kg was combined with 
gemcitabine and cisplatin and pemetrexed + cisplatin. Nivolumab  10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg was 
combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin. 
The safety profile of nivoluma b plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy reflects additive toxiciti es of 
the individual agents, which were manageable using established safety guidelines. No 
dose-limiting toxicities were observed during first 6 weeks of treatment. The frequency of most 
immune-related select AEs was higher for the combination than w hat has been observed for 
nivolumab monotherapy. However, these treatment-related AEs, including pneumonitis, were 
effectively managed and did not lead to any d eaths. Pneumonitis of any grade was reported in 
7 subjects (13%): Grade 3-4 in 4 subjects (7%). Twelve (21%) sub jects discontinued due to 
treatment-related AEs ( Table 5.4.3.2-1 ).
The overall response rate across all the nivolumab and chemothe rapy cohorts ranged from 33-47% 
and median duration of response was 27.3 weeks. In the 15 partic ipants that received nivolumab 
10 mg/kg plus pemetrexed and cisplatin, 47% achieved a PR or CR. In the 12 participants that 
received nivolumab 10 mg/kg plus gemcitabine and cisplatin, 33%  achieved a CR or PR. The 
1-year survival rate was 87% ( Table 5.4.3.2-2 ).

NSCLC with <1% tumor PD-L1 expression, PFS was improved with ni volumab plus

adverse events was 52% with nivolumab plus chemotherapy , 35% with chemotherapy, and 25% 
with nivolumab plus ipilimumab, overall, for nivolumab plus che motherapy, the safety profile and 
efficacy are consistent with previously reported data as well a s data from other PD-(L)1 blockades 
in combination with chemotherapy.
5.4.4 Rationale for Pathologic Response
Pathologic complete response (pCR) has been long known to c orrelate with survival after tumor 
resection. Recently, th e FDA approved pe rtuzumab based on patho logic response rate for the 
treatment of locally advanced breast cancer. In the ongoing fea sibility trial with nivolumab 
monotherapy, 2 out of 20 (10%) patients achieved  pCR. In anothe r ongoing phase II trial (NADIM) 
to evaluate neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy, 13 out of 22 (60%) patien ts achieved pCR. 
These compare favorably to the approximate 4% pCR in NSCLC observed histori cally with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. It is predicted that patients treated  with the combination o f nivolumab 
plus ipilimumab, especially nivolumab plus platinum doublet chem otherapy, will achieve a higher 
pCR r ate than in patients treated with nivolumab monotherapy. Theref ore, pCR will be one of 
primary objectives.
In a recent publication by Hellmann and colleagues, major patho logic response (MPR), defined as 
≤10% viable tumor, was proposed  as a better surrogate for s urvival and is observed in

approximately  22% of NSCLC p atients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.47This proposed 
surrogate for survival was supported by the data from a prospective study and retrosp ective 
study.48, 49Pataer and colleagues used a score system that quantifies the percentage of viable tumor 
cells and demonstrated that there is a statistically significan t correlatio n betwee n higher percentage 
of viable cells and shorter disease-free and OS in patients who  received induction treatment. This 
correlation was not evident in patients treated with upfront su rgery alone. The 5-year recurrence-
free survival for patients with and without a pathologic response were 78% and 35%, respectively 
(P < 0.001). The 5-year overall survival f or patients with and without a pathologic response were 
85% and 40%, respectively (P < 0.0001). In the on-going feasibi lity CA209159 trial with 
nivolumab monotherapy, a MPR rate of 45% (9/20) was observed in  stage IB-IIIA NSCLC 
participants who were evaluable post-surgery after 2 cycles of nivolumab. In NADIM, further to 
60% pCR rate, MPR was also noted in 4 additional patients (18%) . These results compare 
favorably to the MPR rate of approximately 22% observed with hi storical neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy. These results further support the explorati on of MPR a s a secondary objective for 
the CA209816 trial.
5.4.5 Rationale for Patient Population
The OS benefit of several adjuvant therapies in this population  is presented in Table 3.1-1. The 
choice of stage II and res ectable IIIA (N2) NSCLC was made because these participants hav e a 
high risk of tumor relapse and death with current standard ther apy, including surgery with 
preoperative or postoperative chemotherapy. There is an urgent need for improved, novel therapies 
for this group of participants. Participants with stage IB NSCL C with primary tumors of ≥4 cm 
diameter have been included because these participants are also at a high risk of tumor relapse and 
may be considered candidates for standard adjuvant chemotherapy .2,50It is anticipated that 
participants enrolled on this study may require adjuvant chemot herapy with  or without radiation, 
and the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy will commence i f considered clinically indicated 
in the postoperative period.
5.4.6 Rationale for Choices of Platinum-based Chemotherapy Doublet
The regimens selected for use in this study are commonly used a djuvant and neoadjuvant therapies 
in the clinical setting. A significant difference in outcome was not seen between participants using 
the regimens proposed in this trial.51Cisplatin-based therapy has been shown to significantly 
improve survival.52Several clinical trials have found a significant improvement in OS when using 
platinum-based chemotherapy regimens.53,54,55,56,57In revised protocol 03, paclitaxel/carboplatin 
is added among available chemotherapy options based on the prom ising data of using this doublet 
as backbone to combine with nivolumab in neoadjuvant therapy. B esides, meta-analysis of 
individual participant data from neoadjuvant trials did not ide ntify evidence of a difference in 
effect of chemotherapy by whether regimens were cisplatin or ca rboplatin-based (interaction 
p=0.48).58

5.5 Justification for Dose
5.5.1 Rationale for Shorter Infusion Times for Nivolumab
Nivolumab has been administered safely over 60 minutes at doses  ranging up to 10 mg/kg safely 
over long treatment duration. In St udy CA209010 (a phase 2, ran domized, double-blinded, 
dose-ranging study of nivolumab in participants with advanced/m etastatic clear cell RCC), a dose 
association was observed for infusion site reactions and hypers ensitivity reactions (1.7% at 
0.3 mg/kg, 3.7% at 2 mg/kg and 18.5% at 10 mg/kg). All the event s were Grade 1-2 and were 
manageable. An infusion duration of  30 minutes for 3 mg/kg of nivolumab and for a flat dose of 
360 mg (30% of the dose  provided at 10 mg/kg and 45% of dose pr ovided at 10 mg/kg assuming 
an average body weight of 80 kg, resp ectively) is not expected to present any safety concern s 
compared to the prior experience at 10 mg/kg nivolumab dose infu sed over a 60-minute duration.
Of note, CA209153, a phase 3b/4 safety study of nivolumab i n participants with metastatic NSCLC 
who have progressed during or af ter at least 1 pri or systemic regime n, used a 30-minute i nfusion 
in a cohort of participants with no safety issues. 
Overall, infusion reactions including high-grade hypersensitivi ty reactions have been uncommon 
across nivolumab. Overall, a change in safety profile is not an ticipated with 30-minute infusion of 
nivolumab.
5.5.2 Rationale for Nivolumab 360 mg Flat Dose
Nivolumab monotherapy has been extensively studied in NSCLC pat ient population in studies 
CA209003, CA209063, CA209017, and CA209057 with body weight nor malized dosing (mg/kg). 
Nivolumab pharmacokinetics (PK) and exposures of subjects in th ese studies have been 
characterized by population pharmacokinetic (PPK) analysis of data collected from these studies, 
together with PK data from several Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical studies of nivolumab mo notherapy 
in solid tumors. Nivolumab PK was determined to be linear, with dose proportional exposures over 
a dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg. Nivolumab clearance and volume  of distribution was found to 
increase with increasing body weight, but the increase was less  than proportional, indicating that 
a mg/kg dose represents an over-adjustment for the effect of body weight on nivolumab PK.
Flat dosing offers several adva ntages over body weight normaliz ed dosing, including reduced 
potential for dosing errors and shortened dosage preparation ti me. A flat dose of 360 mg every 3 
weeks is expected to produce the equivalent average exposure to  3 mg/kg every 2 weeks at the 
median body weight  of ~80 kg in nivolumab-treated subjects.
A PPK model predicted overall nivolumab exposures across subjec ts with a wide range of body 
weight (35-160 kg) for a 360 mg every 3 weeks flat dose to be similar to that from 3 mg/kg every 
2 weeks. Although the flat dose is expected to lead to higher e xposure in lighter patients, relative 
to the exposure in heavier patients given the relationship betw een nivolumab PK and body weight, 
the predicted median and 95th percentile of exposures from these regimen s are maintained w ell 
below those in 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, which was established as a safe and well-tolerable dose.  
In addition, data from the Japanese Phase 1 study ONO- 4538-01 did not demonstr ate dose-limiting 
toxicity at nivolumab up to 20 mg/kg every 2 weeks in Japanese patients and showed similarity in

PK properties between Global and Japanese population. Therefore, the proposed 360 mg flat dose 
is expected to be safe and tolerable in an Asian population.
Nivolumab 5 or 10 mg every 3 weeks plus platinum-based chemothe rapy was evaluated in 
CA209012 and deemed to be tolerable. In addition, nivolumab 360  mg every 3 weeks plus 
platinum based chemotherapy is further being evaluated on sever al global randomized phase 3 
trials including CA209227 and CA209722.6 STUDY POPULATION

−Grade 3 lymphopenia does not require dose delay. 
−If a participant has a bas eline AST, ALT or total bilirubin that is within normal limits,  delay 
dosing for drug-related Grade ≥2 toxicity. 
−If a participant has baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin with in the Grade 1 toxicity range, 
delay dosing for drug-related Grade ≥3 toxicity. 
Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the 
investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication. I nvestigators should consult local 
labeling for the chemotherapy drugs being administered to any g iven participant for additional 
guidance on dose delays. Participants receiving gemcitabine wit h cisplatin or carboplatin should 
omit the Day 8 gemcitabine dose for any of the following on Day  8 of any cy cle:
•ANC < 1,000/mm3
•Platelets <  75,000/mm3
If any non-hematologic adverse event meeting the dose delay cri teria above is felt to be related to 
only 1 particular agent in the platinum doublet chemotherapy re gimen, then that agent alone may 
be omitted for that cycle while the other agent is given. In or der to maintain synchronized dosing 
of the regimen, the omitted agent should be resumed with the ne xt scheduled cycle once the AE 
has improved and retreatment criteria are met. Please refer to  Section 7.4.1 to determine if dose 
reduction of the resumed agent is required. 
If both drugs in the platinum doublet chemotherapy regimen are d elayed, then the participant 
should be re-evaluated weekly  or more frequently if clinically indicated until re-treatment criteria 
are met (as per Section 8.1.2.2 or Section 8.1.2.3 ).
7.4.2.3 Docetaxel Dose Delay Criteria
Docetaxel administration should be delayed for the following:
•Any Grade ≥2 non-skin, drug-related adverse event, with the following exce ptions:
−Grade 2 drug-related fatigue or l aboratory abnormalities do not require a treatment delay
•Any Grade 3 skin, drug-related adverse event
•Any Grade 3 drug-related laboratory abnormality, with the follo wing exceptions for 
lymphopenia, neutrophil count, AST, ALT, or total bilirubin:
−Grade 3 lymphopenia does not require dose delay
−Should not be given if neutroph il counts are < 1500 cells/mm3
−Shoul d not be given if total bilirubin > upper limit of normal (ULN) , or if AST and/or ALT

Subsequent dose reductions may be required as per  Section 7.4.1 .
Participants receiving docetaxel may receive growth factors (in cluding G-CSF and erythropoietin) 
at the discretion of the investigator.
7.4.3 Treatment of Nivolumab- and Ipilimumab-related Infusion Reactions
Since nivolumab and ipilimumab contain only human immunoglobuli n protein sequences, they are 
unlikely to be immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensitiv ity reactions. However, if such a 
reaction were to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, r igors, headache, rash, pruritus, 
arthralgias, hypotension, hypertension, bronchospasm, or other allergic-like reactions. All Grade 3 
or 4 infusion r eactions should be reported wit hin 24 hours to the study Medica l Monitor and 
reported as an SAE if it meets t he criteria. Infus ion reactions  should be graded according to NCI 
CTCAE (Version 4) guidelines.
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modifie d based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate:For Grade 1 symptoms: (mild reaction; i nfusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated):
•Remain at bedside and monitor participant until recovery from s ymptoms. The following 
prophylactic prem edications are recomme nded for future i nfusions: diphe nhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg  at least 30 minutes before 
additional nivolumab administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms: (moderate reaction required therapy or in fusion interruption but responds 
promptly to symptomatic treatment (eg, antihis tamines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids); prophylactic medications indicated for 
≤24 hours):
•Stop the nivolumab/ipilimumab infusio n, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the 
participant with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/o r 
acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor participant until 
resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid and/or bronchodilator th erapy may also be 
administered as appropriate. If the infusion is inte rrupted, then restart the i nfusion at 50% of 
the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve; if no further  complications ensue after 
30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of the original in fusion rate. Monitor participant 
closely. If symptoms recur, the n no further nivolumab will be administered at that visit.
•For future infusions, the following prophylactic premedications are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equi valent) and/or acetaminophen/para cetamol 325 to  1000 mg 
should be administered at least 30 minutes before nivolumab inf usions. If necessary, 
corticosteroids (up to 25 m g of hydrocortisone or equiv alent) may be used.

For Grade 3 or 4 symptoms: (sev ere reaction, Grade 3: prolonged  [ie, not rapidly responsive to 
symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of symptoms following 
initial improv ement; hospi talization ind icated for other clinical sequelae (eg, renal impairment, 
pulmonary infiltrates). Grade 4: Life-threatening; pressor or v entilatory support indicated):
•Immediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab/ipilimumab. Begin  an IV infusion of normal 
saline and treat the participant as follows: Recommend bronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 to 
1 mg of a 1:1000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1  to 0.25 mg of a 
1:10,000 solution injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV 
with methylprednisolone 100 mg I V (or equivalent), as needed. P articipant should be 
monitored until the Investigator is  comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab 
will be permanently discontinued. Investigators should follow t heir institutional guidelines for 
the treatment of anaphylaxis. Rema in at bedside and monitor par ticipant until recovery of the 
symptoms.
In case of late-occurring hypersen sitivity symptoms (eg, appear ance of a localized or generalized 
pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine or corticosteroids).
7.5 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area a ccording to local regulations. It is 
the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that investiga tional product is only dispensed to 
study participants. The investigational product must be dispens ed only from official study sites by 
authorized personnel according to local regulations.
The product storage manager should ensure that the study treatm ent is stored in accordance with 
the environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity)  as determined by BMS. If 
concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study treat ment arise, the study tr eatment 
should not be dispensed and contact BMS immediately.Study treatment not supplied by BMS will be stored in accordanc e with the package insert.
Investigational product documentation (whether supplied by BMS or not) must be maintained that 
includes all processes required to ensure drug is accurately ad ministered. This includes 
documentation of drug storage, administration a nd, as applicable, storage temperatures, 
reconstitution, and use of required processes (eg, required diluents, administration sets).Handling of chemotherapy should be according to local prescribi ng information.  
Please refer to the current ve rsion of the Investigator Brochur es (IBs) and/or the Pharmacy Manual 
for complete storage, handling, and preparation information. Fu rther guidance and information for 
final disposition of unused study treatment are provided in Appendix 7 and the Pharmacy Manual. 
7.5.1 Retained Samples for Bioavailability / Bioequivalence
At the time of receipt of the investigational product by the in vestigator or designee’s, BMS will 
specify the appropriate number of containers or units to select for retention, the conditions of 
sample storage, required duration of sample retention, and prov isions for returning or disposing of

the investigational product. When samples are selected, contain ers or units should be placed in 
packaging with a tamper evide nt seal provided by B MS. Package l abeling should clearly identify 
the contents as bioavailability/bioequivalence (BA/BE) samples and state that the investigational 
product should be stored in the restricted area with limited ac cess.
7.6 Treatment Compliance
Treatment compliance will be monitored by drug accountability a s well as the participant’s 
medical record and eCRF.
7.7 Concomitant Therapy
7.7.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments
The following medications are prohibited during the study (unle ss utilized to treat a drug related 
adverse event):
•Immunosuppressive agents
•Immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (except as stated in Section 7.7.3 )
•Any concurrent anti-neoplastic therapy (ie, chemotherapy, hormo nal therapy, immunotherapy, 
extensive, non-p alliative rad iation therapy , or standa rd or investigational agents for treatment 
of NSCLC)
•Investigators should refer to the local product labeling for th e chemotherapy drugs selected for 
use in Arm B and Arm C and for additional prohibited and restricted concomitant medications.
•Caution should be used regarding the use of herbal medication, as there may be as yet unknown 
interactions with nivolumab and ipilimumab. Discontinuation of the use of herbal medications 
prior to the study enrollment is encouraged.  
•Live vaccines (eg, yellow fever, MMR, nasal flu vaccine, chicke n pox [varicella]) should be 
avoided while receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant study drug
•Avoid using concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers wi th docetaxel, vinorelbine, 
or paclitaxel. Avoid using concomitant strong CYP2C8 inhibitors  or inducers with paclitaxel.  
Consult the local prescribing information for further guidance.  
•Avoid the concomitant administration of substances that are also  tubularly secreted (eg, 
probenecid) which could potentially result in delayed clearance of pemetrexed.
7.7.2 Other Restrictions and Precautions
Participants with a c ondition requiri ng systemic tr eatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg 
daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medicat ions within 14 days of 
randomization are excluded. Inhaled or topical steroids, and ad renal replacement steroid doses 
> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absenc e of active autoimmune disease.
It is the local imaging facility’s responsibility to determine, based on particip ants attributes 
(eg, allergy history, diabetic history and renal s tatus), the appropr iate imaging mod ality and 
contrast regimen for each participant. Imaging contraindication s and contrast risks should be 
considered in this assessment. Participants with renal insufficiency should be assessed as to 
whether or not t hey shoul d receive contrast and if so, what type and dose of contrast is appropriate.

contrast should not be given to this population. In addition, pa rticipants are excluded from MRI if 
they have tattoos, metallic implants, pacemakers, etc. The ulti mate decision to perform MRI in an 
individual participant in this study rests with the site radiol ogist, the investigator, and the standard 
set by the local Ethics Committee.
7.7.3 Permitted Therapy
Participants are permitted the use of topical, ocular, intra-ar ticular, intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic abs orption). Adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg 
daily prednisone are permitted. A brief (less than 3 weeks) cou rse of corticosteroids for 
prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non- autoimmune conditions 
(eg, delayed-type hypersensitivity r eaction cause d by a contact allergen) is permitted.
7.8 Treatment After the End of the StudyAt the end of the study period, BMS w ill not continue t o provide BMS supplied study treatment 
to participants/investigators unless BMS chooses to extend the study. The investigator should 
ensure that the participant receives appropriate standard of ca re lung cancer treatment.
8 DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA8.1 Discontinuation from Study Treatment
Participants MUST discontinue  investigational product (and non- investigational product at the 
discretion of the investigator) for a ny of the following reasons:
•Participant’s request to stop study tr eatment. Par ticipants who request to discontinue study 
treatment w ill remain in the study and must continue to be followed for pr otocol specified 
follow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when a part icipant specifically withdraws 
consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously authorized by participant to 
provide this i nformation. Participant should notify the investigator of the d ecision to withdraw 
from future follow-up in writing, whenever possible, and this s hould be documented in the 
medical records.
•Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness which, in the opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued participat ion in the study is not in the best 
interest of the participant
•Termination of the study by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS)
•Loss of ability to fr eely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily inca rceration 
for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious disease) illness
Refer to the Schedule of Activities for data to be collected at  the time of neoad juvant treatment 
discontinuation and subsequent study procedures and for any fur ther evaluations that can be 
completed.
In the case of pregnancy, the investigator must immediately not ify the BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee of this event. In the event a normal healthy f emale participant becomes pregnant

during a clinical trial, the study treatment must be discontinu ed immediately. In most cases, the 
study treatment w ill be permanently discontinued in an appropri ate manner (eg, dose tapering if 
necessary for participant safety). Please call the BMS Medical Monitor within 24 hours of 
awareness of the pregnancy. If the investigator d etermines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio 
that warrants continuation of study treatment, a discussion bet ween the investigator and the BMS 
Medical Monitor/designee must occur.
All participants who discontinue study treatment should comply w ith protocol specified 
procedures as outlined in Section 2 . The only exception to this requirement is when a participant 
withdraws consent for all study procedures including post-treatm ent study follow-up or loses the 
ability to consent fr eely (ie, is imprisoned or involuntarily i ncarcerated for the treatment of either 
a psychiatric or physical illness).
If study treatment is disconti nued prior to the participant’s c ompletion of the study, the reason for 
the discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s med ical records and en tered on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) page.8.1.1 Study Treatment Discontinuation Criteria
Doses that are missed or delayed by > 7 days will not be replace d, and participants should proceed 
to surgery within the indicated timelines. Participants who dis continue their assigned study 
treatment pr ematurely will not be allowed to receive subsequent n eoadjuvant therapy, and 
participants should proceed to surgery within the indicated tim elines.
In Arm C, nivolumab and platinum doublet chemotherapy can be di scontinued independently 
based on their discontinuation criteria.  
8.1.1.1 Nivolumab Discontinuation Criteria

•Lost to follow-up is defined by the inability to reach the part icipant after a minimum of three
documented phone calls, faxe s, or emails as well as lack of response by participant to one 
registered mail letter. All attempts should be documented in th e participant’s medical records.
•If it is determined that the participant has died, the site wil l use permissible local methods to 
obtain date and cause of death.
•If investigator’s use of third-party representative to assist i n the follow- up portion of the study 
has been included in the participant’s informed consent, then t he investigator may use a 
Sponsor retained third-party representative to assist site staf f with obtaining participant’s 
contact information or other public vital s tatus d ata necessary to complete the follow-up 
portion of the study. 
•The site staff and representative will consult publicly availab le sources, such as public h ealth 
registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact information.

9 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
•Study procedures and timing are summarized in the Schedule of A ctivities. 
•Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed.
•All immediate safety concerns must be discussed with the Sponso r immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue 
treatment.
•Adherence to the study design requirements, including those spe cified in the Schedule of 
Activities, is essential and required for study conduct.
•All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to con firm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria before randomization . The investigator will maintain a 
screening log to record details of all participants screened an d to confirm eligibility or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.
•Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clini cal management (eg, blood count) 
and obtained before signing of  informed consent may be utilized  for screening or baseline 
purposes provided the procedure meets the protocol-defined criteria and has been performed 
within the timeframe defined in the Schedule of Activities.
Additional measures, including non-study required laboratory te sts, should be performed as 
clinically ind icated or to comply with local regu lations. Laboratory toxicities (eg, suspected drug 
induced liver enzyme evaluat ions) will be monitored during the follow-up phase via on si te/local 
labs until all study drug related toxicities resolve, return to  baseline, or are deemed irreversible.
If a participant shows pulmona ry-related signs (hypoxia, fever)  or symptoms (eg, dyspnea, cough, 
fever) consistent with possible pulmonary adverse events, the participant should be immediately 
evaluated to rule out pulmonary toxicity, according to the susp ected pulmonary toxicity 
management algorithm in the BMS-936558 (nivolumab) Investigator  Brochure.
Some of the assessments referred to in this section may not be captured as data in the eCRF. They 
are intended to be used as safety monitoring by the treating ph ysician. Additional testing or 
assessments may b e performed as clin ically necessary  or where required by institutional or lo cal 
regulations.
9.1 Efficacy Assessments
The primary efficacy assessments w ill be EFS and pCR, and a key secondary endpoint is MPR 
rate (defined as number of randomized participants with ≤ 10% residual tumor in lung and lymph 
nodes as evaluated by BIPR, divided by the number of randomized  participants for each treatment 
group), which w ill be assessed by BIPR at the time of definitive surgery. Surg ery should be

performed within 6 weeks after c ompleting up to 3 cycles (last d ose) of neoadjuvant treatment. 
The following lymph node levels should be sampled at the time of  definitive surgery:
•For right-sided tumor: Levels 4, 7, 9R, 10R and 11 R
•For left-sided tumor: Levels 5 and/or 6; 7, 9L, 10L, and 11L 
Tumor and lymph node collection from definitive surgical resect ion and sampling of fresh tumor 
sample in RNAlater for biomarker studies (as applicable dependent on the size of residual tumor) 
is mandatory on the day of surgery. Processing of the remainder  of the specimens for 
histopathologic analysis should be performed within 72 hours of  the procedure. Sections will be 
used for central pathology review assessing pCR and MPR. Any tumor, tumor bed, or lymph 
node specimens that are reviewed locally must be submitted for central pathology review.
Gross examination on the entire specimen should be performed wh ich includes all tumor, 
associated lymph node tissue, and uninvolved parenchyma. The sp ecimen should be sectioned at 
0.5 cm intervals, and blocks shoul d be submitted for the full c ross section for every other 0.5 cm 
interval. When estimating viable tumors, in situ carcinoma shou ld not be included. For very large 
tumors with no gross evidence of response, a minimum of 1 slide /cm is required for assessment of 
major pathologic res ponse. Sites are st rongly enc ouraged to submit the diagnostic H &E stained 
slides assessed by the local pathologist for central pathology r eview. The final diagnostic 
pathology report must be submitted with the slides and blocks f or review. Tumor sample 
acquisition guidelines and submission process will be outlined in the study Laboratory Manual to 
be provided by the central lab.
Radiographic assessments will be performed with the Schedule Ac tivities in Table 2-2.
Disease recurrence, change in tumor measurements , and tumor res ponse w ill be assessed by the 
BICR using the RECIST 1.1 criteria. 
9.1.1 Imaging Assessment for the Study
Study evaluations will take place i n accordance with the Schedu le of Activities. 
Screening (baseline) assessments are to be performed within 28 days prior to randomization. 
PET/CT with contrast s hould be assessed at baseline. A separate  CT with contrast of the chest, 
abdomen, and other suspected areas (as well as the PET/CT) is required if the CT component of a 
PET/CT is not of sufficient d iagnostic quality for RECIST 1.1 measur ements. Participants with 
suspected brain metastases and all those with stage II disease or higher s hould be evaluated with 
MRI/CT of the brain pre- and post-contrast. Tumor assessments sh ould be performed following 
RECIST 1.1 criteria.  
A preoperative PET/CT with contrast should be acquired within 1 4 days of surgery. A separate 
CT with contrast of the chest, abdomen, and other suspected are as (as well as the PET/CT) is 
required if the CT component of a PET/CT is not sufficient diag nostic quality for RECIST 1.1 
measurements.

Postoperative assessments with CT with contrast of the chest in cluding the adrenal glands and CT 
or MRI of other additional suspected/known sites of disease. Th e first tumor assessment should 
occur 12 weeks ( ±7 days) after definitive surgery per RECIST 1.1 and then s hould occur every 
12 weeks ( ±7 days) for 2 years (104 weeks), then every 6 months (24 weeks ±7 days) for 3 years, 
and then every year (52 weeks ±7 days) for 5 years or until disease recurrence or progression 
confirmed by BICR. The same imaging method should be used as the  screening/baseline. For 
participants who did not receive definitive surgery AND without  tumor progression confirmed by 
BICR, the first tumor assessments should be done 12 weeks ( ±7 days) following the tumor 
restaging, subsequent tumor assessments will be performed with the same frequency and methods 
as described for those having received definitive surgery; in c ase the planned initiation of 
subsequent anti-cancer therapy is within 12 weeks of restaging,  every effort should be made to 
repeat tumor assessment prior to subsequent anti-cancer therapy .
Images will be submitted to the third-party radiology vendor fo r central review as they are 
performed on an ongoing basis. Sites w ill be trained pri or to scanning the first study participant. 
Image acquisition guidelines and submission process will be out lined in the study Imaging Manual 
to be provided by the radiology vendor. Any incidental findings  of potential clinical relevance that 
are not directly associated with the objectives of the protocol  should be evaluated and handled by 
the Study Investigator as per standard medical/clinical judgeme nt. 
9.1.2 Patient-reported Outcomes
The evaluation of health-related qu ality of life (QoL) is an increasingly important aspect of a 
clinical efficacy in oncology trials. Such data provides an und erstanding of the impact of treatment 
from the participants’ perspective and offers insights into the  patient experience that may not be 
captured through physician reporting. Generic health-related Qo L scales additionally provide d ata 
necessary in calculating ut ility values for h ealth economic models. 
Participants will be asked to comp lete the 3-level version of the EQ-5D before any clinical 
activities are performe d during on-treatment clinic visits, at Post-neoadjuvant Visits  1 and 2, and 
at designated visits or during phone calls during the Survival Follow-up Phase. The questionnaire 
will be provided in the participants pre ferred language and may be admi nistered by telephone 
during the Survival Follow-up Phase. A standardized script will  be used to facilitate tel ephone 
administration of the EQ-5D-3L. Table 2-2 , Table 2-3 , and Table 2-4 provide information 
regarding the timing of participant-reported outcomes assessmen ts.
The EQ-5D-3L is a standardized instrument used to measure self- reports of health status and 
functioning. The instrument’s descriptive system consists of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, 
usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each  dimension has 3 levels, reflecting 
"no health problems," "moderate health problems," and "extreme health problems." A dimension 
for which there are no problems is said to be at level 1, wh ile a dimension for which there are 
extreme problems is said to be at level 3. Thus, the vectors 11 111 and 33333 represent the best 
health state and the worst health s tate, resp ectively, described by the EQ-5D-3L. Altogether, the 
instrument describes 35= 243 health states. Empirically derived weights can be applied  t o  a n  
individual’s responses to the EQ-5D-3L descriptive system to ge nerate an index measuring the

value to society of his or her current health. Such preference- weighting systems have been 
developed for Japan, UK, US, Spain, Germany, and numerous other  populations. In addition, the 
EQ-5D-3L includes a visual analog scale that allows respondents  to rate their own current health 
on a 101-point scale ranging from “best imaginable” to “worst i maginable” health. The EQ-5D is 
available for use in over 150 languages.
9.2 Adverse Events
The definitions of an AE or serious adverse event (SAE) can be found in Appendix 8.
AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant's legally authorized repre sentative). 
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detectin g, documenting, and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that 
are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the s tudy, or that caused the participant to 
discontinue before completing the study. 
Contacts for SAE reporting specified in Appendix 8.
Immune-mediated adverse events (IMAEs) are AEs consistent with an immune-mediated 
mechanism or immune-mediated component for which non-inflammato ry etiologies (eg, infection 
or tumor progressi on) have been ruled out. IMAEs can include ev ents with an alternate etiology 
which were exacerbated by the induction of autoimmunity. Inform ation supporting the assessment 
will be collected on the participant’s case report form.
9.2.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
The collection of nonserious AE information s hould begin at initiatio n of study treatment un til 
100 days after the last dose of  neoadjuvant therapy or 90 days a fter surgery, whichever is longer, 
and 30 days after the last dose of adjuvant therapy, at the tim e points specified in the Schedule of 
Activities ( Section 2 ). Nonserious AE information s hould also be collected from the start of a 
placebo lead-in period or other observational period intended t o establish a baseline status for the 
participants.
The Investigator Brochure (IB) represents the Reference Safety I nformation to determine 
expectedness of serious adverse events for expedited reporting.  Following the participant’s written 
consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, must be 
collected, including those thought to be associated with protoc ol-specified procedures.
All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening peri od and 100 days after the last dose 
of neoadjuvant therapy or 90 days after surgery, whichever is l onger, and 30 days after the last 
dose of adjuvant therapy. If applicable, SAEs must be collected  that relate to any later 
protocol-specified procedure (eg, a follow-up skin biopsy).The investigator must report any SAE that occurs after these ti me periods and that is believed to 
be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure.
•Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded on the appropriate section of the eCRF  section.

•All SAEs will be rec orded and reported to Sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as i ndicated 
in Appendix 8. 
•The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponso r within 24 hours of this being 
available.
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in  former study participants. 
However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a dea th, at any time after a participant 
has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the study 
treatment or study participation, t he investigator must promptl y notify the sponsor.
The method of evaluating, and assessing caus ality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for 
completing and reporting/transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 8.
9.2.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported  or elicited  during open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a participant. (In order to preve nt reporting bias, participants should 
not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or m ore AEs.)
9.2.3 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
•Nonserious AEs should be follo wed to resolution  or stabilizatio n, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Appendix 8)
•Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause interr uption or discontinuation of 
study treatment and for those present at the end of study treatment as appropriate
• All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on  the nonserious AE page of 
the CRF (paper or electronic). Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs 
and/or laboratory abnormalities t hat are reported/identified du ring the course of the study
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required t o proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and non-serious AEs of  special interest (as defined in 
Section 9.2 will be followed until resolution, until the c ondition stabilizes, un til the event is 
otherwise explained, or until the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 8.3).
Further informatio n on follow- up procedures is given in Appendi x 8.
9.2.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
•Prompt notification by the investigator to the Sponsor of SAEs is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a 
product under clinical investigation are met.
•An investigator who receives an i nvestigator safety report desc ribing SAEs or other specific 
safety information (eg, summary  or listing of SAEs) from the S ponsor w ill file it along with 
the Investigator’s Brochure and w ill notify the IRB/IEC, if appropri ate acc ording to local 
requirements.

Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320. A SUSAR ( Suspected, Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reaction) is a subset of SAEs and will be report ed to the appropriate regulatory 
authorities and investigators following local and global  guidelines  and requirements.
All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening peri od and 100 days after the last dose
of last dose of neoadjuvant therapy or 90 days after surgery, w hichever is longer, and 30 days after 
the last dose of adjuvant therapy. For participants randomized/assigned to treatment and never 
treated with study drug, SAEs should be collected for 30 days f rom the date of randomization. 
9.2.5 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the study treatment, it is subseque ntly discovered that a participant is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposur e, including during at least 
5 half-lives after product adminis tration, the investigator must  immediately notify the BMS 
Medical Monitor/designee of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form 
to BMS Designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event and i n accordance with SAE reporting 
procedures described in Appendix 8.
In most cases, the study treatment w ill be permanently discontinued in an appropri ate manner 
(eg, dose tapering if necessary for participant safety). Please call the BMS Medical Monitor within 
24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy.
Protocol-required procedures fo r study disconti nuation and foll ow-up must be performed on the 
participant.Follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, in cluding perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be re ported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be reported to 
Sponsor or designee. In order for Sponsor or designee to collect any pregnancy surveillance 
information from the female partne r, the fe male pa rtner must si gn an informed consent form for 
disclosure of this information. Information on this pregnancy w ill be collected on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
9.2.6 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be ca ptured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form electronic, as appropriate. Paper forms  are only intended as a back-up 
option when the electronic system is not functioning.
•Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or me ets the definition of an SAE

9.2.7 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible, t imely confirmation of initial liver-related  laboratory abnormalities s hould 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 9.2 and Appendix 8 for reporting 
details).
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as: 
1) AT (ALT or AST) elevation >  3 times upper limit  of normal (ULN)
AND
2) Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without init ial findings of cholestasis ( elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),
AND
3) No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation  and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limi ted to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing ch ronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
9.2.8 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physica l examinations, electrocardiogram, 
x-ray filming, any other potential safety assessment required o r not required by protocol should 
also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.
Definition of immune-mediated adverse events (IMAEs) 
Immune-mediated AEs are specific events (that include pneumonit is, diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, 
nephritis/renal dys function, rash, and endocrine [adrenal insufficiency, 
hypothyroidism/thyroiditis, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus,  and hypophysitis]) for which 
participants received immunosuppressive medication for treatmen t of the event, with the exception 
of endocrine events (hypothyroidism/thyroiditis, hyperthyroidis m, hypophysitis, diabetes mellitus, 
adrenal insufficiency), which are included regardless of treatm ent since these events are often 
managed without immunosuppression. Immune-mediated AEs are specific events (or groups of PTs descr ibing specific events) that 
include pneumonitis, diarrhea/coli tis, hepatitis, nephritis/ren al dysfunction, rash, endocrine 
(adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism/thyroiditis, hyperthyroi dism, diabetes mellitus, and 
hypophysitis), and other specific events, considered as potenti al immune-mediated events by 
investigator, that meet the definition summarized below:

Immuno-oncology (I-O) agents are associated with AEs that can d iffer in severity and duration 
than AEs caused by other therapeutic classes. Nivolumab and ipi limumab are considered an 
immuno-oncology agent in this protocol. Early recognition and m anagement of AEs associated 
with immuno-oncology agents may mitigate severe toxicity. Manag ement Al gorithms have been 
developed to assist investigators in assessing and managing the  following groups of AEs:
•Gastrointestinal
•Renal
•Pulmonary
•Hepatic
•Endocrinopathy

9.3 Overdose
All occurrences of overdose must be reported as SAEs (see Section 9.2).
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional adminis tration of any dose of a product that 
is considered both excessive and medically important. All occur rences of overdose must be 
reported as an SAE (see Section 9.2).
9.4 Safety
Planned time points for all safety assessments are listed in th e Schedule of Activities.
At screening, a medical history w ill be ob tained to capture r elevant underlying conditions. The 
screening examinations should include weight, height, ECOG Performance Status, blood pressure 
(BP), heart rate (HR), temperature, and oxygen saturation by pu lse oximetry (at rest). Screening 
assessments and screening laboratory assessments should be performed in accordance with Table
2-1.
Pregnancy tests for WOCBP must be performed within 24 hours prior to the initial administration 
of study drug. 
Participants will be evaluated for safety if they have received any study drug. Toxicity assessments 
will be continuous during the tr eatment phase as w ell as during the first 2 safety (neo-adjuvant) 
follow-up visits, for 90 days after surgery, a nd for 30 days after adjuvant therapy. Once participants 
reach the Survival Follow-up Phase, either in-person visits or documented telephone calls/email 
correspondence to assess the participant’s status are acceptable.
Adverse events and laboratory values will be graded according t o the NCI-CTCAE version 4.
The start and stop time of the study therapy infusions and any interruptions or i nfusion r ate 
reductions should be documented. Physical examinations are to be performed as clinically indicat ed. If there are any new or 
worsening clinically significant changes since the last exam, r eport changes on the appropriate 
non-serious or serious adverse event page.On treatment local laboratory a ssessments are to be completed w ithin 3 calendar days prior to 
dosing in accordance with Table 2-2 .
On treatment pregnancy tests should be performed as per the schedule in the Schedule of Activity 
Table.
Additional measures, including non-study required laboratory te sts, should be performed as 
clinically ind icated or to comply with local regu lations. Laboratory toxicities (eg, suspected drug

Follow-up Phases via on site/local labs un til all study drug-related toxicities resolve, return to 
baseline, or are deemed irreversible.
If a participant shows pulmona ry-related signs (hypoxia, fever)  or symptoms (eg, dyspnea, cough, 
fever) consistent with possible pulmonary adverse events, the participant should be immediately 
evaluated to rule out pulmonary toxicity, according to the suspe cted pulmonary toxicity 
management algorithm in the nivolumab Investigator Brochure.
Some of the assessments referred to in this section may not be captured as data in the eCRF. They 
are intended to be used as safety monitoring by the treating phy sician. Additional testing or 
assessments may be performed as clinically necessary  or where required by institutional or lo cal 
regulations.
9.4.1 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
Investigators must document their review of each laboratory saf ety report.
Please refer to the Schedule of Activities in Section 2 for details related to the required laboratory 
assessment. 
9.4.2 Imaging Safety Assessment
Any incidental findings of potential clinical relevance that ar e not directly associated with the 
objectives of the protocol should be evaluated and handled by t he Study Investigator as per 
standard medical/clinical judgment. 
9.5 Pharmacokinetics
Samples for ipilimumab PK assessmen t will be collected from par ticipants in Arm A only. Samples 
for nivolumab PK assessments will be collected from participant s in Arm A and Arm C described 
in Table 9.5-1 .Treatment assignments will be r eleased to the bi oanalytical lab oratory in order to 
minimize unnecessary analysis of samples. All time points are r elative to the start of study drug 
administration. All on-treatment time points are intended to al ign with days on which study drug 
is administered, if dosing occurs on a different day, the PK sampling should be adjusted 
accordingly. Further details o f sample collect ion, processing, and shipment will be provided in the 
laboratory procedures manual. PK samples will be analyzed for n ivolumab and ipilimumab by a 
validated ligand binding assay.

it is known that a dose is going to be delayed, then the predos e sample should be collected just prior to the delayed 
dose. However, if a predose sample is collected, but the dose is subsequently delayed, an additional predose sample 
should not be collected.

Additional research retention are mandatory for all study participants, except where prohibited by 
local laws or regulations, ethics committees, institutional req uirements, or where a waiver is 
provided by BMS or their designee. Where one or more of these e xceptions occurs, participation 
in the additional research  should be encouraged, but w ill not be a condition of overall st udy 
participation. Study participants may opt out of the additional  research. 
This protocol will include residual sample storage for addition al research (AR).
This retention for additional research is intended to expand th e translational R&D capability at 
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and will support as yet undefined research aims that will advance our understanding of disease and opt ions for treatment. It may also be used to support health 
authority requests for analysis, and advancement of pharmacodia gnostic development to better 
target drugs to the right participants. This may also include g enetic/genomic e xploration aimed at 
exploring disease pathways, progression and response to treatment etc.

9.10 Other Assessments
9.10.1 Diagnostic/Pre-surgical Evaluation and Surgical Guidelines:
A participant is considered functionally operable if the follow ing criteria are met: 
•ECOG Performance Status ≤1
•Absence of major associated pathologies that increase the surge ry risk to an unacceptable level
•Pulmonary function capacity (eg, FVC, FEV1, TLC, FRC, and DLco)  capable of tolerating the 
proposed lung resection according to the surgeon
•Absence of locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic diseas e (stage IV) in the pre-treatment 
assessment 
All participants enrolled on this study must be surgical candidates with clinical stage IB ( ≥4 cm), 
II or resectable IIIA (N2) NSCLC. Participants will have underg one radiographic evaluation 
(PET/CT) indicating no evidence of distant disease and no evide nce of unresectable loco-regional 
tumor extension (EBUS, mediastinoscopy , or thoracoscopy) prior to ra ndomization. A ny further 
preoperative testing that is recommended by the surgeon or anes thesiologist will be performed as 
part of standard of care. Surgery for participants enrolled on this protocol w ill be according to 
generally accepted standards of care. Operative approach (VATS vs open) will be determined by 
the surgeon.
Accepted types of resection (with negative margins) will consis t of lobectomy, sleeve lobectomy, 
bi-lobectomy, or pneumonectomy. Resections by segmentectomy  or wedge resecti on will not be 
accepted. If mediastinoscopy was not performed preoperatively, it is expected that, at a minimum, 
mediastinal lymph node systematic sampling and evaluation will have occurred, though complete 
mediastinal lymph node dissection (MLND) is preferred. It is re commended that participants have 
at least 3 mediastinal and hilar lymph node st ations sampled and evaluated during s urgery. 
Systematic sampling is defined as removal of at least 1 represe ntative lymph node at specified 
levels. MLND entails resection of all lymph nodes at those same levels. 
The following sampling or MLND locations are required:
•For right-sided tumor: Levels 4, 7, 9R, 10R and 11 R
•For left-sided tumor: Levels 5 and/or 6; 7, 9L, 10L, and 11L 
If there is clear documentation in  the operative report or in a  separately submitted addendum by 
the surgeon of exploration of the required lymph node areas, th e participant will be considered 
eligible if no lymph nodes are found in those areas.

Participants should have a PET/CT scan with contrast of the bas e of the skull through the upper 
thigh performed within the 14 days prior to planned surgery to a ssess for clinical response. A 
separate CT with contrast of the chest, abdomen, and other suspe cted areas (as well as the PET/CT) 
is required if the CT component of a PET/CT is not of sufficien t diagnostic quality of RECIST 1.1 
measurements. Surgery should be performed within 6 weeks of comp leting up to 3 cycles (last 
dose) of neoadjuvant treatment.
9.10.2 Post-surgical Evaluation:
The first tumor assessment should occur 12 weeks ( ±7 days) after definitive surgery per RECIST 
1.1. Afterwards, radiographic assessment will be performed every 12 weeks ( ±7 days) for 2 years) 
following surgery, every 6 months ( ±7 days) for 3 years, and then every year ( ±7 days) for 5 years 
or until recurrence or progression of disease is documented.
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Sample Size Determination
The original study design (before Revised protocol  01) had two arms, with participants randomized 
in a 1:1 ratio to either neoadjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab or platinum doublet chemotherapy 
arm. Revised protocol 02 added a new, neoadjuvant nivolumab plus platinum doublet 
chemotherapy arm. When the third arm opens and as each site rec eives IRB/EC approval of revised 
protocol 02, the IRT will switch to a 1:1:1 randomization at th e respective site.  Starting from that 
point on, the site will only enroll under revised protocol 02.
Revised protocol 03 withholds rando mization into the arm of neoadjuvant nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab but continues randomizing eligible participants into  either neoadjuvant nivolumab plus 
platinum doublet chemotherapy arm or platinum doublet chemother apy arm in a 1:1 ratio. 
Approximately 350 participants (175 p articipants per arm) will b e randomized between 2 arms 
neoadjuvant nivolumab plus platinum doublet chemotherapy or pla tinum doublet chemotherapy 
from 1:1:1 randomization in revised protocol 02 and 1:1 randomi zation in revised protocol 03. 
Participants already randomized in the original 2-arm part (neo adjuvant nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab vs neoadjuvant chemotherapy) and in the arm of neoad juvant nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab in 3-arm part defined by revised protocol 02 will re main in trial and continue scheduled 
trial procedures. It is expected to have around 70 participants randomized in the original 2-arm 
part and approximately another 75 participants randomized in the  arm of neoadjuvant nivolumab 
plus ipilimumab in the 3-arm part. It is estimated that there w ill be a total  of approximately 
500 participants on the study.Starting from 1:1:1 randomization, approximately 350 participan ts will be randomized to the 
2 arms neoadjuvant nivolumab plus platinum doublet chemotherapy or platinum doublet 
chemotherapy in a 1:1 ratio. The sample size of the study is ca lculated based on the primary 
endpoint of EFS and accounts for the multiple primary endpoints comparisons: pCR (per BIPR) 
and EFS (per BICR) with an initial alpha allocation of 0.01 and  0.04 respectiv ely. Formal analyses 
of pCR and EFS may be conducted at different timepoints. The fa llback method will be used, ie, 
if the pCR comparison between Arm C and Arm B is s tatist ically significant,  then 0.01 alpha 
allocated to pCR w ill be passed to the EFS comparison for Arm C  vs Arm B and the EFS

comparison will be conducted at the alpha = 0.05 level. If the pCR comparison between Arm C 
and Arm B is not statistically significant, then the EFS compar ison for Arm C vs Arm B will be 
conducted at the alpha = 0.04 level. In addition, if EFS is sign ificant, OS will be tested 
hierarchically at the same level as EFS.
10.1.1 Pathologic Complete Response (pCR)
The primary analysis of pCR will be performed after 350 randomize d participants in neoadjuvant 
nivolumab plus platinum doublet chemotherapy and platinum doubl et chemotherapy (from start 
of 1:1:1 randomization) have an opportunity for surgery. 
Assuming an accrual r ate of 10 participants (all comers) a month between Arms B and C  during 
1:1:1 randomization (about 10 mont hs), and 15 participants per month during 1:1 randomization, 
it is anticipated that the 350 participants will be randomized i n approximately 27 months. The pCR 
endpoint is expected to be analyze d after about 30 months from s tart of 1:1:1 randomization.
The sample size of 350 participants is based on the EFS endpoint. With this sample size, assuming 
pCR rate of 10% on Arm B chemotherapy and 30% on Arm C nivolumab  plus chemotherapy, 
respectively, the 350 participants will provide more than 90% powe r to detect an odds ratio of 
3.857 with a 2-sided type I error of 1%.
It is estimated that there will be about 110 subjects randomized  to Arm A neoadjuvant nivolumab 
plus ipilimumab before revised protocol 03 is implemented. Assu ming true pCR rate is 15% on 
this arm, there is 95% probability that the lower bound of 95% exact confidence interval of pCR 
is above 5%.
10.1.2 Event Free Survival (EFS)
For the formal comparison of E FS as assessed by BICR for nivolu mab plus platinum doublet 
chemotherapy (Arm C) vs platinum doublet chemotherapy (Arm B), only participants randomized 
from 1:1:1 randomization in revised protocol 02 and 1:1 randomi zation in revised protocol 03 will 
be counted. 
The power details are provided below using alpha = 0.05 (0.01 alp ha from the pCR endpoint 
fallback to the EFS comparison), considering this protocol amen dment (protamend07) occurs after 
the statistically signi ficant pCR final analysis but before any  analysis of EFS or OS. In addition, 
the accrual reflects 358 particip ants who were actually concurr ently randomized in Arms B and C. 
A total of 185 events ensure that an overall 2-sided 5% signific ance level sequential test procedure 
with 2 interim analyses occ urring after 148 ev ents (80% of events  required for final analysis) and 
167 events (90% of events required for final analysis) in 358 r andomized participa nts will have 
82% power assuming an HR of 0.65 between the 2 arms. Considering  a piecewise exponential 
distribution with control hazard rates of 0.028 before 20 month s, 0.017 between 20 months and 40 
months, 0.014 between 40 and 60 months, and 0.008 after 60 month s, and a dropout rate of 
approximately 20%, it is anticipated t he EFS analyses will take  place at approximately 48, 58, and 
73 months from the start of 1:1:1 randomization. The trigger of the first interim analysis is event 
driven. The second interim analysis will take place when 167 ev ents are observed  
. The final analysis will take pl ace

when approximately 185 events are observed  
. The stopping boundaries  at the interim and final EFS 
analyses will be derived based on the exact number of events us ing Lan-DeMets alpha spending 
function with O’Brien-Fleming boundaries. If the interim analyses of EFS are performed at exactly 
148 and 167 events, the nominal significance level for EFS super iority will be 0.024 and 0.030,
respectively. The nominal significance level for the final look  of EFS after 185 events would then 
be 0.038. 
Table 10.1.3-1 summarizes the key parameters of the sample size justification in the randomized 
participants.
10.1.3 Power Consideration for Overall Survival (OS)
The secondary endpoint OS will be tested hierarchically after EFS with the same overall alpha as 
for the EFS comparison (two-sided 4% if the pCR comparison is n ot significant or 5% if the pCR 
comparison is significant).
For the formal comparison of OS for nivolumab plus platinum dou blet chemotherapy (Arm C) vs 
platinum doublet chemotherapy (Arm B), only participants concur rently randomized from 1:1:1 
randomization in revised protocol 02 and 1:1 rando mization in revised protocol 03 will be 
included. Three interim analyses for OS are planned to occur at th e time of EFS interim and final 
analyses, only if EFS is significant. 
The power details are provided below using alpha = 0.05 (0.01 alp ha from the pCR endpoint 
fallback to the EFS comparison, then hierarchically on the OS c omparison), considering this 
protocol ame ndment (prot amend 07) occurs after the readout of the statistic ally significant pCR 
final analysis but before any analysis of EFS or OS. In addition , they reflect the 358 participants 
that were actually concurrently randomized in Arms B and C:

10.1.4 Analyses Timing Projections
The pCR analysis occurred with a database lock on 16-Sep-2020.
Considering the actual enrollment, it will take:
•Approximately 48 months when 148 events on Arms B and C (after start of 1:1:1
randomizatio n) are observed for the first interim analysis (EFS  IA1, OS IA1). This is about 54
months from first patient first visit (FPFV) of the study. This a nalysis will be triggered by the 
number of EFS events.
•Approximately 58 months when 167 EFS events on Arms B and C (afte r start of 1:1:1
randomization) are observed for th e second interim analysis (EFS IA2, OS IA2). This is 
approximately 64 months from FPFV.  
 
•Approximately 73 months when 185 EFS events on Arms B and C (aft er start of 1:1:1
randomization) are observed for the final EFS analysis (EFS FA, OS IA3). This is about 79
months from FPFV of the study.

Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods
PrimaryThe fallback method will be used for the hypothesis testing of the two primary endpoints pCR and 
EFS. Initially, the type 1 erro r of 0.05 will be allocated as f ollows: 0.01 will be allocated to the 
pCR comparison between Arm C and Arm B, and 0.04 w ill be allocated to the EFS comparison 
between Arm C and Arm B. If the pCR comparison between Arm C an d Arm B is statistically 
significant, then 0.01 alpha will be passed to the EFS comparison for Arm C vs Arm B and the test 
comparison will be conducted at the alpha = 0.05 level.
pCR analysis will be based on all concurrently randomized parti cipants in Arms B and C analysis 
population. pCR rate will be computed in each treatment group along with the exact 95% CI using 
Clopper-Pearson method. For pCR rate comp arison between arms C vs  B, the difference will be 
tested via the Cochran Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test using a 2-side d, 1% alpha level. the odds 
ratios stratified by PD-L1, dis ease stage (IB/II vs IIIA) and g ender (Mantel-Haenszel estimator) 
between Arms C and B will be provided along with the 99% CI. In addition, an estimate of the 
difference in pCR rates and corresponding 99% CI will be calcula ted using CMH methodology 
and adjusted by stratification factors (PD-L1, disease stage (I B/II vs IIIA) and gender). 
pCR rate will also be computed for subjects randomized to Arm A  neoadjuvant nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab along with the exact 95% CI using Clopper-Pearson me thod.
EFS is defined as time from randomization to any of the followi ng events: any documented 
progression of disease precluding surgery, progression or recur rence disease (based on BICR 
assessment per RECIST 1.1) after surgery, or death due to any c ause. Participants who don’t 
undergo surgery for reason other than progression will be consi dered to have an event at RECIST 
1.1 progre ssion (based on BICR) or death. Particip ants who die without a reported 
progression/disease recurrence will be considered to have experienced an event on the date of their 
death. Participants who did not report progression/recurrence of disease or die will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment. Participants  who did not have any on-study tumor 
assessments and did not die will be censored on the date they w ere randomized. Participants who 
started any subsequent anti-cancer therapy outside of the proto col-specified adjuvant therapy 
without a prior reported progression/recurrence will be censore d at the last evaluable tumor 
assessment prior to initiation of the subsequent anti-cancer th erapy.
If the pCR analysis comparing Arms C vs B is statistically sign ificant, a two-sided alpha of 0.05 
will be used for the comparison of EFS in Arms C vs B. If the p CR analysis comparing Arms C 
vs B is not statistically significan t, a two-sided alpha of 0.0 4 will be used for the comparison of 
EFS in Arms C vs B. EFS among the all concurrently randomized p articipants in Arms B and C
analysis population will be tes ted. The distribution of EFS wil l be compared between Arm C vs 
Arm B via a 2-sided, log rank test stratified by the randomizat ion stratification factor (ie, PD-L1, 
disease stage [IB/II vs IIIA ] and gender).The hazard ratio and the corresponding (1-adjusted alpha) 
confidence interval will be estimated for Arm C vs Arm B in a stratified Cox proportional hazards 
model using the randomized arm as a single covariate. The EFS curves for each randomized arm 
will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier (KM ) produc t-limit met hod using a log-log 
transformation. In addition, EFS rates at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years will be estimated using KM estimates on the EFS curve for each randomized arm provided a minimum fol low-up is longer than the time 
point to generate the rate.  Associated 2-sided 95% CIs w ill be calculated using the Greenwood 
formula (using log-log transformation).
Sensitivity a
nalysis on EFS will also be pe rformed, and details will be included in statistical 
analysis plan.
SecondaryAt the time of pCR analysis, MPR r ate will be computed in each t reatment group along with the 
exact 95% CI using Clopper-Pearson method. An estimate of the di fference in MPR rates between 
Arm C and Arm B and corresponding 95% CI will be calculated usi ng CMH methodology and 
adjusted by stratification factors (PD-L1, disease stage (IB/II vs IIIA) and gender).

been observed on Arms B and C, after the start of 1:1:1 randomization, which is proj ected to occur 
approximately 48 and 58 months after start of 1:1:1 randomi zation.  
 
 The formal comparisons of EFS will allow for early st opping for superiority. An 
independent statistician external to BMS will pe rform the analysis. If the study continues beyond 
the second interim analysis, the final analysis will be conduct ed after 185 EFS events have been 
observed on Arms B and C from the start  of 1:1:1 randomization. The stopping boundaries at the 
interim and final analyses will be based on the actual number o f EFS events at the time of the 
analysis using Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with O’Brien- Fleming boundaries.

APPENDIX 4 NIVOLUMAB MANAGEMENT ALGORITHMS
These general guidelines constitu te guidance to the Investigato r and may be supplemented by 
discussions with the Medical Monitor representing the Sponsor. The guidance applies to all 
immuno-oncology agents and regimens.
A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be di ligently evaluated according to 
standard medical practice. N on-inflammatory etiologies s hould be consider ed and appropriately 
treated.Corticosteroids are a primary t herapy for immuno- oncology drug-r elated adverse events. The oral 
equivalent of the recommended IV doses may be considered for am bulatory patients with low-
grade toxicity. The lower bioavailability of oral corticosteroi ds should be taken into account when 
switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.Consultation with a medical or surgical specialis t, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure, is recommended.The frequency and severity of the related adverse events covere d by these algorithms will depend 
on the immuno-oncology agent or regimen being used.

APPENDIX 5 RESPONSE CRITERIA (RECIST 1.1)
1 EVALUATION OF LESIONS
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes w ill be categorized measurable or non-measurable as 
follows:
1.1 Measurable
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dime nsion (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
1) 10 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm )
2) 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which can not be accurately measured 
with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable)
3) 20 mm by chest x-ray
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymp h node 
must be ≥15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thi ckness recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm).
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet th e criterion of a short axis of 
≥15 mm by CT scan. Only the short axis of these nodes will contri bute to the baseline sum. The 
short axis of the node is the diameter normally use d by radiologists to j udge if a node is involved 
by solid tumor. Nodal size is normally reported as two dimensions in the plane in which the image 
is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition  
may be axial, saggital or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For e xample, 
an abdominal node which is reported as being 20 mm x 30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and 
qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm should be recorded as the node 
measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axi s ≥10 mm but < 15 mm) should 
be considered non-target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered 
non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.
1.2 Non-Measurable
All other lesions are considered non-measurable, including smal l lesions (l ongest d iameter 
< 10mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to < 15 mm short axis) as w ell as truly 
non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non-measurable  include: leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory  breast disease, lymphangitic 
involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical 
exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.

2 BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF ‘TARGET’ AND ‘NON-TARGET’ 
LESIONS
When more than one meas urable lesion is present at baseline all  lesions up to a maximum of five 
lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) represen tative of all involved organs should 
be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measur ed at baseline (this means in 
instances where patients have only one or two organ sites invol ved a maximum of two and four 
lesions respectively will be recorded).
Target lesions should be selecte d on the basis of their size (l esions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should b e those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on  occasion, the largest lesion does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstan ce the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short ax is for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis i s added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize  any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes s hould be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Mea surements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progressi on’ 
(more details to follow). In additi on, it is possible to record multiple nontarget lesions involvi ng 
the same organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, ‘multiple en larged pelvic lymph nodes’ 
or ‘multiple liver metastases’).
3 RESPONSE CRITERIA
3.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nod es 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axi s to < 10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesio ns, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesio ns, taking 
as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the basel ine sum if that is the smallest on 
study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum mu st also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more  new lesions is also considered 
progression).Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient i ncrease to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.

3.1.1 Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions
3.1.1.1 Lymph nodesLymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the  actual short axis measurement 
recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline  examination), even if the nodes 
regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph nod es are included as target lesions, 
the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal 
lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 mm. Case r eport forms or other data collection 
methods may therefore be designed to have target nodal lesions recorded in a separate s ection 
where, in order to qualify for CR, each node must achieve a sho rt axis < 10 mm. For PR, SD and 
PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions.
3.1.1.2 Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’
While on study, all lesions (nodal and non-nodal) r ecorded at baseline s hould have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). 
However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as  target lesions at baseline 
become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel co mfortable assigning an exact 
measure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’. Wh en this occurs it is important 
that a value be recorded on the case report form. If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion 
has likely disappeared, the meas urement should be recorded as 0  mm. If the lesion is believed to 
be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned 
(Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable 
size when normal and are freque ntly surrounded by fat such as i n the retroperitoneum; however, 
if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen b ut too small to measure, a default 
value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well). This default value is derived from 
the 5 mm CT slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness). The 
measurement of these lesions i s potentially non-reproducible, t herefore providing this default 
value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon m easurement error. To reiterate, 
however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measur e, that should be recorded, even if it 
is below 5 mm.
3.1.1.3 Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment
When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the  fragmented portions should be 
added together to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, a s lesions coalesce, a plane between 
them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diam eter measurements of each 
individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such tha t they are no longer separable, the 
vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the m aximal longest diameter for the 
‘coalesced lesion’.
3.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to d etermine the tumor response for the 
group of non-target lesions. While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need 
not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitative ly at the time points specified in 
the protocol.

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tu mor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size ( < 10mm short axis). 
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintena nce of tumor 
marker level above t he normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression (see commen ts below) of existing non-ta rget 
lesions. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is al so considered progression).
3.2.1 Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non-Target Disease
The concept of progression of non-target disease requires addit ional explanation as follows:
3.2.1.1 When the patient also has measurable diseaseIn this setti ng, to achieve ‘unequi vocal progression’ on the basis of the no n-target disease, there 
must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target  disease such that, even in presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has inc reased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy (see further details below). A modes t ‘increase’ in the size of one or 
more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for  unequivocal progression status. The 
designation of overall progression solely on th e basis of chang e in non-target disease in the face 
of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.
3.2.1.2 When the patient has only non-measurable disease
This circumstance arises in some trials when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable 
disease. The same general concepts apply here as noted above, h owever, in this instance there is 
no measurable disease assessment to factor into the inte rpretati on of an increase in non- measurable 
disease burden. Because worsening in non-target disease ca nnot be easil y quantified (by definition: 
if all lesions are truly non-measurable) a useful test that can  be applied when assessing patients for 
unequivocal progressi on is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden bas ed on the change 
in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the inc rease that would be required to 
declare PD for measurable disease: ie, an increase in tumor bur den representing an additional 73% 
increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase dia meter in a measura ble lesion). 
Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from ‘trace’  to ‘large’, an increase in 
lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described in protocols as ‘sufficient 
to require a change in therapy’. If ‘unequivocal progression’ i s seen, the patient should be 
considered to have had overall PD at that point. While it would  be ideal t o have objective criteria 
to apply to non-measurable disease, the very nature of that dis ease makes it impossible to do so; 
therefore the increase must be substantial.
3.2.2 New Lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progres sion; therefore, some comments 
on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specifi c criteria for the identification of 
new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequi vocal: ie, not 
attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in im aging modality or findings thought 
to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new ’ bone lesions may be simply 
healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). This is particularly  important when the patient’s baseline

BMS-936558 nivolumab
lesions show partial or complete response. For example, necrosi s of a liver lesion may be reported 
on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not.
A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical locat ion that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progressio n. An example of this is the patient 
who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain ordered which 
reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are consider ed to be evidence of PD even if 
he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow-up 
evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is definitely 
a new lesion, then progression s hould be d eclared using the date  of the initial scan. While FDG-
PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes  reasonable to incorporate the use 
of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly 
possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET im aging can be identified according 
to the following algorithm:
4) Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at foll ow-up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesion.
5) No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: I f the positive FDG-PET at 
follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT,  this is PD. If the positive 
FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up 
CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the 
date of PD will be the d ate of the initial a bnormal FDG-PET scan). If the positive FDG-PET 
at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on C T that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.
3.3 Response Assessment
3.3.1 Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from th e start of the study treatment until 
the end of treatment taking into account any requirement for co nfirmation. The patient’s best 
overall response assignment will depend on the findings of both  target and non-target disease and 
will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions . Furthermore, depending on the 
nature of the study and the protocol requirements, it may also require confirmatory measurement.
3.3.2 Time Point Response
It is assumed that at each protocol specified time point, a res ponse assessment occurs. Table 3.3.2-
1provides a summary of the overall response status calculation a t each time point for patients who 
have measurable disease at baseline. When patients have non-mea surable (therefore non-target) 
disease only, Table 3.3.2-2 is to be used.

aNon-CR/non-PD is preferred over SD for non-target disease since  SD is increasingly used as endpoint for

3.3.3 Best Overall Response 
Best response determinati on of complete or par tial res ponse requires confirmation: Complete or 
partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a subsequent time point of 
≥4 weeks later. In this circumstance, the best overall response can be interpreted as in Table 3.3.3-
1.
Special note on response assessment: When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions 
and the nodes decrease t o ‘normal’ s ize (< 10 mm), they may st ill have a measurement reported 
on scans. This measurement should be recorded even though the n odes are normal in order not to 
overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of  the nodes. As noted earlier, this 
means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the case report form (CRF).

aIf a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen  at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that poi nt (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best 
response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was me t. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed 
when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still p resent and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the 
first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR sh ould be changed to PR and the best response is PR.
bMinimum criteria for SD duration is 6 weeks.
3.3.4 Confirmation Scans
Verification of Response: To be assigned a status of CR or PR, c hanges in tumor measurements 
must be confirmed by consecutive repeat assessments that should  be performed no less than 
28 days after the criteria for response are first met. For this study, the next scheduled tumor 
assessment can meet this requirement.
Verification of Progression: Progression of disease should be ve rified in cases where progression 
is equivocal. If repeat scans confirm PD, then progression should be declared using the date of the 
initial scan. If repeat scans do not confirm PD, then the subje ct is considered to not have 
progressive disease.

DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until beco ming post-menopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hy sterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
•Premenarchal
•Premenopausal female wi th 1 of the following:
−Documented hysterectomy
−Documented bilateral salpingectomy
−Documented bilateral oophorectomy
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of  the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or m edical history interview.
•Postmenopausal female
−A postmenopausal state is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in  a woman over age 
45 years in the absence of other biological or physiological cau ses. In addition, females 
under the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle stimulatin g hormone, (FSH) level 
> 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR FEMALE PARTICIPANTS OF CHILD BEARING  
POTENTIAL
One of the highly effective methods of contraception listed bel ow is required during study duration 
and until the end of relevant systemic exposure, defined as 5 mo nths after the end of study 
treatment.
Local laws and regulations may require use of alternative and/o r additional contraception methods.

•Intrauterine device (IUD)c
•Bilateral tubal occlusion
•Vasectomized partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is 
the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If 
not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
•Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evalua ted in relation to the duration of the study and 
the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
•It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception whe n complete abstinence is 
elected. 
•WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section 2. 
•Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abs tinence 
NOTES: 
aTypical use failure rates may differ from those when used consi stently and correctly. Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive metho ds for participants participating in clinical studies. 
bHormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with t he study drug, which may reduce the efficacy 
of the contraceptive method.  Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient evidence that 
the IMP and other study med ications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contracept ion would be 
ineffective or result in increased exposures that could be potentially hazardous.  In this case, alternative methods of contraception should be utilized. 
cIntrauterine devices and intrauterine hormone releasing systems are acceptable methods of contraception in the 
absence of definitive drug interaction studies when hormone exp osures from intrauterin e devices do not alter 
contraception effectiveness

IRB(s)/IEC(s) and if applicable, also by local health authority  must be sent to BMS.
If an amendment substantially alters the study design or increa ses the potential risk to the 
participant: (1) the consent form must be revised and submitted to the IRB(s)/IEC(s) for review 
and approval/favorable opinion; (2) the revised form must be us ed to obtain consent from subjects 
currently enrolled in the study if they are affected by the ame ndment; and (3) the new form must 
be used to obtain consent from new subjects prior to enrollment .
If the revision is done via an administrative letter, investiga tors must inform their IRB(s)/IEC(s).
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
Investigators and su b-Investigators will provide the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial 
information in accordance with local regulations to allow the Sponsor to submit comp lete and 
accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to th e appropriate h ealth aut horities. 
Investigators are responsible fo r providing information on financial interests during the course  of 
the study and for 1 year after completion of the study.
INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS
Investigators must ensure that subjects are clearly and fully i nformed about the purpose, potential 
risks, and other critical issues regardi ng clinical studies in which they volunteer to participate. 
In situations where consent cannot be given to subjects, their legally acceptable representatives (as 
per country guidelines) are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, potential risks, and other 
critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the partici pant volunteers to participate. 
Sponsor or designee will provide t he investigator with an appro priate (i.e., Global or Local) sample
informed consent form which will include all elements required by ICH, GCP and app licable
regulatory requirements. The sample informed consent form will adhere to the ethical principles 
that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Investigators must:
•Provide a copy of the consent form and written information abou t the study in the language in 
which the participant is most proficient prior to clinical study participation. The language must 
be non-technical and easily understood. 
•Allow time necessary for participant or participant's legally a cceptable representative to 
inquire about the details of the study.
•Obtain an informed consent signed and personally dated by the p articipant or the participant's 
legally acceptable representative and by the person who conduct ed the informed consent 
discussion. 
•Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opinion of the written informed consent form 
and any other information to be provided to the subjects, prior  to the beginning of the study, 
and after any revisions are completed for new information.
If informed consent is initially given by a participant’s legal ly acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the participant subsequently becomes capable of m aking and communicating his or 
her informed consent during the study, consent must additionall y be obtained from the participant.
Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is 
relevant to the participant's consent. The investigator, or a p erson designated by the investigator, 
should fully inform the participant or the participant's legall y acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information relevant to the 
participant's willingness to continue participation in the stud y. This commun ication should be 
documented. 
The confidenti ality of records that could identify subjects must be protected , respecting the privacy 
and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements , the subjects' signed ICF and, in the 
US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorization.The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and reg ulatory authorities have direct 
access to participant records. 
Subjects unable to give their written consent (e.g., stroke or subjects with or severe dementia) may 
only be enrolled in the study with the consent of a legally acc eptable representative. The participant 
must also be informed about the nature of the study to the exte nt compatible with his or her 
understanding, and should this participant become capable, he or she should personally sign and 
date the consent form as soon as possible. The explicit wish of  a participant who is unable to give 
his or her written consent, but who is capable of forming an op inion and assessing information to 
refuse participation in, or to be withdrawn from, the clinical study at any time should be considered 
by the investigator.
The rights, safety, and well-being of the study subjects are th e most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.

established system that meets these requirements.
CASE REPORT FORMS
An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate an d accurate case histories designed 
to record all observations and other d ata pertinent to the investig ation on each individual treated 
or entered as a control in the investigation. Data that are derived from source documents and 
reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source document s or the discrepancies must be 
explained. Additional clinical information may be collected and  analyzed in an effort to enhance 
understanding of product safety. CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities 
that are reported or identified during the course of the study.
For sites using the Sponsor or designee electronic data capture tool, electronic CRFs w ill be 
prepared for all data collection fields except for fields speci fic to SAEs and pregnancy, which will 
be reported on the electronic SAE form and Pregnancy Surveillan ce form, respectively.  If 
electronic SAE form is not av ailable, a paper SAE form can be used. Spaces may be left blank  
only in those circumstances permitted by study-specific CRF com pletion guidelin es provi ded by 
Sponsor or designee. 
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects mus t be protected, respecting the privacy 
and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable reg ulatory requirement(s).
The investigator will maintain a signature sheet to document si gnatures and initials of all persons 
authorized to make entries and/or corrections on CRFs. The completed CRF, SAE/pregnancy CRFs, must be promptly reviewe d, signed, and dated by the 
investigator or qualified physician who is a subinvestigator an d who is delegated this task on the 
Delegation of Authority Form. Subinvestigators in Japan may not  be delegated the CRF approval

APPENDIX 8 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS: 
DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING, 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW UP AND REPORTING ADVERSE 
EVENTS
Adverse Event Definition:
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical oc currence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation parti cipant administered study treatment
and that does not necessarily hav e a causal relati onship with t his treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (suc h as an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the us e of study treatment, whether or 
not considered related to the study treatment.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
•Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematol ogy, clinical chem istry, or urinalysis) or 
results from other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological sc a n s ,  v i t a l  s i g n s  
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, consi dered clinically significant 
in the medical and scie ntific judgment of the investigator. Note  that abnormal lab tests or 
other safety assessments should only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not 
available. Once the final diagnosis is known, the reported term  should be updated to be the 
diagnosis.
•Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing conditio n including either an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
•New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention a dministration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-d rug interaction.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a s uspected overdo se of either study intervention 
or a concomitant medication. Overdose, as a verbatim term (as r eported by the investigator), 
shoul d not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional  overdose taken with possible 
suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae and 
should specify "intentional overdose" as the verbatim term
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
•Medical or surgical proce dure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): th e condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
•Situations in which an untoward medical occ urrence did not occur (so cial and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
DEFINITION OF SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot b e an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met.

SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the participa nt was at risk of  death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypotheticall y might have caused death if it were 
more severe)
Requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of ex isting hospitalization (see NOTE 
below)
NOTE: 
The following hospitalizations are not  considered SAEs in BMS clinical studies: 
•a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-th reatening event)
•elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
•admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
•routine health assess ment requiring admission for baseline/tren ding of health status (e.g., 
routine colonoscopy)
•medical/surgical admission other  than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases
•admission encountered for another life circumstance that carrie s no bearing on health status 
and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of ho using, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason)
•admission for administr ation of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs (applies 
to oncology protocols)
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) th at may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based up on appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the participant or may requi re intervention [e.g., medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed i n the definition above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treat ment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or co nvulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization.) Potential drug indu ced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 9.2.7 for the definition of potential DILI.) 
Pregnancy and potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) must fo llow the same transmission timing 
and processes to BMS as used for SAEs (see section 9.2.5 for reporting pregnancies).

Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to  study therapy should be reported 
as SAE (e.g., death is an endpoint, if death occurred due to an aphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be 
reported).
EVALUATING AES AND SAES
Assessment of Causality
•The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship betwee n study intervention and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.
•A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relat ionship cannot be ruled out.
•The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the re lationship.
•Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration 
will be considered and investigated.
•The investigator will also consult the Investigat or’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
•For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical n otes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality .
•There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the in vestigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to Sponsor. Howeve r, it is very important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causality for every e vent before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to Sponsor.
•The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in lig ht of follow-up information 
and send a SAE follow-up report with the updated causality asse ssment.
•The causality assessment is one  of the criteria used when deter mining regulatory reporting 
requirements.
Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
If only limited information is i nitially available, follow- up reports are required. (Note: Follow-
up SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initi ally reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to s tudy treatment or if new 
information becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours 
to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmit ting the initial SAE report.
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.

REPORTING OF SAES TO SPONSOR OR DESIGNEE
•SAEs, whether related or not r elated to study treatment, and pregnancies must be reported 
to BMS (or designee) immediately within 24 hours of awareness of the event.
•SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report Form.
−The required method for SAE data reporting is through the eCRF.

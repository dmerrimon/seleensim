Name of Investigational Product: 
QR-010 Solution for Nebulization  
Name of Active Ingredient: QR-010 
Title of Study:  Phase 1b, Randomized , Double -blind, Placebo -controlled, Dose Escalation 
Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of QR -010 
in Subjects With Homozygous ΔF508 Cystic Fibrosis  
Investigators:  To be determined  
Study Centers:  Approximately 27 centers in North America  and European Union ( EU) 
Phase of Development:  1b 
Study Period:   24 months   
Duration of Subject Participation:  9 days (single ascending dose cohorts)  
8 weeks (multiple ascending dose cohorts)  
Objectives:  Primary : To evaluate the safety and tolerability of QR -010 administered  via 
inhalation  and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  
Secondary : To evaluate  the change from baseline  analysis for laboratory 
parameters and vital signs  as well as the  pharmacokinetic s (PK) of QR -010 
administered  via inhalation.  
Exploratory : To explore  the efficacy of QR -010 administered  via inhalation . 
Study Design:  Randomi zed, double -blind  (investig ator and subject) , placebo -controlled, 
single ascending and multiple ascending dose-escalation study . This study  
includes  two portions : four single ascending dose (SAD) cohorts  (1-4) and 
four multiple ascending dose (MAD)  cohorts  (5-8). 
An independent  Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC ) will be  
designated  to review all  safety data at the end of  each cohort. Safety data 
will in clude 7 days of follow up after the dose administered for SAD cohort 
subjects , and 7 days after the last dose  administered for MAD cohort 
subjects . Initiation of the first MAD dose cohort will be based on the 
determination of the  DSMC  that an adequate safety profile has been 
demonstrated in the first two SAD cohorts. Similarly, subsequent MAD 
dosing cohorts will be initiated based on the determination of the DSMC  
that an adequate  safety profile is demonstrated in the corresponding 
supportive SAD  and MAD  cohorts. Lastly, the DSMC  will review safety 
data on an ad hoc bas is. The type of adverse event ( AE) that would trigger 
such an ad hoc DSMC  review would be documented in the data safety 
monitoring plan.

Number of Subjects  (planned):  Approximately 32 subjects  in each of the SAD and MAD portions will be 
enrolled in the study , with 8 subjects per cohort, randomized at a 3:1 ratio  
(6 active and 2 placebo) , for a total of 64 subjects in  the study. The exact 
number of subjects  enrolled is dependent on whether any dose levels are to 
be expanded due to the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities ( DLTs ).

 Sputum microbiology at baseline  and end of study  for SAD cohorts, 
and at  the End of Treatment Visit  for MAD cohorts  
Statistical Methods:  Baseline safety and exploratory endpoints will be summarized descriptive ly 
for SAD and MAD separately. No inferential testing will be performed. 
Serum  concentrations of QR -010 will be summarised by dose level and time 
point. Individual concentration -time graphs will be presented. Graphs of 
mean concentration over time, for each dose, will also be presented. 
Summary statistics for AUC, C max, Tmax, t1/2, and dose-normalized AUC and 
Cmax will be presented by dose level. Graphs of AUC and Cmax versus dose 
will be displayed. Dose proportionality may be explored using analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) on log -transformed and dose normalized C max and AUC 
parameters , if there are sufficient data to support the analysis . Additionally, 
the power approach could be used to investigate for dose proportionality. 
Any p values that will be calculated according to the analysis plan will be 
interpreted in view of the exploratory nat ure of the study.

Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  2.0 INTRODUCTION  
ProQR Therapeutics (ProQR, the Sponsor) is developing an antisense oligonucleotide ( AON ) 
product, QR -010, for the chronic treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) that is associated 
with either a compound hetero - or homozygous genotype for the absence of phenylalanine at 
position 508 (ΔF508 /p.Phe508del) on cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator 
(CFTR) -encoded ribonucleic acid (RNA). QR -010 is a single -stranded RNA oligonucleotide that 
is complementary to the ∆F508 region on the RNA transcription product of the CFTR gene. 
Translation of the repaired CFTR encoded RNA should result in a wild-type (WT) or normal 
CFTR protein. The intended route of clinical administration is oral inhalation (inhalation) of 
nebulized QR -010 solution.  
Cystic Fibrosis Associated with ΔF508 CFTR Genotype  
Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that i s caused by a mutation in a gene that 
encodes CFTR, a membrane protein with pleiotropic functions. CFTR regulates the surface 
liquid layer and is found in the epithelial cells of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and biliary 
systems; male reproductive tra ct; and exocrine sweat glands. This protein consists of 1480 amino 
acids that are divided into five domains, two of which cross the membrane to form a 
bidirectional, trans -membrane chloride channel ( Riordan et al., 1989 ). Although CFTR functions 
primarily as a chloride channel, it has many other regulatory roles that affect the CF phenotype. 
These include inhibition of sodium transport through the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), 
regulation of the outwardly rectifying chloride channel, regulation of adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP ) channels, regulation of intracellular vesicle transport, acidification of intracellular 
organ elles, and inhibition of endogenous calcium -activated chloride channels. The CFTR protein 
is also involved in bicarbonate –chloride exchange. A deficiency in bicarbonate secretion leads to 
poor solubility and aggregation of luminal mucins. Lack of CFTR func tion results in the multi -
organ system clinical syndromes described in patients with CF (Collawn et al. , 2012; Mehta , 
2005; O’Sullivan  & Freedman, 2009; Quinton , 1999; Reisin et al. , 1994; Vankeerberghen et al. , 
2002 ).  
The CFTR gene is encoded on chromosome  7 (Chr 7 117,120,017 through to 117,308,715). The 
transcription product of the CFTR gene (189 kb) is a messenger RNA (mRNA) ( 6.1 kb) that is 
translated into the CFTR protein. A patient with  a CF phenotype has a CFTR gene mutation on 
both alleles and may b e homozygous for a single mutation or compound heterozygous with a 
different mutation on each allele. There are nearly 2000 CFTR gene variants. However, only 159 
variants have an allele frequency ≥ 0.01% and 127 of those 159 variants meet both the clinical  
(pilocarpine iontophoresis sweat chloride test) and functional (affects RNA quality/quantity or 
CFTR protein) criteria to cause CF. Together, these 159 variants account for 96.4% of identified 
cystic fibrosis alleles. The ΔF508 mutation is the most common  allelic mutation and accounts for 
about 66 -70% of identified mutated alleles in northern European and North American 
populations. According to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation National Patient Registry Annual Data 
Report (2012), a total of 23,053  CF patients (86.7 % of the CF population in the US) in the US

2013 ). 
The various CFTR mutations are often classified into 5 specific functional classes, as shown in 
Figure  1. The ΔF508 mutation (hetero - or homozygous ) is a Class II CFTR functional mutation 
that is characterized by defective CFTR processing; the gene is transcribed but the translated 
protein product is not trafficked through the endoplasmic reticulum and is degraded  before 
reaching the cell surface. The ΔF508 mutation results in a CFTR protein that is mis -folded, 
which results in ubiquination and degradation. As a result, little, if any, CFTR reaches the 
plasma membrane. QR -010 has the potential to treat all CF patie nts with the  ΔF508 mutation on 
at least one allele ( O’Sullivan  & Freedman, 2009; Pasyk & Foskett, 1995 ; Zamecnik et al. ,  
2004 ).

The most common cause of death in patients with CF is respir atory failure due to progressive 
loss of lung function and/or pulmonary disease ( Davies et al., 2007 ). There are sever al 
hypotheses regarding the mechanism by which the ΔF508 mutation leads to the multi -organ 
system CF phenotype and progressive loss of function, however the causal relationship between 
CFTR dysfunction and the CF phenotype is well established (Sosnay , 2013 ). In the simplest 
pathophysiological scenario, functional CFTR is either absent or substantially reduced at the 
apical membrane; the absence of functional CFTR at the apical membrane of c iliated airway 
epithelial cells of the respiratory tract results in a reduced capacity to secrete chloride ions to the 
airway surface and, indirectly, in an increased absorption of sodium ions from airway surfaces  
(Collawn et al. , 2012; O’Sullivan  & Freed man, 20 09). This imbalance of active ion transport 
favors the net removal of salt and concomitant water from  airway surfaces. Loss of water in the 
gel-like periciliary layer results in a loss of lubrication of the airway surface and increased 
concentration s of mu cin in the mucus layer. Dehydrated periciliary layer ( PCL) leads to thicker 
mucus and cilia collapse, which results in a reduced mucociliary clearance. The ‘stuck’ mucus

obstruct the airway lumen, produce airflow obstruction, and serve as a nidus for persistent 
bacterial infections. It is the same loss of CFTR -mediated ion regulat ion that leads to dysfunction 
in other organ systems, including the gastrointestinal ( eg, malabsorption), biliary, pancreatic and 
sweat exocrine, reproductive (congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens in males)  systems . 
QR-010 Product Description  
QR-010 is under development for the chronic treatment of patients with CF that is associated 
with either a compound hetero - or homozygous genotype for the absence of ΔF508 on CFTR -
encoded RNA. The goal of treatment with QR -010 is repair of the CFTR region o f the RNA 
encoded with the ΔF508 mutation. Translation of the repaired CFTR encoded RNA should result 
in a WT or normal CFTR protein. The intended route of clinical administration is inhalation of 
nebulized QR -010 solution, which is anticipated to result i n both local effects to the respiratory 
system and systemic absorption. Hence, QR -010 has the potential to treat both pulmonary and 
extra -pulmonary manifestations of CF.  
QR-010 was developed from a synthetic RNA oligonucleotide duplex that was described in  a 
2004 paper by Dr. Paul Zamecnik, a pio neer of antisense therapeutics (Stephenson & Zamecnik, 
1978, Zamecnik & Stephenson, 1978,  Zamecnik et al. , 1986 , Zamecnik et al. , 2004 ). That 
duplex, CF4 -CF6, was composed of a 33 -mer ol igonucleotide with 2’O -Me modifications  and a 
complementary 11 -mer oligonucleotide with phosphates at the 3’ and 5’ end. The Sponsor 
in-licensed the technology that was developed by Dr. Zamecnik from Massachusetts General  
Hospital in 2012. The Sponsor’s pr oduct development program explored various chemical 
modifications to the original molecule to optimize function (ability to restore CFTR activity to 
WT) in vitro and cellular uptake in vivo. The molecule selected for further development, 
QR-010, is a singl e-stranded, 33 -mer RNA  oligonucleotide with 2’O -Me base modifications and 
a full phosphorothioate (PS) backbone. QR -010 is highly specific for the CFTR RNA, with 14 
and 16 complementary base -pairs on either side of the ΔF508 deletion region , as confirmed 
using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) at the National Center for Biotechnology 
Information ( search most -recently conducted 21 August 2014)1.  
As described above, QR-010 is a single -stranded 33 -mer RNA oligonucleotide with 2’O -Me 
base modifications and a full PS backbone. QR -010 is highly specific for the CFTR RNA, with 
14 complementary base pairs  (bps) on the 5’ side and 16 complementary bps on the 3’ side  of the 
ΔF508 deletion region. To address the question of whether or not QR -010 was specific to this 
region of the CFTR RNA, a basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) at the National Center 
for Biotechnology Information was conducted and showe d 100 % specificity for this region. 
Repeated BLAST searches were completed, with the most recent  conducted 21 August 2014.

Sequence with grey shading (C -U-U) on ΔF508 RNA  represents the absence of phenylalanine at position 508 
(ΔF508 mutation). Because both A -U-C (wild -type) and A -U-U (ΔF508 ) code for isoleucine, position 507's 
amino acid is  unchanged, and the net effect of the 3 nucleotides missing in the ΔF508  mutation  is omission of a 
phenylalanine ("F") at position 508  in the translated protein . Vertical bars represent the QR-010 binding region. 
Bold text (G -A-A) on QR-010 represents the complement of the missing C -U-U sequence.

2.1.2.2  Placebo  
Placebo, QR -010 Placebo Solution for Nebulization, is a solution of 0.9% sodiu m chloride. It is 
similar to QR -010 Solution for Nebulization except the active ingredient, QR -010, is excluded. 
The placebo is labeled with the appropriate information as specified in the clinical protocol and 
as necessitated by l ocal regulatory requireme nts. 
2.1.3 Nonclinical  
The nonclinical pharmacology program investigated QR -010 using both in vitro (human cell line 
and primary cells) and in vivo (mice, Cynomolgus monkeys) systems. The nonclinical 
pharmacodynamics data demonstrat ed the inhalation of QR -010 in  mice and supported the 
proposed mechanism of action of treatment with QR -010 in facilitating the phenotypic reversion 
of ∆F508 CFTR activity to WT CFTR activity. These studies are summarized in QR-010 
Investigator’s Brochure , Section 5. 2 - Nonclinical Pha rmacology .  
Three preliminary studies contributed bio -distribution data for QR -010. These analyses were 
conducted in mouse variant C57BL/6J  (considered wild -type [WT] for the purposes of these 
studies).  One additional 28 -day, repeat -dose GLP -compliant toxicity study in Cynomolgus 
monkeys provided toxicokinetic (TK) data . These studies are summarized in QR-010 
Investigator’s Brochure , Section 5.3 - Pharmacokinetics and Product Metabolism in Animals .  
The nonclinical toxicology program for QR -010 was cond ucted in accordance with the following 
guidelines:  
 ICH M3 (R2): Guidance on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human 
Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  
 ICH S4 Guidance: Duration of Chronic Toxicity Testing in Animals  (Rodent and Non 
Rodent Toxicity Testing)  
 ICH S3A Guidance : The Assessment of Systemic Exposure in Toxicity Studies   
A total of seven toxicity studies in mice and Cynomolgus monkeys contributed relevant data for 
the determination of safety and maximum reco mmended starting dose. These studies are 
summarized in QR-010 Investigator’s Brochure , Section 5. 4 – Toxicology .  
2.1.4 Clinical Experience  
No clinical studies have been conducted with QR -010 Solution for Nebulization.

Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  2.2 Study Rationale  
A patient with a CF phenoty pe has a CFTR gene mutation on both alleles and may be 
homozygous for a single mutation or compound heterozygous with a different mutation on each 
allele. There are nearly 2000 CFTR gene variants. However, only 159 variants have an allele 
frequency ≥ 0.01%  and 127 of those 159 variants meet both the clinical (sweat chloride test) and 
functional (affects RNA quality/quantity or CFTR protein) criteria to cause CF. Together, these 
159 variants account for 96.4% of identified cystic fibrosis alleles. The ΔF508 mutation is the 
most common allelic mutation and accounts for about 66 -70% of identified mutated alleles in 
northern European and North American populations. According to the Cystic Fibrosis 
Foundation National Patient Registry Annual Data Report (2012), a  total of 23,053  CF patients 
(86.7% of the CF population in the US) in the US had one or two copies of the ΔF508 mutation  
(O’Sullivan  & Freedman, 2009; Sosnay , et al., 2013 ). 
The ΔF508 mutation (hetero - or homozygous) is a Class II CFTR functional mutation that is  
characterized by defective CFTR processing; the gene is transcribed but the translated protein 
product is not trafficked through the endoplasmic reticulum and is degraded before reaching the 
cell surface. The ΔF508 mutation results in a CFTR protein that is mis -folded, which results in 
ubiquination and degradation. As a result, little, if any, CFTR reaches the plasma membrane. The 
absence of functional CFTR at the apical membrane of ciliated airway epithelial cells of the 
respiratory tract results in loss of CFTR -mediated ion regulation, which ultimately results in 
airway inflammation, obstruction, and persistant bacterial infections ( Collawn et al. , 2012; 
O’Sullivan  & Freedman, 2009 ). It is the same loss of CFTR -mediated ion regulation that leads to 
dysfunction in other organ systems, including the gastrointestinal ( eg, malabsorption), biliary, 
pancreat ic and sweat exocrine, reproductive (congenital bilateral absence of the vas de ferens in 
males) systems.  
Although many organ systems are affected in CF, the most common cause of death is respiratory 
failure due to progressive loss of lung function and/or pulmonary disease ( Davies et al., 2007 ). 
Hence, patients with CF would greatly benefit from a therapy targeted to the respiratory system 
that facilitated the phenotypic reversion of ∆F508 CFTR activity to WT or normal CFTR 
activity. Worldwide, there is no marketed therapy that facilitates repair of the CFTR protein  by 
targeting the RNA transcription product of the CFTR ge ne.  
QR-010 is a single -stranded RNA oligonucleotide that is complementary to the CFTR region on 
the RNA transcription product of the CFTR gene. Hence, QR -010 has the potential to treat all CF 
patients with the ΔF50 8 mutation on at least one allele. The QR-010 nonclinical program 
demonstrated that QR -010 facilitat ed the phenotypic reversion of ∆F508 CFTR activity to WT 
CFTR activity  both in mice that were homozygous for the ∆F508  mutation and in cystic fibrosis 
human cell cultures with the ∆F508  mutation.  The QR -010 nonclinical program also 
demonstrated the inhalation safety and toxicology of QR -010 in WT mice and WT Cynomolgus 
monkeys. The clinical development program will investigate the long -term safety and efficacy of 
QR-010 in treating in adult and pe diatric patients who exhibit CF phenotypes with varying 
degrees of disease severity.

Protocol No. PQ -010-001 (Version 8.0)  
 
ProQR Therapeutics   Page 26 of 103 
Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  The initial clinical study, PQ -010-001, will be a single - and multiple -ascending dose (SAD and 
MAD, respectively) study that will evaluate safety, tolerability, and the ma ximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) of QR -010 Solution for Nebulization  in CF patients who are homozygous for the ΔF508 
mutation. Exploratory efficacy endpoints are proposed but the study will not be sufficie ntly 
powered to test efficacy. Subjects will have baselin e lung function defined as FEV 1 ≥ 70% 
predicted for safety re asons. The Phase 1b study will be conducted in  North America  and select 
European countries.  
2.2.1 Dose Selection Rationale  
Dose selection was based on the human equivalence dose (HED) and maximum recom mended 
starting  dose (MRSD) that were derived from 28 -day toxicology studies in mouse and 
Cyanomolgus monkey studies , and further details can be found in the Investigator Brochure .  
The doses in the intended dose escalation scheme ( 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 m g) in Study 
PQ-010-001 correspond to the fill dose (mg loaded into the nebulizer)  for the nebulizer. The 
maximum fill volume of the eFlow, the device that will be used to deliver study medication, is 
4 mL. In Study PQ-010-001, the fill volume will be 4 mL for all doses in the dose escalation 
scheme. The doses will be adjusted by diluting the 50 mg/mL solution. The actual  delivered dose 
of QR -010 Solution for Nebulization using the eFlow with a 4 mL fill is < 80% of the fill  dose. 
Hence, the maximum amount of drug delivered to patients will be approximately 5, 10, 20, and 
40 mg under the dose escalation scheme.  
The maximum loaded (50  mg) and estimated maximum delivered dose s (40 mg) roughly 
correspond to one -half of the  MRSD  of 104 mg. In addition, the MRSD incorporated a safety 
factor of greater than 5 times the pulmonary deposited dose (PDD) (based on data from  the 
28-day toxicity study that was conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys ), and it is expected that there 
will be a lower  bioavailability of QR -010 in the lungs of CF patients. In  consideration of all the 
points above , the proposed dose escalation scheme for PQ-010-001 is considered highly 
conservative.  
3.0 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of QR -010 
administered by inhalation  to subjects  with homozygous ∆F508 cystic fibrosis, and  to identify 
the maximum tolerated dose (MTD ) of QR -010.  
3.2 Secondary Objective(s)  
The s econdary objectives of the study are : 
 To evaluate the change from baseline  analysis for laboratory and vital signs  
 To evaluate the pharmacokinetics  (PK) of QR-010 administered by inhalation .

ProQR Therapeutics   Page 27 of 103 
Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  3.3 Exploratory Objective(s)  
An additional  objective of the study is to explore  the clinical  efficacy of QR -010 administered  
via inhalation  by FEV 1, Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire -Revised ( CFQ -R) Respiratory Symptom 
Score  (RSS) , change in body weight, and iontophoretic pilocarpine sweat chloride.  
4.0 STUDY OVERVIEW  
4.1 Criteria for Evaluation  
4.1.1 Primary Endpoint  
 Incidence and severity of adverse events  (AEs)  from baseline  through end of study  
 Occurrence of dose -limiting toxicities (DLT) in each dose cohort from baseline  through 
end of study   
4.1.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)  
Safety:  Changes from baseline  to end  of treatment or presence of abnormalities  on frequent 
monitoring in laboratory parameters (chemistry , hematology , sputum microbiology , and 
urinalysis) , vital signs , ECG,  spirometry,  and physical examinations . A chest radiograph will be 
obtai ned at screening  and at end of treatment  (MAD cohorts) .  
Pharmacokinetics : The PK of QR-010 will be examined in all stages of the study , from first dose 
through end of study . Specifically, subjects will provide blood , urine  and expectorated sputum 
samples for PK assessment s.  
4.1.3 Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  
Exploratory efficacy endpoints of clinical activity will include FEV 1, the patient reported 
outcome measure CFQ -R Respiratory Symptom Score (CFQ -R RSS ), body weight, and 
pilocarpine iontophoresis sweat ch loride at the end of study compared to baseline , for MAD 
cohorts . 
The study will not be sufficient ly power ed to determine  efficacy of QR -010 in the treatment of 
CF. However, changes in clinical outcome measures that are associated with CF will be 
monitored  over the course of the study in all MAD cohorts . Observed changes in these 
well-established measures of CF health may  inform design of future studies , and  include FEV 1, 
body weight, change in CFQ -R RSS, and pilocarpine iontophoresis sweat chloride. Data 
indicating potential immunogenicity of QR -010 and change from baseline  in inflammatory 
biomarkers will also be captured.  
4.2 Study Design  
The study  is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, and placebo -controlled Phase 1b SAD and 
MAD design . The subject, inve stigator , and site personnel (except pharmacist) will be blinded to 
treatment, while the sponsor will be unblinded.  Sponsor personnel will be unblinded to subject

Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  treatments in order to permit real -time i nterpretation of the safety, pharmacokinetic , and 
pharmacodynamic  data. The site  monitor will remain blinded to individual subject treatment 
allocation until all monitoring of study data has been completed . To minimize the potential for 
bias, individual subject treatment randomization information will not be released to the 
investigator or blinded study  site personnel until the study database has been locked.   
Eligible subjects with homozygous ∆F508 CF will be randomized at a 3:1 ratio to receive either 
QR-010 or  placebo vial o ral inhalation (nebulization). This study will be conducted in North 
America  and select European countries.  
The study includes  2 stages. The first stage  is a single  ascending  dose-escalation (SAD) design  to 
determine safety and tolerability  of a single dose of QR -010. The second stage is a multiple  
ascending dose escalation  (MAD)  design to further assess the safety, tolerability , and exploratory 
efficacy of 12 doses of QR -010 over 4 weeks . All doses will be administered in a clinical setting .  
For the SAD  cohorts , subjects  will receive the dose in an inpatient  observation unit and be 
observed for a total  4 days, and will be discharged  on Day 4 . Subjects  will return for PK and 
safety  follow -up as an outpatient on Day 8 (End of Study Visit) .  
For the MAD cohorts , subjects  will receive doses 1 through 12 in a clinic while under  
observation . On Day 1 and Day 3 subjects will be observed until 12 hours post dose . Following 
the last dose ( dose 12), s ubjects will return twice  for PK sampling, and wil l be evaluated  7 and 
28 days after the last visit for this additional safety monitoring and sampling for PK.  
A schematic of the study design is presented in Figure  3.

Single Ascending Dose Escalation Cohorts:  The first two subjects of each cohort may be dosed 
on the same day, at least 4 hours apart. If no significant AEs occur, the remainder of the cohort 
may be dosed at least 24 hours later, with at least 1 hour between subjects.   
After eac h single dose cohort , an independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will 
review available safety data, including 7 days of follow up after administration of QR -010. Dose 
escalation may occur  upon recommendation of the DSMC .

ProQR Therapeutics   Page 29 of 103 
Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  Multiple Ascending Dose Escalation  Cohorts : The safety  results from the single dose 
escalation portion of the study will support the initiation of the corresponding multiple dose 
escalation  cohorts, as illustrated in Figure  3.  
After each multiple dose cohort, the DSMC will review available safety data, including 7 days of 
follow up after administration of the last dose of QR -010 (End of Treatment Visit) . Dose 
escalation may occur  upon recommendation of the DSMC .  
Both Stages : Subjects  must sign informed consent before any study -related procedures are 
initiated. Subjects  will receive QR-010 by inhalation  via the eFlow device.  
Blood , urine and sputum  samples will be obtained from  all subjects  to obtain PK data pre - and 
post-dosing . 
Subjects  will undergo clinical and laboratory assessment s for safety. Subjects  will be withdrawn  
from the study when  intolerable toxicity occurs , or when the subject  withdr aws consent .  
The schedule of assessments is summarized in Appendix  1 and 2. 
AE profiles by cohort and dose escalation decisions by the DSMC are communicated to all study 
sites after DSMC review of cumulative and cohort -specific safety data.  
4.3 Dose Escalation   
The single dose escalation scheme will test fill doses of 6.25 mg to 50 mg over 4 dose levels , and 
the multiple dose escalation scheme will test fill doses of 6.25 mg to 50 mg given thrice weekly  
(tiw) for 4 weeks  (Table  1). As described in Section 2.2.1 , the dose delivered to  subjects  via the 
eFlow  device  is < 80% of the fill dose, hence  the delivered dose s that correspond to the dose 
escalation schemes are  shown in Table  1.

Dose escalation will initially proceed in single  subject  cohorts from fill dose level 1 ( 6.25 mg) to 
fill dose level 4  (50 mg). 
Initiation of MAD  Cohort 5 will be based on the safety profile of SAD  Cohort 2. Initiat ion of 
Cohort 6 will be based on the safety profiles of Cohorts 3 and 5. Similarly, initiati on of Cohort 7 
will be based on the safety profiles of Cohorts 4 and 6, and finally,  the initiat ion of Cohort 8 will 
be based on the safety profile of Cohort 7.  The first dose between subjects  in each cohort must be 
separated by a minimum of 4 hours.  
For the single dose cohorts 1 to 4 , dose escalation  to the next cohort  may occur  upon 
recommendation of the DSMC  after the subjects  have  been observed for at least 7  days and no 
DLTs have occurred  or, if a DLT has occurred, per the dose escalation rules in Section  4.5. For 
the multiple dose cohorts 5 to 8, dose escalation to the next cohort may occur  upon  
recommendation of the DSMC  after the subjects have been observed for at least  7 days after the 
last do se (End of Treatment Visit).  If a DLT occurs  in any cohort,  the AEs and DLTs will be  
reviewed by the Investigator and the DSMC  before dosing can continue in that cohort . In 
addition, if ≥ 2 subjects  experience a decrease in absolute FEV 1 of ≥ 15% from baseline  in any 
cohort, the data will be reviewed by the DSMC before dose escalation  can continue.  
The AEs of Interest listed in Table  2 are AEs commonl y seen with inhaled products. If AEs of 
interest occur at a G rade 2 level or higher in a single subject  in a cohort , then an additional 4 
subjects  will be added to the cohort . Any of the Grade ≥ 2 toxicities shown in Table  2, as well as

Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  any other respiratory AEs reported,  will be evaluated and considered when making dose 
escalation decisions . If no additional subjects  experience any Grade ≥ 2 AEs of I nterest , dose 
escalation may proceed (if recommended by the DSMC ).  
The Investigator will base decisions to de -escalate  to a lower dose, hold  the dose (delay or skip) , 
or discontinue study drug  for an individual subject  using the CTCAE (modified for CF) toxicity 
grades , in consultation and agreement with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor . In addition to the 
CTCAE (modified for CF) toxicity grades, the Investigator should also review the stopping rules 
in Section  5.5.3  with regard to decreases in FEV 1. 
For the multiple dose cohorts, subject s who  experience  a DLT  (defined in Section  4.4) should be 
discontinued from study drug (whether or not the event resolves) , and t he End of Treatment Visit 
procedures should be conducted . An End of Study Visit should also be conducted  28 days after 
the last study drug dose.

4.4 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
A Dose -limiting Toxicity (DLT) is defined as follows:  
 Allergic reaction requiring medical intervention  
 Acute bronchospasm requiring medical intervention  
 Other acute AEs of interest  requiring immediate medical intervention  
Allergic reactions and acute bronchospasm not requiring intervention  (Grade 1)  are usually 
considered subject -specific and are not included in the definition of DLT. In this protocol ,

ProQR Therapeutics   Page 32 of 103 
Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  allergic reactions and acute bronchospasm not requiring medi cal intervention are not  included in 
the DLT definition since such reactions may not be product and dose -specific with QR-010. 
4.5 Determination of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)  
The MTD  is defined as one dose level below the dose level at which 2 subjects  receiving 
QR-010 experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT)  for dose cohorts 1 -4 or within the first 4 
week s for dose cohorts 5 -8. Dose escalation will occur based on the number of DLTs 
encountered according to the rules in Table 3 , as assessed by the DSMC . Dose escalation will 
continue until the MTD is reached or the maximum dose include d in the study , whichever is 
lower.  With the highest planned fill dose  of 50 mg , subject exposure will be approximately <  40 
mg (< 80% efficiency of the eFlow including residual volume) . For the MTD determination, the 
fill dose will be used .

continue pending review of safety by the DSMC.  
If  2 subjects  experience similar SA E or Grade ≥ 2 AE  of the same organ 
class, dose escalation is to be stopped, pending review by the DSMC. T he

Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  5.0 SELECTION OF STUDY POPULATION   
5.1 Study Population  
Subjects with a diagnosis of CF , homozygous for the ΔF508 CFTR mutation  who meet all 
inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible for participation in this study.  
5.2 Selection of Subjects  
Screening of subj ects will be performed within 14 days  prior to dosing . Medical history, physical 
examination and vital signs will be recorded. Subjects will undergo electrocardiogram ( ECG ), 
chest Xray ( CXR ), spirometry, and clinical laboratory safety testing. During the study subjects 
will be permitted to continue on their chronic medications that are considered standard of care 
for CF.  For subjects  using inhaled anti -infective agents, preferably the same therapy and dose 
should be administered throughout the study period  (Refer to Section  6.3.1 ). Subjects  with signs 
of a pulmonary exacerbation or other acute illness will not be included.  
The exact number of subjects  needed to complete the study depends on the number of cohorts 
required to reach the MTD and the number enrolled in each  dose-escalation cohort. The number 
of subjects  for each of the single dose and multiple dose escalation  cohort s is 8 subjects , for a 
total of  64 subjects , but could theoretically expand to approximately 96 subjects  if there are 
DLTs that require every d ose cohort to be expanded. S ubjects  will be enrolled at approximately 
20 study sites in North America  and select European countrie s.

monitoring purposes.  
Subjects who have completed a SAD cohort are eligible to participate in a MAD cohort, 
provided there is at least 90 days between the dose in the SAD cohort and the first dose in the 
MAD cohort.  
Allergic reactions  may include local dermatitis, angioedema, throat constriction, or anaphylaxis.  
Appropriate treatment may include administration of antihistamines, hydrocortisone, or 
epinephrine at the discretion of the assessing physician.  Subjects diagnosed with a systemic 
allergic reaction requiring therapy will be withdrawn from the study.  
Given the proposed mechanism of action of QR -010, it could be anticipated that subjects  could 
experience a change in baseline  cough, change in sputum quality, or change in sputum volume. 
A pulmonary exacerbation should be considered if these symptoms are accompanied by fever, 
body weight loss, generalized malaise. If a pulmonary exacerbation is diagnosed, appropriate 
interventions including  appropriate  additional antibiotics should be prescribed by the Investigator  
or treating physician. Subjects diagnosed with a pulmonary exacerbation requiring the addition 
of antibiotics will be withdrawn from the study.  
5.5.2 Criteria for Study Drug Disconti nuatio n 
Subjects  should be continued on study treatment unless  an intolerable AE is experienced, or until 
an SAE  and/or Grade ≥ 2 AE in the same system organ class  is experienced by two or more 
subjects  in the same cohort.  Study treatment  for that dose cohort  should be  stopped and subjects  
advised regarding available treatment options.  
When study treatment is discontinued  in the MAD cohorts  due to an intolerable AE, the 
Investigator  should obtain all procedures specified for the End of Treatment Visit , followed by 
an End of Study  Visit, conducted 28 days after the last study drug dose.    
5.5.3 Stopping Rules  
5.5.3.1  Stopping Rules for Study  
The DSMC  will evaluate the safety data after each dose cohort and thereafter on an ongoing 
basis to recommend if the study should continu e or cease, or if any modifications should be 
made as to how subjects  are treated or managed.  
5.5.3.2  Stopping Rules for Individual Subjects  
For individual subjects  in the SAD cohorts , any of the criteria below  will result in 
discontinuation of study drug  administ ration in the SAD portion  of the study, as well as 
exclusion  from participation in the MAD portion . These subjects will continue to be followed for 
safety through the End of Study visit.

ProQR Therapeutics   Page 40 of 103 
Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  Study drug will be administered in the clinic by qualified site personnel via the designated study 
nebulizer, until all study drug solution has been administere d. Complete administration of study 
drug/placebo, if uninterrupted, should take approximately less than 20 minutes  (a minimal 
amount of study drug solution will  remain in the nebulizer medication chamber —this is normal ). 
6.3 Concomitant Medications and Ancillary Therapy  
6.3.1 Permitted Concomitant Medications  
All concurrent CF therapies should be continued for the duration of the study. Prior to study drug 
dosing on a give n day, the following order of concurrent treatment should be adhered to: Long - 
and/or Short acting bronchodilator, mucolytic  therapy ( eg, Pulmozyme),  chest physiotherapy 
(airway clearance technique), inhaled cortic osteroid, inhaled antibiotics.  
Subjects w ho are prescribed chronic, intermittent inhaled antibiotics should participate in the 
study when they are most stable and continue the inhaled antibiotic throughout the study. For 
most patients, this would mean that the subject initiates the inhaled antibi otic during the 
screening period and continues taking it as prescribed through the end of study, including some 
additional days or weeks. As the regimens of chronic inhaled antibiotics varies significantly from 
patients to patient, the Investigator is enco uraged to discuss with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor 
the appropriate regi men for the course of the study . 
Ancillary therapy regimens and airway clearance techniques should remain consistent throughout 
the study period. Other ancillary therapy may be admini stered at the d iscretion of the 
Investigator. Subjects  should receive full supportive care, including antibiotics, antiemetics, 
bronchodilators , etc., as ap propriate. The reason(s) for ancillary therapy, including dosage and 
date(s) of treatment, will be r ecorded in the source documents.  
6.3.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Oral corticosteroid medications may not be used prophyl actically with the first dose. Chronic 
administration of oral corticosteroids at a stable dosage for at least 30 days prior to enroll ment 
are permitted. The reason(s) for ancillary therapy, including dosage and date(s) of treatment, will 
be rec orded in the source documents. Use of ivacafto r (Kalydeco ™) or lumacaftor  are prohibited 
within 45 days of Day 1,  through the End of Study visit.  Use of any investigational drug (other 
than QR -010) or device are  prohibited within 30 days of Day 1, through the End of Study visit. If 
the subject received therapy with ivacaftor or lumacaftor within 90 days prior to Day 1, the start 
and stop dates will  be recorded in the source documents and CRF.  
6.3.3 Adequate Forms of Birth Control  
Women of child bearing potential  must agree to use a highly effective method of birth  control 
from the list below (defined as those, alone or in combination, tha t result in a low  failure rate, ie, 
less than 1% per year  when used consistently and correctly ). Double barrier methods (a 
combination of condom with cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide) are not considered

Protocol No. PQ -010-001 (Version 8.0)  
 
ProQR Therapeutics   Page 41 of 103 
Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  highly effective. Childbearing potential is defined as being fertile following menarche and until 
becoming post -menopausal , unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy . 
Highly effective methods of birth control include:  
 Combined  (estrogen and progesterone containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal)  
 Progesterone -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, 
injectable, implantable)  
 Intrau terine device (IUD)  
 Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
 Bilateral tubal occlusion  
 Vasectomized partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner and has received 
medical assessment of the surgical success)  
 Sexual abstinence. Sexual abstinen ce must be true abstinence which is the preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence ( eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
post-ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of the trial, and 
withdrawal are not acce ptable methods of contraception.  
Birth control measures must be employed  during the time of participation  (beginning at the 
Screening Visit)  in this trial. Protections against pregnancy must be continued for  at least  3 
months after the last dose of study  drug. 
A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently ster ile by bilateral orchidectomy. 
Male subjects with CF with medical confirmation of azospermia and/or infertility will be 
considered permanently sterile. A man who is fertile should use a condom during treatment and 
until 90 day s after the last dose of study drug . 
6.4 Adverse Reaction Management  
AEs in the study will be treat ed with appropriate therapies. Acute b ronchospasm (defined as a ≥ 
15 % decrease in FEV 1 % predicted) should be treated with treatment cessation and with β2 
agonists, IV hydrocortisone (100 mg), o r other agents as appropriate. Additional supportive care 
should be provided as necessary by qualified staff with emerg ency resuscitation equipment.  
A Grade 4 (as defined by Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE  
Version 4.0 3] Modified for CF ) adverse  reaction requires permanent discontinuation of study 
drug.  
If Grade 2 -3 toxicity is noted during the dose administration , the administration  should be halted 
and the subject  assessed. If the adverse  reaction symptoms resolve promptly, then study drug

study drug will result in study drug discontinuation.  
7.0 EVALUATIONS BY VISIT   
All tests and procedures are detailed in Appendix  1, Schedule  of Assessments. All laborator y 
tests are detailed in  Appendix 2 , Sched ule of Laboratory Assessments. Refer to these appendices 
for the required assessments for each study day.  Throughout the protocol, the term “ baseline ” is 
used to refer to tests or procedures performed at screening, Day -1, or on Day 1 prior to dosing.  
7.1 Visit and Assessment Windows  
The flexibility regarding scheduling of study days and correspond ing procedures differ 
depending on the cohort and phase of the study. The timing of assessments, procedures and 
sample collections outlined in t he protocol are nominal times. It is understood that in the phase 1 
setting, actual times will approximate rathe r than match the nominal times exac tly. Actual times 
are to be recorded in the source documentation  and in the case report forms (CRFs) , and, if any 
time point s are missed, the reasons are also recorded.  
For the SAD cohorts, there is no flexibility regardi ng the timing of the scheduled study days in 
relation to dose Day 1.  
For the MAD cohorts, there is some flexibility regarding the timing of the scheduled study d ays 
in relation to dose Day 1. The description of procedures assumes a Monday -Wed nesday -Friday  
dosing schedule. An alternative dosing schedule can be used, provided that there is at a minimum 
2 days  between doses, and a maximum of 4 days between doses.  Missed doses  are to be recorded 
as such, and the overall treatment period should remain at 4 week s, and  not be extended to  
accommodate the missed doses. Missed doses  are to be recorded in the CRF.  
Details regarding acceptable windows for timing of study procedures for both the SAD and 
MAD cohorts can be found in the Laboratory Manual.  
7.2 Screening  Visit  (All Cohorts)  
A screening log of all consented subjects  will be kept at each site. Subject  screening should be 
conducted ≤  14 days prior to study drug dosing ( Day 1). Screening evaluations may be 
completed over several days, if necessary.   
If the first ad ministration of study drug does not occur within the initial 14 days of screening, the 
screening period may be extended up to an additional 14 days and subjects may be reassessed for 
eligibility with an interim medical history, focused physical examination , and repeat of 
laboratory studies (standard laboratory assessments).  
At the discretion of the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor, the screening period for an individual 
subject may be exte nded for an additional 7 days. In this case, the subject may be reassessed f or

exception of sweat chloride, 12 -lead ECG, chest Xray and CFTR genot yping.   
If the screening period extends beyond 28 days  (or up to 35 days with concurrenc e of the 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor) , the potential subject will be considered a screening failure, but may 
be re -screened at a later date.

8.0 STUDY PROCEDURES  
Safety parameters will be assessed by monitoring AEs, vital signs, oximetry, laboratory data 
(chemistries, hematology and urinalysis), ECGs, pulmonary function  (spirometry) , and physical 
examinations. AEs and SAEs  including laboratory tests (chemistries, hematology , and uri nalysis ) 
and ECGs  will be graded  according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events Modified for CF  (CTCAE v4.03).  
8.1 Adverse Events  
Information regarding occurrence of AEs will be captured throughout the study. Du ration (start 
and stop dates ), severity/grade, outcome, treatment and relation ship to study drug will be 
recorded. Refer to Section 12.0, Assessment of Safety or Adverse Events and Serious Adverse  
Events.  
8.2 Vital Signs  
Blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, and temperature will be measured at rest in a sitting  
position.  During the first 24 hours post first dose  (SAD cohorts) or 12 hours post first dose 
(MAD cohorts) , vital signs will be monitored via Holter and automated vital signs monitoring.  
8.3 Telemetry  
On dosing Day 1, conti nuous cardiac and vital sig ns monitoring will be conducted.  Recorded 
measurements ( eg, via Holter monitoring) are acceptable (if observed monitoring is not 
avail able).  
8.4 Oximetry  
Digital oximetry will be measured at rest in a sitting position. 
8.5 Laboratory Evaluations  
Laboratory evaluations will be performed according to the study schedule. For screening 
purposes, should the screening period require longer than 14 day s (eg, CFTR genotype testing 
required longer than 14 days), safety evaluations (serum chemistries, hematologies, urinalysis, 
physical exam, vital signs, spirometry) must be re -obtained for confirmation of eligibility and 
enrollment into the study.  
Serum ch emistries will include sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarb onate, blood urea nitrogen 
(BUN) , creatinine, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, SGPT/ALT , SGOT/AST, GGT, alkaline 
phosphatase, bilirubin  (total and direct) , uric acid, lact ic dehydrogenas e (LDH) , albumi n,

Cockcroft -Gault equation adjusted for actual body weight.  At screening, tocopherol (Vitamin  E) 
levels will also be measured.  
Hematologies will include a complete blood count: Complete blood count (CBC) with absolute 
differential (hematocrit, hemoglobin, white blood count, segmented neutrophils, bands, 
lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, platelet count) .  
A Direct Ant iglobulin Test (DAT) will also be performed at screening and 7 days after last dose.  
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate  (ESR) and C -reactive protein (CRP) will be measured at baseline , 
24 hours  post dose , and End of Study Visit  for SAD cohorts, and at baseline , prior to doses 4 , 7 
and 10, and at the End of Treatment Visit  for MAD cohorts.  Two baseline  measurements will be 
made; one on Day -1, and the other prior to dosing on Day 1.  
Urinalysis  (by visual inspection and dipstick)  will include color and appearance , specific gravity, 
pH, protein, glucose, occult blood, ketones, bilirubin, leukocyte esterase, nitrite, and 
urobilinogen. In addition, microscopic analyses will be performed on sample s with abnormal 
dipstick results . Urine microalbumin will be measured at  baseline  for SAD and MAD cohorts; 
end of study  for SAD cohorts; and prior to dose 10  and end of study  for MAD cohorts.  Time of 
void will be recorded for each urine sample collected.  At screening, testing for drugs of abuse 
will also be performed, specifically for amphetamines, methamphetamines, 
methylenedioixymethamphetamine, co caine, cannabinoids, phencyclidine, opiates , methadone, 
barbiturates, benzodiapines, ethyl alcohol.  Urine or blood testing for drugs of abuse is permitted.  
Coagulation testi ng (INR, PT, PTT, fibrinogen ) and total complement (CH50)  will be performed 
at screening and the End of Study  Visit  for the SAD cohorts, and at screening , prior to dose 4,  
and at End of Treatment Visit for the MAD cohorts.  Any abnormalities of coagulation will be 
followed with additional testing as determined by the Investigator  and/or Medical Monitor to 
diagnose the coagulopathy.  
For female subjects , a pregnancy test  (preferably serum, but urine tests are also accepted)  will 
also be obtained as designated  by the study schedule . 
Sputum for microbiology will be obtained as designated by the study schedule  (for organism 
identification only).  
8.6 Pharmacokinetic  Evaluations  
Samples for PK analysis will be collected as detailed in Appendix  1 and Appendix 2 . 
Expectorated sputum samples for PK assessment can be difficult to obtain at the specified time 
points. It is sugges ted that  samples be collected in conjunction with spirometry, as often 
spirometry maneuvers can provoke coughing  and sputum expectoration . Subjects should rinse 
their mouths with water or saline prior to collection of expectorated sputum samples.

Urine PK samples will be obtained over the following time intervals (in hours post do se 
administration completion):  Pooled samples collected from 0 to 4 hours, 4  to 12 hours, and 12  to 
24 hours post dose  (SAD cohorts  only), and at additional time point s on subsequent study days 
(see Appendices 1  and 2 for specific timing of sample collection) . Subjects should empty their 
bladders just prior to dosing  and at the end of each  time interval for the final urine collection of 
that interval . Urinalysis will be performed on each pooled sample prior to storage for PK 
analysis.  Time and volume will be recorded for each void or urine collection interval at the 
designated time  points . 
8.7 Chest Xray  
A chest radiograph should be obtained at screening  for the SAD cohorts , and at end of study  for 
subjects  exhibiting pulmonary AEs. A chest radiograph or CT scan obtained  within 90 days of 
Screening Visit is acceptable if there was no occurrence of intercurrent pulmonary illness during 
the interim.   
A chest radiograph should be obtained at both screening and 7 days after last dose (end of 
treatment ) for the MAD coho rts. A centralized reading of all chest radiographs may be 
performed at the end of the study.  
8.8 Biomarkers  
Immune response monitoring will be performed  per Appendices 1  and 2. Biomarkers  of interest 
will be measured  in both blood and sputum , and may include cytokines and proteases . The 
immune  profile seen may prompt further exploratory immune response biomarker analysis.  
Blood (serum and plasma) and expectorated sputum  samples will be collected per the study 
schedule, and stored for later quantification . 
8.9 Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) 
12-lead ECG will be obtained at screening and end of study  for the SAD cohorts, and at 
screening and 7 days post last dose fo r the MAD cohorts. 12-lead continuous telemetry will be

8.13 Sweat Chloride  
Documentation of pilocarpine iontophoresis  sweat chloride of > 60 mmol/L is require d for 
eligibility for all subjects . As sweat chloride is a measure of exploratory efficacy in the MAD 
cohorts, s weat chloride will be measured by pilocarpine iontopheresis at screening  for all 
subjects , at the dose 12 Visit , and at the End of Treatment and End of Study follow -up visits for 
the MAD cohorts only. Determination of sweat chloride must be performed in an accredited 
laboratory using a method accepted by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and documented 
accordingly.  
The sweat chloride sample collectio n at the dose 12  Visit can be performed pre - or post -dose.  
8.14 CFQ -R 
The CFQ -R subject  health -related quality of life questionnaire will be administered using the 
self-administered format  (Adult version)  [Appendix  3], according to the study schedule for MAD 
cohorts only.  The CFQ -R will be administered prior to any other test or procedure on each of the 
required study days.  
8.15 CFTR Genotyping and Sequencing  
Confirmation of CFTR gene mutations ho mozygous for the ΔF508 mutation are required for all 
subjects for eligibility. Genetic testing performed prior to the year 2000 must be re -confirmed, 
and a blood sample  for CFTR genotyping should  obtained at the Screening Visit.  Genotyping 
results must be received and confirmed as homozygous for the ΔF508 mutation prior to

12.1 Data Safety Mon itoring  Committee  
An independent  DSMC  from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Development Network 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board  will provide s afety oversight for the study. All DSMC 
members have significant  experience with oversight of cystic  fibrosis clinical trials. A DSMC 
operational charter will be finalized prior to randomization of the first subject . The DSMC will 
review unblinded safety data from each cohort, and provide their recommendation for 
proceeding to the next dosing cohort, as described in Section  4.2.   
12.2 Definitions of Adverse Event  
12.2.1  Adverse Event  
An AE is any  untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related. AEs can include any  unfavorable, noxious, unintended sign, 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of an investigational  medicinal product or 
other protocol -imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. AEs may be spontaneously

Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  reported by the subject , discover ed by Investigator questioning, or detected through physical 
examination, laboratory test, or other means.  
AEs include:  
 Pre-existing me dical conditions judged by the I nvestigator to have worsened in severity 
or frequency or changed in character during the protocol -specified AE reporting period  
 AEs not previously observed in the subject  that emerge during the protocol -specified AE 
reporting period  (as specified in Section  12.4.1)  
 Complications that occur as a result of protocol -mandated interventions ( eg, invasive 
procedures such as blood draw s) 
 AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment that are re lated to a 
protocol-mandated intervention ( eg, invasive procedures such as blood draw s, medication 
washout, or no treatment run -in) 
12.3 Assessment of Adverse Events   
The I nvestigator is responsible for assessing the severity and causality of AEs. 
12.3.1  Assessment of  the Severity (Intensity) of Adverse Events  
Maximum intensity is to be graded using the NCI CTCAE (V 4.0) Modified for CF ( National 
Cancer Institute , 2011 ). If grading table  does not have grading criteria for the event,  the criteria 
in Table  4 will be used.  
Table  4: Adverse Event Intensity (Severity) Scale  
Grade  Severity  Alternative Description of the Adverse Eventa 
1 Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
2 Moderate  Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; discomfort sufficient to 
reduce or in terfere with daily activities.  
3 Severe  Medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitalization may be indicated; disabling; limits self -care with 
significant interference with daily activities; incapacitating with inability to perform 
self care activities of daily living.  
4 Life-threatening  Urgent intervention indicate d; immediate risk of death.  
5 Death   
Note: Regardless of severity, some events may also meet regulatory serious criteria. Refer to definitions of an SAE.  
a. Use these alternative definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 events when the observed or reported AE is not in the 
NCI CTCAE  Modified for CF  listing.

Protocol No. PQ -010-001 (Version 8.0)  
 
ProQR Therapeutics   Page 62 of 103 
Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  Any AE that meets the seriousness criteria (see Section  12.5, Serious  Adverse Event Definitio n) 
will be considered a n SAE , including all life -threatening AEs . In addition, AEs with Grade  4 
intensity may be considered serious if the event is determined to be clinically significant.  
12.3.2  Assessment of the Rela tionship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The Investigator will make a causality assessment about the relationship of each AE to study 
drug.  Treatment -related conditions must be distinguished from disease -related conditions. To 
ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, I nvestigators should apply the 
following general guideline:  
Not Related:  The AE has an etiology  other than the study drug ( eg, preexisting medical 
condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness , or concomitant medication); a nd/or the AE has 
no plausible temporal relationship to admini stration of the study drug ( eg, cancer diagnosed 2 
days af ter first dose of study drug).  
Related:  There is a plausible (possible, probable, or definite) temporal relationship between the 
onset o f the AE and administration of the investigational product, and the AE cannot be readily 
explained by the subject ’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapies; and/or the 
AE follows a known pattern of response to the investigational pro duct; and/or the AE abates or 
resolves upon discontinuation of the investigational product or dose reduction and, if applicable, 
reappears upon rechallenge.  
Note:  The I nvestigator’s assessment of causality for individual AE reports is part of the study 
documentation process and will be recorded in the subject ’s medical record, AE CRF , and SAE  
form if applicable. AEs recorded without the Investigator’s assessment of the relationship to 
study drug will be followed up until causality is assigned.  
12.3.3  Assessment of the Outcome of Adverse Events  
Recovered/resolved:  The subject  has fully recovered from the event , with no residual effects 
observable.  
Recovered/resolved with sequelae:  The subject  has recovered from the event, but with residual 
sequelae effects observable.  
Not recovered/resolved:  Effects of the event are still present.  
Recovering/resolving:  The subject  has improved, but has not fully recovered from the event . 
Fatal:  The death is re lated to the event . 
Unknown:  The outcome of the event is unknown to the reporter ( eg, subject  was lost to 
follow -up).

ProQR Therapeutics   Page 63 of 103 
Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  12.4 Reporting of Adverse Events  
The I nvestigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded in the source 
document, AE CRF , and/or SAE form, and reported to the Sponsor in accordance with protocol 
instructions.  
12.4.1  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
All significant medical conditions including signs/symptoms of the underlying diagnosis found 
during the screening  period and up to randomization will be captured as medical history.  Any 
event/condition related to participation in the trial but not related to underlying or concomitant 
disease  that is  noted after screening  up to the randomization date will be captured as a 
non-treatment emergent AE. 
Any event/condition noted once the subject  is randomized will be captured as an AE. All AEs 
and SAEs regardless of attri bution will be collected until at least 3 0 days following the last 
administration of study treatment or initiation of new therapy, whichever is earlier. At the last 
scheduled visit, the Investigator should instruct each subject  to report to the Investigator any 
subsequent SAEs that the subject ’s personal physician believes could be related to prior study 
treatment.  Any related non -serious AE occurring after the reporting period may be reported at 
the discretion of the Investigator.  
AEs and SAEs  related to study drug that persist >3 0 days after the last study drug  dose should be 
followed until resolution or un til they return to baseline , stabilize , the subject  is lost to follow -up, 
or it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause of the 
AE/SAE . Resolution of AEs and SAEs (with dates) should be documented on the AE CRF and 
SAE  form (if applicable) and in the subject ’s medical record to facilitat e source data verification. 
For some SAEs, the Sponsor or its designee may follow up by telephone, facsimile, electronic 
mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details  deemed necessary to 
appropriately evaluate the SAE report ( eg, hospital discharge summary, consultant report, or 
autopsy report).   
12.4.2  Eliciting Adverse Events  
A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning for eliciting AEs at all subject  evaluation 
time points should be adopted. Examples of non -directive questions include:  
“How have you felt since your last clinic visit?”  
“Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?”  
12.4.3  Recording Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts whe n recording AEs or SAEs on 
the CRF and/or SAE form . Colloquialisms and abbreviations  should be avoided . SAEs must also 
Investigational Product: QR -010 
Protocol No. PQ -010-001 (Version 8.0)  
 
ProQR Therapeutics   Page 64 of 103 
Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  be recorded on the AE CRF . Only one medical concept should be recorded i n the event field on 
the AE CRF and SAE form (if applicable).  
a. Signs and Symptoms  versus Diagnosis  
Signs and symptoms  should be recorded on the AE CRF rather than the unifying diagnosis . The 
unifying event term or diagnosis should  be recorded as the “etiology” in the CRF  (if known), and 
the SAE form, if applicable.  For example, jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases  should 
be record ed on the CRF , and “liver failure” shoul d be recorded as the etiology. As another 
example, cough, rhinitis, and sneezing  should be recorded as AEs on the CRF , and  record “upper 
respirat ory tract infection” as the etiology.  Vague, nonspecific AE terms such as “erythema,” 
“rash,” or “lump on head” should be avoided and more specific information sho uld be provided, 
such as “erythematous macule on right leg,” “allergic dermatitis,” and “scalp cyst.”  
b. Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events  
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events ( eg, cascade events or clinical sequelae) 
should also be entered as separate AEs. For example, if  severe diarrhea is known to have resulted 
in dehydration, both diarrhea and dehydration should be entered as AEs on the CRF , and if also 
serious , on the SAE form.  
c. Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A pe rsistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between subject  evaluation 
time poi nts. Such events shoul d only be recorded once in the CRF un less their severity increases. 
If a persistent AE becomes more severe  or occurs more frequently , it should be recor ded again 
on the AE CRF  with the increased severity grading .  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between subject  evaluation time p oints and 
subsequently recurs. All recurrent AEs should be recorded individually on the AE C RF. 
d. Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that require active management will be 
recorded as AEs on the  CRF  and SAE form (if applicable). For example, abnormalities that 
require study drug dose modification, discontinu ation of study treatment, more frequent follow -
up assessments, further  diagnostic investigation, etc.  
If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term 
should  be recorded as the AE or SAE. For example, an  elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 
mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.”  
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should 
not be repeatedly recorded as AEs on the CRF and SAE form (if applicable) , unle ss their 
severity, seriousness, or etiology changes.

ProQR Therapeutics   Page 65 of 103 
Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  e.  Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period (see Section  12.4.1), 
regardless of attribution, will be recorded on the AE CRF and SAE form and reported to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of event knowledge .  
When recording a death, the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome 
should be recorded as a single medical concept. For example,  if death resulted from respiratory 
failure, the AE recorded should be “Respiratory Failure”, and the Outcome of the AE would be 
“Death”.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, 
record “ unexplained death” on the  AE CRF and SAE form . 
f. Preexisting Medical Conditions  
A preexisting medical condition is one that is pres ent at the start of the study. Such conditions 
should be recorded on the Medical and Surgical History CRF.  
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, 
severity, or character of  the condition worsen s during the study. When recording such events on 
an AE CRF  and SAE form (if applicable) , it is important to convey the concept that the 
preexisting condition has  changed by includin g applicable descriptors ( eg, “more frequent 
headaches”).  
g. Pulmonary Exacerbation   
Given the proposed mechanism of action of QR -010, it could be anticipated that subjects  will 
experience a change in baseline  cough, change in sputum qu ality, or change in sputum volume. 
A diagnosis of pulmonary exacerbation should be considered if these symptoms are accompanied 
by fever, body weight loss, generalized malaise. If a pulmonary exacerbation is diagnosed, 
appropriate interventions including additional antibiotics should be prescribed by the PI or 
treating physician. Subjects diagnosed with a pulmonary exacerbation requiring the addition of 
antibiotics will be withdrawn from the study.  
h. Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery  
Any AE that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and 
reported as an SAE unless specifically instruct ed otherwise in this protocol.  
i. Pregnancy  
If a f emale partner of a male subject  in the study becomes pregnant while her partner is receiving 
investigational therapy or within  6 months after the last dose of study, a Pregnancy form  should 
be completed  and faxed to the Sponsor’s Drug Safety Department or its designee within 24 hours 
of learning of the pregnancy, using the  fax numbers listed in the Study Manual.

Protocol No. PQ -010-001 (Version 8.0)  
 
ProQR Therapeutics   Page 66 of 103 
Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  Abortion, whether therapeutic , or spontaneous, will be reported on a Pregnancy Report form and 
faxed to the Sponsor according to the instructions in the Study Manual. If the abortion meets 
seriousness criteria (see Section  12.5, Serious  Adverse Event Definition), this information will 
be captured on the AE CRF  and SAE form.  
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female subject or to a female  partner of 
a male subject  exposed to the investigational product should be recorded and reported as an SAE.  
j. Overdose Reporting  
Overdoses must be reported to the Sponsor on an AE CRF  and an SAE form for tracking 
purposes and will be considered a protoco l violation. Overdose is defined as any study drug  dose 
administered above the intended dose for the cohort assignment . Additional instructions 
for reporting overdose information will be provided by the Sponsor at the time of notification.  
12.5 Serious Adverse Event Definition  
An SAE is any AE that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect , or precaution 
regardless of t he relationship to study drug. An SAE is any AE that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
 Death  
 Life-threatening AE. This definition implies that the subject , in the view of the 
Investigator, is at immediate risk of death  from the event as it occurred.  It does 
not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 In-subje ct hospitalization or prolongs existing hospitalization, except for hospitalization 
for planned post-dose sample collections  
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity ( ie, the AE results in substantial disruption 
of the subject ’s ability to conduct n ormal life functions)  
 Cong enital anomaly or birth defect.  This serious criterion applies if a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect is diagnosed in a child born to a  female subject, or a  female partner 
of a male subject  exposed to the investigational product.  
 Other important medical events . Medical and scientific judgment should determine 
whether an AE should be classified as serious in other situations, such as important 
medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospitaliz ation, but may jeopardize the subject  or require intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes l isted in the definition above. Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasi as or convulsions that do not result in in patient  hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependence or abuse.  
All A Es that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious A Es.

Protocol No. PQ -010-001 (Version 8.0)  
 
ProQR Therapeutics   Page 67 of 103 
Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  The terms “severe” and  “serious” are not synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an AE 
(as in mild, moderate, or severe pain); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significa nce (such as severe headache). “Serious” is a regulatory definition and is based o n 
subject  or event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject ’s life or vital functions. Seriousness (not severity) serves as the guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations.  
Severity and seriousness s hould be independently assessed when recording AEs and SAEs on the 
CRF  and SAE form . 
12.6 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction Definition  
A SUSAR is a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction.  In order to be qualified as a 
SUSAR, the AE must meet 3 criteria: the event is serious, there is a certain degree of probability 
that the event is a reaction to the medical product being researched and the nature and severity of 
the reaction are not in agreement with the product information ( ie, the reaction is unexpected as 
per the reference safety information). All SUSARs will be reported as required to the Competent 
Authorities of all involved European member states and to the Ethics Committee of the member 
states concerned.  
12.7 Serious Adverse Event s Notificat ion  
For all SAE s, regardless of suspected causality, a n SAE form must  be completed (or faxed if 
using paper form) within 24  hours of discovery of the event to:  
DRUG SAFETY  
Fax toll free:  See Study Manual for Fax Number  
Any fatal or life -threatening ( ie, imminent risk of death) event that is attributed by the 
Investigator to the investigational product must be telephoned to Drug Safety immediately, 
followed by submission of written case details on an SAE form within 24 hours.  
SAEs occurring any time after study participation that are considered by  the Investigator to be 
possibly related to stu dy drug must also be reported. The following are important points to 
remember when  completing the SAE form:  
 If complete information is not available, at a minimum, sub ject identifier, suspect drug, 
site identifier, event or outcome , and I nvestigator assessment of causal relationship to 
study drug should be provided.  
 A rationale for the causality assessment of an SAE should always be included, so that a 
better understand ing of the event can be compiled.

Protocol No. PQ -010-001 (Version 8.0)  
 
ProQR Therapeutics   Page 68 of 103 
Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017   Follow -up information, such as laboratory reports, discharge summaries, autopsy reports , 
and information concerning outcome of the event should be submitted by revising the 
SAE f orm as soon as the information becomes avail able. Copies of source documents 
with subject  identifiers redacted should be submitted only when they are written in 
English. If source doc uments are not in English, the I nvestigator must summarize the 
source documents, providing a complete English narrati ve that includes a description of 
the events as it evolved , the results of all diagnostic procedures performed, treatments 
administered , and outcome of the event. A query regarding a follow -up report should be 
answered within 5 working days from receipt of  the query.  
 Appropriate diagnostic tests and therapeutic measures are to be performed as necessary 
and reported on the SAE form . 
 All SAEs must be reported to the IRB/Independent Et hics Committee, if applicable. See 
ICH GCP E6, Section  4.11.1 . 
12.8 Expedited Reporting of SUSARs  
 The Sponsor or its designee is responsible for notifying the investigational sites of all 
expedited SAEs ( ie, 7/15 Day SUSARs) that occur during any clinical studies that are using 
the investigative compound. The Sponsor or its designee  shall also notify Central Ethics 
Committees and Central IRB of SUSARs or significant risks to subjects, per country 
requirements. All SUSARs will be reported as required to the Com petent Authorities of all 
involved European member states.  
 The Investigator  will notify local IRB or Local Ethics Committees (LECs) of SUSARs or 
significant risks to subjects, per local country requirements. The Investigator must keep 
copies of all AE information, including correspondence with the Sponsor or Local Ethics 
Committe es on file.  
All studies that are conducted within any European  country will comply with the European 
Clinical Trial Directive 2005/28/EC, the Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC and the 
Detailed Guidance CT -3 (2011/C 172/01).  
12.9 Emergency Unblinding Procedur e 
In the event of a medical emergency, when knowledge of treatment assignment is needed for 
immediate medical management of the subject’s health, Investigators can obtain unbl inded 
treatment assignment through the centra lized IWRS system at any time. Thoro ugh 
documentation of the rationale for unblinding is requir ed. Consultation of the study Medical 
Monitor is recommended for all unblinding requests.  
13.0 STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY  
13.1 General Considerations  
A compre hensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) specifies th e statistical methodology, and table, 
figure and listing (TLF) formats for all aspects of the planned analyses. The SAP supports the 
Investigational Product: QR -010 
Protocol No. PQ -010-001 (Version 8.0)  
 
ProQR Therapeutics   Page 69 of 103 
Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  completion of Clinical Study Report (CSR) for this protocol. As the risk profile of QR -010 in 
humans is unknown and this is  a first in human trial, all AEs will be considered in determ ining 
the safety profile  of QR -010 unless obviously unrelated. As an early phase clinical study, 
exploratory analyses not necessarily identified in the SAP may be performed to support the 
clinica l development program. Any post -hoc, or unplanned, analyses not identified in the SAP 
will be clearly identified in the CSR, in accordance with applicable Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOPs) of the sponsor.   
13.2 Determination of Sample Size  
This is a Phase 1 safety study designed to evaluate the safety , tolerability and PK  of QR-010. 
The sample size is not based on power calculations. It is chosen based on  clinical experience  and 
considered to be adequate to fulfil l the objectives of the study.  
Approximately 64 subjects will be enrolled in the study, with 8 subjects per cohort (6 QR-010 
and 2 placebo), 32 each in the SAD and MAD portions of the study. The exact number of 
subjects enrolled is dependent on whether any dose level are to be expanded due to the 
occurrence of DLTs.  
13.3 Randomization and Blinding  
13.3.1  Randomization Procedures  
At screening , potential subjects will be randomized into  the current enrolling cohort. In the event 
that there is both a SAD and MAD cohort enrolling in parallel, the subject may elect 
participation in eit her an open SAD or MAD cohort. All sites will be capable of and expected to 
enroll all cohorts of the study. Subjects  who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none  of the 
exclusion criteria will be elig ible for rando mization. Eligible subjects will be randomized on 
Day -1 by a centralized interactive web response system (IWRS), utilizing the randomization 
schedule generated by the designated unblinded  statistician. The IWRS system  will be used to 
assign dose level and  treatment assignments to subjects , within the cohort type (SAD or MAD) 
selected by the subject at screening .   
Within each dosing cohort, subjects  will be randomized 3:1, QR-010 to placebo.  At least one of 
the first two  subjects enrolled  in the first coho rt will be randomized to receive QR -010.  
13.3.2  Blinding Procedures  
Study drug will be administe red in a double -blind fashion. Study drug and placebo are both 
clear, colorless, and odorless aqueous solutions.  Subjects , Investigator s and study site staff will 
be blinded to treatment assignment. However, due to the requirement for study pharmacists to 
prepare the various study drug dilutions depending on the dosing cohort to which a given study 
subject  is assigned, the study pharmacist(s) will be unblinded to treat ment assignment.

Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  13.3.3  Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who discontinue from the study after randomization without receiving a ny treatment 
will be replaced. Subjects discontinuing the trial before the full course of treatment may be 
replaced by a subject who wil l be assigned the same treatment/dose  as the subject being replaced.  
The decision for replacement will be made by the Sponsor based on available data a nd perceived 
need for additional data.   
13.4 Analysis of  Populations  
Due to its exploratory nature, the analys es for this study will be mainly descriptive . If inferential 
statistics are provided th ey will be interpreated as hypothesis generation . Data analysis will be 
based on descriptive statistics for the dose groups, and when appropriate, pooled across dose 
groups. For continuous variables, the statistics include the following: geometric mean, mean, 
median, log-scale standard deviation, standard error of the mean, minim um and maxim um. For 
categorical variables the statistics include frequency and proportions.  
Screened : All subjects with an informed consent date will be part of this population.  
Randomized : All subjects with a randomization date.  
Safety Population : the population for safety analysis will consist of all subjects  who receive any 
QR-010 or placebo . Subjects will be considered in the actual treatment received . 
Exploratory Analysis  Population : the population for efficacy (clinical activity) analysis will 
consist of all subjects randomized who receive at least one dose of QR -010 or placebo.  Subjects 
will be considered in the actual treatment received.  
Pharmacokinetics (PK) Population : will consist of all subjects  who receive QR-010 and who 
have sufficient  drug concentration measurements  in blood samples  or urine or sputum. This 
population will be used fo r PK analysis.  
13.5 Subject  Disposition, Demographics and Baseline Disease Characteristics  
Subject  disposition will be summarized for the  safety population by dose group. The number and 
percentage of subjects  enrolled in each site will be presented  by geographic region (North 
America and Europe) .  
The number and percentage of subjects  who receive QR-010 will be tabulated by the number of 
doses and the QR-010 dose group.  
Subject  demographics and baseline  characteristics will be summarized for each d ose group. 
Subject  characteristics at baseline  include age, race,  body  weight, and height.  Baseline disease 
characteristics include pulmonary function (percent predicted ), body weight, and CFQ -R

prior to the first dose.  
13.6 Treatment Compliance  
All doses are observed and admi nistered by study staff. Treatment compliance will be 
determined by source records documenting treatment observations  and summarized . 
13.7 Safety Analys es 
13.7.1  Treatment Emergent Adverse Events  
A treatment emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as an event that was not present prior to 
administration of the first dose of study drug and present after the first dose or if it represents the 
exacerbation of an event that was present prior to the first dose.  
AEs noted during the study will be coded to system organ classes (SOCs) and preferred terms 
(PTs)  using the MedDRA dictionary. The overall incidence of TEAEs will be summarized by 
dose group  and classified by SOC  and PT. Deaths, AE severity, seriousness, rel ationship to study 
drug and study discontinuation due to AE will also be tabulated by dose group . An AE will be 
considered drug -related if the Investigator indicated the event is at least “possibly” related or if 
the relationship is missing. AEs with missi ng start dates, but with stop dates overlapping into the 
treatment period will be counted as treatment emergent. All AEs will be listed in subject  listing , 
and summarized by numbers  and percents of subjects by dose for each portion of the study 
separately . If a subject  reports the occurrence of a particular event more than once, the most 
severe of those events will be included in the summary tables of TEAE s, and the most severe of 
the treatment -related events will be included in the summary tables of treatm ent-related events.  
13.7.2  Dose -Limiting Toxicities  
Potential DLTs are reviewed and adjudicated by the DSMC. DLTs will be summarized by dose 
groups . Individual subject  listings will be provided for each DLT including severity . Additional  
descriptive information s uch as associated laboratory values and action taken  will be described in 
the clinical study report . 
13.7.3  Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements will consist of respiratory rate, pulse, blood pressure,  temperature  and 
oximetry . Descriptive summaries (number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum) of actual values and changes from baseline  will be  presented for each 
time point . These summaries will be presented for the safety population and by dose group .

Laboratory measurements (hematology  and chemistry) obtained at baseline  and each study visit 
will be summarized by dose group , whenever possible,  in the following ways:  
 Descriptive statistics of actual results (number of subjects , mean, standard deviation,  
median, minimum, and maximum) for the continuous data and frequencies and 
percentages for the categorical data, for each time point  
 Descriptive statistics (number of subjects , mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 
and maximum) of change from baseline  to each time point  
 Shift tables summarizing the frequencies of subjects  below, within and above the normal 
ranges at baseline  and to maximum and to minimum value during treatment and after 
treatment will be presented .  
 Site local laboratories  were used; s ummar ies will be provided as units/ranges permit . 
13.7.5  Other Safety Assessments  
Other safety assessments, such as urinalysis, ECG s, and physical examination s will be 
summarized and listed as specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
13.8 Pharmacokinetics Ana lyses  
To determine the PK profile of inhaled  administration s at the different dose levels  of QR-010, 
the following PK parameters will be calculated if sufficient data are available for each dose:  
 Cmax: The maximum serum concentration will be taken directly  from the data.  
 Tmax: Time to C max will be taken directly from the data.  
 T½: The terminal elimination half -life will be estimated by non -linear regression analysis 
of the terminal elimination slope , if feasible . 
 AUC 0-t: Area under the curve to the final sa mple with a concentration greater than lower 
limit of quantification (LLQ) will be calculated using the linear trapezoidal method.  
 AUC 0-∞: Area under the curve to infinity will be calculated based on the last observed 
concentration C last(obs) using formula : AUC 0-∞=AUC last+Clast(obs)/λz , if feasible . 
 CL: Serum  clearance will be estimate d using the formula: CL = Dose/ AUC 0-∞. 
Achievement of s teady state of the drug will be determined from trough levels.  
Exact procedure for imputation of data will be described in the SAP.  
All samples obtained from all cohorts will be analyzed to avoid bias in data presentation.

ProQR Therapeutics   Page 73 of 103 
Proprietary and Confidential   04 April  2017  Sparse sampling analysis may be used to miti gate the risk of insufficient data to create individual 
profiles.  The s ame approach may be used for non-compartmental analysis of sputum 
concentrations.  This option provides the opportunity to characterize drug PK in CF patients as 
thoroughly as possible while keeping blood draws to a reasonable minimum for ethical 
considerations.  
Correlation between con centrations in different matrices (serum, urine, sputum) may be 
explored.  
Drug concentrations will be summarized by nominal time point if 3 or more values are available. 
Descriptive statistics for PK parameters will be performed if ≥ 50% of subjects have e valuable 
data and number of values to su mmarize is ≥ 3. 
Geometric means and coefficients of variation will be tabulated for C max, AUC 0-t, AUC 0-∞ and C l 
for each dose group  if possible . Tmax will be summarized by median, minimum and maximum. 
Mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum will be provided for T ½. Exact details for 
statistical analysis of PK concentrations and derived PK parameters will be prese nted in SAP.  
13.9 Immunogenicity  
For subjects  with positive anti -QR-010 antibodies, the impact of the ant ibodies on the PK and 
safety of QR -010 will be evaluated.  
13.10  Exploratory Efficacy Analyses  
The exploratory clinical efficacy endpoint s for the study will be evaluated  for subjects  enrolled 
in MAD  cohorts . The exploratory efficacy evaluations  will include : 
 Pulmonary function  
 Body weight  
 CFQ -R RSS  
 Sweat chloride  
Descriptive statistics of clinical efficacy  will be tabulated by dose group .  
All continuous endpoints will be summarized using the following descriptive statistics: number 
of subjects , mean, standard  deviation, standard error, median, minimum and maximum  and 95% 
confidence intervals for the mean . Categorical endpoints will be summarized using: number of 
subjects , frequency, percentages and the  95% confidence intervals . 
13.11  Interim Analysis

14.0 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
14.1 Changes to the Protocol  
Protocol amend ments must be made only with the prior approval of Sponsor . Sponsor  will 
inform the Investigator in writing of any amendment to the protocol. The Investigator must 
submit the protocol modifications and any informed consent modifications to the IRB/ IEC and 
applicable country authorities , and approval must be obtained before the modifications are 
implemented  (unless a life threatening situation) . The Investigator must send a copy of the 
approval letter from the IRB/ IEC to the designated contract research  organization ( CRO ) for 
Sponsor  review.  
Both  the Sponsor  and the Investigator reserve the right to terminate the study according to the 
study contra ct. The Investigator should notify the IRB/ IEC and applicable country authorities in 
writing of the trial’s completion or early termination and send a copy of the notification to the 
Sponsor . 
14.2 Data Collection and Study Monitoring  
An electronic CRF (eCRF) w ill be used for this study. Study site personnel will be trained and 
authorized to use the system in compliance with  the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)  21CFR 
Part 11 , ICH GCP  and local regulations,  before recording data on eCRFs. All corrections to 
eCRFs will be made by authorized users, and the changes will be automatically logged in the 
audit trail o f the system  (time and date stamps and the user entering or updating data) . 
eCRFs should be completed for every subject  screened or enrolled in the study . Each subject will 
be identified by a unique subject identifier (site number and subject number). At the study’s 
conclusion, a PDF file will be created for each site containing their subjects ’ data submitted on 
eCRFs. In the event of an audit or regulatory authority inspection, copies of the eCRFs will be 
printed.  
The Investigator will ensure that the eCRF s are accurate, complete, and completed in a timely 
fashion. The Investigator will ensure that source documents that are required to verify the 
validity and completeness of data transcribed on the eCRFs are never obliterated or destroyed. 
Separate source r ecords are require d to support all eCRF entries. The eCRF is not to be used to 
document data without prior written or electronic records.  
To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects  and sites, a clinical data management 
review will be perfor med on subject  data. During this review, subject  data will be checked for 
consistency, omissions, a nd any apparent discrepancies. In addition, the data will be reviewed for

management review process, data que ries will be sent to the site. Corrections or updates to the 
data resulting from queries should be ma de on the eCRF. All changes will be automatically 
documented in the software’s audit trail, including the reason  for change.  
The Investigator will  electronically  sign and date the  indicated places on the eCRF. These 
signatures will indicate that the Investigator inspected or reviewed the data on the eCRF and 
agrees with the content.  
A Sponsor  representative will con tact the Investigator(s) at periodic intervals by telephone or 
visit for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and assessing the progress o f the study. CRFs, 
eCRFs, and subject  records will be reviewed at on -site visits at regular intervals throughout t he 
study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data ; 
and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research. The monitor should have 
access to subject  medical records and other study -related rec ords needed to verify the entries on 
the CRFs and eCRF.  
The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the 
course of these monitoring visits, including delays in completing CRFs/eCRF, are resolved.  
Inspection of site facilities ( eg, pharmacy, drug storage areas, laboratories) and review of study -
related records will occur to evaluate the trial conduct and compliance with the protocol, ICH 
GCP, and appli cable regulatory requirements. Study drug dispensing and ac countability will also 
be assessed.

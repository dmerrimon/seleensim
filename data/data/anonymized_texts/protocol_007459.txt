3.6.1.  Efficacy  
Primary efficacy will be assessed on the basis of preparation success or failure  after 
completion of the examination . Investigators will grade each preparation on a scale 
from 1 (poor) to 4 (excellent) . This scale is similar to those used in numerous previous 
studies to support the approvals of GoLYTELY, NuLYTELY, HalfLytely with 
Bisacodyl Ta blet Bowel Prep Kit and SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit1. Secondary efficacy 
measur es are described in Section 4. 9.3. 
3.6.2.  Safety  
Safety will be assessed through the collection of treatment emergent adverse events, as 
well as changes in vital signs, physical examination findings and serum chemistry 
measures from Visit 1 .   
3.6.3.  Tolerability  
The tolerability of each dose will be assessed by caregivers using a categorical scale 
inclusive of the following responses: very badly accepted/unacceptable; badly, but 
accepted; neither g ood nor bad; well accepted; very well accepted.

Study procedures are described as follo ws and depicted graphically in Section  4.6, 
below.  
4.1. Visit 1  
Following the informed consent process,  caregiver s will sign a consent form. Subjects 
of age to provide assent (as determined by the IRB for each center) will sign an assent 
form. Subject’s demographics  and concomitant medications will be recorded, vital 
signs will be obtained  (including temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, orthostatic 
manual  blood pressure , height and weight ), and a physical examination  will be 
performed .  An electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed and subjects with an 
abnormal ECG will be  excluded from continuing in the study. Medical history will be 
record ed to include all ongoing conditions at Visit 1 as well as any significant 
conditions, defined as:  
Abdominal surgeries, Renal failure/dysfunction, Liver failure/dysfunction, 
Cardiac disorders (e.g. myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease 
tachycardi a), Hypertension, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Rectal Bleeding, 
Polyposis, Diabetes, Cancer (must indicate type of cancer), Electrolyte 
abnormalities  
Blood and urine samples  will be collected for testing at a central laboratory . The 
specific testing to be c onducted is described below.  Please r efer to the laboratory 
manual for detailed instructions on sample processing. Colonoscopies must  be 
scheduled to allow fo r receipt of laboratory results  prior to the day the subject is 
scheduled to begin preparation.  
 
Serum Testing : albumin, ALT, anion gap, AST, bicarbonate, total bilirubin, 
blood urea nitrogen, calcium, chloride, creatine kinase  (CK) , creatinine, eGFR, 
GGT,  glucose , HCG,  magnesium, osmolality, osmolar gap, phosphorus, 
potassium, sodium, sulfate, total protein,  and uric acid . CK-MB will be tested in 
samples where the CK value is greater than 2.5 times the upper normal limit.

Protocol Number BLI800 -502 
Version dated  4/18/16  Page 18 of 40 Urine Testing:  standard spot urinalysis (including microscopic analysis and 
ketones)   
 
Investigators will be notified promptly b y the central laboratory if a critical 
result is reported for the following tests:  
 Calcium   < 6.1 mg/dL (low)  > 12.9 mg/dL (high)  
 Creatine Kinase  > 2000 U/L  
 Glucose   < 40 mg/dL (low)  > 450 mg/dL (high)  
 Potassium   < 2.8 mEq/L (low)  > 6.3 mEq/L (high)  
   Sodium   < 117 mEq/L (low)  > 160 mEq/L (high)  
   HCG    Positive  
 
Investigators should discontinue subjects with a critical value unless they feel 
the result is erroneous due to poor sample quality or laboratory error. In such 
cases the investigator must p erform a redraw.  
 
Subjects meeting all entry criteria will be eligible for randomization.  
 
 
4.1.1.  Randomization  
Subjects that meet eligibility criteria will be randomized  using an automated interactive 
web response system (IWRS). The randomization schedule wil l be implemented in the 
automated interactive web response (IWR) system prior to kit distribution to the site. 
At the time of randomization the IWRS will assign a drug kit number for site personnel 
to dispense to the subject. Subjects will be stratified in to one of the following two 
groups:  
Group 1 : Subjects with a baseline weight > 40 kg  
Group 2 : Subjects with a baseline weight < 40 kg  
 
The site personnel must only dispense a drug kit that has been assigned by the IWRS.  
Dispensing kits out of order is co nsidered a protocol violation.

Subjects and c aregivers will be provided with instructions on how to administer the 
study preparation. Subjects  will be provided with a Preparation Questionnaire (see 
Section 4. 7) to report their experience with the study preparation. Subjects will 
complete this questionnaire from the time the first dose of study drug is taken until the 
colonoscopy and will return it to the clinic at Visit 2.   Subjects should complete the 
questionnaire themselves; however, in the event that  subjects are unable to complete 
the questionnaire, caregivers are allowed to do so.  Subject intake of food, beverages 
(including amounts) and medications will be recorded in a specific section of this 
questionnaire.  
 
4.1.2.  Study Drug  
The study preparation will be administered starting on the day prior to the  scheduled 
colonoscopy according to the instructions noted in Section 4.1.3 . Caregivers/s ubjects 
will be instructed to bring the used preparation components when they return for 
colonoscopy.  
 
Subjects that h ave clinically significant electrolyte abnormalities, in the opinion of the 
principle investigator, based on Visit 1 laboratory results must be discontinued from 
the study. Caregivers /subjects  must be notifie d and instructed to return the  unopened 
bowel pr eparation to the study center.   Returned un-used study drug kits will not be re -
dispensed  to another subject.

Protocol Number BLI800 -502 
Version dated  4/18/16  Page 22 of 40 4.2. Visit 2 – Day of Colonoscopy  
Subjects and Caregivers will return to the study center for colonoscopy following  
completion of the preparation. Sites should attempt to schedule subjects a minimum of 4 
days from date of screening to allow for receipt and review of screening lab results up to a 
maximum of 30 days. Visits scheduled beyond 30 days from Visit 1 will be c onsidered a 
protocol violation and subjects must have a repeat blood draw.  
 
Subjects/ Caregivers will bring back the  Preparation  Questionnaire.  Study personnel 
must review the questionnaire for completeness in the presence of the subject /caregiver  
so that any missed responses can be captured.  Any violations of the dietary restrictions 
must be confirmed with the subject.  
 
Subject ’s vital signs  (see section 4.1 for details)  will be repeated , a physical 
examination will be performed, and the subject will be qu eried for occurrence of 
adverse events and changes in concomitant medications . Blood and urine sample s will 
be collected for laboratory  testing .  
 
Prior to the colonoscopy, subjects will complete the Symptom Scale  (see Section 4. 8) 
to report their overall experience with the preparation.  
 
The colonoscopy will be performed by a physician according to the site’s standard 
procedures and evaluated on a 4 -point scale, as shown in Section 4.9. Additional data 
will be collected as outlined in Section 4. 9.3. 
 
Subjects will be instructed to bring the used preparation components when they return for 
colonoscopy to determine compliance. Failure of a subject to return preparation 
components does not constitute a protocol violation. Staff members will perform drug 
accou ntability by assessing the number of used BLI800  bottles  and volume of remaining 
solution in the NuLYTELY jug. 
 
All used and unused components of study preparation  must be accounted for on the drug 
inventory log and will be returned to the Sponsor at the c ompletion or termination of the 
study, unless instructed otherwise by the Sponsor.

Protocol Number BLI800 -502 
Version dated  4/18/16  Page 25 of 40 4.7 Subject  Preparation  Questionnaire  
A Preparation Questionnaire  will be completed by the subject from the time the 
preparation is started until the subject completes the preparation . This questionnaire 
must be returned to a member of site staff at Visit 2.  The questionnaire will prompt 
subjects for dosing and completion times for the study pre paration and additional water 
(including water amount), and will contain questions about their bowel movement 
experiences during the preparation.  
 
The section of the questionnaire entitled Dietary Compliance should be completed 
from the morning the subjec t starts their study preparation (i.e. day before the 
colonoscopy)  until their procedure the following day. The subject  will be instructed 
to record all food and beverages consumed during this two day period, keeping in 
mind the dietary restrictions outlin ed above in Section 4.1.3.  
 
The section of the questionnaire entitled Dosing Tolerability should be completed by 
the caregiver after the subject completes each dose  of preparation ( NuLYTELY 
subjects will only have one questionnaire). Caregivers will be as ked to rate subject 
tolerability using the following  categories:   
- Very badly accepted/ unacceptable : subject showed great displeasure, 
compromising use of formulation  
- Badly but accepted:  subject showed displeasure with dosing but could be 
coaxed to take co mplete dose  
- Neither good nor bad : subject showed no apparent displeasure and with little 
effort was coaxed to take complete dose  
- Well accepted : subject appeared to enjoy the formulation and with little 
coaxing ingested most of dose  
- Very well accepted : subj ect appeared eager and ingested most of dose 
without special coaxing.  
 
4.8 Subject Symptom Scale  
 
This questionnaire  will be completed by the subject at Visit 2, prior to colonoscopy . 
Subjects will rate their overall experience of stomach cramping, stomach blo ating and 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI800 -502 
Version dated  4/18/16  Page 26 of 40 nausea on a 5 point scale, with 1 = no symptoms and 5 = severely distressing 
symptoms.  
 
4.9 Physician Assessments  
4.9.1 Segmental Cleansing Assessment  
The blinded colonoscopist will rate each colon segment (proximal, mid, distal) using 
the following scale . This assessment will be performed during the withdrawal  portion 
of the examination .  
 
Score  Grade  Description  
1 Poor  Large amounts of fecal residue, additional 
bowel preparation required  
2 Fair Enough feces even after washing and suctioning 
to prevent clear visualization of the entire 
colonic mucosa.  
3 Good  Feces and fluid requiring washing and 
suctioning, but still achieves clear visualization 
of the entire colonic mucosa.  
4 Excellent  No more than small bits of feces/fluid which 
can be suctioned easi ly; achieves clear 
visualization of the entire colonic mucosa  
 
 
4.9.2 Overall  Cleansing Assessment  
The blinded  colonoscopist will provide a global rating of preparation quality for the 
entire colon (inclusive of their perception of all segments) using the scale  outlined in 
Section 4.9.1.  This assessment will be performed upon completion of the 
examination (withdrawal of the endoscope).   
 
4.9.3 Additional Efficacy Measures  
In addition , the following data will be collected:  
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI800 -502 
Version dated  4/18/16  Page 27 of 40 1. Adequacy of preparation according to the bli nded colonoscopist. If the 
preparation was not adequate, the need for re -preparation will be 
recorded.  
2. Start time of colonoscopy  
3. Time of cecal intubation  
4. Completion time of colonoscopy  
5. Volume of water used to improve visualization  
 
4.10 Pregnancy  
All female su bjects  must  have a serum  pregnancy test done at screening. A positive 
result will rule out the participation of the  subject in the study.  
 
Female study s ubject s must us e oral contraceptives, depot contraceptives, double -
barrier method, intrauterine device,  or testify that she is monogamou s, or practices 
abstinence and will continue to do so during the duration of study.  Subjects 
practicing abstinence must agree to use an acceptable form of birth control should 
they become sexually active during the study.  
 
Oral contraceptives, hormone implants, and injections should be stable for  at least 1 
month before colonoscopy , until 1 month after colonoscopy .  
 
If a subject becomes pregnant during the study, the subject must be removed from 
the study and followed unti l one month after the end of the pregnancy.   A pregnancy 
will not be recorded as an adverse event .  
4.11 Concomitant Medication s 
The use of concomitant medication (defined as prescription, over the counter and 
homeopathic medications) will be recorded from 14 days prior to screening until 
completion of Visit 5 (Day 32), including sedation medications and intravenous fluids 
administered during colonoscopy.

5.1 Adverse Event Definition and Reporting  
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurr ence associated with the use  of a 
drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant  abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated  with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product.  Subjects will be queried for any problems they experienced 
during and after preparation by site personnel.  Site personnel should review the 
preparation questionnaire section related to adverse events  and discuss any documented 
events with subjects/caregivers.  
 
In addition, any symptom on the symptom scale rated as 2 (mild) to 5 (severely 
distressing) must be reported as an adverse event. Reports of vomiting (of any severity) 
must be documented as adv erse events. If multiple episodes of vomiting are reported on 
the Treatment Questionnaire, these should be represented as one adverse event on the 
case report form with severity reflecting the most severe episode.  
 
Any abnormal anion gap laboratory finding  must be reported as an adverse event and 
followed until resolution. Colonoscopy and biopsy findings are not considered adverse 
events unless considered by the investigator to be related to the preparation  or 
colonoscopy procedure .  
Adverse event collectio n will commence at the time the patient provides informed 
consent to participate in the study and will conclude with the completion of Visit 4. For 
subjects requiring Visit 5, adverse events will be collected until completion of Visit 5.   
 
Subjects will be  instructed to promptly report adverse events to the Investigator. The 
Investigator will record date/time of report, date/time of onset, description of the adverse 
event, severity of adverse event, action(s) taken regarding treatment of the event, 
action(s ) taken regarding study participation, duration of adverse event, and the 
Investigator's assessment of relationship of adverse event to study preparation .  
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI800 -502 
Version dated  4/18/16  Page 29 of 40 The Investigator should assess  the severity of each adverse event  using the following 
categories:  
Grade Severity  Description  
1 Mild  Barely noticeable, does not influence functioning  
causing no limitations of usual activities  
2 Moderate  Makes participant uncomfortable, influences functioning  
causing some limitations of usual activities  
3 Severe  Severe discomfort, treatment needed  
Severe and undesirable, causing inability to carry out usual  
activities  
4 Life 
threatening  Immediate risk of death , Life threatening or disabling  
(Must be reported as serious adverse event ) 
5 Fatal  Causes death of the partici pant 
(Must be reported as serious adverse event)   
 
The Investigator should assess the relationship to study drug for each adverse event 
using  the following categories:  
Categories of 
Attribution:  Description  
UNRELATED  There is no evidence of any causal r elationship.  
POSSIBLE  There is some  evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the 
event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of 
the trial medication). However, the influence of other factors 
may have contributed  to the event (e.g. , the subject ’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant events).  
PROBABLE  There is evidence  to suggest a causal relationship, and the 
influence of other factors is unlikely . 
DEFINITE  There is clear  evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and 
other possi ble contributing factors can be ruled out . 
 
5.2 Adverse Events  in Prior Clinical Studies  
BLI800  
In Phase 3 clinical trials  of adult subjects , the most frequent a dverse events reported 
by patients taking  SUPREP (reported by >3% of patients) included overall 
discomfort, abdominal pain and distension, nausea, and vomiting. In a pilot study in 
adolescents (Study BLI800 -501), the incidences of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain 
and bloating were similar to those seen in adults. Most subjects reported no 
symptoms or r ated them as mild .  
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI800 -502 
Version dated  4/18/16  Page 30 of 40 6 SERIOUS ADVERSE REACTIONS AND DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that results in 
at least one of the following outcomes:  
 
- Results in death  
- Is life -threatening  
- Requires inpatient hos pitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
- A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
- Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
- Requires medical or surgical intervention to prev ent permanent impairment 
or damage  
 
  SAE collection will coincide with the patient providing informed consent to 
participate in the study and will conclude 30 days after the subject took their 
preparation . Pre-scheduled surgeries, or examination findings not related to the 
preparation will not be considered serious adverse events. Should a serious and/or 
unexpected adverse event occur, the Investigator will notify Braintree Laboratories 
immediately or no later than 24 hours after gaining knowledge of the e vent.  The 
Investigator will make a decision regarding continuing study participation,  and may 
request input from Braintree Laboratories. The Investigator will be responsible for 
recommending or providing the patient with appropriate medical therapy. All p atients 
experiencing serious adverse events will be followed until clinically stable.  
 Braintree Laboratories must be  kept apprised of all follow -up information 
related to serious adverse events. In addition, Investigators must comply with the SAE 
reporti ng requirements of the Institutional Review Board with oversight of the study.

Version dated  4/18/16  Page 33 of 40 9 DATA ANALYSIS  
9.1 Efficacy  
Primary e fficacy will be assessed on the ba sis of a binary outcome of overall 
preparation success or failure. For statistical analyses, the following definition of 
preparation  success and failure will be used:  
 
Definition of successful preparation :  
1. Overall Cleansing Assessment by the colonoscopist  (Section 4.9.2) of  
“Excellent ” or “Good” and does not satisfy any of the following failure criteria.    
  
Definition of failed preparation :  
1. Overall Cleansing Assessment of “Fair” or “Poor” by the colonoscopist  
2. Any subject who did not have a colon oscopy b ased on the Investigator’s 
assessment of the cleansing (insufficient fecal output, unclear fecal discharge, 
etc.) or due to preparation related adverse events.  
 
3. Any subject for whom cleaning was not adequate for evaluation  
 
Inevaluable Patients:  
Subjects w ho were dispensed a kit but withdrew from the study prior to taking any 
preparation (including subjects who were disqualified subsequent to Visit 1 based on 
screening laboratory results) are excluded from the efficacy and safety analyses. Any 
subject who c ompletely or partially took study preparation  but did not have a 
colonoscopy due to non -preparation related reasons will not be included in the 
efficacy analyses . All treated subjects will be included in the safety analysis.  
 
Superiority Hypothesis:  
The pr imary endpoint of treatment success will be based upon the difference D=P 1-
P2, where P 1 is the observed success fraction in the BLI800 group  (experimental 
group) and P 2 is the observed success fraction in the NuLYTELY group  (control 
group).  The procedure tests the null hypothesis  
H0: π1-π2=0 
versus the alternative hypothesis  
H1: π1-π2 ≠0, 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI800 -502 
Version dated  4/18/16  Page 34 of 40 where π 1 is the true underlying probability of successful treatment in the BLI800 
group , and π 2 is the true underlying success probability in the NuLYTELY group .   
 
We wi ll test the null hypothesis of superiority separately for the comparisons of full -
dose BLI800 vs. NuLYTELY and 4.5 -ounce BLI800 vs. NuLYTELY .  We will 
preserve the family -wise type I error rate at 5% using the Holm -Bonferroni 
approach, which involves compa ring the smaller of the two P values to 0.025 and, if 
that is significant, the larger of the two P values to 0.05 .  If both comparisons are 
significant, we will conduct a test comparing the two dose levels of BLI800 at the 
two-sided 5% level.  As we will o nly perform this test conditionally on the other 
tests being significant, it has no effect on the family -wise type I error rate, and so it 
requires no further multiplicity adjustment.  
 
Secondary endpoints will be analyzed in a manner similar to the primary  analysis 
using the CMH test adjusting for site effects for count (percentage) outcomes and 
two-way ANOVA with terms for treatment, site, and their interaction for continuous 
responses. No adjustment will be made for multiplicity in testing the secondary 
endpoints.  P values will be presented for hypothesis tests, and two -sided 95% 
confidence intervals for estimates of treatment effects.  
  
Secondary efficacy endpoints will include proportion of excellent preparations, 
cleansing score by segment, proportion of examinations that reach the cecum, and 
volume of additional water used for washing.  
 
9.2 Safety  
Adverse Events:  
All subjects who took preparation in any amount will be included in the safety 
analysis.  All adverse events will be  analyzed based on the princi ple of treatment 
emergence. A sign or symptom will be  regarded as treatment -emergent if it was 
present prior to the first dose and subsequently worsened in severity, or was not 
present prior to the first dose but subsequently appeared.  
 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI800 -502 
Version dated  4/18/16  Page 35 of 40 In order to define treatment emergence for events with missing start or stop dates the 
following additional criteria w ill be  used:  
• if both the onset and resolution dates for a particular event are missing, then 
the event is considered treatment -emergent;  
• if the onset date fo r an event is missing and the resolution date f alls after the 
initiation of the first dose, then the event is considered treatment -emergent;  
• if the onset date for an  event f alls after the initiation of the first dose and the 
resolution date is missing or  present, then the event is considered treatment -
emergent; and  
• if the onset date for a n event falls before the initiation of the first dose and the 
stop date is missing or  present, then the event is not considered treatment -
emergent.  
 
Adverse events will be collected using MedDRA category designations for body 
system and preferred  term. The number and percent  of subjects who experienced 
each adverse event will be  presented in a tabular form.  Individual tables will be  
provided for treatment -emergent adverse e vents, treatment -emergent adverse events 
by relationship to study drug , and treatment -emergent adverse events by severity. 
The difference in adverse events between study populations will be  tested by the 
Fisher’s exact test together with a 95% confidence i nterval  for the treatment effect 
estimate . 
 
Vitals Signs and Physical Examination:  
Vital signs and physical examination data will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics.  
 
Laboratory Data:  
Results of laboratory tests for the change from baseline (Screeni ng) and treatment 
group differences will be  tested using ANOVA.  In addition, shift tables will be  
presented to describe changes in lab parameter values between screening and post -
treatment time  points using normal range categories (low, normal, high).  
 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI800 -502 
Version dated  4/18/16  Page 36 of 40 Symptom Questionnaire Data:  
Symptom questionnaire data for individual symptoms for Overall Experience 
(Stomach Cramping, Stomach Bloating and Nausea)  will be  presented categorically 
by severity and tested by Chi -Square test.  
 
9.3 Tolerability  
Tolerability data will be presented categorically and tested by Chi -Square test.  
 
9.4 Sample Size  
The primary aim of the study is to show that BLI800 is superior to NuLYTELY in 
the proportion of subjects with successful  colon cleansing. Based on prior studies in 
adult subjects , the proportion of subjects experiencing successful cleansing is 
expected to be approximately 95% in the BLI800 group and 77% in the NuLYTELY 
group. We will test the hypothesis of superiority separately for the two BLI800 dose 
groups:  BLI800 full dose vs . NuLYTELY , and BLI800 4.5 ounce dose vs. 
NuLYTELY .  To control the family -wise type I error rate at 5%, we will perform a 
Holm -Bonferroni adjustment, testing the hypothesis for the smaller of the two P 
values  at the two -sided 2.5% level  and, if significan t, testing the hypothesis for the 
larger of the two P values at the two -sided 5% level .  Assuming similar rates in the 
adolescent population and a one -sided alpha of 0.0125, with 81 subjects per group 
(243 total), the study will have 80% power to reject th e null hypothesis of 
equivalence. 100 subjects will be enrolled in each preparation group to account for 
dropouts.   
 
9.5. Study  Populations  
The following populations have been defined for data analyses.  
9.5.1. Intention -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
This populati on includes all subjects randomized to treatment . Safety and efficacy 
analyses using the ITT population  will be used to support the primary study analyses 
using the modified ITT  population .  
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI800 -502 
Version dated  4/18/16  Page 37 of 40 9.5.2.  Modified Intention -to-Treat (mITT) Population  
This population co nsists of all randomized subjects that took  at least one dose of 
study medication. The mITT population will serve as the analysis population for all 
primary and secondary safety and efficacy analyses. Safety and efficacy analyses 
using the mITT population  will be used to support the primary study analyses using 
the per -protocol population . 
9.5.3.  Per Protocol Population  
The per-protocol (PP) population will consist of all subjects in the mITT population 
who have not violated any major entry criteria and have not deviated significantly 
from the protocol during the course of the study. Reasons for exclusion from the PP 
population will be defined prospectively in the statistical analysis plan and prior to 
unblinding of the data.  Safety and efficacy analyses using the  per-population  will be 
used to support the primary study analyses using the per -protocol population . 
 
10 DRUG INVENTORY AND DISPOSITION  
At the conclusion of the study, all drug materials will be accounted for.  Federal law 
requires that, at the conclusion of  the study, all drug materials must be returned to the 
study sponsor or destroyed according to local regulations.

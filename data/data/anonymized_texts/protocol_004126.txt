 PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
Study Title  
A PILOT STUDY OF RNS60  IN ALS  
 
Version Number  
6.0 
 Protocol Number  
RNS60 -01 
 
Study Indication  
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)  
 
Phase of Development  
IIa 
 
Rationale for the Study  
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure.  
  
A substantial body of evidence implicates the neuroimmune system and specifically activated 
microglia in ALS pathophysiology. Activated microglia are increased in postmortem brain and 
spinal cord tissue from patients with ALS compared to healthy controls, and the number of activated microglia correlates positively with faster rate of disease progression. In addition, studies of blood cells in people with ALS have shown an increased activation of two of the major 
inflammatory cell types in the body, mo nocytes and T cells. Among T  cells, regulatory T cells 
(Tregs) have been recently proposed to play a role in ALS progression. Tregs and their FoxP3 
protein expressions were reduced in rapidly progressing ALS  patients and inversely correlated with 
progressi on rates. A 3.5- year prospective study revealed that early reduced FoxP3 levels were 
predictive of future rapid progression and attenuated surviva l. These data suggest that Tregs may 
influence disease progression rates in ALS.

Study Design  
This is a single center, open label , pilot trial of RNS6 0 in people with ALS. Study pa rticipants will 
receive study drug for 24 weeks following the core study schedule of activities. Upon nearing 
completion of the core study, subjects will be given the option to continue to receive drug for approximately an additional 24 weeks, for a total of approximately 48 weeks on study drug, following the optional extension phase schedule of activities.  
 
 
Study Objectives and Endpoints  
The primary objective s of the study are to determine the preliminary safety  and tolerability  of 
RNS60  treatment in  18 people with ALS  over 24 weeks .  We will measure the impact of RNS60 on 
blood biomarkers of inflammation. In addition, in a subgroup of  13 study participants ( “Imaging 
group” ), an additional primary objective is  to measure the impact of RNS60 on [11C]-PBR 28 uptake 
in the motor cortices and brain stem measured by positron emission tomography ( PET) imaging .

Page 9 of 67 
 We will also  measure  the effect of RNS60 on ALS clinical outcomes [ALS functional rating scale 
(ALSFRS -R), slow vital capacity (SVC), strength (measured  by ATLIS - Accurate Test of Limb 
Isometric Strength)] .  
For participants who elect to continue with the optional 24 week extension, safety parameters (labs, 
EKG, adverse events, C -SSRS) will continue to be monitored. We will also collect ALSFRS -R and 
SVC o utcome measures.  
 
Study Location 
Massachusetts General Hospital  (MGH)  
 
Number of Planned Subjects  
Up to 25 subjects will be  screened for  the study  with the goal of enrolling 18 for tre atment . All 18 
enrolled subjects will be given an opportunity to sign a consent form addendum during Weeks 18-
22 to receive approximately 24 additional weeks of drug treatment.  
Study Population  
This study will be conducted in subjects who meet the El Escorial criteria of possible, laboratory -
supported probable, probable, or definite criteria for a diagnosis of ALS .  At screening, eligible 
subjects must be at least 18 years old and must provide written informed consent prior to screening. 
Subjects on a stable dose of riluzole and those not taking riluzole, and women of child-be aring age 
at screening are eligible for inclusion as long as they meet specific protocol requirements.  Safety,  
tolerability , blood biomarkers, and clinical outcomes will be collected  on all subjects . In a subgroup 
of 10 study participants (“ Imaging group”) neuro- imaging will be performed . Detailed criteria are 
described in the body of the protocol.  
Treatment Plan  
RNS60 will be administered in two ways: by intravenous (IV) infusion one day a week (infusion dose: 375ml, infused over a 40 -min period) and by inhalation (the remaining 6 days a week, 4  
ml/day)  for 24 weeks or up to approximately 48 weeks. 
 
Duration of Treatment and Follow- up 
Subjects will remain on treatment  in the core study  for 24 weeks .  Each subject will also have a 
Week 28 Follow- up Telephone Interview to assess for adverse events (AEs), changes in 
concomitant medications and to administer the ALSFRS -R. After the completion of the trial, 
subjects will be called by phone approximately every 3 months to ascertain ALSFRS -R and vital 
status for up to 2 years.

 Optional Extension Phase  
Upon nearing completion of the core study, subjects will be given the option to continue RNS60 treatment for an additional 24 weeks of weekly infusions and daily inhalations. Subjects interested 
in continuing treatment in the extension phase will sign an additional IRB -approved consent 
addendum document with the physician -investigator during a clinic visit between Week 18 and 
Week 23.  Extension phase drug dispensing will occur at the Week 23 visit. Safety paramete rs such 
as blood work, urine samples, EKGs, and adverse event recording will continue to be monitored during the extension phase. ALSFRS -R and SVC outcome measures will be collected at two time 
points. Each subject will also have a Week 52 Follow -up Telephone Interview to assess for adverse 
events (AEs), changes in concomitant medications and to administer the ALSFRS -R. After the 
completion of the trial, subjects will be called by phone approximately every 3 months to ascertain ALSFRS -R and vital status for up to 2 years.  
 
Subjects may choose to discontinue RNS60 treatment at any point during the optional extension 
phase.

Page 23 of 67 3 OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Study Objectives  
The primary objectives of the study are to determine the safety and tolerability of RNS60 in  18 
patients  with ALS. The following c linical outcomes will b e collected : ALS functional rating 
scale (ALSFRS -R), slow vital capacity (SVC), strength (measured by ATLIS - Accurate Test of 
Limb Isometric Strength) . An additional primary objective is to measure the impact of RNS60 on 
several markers of neuro -inflammation measured by blood biomarkers  in all subjects and by 
[11C]-PBR28 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in a subgroup of 13 subjects . 
3.2 Study Outcome Measures  
For all subjects enrolled in the study, t he following will be  primary  outcome measures:  
1- Safety, as measured by AEs and clinically meaningful changes in vital signs, physical 
examination, and sta ndard clinical laboratory tests; 
2- Tolerability, defined as the ability of subjects to complete the entire 24-week treatment 
portion of study;  
3- Clinical outcomes: Measured by ALSFRS -R, SVC, and strength (measured by ATLIS).  
4- Blood biomarkers of inflammation . 
 
For subjects in the “Imaging group” , the following additional outcome measures  will be 
obtained: 
1- Neuroimaging biomarker s ([11C]-PBR28 -PET)  including both regions of interest (ROI) 
and voxel- based analyses

Page 24 of 67 4 STUDY DESIGN 
4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
During the enrollment period , approximately 25 subjects will be screened at the Massachusetts 
General Hospital (MGH) .  Approx imately  18 of these subjects are expected to be eligible to 
receive RNS60  per study protocol.  RNS60 will be administered in two ways: by IV infusion one 
day a week (infusions to occur at MGH ) and by inhalation  (once a day for the remaining 6 days a 
week ). All visit windows (± 3 days) are consecutive calendar days and are calculated from the 
day the participant starts study treatment (the day of the Baseline Visit).  
4.2 Study Centers  
This study will be conducted a s a single center study at the MGH . 
4.3 Study Duration 
Subjects  in the core study  will remain on treatment for 24 weeks . Subjects may elect to continue 
with the 24- week extension phase sometime between Week 18 and Week 2 3. Each subject will 
also have a Follow- up Telephone Interview  28 days ±5 to assess for AEs, changes in 
concomitant medications and to administer the ALSFRS -R. 
4.4 Protocol Adherence  
The Principal  Investigators (PIs) agree to  adhere to the protocol detailed in this document and 
agrees that any changes to the protocol must be approved by the site In stitutional Review Board 
(IRB).   The PIs will be responsible for enrolling only those study subjects who have met 
protocol eligibility criteria.

Page 25 of 67 5 S ELECTION  AND WITHDRAWAL  OF STUDY POPULATION 
5.1 Number of Study Subjects  
Approximately 25 subjects will be consented for the study . Any subject who signs consent will 
be considered enrolled in the study. Screening study procedures will begin after informed 
consent. 
 
If a subject fails screening, at a minimum, the following information will be cap tured and entered 
in the data capture system: inclusion/exclusion criteria, demographics, screening lab results, reason for screen failure.  
 Fifteen  (15) subjects will receive  RNS60 for  up to 48 weeks  per study protocol and will be 
followed up to 52 w eeks.  
5.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
5.2.1 Inclusion  Criteria  
 Study subjects meeting all of the following criteria will be allowed to enroll in the study:  
1- ALS volunteers must be diagnosed as having possible, probable, probable -laboratory 
supported, or definite ALS, either sporadic or familial according to modified El Escorial 
criteria.  
2- Age 18-80, able to provide informed consent, and comply with study procedures.  
3- Participants must not have taken riluzole for at least 30 days, or be on a stable dose of  
riluzole for at least 30 days, prior to screening (riluzole -naïve participants are permitted 
in the study).  
4- Women must not be  lactating or  able to become pregnant (e.g. post menopausal, 
surgically sterile, or using adequate birth control) for the duration of the study and 3 
months after study completion.  
5- Males should practice contraception for the duration of the study and 3 months after completion. 
 
Study subjects  in the “Imaging group” will also need to meet the following additional inclusion 
criteria:  
1- Ability to safely lie flat for 90 min for PET procedures  in the opinion of the study 
physician.  
2- High or mixed affinity to bind TSPO protein (Ala/Ala or Ala/Thr) (Details below).  
3- Score of 25 or greater (out of 45) on the Upper Motor Neuron Burden (Details below).  
 
 
RNS60 in ALS  
V 4.0 
1/29/2016 
Page 26 of 67 TSPO affinity test: venous blood will be drawn from all participants at Screening in order to 
have them genotyped for the Ala147Thr TSPO polymorphism  in the TSPO  gene (rs6971) . About 
10% of humans show low binding affinity to PBR2824. A recent study has demonstrated that the 
rs6971 polymorphism predicts PBR28 binding affinity in human platelets25. Since the low -
affinity binder phenotype is consistent across all tissues within the same person, testing for the  
Ala147Thr polymorphism can be performed to predict low affinity for PBR28 in all organs, 
including the brain25. High or Mixed affinity binders (Ala/Ala or Ala/Thr) will be considered 
eligible, whereas the low affinity binders (Thr/Thr) will be considered ineligible for the  study. 
 
Upper Motor Neuron Burden (UMN -B): The UMN- B at screening will be calculated by 
assessing  five bilateral deep tendon reflexes on a scale of 0-4, as well as  three  pathological 
reflexes (bilateral Hoffman and Babinski signs, and jaw jerk) 0 or 1, for a total possible score of  
45. Subjects  screening for the imaging group with scores of 25 or more may be considered 
eligible.  
5.2.2 Subject Exclusion Criteria   
 
Study subjects meeting any of the following criteria during screening evaluations will be 
excluded from entry into the study: 
1- Abnormal liver function defined as AST and/or ALT > 3 times the upper limit of the 
normal. 
2- Renal insufficiency as defined by a serum creatinine > 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. 
3- The presence of unstable psychiatric disease, cognitive impairment, or dementia that would impair ability of the participant to provide informed consent, according to PI judgment. 
4- Clinically significant unstable medical condition (other than ALS) that would pose a risk to the participant if they were to participate in the study.   
5- History of HIV, clinically significant chronic hepatitis, or other active infection.  
6- Active participation in another ALS clinical trial within 30 days of the Screening Visit  
Study subjects  in the Imaging group meeting any of the additional following criteria during 
screening evaluations will be excluded from entry into the study: 
1- Exposure to immunomodulatory medications 
within 30 days of the Screening Visit.  
2- Any contraindication to undergo MRI studies such as  
a. History of a cardiac pacemaker or pacemaker wires  
b. Metallic particles in the body  
c. Vascular clips in the head  
d. Prosthetic heart valves  
e. Claustrophobia 
3- Radiation exposure that exceeds the site’s current guidelines

Page 27 of 67 4- Current use of tobacco products including cigarettes, cigars, snuff and chewing tobacco, 
or nicotine replacement products such as gum or patch. 
5- Current use of medications / treatments under investigation in ALS clinical trials or use 
of “off-label” medications for ALS as determined by the clinical judgment of the 
principal investigator.  
5.3 Withdrawal 
A study subject will be discontinued from participation in the study if:  
• Any clinical AE , laboratory abnormality, concurrent illness, or other medical condition or 
situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best 
interest of the subject.  
• The participant meets any exclusion criteria (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) . 
 
Subjects are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request. 
5.3.1 Handling of Withdrawals  
A subject may choose to discontinue participation in the study at any time.  Subjects who 
permanently discontinue study drug should complete early study drug termination procedures per 
protocol.  The subject should then return any unused study drug and will be asked to return to the study site for a final safety visit. At that visit, the subject will be asked to have a final telephone 
call 28 days (+ 5 days) after taking their last dose of study drug.  
5.3.2 Termination of Study  
This study may be prematurely terminated if, in the opinion of the PIs, there is sufficient 
reasonable cause.   
 
Circumstances that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to: 
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subjects.  
• Enrollment is unsatisfactory.  
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.  
• Data are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable.

6.3 Mo
dification of Study Intervention/Investig ation al Product for a Subject  
Any dosage adjustment, including the reason for and dates of adjustment, will be documented in the CRF for each subject requiring this manipulation. The PIs or licensed physician Sub-
Investigator  may reduce the dosage of study drug or discontinue the study drug in its entirety for 
AEs thought to be related to the study drug or for other reason during the trial (the reason for, and dates of suspension or dose reduction must be documented).  If the AE is mild or moderate, 
the dosage may be reduced until the event improves.  The P Is may then choose to resume the 
higher dosage or maintain the subject at a reduced dosage. The option to continue with administration by IV only or inhalation only is allowable. 
 
If the event is serious or life threatening, and deemed to be definitely drug related, the study drug will be discontinued immediately. Study subjects must remain off the study drug permanently. Subjects may not resume study drug.  All AEs will be followed to resolution.

Page 31 of 67 6.3.1. Dosage Discontinuation 
Reasons for discontinuation of study medication may include an AE, PI recommendation, 
protocol deviation, loss- to-follow-up, patient request, or patient death.   
 
Study subjects who discontinue study drug prematurely (early termination from study) will be 
encouraged to return for a Final Safety Visit and participate in a Follow -Up Telephone Call 28 
days (+ 5 days) after the last dose of study drug.  
6.4 Accountability Procedures   
Subjects will be provided with a drug diary at  each time point when drug for inhalation is 
dispensed (baseline, week 7, and week 15 for the core study, and week 23, week 30, and week 38 
for the extension phase ). Subjects will be instructed to return all drug for inhalation consumed 
and remaining, as well as a completed diary, at weeks 7, 15, 23, 30, 37, and 47. R econciliation of 
drug consumed  and drug remaining will be logged on the drug dispensing and return log , signed 
and dated.  Any discrepancies noted will be investigated, resolved, and documented prior to  
return or destruction of unused study drug.  Drug destroyed on site will be documented in the study files.  
6.5 Assessment of Subject Compliance  
Subjects will be instructed to return empt y study medication containers at weeks 7, 15, 23, 30, 
37, and 47.  S ite personnel will review returned study medication to determine compliance.   
6.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Throughout the study, the subject  may be prescribed concomitant medications or treatments 
deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care provided that the medications are licensed in the United States.  All concomitant medications and/or treatments received by a subject should 
be recorded on the appropriate source document and eCRF. 
6.6.1 Prohibited Medications and Contraindications  
Prohibited Medications 
Prohibited medications for subjects in the Imaging group are as follows:  
1- immunomodulatory medications  
2- nicotine replacement products such as gum or patch 
 
Additionally, subjects in the Biomarker group should wash from benzodiazepines and non-
steroidal anti- inflammatory medications one week prior to PET scan as these compounds would 
affect the results of the scan.

Pregnancy & Nursing Mothers 
There are no adequate and well -control led studies in pregnant women.   Subjects or partners of 
male sub jects should not become pregnant during the study or 3 months after stopping study 
drug.  If a female subject becomes pregnant, study treatment must be discontinued immediately. 
 
 
 
6.7 St
atistical considerations 
Sample size calculation was based on the primary outcomes of safety  and tolerability . With a 
sample size of 15 participants, we will have over a 90% chance of seeing at least one occurrence 
of any adverse event whose probability of occurrence is 15% or greater. Tolerability will be 
defined as the ability of subjects to complete the entire 24- week treatment portion of study. With 
15 par ticipants on active drug in this study, if 10 or more participants tolerate the drug , there is 
an 85% chance that the true tolerability among people with ALS is at least 75%.  Furthermore, if 
10 or more people tolerate the drug, there is only a 3% chance t hat the true tolerability will be as 
low as 40% in people with ALS. For people in the Biomarker group, primary outcomes will 
include changes in the ROI in the motor cortex as assessed by [11C] -PBR29 -PET. Our previous 
studies comparing mean PBR28 binding in the motor cortices in limb -onset ALS subjects (1.18 
units) with matching healthy volunteers (1.064 units) revealed 0.116 mean difference between the two groups, with 0.08 standard deviation in the ALS group. With 10 people in the Bioma rker 
group, the prob ability is 9 0 percent that the study will detect a treatment difference at a o ne-sided 
0.1 significance level  if the true difference is 0. 096 units.

The following safety  laboratory tests will be performed during the study: 
 
o Hematology with differential panel and urinalysis: complete blood count with differential 
(hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelet count, RBC indices, Total RBC, Total WBC, and WBC 
& differential)  
o Blood chemistry panel/Liver function tests (LFTs):  alanine aminotransferase (ALT 
(SGPT)), aspartate aminotransferase  (AST (SGOT)), albumin, alkaline phospha tase, 
bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, chloride, creatinine, glucose, magnesium, 
phosphate, potassium, sodium, total bilirubin and total protein  
o Urine human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) for women of childbearing potential 
(WOCBP) STAT quantitative serum hCG testing will also be performed prior to the 
MRI/PET scan for all WOCBP.  
 
Additional testing  may be ordered  if needed, to further assess an AE, or if there is any suspicion 
that a subject may be pregnant, throughout the course of the study. 
8.1.3 Physical Examination 
A physical examination will be performed and recorded .  T he following systems will be 
examined: head/neck, eyes, ears, nose/throat, cardiovascular, lungs, abdomen, musculoskeletal, 
central nervous system, extremities, and skin.

A neurological examination will be performed and recorded .   
8.1.5 Adverse Events  
AEs will be documented at each study visit, including the final telephone call 28 days after the 
last dose of study drug.  Information on adverse effects of study medication and on inter -current 
events will be determined at each visit by direct questioning of the subjects  and review of 
concomitant medications.  
8.1.6 ALSFRS -R 
The ALSFRS -R is a quickly administered (5 minutes) ordinal rating scale (ratings 0 to 4) used to 
determine subjects' assessment of their capability and independence in 12 functional activities.  
All 12 activities are relevant in ALS. Initial validity was established by documenting that in ALS patients, change in ALSFRS -R scores correlated with change in strength over time, was closely 
associated with quality of life measures, and predicted survival. The test -retest reliability is 
greater than 0.88 for all test items. The advantages of the ALSFRS -R are that the categories are 
relevant to ALS, it is a sensitive and reliable tool for assessing activities of daily living function 
in those with ALS, and it is quickly administered.  With appropriate training the ALSFRS -R can 
be administered with high inter -rater reliability and test-r etest reliability.  The ALSFRS -R can be 
administered by phone with good inter -rater and test -retest reliability.  The equivalency of phone 
versus in- person testing, and the equivalency of study subject versus caregiver responses have 
also recently been est ablished.   Therefore, if necessary, the ALSFRS -R may be given to the 
study subject over the phone.   
8.1.7 Pulmonary Function Testing  
Pulmonary Function Testing inc ludes Slow Vital Capacity (SVC).  
 
Slow Vital Capacity (SVC) : The vital capacity (VC) (percen t of predicted normal) will be 
determined, using the upright slow VC method. The VC can be measured using conventional 
spirometers that have had a calibration check prior to subject testing.  A printout from the 
spirometer of all VC trials will be retained .  Three VC trials are required for each testing session, 
however up to 5 trials may be performed if the variability between the highest and second 
highest VC is 10% or greater for the first 3 trials. Only the 3 best trials are recorded on the CRF.  
8.1.8  C- SSRS 
The US FDA recommends the use of a suicidality assessment instrument that maps to the 
Columbia Classification  Algorithm for Suicide Assessment (C -CASA)62. The C -CASA was 
developed to assist the FDA in coding suicidality data accumulated during the conduct of clinical  
 
RNS60 in ALS  
V 4.0 
1/29/2016 
Page 40 of 67 trials of antidepressant drugs. One such assessment instrument is the Columbia Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale (C -SSRS)63. The C -SSRS involves a series of probing questions to inquire about 
possible suicidal thinking and behavior. 
Only investigators who have been fully trained in the administration of the C -SSRS will assess 
subject suicidality. As part of training, investiga tors are prepared to respond to and manage 
instances in which patients express suicidal ideation  or exhibit suicidal behavior. 
At the Baseline Visit, the C -SSRS Baseline  version will be administered. This version is used to 
assess suicidality over the subject’s lifetime and specifically for the previous 6 month time 
period. 
At the Week 11, Week 23, Week 35, Week 47, and the Final Safety visit, as applicable, the Since 
Last Visit version of the C -SSRS will be administered. This version of the scale assesses 
suicidality since the subject’s last visit.

8.1.9  Upper Motor Neuron -Burden (UMN -B) 
 
The Penn Upper Motor Neuron- Burden (UMN -B) is the total number of pathological UMN signs 
on examination including pathologically brisk biceps, supinator, triceps, finger, knee and ankle reflexes, and extensor plantar responses assessed bilaterally and brisk facial and jaw jerks (9).  The scale is a combination of Ashworth, Reflexes, and Pseudobulbar Affect scale (Range score: 
0 to 32). 
 The UMN also includes scoring of the Center for Neurologic Study- Lability Scale (CNS -LS), a 
7-item self report scale that assesses pseudobulbar affect (PBA) by measuring the perceived 
frequency of PBA episodes (laughing or crying) and the Ashworth Spasticity Scale, a standard 
measure for spasticity that has been used in numerous ALS clinical trials to assess spasticity due to upper motor neuron dysfunction in ALS.  Data is generated from the clinical exam and scored 
from 1  to 5, the lowest score indicating normal tone and the highest extreme spasticity . 
8.1.10 Blood Biomark ers  
Subjects will also be asked to provide  blood sample s for biomarker analysis per Schedule of 
Activities . These blood samples will be stored in a sample repository.  These samples will be  
used for biomarker research.  All samples will be labeled with a code.  The code will not include 
any identifiable information.  Any analysis  performed on the se samples is for research purposes 
only.    
 
RNS60 in ALS  
V 4.0 
1/29/2016 
Page 41 of 67 Unused samples will remain in the biorepository for future ALS -related research. There is no 
scheduled date on which the samples will be destroyed.  Samples may be stored for research 
until they are used, damaged, decayed or otherwise unfit for analysis. Subjects have the option of declining participation in this portion of the study at any time by withdrawing their consent to have their sample used.  However, it will not be possible to destroy samples that may have 
already been used.   
8.1.11 Strength measurement (ATLIS)  
Changes in strength will be measured  using ATLIS ( Accurate Test of Limb Isometric Strength) , 
a non- invasive device that allows measurements of  isometric strength in 12  muscle groups of the 
arms and legs using a standard protocol  (elbow and knee flexion and extension, grip, and 
dorsiflexion). ATLIS consists of a  frame with metal uprights. A wireless load cell is attached to 
adjustable testing stations positioned on the frame. The load cell transmits data (peak force) to a laptop computer using wireless technology.  The General Hospital Corporat ion was granted a 
patent for this device by the US Patent Office ( Patent # 7,493,812  issued 2/24/09). This device is 
not FDA approved. 
8.1.12 Neuroimaging  
Subjects in the Imaging group will undergo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) / Positron 
Emission Tom ography ( PET) twice during the course of the study . MR-PET scanning will be 
performed simultaneously using the Siemens 3 Tesla TIM Trio whole -body MRI system with a 
head PET camera insert.  The goal of these scans is to measure activated microglia in study 
participants before treatment and after several weeks of treatment. The first scan will  occur 
between the Screening and the B aseline visits ( off treatment) , after subject eligibility has been 
confirmed by TSPO affinity binding assay. The second scan will occur between the Week 1 8 and 
Week 23 visits ( on treatment). Neuroimaging will be performed at the MGH Martinos Center for 
Biomedical Imaging .  Subjects will be asked to lie still in a supine position for the duration of the 
study, which will take approxima tely 90 min.

Page 42 of 67 9 SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS  
The AE definitions and reporting procedures provided in this protocol comply with all applicable 
regulations and ICH guidelines.  The PIs will carefully monitor each subject throughout the 
study for possible AEs.  All AEs will be documented on CRFs designed specifically for this 
purpose.  It is also important to report all AEs, especially those that result in permanent discontinuation of the investigational product being studied, whether serious or non-serious. 
9.1 Definitions of AEs, Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions & SAEs  
9.1.1 Adverse Event and Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions  
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
study, use of a drug product or device whether or not considered related to the drug product or 
device.  
 
Adverse drug reactions (ADR) are all noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product 
related to any dose.  The phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out.  Therefore, a subset of AEs  can be classified as 
suspected ADRs, if there is a causal relationship to the medicinal product.  Examples of AEs include: new conditions, worsening of pre -existing conditions, clinically 
significant abnormal physical examination signs (i.e. skin rash, pe ripheral edema, etc), or 
clinically significant abnormal test results (i.e. lab values or vital signs), with the exception of outcome measure results, which are not being recorded as AEs in this trial (they are being 
collected, but analyzed separately). St able chronic conditions (i.e., diabetes, arthritis) that are 
present prior to the start of the study and do not worsen during the trial are NOT considered AEs.  
Chronic conditions that occur more frequently (for intermittent conditions) or with greater severity, would be considered as worsened and therefore would be recorded as AEs . 
 AEs are generally detected in two ways:  
  
Clinical  symptoms reported by the subject or signs detected on examination. 
 
Ancillary Tests  abnormalities of vital signs, laboratory tests, and other diagnostic 
procedures (other than the outcome measures, the results of which are not being captured 
as AEs).  
 
RNS60 in ALS  
V 4.0 
1/29/2016 
Page 43 of 67  
For the purposes of this study, symptoms of progression/worsening of ALS, including ‘normal’ 
progression, will be recorded as AEs .     
 The following measures of disease progression will not be recorded as AEs even if they worsen 
(they are being recorded and analyzed separately): vital capacity results and ALSFRS -R results.  
 If discernible at the time of completing the AE log, a specific disease or syndrome rather than 
individual associated signs and symptoms should be identified by the PI and recorded on the AE 
log.  However, if an observed or reported sign, symptom, or clinically significant laboratory anomaly is not considered by the Site Investigator to be a component of a specific disease or syndrome, then it should be recorded as a separate AE on the AE log.  Clinically significant 
laboratory abnormalities, such as those that require intervention, are those that are identif ied as 
such by the PI. 
 
Subjects will be monitored for AEs from the time they sign consent until completion of their 
participation in the study (defined as death, consent withdrawal, loss to follow up, early study termination for other reasons or following completion of the entire study).   
9.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that meets any of the following 
criteria:  
1. Results in death. 
2. Is life threatening: that is, poses an immediate risk of death as the event occurred. 
a. This serious criterion applies if the study subject, in the view of the PI or Sponsor, 
is at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurs .  It does not apply if an AE 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
3. Requir es inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
a. Hospitalization for an elective procedure (including elective PEG tube/g -
tube/feeding tube placement) or a routinely scheduled treatment is not an SAE by this criterion because an elective or scheduled “procedure” or a “treatment” is not 
an untoward medical occurrence. 
4. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
a. This serious criterion applies if the “disability” caused by the reported AE results 
in a substantial dis ruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life 
functions. 
5. Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of the subject (whether the subject is male or female).   
 
RNS60 in ALS  
V 4.0 
1/29/2016 
Page 44 of 67 6. Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanen t impairment of a 
body function or permanent damage to a body structure. 
7. Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not 
require hospitalization may also be considered SAEs when, based upon appropriate 
medical jud gment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 An inpatient hospital admission in the absence of a precipitating, treatment -emergent, clinical 
AE may meet criteria for "seriousness" but is not an adverse experience, and will therefore, not 
be considered an SAE.  An example of this would include a social admission (subject admitted 
for other reasons than medical, e.g., lives far from the hospital, has no place to sleep). 
 The PI is responsible for classifying AEs as serious or non-serious. 
9.2 Assessment and Recording of Adverse Events  
The PIs will carefully monitor each subject throughout the study for possible AEs.  All AEs will 
be documented on CRFs designed specifically for this purpose.  All AEs will be collected and reported in the el ectronic data capture (EDC) system. The PIs shall promptly review all 
information relevant to the safety of the investigational product, including all SAEs.  Special attention will be paid to those that result in permanent discontinuation of the investigational product being studied, whether serious or non-serious. 
9.2.1 Assessment of Adverse Events  
At each visit (including telephone interviews), the subject will be asked if they have had  any 
problems or symptoms since their last visit in order to determine  the occurrence of AEs.   If the 
subject reports an AE, the Investigator will probe further to determine: 
1. Type of event  
2. Date of onset and resolution (duration) 
3. Severity (mild, moderate, severe)  
4. Seriousness (does the event meet the above definition for an S AE) 
5. Causality, relation to investigational product and disease 
6. Action taken regarding investigational product 
7. Outcome 
9.2.2 Relatedness of Adverse Event to Investigational Product 
The relationship of the AE to the investigational product should be specifie d by the PIs, using the 
following definitions: 
 
RNS60 in ALS  
V 4.0 
1/29/2016 
Page 45 of 67  
1.  Not Related:          Concomitant illness, accident or event with no reasonable 
association with treatment.  
 2.  Unlikely: The reaction has little or no temporal sequence from administration 
of the investigational product, and/or a more likely alternative 
etiology exists.  
 
3.  Possibly Related: The reaction follows a reasonably temporal sequence from 
administration of the investigational product and follows a known response pattern to the suspected investigational product; the reaction could have been produced by the investigational product 
or could have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or by 
other modes of therapy administered to the subject. (Suspected ADR)  
 
4.  Probably Related: The reaction  follows a reasonably temporal sequence from 
administration of investigational product; is confirmed by 
discontinuation of the investigational product or by re -challenge; 
and cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clin ical state. (Suspected ADR)  
 5.  Definitely Related:  The reaction follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of investigational product; that follows a known or 
expected response pattern to the investigational product; and that is confirmed  by improvement on stopping or reducing the dosage of 
the investigational product, and reappearance of the reaction on repeated exposure. (Suspected ADR)  
9.2.3 Recording of Adverse Events  
All clinical adverse events are recorded in the Adverse Event (AE) L og in the subject’s study 
binder. Study staff  should fill out the AE Log and enter the AE information into the EDC system 
within 48 hours of the site learning of a new AE or receiving an update on an existing AE.    Entries on the AE Log (and into the EDC)  will include the following: name and severity of the 
event, the date of onset, the date of resolution, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and primary outcome of event.

Page 46 of 67 10 SAFETY MONITORING  
10.1 Safety Monitoring  
The study PIs will review safety data throughout the trial and may stop the trial for safety if they 
determine that there is a significant difference in the rate of a particular adverse event that would 
indicate a risk that is greater than the possible benefit of the study drug.    
 Unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others including adverse events will be reported to the Partners Human Research Committee (PHRC) in accordance with PHRC unanticipated problems including AEs  reporting guidelines.

1. Capture of clinical and research data from neuro logic patients for individual projects in a 
structured and secure system;  
2. Aggregating and sharing uniform, deidentified and/or anonymized datasets for secondary 
analyses.  
11.1 ROLE OF DATA MANAGEMENT  
Data Management (DM) is  responsible for  the development, execution and supervision of plans, 
policies, programs, and practices that control, protect, deliver, and enhance the value of data and 
information assets.  
 
All data will be managed in compliance with applicable Sponsor and regulatory requirements. 
Site p ersonnel will collect, transcribe, correct, and transmit the data onto source documents, Case 
Report Forms  (CRFs ), and/or other forms used to report, track and record clinical research data .  
DM is responsible for developing, testing, and managing clinical data management activities.  
11.1.1 Data Entry  and Checks  
The site personnel are instructed to enter information into the EDC . Data capture is the 
responsibility of the staff at the site under the supervision of the PIs.  During the study, the  PIs 
must maintain complete and accurate documentation for the study. The EDC provide  password 
protection.  An edit checking and data clarification process will be put in place to ensure 
accuracy of the data.  Logic and range checks as well as more sophisticated rules may be built 
into the eCRFs to provide immediate error checking of the data entered.  The system has the 
capability to  automatically create electronic queries for forms that  contain data that are out of 
range, out of window, missin g or not calculated correctly.   
11.1.2 Data Lock Process  
The platform  will have the ability to lock the  project -specific visits  to prevent any modification 
of data once the project  is closed.  Once this option is activated, every user will have Read -Only 
access to the data.

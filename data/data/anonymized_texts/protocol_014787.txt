Study planThe details of the assessments that will be performed during the study are 
summarized in the study flow diagram in Table 1.
After a 2-week run-in period, subjects will be followed during 4 treatment 
periods of 2 weeks each separated by 2 weeks washout period. The study 
will last approximately 18 weeks for each patient and a total of 10 clinic 
visits will be performed during the study, including a follow-up phone 
call/visit (see the flow chart below).
A pre-screening visit (V0) will be carried out in order to fully explain 
the study to potential participants, to obtain their written Informed 
Consent and to instruct them on screening visit procedures (such as 
medication restrictions).
A screening visit (V1) not more than 7 days after V0 will help establish 
the eligibility of subjects for inclusion in the study (including routine 
weight/height, hematology and blood chemistry, medical 
history/previous medications, serum and urine pregnancy tests for 
women of childbearing potential, physical examination, a 12-lead ECG, 
FEV 1 reversibility testing, ACQ assessment spirometry testing pre and 
post BD (to determine post-BD reversibility), vital signs, review of 
concomitant medications, adverse events and training on the use of 
pMDI inhalers. The subject will be dispensed the paper diary. This visit

IND No.: 133680 Date: 31Oct2017 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 9/86will be followed by a 14±2 days run-in period.
Treatments that are disallowed by the protocol are to be discontinued at 
Visit 1 including current ICS (as monotherapy or as combination 
ICS/LABA). The subjects will instead be prescribed a daily dose of 
inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (QVAR® 40 or 80µg/actuation) 
equipotent to their ICS and this treatment regimen should remain stable 
for the entire run-in period. Subjects will receive rescue medication 
(albuterol) with instructions for “on demand” use for the entire study 
period.
Subjects will be randomized at Visit 2 (V2), if all the eligibility criteria 
are confirmed, to one of the sequences comprising 4 out of 6 possible 
treatments: CHF 1531 pMDI (6, 12, 24 or 48µg daily) and placebo. The 
randomized subjects will be followed during 4 consecutive treatment 
periods of 2 weeks each, separated by 2-week washout intervals.
During each treatment period, a visit is scheduled on Day 1 and on Day 
14. At each study visit the patient will have pre-dose assessments (i.e. 
vital signs, urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential, 
ACQ questionnaire (at V2 only), concomitant medications, adverse 
events and paper diary dispensed/returned, 12-lead ECG, lung function 
testing) and will undergo pre-dose and 12 hours post-dose serial 
spirometry and serial serum potassium and blood glucose assessments. 
Post-dose lung function (FEV 1, FVC) will be evaluated and recorded at 
the following time points: 15, 30, 45 min and 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 
10h, 11.5h and 12h after study drug intake. Post-dose vital signs and 
12-lead ECG will be performed at 30 mins, 1h, 4h, 8h and 12h time-
points. Post-dose Serum Potassium and Blood Glucose will be 
measured at 1.5h, 3h, 5h, 7h and 11h time-points. 
At Visit 9, the subject will be discharged from the study after 
completion of the last assessment of the serial spirometry, Hematology 
and Blood chemistry, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, review of 
AEs, concomitant medications, return and accountability of background 
and study drug, return of subject diary, serum pregnancy test for 
women of childbearing potential.
A safety follow-up phone call (V10) will be performed by the 
investigator or designated staff no later than 1 week after the final visit 
(V9) or Early Termination Visit to check the status of unresolved AEs 
and to record any new AEs that may have occurred after V9 as well as 
related concomitant medications.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 12/86Sample size calculation The sample size has been calculated to evaluate the superiority of CHF 
1531 pMDI at different doses over placebo in terms of change from 
baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h normalized by time at Day 14. The calculation is 
based on simulations.
A total of 51 evaluable subjects will provide 96% power to detect a mean 
difference of 200 mL between each dose of CHF 1531 pMDI and placebo 
at a two-sided significance level of 0.0125, assuming a within-subject 
standard deviation of 180mL.
Since four dose levels will be tested, the Edwards and Berry method will be 
used to control the family-wise Type I error rate at the 0.05 (two-sided) 
level. In the sample size calculation, the Bonferroni adjustment of the 
significance level has been taken into account (0.0125 = 0.05/4). This will 
ensure the required power for each test, since the Edwards and Berry 
method is uniformly more powerful than the Bonferroni procedure.
Considering a non-evaluable rate of 15%, a total of approximately 60 
subjects (5 subjects for each of the 12 treatment sequences) will be 
randomized.
Statistical methodsPrimary efficacy variable
Change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h normalized by time at Day 14 will 
be analyzed using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model including 
treatment, period and patient as fixed effects and baseline (average of the 
pre-dose FEV 1 measurements on Day 1 of each treatment period) as a 
covariate. The adjusted means in each treatment group, the adjusted mean 
difference between treatments and their 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) at 
Day 14 will be estimated by the model. The CIs and the p-values of the 
comparisons between each dose of FF pMDI and placebo will be adjusted 
for multiplicity. The adjustment will be based on the parametric simulation 
method by Edwards and Berry. At each dose level, the superiority of CHF 
1531 pMDI over placebo will be demonstrated by a statistically significant 
difference (adjusted p-value < 0.05) favoring CHF 1531 pMDI.
All the other comparisons between treatments will be performed as 
secondary efficacy analyzes with no multiplicity adjustment.
Secondary efficacy variables
No multiplicity adjustment will be performed in the secondary efficacy 
analyzes.
Change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h normalized by time at Day 1, 
change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-4h normalized by time and in 
FEV 1 peak 0-4h at Day 1 and Day 14 and change from baseline in pre-
dose morning FEV 1 at Day 14 will be analyzed using the same model 
as for the primary efficacy variable.
Change from baseline in FVC AUC 0-12h normalized by time, in FVC 
AUC 0-4h normalized by time  and in FVC peak 0-4h at Day 1 and Day 14 
and change from baseline in pre-dose morning FVC at Day 14 will be 
analyzed using a similar model as the one used for the primary 
efficacy analysis.

event. Pre-treatment adverse events will be listed only.
The number of TEAEs and the number and percentage of subjects who 
experienced at least one TEAE will be presented by treatment for all AEs, 
ADRs, serious AEs, serious ADRs, severe AEs, AEs leading to study 
discontinuation and AEs leading to death. Summaries will be presented

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) currently ranks as the 4th leading cause of 
death in the world, and is expected to be in 3rd place by 2020.[1] COPD is both a preventable and 
treatable disease that is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation that 
is due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure to noxious 
particles or gases (e.g. cigarette smoke, biodiesel fumes).  A mixtures of lung abnormalities are 
characteristic of COPD, including small airway and parenchymal disease (obstructive bronchiolitis; 
emphysema), with variable contributions in any given patient.[2]
The NHANES III national survey estimated the U.S. prevalence of COPD to be 10.2% to 20.9% 
based on whether pre- or post-bronchodilator values were used and which diagnostic criterion 
(fixed ratio or lower limit of normal {LLN}) was applied.[3] COPD most often occurs in people 45 
years of age and older who have a history of smoking (current or former smokers). While not 
everybody who smokes gets COPD, approximately 80-90% of the individuals who have COPD 
have smoked.[4]
Smoking cessation can have the greatest influence on stopping the progression of COPD, as well as 
increasing survival and reducing morbidity.[5] However, long-term quit success rate rarely exceed 
25%.[2][6]
Existing 
pharmacologic therapy is used to improve airflow, symptoms, exercise capacity, health 
status, and reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations in stable COPD. To date, there is no 
conclusive evidence that any available pharmacotherapy COPD modifies the long-term decline in 
lung function.  The mainstays of pharmacotherapies for stable COPD are delivered via inhalation 
route, and consist of the following:
Short acting or long-acting bronchodilators (SABD; LABD) :
oShort acting and long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists (SABA; LABA) improve 
spirometric measures including FEV 1 by altering airway smooth muscle tone, and 
tend to reduce dynamic hyperinflation (Residual Lung Volume) at rest and during 
exercise, and improve exercise performance.
Adverse events include sinus tachycardia, rhythm disturbances, and 
hypokalemia. 
Despite prior concerns related to the use of LABAs in asthma, no association 
between the use of this class and loss of lung function and increased 
mortality has been reported in COPD.[7][8][9] 
oShort-acting 
and long-acting antimuscarinics (SAMA; LAMA). These drugs act 
mainly by blocking the bronchoconstrictor effects of acetylcholine on airway 
muscarinic receptor M3. Tiotropium is a LAMA that has been shown to improve 
lung function, symptoms, health status,[10] effectiveness of pulmonary 
rehabilitation,[11][12] and to reduce exacerbations and related hospitalizations[13] 
compared to placebo. 
Adverse 
event of this class of medications are mainly due to their 
anticholinergic activities, and include dry mouth, constipation, urinary 
retention and increased intraocular pressure.
oCombination Bronchodilators: Combining bronchodilators using a LABA and a 
LAMA increases FEV 1, albeit not to the full additive effect of each individual

(FLAME trial) in subjects with post-BD FEV 1 ≥25% and < 60% predicted, an 
mMRC score of ≥2, and a history of ≥1 exacerbation reported an 11% further 
reduction in COPD exacerbations with fixed combination of once daily indacaterol 
110µg + glycopyrronium 50µg (LABA+LAMA) compared to fixed combination 
twice daily fluticasone propionate 500µg + salmeterol 50µg (ICS+LABA).[14]  
Combining a SABA and a SAMA or a LABA and LAMA can be done using 
separate inhalers or using a single inhaler containing a fixed combination.  
Anti-inflammatory agents
oInhaled Corticosteroids (ICS) alone: The available evidence does not support a 
beneficial effect of ICS monotherapy in subjects with COPD.[15]ICS in 
combination with LABD: Most studies in subjects with mod-severe COPD and 
history of exacerbations found a beneficial effect of ICS+LABA fixed dose 
combination over either component alone in improving lung function, health status, 
and in reducing exacerbations.  Studies that evaluated withdrawal of ICS have 
yielded equivocal results.
High quality evidence has confirmed an increased rate of pneumonia, oral candidiasis, 
hoarseness and skin bruising with ICS treatment.[16][17][18][19][20] Factors associated 
with a higher risk for pneumonia on ICS include: current smokers, age ≥ 55 yrs, have a 
history of prior exacerbation or pneumonia, a BMI < 25 kg/m2, a poor MRC dyspnea grade, 
and/or severe airflow limitation.[21][22] A meta-analysis suggested that subjects with 
COPD 
with lower blood eosinophil counts (<2%) had more pneumonia events than did 
those with higher counts.[23]RCTs have reported variable outcomes regarding ICS effect on 
decreased bone mineral density (BMD)[24][25] and risk of fractures,[26] and observational 
studies suggest an increased risk of diabetes / poorly controlled diabetes,[27] 
cataracts,[28][29] and mycobacterial infections, including tuberculosis.[30]Triple 
Combination of 
ICS+LABA+LAMA: Available evidence from RCTs suggests that adding 
a LAMA to an ICS+LABA (or vice-versa) further improves lung function, PROs and 
reduces exacerbations risk.[31][32][33][34][35][36]  This step-up therapy can be achieved 
using various 
available approaches and products. More studies with this combination are 
needed to understand the benefits and risks and the target population.
Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, usually characterized by chronic airway inflammation. It is 
defined by variable symptoms of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and/or cough, and 
by variable expiratory flow limitation.  Variations over time and intensity are often triggered by 
factors such as exercise, environmental/occupational exposures, or viral respiratory infections.[37]  
As of 2014, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that the prevalence of asthma in US 
adults is 7.4%.[38]
The long-term goals of asthma management are to 1) achieve good symptom control, 2) to 
minimize future risk of exacerbations, 3) to minimize fixed airflow limitation and 4) to minimize 
side-effects of treatment. 
There are 3 types of asthma medications: Controllers, Relievers, and Add-ons.
Controller medications (e.g. ICS, ICS+LABA, LTRA, OCS): these are used for regular 
maintenance treatment. They reduce airway inflammation, control symptoms, and reduce

IND No.: 133680 Date: 31Oct2017 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 23/86future risks such as exacerbations and decline in lung function. Controller medication is 
adjusted up or down in a stepwise approach to achieve these 4 goals.[37]
oLABAs are drugs that have been associated with serious adverse asthma 
outcomes such as asthma-related hospitalization, need for intubation, and even 
death.[39][40] 
oIn February
 of 2010, the US FDA issued a re-labeling requirement for products 
containing LABAs to include a contraindication of LABA use without concomitant 
asthma-controller medication (e.g. ICS) and recommendations that LABAs be used 
only when necessary to achieve and maintain asthma control.[41][42] In April 2011, 
the FDA issued a requirement for all manufacturers of LABAs marketed in asthma 
in the US to conduct controlled clinical trials to assess the safety of a regimen of 
LABA+ICS vs ICS alone in asthma.[43]
oA recently completed trial in 11,679 asthmatics age ≥12 yrs (AUSTRI trial) reported 
a 21% lower risk of severe asthma exacerbation in the FP+SLM (fluticasone 
propionate + salmeterol xinafoate fixed-dose 100/50; 250/50 or 500/50µg bid via the 
DISKUS® dry powder inhaler; GSK) group vs the FP (fluticasone propionate 100, 
250 or 500µg bid via the DISKUS® dry powder inhaler; GSK) alone group and no 
asthma-related deaths.[44]  In a second trial in asthmatic children age 4-11yr 
(VESTRI trial) FP+SLM (100/50 or 250/50µg bid) was non-inferior to FP (100 or 
250µg bid) alone in the risk of serious asthma-related event (HR 1.28; [CI] 0.73-
2.27).[45] There are similar ongoing trials with other ICS+LABAs which have not 
reported yet. 
Relieve
r (rescue) medications (e.g. SABA): these are provided to all subjects for as-needed 
relief of breakthrough symptoms, including during worsening asthma or exacerbations. They 
are also recommended for short-term prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. 
Reducing and, ideally, eliminating the need for reliever treatment is both an important goal 
in asthma management and a measure of the success of asthma treatment.
Add-on therapies for subjects with severe asthma (e.g. LAMA, anti-IgE mab, anti-IL-5 
mab): Some subjects with severe asthma may continue to have exacerbations despite well 
controlled symptoms, and for subjects with ongoing symptoms, side-effects may be an issue 
if ICS doses continue to be stepped up. Add-on medications may be considered when 
subjects have persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite optimized treatment with 
high dose controller medications (usually a high dose ICS+LABA).
According to the GINA Report, 2016, once asthma pharmacotherapy is prescribed, decisions are 
based on a cycle of assessment, adjustment of treatment (step up / step down), and review of 
response as shown in this table:[37]

Chiesi Farmaceutici has patented MODULITE®, a technology for the development of pMDI as 
HFA solution formulations.  It currently  markets FOSTER®, a fixed dose combination of an 
ICS/LABA (beclomethasone dipropionate 100µg / formoterol fumarate 6µg) for the maintenance 
treatment of asthma (1-2 inhalations bid, and 1 inhalation prn, not to exceed 8 inhalations/day) and 
COPD (2 inhalations bid) in subjects 18 yrs and older.  The product was launched in Germany in 
2006 and is currently available in 35 countries worldwide including Russia and China, but not the 
US.  FOSTER® is dispensed as a spray-formulated product (pMDI, Modulite®) and as a dry powder 
for inhalation (DPI) by the NEXThaler® device, releasing extra-fine particles.[46]
Chiesi Limited (Manchester, UK) currently also markets an inhaled formulation of the LABA 
formoterol fumarate in 20 European countries and over 20 non-European countries and has been 
marketed since 2004 under the brand name ATIMOS® Modulite pressurized inhalation solution[47] 
and other trade names.  The product is approved in Europe for the long-term symptomatic treatment 
of persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma in subjects aged ≥12 years requiring regular bronchodilator 
therapy in combination with long-term anti-inflammatory therapy (inhaled and / or oral 
glucocorticoids); and for the relief of broncho-obstructive symptoms in subjects with COPD.  Each 
actuation of ATIMOS® delivers 12µg (ex-valve) of formoterol fumarate dihydrate via an HFA-134a 
pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI).  The recommended range of dosing is 24-48µg per day.  
This product is not FDA-approved and is not available for use in the US. 
Chiesi Farmaceutici is also developing a fixed dose triple combination of a ICS/LABA/LAMA 
(CHF 5993) with beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) + formoterol fumarate (FF) + 
glycopyrronium bromide (GB), and on Sep 29, 2016 became the first company to submit a 
marketing authorization application with this investigational product to the European Medicine 
Agency (EMEA) for the treatment of COPD.  The product is administered using a single 
pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI), specifically formulated to deliver extra-fine particles 
efficiently reaching both central and peripheral airways.
The submission of the EMEA dossier is based on the results of a large and comprehensive 
development program performed by Chiesi since 2009, which included 12 clinical studies involving 
more than 8,000 subjects.[48]
As pa
rt of the US development program of this fixed dose triple combination for COPD, a full 
characterization of the individual components (BDP, FF, GB) using the same inhaler device is 
required, including clinical dose-ranging studies at multiple doses, and using appropriate 
comparators for benchmarking purposes.
Since a dose-ranging study with CHF 1531 (HFA FF pMDI) has not been previously conducted, 
this study aims to characterize the dose-response to HFA FF pMDI using four doses: 3, 6, 12, 24µg 
(ex-valve) twice daily vs placebo in adult subjects with asthma.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 25/86Formoterol Fumarate HFA will not be indicated as monotherapy for asthma, however, the dose 
selection will be primarily based upon the results from this dose-ranging trial in asthmatics, as an 
asthma population is the most responsive to β2-agonist bronchodilation and is most likely to 
demonstrate a dose response. At the request of the FDA, an active comparator arm will be included, 
for benchmarking purposes.  Since FORADIL® AEOLIZER® is no longer marketed in the US, 
PERFOROMIST® (formoterol fumarate) Inhalation Solution (Mylan Specialty, L.P., Morgantown, 
WV, USA) will be used as the active comparator.
Formoterol Fumarate:
Description and Mechanism of Action:
Formoterol fumarate is a long-acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA). Inhaled formoterol 
fumarate acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. In vitro studies have shown that formoterol has 
more than 200-fold greater agonist activity at β2-receptors than at β1-receptors. Although β2-
receptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta1-receptors 
are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also β2-receptors in the human heart 
comprising 10%-50% of the total beta-adrenergic receptors. The precise function of these receptors 
has not been established, but they raise the possibility that even highly selective β2-agonists  may 
have cardiac effects.
The pharmacologic effects of β2-adrenoceptor  agonist drugs, including formoterol, are at least in 
part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the 
conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic 
AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of 
release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.[49]
Clinical Efficacy:[50][51]
A full description of the prescribing information and efficacy data for FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 
and PERFOROMIST®, can be found in their respective FDA-approved Product Information sheets.
FORADIL® AEROLIZER® (formoterol fumarate inhalation powder) was first approved by US 
FDA in Feb 2001 for the maintenance treatment of asthma and the prevention of bronchospasm in 
reversible obstructive airways disease, and for the acute prevention of exercise-induced 
bronchospasm (EIB), when administered on an occasional, as needed basis. In September 2001, a 
second FDA approval was obtained for the long term administration in the maintenance treatment 
of bronchoconstriction in patients with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.[52]  
Manufacturing of this product was discontinued in Oct 2015, and is no longer distributed in the US 
as of January 2016.[53] 
In Adults and Adolescents with Asthma:
Two doses of FA DPI 12 and 24µg bid have been compared to albuterol 180µg QID and to placebo 
in two (n=541; n=554) 12-week multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trials in 
adults and adolescents ≥12 years of age with mild-moderate asthma.  Both doses of FA DPI 
demonstrated statistically significant improvements vs placebo and albuterol in the primary 
endpoint (serial FEV 1) and in many secondary efficacy endpoints, including improved combined 
and nocturnal asthma symptom scores, fewer night-time awakenings, fewer nights in which subjects

(ΔFEV 1 ≥15%) after the 1st dose was within 5 min for FA DPI 12µg, 24µg, and albuterol. 
FA DPI 24µg twice daily did not provide any additional improvements in the primary or secondary 
endpoints compared to FA DPI 12µg twice daily, but serious asthma exacerbations occurred more 
commonly in the higher dose group.[54][55]
In COPD:
FA DPI was studied in two phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-center, 
parallel-group trials in a total of 1634 adult patients with COPD. These studies included 
approximately equal numbers of patients with and without baseline bronchodilator reversibility, 
(ΔFEV1 ≥ 15%) after inhalation of 200mcg of albuterol sulfate. A total of 405 patients received 
FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 12µg bid. Each trial compared FA DPI 12 and 24µg bid with placebo 
and an active control drug.[49] The active control drug was ipratropium bromide 40µg qid in Trial 
A[56] (
n = 780; 12 weeks) and slow-release theophylline (Theo-Dur 200 or 300mg bid) in  Trial 
B[57] (n = 854; 12 months). The results showed that FA DPI 12µg bid resulted in significantly 
greater 
bronchodilation (as measured by post-dose FEV 1 AUC 0-12h - the primary efficacy analysis) 
compared to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment in both trials, and after 12 months of treatment in 
the 12-month trial. Compared to FA-DPI 12µg bid, FA DPI 24µg bid did not provide any additional 
benefit on a variety of endpoints including FEV 1.
PERFOROMIST® (formoterol fumarate) Inhalation Solution (FFIS) received US FDA approval in 
May 2007[58] for the long-term, twice daily (morning and evening) administration in the 
maintenance treatment of bronchoconstriction in patients with COPD, including chronic bronchitis 
and emphysema. PERFOROMIST® Inhalation Solution is not indicated to treat acute deteriorations 
of COPD and is not indicated to treat asthma. As with all LABAs, PERFORMIST® is 
contraindicated in patients with asthma without use of a long-term asthma control medication. 
PERFOROMIST® Inhalation Solution is currently marketed in the US by Mylan Specialty L.P., 
Morgantown, WV.[59]
PERFOROMIST® 
was evaluated in one phase III, 12-week, double-blind, placebo- and active-
controlled, randomized, parallel-group, multi-center trial conducted in the United States. A total of 
351 adults with mod-severe COPD (≤ 30% %predFEV1 < 70%) were enrolled and 237 were 
randomized to FF IS 20µg or placebo, administered bid via a PARI-LC Plus® nebulizer with a 
PRONEB® Ultra compressor. Fifty eight percent (58%) of patients had bronchodilator reversibility, 
defined as a ≥10% increase in FEV 1 after inhalation of 2 actuations (180µg) of albuterol. FF IS 
20µg bid resulted in significantly greater post-dose bronchodilation (as measured by serial FEV 1 for 
12 hours post-dose, with 78% of subjects achieving a 15% increase from baseline FEV 1 following 
the first dose.  In these subjects, the median time to onset of bronchodilation, defined as 15% 
increase in FEV 1, was 11.7 minutes. When defined as an increase in FEV 1 of 12% and 200mL, the 
time to onset of bronchodilation was 13.1 minutes after dosing. The median time to peak 
bronchodilator effect was 2 hours after dosing.[60]
CHF 1531 (HFA FF pMDI) was especially designed to be equipotent to standard and established 
doses of FORADIL® AEROLIZER® (formoterol fumarate inhalation powder).[49][61]  As part of

IND No.: 133680 Date: 31Oct2017 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 27/86the clinical development plan for FOSTER® Pressurized Inhalation Solution, a bridging study 
(CT04) was conducted to test the equivalent efficacy and safety of a single dose CHF 1531 24µg, 
(12µg/actuation) to FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 24µg (FA DPI, 12µg/capsule) and to compare the 
efficacy of 12 and 24µg doses administered via CHF 1531.  The study followed a randomized, 
double-blind, double-dummy, cross-over design with 4 treatments (3 active and placebo) and 4 
treatment periods.[62] The equivalence limit was set at ± 0.2L for FEV1, because the upper limit of 
the normal variability of the FEV1 measurement is known to approximate this value.[63]  The 
primary efficacy variable was the 12-hour average FEV 1 following morning dosing (i.e. FEV 1 
AUC 0-12hr ÷ 12).
Fifty one (51) adult subjects with moderate-severe asthma (FEV 1 50-80% of predicted normal) were 
randomized and 46 were evaluated in the per protocol population. All three active treatments 
produced a greater mean 12h average FEV 1 when compared to placebo after first dose.  
Administration of FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 24µg and CHF 1531 24µg improved FEV 1 by similar 
amounts.  Conversely, the improvement was less marked after administration of CHF 1531 12µg. 
The maximum effect (i.e. peak FEV 1) was achieved at 2 hours after administration, regardless of the 
formulation used.
Maximum changes from baseline of FEV 1 after the administration of CHF 1531 24µg or 
FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 24µg were identical, and were higher than after administration of CHF 
1531 12µg. Maximum changes from baseline of FEV 1 after the placebo administration were lower 
than after each of the three active treatments. Onset of bronchodilation was comparable between 
CHF 1531 24µg and FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 24µg. The numbers of patients with a first FEV 1 
improvement ≥ 15% before 20 minutes were 36 with CHF 1531 24µg and 40 with FORADIL® 
AEROLIZER® 24µg. The duration of action appeared to be comparable between CHF 1531 24µg 
and FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 24µg. Conversely, the duration of action of CHF 1531 12µg was 
shorter than that of CHF 1531 24µg or FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 24µg.
Another randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled cross-over study (CT03) 
evaluated the bronchoprotective and bronchodilator effects of 12µg formoterol delivered via FF-
HFA pMDI (Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A, Parma, Italy) compared to FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 
12µg Inhalation powder (FA -DPI, 1 inhalation) and CFC FORADIL® inhaler (both by Novartis, 
Health consumer, Basel, Switzerland) in 38 adult subjects with mild-moderate asthma. The primary 
endpoint was methacholine challenge provocative dose required for 20% fall in the FEV 1 PD 20 90 
min post dose. The three formoterol formulations demonstrated significant (P ≤ 0.05) improvements 
in bronchoprotection compared to placebo and non-inferiority of the HFA preparation compared to 
the CFC and DPI preparations. Serum potassium, glucose and formoterol plasma profiles were 
comparable for the CFC, HFA and DPI devices.[64]

CONFIDENTIAL Page 28/86Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABA) increase the risk of asthma-related death.  All 
LABA are contraindicated in patients with asthma without use of a long-term asthma control 
medication.
Adverse reactions with β2-adrenergic receptor agonists including: angina, hypertension or 
hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, dry mouth, muscle cramps, 
palpitations, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, insomnia, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and 
metabolic acidosis.
FORADIL® AEROLIZER®:[49]
In Adults and Adolescents with Asthma:
Of the 
5,824 patients in multiple-dose controlled clinical trials, 1,985 were treated with FORADIL® 
AEROLIZER® at the recommended dose of 12µg bid.  TEADRs where the frequency was ≥1% in 
the FORADIL® bid group and where the rates in the FORADIL® group exceeded placebo included: 
viral infection, bronchitis, chest infection, dyspnea, chest pain, tremor, dizziness, insomnia, 
tonsillitis, rash, and dysphonia.
A 16-week, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, parallel-group trial enrolled 1568 patients 12 
years of age and older with mild-to-moderate asthma (%predFEV1 ≥40%) in three treatment 
groups: FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 12 and 24µg bid, and placebo. The trial’s primary endpoint was 
the incidence of serious asthma-related adverse events. Serious asthma exacerbations occurred in 3 
(0.6%) patients who received FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 12µg bid, 2 (0.4%) patients who received 
FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 24µg bid, and 1 (0.2%) patient who received placebo. The size of this 
trial was not adequate to precisely quantify the differences in serious asthma exacerbation rates 
between treatment groups. All serious asthma exacerbations resulted in hospitalizations. While 
there were no deaths in the trial, the duration and size of this trial were not adequate to quantify the 
rate of asthma-related death.
In adults with COPD: 
Of the 1634 patients in two pivotal multiple-dose COPD controlled trials, 405 were treated with 
FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 12µg bid. TEADRs where the frequency was ≥1% in the FORADIL® 
AEROLIZER® group and where the rates in the FORADIL® AEROLIZER® group exceeded 
placebo included: upper respiratory tract infection, back pain, pharyngitis, chest pain, sinusitis, 
fever, leg cramps, muscle cramps, anxiety, pruritis, increased sputum, and dry mouth.
Post-Marketing Experience:
In extensive worldwide marketing experience with FORADIL®, serious exacerbations of asthma, 
including some that have been fatal, have been reported. While most of these cases have been in 
patients with severe or acutely deteriorating asthma, a few have occurred in patients with less severe 
asthma. It is not possible to determine from these individual case reports whether FORADIL® 
AEROLIZER® contributed to the events: rare reports of anaphylactic reactions, including severe 
hypotension and angioedema, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, cough, rash, angina pectoris, cardiac 
arrhythmias, e.g. atrial fibrillation, ventricular extrasystoles, tachyarrhythmia,  QT prolonged, blood 
pressure increased (including hypertension).

In Adults with COPD:
Adverse reactions from the 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial where the frequency 
was ≥ 2% in the PERFOROMIST® Inhalation Solution group (n = 123) and where the rate in the 
PERFOROMIST® Inhalation Solution group exceeded the rate in the placebo group were: diarrhea, 
nausea, nasopharyngitis, dry mouth, vomiting, dizziness, and insomnia. 
Patients treated with PERFOROMIST® Inhalation Solution 20µg bid in a 52-week open-label trial 
(n = 463) did not experience an increase in specific clinically significant AEs above the number 
expected based on the medical condition and age of the patients.
Post-Marketing Experience:
The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of PERFOROMIST® 
Inhalation Solution. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain 
size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to 
drug exposure: Anaphylactic reactions, urticaria, angioedema (presenting as face, lip, tongue, eye, 
pharyngeal, or mouth edema), rash, and bronchospasm.
CHF 1531 (HFA FF pMDI): 
CT04: No serious adverse events occurred during the study. Overall, 58 treatment-emergent adverse 
events were reported by 32 patients. Of these, 21 AEs (36.2%) occurred with CHF 1531 24µg, 17 
AEs (29.3%) occurred with FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 2µg, 12 AEs (20.7%) occurred with CHF 
1531 12µg, and 8 AEs (13.8%) occurred with placebo. The most commonly reported adverse event 
was hand tremor, which was reported by 9 patients with CHF 1531 24µg (18.8%), by 7 patients 
with FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 24µg (14.3%), by 5 patients with CHF 1531 12µg (10.4%) and by 
2 patients with placebo (4.1%). All adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity. The 
relationship to the treatment was mostly "likely" with CHF 1531 24µg and mostly "possible" with 
FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 24µg. All adverse events resolved spontaneously except for one 
pneumopathy, one asthma exacerbation and one vagal syndrome, which led to patient withdrawal.
The evaluation of the effects of formoterol on the duration of QTc interval showed similar increases 
with CHF 1531 24µg and FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 24µg formulations, while the QTc interval 
remained close to baseline with CHF 1531 12µg and with placebo. The maximum changes from 
baseline were 29.08 msec for CHF 1531 24µg and 23.08 msec for FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 24µg 
as opposed to 16.06 msec and 15.02 msec for CHF 1531 12µg and placebo respectively. The 
maximum changes from baseline were mostly seen 2 hours after administration of CHF 1531 24µg 
or FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 24µg.
A moderate increase in heart rate was recorded 2 hours after administration of each of the three 
active treatments and this was slightly higher with CHF 1531 24µg and FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 
24µg formulations than with CHF 1531 12µg and placebo. The maximum changes from baseline 
were 11.21 bpm for CHF 1531 24µg and 11.88 bpm for FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 24µg as 
opposed to 9.52 bpm and 9.23 bpm for CHF 1531 12µg and placebo respectively.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 30/86A slight decrease in systolic blood pressure was seen between 2 hours and 4 hours post-dose and a 
slight decrease in diastolic blood pressure was seen between 1 and 2 hours post-dose regardless of 
the treatment. The maximum changes from baseline for SBP were 13.38 mmHg for CHF 1531 
24µg, 11.65 mmHg for FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 24µg, 12.33 mmHg with CHF 1531 12, and 
13.77 mmHg with placebo. The maximum changes from baseline for DBP were -11.8 mmHg for 
CHF 1531 24µg, -9.69 mmHg for FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 24µg, -10.2 mmHg for CHF 1531 
12µg and -11.2 mmHg for placebo. However, these modest variations were regarded as not 
clinically relevant.
As far as the biological safety is concerned, the three formoterol treatments lowered the serum 
potassium concentrations and increased glucose concentrations as expected. The maximum change 
in serum potassium from baseline reached -0.369 mmol/L with CHF 1531 24µg, and was 
-0.264 mmol/L for FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 24µg, -0.250 mmol/L for CHF 1531 12µg, and 
-0.239 mmol/L for placebo.  Blood glucose showed a similar peak in concentration 2 hours after 
administration of each of the three active treatments. The maximum change from baseline reached 
2.145 mmol/L with CHF 1531 24µg, and was 1.916 mmol/L for FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 24µg, 
1.860 mmol/L for CHF 1531 12µg, and 1.253 mmol/L for placebo.
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the Sponsor’s standard operation 
procedures and/or guidelines, the United States FDA regulations, the ICH GCP guidelines, the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and other local regulations, as applicable.
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES
2.1 Primary Objective(s)
To evaluate the efficacy of CHF 1531 pMDI by comparison with placebo in terms of acute 
bronchodilator effect (change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h normalized by time at Day 14).
2.2 Secondary Objective(s)
To evaluate the effect of CHF 1531 pMDI on other lung function parameters and clinical 
outcome measures.

6.1 Appearance and Content
Study drug 
Chiesi has patented MODULITE®, a technology for the development of pMDI as HFA solution 
formulations. Since the non-CFC propellant Norflurane (HFA-134a) has poor solvency properties, 
ethanol has been included in the formulation to enhance the solubility of the active ingredients (co-
solvent). Hydrochloric acid has been added as pH adjuster for the stabilisation of the formulation. 
All the included excipients are extensively used in pharmaceutical preparations.

6.2 Dosage and Administration 
6.2.1 Selection of doses in the study
FORADIL® AEROLIZER®:  The PK and PD effects of inhaled formoterol fumarate (FF) have 
been tested in healthy volunteers using single doses ranging from 12 to 120µg. A linear relationship 
was observed between urinary excretion of formoterol and decreases in serum potassium, increases 
in plasma glucose, and increases in heart rate.  Maximum increase in plasma potassium was 
observed 1-3h after peak formoterol plasma concentration and a mean max increase in HR at 6h 
post-dose.  Formoterol plasma concentrations were weakly correlated with increased HR and QTc 
duration. QTc prolongation were transient and returned to baseline within 12-24h post-dosing. 
In the asthma clinical development plan, 3 TEADRs showed dose ordering among tested doses of 6, 
12 and 24µg bid; tremor, dizziness and dysphonia. In two 12-week controlled trials with combined 
enrollment of 1095 patients 12 years of age and older, serious asthma exacerbations (acute 
worsening of asthma resulting in hospitalization) occurred more commonly with FORADIL® 
AEROLIZER® (FA DPI) 24µg bid than with the recommended dose of FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 
12µg bid, albuterol, or placebo.  In a 16-week, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, parallel-
group trial, patients who received either 24µg or 12µg bid doses of FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 
experienced more serious asthma exacerbations than patients who received placebo.
In the COPD clinical development plan, FA DPI 24µg bid did not provide any additional benefit on 
a variety of endpoints including FEV 1 compared to FA DPI 12µg bid.  Seven TEADRs showed 
dose ordering among tested doses of 12 and 24mcg administered twice daily; pharyngitis, fever, 
muscle cramps, increased sputum, dysphonia, myalgia, and tremor.
The US FDA-approved dosage of FORADIL® AEROLIZER® Inhalation Powder is 12µg bid.[49]
PERFOROMIST®:  Dose selection for the PERFORMIST® (FF IS) clinical program was based on 
two single-dose PD (bronchodilation) studies vs. FORADIL® AEROLIZER® (FA DPI) in patients 
with COPD.[68] 
DL-02: FEV 1 dose-response of FF IS 40 and 80µg and FA DPI 12 & 24µg.  Results failed to 
match either FF IS dose with the approved dose of FA DPI (12µg).
DL-057: was the primary dose-finding study in 47 subjects with mod-severe COPD 
(FEV 1/FVC ratio < 0.7 and 30% ≤ FEV 1 <70%).  The primary endpoint was FEV 1 AUC 0-12h. 
The doses evaluated were FF IS 2.5, 5, 10, 20 & 40µg vs FA DPI 12µg and PBO. The study 
Showed comparable BD effect between FF IS 20µg and FA DPI 12µg doses. The FF IS

CONFIDENTIAL Page 39/8612µg dose was taken into the Phase III program. The FF IS 10µg dose also matched the FA 
DPI 12µg dose but was not chosen because the statistical evaluation plan used a descending 
order approach from highest to lower FF IS dose.[69]
The US FDA-approved dosage of PERFOROMIST® Inhalation Solution is one 20µg/2mL vial 
every 12 hours.
CHF 1531 (HFA FF pMDI): The clinical equivalence of single dose CHF 1531 (HFA FF pMDI) 
6µg (2 X 6μg/actuation) to the once US-marketed formulation of FORADIL® AEROLIZER® 12μg 
Inhalation Powder (FA DPI) has been previously established in adult subjects with moderate to 
severe asthma.  Therefore, considering the above evidence and the FDA’s recommendations, this 
dose-ranging study will assess 4 doses of CHF 1531: (3, 6, 12, and 24µg bid) vs placebo. 
PERFOROMIST® Inhalation Solution will be used as the active comparator, at the same dose 
indicated for COPD.
6.2.2 Dosage
6.2.2.1 Background medication for run-in and treatment periods: 
Standardized Background ICS therapy – Open label:
QVAR® 40µg (HFA beclomethasone dipropionate, 40µg), Inhalation Aerosol. Each canister 
contains 120 actuations.
OR:

contains 120 actuations.
Both dose strengths of QVAR® will be provided by the study sponsor to be dispensed as 
prescribed by the investigator. The subjects will be prescribed a daily dose of (QVAR® 40 or 
80µg/actuation; 1-2 puffs bid) between 80 – 320µg, equipotent to their previous ICS (ref. inclusion 
criterion #6) and this treatment regimen should remain stable for the entire study period. The 
subject will be asked to not use any other ICS throughout the study. 
6.2.2.2 Randomized Treatment period:
An adequate number of inhalations from the Placebo inhalers will be performed to maintain a 
double blind design.  Randomized subjects will receive four of the six following Study Treatments 
according to the sequence assigned by the randomization list:
Treatment A: 
1 inhalation of CHF 1531 3µg pMDI plus 1 inhalation of CHF1531 matched placebo in the

6.2.3 Administration
6.2.3.1 : Background ICS medication kit for run-in period (from Visit 1 to Visit 2)
At screening visit 1 (Visit 1), the Investigator, or designee, will contact the IRT system to dispense 
to each eligible patient one background ICS medication kit (QVAR®). This kit will cover the 
needs in background ICS maintenance medication until Visit 2. 
At Visit 1 (screening visit), all subjects allowed to continue in the study, including those scheduled 
for V1.1 for a repeat Reversibility test, will receive the following standard ICS medication to cover 
the 2-week run-in period:
One commercial pack of  QVAR® 40 or 80µg containing Beclomethasone dipropionate HFA 
40 or 80µg per actuation, respectively, 120 actuations per canister 
The investigator will prescribe the subject QVAR® 40µg or QVAR® 80µg 1-2 puffs bid (80 – 
320µg/d) at an equipotent dose to replace the subject’s prior ICS. The 1st dose of QVAR® will be 
administered on-site at V1.  Subsequently, the subject will be instructed to discontinue the use of 
any other ICS for the duration of the study.
The recommended time of administration is between 8-10 am for morning dose and between 8-10 
pm for evening dose. 
All enrolled subjects will be instructed to:
1. take the same dose of QVAR®, daily, as prescribed on V1
2. refrain from taking their morning dose of QVAR® before reporting to the study site at V1.1 
and V2
3. return the QVAR® with the rest of their study drug and study material on the next visit.

randomized subject background ICS medication (QVAR®) at the same dose prescribed at V1, 
according to the following schedule: 
One commercial pack of QVAR® will be dispensed at V2, V4, V6 and V8 to each subject 
prescribed 1 puff bid of either QVAR® 40 or 80µg dose strength, OR
Two commercial packs of QVAR® will be dispensed at V2, V4, V6 and V8 to each subject 
prescribed 2 puffs bid of QVAR® 80µg dose strength.
The recommended time of administration is between 8-10 am for morning dose and between 8-10 
pm for evening dose. The morning dose of QVAR® will be administered on-site at V2-V9, 
immediately after study drug administration. The evening dose of QVAR® will be administered on-
site at V2-V8, immediately after all other procedures.
All randomized subjects will be instructed to:
1. take the same dose of QVAR®, daily, as prescribed on V2 until study completion at V9
2. refrain from taking their morning dose of QVAR® before reporting to the study site at each 
study visit
3. return QVAR® with the rest of their study drug and study material at each visit. 
Study Drug Administration (from V2 to V8):
At randomization visit (Visit 2), after the confirmation of the eligibility, the patient will be 
randomized to one of 12 treatment sequences. 
At Visit 2, 4, 6 and 8 the patient will receive 1 box with the randomized study drug. Each box will 
contain 2 actuators and 2 canisters for subjects randomized to Treatment Arms A to E, or 40 vials of 
PERFOROMIST® for subjects randomized to Treatment Arm F.

duration of the study.  On study visit days, study drug should not be taken before coming to 
the clinic.
6.2.3.3  Rescue medication
Asthma Rescue medication – Open label: 
Albuterol HFA (a short-acting β2-adrenergic  receptor agonist, or SABA):  Each canister contains 
200 actuations, at 90µg/actuation. At V1, the investigator will prescribe and supply through local 
procurement each subject with 1 canister of albuterol to use as asthma rescue treatment for the 
treatment of bronchospasm, as 1-2 inhalations q4-6 hours as needed (prn).  Albuterol may be re-
supplied by the investigator to the subject at subsequent visits during the study as needed, based on 
assessment of used and remaining doses.  The maximum dose allowed is 8 puffs per day.  If the 
subject’s needs exceed 4 puffs/day for ≥ 2 consecutive days during the run-in period, or uses ≥ 4 
puffs/day above their run-in average for ≥ 2 consecutive days during the treatment period, or uses ≥ 
8 puffs/day on any given day, he/she must contact the investigator.  A minimum period of 6 hours 
should elapse between the use of rescue medication and spirometric measurements.  Albuterol will 
not be provided by the study sponsor. 
6.2.4 Subject Training
At screening visit (V1), Investigator or designee will contact IRT system to dispense a pMDI 
training kit containing one placebo canister plus one actuator for each patient (see description in 
section 6.3.1).  With this kit, the subject will be instructed on how to use the pMDI according to the 
instructions for use. The training kits will be kept at the site by the Investigator (i.e., will not be 
dispensed to the subjects) and they will be used again at Visit 2 (randomization) in order to check 
again the proper use of the pMDI. If needed, training can be repeated at following clinical visits. 
The Investigator will instruct subjects on how to use QVAR® by reading together and showing the 
QVAR® leaflet to the subjects. At each visit, the morning administration of QVAR® will be closely 
supervised by the Investigator to check whether it is conducted in accordance with the leaflet 
instruction.
When the subject is assigned to Treatment Arm F, the Investigator or designee will instruct them on 
how to use PERFOROMIST® Inhalation Solution in a standard jet nebulizer machine connected to 
an air compressor, by reading together and showing the PERFOROMIST® patient leaflet to the 
subjects. At visits requiring the administration of PERFOROMIST®, the subjects will be closely 
supervised by the Investigator or designee to check that PERFORMIST® administration is 
conducted in accordance with the leaflet instruction.

IND No.: 133680 Date: 31Oct2017 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 44/866.5 Treatment allocation
An Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system will be used at each visit (from pre-screening to 
follow-up call) to record patient status.  Patient number will be centrally assigned, through the IRT, 
during the pre-screening visit (Visit 0). 
The Investigator, or designee, at the sites will call the IRT system to screen, randomize subjects and 
assign treatment kits according to the sequence described in the randomization list.  The 
randomization list will be prepared by a specialised external provider and the whole study team, the 
investigators and the subjects will be blind to sequence assignment.  Subjects will be randomized to 
one of the 12 possible treatment sequences, according to a balanced incomplete block 
randomization scheme.
6.6 Treatment Code
Study drug will be packaged and uniquely numbered. Each primary packaging in the medication kit 
will have a numbered label that matches the kit number on the label of the outside packaging. The 
IRT will be used to assign both initial and subsequent kits in order to have an inventory control and 
subject dosing tracking. The IRT will also maintain quantities, kit numbers, drug types, batch/code 
numbers, expiration dates and do not dispense after these dates. The IRT will monitor inventory 
levels at all sites and manage the study drug re-supply. The IRT will also track subject screen 
failures and discontinuations from the study.
The medication list will be provided to the labeling facility but will not be available to subjects, 
Investigators, monitors or employees of the center involved in the management of the trial before 
unblinding of the data, unless in case of emergency.  The Sponsor’s clinical team will also be 
blinded during the study as they will not have direct access to the randomization list nor to the 
medication list.
In case of emergency, unblinding of the study treatment code will be done through IRT. The 
treatment group will be disclosed and confirmation will follow (by fax and/or notification email). 
The IRT will be designed to send a confirmation (by fax and/or notification email) to the site for 
every transaction performed by the Investigators. The Investigator will be provided with username 
and password for randomization purposes and separate username and password to unblind the study 
drug in case of emergency situation, where he/she considers essential to know what study treatment 
the subject was taking. The IRT will promptly notify the Sponsor and the Clinical Monitor 
whenever a treatment code is unblinded. 
Users from Chiesi Global Pharmacovigilance will have their own passwords to unblind subjects in 
case of SUSARs to be reported to the competent Regulatory Authorities and IRB. 
The subject will be provided with a card with the phone numbers of Hospital site and Investigator to 
be called in case of emergency.
6.7 Treatment compliance
Compliance will be evaluated on the basis of the information recorded daily by the subject on the 
diary as well as the information recorded in the eCRF during the treatment visits.

 DRUG ED ADMINISTEROF % 100 DOSES SCHEDULEDOF NUMBER TOTAL DOSES ED ADMINISTEROF NUMBER TOTAL 
The total number of scheduled doses will be calculated on the basis of the extent (days) of exposure 
of each subject. A range 65-135 % will be taken into account for a satisfactory level of compliance.
Subjects with compliance level less than 75% will receive additional coaching during study visits 2 
to 8.
6.8 Drug Storage 
The Pharmacist/Investigator will be responsible for the safe storage of all medications assigned to 
this study, in a secure place with restricted access, and maintained within the appropriate ranges of 
temperature and humidity. 
Run-in and Background medication:
The boxes of QVAR® used as run-in and background medication must be stored not above 
25˚C (77°F) by Pharmacist/Investigator at the study site and by subjects at home. 
Study drug for randomized treatment period:
CHF 1531 pMDI treatment kits and matched placebo must be stored between 2°C (36˚F) and 
8°C (46˚F) by the Investigator/Pharmacist at site. At the time of drug intake at site, the study 
drug should be removed from the refrigerator and the canister should be taken out of the 
mouthpiece and warmed with the hands for few minutes before administration to the patient. 
The canister should never be warmed by artificial means. The patient should never inhale a 
cold study drug .
Once delivered to subjects, the treatment kits must be stored at ambient temperature (not above 
25˚C [77˚F]) at home .  At this temperature condition, the actual use-by-date of the treatment 
kits will be three months (90 days). Therefore, the Pharmacist/Investigator at the hospital must 
write the use-by-date on the kit labels once the kits are removed from the refrigerator, before 
assigning to the subjects.
PERFOROMIST® treatment kits must be stored in a refrigerator, between 2°C (36˚F) to 8°C 
(46˚F). Once delivered to subjects, the treatment kits must be stored at home, between 2°C 
(36˚F) to 25˚C [77˚F]) for up to 3 months. 
Medication for training:
The pMDI training kits must be stored between 2°C (36˚F) and 8°C (46˚F) by the 
Investigator/Pharmacist at the site. At the time of the training, the training medication should be 
removed from the refrigerator and the canister should be taken out of the mouthpiece and 
warmed with the hands for few minutes before administration to the patient. The canister

CONFIDENTIAL Page 46/86should never be warmed by artificial means. The patient should never inhale a cold 
medication.
After usage, the training kit must be stored at room temperature (not above 25ºC [77˚F]) at the 
study sites.  At this temperature condition the actual use-by-date of the training kits will be 
three months (90 days) from the date of removal from refrigerator. The Pharmacist/Investigator 
at the hospital must write the use-by-date on the kit labels once the kits are removed from the 
refrigerator, before assigning to the subjects.
The site must check the Min/Max temperatures once daily for adequate storage conditions for the 
kits.  The Min/Max temperatures must be recorded in a dedicated temperature tracking form. Any 
deviation to the requirement for storage will be promptly reported and the Sponsor shall assess if 
the affected study drugs can still be used.
6.9 Drug Accountability
The Investigator, or the designated/authorized representative, is responsible for the management of 
all study drug(s). Study drugs that should be stored in a locked, secure storage facility with access 
limited to those individuals authorized to dispense the study drugs.
An inventory will be maintained by the Investigator or pharmacist (or other designated individual), 
to include a signed account of all the study drug(s) received, dispensed and returned by each subject 
during the trial.   At the conclusion or termination of the study, the Investigator or the pharmacist 
shall conduct and document a final drug supply (used and unused) inventory. An explanation will 
be given for any discrepancies.  The study drugs supplied, used or unused, will be returned to the 
designated distribution center under Sponsor’s responsibility. Return and destruction will not occur 
until authorized by Chiesi.
6.10 Provision of additional care
At completion of subject’s study participation, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to prescribe the 
appropriate treatment for the subject or to restore their initial therapy or to refer them to their 
primary care physician.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 48/867.1.1 Visit 0 (Pre-screening visit)
A pre-screening visit will be carried out in order to identify eligible subjects and to fully explain the 
study.  The following procedures will take place:
- The written Informed Consent signed by the subject will be collected after the study has 
been fully explained by the investigator. The investigator or his/her designee should provide 
the subject ample time and opportunity to inquire about details of the trial and to decide 
whether or not to participate in the trial.
- Demographic data will be collected.
- Instructions will be given to the subject for the next screening visit (V1) such as 
concomitant medications to be withdrawn prior to the visit.
- As soon as the Informed Consent is signed, the investigator (or his/her designee) will connect 
to IRT to allocate a unique subject’s number.
Before discharge:
- A subject card with the Investigator’s contact details will be handed out to the subject.
- An appointment for the screening visit (V1) will be taken in the morning before 9:00 am, 
within 1 week. The appointment day may vary depending on the washout subject shall 
respect for the screening visit. Subjects will be instructed:
To fast overnight (at least 10 hours) for the next visit in order to perform blood 
sampling (only water is allowed);
Not to take albuterol and caffeinated substances, in the 6 hours preceding the next 
visit, and to abstain from taking the non-permitted medications listed in section 5.2, 
unless absolutely necessary;
7.1.2 Visit 1 (Screening visit / Week -2)
A screening visit will start in the morning (before 9:00 am) in order to identify eligible consenting 
subjects for the study.
If any of the washouts for non-permitted medications have not been respected, the visit needs to be 
re-scheduled within 2 days. Only one re-scheduling is allowed. If any of the relevant washouts is 
not respected again on the morning of the rescheduled visit, the subject will be discontinued and 
recorded in the IRT and eCRF as screen failure.
The following procedures will take place:
- Confirm that the diagnosis of asthma as defined in the GINA Report, 2016 has been 
documented for at least 1 year prior to screening.
- The ACQ questionnaire will be completed (see section 7.2.1).
- Weight and height will be recorded.
- Vitals signs [systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure] will be measured before 
spirometry, bronchodilator and background ICS medication (QVAR®) administration, after 
5 minutes of rest, in resting position (see section 7.2.2).
- A 12-lead ECG will be performed before spirometry, bronchodilator and run-in medication 
(QVAR®) administration, after 5 minutes of rest (see section 7.2.4). A subject will not be 
eligible in case of QTcF >450ms for males or QTcF >470ms for females, or in case of

which may impact the safety of the subject according to investigator’s judgment.
- A medical history and previous medications in the past 3 months must be collected.
- Concomitant medications taken by the subject will be recorded. Intake of non-permitted 
medication constitutes a non-eligibility criterion for enrollment in the study.
- A full physical examination will be performed including assessment for oral candidiasis.
- A urine pregnancy test in women with childbearing potential will be performed.
- A blood sample will be collected before albuterol administration, after an overnight fasting 
(at least 10h), for the assessments of (see section 7.2.8):
standard hematology and blood chemistry;
a serum -HCG test will be performed in women of childbearing potential;
The blood samples must be collected after vital signs and 12-lead ECG recording.
In case of non-interpretable data, another determination must be performed as soon as 
possible and prior to Visit 2 (randomization visit).
- Pre-bronchodilator spirometry will be carried out: to assess FEV 1, FVC (see section 7.2.5). 
To be eligible, FEV 1 must be ≥60% and <85% of the subject’s predicted normal value.
- Post-bronchodilator spirometry (reversibility) will be carried out within 30 minutes after 
intake of 4 puffs of albuterol HFA (90µg/actuation). To be eligible, the post-bronchodilator 
increase in FEV1 must be ≥12% and ≥200mL from subject’s pre-bronchodilator baseline. 
-If the reversibility criteria are not met at V1, this test can be performed once more before 
Visit 2 after an appropriate washout from bronchodilators. If this occurs, inclusion criteria 
# 3 and 4 must also be repeated and met on the same day, and before reversibility test is 
conducted.
- Any AE occurring since the signature of the Informed Consent will be assessed and 
recorded. In case of any clinically significant abnormality revealed during the physical 
examination or screening procedures, it will be recorded in the subject’s medical history, 
unless its start date is after the Informed Consent signature date. In this case, it will be 
recorded as an adverse event.
- Conduct a review of all Inclusion and Exclusion criteria. If the subject is not eligible, the 
investigator will access the IRT to record the status of the subject as a screen failure. At the 
discretion of the investigator, a subject who fails to meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria 
(screening failure) at V1 may be re-screened again, up to one additional time, after 1 month 
from the date of the initial screening failure.   A re-screened subject will be treated as a new 
subject.
- If the subject is eligible for entry into the run-in, he/she will be trained, with training kits 
containing placebo, to the proper use of pMDI (see section 6.2.4). The corresponding tear-
off label will be placed in the subject specific dispensation tracking form. 
- Subject will be instructed on how to daily record the medications intake (background ICS 
and rescue), and adverse events in the paper Diary (see section 7.2.6).
- The investigator will access IRT also in order to obtain the background ICS medication (one

7.1.5 Visit 4 (Period 2, Day 1), Visit 6 (Period 3, Day 1) and Visit 8 (Period 4, Day 1)
The Visit will start in the morning (before 9:00 am), and will begin the applicable period, Day 1.
If caffeine was ingested, or rescue albuterol was inhaled in the previous 6 hours, or the washout for 
non-permitted medications was not respected, or QVAR® was taken the morning of the visit (before 
spirometry), the visit needs to be re-scheduled to take place within 2 days. Only one re-scheduling 
is allowed. If any of these relevant washouts is not respected again on the morning of the re-
scheduled visit, the visit will be performed anyway and the time of the intake and the number of 
puffs of rescue medication or of the medication with washout not respected will be recorded in the 
eCRF.
The following pre-dose procedures will be performed:
- Study drug from the previous visit will be collected and reviewed for accountability. 
- Vitals signs [systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure] will be measured before 
spirometry, bronchodilator, background ICS medication (QVAR®) or study drug 
administration, after 5 minutes of rest, in resting position (see section 7.2.2).
- A 12-lead ECG will be performed before spirometry, bronchodilator, background ICS 
medication (QVAR®) or study drug administration, after 5 minutes of rest (see section 
7.2.4).

7.2 Investigations
7.2.1 ACQ Questionnaire
The Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) is a validated questionnaire that measures the adequacy 
of asthma control and change in asthma control which occurs either spontaneously or as a result of 
treatment. The ACQ consists of 7 items: six simple, self-administered questions referring to asthma 
control and rescue treatment usage with one week recall, and a seventh item consisting of the % 
predicted FEV 1 completed by clinic staff. Scoring uses a 7-point scale, with 0 indicating “totally 
controlled”  and 6 indicating “severely uncontrolled”. The ACQ score will be calculated as the 
average of all 7 items. A score of 0.0–0.75 is classified as well-controlled asthma; 0.75–1.5 as a 
grey zone; and >1.5 as poorly controlled asthma. The MCID is considered to be a change of 0.5 
unit.[65][70]  The ACQ will be completed on site, at Visit1 and Visit 2. Only subjects with an 
ACQ-7 score 
1.5 are eligible for randomization (the criteria must be met at screening and at the 
end of the run-in period).  The 7th item should be populated using the pre-BD FEV 1 at the visit 
when reversibility is met (V1 or V1.1) and the T-15 minutes FEV 1 assessment at V2.
The ACQ-7 is provided on paper and should be completed by the patient in a quiet place before the 
pulmonary function testing, only question 7 will be completed after the testing. The investigator (or 
designated site-personnel) should check that all items have been completed by the patient, but the 
response to each item should not be questioned. The scores will then be transcribed into the eCRF 
by the Investigator (or designated site personnel).
7.2.2 Vital Signs
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be measured after 5 min rest in resting position. The 
measurements will be done before morning dose of study drug and background ICS medication 
(QVAR®) at all visits,  and 30 mins, 1h, 4h, 8h and 12h post-dose (V2-V9). SBP and DBP has to 
be assessed twice with at least 2 minutes elapsing between the two measurements. The final SBP 
and DBP values to be considered are the means of the two measurements respectively. These 
measurements will be repeated at all visits at approximately the same time.
- Clinical Study Protocol -
Clinical Study Code: CCD-05993AA3-03 Version No.:3.0 
IND No.: 133680 Date: 31Oct2017 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 61/867.2.3 Physical Exam and assessment of oral candidiasis 
A full physical examination including an assessment of the presence/absence of oral candidiasis 
will be performed at V1, V9 and Early Termination. These examinations shall be completed before 
spirometry testing, administration of study drug, bronchodilator, or background ICS (QVAR®) 
medication.
Oropharyngeal candidiasis is a condition commonly associated with the use of ICS, and is cause by 
the Candida fungus. This side effect may be attributed to the topical effects of these medications on 
the oral mucosa. Generalized immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects of steroids are 
thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of candidiasis. Asthmatics who are using β-2 
agonists show a decreased salivary flow rate, which in turn can be associated with higher oral 
Candida counts. 
The subject’s mouth and throat will be visually inspected by the investigator at every study visit to 
look for the presence of characteristic-looking white lesions / oral thrush. If deemed necessary by 
the investigator to confirm the diagnosis, the suspected lesion should be swabbed/scraped with a 
sterile cotton and the tissue sample sent to a laboratory for microscopic and culture identification.  
Appropriate treatment of oropharyngeal thrush (e.g. using topical rinses and oral anti-fungal agents) 
can be prescribed at the discretion of the study investigator as deemed necessary throughout the 
study.
7.2.4 12-lead ECG
A 12-lead ECG will be performed before morning dose of study drug and background ICS 
medication (QVAR®) at all visits to verify the patient’s cardiac safety parameters and his/her 
eligibility. Subjects will be instructed to refrain from the intake of any caffeinated beverages or 
foods past midnight before each visit. At Visits 2-9, the ECG will be performed also at 30 min, 1h, 
4h, 8h and 12h after the morning dose of study drug. Prior to recording, the patient should be at rest 
for at least 5 minutes. A 10-second strip will be recorded in triplicate, at 30-sec intervals at each 
time-point.
Standard electrode placement will be used for these ECG, including placing the limb leads, dual 
snap electrodes will be used for the precordial leads. 
ECG will be evaluated and interpreted at a central laboratory and in case of any abnormality 
requiring urgent action ECG should be also evaluated on site (before sending to central laboratory).
The specific procedures for ECG recording, reading and transmission of the results will be provided 
to the investigator by the central laboratory.
QT interval corrections (QTc) will be done using the following formulae:
QTcF (Fridericia’s correction) = .  This will be done by both the centralized ECG service 𝑄𝑇
3𝑅𝑅
provider and by the on-site investigator to confirm if the subject meets the 
Inclusion/Exclusion criteria at V1, and for safety monitoring at subsequent visits.

IND No.: 133680 Date: 31Oct2017 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 62/86Digitalized 12-lead ECG will be measured in supine position after at least 5 min rest. ECGs will be 
digitally recorded and sent to a central laboratory for a high resolution digital manual measurement 
of the cardiac intervals and morphological changes (HR, PR, QRS, QTcF). ECG measurements will 
be performed by experienced technicians using digitization software with magnification of the ECG 
and point to point determination on the digitizing pad and by a centralized cardiologist.
ECGs with computerized protocol interpretation are considered normal if 
- 40 ≤ Heart rate ≤ 110bpm, 
- 120ms ≤ PR ≤ 210ms, 
- QRS ≤ 120ms.
For eligible subjects, QTcF values must be QTcF ≤ 450ms (for males) and ≤ 470ms (for females) 
(as per Exclusion Criterion 14).
In case of relevant ECG abnormalities, the inclusion of the patient will be judged by the 
investigator. For any doubts the Investigator may consult the study clinical monitor. The final 
decision for enrollment would be documented in the Medical File of the subject.
Clinically significant abnormalities at Visit 1 not due to a pre-existing condition or clinically 
significant changes at the following visits, in the medical opinion of the investigator, will be 
reported as adverse events in the eCRF.  A review and interpretation of all ECGs will be performed 
by the cardiologist of the central laboratory. Any discrepancy observed between the cardiologist and 
the investigator assessment will be discussed during the study as part of the on-going medical 
review activities. 
7.2.5 Pulmonary Function Test
All pulmonary function tests including FEV 1 and FVC will be performed in accordance with 
ATS/ERS spirometry criteria,[71] using standardized equipment provided by a Contract Research 
Organization. The specific procedures for centralized spirometry will be provided to the 
investigator by the centralized spirometry company. 
Pulmonary function measurements will be done with subjects sitting with the nose clipped after at 
least 10 minutes rest. Calibration of the spirometer must be performed by the same investigator or 
designee (to the extent possible) at each visit prior to any spirometry maneuvers and the reports 
must be kept with the source study documents. Throughout the study (after randomization), the 
clinic visits and the lung function measurements will start in the morning between 7:00 and 9:00 
a.m. preferably, approximately at the same time of the day for each patient.
The following parameters will be recorded at Visit 1-9 or Early Termination Visit:
Forced Expiratory Volume in the 1st second (FEV 1, L)
oThe volume exhaled during the first second of a forced expiratory maneuver starting 
from the level of total lung capacity. FEV 1 is decreased in obstructive lung diseases.
- Clinical Study Protocol -
Clinical Study Code: CCD-05993AA3-03 Version No.:3.0 
IND No.: 133680 Date: 31Oct2017 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 63/86Forced Vital Capacity (FVC, L)
oThe maximal volume of gas that can be exhaled from full inhalation by exhaling as 
forcefully and rapidly as possible.
Note: some additional standard parameters (for instance PEF, FEF 25-75% , or ratio FEV 1/FVC) will be 
assessed by the spirometer during the visit only for the investigator’s informational purpose.
Predicted normal value for FEV 1 will be calculated using the Third National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES III) reference equations.[72].
Subjects should be relaxed (shoulders down and relaxed) and asked to breathe regularly for several 
breaths until the end expiratory lung volume is stable (this usually requires at least three tidal 
maneuvers).  They are then urged to take a deep breath to TLC (Total Lung Capacity) with no 
hesitation. FEV 1 and FVC will be recorded at each clinic visit from a forced vital capacity 
maneuver.  The highest FVC and the highest FEV 1 (values corrected for BTPS) will be selected 
after examining the data from all of the usable spirograms, even if they do not come from the same 
maneuver.  An adequate test requires a minimum of 3 acceptable FVC maneuvers.  Acceptable 
repeatability is achieved when the difference between the largest and the next largest FEV 1 and 
FVC is ≤ 150mL (≤ 100mL when FVC is < 1L).[73] If these criteria are not met in 3 maneuvers, 
additional trials should be attempted, up to, but usually no more than 8.
In the rare event where a subject shows a progressive decline in FEV 1 or FVC with a 
cumulative drop exceeding 20% of start value, the test procedure should be terminated in the 
interest of patient safety.
The rescue medication (albuterol) must be withheld as much as possible for at least 6 hours prior to 
starting the pre-dose assessment at each visit. If the patient requires rescue medication within this 
timeframe, the visit should be rescheduled once within the next two days.
The background ICS medication (QVAR®) or the study drug should not be taken on the morning of 
the visit. If taken, the measurements should be deferred (i.e. the visit needs to be re-scheduled to 
take place within 2 days).
At Visit 1, airway reversibility will be assessed with spirometry in triplicate maneuvers (as 
described above) before and within 30 minutes after administration of 4 separate doses of albuterol 
HFA (90µg of albuterol/actuation, total dose 360µg) at 30-sec intervals. An increase in FEV 1 ≥12% 
of control and ≥200mL constitutes a positive bronchodilator response.[66]
At Visits 2-9, serial spirometry will be conducted at T-45 and T-15 minutes pre-morning dose and 
at 15, 30, 45 minutes, 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 10h, 11.5h and 12h post-morning dose. Time 
excursions for serial spirometry assessments should be avoided and kept to a minimum as follows: 
±5 min for assessments done pre-dose and during the first hour post-dose; ±10 min during hours 2-6 
and 11.5 – 12 post-dose; and ±15 min during hours 8-10 post-dose.

and FVC. Measurements will be taken at 15 and 45 min before the expected time of dosing (T-45 
and T-15). The subject will not be dosed.  
7.2.6 Subject Diaries
Using paper diary dispensed at visits V1 – V8, subjects will be instructed to: 
Enter a daily record of day-time and night-time Asthma Symptom Score (overall 
symptoms, cough, wheeze, chest tightness and breathlessness), as follows: 
Morning (night-time asthma symptom score):
0 No symptom
1 Mild: symptoms not causing awakening
2 Moderate: discomfort enough to cause awakenings
3 Severe: causing awakenings for most of the night / do not allow to sleep at all
Evening (daytime asthma symptom score):
0 No symptom
1 Mild: aware of symptoms which can be easily tolerated
2 Moderate: discomfort enough to cause interference with daily activity 
3 Severe: incapacitating with inability to work/take part in usual activity
Record the daily use of Asthma Rescue Medication as follows: the number of puffs taken 
during the night will be recorded each morning on awakening, while the number of puffs 
taken during the day will be recorded each evening, both before taking the study drug
Perform Peak Expiratory Flow rate (PEF, L/min) measurements twice daily, in triplicate, 
starting at V1 using a portable electronic peak flow meter. (Vitalograph asma-1™). Subjects 
will be educated on the purpose and technique of PEF home monitoring. Specific 
instructions for use will be made available to the subjects.  During each measurement 
session (morning or evening before the intake of the background ICS medication QVAR® or 
the study drug) the patient will perform 3 exhalations and will record the best measurement 
in the diary. Morning measurements should be done approximately between 7:00 am and 
9:00 am and evening measurements should be done approximately between 7:00 pm and 
9:00 pm. 
Enter twice daily (am and pm) the number of study drug doses taken.  
Record twice daily all doses of QVAR® background medication.
7.2.7 Serum Potassium and Glucose
β-adrenergic receptor agonist medications may produce significant hypokalemia in some subjects, 
possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular 
effects The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. β-
adrenergic receptor agonist medications may also produce transient hyperglycemia in some 
subjects.[59]  At V2-9, blood samples of about 2.5 mL will be collected for measuring serum 
potassium and glucose pre-dose and at 1.5, 3, 5, 7 and 11h post-dose (total blood volume = 15 
mL/Visit).

CONFIDENTIAL Page 65/867.2.8 Hematology, Chemistry, and Pregnancy Tests
Blood samples of about 12 mL will be collected for hematology and serum chemistry at Visit 1, 
Visit 9 and Early Termination in the morning, after an overnight fasting of at least 10 hours (only 
water is allowed during the night) and before administration of albuterol, QVAR® or study drug. 
The blood withdrawal should be performed after vital signs and 12-lead ECG recording. An 
additional blood sample will be collected for serum pregnancy test in women of childbearing 
potential at these Visits, and a urine pregnancy test will be performed at visits (V1-8).
The following evaluations will be performed using a central laboratory:
A hematology test: red blood cells count (RBC), white blood cells count (WBC) and 
differential, total hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), platelets count (PLT).
A serum chemistry test: blood urea nitrogen (BUN), cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine, 
uric acid, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Gamma-
glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT), total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatases, albumin, total 
proteins, glucose and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride). 
A serum pregnancy test (serum β-hCG) in women of child-bearing potential.
A urine pregnancy test using a commercial urine hCG pregnancy test strip. This test kit is 
used to obtain a quick (within a few minutes), visual, qualitative result for the early 
detection of pregnancy.
Blood collection and sample preparation will be performed according to procedures provided by the 
laboratory which will be in charge to transmit the results to the Investigator. In case of clinically 
significant abnormality, findings will be reported in the medical history (if occurred at V1), or as an 
Adverse Event (if occurred after V1).  
7.2.9 Asthma Action Plan and Handling of Asthma Exacerbations
The subject will be instructed to contact the site immediately if they experience a moderate or 
severe asthma exacerbation based on the following definitions:
Severe Asthma Exacerbation[74]
Severe asthma exacerbations are events that require urgent action on the part of the patient and 
physician to prevent a serious outcome, such as hospitalization or death from asthma. The definition 
of a severe asthma exacerbation for clinical trials should include at least one of the following:
Use of systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection), or an increase from a 
stable maintenance dose, for ≥ consecutive 3 days.
oFor consistency, courses of corticosteroids separated by 1 week or more should be 
treated as separate severe exacerbations.
A hospitalization or ER visit because of asthma, requiring systemic corticosteroids.
Moderate Asthma Exacerbation[75]
A moderate exacerbation is defined as ≥1 of criteria fulfilled and leading to a change in treatment*:
a) Nocturnal awakening(s) due to asthma requiring SABA for 2 consecutive nights 
- Clinical Study Protocol -
Clinical Study Code: CCD-05993AA3-03 Version No.:3.0 
IND No.: 133680 Date: 31Oct2017 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 66/86b) Increase from baseline in occasions of SABA use on 2 consecutive days (minimum increase: 
4 puffs/day)
c)≥20% decrease in am or pm PEF from respective baseline on ≥ 2 consecutive 
mornings/evenings or ≥20% decrease in FEV1 from baseline
d) Visit to the emergency room/trial site for asthma treatment not requiring systemic 
corticosteroids
Subjects who experience a severe asthma exacerbation will be instructed to visit the site as soon as 
possible for an Early Termination Visit and will be withdrawn permanently from the study.  
Appropriate medical management of all asthma exacerbations will be ensured by the study 
investigator with the aim to preserve the research subject’s well-being at all times. 
*A change in treatment should be reviewed with the subject for any non-permitted concomitant 
medication that may trigger Early Termination from the study.

10 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
10.1 Definitions
An Adverse Event  is “any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
- Clinical Study Protocol -
Clinical Study Code: CCD-05993AA3-03 Version No.:3.0 
IND No.: 133680 Date: 31Oct2017 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 67/86this treatment”.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
An Adverse Drug Reaction is an “untoward and unintended responses to an investigational 
medicinal product related to any dose administered”.
All adverse events judged by either the reporting Investigator or the Sponsor as having a reasonable 
causal relationship to a medicinal product qualify as adverse reactions. The expression “reasonable 
causal relationship” means to convey in general that there are facts (evidence) or arguments meant 
to suggest a causal relationship.  The definition covers also medication errors and uses outside what 
is foreseen in the protocol, including misuse and abuse of the product.
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)/Serious Adverse Drug Reaction is any untoward medical 
occurrence or effect that at any dose falls in one or more of the following categories:
- Results in death
Death is not an adverse event but an outcome. It is the cause of death that should be regarded as the 
adverse event. The only exception to this rule is “sudden death” where no cause has been 
established; in this latter instance, “sudden death” should be regarded as the adverse event and 
“fatal” as its reason for being serious.
- Is life-threatening
Life-threatening refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event 
(e.g., aplastic anaemia, acute renal failure, and anaphylaxis). The term does not refer to an event 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.
- Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Hospitalization refers to a situation whereby an AE is associated with unplanned overnight formal 
admission into hospital, usually for purpose of investigating and/or treating the AE. Hospitalization 
for the treatment of a medical condition that occurs on an “elective” or “scheduled” basis or for a 
pre-existing condition that did not worsen during the study should not necessarily be regarded as a 
AE. Complications that occur during the hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs 
hospitalization, the event is an SAE. Emergency room visits that do not result in a formal admission 
into hospital should be evaluated for one of the other seriousness criteria (e.g., life-threatening; 
persistent or significant disability or incapacity; medically significant).
- Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.
The term significant disability should be viewed as any situation whereby an AE has a clinically 
important effect on the subject’s physical or psychological well-being to the extent that the subject 
is unable to function normally.
- Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
-Is a medically significant adverse event
This criterion allows for any situations in which important adverse events/reactions that are not 
immediately life-threatening or do not result in death or hospitalization may jeopardise the subject’s 
health or may require intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes.
- Clinical Study Protocol -
Clinical Study Code: CCD-05993AA3-03 Version No.:3.0 
IND No.: 133680 Date: 31Oct2017 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 68/86Examples of such events are: intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding 
whether an event is serious because medically significant.  Any suspected transmission via a 
medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction
A Non-Serious Adverse Event/Non-Serious Adverse Drug Reaction is an adverse event or 
adverse drug reaction that does not meet the criteria listed above for a serious adverse event/serious 
adverse drug reaction.
10.2 Expectedness
An expected adverse reaction is an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is consistent 
with the applicable reference safety information (Investigator’s Brochure for CHF 1531 pMDI   or 
US-FDA approved Product Information for PERFOROMIST®), otherwise it is considered 
unexpected. 
Reports which add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, already 
documented serious adverse drug reaction constitute unexpected events. For example, an event 
more specific or more severe than described in the Investigator’s Brochure would be considered as 
“unexpected”. Examples of such events are: (a) acute renal failure as a labeled ADR with a 
subsequent new report of interstitial nephritis and (b) hepatitis with a first report of fulminant 
hepatitis.  In the event an exacerbation is interpreted as due to lack of efficacy, it should not be 
classified as drug related.
10.3 Intensity of Adverse Event
Each Adverse Event must be rated on a 3-point scale of increasing intensity:
Mild: The event causes a minor discomfort, or does not interfere with daily activity of the 
subject, or does not lead to either modification of test treatment dosage or establishment of a 
correcting treatment.
Moderate: The event perturbs the usual activity of the subject and is of a sufficient severity 
to make the subject uncomfortable. The event leads to a diminution of dosage of the test 
treatment, or a temporary interruption of its administration or to the establishment of a 
correcting treatment.
Severe:  The event prevents any usual routine activity of the subject and causes severe 
discomfort. It may be of such severity to cause the definitive interruption of test treatment.
10.4 Causality Assessment
The following “binary” decision choice will be used by the Investigator to describe the causality 
assessment:
Reasonable possibility of a relatedness
No reasonable possibility of relatedness
The expression “reasonable possibility of relatedness” is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments meant to suggest a causal relationship.

Clinical Study Code: CCD-05993AA3-03 Version No.:3.0 
IND No.: 133680 Date: 31Oct2017 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 69/86The Investigator will be asked to consider the following before reaching a decision on causality 
assessment:
Time relationship between study drug intake and event’s onset;
Dechallenge (did the event abate after stopping drug?);
Rechallenge (did the event reappear after reintroduction?);
Medical history;
Study drug(s);
Mechanism of action of the study drug;
Class effects;
Other treatments-concomitant or previous;
Withdrawal of study drug(s);
Lack of efficacy/worsening of existing condition;
Erroneous treatment with study drug (or concomitant);
Protocol related process.
10.5 Action taken with the study drug 
Dose not changed
Drug withdrawn
Drug interrupted
Not applicable
Unknown
10.6 Other actions taken
Specific therapy/medication
Concomitant procedure
Not applicable
10.7 Outcome
Each Adverse Event must be rated by choosing among:
Recovered/resolved
Recovering/resolving
Not recovered/not resolved
Recovered with sequelae/resolved with sequelae
Fatal
Unknown
10.8 Recording Adverse Events
All Adverse Events occurring during the course of the study must be documented in the Adverse 
Event page of the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). Moreover, if the Adverse Event is serious, 
the Serious Adverse Event Form must also be completed.   It is responsibility of the Investigator to 
collect all adverse events (both serious and non-serious) derived by spontaneous, unsolicited reports 
- Clinical Study Protocol -
Clinical Study Code: CCD-05993AA3-03 Version No.:3.0 
IND No.: 133680 Date: 31Oct2017 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 70/86of subjects, by observation and by routine open questionings.  The recording period for Adverse 
Events is the period starting from the Informed Consent signature until the subject’s study 
participation ends.
Clinically significant abnormalities detected at Visit 1 not due to a pre-existing condition or 
clinically significant changes at the following visits in the medical opinion of the investigator must 
be reported as adverse events in the eCRF.
If a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment meets the 
definition of an AE, then the AE eCRF page must be completed, as appropriate.  A diagnosis, if 
known, or clinical signs and symptoms if diagnosis is unknown, rather than the clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory finding, should be reported on AE eCRF page. If no diagnosis is known and 
clinical signs and symptoms are not present, then the abnormal finding should be recorded.
For pharmacovigilance purposes, all SAEs should be followed-up in order to elucidate as 
completely and practically as possible their nature and/or causality until resolution of all queries, 
clinical recovery is complete, laboratory results have returned to normal, stable condition is reached 
or the subject is lost to follow-up. Follow-up may therefore continue after the subject has left the 
study. In this case, the follow-up will continue with no timelines for related SAEs, while for 
unrelated SAEs the type and extent of follow-up undertaken will be determined for each individual 
case and will depend upon the nature (e.g. events with poor prognosis or which do not resolve), 
severity and medical significance of the event.
10.9 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Chiesi
The Investigator must report all Serious Adverse Events to the  Safety Contact 
listed below within 24 hours of awareness. The information must be sent by providing the 
completed Serious Adverse Event form. At a later date, the  Safety Contact will 
report all information to Chiesi Global Pharmacovigilance, the Clinical Project Manager and the 
Clinical Research Physician.

Reporting of SAEs from the investigator site is from the time of subject’s signature of 
Informed Consent and until the subject’s study participation ends. After this date, even if no 
active monitoring of subjects is required, SAEs occurring to a subject should be reported if 
the investigator becomes aware of them. 
Up to the closure of the site, SAE reports should be reported to the  Safety 
Contact. New serious adverse events occurring after the site is closed should be reported 
directly to the Chiesi Safety Contact.

IND No.: 133680 Date: 31Oct2017 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 71/8610.10 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Authorities/Ethics Committees/IRB
 The Sponsor or designated CRO will report adverse events to the regulatory authorities in 
compliance with the timelines and standards of reporting according to local regulations (Guidance 
for industry and Investigators-Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE studies, 
December 2012). All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs), which occur with 
the investigational medicinal product or marketed active comparator within or outside the 
concerned clinical trial, will be reported by the Sponsor or designated CRO to regulatory 
authorities, as required, as well as to the Investigators and Central IRB, if applicable, by 
MedWatch/CIOMS form. The Investigator (or Sponsor/CRO where required) must inform the IRB 
per Sponsor instruction upon receipt of the SUSAR notification. An IND and/or NDA Safety 
Report will be submitted to regulatory authorities unblinded. Participating Investigators and IRB 
will receive a blinded IND Safety Report, unless otherwise specified.  With regard to regulations in 
force for Pharmacovigilance, the Investigator must fulfil his/her obligation according to the law in 
force. 
10.11 General Notes
In case of death, a comprehensive narrative report of the case should be prepared by the 
Investigator and sent to the /Chiesi Safety Contact together with the Serious 
Adverse Event form, retaining a copy on site. 
If an autopsy is performed, copy of autopsy report should be actively sought by the 
Investigator and sent to the /Chiesi Safety Contact as soon as available, 
retaining a copy on site.
In case of pregnancy, the subject will be immediately withdrawn from the study and she will 
be followed with due diligence until the outcome of the pregnancy is known. The pregnancy 
must be reported by the investigator within 24 hours by fax/e-mail/via Monitor to the 
/Chiesi Safety Contact using the paper Pregnancy Report Form. The 
 Safety Contact will inform Chiesi of the pregnancy within one working day 
of being notified. 
The first two pages of the Pregnancy Report Form should be completed by the investigator 
with all the available information and sent to the /Chiesi Safety Contact. The 
third page will be completed as soon as the investigator has knowledge of the pregnancy 
outcome together with a follow-up of the first two pages, if necessary (e.g. an update in the 
medications received during pregnancy by the mother). If it meets the criteria for immediate 
classification of a SAE (e.g. spontaneous or therapeutic abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, 
congenital anomaly, birth defect) the Investigator should follow the procedure for reporting 
SAEs. 
If it is the partner, rather than the subject, who is found to be pregnant, the same procedure 
regarding pregnancy reporting is to be followed and the Pregnancy Report Form should be 
completed. 
If the pregnancy is discovered before taking any dose either of study drug, the background 
ICS, or the rescue medication, the pregnancy does not need to be reported; it is only required 
that the subject is immediately withdrawn from the study.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 72/8611 DATA MANAGEMENT
An electronic CRF (eCRF) will be filled-in by the Investigator and/or his/her designee. 
All subjects who will sign the Informed Consent will be entered into the database. For subjects who 
are screened but not randomized a minimum set of information is required: date of Informed 
Consent signed, demography, assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria when applicable, primary 
reason for not continuing, prior medications, adverse events and concomitant medications if any.
Questionnaire (ACQ) patient’s answers and daily diary will be databased.  Front-end edit checks 
will run at the time of data collection and back-end edit checks will be used by the Data Manager to 
check for discrepancies and to ensure consistency and completeness of the data. 
Medical history, Concomitant procedures and Adverse Events will be coded using the MedDRA 
dictionary; medications will be coded using the WHO Drug dictionary and Anatomical Therapeutic 
Chemical classification (ATC).  External data (IRT, spirometry, 12-Lead ECG, Central Laboratory) 
will be processed centrally and results will be sent electronically to the designated CRO.  After 
cleaning of data, a review meeting will be held to determine the occurrence of any protocol 
violation and to define the subject populations for the analysis. Once the database has been declared 
to be complete and accurate, it will be locked, the randomization codes will be opened and the 
planned statistical analysis will be performed. Only authorised and well-documented updates to the 
study data are possible after database lock. 
At the study conclusion, a complete copy of the study data will be created for archival purposes at 
Chiesi. The investigators will receive copies of the patient data for retention at the investigational 
sites.
12 STATISTICAL METHODS
12.1 Sample Size
The sample size has been calculated to evaluate the superiority of CHF 1531 pMDI at different 
doses over placebo in terms of change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h normalized by time at Day 
14. The calculation is based on simulations.
A total of 51 evaluable subjects will provide 96% power to detect a mean difference of 200 mL 
between each dose of CHF 1531 pMDI and placebo at a two-sided significance level of 0.0125, 
assuming a within-subject standard deviation of 180 mL.  Since four dose levels will be tested, the 
Edwards and Berry method[76]will be used to control the family-wise Type I error rate at the 0.05 
(two-sided) level. In the sample size calculation, the Bonferroni adjustment of the significance level 
has been taken into account (0.0125 = 0.05/4). This will ensure the required power for each test, 
since the Edwards and Berry[76] method is uniformly more powerful than the Bonferroni 
procedure.
Considering a non-evaluable rate of 15%, a total of approximately 60 subjects (5 subjects for each 
of the 12 treatment sequences) will be randomized.
12.2 Populations for analysis
Safety population: all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.
- Clinical Study Protocol -
Clinical Study Code: CCD-05993AA3-03 Version No.:3.0 
IND No.: 133680 Date: 31Oct2017 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 73/86Intention-to-Treat population (ITT): all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of 
the study drug and with at least one available evaluation of efficacy (primary or secondary 
efficacy variables) after the baseline.
Per-protocol population (PP): all subjects from the ITT population without any major 
protocol deviation (i.e., wrong inclusions, poor compliance, non-permitted medications). Exact 
definition of major protocol deviations will be discussed by the study team during the blind 
review of the data and described in the Data Review Report.
The inclusion in each population will be defined on a per-period basis.  Since the superiority of 
CHF 1531 pMDI at different doses over placebo will be tested, the primary efficacy analysis will be 
based on the ITT population. The primary efficacy analysis will be also performed on the PP 
population for sensitivity purposes.   The secondary efficacy variables will be analyzed in the ITT 
population.  The safety variables will be analyzed in the Safety population. 
In case of deviation between randomized treatment and treatment actually received, the treatment 
actually received will be used in the safety analyzes (i.e. an as-treated analysis will be performed).
12.3 Statistical analysis
A detailed statistical analysis plan will be described in a separate document. The plan might be 
reviewed and updated as a result of the blind review of the data and will be finalized before 
breaking the blind. 
12.3.1 Descriptive Statistics 
Descriptive statistics will be provided in summary tables by treatment group (except for baseline 
characteristics which will be provided overall) according to the type of variable summarized.  
Descriptive statistics for quantitative variables will include n (the number of non-missing values), 
mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum values.   Categorical variables will be summarized by 
using frequency count and percent distribution.
12.3.2 Missing data
If one of the spirometry measurements at T-45 min and T-15 min pre-dose is not available, then 
the non-missing measurement will be taken as the pre-dose value (corresponding to time 0 for 
the calculation of AUC). If no measurement is available, then the pre-dose value will be 
considered as missing.
In the calculation of AUC normalized by time for spirometry data, missing values will be 
replaced as follows:
oIf the pre-dose value is not available, the entire curve will be considered as missing;
oSingle, isolated missing values (not pre-dose or last value) will be replaced by linear 
interpolation using the adjacent values;
oIf the value at 12h post-dose is missing, it will be replaced by the value at 11.5h;
oIn case of two or more consecutive missing values or more than three missing values, the 
entire curve will be missing.

Clinical Study Code: CCD-05993AA3-03 Version No.:3.0 
IND No.: 133680 Date: 31Oct2017 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 74/86In case of rescue medication intake during the serial spirometry (from pre-dose to 12h post-
dose), all spirometry data recorded from the time of rescue medication intake onwards for 6 
hours will be excluded from the analysis of primary efficacy endpoint on PP population.
In case of less than three missing values among post-dose spirometry measurements at 45min, 
1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, the peak value will be calculated as the maximum of the available post-dose 
values over the time interval considered (4h). In case of three or more missing values, the peak 
value will be considered as missing.
In case of at least one post-dose time-point with change from baseline in FEV 1 ≥ 12% and ≥ 
200 mL, then Time to onset of action will be equal to the first post-dose time-point with change 
from baseline in FEV 1 ≥ 12% and ≥ 200mL in the time interval considered (12h). In case of no 
time-point with change from baseline in FEV 1 ≥ 12% and ≥ 200mL, and less than four missing 
values among post-dose spirometry measurements at 15min, 30min, 45min, 1h, 2h, 3h and 4h, 
then Time to onset of action will be equal to the last available post-dose time-point with non-
missing data and the subject will be considered as censored in the analysis.
HR AUC 0-4h will be calculated only if HR data are recorded on each time-point (pre-dose, and 
30 minutes, 1h, 4h post-dose).
HR peak 0-4h will be calculated only if HR data are recorded on each post-dose time-point (30 
minutes, 1h, 4h post-dose).
Further details on dealing with missing data, along with the handling of possible outliers, will be 
described in the SAP. Other critical missing data, if any, will be discussed during the review of the 
data. Decisions will be fully documented in the Data Review Report.
12.3.3 Patient demographics and baseline characteristics
The following variables will be summarized overall on the ITT population (and on the Safety or PP 
populations, if relevant): demographic characteristics, medical history and concomitant diseases, 
previous and concomitant medications, efficacy and safety parameters at screening and/or at 
baseline. 
12.3.4 Primary efficacy variables
Change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h normalized by time at Day 14 will be analyzed using an 
Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model including treatment, period and subject as fixed effects 
and baseline (average of the pre-dose FEV 1 measurements on Day 1 of each treatment period) as a 
covariate. The adjusted means in each treatment group, the adjusted mean difference between 
treatments and their 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) at Day 14 will be estimated by the model. The 
CIs and the p-values of the comparisons between each dose of FF pMDI and placebo will be 
adjusted for multiplicity. The adjustment will be based on the parametric simulation method by 
Edwards and Berry.[75] At each dose level, the superiority of CHF 1531 pMDI over placebo will be 
demonstrated by a statistically significant difference (adjusted p-value < 0.05) favoring CHF 1531 
pMDI.
All the other comparisons between treatments will be performed as secondary efficacy analyzes 
with no multiplicity adjustment.

FEV 1 AUC 0-4h normalized by time and in FEV 1 peak 0-4h at Day 1 and Day 14 and change from 
baseline in pre-dose morning FEV 1 at Day 14 will be analyzed using the same model as for the 
primary efficacy variable.
Change from baseline in FVC AUC 0-12h normalized by time, in FVC AUC 0-4h normalized by 
time  and in FVC peak 0-4h at Day 1 and Day 14 and change from baseline in pre-dose morning 
FVC at Day 14 will be analyzed using a similar model as the one used for the primary efficacy 
analysis. 
Time to onset of action (i.e., change from baseline in post-dose FEV 1 ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL) at 
Day 1 will be analyzed using a Cox proportional hazard model stratified by subject and with 
treatment and period as factor and baseline FEV 1 (average of the pre-dose FEV 1 measurements 
on Day 1 of each treatment period) as covariate. A Kaplan-Meier plot will be presented. 
12.3.6 Safety variables
Adverse Events
All adverse events starting on or after the time of first study drug intake will be classified as 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs). Any adverse event started after the Informed 
Consent signature and before the time of first study drug intake will be classified as pre-treatment 
adverse event. Pre-treatment adverse events will be listed only.  The number of TEAEs and the 
number and percentage of subjects who experienced at least one TEAE will be presented by 
treatment for all AEs, ADRs, serious AEs, serious ADRs, severe AEs, AEs leading to study 
discontinuation and AEs leading to death. Summaries will be presented overall and by system organ 
class and preferred term based on the MedDRA dictionary. 
Vital signs
Vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure) and their changes from baseline (pre-dose 
measurement on Day 1 of each treatment period) and from pre-dose on Day 14 will be summarized 
by treatment using descriptive statistics and the 95% CI of the mean.
ECG
12-lead ECG parameters (HR, QTcF, QRS and PR) and their changes from baseline (pre-dose 
measurement on Day 1 of each treatment period) and from pre-dose on Day 14 will be summarized 
by treatment using descriptive statistics and the CI of the mean (95% CI for absolute values and 
90% CI for the changes from baseline/pre-dose).
The number and the percentage of subjects with a:
QTcF >450ms (males only), >470ms (females only), >480ms (males only) and >500ms;
change from baseline (pre-dose measurement on Day 1 of each treatment period) in QTcF >30 
ms and >60ms;
for post-dose time-points on Day 14: change from pre-dose on Day 14 in QTcF >30ms and 
>60ms

each post-dose time-point, the change from baseline (pre-dose measurement on Day 1 of each 
treatment period) in 12-lead ECG parameters (HR, QTcF, QRS and PR) will be analyzed using an 
ANCOVA model including treatment, period and subject as fixed effects and baseline (pre-dose 
measurement on Day 1 of each treatment period) as a covariate. The adjusted means in each 
treatment and the adjusted mean differences between treatments will be estimated by the model 
with 90% CIs. 
HR AUC 0-4h normalized by time and HR peak 0-4h on Day 1 and Day 14 and their changes from 
baseline (pre-dose measurement on Day 1 of each treatment period) and from pre-dose on Day 14 
will be summarized by treatment using descriptive statistics and the CI of the mean (95% CI for 
absolute values and 90% CI for the changes from baseline/pre-dose).
Serum potassium and blood glucose
Serum potassium and blood glucose and their changes from baseline (pre-dose measurement on 
Day 1 of each treatment period) and from pre-dose on Day 14 will be summarized by treatment 
using descriptive statistics and the 95% CI of the mean.

13 ETHICS AND RESPONSIBILITY
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the Sponsor’s standard operating 
procedures and/or guidelines, the United States FDA regulations, the ICH E6 GCP guidelines, the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and other local regulations as applicable.
14 INFORMED CONSENT
Written Informed Consent will be obtained from all subjects as per IRB guidelines before any 
study-related procedures (including any pre-treatment procedures) are performed. The investigator 
has both ethical and legal responsibility to ensure that each subject being considered for inclusion in 
this study is given a full explanation of the protocol. This shall be documented on a written 
Informed Consent Form, which shall be approved by the same IRB or IEC responsible for approval 
of this protocol. Each Informed Consent Form shall include the elements required by ICH, Part E6, 
Section 4.8, and any applicable local regulations. The investigator agrees to obtain approval from 
the Sponsor of any written Informed Consent Form used in the study, preferably prior to submission 
to the IRB or IEC.
Once the appropriate essential information has been provided to the subject and fully explained by 
the investigator (or a qualified designee) and it is felt that the subject understands the implications 
of participating, the subject and the investigator (or designee) shall sign the IRB- or IEC-approved 
written Informed Consent form. The subject shall be given a copy of the signed Informed Consent 
Form, and the original shall be filed appropriately, according to the institution. A second copy may

 1. OBJECTI VES  
 
1.1 Primary Objectives  
 
1.1.1 To characterize the effects of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on plasma PAR -4  levels in 
adults with resectable solid tumors at the time of and after resection and to compare them  
to pre -HCQ treatment plasma  levels   
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
 1.2.1 To evalua te the toxicity profile  and pharmacokinetics  of hydroxy chloroquine given in 
this setting  
1.2.2 To assess the ability of hydroxychloroquine to alter PAR -4 expression in tumors . 
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Introduction: PAR -4 
Prostate apoptosis response -4 (PAR-4, also called PAWR) is a tumor suppressor protein that 
induces apoptosis in diverse cancer cells but not in normal cells .
1 PAR-4 is ubiquitously 
expressed in normal cells and tissues, but is often inactivated, down- regulated or mutated in 
several types of cancers .2 PAR-4 is located in various cell compartments, including the 
cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the nucleus, and both intracellular P AR-4 as well as 
secreted P AR-4 have been shown to play a role in apoptosis induction by caspase -dependent 
mechanisms .3 Moreover, P AR-4 sensitizes cells to the action of diverse therapeutic agents .4 
Accordingly, loss of P AR-4 in tumors contributes to recurrent tumors and a decrease in overall 
patient survival .5 PAR-4 protein is secreted in cell culture- conditioned medium (CM) or 
systemically in mice by normal cells, and extracellular Par -4 binds to its receptor GRP78 on the 
cancer cell su rface and induces apoptosis .2,6  By contrast, normal cells express low to 
undetectable levels of cell surface GRP78 and are resistant to apoptosis by extracellular P AR-
4.2,6 Our recent studies have indicated that GRP78 levels can be increased on the surface of 
diverse cancer cells to overcome PAR -4-resistance by inhibition of NF -κB activity, which is 
usually elevated in most cancer cells .6 Recombinant PAR -4 (made in E. coli) induces apoptosis 
of tumor cells and inhibits tumor growth in mice .7 
 2.2  Hydroxychloroquine  
Chloroquine  [CQ;  (RS)-N'-(7-chloroquinolin- 4-yl)-N,N-diethyl- pentane -1,4-diamine) is  
an antimalarial drug introduced into clinical practice in 1947 for the prophylactic treatment of 
malaria .
8 CQ has been repurposed to treat inflammat ory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis  
and lupus . Hydroxychloroquine (H CQ) differs from chloroquine  by the presence of a hydroxyl 
group at the N -ethyl substituent is beta -hydroxylated, but has similar pharmacokinetics to CQ, 
with quick gastrointestinal absorption and is eliminated by the kidney with minimal side effects on short term treatments.  Side effects of chronic treatment are restricted to the eye.  Overdose symptoms, which can occur within a half -hour of taking the medication, include convulsions, 
drowsiness, headache, heart problems or heart failure , difficulty breathing and vision problems. 
Both CQ and HCQ are potent inhibitors of autophagy, a cellular survival proces s during 
starvation to maintain cellular energy by degradation of unnecessary or dysfunctional 
Protocol #:  14-Multi- 14-MCC  
Version Date:  6-20-2016 
 
 
7 
 components through the actions of lysosomes . CQ and HCQ are lysosomotropic agent s, 
which inhibit autophagy by raising the lysosomal pH and leads to inhibition of both fusion of 
autophagosome with lysosome and lysosomal protein degradation. Moreover, by inhibiting autophagy, CQ activates caspases and sensitizes the cells to apoptosis. These apoptosis sensitizing features of HCQ or CQ enhance the anti -tumor effects of a broad range of cancer 
therapeutics .
9,10 In fact, CQ prophylaxis a gainst malaria in Tanzania was associated with a 
reduction in the number of cases of Burkitt ’s lymphoma .11 Accordingly, HCQ and CQ are being 
studied in a number of clinica l trials that use these compounds either pre -operatively or in 
conjunction with chemotherapeutic agents or radiation (http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/search/results?protocolsearchid=12327270)  
 
2.3 Rationale for Studying PAR -4 Expression in subjects treated with Chloroquine  
As the baseline levels of P AR-4 secreted by normal cells are generally inadequate to cause 
massive apoptosis in cancer cells, drugs that bolster the secretion of P AR-4 would constitute an 
important therapeutic advance.   Our recent studies identified several small molecules that show 
robust secretion of Par -4 in cell culture and mouse models, and secreted P AR-4 induces 
apoptosis of cancer cells .
12 However, these small molecules are not FDA -approved for human 
use. We therefore sought to identify FDA -approved small molecule drugs that show robust 
secretion of PAR -4 in normal cells and therefore can be re purposed for treatment of cancer. 
These studies (unpublished) identified HCQ as a potent inducer of P AR-4 secretion from normal 
cells under conditions that show no normal cell death.  As normal cells in any patient far 
outnumber cancer cells, FDA -approved P AR-4 secretagogues may play a valuable role in 
elevating systemic and local levels of P AR-4 protein and thereby induce paracrine apoptosis in 
primary and metastatic tumors. Systemic PAR -4 is also expected to induce apoptosis in 
circulating cancer cells th at contribute to metastasis. Because P AR-4 produces apoptosis in 
diverse tumors , and H CQ is expected to produce elevated levels of P AR-4 secretion in a broad 
range of patients to  prevent the growth of tumors. Thus, our findings will potentially have broad 
clinical significance.  
 
2.4 Correlative Studies Background  
Studies in cell culture and mice indicated that HCQ induced robust secretion of PAR -4 in normal 
fibroblast and epithelial cell cultures, and elevated PAR -4 protein levels in the plasma of 
immunocompet ent mice. Moreover , examination of plasma samples from renal cell carcinoma 
patients who were given HCQ (400 mg daily for 2 weeks) prior to surgery  indicated that H CQ 
increased the secretion of P AR-4 protein levels in 4 of 5 patients  (Figure  1). However,  HCQ 
pharmacokinetics is highly variable and we expect an exposure dependent (area under the 
cureve) effect on Par -4 secretion rather than a dose -dependent effect.

 Figure 1. Chloroquine induces Par -4 secretion.  
A and B. Various cell lines such as mouse 
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs, early passage 4 or 
5), human primary prostate fibroblast cells (PrSC), human primary prostate epithelial cells (PrEC), human lung embryonic fibroblasts 
(HEL), human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) (A) or prostate cancer cell li nes (B), were treated 
with the indicated amounts of chloroquine diphosphate (CQ) or vehicle (V) control for 24 h. The conditioned medium (CM), as well as the 
whole-cell lysates were subjected to Western 
blot analysis with the indicated antibodies. 
Collagen (Col1A1) was used as a loading control 
for protein secretion, as it is generally unchanged in response to the treatments. The samples were 
also subjected to SDS -PAGE and Coomassie 
blue staining to determine albumin levels in 
serum from the CM as another l oading control.   
C. C57/BL6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose (50 mg/kg body weight) of CQ 
and serum samples were collected after 24 h and 
processed by Western blot analysis.  
D. Plasma  samples were collected from renal 
cell carcinoma patients who were treated with 
HCQ pre -operatively for 2-weeks at 400 mg/day 
were collected pre-  and post -HCQ treatment at 
the University of Pittsburgh as part of a clinical 
trial on HCQ in 2010-2011. The archival (frozen) samples were processed by Western blot 
analysis at the University of Kentucky in 2013-2014.  
 
 
2.5 Hypothesi s 
 
That hydroxychloroquine  will induce a t least  2-fold increase in systemic (plasma) PAR-4 levels 
compared to pre -treatment plasma levels in patients with resectable solid tumors.

 3. PATIENT SELECTION  
 
3.1 Eligibility Criteria  
 
3.1.1 Patients must have a histologically confirmed or highly suspected (as determined by treating physician) solid tumor that is planned for surgical resection.  
 3.1.2 Age ≥18 years.   
 
3.1.3 ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A).  
 
3.1.4 Patients must be able  to ingest oral medications  (crushing and administering via PEG 
tube is acceptable) . 
 
3.1.5 Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:  
 
− absolute neutrophil count  ≥1,500/mcL  
− platel ets  ≥100,000/mcL  
− total bilirubin  Less than 1.5 x ULN  
− AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)  ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal  
− creatinine   less than  institutional ULN  
OR 
− Creatinine  clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels 
above institutional normal. 
 
3.1.6 Patients must be able to undergo surgical resection of their tumor as determined by the treating surgeon . 
 
3.1.7 The effects of hydroxychloroquine  on the developing human fetus are unknown.  For t his 
reason and because anti -malarial  agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this 
trial are known to be teratogenic, women of  child -bearing potential and men must agree 
to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant  while she or her partner is participating in this study, 
she should inform her treating physician immediately.  Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participat ion, and 4 months after completion of hydroxychloroquine  
administration.  
 3.1.8 Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.  
3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 
Protocol #:  14-Multi- 14-MCC  
Version Date:  6-20-2016 
 
 
10 
 3.2.1 Patients with metastatic cancer and/or cancer that is not amenable to surg ery (i.e. must be 
curative intent; locally advanced is acceptable) .   
 
3.2.2 Patients with significant malabsorption as determined by the treating physician.  
 
3.2.3 Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.  
 
3.2.4 Patients with known brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial because of their 
poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.  Patients with primary brain tumors amenable to surgery are allowed on this protocol.  
3.2.5 History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to hydroxychloroquine . 
 
3.2.6 Caution should be taken with the use of hydroxychloroquine  and any drugs know n to 
interact with  it (Appendix C).  Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, 
it is important to regularly consult a frequently -updated list such as 
http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx
; medical reference texts such as the 
Physicians’ Desk Reference may also provide this information.  As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or 
if the patient is considering a new over -the-counter medicine or herbal product.  
Appendix C contains a list of known drug interactions with hydroxychloroquine . 
 
3.2.7 Uncontr olled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, 
symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.  
 
3.2.8 Pregnant women are excluded from this study .  While  hydroxychloroquine  has not been 
formally assigned to a pregnancy category by the FDA , animal studies have revealed that 
the drug passed rapidly across the placenta, accumulated selectively in th e melanin 
structures of the fetal eyes, and was retained in the ocular tissues for five months after the drug had been eliminated from the rest of the body. There are no controlled data in human pregnancy. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for  adverse events in 
nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with hydroxychloroquine , 
breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with hydroxychloroquine .  
These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study . 
 
3.2.9 HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the 
potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with hydroxychloroquine .  In addition, these 
patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marro w-suppressive 
therapy.  Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

4. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES  
 
4.1 Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee and Institutional Review Board Review  
 
Before implementing this study, the protocol, the proposed informed consent form and other information to subjects, must be reviewed by the Markey Cancer Center’s P rotocol Review an d 
Monitoring Committee and the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board (IRB). A signed and dated statement that the protocol and informed consent have been approved by the IRB must be maintained in the Markey Cancer Center Clinic al Research and Data Management 
Shared Resource Facility (MCC CRDM SRF) regulatory binder. Any amendments to the protocol, other than administrative ones, must be reviewed and approved by the PRMC, study sponsor and the UK IRB.    
4.2 Enrollment Guidelines  
 
Eligible patients will be identified by the principal investigator and co -investigators of this study. 
Potentially eligible patients will be screened in the University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center clinics by the investigators, study personnel, and the Principal Investigator (PI). Upon obtaining proper consent, patients will be enrolled into the study.

Version Date:  6-20-2016 
 
 
12 
  
4.3 Informed Consent  
 
The goal of the informed consent process is to provide people with sufficient information so they 
can make informed choices about whether to begin or continue participation in clinical research.  
The process involves a dynamic and continuing exchange of information between the research team and the participant throughout the research experience.  It includes discussion of the study's purpose, research procedures, risks and potential benefits, and the voluntary nature of participation.  
The informed consent document provides a summary of the clinical study and the individual's 
rights as a research participant.  The document acts as a star ting point for the necessary exchange 
of information between the investigator and potential research participant.  Also, research participants and their families may use the consent document as an information resource and reference throughout participation in the trial. The informed consent document is often considered 
the foundation of the informed consent process; it does not, however, represent the entirety of the process.  Nor is the informed consent document a risk- management tool for the investigator and/or 
institution.  
 The investigator must explain to each subject (or legally authorized representative) the nature of the study, its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, the potential risks and benefits involved and any discomfort it may entail. Each subject must be informed that participation in the study is voluntary and that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time 
and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the trea ting physician.  
 This informed consent should be given by means of a standard written statement, written in non-technical language. The subject should read and consider the statement before signing and dating it, and should be given a copy of the signed document. If the subject cannot read or sign the documents, oral presentation may be made or signature given by the subject’s legally appointed representative, if witnessed by a person not involved in the study, mentioning that the patient could not read or sign the documents. No patient can enter the study before his/her informed consent has been obtained.  The informed consent form is considered to be part of the protocol, and must be submitted by the investigator with the protocol at the time of IRB review . 
 
4.4 Compliance with Laws and Regulations  
 
The study will be conducted in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the Declaration of Helsinki, any applicable local health authority, and Institutional Review Board (IRB) requirements.  The PI or designee will be responsible for obtaining continuing and not less than annual  IRB re -approval throughout the duration of the study.  Copies of the Investi gator’s 
annual report to the IRB and copies of the IRB continuance of approval must maintained by the MCC CRDM SRF.  The PI or designee is also responsible for notifying the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee of the MCCC and the UK IRB of any significant  adverse events that are 
serious and/or unexpected, as per SOP’s of those entities. The MCC  DSMC will review all

 adverse events of this IIT as per its SOP.  
 
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Enrollment and Screening Process  
 
Prior to any study -required tests, subjects mus t first provide written informed consent to 
participate in this study.  All lab tests and radiographic studies should be completed within 4 weeks prior to initiation of treatment. Complete history, physical examination, and evaluation of Performance  Status . Required lab work will include: complete blood count (CBC)  with 
differential ; serum chemistry tests to include alkaline phosphatase, glucose, creatinine, 
electrolytes, AST (SGOT), and total bilirubin.   
5.2 Agent Administration  
 
Treatment will be administere d on an outpatient basis .  Reported adverse events and potential 
risks are described in Section 7.  Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 6.  No investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than those described below may be administered with the intent to treat the patient's malignancy.  
   
Dose Schedule  
Dose Level  Dose  
Hydroxychloroquine (mg/ day)  
Level -1 200 mg/day  
STARTING DOSE : Level 1  400 mg/day  
Level 2  800 mg/day  
Level 3  1200 mg/day  
  Subjects will receive HCQ every  day for 14 days, starting at least 14d before planned surgery  
and optimally ending day prior to surgery.  Dosing can be extended 7 days if necessary due to unexpected delays . HCQ can be taken at any time of the day with meals. Tablets of HCQ are 
available in 200 mg strengths. HCQ will be administered in divided doses (twice a day) for doses above 200 mg/day to minimize nausea. The divided doses should be taken in the AM and at night with meals. Subjects will also be required to keep a medication diary and to present this at the end of the treatment.  Should a s ubject have emesis and regurgitate the medication within 30 
minutes of taking it, the dose may be repeated once, but if vomiting occurs longer than 30 minutes after ingestion, the dose should not be r epeated.  Subjects taking antacids, proton -pump 
inhibitors or H2- blockers should not take hydroxychloroquine  within 4 hours of these medicines.

 5.3 See Statistical Considerations for description of Dose -Escalation Process  
 
An adaptive, nonparametric, isotonic regression model will be employed in order to determine the biological effect of HCQ as well as to assess safety.  Patients will be enrolled starting at dose 
level 1.  Dose escalation and de- escalation is described in detail in the S tatistical Considerations 
section below.  Briefly,  
1. Treat a cohort of 3 patients at dose level 1  
2. Let j
t denote the highest level tried thus far.  At the current dose level j, based on the 
observed data, determine the dose j* that has the highest isotonic estimate of biological effect probability among the tried doses.  
3. If j* > j, escalate to dose  j+1  
4. If j* < j, de -escalate to dose j -1 
5. If j * = j < j
t, stay at dose level j; otherwise if j* = j = jt, escalate to dose j+1  
 Once the maximum sample size is reached  (n = 18) , select  the lowest dose that  has the highest 
estimate of biological effect based on PAR -4 levels.  
 
5.4      Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
 
Subjects will be evaluated for toxicity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) of the National Cancer Institute ( NCI) version 4.0 available 
at: www.ctep.gov
.  A DLT is defined as any of the below treatment emergent toxicities with 
attribution (possibly, probably or definitely related) to the study medication that occurs during or within 30 days of the last dose of  hydroxychloroquine. 
 Non-Hematologic:  
 > Grade 3 or 4 neuropathy 
 ≥ Any Grade 3 or 4 adverse event (excluding grade 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea lasting < 7 days or grade 3 fatigue). Note: Abnormal non- hematologic laboratory values > grade 3 
will be consid ered a DLT if they are determined to be clinically significant and possibly, 
probably or definitely related to study drug. If baseline value is elevated (or decreased) prior to enrollment, an increase (or decrease) will not be considered a DLT unless it worsens by 2 grades and is determined to be clinically significant by the treating 
investigator.  
 ≥ Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea lasting > 7 days despite maximal antiemetic/antidiarrheal therapy  
 Grade 5 toxicity  
 
Hematologic:  
 Grade 4 neutropenia ( ANC < 0.5 x 109/L) lasting for ≥ 7 days  
 Febrile neutropenia (ANC < 1.0 x 109/L with a fever ≥ 38.3ºC)  
 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets < 25.0 x 109/L) lasting ≥ 7 days despite dose delay  
 Grade 3 -4 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding  
 Grade 5 to xicity

Management and dose modifications associated with the above adverse events are outlined in 
Section 6.   
5.5 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Because there is a potential for interaction of hydroxychloroquine  with other concomitantly 
administered drugs through the cytochrome P450 system, the case report form must capture the 
concurrent use of all other drugs, over -the-counter medications, or alternative therapies.  The 
Principal Investigator should be alerted if  the patient is taking any agent known to affect or with 
the potential to affect selected CYP450 isoenzymes.  Appendix B  presents guidelines for 
identifying medications/substances that could potentially interact with the hydroxychloroquine.  While not strictly prohibited, these medications should be avoided if at all possible. Hydroxychloroquine should also be used with caution in patients taking medicines which may 
cause adverse ocular or skin reactions.  
 
5.6 Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment will continue for 14 days or until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
• Disease progression,  
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or  
 
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
 
5.7 Duration of Follow Up  
 
Patients will be followed for 30 days after surgery  or 30 days after completion of the last dose of 
hydroxychloroquine if no surgery is completed.  Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse event(s) will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.  Follow -
up visit should be combined with subject standard of care post -operative visit.  If that visit occurs 
prior to the 30 days post op, subject should be contacted 30 days or after completion of the last dose for adverse event assessment.    
5.8 Criteria for Removal from Study 
 
Protocol #:  14-Multi- 14-MCC  
Version Date:  6-20-2016 
 
 
16 
 Patients will be removed from study when any of the criteria listed in Section 5. 6 applies.  The 
reason for study removal and the date the patient was removed must be documented in the Case 
Report Form.

7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
Protocol #:  14-Multi- 14-MCC  
Version Date:  6-20-2016 
 
 
18 
  
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The following list of AEs (Section 7.1) and the chara cteristics of an observed AE (Section 7.2) will 
determine whether the event requires expedited  reporting (via Medwatch Forms ) in addition  to 
routine  reporting.  
 7.1 Expected Toxicities  for Hydroxychloroquine  
 
7.2 Precautions  
 
Dermatologic reactions to hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets may occur and, therefore, proper care should be exercised when they were administered to any patient receiving a drug with a significant tendency to produce dermatitis.   The methods recommended for early diagnosis of "chloroquine retinopathy" consist of (1) fund oscopic examination of the macula for fine pigmentary disturbances or loss 
of the foveal reflex and (2) examination of the central visual field with a small red test object for pericentral  or paracentral scotoma or determination of retinal thresholds to 
red. Any unexplained visual symptoms, such as light flashes or streaks should also be regarded with suspicion as possible manifestations of retinopathy.  
 If serious toxic symptoms occur from overdosage or sensitivity, it has been suggested that ammonium chloride (8 g daily in divided doses for adults) be administered orally 
three or four days a week for several months after therapy has been stopped, as acidification of the urine increases renal excretion of the 4 -aminoquinoline 
compounds by 20 to 90 percent. However, caution must be exercised in patients with impaired renal function and/or metabolic acidosis.  
 
7.3 Adverse Reactions  
 
The following Council for I nternational Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) frequency 
rating is used, when applicable: Very common ≥ 10 %; Common ≥ 1 and <10 %; Uncommon ≥ 0.1 
and < 1 %; Rare ≥ 0.01 and <0.1 %; Very rare < 0.01 %; Not known (frequency cannot be estimated 
from available data).  
 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders  
Not known : Bone marrow depression, anemia, aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, 
leucopenia, thrombocytopenia.  
 
Cardiac disorders  
Not known : Cardiomyopathy, which may result in cardiac failure and in some cases a 
fatal outcome.  
Chronic toxicity should be considered when conduction disorders (bundle branch block/ atrioventricular heart block) as well as biventricular hypertrophy are found. Dr ug 
discontinuation may lead to recovery.

Patients with retinal changes may be asymptomatic initially, or may have scotomatous 
vision with paracentral, pericentral ring types, temporal scotomas, abnormal color  
visions, reduction in visual acuity, night blindness, difficulty reading and skipping words.  
Corneal changes including edema and opacities. They are either symptomless or may cause disturbances such as halos around lights especially at night, blurring of vision or 
photophobia. They may be transient or are reversible upon discontinuation of therapy .  
Not known : Macular degeneration which may be irreversible.  
 
Gastrointestinal disorders  
Very common : Abdominal pain, nausea  
Common: Diarrhea, vomiting  
These symptoms usually resolve immediately upon reducing the dose or upon stopping 
the treatment.  
 
Hepatobiliary disorders  
Uncommon : Abnormal liver function tests  
Not known : Fulminant hepatic failure  
 Immune system disorders  
Not known : Urticaria, angi oedema, bronchospasm.  
 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders  
Common: Anorexia (usually resolves immediately upon reducing the dose or upon 
stopping the treatment).  
Not known : hypoglycemia  
HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE  may exacerbate porphyria.

8.3 Storage requirements  
Dispense in a tight, light -resistant co ntainer as defined in the USP/NF. 
Store at 20° -  25°C (68° -  77°F) excursions permitted to 15° -  30°C (59° -  86°F) [See USP 
Controlled Room Temperature].  
 Store out of the reach of children.  
 
8.4 Stability:   
When stored as listed above  and light -resistant co ntainers, hydroxychloroquine is stable for 3 
years from manufacture date.  
 8.5 Route of administration:   
Hydroxychloroquine  is taken orally  daily, each dose to be taken with a meal or a glass of milk. 
 8.6 CONTRAINDICATIONS  
Use of this drug is contraindicated (1)  in the presence of retinal or visual field changes 
attributable to any 4 -aminoquinoline compound, (2) in patients with known hypersensitivity to 4-
aminoquinoline compounds, and (3) for long- term therapy in children.  
 8.7 Precautions : General  
Antimalarial comp ounds should be used with caution in patients with hepatic disease or 
alcoholism or in conjunction with known hepatotoxic drugs. Periodic blood cell counts should be 
made if patients are given prolonged therapy. If any severe blood disorder appears which i s not 
attributable to the disease under treatment, discontinuation of the drug should be considered. The drug should be administered with caution in patients having G -6-PD (glucose -6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase) deficiency.  
 
8.8 Overdose  
Overdose with the 4 -aminoquinolines is dangerous particularly in infants, as little as 1 -2 grams 
having proved fatal.  
 8.9 Symptoms  of Overdose :  
The 4 -aminoquinoline compounds are very rapidly and completely absorbed following 
ingestion and in accidental overdosage toxic symptoms may  occur within 30 minutes. These 
consist of headache, drowsiness, visual disturbances, cardiovascular collapse, hypokalemia 
and convulsions, rhythm and conduction disorders, including QT prolongation, torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, followed by sudden potentially fatal respiratory and cardiac arrest. Immediate medical attention is required, as these effects may appear shortly after overdose. The ECG may reveal atrial standstill, nodal rhythm, prolonged intraventricul ar conduction time, and progressive bradycardia leading to 
ventricular fibrillation and/or arrest.  
Protocol #:  14-Multi- 14-MCC  
Version Date:  6-20-2016 
 
 
25 
  
8.10 Treatment  of Overdose :  
Treatment is symptomatic and must be prompt with immediate evacuation of the stomach by 
emesis (at home, before transportation to t he hospital), or gastric lavage until the stomach is 
completely emptied. If finely powdered activated charcoal is introduced by the stomach tube, after lavage and within 30 minutes after ingestion of the tablets, it may inhibit further intestinal absorptio n of the drug. To be effective, the dose of activated charcoal should be at 
least five times the estimated dose of ingested hydroxychloroquine. Convulsions, if present, should be controlled before attempting gastric lavage. If due to cerebral stimulation, cautious administration of an ultrashort -acting barbiturate may be tried but, if due to anoxia, 
convulsions should be corrected by oxygen administration, artificial respiration or, in shock with hypotension, by vasopressor therapy. Because of the importanc e of supporting 
respiration, tracheal intubation or tracheostomy, followed by gastric lavage, has also been advised. Exchange transfusions have been used to reduce the level of 4 -aminoquiolines in the 
blood. Consideration should be given to administering diazepam parenterally since studies have reported it beneficial in reversing chloroquine cardiotoxicity.  
 A patient who survives the acute phase and is asymptomatic should be closely observed for at least 6 hours. Fluids may be forced, and sufficient ammonium chloride may be administered for a few days to acidify the urine to help promote urinary excretion.   If serious toxic symptoms occur from overdosage or sensitivity, it has been suggested that ammonium chloride (8 g daily in divided doses for adults) t hree or four days a week be 11  
administered for several months after therapy has been stopped, as acidification of the urine increases renal excretion of the 4 -aminoquinoline compounds by 20 to 90 percent. However, 
caution must be exercised in patients wi th impaired renal function and/or metabolic acidosis.  
 
 
9. BIOMARKER, CORRELATIVE, AND SPECIAL STUDIES  
 9.1 Laboratory Correlative Studies  
 
The plasma concentrations of PAR -4 will be measured to assess induction of PAR -4 in each 
patient.  The plasma concentration of hydroxychloroquine and its metabolites will also be measured to establish exposure – response (PAR -4 release) relationships.  The extra aliquots of plasma after 
above studies will be stored in −80°C  for future biomarker studies i f needed.  
 
Blood collection for PAR -4  
 
Collection of Specimens  
 Blood plasma samples will be collected pre -dosing , and weekly during the preoperative period 
(+/- 1 day) , as well as on  or after surgery  (+/- 1 day) .  A total of 8 time  points will be required for 
each patient . 4 ml of venous blood will be withdrawn for pharmacokinetics; 4 ml of venous 
blood will be withdrawn for Par -4 and biomarker studies.  Samples will be withdrawn into 
Protocol #:  14-Multi- 14-MCC  
Version Date:  6-20-2016 
 
 
26 
 sodium heparinized collection tube. 
  
Handling of Specimens  
 After collection, blood and anti -coagulant will be mixed by inverting the tube 8 –10 times. Blood 
samples will be placed on ice immediately and centrifuged within 30 min at 7200 g at 4°C for 2 min. Plasma will be transferred into amber plastic tubes and store d on dry ice prior to 
transferring at −80°C until analysis. Plasma concentrations of PAR -4 will be quantified using 
ELISA (according to manufacturer’s instruction with a kit from CUSABIO).  Moreover, Western blot analysis will be performed as described pre viously
2,12 to further confirm the quantitative 
increase in the ~40 kDa PAR -4 band. Aliquots of plasma  samples will be subjected to SDS -
PAGE to resolve the plasma  proteins. The proteins will be transferred onto nylon membranes, 
and then subjected to Wester n blot analysis. The blots will be probed with  PAR-4 polyclonal 
antibody (from SantaCruz Biotechnology, Inc.) Parallel SDS -PAGE and Coomassie blue staining 
of the albumin in the serum samples will be used as loading control 2,6.  
 
Blood Collection and Handling of Specimens for Pharmacokinetics  
 Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be collected prior to the start of HCQ regimen and during day 1 of weeks 1 and 2 and on/after  day or  surgery  (+/- 1 day) , as specified in the 
Study Calendar. Blood samples ( 4 mL) will be collected in heparinized tubes.  After collection, 
blood and anti -coagulant will be mixed by inverting the tube 8 –10 times  and samples will be 
placed on ice immediately . Further processing will be carried out in the bioanalytical lab by staff 
in the Center of Pharmaceutical Research and Innovation (CPRI) under the direction of Dr. Leggas. C oncentrations of HCQ and metabolites  will be quantified using a validated 
bioanalytical assay implemented for LC/MS/MS.

10. DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event lists, guidelines, and instructions for AE reporting can be found in Section 7.0 (Adverse Events: List and Report ing Requirements). 
 
10.1 Data Reporting  
 
10.1.1 Method 
 
This study will require data submission and reporting via the OnCore Database, which is 
the official database of the Markey Cancer Center Clinical Research and Data Management Shared Resource Facility (CRDM SRF).   Instructions for submitting data is 
listed in Study -Specific Data Management Plans created by CRDM SRF staff . 
 
10.1.2 Responsibility for Data Submission  
 
Study staff is responsible for submitting study data and/or data forms to OnCore as per the Markey Cancer Center CRDM SRF SOP’s.  This trial will be monitored by the MCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) on a schedule determined by the Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee at the initial PRMC review.  The CRDM SRF staff is responsible for compilin g and submitting data for all participants and for 
providing the data to the Principal Investigator for review .   
  
11. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 11.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
Based on previous work in renal cell carcinoma  (Figure  1, Burikhanov, Rangnekar et al., 
unpublished data ), there is on average a 2 -fold increase in P AR-4 levels from pre to post plasma 
samples  as measured by ELISA and Western Blot .  We are interested in determining the dose 
wherein 70% of patients exhibit a 2 -fold increase in P AR-4 levels and  with an acceptable 
toxicity rate of no more than 30%.  For calculation of biological effect, we will utilize changes in PAR -4 levels from pre -study and the last time point prior to resection.  
 Given the established safety  and minimal toxicity of HCQ in s everal studies
13,14  our choice of 
study design in this pilot trial will be based on determining the dose with the target biological effect as well as acceptable toxicity.  Specifically, a nonparametric approach based on a double -
sided isotonic regression will  be utilized which c an also accommodate non -monotonically 
increasing biological effect rates  (
Zang, Y., Lee, J. and Yuan, Y. (2014) Adaptive Designs for 
Identifiying Optimal Biological Dose for Molecularly Targeted Agents, Clinical Trials , To appear ).  
Simulations were generated for varying scenarios of  biological effect rates  and dose toxicity  
rates across dose levels  to determine the operating characteristics of this design  (see Table 1) .   
Briefly, the first  four scenarios assuming low toxicity indicate close to a 50% selection 
probability for the correct dose with the target biological rate while the next four scenarios 
Protocol #:  14-Multi- 14-MCC  
Version Date:  6-20-2016 
 
 
29 
 assuming moderate toxicity also indicate at least a 50% selection probability for the cor rect dose 
with the target biological rate.  Finally, the last two scenarios indicate good selection probability 
for the dose with the highest biological rate that is closest to the target rate of 70%.   
Furthermore, all scenarios in Table 1 indicate that there is a clear winner  (i.e. a much higher selection 
probability for the correct dose compared to the probabilities for the other dose levels).   Finally,  the 
simulation s also confirmed that  more patients will be allocated to the correct dose.  
 The study will accrue a total of  18 patients with 3 cohorts per dose level. Estimates of biological 
effects as described above will be calculated  after every cohort of 3 patients and 
recommendations for the next cohort will be based on these estimates.  Specifically , the study 
will proceed as follows : 
 
1. Treat a cohort of 3 patients at dose level  1 
2. Let j
t denote the highest level tried thus far.  At the current dose level j, based on the 
observed data, determine the dose j* that has the highest isotonic estimate of biological effect  
probability among the tried doses.  
3.If j* > j, we escalate to dose  j+1  
4. If j* < j, we de- escalate to dose j -1 
5. If j * = j < jt, we stay at dose level j; otherwise if j* = j = jt, we escalate to dose j+1  
 
6. Once the maximum sample size is reached, we select the lowest dose that  
  has the highest estimate of biological effect based on PAR -4 levels. Decisions on the dose  
  that will be utilized for subsequent trials will be based on biological, clinical and  
  statistical consideratio ns.

11.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
A total of 18 patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 and dose escalation or de -escalation will be 
implemented as described in section 12.1 above.  We expect to enroll 1 patient  per month for 
expected  study duration of 18 months.    
 
11.3 Assessment of Safety  
The isotonic regression design as described in 12.1 incorporates toxicity assessment.  T he dose 
with the highest selection probability accounts for both the dose with the highest biological effect 
and toxicity that is closest to the target rate of 30%.

 11.4 Stratification Factors  
 
Not applicable for this trial   
11.5 Analysis of Safety  
 
All patients who received study drug will be included in the safety analysis of this study .  Adverse 
event data and corresponding toxicity grades during the days of treatment will be summarized in each tumor cohort  and in the overall patient population.  Incidence tables will be generated to 
summarize incidence of patients reporting at least one ep isode of each specific adverse event, 
incidence of adverse events causing withdrawal and incidence of serious adverse events. The total number of episodes for each event reported (Frequency Table), the severity and attribution to study therapy of each epis ode reported (Severity Table and Attribution Table) will also be displayed.    
 Listings of adverse events by patients will include the time to onset, the duration of each event, the severity of each event, and the relationship of the event to study therapy, whether it was a serious event, and whether it caused withdrawal. Safety data will be summarized for the overall 
patient group and by tumor cohort .  Toxicities will be graded according to Common Toxicity 
Criteria (CTCAE) v4.0.   
 
11.6 Pharmacokinetics Modeling and Pharmacodynamics Analysis  
 For assessment of biological effect, we will u tilize PAR -4 levels from pre -treatment and PAR -4 
from the last time point prior to resection.  Changes in  quantitative levels of PAR -4 measured via 
ELISA and Western Blot will be calculated and the proportion of patients exhibiting at least a 2 -
fold induct ion will be estimated overall and in each dose level along with exact 95% binomial 
confidence intervals. Isotonic regression will be fitted for the total sample to obtain estimates of biological effect at each dose level. Other exploratory analyses will in clude: paired tests to 
evaluate changes in PAR -4 quantitative levels from baseline and at each time point of 
measurement; correlations between several biological markers  indicated in Section 9.1 for 
Correlative Studies  will be estimated using Pearson or Sp earman’s correlation coefficient; 
repeated measures modeling of  several biomarker measurements over time; and descriptive 
statistics of biomarker levels for each disease group (if there are enough in each disease site).   Similar analyses plans will be emp loyed for biomarker assessments in tissue specimens.    
 Population pharmacokinetic studies have previously been conducted 
15.  This will allow the use 
of population parameters to be used as priors and thus enable  forecasting  the HCQ exposure for 
each pati ent, using a Bayesian approach , despite the limited sampling strategy 16, 17. Data analysis 
will be carried out with ADAPT V 18. 
  
11.7 Data Management  
 
The study statistician and staff from the Biostatistics Shared Resource Facility (BSRF) of the Markey Cancer Center will work closely with the study PI and the Clinical Protocol and and 
Data Management (C PDM  SRF) at Markey in the development of eCRFs for the study.

 Specifically, the statisticians will attend several meetings including the Protocol Initiation 
Meeting (PIM) to address all statistical considerations for this protocol including incorporation of dose -escalation and de -escalation plans for the adaptive design in this Phase I trial, 
appropriate and accurate collection of primary and secondary study endpoints and inclusion of valid values and range checks for data fields.  The OnCore clinical trial management system, managed by Markey’s C PDM , will be the primary database repository of clinical data from all 
patients enrolled into this trial.  Data will be accessed by the study statistical on a regularly -
scheduled basis to perform statistical programming for conduct of data quality control, data management, generation of interim reports and statistical analysis.  The BSRF has developed an 
automated mechanism for generating a trigger for assessment of biological response as well as dose limiting toxicities based on the dose escalation rules in section  12.1above.  In collaboration 
with the study team, procedures will be developed for timelines for data quality control, resolution of data queries, interim reporting and final data analysis.

 APPENDIX B  INFORMATION ON POSSI BLE DRUG INTERACTIONS  
 
A table with potential drug interaction with HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE  is included below. 
HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE  should also be used with caution in patients taking medicines 
which may cause adverse ocular or skin reactions .  
 
Drug Interaction:  
Proper Name  Effect/c linical comment  
Agalsidase  There is a theoretical risk of inhibition of intra -cellular α -galactosidase 
activity when HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE is co -administered with 
agalsidase.  
 
Aminoglycoside antibiotics  HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE may also be subject to several of the 
known interactions of chloroquine even though specific reports have not 
appeared including potentiation of its direct blocking action at the 
neuromuscular junction by aminoglycoside antibiotics.  
 
Amiodarone  There may be an increased risk of inducing ventricular arrhythmias if 
HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE is used concomitantly with other arrhythmogenic drugs.  
 
Antacids  As with chloroquine, antacids may reduce absorption of 
HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE so it is advis ed that a 4 hour interval be 
observed between HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE and antacid dosing.  
Anti -diabetic drugs  May enhance the effects of a hypoglycemic treatment, a decrease in doses 
of antidiabetic drugs may be required.  
 
Antiepileptic drugs  The activity of antiepileptic drugs might be impaired if co -administered 
with HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE.  
 
Antimalarials known to lower the 
convulsion threshold  HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE can lower the convulsive threshold. Co -
administration of HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE with other antimalarials 
known to lower the convulsion threshold (e.g. mefloquine) may increase 
the risk of convulsions.  
 
Arrhythmogenic drugs  There may be an increased risk of inducing ventricular arrhythmias if 
HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE is used concomitantly with other 
arrhythmogenic drugs.  
 
Cyclosporine  An increased plasma ciclosporin level was reported when ciclosporin and 
HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE were  co-administered.  
 
Cimetidine  HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE may also be subject to several of the 
known interactions of chloroquine even though specific reports have not appeared including inhibition of its metabolism by cimetidine which may 
increase plasma concen tration of the antimalarial.  
 
Protocol #:  14-Multi- 14-MCC  
Version Date:  6-20-2016 
 
 
35 
 Digoxin  May result in increased serum digoxin levels; serum digoxin levels 
should be closely monitored in patients receiving concomitant treatment.  
Insulin  May enhance the effects of a hypoglycemic treatment, a decrease in doses 
of insulin may be required.  
Mefloquine  HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE can lower the convulsive threshold. Co -
administration of HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE with other antimalarials 
known to lower the convulsion threshold (e.g. mefloquine) may increase 
the risk of convulsions.  
 
Moxifloxacin  There may be an increased risk of inducing ventricular arrhythmias if 
HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE is used concomitantly with other 
arrhythmogenic drugs.  
 
Neostigmine  HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE may also be subject to several of the 
known interactions of chloroquine even though specific reports have not appeared including antagonism of effect of neostigmine.  
 
Praziquantel  Chloroquine has been reported to reduce the bioavailab ility of 
praziquantel. Due to the similarities in structure and pharmacokinetic parameters between hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, a similar effect 
may be expected for HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE.  
 
Pyridostigmine  HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE may also be subject to sev eral of the 
known interactions of chloroquine even though specific reports have not 
appeared including antagonism of effect of pyridostigmine.  
 
Vaccine: Human diploid cell rabies 
vaccine  HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE may also be subject to several of the 
known int eractions of chloroquine even though specific reports have not 
appeared including reduction of the antibody response to primary 
immunization with intradermal human diploid cell rabies vaccine.

 APPENDIX C  ORAL HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE  ADMINISTRATION  
 
Hydroxychloroquine  should be taken with a meal or a glass of milk.   Try to take your 
hydroxychloroquine at about the same time every day.  Please record any side effects from the medication in the medication diary given to you by your study team.  
• Use of nau sea medicines ( Phenergan, Compazine, or Zofran) may be helpful, and these 
medicines are best given about 30- 60 minutes before the hydroxychloroquine . Please 
discuss this with your doctor. 
 
• If you are unable to take the medicine, call your doctor for further instructions  
 
• If you vomit within 30 minutes of taking the medicine, you may  take a second dose of the 
medication. Do not take more than two doses of medication in the same day.   
 
• If you vomit longer than 30 minutes after taking the medicine, do not take any more 
hydroxychloroquine that day.   
 
• If you have any questions, call your doctor for further instructions. 
Common hydroxychloroquine side -effects  What can I do if I experience this?  
Feeling sick, stomach pain, loss of appetite, 
diarrhea Remember to take the tablets after food or with a drink of milk. Stick to simple foods -  avoid spicy 
or rich meals  
Headache  Ask your  doctor or  pharmacist to recommend a 
suitable painkiller  
Eye problems (for example, blurred vision or 
sensitivity to light)  Let your doctor know about this as soon as possible  
Skin rash or itching  If this becomes troublesome, speak with your doctor  
 
If you have any other symptoms which you think may be due to this medicine, speak with your 
doctor or pharmacist.

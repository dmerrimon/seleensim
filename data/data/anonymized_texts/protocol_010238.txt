Title: Characteristics, Treatment Patterns, and Clinical Outcomes in Acute My eloid 
Leukemia (AML) Patients Using M ylotarg –a US Real -World Study  Using Electronic 
Medical Record Data
Rationale 
and Background: Historically , the number of treatments available for newl y 
diagnosed patients with AML  has been limited. However, new treatment regimens have 
become available recent years (including gemtuzumab ozogamicin [GO], midostaurin, 
glasdegib, 
plus low-dose cy tarabine , venetoclax plus hypomethy lating agents). Given the 
FDA label for GO, issued Septemb er 2017, it is critical tounderstand the recent real -world 
use of GO as a treatment for AML .
Research Question and Objectives: This research aims to a ssess patients with a diagnosis 
of AML who received Mylotarg in a real -world setting. The objectives are to:
Describe the patient demographics and clinical characteristics;
Describe treatment patterns and sequence;
Describe real world effectiveness outcomes;
Evaluate 
real world tumor response .
Study Design: This is a retrospective, observational study  that w ill document the treatment 
patterns and clinical outcomes in patients diagnosed with AML  who received Mylotarg . The 
study  will use United States oncology  electronic medical record data available to Concerto 
HealthAI, including data from CancerL inQ-affilia ted practices, referred to as t he Definitive 
Oncology  Dataset.
Population: This study  will include adult patients diagnosed with AML  who, at any  point on 
or after September 1, 2017 received My lotarg , alone or in combination with other agents for 
newly  diagnosed or relapsed refractory  AML.
Variables: Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and 
effectiveness outcomes will be collected and analy zed.
Data Source : Concerto HealthAI maintains a network of oncology  practices representin g a 
geographically  and demographicall y diverse patient population. Data from these practices 
have been collected centrally  in the Definitive Oncology  Dataset , which is the source of data
to be collected in this study .
Study Size: The target sample size fo r this study  is approximately  20-30 patients treated with 
Mylotarg .

RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND
Acute M yeloid Leukemia (AML) is th e most common form of fast-growing blood and bone 
marrow cell cancer. In the United States ( US)in 2019, it is estimated there will be 
21,450
new cases and 10,920 deaths from AML.1The average age at diagnosis is 68 years 
old, and the 5- year survival rate is 26.9%.2About 60 %-70% of adults with AML  can attain a 
complete remission following induction therap y with cy totoxic chemotherapies to reduce 
leukemic cells in the blood and bone marrow. Slightl y more than 25% (45% of those who 
attain comple te remission )are exp ected to survive 3 or more years and may  be cured.2
Remission rates are related to age ,with the expected remission rate of more than 65% in 
those y ounger than 60 y ears old. Duration of remission is shorter in older patients, and 
increased morbidity  and mortality  during induction treatment are related to older 
age.2
Historically , the number of treatments available for newl y diagnosed patients with AML  has 
been limite d. However, new treatment regimens have become available recent years 
(including gemtuzumab ozogamicin [GO], midostaurin, g lasdegib, plus low-dose cy tarabine , 
venetoclax plus hy pomethy lating agents). Given the FDA label for GO, issued September 
2017, itis critical tounderstand the recent real -world use of GO as a treatment for AML.
The present stud y is focused on real -world outcomes in adult patients with AM L who at any  
point received treatment with My lotarg, used alone or in combination with other age nts.
Although the present study  is focused on the receipt of this agent during first
-or second -line 
therap y, it is expected that most of the identified patients will also go on to receive 
subsequent treatment . The aim of this study  is to describe treatme nt patterns and 
effectiveness outcomes in a sample of oncology  patients treated for AML with Mylotarg
through up to two additional relapsed/refractory  (R/R) -based lines of therapy (through 
third
-line therap y).

1.
Record of 1or more of the following confounding diag noses at an y point before or 
after AML diagnosis: Acute ly mphoblastic leukemia; acute prom yeloc ytic leukemia, 
aggressive s ystemic masto cytosis; hy pereosinophilic sy ndrome and/or chronic 
eosinophilic leukemia; dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans; gastrointestin al stroma l 
tumors.
9.3.Variables
9.3.1. Regimens and Lines
Detailed definitions for lines of therap y, therap y start and end dates, discontinuation, and 
related items will be provided in the Statistical Analy sis Plan ( SAP). In consultation with 
Pfizer, business rules for defin ingregimens and lines of therap y may be altered to conform to 
standard Pfizer business rules and definitions, where applicable and possible. 
For purposes of this study, a regimen will be defined as 1 or more anti- cancer agents given 
in combinat ion, over a period of time, in which the following conditions hold:
1.All agents start within 30 days of the start of the first agent in the combination, unless 
the start of an agent later than 30 day s after the start of the first agent is specificall y 
indic ated as planned at the time of the start of the first agent.
2.No agent is discontinued and replaced b y another agent within 30 day s of the start of 
the first agent in the combination.
3.No agent is held and then resumed after an interval of more than 63 day s.A stand ard 
chemotherap y cycle is assumed to be 21 day s; 63 day s allows for a delay  of 3 cy cles 
of chemotherap y without a change in regimen. 
Accordingl y, unless the record indicates a planned delay  in the start of an agent, the addition 
of a new agent to an existing therap y more than 30 days after start of the regimen constitutes 
a change of regimen. Holding of an agent for a brief period is not interpreted as a change of 
regimen. However, discontinuation and resumption of an agent after an interval of more than 
63 day s is interpreted as signaling a new regimen. Discontinuation of all agents in a regimen 
signals the end of the regimen. Occurrence of a R/R event or a disease progression does 
signal the end of a regimen. Continuation after R/Revent or progression o f a treatment being 
given before the R/Revent or progression will be interpreted as a new regimen- albeit 
identical to the previous one. This scenario, treatment through progression, occurs in some 
settings, and is identifiable in study  data with the codin g rules described here.
For purposes of this study, first line therap y will be defined as beginning with the first 
regimen the patient receives after diagnosis of the disease of interest. Subsequent lines in 
this study  will be defined as R/ R-based lines.

Page 17of 31R/R-based lines are defined by
 the occurrence of a R/Revent or a disease progression -either 
may be cited, in which a R/Revent or disease progression must occur for a new regimen to 
be interpreted as a new line of therap y. R/R- based line s may  be preferre d where the research 
questions focus on effectiveness outcomes such as rwEFS/ rwRFS, and where sample 
homogeneity  as to previous disease progression is preferred for assessment of outcomes in 
second or later lines. In this study , refractor y AML is defined a s disease that is 
nonresponsive or failing to achieve at least minimal response as noted by  provider 
documentation (described in Section 9.7.6 ) while on therap y. Relapsed stat us is defined as 
the recurrence or worsening of disease following achievement of at least a minimal response.
Additionally , the documentation of advancement of disease in patients after initial AML  
diagnosis 
but before initial AML  treatment will be interp reted as a disease progression. R/R 
events and disease progression will be defined based on provider documentation, which 
primarily  includes progress notes.
9.3.2. Curated Data
Data abstracted for eligible patients from the unstructured data available in the Def initive 
Oncology  Dataset by CRNs will include the following:
Race/Ethnicity . 
Date of initial AML diagnosis. This date defines the index date for the study , as 
referenced below in describing other stud y variables. 
Documentation of de novo v ersus secondar yAML at index date. Secondary AML is 
defined as development of AML after m yelod ysplastic sy ndromes (MDS),

Page 21of 319.4.Data Sources
The Definitive Oncology Dataset is used in support of a range of business activities, 
including retrospective research, and are not aggregated specifically  to address the research 
of an y one stud y.
The Definitiv e O
ncology Dataset is drawn from a wide range of principall y community  
oncology  practices throughout the United States. Practices range in size from very  small to 
large, and are located in both rural and urban settings. The practices are not all members of 
any one group purchasing organization, so practice patterns reflect real -world variability  of 
treatment.
Datasets available to Concerto HealthAI include a repository  of oncology  healthcare data, 
including those from practices affiliated with CancerLinQ — a wholly -owned subsidiary  of 
the American Society  of Clinical Oncology  that works with both nonprofit and federal 
agencies to warehouse and aggregate medic al records of cancer patients treated at practices 
in 40 US states and the District of Columbia — a s well as administrative healthcare claims 
and genomic data.
Key features of the Definitive Oncology  Dataset include the following.
Availability  of both stru ctured data (tables, rows and columns) and unstructured data 
(text and image documents, e g, phy sician progress notes). The unstructured 
information is generall y not available in other EMR data sources, although this is 
where much of the richest clinical information is found. Together with the structured 
data, Concerto HealthAI has access to an essenti
ally complete version of the medical 
oncology  health record for each patient. As a result, analy sis does not need to rely  on 
proxy measures of key  clinical e ndpoints, as may  be the case where onl y structured 
EMR data are available.
Treatment across the pr actices from which data are drawn is not directed by  any 
single group purchasing organization requirements, unlike some other providers of 
EMR data. Therefore , data from the Concerto HealthAI  network reflect the diversity  
of real -world independent practic e.
The real -world diversit y of the practices from which data are drawn, and the clinical 
depth of the information available, enable our experienced oncology  research team to 
answer stud y questions that cannot be addressed through other data sources.

Page 22 of 319.5. Study Size
 
 Initial exploration of the Definitive 
Oncology Dataset suggest the study sample size will be between 20 and 30 patients.
The aims of this research are descriptive. Accordingly, statistical power for inferential 
testing comparing effectiveness outcomes across groups is not indicated. Therefore, power calculation is not applicable.
9.6. Data Management 
Following preparation and institutional review board (IRB) approval of a study protocol, 
updated SQL queries will be written to identify patients within the Definitive Oncology Dataset with evidence of diagnosis of AML. Feasibility programming has already identifiedsome likely eligible patients. However, some refinement of this programming will be undertaken to enhance identification of eligible patients. The resulting program will be used to populate a screening list used by Concerto HealthAI research staff for review of the electronic medical records.
Concerto HealthAI’s Statistical Group will extract information related to demographic 
characteristics, infused treatments, staging, and other clinical data, as applicable. Experienced CRNs will examine the medical record of each potentially eligible patient. The disease of interest and other eligibility criteria will be verified and documented. If the patient meets all eligibility criteria, and if the accrual target has not been met, the patient will be accrued. For each eligible patient, the relevant study data will be extracted by SQL query or abstracted by CRNs onto case report forms and entered into a secure database for analysis.
Data management systems used in support of Concerto HealthAI HEOR studies are not 
21 CFR part 11 validated, and are not intended for use in support of submissions to health regulatory agencies.
This project will entail use of an electronic data entry system with audit trail, but not a formal 
Electronic Data Capture system. Accordingly, the provisions of Section 4.4 of CT24-GSOP_Non-Interventional Studies (Design and Develop Data Collection Tool and Data Management) are considered outside the scope of the project.
9.6.1. Case Report Forms (CRFs)/Data Collection Tools (DCTs)/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term DCT should be understood to refer to either a paper form 
or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study.
A DCT is required and should be completed for the record of each curated patient. The 
completed original DCTs should not be made available in any form to third parties. Concerto HealthAI shall ensure that its DCTs are securely stored in encrypted electronic and/or paper form and will be password protected or secured in a locked room to prevent access by unauthorized third parties.CCI

Page 23 of 31Concerto HealthAI has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of curated data
required for the study entered on the DCTs and any other data collection forms and ensuring that they meet the data curation specifications provided by Pfizer. Any corrections to entries made in the DCTs must be fully captured in an audit trail.
9.6.2. Record Retention
Unless expressly agreed to via a separate written agreement by Concerto HealthAI and
Pfizer, Concerto HealthAI will retain all study-related documents, including copies of all DCTs, safety reporting forms, source documents utilized for curation services, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports), for the periods specified in this Section 9.6.2 or as required by applicable law, 
whichever is longer, unless Pfizer authorizes, in writing, earlier destruction. Complete and accurate accounting records relating to the services Concerto HealthAI provides for this study will be maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and retained by Concerto HealthAI for at least three (3) years after completion or discontinuation of the study. Other records relating to the services Concerto HealthAI provides relating to this study will be retained for five (5) years. (In the event of regulatory filings by Pfizer, Concerto HealthAI will retain the necessary data and analysis for a period of seven (7) years or as reasonably requested by Pfizer). Concerto HealthAI will ensure that it maintains mechanisms to read any records stored in electronic form for at least the minimum retention period for those records specified in this Section 9.6.2 . 
If Concerto HealthAI becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for 
the required period, Pfizer should be prospectively notified. The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer.
9.7. Data Analysis
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of data collected in this study will 
also be documented in a statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be dated, filed and maintained by the sponsor. [The SAP may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; any 
major modifications of primary endpoint definitions or their analyses would be reflected in a protocol amendment].
9.7.1. Descriptive Analysis
Descriptive statistics are typically generated for all study variables. The descriptive statistics 
include means, standard deviations, medians, and minimum and maximum values for continuous variables (eg, age at diagnosis) and frequencies and percentages for categoricalvariables (eg, race, performance status).
No statistical comparisons will be performed.

Page 24 of 319.7.2. Time to Event Analysis
Single time to event analyses will be conducted as specified under the study objectives.
 
Real world time to event outcomes in this study will include:
•rwEFS/rwRFS for each of the first three R/R-based lines of therapy. rwEFS will be 
defined as the time from the treatment initiation date (for the first line of therapy) to the date of treatment failure (TF), relapse from Complete Response (CR) or better, or death from any cause, whichever comes first. TF is defined as failure to achieve CR or better following up to 6 cycles of Mylotarg. rwRFS will be defined as the time from the treatment initiation date (for the first line of therapy) to the date of a relapse event, or death from any cause, whichever comes first.
•rwOS, from the first line of therapy through the end of record or death, whichever 
occurs first, and 
•Duration of therapy across lines of therapy from the first line of therapy through the 
third R/R-based line of therapy.
The time origin for analysis of rwEFS/rwRFS is the start of therapy within each specific line 
of therapy, and the terminal event is the earlier of an R/R event or death. The time origin for analysis of rwOS is the start of therapy within the first line of therapy, and the terminal event is death. The time origin for analysis of duration of therapy is start of Mylotarg, and the terminal event is discontinuation of that therapy.
9.7.3. Methods Under Objective 1
Objective 1: To describe the demographic and clinical characteristics as outlined in the 
variable list below for patients diagnosed with AML who received Mylotarg in a real-world setting.
Descriptive analysis as detailed in Section 9.7.1 will be conducted for work under this 
objective. Demographic characteristics that will be reported will include the distribution of sex, patient age, race/ethnicity, height, weight, BMI, insurance status, and region of residence closest to the index date. Clinical characteristics that will be reported will include the distribution of comorbidity status and comorbidity index score, ECOG score, and disease characteristics, such as stage at index date, cytogenetic testing at index date, and whether the AML diagnosis was de novo versus secondary.
Demographic and clinical characteristics will not be stratified by a primary grouping 
variable.CCI

Analy sis under this objec tive will include all study patients. Descriptive analy sis as detailed 
in Section 9.7.1 will be conducted for wor k under this objective. Treatment patterns include 
description of regimens within line of therap y for the first 3 R/R- based lines of s ystemic 
therap y as well as the description of sequences of regimens across 3 R/R- based lines of 
systemic therapy . Descri ption of treatment regimens within line includes the frequency  and 
percenta ge of each 
agent/ regimen received, b y regimen in sequence, b y line, for the first 
3R/R- basedlines of sy stemic therapy . In addition, the anal ysis will descriptively  
characterize th e starting dose of Mylotarg in each of the first line s of therapy .

Anal ysis under this objective will include all study patients. The outcomes of interest unde r 
this objective are rwEFS/ rwRFS and real world overall survival. Time to even t anal ysis as 
described in Section 9.7.2 will be utilized.
TheKaplan -Meier product limit estimator will be employ ed to evaluate rwEFS/ rwRFS and
rwOS.The time origin for these analy ses wi ll be the start of the treatment in the respective 
line of therap y for rwEFS/ rwRFS for the first 3 R/R- based lines of therapy .Thetime origin 
of rwOS anal ysis is the 
start of theearliest line of My lotarg therapy .rwEFS/RFS and rwOS 
analyses for lines o f ther apy will be limited to patients who received treatment during the line 
of interest .
The terminal event for analy sis of rw EFS/ rwRFS is the earlier of death or the first date of 
disease progression or R/R event following the time origin. Patients who have n ot died or 
experienced a disease progression or R/R event by the end of the medical record will be 
censored for anal ysis of rwE FS/rwRFS . The terminal event for anal ysis of rwOS is date of 
death. Note that Socia l Securit y Disability Insurance (SSDI )recor ds have an expected lag of 
up to 4 months. Accordingl y, patients who are not indicated to be deceased in clinical 
records or SSDI records will be censored for rwOS analy sis as of the later of 1) the latest date 
known alive within the clinical record , 2) 4
months prior to the date of most recent SSDI 
update. 
Separate Kaplan -Meier analy ses will be conducted for each rwEFS/rwRFS and r wOS

.
Tumor response will be assessed for the first and best overall resp onse to treatment for the 
first qualifying M ylotarg -containing R/R -based line of therapy during the study  period. 
Response cla ssific ations will be made based on the treating ph ysician’s documentation of 
response itself ,typicall y informed b y radiological scan reports  noted in the patient record. 
Classification is made to the following categ ories :complete response , partial resp onse (PR),
stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), and not evaluable (NE), each based on the 
treatingphysician’s statements.  In cases where complete response with partial hematologic 
recovery (CRh), complete r esponse with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi ), and 
morphologic leukemia -free state (MLFS) are explicitly  included in the treating phy sician’s 
statements, these addi tional classifications will be documented. 
Patients for whom the record 
did not clearl y indicate one of these classification swillbeclassed as NE. These patient 
responses will also be classified under a secondary classification as Other Favorable ,or 
Other Unfavorable, where the record indicated the general direction of effect in order t o 
preserve response information for ea ch pat ient, even when not classifiable according to 
standard response categories; these responses can be assessed in descriptive anal ysis.The 
date of the best overall response for the first qualify ing Mylotarg -contai ning R/R -based line 
of therap ywill be colle cted from the index date through the end of the third R/R

of therap yor the end of record, whichever occurs first. Tumor responses captured are based 
on treating ph ysician’s assessment in the medical record. Overall response rate will be
defin ed as a percentage of patients whose best response is either CR, CRi or MLFS, where 
available. Time to best response and duration of best response will be assessed using the 
descriptive techniques described abov e.

9.9.Limitations of the 
Research M ethods
1.This study  reflects treatment practice patterns onl y within the United States who are 
part of the Definitive Oncology  Dataset. The majority  of the data reflects trea tment 
in community  oncology  settings ( 80%). It is possible that treatment patterns may 
differ in academic centers compared with community  settings.
2.This study  is retrospective. With the advent of newer therapies in AML , it is 
expected that treatment patt erns will change during the next few y ears, and therefore, 
this study  may  not be reflective of future AML treatment patterns.
3.This study  reflects a convenience sample of patients. It is possible that patients 
within the Definitive Oncology  Dataset differ from the underly ing AML population 
in ways that may  not be measurable. For this study , all patients in the Definitive 
Oncology  Dataset with evidence of M ylotarg utilization and an AM L diagnosis will 
be selected, however. 
4.Some measurements may not be cons istently  available from patient records in t he 
Definitive Oncology  Dataset.
9.10. Other 
Aspects
Not applicable .
10.PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS
10.1. Patient I nformation
Concerto HealthAI and Pfizer may provide the other part y with access to certain information 
that can be used b y itself or in combination wi th oth er available information to identify  a 
specific individual included in the study  (“patient personal data ”) so long as prior written 
approval of the part y receiving the materials is obtained. For sake of clarity ,key-coded data 
relating to individual perso ns is considered to be personal data. Neither Concerto HealthAI 
nor Pfizer will attempt to re -identify  study  subjects. Both parties will impl ement appropriate 
internal measures to minimize the risk of any  re-identification of study  subjects.

REACTIO NS 
11.1. Structured Data Analysis
This stu
dy invo lvesdata that exist as structured data by  the time of study  start.
In these data sources, individual patient data are not retrieved or vali dated, and it is not 
possible to link (i e,identify a potential associat ion between) a particular product and
medica l event for an y individual .Thus, the minimum criteria for reporting an adverse event 
(AE) (ie, identifiable patient, identifiable repor ter, a suspect product, and event) cannot be 
met.
11.2. Human Review of Unstructu red Data
This study  protocol requires human review of patient -level unstructured data; unstructured 
data refer to verbatim medical data, including text- based descriptions and visual depictions of 
medical information, such as medical records, images of ph ysician notes, neurological scans, 
X-rays, or narrative fields in a database. The reviewer is obligated to report AEs with 
explicit attribution to any Pfizer drug that appear in the r eviewed information (defined per the 
patient population and study  period s pecified in the protocol). Explicit attribu tion is not 
inferred b y a temporal relationship between drug administration and an AE, but must be 
based on a definite statement of causali ty by a healthcare provider linking drug 
administration to the AE.
The re quirements for reporting safet y event s on th e non -interventional study  (NIS) adverse 
event monitoring (AEM) Report Form to Pfizer Safet y are as follows:
All serious and non- serious AEs with explicit attribution to any Pfizer drug that 
appear in the reviewe d information must be recorded on the NIS AE M Report Form 
and reported, within 24 hours of awareness, to Pfizer Safet y using the NIS AEM 
Report Form.
Scenarios involving drug expo sure, including exposure during pregnancy, exposure 
during breast feeding, me dication error, overdose, misuse, ext ravasat ion, lack of 
efficacy , and occupational exposure associated with the use of a Pfizer product must 
be reported, within 24 hours of aware ness, to Pfizer Safet y using the NI S AEM 
Report Form.
For these AEs with an e xplicit attribution or scenarios involving e xposure to a Pfizer 
product, the safety  information identified in the unstructured data reviewed is captured in the 
Event Narrative section of the report form, and constitutes all clinical information known 
regar ding these AEs. No follow -up on relat ed AEs will be conducted.

Page 30of 31All the demographic fields on the NI S AEM Report Form may  not necessarily  be completed, 
as the form designates, sinc e not all elements will be available due to privacy  concerns with 
the use of 
secondary  data sources. While not al l demog raphic fields will be completed, at 
the very  least, at least one patient identifier (e g, gender, age as captured in the narrative field 
of the form) will be reported on the NIS AEM Report Form, thus allowing the report to be 
considered a valid one in accor dance with pharmacovigilance legislation. All identifiers will 
be limited to generalities, such as the statement “A 35- year-old female ...” or “An elderl y 
male...” Other identifiers will have been removed.
Additi onally , the onset/start dates and sto p dates for “Illness”, “Study  Drug”, and “Drug 
Name” may  be documented in month/y ear (MMM /YYYY ) format rather than identify ing 
the actual date of occurrence within the month /y ear of occurrence in the day /month/y ear 
(DD/MMM/YYYY ) format.
All research staff membe rs must complete the following Pfizer training requirements:
“YRR Training for Vendors Working on Pfizer Studies (excluding interven tional 
clinical studies and non -interventional primary  data collection studies w ith 
sites/investigators)”. 
These trai nings must be completed by  research staff members prior to the start of data 
collection. All trainings include a “Confirmation of Training Certificate” (for signature b y 
the trainee) as a record of completion of the t raining, which must be kept in a retrievable
format. Copies of all signed training certificates must be provided to Pfizer.
12.PLANS FOR DISSEMINATING AND C OMMUNICATING STUDY RESUL TS
The final study  report will be completed byConcerto HealthAI and is estima ted to be 
available in July 2020.
In the eve nt of any  prohibition or restriction imposed (e g, clinical hold) by  an applicable 
competent authorit y in any area of the world, or i
f Concerto HealthAI is aware of an y new 
information which might influence the ev aluation of the benefits and risks of a Pfiz er 
product, Pfizer should be informed immediately.

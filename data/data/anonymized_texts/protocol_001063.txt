Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc.  patent (< 50% stenosis) by the Investigator’s visual estimate.  
14. The target lesion(s) requires treatment other than angioplasty (e.g., 
atherectomy, cryoplasty, cutting/scoring balloons, etc.) to facilitate 
subject device delivery.  Devices such as CTO  catheters or re -entry 
devices may be used to facilitate target lesion(s)  crossing. 
15. The subject has severe calcification of the target lesion(s), which 
prevents inflation of a PTA balloon (pre -dilatation of the targ et lesion is 
required).  
16. The target lesion(s) has been previously treated with a stent (bare or 
covered). A target vessel(s) with a previously placed stent is permitted  as 
long as the subject device(s) will not come in to contact with the 
previously placed stent during treatment of the target lesion(s).  
17. The subject has angiographic evidence of acute thromb us at the target 
lesion(s) .  
18. The target lesion(s) involves the origin of the internal iliac artery such 
that successful treatment of the lesion(s) would require the subject 
device(s) to cross/occlude the side branch.  Note, if the internal iliac 
artery is already occluded, the subject device(s) can be placed across the 
occluded vessel.  
19. The target lesion(s) is (are) located in the distal external ili ac artery 
such that successful treatment of the lesion(s) would require the subject 
device(s) to cross/occlude side branches (inferior epigastric artery and/or 
deep circumflex iliac artery) or be exposed to compressive forces 
associated with the close prox imity to the common femoral artery.  Note, 
if the side branch(es) is (are) already occluded, the subject device(s) can 
be placed across the occluded vessel(s)  as long as the device is above the 
inguinal ligament.   
20. The subject has an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) contiguous to 
the iliac artery target lesion(s). The presence of AAA grafts and/or 
endografts are not permitted .    
21. The subject has a pre- existing target iliac artery aneurysm or 
perforation or dissection of the target iliac artery prior to the initiation of 
the treatment for this study.  
Procedures:  All subjects will undergo a clinical evaluation at baseline/screening (prior 
to index procedure) ; treated subjects will undergo additional evaluations  
prior to  hospital discharge, 30 -days and 9- , 12-, 24-  and 36- months post -
index procedure.  A telephone screen for all treated subjects will be 
performed at 6 -months post -index procedure.  
Primary Endpoint : A composite safety and effectiveness measure defined as device and/or 
procedure -related death or myocardial infarction (MI) th rough 30 days , or 
any TLR , target limb(s) major amputation,  or restenosis (as determined by 
Duplex Ul trasonography ) through 9- month s post -index procedure.   
 
The primary endpoint will be evaluated against a PG of 19.5%, which was 
derived from iliac stent published literature .

LIFESTREAM ™ Balloon  Expandable Vascular Covered Stent  
BOLSTER  (BPV -12-001) Version 3.0  
Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc.  1.         INTRODUCTION 
The BARD® LIFESTREAM ™ Balloon Expandable Vascular Covered Stent  (BOLSTER) Study  is a 
prospective, multi -center, non- randomized, single -arm clinical study intended to collect 
confirmatory evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the L IFESTREAM ™ Balloon Expandable 
Vascular Covered Stent (“L IFESTREAM ™ Covered Ste nt”) for the treatment of stenoses and 
occlusions in the iliac arteries.  This study will be conducted in conformance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki, applicable national privacy laws (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements  in the U.S.) , applicable Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), European and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 
regulations (21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR ) Parts 812 , 50, 54, 56; ISO 14155:2011(E) ). 
 1.1. Background and Rationale  
 
1.1.1. Peripheral Arterial Disease  
 Peripheral Arter ial Disease (PAD) is an atherosclerotic syndrome that affects approximately 10 
Million people in the United States. Approximately 40% of these individuals have common PAD 
symptoms such as leg pain and claudication. Of patients between age 50 and 69, and more 
significantly over 70 years of age, with a history of smoking and diabetes, 29% will manifest 
PAD. The detection rate, today, is less than 20% of all PAD prevalent patients and the mortality and morbidity of patients with PAD is high.
1,2,3 
 Approximately 25% of PAD patients suffer from claudication (discomfort, fatigue, numbness, cramping, and/or pain) due to flow limiting stenosis in their iliac, femoral, popliteal or tibial 
arteries. Usually claud ication limits one’s ability to perform their normal daily activities because 
the pain is aggravated by walking. In later stages, blood flow is so reduced that ischemic rest 
pain, ulceration , and gangrene can occur. This stage is known as critical limb isc hemia (CLI) and 
approximately 5% -  10% of patients with intermittent claudication will progress to CLI . The 
presence of CLI is a significant risk factor  for subsequent cardiovascular complications . By six 
months, 40% of affected patients will undergo amputation, and 20% will die.
4,5 
 
1.1.1.1. PAD in Iliac Arteries  
 
The latest update of the Millen nium Market Research Report 2011 demonstrates  that in 2012, 
31% of all interventions in peripheral (lower extremity)  arteries are for the treatment of iliac 
artery occlusive disease.6 
 
1.1.2. The Current Standard of Care  
 Conservative therapy, including medication, walking exercises, smoking cessation and change of diet can be highly effective in compliant patients with symptoms of claudication. Patients with a confirmed flow limiting stenosis often benefit from  invasive treatment  when conservative 
therap y fails .  
 The most recent treatment recommendations according to the TransAtlantic Inter -Society 
Consensus Work Group suggest endovascular treatment in all TASC A and B lesions and in

LIFESTREAM ™ Balloon  Expandable Vascular Covered Stent  
BOLSTER  (BPV -12-001) Version 3.0  
Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc.  TASC C lesions in higher risk surgical candidates. In all patients with  TASC B and C lesions, 
the recommendations state that the patient’s co -morbidity, fully informed patient preference and 
the local operator long- term success rates must be considered.5  
 
The guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology state that a pr imary endovascular 
approach may also be considered in TASC D lesions in patients with severe comorbidities and 
the availability of an experienced interventionist.7 
 
1.1.3. Endovascular Therapy 
 Endovascular therapy most often involves the placement of a bare meta l stent (balloon 
expandable or self expanding) as primary therapy for iliac  occlusive disease. According to 
published clinical literature primary patency rates between 70% and 97% at 12 months have been shown with the treatment of iliac artery stenoses and occlusions with metal stents.
8-16 
 Over the past several years, the safety and effectiveness of endovascular treatment of patients with extensive TASC C and D disease was evaluated in clinical studies and the long term clinical outcomes were found to be comparable to those historically achieved with surgery.
15-17 Not 
surprisingly, however, extensive TASC C and D lesions appear to have a slightly lower primary patency at 12 months compared to TASC A and B lesions.
10-12,15,16,18 -20 
 According to physicians’  input and results from early studies, the use of an expanded 
polytetrafluoroethylene  (ePTFE ) covered stent in the iliac arteries may have the additional 
benefit of preventing in -stent restenosis and tissue prolapse through the stent interstices in 
patient s with a highly calcified plaque burden and/or fresh thrombotic material. Furthermore, a 
covered stent may reduce showering and embolism of plaque particles into the outflow arteries.
21,22 
 One published clinical study (single center, retrospective analysi s) from Sabri et al. supports a 
benefit of balloon expandable covered stents over bare metal stents in lesions treated with kissing stents.  In this study, covered stents demonstrated a 92% patency rate after two years, compared to 62% with bare stents.
21    
 Additionally, a multicenter prospective randomized controlled study by Mwiapatyi et al. suggests that aortoiliac lesions treated with a covered stent were significantly more likely to remain free from binary restenosis than those that were treated with  a bare metal stent. Subgroup 
analyses demonstrated a significant difference in freedom from binary restenosis for covered stents in TASC C and D lesions compared with bare stent s.
22  
 This study will provide clinical  evidence to demonstrate reasonable assurance of safety and 
effectiveness of the
 LIFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent .  At the initiation of this protocol, no other 
clinical studies or clinical data are available for the L IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent .

2. STUDY DESIGN  
This is a prospective, multi -center, non- randomized, single -arm clinical study of the 
LIFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent for the treatment of stenoses and occlusions in the common and/or 
external iliac arteries.  A composite safety and effectiveness measure of subjects  receiving the 
LIFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent w ill be compared to a Performanc e Goal ( PG) derived from iliac 
stent  published literature  (See Section 3.1) .   
 The study wi ll be conducted at a maximum of 35 active investigational sites (“s ites”) in the 
United Sta tes, Europe , and Australia/New Zealand .  Enroll ment will continue until one -hundred 
fifty-four (154) subjects are treated with the L
IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent, which is an estimated 
three- hundred eight (308) consecutive subjects in a non- randomized fashion (See Section 5.2.2) .  
Approximately 30- 50% of the treated subjects will be U.S. subjects. An interim analysis will be 
conducted when one hundred three (103)  subjects are followed for 9 months. 
 Clinical follow -up for all treated subjects will be performed at hospital discharge, 30 -days, and 
9-, 12- , 24- , and 36- months post -index procedure.  A telephone screen for all treated subjects 
will be performed at 6 -months post -index procedure.

Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc.  3. STUDY ENDPOINTS  
 
Reference Section 6 for Statistical Overview.    
 3.1. Primary Endpoint with Hypothesis Testing  
 The primary  endpoint of the study is a composite safety and effectiveness measure defined as 
device and/or procedure -related  death or myocardial infarction (MI) through 30 da ys, or any 
Target Lesion Revascularization ( TLR ), target limb(s) major amputation,  or restenosis through 
9-months post -index procedure.   
 Device and/or procedure- related  death , MI, and target limb(s) major amputa tion will be 
adjudicated by a Clinical Events Committee (CEC).  TLR is defined as the first revascularization 
procedure (e.g., PTA, atherectomy, etc.) of the target lesion(s)  following the index procedure  as 
determined  by an Independent Angiographic Core Lab (or CEC, as necessary) .  Restenosis will 
be assessed by duplex ultraso nography (DUS), where the target lesion(s) is determined to have a 
peak systolic velocity ratio (PS VR) > 2.4 with post -stenotic turbulence , as determined by an 
Independent DUS  Core Lab.   In this study, a PS VR of > 2.4 suggests > 50% restenosis.  
 The primary endpoint will be evaluated against a  PG of 19.5%, which was derived from iliac 
stent published literature  (See Section 6 ). 
 3.2. Secondary Endpoints  
 
The following secondary endpoints will be evaluated to provide further information related to the safety and effectiveness of the L
IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent . 
 
− The rate of Major Adverse Events ( MAEs ) defined as device and/or procedure -related  
death  or MI through 30 days, or  any TLR or target limb(s) major amputation through 9-
months  post-index procedure .  Major amputation is defined as an amputation at or above 
the ankle.  TLR will be verified by an Independent Angiographic Core Lab. All other 
MAEs will be verified  by a CEC.   
 
− Acute Lesion Success  defined as attainment of <  30% residual stenosis of the target 
lesion after the index procedure using any percutaneous method and/or non-
investigational device (i.e., post -dilatation) , as determined  by an Independent 
Angiographic Core Lab.  
 
− Acute Procedure Success  defined as lesion success and no peri -procedural 
complications (death, stroke, myocardial infarction ( MI), emergent surgical 
revascularization, significant di stal embolization in target limb, and thrombosis of target 
vessel)  prior to hospital discharge .  Lesion success is determined by an Independent 
Angiographic Core Lab and complications are adjudicated by a CEC.   
 
− Acute Technical Success  defined as successful deployment of the L IFESTREAM ™ 
Covered Stent  at the intended location, as determined by the Investigator .

Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc.  − Target Lesion Revascularization  (TLR ) at 6-, 9-, 12-, 24-, and 36-months  post-index 
procedure.  TLR is defined as the first revascularization procedure (e.g., PTA, 
atherectomy, etc.) of the target lesion(s)  following the index procedure , as determined by 
an Independent Angiographic Core Lab.  
 
− Target Vessel Revascularization  (TVR) at 6-, 9-, 12- , 24-, and 36-months  post-index 
procedure.  TVR is defined as the first revascularization procedure (e.g. PTA, stenting, 
surgical bypass, etc.) in the target vessel (s) following the index procedure , as determined 
by an Independent Angiographic Core Lab.  
 
− Sustained Clinical Success  defined as sustained cumulative improvement from baseline 
value of ≥ 1 Rutherford Category23 at 30 -days and 9- , 12-, 24-, and 36- months post -index 
procedure , as determined by the Investigator .  
 
− Primary Patency  at 9-, 12-, 24-  and 36- months post -index procedure corresponding to 
PSVR ≤ 2.4.  Primary Patency  will be  assessed by DUS , where the target lesion(s) is 
determined to be no longer patent at a PS VR > 2.4 with post -stenotic turbulence, as 
determined by an Independent DUS Core Lab .  TLR is also considered a loss of primary 
patency.  
 
− Primary Assisted  Patency  at 9 -, 12- , 24- , and 36- months post -index procedure 
corresponding to PS VR ≤ 2.4, as determined by an Independent DUS Core Lab.  Primary 
Assisted  Patency  is independent of whether or not patency is re -established via an 
endovascular procedure  following res tenosis. 
 
− Secondary  Patency  at 9-, 12-, 24- , and 36- months post -index procedure corresponding 
to PSVR ≤ 2.4, as determined by an Independent DUS Core Lab.  Secondary Patency  is 
independent of whether or not patency is re -established via an endovascular procedure  
following restenosis or occlusion.    
− Quality of Life as assessed by a Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) at baseline, 
30-days and 9- , 12-, 24- and 36- months post -index procedure.

10. The subject had a  prior vascular intervention(s) within 30 days  before , or has an 
intervention planned for within 30 days after the index procedure.   Refer to inclusion 
criterion #10 for exceptions on SFA lesions and contralateral iliac lesions. 
 
11. The subject has another medical condition, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may 
cause him/her to be non- compliant with the protocol, confound the data interpretation, or 
is associated with a life expectancy insufficient to allow for the completion of study 
procedures and follow -up.   
 
12. The subject is currently participating in an investigational drug, biologic, or another 
device study.  Studies requiring extended follow -up for products that are now 
commercially available are not considered investigational studies.  
 Angiographic Exclusion Criteria  
 13. The subject has extensive peripheral vascular disease, which in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude safe insertion of an introducer sheath.  The ipsilateral 
common femoral artery should be patent (< 50% stenosis ) by the Inve stigator’s visual 
estimate.  
 
14. The target lesion(s) requires treatment other than angioplasty (e.g., atherectomy, cryoplasty, cutting/scoring balloons, etc.) to facilitate subject device delivery.  Devices such as CTO  catheters or re -entry devices may be used to facilitate target lesion(s)  
crossing. 
 
15. The subject has severe calcification of the target lesion(s), which prevents inflation of a PTA balloon (pre -dilatation of the target lesion is required).  
 
16. The target lesion(s) has been previously treated with a  stent (bare or covered). A target 
vessel(s) with a previously placed stent is permitted  as long as the subject device (s) will 
not come into  contact with the previously placed stent during treatment of the target

17. The subject has angiographic evidence of acute thromb us at the target lesion(s) .  
 
18. The target lesion(s) involves the origin of the internal iliac artery such that successful treatment of the lesion(s) would require the subject device(s) to cross/occlude the side branch.  Note, if the internal iliac artery is already occluded, the subject device(s) can be 
placed across the occluded ves sel.  
 
19. The target lesion(s) is (are) located in the distal external iliac artery such that successful treatment of the lesion(s) would require the subject device(s) to cross/occlude side branches (inferior epigastric artery and/or deep circumflex iliac art ery) or be exposed to 
compressive forces associated with the close proximity to the common femoral artery.  Note, if the side branch(es)  is (are) already occluded, the  subject device(s) can be placed 
across the occluded vessel(s)  as long as the device is above the inguinal ligament .

5.1.7. Diagnostic Angiogram  
 Prior to any study intervention, subjects meeting the clinical eligibility criteria for the study will 
undergo diagnostic angiography to better characterize the degree of atherosclerosis  and ensure 
that the subject meets all angiographic inclusion and excl usion criteria . 
 Access should be gained per  the institution’s standard technique .  The procedure begins at the 
time that arterial access is obtained.  
 All angiography shall be performed using the identical angles, magnification and angiographic technique as described in the “Angiography Guidelines” supplied by the Angiographic Core Lab.  
It is important to use the specified calibrated measurement catheter so that the Angiographic Core Lab may properly assess the target lesion characteristics  (e.g., reference 
vessel diameter, lesion diameter and length).  P roperly labeled angiographic -recorded media 
are to be uploaded or sent to the Angiographic C ore Lab  for evaluation.   
   5.2. Index Procedure  
 Preparation should be conducted adhering to the s ite’s standard of care for procedures and 
monitoring, including the use of standard sterile operative techniques.  
 5.2.1. Target Lesion(s) PTA  
 All subjects will undergo conventional PTA pre -dilatation at the target lesion site(s) previously 
identified by angiography.  Prior to PTA, the Investigator shall identify (by visual estimation) the beginning and end of each target lesion(s).  The target lesion(s) should have a combined (single 
or multiple lesion s) lesion length of less than  or equal to  100 mm per side (unilateral or 
bilateral disease).   PTA shall be limited to predetermined treatment segment(s).   
 It is required that angiographic image(s) of the inflated PTA balloon be captured.  
Choice of specific balloon catheters and inflation pressure should be determined by the Investigator based on his/her standard of care practices, and should be recorded.  It is not  
acceptable for the Investigator to use additional commercially -approved tre atment modalities 
(e.g., atherectomy, cryotherapy, cutting/scoring balloon) during the study procedure.  Subjects 
who require treatment with any of these alternative modalities should not be enrolled in the study.  It is acceptable for the Investigator to  use CTO catheters or re -entry devi ces to facilitate 
target lesion(s)  crossing.   
 In certain instances, a dissection may occur following PTA of the target lesion(s).   
 
Target Lesion including Dissection : Less than  or equal to 100 mm 
− If a flow-limiting dissection occurs, and  extends beyond the target lesion(s), but  the total 
length of the target lesion(s) plus the dissected segment  is less than  or equal to  100 mm in 
length, the LIFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent (s) may be used to properly treat the dissected 
segment.

Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc.   
Target Lesion including Dissection : Greater than 100 mm 
− If the total length of the target lesion(s) plus the dissect ed segment  extends greater than 
100 mm, the Investigator should not  place the L IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent (s) to treat 
the dissected segment.  The Investigator should use standard of care practices to treat the 
dissected segment.  As the study device will not be introduced, these s ubjects requi ring 
treatment of dissected segments extending greater than 100 mm will be treated as an  
intra-procedure screen failure  and will not be included in the ITT analysis. 
 
Dissection including the internal iliac (hypogastric) artery or other important collaterals  
− If a dissection occurs at the origin of the hypogastric artery (or other important 
collateral), the Investigator should not  place the LIFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent (s) to treat 
the dissected segment.  The Investigator should use standard of care pra ctices to treat the 
dissected segment, which may include placing an approved iliac bare metal stent in order to treat the dissection without occluding the hypogastric (or collateral) artery.  As the study device will not be introduced, t hese s ubjects will be treated as an  intra-procedure 
screen failure and will not be included in the ITT analysis.  However, if the hypogastric 
(or collateral) artery is already occluded and the lesion (including dissection) is less than  
or equal to 100 mm in leng th, the L
IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent(s) may be used to 
properly treat the dissected segment  as long as the device is above the inguinal ligament .  
 
5.2.2. Enrollment  
 
Enrollment  
A subject is considered enrolled in the study once he/she has agreed to study participation and has provided consent  (an estimated  308 subjects  assuming a 50% screen failure rate ).  Subjects 
who fail to meet eligibility criteria should be treated according  to the Investigator’s standard of 
care pr actices .  Such subjects’ study participation will end at the time of eligibility failure.    
 
Treated Subject  
After the subject has  met all eligibility criteria,  undergone successful PTA of the target lesion(s), 
and the LIFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent  catheter is introduced (i.e., delivery system enters the 
subject’s body), the subject will be considered to be a treated subject in the study.  Treated 
subjects will continue study participation through the study’s 36- month follow -up period.   
Subjects that do not receive the L IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent implant (but the L IFESTREAM ™ 
Covered Stent catheter was introduced) will be followed through the 30 -day follow -up visit to 
assess any safety events  and will be included in the ITT and PP analys es (see Section 6).  
 5.2.3. Placement of the L
IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent  
 The use of up to two (2) L
IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stents (placed in an overlapping fashion) is 
acceptable in this study  (per side in bilateral disease) .  The recommended overlap distance 
between the two (2) L IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stents  is approximately 10 mm.

Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc.  In the case of a geographic miss  (or dissection)  which necessitates placement of more than two 
(2) LIFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent s, one more LIFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent  may be placed 
(three total subject devices).  However, if a dissection extends down to or includes the internal 
iliac artery, standard of care should be applied, including the placement of a co mmercially -
available stent, which does not include the L IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent  (unless the internal 
iliac was already occluded) .  In this case, the subject will be included in the ITT analysis.  
 Kissing stents may be placed at CIA ostial  lesions.   In the case of unilateral  ostial disease, a 
L
IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent  may be placed in the healthy contralateral vessel (i.e., bilateral 
treatment using kissing stents), as this is standard of care when placing covered stents.  In such a case, t he healthy vessel would also become a treatment vessel (i.e., unilateral disease, but 
bilateral treatment due to ostial disease).   No crossover procedures are allowed for treatment of 
outflow disease once kissing stents are placed.   
 It is required that a  pre-deployment angiographic image(s) of the L
IFESTREAM ™ Covered 
Stent (s) be captured.  
 It is required that angiographic image(s) of the fully- inflated L
IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent  
balloon (s) be captured.  
 It is required that a post -deployment angiographic image (s) of the L
IFESTREAM ™ Covered 
Stent(s) be captured . 
 
Post-dilatation of each L IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent can be performed  to ensure proper 
expansion of the L IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent .  If post -dilated, t he Investigator should select a 
balloon size of the same approximate diameter as  the native vessel.  Balloon dilation of the 
healthy vessel beyond the proximal or distal edges of the L IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent  
should be avoided.  
 
If post-dilated , it is required that the post-dilatation angiographic image (s) of the 
LIFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent  be captured.   
 All angiography shall be performed using the identical angles, magnification and angiographic technique as described in the “Angiography Guidelines” supplied by the Angiographic Core Lab.   
 5.2.4. Intra -Procedure – Other Treatment Modalities  
 If the entirety of the lesion(s) cannot be treated to an angiographically acceptable result, consideration should be given to other medically -appropriate treatment modalities, in each case, 
as dictated by clinical circumstances, institutional standard of care, an d Investigator preference.  
All subjects that receive a L
IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent and undergo other treatment modalities 
will be followed p er protocol specifications, will be documented, and included in the ITT 
analysis .  If a subject  is converted to bypas s surgery and the L IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent is 
explanted, then the subject  will be followed through the 30- day follow -up visit to assess any 
safety events  and will also be included in the ITT .  An emergent intervention of any kind is 
allowed at any time at the discretion of the Investigator, and should be documented in the medical record/source documents.

5.2.5. Final Angiogram  
 Completion angiography of the distal infrapopliteal vessels should be per formed  to rule -out the 
possibility of distal embolization.   Properly -labeled angiographic -recorded media are to be 
uploaded or sent to the Angiographic Core Lab  for evaluation.  
 5.2.6. Guide Catheter/Sheath Removal Guidelines  
 Immediately following the procedure, in accordance with the institution’s standard of care practices, heparin should be discontinued.  An on -label  vascular closure device may be used at 
the discretion of the Investigator, in accordance with the manufacture r’s directions. The index 
procedure ends at the time that the last guidewire is removed.  
 5.2.7. Post-Procedure Medications  
 
Treated subjects are to receive a minimum of 75 mg of ASA orally per day for a  minimum of 6 
months, and a minimum of 75 mg of c lopidogrel orally per day for a minimum of 3 months . 
Subjects should be excluded if they have an allergy to aspirin at baseline. Ticlopidine may be 
prescribed if the subject has an allergy or contraindication to Clopidogrel.  Clopidogrel is not 
required if a subject is taking warfarin, prasugrel, ti cagrelor , and/or approved direct thrombin 
inhibitors (e.g., dabigatran) or factor Xa inhibitors (e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban) ; however the 
subject should receive a minimum of 75 mg of ASA orally per day for a minimum of 6 months.  
Investigators may elect to use additional anticoagulants, for example, low molecular weight heparin as they deem medically appropriate. If the treated  subject requires subsequent surgery 
that necessitates the discontinuation of these medications, then the subject is to resume protocol required medications as soon as possible after the medical procedure.   
 
5.3. Hospital Discharge Procedures  
 Prior to hospita l discharge, each treated subject should have the following 
examinations/assessments performed:  
 
− Comprehensive physical examination of the subject’s overall health status, including:  
o Target Limb Assessment  
o Concomitant Medication(s) : antiplatelets , anticoagulants , direct thrombin 
inhibitors, and factor Xa inhibitors  (e.g., ASA, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, 
prasugrel, t icagrelor, w arfarin , dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban)  
− Documentation of occurrence of Adverse Events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) since index procedure.  
 
5.4. Subject Follow -Up 
 
All treated subjects who receive a L IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent will be followed at 30 -days and

5.5. Subject Discontinuation 
 
The f ollow -up period for this study is 36 months (1095 Days ± 30 Days).  Subjects may be 
discontinued for the following reasons:  
− Lost to Follow -Up (LTF):  A subject may be considered LTF if the site personnel are 
unable to locate the subject despite two documented attempts to notify the subject via telephone and a third attempt by certified mail.   Before the site considers a subject LTF, 
written agreement should be obtained from Bard.  
− Withdrawn Consent:  The subject requests to terminate his/her participation in  the study 
(the Investigator, or authorized designee, must attempt to identify and document the reasons for termination).  
− Death:  The subject becomes deceased.  If known, the cause of death should be documented.  
− Withdrawal by Investigator:  Participation may be immediately terminated by the Investigator if, in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject would be exposed to inappropriate risk by continuing in the study.  Additionally, the Investigator may terminate a subject’s participation with prior written approval from Bard if the subject is repeatedly noncompliant with study procedures.  
− Study Termination:  The study is terminated by Bard. (See Section 16)  
 Additional subjects will not be enrolled to replace those who withdraw from the study.

6.1. Analysis Populations  
The ITT population consists of those subjects who have signed the Informed Consent Form  and 
had the LIFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent  catheter introduced (i.e. , delivery system enters the 
subject’s body).  
 
Subjects who do not receive the study implant (section 5.2.2), but the L IFESTREAM ™ Covered 
Stent catheter was introduced will be included in the ITT population.  Subjects who need more than two ( 2) L
IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stents  (section 5.2.3) or undergo other treatment modalities 
(section 5.2.4) will be included in the ITT population.  A per -protocol (PP) population may be created if there are subjects who have any major protocol 
deviations . Major Protocol Deviations are defined as those that occur to protect the life or 
physical well -being of a subject in an emergency, or those that may affect the scientific 
soundness of the study, or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects .  The PP population 
will consist of any subjects in the ITT population who do not have any major protocol 
deviations , including deviations of study eligibility criteria .  Subjects who do not receive the 
study implant (section 5.2.2), but the L
IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent catheter was introduced will 
be included in the PP population.  Subjects who need more than two (2) L IFESTREAM ™ Covered 
Stents and require placement of a commercially -available stent (section 5.2.3), or undergo other 
treatment modalities (sec tion 5.2.4) will be excluded from the PP population.   
 All effectiveness and safety analyses including the primary analysis will be primarily based on the ITT population. A PP analysis may also be performed for the primary endpoint. It will only serve as a sensitivity analysis for the primary analysis which is based on the ITT population.  
 6.2. Primary Endpoint : Study Hypothesis  
 The primary endpoint of the study is a composite safety and effectiveness measure defined as device and/or procedure -related  death or MI through 30 days or any TLR , target limb(s) major 
amputation, or restenosis through 9 months post -index procedure.  
 The BOLSTER study is a single -arm study of treated subjects receiving the L
IFESTREAM ™ 
Covered Stent compared to a PG  derived from published literature  of stents  for the treatment of 
iliac artery stenosi s/occlusion. Specifically, the PG rate was derived as 19.5%. 
 The primary endpoint will be evaluated by the following hypothesis:  
 H
0: The proportion of subjects in the L IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent  group (P BBX) with events in 
the primary endpoint is greate r than  or equal to that of the PG of 19.5%.  
 H
1: The proportion of subjects in the L IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent  group (P BBX) with events in 
the primary endpoint is less than that of the PG of 19.5%.

A one-sided p- value will be derived based on an exact binomial test. The study device will be 
considered to have achieved the primary objective if the one -sided p- value is less than 0.0335 at 
interim analysis or 0.0325 at final analysis (see section 6.8) .  
 
6.3. Assessment of Poolability of Sites  
 
The sites will be tested for potential differences in the primary endpoint.  Sites with fewer than 
10 treated subjects will  be combined for this purpose. The pooling will be restricted within 
country.  The sites with les s than 10 treated subjects will be sorted by site number within each 
country and pooled by order to form one or more combined site(s) with at least 10 treated 
subjects. A logistic regression analysis will be performed with sites as a fixed  effect . If the p -
value associated with the sites effect is < 0.15, it will be considered as evidence of statistical significance.  
 If there are any site effects, the sites that have similar and dissimilar results will be grouped and exploratory analyses will be performed to investigate the potential reason for the differences among sites.  An analysis will be performed to examine the potential difference in the primary endpoint between the two geographic regions (US vs. OUS).  A logistic regression model will be fit that includes fixed effect for geography.  If the p- value of the geography effect is <0.15, it will be 
considered evidence of a statistically significant difference between the geographic regions, and additional analyses will be performed to explore the differen ces between geographies to assess 
their potential causes and whether or not they are clinically meaningful.  Additionally, an analysis will be performed to explore the potential difference in the primary endpoint between males and females.  If the p- value of the gender effect is <0.15, it will be 
considered evidence of a statistically significant difference between the males and females.  
 6.4. Evaluation of Secondary Endpoints  
 
The following secondary endpoints are intended to be reported in the device’s labeling and will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Kaplan -Meier survival analysis of the time to events 
will also be performed. The details of the definition of the secondary endpoints are described in Section 3.2.

subgroups : 
 
− Common iliac artery vs. external iliac artery  
− Stenosis vs. occlusion 
− TASC categories  
− Unilateral vs. bilateral disease  
− Gender  
 
This information is intended to be reported in the device’s labeling and will be summariz ed using 
descriptive statistics.  
 
6.6. Handling of Missing Data 
 
Study endpoints may be missing due to withdrawal of consent, investigator’s decision, lost to 
follow -up and death. As long as the missing data is unrelated to the study intervention and the 
observed and unobserved data, limiting the analysis to those subjects who contribute endpoints produces unbiased estimates of the event rates.  
 Additionally, Kaplan- Meier survival analyses will be performed to estimate the event rates at 
various t ime-points. In survival analyses, unobserved endpoints are a standard part of the 
analysis. They are known as censored observations.  The reason for missing data for all subjects will be reported.  If there is any indication that missing data is related to the study intervention , a worst -case analysis may be performed in 
addition to the standard analysis.  In a worst -case analysis, a failure of effectiveness  or safety 
will be assumed to have occurred at the time the subject was censored.  
 In addit ion, regardless of whether missing data are related to the study intervention, a tipping-
point analysis will be performed, in which assumptions about missing data are varied from worst -case to best -case to examine at what point the missing data would alter  the results of the 
analysis.  
 6.7. Sample Size Determinations  
 
The sample size calculation  assumes the following:  
 
1. The L IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent composite event rate is estimated at 10.5%  
 
2. The PG is set at 19.5%

3. The Type 1 error, α  = 0.05 (one -sided).  
 
4. The Type 2 error, β  = 0.10 (Power = 1 - β = 90%).  
 
The calculated sample size is 1 39 subjects  to be followed through the 9- month follow -up visit  
(using nQuery 7.0) .  To accommodate 10% censoring, the sample size is  increased to 1 54.   
 Note, Bard estimates that 50% of consented subjects will not meet the eligibility criteria (e.g., 
Screen Failures), and therefore will not enter the analysis population.  The estimated consented 
population will therefore be 308 [154 * 2 = 308] .  
 6.8. Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis will be performed when all of the  first 103 enrolled subject s (at two third s of 
the originally planned sample size) either complete  the 9 -month visits or discontinued from the 
study.  The primary analysis at interim will be based on the first 103 enrolled subjects  and no 
others whether or not there are additional subjects who may have completed their 9- month visits 
or discontinued at the time .  
The linear alpha spending function will be used to control for the overall study- wise type I error 
rate of 0.05 (Proschan et al, 2006, Chapter 5 and 14)
24. The null hypothesis will be rejected at 
interim based on n=103 (93 evaluable) if the one -sided p- value is less than 0.0335 (calculated by 
R package ldbounds). If unsuccessful at interim, the null hypothesis will be rejected based on n=154 (139 evaluable) if the one -sided p -value is less than 0.0325 (calculated by R package 
ldbounds). 
 
A simulation study ( Table 2 ) was performed to evaluate the operatin g characteristics of the 
procedure  described above. Based on 100,000 simulations, the probability of achieving success 
at the interim analysis, the overall power of study (i.e., the probability of achieving success either at interim or at final analysis), and the probability of achieving success at interim but failing the final analysis were estimated with various assumptions of the composite event rate , including 
under the null hypothesis . Additionally, study power without an interim analysis was estimated  
as well  for each of the scenarios.

6.5%  96.0%  99.9%  <0.1%  99.9%  
 
 When data were simulated under the null hypothesis, i.e., the composite event rate is 19.5%, there is a risk of 1.8% that the null hypothesis will be rejected falsely at interim and an overall false positive risk of 3.8%, which is below the study- wise type  I error rate of 0.05.  
 When data were simulated under the alternative hypothesis, e.g., if the true composite event rate is 10.5% as originally assumed in the sample size calculation, there is a 61.3% chance the study 
will meet its primary objective at interim with two thirds  of the planned sample size and a risk of 
1.0% of failing the final analysis after declaring success at interim. By adding the interim analysis, the overall power of the study dec reases slightly to 87.1% from the original designed 
90% power.  However, if the true composite event rate is a fe w percentage points better than  
originally assumed, for example at 8.5%, there is a 83.5% chance the study will declare success 
at interim and the overall power of the study is 97.5% with very little risk of achieving success at interim but failing at final analysis.  
 The simulation results show that the proposed interim analysis can potentially achieve study 
success faster with two thirds of  the planned sample size, particularly if the true composite event 
rate is lower than originally assumed. It is unlikely that a final analysis would fail after success is 
achieved at interim. The added interim analysis may  cause some loss of overall study power, but 
the amount of loss is small.  
 
 
7. CLINICAL EVENT REPORTING  
 
The Principal Investigator (PI), or authorized designee, is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria and definitions  set forth in Section 7.1.  Collection 
of these events  will begin immediately following subject enrollment (events occurring prior to 
becoming a treated subject as defined in 5.2.2 will be documented as medical history) , during the 
index procedure  through final subject follow -up visit or early termination . 
 7.1. Definitions of Events  
 7.1.1. Adverse Events  
 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in s ubjects, users or other persons, 
whether or not related to study device [ ISO14155:2011(E) ].  A list of possible complications 
and/or risks of the s tudy device is outlined in Section 9.

BOLSTER  (BPV -12-001) Version 3.0  
Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc.  7.1.2. Adverse Device Effect  
 
An Adverse Device Effect (ADE) is an AE related to the use of the L IFESTREAM ™ Covered 
Stent .  This includes AEs resulting from insufficient or inadequate IFU, deployment, 
implantation, installation, or operation, or any malfunction of the L IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent .  
Additionally, this definition includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional 
misuse of the L IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent . 
 
7.1.3. Serious Adverse Events  
 
Each AE will be assessed to determine whether it is serious or non- serious.   
(NOTE:  The term serious is not synonymous with severity, which may be used to describe the intens ity of an event experienced by the subject.).  
 An SAE is an AE that:  
1) led to a death  
2) led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either resulted in:  
a) a life -threatening illness or injury, or  
b) a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or  
c) in-patient or prolonged hospitalization, or  
d) medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function 
3) led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenit al abnormality or birth defect  
Note:  Planned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition, or a procedure require d by this study 
(including subsequent TLR/TVRs assessed in the study endpoints) , without serious deterioration 
in health, is not considered an SAE [ISO14155:2011(E)].   
 
7.1.4. Serious Adverse Device Effect or Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect  
 
A Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE) is an ADE that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of an SAE.  
 An Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE/USADE) is any (serious) adverse 
device effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated 
with, a study device , in which by its nature, incidence, severity, or outcome has not been 
identified in the current version of the risk analysis report, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety or welfare of subjects.  
 UADEs/USADEs will be reported to FDA as requir ed by 21 CFR Part 812, and to the 
appropriate governing body per ISO 14155:2011(E). 
 
7.2. Severity of Adverse Events  
 
Each AE should be assessed for its severity, or the intensity of an event, experienced by the subject.

Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc.  − Mild:  Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere with the subject’s activity 
or is transient and is resolved without treatment or sequelae.  
− Moderate:   May interfere with the subject’s activity and require additional intervention 
and/or treatment, and may have additional sequelae. 
− Severe:  Significant discomfort to the subject and/or interferes with the subject’s activity.  
Additional intervention and or treatment are necessary.  Additional sequelae occur.   
 
 7.3. Relationship of Adverse Event to Device(s)/Procedure  
 Investigators will assess each AE /SAE  for its relationship to the study device ( L
IFESTREAM ™ 
Covered Stent ) or procedure as follows . 
 
1) Assess each AE for its relationship to the device or procedure as follows:  
 
− Device(s) Related: This category should be rest ricted to AEs directly attributable to the 
study device( s) used as part of the index procedure. 
− Procedure Related : A procedure includes any activity performed during the index 
procedure . 
 
2) The following categories should be used for assigning the certainty of the relatedness:  
 
− Definitely Related :  An AE is definitely related if it is obvious, certain or there is little 
doubt regarding the relationship. 
− Possibly Related :  An AE is possibly related if it is capable of being related but 
relatively unl ikely  or there insufficient information to determine if the AE is related to the 
device or procedure.  
− Not Related :  An AE is not related if it is determined that there is no plausible 
association.  
 7.4. Reporting of Events  
 
All AEs  determined to be unrelated to the device/procedure, or non -serious, should be recorded 
on the appropriate eCRF.   
The procedure for reporting device/procedure -related  AEs/SAEs or UADEs/USADEs is as 
follows.    
− All sections of the appropriate eCRF must be completed . 
− Device/procedure- related AEs/ SAEs, SADEs, or UADEs/USADEs must be reported to 
Bard within one (1) business day of the site becoming aware of the event(s).  
o De-identified copies of all relevant documentati on (i.e., procedure reports, 
physician/nurses notes, discharge summary, etc.) should be submitted to Bard, as appropriate.

7.4.1. Subject Death  
Subject death, for any reason during the study, must be reported to Bard within one (1) business 
day of the site becoming aware of the event.  
 
Notification of subject death may include email, phone, or fax to Bard.  All available medical 
records related to the subject’s death must be maintained.   7.5. Safety Committees  
 
7.5.1. Data Safety Monitoring Board  
 The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  will be comprised of at least 4 members 
(biostatistician, interventional radiologist, interventional cardiologist, and vascular surgeon) who  
are not directly involved in the conduct of the study.  The DSMB is responsible for independently overseeing inter im safety and effectiveness analyses as described in the clinical 
protocol, or as recommended by the FDA or other regulatory authority.  The DSMB will independently conduct evaluations of subject safety during the trial and make recommendations that the tr ial be continued, amended, or terminated to prevent new or additional SAEs to study 
subjects.  
 7.5.2. Clinical Events Committee  and Medical Monitor 
 
The CEC  will be comprised of at least 2 members  (interventional radiologist s, interventional 
cardiologist s, or vascular surgeons ) who are not directly involved in the conduct of the study.  
The CEC is responsible for the development of specific criteria used for the categorization of clinical events and clinical endpoints in the study, as determin ed by the CEC charter . 
 The Medical Monitor (MM) will be responsible for reviewing adjudicated events for AE  
trends.  7.5.3. Safety Committee Procedures  
 The CEC  will review all complications and AEs during the study.  The CEC  will have access to 
the eCRFs associated with reported AEs for each subject.  Bard will forward all associated relevant documents (e.g., cath lab reports, physician notes, operative reports, etc.) to the CEC upon request.  
 The committees  will meet at time intervals specified in their  respective charter .  The CEC will 
forward an adjudication report of AEs to Bard in a timely fashion.  The DSMB will forward a “report of recommendations” following each DSMB meeting to Bard in a timely fashion. 
 
When appropriate, conference calls between Bard  and members of the committees  will 
commence to discuss reported complications and AE details, and to determine whether the study

Bard will ensure that appropriate information is provided to the FDA, the Investigators, and all reviewing IRB /EC’ s.   
 8. DEVICE DEFICIENCY 
 The Investigator will record any device deficiencies on the appropriate eCRF.  A device deficiency has occurred if a study device used in the study procedure failed to meet its performance specifications w hether due to mechanical failure, malfunction, or defect s.  Device 
deficiencies also include errors and inadequate labeling.    This applies to:  
− Study devices used in the subject; or  
− Study devices in which the catheter package was opened, but the device was not used for catheterizing the subject; or  
− Study devices with which insertion attempts were made, but the study device did not remain (was not used) in the subject. 
All mechanical failures, malfunctions, and defects of the study devices will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page and will be promptly reported to Bard.  The device(s) should be returned to Bard as outlined in the site regulatory binder . 
 If the device deficiency was associated with an AE, the reporting provisions for AEs, ADEs, 
SAEs, SADEs and UADEs/USADEs as outlined in Section 7 above apply.  
 Any device deficiency that did not lead to an AE but could have led to a n SADE, if suitable  
action had not be en taken, if intervention had not been made, or if circumstances had been less 
fortunate, must be reported to Bard  within one (1) business day of the event per Section 7.4. 
 It is the responsibility of the Investigator to notify the IRB/EC of such device deficiencies in accordance with the IRB/EC and/or the Competent Authority’s local regulations.  9. RISK/BENEFIT ANALYSIS  
 The potential benefits that may result from treatment with the L
IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent may 
include:    
− A low incidence of device and/or procedure -related  death or MI through 30 days or any 
TLR , target limb(s) major amputation,  or restenosis through 9 months post -index 
procedure .   
 
The risks associated with the use of the L
IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent have been identified by 
performing a Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (DFMEA) on the system.  At the completion of the DFMEA, a Risk Analysis was generated to summarize the risk analysis process and provide documented evidence that the risks associ ated with the study device are

12. MONITORING AND AUDITING  
The study monitors are designated as agents of Bard and are assigned to oversee the conduct and 
progress of the study and to be the principal communication link between Bard and the Investigator.  The study monitors may assist in pre -qualifying potential s ites.  The study monitors 
will periodically conduct on- site inspection and monitoring of sites and records, to ensure 
continued compliance with this protocol and adequacy of the Investigator and the site to conduct the study.  In addition, the monitor will  verify that the study device is being used in accordance 
with the protocol instructions.  The monitor will perform several types of site visits during the course of the study.  
 The sites may also be subject to a quality assurance audit by personnel of Ba rd (and its 
affiliates), as well as FDA representatives and other applicable authorities .   
 It is important that the Investigator(s) and the relevant site personnel are available during the monitoring visits, and possible audits, and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.  
 12.1. Site Initiation Visits  
 
Before the study begins, the study monitors conduct a Site Initiation Visit (SIV).  The purpose of this visit is to review with the Investigator(s) and staff, the provisions and proper conduct of this study.  This visit will include a detailed review of this protocol, verification that all necessary documents are on file at the site, and confirmation of IRB /EC approvals.

Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc.  12.2. Ongoing Monitoring Visits  
 
The study monitor will maintain personal contact wit h the Investigator and staff throughout the 
study by telephone, e -mail, fax, mail, and on- site visits.  On -site monitoring will begin at each 
site after the first subject is enrolled and will continue until the study is completed.  The study monitor will c onfirm that the ICF used is the version approved by the IRB /EC, confirm the  
applicable national privacy laws have been followed (e.g., confirm the  presence of a signed 
HIPAA release in the U.S.) , verify that all necessary documents are on file at the site,  and 
confirm that there are provisions to continue and maintain all documents and records throughout the study as required by FDA regulations.  These monitoring visits will assess continued protocol compliance, adequate subject enrollment, accurate data reporting (including the comparison and 
100% verification of eCRFs with subject records  for critical fields ), monitoring of subject safety 
through identification and/or review of any device -related AEs, UADEs, or SAEs, device 
accountability, continued maintenance and calibration of study- specific equipment (if 
applicable),  and continued IRB /EC acceptance of the st udy.  The study monitor will evaluate and 
summarize the results of each visit in written reports, identifying any ongoing data or compliance problems with any site and specifying recommendations for resolution of noted deficiencies.  
 12.3. Final Monitoring Visit  
 At the completion of the study, the study monitor will conduct a final on- site visit.  The purpose 
of this visit is to collect all outstanding study documents, confirm that the Investigator’s files are accurate and complete, review the record retention r equirements with the Investigator, provide 
for the return of unused devices to Bard, review records which account for device shipments, and ensure that all applicable requirements for closure of the study are met.  The actions and 
observations made at this  visit will be recorded and filed.  
 13. TRAINING  
 In addition to each Investigator and appropriate site personnel being trained on this protocol and study procedures during the SIV, device training will be provided by Bard and is required for each Investigator.  Sub- Investigator(s) will also require devic e training provided from Bard, or 
proctored by the PI.  The Investigator  (or designee)  may also train additional site personnel, as 
required and agreed upon by Bard.  All training will be documented and filed at the site and with Bard.  The Investigators participating in this study will have had substantial experience previously performing PTA and stent placement procedures for the treatment of iliac occlusive disease.  The delivery and deployment of the L
IFESTREAM ™ Covered Stent  is not vastly 
different tha n other commercially -available balloon- expandable stent and covered stent  systems; 
therefore, roll -in subjects will not be required for this study.  
 14. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 The Investigator must comply with 21 CRF Part 812.150 (a)  and ISO 14155:2011(E) , and must 
promptly report to Bard all progress, annual, and final reports and any withdrawal of IRB /EC 
approval at the site.   At a minimum, the Investigator shall inform Bard of the following events

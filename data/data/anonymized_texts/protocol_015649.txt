Amendment 4 ( 09 FEB 2023)
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) 
of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.
Overall rationale for Amendment 4: 
A description of changes and a brief rationale is o utlined in the table at the end of this section.  
An overview is given below.
Clarification of dose -titration instructions
Clear blood pressure limits were added to t he titration instructions to provide more precise 
guidance on when to maintain and not increase the dose .This amendment is expected to 
improve participant’s safety  and to result in more consistent titration decisions across sites .
In addition ,two dose reductions are now permissible instead of a single dose reduction .
This change is conside red substantial as it has effects on participant’s safety.
Primary endpoint a fter48 weeks instead of after 24 weeks of treatment
2-step DRSS improvement is the main efficacy  endpoint in this clinical study . Assessments 
are planned after 12,24, and 48 weeks of treatment. The assessment after 24 weeks was 
initially  defined as the primary  endpoint . However , information was received from other 
clinical trials in non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy , that achiev ing2-step DRSS 
improvement in a sufficient number of stud y participants may take lo nger than 24 weeks for 
most drugs not administered b y intravitreal injection (e.g. ROBIN trial [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 
discussed in (Boyer et al. 2021 ).To provide sufficient time for the treatment effect ,the 
primary  assessment of this endpoint is moved to 48 weeks of treatment. Up to the date of this 
amendment , on-treatment DRSS assessments were not transferred from the central reading 
center into the stud y database, they were not seen by the sponsor nor by  the independent data 
monitoring committee , in agreement with study  procedures . No interim assessment was 
performed until now. Thus, no efficacy  data from the present study  were reviewed and the 
decision for this amendment was solel y driven b y general considerations triggered b y 
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 4 (Global)

information received from other clinical trials in diabetic retinopath y. Based on these 
considerations ,a power adjustment is not deemed necessary .
This change to the primary  endpoint assessment is considered subs tantial.

Section 9.4.3.1 EfficacyThe primary DRSS assessment was 
moved to 48 weeks of treatment.Information was received from other 
clinical trials in non -proliferative diabetic 
retinopathy, that achieving 2 -step DRSS 
improvement in a sufficient number of 
study participants may take longer than 
24 weeks for most drugs not administered 
by intravitreal injection (e.g. ROBIN trial 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED], discusse din(Boyer et al. 
2021 ). To increase the probability of a 
successful clinical trial, the primary 
assessment of this endpoint is moved to 
48 weeks of treatment

dose -titration decisions 
Section 7.1.3 Re -challenge / 
re-start of study interventionThe dose -titrations instruction was 
specified by providing minimum 
blood pressure requirements for 
dose titration.This amendment is expected to 
improve participant’s safety and to 
result in more consistent titration 
decisions across sites.
(substantial amendment)
Section 6.5.1 Intra -individual 
dose -titration decisions Up to two (instead of only one) dose 
reductions are permissibleAllowing only a single dose reduction 
and imposing permanent treatment 
discontinuation in case a single dose 
reduction does not sufficiently improve 
tolerability may result in undue early 
treatment discontinuations and reduce 
the power of the clinical tria l
Section 7.1.1 Permanent 
discontinuationIf study intervention is permanently 
discontinued, an End -of-Treatment 
visit should be performed in line 
with Visit 15 . The participant 
remains in the study for continued 
assessment of study outcomes 
following the visit schedule in 
section 1.3.Clarification of the visit schedule for 
study intervention permanent 
discontinuation

Section # 
and NameDescription of Change Brief Rationale
Section 7.1.1 Permanent 
discontinuationWithdrawal from trial is no longer 
mandatory, in case of vision 
threatening complication or 
progression to PDR, but to be 
decided case by case by the 
investigator.There is no safety concern with 
continuing treatment after a vision 
threatening complication.  Continued 
treatment may be beneficial. Therefore, 
treatment discontinuation is not 
mandatory in general but to be 
considered case by case by the 
investigator.
Clarif ications and corrections (non -substantial)
Section # 
and NameDescription of Change Brief Rationale
Section 1.3 Schedule of 
activities (SoA)Footnotes were added to clarify the 
timepoint s for safety, blood 
sampling and ophthalmology 
examinations. Clarification of sequence of activities
Section 1.3 Schedule of 
activities (SoA) Administer study intervention (after 
blood draws) was removed at Visit 
15 EoT. Dispensation of urine 
pregnancy test was added at Visit 
12. 7 -field color fundus 
photography (DRSS) was removed 
at Visit 8.Corrections of mistakes:
Assessing DRSS assessment after 
8weeks of treatment in addition to after 
12 weeks of treatment cannot be 
expected to provide relevant additional 
data.  
Section 7.1.2 Temporary 
discontinuationIf the re -assessed laboratory result 
indicates a decrease in eGFR 
<40%from baseline, study 
intervention may be re -started at 
the same dose as before this 
temporary discontinuation, in line 
with section 7.1.3 .  Clarification on re -starting study 
intervention

1. Protocol summary
1.1 Synopsis
Protocol title:
A Phase 2 randomized, placebo -controlled, double -masked proof -of-concept study  to 
investigate the efficacy  and safet y of runcaciguat (BAY 1101042) in patients with moderatel y 
severe to severe non -proliferative diabetic retinopathy  
Brief title:  Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy treated with runcaciguat
Overall study plan :
Study  20739 is aPhase 2 proof-of-concept study that includes a subpart with PK/PD 
assessments (Part 1). Part 1 enrolls a subset of patients at a more intense investigation in 
specific stud y sites . Part 2 is the main PoC part, to be conducted in ophthalmology  sites, that 
enrolls the majority  of participants. PoC will be based on the evaluation of outcomes in 
participants from both parts.
Ratio nale:
Results from previous Phase 1 studies in health y as well as renall y impaired patients as well 
as a phase 2 stud y with patients with chronic kidney  disease have demonstrated that 
runcaciguat given as modified -release oral tablets was well tolerated an d support the start of 
further studies in patients. 
Due to the mode of action of sGC activators, and based on preclinical data, it is assumed that 
sGC activators, administered to NPDR patients, can positively  influence retinal perfusion and 
thereb y improv e fundus morphology  and reduce the progression of retinal ischemia and 
vision -threatening later stages like PDR and/or DME .
The present stud y is to be conducted to obtain information on sGC activators by investigating 
1.whether runcaciguat improves the diab etic retinopathy  score in patients with 
moderatel y severe to severe NPDR
and to
2.explore the pharmacokinetic -pharmacod ynamic relationship of runcaciguat on retinal 
perfusion
The results are intended to provide useful information to improve the design of clinical studies 
with subsequent sGC activators , for example b y supporting the choice of the appropriate dose 
and treatment duration .

Characterize pharmacodynamic effects of 
runcaciguat in patients with NPDROther endpoints
Central retinal thickness
HbA1c
Serum lipoproteins
Characterize pharmacokinetics of 
runcaciguat in patients with NPDRPopulation pharmacokinetics 
Pre-dose (trough) plasma concentrations of runcaciguat by visit 
DRSS = Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale; N PDR = Non -proliferative diabetic retinopathy; 
Overall design :
This is a randomized , double -masked parallel study  with two study  arms enrolling N=98 
patients with non -proliferative diabetic retinopathy.  The study  is conducted as a 
placebo -controlled study ,for details see Section 6.3.
Total treatment duration is 48weeks .The primary  endpoint will be the number of 
participants with a ≥ 2-step improvement (reduction) in the DRSS after 4 8weeks of treatment
in the study  eye. 
A steering committee consisting of ophthalmologists and diabetologists (masked) is put in 
place to provide scientific and operational recommendations to the study  protocol and may be 
consulted to support decisions in study  conduct.  A n independent Data Monitoring Committee 
is set up to provide recommendations based on unmasked review of data ,if needed.
Brief summary :
This Phase 2 study  is conducted to determine whether runcaciguat , administered at once dail y 
oral doses of a modified -release formulation, is more effective in treating NPDR than placebo .

The study comprises two subparts , 1(PK/PD) and 2(proof of concept) ; both subparts will be 
conducted in parallel .
To assess the efficacy ,the retinal morphology  will be investigated b y 7-field color fundus 
photograph y (CFP)supported by  7 Field FA images for the assessment of the DRSS by a 
central reading center. Two-step DRSS improvement at 48weeks of treatment will be the 
primary  efficacy  endpoint. Additional DRSS assessments ar edone after 12 and 24 week s of 
treatment .In addition, vision -threatening complications will be recorded throughout the stud y 
and assessed as secondary  efficacy  endpoint . 
During the course of the study , 16 visits are planned , including the screening visit (Visit 1) 
and the end-of-study  visit (Visit 16).  Visit intervals are weekl y during the first 4 weeks, 
whilethe dose of runcaciguat (or placebo) is titrated to the target dose , then fortnightl y for the 
next 4 weeks and then every  4 weeks up to Week 25(Visit 12).  The subse quent visits ,up to 
end of treatment in Week 49(Visit 15),will be at 8 -week intervals .  The end-of-study  visit , 
Visit 16, will take place 4 weeks later. 
Number of participants :
Acombined total of a pproximately  98 participants for Part 1and 2will be randomly  assigned 
for an estimated total of ≥40participants per intervention group evaluable for primary  
endpoint assessment , as defined in Section 9.2.  The estimated screen failure rate is 
approximately  50%.
Intervention groups and duration :
Participants are randomly  assigned to one of two study  arms.  Assignment will be masked , as 
detailed in Section 6.3. After providing informed consent, participants will be screened (Visit 
1) and within up to 4 weeks, eligible participants will be randomized and treatment will be 
initiated at Visit 2 .  During the initial four weeks, treatment will be titrated to the target dose 
of 120 mg runcaciguat or matching placebo . Treatment will start a t 30 mg runcaciguat or 
placebo once dail y for the first w eek. If well tolerated, the dose will be increased to 60 mg 
runcaciguat or placebo at Visit 3 in the second week of treatment , then to 90 mg runcaciguat 
or placebo at Visit 4 in the third week of treatment , and finally  to 120 mg runcaciguat or 
placebo at Visit 5. 
In case of intolerability  (see Section 6.5.1 ) treatment may  continue without up-titration or the 
dose may  be reduced by one titration step.
Treatment will con tinue at the highest tolerated dose until completion of 48weeks of 
treatment if tolerated ,or until development of a vision threatening complication or 
development of PDR .
An end -of-study  visit will be performed 4weeks after end of treatment . This includes both 
participants who complete the planned treatment period ,andparticipants wh o discontinue 
treatment early including treatment discontinuation due to vision threatening complications .

2. Introduction
As of amendment 3, this Section and its sub -sections were integrated from Master Protocol. 
Runcaciguat (BAY 1101042) is a representative from a new class of drugs, the solub le 
guan ylate cy clase (sGC) activators.  The sponsor is developing sGC activators for the 
treatment of microangiopathies, namel y chronic kidney disease (CKD) and non -proliferative 
diabetic retinopath y (NPDR).  For both indications, proof -of-concept studies are currently  
ongoing, one being the NEON -NPDR study .  
For the NPDR indication, the treatment is intended to 
Prevent progression of diabetic retinopath y and vision -threatening complications
Reverse retinal changes attributed to diabetic retinopathy
Maint ain visual acuity .

Runcaciguat will be investigated in a formulation of modified -release (MR) tablets, which 
result in peak plasma concentrations at approximately 10 hours post dose and a peak -to-trough 
concentration ratio of 2:1.  The terminal half -life o f runcaciguat in plasma ranged from 
approximately  14 to 21 hours in healthy  study  participants.
Runcaciguat, given as MR tablets, showed vasodilatory effects at doses from 20 mg to 90 mg 
once dail y without clinically relevant signs of hemodynamic intolerance.  Once -daily  doses up 
to the highest investigated dose of 90 mg administered over 7 days were safe and well 
tolerated by healthy participants.  
Other indications under development for runcaciguat include chronic kidney disease.  
Aclinical study  in pat ients with chronic kidney  disease (CONCORD stud y 18748; EudraCT: 
2019-003297- 53) started in 2020 and is ongoing in parallel.  In that study , patients are treated 
with once -daily doses of runcaciguat titrated up to 120 mg.  The current recruitment status is
summarized in Section 2.3.1 . 
Further information on pre- clinical and available clinical data relevant in the context of this 
study  are provided and discussed in Section 2.3. Additional information is given in the most 
recent version of the IB.  
2.1 Study rationale
The clinical development of runcaciguat so far has show nthat the compound is well tolerated. 
However, formulation challenges lead to aninconvenient dosing regimen and a difficult to 
manage suppl y chain.  
 
 
The Sponsor plans to run the NEON- NPDR study  with runcaciguat as a PoC trial for sGC 
activators in NPDR. Although the sGC activator runcaciguat will not be further developed, the 
results from this trial will generate a general PoC for sGC activation in NPDR using a 
investigational compound that has proven its activity  in nonclinical and in phase 1 clinical 
trials and that has been shown to be well tolerated.  
In addition, detailed pharmacokinetic and pharmacody namic assessments will be performed 
on a subset of participants enrolled in Part 1.  The resulting improved PK/PD understanding 
will facilitate the translation of the results obtained with t he runcaciguat to other sGC 
activators.
Therefore, this trial will be the basis for a general decision on the suitability of sGC activat ors
for treatment of NPDR .  In the positive case, this may  optim ize the development of 
subsequent sGC activators . In particular the data will facilitate the choice of the appropriate 
dose-range and the choice of the most appropriate treatment duration. This knowledge will 
result in safer and more focused clinical trials with the follow -up compound .

2.2 Background
2.2.1 Disease background
The prevalence of diabetic retinopath y (DR) approximates 35% among people with diabetes 
worldwide (Yau et al. 2012 ).  Diabetic retinopathy  ranks fifth among common causes for 
blindness or severe vision impairment, and the prevalence of DR -related blindness will 
increase due to increasing p revalence of diabetes (Leasher et al. 2016 ). 
Diabetic retinopath y is characterized b y progressive changes in the retinal microvasculature 
with accompan ying neuroglial damage (Santiago et al. 2018 ).Pathognomonic changes consist 
of microaneury smsand soft exudates, macular edema, and neovascularization.  I n addition, 
other retinal cell ty pes are affected b y diabetes and may compromise or contribute to visual 
impairment.  
Predicting progression of mild -and moderate -NPDR to PDR has been evaluated at the group 
level but is still not well established at the individual level (ETDRS report number 10 1991 ).  
HbA1c, h ypertensive status and hyperlipidemia are all factors routinel y used in screening in 
many  European countries (Aspelund et a l. 2011 , Lund et al. 2016 , van der Heijden et al. 
2014 ), they  poorl y predict progression of non -proliferative retinopathy . According to Sato et 
al (Sato et al. 2001 ),baseline severit y of diabetic retinopathy is a better predictor of clinical 
outcomes. Cunha -Vaz et al. (Cunha -Vaz et al. 2017 )proposed an evolution model to PDR 
which is based on microaneury sms and retinal features, classify ing patients into 3 risk 
phenoty pes, disregarding HbA1c or other metabolic parameters.
Oxidative stress play s a key  role in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy .  Reactive oxy gen 
species (ROS) are increased in the retina in diabetes, at the same time the antioxidant defense 
system is also compromised.  Increas ed ROS stimulate the release of pro -inflammatory  cyto-
kines, promoting a chronic low -grade inflammation involving various signaling pathway s.  An 
excessive production of ROS can lead to retinal endothelial cell injury , increased 
microvascular permeability ,and recruitment of inflammatory  cells at the site of inflammation 
(Santiago et al. 2018 ).
2.2.2 The role of soluble guanylyl cyclase in diabetic retinopathy
Under ph ysiological conditions ( Figure 2–1A), endothelial (eNOS) and neuronal nitric oxide 
synthase (nNOS) are expressed by  retinal cells and prod uce nitric oxide (NO) in small 
(nanomolar) amounts to activate the soluble forms of guan ylyl cyclase (sGC).  Active sGC 
catal yzesthe synthesis of cGMP from GTP.  The classical effects of the NO -sGC-cGMP axis 
are vasodilation, regulation of blood flow, inhibition of platelet aggregation and suppression 
of leukocy te adhesion and migration (Lehners et al. 2018 ).
Under pathological conditions, such as DR, (Figure 2–1B),cytokine -inducible NOS (iNOS) 
is expressed.  iNOS is expressed in macrophages, microglia, glial cells, neurons, and vascular 
cells of the retina.  iNOS differs from eNOS and nNOS as it produces NO in large 
(micromolar) amounts.  Excess NO binding to superoxide results in peroxynitrite formation.  
Perox ynitrite oxidizes the sGC enzy me, which loses its heme -moiety , making it unresponsive 
to NO (Stasch e t al. 2011 ).As a result, cGMP production is reduced and a vicious circle of 
oxidative stress within the retina is initiated that drives the progression of diabetic retinopath y 
(Förstermann 2010 ).

Figure 2–1Cillustrates that the s GC activator runcaciguat (BAY 1101042) targets the nitric 
oxide -insensitive states of the sGC enzyme.  Runcaciguat binds to the unoccupied heme -
binding complex or displaces the prosthetic heme of sGC and produces an additive effect with 
NO.  In certain cas es, sGC activators also protect sGC from proteasomal degradation.  This 
restores the NO -sGC-cGMP axis functions.  I t improves retinal blood flow by  vascular 
vasodilation through relaxation of smooth muscles, inhibits platelet aggregation and inhibited 
leukocyte adhesion.  This leads to better neurovascular unit function neurotransmission and, 
subsequently , slows the disease progression.

2.2.3 Runcaciguat
Runcaciguat is a sGC activator that improved function and retinal structure in pre -clinical DR 
models.  I npatients with NPDR, runcaciguat is expe cted to improve retinal perfusion and 
thereb y reverse changes in fundus morphology attributable to diabetic retinopathy and reduce 
the incidence of vision -threatening events and lower the risk of progression to proliferative 
diabetic retinopath y.
2.3 Benefit/ risk assessment
Based on the expected low risk of study  participation, discussed below in Section 2.3.1 , and in 
view of the potential benefit that may result from successful development of a drug improving 
NPDR and preventing complications as discussed below in Section 2.3.2 , the benefit -risk 
assess ment of this study  with runcaciguat is considered positive and supportive of the 
participation of patients with NPDR in this clinical trial.
Emerging safet y issues affecting the benefit/risk assessment of the study will be 
communicated as soon as possible between the sponsor, all study  sites and investigators and 
trial participants according to the requirements of the EMA guideline on strategies to identify  
risks for early  clinical trials and including first in human studies.

2.3.1 Risk assessment
Risks associated with study interventions –Runcaciguat
Runcaciguat was well tolerated b y health y male participants up to a single oral dose of 20 mg 
given as IR tablet.  This IR tablet resulted in maximum plasma concentrations at 
approximately  30minutes post dose (t max 0.5hours).  A 30 mg IR tablet dose was not well 
tolerated based on the exaggerated vasodilative effects.  These findings were attributed to the 
fast increase in plasma concentrations, as reflected by  a high peak -to-trough ratio of > 8:1.  
When administering as MR tablets with a t max of approximately  10hours, as planned in this 
clinical trial, mild vasodilative effects, indicated by a compensatory  heart rate increase were 
observed at doses of 20 mg and above in healthy  study  participants. Aconsistent decrease of 
blood pressure was observed at doses of 50 mg and above and no signs of hemody namic 
intolerance were apparent up to 90 mg once daily , the highest dose investigated.  Therefore, 
the MR -tablet formulation was chosen for further clin ical development.  Hence, unless 
specified otherwise, an y further mention of runcaciguat tablets in this document refers to the 
MR formulation.
Different drug classes introduced in clinical practice increase cGMP concentrations.  This 
group of drugs includ es nitrates, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and sGC stimulators.  Nitrates, 
in particular, have an excellent safet y track record in patients with coronary heart disease.  
This is a population that includes patients with diabetes and DR, indicating that targ eting 
cGMP in the patient population of this study  is safe in principle.  Runcaciguat was shown to 
have vasodilatory  effects in healthy  subjects, with consecutive decreases in diastolic blood 
pressure and compensatory  increases in heart rate.  
Concomitant treatment with other drugs acting on the NO -sGC-cGMP sy stem has the 
potential to result in sy nergistic and excessive pharmacod ynamic activity with the relative 
adverse effects.  Therefore, these medications must not be co -administered to the patients 
enrolled in this study . 
When runcaciguat was investigated in healthy  participants at once -daily  doses of 10 to 90 mg 
over 7 days, increased heart rate was observed at doses of 20 mg and higher.  Consistent 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreases were observed at once -daily doses of 50 mg 
and above, as shown in Table 2-1.  Overall, the effects on heart rate and blood pressure were 
higher after the f irst administration than after 7 day s of once -daily  dosing, suggestive of an 
adaptation to vasodilative effects.  Orthostatic reactions in testing standing blood pressure 
considered drug -related by  the investigator ,were reported after single dose only  in the dose 
steps 75 and 90 mg but were not provoked on testing on the last dosing day  (7 day s of once 
daily  dosing).

In a study  investigating the effects of a single oral dose of 30 mg runcaciguat in participants of 
different age and gender in comparison with placebo, runcaciguat was well tolerated without 
clinically  relevant effects on heart rate or blood pressure.
The clinical phase 2 study of runcaciguat in patients with chronic kidney  disease was 
completed and final data are available (CONCORD study  18748;  EudraCT: 2019 -003297 -
53).  The CONCORD study  was a randomized, placebo -controlled, double -masked study  with 
243 patients randomized 3:1 to runcaciguat (n=184) and to placebo ( n=59).  The study  used 
the same titration regimen as in the present NEON -NPDR study . The treatment duration was 8 
weeks.  
Peripheral oedema, dizziness, diarrhea, headache, and hy potension occurred at an incidence of 
over 4% in participants treated with runcaciguat and at a lower incidence in placebo -treated 
participants.  They  can all be plausibly  explained by  the mechanism of action, resulting in 
relaxation of smooth muscles and lower BP. The incidence of SAEs was similar in the 
runcaciguat and the placebo arm s.  
Five cases of s yncope were reported onl y in the runcaciguat arm, at doses of 60 mg, 90 mg, 
and 120 mg per day .  Three of the s yncopes occurred after alcohol intake, in one instan ce in 
combination with additional sildenafil.  Another case was related to deh ydration and the 
remaining case occurred in a participant who had prior hypotension and dizziness and whose 
dose was therefore not titrated bey ond 60 mg.  
In the runcaciguat arm , a slight reduction in mean eGFR from baseline was observed, that 
could be explained by  a transient SBP reduction.  Six cases of acute kidney injury  were 
observed including one case inplacebo arm. Theobserved incidence was higher in the 
runcaciguat arm (2.7%) than in the placebo arm (1.7%) .  Except for two cases, the events 
observed from runcaciguat arm were confounded by  dehydration, infection, or cardiac 
arrhythmia. All patients fully recovered.
There was no evidence for hepatic toxicity  in this stud y in patients with chronic kidney  
disease.
Taken together, the safety  data from this study  indicate that runcaciguat was well tolerated .  
AEs were predominantl y mild to moderate, driven by  mode of action , amenable to the 
monitoring as defined for the present clinical trial ,and raised no safet y concern.

Further detail on the safety  data from the CONCORD study  ispresented in the current 
Investigator’s Brochure (Version 8.0 , Section 5.3.3.2 ). 
In view of these results from the CONCORD study , and taking into consideration that the 
characteristics of the patient populations enrolled in the NEON -NPDR and the CONCORD 
studies are similar, it can be concluded that the weekly  titration and administration of 
runcaciguat up to 8 weeks of treatment can be considered as safe also for the NEON -NPDR 
study .  
In this stud y, dose titrations will be confirmed b y the investigator after confirmation that the 
prior dose level was well -tolerated.  These confirmations are supported b y clear decision 
criteria, which ar e provided in Section 6.5.
The risk associated with once -daily treatment of diabetic patients with NPDR with 
runcaciguat in this study  is assessed as low, considering the conservative dose titration 
regimen.  In addition, safety  investigations and assessments are in place to support prompt 
reaction to an y potential adverse event, in particular during the earl y but also duri ng the later 
period of treatment.
Mild liver enzy me increases (reversible, without bilirubin increase) were reported in the 
single/multiple dose escalation study  in two healthy  participants administered once daily  
doses of 50 mg runcaciguat (Study  18747). The observed serum enzy me increases started 
prior to study  drug administration, were not dose -dependent and potential alternative 
etiologies were identified (phy sical activit y, viral infection).  As a precaution, however, stud y 
participants will be monito red for laboratory  changes indicating potential adverse effects on 
the liver (see Sections 8.2.4 and 10.5) and relative stopping criteria are defined in 
Section 6.5.2. 
Taken together, once -daily  doses up to 90 mg without initial titration were well tolera ted b y 
healthy  study  participants.  Therefore, the target dose of 120 mg, which is to be reached over a 
4-step titration spanning 4 weeks, is considered to be appropriate, as discussed in detail in 
Section 4.3and confirmed by  the experience of the CONCORD study .  Potential risks of
runcaciguat treatment and implemented mitigation activities are described in Table 2-1.

Risks associated with study procedures 
The only  procedures in this study  which may  qualify  as invasive are fluorescein angiography  
and blood draws.  
The blood volumes dra wn at any  visit (< 25mL) are low and generally  considered as safe.  
Fluorescein angiograph y is a routine diagnostic intervention in ophthalmology  for patients 
with advanced DR.  The main risks of fluorescein angiograph y include nausea, 
hypersensitivity  reactions and local reactions on the injection site that are mostly  mild.  Severe 
hypersensitivity  reactions are extremel y rare (approximately  1:200,000), but have a potential 
to be fatal.  Clinical sites which examine DR patients are experienced with the use of 
fluorescein angiograph y and the management of adverse reaction s. 
In summary , the risks associated with the study  procedures can be viewed as low.

Risks associated with assignment to the placebo arm
At present, ranibizumab and aflibercept are approved therapies for DR of any  stage in the US, 
including moderate to sev ere NPDR.  In the EU, no pharmacologically  active product is 
presentl y approved for treatment of NPDR .  Both ranibizumab and aflibercept are invasive 
treatment options, administered b y intravitreal injection.  As NPDR is often asymptomatic, the 
inconvenien ce of such an invasive approach results in a low acceptance by  patients and 
physicians, even in territories where it is approved.  Consequently , regular ophthalmologic 
monitoring remains the standard of care for NPDR, even where intravitreal anti -VEGF 
treatment is available.  Therefore, assignment of patients in this study  with frequent 
ophthalmology  examinations to the placebo arm does not represent a deviation from the 
standard of care.  
Risks associated with inclusion of women of child -bearing potential
The reproductive toxicity  of runcaciguat was investigated in rats and rabbits.  I n embry ofetal 
development studies in both species, maternal toxicity  was observed at exposures similar to 
the anticipated human exposure.  At the corresponding doses, increa sed rates of embry onal 
loss (resorptions) were noted in rats and malformations were observed in rabbits. 
Women of child -bearing potential may  participate in this clinical study  if they  have a negative 
pregnancy  test at screening, are not breast feeding an d if they  consent to use highl y effective 
contraception, as specified in the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Sections 5.1and 5.2).  If, 
despite these precautions, a female stud y participant becomes pregnant, study intervention 
will be permanentl y discontinued (Section 7.1).
With the use of highly  effective contraception, i.e. methods that can achieve a failure rate of 
less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (CTFG 2014 ), together with 
regular pregnancy  testing, the risk of inadvertent pregnancy  in the participants is considered to 
be low.  Therefore, in line with I CH guidance M3(R2) (ICH 2009 )and with the CTFG 
recommendations on contraception and pregnancy testing in clinical trials  (CTFG 2014 ).  
inclusion of women of child -bearing potential in this clinical study  is justified.  
Risks associated with the COVID -19 pandemic si tuation
This clinical study  is conducted as an outpatient study  at sites that have procedures in place to 
minimize the risk of contagion at sites, in line with institutional and governmental guidelines 
and regulations.  In this setting, the risk of contagi on attributable to study  participation is 
considered similar to other activities of dail y living, depending on the current local pandemic 
situation.
Diabetes and cardiovascular disease are conditions that are likel y to predispose patients to a 
higher risk of severe course of infection (Ciceri et al. 2020 , Robert Koch Institut 2020 ).On 
this basis, careful adherence to hy gienic standards during study  related activities is of high 
importance. 
Based on current knowledge, runcaciguat is not known to interact with the immune sy stem.  
Therefore, there is currently  no indication that incidental infection of stud y participants with 
severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2) would ch ange the individual 
risk for a severe course of infection.  Based on the mechanism of cGMP increase, treatment 
with runcaciguat may  have anti -thrombogenic effects and improve perfusion of the 
microvasculature.  Whether this may  result in a beneficial effec t in severe courses of 
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 4 (Global)
BAY 1101042 /20739
09 FEB 2023 Page: 26of 95
COVID -19 is currentl y unknown.  Based on these considerations, a general withdrawal of 
participants intercurrently  tested positive for SARS -CoV -2 does not seem to be warranted.  As 
for other infectious diseases, individual decisions by the Investigator are more appropriate.
2.3.2 Benefit assessment
Treatment duration of 48 weeks is probabl y insufficient to result in a meaningful individual 
benefit, such as a significant decrease in vision -threatening complications.  However, 
obtaining a 2 -step DRSS improvement may  be associated with an improvement in disease 
status shown to be beneficial in clinical trials such as the PANORAMA study  and Protocol W 
(Maturi et al. 2021 , Wykoff 2020 ).  Whether such ch ange results in an individual functional 
benefit is y et to be demonstrated.  
All patients, including those assigned to the placebo arms, will be under close surveillance 
with regards to their diabetic retinopath y while participating in this study.  The 8 -week visit 
intervals in the study  are shorter than the standard intervals for ophthalmology  monitoring of 
patients with moderatel y severe to severe diabetic retinopathy  (Berufsverband der Augenärzte 
Deutschlands e.V. and Deutsche Ophthalmologische Gesellschaft e.V. 2011 , Flaxel et al. 
2020 , Nationale VersorgungsLeitlinie 2020 , Ophthalm ologists TRCo 2012 ).  Since the 
standard therapeutic approach to NPDR without DME consists of regular monitoring, patients 
assigned to placebo are ensured to have timel y surveillance during their participation in the 
study , similar to the highest levels of standard of care.  Progression of DR, including 
development of DME, would be promptly  identified in these patients.  This represents a 
relevant benefit, as it expedites the treatment of vision threatening complications.

4. Study design
4.1 Overall design
Thestudy  is subdivided into two components , as shown in Table 4-1.Part1is conducted to 
provide data for PK/PD analy ses in diabetic patients with NPDR and to explore the value of 
different OCT -A assessments as PD marker in diabetic retinopath y. Part2is the main part of 
this proof of concept study  and will be conducted in parallel .  Both com ponents follow a 
similar design –except for the randomization ratio and additional examinations in Part 1.  
Both study  subparts will be e valuated together, to the extent that common data are available 
and at the same time .
A steering committee consisting of ophthalmologists and diabetologists (masked) is put in 
place to provide scientific and operational recommendations to the study  protocol. 
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) is set up to provide recommendation s 
based on unmasked review of data, if needed.

Part2of the study  is planned to follow the same titration and dosing scheme as Part 1.  
In Part 2, the participants will be randomized to either placebo (n =40) or runcaciguat 
(n=40).  The participants are p lanned to be titrated at 30 -mg increments to the maximum 
tolerated dose or sham titrated .  Each participant will continue treatment for a total treatment 
duration of 48weeks, followed by  a 4-week follow -up period.   
The 24-week and 48-week data together are intended to derive proof -of-concept and may
provide information on the durability  of the effect .
4.2 Scientific rationale for study design
As of amendment 3, this section was integrated from the Master protocol . 
Results from previous Phase 1 studies in healthy  as well as renall y impaired study  participants 
and from a phase 2 stud y in patients with chronic kidney  disease have demonstrated that 
runcaciguat given as MR tablets was well tolerated, and support the star t of further studies in 
patients. 
Due to the mode of action of sGC activators, and based on preclinical data, it is assumed that 
sGC activators administered to patients with NPDR can positively  influence retinal perfusion 
and thereb y improve fundus morpho logy and reduce the progression of retinal ischemia and 
prevent vision -threatening later stages like proliferative diabetic retinopathy (DR) and/or 
diabetic macular edema (DME).
Efficacy  is to be assessed based on the Diabetic Retinopathy  Severity  Scale (DRSS), the 
widely  accepted standard to assess disease severity  and to stage diabetic retinopathy  in clinical 
trials.  This scale is based on the presence or absence of disease -specific phenoty pes in a 
defined set of highl y standardized 7 -field color fundu s photographs .  The scale was introduced 
by the Earl y Treatment of Diabetic Retinopath y Study research group (ETDRS report number 
10 1991 ).  A commonly  accepted efficacy  endpoint in clinical trials is an improvement in 
DRSS ratings by  more than one severity  level or step, i.e. so -called DRSS two -step 
improvement.  This has been used as an endpoint in previous diabetic retinopathy  
development programs resulting in regulatory  acceptan ce (FDA 2019 ).  
Progression rates to vision -threatening events have consistently  been shown to be lower in 
patients with lower DRSS severity  (ETDRS report number 12 1991 , Matur i et al. 2021 , 
Wykoff 2020 ).  Therefore, an improvement in DRSS indicates a regression of diabetic 
retinopath y and is associated with a clinicall y relevant risk reduction of progression towards 
proliferative retinopath y and other vision threatening complications (Klein et al. 2001 ).
In previous studies of intra -vitreal anti -VEGF treatments, 2 -step DRSS improvements were 
detected as early  as 8 weeks after treatment initiation and reached a maximum after 6 to 
12months of treatment.  However, recent clinicaltrials of oral ag ents in NPDR failed after 
treatment periods of up to 24 weeks (e.g. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) .  Therefore, the primary  endpoint 
assessment is planned after 4 8weeks of treatment.  Additional assessments are planned for 
DRSSassessment at 12 and 2 4 weeks of treatment .  
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 4 (Global)
BAY 1101042 /20739
09 FEB 2023 Page: 30of 95
Assessment of vision threatening complications as secondary  endpoint is planned in addition, 
to correlate the DRSS -change with a clinical outcome parameter in support of the efficacy  
assessment in this study . 
Participant input into design
A patient advis ory board was conducted to 
Identify  potential hurdles in the plans for the clinical trial to recruitment, adherence 
with the study  procedures, and patient retention 
Confirm the relevance of the investigated endpoints for patients with diabetic 
retinopath y (DR)
Seek input on medical need and relevant stud y outcomes in NPDR from the 
perspective of patients with DR 
The feedback from the advisory  board was dul y integrated in the stud y protocol.
4.3 Justification for dose
As of amendment 3, this section wasintegrated from Master Protocol. 
All study  medication will be administered as modified -release formulation, as discussed in 
Section 2.3.1 .  
A rando mized placebo -controlled double -masked study  in patients with chronic kidney  
disease is currently  ongoing and recruiting patients (CONCORD study 1874 8, EudraCT: 
2019 -003297 -53).  This study  is exposing participants to the same titration regimen and target 
dose as the present NEON study , and ongoing safety  reviews indicate that this regimen and 
target dose are well tolerated, as discussed in Section 2.3.1 . 
Starting dose
As this study  is conducted in patients, the number of patients assigned to dose levels that are 
expected to have no or only  marginal effect should be avoided.  Therefore, the lowest dose to 
be tested is a low dose for which consistent PD effects on the cardiovascular sy stem were 
observed in prior studies(see Section 2.3.1 ). The 30 mg dose was identified as minimal 
effective dose with r egards to vasodilatory  effects (study 18747).  At the same time, this dose 
was very  well tolerated in healthy  subjects and it is anticipated to be safe and well tolerated in 
patients with NPDR participating in this study .  Therefore, the dose of 30 mg was chosen for 
the lowest dose of continuous treatment in this study .
The starting dose of 30 mg was confirmed to be well tolerated in the ongoing stud y of 
runcaciguat in patients with chronic kidney  disease, the CONCORD study  18748.
Dose titration
Daily  doses are titrated up to three times by  30-mg increments, to the target dose.  Titration is 
expected to minimize potential cardiovascular adverse effects, based on a pharmacokinetic / 
pharmacod ynamic correlation anal ysis.  In this PK/PD analy sis including data from healthy  
participants taking the MR -formulation ofruncaciguat, the changes in diastolic blood pressure 
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 4 (Global)
BAY 1101042 /20739
09 FEB 2023 Page: 31of 95
and heart rate were 2.5 times and 3.5 times higher on the first day  of dosing compared with 
repeated dosing, indicating an attenuation to these acut e hemod ynamic effects.  This indicates 
that titration can be expected to safel y achieve higher, presumabl y more efficacious doses.
The investigator will take an individual decision prior to each titration in each participant after 
approximately  7 day s of t reatment at the prior dose level.  At this point, steady -state plasma 
levels should have been reached ,considering the plasma half -life of approximately  20hours.  
Depending on the safet y and tolerability  observed, the decision may  be to either titrate as 
planned, to maintain, or to reduce the dail y dose.  Clear guidance to support the investigator’s 
decisions is provided in Section 6.5. 
Weekly  dose increments of 30 mg were confirmed to be well tolerated in the ongoing stud y of 
runcaciguat in patients with chronic kidney  disease, the CONCORD study  18748.
Highest dose 
The dose of 120 mg/day  was selected to increase potential treatment effi cacy with a higher 
exposure, while keeping the safet y profile similar to the previous dose level.  Pharmacokinetic 
modeling and pre -clinical pharmacology  data support this hy pothesis.  The following aspects 
related to the PK and PD properties of runcacigua t were carefull y considered in the selection 
of the highest dose of 120 mg:
In prior studies in healthy  participants, doses up to 90 mg were safe and well tolerated, even 
when administered without dose -titration.  Based on the experience with the sGC stimu lators 
riociguat (Merck Sharp and Dohme 2019 )and vericiguat tolerability  will likely  be 
significantl y improved with a dose titration des ign, as implemented in this clinical trial.  Such 
a titration design should allow to safel y reach higher doses and to full y exploit the 
pharmacologic activity  of runcaciguat.
While the dose -exposure relationship was approximately  dose proportional up to a daily  dose 
of 75 mg in healthy  participants, C max,ss values were overlapping at dail y doses of 75 mg and 
90mg (Stud y 18747).  The observation based on a group comparison with small sample size 
(n=8 participants per dose step) remains to be confirmed, but it suggests that the risk for over -
proportional increases of runcaciguat concentrations at the planned maximum dose of 120 mg 
per day  is very  low.  With the dose -titration des ign, appropriate interim evaluations, involving 
an independent Data Monitoring Committee, are in place for timely  detection of any  potential 
residual risk.  Based on the results from the renal impairment study  18745, no relevantl y 
higher exposure is to be expected in participants with moderate impairment of renal function 
(eGFR range 30 to 60 ml/min).  Considering the lower permissible eGFR limit of 30 ml/min 
defined in exclusion criterion 18, the individual dose titration up to a target dose of 120 mg is 
considered to be appropriate. 
The selection of the highest target dose for runcaciguat in this study  (120 mg) is further 
supported by  PK/PD modeling performed for the runcaciguat POC study  in patients with 
chronic kidney  disease (Study  18748) utilizing the reduction of the urinary albumin -creatinine 
ratio (uACR) as an efficacy  marker.  For that study , a translational PK/PD anal ysis for 
runcaciguat was performed, linking a population PK/PD model built on the basis of Phase 1 
data, to model derived hemody nami c response and efficacy  observations, e.g. uACR reduction 
in the ZSF -1 rat disease model (Petersson and Voelkner 2019 ).  Dose -dependent uACR 
changes were extrapolated for runcaciguat indicating that with a dose of 120 mg, a slightly  
higher percentage of patients will achieve the efficacy  target of >30% reduction in uACR 
compared to the dose of 90 mg (Table 4-2).

To substantiate the doses to be used in this clinical study  in patients suffering from NPDR, it 
should be noted that similar efficacious exposures were measured in preclinical CKD and DR 
disease models, as shown in Table 4-3.  Lower EC50 in DR models may  partially  be 
attributed to usage of C trough in the STZ DR model vs. C average (AUC(0 -24)/24h) in the ZSF -1 CKD 
model, owing to animal model -related PK -sampling limitations.  Similar changes in 
triglycerides, an established biomarker for sGC -modulation and which were used in both 
models, support the bridging (Hoffmann et al. 2015 ).  A dose dependent increase of the ERG 
b wave amplitude values was observed in the STZ DR model.  Similarly , a dose -dependent 
decrease in urinary  protein -creatinine ratio was observed in the in the ZSF -1 CKD model.

Based on these nonclinical experiments, the efficacy  of runcaciguat is anticipated to be higher 
at the target dose of 120 mg once dail y than at 90 mg once dail y, but still tolerable in terms of 
cardiovascular effects.
Conclusion
Overall, the selected dose range from 30 mg to 120 mg is expected to deliver significant
efficacy  while being safe and well tolerated under i ndividual titration dosing .  Earl y signs and 
symptoms of e.g. hy potension will be closely  monitored during the titration phase and overall 
safet y will be assessed during the whole study duration with additional review by the DMC.
A placebo -treated referenc e group is included in order to allow a more reliable evaluation of 
efficacy  and safet y.

The end of the stud y as a whole is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant 
globall y.
A participant is considered to have completed the study  if he/she has completed the last visit 
of the study  . 
5. Study population
The study  will be performed in a representative NPDR study  population reflecting the 
composition of study  populations in later development stages. Specificall y, participants 
should show ty pical fundus alterations as described in the DRSS criteria for mode rately severe 
and severe NPDR withoutDME in need of treatment and no previous experience of anti-
VEGF treatment .This corresponds to DRSS L evels 47 and 53, which need to be confirmed 
by an independent reading center ,in at least one ey e.
Treatment of NPD R with runcaciguat targets the retina, which is being investigated for signs 
of efficacy  in this clinical trial. In order to be able to examine the retina appropriatel y at 
screening and during the study , participants whose ey es have anomalies that interfe re with 
protocol -required examinations are excluded.
Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrollment criteria, also known 
as protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted.

5.3 Lifestyle considerations
No study  specific lifest yle restrictions are required. Participation in this study  does not 
require modifications of lifesty le. Participants should follow their usual lifesty le, as part of 
their diabetes management plan.
5.4 Screen failures
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study  but 
are not subsequently  assigned to study  intervention. A minimal set of screen failure 
information is required to ensure transparent reporting of scree n failure participants to meet 
the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to 
respond to queries from regulatory  authorities. Minimal information includes demography , 
screen failure details, and eligibility  criteri a.
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study  (screen failure) may  be 
rescreened only once .In any case, the investigator must ensure that the repeated screening 
procedures do not expose the participant to an unjustifiable he alth risk.  For re-screening, the 
participant must re -sign the I CF, even if it was not changed after the participant 's previous 
screening.   
Participants who failed screen ingbefore protocol Amendment 3 was implemented may be re -
screened in view of the changes in inclusion /exclusion criteria.
Rescreened participants will be assigned a new participant number. 
In case of abnormal or implausible results, which may be caused b y intercurrent diseases, 
short -term treatable conditions, other temporary  health disorders (e.g. acute infection, 
laboratory  changes, blood pressure outside defined range), or inappropriate circumstances 
(e.g. inadequate rest when required, hemoly sis) the investigator may  decide to repeat the 
respective screening parameter(s) twice .
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 4 (Global)
BAY 1101042 /20739
09 FEB 2023 Page: 37of 95
5.5 Criteria for temporarily delaying randomization / study intervention 
administration
If aparticipant is otherwise eligible, acute intercurrent conditions may  allow to postpone start 
ofstudy  intervention in a participant to a time when the condition ha sresolved .  Under these 
circumstan ces, the screening period may  be extended to 6weeks. 
5.6 Selection of the study eye
Only  one ey e will be designated as the stud y eye in every  participant. For participants who 
meet eligibility  criteria in both ey es during t he screening phase, the ey e without DME and 
with the higher DRSS should be selected. If both ey es have the same score ,the ey e with the 
clearest lens and ocular media will be selected. If there is no objective basis for selecting the 
study  eye, factors s uch as ocular dominance (better focus ability ), other ocular pathology  and 
participant preference should be considered in making the selection. The final selection will 
be done b y the investigator at baseline and must not be changed during the course of t he 
study .
6. Study intervention(s) and concomitant therapy
Study  intervention is defined as any  investigational intervention(s), marketed product(s), 
placebo, or medical device(s) intended to be administered to a study  participant according to 
the study  proto col.
6.1 Study interventions administered
6.1.1 Study intervention s
In this stud y, several doses of runcaciguat or placebo, will be given to the NPDR participants, 
as shown in Table 6-1.Participants will be treated following an intra -individual dose -titration 
design with three titration steps .
Tablets containing runcaciguat and corresponding placebo are identical in appeara nce (size, 
color, shape). In order to remain masked, stud y interventions will be packaged in bottles 
labeled with a unique number which will be pre -printed on each bottle.
The following doses are envisaged for the intra -individual dose titration steps wit h four dose 
levels.

Titrated oral doses of runcaciguat or matching placebo will be given once a day  on top of 
respective standard of care treatment before, during or closel y after the first meal in the 
morning. The stud y intervention (tablets) are not to be broken, halved or crushed, they  should 
be swallowed whole with a glass of water. If a participant has missed a dose or forgotten to 
take the medication and > 16hours have passed from the regular scheduled time, the dose 
should be skipped and the next dose should be taken promptly  the next day in the morn ing. 
On Visit day s (except Visit 7) study intervention is to be administered atsiteafter 
blood draws.
Onnon-visit day s and on the day  of Visit 7 study  intervention is to be taken in the 
morning at home .
6.1.2 Medical devices
No sponsor manufactured devices or devices manufactured for the sponsor are used in this 
study . Other medical devices (not manufactured by  or for sponsor) provided for use in this 
study  are:
ECG machine for central ECG reading
Instructions for medical dev ice use are provided in the corresponding manual. All device 
deficiencies (including malfunction, use error and inadequate labelling) that caused or could 
have caused a SAE to a study  participant shall be documented and reported by  the investigator 
throug hout the clinical investigation and appropriately  managed by  the sponsor.
A device deficiency  is an inadequacy  of a medical device with respect to its identity , quality , 
durability , reliability , safety , or performance. Device deficiencies include malfunct ions, use 
errors, and inadequate labeling. 
For an y device deficiencies related to a study  participant AE or SAE:  the investigator should 
complete the AE CRF and safet y reports (complementary pages) in addition to the Medical 
Device Incident (MDI) CRF.

6.2 Preparation /handling / storage / accountability
The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study  intervention received and any  discrepancies are 
reported and resolved before use of the stud y intervention.
Only  participants randomized in the study  may  receive study  intervention and only  authorized 
site staff may  supply  or administer study  intervention. All study  intervention must be stored 
in a secure, environmentally  controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in 
accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and 
authorized site staff.
The investigator or the head of the institution (where applicable) is responsible for study  
interv ention accountability , reconciliation, and record maintenance ( i.e.receipt, reconciliation, 
and final disposition records). Drug receipt , reconciliation and destruction information on the 
study  sites will be captured in the I WRS.
Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study  interventions are 
provided in the Investigator Site File . 
6.3 Measures to minimize bias : Randomization and masking
All participants will be centrally  assigned to randomized study  inter vention using I WRS. 
Before the stud y is initiated, the log in information and directions for the IWRS will be 
provided to each site. 
Participants will be randomized to either Placebo or Runcaciguat.  Randomization will be 
stratified by  baseline DRSS scor e (47 or 53). In Part 1, the randomization ratio will be 2 :1
runcaciguat : placebo and in Part 2it will be 1 :1.
Potential bias will be reduced b y the use of central random ization via the IWRS . The l evel of 
masking is presented in Table 6-2.
Table 6-2 Level of masking –Part 1and 2
Masked Unmasked
Participant ●
Care provider ●

PK = pharmacokinetics
The IWRSwill be programmed with instructions on how to break / unmask a participant’s 
randomized treatment . In case of an emergency , the investigator has the responsibility  for 
determining if un mask ing of a participant’s intervention assignment is warranted. If the 
investigator is unavailable, and a treating phy sician not associated with the study  requests 
emergency  unmask ing, the emergency  unmask ing requests are forwarded to the emergency  
medical advice 24 hours /7 day  service. Participant safet y must always be the first 
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 4 (Global)
BAY 1101042 /20739
09 FEB 2023 Page: 40of 95
consideration in making such a determination. If the investigator decides that un mask ing is 
warranted, the investigator should make every  effort to contact the sponsor prior to un mask ing 
a participant’s intervention assignment unless this could delay  emergency  treatment of the 
participant. If a participant’s intervention assignment is un mask ed, the sponsor must be 
notified within 24 hours after the unmasking .Date and reason forthe unmasking m ustbe 
recorded in the source documentation and case report form, as applicable.
Bioanal ytics and pharmacometrics staff will be unmasked according to Sponsor’s standard 
operating procedure s. Pharmacometrics anal ysis and report will be done under a separate 
cover. Bioanal ysis and pharmacometrics evaluation might be started prior to da tabase lock: 
ifthis is applicable, appropriate measures will be taken to maintain masking of the stud y team, 
e.g. data will be stored separatel y, and members of the study team will not have access to the 
unmasked data.
The primary  outcome measure, DRSS, w ill be assessed centrally  by a masked reading center, 
in order to have a standardized assessment throughout study  sites and in order to minimize 
potential bias.
6.4 Study intervention compliance
When participants self -administer study  intervention(s) at home, compliance with study  
intervention will be assessed at each visit. Compliance will be assessed b y direct questioning
andcounting returned tablets during the site visits and documented in the source documents 
and eCRF .Deviation(s) from the prescribed d osage regimen should be recorded. Unopened 
and undamaged bottles of returned stud y intervention may  be re -dispensed to the same 
participant.
A record of the quantity  of tablets dispensed to and administered by  each participant must be 
maintained and reconciled with study  intervention and compliance records . Intervention start 
and stop dates, including dates for intervention delay s and/or dose reductions will also be 
recorded.
A system to remind the participants of study  intervention self -administrati on and to document 
the intake may be used.  Such a system may consist of a mobile application and web portal 
components.  Study  drug intake may bedocumented by  the participants by scanning a barcode 
with a mobile phone using a dedicated smartphone applica tion.  These scans are recorded via 
a web -portal. An alternative methodology , e.g. a paper based diary ,may be used for 
documenting stud y intervention intake. If stud y intervention intake has not yet been 
documented, the participants may be reminded to t ake the study  intervention, e.g. by  
telephone, email, push -notification, text message, at defined time points prior and after the 
scheduled time of stud y intervention intake.  
IWRS will be used for drug accountabilit y on a patient basis. Drug returns, re conciliation and 
destruction information will be captured in the IWRS.
On all visit day sduring the treatment period , plasma samples will be take nto determine the 
concentrations of the study  intervention .
Taken together, these measures are deemed appropriate to support participants adherence and 
to detect participants that are systematically  non-adherent .

6.5 Dose modification
The doses to be administered are provided in Table 6-1. 
In exceptional cases, participants may  request to reschedule visits.  Visits 3, 4, and 5 may  be 
shifted by  no more than one day  to an earlier or later timepoint. Actual dates of dose titrations 
may be shifted as a r esult. The treatment duration at the subsequent dose level may be 
shortened or extended b y one day  to compensate the effect on the total treatment duration. 
6.5.1 Intra -individual dose -titration decisions 
Doses will be titrated on a weekl y basis from 30 mg to 60 mg to 90 mg and to 120 mg once 
daily . The decision to titrate to the next higher dose will be taken by  the investigator upon 
availability  of all relevant safet y data on stud y days 8, 15, and 22 . The decision to increase 
the dose should not be taken in presence of a nycondition where dose titration is deemed 
unadvisable b y the investigator . 
The investigator should not confirm the dose titration but, instead, maintain the dose if 
systolic blood pressure (SBP) 
SBP ≥90 and <105 mmHg, or 
>30 mmHg de crease from previous visit (even if SBP ≥105)
The investigator should not confirm the dose titration but rather reduce the doseif the 
participant previousl y experienced:
A serious adverse event considered to be related to treatment with runcaciguat. 
A severe adverse event considered to be related to treatment with runcaciguat.
Relevant hypotension ( e.g. s ymptoms of hy potension or SBP <90mmHg or both ). 
Restart with last well -tolerated dose after ≥48hours if SBP recovers above 90 mm Hg and 
symptoms resolve within 24 hours .
If there is evidence for clinically  relevant side effects (e.g. dizziness, diarrhea) , the 
investigator can decide to maintain the dose at its current level or, if side -effects are
considered as sustained intolerability  or safet y risk, even lower the dose back to the previous 
dose level (the dose modification and the reason for it have to be captured accordingl y in the 
eCRF ). 
For each participant , up to two dose reduction sare permissible with continued study  
participation at an y point of the clinical stud y. The final reduced dose level should be 
maintained until the end of the study .
Please refer to Section 7.1.2 for temporary  treatment discontinuations.
6.5.2 Stopping rules (study level)
In addition to the general criteria as listed in Section 10.1.9 ,the following criteri aresult in an 
immediate stop of dosing and will result in a temporary  halt of the stud y:
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 4 (Global)
BAY 1101042 /20739
09 FEB 2023 Page: 42of 95
Any relevant information, from this trial or from outside of this trial, indicat ing a 
relevant deterioration of the benefit -risk ratio. In particular, c onsistently  observed 
SAEs or severe drug -related AEs will be thoroughly  assessed.
Safety  findings observed by  DMC which indicate unacceptable pharmacological 
effects, reasonabl y attributable to runcaciguat 
Resuming the trial after a temporary  halt requires an approved substantial amendment. 
For discontinuation of study  intervention for individual study  participants see Section 7.1.
6.6 Continued access to study intervention after the endof the study
No treatment with study  medication will be provided after the end of the planned tr eatment 
period or after earl y withdrawal of treatment.
6.7 Treatment of overdose
An overdose is defined as any  occasion when participants have been exposed to more tablets 
than the maximum number foreseen per intake and/or per day  in the protocol (accidentally or 
intentionally ).  
There is no known specific treatment or antidote for an overdose with runcaciguat. 
Accordingl y, overdose of the study intervention should be treated as clinically indicated based 
on sy mptoms and signs. Due to the pharmacological pro file of runcaciguat, cardiovascular
effects are to be expected in case of overdose. If symptoms develop after the overdose, an y 
therap y that becomes necessary  has to be guided by  the predominant sy mptoms. Participant s 
have to remain under medical supervision until all relevant adverse effects have subsided.
Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken 
with possible suicidal/self -harming intent, or if this resulted in clinical sig nsorsymptoms 
diagnosed as AE /SAE by the investigator.
In the event of an overdose, the investigator should:
Contact the sponsor immediatel y.
Evaluate the part icipant to determine, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, whether 
study  intervention shoul d be interrupted or whether the dose should be reduced.
Closely  monitor the participant for an y AE/SAE and laboratory  abnormalities until 
runcaciguat can no longer be detected s ystemically  (at least 3days).
Obtain a plasma sample for PK anal ysis as soon a s possible from the date of the last 
dose of study  intervention if requested by  the Medical Monitor (determined on a case -
by-case basis).
Document the quantit y of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose in the 
eCRF.
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by  the investigator 
based on the clinical evaluation of the participant. The investigator may  consult the Medical 
Monitor as needed .

6.8 Concomitant therapy
Only  drugs prescribed by a health care professional are permitted while the study  is ongoing . 
Exceptionally , short -term intake of paracetamol /acetaminophen ≤2000 mg/day  is acceptable . 
Such intake is to be recorded (see below) .
Concomitant medications are to be recorded in the eCRF , in particular international non -
proprietary  names , dosing frequency , individual dose, route, indication are to be documented .  
This includes anti -diabetic treatments.  
Participants are requested to record the dose of a ntidiabetic treatments that are dosed variabl y, 
e.g.insulin, in a diary  along with gl ycemia test results.   Other concomitant medications taken 
intermittently  should be documented in the same diary .
Participants with HbA1c concentrations outside of the recommended corridor should be 
instructed t o contact t heir diabetologist to seek support in achieving better diabetic control .
The medications provided in Table 6-3are not allowed for use during treatment with the study  
intervention and one or two weeks prior to start of treatment.

Any medication or vaccine (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, 
and/or herbal supplements) that the participant is receiving at the time of enrollment or 
receives during the stud y must be recorded along with:
Reason for use
Dates of administration including start and end dates

7. Discontinuation of study intervent ion and participant 
discontinuation/withdrawal 
7.1 Discontinuation of study intervention
7.1.1 Permanent discontinuation
In rare instances, it may  be necessary  for a participant to permanentl y discontinue (definitive 
discontinuation) study  intervention. If stud y intervention is permanentl ydiscontinued, an 
End-of-Treatment visit should be performed in line with Visit 15 .The participant remain sin 
the study  for continued assessment of study  outcomes following the visit schedule in 
section 1.3.
Unscheduled visits may  be performed as deemed appropriate b y the investigator, in particular 
in case of withdrawal because of an adverse eve nt.
Participants must be withdrawn from the study intervention for any  of the following reasons: 
Increases in transaminases as described in Table 10-3(confirmed b y anal ysis of 
two blood samples; additional laboratory  examinations may  be performed if 
necessary ):
Safety  concerns for a participant by  the investigator or the sponsor, e.g. due to 
obvious non -compliance .
Pregnancy (see Section 8.3.5 for details)
Temporary  discontinuation exceeding 14 consecutive day s or 21 day s overall
Participants may be withdrawn from the study intervention for any  of the following reasons: 
Repeated incidents of relevant h ypotension or tachycardia 
Repeated temporary  discontinuation of study  intervention
Vision threatening complication or progression to PDR
Necessit y to withdraw the participant from the study will be a ssessed case by  case by the 
investigator .
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 4 (Global)
BAY 1101042 /20739
09 FEB 2023 Page: 45of 95
7.1.2 Temporary discontinuation
Treatment should be with held temporaril y if an y of the following conditions apply :
Relevant hypotension or tachycardia considered to be related to treatment with 
runcaciguat , e.g. SBP < 90 mmHg with s ymptoms of hy potension persisting 
>24hours, or AE indicating non tolerabilit y with regard to mode of action (e.g. severe 
dizziness, orthostatic dy sregulation , syncope ). In case of additional, subsequent   
temporary  discontinuation (s), the i nvestigator should consider whether a permanent
discontinu ation of the study  intervention is appropriate .
Temporary  discontinuation for drop in eGFR from baseline: 
If the participant presents a decrease of eGFR ≥40% compared with baseline , the 
investigator should temporar ily discontinue study intervention and perform 
confirmatory laboratory  exam inations . If eGFR decrease b y ≥40% is confirmed, 
study  intervention should be discontinued p ermanently (see Section 7.1.1 ).If the 
re-assessed laboratory  result indicates a decrease in eGFR <40% from baseline , study  
intervention may be re -started at the same dose as before this temporary  
discontinuation , in line with section 7.1.3 . The investigator should consider a close 
observation of the case (e.g. repeated laboratory  investigat ion of renal function ).
The investigator may  decide to temporar ilydiscontinu e treatment for other reasons if 
deemed appropriate for the safet y and well -being of the participant.
A temporary  discontinuation exceeding 14 consecutive days or 21 day s overall results in a 
permanent discontinuation (see section 7.1.1 )
7.1.3 Re-challenge / re-start of study intervention
Participants who permanently  discontinue the study  intervention must not be re -challenged.
After a temporary  discontinuation, study  intervention intake may  be resumed as follows:
≤48 hours since last intake: 
resume intake at same dose as prior discontinuation
>48hours to <7 day s (168 hours) sin ce last intake: 
resume intake at one titration step below dose prior to discontinuation.  Titration to 
target dose at the discretion of the investigator ,as described in Section 6.5. 
>7 day s (168 hours) since last intake: 
resume intake with complete re -titration of study  intervention , as described in 
Section 6.5.  
The dose -titrations after temporary  discontinuation should follow the same procedures as 
described for the initial dose titrations .This may  result in conducting one or more 
unscheduled vi sit/s, analogousl y to Visit 4.Additional assessments and examinations may  be 
performed , depending on the reason for the temporary  discontinuation. Titration steps may  be 
extended , e.g.for operational reasons ,to the next scheduled visit .
Thefinal dose at the end of re -titration should notexceed the dose at which the decision for 
temporary  discontinuation was taken, but the dose may be lower than prior to thetemporary  
discontinuation . This also includes cases of prior dose reduction .

7.2 Parti cipant discontinuation / withdrawal from the study
Participants must be withdrawn from the s tudy for any  of the following reasons: 
A participant may  withdraw from the study  at an y time at his/her own request, or may be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, or 
compliance reasons. This includes cases where, in the investigator's opinion, continued 
participation in the study  would be harmful to the participant's well -being. This is expected to 
be uncommon.
At the time of discontinuing from the stud y, if possible, Visit 1 5should be 
conducted as earl y discontinuation visit , followed by safet y follow -up (Visit 16) as 
shown in the SoA. See SoA for data to be collected at the time of study  
discontinuation and follow -up and for an y further evaluations that need to be 
completed.
The participant will be permanentl y discontinued both from the study intervention 
and from the stud y at that time.
If the participant withdraws conse nt for disclosure of future information, the 
sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such a withdrawal 
of consent.
Participants may be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:
Non-compliance with the study  conditions or instructions from the study  team. 
7.3 Lost to follow up
A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedl y fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted b y the study  site.
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study  visit:
The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as 
soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit sched ule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to 
and/or should continue in the study .
Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must 
make every  effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 
3telephone calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the participant’s last known 
mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be 
documented in the participant’s medical record.
Should the participant continue to be unre achable, he/she will be considered to 
have withdrawn from the study .
Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study  as a whole are handled as part of Section 10.1,
Appendix 1.

8. Study assessments and procedures
Study  procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA. Protocol waivers or 
exemptions are not allowed.
Immediate safety  concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately  upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study  
intervention.
Adherence to the stud y design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential 
and requir ed for stud y conduct.
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility  criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confi rm eligibility  or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable. 
Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management ( e.g.blood 
count) and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline 
purpos es provided the procedures met the protocol -specified criteria and were performed 
within the time frame defined in the SoA.
Individual pharmacokinetic results could un mask the study  and will not be reported to 
investigative sites or other mask ed personnel until the study  has been un mask ed.
Repeat or unscheduled samples may  be taken for safet y reasons or for technical issues with 
the samples. 
After signing an informed consent, participants will be invited to a screening visit, Visit 1, to 
evaluate their eli gibility  for this study .  Eligible patients with NPDR who meet all of the 
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, will be randomized to treatment with 
either runcaciguat or placebo. During the treatment period, participants will be monitore d for 
adverse events and concomitant medication, and undergo the assessments outlined in the SoA, 
Section 1.3. 
The treatment period comprises Visits 2 to 15(Week 1 to Week 49), the End -of-Treatment 
visit.
An End -of-Study visit, Visit 16,is planned approximately 28days after last administration o f 
study  drug .
The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration 
of the study , including any  extra assessments that may  be required, will not exceed 
300mL.
Repeat or unscheduled samples may  be taken for safet y reasons or for technical 
issues with the samples.

andimages sent to the central reading center for evaluation .
8.1.1.1 Color fundus photography (CFP)  
The anatom ical state of the retinal vasculature will be evaluated by  an ophthalmologist from
posterior segment (Section 8.1.1.6 ) examination and CFP . Alldigital CFP images need to be 
taken b y a certified technician following an acquisition protocol for ETDRS 7 -Fields of the 
central reading center at the visits indica ted in the SoA .
All CFPs will be transmitted to the central reading center for ETDRS diabetic retinopath y 
severit y scale (DRSS , Table 8-1) grading and s torage. The images of the screening visit of 
both ey es will be used as part of the eligibility  assessment regarding the severity  of diabetic 
retinopathy .
CFPs may , in addition ,be evaluated for additional , exploratory , endpoints. This may include 
assessment of microaneury sm turnover (Nunes et al. 2009 )or measurement of diameters of 
retinal vessels as described previousl y(Lundberg et al. 2013 ).  This may  involve transmission 
of CFP to addi tional central rea ding centers.

(AREDS 1999 ).  Visual Acuity  examiners must be certified to ensure consistent measurement 
of BCVA. 
8.1.1.3 Fluorescein angiography (FA)
The anatomical state of the retinal vasculature of the study  eye (transit ey e) and the fellow ey e 
(non-transit ey e) will be evaluated b y FA.All FAs will be conducted by  a certified technician
following an acquisition protocol of the reading center. The a ngiographic images will be 
evaluated by a study  ophthalmologist for individual safet y decisions , and b y the central 
reading center to support the DRSS assessment . All FA images will be sent to the central 
reading center for evaluation .  
At screening a standardized set of FA images with the study  eye as transit ey e will be sent to 
the reading center for evaluation and eligibility  assessment.  
8.1.1.4 Optical coherence tomography (OCT)
Structural OCT will be performed preferably  by using spectral domain devices. The specific 
device models accepted for the study  will be defined by  the reading center. OCTs will be 
performed by certified technicians following an acquisition protocol of the reading center as 
scheduled in the SoA for local safet y assessment. Newly found clinicall y relevant pathologies 
should be reported as adverse event. All obtained images will be sent to the reading center for 
evaluatio nat the visits stated in the SoA .
At screening a standardized set of OCT images will be sent to the reading center for 
evaluation and eligibility assessment.  
OCT Central Subfield Thickness (CST) will be analy zed by  the reading center to guide the 
investigator relating to Exclusion criterion 6, which excludes participants with macular edema
requiring treatment . The thresholds depend on gender (+15 µm in men) and on the inclusion 
or exclusion of Bruch’s membrane b y the OCT -device s segmentation algorithm .  
The reference threshold for the CST will be determined by  the central reading center using the 
Heidelberg -Engineering segmentation algorithm as a standard ,which in cludes Bruch’s 
membrane.  For other OCT -devices, equivalent CST values will be provided by  the central 
reading center.
The CST thresholds used are :
≥305µmin women , ≥320µmin men
8.1.1.5 Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT -A) 
For Part 1,OCT -A is mandatory , forPart 2,OCT -A is optional. In any case,the OCT -A 
needs to be perf ormed by a certified technician following an acquisition protocol of the 
reading center as scheduled in the SoA . The specifications of this OCT -A can be found in the 
acquisition protocol of the Reading center. Images obtained via OCT -A will be sent to th e 
Central Reading Center for evaluation.

Foveal avascular zone
Cross -sectional macular full depth line scans acquired with an experimental software used for 
positioning the scan lines and to average the information obtained for each scan will b e 
analyzed for 
Total perfusion
Vessel densit y
8.1.1.6 Slit lamp biomicroscopy (anterior and posterior segment)
The slit lamp examination (anterior and posterior segment) will be performed according to 
local medical practice and applicable medical standards at the site as stated in the SoA. 
Abnormal findings are to be recorded in the eCRF as either medical history or adverse event 
as applicable.
8.1.1.7 Tonometry ( intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement)
Intraocular pressure is to be measured with an y locally  approved non -contact tonometer. 
In case that there is no non -contact tonometer available at the site, applanation to nometry  
(Goldmann, Tonopen or other locall y approved alternatives) may  be used. In an y case ,where 
both methods are available the non -contact method is to be used. 
The same method of IOP measurement must be used throughout the study for each individual 
participant . Values and measuring ty pe are to be recorded in the eCRF.
8.1.2 Vision -threatening complications
Vision -threatening complications aredefined as occurrence of an y ofthe following adverse 
events :

Center -involved (ci) (central ETDRS subfield) DME
Drop of BCVA of 1 0letters or more from baseline
The assessment will be continued after treatment discontinuation if possible.
Treatment of the vision threatening complication should follow local standards and 
guidelines, i.e. treatment of ci DME with anti -VEGF or other appropriate measures, at the 
discretion of the investigator. 
8.1.3 Albumin uria
Albuminuria evaluations were removed from the protocol via Amendment 3. 
8.1.4 Visual function questionnaire (VFQ -25)
VFQ -25evaluations were removed from the protocol via Amendment 3 . 
8.2 Safety assessments
Planned time points for all safety  assessments are provided in the SoA.
8.2.1 Physical examination
A physical examination (by  means of inspection, palpation, auscultation) will be performed 
by a ph ysician at the study  site and will cover at least the organs of the cardiovascular, 
respiratory  and abdominal sy stems.  Measuring the body  temperature will be included.
Abnormal ph ysical examination findings are recorded either as medical history  or as AEs in 
the eCRF.
Body weight will be measured b y a member of the investigator’s team under the following 
conditions:
Participant in light clothing without shoes after havi ng emptied the bladder
Analogue or digital scale phy sician scale, measurement precision 0.1 kg
Height will be taken at screening onl y.
The BMI will be calculated by  Data Management o nthe eCRF based on weight and height.
8.2.2 Vital signs
Pulse rate and s ystolic / diastolic blood pressure will be measured repeatedly pre -dose, and on 
the time points provided in the SoA (Section 1.3) after th e initial dose and at steady  state of 
each dose -level. 
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 4 (Global)
BAY 1101042 /20739
09 FEB 2023 Page: 52of 95
Vital signs will be measured in a supine or semi -supine position after ≥5minutes rest. Vital 
signs should alway s be measured before blood draws when scheduled at the same time point.  
Blood pressur e and pulse rate measurements will be performed with a completely  automated 
device. 
8.2.3 Electrocardiograms
ECGs are recorded with a computerized 12 -lead ECG device after the participants rested for 
at least 5minutes in supine position (small pillow under he ad allowed).  These ECGs are 
evaluated b y the investigator for safet y signals . ECGs will be transferred to central reading 
center for evaluation . 
During Part1up to study Visit 6(inclusive) , triplicate ECG tracings are to be recorded. 
These triplicate tracings may be transferred to a central ECG reading center for later QT 
evaluation .The results of the QT evaluations may be reported separatel y.
Forpart 2 single ECGs will be recorded and transferred to a central ECG reading center for
evaluation.
The following ECG parameters will be determined and transferred to the database :
Ventricular rate, PR interval, QRS -duration, QT interval.  
The QT interval will also be corrected for the heart rate using QTcB and Fridericia's method, 
i.e. by  dividing the observed QT interval b y the cube -root of RR:
QTcF=QT
√RR 
8.2.4 Clinical safety laboratory assessments
See Section 10.2 for the list of clinical laboratory  tests to be performed and to the SoA for the 
timing and frequency . 
The investigator must review the laboratory  report, document this review, and record any  
clinically  significant changes occurring during the study  as an AE. The laboratory  reports 
must be filed with the source documents. 
Abnormal laboratory  findings ass ociated with the underly ing disease are not considered 
clinically  significant unless judged b y the investigator to be more severe than expected for the 
participant's condition.
All laboratory  tests with values considered clinically  significantl y abnormal d uring 
participation in the study  or within one month after the last dose of study  intervention should 
be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinicall y 
significant b y the investigator or the medical monitor .
If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by  
the investigator, the etiology  should be identified ,and the sponsor notified.
All protocol -required laboratory  tests, as defined in Section 10.2, must be conducted in 
accordance with the laboratory  manual and the SoA. 
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 4 (Global)
BAY 1101042 /20739
09 FEB 2023 Page: 53of 95
If laboratory  values from non -protocol specified laboratory  tests performed at the institution’s 
local laboratory  require a change in participant management or are considered clinically  
significant b y the investigator ( e.g.SAE or AE or dose modification), then the results must be 
recorded.
Clinically  relevant changes, especially  when re sulting in a decision against dose titration, are 
to be documented as AE, with details on the respective lab results provided in the comment 
field of the AE page in the eCRF.
In case of clinicall y relevant abnormal laboratory  results, the investigator has the discretion to 
perform unscheduled repeat laboratory  examinations earlier than at the intervals provided in 
theSoA in Section 1.3.  These unsch eduled examinations should be processed by  the central 
lab to ascertain that the data will be included in the database.  At the investigator’s discretion, 
additional laboratory  parameters may  be investigated and samples may  be processed b y the 
local lab. In case of relevant liver enzy me elevation ( see also Section 10.5), the investigator 
should perform a repeat serum chemistry  panel 2 times per week (including serum 
transaminases [AST and AL T] and serum bilirubin), frequency  of retesting can dec rease to 
once a week if laboratory abnormalities decrease and participant is as ymptomatic.
Estimation of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
eGFR will be calcula ted using CKD -EPI formula ,using the serum creatinine concentration 
measured at screening (Kidney  Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD Work 
Group 2013 ).  The calculation will be done by the central lab oratory .In case of a decrease b y 
≥40%,a critical alert will be provided to the investigator , as it may  represent a reason for 
treatment discontinuation, as described in Section 7.1.2 .
8.2.5 Pregnancy testing
During the initial treatment phase, b oth urine and serum ß-hCG pregnancy  testsare planned to 
be conducted in women enrolled in this clinical study .  Dip stick u rine pregn ancy tests allow 
the investigator t o take action while the participant is at site in case of a positive test. Serum 
pregnancy  tests are intended to confirm negative test results with higher reliability  than urine 
tests. Later during the st udy, urine pregnancy  tests donotneed to be performed at visits 
where blood isdrawn for a serum pregnancy  test.
Pregnancy  tests are to be performed in all femal e study  participants , unless anatomically  
sterile, at all study  visits, regardless of age and fertility  status. When visit intervals are 
extended to 8 weeks after completion of 24 weeks of treatment (Visit 12), additiona lurine 
pregnancy  tests are to be performed four weeks after e ach visit up to Visit 15, in line with the 
CTFG contraception guidance (CTFG 2014 ).

8.3 Adverse events (AEs) ,serious adverse events (SAEs) and other safety 
reporting
The definitions of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) can be found in 
Section 10.3.
AEs will be reported b y the participant (or, when appropriate, b y a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant's legall y authorized representative).
The investigator and an y qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for 
following up all AEs, considered related to the study  intervention or study pr ocedures, or that 
caused the participant to discontinue the study  intervention (see Section 7).
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality  of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section 10.3.
8.3.1 Time period and frequency for collecting AE and SAE information
All AEs/ SAEs will be collected from the signing of the I CFuntil 28days after end -of 
treatment or until the follow -up visit (whichever comes later) at the time points specified in 
the SoA (Section 1.3).
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee immediately and under no 
circumstance should this exceed 24 hours of learning of the event , as indicated in 
Section 10.3.4 . The investigator will submit any  updated SAE data to the sponsor within 
24hours of it being available.
TEAE swillbe defined as those AEs that occurred after first dosing and those existing pre -
dose AEs that worsened severit y post -dose during the main treatment period until 28 days 
after the last dose of the study  drug.
Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek information on AEsor SAE safter conclusion 
of the study  participation / the End -of-Study  visit . However, if the investigator learns of an y 
AE/SAE, including a death, at any  time after a participant has bee n discharged from the study , 
and he/she considers the event to be reasonabl y related to the study  intervention or study  
participation, the investigator must promptly  notify  the sponsor. 
8.3.2 Method of detecting AEs and SAEs
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AEoccurrences.
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 4 (Global)
BAY 1101042 /20739
09 FEB 2023 Page: 55of 95
8.3.3 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proa ctivel y follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and AEs of special interest (as defined in 
Section 8.3.6 ), will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3). Further 
information on follow -up procedures is provided in Section 10.3. 
8.3.4 Regulatory reporting requirements for SAEs
Prompt notification by  the investigator to the sponsor of a nSAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of participants and the safet y of 
a study  intervention under clinical investigation are met. 
The sponsor has a legal responsibility  to notify  both the local regulatory  authority  and 
other regulatory  agencies about the safet y of a study  intervention under clinical 
investigation. The sponsor will comply  with countr y-specific regulatory  requirements 
relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory  authority , IRB /IEC, and investigators.
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safet y information (e.g. summary or list ing of SAEs) from the sponsor will 
review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify  the 
IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
For all studies except those using medical devices ,investigator safet y reports m ust be 
prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions according to local regulatory  
requirements and sponsor policy  and forwarded to investigators as necessary .
8.3.5 Pregnancy
Details of all pregnancies in female participants and, if indicated, fem ale partners of male 
participants will be collected after the start of study  intervention and until the end -of 
study  visit .
If a pregnancy  is reported, the investigator will record pregnancy  inform ation on the 
appropriate form and submit it to the sponsor within 24 hours after obtaining the 
necessary  signed informed consent sfrom the parents .
While pregnancy  itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any  pregnancy  
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported 
as an AE or SAE.
Abnormal pregnancy  outcomes ( e.g.spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAEs , and will be reporte d as 
such.
The participant /pregnant female partner will be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy . The investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant /
pregnant female partner and the neonate and the information will be forwarded to the 
sponsor.
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 4 (Global)
BAY 1101042 /20739
09 FEB 2023 Page: 56of 95
Any post -study  pregnancy -related SAE considered reasonabl y related to the study  
intervention by  the investigator will be reported to the sponsor as described in 
Section 8.3.4 . While the investigator is not obligated to activel y seek this information in 
former stud y participants /pregnant female partner , he or she may  learn of an SAE 
through spon taneous reporting.
Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study  will 
discontinue study  intervention.
8.3.6 Adverse events of special interest (AESI)
Adverse events of special interest have to be reported to the sponsor along the timelines set 
for serious adverse events (even though they  may  not be classified as serious), i.e. within 
24hours of the investigator´s awareness, as described in Section 10.3.4 .
Adverse events of special interest are:
Adverse events suggestive of hepatic injury  (please refer to Section 10.5)
Syncope/loss of consciousness 
Acute kidney  injury  suggested by  2.0 fold increase in serum creatinine or > 50% 
decrease in eGFR
8.4 Pharmacokinetics
Plasma samples will be collected f or measurement of plasma concentrations of 
runcaciguat and its metabolites M1, M6 and M7 as specified in SoA. Instructions for the 
collection and handling of biological samples will be provided b y the sponsor. Atvisits 
with pre -dose (trough, before intake of study  intervention ) sampling, stud y intervention 
will be administered at the study  center b y stud y personnel and the exact time of study 
intervention intake on the day  before the visit and on the day  of the v isit and the exact 
sampling time will be recorded in the eCRF. Ideally  the study  personnel should contact 
the participant prior to these visits to remind them not to take the study  intervention as 
usual in the morning at home and to document the exact tim e of study  intervention intake 
on the day s before the visit.  For Visit 7, the participant s should be advised to take their 
drug as usual in the morning at home and document the time of drug intake.
The actual date and time (24 -hour clock time) of each sam ple will be recorded. In 
addition, the actual date and time of study  intervention intake on the day  prior to the visit 
day and the actual date and time of study  intervention intake on the visit day  will be 
documented.in the eCRF.
Concentration data will b e summarized descriptively .These data are trough (pre -dose) 
plasma concentrations of runcaciguat by  visit at Visits 3 -6, and 815.Further details will 
be specified in the statistical anal ysis plan .  
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 4 (Global)
BAY 1101042 /20739
09 FEB 2023 Page: 57of 95
Pharmacokinetic data for runcaciguat collected during the study  will be analy zed at the 
end of study  using nonlinear mixed effects models. Mixed effects models, or population 
type models, describe the relationship between e.g. dose, time and pharmacological 
observations such as plasma drug concentrations. Both structural and random effects are 
involved in this relationship. A population PK model may be developed to characterize 
the PK of runcaciguat over the entire treatment period using individual runcaciguat 
concentration data. Individual PK parameters of runcaciguat may  be calculated. PK/PD 
models may  be developed to relate parameters of clinical safet y and efficacy response 
with runcaciguat plasma concentrations. The details of the anal yses will be described in a 
separate M&S Analy sis Plan, and the results will be reported in a separate M&S 
Report separatel y from the main clinical study report.
Drug concentration information that would un mask the study  will not be reported to 
investigative sites or blinded personnel until the study  has been un masked .
Details about the collection, processing, storage and shipment of samples will be 
provided separatel y (e.g. sample handling sheets or laboratory  manual).
8.5 Genetics
Genetic anal yses may be part of the biomarker investigations in th is study . Genetic anal yses 
areprimarily done to address altered drug metabolism ,in particular genetic variants that may 
influence runcaciguat exposure and factors predisposing tocardiovascular and /oreye disease s. 
The exact genetic variant may  arise du ring the clinical program. 
Genetic anal yses relate to gene variants such as single nucleotide pol ymorphisms of drug 
transporters and/or drug metabolizing enzy mes including enz ymes of the cytochrome P450
system , the Solute Carrier Famil yor uridine 5 ′-diphosphate -glucuronos yltransferase. 
Different variants predispose to altered metabolization of drugs and may result in differen ces 
in runcaciguat exposure. Genetic anal yses may  be pivotal to understanding the pharmacology  
of runcaciguat and support its safe and efficac ious use resulting in an improved benefit/risk 
ratio.
Genetic factors p redisposing to cardiovascular and/or ey e disease may be variants which 
effect oxidative stress and/or the NO pathway . Oxidative stress and a d ysfunctional N O 
pathway  are hallmarks of diabetic retinopathy  and other (cardio -)vascular diseases. The stud y 
drug acts on soluble guanylate cy clase to produce cGMP in the absence of sufficient NO. 
Therefore, it is conceivable that certain genetic variants encoding comp onents of the NO -
cGMP pathway  or genetic variants associated with oxidative stress may  influence a 
participants response to treatment with runcaciguat . In addition, genetic variants may  
influence the course of disease. For example, asymmetric dimethyl argi nine inhibits 
endogenous NO production. I ts breakdown is mainly  governed b y two enzymeisoforms for 
which several genetic variants exist. Studies have demonstrated that different variants are 
associated with different asymmetric dimethy l arginine levels and therefore NO and cGMP 
bioavailability . 
The genetic sample may  be used to test for individual single nucleotide polymorphisms
deemed relevant tobetter understand observations related to pharmacokinetics, mode -of-
action -related and / or safety of runcaciguat and to further investigate pathomechanisms

deemed relevant to diabetic retinopathy , cardiovascular disease, and associated health 
problems . Whole genome sequencing is excluded.
8.6 Biomarkers
In this stud y, genetic as well as non -genetic biomarkers will be investigated. 
8.6.1 Laboratory biomarkers
Biomarkers will be evaluated in samples collected before ,during and after treatment in order 
to determine the impact of runcaciguat. These markers fall into the following categories:
A.Biomarkers which may be related to the mode -of-action of the study drug :
e.g.vasoactive agents such as cGMP, Ky nurenines or other try ptophan metabolites
B.Functional markers of the cardiovascular system and cardiometabolic ma rkers :
e.g.B-type natriuretic peptide , Kidney  Injury  Molecule -1, neutrophil gelatinase -
associated lipocalin , clusterin, osteopontin, cy statin -C, uromodulin, heart -fatty acid 
binding protein, markers of inflammation and/or fibrosis ,metabolic markers 
(e.g. adiponectin, apolipoproteins, HbA1c, glucose, (gluco)corticoids) , or markers 
reflecting the oxidative stress status.
C.OMICS /Untargeted Multiplex Analysis: A sample may be collected for 
(untargeted) anal ysis (e.g. untargeted metabolomics) in order to iden tify ‘de novo ’ 
pharmacod ynamic biomarkers, biomarkers which support the understanding of the 
mode -of-action and/or biomarkers which may  indicate disease progression. 
D.Further biomarkers related to the mode of action or the safety ofruncaciguat and
similar drugs may  be examined. The same applies to further biomarkers deemed 
relevant to NPDR , (cardio)vascular diseases and associated health problems. These 
investigations may  include e.g. diagnostic, safet y, PD, monitoring, or potentially  
predictive biomarkers.
The following sample types will be collected for biomarker anal ysis:
Plasma
PK or safet y lab samples (leftovers) may be used for biomarker investigations. 
Generally ,plasma is coll ected for biomarker analysis. Refer to sample handling 
sheets for further details as some lab oratorie s may request serum for particular 
tests.
Serum (optional)
Whole blood
Timing –Theplanned time points of sample collection are provided in the SoA in 
Section 1.3.If deemed necessary , the sampling time points or frequency  according to the SoA 
may be adjusted .
Sample handling and storage –detail s on the collection, processing, shipment and storage of 
samples will be provided in separate documents (e.g. sample handling sheets or lab manual). 
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 4 (Global)

Samples may  be stored for a maximum of 15 y ears (or according to local regulations) 
following the end of t he study  at a facilit y selected by the Sponsor to enable further anal yses.
Reporting –Biomarker investigations may be reported separatel y (e.g. in a biomarker
evaluation report) except for biomarkers ofCategory A above , and serum lipoprotein(s) . 
8.6.2 Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) –only in Part 1
ABPM evaluations were removed from the protocol via Amendment 3.
8.7 Immunogenicity assessments
Not applicable .
8.8 Health economics
Health Economics/Medical Resource Utilization parameters are not evaluated in this study .
9. Statistical considerations
As of amendment 3, this Section and its sub -sections were integrated from Master Protocol. 
In this section, the following terminology  will be used:
‘Clinical activity ’ will be used as a s ynon ym for ‘superiority  of runcaciguat vs placebo’. 
‘Clinical relevance’ will be used with its usual meaning (i.e. an effect that is sufficiently 
high to be of clinical interest).
9.1 Statistical hypotheses
The primary  endpoint is the proportion of patients with “ ≥2-step improvement in DRSS at 
48weeks of treatment in the study  eye”.  This proportion will be denoted as     within the 
runcaciguat treatment arm and as     within the Placebo treatment arm.
The stu dy will be evaluated using a Bay esian approach with non -informative prior 
distribution.  Using this approach for inference it is possible to base decisions directly on the 
posterior probabilities of the hy potheses of interest.  Therefore, in a Bay esian set ting it is not 
necessary  to specify  an alternative hy pothesis.
The hy potheses of interest are the following: 
Hypothesis of clinical activity :     >    
Hypothesis of clinical relevance:     >0.25

*minimum evaluable for primary endpoint
The relative contribution of Part 1 and Part 2to the combined total of N =98 randomized 
participants may  vary .  The assessment of the primary  endpoint will include the combined 
total of all evaluable participants.  
If unexpectedl y high dropout rates occur (e.g. due to COVI D-19), the number of rando mized 
participants may  be increased by  up to 20%.
The study  will use a Bayesian concept for inference, which is based on the posterior 
probabilities that the research h ypotheses are true.  Proof of concept shall be defined as 
fulfillment of the following c riteria:  
≥90% posterior probability  for the h ypothesis of clinical activity
(i.e.  (    >    |    )≥0.9) 
≥50% posterior probability  for the h ypothesis of clinical relevance
(i.e.  (    >0.25|    )	≥0.5).
The sample size has been chosen to provide at least 90% probability  to obtain proof of 
concept.
The following assumptions have been used
True response probability  for placebo: 10%
True response probability  for runcaciguat 120 mg: 35%
The response criterion is assumed to be binomia lly distributed.  For the Bay esian evaluation, a 
Jeffries’ prior (i.e. a Beta (0.5;0.5) -prior) has been used.  Sample size was determined with a 
simulation approach using the R environment. 
To be able to declare both clinical activity  and clinical relevan ce ≥40evaluable patients are 
needed in both groups.
98 participants will be randomly  assigned to the study  intervention such that approximately  
80evaluable participants complete the study .  Of 98 participants, 18 participants will be 
randomized with a r atio of 2:1 to highest runcaciguat dose and placebo for Part 1(PK/PD).  
80 participants will be randomized with a ratio of 1:1 to placebo and runcaciguat for Part 2
(Table 9-1).

9.4 Statistical analyses
The statistical anal ysis plan will be finalized prior to unmask ingand it will include a more 
technical and detailed description of the statistical anal yses described in this section.  This 
section is a summary  of the planned statistical analy ses of the mo st important endpoints 
including primary  and key  secondary  endpoints.
9.4.1 General considerations
All data will be listed and study  summary  tables as well as graphical illustrations will be 
provided where appropriate.  Summary  statistics will be presented per d ose step for the 
participants treated with runcaciguat and for all participants treated with placebo for the 
original data as well as for the difference to baseline.  Frequency  tables will be provided for 
qualitative data.
For handling of missing data for the primary  endpoint, see Section 9.4.2 .  Statistical analy sis 
will be based on the available data.  Anal ysis will be performed considering all val id data 
observed for the respective anal ysis sets.  All missing or partial data will be presented in the 
subject data listing as they are recorded on the case report form.  
Baseline is defined as the last pre -dose assessment before first study  interventio n. 
Statistical analy sis will be performed using Statistical Anal ysis Sy stem (SAS).  The version 
used will be specified in the statistical analy sis plan.
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 4 (Global)
BAY 1101042 /20739
09 FEB 2023 Page: 62of 95
9.4.2 Primary endpoint
Theprimary  endpoint is “ ≥2-step improvement in DRSS at 4 8weeks of treatment in the
study  eye”.  
Missing data for this endpoint will be imputed using the last measured DRSS score prior to 
this.
If the last measured DRSS score alread y showed an improvement by ≥2 steps at the last 
measurement prior to the missing assessment, the particip ant will be considered a responder 
for the primary  endpoint.  Otherwise, the participant will be considered a non -responder.
Participants that had a vision -threatening complication as defined in Section 8.1.2 prior to the 
missing assessment will be considered non -responders.
The primary  anal ysis will be conducted using a Bay esian framework.  This decision depends 
upon the following criteria: 
(a)there is ≥90% posterior probability  for superiority  vs placebo and 
(b)if there is ≥50% posterior probability  that the proportion of patients with DRSS 
≥2-step improvement exceeds 25%.  
The response criterion is assumed to be binomially  distributed wit hin each treatment arm.  For 
the Bay esian evaluation, a Jeffries’ prior (i.e. a Beta (0.5;0.5) -prior) will be used.  Under these 
assumptions, the posterior distribution for the parameter will be a Beta (k+0.5,n -k+0.5) -
distribution, where 
k is the numbe r of patients with DRSS ≥2step improvement within the respective 
study  arm and 
n is the number of participants within the respective study  arms .
In order to demonstrate criterion (a), the posterior distribution of     −    will be used to 
estab lish the posterior probability  that     −    >0(e.g. b y using a Monte -Carlo -
approach). 
The posterior distribution for criterion (b) can be directly  evaluated from the Beta (k+0.5,n -
k+0.5) -distribution in the runcaciguat arm. 
This primary  anal ysis will be conducted on the PPS.  A sensitivity  anal ysis will be performed 
on the FAS.  Further sensitivity  anal yses will include a separate anal ysis for each runcaciguat 
dose level that was reached during titration (on the PPS), as well as an analysis in the 
subpopulation of participants without major changes in vital signs (i.e. s ystolic blood pressure 
and pulse rate). Another sensitivity  anal ysis will be conducted using multiple imputations for 
missing data . This anal ysis will be described in the SAP in a more detailed way .

10.3 Appendix 3: AEs and SAEs : Definitions and procedures for recording, 
evaluating, follow -up, and reporting
10.3.1 Definition of AE
AE definition
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, associated 
with the use of study  intervention, whether or not considered related to the study  
intervention.
NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) associated 
with the use of study  intervention.
Events meeting the AE definition
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , orurinaly sis) 
or other safet y assessments ( e.g.ECG, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically  
significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (i.e. not related 
to progression of underl ying disease).
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y intervention administration e ven 
though it may  have been present before the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected intervention -intervention
interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
interventio n or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as 
an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -
harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.
Events NOT meeting the AE definition
Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  findings or other abnormal safet y 
assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by  the 
investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.
The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the 
participant’s condition.
Medical or surgical procedure ( e.g.endoscopy , appendectom y): the conditi on that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.
Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detect ed at the start of the study  that do not worsen.
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 4 (Global)

09 FEB 2023 Page: 73of 95
10.3.2 Definition of SAE
AnSAE is defined as any AEthat, at any dose:
a. Results in death
b. Is life -threatening
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in 
which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not 
refer to an event, which hy pothetically  might have caused death, if it were more 
severe.
c. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been admitted
(usually  involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency  ward 
for observation and /or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during 
hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills 
any other serious criteria, the event is s erious. When in doubt as to whether 
“hospitalization” occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered 
serious.
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.
d. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
The term disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to 
conduct normal life functions.
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor 
medical significance s uch as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma ( e.g.,sprained ankle) which may  
interfere with or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
f. Other situations:
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised by the investigator in 
deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as 
signific antmedical events that may  jeopardize the participant or may  require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in 
the above definition. These events should usuall y be considered serious.
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive 
treatment for allergic bronch ospasm, blood dy scrasias ,convulsions, or 
development of intervention dependency  or intervention abuse.

09 FEB 2023 Page: 74of 95
10.3.3 Recording and follow -upof AE and/or SAE
AE and SAE recording
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the investigator to review 
all documentation ( e.g.hospital progress notes, laboratory  reports, and 
diagnostics reports) related to the event.
The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information.
It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the particip ant’s 
medical records to sponsor in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE CRF page .
There may  be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are 
requested b y sponsor . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception 
of the participa nt number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records 
before submission to sponsor .
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on 
signs, s ymptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the 
diagnosis (not the individual signs/s ymptoms) will be documented as the 
AE/SAE.
Assessment of intensity
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity  for each AE and SAE 
reported during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: 
Mild: An event that is easily  tolerated by  the participant, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with every day activities.
Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort to interfere with normal 
every day activities.
Severe: An event that pr events normal every day activities. An AE that is 
assessed as severe should not be confused with a nSAE. Severe is a category 
utilized for rating the intensity  of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as severe.
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined 
outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as 
severe.
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 4 (Global)
BAY 1101042 /20739
09 FEB 2023 Page: 75of 95
Assessment of causality
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y 
intervention and each occurrence of each AE/SAE.
A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, 
evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a 
relationship cannot be ruled out.
The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and 
other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study  
intervention administration will be considered and investigated.
The investigator will also consult the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or 
Product I nformation, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that 
he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality .
There may  be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to sponsor . However, it is 
very important that the investigator always make an assessment of 
causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to 
sponsor .
The investigator may  change his/her opinion of causality  in light of follow -up 
informatio n and send a nSAE follow -up report with the updated causality  
assessment.
The causality  assessment is one of the criteria used when determining 
regulatory  reporting requirements.
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of 
supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically  indicated or as 
requested b y sponsor to elucidate the nature and/or causality  of the AE or SAE 
as fully  as possible. This may  include additional laboratory  tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health 
care professionals.
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally  submitted 
documents .
The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 
24hours of receipt of the information.
10.3.4 Reporting of SAEs
SAE reporting to sponsor via an electronic data collection tool
The primary  mechanism for reporting an SAE to sponsor will be the electronic 
data collection tool.
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 4 (Global)
BAY 1101042 /20739
09 FEB 2023 Page: 76of 95
If the electronic s ystem is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data 
transmissio n(see next section) to report the event within 24 hours.
The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as it becomes 
available.
After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool 
will be taken off -line to prevent the entry  of new data or changes to existing data.
If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study  participant or receives 
updated data on a previously  reported SAE after the electronic data collection 
tool has been taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper 
SAE form (see next section) or to the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor by telephone.
Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator Site File .
SAE reporting to sponsor via paper data collection tool
Email transmission of the SAE paper data collection tool is the preferred method 
to transmit this information to the Sponsor .
In rare circumsta nces and if email transmission is not feas ible, notification by  
telephone is acceptable with a cop y of the SAE data collection tool sent by 
overnight mail or courier service.
Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to 
complete and sign the SAE data collection tool within the designated reporting 
time frames.
Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator Site File .
10.4 Append ix 4: Contraceptive guidance and collection of pregnancy 
information
Definitions:
Woman of childbearing potential
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal 
unless permanentl y sterile (see below).
If fertility  is unclear ( e.g.,amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cy cle cannot 
be confirmed before first dose of study  intervention, additional evaluation should be 
considered.
Women in the following categories are not considered women of childbearing p otential
1.Premenarchal
2.Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
Documented h ysterectomy
Documented bilateral salpingectomy
Documented bilateral oophorectom y
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 4 (Global)
BAY 1101042 /20739
09 FEB 2023 Page: 77of 95
For individuals with permanent infertility  due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above, ( e.g.mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity ), investigator discretion should be 
applied to determining study  entry .
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history  interview.
3.Postmenopausal female
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause.
A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range may  be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not usin g hormonal contraception or HRT. 
However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with more 
than one FSH measurement is required. 
Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 
one of the non -estrogen horm onal highl y effective contraception methods if they 
wish to continue their HRT during the stud y. Otherwise, they  must discontinue 
HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study  enrollment.
Contraception guidance :
Female participants of ch ild bearing potential must use a highl y effective method of 
contraception , as shown in Table 10-2. Male participants must agree to use condoms. This
applies from the time of ICF signature until the end of the study  period.  
Table 10-2Highly  effective contraception methods
Implantable hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation
Intrauterine device
Intrauterine hormone -releasing system
Bilateral tubal occlusionHormonal contraception with inhibition of ovulation, 
either estrogen and progestogen containing or 
progesterone -only
Vasectomized partner if sole sexual partner
Sexual abstinence
Modified from: Clinical Trial Facilitation Group 2014: Recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy testing in clin ical 
trials (CTFG 2014 ).
Collection of pregnancy information :
Male participants with partners who become pregnant 
The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy  information on any  male 
participant’s female partner who becomes pregnant while the male participant is in this 
study . This applies onl y to male participants who receive study  intervention.
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 4 (Global)
BAY 1101042 /20739
09 FEB 2023 Page: 78of 95
After obtaini ng the necessary  signed informed consent from the pregnant female 
partner directl y, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate 
form and submit it to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s 
pregnancy . The female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy . Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the 
sponsor. Generally , the follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the 
estimated delivery  date. Any termination of the pregnancy  will be reported regardless 
of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.
Female participants who become pregnant 
The investigator will collect pregnancy  information on any  female participant who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study. The initial information will be 
recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of a participant's pregnancy . 
The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy . The 
investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant and the neonate and 
the information will be forwarded to the sponsor. Generally , follow -up will not be 
required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery  date. Any 
termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.
While pregnancy  itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any  pregnancy  
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be 
reported as an AE or SAE. 
A spontaneous abortion (occurring at < 22 weeks gestational age) or still birth 
(occurring at > 22 weeks gestational age) is always considered to be an SAE and will 
be reported as such. 
Any post -study  pregnancy  related SAE considered reasonabl y related to the study  
intervention by  the investigator will be reported to the spon sor as described in 
Section 8.3.4 . While the investigator is not obligated to activel y seek this information 
in former stud y participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous 
reporting. 
Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study  will 
discontinue study  intervention.
10.5 Appendix 5:Liver safety : Suggested actions and follow -up assessments 
Discontinuation of study  intervention for abnormal liver function should be considered by  the 
investigator when a participant meets one of the conditions outlined in Table 10-3or if the 
investigator believes that it is in best interest of the p articipant.

In participants fulfilling one of the criteria listed in Table 10-3, investigators and participants 
should be alerted regarding non -specific s ymptoms which may  be associated with liver 
dysfunction, including anorexia, nausea, fatigue, right upper abdominal dis comfort, vomiting, 
malaise, jaundice, fever, and rash. Information on these sy mptoms should be askedfor. The 
study  participants should be reminded to contact the study  site immediately , if they  are 
concerned about such s ymptoms and unscheduled liver par ameters should be considered. 
Aclose observation has to be initiated if any of the criteria listed in Table 10-3occurs.
Close observation includes:
Repeat serum chemistry  panel (including serum transaminases and serum bilirubin) up
to twotimes per week. Frequency  of retesting can decrease to once a week or less if 
laboratory  abnormalities decrease and participant is asy mptomatic.
Obtaining a more detailed history  of the s ymptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.
Obtaining a history  of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications 
and herbal and dietary  supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, 
and special diets.
Investi gation of potential alternative causes of liver disease.  This may  include r uling 
out liver injury  by acute viral infection, autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; hy poxic/ischemic hepato pathy and biliary  tract disease. 
This may require performing additional procedures, e.g. ultrasound examinations or 
laboratory  examinations , including but not limited to those listed in Table 10-4. If 
requested , test swill be done retrospectivel y using residual blood/serum samples 
collected at visits before laboratory  abnormalities occurred.
Obtaining a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents.
Obtaining additional tests to eval uate liver function as required, as outlined in a 
separate liver injury  follow -up questionnaire.

10.8 Appendix 8: Protocol amendment history
10.8.1 Amendment 4
The Protocol Amendment Summary  of Changes Table for the current amendment is located 
directly  before the Table of Contents (TOC) .
10.8.2 Amendment 3
As of Amendment 3 and in line with the change in overall development strategy , Part B of the 
study  is obsolete and has been removed from the protocol previously  consisting of 3 modules 
(Master, Part A, Part B). At the same instance, for e ase of documentation and to enhance 
readabilit y a single protocol document was created integrating the relevant information from 
the Master -and Part A documents.
Amendment 3 (04 NOV 2021)
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) 
of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.
Overall rationale for Amendment 3: 
A description of changes and a brief rationale is outlined in the table at the end of this section.  
An overview is given below.
Parallel start of Part 1 and 2 of former Part A 
The sponsor’s clinical development program for runcaciguat comprises two currentl y ongoing 
Phase 2a studies in different indications: Study  20739 (NEON) in patients with NPDR and 
Study  18748 (CONCORD; EudraCT: 2019 -003297 -53) in patients with chronic kidney  
disease (CKD).  Initially , both studies were planned to start at the same time which is wh y the 
NEON -NPDR study  had been designed to start with the safet y-data-generat ing Part 1 before 
initiation of the subsequent study  parts. Runcaciguat, in the two proposed indications, is 
planned to be studied in the same doses, 30, 60, 90 and 120 mg OD orall y administered, with 
the same up -titration schedule. However, the CONCORD st udy started earlier and generated 
safet y data from 147 randomized participants before randomization of the first NEON -NPDR 
participant.  DMC reviews of these data confirm the tolerability  of the planned dosing 
schedule of runcaciguat in a similar patient p opulation.  Details are provided in the master 
protocol Section 2.3.1 .
In view of the above considerations, Part 1 is no longer considered to be a pre requisite to 
initiate the main study  Part 2.  Therefore, both study  parts are initiated independently  from 
each other and will be conducted in parallel.  Also, the focus of the 18 patients to be enrolled 
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 4 (Global)
BAY 1101042 /20739
09 FEB 2023 Page: 83of 95
in study  Part 1 was shifted from generating safet y data to obtaining pharmacody namic data, 
mainly  OCT -A, for PK/PD anal yses.  
Study population 
After initiation of the NEON study , 12 out of 16 screened patients were found to be ineligible. 
Since the initial conception of the NEON -NPDR protocol, two landma rk studies in treatment 
of NPDR with intravitreal aflibercept have been published. The first is Protocol W (Maturi et 
al. 2021 )sponsored b y the DRCR Retina Network providing important new insights. The 
second is the PANORAMA study  (Brown et al. 2021 ), investigating intravitreal injection of 
aflibercept as compared to sham, in a similar population with moderately -severe to severe 
NPDR as in Protocol W.  I n addition, the CONCORD study  investigating runcaciguat in renal 
disease provided preliminary  safety  data indicating that runcaciguat is well tolerated by  
participants with HbA1c up to 11% and renal impairment with eGFR as low as 
25mL/min/1.73 m2.
The eligibility  criteria were, therefore, more closely  aligned with other recent studies in 
similar diabetic patient populations with NPDR or renal disease. This included the 
CONCORD study  investigating runcaciguat in renal disease, the PANORAMA study  and 
DRCR Protocol W both investigating aflibercept in NPDR.  Based on these studies it was 
deemed safe to include patients with HbA1c up to 11% and renal impairment with eGFR of at 
least 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and the definition of diabetic macula edema was specifie d.
The in -and exclusion criteria of the study  were adjusted to better reflect the envisaged study  
population. 
Streamlining of study conduct
Furthermore, some eligible patients refused participation in Part A1 of the clinical trial due to 
the high number and intensity  of study  visits.  Therefore, the overall treatment duration was 
shortened to 48 weeks.  In Part 1, the baseline profile Visit 1b was removed, the length of 
Visits 2 to 6 was shortened to up to 4 hours post dose and the number of assessments w as 
reduced.  These changes can safel y be implemented based on the experience and data obtained 
from the CONCORD study  and are expected to significantly  reduce the burden on study  
participants.
Change in overall development Strategy
The clinical development of runcaciguat so far showed that the compound is well tolerated. 
However, pharmaceutical challenges may  lead to inconvenient dosing regimens and a difficult 
to manage product supply  chain. 
 
The Sponsor still plans to run the NEON -NPDR study  with runcaciguat as a Proof of Concept 
(PoC) trial for sGC activators in NPDR, although runcaciguat will not be further developed. 
The Sponsor believes that this PoC trial will enable the optimal development of other sGC 
activators in NPDR and envisages to switch to such a compound in its portfolio.

As of Ame ndment 3 and in line with the change in overall development strategy , Part B of the 
study  is obsolete and has been removed from the protocol dossier. At the same instance, for 
ease of documentation and to enhance readability , a single protocol document was created 
integrating the relevant information from the Master -and Part A documents. This was done 
by moving all Sections applicable to the Study  Part A document (Section 2 and all of its 
subsections, Sections 4.2 to 4.4, and Section 9 and all of its subse ctions) from the Master 
protocol into the Protocol Part A document without general highlighting as change. Onl y 
changes compared with the prior version of the Master protocol are listed in this Protocol 
document.
The Terms Part A and Part B were retired. P art1 now refers to the PK/PD substudy  and Part 2 
refers to the main part of the PoC study .
Key changes in study design
Section # 
and NameDescription of Change Brief Rationale
Section 1.1 Synopsis / 
RationaleReference added to CONCORD 
studyPreliminary safety information can be 
derived from the CONCORD study that 
investigates runcaciguat in patients with 
chronic kidney disease.
Section 1.1 Synopsis / 
RationaleRationale expanded, by explaining 
the role of the clinical trial in the 
development of a subsequent sGC 
activator for treatment of NPDRLate stage clinical development is not 
planned to be pursued with runcaciguat 
but with other sGC -activator(s).
Section 1.1 Synopsis 
Section 1.3 Schedule of 
Activities (SoA) Deletion of baseline -visit 1b.
The screening visit is called Visit 1 in 
both Parts 1 and 2.Owing to the safety information that 
became available in the meantime from 
the CONCORD study, a baseline profile is 
no longer considered required for the 
assessment of cardiovascular and 
metabolic effects.
Therefore, Visit 1b in Part 1 was 
eliminated; eliminating the need to 
differentiate the two pre -treatment visits.
Section 1.1 Synopsis 
Section 4.1 Overal l design Parts 1 and 2 will run in parallel.  
Therefore, Part 1 was relabeled as 
“PK/PD” sub -part, and description of 
study Parts 1 and 2 adapted 
accordingly. With CONCORD safety data available, 
collection of safety data in a run -in is no 
longer needed p rior to conducting Part 2 
at ophthalmology sites. Part 1 is kept to 
investigate the PK/PD of runcaciguat in a 
subset of participants.

Section 7.2 Participant 
discontinuation
Section 8 Study assessmentsBy shortening the treatment period to 
48 weeks, the end -of-study visit was 
moved to Visit 16, and the 
descriptions of the visits were 
changed accordingly. 
Also, the timeframe fo r secondary 
and “other“ efficacy endpoints has 
been adapted to the new treatment 
duration.
The maximum amount of blood 
collected from each participant over 
the duration of the study was adapted 
to the shortened study duration.48 weeks provide a sufficient ly long 
treatment period to investigate the 
endpoint of 2 -step improvement and may 
provide some preliminary information on 
the occurrence of vision -threatening 
complications. 
Section 2 Introduction The role of the NEON -NPDR in the 
context of sGC activato r development 
was reworded.
Information was added as to the 
exposure of patients with CKD to 
runcaciguat.Clarification on the role of the NEON -
NPDR study in the context of Sponsor’s 
sGC program. 
New information available from clinical 
trial with runcaciguat in other indication 
became available.
Section 2.1 Study rationale The role of the study in the context of 
the development of an sGC activator 
for treatment of NPDR was amendedChange in development strategy.
Section 4.1. Overall study 
design
Section 9.4.3.1 Efficacy
Section 9.4.4 Other Efficacy 
analysesThe treatment period was shortened 
to 48 weeks. Accordingly, the 
timeframe for secondary and “other“ 
efficacy endpoints has been adapted 
to new treatment duration.48 weeks provide a sufficiently long 
treatment period to investigate the 
endpoint of 2 step improvement and may 
provide some preliminary information on 
the occurrence of vision -threatening 
complications.
The primary endpoint analysis at 24 
weeks and the secondary evaluations at 
48 week will allow sufficient data for the 
sponsor’s decisions on the future 
development program of runcaciguat.

Reference to „run -in“ for Part 1 
deleted, and description of study 
Parts 1 (PK/PD) and 2 (Proof of 
Concept) aligned to current situation.With masked CONCORD safety data 
available on a large number of
participants, Part 1, with planned 18 
patients, is no longer needed as a run -in 
preceding Part 2.  The titration scheme 
has been confirmed in the CONCORD 
study.
Section 4.1.2 
Part 2 –Proof of concept Interdependence of Part 2 with Part 1 
deleted, inte rim snap -shot review 
deleted, treatment duration changed 
to 48 weeks.With CONCORD safety data available, 
Part 1 is no longer needed as a run -in 
preceding Part 2.
Section 9.5 Interim analysis Masked safety review at end of 
titration phase of Part 1 delete d.Review no longer required, since safety of 
the titration regimen was confirmed in 
CKD patients in the CONCORD study.
Section 10.1.5.4 Safety 
assessment groupMasked safety review at end of 
titration phase of Part 1 deleted.Review no longer required, s ince safety of 
the titration regimen was demonstrated in

Section 10.2 
Appendix 2: Clinical laboratory

Section 10.6 
Appendix 6:Standardized meal 
(Part 1)Glucose stix and standard meals 
were deleted.With CONCORD safety data available, 
glucose measurements were limited to 
venous glucose from the central safety 
lab analysis.  As a result, standardized 
meals are dispensable as well.
Section 1.3 Schedule of 
activities (SoA) (Tables 1 -3, 1-
4)Deletion of “Anterior and posterior 
segment examination” as well as 
“DRSS 7 -field fundus photography“ 
on Visit 6. Reduction of burden for patients by 
reducing examinations with pupil dilation 
which are not expected to generate 
essential efficacy data.  
Section 1.3 Schedule of 
activities (SoA) Deletion of the 4 -6hour post -dose 
time point in Part 1. 
Activities sche duled for the 4 -6hour 
timepoint were moved to 2 -4 hours 
post dose.This change is intended to reduce patient 
burden.
In healthy participant Phase 1 studies, the 
steep increase in plasma concentrations 
took place within 4 hours post -dose.  
Therefore, plasm a concentrations at 4 
hours post dose are considered a 
reasonable approximation of the effective 
concentration.
Section 1.3 Schedule of 
activities (SoA) 
Section 3 Objectives and 
endpoints
Section 8.1.4 Visual function 
questionnaire (VFQ -25)Deletion of v isual function 
questionnaire (VFQ -25).This change is intended to reduce patient 
burden.
The study recruits patients without 
significant visual impairment.  Also, no 
change in visual function could be seen in 
studies such as the Panorama Study or 
Protocol W over treatment periods of up 
to 2 years.  
Therefore, the VFQ -25 is not expected to 
be sensitive to assess efficacy in this 
clinical trial over a period of only 48 
weeks.
Section 1.3 Schedule of 
activities (SoA) (Tables 1 -3, 1-
4)Deletion of “Anterior and posterior 
segment examination” as well as

pressure monitoring (ABPM)Ambulatory blood pressure 
monitoring was deleted.This change is intended to reduce patient 
burden.
Based on the e xperience from the 
CONCORD study, ambulatory blood 
pressure monitoring is no longer 
considered essential for the compound 
safety assessment in diabetic patients 
treated with runcaciguat.

Section 10.2 
Appendix 2: Clinical laboratory

also urine biomarker sample were 
deleted.Similar data are expected to be generated 
in the CONCORD study. Therefore, the 
uACR assessments were deleted to 
reduce patient burden.
Section 1.3 Schedule of 
activities (SoA) (Table 1 -3)Phone contact 1 and 2 days post visit 
was deleted.Active phone check -up no longer 
considered necessary, considering the 
experience from CKD patients treated 
with runcaciguat indicating good 
tolerability.
Section 1.3 Schedule of

Section 8.2.5 Pregnancy 
testingUrine pregnancy test deleted from 
Visit 7 onwards. Redundant with serum pregnancy test. 
Removed to reduce participant burden. 
Section 2.3.1 Risk assessment
Section 4.3 Justification for 
doseSections updated with exposure and 
safety information derived from 
unmasked assessment of safety data 
from the CON CORD study, along with 
DMC recommendations from the 
CONCORD study.Updates required to justify reduction of 
safety assessments in Part 1 and the 
parallel conduct of Parts 1 and 2.
Tolerability of the dosing regimen and 
titration scheme were confirmed in 
CONCORD study.
Section 2.3.1 Risk assessment
Section 4.3 Justification for 
doseThe permissible eGFR limit has been 
lowered from 45 ml/min to 30 ml/min.In the Phase 2 study of runcaciguat in 
chronic kidney disease (CONCORD), 
runcaciguat was well tolerate d when 
participants with eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min were 
included.
Since a similar tolerability is expected in 
patients with NPDR, it is considered 
appropriate to lower the eGFR exclusion 
threshold. This change is expected to 
facilitate recruitment and to improve th e 
generalizability of the study data (safety 
and efficacy) across the general NPDR 
patient population.
Section 2.3.2 Benefit 
assessmentAn individual clinical benefit from 
participation in the study over 48 
weeks of treatment is unlikely.Discussion of po tential benefits modified 
according to shortened treatment period 
Section 5.2 Exclusion criteria Exclusion criteria 1 and 18 changed 
to allow enrolment of patients with 
HbA1c up to 11% and eGFR as low 
as 30 mL/min.Alignment with selection criteria of t he 
Phase 2 CONCORD study.  In the 
CONCORD study, inclusion of 
participants with HbA1c up to 11% and 
eGFR ≥25mL/min was well tolerated.
The change is expected to facilitate 
recruitment and to improve the 
generalizability of the study data (safety 
and effic acy) across the general NPDR 
patient population.

Section 5.2 Exclusion criteria Definition of diabetic macular edema 
in exclusion criterion 6 changed to 
allow recruitment of patients with 
increased retinal thickness not 
needing treatment intervention, as per 
Investigator judgement, and below 
OCT -determined thickness 
thresholds.Exclusion criterion changed not to 
exclude patients with minor, not clinically 
significant DME unlikely to interfere with 
the planned study interventions and 
assessments. The exclu sion criterion is 
similar to the equivalent exclusion 
criterion in Protocol W .
Section 5.4 Screen failures Rescreening allowed for participants 
screen -failed under prior protocol 
versions.Considering the changes in I/E criteria 
and the time passed since prior 
screening, re -screening of participants 
screen -failed under protocol versions up 
to 3.0 is deemed appropriate.
7.1.1 Permanent 
discontinuation
7.1.2.Temporary 
discontinuationPermanent discontinuation after 
repeated relevant hypotension and 
any othe r repeated discontinuation is 
no longer mandatory but at the 
discretion of the investigator.
An upper duration limit was defined 
for temporary discontinuations.Based on the experience from the 
CONCORD study, a strict rule for 
permanent discontinuation doe s not seem 
to be warranted in case of repeat 
discontinuations. 
Instead an upper limit of days 14 
continuous or 21 days overall off 
treatment was defined as resulting in 
permanent discontinuation
Section 7.1.2 Temporary 
discontinuation eGFR criterion for temporary 
discontinuation aligned with 
CONCORD study protocol.Change necessary due to change in 
exclusion criterion 18 relative to eGFR.
Section 8.2.1 Physical 
examination Assessment of Neuropathy Disability 
score deleted from physical 
examination.Non-core assessment deleted to reduce 
patient burden.  Furthermore, 
ophthalmologists often lack equipment 
and expertise to perform the assessment.
Section 8.2.3 
ElectrocardiogramsTransfer of ECGs to Central reading 
center for QT -assessment to be 
decided lat erConsidering the change in overall 
development strategy, standardized QT 
assessment may not be performed. No 
risk for QT prolongation was identified for 
runcaciguat.
Section 9.2 Sample size 
determinationA clarification was added that the 
primary -endpoi nt assessment will 
include all patients from Part 1 and 
Part 2.  A combined total of 
approximately 98 patients are 
planned to be randomized in both 
parts.  The relative contribution of 
Part 1 and Part 2 to the combined 
total may vary.The number of partici pants in Part 1 could 
deviate from the planned target of 18.  As 
the statistical analysis will be done on the 
combined total of participants in Part 1 
and 2, sample size calculations were not 
done separately for either subpart.
Section 9.4.6 Other Analysis Change in urinary albumin/creatinine 
ratio (UACR) was deleted from the 
protocol.UACR assessment, from the group of 
“other” endpoints, was deleted to reduce 
patient burden as it was considered as 
non-essential for the objective of this 
study in NP DR patients.

has been removed. Late stage clinical 
development is not planned to be pursued 
with runcaciguat but with other sGC -
activator(s ).
Former Part A now corresponds to the

is the same as in the CONCORD study. 
This titration scheme was well tolerated.  
Section 5 Study population A clarification was added that 
participants should show typical 
fundus alterations as described in 
the DRSS criteria for moderately 
severe and severe NPDR without 
DME in need of treatm ent and no 
previous experience of anti -VEGF 
treatment.To depict better the study population.

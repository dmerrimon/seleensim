I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 3
LY3012207Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusio ns:Patients at least 18years of age , ECOG PS 0 to 1, 
anthracycline naïve, with histologically confirmed, advanced or metastatic STS, and not amen able to treatment with 
surgical resection or radiotherapy with curative intent . Patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST )or 
Kaposi’s sarcoma will be excluded.
Test Product, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:   Olaratumab: injection for intravenous (IV) use, supplied in 
single -use 500 mg/50 mL vials containing 10 mg/mL of product in histidine buffer, administered to patients as an IV
infusion at 15 mg/kg on Days 1 and 8. Cycles are21 days in length.
Reference Therapy, Do se, and Mode of Administration:   Placebo:   injection for IVuse, supplied in single -use 
vials, administered to patients as an IVinfusion on Days 1 and 8. Doxorubicin:   commercial formulations will be 
used and administered intravenously.  Doxorubicin (75 mg/m2) is to be administered on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle, 
for 8 cy cles.  Dexrazoxane :Commercially available d exrazoxane may be administered at a 10:1 ratio 
(dexrazoxane:doxorubicin) at the investigator’s discretion, prior to each doxorubicin infusion for the prevention of 
cardiotoxicity and its use is recommended in patients receiving 5 or more cycles of doxorubicin. Dexrazoxane
should be administered after completion of the olaratumab/placebo infusion , prior to administration of doxorubicin .  
Doxorub icin should be administered within 30 minutes of receiving d exrazoxane .
Planned Duration of Treatment:   Treatment continue suntil there is evidence of disease progression, death, 
intolerable toxicity, or other withdrawal criteria are met.  Doxorubicin plu s olaratumab/placebo will be administered
for 8 cycles, or until there is evidence of disease progression, death, intolerable toxicity, or other withdrawal criteria 
are met.  Patients who discontinue doxorubicin due to unacceptable toxicity prior to the co mpletion of the planned 
8cycles, may continue receiving single -agent olaratumab/placebo until there is evidence of disease progression, 
death, intolerable toxicity, or other withdrawal criteria are met.   Patients whocomplete 8 cycles of combination 
treatment will continue to receive olaratumab /placebo monotherapy  at the same dose and schedule until there is 
documentation of disease progression, death, intolerable toxicity, or other discontinuation criteria are met.
Short -term follow -up (postdiscontin uation):   30 days (±7 days)
Long -term follow -up (postdiscontinuation): every 6 weeks [±7 days] until PD, thereafter every 2months [±7 days ]
for the first 2 years, then every 6 months [±14 days ]until the patient’s de ath or overall study completion
Contin ued access:   After study completion, patients on study treatment who continue to experience clinical benefit 
and no undue risks , in the opinion of the investigator, may continue to receive study treatment until one of the 
criteria for discontinuation is me t.  A continued access follow -up visit will occur 30 days (±7 day s)after 
discontinuation.
Criteria for Evaluation:
Efficacy:   Overall survival (time from randomization to death) is the primary per -patient measure for efficacy.
Radiographic assessments will be performed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (Response 
Evaluatio n Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST ], Version 1.1) criteria, will be performed every 6 weeks (±7days)
until radiographic documentation of PD.
The following addi tional efficacy measures will be determined for each patient, with planned statistical analyses 
specified in Section 12and in the Statistical Analysis Plan (a separate document). Specific definitions of each of 
these measures (such as defining events and censoring for each time to event endpoint) will be pro videdin the 
Statistical Analysis Plan.  
Progression -free survival (PFS)
Objective Response Rate (ORR) 
Disease Control Rate (DCR)
Duration of response (D oR)
Duration of disease control
Time to any  progression (death without progression censored)
Time to any new metastases (censoring for death and for other type of PD)
New-metastases -free survival (nMFS)
Time to any  progression based solely on increased sum of target lesions
Time to first worsening of pain and HRQoL
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 4
LY3012207Time to first worsening of ECOG perform ance status 
Safety:   Safety will be evaluated based on reported adverse events (AEs), physical examinations, vital signs,
laborato ry tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and results from echocardiograms (ECHOs) or multigated acquisition 
(MUGA) scans. Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRATM) 
and graded using the National Cancer Institute -Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE), 
Version 4.0. Clinical laboratory toxicity will be g raded using NCI -CTCAE criteria, Version 4.0 .
Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs): Pain will be assessed with the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form Modified 
[mBPI -sf], HRQoL will be assessed with The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Qu ality 
of Life Questionnaire Core 30 version 3.0 [EORTC QLQ -C30] andhealth state will be assessed with the EuroQol 5-
Dimension 5 -Level [EQ-5D-5L] . Patients will complete the instruments on Day 1 of every cycle and at the 30 -day 
short -term follow -up visit .  A full due diligence will be taken to collect PRO measures during long-term follow -up 
(every 6 weeks [±7 days] until PD, thereafter ever y 2 mo nths [±7 day s] for the first 2 years, then ever y 6 mo nths 
[±14 days] until the patient’s death or overall study completion).
Immunogenicity :  Blood samples will be collected to determine olaratumab antibodies in serum at baseline, during 
the study ,and in the event of an olaratumab infusion -related reaction (IRR) serum will be collected as soon as 
possible after the onset, at the resolution, and 30 days after the IRR .
Pharmacokinetic s:  Blood samples will be collected to assess the serum concentrations of olaratumab and the plasma 
concentration of doxorubicin . Serumconcentrations of olaratumab will be assayed using a validated enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA )method .  Doxorubicin concentrations in plasma will be analy zedusing a validated 
liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS )assay .
Biomarkers :  Samples will be collected and analy ses willbe performed on biomarkers relevant to pathways 
associated with STS, the mechanism of action of olaratumab or doxorubicin, and/or cancer -related conditions, and 
may also be used for related research methods.  The evaluation of the samples may involve analysis of DNA, RNA, 
and/orproteins .  
Statistical Methods:
The primary objective of this study is to compare olaratumab plus doxorubicin (experimental arm) versus placebo 
plus doxorubicin (control arm) in terms of OS in patients with advanced, metastatic STS.  The study will screen 
approximately 500 patients to enroll 460 patients in 1:1 randomization (230 patients in the experimental arm and 
230 patients in the control arm).  The intent -to-treat sample size of 460 was selected assuming the final analysis of 
OS will occur when at least 322 OS events have been observed; therefore, the sample size of 460 ensures a 
maximum of 30% censoring at the final OS analysis.  
The final total of 322 OS events (deaths) is an appropriate minimum for the final analysis of OS, providing 80% 
statistical power for a two -sided log -rank tes t at a 0.05 significance level (assuming the true OS HR is 0.73).  An OS 
HR of 0.73 corresponds approximately to an increased median survival from 15 months (estimated from published 
clinical data in various types of patients with advanced or metastatic ST S as well as based on the JGDG trial results) 
in doxorubicin alone to 20.5 months for olaratumab combined with doxorubicin.  
Two interim efficacy analyses for OS are planned after 120 (37% of the targeted final number of 322 OS events) and 
194 OS events ( 60% of the final OS events) have been observed.  An O’Brien -Fleming alpha spending function will 
be used to determine the efficacy boundary.  Approximate O’Brien -Fleming alpha levels and OS HR boundaries for 
thetwo interims and the final analysis are as follows (using EAST®6.3): 
First interim:  120 events, alpha = 0.0005, HR < 0.525
Second interim:  194 events, alpha = 0.0075, HR < 0.680
Final:  322 events, alpha = 0.0476, HR < 0.801
An overall two -sided alpha level of 0.05 is maintained across interim and final analyses of OS through the use of 
this O’B rien-Fleming method.  In addition, a scheme (e.g. Glimm et al. 2010) for maintaining a 0.05 study -wise 
alpha error rate across OS and the following secondary e ndpoints will be pre -specified in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan:
PFS
ORR
DCR
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 5
LY3012207Duration of response
Duration of disease control
Time to event analyses at both the interim and final analysis time points will be based on the stratified log -rank test, 
stratifie d by randomizatio n strata (case report form [CRF] data ).  The testing boundaries (approximate values can be 
found in Section 12.1) will be determined using an O’Brien -Fleming alpha spending function.  OS survival curves, 
the median with 95% CI and survival rates at various time points for each treatment group will be estimated using 
Kaplan -Meier method (Kaplan and Meier 1958) .  The HR wi ll be estimated using a stratified Cox regression model, 
stratified by randomization strata (CRF data).  All randomized patients, according to the ITT principle, will be 
included in the analysis of this endpoint.
The interim analy ses will be performed by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC).  The iDMC Charter 
(a separate document) will provide detailed guidance for the conduct of the interim analyses and describe the 
process for recommending changes to the trial in the event that interim OS results are statistically significant.  In the 
event of a statistically significant interim result for OS, investigative sites will be informed that the study has met its 
primary  objective and thus confirmed the efficacy of olaratumab in combination with d oxorubicin .  It is 
recommended that any patients currently receiving study treatment at the time of a positive interim result should 
continue his/her study treatment as originally planned.  This recommendation is appropriate given that any positive 
interim result will not support the use of olaratumab in patients who have (currently or previously) received 
treatment with single -agent doxorubicin.
Safety:   Safety analyses will be performed on the safety population (that is, all randomized patients who received at 
least 1 dose, including a partial dose, of any study treatment, and will include summaries of incidences of treatment -
emergent adverse events ( TEAEs )by maximum CTCAE grade that oc curred during the study treatment period or 
within approximately 30 days after the decision is made to discontinue of study treatment.  Additionally, the 
following (but not limited to) safety -related outcomes will be summarized:  study treatment discontinu ation due to 
TEAEs, deaths during the study treatment period or within 30 days after the decision is made to discontinue of study 
treatment, treatment -emergent serious adverse events ( SAEs )during the study treatment period or within 30 days 
after the decision is made to discontinue study treatment, hospitalizations, and transfusions during the study 
treatment period or within 30 days after the decision is made to discontinue study treatment.
Adverse events (AEs), including TEAEs, will be listed and summarized in frequency tables using MedDRA.  
Severity  of AEs will be classified using CTCAE version 4.0.  Other safety data, such as laboratory tests, 
echocardiography, and vital signs, will be listed and summarized, if appropriate.
Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) :For each instrument (mBPI -sf, EORTC QLQ -C30, and EQ -5D-5L), 
percentage compliance will be calculated as the number of completed assessments divided by the number of 
expected assessmen ts (that is, patients still on study and alive). Data will be s eparately  summarized by treatment 
and time point using descriptive statistics. Analyses of time to first worsening of pain as well as HRQoL domains 
and s ub-domains will be conducted . 
Immunogen icity:  Incidence of anti -olaratumab antibodies will be tabulated. Correlation to olaratumab drug level, 
activity , and safety  will be assessed, as appropriate.
Pharmacokinetic s:  The PK parameters of olaratumab will be computed by nonlinear mixed effect modelling using 
PK data collected for doxorubicin will be analyzed using descriptive methods.
Biomarkers :Analyses will be performed on biomarkers relevant to pathways associated with STS, the mechanism of 
action of olaratumab or doxorubicin, and /or cancer -related conditions .  Assay results will be summarized and 
correlated with clinical outcomes.

5.Introduction
5.1. Soft Tissue Sarcoma
Softtissue sarco ma (STS) is a heterogeneous group of tumors that arise mainly fro m embry onic 
mesoderm ,with som e neuroectoderm al contributi onand different iationto non -epithelial 
extraskeletal tissue including muscle, fat ,and fibrous tissue (D’Angelo et al. 2014).   There are 
approxi mately 50 tumor subty pes of  STS (Sharma et al .
2013) and they can be located anywhere 
in the body . This is a rare tumor group that comprises approximately 1% of adult cancers wit h 
an annual incidence of the disease in the UK and USA, respectively, of 3,300 (ESMO 2014 )and 
10,000 (ACS 2014 ).  STS is best treated by mult idisciplinary teams specialized in the 
management of these tumors (Linch et al .
2014 ).When the disease is localized, it is usually 
treated with curat ive intent using surgical resect ion wi th or wi thout radi otherapy  and 
chemotherapy. Unfortunately, STS recurs frequently as locally inoperable or metastatic disease, 
at whi ch point sy stemic therapy  plays a prominent rol e in the m ultidisciplinary  management of 
this tum or.
Cytotoxi c chem otherapy  has been the m ainsta y therapy  for treating advanced stage STS, 
provi ding overall response rates of abou t 25% in the first -line setting (Linch et al . 2014).
Despite the use of chemotherapy, advanced -stage STS i s almo st invariably  fatal and there i s a
clear need to find novel and effect ive therapies .
For m any decades, anthracycline based chemotherapy  has been the standard first -
line option for 
patients wi th metastati c soft tissue sarco ma. A recent Phase 3 trial performed by the European 
Organizat ion for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) randomized so ft tissue 
sarcoma patients to receive doxorubicin wit h or without ifosfamide (Judson et al . 2014). Patients 
treated with the co mbination achieved a significantly higher response rate and progression -free 
survival co mpared to th ose randomized to single agent doxorubicin. 
However, there was no 
significant difference in overall survival between the two tr eatment arms. In view o f these 
findings, single agent doxorubicin is considered the standard treatment option for many patients 
with metastati c soft tissue sarco ma(NCCN 2011; ESMO 2012 ; Schöffski et al. 2014 ).
Doxorubi cin and ifo sfamide i s often reserve d for pati ents wi th symptom atic di sease or those in 
which down staging could result in surgical resect ion.
A number of rando mized Phase 3trials have demonstrated that dexrazoxane significant ly 
reduces the risk of anthracycline -associated cardi otoxi city, with no effect on progression -free 
and overall survival (Jones 2008).

LY30122075.2. Olaratumab Background
Olaratum ab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G su bclass 1 (IgG1) -type m onoclonal 
antibody  that binds to platelet -derived growth factor rece ptor (PDGFR )α.  This ant ibody
possesses high affinit y binding for PDGFRα and blocks platel et-derived growth factor 
(PDGF) -AA, -BB, and -CC fro m binding to the receptor. In addition to blocking ligand -induced 
cellmitogenesis and receptor autophosphorylati on, olaratumab inhibits ligand -induced
phosphorylat ion of the downstream signaling mo lecul es Akt and mitogen -activated protein
kinase (MAPK).
PDGF/PDGFRα signaling plays a role in both organ and tissue development, as well as in 
pathogenesis of nonmalignant diseases ( for example , pulmo nary fibrosis) and m alignant cancers.  
Many  cancer ty pes have been shown to consistent ly express PDGFRα on tumor tissues, 
including osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and 
others.  In m alignant disease, the PDGF/PDGFRα axis is effect ive in promoting tumor growth 
and proliferat ion through both autocrine and paracrine mechanisms.   
PDGFRα is expressed on 
strom al cells, as well as the cancer cells themselves, within certain tumor s.  Furthermore, studies 
have shown that PDGF/PDGFRα signaling affects tumor vasculature through paracrine 
mediat ion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production (Shah et al. 2010).
5.3. Study Rationale
Previously reported data support the mo lecule being advanced in human trials ,including the 
Sponsor’s Phase 1b/2trial, titled ‘A Phase 1b/2 Rando mized Phase 2 Study Evaluat ing the 
Efficacy of Doxorubicin Wit h or Wi thout a Hum an Anti -PDGFRα Monocl onal Antibody  (IMC -
3G3) in the Tr eatm ent of Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma. ’The experimental Arm A received 
olaratumab (15 mg/kg) on Day 1 and Day 8 plus doxorubicin (75 mg/m²) on Day  1 of each 21 -
day cycle for up to 8 cy cles. The con trol Arm B receiv ed Doxorubicin (75 mg/m2) on Day  1 of
each 21 -day cycle for up to 8 cy cles.  The pri mary  analysis of this tri al (based on 103 PFS events 
observed as of the 15 August 2014 cutoff date) showed a statist ically significant improvement in 
PFS over doxorubicin alone, with a stratified PFS HR of 0.67 (p=0.0615 relat ive to the protocol -
defined two -sided significance l evel of alpha=0.1999]).  The median PFS was 28.6 weeks (6.6 
months) for the invest igational arm and 18.0 weeks (4.1 months) for the con trol arm.At the time 
of the primary  analysis, a n interim analysis of OS(based on 83 events) showed an improvement 
(HR=0.44; p = 0.0005) with a m edian of 64.0 weeks (14.7 months) on the control arm compared 
to108.7 weeks (25 months) for the combinat ion.  The fo llowing Grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) 
occurred in ≥5% of  the popul ation: Arm A> Arm B, neutropenia (51.5% vs 33.8%), anemia 
(12.5% vs 7.7%) ,fatigue (9.4 vs 3.1%) ,and thrombocy topeni a (9.4% vs 7.7 %) ; Arm A < 
ArmB, febrile neutropenia (12.5% vs 13.8 %) and infect ions (6.3% vs 10.8%).  There was no 
significant difference in post-therapy LVEF (Eli Lilly  and Com pany 2014) .
The proposed study  is a Phase 3 trial of the efficacy  and safet y of olaratum ab in co mbinat ion 
with doxorubi cin for the treatm ent of a dvanced or metastati c soft ti ssue sarcoma (STS) that is not 
amenable to treatm ent wi th surgi cal resect ion or radi otherapy  with curative intent.

adverse events (AEs) of olaratum abmay be found in the Invest igator’s Brochure (IB).  
Inform ation on AEs expected to be related to olaratum abmay be found in Sect ion 7 
(Development Core Safet y Inform ation) of the IB.  Information on serious adverse events

LY30122077.Study  Population
Eligible pat ients will have a histol ogical diagnosis of advanced or m etastati c STS, not am enable 
to treatment with surgical resect ion or radi otherapy  with curat ive intent.
All patients m eeting the eligibilit y requirements will be considered for enrollment regardless of
race, religio n, or gender.  The invest igator or the Sponsor will not grant except ions to eligibilit y 
criteria.  Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participat ion in this study within the 21 -day 
screening period (screen failure) may be re -screened .  Note that repeating laboratory tests during 
the 21-day screening period does not constitute re- screening.  Screening laboratory tests m ay not 
be repeated more than once in order to meet eligibilit yduring the 21 -day screening period .  If a 
repeat screening laboratory value meets eligibilit y, it is recommended that the test is rechecked 
to confirm stabilit y.
Patients m ay be considered for re -screening after discussio n with the Lilly study  physician or 
designee.  Patients may be re -screened up to 1 time.  The interval between re -screenings should 
be at l east 28 day s.  Pati ents who will be re-screen edmust sign a new informed consent form 
(ICF) and will be assigned a new ident ificat ion number.
Prospective approval o f protocol  deviati ons to recrui tment and enro llment criteria (also known as 
protocol  waivers or exempt ions) is not permitted.

7.2.1. Rationale for Exclusion of Certain Study Candidates
The exclusio n criteria have been carefully  selected by  the Sponsor to ensure their ethical and 
scientific acceptabilit y, and to help establish specificit y of the pati ent popul ation for both 
efficacy  and safety  analyses.
7.3. Discontinuation
The reason for discontinuat ion and the date of di scontinuat ion will be collected for all patients.  
All rando mized pat ientswho discont inue, regardless of whether or not they  received study  
treatm ent, will have procedures performed as shown in the Study  Schedule ( Attachm ent 1 ).
Patients who are di scont inued f rom the study  treatment early will have fo llow
-up procedures 
perform ed as shown in the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).
If a patient withdraws informed consent, he or she must not be contacted unless he or she has 
explicit lyprovide dpermissio n and consent.  Lilly may cont inue to use previously co llected 
medical research data prior to the withdrawal consistent with the original authorizat ion.
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 27
LY30122077.3.1. Discontinuation of Inadvertently Enrolled Patients
The cri teria for enrollment m ust be fo llowed explici tly. If the invest igator site ident ifies a patient 
who did not me et enrollment criteria and who was inadvertent ly enro lled, the sponsor must be 
notified.   If the sponsor ident ifies a pat ient who did not meet enrollment criteria and who was 
inadvertent ly enro lled, the invest igator site will be notified .  A discussio n must occur between 
the Lilly CRP and the invest igator to determine whether the patient may cont inue in the study , 
with or wi thout study treatment .  
The patient may  continue to receive study  drugs if allof the f ollowing condi tions are m et:
In the opinion o f the invest igator, the patient is receiving benefit
The Lilly CRP or clinical research scient ist (CRS) and the invest igator determines that no 
effect ive alternat ive therapy exists
The Lilly CRP/CRS and the invest igator agree there is no safety concern merit ing 
discontinuat ion of study  drugs
The invest igator must obtain documented approval fro m the Lilly CRP to allow the inadvertent ly 
enrolled patient to continue in the study wit h or without study  treatm ent.
7.3.2. Discontinuation of Patients
In addition, pati ents will be discont inued fro m the study  drug and/or from the study  in the
following circumstances:
enrollment in any other clinical trial invo lving an investigational product or enrollment in 
any other ty pe of medical research judged not to be scient ifically o r medically  com patible 
with this study
investigator/phy sician decisio n
othe invest igator/physician decides that the patient should be discontinued from the 
study  or study drugs
oif the pat ient, for any  reason, requi res treatm ent with another therapeutic agen t 
that has been demo nstrated to be effect ive for treatment of the study  indicat ion, 
discontinuat ion from the study  drugs occurs pri or to introducti on of  the other 
agent
patient deci sion
othe pati ent requests to be discont inued fro m the study  or study drug
sponsor decisio n
oLilly stops the study  or stops the patient’s participation in the study  for medical, 
safet y, regul atory , or other reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulat ions, 
and GCP
evidence of progressive disease
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 28
LY3012207unacceptable toxicit y
significan t nonco mpliancewith study  procedures and/or treatment
The discont inuation reason and date will be collected for all pat ients.  The date of 
discontinuat ion (for any  of the above reasons) from study  treatm ent is to be reported on the case 
report form (CRF).   Patients who discont inue will have fo llow-up procedures performed as 
shown in the Study  Schedule (Attachment 1 ).
7.3.3. Patients who are Lost to Follow -Up
A patient will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be con tacted by  the study  site.  Site personnel are expected to make 
diligent attempts to contact patients who fail to return for a scheduled visit or who the site is 
otherwi se unable to follow.
Site personnel, or an independent third party , will  attem pt to collect the vital status (that is, alive 
or dead) for all enrolled patients who are l ost to foll ow-up, includ ing enrolled patients who do 
not receive study  treatm ent, within legal and ethical boundaries.  Site personnel, or an 
independent third party , may  search public sources for vital status informat ion.  If the patient's 
vital status i s determined, the vital s tatus will be documented and the patient will not be 
considered lost to fo llow-up.
Lilly personnel will not be invo lved in any attempts to collect vital status informat ion.
7.3.4. Discontinuation of Study Sites
Study  site parti cipat ion may be dis continued if Lilly , the invest igator, or the ethical review board 
(ERB) or institutional review board (IRB) of the study  site judges discont inuat ion of study  site 
participat ion necessary  for m edical, safet y, regul atory , ethi cal, or other reasons consistent with 
applicable laws, regulat ions, and GCP.
7.3.5. Discontinuation of the Study
The study  will be di scontinued if Lilly judges discontinuat ion of the study  necessary for medical, 
safet y, regul atory , ethi cal, or other reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulat ions, and 
GCP.

8.1. Summary of Study Design
Study  I5B-MC-JGDJ is a global, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel, placebo -
controlled Phase 3 trial in pat ients with advanced or m etastati c STS who is doxorubicin naïve but 
may have had any number of prior systemic cy totoxic and/or non -PDGF/PDGFR -directed 
therapi es.  Previ ous therapy  must be completed ≥ 4 weeks (28 days) prior to randomizat ion.
Eligible patientswill be randomized 1:1 into 1of 2treatment opti ons(olaratum abplus 
doxorubi cin orplacebo plus doxorubicin ).  Randomizat ion will be stratified by :
Number of prior systemic therapies for advanced/metastatic disease (0 versus ≥1)
NOTE: anyneoadj uvant and adj uvant therap y administered for advanced/metastatic 
disease will not be considered as a prior line of therapy
Histologi cal tum or type (leiomyosarcom a versus liposarcoma versus other STS ty pe)
ECOG perform ance status (0 versus 1)
Region (North America versus Europe versus Rest of World [ROW] )
Patients assigned to the experimental armwill receive olaratum ab15mg/kg IV on Days 1and8 
followed by doxorubicin 75mg/m2 IV on Day 1of a 21-day cycle.  Patients assigned to the 
control  arm will receive placebo 15 mg/kg IV on Days
1and8 followed by doxorubi cin 
75mg/m2 IV on Day 1of a 21-day cycle.
Patients will  receive combinat ion treatment for 8 cycles , 
followed by  monotherapy  olaratumab or 
placebo until evidence of progressi ve disease (PD) , unacceptable toxicit y, death, or other 
withdrawal  criteria are m et.  No crossover will be permitted.
Use of d exrazoxane (in a 10:1 ratio versus doxorubicin dose )to mi tigate cardi otoxi city during 
treatm ent wi th doxorubi cin is allowed attheinvestigator’s discretion and is recommended fo r all 
patients receiving 5 or more cy cles of doxorubicin.

Terms used to describe the periods during the study are defined below:
Baseline:   begins when the ICF is signed and ends at the first study treatment (or at 
discontinuat ion, if no treatment is given) .
Study Period:   begins at the first study treatment and ends at study  com pletion.
oStudy Treatment Period :  begins at the first study treatment and ends when the 
patient and the invest igator agree that the patient will no longer continue study 
treatm ent.  The date of this agreement is to be reported on the case report form 
(CRF) as the Date of Discontinuation from study  treatm ent.
oPost discontinuation Follow -Up:  begins the day after the patient and the 
investigator agree that the patient will no longer cont inue study treatment .
Short -term follow -upbegins the day after the pati ent and the invest igator 
agree that the patient will no longer continue study treatment and lasts 
approximately  30days (±7days).   The short -term follow -up visit occurs at 
or near the end of the short -term follow-up peri od (± 7days).
Long-term follow- upbegins the day after short -term follow-up is 
completed.
Follow- up for progression -Patients that discont inue study 
treatm ent for reasons other than progression will be fo llow every  
6weeks (±7 day s) unt il PD.
Follow- up for survival -Patients will be fo llowed every 2 months 
(±7 day s) for the first 2 y ears, then every  6 months (±14 days) unt il 
the pati ent’s death or overall study  com pletion.
Continued Access Period:   begins after study  complet ion and ends at the end of trial .  
During th e continued access period,patients on study treatm ent who con tinue to 
experience clinical benefit and no undue risks may conti nue to receive study  treatm ent 
until one of the criteria for discont inuat ion is met.  The continued access period includes 
contin ued access follow-up.  Refer to Section 8.1.4 for more details .
oContinued access follow-up:  begins theday after the pati ent and the invest igator

LY30122078.1.1. Baseline and Study Treatment Period Assessments
Baseline radiographic assessment of disease will be performed within 2 8days pri or to 
rando mizat ion; scans perform ed pri or to the date of consent may be used provided they are 
within 28 days o f Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) .
Imaging and tum or assessment will be performed every  6weeks (± 7 days), irrespect ive of 
treatm ent cycles.  Imaging requi rements include CT scan or m agnet ic resonance imaging (MRI) 
of chest, abdom en, and pelvis and other areas ,as clinically indicated .  It i s recommended that CT 
imaging of the abdo men/pelvis be performed with IVcontrast, whenever possible.  If this is not 
feasible/advisable secondary  to hy persensi tivity or other condi tions, then gadolinium -enhanced 
MRI i s preferred.  For patients with known serious allergic react ions to CT contrast material, a 
CT of the chest w ithout contrast and contrast -enhanced MRI of the abdo men/pelvis are 
encouraged.
The patient’s f irst treatm ent will be administered within 7 days fo llowing randomizat ion.  
Patients in both arms will receive any necessary  prem edicati onif needed (see Sect ion9.1.1 ) prior 
to the infusio n of study  therapy  at each treatm ent cycle.
A treatment cy cle will  be defined as 3weeks ( 21days ± 3 day s).  The start of study  treatm ent 
will be considered C1D1 .
Patients in the experimental Arm A will receive:
Olaratum abon Day  1 and Day 8 of every  3-week cycle as an IVinfusio n over 
approximately  60 minutes ,followed by a 1- hour observat ion peri odfor the first 
2cycles.  If there i s no evidence of an 
IRR after the D1 and D8 infusio ns of 
olaratum abin the first 2 cy cles, no observation period is required for subsequent 
treatm ent cycles (in the event an IRR occurs thereafter, then the 1 -hour 
observat ion shoul d be reinst ituted).
Doxorubi cin(after the olaratum ab administrati on and 1- hour observat ion peri od, 
if instituted) on Day  1 of every  3-week cycle as an IVinfusio n over 
approximately  60 minutes for 8 cy cles.  
Dexrazoxane may beadministered at a 
10:1 ratio (dexrazoxane:doxorubicin) at the invest igator’s discretion, within 
30minutes prior to each doxorubicin infusio n forthepreventi on of  cardi otoxi city.  
It is recommended that all patients receiving 5 or more cycles of doxorubicin
receive d exrazoxane .
Patients in the control Arm B will receive:
Placebo on Day  1 and Day 8 of every  3-week cycle as an IVinfusio n over 
approximately  60 minutes ,followed by a 1- hour observat ion peri odfor the first 
2cycles.  If there i s no evidence of an 
IRR after the D1 and D8 infusions of 
olaratum ab durin gthe first 2cycles, no observat ion peri od is requi red for 
subsequent treatment cy cles (in the event an IRR occurs thereafter, then the 1-
hour obse rvation shoul d be reinsti tuted).
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 32
LY3012207Doxorubi cin(after the olaratum ab administrati on and 1- hour observat ion peri od, 
if instituted) on Day  1 of every  3-week cycle as an IVinfusio n over 
approximately  60 minutes for 8 cy cles.  Dexrazoxane may be administered at a 
10:1 ratio (dexrazoxane:doxorubicin) at the invest igator’s discretion, within 
30minutes prior to each doxorubicin infusio n forthepreventi on of  cardi otoxi city.  
It is recommended that all patients receiving 5 or more cycles of doxorubicin
receive d exr
azoxane .
Administrati on and dosing of all therapeut ic products will occur as described in Section 9.1.
Criteria for starting the next cy cle are defined in Section 9.4.1.1 .  Dose reduct ions for 
olaratum ab/placebo will be made in the event of specific treatment -related AEs, as described in 
Secti on9.4.1.1.1 .  Supportive care guideli nes are detailed in Sect ion9.6.1 .  No dose escalat ions 
or re -escalat ions are permitted.
Patients will  undergo radi ographic assessment of disease s tatus (CT or MRI) according to 
RECIST v .1.1), every 6 weeks (± 7 days), as calculated from rando mizat ion, unt il there is 
radiographic documentation of PD.
Patients in both arms will be treated until there is docum ented PD, toxicit y requi ring cessat ion of 
treatm ent, wi thdrawal  of consent, or until other withdrawal criteria are met.  In the event there is 
symptom atic deterioration resul ting in treatm ent discontinuati on, radi ographic confirmat ion 
shoul d be perform ed.  For patients who discont inue treatment for any  reason other than 
radiographically  docum ented PD (for exam ple, symptom atic deterioration), radiographic 
assessments should cont inue as scheduled every 6 weeks (±7 days) fo llowing the fi rst dose of 
study  therapy  until objective radi ographic evidence of PD.  Following treatment discont inuat ion, 
follow-up inform ation regarding further ant icancer treatment and survival status will be collected 
every 2months (± 7 days) for the first 2 y ears, then every  6 months (±14 day s)until the patient’s 
death or overall study  com pletion.  Foll ow-up will continue as lo ng as the patient is alive , 
withdraws consent from treatment , or un til study  com pletion as defined in Sect ion 8.1.3 .
8.1.2. Postdiscontinuation Follow -Up Period Assessments
Adverse event (AE) information will be co llected unt il at least 30 days after the decisio n is made 
to discont inue study  treatm ent.  After the 30 -day short -term follow-up visit, only  new and 
ongoing SAEs deemed related to study treatment will be co llected.
8.1.3. Study Completion and End of Trial
The primary  object ive is OS,and when there are at least 322OSevents among the stu dy 
popul ationthere will be a database lock to report the final study resul ts.

placebo will  be discont inued fro m study  treatm ent.  Lilly will notify invest igators w hen the 
continued access period begins .  
Patients who are in short -term follow-up when the continued access period begins will continue 
in short -term follow-up until the 30 -day short -term fo llow-up visit is co mpleted.  Long -term 
follow-up does not apply.
Patients who are in long -term follow-up when the continued access period begins will be 
discontinued fro m long-term follow-up.  
During the continued access period, a ll AEs, SAEs, and olaratumab exposure will be reported on 
the CRF.  Serio us adverse events will also be reported to Lilly Glo bal Pat ient Safet y (see Sect ion 
10.3.1 ).  In the event that an SAE occurs, Lilly may request addit ional informat ion (such as local 
laboratory  results, concomi tant m edicat ions, and hospitalizations) in order to evaluate the 
reported SAE. Blood sam ples f or PK and immunogenicit y analysis will be collected only inthe 
event of an infusio n-related reacti on.
Invest igators will perform any other standard procedures and tests needed to treat and evaluate 
patients; however, the choice and timing of the tests will be at the investigator’s discret ion.  Lilly
will not routinely collect the results of these assessments.
8.1.5. Committees
The following committees will be established to evaluate patients’ safety and/orefficac y of th e 
study  treatm ent.  There will be charters for these committees to fo llow.
Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( iDMC)
The independent Data Monitoring C ommittee (iDMC) will beestablished to conduct interim 
efficacy and safety analyses as specified in Sect ion 12.2.13 and will fo llow an approved iDMC 
charter .The iDMC will communicate back to Lilly  Seni or Management Desi gnee (SMD) about 
their assessment .
The i DMC will also review adverse events of special interest (AESI), including :
myocardial  failure, dy sfunct ion
myocardial  ischemia or infarct ion
arrhythmias
cardiovascular insuffic iency
The iDMC meet ings to revi ew interim data will occur approximately twice per y ear pri or to the 
final analysis of the stud y.  See Secti on 12.2.13 for addi tional details.
Independent Review Committee (IRC)
An Independent Review C ommit tee (IRC) m ay review the CT scans and MRI scans for tumor 
assessments from selected patients if necessary (for exam ple,based on inquiries fromregul atory
authori ties).   
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 35
LY30122078.1.6. Study Duration
Study  treatm ent will cont inue unt il documented PD, death, intolerable toxici ty, or other 
discontinuat ion criteria are m et.
From  first pati ent visi t to last pati ent visi t, the estimated study  durati on is 4 y ears.
8.2. Discussion of Design and Control
A rando mized, controlled design is being used in this study .  Rando mizat ion minimizes 
system atic bias in the select ion and assignment of patients to study  treatm ent and provides 
justificat ion for inferential statist ical methods to be used on data from this study .  Using an 
appropriate concurrent con trol arm enables di rect stati stical estimat ion of benefits and harms due 
to study  treatm ent and minimizes bias in the assessment and interpretation of observed treatment 
effects. Patients will be stratified for differences in factors thought to be associated with clinical 
outcom es to further reduce the potential for bias and improve the power of the analyses. 
Assessment of bias is further minimized by the use of a double blind and placebo control.
Invest igational treatment administration in this study  is doubl e-blind; that is, patients, 
investigat ional sites, and the sponsor study  team  do not have immediate access to treatment 
assignments for any  patients.  Thi s design feature minimizes potential bias due to knowledge of 
patient’s treatment duri ng evaluat ion of study  endpoints, at the patient level or aggregated across 
patients.

aPremedication is recommended prior to infusion of olaratumab or placebo. Recommended premedication agents 
include histamine H1 antagonists such as diphenhydramine hydrochloride (or equivalent). Additional 
premedication may be provided at the investigator’s discretion. Premedication must be provided in the setting of 
a prior Grade 1-2 infusion -related reaction, as detailed in Section 9.4.1.1.2.1 .  All premedicati on administered 
must be adequately documented in the eCRF .
bA 1-hour observation period is required after the administration of the first and second doses of 
olaratumab /placebo.  If there is no evidence of an infusion -related reaction during the initial 2 cycles of 
olaratumab /placebo, then no observation period is required for subsequent treatment cycles.  In the event an 
infusion -related reaction occurs thereafter, then the 1 -hour observation period should be reinstituted , see Section 
9.2.1.
cAdminister doxorubicin intravenously over 3 to 10 minutes. Decrease the rate of doxorubicin administration if 
erythematous streaking along the vein proximal to the site of infusion or facial fl ushing occur. Dexrazoxane may 
be administered at a 10:1 ratio (dexrazoxane:doxorubicin) at the investigator’s discretion, within 30 minutes prior 
to each doxorubicin infusion for prevention of cardiotoxicity .It is recommended that all patients receiving 5 or 
more cycles of doxorubicin receive dexrazoxane.
Any measurements used to determine dose should be taken at each cy cle, and dose shoul d be 
recal culated for each cy cle.  
The invest igator or his/ her designee is responsible for the fo llowing:

LY3012207explaining the correct use of the drugs and planned duration of each individual’s 
treatm ent to the patient/site personnel/legal representative,
verifying that instructions are fo llowed properly, 
maintaining a ccurate records of study  drug dispensing and collect ion, 
and returning all unused medicat ion to Lilly or its designee at the end of the study .
Note : In some cases, sites may destroy  the m aterial  if, during the invest igator site select ion, the 
evaluator h as verified and documented that the site has appropriate facilit ies and wri tten 
procedures to dispose clinical trial materials.
Patients will  be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if they  have a com plaint 
or probl em with the study  drugso that the situation can be assessed.
9.1.1. Premedication
Prem edicat ion is rec ommended prior to infusio n of olaratumab or placebo. Recommended 
prem edicat ion agents include histamine H1 antagonists such as diphenhydramine hydrochloride 
(or equivalent). Given the emetogenic potential of doxorubicin, premedicat ion with antiemetics 
per institutional guidelines is recommended.  Additional premedicati on may  be provi ded at 
investigator discret ion. 
Prem edicat ion must be provided in the setting of a prior Grade 1 or 2 IRRs , as detailed in Section 
9.4.1.1.2.1 .  All premedication administered must be adequately documented in the eCRF.
Ifdoxorubi cin premedicat ion is required prior to the doxorubicin infusio n, this must be done 
after the com pletion of olaratum abinfusion, not b efore the olaratumab infusio n. This 
prem edicat ion may be administered within the hour that follows complet ion of the olaratum ab
infusio n.
9.2. Materials and Supplies
Olaratum ab and pl acebo will be provi ded to the si tes by Lilly .  
Study  drug will be supplied as a sterile preservat ive-free sol ution for IV infusio n in single -use 
vials containing 500 mg/50 mL of olaratum ab(10mg/mL) or placebo . 
Olaratum ab/placebo is formulated in 10 mM histidine, 100 mM glycine, 5 0 mM sodi um

Clinical study  materials will be l abeled according to the cou ntry’s regul atory  requi rements.
9.2.1. Olaratumab /Placebo
Asept ic technique is to be used when pr eparing and handling olaratum ab/placebo . Patients are to 
receive 15mg/kg of olaratumab /placebo on Days 1 and 8 of each 21 -day treatm ent cy cle
admi nistered as an IV infusio n. On the days thatboth olaratum ab/placebo and doxorubicin (or 
doxorubi cin withdexrazoxane) are administered, olaratum ab/placebo will be administered prior 
to doxorubicin (or dexrazoxane withdoxorubi cin). The dose of olaratum ab/placebo is dependent 
upon the patient ’s baseline body  weight. Actual body  weight will be used for dose c alculation. 
Subsequent doses of olaratumab /placebo must be recalculated if there is a ≥10% change 
(increase or decrease) in body  weight from baseline; subsequent doses may  be recalculated if 
there is a < 10% change (increase or decrease) in body  weight fro m baseline and considered 
clinically relevant by  thetreating invest igator.
Olaratum ab/placebo is compat ible with co mmo nly used infusion containers. Refer to the IB o r 
pharmacy m anual  for detailed informat ion.
The dose of olaratum ab/placebo will be asept ically wi thdrawn from  the vial and transferred to a 
sterile infusio n bag or an evacuated glass container. Different drug product lots must not be 
mixed in a single infusio n. For doses other than 250 mL, a sufficient quant ity of sterile norm al 
saline (0.9% weight/vol ume) sol ution should be added (or removed in the case of a prefilled 
container such as AVIVA) to make the total vo lume 250 mL. The container should be gent ly 
inverted to ensure adequate mixing.
The dose shoul d be infused over approximately  60 m inutes. The infusio n rate shoul d not exceed
25mg/min.Infusio n durations longer than 60 minutes are permitted in specific circumstances 
(that is,for larger pati ents in order to m aintain an infusio n rate that does not exceed 25mg/min
or in the setting o f olaratum ab/placebo prior infusion -related reaction); the infusio ndurati on 
must al ways be accurately recorded.
The infusio n set m ust be flushed immediately  post infusio n of dose with sterile normal saline to 
ensure complete delivery  ofthecalculated dose.
Infusio n reactions may occur during or fo llowing olaratum ab/placebo administration (see
Secti on9.4.1 .1.1for definit ionsof Grade 3 and 4 infusio n reactions).
CAUTION: Infusion -related reacti ons may  occur during or following olaratum abadministration 
(see Section 9.4.1.1.1.1 for a definit ion of Grade 3 and 4 infusio n
-related reactions). During the 
administration of olaratum ab, pati ents shoul d be in an area with resuscitat ion equipment and 
treatm ents necessary for advanced life support and cardiopulmo nary resusci tation (CPR), such as 
bronchodilators, vasopressor agents (e.g., epinephrine), oxy gen, gl ucocorti coids, ant ihistamine s, 
IV fluids, and so forth. A 1-hour observat ion peri od is requi red after the administration of the 
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 39
LY3012207first and second doses of olaratumab /placebo. If there is no evidence o f an infusio n-related 
reacti on during the init ial 2 cycles of olaratum ab/placebo, t hen no observat ion peri od is requi red 
for subsequent treatment cy cles. In the event an infusio n related reacti on occurs thereafter, then 
the 1-hour observat ion should be reinst ituted.
9.2.2. Doxorubicin
Invest igators should consult the approved doxorubicin hydrochloride package insert for complete 
prescribing information (including warnings, precautions, contraindicat ions, adverse react ions, 
and dose modificat ions) and fo llow inst itutional procedures for the administration of 
doxorubi cin.  If a p atient should have an infusio n-related reacti on to doxorubicin , the 
investigator should fo llow the m anufacturer’s recommendat ions and clinical guidelines in the 
management of the patient.
Doxorubi cin 75 mg/m 2is administered IV . The dose of doxorubicin sh ould be reconst ituted i n 
100mL of normal saline.  Administer doxorubicin intravenously over 3 to 10 minutes.  Decrease 
the rate of doxorubicin administration if ery thematous streaking alo ng the vein proximal to the 
site of infusion or facial flushing occu r.
Doxorubi cin must be reconstituted prior to infusio n. The reconstituted solut ion is stable for 
7days at room  temperature and under normal room light and 15 day s under refri gerat ion (2ºC to 
8ºC). It should be protected from exposure to sunlight.
Parenteral  drug products should be inspected visually  for parti culate matter and disco loration 
prior to administration, whenever solut ion and container permit.
See Secti on 9.6.1.1 for dexrazoxane administration.  Doxorubicin should be given wit hin 
30minutes after completingthe infusio n with dexrazoxane.
9.3. Method of Assignment to Treatment
Upon com pletion of all screening evaluat ions to confirm a patient’s eligibilit y, the si te will  
register the pati ent by  the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS), which is web-based and 
accessible 24 hours a day .  The IWRS regi strati on consists of assignin
g the pati ent a uni que 
study  identification number for all patients will be rando mizedinto 1 of  the 2 treatm ent arms on 
a 1:1 basis.
The I WRS will assign patients to treatment arms according to a stratified method of 
rando mizat ion (that is, independent randomizat ion within each of 36 strata or cells), defined by  
the following 4 prognosti c factors:
Number of prior systemic therapies for advanc ed/metastati c disease (0 versus ≥1)
NOTE:  any  neoadj uvant and adj uvant therapy  administered for advanced/metastatic 
disease will  not be considered as a prior line of therapy
Histologi cal tumor type (leiomyosarcom a versus liposarcoma versus other STS ty pe)
ECOG performance status (0 versus 1)
Region 
(North America versus Europe versus ROW )
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 40
LY3012207Once the pat ient is registered through the IWRS, he/she is considered to be enro lled in the study .
9.4. Selection and Timing of Doses
A cycle is defined as an interval of 21 days (a del ay of a cycle due to holidays, weekends, bad 
weather , or other unforeseen circumstances will be permitted up to 3days and not cou nted as a 
protocol  deviat ion).
The actual  doses of olaratu mab administered will be determined by measuring the patient's 
weight in kil ograms at the beginning o f each cycle.  If the patient’s weight does not fluctuate by  
more than 10% f rom the wei ght used to cal culate the pri or dose, the dose will not need to be 
recal culated. A 5%variance in the calculated total dose will be allowed for ease of dose 
administration.
The actual  doses of doxorubicin administered will be determined by calculat ing the patient's 
body  surface area (BSA) at the beginning of each cycle.  If the patient’s weight does not 
fluctuate by  more than 10% f rom the weight used to calculate the prior d ose, the BSA will not 
need to be recalculated.  A 5% vari ance in the calculated total dose will be allowed for ease of 
dose administration.
Patients will  receive combinat ion treatment for 8 cycles, fo llowed by  monotherapy  olaratumab or 
placebo unt il evidence of progressive disease (PD), unacceptable toxicit y, death, or other 
withdrawal  criteria are m et.
9.4.1. Special Treatment Considerations
9.4.1.1. Dose Adjustment and Delays
Treatment may be delayed for up to 21 days to allo w a patient suffic ient time for recovery  from 
study  drug -related toxici ty.  If a pati ent does not recover from the toxicit y within 42 days fro m 
D1 of the previous cy cle, the pati entmust be di scont inued fro m study  therapy .
Any pat ient who requires a dose reduction wi ll continue to receive the reduced dose for the 
remainder of the study .  Any  patient who has had 2 dose reductions and who experiences a 
toxicity that woul d cause a thi rd dose reducti on must be disc ontinued fro m study  treatm ent.
Since all i nvesti gators areblinded to treatment arms, they will treat all  patients as if the pat ient
received study  drug versus placebo and will adjust doses accordingly .
In general, discont inuation o f 1 study  drug (ol aratumab /placebo or doxorubi cin) will not 
necessitate discontinuat ion of the other study  drug. In the event of alteration or discontinuat ion 
of olaratum ab/placebo therapy  due to an ol aratum ab/placebo -related toxi city, doxorubi cin need 
not be altered, and the planned doxo rubicin schedule should be maintained. In the event that 
olaratum ab/placebo treatm ent is discont inued for reason of toxicit y, the pati ent m ay cont inue 
treatm ent wi th doxorubi cinthrough Cy cle 8 at the discretion of the invest igator. Similarly, 
olaratum ab/placebo therapy  shoul d not be al tered or di scontinued for doxorubicin -related 
toxicity. Alteration or di scont inuat ion of doxorubicin will always necessitate a corresponding 
change to dexrazoxane , if administered, in order to maintain a dosage ratio of 10 :1
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 41
LY3012207(dexrazoxane:doxorubicin) . In the event that doxorubicin is discont inued for reason of toxi city, 
the pati ent m ay cont inue treatm ent wi th olaratum ab/placebo until one or more discontinuation 
criteria are met, at the discret ionof the investi gator.
9.4.1.1.1. Olaratumab/Placebo
9.4.1.1.1.1. Infusion -Related Reactions
As wi th other m onocl onal antibodies, hypersensit ivity react ions m ay occur during or following 
olaratum ab administration.
Patients treated with olaratumab /placebo shoul d be cl osely m onitored f or signs and symptom s 
indicat ive of an infusio n react ion by the medical staff fro m the start of the infusio n unt il at least 
1hour after the end of the infusio n in an area where emergency medical resuscitat ion equipment 
and ot her agents (epinephrine , predniso lone equivalents, etc .) are available.
Olaratum ab/placebo infusio n reactions will be defined according to either the NCI -CTCAE NCI -
CTCAE versio n 4.0 definit ion of infusio n-related reacti ons.  
Definitions of Infusion -Relate d Reactions for Protocols Utilizing NCI- CTCAE v ersion 4.0
The NCI -CTCAE version 4.0 definit ion of infusio n-related reactions (NCI -CTCAE v ersion 4.0

I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 43
LY3012207In general, if a pat ient experiences a Grade 1 or 2 infusio n-related reaction, the infusio n rate 
shoul d be decreased for the duration of the infusio n and all subsequent infusio ns, as di rected in 
the protocol. In addit ion, pati ents wi th Grade 1 and 2 infusio n reactions should be treated 
according to standard medical practices. After a Grade 1 or 2 infusio n reaction, patients should 
be premedicated with ant ihistamine s, steroi ds, acetaminophen, etc ., as appropriate for subsequent 
infusio ns.
A Gr ade 3 or 4 infusio n-related reaction will require immediate treatment, including the use of 
epinephrine, bronchodilators, and/or glucocortico ids for symptomat ic bronchospasm, IV fluids 
and/or pressors for hy potensi on, and immediate and permanent discont inuation of o laratumab 
with appropri ate supporti ve care.
Consistent with usual medical pract ice, selected parenteral medicat ions m ay be utilized for 
Grade 2 infusio n-related reaction as detailed below. The Lilly Study  Physician shoul d be 
contacted immediatel y if quest ions arise concerning the grade of the reaction.
The fo llowing are general treatment guidelines for olaratumab infusio n-related reactions. Please 
refer to each protocol for specific instruction.
Grade 1
Slow the infusio n rate by  50%
Moni tor the patient for worsening of condit ion
For subsequent infusions, premedicate with diphenhydramine hydrochloride 
50mg IV (or equivalent); addit ional premedicat ion may be administered at 
the invest igator’s discretion
Grade 2
Stop the infusio n
Administer diphenh ydramine hydrochloride 50 mg IV (or equivalent), 
acetaminophen 650 mg orally for fever, and oxy gen
Resume the infusio n at 50% of the prior rate once the infusio n reaction has 
resolved or decreased to Grade 1; the infusio n durati on shoul d not exceed 
2hours
Moni tor for worsening of condit ion
For subsequent infusions, premedicate the patient with diphenhydramine 
hydrochloride 50 mg IV (or equivalent); addit ional premedication may be 
administered at the invest igator’s discret ion
For a second occurrence of a Grade 1 or 2 infusio n-related reaction, administer de xamethasone 
8to 10 mg IV (or equivalent); then, for subsequent infusio ns, prem edicate wi th diphenhydramine 
hydrochloride 50 mg IV (or equivalent), acetamino phen 650 mg orally, and dexamethasone 8 to 
10 mg IV (or equivalent).
Grade 3
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 44
LY3012207Stop the infusio n and disconnect the infusio n tubing fro m the pati ent
Administer diphenhydramine hydrochloride 50 mg IV (or equivalent), 
dexamethasone 8 to 10mg IV (or equivalent), bronchodilators for 
bronchospasm, and other medications/treatment as medically indicated
Patients who have a Grade 3 infusio n reaction should not receive further 
olaratum ab treatm ent
Grade 4
Stop the infusio n and disconnect the infusio n tubing fro m the pati ent
Administ er diphenhy dramine hydrochl oride 50 m g IV (or equivalent), 
dexamethasone 8 to 10mg IV (or equivalent), and other 
medicat ions/treatment as medically indicated
Give epinephrine or bronchodilators as indicated
Hospital admissio n for observat ion may be indicated
Patients who have a Grade 4 infusio n reaction should not receive further 
olaratum ab treatm ent
If a patient should have an infusio n-related reacti on to olaratum ab, all attem pts shoul d be made 
to obtain an anti -olaratum abantibody  blood sam ple as cl ose to the onset of the event as po ssible, 
at the resolut ion of the event, and 30 day s following the event.   In addit ion, these same samples 
may be assessed for levels o f olaratum aband for pharmacodynamic markers to provide 
inform ation on the nature of the infusio n-related reacti on. The p rocedure for sample collect ion 
and handling is described in a separate procedural manual.
9.4.1.1.1.2. Hematologic Toxicity
For Grades 1 to 2 hematologic toxicit y, no dose modificat ionof olaratum ab/placebo is required. 
For ol aratum ab/placebo -related Grade 3 toxicity not adequately  controlled wi th appropri ate 
supportive care (including hematopoiet ic growth factors, if indicated), withho ld dose until 
toxicity ≤Grade 2 or has returned to pretreatment baseline; at this time, dose should be reduced 
to 12 m g/kg of olaratum ab/placebo and treatment resumed. In the case of Grade 4 hematologic 
toxicity associated wi th olaratum ab/placebo , withhol d the dose until toxicit y is ≤Grade 1, then 
reduce dose to 10 mg/kg and resume treatment.
9.4.1.1.1.3. Nonhematologic Toxicity
Spec ific guidelines for dose adjustments in pat ients who experience olaratumab infusio n
-related 
reacti ons may be found in Sect ion 9.4.1.1.1 .
General gu idelines for dose modificat ion for other nonhematologic toxicit ies related to 
olaratum ab are shown in Table JGDJ. 3.
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 45
LY3012207Table JGDJ. 3. General Guidelines for Dose Modification Due to Nonhematologic 
Toxicit ies Related to Olaratumab
Reaction Grade Required Dose Modification
Grade 1 No dose modification is required.
Grade 2 At the investigator’s discretion, the pat ient may  continue to receive olaratumab per protocol, 
provided that the event does not pose a serious health risk or is easily treated.  If necessary, 
the pat ient may  be dose reduced up to 2times (to 12 mg/kg and subsequently to 10 mg/kg) 
during the study .
Grade 3 For a Grade 3 toxicity not adequately controlled with appropriate supportive care, the dose 
must be withheld until toxicity is ≤ Grade 1 or has returned to pretreatment baseline; then 
treatment may resume at a reduced dose of 12 mg/kg.  If toxicity recurs after therapy 
resumes, a second dose reduction (to 10 mg/kg) is permitted. If more than two toxicity -
related olaratumab dose reductions are required, treatment with this agent will be 
permanently discontinued.
Grade 4 The dose must be withheld until dose toxicity is ≤ Grade 1 or has returned to baseline.  
Treatment may then resume with the dose reduced to 10 mg/kg.  If toxicity recurs after 
therapy  resumes, olaratumab treatment will be discontinued.
9.4.1.1.2. Doxorubicin
9.4.1.1.2.1. Hematologic Toxicity
Doxorubi cin w ill not be administered if the pat ient’s ANC is <1000 cells/ µLor if the platelet
count i s <100,000 cells/ µL. When necessary, the next treatment cy cle shoul d be delayed unt il
the ANC is ≥1000 cells/ µLand the pl atelet count is ≥100,000 cells/ µLand nonhematol ogic
toxicities have reso lved. For pati ents who experience ≥Grade 3 neutropeni c fever orinfect ionor 
Grade 4 neutropenia without fever lasting more than 1 week, doxorubicin should be reduced to 
75% of the starting dose ( that is,to approxi mately 60 mg/m2).  If a patient experiences a second 
incidence of neutropenic fever/infect ion or has another episode o f Grade 4 neutropenia lasting 
>1week, then a second dose reducti on to 45 mg/m2will be necessary . Therapeut ic and 
secondary  prophylact icuse of Neulasta®(pegfilgrastim) or other G -CSFs will be allowed per 
current ASCO guidelines or pati ents wi th Grade 4 ANC wi thout fever/infect ionlasting less than 
1week , retreatm ent will be allowed at the invest igator’s discretion wit h the full dose of 
doxorubi cin (75 m g/m2)with recommended use of G -CSFs per current ASCO guidelines (Smith 
et al, 2006 ).  See Table JGDJ. 4for doxorubicin dose modificat ion for neutropeni a.

prophylactic G -CSFs.
Second incidence of either:  
1) ≥Grade 3 neutropenic fever/infection
2) Grade 4 neutropenia lasting longer than 1 weekSecond dose reduction to 45 mg/m 2.
9.4.1.1.2.2. Cardiovascular
The di agnost ic method used at baseline for cardiovascular assessments (for example ECHO or 
MUGA scans) should be the same method used throughout the study , unless theassessment 
indicates the need for further intervention .
ECG changes, arrhyt hmias, tachycardia, and/or chest pain should be managed based on the 
specific findings. 
Patients will  undergo baselin e LVEF determinat ion by ECHO or MUGA scan. This evaluat ion 
may be repeated at any  time during the study if clinically indicated. If an ECHO/MUGA scan 
conducted on study  indicates a resting LVEF is <50%, then the ECHO or MUGA scan should be 
repeated.   A decrease in LVEF of 10% below the lower limit of normal or an abso lute decrease 
of 20%, or if the absolute LVEF decreases to or below 40%, then doxorubicin will be 
discontinued. Doxorubi cin shoul d also be discont inued if the patient develops Grade 3 or 4 left 
ventri cular systolic dysfunction (symptomat ic congestive heart failure). If doxorubicin is 
disconti nued for the above changes in LVEF, the pati ent may  cont inue on study  with olaratum ab, 
provi ded that the patient meets all other entry criteria.
If a patient does not recover from the toxicit y within 42 days from D1 of the previous cycle, 
doxorubi cinmust be discont inued .
9.4.1.1.2.3. Hepatic Impairment
Doxorubi cin is contraindicated in patients with severe hepat ic impairment (Child- Pugh Cl ass C
or serum bilirubin >5.0 mg/dL).
Decrease the dose of doxorubicin in pat ients with elevated serum  total  bilirubin concentrati ons as 
noted i n Table JGDJ. 5:

1.2 to 3 mg/dL 50%
3.1 to 5 mg/dL 75%
Greater than 5 mg/dL Do not initiate doxorubicin
Discontinue doxorubicin
9.5. Blinding
This is a double -blind study .
To preserve the blinding of the study , a minimum number of Lilly personnel  will see the 
rando mizat ion table and treatment assignments before the study  is complete.  Individuals (IWRS, 
clinical trials materials management, Global Pat ient Safet y, iDMC, and data management 
personnel) validating the database willnot have access to aggregate summary reports or 
statist ics.  PK data that could unblind the study  will not be reported to invest igative sites or other 
blinded personnel unt il the study has been unblinded.
Upon overall study  com pletion (see Section 8.1.1 ), invest igators may unblind patients to study 
treatm ent assi gnment.
Efficacy informat ion (as outlined in Sect ion 10.1) will not be shared withsites until  the study  is 
completed (see Section 8.1.3 ).  Treatm ent assi gnment will be scrambled in the reporting database 
until the database lock for data analysis.  This will ensure unblinded aggregate efficacy results 
are not available unt il the time o f final data analysis.
If an invest igator, site personnel performing assessments, or patient is unblinded, the patient may
be discont inued fro m study  treatm ent.  In cases where there are ethical reasons to have the 
patient rem ain on study  treatm ent, the invest igator must obtain specific approval fro m a Sponsor 
physician or designee for the patient to continue on study  treatm ent.
9.5.1. Emergency Unblinding
In case of an emergency , the invest igator has the sole responsibilit y for determini ng if unblinding 
of a pati ent’s treatm ent assignment is warranted.  Patient safet y must always be the first 
consideration in making such a determinat ion.  If the invest igator decides that unblinding is 
warranted, the invest igator should make every effo rt to con tact the Lilly CRP pri or to unblinding 
a pati ent’s treatm ent assignment unl ess this coul d del ay emergency treatment of the patient.  If a 
patient’s treatment assignment is unblinded, Lilly must be notified imm ediately.
All events resul ting in an unblinding event must be recorded and reported through the IWRS. If 
the invest igator or patient beco mes unblinded in the IWRS, that patient maybe discont inued 
from study  treatm ent.
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 48
LY30122079.5.2. Inadvertent Unblinding
Every  effort will be made to blind both the patient and the invest igator to the ident ity of the 
treatm ent, but the inadvertent unblinding of a patient may occur.  A double -blind study  design is 
known to be imperfect in the oncoly tic setti ng because the potential for in dividual  unblinding 
exists due to treatment -related si gns and symptom s.  If an invest igator, site personnel performing 
assessments, or patient is unblinded, the unblinding will not be sufficient cause (in and of itself) 
for that pati ent to be di scont inued from study  treatment or excl uded from  any safet y or efficacy  
analyses.
Addit ionally , there m ay be ethical reasons to have the patient remain on the study  treatm ent.  F or 
patients to con tinue on study  treatm ent in the event of unblinding, the invest igator m ust obtain 
specific approval fro m a Lilly CRP for the patient to continue in the study .
9.6. Concomitant Therapy
All conco mitant m edicat ions should be recorded throughout the patient’s participat ion in the 
study .
Concomitant medications and su pportive care therapies must also be docum ented at the time o f 
discontinuat ion and at the 30 -day short -term follow-up visit.
With the exceptions listed in the sect ions below, no other chemotherapy, experimental 
medicat ions, other anticance r therapy , immunotherapy , horm onal cancer therapy , radi ation, 
surgery  for cancer, or experimental medications will be permitted while pat ients are on study  
treatm ent.  
Appropriate documentation for all forms of premedicat ions, supportive care, and concomitant 
medicat ions (eg, m edicat ions such as sedat ives, antibiotics, analgesics, antihistamines, 
corticosteroi ds, erythropoi etin;procedures such as paracentesis, thoracent esis; or bl ood products 
such as blood cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma transfusio ns)must be captured on the eCRF .
If doxorubi cinpremedicat ion is required prior to the doxorubicin infusio n, this must be done 
after the com pletion of olaratumab infusio n, not before the ol aratum ab infusi on.
9.6.1. Supportive Care
Patients shoul d receive full supportive care, if necessary .  Pati ents will  receive supportive care as 
judged by  their treating physician.  If it is unclear whether a therapy  shoul d be regarded as 
suppo rtive care, the invest igator should consult the Lilly CRP .  Use of any  supportive care 
therapy  shoul d be reported on the eCRFs .
9.6.1.1. Dexrazoxane
Dexrazoxane use to reduce the risk of doxorubicin -induced cardiotoxicit yis recommended for
patients receiving 5 or more cy cles of doxorubicin ,at the discret ion of the investigator.  
Invest igators should consult the dexrazoxane package insert for administration informat ion
(including warnings, precautions, contraindicat ions, adverse react ions, and dose modifications).
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 49
LY3012207Note that as the dose of dexrazoxane administered is proportionally dependent on the dose of 
doxorubi cin administered, any  dose m odificat ions to doxorubicin will require a corresponding 
dose m odificat ion to dexrazoxane in order to maint ain a dosage ratio of 10:1
(dexrazoxane:doxorubicin) .
9.6.1.2. Granulocyte -colony St imulating Factors andErythroid Growth Factors
Following the first dose of doxorubicin treatment, t he use of G -CSFs such as Neulasta®
(pegfilgrastim) and erythroid stimulat ing factors (eg, ery thropoietin) arepermitted , including 
prophylact ic use, during investigational therapy  at the discret ion of the invest igator , according to 
American Soci ety of Clinical  Oncol ogy (ASCO) guidelines ( Smith et al. 2006).  
9.6.1.3. Transfusion of Blood Products
Transfusio ns of red blood cells, platelets, or other blood products are permitted at the 
investigator’s discret ion, but m ay not be used to meet hematologic criteria for inclusion in the 
study (refer to Sect ion 7.1, inclusio n #10 )
.
9.6.1.4. Anti-emetic Therapy
Both prophylactic and symptom -directed ant i-emetic therapy  are recommended and shoul d be 
used in accordance wit h institutional guidelines (when existent) and/or at investigator’s 
discreti on.
9.6.2. Prohibited Therapies
Addit ional concurrent chemotherapy , radiati on therapy , biologic response m odifie rs, or other 
investigat ional ant icancer agents may not be administered to pat ients on this study .  Palliat ive 
radiation to symptomat ic sites of disease will not be permitted while on study.
9.6.2.1. Effect of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and P -gpInhibitors and Inducers on 
Doxorubicin
Doxorubi cin is a major substrate of cy tochrom e P450 CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, and P -
glycoprotein (P -gp).  Clinically significant interactio nshave been reported with inhibitors of 
CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and/or P -gp (for example, verapamil), result ing in increased concentration 
and clinical effect of doxorubicin. Inducers of CYP3A4 (for example, phenobarbital, phenyto in, 
St. John’s Wort) and P -gp inducers may decrease the concentration of doxorubi cin.  Avoi d 
concurrent use of doxorubicin with inhibitors an d inducers o f CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or P -gp.  
Refer to Attachment 8 for a list.
9.7. Treatment Compliance
The study  medicat ion will be administered only at th e invest igational sites by  the authorized 
study  personnel.  As a result, treatment compliance is ensured.

LY301220710.Efficacy , Patient Reported Outcomes , Safety  Evaluations, 
Sample Collection and Testing, and Appropriateness of 
Measurements
Written inform ed consent m ust be obtained pri or to any  study -specific pretreatment evaluations. 
Study  procedures related to efficacy, safet y, pain, healt h-related qualit y of life measures, sample 
collect ion and testing assessments and the ir timing are described in the sect ions below and 
shown in the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).
10.1. Efficacy Measures
10.1.1. Radiographic Assessments at Baselin e and during Study 
Treatment
Within 28 days before the first dose of study  treatment s, baseline tumor measurements will be 
perform ed on each pati ent.  Com puted tom ography (CT), including spiral CT, scans and 
magnet ic resonance imaging (MRI ) are the pre ferred m ethods of m easurement.
The CT portion of a PET -CT scan may be used as a method of response assessment if the site 
can docum ent that the CT i s of ident ical diagnostic qualit y to a di agnosti c CT (wi th intravenous 
and ora l contrast). A PET scan alo ne or as part of a PET -CT m ay be perform ed for addi tional 
analyses but cannot be used to assess response according to RECIST .
The m ethod of assessment used at baseline must be used consistent ly for tum or assessment and 
will be repeated every 6 weeks (± 7days), as calculated from the first dose of study  therapy . 
Patients will  be evaluated for response according to RECIST, v 1.1 guidelines (Eisenhauer et al. 
2009) , as outlined in Attachment 6 .
After the primary  analysis of OS and unt il study  complet ion, Lillywill cont inue to collect 
survival data on all pat ients but m ay reduce data collect ion for other efficacy data.  The 
frequency  and types of  efficacy assessments (other than collect ion of OS data) will be at the 
discreti on of  the invest igator, based on the standard of care.  Lilly will notify  invest
igators when 
this reduced data collection begins and ends.
During the continued access period , efficacy assessments (frequency and ty pe of assessments) 
will be at the discretion of the invest igator, based on the standard of care , and these data will not 
be co llected or analyzed.
10.1.2. Radiographic Assessments during the Study Period 
Postdiscontinuation Follow -Up
Postdiscontinuati on follow-up during the study  period will be conducted as described in the 
Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ). 
For those patients who discont inue study  treatm ent wi thout obj ectively measured p rogressive 
disease (PD), the invest igative sites will cont inue to monitor patients and perio dically  eval uate 
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 51
LY3012207tumor response every  6 weeks (±7days)by the same method used at baseline and throughout the 
study  until  the pat ient has object ive disease progres sion, or until  the final analysis of overall 
survival.  After the patient has object ive disease progression, radio logic tests are no l onger 
requi red and the patient will be fo llowed up approximately  every  2months (±7days) for the first 
2 years, then every 6 months (±14days)until the patient’s death or overall study  com pletion.
After final analysis of OS, during the Continued Access Period, efficacy assessments (frequency 
and t ype of assessments) will be at the discretion of the invest igator, based on the standard of 
care.
Lilly will cont inue to collect survival data through study  com pletionbut m ay reduce data 
collect ion for other efficacy  data.  Lilly will notify investigators when this reduced data 
collect ion begins and ends. . 
10.1.3. Primary Efficacy Measure
Overall survival durat ion is measured from the date of rando mizat ion to the date of death due to
any cause.  For each patient, prior to each data analysis, a reasonable effort will be made to 
obtain the most up to date status of the patient (date of death or last date known to be alive). For 
each patient who is not known to have died as o f the data -inclusio n cutoff date for a particular 
analysis, OS will be censored for that analysis at the date the pat ient was l ast known to be alive .  
For any  patient who has withdrawn consent for further fo llow-up of  survival data, OS will be 
censored at the last date for which the patient consented to be fo llowed f or the study .  
10.1.4. Additional Efficacy Measures
The fo llowing additional efficacy measures will be determined for each pat ient, with planned 
statist ical analyses specified in Section 12and in the Statist ical Analysis Plan (a separate 
docum ent).Specific definit ions of each of these measures (such as defining events and 
censoring for each time to event endpoint) will be provid edin the Statist ical Analysis Plan.  
Progression -free survi val(PFS)
Object ive Response Rate (ORR)
Disease Control  Rate (DCR)
Durati on of  Response (DoR)
Durati on of  Disease Control
Time to any  progressi on (censoring for death without progression)
Time to any  new metastases (censoring for death and for other ty pe of PD)
New -metastases -free survival (nMFS)
Time to any  progressi on based solely  on increased sum  of target l esions
Time to first worsening of the mBPI -sf “worst pain” score
Time to first worsening of the QLQ -C30 summary scores (for example, Global Heal th 
Status / Qualit y of Life score ,Physical Funct ioning score , and Role Functi oning score )
Time to first worsening of ECOG performance status 
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 52
LY301220710.2. Patient Reported Outcomes /Resource Utilization
Patient reported pain will be assessed using the mBPI -sf (Cleeland et al.1991). Health related 
Qualit y of Life will be assessed with the EORTC QLQ -C30 (Aaronson et al. 1993).  Health 
status will be assessed using t he EQ-
5D-5L (Janssen et al. 2008) .  The PRO measures will be 
collected on Day  1 of every  cycle and at the 30-day short term follow-up visit.  A full due 
diligence will be taken to collect PRO measures during long -term follow-up (every  6 weeks 
[±7days] unt il PD, thereafter every 2 months [±7 days] for the first 2 y ears, then every  6 months 
[±14 day s] unt il the patient’s death or overall study co mpletion).
Paper versions of the quest ionnaires will be used. It is recommended that the instruments be 
administered together and in sequence order, at the beginning o f the visit prior to other study  
procedures, wi th the m BPI-sf presented fi rst, followed by  the EORTC QLQ -C30 and continuing 
with the EQ -5D- 5L. Questionnai res shoul d be administered to the patient prior to extensive 
interact ion with site staff and study  drug administration.
Patient-reported questionnai res shoul d be com pleted by  patients when a language translat ion is 
available in which the pat ient is fluent or literate.
10.2.1. mBPI -sf
The mBPI -sf (Cleeland et al.1991) i s an 11 -item instrum ent used as a mult iple-item measure of 
cancer pain intensit y.  In addit ion to pain intensit y (4 items), the mBPI-sf is designed for patients 
to record the presence of pain in general, pain relief, and pain interference with funct ion (general 
activit y, mood, abili ty to wal k, abilit y to perform norm al work, rel ations with others, sleep, and 
enjoyment of life).
Responses for the mBPI -sfitems are captured through the use of 11 -point numeric rating scales 
anchored at 0 ( no pain ordoes not interfere ) and ranged through 10 ( pain as bad as you can 
imagine orcompletely int erferes ).  The focus of the analysis will be on the “worst pain”. “Worst 
pain” intensit y has been shown to meaningfully impact patients’ lives as indicated by  a strong 
correl ation with functional interference scores in various ty pes of cancer (Daut et al. 1983; Serlin 
et al. 1995 ; Ger et al. 1999; McMillan et al. 2000; Shi et al. 2009). Moreover, a study  by Stone 
et al. (2004) suggested that patients’ tendency  to focus on the most severe level of pain during a 
recall period may  bias average recalled pain. Therefore, t he focus of the analysis will be on the 
“worst pain”.  
Analgesic use will be recorded on the eCRF .  Data on each individual prescript ion and over -the-
counter analgesic medicat ion will be recorded on the Conco mitant Medi cations eCRF including 
but not limited to drug name and mode of administ ration.  The use of analgesics shoul d be 
reviewed wit h the patient during each visit.  Any  changes to anal gesic use (new or stopped 
analgesics) will be recorded on the eCRF.   Analgesics will be classified in to 1 of  6 categori es, 
using an analgesic ladder approach with medicat ion category  based on a World Healt h 
Organizat ion scale outlined in table below.  A therapy category will be assigned according to the 
maximum category  of therapy  routinely  administered based on analgesic data for that cy cle.  
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 53
LY3012207The mBPI-sfpopul ation will include all pat ients who com pleted at l east 1 baseline (Cycle 1 Day  
1) followed by at least 1 mBPI-sf“worst pain” assessment after 1 cy cle of  study  drug (Cycle 2 
Day 1 or later). Patients with a mBPI -sf “worst -pain baseline score of 8 or more will not be 
included in the analysis.
Table JGDJ. 6. World Health Organization Pain Scale

5 Neurosurgical procedures (blocks)
10.2.2. EORTC QLQ -C30
Broadly used in cancer trials, validated, and available in over 80 different languages, the EORTC 
QLQ -C30 (Aaronson et al. 1993) is a reliable and validated tool.  The EORTC QLQ -C30 v3.0 is 
a self -administered, cancer -specific quest ionnaire wi th multidimen sional scales. The EORTC 
QLQ -C30 self -reported general cancer instrument consists of 30 items covered by  1 of 
3dimensio ns:
global heal th status/qualit y of life (2 items)
funct ional scales (15 total items addressing eit her physical, role, emotional, cogni tive, or 
social functioning)
symptom  scales (13 total items addressing either fatigue, nausea/vomit ing, pain, dyspnea, 
insomnia, appetite loss, constipat ion, diarrhea, or financial impact)
The EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaire is administered per the Study  Sched ule (Attachm ent 1 ).  
The recall period is the past week, complet ion time is ty pically 5 to 7 minutes, and the 
questionnaire will be scored as described by the EORTC scoring manual (Fayers et al. 2001).   
The EO RTC popul ation will  include all  patients who com pleted at l east 1 baseline (Cycle 1 
Day 1) followed by at l east 1 EORTC assessment after 1 dose of study  drug (Cy cle 2 Day  1 or 
later).
10.2.3. EQ-5D-5L
The EQ -5D- 5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of self-reported heal th status
(Herdman et al. 2011).  Specifically , this quest ionnaire is included in this trial to evaluate healt h-
state utilit ies associated with advanced STS.  These utilit y measures are an important input for 
economic evaluat ions conce rning the value o f treatment intervent ions.
The EQ -5D 5L is designed to be used in conjunct ion with other patient -reported measures.  
Patients will  com plete the 5 -dimensio n (mobility, self -care, usual act ivities, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiet y/depressi on), 5-level (no problem, slight, moderate, severe, or extreme problem) 
assessment according to the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).  A unique EQ -5D healt h state is 
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 54
LY3012207defined by co mbining 1 level fro m each of the 5 dimensions. Addit ionally, patients will indicate 
their current health status by  marking on a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 100 (best 
imaginable healt h state) to 0 (worst imaginable healt hstate).
The recall period is “today .”  The EQ -5D- 5L is designed for self -completion by respondents and 
is cognit ively  simple, taking only  a few minutes to complete.
10.2.4. Resource Utilization
Invest igators will be asked to document the use of best supportive ca re (BSC) measures, 
concomitant medicat ions, transfusio ns, and treatment -related hospitalizat ion days.  Such 
assessments are to be taken throughout the study  through the 30 -dayshort -term post-
discontinuat ion follow-up visit.
10.3. Safety Evaluations
Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the safety of pat ients who have entered this study  
and for al erting Lilly or its designee to any  event that seems unusual, even if this event may be 
considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient.
The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of pat ients during the study.
The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate healt h care option , 
AEs that are serious, considered related to the study, or that caused the pa tient to di scont inue 
before complet ing the study.  The patient should be fo llowed unt il the event is resolved or 
explained.  Frequency  of follow-up evaluati on is left to the di screti on of  the invest igator.
The timing of all safet y evaluat ions is shown in t he Study  Schedule ( Attachm ent 1 ).  Table 
JGDJ .7presents a summary of AE and SAE reporting guidelines.  Table JGDJ .7also shows 
which database or sy stem  is used to store AE and SAE data.

10.3.1. Adverse Events
Lilly has standards for reporting AEs that are to be fo llowed regardl ess of applicable regulatory  
requi rements that m ay be less stringent.  A clinical study  AE is any untoward medical event 
associ ated wi th the use of a drug in humans, whether or not it is consi dered rel ated to that drug .
Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical trials, because the purpose of the clinical trial is to 
establish drug effect.
Any clinically  significant findings from ECGs , ECHOs/MUGAs , labs, or vital sign 
measurements that result in a diagnosis should be reported to Lilly or its desi gnee.
Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposures to study  drug shoul d be 
reported.  Data on fetal outcome and breast -feeding are collected for regulatory reporting and 
drug saf ety evaluat ion.
Study  site personnel  will record the occurrence and nature of each patient’s preexist ing 
condi tions, including clinically  significant si gns and symptom s of the disease under treatment in 
the study .
After the ICF is signed, site personnel wi ll record the occurrence and nature of any AEs and any 
change in the preexist ing condit ion(s).  All AEs related to protocol procedures are reported to 
Lilly or its desi gnee.
In addit ion, all AEs occurring after the patient receives the first dose of study  treatm entmust be 
reported to Lilly or its designee via eCRF.  
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 56
LY3012207Invest igators will be instructed to report to Lilly or its designee their assessment of the potential 
relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure orstudy drugs via eCRF .
Patients will  be eva luated for AEs at each visit and will be instructed to call their physician to 
report any  AEs between visit s.
The National Cancer Inst itute (NCI )-CTCAE v 4.0 will serve as the reference document for 
choosing appropriate termino logy for, and grading the sev erity of, all AEs and other symptom s.  
For AEs wi thout m atching termino logy within the NCI -CTCAE v 4.0 criteria , the invest igator 
will be responsible for select ing the appropriate system organ class and assessing severit y grade 
based on the intensit y of the event. 
In addit ion to collect ing the AE verbat im and the CTCAE severit y grade, AE verbat im text will 
also be m apped by Lilly or its designee to corresponding termino logy within the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) dictionary.
If a p atient’s dosage is reduced or treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study  site 
personnel must clearly  report to Lilly or its desi gnee via eCRF the circumstances and data 
leading to any  such dosage reduction or discont inuation of treatment.
10.3.1.1. Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any  adverse event from  this study  that results in one of the fo llowing outcom es:
death
a life- threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)
persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y
initial or prol onged inpatient hospitalizat ion
congenital ano maly/birth defect
considered significant by  the invest igator for any other reason
Important m edical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi talizati on may  be considered seri ousadverse drug events when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they  may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervent ion to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definit ion.
Serious adverse event collect ion begins after the patient has signed informed consent and has 
received study  treatm ents.  If a pati ent experi ences an SAE after si gning informed consent, but 
prior to receiving study  treatm ents, the event will not be reported as serious unless the 
investigator feels the ev ent m ay have been caused by  a protocol  procedure.
Data on SAEs that occur before the end of trial will be stored in the collect ion database and the 
Lilly Safety  System .
Study  site personnel  must al ert Lilly or its desi gnee of  any serious adverse event (SAE) within 
24 hours of invest igator awareness of the event via a sponsor -approved method.  If study  site 
personnel contact Lilly or its designee by  telephone regarding an SAE, study  site personnel  must 
also immediately provide official not ificat ion on study -specific SAE forms.
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 57
LY3012207This 24 -hour notificat ion requirement refers to the init ial SAE informat ion and all fo llow-up 
SAE informat ion.
Planned surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has 
worsened duri ng the course of the study .
Planned hospi talizat ions or procedures for preexisting condit ions that are already recorded in the 
patient’s medical history  at the time of study  enro llment should not be considered SAEs.  
Hospitalization or prolongat ion of hosp italizat ion without a preci pitating clinical AE (for 
example, for the administration of study  treatm ent or other protocol -requi red procedure) shoul d 
not be considered SAEs.
Serious adverse events due to disease progressi on, including death, shoul d not be r eported unless 
the invest igator deems them to be possibly related to the study  treatm ents.
The invest igator does not need to actively mo nitor pati ents f or AEs once the trial has ended, 
unless provided otherwise in the protocol ; however, i f an invest igator becomes aware of an SAE 
occurring after the patient’s participat ion in the trial has ended, and the investigator believes that 
the SAE is related to a protocol procedure or study treatment s, the invest igator should report the 
SAE to the s ponsor, and the SAE will be entered in the Lilly Safety  System .
Inform ation on SAEs expected in the study  popul ation independent of drug exposure and that 
will be assessed by  the sponsor in aggregate periodically during the course of the trial may  be 
foundin the IB.
10.3.1.2. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions
Suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed 
in the Development Core Safet y Informati on (DCSI) in the IB and that the invest igator identifi es 
as rel ated to the study  treatm entsor study procedure.  United States 21 CFR 312.32 and 
European Unio n Clinical Trial Direct ive 2001/20/EC and the associated detailed guidances or 
national regulatory  requi rements in parti cipat ing countries require the reporting o f SUSARs.  
Lilly has procedures that will be fo llowed for the recording and expedited reporting of SUSARs 
that are consistent with glo bal regulat ions and associated detai led guidances.
10.3.2. Other Safety Measures
10.3.2.1. Electrocardiograms
For each patient, 12 -lead digital electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be collected according to the 
Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ) as single ECGs for overread.  Patients must be supine for 
approximately  5 to 10 minutes before ECG collect ion and remain supine but awake during ECG 
collect ion.
Electrocardiograms may be obtained at addit ional time s, when deemed clinically necessary .  
Collect ion of more ECGs than expected at a particular time point is allowed when needed to 
ensure high qualit y records.
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 58
LY3012207Electrocardiograms will be interpreted by  a qualified physician (the investigator or qualified 
designee) at the site as soon after the time of ECG collect ion as possible, and ideally while the 
patient is st ill present, to determine whether the patient meets entry criteria and for immediate 
patient management, should any  clinically relevant findings be identified.
After enro llment, if a clinically significant increase in the QT/corrected QT (QTc) interval fro m 
baseline, or other clinically significant quantitative or qualitative change from baseline, is 
present, the invest igator will assess the patient f or symptoms (for example, palpitat ions, near 
syncope, syncope) and to determine if the pat ient can cont inue in the study .  The invest igator or 
qualified designee is responsible for determining if any change in pat ient management i s needed 
and must document his/her review of the ECG printed at the time of evaluation.
All digital ECGs will be electronically  transmi tted to a desi gnated central ECG laboratory .  A 
cardi ologist at the central  ECG l aboratory  will then conduct a full overread on the ECG 
(including all intervals); a report based on data from this analysis will be issued to the 
investigat ive site.  All data from the overreads will be placed in the Lilly database for analyt ical 
and study  report purposes.
When there are differences in ECG interpretation between the invest igator (or qualified 
designee) and the cardio logist at the central  ECG laboratory , the investigator (or qualified 
designee’s) interpretation will be used for study  entry  and immediate patient management.  
Interpretations from the cardio logist at the central  ECG laboratory  will be used for data analysis 
and report writ ing purposes.
The invest igator (or qualified designee) must document his/her review of the ECG printed at the 
time of evaluat ion, the final overread ECG report issued by the central  ECG l aboratory , and any  
alert reports.
10.3.2.2. Echocardiograms /MUGA Scans
Anechocardi ogram  ormulti-gated acquisi tion (MUGA) scan is required wit hin 28 days prior to 
rando mizat ionfor all patients .  Thereafter, echocardiograms or MUGA scans must be performed 
prior to treatm ent wi thin 7 days prior to Day 1 of Cycles 5 and 7, at the end of Cycle 8, and when 
clinically indicated.  After Cy cle 9, perform echocardiograms or MUGA scans every 3 cycles 
until PD or treatment discont inuat ion, whichever come s first(refer to Attachment 1).
10.3.3. Safety Monitoring
The Lilly CRP will mo nitor safet y data throughout the course of the study .
Lilly will rev iew SAEs wit hin time frames mandated by co mpany procedures.  The Lilly CRP
will, as is appropriate, consult with the funct ionally  independent Gl obal Pat ient Safet y 
therapeuti c area physician or clinical scient ist, and review:
trends in safety  data
laboratory  analy tes
adverse events including mo nitoring of cardiac events such as:
omyocardial  failure, dy sfunct ion
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 59
LY3012207omyocardial  ischemia or infarct ion
oarrhythmias
ocardiovascular insuffic iency
If a patient experiences elevated alanine amin otransf erase ( ALT ) >5× upper limit of 
norm al (ULN) and elevated total bilirubin >2
×ULN, clinical and laboratory  monitoring 
shoul d be initiated by  the invest igator. For patients entering the study wit h ALT >3 ×
ULN, m onitoring shoul d be tri ggered at ALT >2 ×baseline.
Details for hepat ic monitoring depend upon the severit y and persistence of observed 
laboratory  test abnorm alities.To ensure patient safet y and co mply with regulatory  
guidance, the investigator is to consult with the Lilly CRP regarding collect ion of specific 
recommended clinical information and fo llow-up laboratory  tests. See Attachment 3.
In the event that safet y monitoring uncovers an issue that needs to be addressed by unblinding at 
the group l evel, only  members of the data monitoring commit tee (an advisory  group for thi s 
study  formed to protect the integrit y of data; refer to Secti on12.2.13 ) can conduct addit ional 
analyses o f the safet y data.
For the purpose of this study , in which survival is a primary  endpoint, all deaths and SAE reports 
will be reviewed in a blinded manner by  Lilly during the clinical trial.  These reports will be 
reviewed to assure completeness and accuracy  but will  not be unblinded to Lilly during the 
clinical trial.  If a death or other clinical AE is deemed s erious, unexpected, and possibly related 
to study  treatm ents, only Lilly Global Patient Safety  representatives external to the study  team  
will be unblinded for regulatory  reporti ng and safety  monitoring purposes.  These measures will 
preserve the integrit yof the data collected during this trial and minimize any potential for bias 
while providing for appropriate safet y monitoring.
10.3.3.1. Cardiac Events of Special Interest
Patients exposed to doxorubicin are at risk for cardio vascular events.  These events will be 
monitored through out the JGDJ study  as cardi ac adverse events of special interest (AESI):
left ventri cular dysfunct ionasident ified byechocardi ogram  or MUGA scan
myocardial  failure, dy sfunct ion
myocardial  ischemia or infarct ion
arrhythmias
cardiovascular insuffic iency
AESI data will be collected for all study  treatm ent arm s and m onitored throughout the conduct of 
this study  and across the development program.  If cardiovascular events are repor ted, sites will 
be prompted to collect addit ional information.
10.3.4. Complaint Handling
Lilly collects product complaints on study  treatm ents used in clinical trials in order to ensure the 
safet y of study  participants, m onitor quali ty, and to facilitate process and product improvements.
Com plaint s related to unblinded doxorubi cin and/or dexrazoxane are reported directly to the 
manufacturers of those drugs in accordance wit h the package insert.
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 60
LY3012207For blinded studies, all product complaints associated with material packaged, labeled, and 
released by Lilly or its designee will be reported.
The invest igator or his/her designee is responsible for handling the fo llowing aspects of the 
product complaint process in accordance wit h the instructions provided for this study :
recording a complete descript ion of the product complaint reported and any associated 
AEs using the study -specific co mplaint form s provided for this purpose
faxing the completed product c omplaint form  within 24 hours to Lilly or its desi gnee
If the invest igator is asked to return the product for invest igation, he/she will return a copy  of the 
product complaint form with the product.
10.4. Sample Collection and Testing
Attachm ent 1 and Attachm ent 7 list the schedule for sample collections in this study.
Attachm ent 2 lists the specific tests that will be performed for this study and whether these will 
be perform ed at a central  or local laboratory .  In the ev ent of a treatm ent-emergent hepatic 
abnorm ality, selected tests may be obtained as specified inAttachm ent 3 .
10.4.1. Samples for Study Qualification and Health Monitoring
Bloodand u rinesamples will be collected to determine whether patients meet 
inclusio n/excl usion criteria and to monitor pati ent heal th.  Enrollment and treatment decisio ns 
may be based upon results of tests performed locally. If local laboratory  tests are used for this 
purpose, then a duplicate specimen must be submit ted to the central laboratory . Discrepancies
between l ocal and central  laboratory  that m ay have an impact on eligibilit y or treatm ent 
decisio ns will not be considered protocol deviat ions.
Invest igators must document their review of each laboratory  safety  report.
Laboratory /analy te resul ts that coul dunblind the study  will not be reported to invest igative sites 
or other blinded personnel until the study  has been unblinded.
Samples co llected for specified laboratory tests will be destroyed wit hin 60 days of receipt of 
confirmed test results.  Tests are run and confirmed prompt ly whenever scient ifically 
appropriate.  When scientific circumstances warrant, however, it is acceptable to retain samples 
to batch the tests run, or to retain the samples until the end of the study  to confirm  that the resul ts 
arevalid.  Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to comply wit h 
applicable laws, regulat ions, or l aboratory  certificati on standards.
10.4.2. Samples for Translational Research
The fo llowing samples for bio marker and pharmacogenetics research arerequi red to be collected 
from all patients in this study :
 plasma samples fro m whole blood (see Section 10.4.2.1 )
 whole blood sam ple for DNA collect ion (seeSection 10.4.2.2 )
 archived t umor tissue or tum or tissue from  biopsy (see Secti on 10.4.2. 3)
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 61
LY3012207Samples will  be stored and analyses will be performed to assess biomarkers relevant for STS, the 
mechanism o f action of  olaratum abordoxorubicin and/or cancer -related condit ions, and may 
also be used for related research methods.   Samples will be stored un til analyzed, as described 
below.
Plasma sam ples f or biomarker research, whol e blo od sam ples f or DNA, and tum or tissue 
samples will be co llected at the times specified in the Study Schedule (Attachment 1 and
Attachm ent 7 ).Translat ional research samples will be stored at a facilit y chosen by the Sponsor 
or desi gnee.
Supplies requi red for the collect ion and shipment of the pat ients’ stored samples will be supplied 
by the central laboratory  vendor.  Sam ple handling and shipment to the central laboratory  will 
occur per instructions provided to the study  site.
10.4.2.1. Blood Sample sfor Pl asma Collection
Blood sam ples will be collected at specified time points (Attachment 7 ) for plasma collect ion.  
Potenti al pharmacodynamic and/or circulat ing markers may include, but are not limited to, 
PDGF , VEGF, PDGFRα, and PDGFRα ligand(s) .  The samples will be coded with th e pati ent 
number and stored for up to a maximum 15 years after the last patient visit for the study  at a 
facilit y selected by  the sponsor.  
10.4.2.2. Whole Blood Sample sfor DNA Collection
There i s growing evidence that genetic variat ion may impact a pati ent’s response to therapy .  
Variable response to therapy  may be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, 
distribut ion, metabo lism, and excretion, the mechanism of act ion of the drug, the disease 
etiology and/or the m olecular subt ype of the disease be ing treated.  Therefore, where local 
regul ations and ERBs allo w, a blood sample will be collected for pharm acogenet ic analysis.  
Sampling for such analysis will be a one -time co llection, as noted in the Study Schedule 
(Attachm ent 1 ).  Variable response to olaratum aband doxorubi cinmay be due to genetic 
determinants that impact drug absorption, distributio n, metabo lism and excretion, the mechanism 
of action of  the drug, the availabilit y of receptors, the disease et io
logy and/or the di sease subt ype 
itself.
Samples will  be stored and analys es may be performed on genet ic variants/copy  number 
variat ions that are thought to play a role in soft tissue sarcoma, the mechanism o f action of  
olaratum ab or doxorubicin , and/or cancer -related condi tions.
In the event of an unexpected AE or the ob servat ion of an unusual response, the samples may be 
genoty ped and analysis may be performed to evaluate genetic associat ion with response to 
olaratum aband/or doxorubicin .  These invest igations may include focused candidate gene 
studi es or, if appropriate , genom e-wide association studies may  be perf ormed to i dentify regio ns 
of the geno me associated with the variabilit y observed in drug response.  Samples will only  be 
used for invest igations rel ated to di sease, cancer -related conditions, and drug under stud y in the 
context of this clinical program.
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 62
LY3012207They  will not be used for broad exploratory  unspecified disease or populat ion genet ic analysis.  
Pharmacogenet ic data will not be provided back to the investigator or the patient except where 
requi red by l ocal law.
The samples will be coded with the patient number and stored for up to a maximum 15 years 
after the l ast pati ent vi sit for the study  at a f acility selected by  the sponsor.  The samples and any 
data generated from them can only be linked back to the patie nt by investi gator si te personnel.  
The durati on allows the sponsor to respond to regulatory  requests related to the study  treatment .
Samples will  be destroy ed according to a process consistent with local regulat ion.  
10.4.2.3. Mandatory Tumor Tissue Samples
Previously  obtained archived FFPE tissue will be requested both for a central patho logy review 
to confirm diagnosis and for exploratory bio marker research . In the event that archived tissue is 
not available at study  entry , a tumor biopsy of primary  or m etastat ic tissue willberequi redand 
must be collected prior to randomizat ion(treatm ent can be init iated after tissue co llection, 
without the need to wait for availabilit y of t issue analysis results) .  A paraffin block (FFPE) is 
acceptable. Due diligence shoul d be used to m ake sure that tum or specimen (not a normal 
adjacent or a tum or margin sam ple) is provi ded. De-ident ified and translated pathology  notes 
accompanying archival t issue may also be requested .
Mutati on profiling, copy  number variabilit y, gen e expressi on, and/or immunohistochemistry  may 
be perform ed on these ti ssue samples to assess potent ial associ ations wit h these bio markers 
relevant to pathways associated with STS, the mechanism o f action of  olaratum ab, 
or 
doxorubi cin,and/or cancer -related condit ions,and may also be used for related research 
methods. The paraffin -embedded blocks will be sectioned and sent back to the site.  Slides will 
not be returned.
Tissue samples will be stored for a maximum o f 15 years after the last pati ent visi t for the study; 
any samples remaining at that time will be destroyed.
10.4.3. Samples for Immunogenicity Research
Blood sam ples f or immunogenicit y testing will  be collected to determine antibody  producti on 
against olaratum ab.  To interpret the results of immunogenic ity, blood samples will  becollected 
at the sam e time po intsas the blood samplesdesignated to measure the serum  concentrati onsof 
olaratum ab(as noted in Section 10.4.4 ).
In the event of an olaratumab/placebo infusio n-related reacti on(IRR) , unscheduled blood 
samples will be co llected for addit ional immunogenicit y analysis.  These addit ional samples will 
be co llected as close as possible to the onset of the event, at the point of resolut ion from the 
event, and within 30 days after onset of the event (as noted in Attachm ent 7 ).
Immunogenicit y will be assessed by  a validated assay  designed to detect anti -drug antibodies in 
the presence o f the olaratu mab.  Ant ibodies may be further characterized and/or evaluated for 
their abili ty to neutralize the activit y of olaratum ab.  The serum  samples collected for 
immunogenicit y testing will be stored at a facilit y designated by  the Sponsor.
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 63
LY3012207Samples may  be stored for a maximum of 15 y ears f ollowing l ast pati ent visi t for the tri al at a 
facilit y selected by  the sponsor to enable further analysis of immune responses to olaratum ab.  
The durati on allows the sponsor to respond to regulatory requests related to olaratum ab.
10.4.4. Samples for Drug Concentration Measurements 
Pharmacokinetics
At the visit s and t imes specified in the Pharm acokinet ic, Immunogenicit y, and 
Pharmacodynamic Sampling Schedule (Attachm ent 7 ), venous blood sam ples will  be collected
for all patients rando mized in the study.  These samples will be used to determine the serum
concentrations of olaratum aband plasma concentrations o fdoxorubi cin.
Serum  concentrati ons of  olaratum ab will be assayed using a validated enzyme -linked 
immunosorbent assay  (ELISA) method.  Doxorubicin concentrations in plasma will be analyzed 
using a validated liquid chromatography  with tandem  mass spectrometry  (LC/MS/MS) a ssay.
Instructi ons for the collect ion and handling of blood samples will be provided by the sponsor.  It 
is preferred that the blood samples be obtained from a peripheral locat ion.  Bl ood sam ples will  
be allowed fro m central  access devices , but a sample drawn from a centra l catheter of any  type 
for PK must take precautions to prevent obtaining a dilute sample.  If mult iple samples are 
obtained centrally , the PK sample shoul d be the l ast specimen drawn to reduce the potential for a 
diluted or improperly drawn sample.  The actual date and time (24 -hour clock time) of each 
sampling will be recorded. Up to a maximum o f 5additional samples may  be drawn at different 
time points during the study  if warranted (for example, for safet y asses sment) and agreed upon 
between bo th the investigator and Lilly (refer to Attachment 7 for time points) .  Inthe event of 
an IRR, unscheduled blood sam ples will be collected to determine serum olaratum ab
concentrations, as described in Sect ion 10.4.3 .
These samples will be analyzed at a laboratory designated by  the sponsor .  The serum  samples 
for PK will be stored at a facilit y designated by  the Sponsor.   The rem aining sample materials 
collected for PK may be pooled and used for explo ratory metabo lism and other exploratory 
PK/pharmacodynamic work as deemed appropriate.
Drug concentration informat ion that would unblind the study  will not be reported to invest igative 
sites or blinded personnel unt il the study has been unblinded.
Bioanaly tical samples collected to m easure ol aratum ab and doxorubi cin concentrati on will be 
retained for a maximum o f 1 year following l ast pati ent visi t for the study .
10.5. Appropriateness of Measurements
The m easures used to assess safet y and efficacy in this study  are consistent wi th those used in 
most conve ntional onco logy trials.
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 64
LY301220711.Data Quality  Assurance
To ensure accurate, complete, and reliable data, Lilly or its representatives will do the fo llowing:
Provide instructi onal material to the study  sites, as appropriate
Sponsor start -up training to instruct the investigators and study coordinators.  This 
session will give instruction on the protocol, the complet ion of the CRFs, and study  
procedures.
Make peri odic visi ts to the study  site

records in the patient files as original source documents for the study .  If requested, the
investigator will provide Lilly , applicable regul atory  agencies, and applicable ERBs with direct 
access to original source documents.
11.1. Data Capture S ystem
An electronic data capture sy stem  will be used in this trial.  The site maintains a separate source 
for the data entered by  the si te into the sponsor -provided electronic data capture system.
Case report form data will be encoded and stored in a clinical trial database.  Data managed by a 
central  vendor, such as laboratory  test data or ECG data, will be st ored electronically in the 
central  vendor’s database system.  Data will subsequent ly be transferred from the central vendor 
to the Lilly generic labs system.
Any data for which the paper documentation provided by the patient will serve as the source 
docum ent will be identified and documented by  each si te in that si te’s study  file.  Paper 
docum entati on provi ded by  the patient may include, for example, a paper diary  to collect pati ent-
reported outcome (PRO) measures (for example, a rating scale), a daily dosi ng schedule, or an 
event di ary.
Data from co mplaint forms submitted to Lilly will be encoded and stored in the global product 
complaint m anagement sy stem .

LY301220712.Sample Size and Statistical Methods
12.1. Determination of Sample Size
The primary  object ive of this study  is to com pare olaratum ab pl us doxorubi cin(experimental  
arm)versus placebo pl us doxorubicin (control  arm) in terms of OS in patients with advanced, 
metastati cSTS.  The study  will screen approximately 500patients to enroll 460patients in 1:1 
rando mization (230patients in the experimental arm and230patients in the control  arm).  The 
intent-to-treat sam ple size of 460 was selected assuming the 
final analysis of OS will occur when 
at least 322 OS events have been observed ; therefo re, the sample size of 460 ensures a maximum 
of 30% censoring at the final OS analysis.
Thefinal total of 322 OSevents (deaths) is an appropriate minimum for the final analysis o fOS, 
provi ding 80% statist ical power for a two-sided log-rank test at a 0.05 significance l evel 
(assuming the true OS HR is 0.73).  An OS HR of 0.73 corresponds approximately to an 
increased median survival from 15months (estimated from published clinical data in various 
types of  patients with advanced or m etastatic STS as we ll as based on the JGDG trial results ) in 
doxorubi cin alo neto 20.5 months for olaratumab combined with doxorubicin.  
Two interim efficacy  analyses for OS areplanned after 120
(37% of the target ed final number of
322OS events ) and 194 OS events ( 60% of the final OS events ) have been observed .An 
O’Brien -Fleming alpha spending function will be used to determine the efficacy boundary.  
Approximate O’Brien -Fleming alpha levels and OS HR boundaries for the two interims and the 
final analysis are as fo llows(using EAST®6.3): 
First interim:  120 events, al pha = 0.00 05, HR < 0.525
Second interim:  194 events, alpha = 0.0075, HR < 0.680
Final:  322 events, alpha = 0.0476, HR < 0.801
Anoverall two-sided alpha l evel of 0.05 is maintained across interim and fi nal analyses of OS
through the use of this O’Brien -Fleming method .  In addit ion, a scheme ( e.g. Glimm et al. 2010) 
for maintaining a 0.05 study -wise alpha error rate across OS and the following secondary  
endpo ints will be pre-specified in the Statist ical Analysis Plan:
PFS
ORR
DCR
Durati on of  response
Durati on of  disease control
12.2. Statistical and Analytical Plans
12.2.1. General Considerations
Statistical analysis o f this study  will be the responsibilit y ofLilly or i ts desi gnee.
All tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a 2 -sided al pha level of 0.05, unless otherwise 
stated.  All CIs will be given at a 2 -sided 95% level, unless otherwise stated .
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 66
LY3012207Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will requi re an amendment 
ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol. Before unblinding of the aggregate 
database, minor modifications or clarificat ions to the data analysis methods may be described 
and just ified in the statist ical analysis plan. Any o ther change to the data analysis methods 
described in the protocol, and the just ificat ion for making the change, will be described in the 
clinical study  report.
If study  data vi olate key  stati stical assumpt ionsof an analysis method, alternat ive statist ical 
methods m ay be used.
Addit ional exploratory  analyses of the data will be conducted as deemed appropriate.
12.2.1.1. Analysis Populations
The fo llowing popul ations will be defined for this study :
Intent -to-Treat population: will include all randomized pat ients. The ITT analysis of 
efficacy  data will  consider all ocati on of  patients to treatm ent groups as randomized, and not 
by actual  treatm ent received. This popul ation will be used for all baseline, efficacy, and 
healt h outcom e analyses.
Per-Protocol population: will include all pat ients who are randomized and received at least 
1 cycle of study  treatm ent, and do not have any  major protocol  violations that could 
potenti ally affect the efficacy conclusio ns of the study . This popul ation will be defined in 
detail in the SAP pri or to database l ock, and will be used for sensit ivity analyses of OS and 
PFS; other efficacy en dpoints m ay also be analyzed.
Safety population: will include all rando mized pati ents who received any  quant ity of study  
treatm ent, regardless o f their eligibili ty for the study . The safet y evaluat ion will be 
perform ed based on the actual study  treatm ent a pati ent has received, regardless o f the arm  to 
which he or she was rando mized. The safet y populat ion will be used for all dosing/exposure, 
advers e events, and resource utilizat ion analyses.
12.2.2. Patient Disposition
A detailed description o f patient di sposi tion will be provi ded.  It will  include a summary  of the 
number and percentage of patients entered into the study , enrolled in the study , and treated as 
well as number and percentage of patients completing the study , or discont inuing (overall and by 
reason for discont inuat ion).  A summary  of all major protocol deviat ions will be provided.
12.2.3. Patient Characteristics
Descript ion of pat ient characterist ics at baseline, such as pat ient demographics, baseline disease 
characterist ics, preexist ing condit ions, and pri or therapi es will  be reported usi ng des criptive 
statist ics.
12.2.4. Concomitant Therapy
Concomitant medicat ions will be summarized for the safet y populati on. 
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 67
LY301220712.2.4.1. Postdiscontinuation Therapy
The numbers and percentages of patients reporting postdiscont inuat ion therapies will be 
provi ded overall, by  type of therapy  (surgery , radiotherapy , or systemic therapy ), and by  drug 
name , for the ITT popul ation.
12.2.5. Treatment Compliance
The number of dose omissio ns, reducti ons, del ays, number of cy cles received, and dose intensit y 
will be summarized for all treated patient s per treatment arm.
12.2.6. Primary Outcome and Methodology
The analysis of OS at both the interim and final analysis t ime po intswill be based on the 
stratified log-rank test ,stratified b y randomizat ion strata (CRF data ).  The testing boundaries 
(approximate va
lues can be found in Section 12.1)will be determined using an O’Brien -Fleming
alpha spending function. OSsurvival curves, the median wit h 95% CI and survival rates at 
various time po ints for each treatment group will be es timated using Kaplan -Meier method
(Kaplan and Meier 1958) .  The HR will be est imated using a stratified Cox regressio n model,
stratified b y randomization strata (CRF data ).  All rando mized patients, according to the ITT 
principle, will be included in the a nalysis of this endpoint.
Two interim analys es areplanned f or efficacy as described in Secti on 12.1.  The actual stopping 
boundaries and nominal alpha levels will be calculated at the time of conduct ing interim analyses 
and the final analysis ,with efficacy  boundaries and al pha values following an O’Brien -Flemin g 
alphaspending function.  The boundaries presented in Section 12.1 are approximate .
The fo llowing sensit ivity analyses for OS will be perform ed:
Unstratified log -rank test and Cox models 
Stratified log -rank test and Cox models, stratified by strata at rando mizat ion 
(IWRS data)
Analysis for the per- protocol populat ion
Univariate and mult ivariate Cox regression model will be used to explore 
potenti al prognosti c and/or predi ctive factors.
12.2.7. Other Analyses of Efficacy
12.2.7.1. Progression -Free Survival
A precise definit ion of events and censoring for progression -free survival will bedefined in the 
SAP.  Progression -free survival will be analyzed using the Kaplan -Meier m ethod, and com pared 
based on a log-rank test, stratified by the same stratification factors used in the analysis o f the 
primary  endpoint OS.
PFS will be co mpared between the two treatment groups based on log -rank test, stratified by 
CRF stratificat ion factors.  PFS survival curves, the median with 95% CI and survival rates at 
various time po intsfor each treatment group will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier method
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 68
LY3012207(Kaplan and Meier 1958) .  The HR will be est imated using a stratified Cox regressio n model,
stratified b y randomization strata (CRF data ).
The fo llowing se nsitivity analyses will be perf ormed for PFS:
Time to component events of PFS, such as time to new metastases, etc.
Unstratifi ed log-rank test and Cox models
Stratified log -rank test and Cox models, stratified by strata at rando mizat ion 
(IWRS data)
Analysis including both radiographic a nd symptomat ic progressions as PFS 
events
Analysis for the per- protocol populat ion
Sensit ivity analysis for various PFS censoring ru les (for example, post-
discontinuat ion systemic ant icancer therapy , missing 2 or more tum or 
assessments prior to PD/death, etc.; more details will be spec ified in SAP )
Univariate and mult ivariate Cox regression model will be used to explore 
potenti al prognosti c and/or predi ctive factors.
12.2.7.2. Analysis of Tumor Response
The BOR (Best Overall Response) will be determined using the RECIST v.1.1 guidelines.
The ORR will be calculated as the number of pat ients who achieve a best overall response o f CR 
or PR, divided by  the total  number of patients randomized to the correspon ding treatment group 
(ITT popul ation).  Addit ionally , a subgroup analysis will be performed for patients with 
measurable disease and for patients with nonmeasurable but evaluable disease.  Pati ents who do 
not have a tumor response assessment for any  reason are considered as nonresponders and are 
included in the deno minator when calculat ing the response rate.  The ORR with 95% CI 
observed in each treatment group will be summarized and co mpared using the Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel test adjust ing for the CRF strata at time of OS final analysis.
Disease Control  Rate ( DCR ), the proportion of patients who have best overall response of CR or 
PR or SD, i s defined as the number of patients with aCR, a PR or an SD, divided by the number 
of patients in the analysis popul ation.  The DCR will  be analyzed using the same approach as 
ORR.
12.2.7.3. Additional Efficacy A nalyses
Addit ional analyses of the m easures defined in Section 10.1.4 , as well as any other pre -planned 
efficacy  analyses will be defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan.
12.2.8. Pharmacokinetic and Immuno genic Analyses
Pharmacokinetics:
Pharmacokinet ics analyses will be conducted on all patients who have received at least 1 dose of 
study  treatm ent and have had PK samples collected .
Mean populat ion PK param eters for olaratum abin serum (clearance, vo lumeof distribut ion, and 
half-life) and inter -individual PK variabili ty will be com puted for this study  using nonlinear

concentration relat ionship in the target populat ion.  Covari ate effects (such as age, weight and 
sex) on the PK parameters of olaratum ab in serum will also be investigated.
PK data collected for doxorubicin will be analyzed using descriptive methods.
Exploratory  PK/PD analyses mayalso be conducted to characterize the exposure -response 
(biomarker) rel ationship in this study .  The PK and PK/PD analyses willbe reported as separate 
stand -alone reports for thi s study .  Addi tional analyses such as exposure -response using TTP 
and/or other appropriate clinical endpo ints may be perform ed, if warranted by  the data.  
The version o f any so ftware used for the analysis will be documented, and the program will meet 
Lilly requirements of software validat ion.  It is possible that other validated equivalent PK 
software programs ma y be utilized if appropriate, warranted, and approved by global PK 
management.
Immunogenicity: 
Incidence of ant i-olaratum ab ant ibodies will be tabulated.  The potential impact of 
immunogenicit y on ol aratumab exposure will be evaluated in the populat ion PK modeling 
exercises where immunogenicit y will be evaluated as a covariate.  In addit ion, graphical 
assessments will be conducted, as appropriate, to compare drug exposure between ADA negat ive 
and ADA posit ive patients at correspondent visits, or before and after ADA development for 
patients who developed ADA.
In the event of an infusio n-related reaction, the immunogenicit y and ol aratum ab serum  
concentrations will be tabulated.
12.2.9. Translational Research Analyses
Biomarker assay  resul ts will be summarized and correlated with clinical outcomes.  
12.2.10. Analyses of Patient -Reported Outcomes (PROs)
Patient-reported outcomes are measured through the following:
mBPI -sf(Brief Pain Inventory [Short Form] Modified)
EORTC QLQ -C30 (The European Organization fo r Research and Treatment of Cancer 
Qualit y of Life Quest ionnaire Core 30)
EQ-5D- 5L (EuroQol 5 -Dimension 5 -Level )
For each instrument (mBPI -sf, EORTC QLQ -C30, and EQ -5D-5L) , percentage compliance will 
be calculated as the number of completed assessments divided by the number of expected 
assessments (that is, patients still on study  and alive). Percentage compliance and reasons for 
non-compliance will be summarized by treatm ent arm  and t imepoint.
Data will be separately summarized by treatment and time point using descript ive statistics. The 
main efficacy measure for the pain endpo int will be the time to first worsening of the mBPI -sf 

I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 70
LY3012207“worst pain” score. Time to first worse ning in pain will be described using the method of Kaplan 
and Meier and analyzes will be made between the 2 arms by a log- rank test.  “Worsening” will 
be defined as either a “worst pain” increase o f >2 points postbaseline (Farrar et al. 2001; 
Rowbotham 2001) or an analgesic drug class increase of >1 level.  However, other approaches to 
defining clinically meaningful worsening in pain might be considered.  Further details will be 
provi ded in the Statist ical Analysis Plan.   
Addit ionally ,time to first worse ning of QLQ -C30 summary scores (see Section 10.2)will be 
analyzed using Kaplan -Meier and Cox methods. Further statistical analysis to be performed for 
PROs will be defined and detailed in the Statist ical Analysis Plan.  
12.2.11. Safety Analyses
All safet y summaries and analyses will be based upon the safety  popul ation as defined in 
Secti on12.2.1 , unless otherwise indicated , and include:
Adverse events (AE) will be summarized by MedDRA®System  Organ 
Class/preferred term , classified from verbat im terms.  The incidence and percentage 
of patients wi th at least one occurrence of a preferred term will be included, 
according to the most severe NCI -CTCAE Versi on 4
.0grade.  Causalit y (relat ionship 
to study  drug), acti on taken, and outcome will be summarized separately .  Durati on of  
AE will be determined and included in the list ings.
Study  drug exposure will be summarized for each arm with fo llowing vari ables: 
number of infusio n (except capecitabine), number of cycles, duration of therapy , 
cumulative dose, dose intensit y and relative dose intensit y.
Laboratory  resul ts will be classified according to the NCI -CTCAE, Versi on 4. 0.  
Incidence of laboratory  abnorm alities will be summarized.
Hospitalizations due to AEs, transfusio ns, and vital sign s will be summarized.
12.2.12. Subgroup Analyses
Subgrou p analyses of PFS and OS willbe performed and will be detailed in theStatistical 
Analysis Plan.
12.2.13. Interim Analyses
A limited number of pre -identified individuals may gain access to the limited unblinded data, as 
specified in the unblinding plan, prior to aninterim or final database lock, in order to init iate the 
final populat ion pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model d evelopment processes for interim or 
final analyses.  Informat ion that m ay unblind the study  during the analyses will not be reported 
to study  sites or blinded study  team  until the study  has been unblinded.
An independent data monitorin g commi ttee (i DMC) will be established to conduct safet y 
reviews.  The membership, roles, and responsibilit ies of the iDMC are defined in the iDMC 
Charter (a separate document) .
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 71
LY3012207There will be no prespecified rules for stopping or modifying the trial due to safet y concerns.  
The iDMC members will review unblinded interim safet y data to determine whether there are 
sufficient safet y concerns to j ustify modifying the study  or the terminat ion of study  treatm ent 
and/or enrollment.
Only the iDMC is authori zed to e valuate unblinded safet y analyses.  Study  sites will  receive 
inform ation about interim results ONLY if they need to know for the safet y of their pati ents.
Unblinding details are provided in the blinding section of the protocol (Section 9.5).  
IDMC safety  reviews will  be perform ed for all randomized patients approximately twice per 
year, wi th the first such review taking place roughly  6-10 m onths after the first patient has 
rando mized . Details as to the process and co mmunicat ion plan will be provi ded in the i DMC 
Charter.
Two interim efficacy analyse s will be performed by  an indepen dent Data Monitoring Committee 
(iDMC) as described in Sect ion 12.1. TheiDMC Charter (a separate document) will provide 
detailed guidance for the conduct of the interim analyses and describe the process for 
recommend ingchanges to the trial in the event that interim OSresul ts are stati stically 
significant.   In the event of a statistically significant interim resul t for OS according to the 
specifications of Section 12.2.1 and the iDMC Charter, invest igative sites will be informed that 
the study  has met i ts primary  objective and thus confirmed the efficacy of olaratumab in 
combinat ion with doxorubi cin. It is recommended that any  patients currently receiving study  
treatm ent at the time of a posit ive interim result shoul d continue his/her study  treatm ent as
originally planned.  This recommendat ion is appropriate given that any posit ive interim result 
will not support the use of olaratumab in pat ients who have (current ly or previously) received 
treatm ent wi th single -agen tdoxorubicin.

LY3012207Attachment 6. Protocol JGDJ RECIST Criteria 1.1
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study  using the international criteria proposed 
by the New Response Evaluat ion Cri teria in Solid Tumors (RECIST): Revised RECIST 
Guideline (ver sion 1.1; Eisenhauer et al. 2009).  
Measurability of Tumor at Baseline
Tumor lesi ons/lymph nodes will be categorized at baseline as measurable or nonmeasurable.  
Measurable disease is defined by  the presence of at l east 1 m easurable l esion.
Measurable 
Tumor lesi ons:  Measured in at least 1 dimensio n (longest di ameter in the plane o f measurement 
is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
10 mm by  com puted tom ography  (CT) or m agnet ic resonance imaging (MRI) 
scan (slice thickness 5 mm) 
10 mm caliper meas urement by  clinical  exam (non -measurable lesio ns if cannot 
be accurately measured with calipers)
20 mm by  chest X -ray.
Malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node m ust be 15 mm  in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan thickness recommended 
to be 5 mm ).
Nonmeasurable 
All other lesio ns, including small lesio ns (lo ngest di ameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes 
with 10 to <15 mm short axis) as well as truly nonmeasurable lesio ns.  Lesio ns considere d truly  
non-measurable include:  leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusio ns, 
lymphangitis cut is/pulmo nis, inflammatory  breast di sease, lymphangit is involvement of skin or 
lung, abdo minal masses/abdo minal organo megaly identified by physi cal exam  that i s not 
measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.
Special Considerations for Lesion Measurability
Bone l esions:  
Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are not consi dered adequate imaging 
techniques to measure bone lesio ns.
Lytic bone lesio ns or mixed ly tic-blastic l esions, wit h ident ifiable so ft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by  cross sect ional imaging techniques such as 
CT or MRI, can be considered measurable lesio ns if the so ft tissue com ponent 
meets the definit ion of measurabili ty.
Blastic bone l esions are non -measurable.
Cystic lesions:  
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 88
LY3012207Simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither 
measurable nor nonmeasurable) 
Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesio ns,if they meet the definit ion of measurabilit y.  If noncyst ic 
lesions are presented in the same patients, these are preferred for select ion as 
target lesio ns.
Lesio ns wi th Prior Local Treatm ent:
Tumor lesi ons situated at a previ ously i rradiated area, or i n an area subjected to other 
loco-regional therapy, are non -measurable unless there has been demo nstrated 
progression in the lesio n.  
Baseline Documentation of Target and Non -Target Lesion
Target Lesions
When more than 1 measurable lesio n is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum o f 5 
lesions total  (and a m aximum  of 2 lesio ns per organ) representative o f all invo lved organs should 
be ident ified as target lesio ns and will be recorded and measured at baseline. Non-nodal Target 
lesions shoul d be selected on the basis o f their size (l esions with the l ongest di ameter), be 
representative of all invo lved organs, and can be reproduced in repeated measurements .  
Measurable lymph nodes are target lesions if they meet the criteria of a short axis of 15 mm by  
CT scan.  All measurements are to be recorded in the case record form (CRF) in millimeters (or 
decimal fract ions of centimeters [cm]).
Nontarget Lesions
All other lesio ns (or sites of disease) are identified as nontarget lesio ns(chosen based on their 
representativeness o f involved organs and the ability to be reproduced in repeated measurements) 
and should be recorded at baseline.  Measurement of these lesio ns are not required but should be 
followed as ‘present,’ ‘absent,’ or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression.’  In addit ion, it is 
possible to record mult iple nontarget lesio ns involving the same organ as a single item on the 
CRF (for example, mult iple liver m etastases recorded as 1 liver lesio n).
Lymph nodes with short axis 10 mm  but <15 mm shoul d be considered nontarget lesio ns.  
Nodes that have a short axis <10 mm are considered nonpathological and are not recorded or 
followed.
Specifications by Methods of Measurement
All measurements s hould be recorded in m etric notati on, using a rul er or calipers if clinically 
assessed.  All baseline evaluat ions should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatm ent and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
ident ified and reported lesio n at baseline and during fo llow-up.  Im aging- based evaluat ion is 
shoul d always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesio n(s)being fo llowed 
cannot be imaged but are assessed by clinical exam.  
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 89
LY3012207An adequate vo lume of a suitable contrast agent should be given so that the metastases are 
demonstrated to best effect and a consistent method is used on subsequent examinat ions for any  
given pat ient.  If prior to enrollment it is known a patient is not able to undergo CT scans with IV 
contrast due to allergy  or renal  insufficiency , the decisi on as to whether a non -contrast CT or 
MRI (wi th or wi thout IV contrast) should be used to evaluat e the patient at baseline and fo llow-
up shoul d be guided by  the tum or type under investi gation and the anatomic location of the 
disease.
Clinical Lesions:  Clinical lesio ns will only be considered measurable when they  are superficial  
and 10 mm diameter a s assessed using calipers (for example, skin nodules).  For the case of 
skin lesio ns, docum entati on by co lor photography , incl uding a rul er to estimate the size of the 
lesion is recommended.  When lesio ns can be evaluated by  both clinical exam and imaging,
imaging evaluat ion should be undertaken since it is more object ive and may be reviewed at the 
end of the study .
Chest X -ray:  Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray when progressi on is an important endpoint.  
Lesio ns on chest X -ray may be considered m easurable if they  are cl early  defined and surrounded 
by aerated l ung.
CT and MRI :  CT scan is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesio ns 
selected for response assessment.  Measurabilit y of lesio ns on CT scan is based on the 
assumpt ion that CT slice thickness is 5 mm.  When CT scan have slice thickness >5 mm, the 
minimum size for a measurable lesio n shoul d be twi ce the slice thickness.  MRI is also 
acceptable in certain situations (for example, for body  scans).  If there is concern about radi ation 
exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
Ultrasound:   Ultrasound should not be used to measure lesion size.  Ultrasound examinat ions 
cannot be reproduced in their ent irety for independent review at a later date and, because they are 
operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be 
taken fro m one assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by  ultrasound in the course 
of the study , confi rmation by CT or MRI i sadvised.
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy :  The utilizat ion of these techniques for object ive tumor evaluat ion is 
not advised.  However, such techniques can be useful to confirm co mplete pathol ogical response 
when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in tr ials where recurrence fo llowing com plete 
response or surgical resect ion is an endpo int.
Tumor Markers :  Tum or markers al one cannot be used to assess tumor response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they  must norm alize for a patient to be considered in 
complete response (CR).  Specific guidelines for both prostate -specific ant igen (P SA) response 
(in recurrent prostate cancer) and CA -125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) have been 
published .  
Cytology, Histology :  These techniques can be used to different iate between partial responses 
(PR) and complete response (CR) in rare cases if required by protocol (for example, residual 
lesions in tum or types such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can 
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 90
LY3012207remain).  When effusio ns are known to be a potential adverse effect of treatment (for example, 
with certain taxane co mpounds or angiogenesis inhibitors), the cy tological confirmat ion of the 
neopl astic ori gin o f any effusio n that appears or worsens during treatment can be considered if 
the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease (SD) in order to diff erent iate 
between response (or SD) and progressive disease (PD). 
Pet Scan (FDG -PET, PET CT) :  PET is not recommended for lesio n assessment. If a new lesio n 
is found by  PET, another assessment must be done by  CT, unless the PET CT i s of diagnostic 
qualit y.  If CT is done to confirm the results of the earlier PET scan, the date of progression must 
be reported as the earlier date of the PET scan. 
Bone Scan :  If lesions measured by bone scan are reported at baseline, it is necessary to repeat 
the bone scan when trying to ident ify a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) in target 
disease or when progression in bone is suspected. 
Response Criteria
Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance o f all target lesio ns.  Any patholo gical  lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) m ust have reduct ion in short axi s to <10 mm.  Tum or marker 
resul ts must have norm alized.
Partial Response (PR):   At least a 30% decrease in the sum o f diameter of target l esions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesio ns, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study  (including the baseline sum if that is the smallest).  
In addit ion to the relat ive increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an abso lute increase 
of at least 5 mm.   The appearance of 1 or more new lesio ns is also considered progression.
For equivocal findings of progression (for example, very  small  and uncertain new l esions; cyst ic 
changes or necrosis in exist ing lesions), treatment ma y cont inue unt il the next scheduled 
assessment.  If at the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of 
progression should be the earlier date when progressio n was suspected.
Stable Disease (SD):   Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify  for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study .
Not Evaluable:  When an inco mplete radio logic assessment of target lesio ns is performed or 
there is a change in the method of measurement from baseline that impact sthe abilit y to make a 
reliable evaluat ion of response . 
Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions
Complete Response:   Disappearance of all nontarget lesio ns and normalizat ion of tum or marker 
level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathol ogical or norm al in size (<10mm short axis).
Non-CR/ non -PD:  Persistence of 1 or more nontarget lesio ns and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker l evel above the norm al limits.
I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 91
LY3012207Progressive Disease:  Unequivocal progression o f exist ing nontarget lesio ns.  The appearance o f
1 or m ore new l esions i s also consi dered progression.
Not Evaluable : When a change in method of measurement from baseline occurs and impacts the 
abilit y to make a reliable evaluat ion of response .
Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded fro m the start of the study  treatment until 
the earliest of object ive progression or start of new anticancer therapy, taking into accoun t any  
requi rement for confirmat ion.  The patient’s best overall response assignment will depend on the 
findings of both target and nontarget disease and will also take into considerat ion the appearance 
of new lesio ns.  The Best Overall Response will be calculated via an algorithm using the 
assessment responses provided by the invest igator over the course of the trial.  
Time Point Response
It is assumed that at each protocol -specified t ime point, a response assessment occurs.  ( When no 
imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the patient is not eva luable (NE) at 
that time po int.)  Table 1 provides a summary o f the overall response status calculat ion at each 
time point for patients who have measurable disease at baseline.

I5B-MC-JGDJ Clinical Protocol Page 92
LY3012207Frequency of Tumor Re -Evaluation
A baseline tumor evaluat ion must be performed within 4 weeks before patient begins study  
treatm ent. Frequency of tumor re -evaluat ion while on and adapted to treatment should be 
protocol -specific and adapted to the ty pe and schedul e of treatm ent.  In the context of Phase 2 
studi es where the beneficial effect therapy  is not known, fo llow-up every  6-8 weeks is 
reasonable.  Normally , all target and non -target si tes are evaluated at each assessment using the 
same m ethod.  However, bone scans may need to be repeated only when CR is ident ified in 
target disease or when progression in bone is suspected.  
Confirm atory Measurement/Duration of Response
Confirmation :
The m ain goal  of confirmat ion of object ive response in clinical trials is to avoid overest imating 
the response rate observed. 
In randomized trial (Phase 2 or 3) or studies where SD or progression is the primary  endpoints, 
confirmat ion of response is not required.  
In the case of SD, fo llow-up m easurements m ust have met the SD criteria at least once after start 
of treatm ent at a minimum interval no t less than 5weeks measured from rando mizat ion..
Duration of Overall Response
The durati on of  overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for 
CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that disease is rec urrent or obj ective 
progression is observed (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded on 
study ).
The durati on of  overall CR is measured fro m the time measurement criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that recurrent disease is object ively documented.
Duration of Stable Disease
Stabl e disease is m easured from  the start of the treatment (in rando mized trials, from date of 
rando mizat ion) unt il the criteria for objective progressio n are m et, taking as reference the 
smallest sum on study  (if the baseline sum is the smallest, that is the reference for calculat ion of 
PD).  
Independent Review of Response and Progression
When object ive response (CR + PR) is the primary end point, and when key drug development 
decisio ns are based on t he observat ion of a minimum number of responders, it is recommended 
that all claimed responses be reviewed by an expert(s) independent of the study .  If the study  is a 
rando mized trial, ideally reviewers should be blinded to treatment assignment.

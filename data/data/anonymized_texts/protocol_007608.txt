Study  Drug  Avelumab;  10mg/kg  delivered  by IV infusion  
Study  Design  This clinical  trial will be designed  as a single -arm, single -institution  
safety  study  at Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center  Main  
Campus  and Regional  Sites.  The main  objective  is to evaluate the 
safety  of a novel  combination  of avelumab (anti-PD-L1 mAb)  and 
stereotactic  body  radiation therapy  (SBRT)  for advanced malignant  
pleural  and peritoneal  mesothelioma  (MPM).  
 
The treatment  will consist  of one dose of avelumab every  other  
week  as well as a short  course  of SBRT  after the first two doses  
of avelumab.  Avelumab will be continued  up to 24 months  or 
until disease progression.  To further  enhance our current  
understanding  of tumor  immunology  as well as prognostic  
biomarkers,  we will collect  peripheral  serum  samples  before,  
during and after treatment,  and tumor  biopsies  of the irradiated  
and an unirradiated lesion  (if available)  before and after radiation.  
 
The safety  endpoint  of the  trial will be assessed  based on grade  
3 or higher  non-hematologic  toxicity.  
 
We hypothesize that the combination  of immunotherapy  and SBRT  
will be safe and well tolerated.  Furthermore,  we believe  that this 
combination  therapy  will lead to an increase in tumor -specific T- 
cells and neoantigen  diversity along with a higher  T-cell infiltration  
of irradiated  and unirradiated tumor  lesions  and objective  overall  
responses  in lesions  both in and outside the radiation field. 
 
Accrual  is estimated  to be 1 patient  per month.

2.1 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
• The primary  objective of this study  is to evaluate  the safety  of avelumab plus SBRT.  This 
study  is designed to include both pleural  and peritoneal   mesothelioma.  
• The secondary  objectives  are to  assess:  
o Overall  response rate (ORR)  using modified RECIST  for mesothelioma treated with 
SBRT  and avelumab.  
o Response of irradiated (in-field) and unirradiated (out-of-field) lesions  defined by 
RECIST  1.1 for extrathoracic   disease  
o Progression- free and overall  survival  
• Exploratory  objectives  are to evaluate T-cell infiltration and phenotype both in- and outside the 
irradiated  field, serum  immune  phenotype before and after avelumab plus SBRT,  and 
correlate imaging response (DW/DCE-MRI and PET) with biopsy sample results. 
 
3.0 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE  
 
3.1       Malignant  Mesothelioma 
 
Malignan t pleural/peritoneal  mesothelioma (MPM) is a cancer commonly associatedwith prior 
asbestos  exposure.  The simian  virus 40 (SV40)  has also been  discussed as a potential  
carcinogen [3, 4] as around 25% of MPM  patients  have no known asbestos  exposure.  Pleural  
mesothelioma,  affecting the lining  of the lungs,  accounts  for about  75- 80% of all cases  while  
the peritoneal  type, found in the abdomen,  is present  in 10-15% of mesothelioma patients.  
While  the US incidence appears  steady  at 3,000 new diagnoses  per year,  the incidence of 
mesothelioma continues  to increase  globally  and in some regions  is epidemic.[5,  6] MPM  is 
often unresectable at diagnosis  and the mean overall  survival  is only 8-13 months.[7]  MPM  is 
almost  universally  lethal  and therapeutic  advances  have largely  plateaued over the past 
decade.  Even  with resectable disease,  traditional  treatments, including  multimodality  therapy,  
have a limited  and transient  impact  on the disease.  Local  recurrences  are quite common and 
cause tremendous  morbidity  for patients.[8]  As there  are no FDA-approved therapies  for 
second-line treatment of MPM, an unmet need  persists and the bar for therapeutic efficacy in 
this setting is   low. 
 
3.2     Clinical Data  on Immunotherapy  and Mesothelioma  
 
The recent  emergence of immunotherapy  in cancer  provides  a new avenue for therapy  in 
MPM. T-cell checkpoint inhibitors like anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 have shown 
durable activity  and prolonged disease stabilization in solid tumors  like melanoma,  NSCLC  
and colorectal  cancer  even after treatment  cessation.[9,  10] Although  anti-PD-1 treatment  
alone is currently  being  studied  (clinicaltrials.gov  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  and has shown impressive  
preliminary  results,[11]  our proposal  to  combine PD-1 inhibition  with   radiation

 therapy  is a novel  approach in MPM. There  is already  high-quality  emerging  evidence of 
activity  of immunotherapy  in MPM. 
 
Kindler  et al. reported on anti-CTLA- 4 therapy  as second-  or third-line treatment  of 
unresectable  MPM  at ASCO  2016.  There  was previous  activity  of tremelimumab  shown in pre- 
treated MPM  patients  (Calabro  et al., Lancet  Oncology  2013).  These were  the results  of the 
double- blind,  placebocontrolled DETERMINE study.  Patients  whoprogressed after 1 or 2 lines 
of prior therapy  were  randomized 2:1 to 10mg/kg  q4 weeks  for 7 doses,  then q12 weeks  to 
tremelimumab versus  placebo.   The primary  endpoint  was overall  survival.  
572 total patients  were  randomized,  stratified  by EORTC status,  line of therapy,  and anatomic  
site. There was no statistically  significant  difference  in overall  survival  (median  7.7 vs 7.3 
months,   p=0.408).  
 
Anti-PD-1/PD -L1 agents  have shown  some significant  promise.  At the 2015  AACR,  Alley et al. 
presented  the mesothelioma results  of the KEYNOTE- 028 trial, a non-randomized  multi-  
cohort  phase IB study of pembrolizumab for PD-L1 positive  solid advanced tumors.  In this 
cohort  of 38 patients  (out of 84 screened),  each had > 1% PD-L1 expression in tumor  cells 
or PD-L1-positive  stromal  bands.  The primary  endpoint  was safety,  tolerability,  and preliminary  
efficacy.  88% had received  at least one line of prior therapy,  most  of which  was a platinum - 
based  agent  in combination with pemetrexed.  Treatment  was pembrolizumab 10mg/kg every  
2 weeks  for up to 2 years,  or until confirmed progression of disease.  60% of patients  
experienced a drug- related adverse event,  although  only 12% (3 patients)  experienced grade  
3 or higher  toxicity.  No patients  discontinued therapy  due to drug- related events.  There was a 
76% disease control  rate, which  was remarkable (24%  overall  response rate, with 52% stable  
disease).  Given  this significant  response rate and potential  for additional  improvement,  the 
role of immunotherapy,  particularly  with PD-L1 inhibitors  is certainly  warranted.  
 
Data on safety  and early efficacy  information on avelumab in mesothelioma were  first 
presented  at the ASCO  2016 Annual  Meeting by Hassan et al. 53 patients  with unresectable  
pleural  or peritoneal  mesothelioma were  recruited.  These patients  had progressed after a 
platinum -pemetrexed -containing regimen and were unselected  for PD- L1 expression.  They 
were treated  with avelumab 10 mg/kg IV every  2 weeks  until progression,  unacceptable  
toxicity,  or withdrawal.  Tumors  were  assessed every  6 weeks  (RECIST  1.1). Patients  were 
followed for a median of 46 weeks.  The overall  response rate was 9.4%  (5 partial  responses;  
95% CI: 3.1, 20.7)  and an additional  4 were ongoing.  Stable disease was observed in 25 
patients  (47.2%).  This yielded a disease control  rate of 56.6%.  Median  progression- free 
survival was 17.1 weeks (95% CI: 6.1, 30.1), and PFS rate at 24 weeks was 38.4% (95% CI: 
23.3,  53.4).  Grade  ≥ 3 treatment -related  adverse events  occurred  in 4 patients  (7.5%).  This 
included colitis,  decreased lymphocytes,  and increased GGT or CPK.  There  were  no 
treatment -related  deaths.  These data indicate  that avelumab has a reasonable toxicity  profile 
and favorable  activity  in a PD-L1 unselected  population.  We note that this study  was in an 
unselected cohort  of patients.

Additionally,  Calabro et al. are studying a combination of tremelimumab and durvalumab,  an 
anti-PDL1  agent, in patients  with MPM  in the NIBIT -MESO -1 study,  introduced  at ASCO  2016.  
3.3 Preclinical  and Clinical Data  on Radiation  Therapy  and Immunotherapy  
 
Radiation  therapy,  in addition to being highly  effective  in local tumor  control,  has been  
observed to show  anti-tumor  effects  in non-irradiated sites when combined with 
immunotherapy,  first described in MSKCC‟s  department  of radiation oncology.[12]  The 
mechanisms  of this so called  “abscopal  effect”  have yet to be fully e x p l a i n e d . 
Nevertheless,  a growing body of evidence suggests  that the effect  can be attributed to antigen  
exposure by the cells killed  by ionizing radiation,  leading  to an activation  of the immune 
system  through an enhanced repertoire of T-cell receptors  (TCRs)  in tumor  infiltrating  
lymphocytes  (TILs)[13,  14] and to an induc tionof proinflammatory  cytokines.[15]  Results  from 
both preclinical  and clinical trials highlight  the potential  synergy  of radiation and 
immunotherapy.  In a proof -of principle trial, 41 patients  with solid tumors  received  
chemoradiation  for two sites of disease as well as GM-CSF (granulocyte- macrophage colony  
stimulating  factor)  injections.  Of those  patients,  26.8%  (11) showed  objective responses  in a 
third,  untreated lesion.[1]  Interleukin- 2 (IL-2)-based immunotherapy  has been used  as a 
treatment  for melanoma and renal  cancer  for many  years.  Its historical  response rate of 16% 
in melanoma has however  been significantly  improved  to 71% (CI = 95%,  29-96%)  by 
combining  it with stereotactic  body radiation therapy  ( SBRT).[16]  
 
There are no results  yet for clinical  trials evaluating  combined RT and anti PD-L1 therapy,  but 
RT and anti-CTLA4  treatment  has been tested in patients  with melanoma and other cancers.  
Unirradiated lesions  showed partial  response and stable  disease (each in 18% of patients)  for 
a group of 22 melanoma patients  treated with ipilimumab  (CTLA -4 inhibitor)  and RT to an 
index  target.[14]  Consequent  mouse trials revealed that a partial  immunity  against  RT and 
anti-CTLA- 4 had developed after the treatment  and that this phenomenon  could be evaded by 
inhibiting  PD-L1 or PD-1.[14]  Survival  in mice  with GL261 gliomas  was significantly  higher  
after treatment  with RT and anti-PD-1 compared to the control,  RT only and anti-PD-1 only 
groups  (p<.001,  median survival  52, 26, 27 and 30 days respectively).[17]  In a phase  I/II study  
of patients  with metastatic  castrate -resistant  prostate cancer,  the combination of ipilimumab  
(anti-CTLA -4) and RT showed promising tumor  response results  and a manageable toxicity  
profile.[18]  
 
3.4 Avelumab  
 
Avelumab (initially  known as MSB0010718C)  is an investigational  fully human anti-PD-L1 
IgG1 monoclonal  antibody.  By inhibiting  PD-L1 interactions,  avelumab is thought  to enable  
the activation  of T-cells and the adaptive  immune  system.  By retaining a native Fc-region, 
avelumab is thought  to engage  the innate  immune  system  and may induce  antibody - 
dependent  cell-mediated  cytotoxicity (ADCC).

Preclinical data are extensive  in the potency  of avelumab.  Avelumab  has the ability  to lyse a 
range of human tumor  cells in the presence of peripheral  blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)  or 
natural  killer (NK) effectors.  IFN-γ is able to enhanc etumor cell PD-L1 expression  and, in some  
cases,  enhance ADCC  tumor  cell lysis.  Purified  NK cells are potent  effectors  for avelumab.  
Finally,  similar  levels  of avelumab -mediated  ADCC lysis  of tumor  cells are seen using purified  
NK as effectors  from either  healthy  donors  or cancer  patients.[19]  
 
Avelumab  was found  to have significant  activity  in a preclinical  model  of bladder  cancer.  MB49  
murine tumor  cells formed  multifocal,  superficial  tumors  on the mucosal  wall of the bladder,  
similar  to human transitional  cell bladder  tumors.  Administration  of avelumab resulted  in 
antitumor  effects  and subsequently  improved  overall  survival.  Both were  abrogated  by 
selective  in vivo depletion of CD4 or CD8 T cells.  These findings  suggest  that in this murine  
bladder  tumor  model,  interruption of the immune  suppressive PD-1/PD - L1 complex  using 
avelumab releases  an adaptive  immune  response that significantly  reduces  tumor  growth.[20] 
 
Given  the existing  data on anti-solid tumor  effectiveness  of blocking  PD 1/PD -L1 interaction,  
avelumab was rapidly  translated  into clinical  trials under  the JAVELIN  clinical  trial program.  
An umbrella study,  JAVELIN  Solid  Tumor  (Online,  available  
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), sought  to  evaluate safety  and efficacy  of 
avelumab in metastatic  and locally  advanced solid   malignancies.  
 
3.5 SBRT 
 
Stereotactic  body radiotherapy  (SBRT) represents  a significant  innovation in clinical radiation 
oncology.  [21] SBRT  allows  the delivery  of ablative  radiation with relative sparing  of high- dose  
to normal  tissue.  SBRT  has been extensively  studied in lung, pancreas,  liver, and prostate  
cancers,  and has also been used to ablate bone metastases.  Local  control  exceeds  90% in 
spine and lung lesions.  In palliation  of previously  irradiated or radioresistant  bone  
metastases,  SBRT  can provide durable pain control.  SBRT  offers  an excellent  treatment  for 
local management  of metastatic  or progressive lesions.  SBRT  is already  offered in the routine  
management  of early stage inoperable non-small  cell lung cancers  and associated with high 
local control  and low t o x i c i t y . 
 
MSKCC already  has extensive experience treating MPM  with radiation.  Rimner  et al.  treated  
67 patients  with definitive  or adjuvant   pleural  intensity -modulated radiation therapy.[8]  
Actuarial in-field failure rates  at 1- and 2-years  was 56% and 74% respectively.  Distant  failures  
occurred  in 48% of patients.  The predominant  form of failure  was local in- field failures,  
suggesting that dose- escalated radiation,  as offered by SBRT,  may improve  local control  
without  increasing dose -limiting  lung toxicity.  In addition,  a significant  number  of patients  had 
distant  failures,  suggesting  there  is a significant  opportunity  to improve  systemic  therapy.

3.6 Rationale  for Study  Design  
 
In this context  of promising  preclinical and clinical  results,  compelling  evidence supports  our 
proposal  to study  treatment  of stage IV malignant  mesothelioma with combination anti- PD- 
L1 and SBRT.  With this trial we will accomplish several  things:  1) determine the overall  
response rate of combining checkpoint  inhibition  with radiation therapy  with additional  
information on local control  of both targeted and non-targeted disease;  2) confirm  the safety  
of combined radiation therapy  and anti-PD-L1 therapy;  3) determine the role of biomarkers  to 
predict  response to this type of therapy;  and 4) expand our understanding of the mechanism  
of the abscopal  effect.  Since  it is challenging to fully treat the diffuse pleural  disease involved  
with MPM  with local therapies,  MPM  is an excellent  disease in which  to study  and answer  
these questions.  If effective,  this paradigm  has thepotentialtotransform thestandard  treatment  
of unresectable MPM. Furthermore, by examining a variety of biomarkers we will greatly 
expand the currently  limited  knowledge of predictive and influential  biological  factors  in 
radiation and immunotherapy  to support  the optimization  of individualized cancer   care.  
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This is a single -arm, two-stage study  that will be conducted  at Memorial  Sloan  Kettering 
Cancer  Center  Main Campus  and regional  sites. 13 patients  will be accrued  in the first 
stage and, if proven  sufficiently  safe,  an additional  14 patients  will be accrued in a second  
stage.  
 
4.3 Intervention  
 
The main  objective is to evaluate  the safety  of a novel  combination  of avelumab (anti-PD- 
L1 mAb)  and stereotactic  body radiation therapy  (SBRT)  for end-stage malignant  pleural  
and peritoneal  mesothelioma (MPM). 
 
The safety  endpoint  of the trial will be assessed  based on grade 3 or higher  non- 
hematologic  toxicity.  
 
One cycle of avelumab is defined as two weeks.  The treatment  will consist  of one dose  of 
avelumab every  other  week  (Q2W)  as well as a short  course  of SBRT  after the first two doses  
of avelumab.  Patients  will receive avelumab 10mg/kg as an IV infusion  every  2 weeks.  
Avelumab  will be continued up to 24 months  or until disease progression.  Patients  may 
continue Avelumab after RECIST -defined radiologic  progression of disease if the following  
criteria  are met: absence of clinical  symptoms  or signs  indicating clinically  significant  disease  
progression;  no decline  in performance  status;  absence of rapid disease  progression or 
threat  to vital organs  or critical anatomical  sites [e.g.,  CNS metastasis,   respiratory   failure  
due  to  tumor    compression,   spinal   cord  compression]

requiring  urgent  alternative medical  intervention;  no significant,  unacceptable  or irreversible  
toxicities  related to study   treatment. 
 
Patients  will be treated with SBRT  according to standard image- guided radiation treatment  
procedures. Patients  willhavea CT simulation (including 4DCT  scanning if clinically  indicated)  
with 2mm  slice thickness  and daily cone- beam  CT verification  of patient  setup  and tumor  
position.  Patients  will be treated in < 8 fractions.  
 
To further  enhance our current  understanding of tumor  immunology  as well as prognostic  
biomarkers,  we will collect  peripheral  serum  samples  before,  during and after treatment,  and 
tumor  biopsies.  
4.4 Estimated  Duration of Subject  Participation  
 
Subjects  may be treated with avelumab for up to 24 months.  All subjects  will be followed  for 
survival  and assessed  every  2 months  as per Section 10 for up to 1 year following completion 
of avelumab or disease progression unless  the Principal Investigator  or Pfizer  elects  to end 
the study.  
 
5.1 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS  
 
5.2 SBRT 
 
SBRT  will be used to treat a designated lesion  that is symptomatic  or at risk of causing 
symptoms.  SBRT  will be performed  with external  beam  ionizing  radiation in accordance 
with institutional  standard practice.  3D conformal  radiation therapy  (3D-CRT),  intensity - 
modulated radiation therapy  (IMRT)  or volumetric  arc therapy  (VMAT)  will be used at the 
discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.  Total  SBRT  dose will be between 30 and 60 
Gy in < 8 fractions  as per standard  of care..  The dose must  satisfy  institutional guidelines  
and minimize  risk to adjacent  organs  at risk (see appendix  1 for   reference).  
 
5.3 Avelumab  
 
Avelumab  (also  known as MSB0010718C)  is a fully human  anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal  
antibody.  By inhibiting  PD-L1 interactions,  avelumab is thought  to enable the activation of 
T-cells and the adaptive  immune  system.  By retaining  a native Fc-region, avelumab is 
thought  to engage the innate immune  system  and may induce antibody -dependent  cell- 
mediated cytotoxicity  (ADCC).  Avelumab  has previously  received Breakthrough Therapy  
Designation for Merkel  cell carcinoma.  
 
Avelumab will be provided  by Pfizer.  Avelumab  will be stored,  prepared,  and administered as 
per MSKCC guidelines.  
The investigator  shall take responsibility  for and shall take all steps  to maintain  appropriate 
records  and ensure appropriate supply,  storage,  handling,  distribution and usage of 
investigational  p r o d u c t in  accordance with the protocol   and any applicable  laws and

9.1      Dosing  Instructions  and Schedule  
 
9.1.1     Avelumab Dosing Instructions and Schedule 
 
One cycle  of avelumab is definedas two weeks.  Administration  of avelumabw i l l commence  
after completion  of pre-treatment  procedures.  Patients  will receive  avelumab 10mg/kg  as an 
IV infusion  Q2W.  In order  to mitigate  infusion related reactions,  a premedication with an 
antihistamine  and with acetaminophen 30 to 60 minutes  prior to each dose  of avelumab is 
mandatory  (for example,  25-50 mg diphenhydramine and 500- 650 mg acetaminophen IV or 
oral).  The treating oncologist  may use equivalent  or similar  medications  as available  at their 
dis c r etion . 
 
Two cycles  will be given  before starting radiation therapy.  After 2 cycles  of avelumab,  a short  
course of SBRT  (after  the end of Cycle 2 and before Cycle  3, Day 1) will be delivered  to a 
portion of MPM  that is symptomatic  or at risk of causing  symptoms.  Avelumab  treatment  
continues  during and after RT for up to two years  or until disease progression.  Avelumab  may 
be continued after disease progression at the discretion of the investigator  if criteria  in section  
4.2 are met. 
 
The first day of dosing  is considered Day 1 of the cycle.  Day 1 of Cycle  1 is considered  the 
date of first dose and is used to determine  the maximum  24 months  of treatment. Trial 
treatment  should be administered  on Day 1 of each  cycle.  Trial treatment  may be 
administered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled Day 1 of each  cycle  due to 
administrative  reasons.  All trial treatments  will be administered  on an outpatient  basis.  
9.1.2    SBRT  Dosing  Instructions  and Schedule 
 
SBRT  will be administered after 2 cycles of avelumab are complete,  with fractionation and 
schedule at the discretion of the treating radiation  oncologist.  The radiation  dose and organ  
dose constraints  will be in accordance with standard institutional  guidelines  (see appendix  1). 
Avelumab  and SBRT  should not be delivered on the same day. SBRT  may be delayed up to 
6 weeks  for immunotherapy  toxicity  management.  If the patient  is unable  to receive radiation  
within  the 6 weeks,  they will be removed from protocol  and r eplac  ed . 
 
Patients  will be treated on an outpatient  basis.  Patients  will be evaluated by the radiation 
oncology  team  and then undergo simulation  for 3D-CRT,  IMRT,  or VMAT,  the choice of 
which  is determined by the radiation oncologist.  
 
Each  patient  will be positioned in a custom  immobilization  and undergo a CT scan  (slice  
spacing 2-2.5 mm, depending on the scanner)  for treatment    planning.  
 
The radiation oncologist will delineate the gross  tumor  volume  (GTV)  on the planning  
scan.  If clinically  indicated  for lesions  within  the chest,  only, the 4D-CT scan  will be used 
to account  for respiratory  motion.  
 
Target  volumes:  The definitions  of volumes  will be in accordance with the 1999 ICRU 
report  #62.

Definition  of the gross  tumor  volume  (GTV):  
The volume determined to clinically  correspond with the area require ing palliation  
will constitute the GTV.  
 
Definition  of the internal  target  volume   (ITV): 
For patients  who undergo  4DCT  simulation,  only: an ITV will be created based  on the 4D- 
CT scan  to account for all respiratory  motion throughout  the respiratory  cycle,  thus 
resulting in a motion-inclusive  ITV. 
 
Definition  of the clinical target  volume (CTV):  
The CTV will be defined  as the ITV plus typically  0.2cm  to account  for microscopic tumor  
extension.  
 
Definition  of the planning target  volume  (PTV):  
The PTV will include the CTV plus a margin of 0.5 cm to account  for setup  uncertainties.  
 
Critical  normal  tissues  in proximity  to the irradiated  lesion  will be contoured.  
Hypofractionated  guidelines  based on current  MSKCC guidelines  will be applied (see 
appendix  1). 
 
Isocenter  is at the center  of the GTV.  Treatment  is delivered with 6 or 15 MV photon  
beams.  IMRT/VMAT  will use the dynamic  multileaf  collimator  (DMLC  or sliding  window)  
technique,  on a Varian LINAC.  The IMRT  optimization  algorithm  uses an iterative  gradient  
search method  to minimize  a quadratic  objective function that can include  terms  to impose  
target  dose uniformity,  limit normal  tissue  maximum and mean  doses  and impose  dose-  
volume  constraints.  Calculations  are performed on a commercial  treatment  planning 
system  using the analytic  anisotropic  algorithm  (AAA)  or Acuros  algorithm  (Varian 
EclipseTM). 
 
Radiation  will be given outpatient  Monday  to Friday,  excluding holidays,  until all (< 8) 
treatments  have been completed.  If the patient  misses a scheduled  treatment, this 
treatment  will be added on the end of the initial treatment  plan. Each  treatment  day, the 
patient  will be positioned supine  on the treatment  table with custom    immobilization.  
Patients  are first positioned with the use of skin tattoos  and an in-room  laser  localization  
system.  Patients  will then undergo  a cone- beam  CT prior to each fraction.  Refinements  in 
patient  positioning are made based on the on-board  3D imaging.  Patients  will be matched  
based  on the tumor  within  a 2mm  tolerance,  which  will be approved  by the attending 
radiation oncologist.  The radiation treatment  will then be administered. All patients  will be 
monitored  for gross  body movement  using intra- fraction motion such  as infrared,  Align RT 
or interval  KV bone match.  
 
 
9.2 Monitoring of Dose  Administration  
 
Subjects  will be monitored  during avelumab administration  and for a minimum  of 2 hours  after 
infusion  with assessment  of vital signs.  Subjects  will be monitored  during avelumab 
administration and for a minimum  of 30 minutes  after infusion with assessment  of vital signs  
if there  are no infusion  related reactions  within  the first 8 cycles.  As with any antibody,  
allergic  reactions  to dose  administration  are possible.  Appropriate  drugs  and medical  
equipment  to treat acute anaphylactic  reactions  must  be immediately  available,  and s t u d y 
personnel  m u s t be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis.  The study  site must  have 
immediate access    to

emergency  resuscitation teams  and equipment  in addition  to the ability  to admit  subjects  to 
an intensive care unit if  necessary.  
 
Avelumabshould be administered in a settingthat allows for immediateaccess toan intensive 
care unit or equivalent  environment  and administration of therapy  for anaphylaxis,  such  as 
the ability  to implement  immediate resuscitation measures.  Steroids  (dexamethasone 10 mg), 
epinephrine (1:1,000 dilution),  allergy  medications  (IV antihistamines),  bronchodilators,  or 
equivalents  at the treating oncologist ’s discretion,  and oxygen should be available for 
immediate access.  
9.3 Concomitant  Medications  
 
9.3.1 Permitted  Concomitant  Medications  
 
Investigators  may prescribe concomitant  medications  or treatments  (e.g.,  acetaminophen,  
diphenhydramine)  deemed  necessary  to provide adequate  prophylactic  or supportive care 
except  for those medications  identified  as “excluded”  as listed  in Section   9.3.2.  
 
9.3.2 Excluded Concomitant   Medications 
 
Subjects must be instructed not to take any medications, includingover-the-counter products, 
without  first consulting with the investigator.  
 
The following medications  are considered exclusionary  during the study.  The Principal  
Investigator  must  be notified if a subject  receives  any of these during the   study.  
• Any investigational   anticancer  therapy.  
• Any concurrent  chemotherapy,  immunotherapy,  or biologic  therapy.  Concurrent  use of

9.4 Dose  Modification  and Discontinuation  
 
9.4.1 Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) Requiring Avelumab Discont inuation or 
Dose Modification  
 
Any Grade 4 ADRs  require treatment  discontinuation with avelumab except  for single 
laboratory  values  out of normal  range that are unlikely  related to study  treatment  as assessed  
by the investigator,  do not have any clinical correlate,  and resolve within  7 days with adequate  
medical   management.

Any Grade  3 ADRs  require treatment  discontinuation with avelumab except  for any of the 
following:  
 
• Transient  (≤ 6 hours)  Grade  3 flu-like symptoms  or fever,  which  are controlled with 
medical   management  
• Transient  (≤ 24 hours)  Grade 3 fatigue,  local reactions,  headache,  nausea,  emesis  that 
resolves  to Grade  ≤ 1 
• Single  laboratory  values  out of normal  range (excluding  Grade ≥ 3 liver function  test 
increase)  that are unlikely  related to study  treatment  according to the Investigator, do 
not have any clinical correlate,  and resolve  to Grade  ≤ 1 within  7 days with adequate  
medical  management  
• Tumor  flare phenomenon  defined  as local pain, irritation,  or rash localized  at sites of 
known or suspected tumor  
Any Grade 2 ADR should be managed as follows:  
 
• If a Grade  2 ADR resolves  to Grade  ≤ 1 by the last day of the current  cycle,  
treatment  may continue.  
• If a Grade  2 ADR does not resolve  to Grade  ≤ 1 by the last day of the current  cycle,  
infusions  should  not be given on the following  cycle.  If at the end of the following  
cycle  the event  has not resolved  to Grade  1, the subject  should permanently  
discontinue treatment  with avelumab (except  for hormone  insufficiencies, that can 
be managed by replacement  therapy;  for these hormone  insufficiencies,  up to 2 
subsequent  doses  may be  omitted).  
• Upon the second occurrence  of the same Grade  2 ADR (except  for hormone  
insufficiencies  that can be managed by replacement  therapy)  in the same  subject,  
treatment  with avelumab will be permanently  discontinued.

9.4.2 Treatment Modification  for Symptoms  of Infusion- Related Reactions 
 
NCI-CTCAE   Grade  Treatment  Modification  for Study  Drug  
Grade  1 – mild 
Mild transient  reaction;  infusion interruption  not 
indicated;  intervention not indicated.  Decrease  the study  drug infusion  rate by 50% and 
monitor  closelyfor  any worsening.  
Grade  2 – moderate  
Therapy  or infusion interruption indicated  but 
responds  promptlyto symptomatic  treatment  (for 
example,  antihistamines,  NSAIDs,  narcotics,  IV 
fluids);  prophylactic  medications  indicated for ≤ 
24 hrs. Stop study  drug infusion.  
Resume  infusion at 50% of previous  rate once  
infusion- related reaction has resolved or 
decreased to at least  Grade 1 in severity and 
monitor  closelyfor  any worsening.  
Grade  3 or Grade  4 – severe  or 
life-threatening  
Grade 3: Prolonged  (for example,  not rapidly  
responsive to symptomatic medication and/or  
brief interruption of infusion);  recurrence of 
symptoms following  initial improvement;  
hospitalization indicated for clinical  sequelae.  
Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences;  urgent  
intervention indicated.  Stop the study  drug infusion immediatelyand  
disconnect  infusion tubing from the subject.  
Subjects  have to be withdrawn  immediatelyfrom  
study  drug treatment  and must  not receive any 
further  study  drug treatment.  
- Once the avelumab  infusion rate has been decreased by50%  or interrupted due to an 
infusion- related reaction,  it must  remain  decreased  for all subsequent  infusions.  
- If hypersensitivityreaction  occurs,  the subject  must  be treated according to the best available 
medical  practice.  
IV = intravenous;  NCI-CTCAE  = National  Cancer  Institute -Common  TerminologyCriteria for Adverse 
Event;  NSAIDs  = nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatorydrugs.  
 
 
Additional Modifications for Patients with Grade 2 Avelumab Infusion-Related 
Reactions:  In the event  of a Grade  2 infusion -related reaction  that does not improve  or 
worsens  after implementation of the modifications  indicated in Section  9.4.2 (including  
reducing  the infusion rate by 50%),  the investigator  may consider  treatment  with 
corticosteroids,  and the infusion  should  not be resumed for that cycle.  At the next cycle,  the 
investigator  may consider  the addition  of H2-blocker  antihistamines  (e.g., famotidine or 
ranitidine),  meperidine,  or ibuprofen  to the mandatory  premedications.  Prophylactic  steroids  
are NOT permitted.  
Management  of Avelumab-related Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions and Flu-like 
Symptoms:  Many  mAb therapies  can induce  flu-like symptoms  and hypersensitivity  
reactions,  including impaired  airway,  decreased oxygen saturation (<92%),  confusion,  
lethargy,  hypotension, pale/clammy  skin, and cyanosis.  Avelumab should be administered   in 
a setting  that allows  for immediate access  to an intensive care unit or equivalent   environment  
if required.  Patients  should be placed  on monitors  immediately  and epinephrine injections  and 
dexamethasone infusions  should  be available for immediate access.  
 
For prophylaxis  of flu-like symptoms,  25 mg indomethacin or comparable nonsteroidal  anti- 
inflammatory  drugs  (NSAID) dose (e.g.,  ibuprofen 600 mg, naproxen sodium  500    mg)

may be administered at the investigator ’s discretion  2 hours  before and 8 hours  after the start 
of each dose of avelumab IV infusion.   Alternative  treatments  for fever  (e.g.,  paracetamol  or 
ibuprofen)  and rigors  (e.g.,  meperidine)  may be given to patients  at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
 
9.5 Management  of Avelumab  Immune -Related  Adverse  Events  
 
 
Since  inhibition  of PD-L1 stimulates  the immune  system,  immune -related AEs (irAEs) may occur.  
Treatment  of irAEs  is mainlydependent  upon severity  (NCI-CTC AE grade):  
 
Grade 1 to 2: treat symptomaticallyor  with moderate dose steroids,  more  frequent  monitoring 
Grade 1 to 2 (persistent):  manage similar  to high grade AE (Grade 3 to 4) 
Grade 3 to 4: treat with high dose  corticosteroids  
 
Treatment  of gastrointestinal,  dermatological,  pulmonary,  hepatic  and endocrine irAEs  should follow  
guidelines  set forth in the table below.

11.1 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
Expected toxicities  from SBRT  are highly  dependent  on location  of the radiated lesion.  Some  
of these  toxicities  may include  fatigue,  dermatitis,  pneumonitis,  esophagitis,  chest  wall pain, 
nausea,  vomiting.  In very rare cases,  patients  may experience b r a c h i a l plexopathy,  
myelitis,  bronchial  damage,  vascular  damage,  pericarditis,  and/or     hepatitis.  
 
Primary  toxicities  of concern  include  radiation pneumonitis.  Grade  2 and 3 pulmonary  toxicity  
may be observed in 10% and 3% of patients,  respectively.  Other  grade 2 –4 toxicities  included 
chest  wall pain in 20%,  fatigue in 15-20%,  esophagitis  in  5-10%,   and skin toxicity  in 5-10% 
of patients.  Inferior  thoracic  lesions  may have an increased risk of liver, bowel,  and kidney  
injury.  
Possible  short  and long-term toxicities  from avelumab include thyroid dysfunction  requiring 
thyroid hormone replacement,  adrenal  crisis,  liver function test abnormalities,  pneumonitis,  
rash,  diarrhea,  and colitis.  In a Phase  1b study  of avelumab in patients  with mesothelioma,  
treatment -related  adverse events  occurred in 41 of 53 patients  (77.4%). The most  common  
(>10%)  were infusion- related  reactions  (20 [37.7%]),  fatigue  (8 [15.1%]),  chills  (8 [15.1%]),  
and pyrexia  (6 [11.3%]),  all of which  were grades  1/2. Grade ≥ 3 treatment -  related  
adverse  events  occurred in 4 patients  (7.5%).  This included colitis,  decreased  
lymphocytes, and increased GGT or CPK.  There were no  treatment -related 
deaths.  
11.2 Safety  Monitoring  
 
Subjects  will be evaluated  for occurrence of AEs at each visit. Events  will be characterized 
and reported as described below.  Safety  will also be monitored  by performing physical  
exams  and routine laboratory  procedures.  
 
Extended  safety  follow- up: 
 
o Given  the potential  risk for delayed immune -related  toxicities,  safety  follow- up must  
be performed  up to 90 days after the last dose of avelumab   administration.  
o The extended safety  follow -up beyond 30 days after last study  drug administration  
may be performed either  via a site visit or via a telephone call with subsequent  site 
visit requested in case  any concerns  noted during the telephone   call. 
 
These visits  are included in section  10.0 
 
11.1.1 A d v e r s e Events and Serious Adverse Events 
 
Definitions  of AEs, non-serious  AEs, and serious  adverse events  (SAEs),  as well as 
reporting guidelines  are provided below.  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 17- 358 A(7)  
Approval date: 25 -Feb-2022

Definition of Adverse Event and Non-Serious Adverse Event 
 
The following  definition of AE will be used for the study:  “any untoward medical  occurrence  in 
a subject  or clinical investigation subject  administered a pharmaceutical  product  and which  
does not necessarily  have to have a causal  relationship  with this treatment.  An adverse event  
can therefore be any unfavorable  and unintended sign (including  an abnormal  laboratory  
finding),  symptom,  or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal  
(investigational)  product,  whether  or not related to medicinal  (investigational)  product.”  This 
definition  includes  any abnormalities  or anomalies  that were not seen at baseline or which  
worsened during the course of the study,  if present  at   baseline.  
 
A “non- serious”  adverse  event  is any event  that does not meet  the definition of “serious  
adverse event”  as presented,  below.  
Reporting and Treating  Non-Serious  Events  
 
It is the responsibility  of the investigator  to perform  regular  assessments  for AEs. Subjects  willl 
be regularly  queried about  the occurrence of any AEs and w i l l be monitored  throughout  the 
study  for reactions  to study  drug and/or  study  procedures.  The investigator  and clinical staff 
will record all AEs, whether  volunteered  by or elicited  from the subject,  at any time during a 
subject ’s participation in the study.  Abnormal  laboratory  findings  (e.g.,  hematology,  
comprehensive  metabolic  panel)  or other  abnormal  assessments  (e.g.,  vital signs)  will be 
recorded as AEs if they are judged as clinically  significant  by the  investigator.  
 
All subjects  experiencing  an AE will be evaluated  by the investigator  and monitored  until 
resolution of the events  or until the investigator  deems  the event  clinically  stable  and/or  at an 
acceptable  level.  Unless  the event  requires  hospitalization (SAE),  medical  treatment  will be 
provided  to the subjects  at the unit and treatment  medication and/or  medical  procedures  will 
be provided per the treating- investigator  “s clinical discretion.  All clinically  significant  AEs, 
including clinically  significant  laboratory  abnormalities,  will be followed   until resolution.  AEs 
meeting  the definition of SAEs  require special  reporting in addition to documentation  in the 
CRDB as described below.  
All AEs, including  clinically  significant  laboratory  and assessment  abnormalities  will be 
recorded according to “Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse Events”  V4.0 (CTCAE)  and 
must  be recorded in the CRDB.  Events  occurring  prior to initiation  of first dose should be 
recorded on the Medical  History  page of the CRDB.  Any AE occurring after initiation  of first dose  
of study  drug should  be recorded on the Adverse  Event  page of the CRDB.  AEs should be 
recorded in the CRDB  using the medical  terminology  found in the source  documentation.  
Whenever  possible,  diagnoses  should be given when  signs  and s y m p t o m s are due to a 
common  etiology.  
 
It is the investigator’s  responsibility  to provide  his/her  assessment  of the relationship  of the 
event  to the study  drug and the severity  of the event  using the following  scales:  
 
• Relationship  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 17- 358 A(7)  
Approval date: 25 -Feb-2022  
Page  39  of

o Unrelated:  The AE is clearly  attributable  to a concurrent  illness,  concurrent  
medication,  clinical  state,  or environmental  factor  other  than the investigative  
agent.  
o Unlikely:  The occurrence of the AE does not follow the study  in a temporal  
sequence and/or  based  upon  available subject  information,  e.g., medical  history,  
disease process,  known pharmacology  of drug,  a relationship  between the drug 
and AE is u n l i k e l y . 
o Possible:  The AE follows  a reasonable temporal  sequence from the time of 
study  drug administration,  but it is possible that other  factors;  e.g., subject ’s 
clinical state or concomitant  mediations,  environmental  factors,  or the drug’s 
pharmacology,  may have caused  the AE . 
o Probable:  The AE follows  a reasonable temporal  sequence from the time of 
study  drug administration,  follows  a known response pattern  of  the medication 
class,  and cannot  be reasonably  explained  by other  fac tor s . 
o Definite:  The AE follows  a reasonable temporal  sequence from the time of study  
drug administration,  follows  a known response pattern of the medication class,  
is a commonly  associated AE, and is certainly  explained by the study  
intervention.  
 
• Severity  
 
The severity of all adverse events  should  be graded according to the Common Terminology  
Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  V4.0.  For those adverse events  not listed  in the CTCAE,  
the following grading system  should be e m p l o y e d : 
 
o Mild (CTCAE Grade 1): Transient  symptoms,  awareness  of sign/symptom,  but 
easily  tolerated and no interference with subject’s  daily activities  
o Moderate (CTCAE Grade 2): Marked signs/symptoms that interfere with 
subject’s  usual  activities,  but still  acceptable  
o Severe (CTCAE  Grade  3): Incapacitating signs/symptoms  which  cause  
considerable interference with the subject’s  daily activities,  unac  c eptab le  
o Life-threatening  (CTCAE  Grade  4): Life-threatening  or disabling AE  
o Death (CTCAE  Grade  5): Death- related  AE. 
Definition  of Serious  Adverse Event  
The following  definition of SAE applies  for the study:  “a serious  AE means  any AE occurring  
at any dose that results  in any of the following  outcomes:  death,  a life- threatening  AE, 
inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing  hospitalization,  a persistent  or significant  
disability/incapacity,  a congenital  anomaly/birth defect,  or overdose of study  drug.  Important  
medical  events  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or require hospitalization may 
be considered a serious  AE when,  based upon  appropriate medical  judgment,  they may 
jeopardize the subject,  or the subject  may require  medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent  
one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition.  A life-threatening AE is any AE that places  the 
subject,  in the view of the investigator,  at immediate  risk of death  from the reaction  as it 
occurred  (e.g.,  it does not include  a    reaction

that, had it occurred  in a more  severe form,  might  have caused  death).”   Refer  to    section 
17.2 for “Reporting and Treating Serious  Adverse Events.”  
Pregnancies  
Although pregnancy  and lactation  are not considered adverse  events,  it is  the responsibility  
of investigators  or their designees  to report  any pregnancy  or lactation in a subject  
(spontaneously  reported to them),  including the pregnancy  of a male  subject's  female  partner  
that occurs  during the trial or within  120 days of completing the trial, or 30 days following  
cessation of treatment  if the subject  initiates  new anticancer  therapy,  whichever  is earlier.  All 
subjects and femalepartners of male subjects who becomepregnant  must be followed to the 
completion/termination of the pregnancy.  Pregnancy  outcomes  of spontaneous  abortion,  
missed  abortion,  benign  hydatidiform  mole,  blighted ovum,  fetal death,  intrauterine death,  
miscarriage and stillbirth  must  be reported as serious  events  (Important  Medical  Events).  If 
the pregnancy  continues  to term,  the outcome (health of infant)  must  also be reported.  Such  
events  must  be reported within  5 calendar  days to the MSKCC Safety  Office  and within  2 
working  days to Pfizer  Safety  (Pfizer U.S. Clinical Trial Department,  Fax 1-866-997-8322,  OR  
USA.AEReporting@pfizer.com  specifying Protocol,  Subject,  Site/PI,  and   SAE/Onset).  
 
 
 
12.0 CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
For the purposes  of this study,  patients  will be evaluated for response every  2 months  after 
completing  SBRT  (approximately  8 weeks,  or every  4 cycles).  Modified  RECIST  for 
mesothelioma and RECIST  1.1 criteria  will be used [22]. CT scan  of the chest,  abdomen,  and 
pelvis  will be used  for response assessment.  The companion CT from an integrated PET/CT  
examination is suitable  for this requirement.  As part of the secondary  endpoints,  progression-  
free and overall  survival  will be recorded.  Progression- free survival  is defined as the length of 
time from the start of active  treatment  (avelumab)  until removal  from study  due to progressive  
disease (defined by modified  RECIST  1.1) or death.  Removal  from study  due to toxicity  will 
be counted  as censoring.  Overall  survival  is defined  as the length  of time from the start of 
active  treatment  until d e a t h . 
Modified  RECIST  for Mesothelioma  [23, 24] 
 
The modified RECIST criteria  for mesothelioma use unidimensional  measurements  of tumor  
thickness  perpendicular  to the chest  wall or mediastinum.  In our protocol,  the irradiated lesion  
is not required to be intrathoracic.  This is measured on CT scan  in 2 sites   at 3 different  levels  
at least 1cm apart.  At reassessment,  the thickness  must  be measured  at the same position and 
level.  Exhaustive documentation of non-measurable lesions  are not required.  The sum of 
tumor  diameters  is used to measure   response.  
 
Definitions  of Overall  Response  
Complete  Response (CR)  Disappearance  of all target  lesions  who no evidence  of 
tumor  elsewhere.

Complete  Response (CR)  Disappearance  of all target  lesions  Any pathological  lymph  
nodes  (whether  target  or non-target)  must  have reduction  in 
short  axis to <10 mm. 
Partial  Response  (PR) At least a 30% decrease  in the sum of diameters  of target  
lesions,  taking  as reference  the baseline  sum diameters.  
Stable  Disease  (SD) Neither  sufficient  shrinkage  to qualify  for PR nor sufficient  
increase  to qualify  for PD, taking  as reference  the smallest  
sum of diameters  while  on study.  
Progressive  Disease (PD) At least a 20% increase  in the sum of diameters  of target  
lesions,  taking as reference the smallest  sum on study  (this 
includes  the baseline sum if that is the smallest  on study).  
In addition  to the relative  increase of 20%,  the sum must  
also demonstrate  an absolute increase  of at least 5 mm. 
(Note:  the appearance of one or more  new lesions  is also 
considered  progression).  
 
 
Evaluation  of non-target  lesions  
Complete  Response (CR)  Disappearance  of all non-target  lesions  and normalization  
of tumor  marker  level.  All lymph  nodes  must  be non- 
pathological  in size (<10mm  short  axis).  
Non-CR/Non -PD Neither  sufficient  shrinkage  to qualify  for PR nor sufficient  
increase  to qualify  for PD, taking  as reference  the smallest  
sum of diameters  while  on study.  
Progressive  Disease (PD) Unequivocal  progression  (see comments  below)  of existing  
non-target  lesions.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more  
new lesions  is also considered  progression).

13.1 CRITERIAFOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
Patients  should permanently discontinue treatment  with avelumab for the reasons  
enumerated in Section 9 or in the event  of: 
• Intolerable adverse events  (e.g. CTCAE  v4.0 grade 3 or 4) that cannot  be 
managed by dose modification  or delay  
• Further  dose modification  or delay  considered necessary  but not allowed  per 
protocol  section  9.4 
• Pregnancy1
 
• Withdrawal  of informed consent2 
• If the treating physician  determines  that it is in the best interest  of the patient  to 
stop study  drug 
• Non-compliance  with the defined  treatment  plan 
 
Patients  will be removed  from study after treatment  ends in the event    of: 
• Death  
• Pregnancy1 
• Withdrawal  of informed consent2 
• Non-compliance  with the defined follow up studies  
 
1Pregnancy:  In case  of a patient  or the patient’s  partner becoming pregnant  during the 
trial the investigational  drug has to be immediately  stopped and the patients  must  be 
followed- up until birth or other  termination  of the pregnancy.  Repeat  counseling on birth 
defect  risk must  be offered.  
2Consent  withdrawal:  in case  a patient  withdraws  his/her  consent  for taking  drug,  it is of 
utmost  importance for the robustness  and integrity  of the trial results  that his/her  safety  
data are recorded until the end of the 52 weeks  period.  Thus,  all patients  will be asked to 
follow  their visit schedule until 52 weeks.  
Patients  who discontinue from this trial are not allowed  to be reenrolled in this trial. 
Patients  who discontinue  medication  within  the first two weeks  (during the washout period)  
will be replaced.  For the patients  who stopped  trial before enrollment,  their data will be 
part of the description of the screening population.

The primary  endpoint,  the safety  of a combination  of avelumab and SBRT,  will be defined based on 
the rate of any grade 3 or higher  non-hematologic  toxicity within  the first 3 months  after SBRT  (for the 
rest of the section  this will be referred  to as AE). A two-stage stopping rule will be used  to protect  
patients‟  safety.  If 3 or more  among the first 13 patients  develop AEs, then the trial will be stopped  and 
declared  unsafe.  Otherwise,  an additional  14 patients  will be enrolled  and treated.  If, among  the total 27 
patients,  5 or more  patients  are observed to have AEs, then the trial will also be declared unsafe.  This 
stopping  rule has a power  of 80% declaring  the true AE rate of 0.1 or lower  safe,  and a type 1 error rate 
(alpha)  of 5% declaring true AE rate of 0.3 or higher  safe.  
For secondary  endpoints,  the overall  response and the irradiated lesion  and non-irradiated  
lesion  response rates  (4 months  from start date of the combined therapy)  based  on RECIST  
1.1  response  criteria   will  be  summarized  by  sample   proportions   and  their  confidence 
intervals.  PFS and OS will be evaluated by Kaplan -Meier   method.  
 
For the exploratory  objectives,  we will evaluate changes  of T-cell infiltration  and serum  
immunophenotype at baseline and after SBRT  + immunotherapy  both in- and outside  the 
irradiated  field. The former  is measured as numerical  values  so we will use Wilcoxonsigned - 
rank test. The latter  is categorical  so we will tabulate it and employ  the marginal  homogeneity  
test. Due to the expected small  sample  size, results  will be interpreted cautiously.  The 
imaging  studies  using DWI-MRI and DCE- MRI, and FDG-PET will be correlated with biopsy  
results  by McNemar ’s tests .

16.1 DAT A M ANAGEMENT ISSUES 
 
A Clinical  Research  Coordinator  (CRC)  will be assigned to the study.  The responsibilities  
of the CRC include  project  compliance,  data collection,  abstraction and entry,  data 
reporting,  regulatory  monitoring,  problem  resolution and prioritization,  and coordinate  the 
activities  of the protocol  study  team.  
 
The data collected for this study  will be entered into a secured database (Medidata Rave)  
at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering Cancer  Center.  Source  documentation will be available  to 
support  the computerized  patient  record.  
16.2 Quality  Assurance 
 
Routine data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  data and inconsistencies.  
Accrual  rates  and extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow -up will be monitored  
periodically  throughout  the study  period and potential  problems  will be brought  to the 
attention of the study  team  for discussion  and action.  Random -sample data quality  and 
protocol  compliance audits  may be conducted by the study  team,  at a minimum  of two 
times per year,  or more  frequently  if i n d i c a t e d . 
16.3 Data and Safety  Monitoring 
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring Plan utilized  for this study  must  align with the MSK DSM  Plan 
where applicable.  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring (DSM) Plans  at Memorial  Sloan  Kettering were  approved by 
the National  Cancer  Institute  in August  2018.  The plans  address  the new policies  set forth by 
the NCI in the document  entitled  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  Institute  for Data and Safety   
Monitoring of Clinical  Trials. ” 
 
There are several  different  mechanisms  by which  clinical studies  are monitored  for data safety  
and quality.  At a departmental/PI  level,  there  exist procedures  for quality  control  by the 
research  team(s). Institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance include  protocol  
monitoring,  complianceand data verification  audits,  staff education on clinical research  QA, 
and two institutional  committees  that are responsible for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical 
trials programs.  The committees:  Data and Safety  Monitoring Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I 
and II clinical trials,  and the Data and Safety  Monitoring Board  (DSMB)  for Phase III clinical  
trials,  report  to the Deputy  Physician -in-Chief  of Clinical  Research.  
 
The degree of monitoring required will be determined based on level of risk and documented.  
 
The MSK DSMB monitors  phase  III trials and the DSMC monitors  non-phase III trials.  The 
DSMB/C have oversight  over the following  trials:  
 
· MSK Investigator -Initiated  Trials  (IITs; MSK as sponsor)  
 
· External  studies  where  MSK is the data coordinating center  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

Approval date: 25 -Feb-2022  
Page  45  of 
51  
 · Low risk studies  identified  as requiring DSMB/C review  
 
The DSMC will initiate  review following  the enrollment  of the first participant,  or by the end of 
the year one if no accruals,  and will continue for the study  lifecycle  until there  are no 
participants  under active  therapy  and the protocol  has closed to accrual.  The DSMB will 
initiate  review  once the protocol  is open  to accrual.

17.1 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
 
Participation  in this trial is voluntary.  All patients  will be required to sign a statement  of 
informed  consent,  which  must  conform  to IRB guidelines.  
Inclusion of Women and Minorities:  Memorial  Sloan -Kettering Cancer  Center  has filed forms  
HHS 441 (civil rights),  HHS (handicapped individual),  639-A (sex discrimination),  and 680 
(age discrimination);  we also take due notice  of the NIH policy  concerning inclusion  of 
women  and minorities  in clinical research  populations.  Patients  of all races,  both male  and 
female,  will be accepted into the protocol.  The proposed  study  population  is as described.  
 
Exclusion  of Lactating or Pregnant  Women:  Lactating and pregnant  women are also 
excluded because of unknown effects  of immunotherapy  on a developing  fetus or nursing 
infant.  
Children  have been  excluded from this study  as mesothelioma is an adult cancer.  Thus,  the 
relevance of this drug to the pediatric  population  has not been   established.  
Benefits:  It is possible that this treatment  will result  in shrinkage of mesothelioma or in a 
stabilization  of an otherwise progressing disease.  It is not known,  of course,  whether  these or 
any other  favorable  events  will occur.  It is not known  whether  this treatment  will affect  the 
overall  survival  of the patients.  
Costs:  The patient  will be responsible  for the costs  of standard  medical  care,  including,  CT 
scans,  all drug administration  fees and all hospitalizations,  as well as for complications  of 
treatment.  Avelumab will be supplied to patients  by Pfizer  at no cost.  Patients  will not be 
responsible for the costs  of blood  procurement  obtained for research  purposes,  the cost of 
special  testing  of any tissue  for research  purposes,  or the cost for obtaining  the tumor  biopsy  
for research  purposes.  
 
Incentives:  No incentives  will be offered  to patients/subjects  for participation  in the   study.  
 
Alternatives:  Patients  may be eligible  for other  investigational  studies  or focus  on palliative  
care options.  
 
Confidentiality: Every  effort  will be made to maintain patient  confidentiality.  Research  and 
hospital  records  are confidential. Patient’s  name or any other  personally  identifying 
information will not be used in reports  or publications  resulting from this study.  The Food and 
Drug  Administration or other  authorized agencies  (e.g., qualified  monitors) may review  
patients ‟ records  and pathology  slides,  as required.  
17.2 Privacy 
 
MSK‟s  Privacy Office  may allow the use and disclosure  of protected  health  information 
pursuant  to a completed and signed Research Authorization  form.  The use and disclosure  of

17.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
An adverse  event  is considered serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life-threatening adverse event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation  of existing  
hospitalization  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious  when,  based  upon medical  judgment,  they may 
jeopardize the patient  or participant  and may require medical  or surgical  intervention to 
prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
• List any additional  events  that require SAE reporting (pregnancy,  AEs of special  interest  
(AESI),  secondary  malignancies,  etc.) 
 
Note: Hospital admission  for a planned procedure/disease treatment  is not considered an SAE.  
 
SAE reporting is required  as soon as the participant  starts  investigational  treatment/intervention.  
SAE reporting is required  for 30 days after the participant’s  last investigational  
treatment/intervention.  Any event  that occurs  after the 30-day period that is unexpected and at 
least possibly  related to protocol  treatment  must  be reported.  
 
Please note:  Any SAE that occurs  prior to the start of investigational  treatment/intervention and is 
related to a screening test or procedure  (e.g.,  a screening biopsy)  must  be reported.  
 
All SAEs  must  be submitted in PIMS.  If an SAE requires  submission to the HRPP  Office  per IRB    
SOP RR-408 ‘Reporting  of Serious  Adverse Events ,’ the SAE report  must  be submitted within  5 
calendar  days of the event.  All other  SAEs  must  be submitted  within  30 calendar  days of the 
event.  
 
The report  should  contain the following  information:  
 
• The date the adverse event  occurred  
• The adverse  event  
• The grade of the event  
• Relationship of the adverse  event  to the treatment(s)  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 • If the AE was expected  
• Detailed  text that includes  the following  
o An explanation of how the AE was handled  
o A description  of the participant’s  condition  
o Indication  if the participant  remains  on the study  
• If an amendment  will need to be made  to the protocol  and/or  consent  form 
• If the SAE is an Unanticipated Problem  
 
For IND/IDE protocols:  The SAE report  should be completed as per above instructions.  If 
appropriate,  the report  will be forwarded to the FDA by the IND Office. 
 
For multicenter  trials where  MSK is the data coordinating center,  please  refer to the MSK 
Multicenter  Trial Addendum.  All required SAE reporting to the funders  and/or  drug suppliers  will 
be completed by MSK only. 
 
 
17.3.1  SAE Reporting to Study Sponsor  / Drug  Supplier  
The following  reportable events  must  be submitted to Pfizer  within  24 hours  (or immediately  for 
death  or life-threatening  events)  using the provided Investigator -Initiated  Research Serious  
Adverse Event  Form  (IIR SAE)  with the Pfizer  Reportable Events  Fax Cover  Sheet  with each

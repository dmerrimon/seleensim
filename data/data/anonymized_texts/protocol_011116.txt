Version date: 2-2-22 3 1.0 SUMMARY  
 
Background:  It has been widely recognized that severe disease from SARS -CoV -2 infection has been attributed 
to a substantial dysregulation of the immune system leading to significant respiratory compromise, end organ 
damage and death (1). Central to this immune response are certain cytokines, specifically those that activate the 
Type 2 (Th 2) pathway of inflammation, which have been associated with severe disease in COVID -19 (2,3) . 
Interleukin -13 (IL -13) has been identified as a key driver in respiratory compromise leading to ventilation in 
patients with COVID -19 and, when neutralized in mice, has shown reduced disease severity. Dupilumab, an 
inhibitor of IL -13 and IL -4 used curren tly in treatment of atopic disease, has also been associated with reduced 
disease severity when observing outcomes of those diagnosed with COVID -19 who are concomitantly prescribed 
dupilumab (2). This therefore raises the possibility of successful use of dupilumab for treatment of COVID -19 
infection and moreover provides an avenue for more targeted anti -inflammatory therapy in these patients.  
 
Clinical Experience:  Dupilumab, an anti -interleukin -4 receptor -α monoclonal antibody, leading to blockage of 
IL-4 and IL -13 signaling , has been FDA approved for treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis since 
2017. It has been successfully shown to reduce disease severity in not only those with atopic dermatitis but in 
other allergic diseases where Th 2 cytokines have been implicated, including asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis (4). 
Original clinical trials noted excellent safety profiles in addition to favorability in its use when considering the 
negative impacts of long term steroid use in these patients (5,6) .  
Dupilumab therapy for asthma is associated with eosinophilia, with the highest incidence at 16 -20 weeks after the 
initiation of therapy, and in approximately 4% of patients, of which only 0.3% were symptomatic (7). Preliminary 
analysis of COVID -19 hospitalization data at our institution showed an increase in eosinophil counts in patients 
throughout their admission. Although an overall favorable drug safety profile, the association of eosinophilia with 
dupilumab use i n addition to its association with severe COVID -19 infection raises concern for an additive effect 
with both exposures and potential subsequent clinical repercussions. It is therefore important that safety is also 
evaluated  in addition to clinical effica cy of dupilumab use in those hospitalized with COVID -19 in this 
randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, superiority phase IIa trial .

3.0 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
3.1 Background and Scientific Rationale  
It has been widely recognized that severe disease from SARS -CoV -2 infection has been attributed to a substantial 
dysregulation of the immune system leading to significant respiratory compromise, end organ damage and death 
(1). This has been further exemplified through finding a reduction in mortality of COVID -19 patients requiring 
oxygen with use of dexamethasone when compared to patients not receiving steroids (11). Central to this 
inflammatory process are cytokines, including interleukin -6 (IL -6), which have led to clinical trials investigating 
their blockade in severe COVID -19 infection (12). However, due to the significant heterogeneity of cytokine 
elevations seen in SARS -CoV -2 infection, it has been difficult to identify specific targets for intervention that are 
associated with and can provide clinical benefit for patients with COVID -19 (12–14). Nevertheless some studies 
have implicated type 2 (Th 2) cytokines in severe disease (3). 
 
Elevated interleukin -13 (IL -13), a Th 2 cytokine, has been shown to be  a central component of the immune 
response leading to ventilation in patients with SARS -CoV -2 infection. This was validated in two separate patient 
cohorts from University of Virginia and Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center, and is consistent 
with findings of Lucas et al. in demonstrating an association of IL -13 with severe COVID -19 disease (2,3) . 
Furthermore, Lucas et al. show increasing levels of IL -13 through the course of disease, with elevations out to day 
25 of illness (3).  IL-13 is known to be involved in eosinophilic inflammation, mucous secretion, goblet cell 
metaplasia and fibrosis, and has been regularly implicated in airway hyperresponsiveness and atopic disease (15). 
Inhibition of IL -13 in a K18 - hACE2 transgenic  mouse model led to improved clinical scores and reduced weight 
loss when infected with SARS -CoV -2. RNAseq analysis of mice infected with SARS -CoV -2 further found 
elevations in type 2 associated genes (2). Hyaluronan, a pulmonary glycosaminoglycan whose low molecular 
weight form is proinflammatory and implicated in numerous other lung pathologies, was identified as a driver of 
pulmonary disease in COVID -19 patients and, additionally, as a downstream effect or of IL -13 (2,16) . 
 
This has led to consideration of dupilumab, an anti -interleukoin -4 receptor -α monoclonal antibody which blocks 
signaling by both IL-4 and IL -13, as a treatment for moderate to severe COVID -19 infection. In a large 
Version date: 2-2-22 12 retrospective analysis of an international cohort of 350,004 patients with COVID -19, those on dupilumab prior to 
infection with SARS -CoV -2 were shown to have a lower risk of ventilation and death when matched to with 
patients of similar comorbidities (2). 
 
Dupilumab has been FDA approved for treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis since 2017. It has been 
successfully shown to reduce disease severity in not only those with atopic dermatitis but in other allergic diseases 
where Th 2 cytokines have been implicated, including asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis (4). Original clinical trials 
noted limited adverse events in addition to its favorability in use for treatment of atopic patients as a steroid 
sparing regimen (5,6) . Overall, dupilumab’s excellent safety profile, its demonstrated ability in reduce other Th 2 
pathologic processes and its targeted approach to therapy which limits harmful effects of steroid use makes it an 
exciting prospective candidate for successful treatment of COVID -19 infection.   
 
3.2 Experience  with the use of dupilumab in allergic  disease   
Dupilumab was first FDA approved in the United States for treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in 
adults uncontrolled with topic al medications. In 2018, it was approved in patients with moderated to severe 
asthma aged 12 years or older with eosinophilic phenotypes or with oral steroid dependent asthma (4). In 2019 , 
the FDA approved its use in adults with nasal polyps accompanied by chronic rhinosinusitis (17). Its use in atopic 
dermatitis was extended to children aged 6 -11 years old in 2020 for those with moderate to severe disease not 
adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies (18). Studies of dupilumab use in these patients 
demonstrates its ability to reduce Th 2 associated biomarkers in addition to reduction in expression of genes 
involved in Th 2 inflammation including IL -13 (4,19) . Dupilumab is supplied as a single -dose pre filled syringe of 
either 300 mg per 2mL solution or 200 mg per 1.14 mL solution, which are administered subcutaneously. For 
atopic dermatitis, a 600 mg initial dose followed by maintenance dose of 300 mg injecte d every other week is 
recommended (4). A peak mean concentration of drug is reached within one week of initial dosing. Although 
trough concentrations were noted to be lower in adult patients with higher body weights, no dose adjustments are 
recommended. In addition, while  there have not been any studies on the pharmacokinetics of dupilumab in 
hepatic or renal impairment, no dose adjustments are recommended in these patients (4).  
 
Adverse events (AEs)  identified through clinical trials with dupilumab  in atopic dermatitis  include eczema 
herpeticum and herpes zoster although these have not been consistently validated  in subsequent meta -analysis 
studies (4). Dupilumab has additionally been found to result in a lower risk of skin infections which is suspected 
to be due to its normalization of the skin barrier (4,9) . Prescribing information additionally lists conjunctivitis as 
an AE with dupilumab use in those with atopic dermatitis, although this increased risk was not seen in asthma and 
chronic sinusitis trials. Conjunctivitis episodes are listed as mild to moderat e in severity with rare need for drug 
discontinuation (4). Additional prescribing information for dupilumab lists additional AEs as hypersensitivity 
reactions and cardiovascular events (9). Although no trials  to date  have been devoted to dupilumab use in 
pregnancy, there  are trials ongoing in this patient population (20).  
 
Clinical trials in asthma patients revealed similar rates of AEs across study groups. Common AEs from these 
trials included injection site reactions, nasopharyngitis, nausea, conjunctivitis, headache, upper respiratory tract 
infections, bronchitis,  and sinusitis. Transient eosinophilia (>500  cells/  µL) was noted in both phase 2 and phase 3 
asthma clinical trials  (4). In the LIBERTY ASTHMA VENTURE phase 3 international, randomized, double -
blind, placebo -controlled trial enrolling 210 asthma patients found asymptomatic eosinophilia in 14% of 
dupilumab treated patients compared to 1% of placebo patients. Per the trial authors, eosinophilia was of no 
clinical consequence in these patients  (10). In LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST phase 3 randomized, double -blind - 
placebo -controlled, parallel group enrolling 1,902 asthma patients, eosinophilia was seen in 4.1% of the 
dupilumab treated patients compared to 0.6% of the placebo treated patients, with 1.2% of d upilumab -treated with 
eosinophil counts of greater than 3,000 cells/µL. Eosinophilia in this trial resulted in eight patients to be 
discontinued from the trial (7 in the dupilumab group and 1 in the control group)  (7). In a multicenter 
retrospective cohort enrolling 214 patients with atopic dermatitis  found higher rates of eosinophilia than in the 
clinical trials, reporting  57% had eosinophilia out of 177 patients who had at least 1 eosinophil count measured 
Version date: 2-2-22 13 with 29.8% with hypereosinophilia (>1500 cells/ µL) and a maximum count of 7800 cells/ µL. A total of five of 
these patients discontinued the drug due to persistent hypereosinophilia (21).

affected by COVID -19. Each patient admitted to UVA hospital for management of COVID -19 infection will be 
assessed for possible enrollment. If eligibility criteria are met, p atients will be approached with special care taken 
to provide clear language and open communication about trial goals and design, particularly when discussing with 
minority populations. Every effort will be made to encourage patient trust and maintain stud y transparency.  
 
5.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
5.1 Treatment Summary  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled phase II a trial to assess the safety  of dupilumab use in 
hospitalized patients  with moderate to severe COVID -19 infection . A total of 40 eligible subject s will be enrolled 
and randomized to receive either dupilumab or placebo  at 1:1 ratio . The randomization will be stratified based on 
disease severity: patients who are on 15L or less of oxygen by nasal cannula (severity group A) and those 
requiring more than 15L of oxygen by nasal cannula including any noninvasive ventilation measures (severity 
group B) . Both arms will receive standard of care management per current National Institut es of Health (NIH) 
COVID -19 Treatment Guidelines (8) in ad dition to their randomized treatments. Patients will be followed 
prospectively for up to 360 days after enrollment. We will document a dverse events related to respiratory or 
clinical status with injection of dupilumab and  adverse events during the first 60 days of the study period : injection 
site reactions, eye/eyelid inflammation, conjunctivitis, oropharyngeal pain, insomnia, tooth ache, gastritis, 
arthralgia, bacterial pneumonia, herpes viral infection, hypereosinophilic syndrome, hypersensitivity reaction . 
Immune testing will be performed to sequentially profile the immune responses of the patients after they receive 
dupilumab . Patients ≥ 18 years of age, hospitalized with a positive RT -PCR for SARS -CoV -2 within the last 14 
days, with illness duration within the last 14 days, and evidence of moderate to severe COVID -19 infection will 
be enrolled in the study. Subjects will receive a loading dose of dupilumab (600 mg, given as two 300 mg 
subcutaneous injections) on day 0. This dosing regimen was selected to be equivalent to regimen used in the 
LIBERY ASTHMA VENTURE phase 3 clinical trial and per recommendations for patients with asthma in the 
dupilumab Food a nd Drug Administration (FDA) package insert (9,10) .  Given the suspected longevity of IL -13 
elevation in severe COVID -19 disease out to day 25 of illness, additional single doses of 300 mg will be given at 
14 days and 28 days (dose spacing as recommended for atopic disease) only if the patient remains hospitalized 
and receiving active care by these days (i.e. NIAID 8 point ordinal scale of 4 and above) (3,9) . 
 
5.2 Study drug administration  
• Subcutaneous administration will be done in the hospital . 
• If an AE develops directly after injection, management will occur per investigator and clinical care team 
discretion (i.e. if perceived as allergic reaction, will treat with epinephrine, steroids, diphenhydramine as 
dictated per guidelines for anaphylaxis).  
• Subjects will be removed from the trial if anaphylaxis  or other severe, life threatening AE  occurs and  is 
deemed to have developed due to first or any subsequent dupilumab injections.  
 
5.3 Concomitant medications  
Concomitant medications will be documented on the Case Report Form (CRF).  Concomitant medications will 
be assessed from 7 days prior to enrollment to Day 60 for all medications with the exceptions listed in the bullets 
below. All medications, except biologics and corticosteroids, can be recorded once regardless of the number of 
Version date: 2-2-22 15 times it was given during the time period. For example, vasopressors should be recorded when first dose given (as 
the start date) and the last dose given (as the end date) during the period of assessment.  
  
The following medications will not be recorded in the concomitant medications list:  
• All topical medications: ointments, creams, and lotions;  
• All intranasal medications: nasal decongestants, nasal allergy medications, nasal steroids, and nasal saline 
drops/sprays;  
• All ophthalmic medications: ophthalmic allergy medication, ophthalmic medications for infection, and 
ophthalmic medications for eye dryness (e.g., saline eye drops);  
• Antiseptic mouth wash, lozenges;  
• Cough medication: mucolytics, cough suppressants, and expectorates;  
• GI medications: H2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors, GI stimulants, prokinetics, laxatives, stool softeners, 
antacids, anti -diarrheal and anti -nausea medications;  
• Symptomatic care medications: antipyretics, antihistamines, decongestants, and NSAIDs;  
• Mineral or herbal supplements, dietary supplements, iron/ferrous sulfate, magnesium, calcium, electrolyte 
replacement;  
• Albumin infusions;  
• Melatonin;  
• Nicotine patch, lozenge, gum, or nasal spray, or other product to treat tobacco dependence;  
• Dyes: contrast media, iodine – based dye, barium sulfate, and diatrizoate sodium.  
 
5.3.1 Acceptable Concomitant Medications  
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a subject’s welfare may be administered at the 
discretion of the investigator.  This includes antimicrobial therapies, steroids, insulin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, 
anticoagulants, and any other therapies that are considered standard of care, are recommended in the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID -19 Treatment Guidelines , and are not listed in the exclusion criteria.  
Overlapping  toxicities of dupilumab with standard of care treatment including off -label use of other drugs  will be 
monitored . 
 
5.3.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Subjects are prohibited from receiving medications or vaccinations that are specified in the exclusion criteria 
during study period.  
 
5.4 Subject Removal  
Subjects will not receive any further study treatments  if life threatening or severe AEs  are deemed to have 
developed due to first or any subsequent injections  of dupilumab .  Discontinuation of study drug will not mean 
withdrawal from the study.  All remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated by protocol.  
 
Subjects are free to withdraw from participation in the study  at any time upon request without prejudice.  
 
5.5 Enrollment, Screen Failures, and Study Completion  
Patients are considered e nrolled from time consented to participate until designated as a screen failure , or have 
revoked consent and have  been withdrawn  from the study , or have completed the study . A screen failure is a 
patient who signed informed consent, but then was determined to be ineligible or withdraws from the study  prior 
to any study interventions . Subjects are considered to have completed the study when they are followed through 
day 360 or death occurred prior to day 360.

5.7 Known potential benefits  
This trial is being conducted to test efficacy and ensure  safety of dupilumab use in patients hospitalized with 
moderate to severe COVID -19. If successful, a  key potential benefit to dupilumab use in those with clinical disease 
of COVID -19 is prevention of disease progression than current standard of care for hospitalized patients with 
COVID -19. Given its favorable safety profile, promising previous observation studies coupled with  the high 
mortality of COVID -19, particularly in elderly and vulnerable persons, suggests that the benefits of its use outweigh 
the ri sks. However, for all cases where dupilumab  administration is considered, a risk -benefit assessment must be 
conducted to assess individual variables.  
 
5.8 Known potential risks  
5.8.1 Conjunctivitis  
Prescribing information for dupilumab lists conjunctivitis as an AE with use in those with atopic 
dermatitis, although this increased risk was not seen in asthma and chronic sinusitis trials (4). A meta -
analysis done with clinical trials for use  of dupilumab  in atopic dermatitis found a reported conjunctivitis 
rate of 8% in those treated with dupilumab compared to 3.6% receiving placebo (18). Another meta -
analysis comparing twenty -two unique studies involving dupilumab use in atopic dermatitis reported a 
pooled proportion of 26.1% in those receiving dupilumab. In most studies , details of conjunctivitis 
episodes were  not described in detail but were  considered treatable without discontinuation of dupilumab 
therapy (1 9). Regardless, given the high occurrence of ocular disease in these patients, and in some 
circumstance’s severe disease, we will exclude patients with history of certain ocular diseases as listed in 
our exclusion criteria. Occurrence of ocular symptoms wil l be assessed and managed per the investigator 
team with consultation of Ophthalmology  depending on clinical severity.  
 
5.8.2 Herpes Reactivation  
Prescribing information for dupilumab lists herpes infection and eczema herpeticum  as an AE with 
dupilumab use (4). Initial clinical trials for dupilumab use in atopic dermatitis reported herpes infection in 
6.1% of participants treated with dupilumab and 5.2% in those treated with placebo (18). Subsequent 
meta -analysis of dupilumab cli nical trials in atopic dermatitis found no association between dupilumab 
 
12C-reactive protein and ferritin levels will be analyzed through UVAMC clinical lab.  
13Patient will be required to have mandatory in person follow up 14 days after initial dupilumab dose. Therefore, if patient 
inpatient through day 14 thus receiving 2nd dupilumab dose, will be required to follow up 14 days after (same for day 28 
injection).  
Version date: 2-2-22 18 and herpes infections, with a decrease odds of eczema herpeticum. They additionally found no  association 
between dupilumab and overall infection risk (2 0). Another meta -analysis comparing twenty -two unique 
studies involving dupilumab use in atopic dermatitis found a pooled proportion of 5.8% of herpes simplex 
virus (19). Given this, any concern for herpes infection will be assessed and managed per investig ator 
team. Severe manifestation of herpes virus including ocular herpes infection or herpes eczema herp eticum 
will involve prompt consultation of appropriate subspecialty teams and initiation  of treatment therapies as 
needed.  
 
5.8.3 Injection site reaction  
The most common adverse reaction found with dupilumab use in initial trials was injection site reactions, 
which according to a meta -analysis of clinical trials for use in atopic dermatitis, occurred in 13.2% of 
those receiving dupilumab compared to 6.5% in  those receiving placebo (18). Bothersome injection site 
reactions will be assessed and managed with appropriate symptomatic therapies.  
 
5.8.4 Hypersensitivity reaction  
Hypersensitivity reaction is listed as a potential AE of dupilumab use. There have been case reports of 
patients developing these reactions with their second dose of dupilumab (21). Response to initial and 
second injection of dupilumab will be monitored closely with vital sign assessments. Any concern for 
acute hypersensitivity reaction will involve prompt assessment from the investigator or primary team and, 
if warranted, treatment with appropriate therapies (i.e. epinephrine, steroids, diphenhydramine etc.).  
 
5.8.5 Hypereosinophilic Syndrome  
Hypereosinophilia  (HE) is defined as an eosinophil count  >1.5 k/µl on peripheral laboratory 
measurement and/or pathologic evaluation via tissue staining with evidence of : eosinophils exceeding 
20% of all nucleated cells  in a bone marrow section  and/or pathologist opinion of extensive eosinophil 
tissue infiltration and/or marked deposition of eosinophil granules. Hypereosinophilic syndrome  (HES)  is 
defined as meeting criteria for HE plus organ damage and/or dysfunction attributable to HE, and 
exclusion of other disorders a s a major reason for organ damage (22). While eosinophilia and HE were 
reported in dupilumab clinical trials  in asthma patients as previously discussed, most of these instances 
were considered asymptomatic with no subsequent clinical consequences. In the phase 2b trial assessing 
efficacy and safety of dupilumab use in 300 asthma patients  with a baseline blood eosinophil count >0.3 
k/µl, one subject discontinued study treatment due to HES, which was noted to resolve with subsequent 
steroid treatment (5). Patients will be monitored via lab work for eosinophilia, hypereosinophilia and HES 
as laid out in the treatment plan with frequent assessments of symptoms. Subjects  will be discontinued 
from study treatment and managed with appropriate therapies (i.e. high dose glucocorticoids etc.) with 
any evidence of or concern for HES as deemed by the investigator team.  
 
6.0 PREPARATION  AND ADMINISTRATION  OF DUPILUMAB  
Dupilumab and placebo ( normal  saline) will be maintained in prefilled syringe s as prepared by the investigational 
pharmacy at the University of Virginia . Dupilumab will be sourced commercially and repackaged into syringes 
that are identical to the placebo to maintain blinding. Per package insert, dupilumab is stored refrigerated at 36°F 
to 46°F in original carton to protect from light. If necessary pre -filled syringes can be kept at room temperature 
up to 77°F for a maximum of 14 days. Pre filled syringes should not be exposed to heat or direct sun light (9).  
Subcutaneous injection will occur in the hospital in the upper arm, thigh or lower abdomen (avoiding areas within 
2 inches of navel)  and avoiding areas where skin is damaged or tender.  If an AE develops directly after injection, 
management will occur per investigator and clinical care team discretion (i.e. if perceived as allergic reaction, 
will treat with epinephrine, steroids, diphenhydramine as dictated per guidelines for anaphylaxis ). Subjects should 
be removed from the trial if life threatening or severe AEs  are deemed to have developed due to first or any 
subsequent dupilumab injections .

7.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
7.1 Randomization and Stratification  
The double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized clinical trial aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
dupilumab in hospitalized patients with COVID -19 positive. Patients will be enrolled and randomized to either 
dupilumab or placebo and followed prospectively for 360 days post enrollment. The primary outcome is the 
proportion of patients alive and free of invasive mechanical ventilation at 28 days . The study will also evaluate the 
incidence of other serious a dverse reactions as the secondary outcome.  This study will use an automated central 
randomization procedure to allocate patients in a 1:1 ratio to each of the two treatment groups. The randomization 
will be stratified based on disease severity : patients who are on 15L or less of oxygen by nasal cannula  (severity 
group A)  and those requiring more than 15L of oxygen by nasal cannula including any noninvasive  ventilation 
measures  (severity group B) . 
 
7.2 Sample Size Justification and Power Analysis  
This trial is intended to be an early stage and proof of concept study with the primary goal to collect reliable data 
and obtain sufficient evidence for future trials. Thus the emphasis of the study is an exploratory estimation of 
effect size and incidence of adverse events in terms of eosinophilia; it is not considered as a pivotal trial for 
efficacy at this time. Therefore, a larger significance level (one -sided alpha=0.1) is used and the sample size is 
pre-selected based on the feasibility. Given the cur rent decline trend in the incidence of COVID -19 positive cases,  
we anticipate to enroll 40 patients realistically into this randomized clinical trial, which shall be sufficient for us 
to collect reliable and interpretable data for proof of concept to inform future trials. The COVID -19 
hospitalization data from our Univ ersity of Virginia Health System between March 2020 and April 6, 2021 
showed that 79.5% of COVID -19 inpatients were alive and free of mechanical ventilation at 28 days under the 
usual care. Wi th 40 patients that are deemed to be feasible, we  would expect Dupilumab to improve a margin of 
17.7% in the proportion of patients alive and free of mechanical ventilation at 28 days . That is, it is anticipated 
that 97. 2% of patients being alive and free of ventilation at 28 days in the Dupilumab arm. The power analysis is 
conducted using the o ne-sided Score test (Farrington & Manning) with 75% power and 10% type I error.   
 
7.3 Expected accrual rate, accrual duration, and study duration  
Our anticipated accrual rate is about 5-6 patients per month. Thus, it should take approximately 12-14 months to 
accrue the 40 patients needed for the trial. Allowing for 360 days of follow -up to obtain the primary endpoints on CBC with 
differential 
and CMP7  x  x x X6 x X6 X6   
Version date: 2-2-22 21 the last patient enrolled and 3 months to assemble, analyze and interpret the data the total study duration is projected 
to be at most 18 months.  
 
7.4 Analysis of AE data  
Analysis of AE data will primarily be descriptive based on DAIDS  coding of events. The proportion of subjects 
experiencing an SAE and the proportion experiencing a Grade 3 or higher will be recorded. AE will be compared 
to published data.

• Need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)  
 
7.6 Statistical  analysis.  
All subjects who received one dose of study drug will be included in the safety analysis. Each primary and 
secondary efficacy outcome measure will be analyzed for the intent -to-treat (ITT) and evaluable population. The 
intent -to-treat principle is that participants will be analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized, 
regardless of whet her they received the randomized study medication. Another analysis population of interest is 
the as -treated population. The as -treated population will consist of onl y participants who were inducted onto study 
medication, even one dose of drug. Safety outcome will be primarily analyzed for the as -treated population. 
Summary statistics for each endpoint will be provided for each relevant comparison group including the results  of 
statistical tests. All subjects who have a result for the baseline and a follow -up and who have received at least one 
dose of study drug will be included for the analysis of efficacy.   
 
After the 14th day of the 20th patient enrolled, the proportion and rate of change of C - reactive protein and ferritin 
levels will be calculated from day 0 and day 14 time points to determine efficacy trends between the two 
treatment groups. Additionally, percentage of eosinophilia w ill be calculated between the two groups to determine 
safety trend.  We expect greater changes in C - reactive protein and ferritin for patients receiving Dupilumab than 
those receiving placebo and no significant differences in eo sinophilia between the two groups.  Data will be 
analyzed by a third party and remain blinded to the study investigators.  
   
Data will be summarized as frequency , with percentage for categorical clinical variables , and as mean ± standard 
deviation or median with interquartile range for continuous variables. The difference between  dupilumab  and 
placebo arms will be tested with Chi -square for categorical measures ( e.g., the primary efficacy endpoint) and 
two-sample t -test or Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous measures  (e.g., age or biomarkers) . Due to the 
relatively small sample size in the study, the adjusted treatment effect of  dupilumab  will be estimated 
exploratively in generalized linear regression for the primary and secondary outcomes to account for the potential 
impact of patient characteristics (e.g., age, sex, race and co -morbidities). Data transformation will be considered 
for the  outcomes with skewed distribution such as hospital length of stay (LOS) and ICU LOS. The trajectory of 
each immune biomarker over the follow -up time points will be plott ed to characterize the change of immune 
responses over time, and difference in biomarker (or transformed biomarker to improve normal distribution, if 
necessary) trajectories between the two study arms will be assessed in the mixed effects model.  
Since this is intended to be an early stage, proof of concept study for which the primary goal is to inform future 
trials rather than to perform formal hypothesis testing, no multiplicity adjustment is planned. In addition, machine 
learning methods such as  random forests algorithm will be applied to fully evaluate the treatment effect and 
predictability of  dupilumab  and other important predictors on the outcomes non -parametrically.

listed in section 4.0 or if they have completed all study assessments through follow -up. 
 
10.0 RISKS AND BENEFITS  
 
10.1 Potential Benefits of Treatment for the Patient  
The benefits of anti -inflammatory  therapy  with dupilumab in patients with respiratory symptoms consistent with  
pneumonia due to COVID 19 infection at high risk for requiring ICU admission are not known. It is anticipated that 
treatment will decrease the  time to recovery,  risk of disease progression, decrease ICU admissions  and decrease 
aggressive respiratory support including possible mechanical ventilation and other ICU support.  
 
10.3 Potential benefits of clinical monitoring and virologic testing  
Subjects enrolled in the study may reduce their chances of disease progression.  
    
Version date: 2-2-22 25 10.4 Potential risks  
1. Risks of dupilumab: injection site reactions, eye/eyelid inflammation,  conjunctivitis,  oropharyngeal pain, 
insomnia, tooth ache, gastritis, arthralgia, bacterial pneumonia, herpes viral infection, eosinophilia, hyper 
eosinophilic syndrome, hypersensitivity  reaction.  
2. Risks of phlebotomy: local discomfort, bruising  and/or  hematoma, bleeding, fainting , infection . 
3. Total blood draws will not exceed 500 mL  
4. Risks of oropharyngeal and throat swab: local discomfort, vomiting  
 
10.5 Alternatives  
The alternative to participation in this study is routine care.  
 
11.0 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SAFETY EVALUATION  
Adverse events will be evaluated and scored using Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of 
Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events Version 2.1  (DAIDS  v2.1). 
(https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/sites/default/files/daidsgradingcorrectedv21.pdf  ) 
 
11.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event will be considered any undesirable sign, symptom, medical, or psychological condition even if 
the event is not considered to be related to the investigational drug/intervention. Medical condition/diseases present 
before starting the invest igational drug/intervention will be considered adverse events only if they worsen after 
starting study treatment/intervention.  An adverse event is also any undesirable and unintended effect of research 
occurring in human subjects as a result of the collec tion of identifiable private information under the research.  
Adverse events also include any problems associated with the use of an investigational drug that adversely affects 
the rights, safety or welfare of subjects.  
 
11.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An adverse event (AE) is considered a serious adverse event (SAE) if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• death,  
• a life -threatening adverse event,  
• inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
• a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, 
or  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be 
considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and 
may require medical or surgical interven tion to p revent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples 
of suc h medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
11.3 Unexpected Adverse event: (UAE)  
The PI will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected.  An AE will be considered 
unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously 
described for the study inter vention.  
Version date: 2-2-22 26 11.4 Unanticipated Problem (UP)  
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems (UPs) (may include a data 
breach) involving risks to participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that 
meets all of the following crite ria: 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given the research procedures that are described in 
the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved research protocol 
and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research ("possibly related" means there is a reasonable 
possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in 
the research); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
11.5 Protocol Deviation  
A protocol deviation is defined as any change, deviation, or departure from the study design or procedures of a 
research project that is NOT approved by the institution’s IRB prior to its initiation or implementation, OR 
deviation from standard operating procedures, Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), federal, state or local regulations. 
Protocol violations may or may not be under the control of the study team or UVA staff. These protocol violations 
may be major or minor violations.  
 
11.6 Reporting Interval  
All AEs and SAEs will be documented from the first administration of study product and for the following 60 days 
or until un -enrollment from the study, whichever comes sooner. All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution 
even if this extends beyond the study -reporting period. Resolution of an adverse event is defined as the return to 
pre-treatment status or stabilization of the condition with the expectation that it will remain chronic.  
 
11.7 Investigator’s Assessment of Adverse Events  
The determination of seriousness, severity, and causality will be made by an on -site investigator who is qualified 
(licensed) to diagnose adverse event information, provide a medical evaluation of adverse events, and classify 
adverse events based upon medi cal judgment. This includes but is not limited to physicians, physician assistants, 
and nurse practitioners.  
 
11.8 Assessment of S everity  
For AEs not included in the protocol -defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to describe 
severity.  
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. 
Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or 
other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the term 
“severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious” . 
 
11.9 Assessment of Association  
All AEs must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by the clinician who examines and evaluates 
the participant based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about 
causality will be graded using the c ategories below.  
• Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, 
Version date: 2-2-22 27 occurs in a plausible time relationship to study intervention administration and cannot be explained by 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  
 
• Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors 
is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable 
time after administration of the study intervention, is unlik ely to be attributed to concurrent disease or 
other drugs or chemicals.  
 
• Possibly Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred 
within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other factors may have 
contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition , other concomitant events).  
• Unlikely to be related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose temporal 
relationship to study intervention administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event 
did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the st udy intervention) and in which other 
drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the participant’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant treatments).  
 
• Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study intervention administration, and/or evidence 
exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology.  
 
. 
12.0 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS AND PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
All AEs  meeting DAIDS  grade 3 severity or above including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria 
for SAEs will be captured. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s 
assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by those with  the training and authority to 
make a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs  meeting DAIDS  grade 3 severity or 
above  occurring while on study must be documented appropriately r egardless of relationship. All AEs  meeting 
DAIDS  grade 3 severity or above  will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition (including a laboratory abnormality) that is present at the time that the participant is 
screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each 
level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration 
of each episode.  
 
AEs meeting DAIDS  grade 3 severity or above  must be recorded into the case report forms and  will be  reported 
per the following guidelines ( Error! Reference source not found. 2). 
 
It is the responsibility of the principal investigator to use continuous vigilance to prevent, identify and report 
protocol deviations. Major protocol deviations must be reported to the UVA IRB -HSR per the following 
guidelines (Table 2 ).  Minor deviations do not need to be reported to the UVA IRB -HSR.  All deviations must be 
addressed in study source documents.

13.0 SAFETY OVERSIGHT  
 
13.1 Independent Medical Monitor  
An independent medical monitor will provide additional safety oversight for this study.  The medical monitor  will 
report to the principal investigator and IND sponsor.  They will review the following:  
• All adverse events  
• Audit results  
• Application of study designed stopping/decision rules  
• Whether the study accrual pattern warrants continuation/action  
• Protocol violations  
 
The medical monitor will review the information listed above every two months (or more frequently if needed 
based on rate of accrual or safety issues)  for aggregate review of data.  Issues of immediate concern by the 
medical monitor  will be brought to the attention of the Principal Investigator/ IND sponsor (and if appropriate to 
the IRB) and a formal response from the IND -sponsor is requested.   
 
13.2 Study monitoring  
The study team will perform internal quality management of study conduct, data and biological specimen 
collection, documentation and completion according to institutional policies.  A safety review and analysis will be 
conducted after the 10th and 40th participant is enrolled.  
Version date: 2-2-22 30 Any study under the purview of the University of Virginia IRB -HSR is subject to review of files at the University 
of Virginia. Studies are chosen for Post -approval Monitoring either a) at random or b) requested by a study team 
member or any member of the I RB-HSR.   
The purpose of Post -approval Monitoring audits is to ensure that documentation of clinical research studies is of 
the highest quality, verify protocol adherence, and ensure that all Federal and local rules concerning clinical 
research are being fulfilled.  Post-approval monitoring is done by staff within the office of the Vice President for 
Research (VPR) in accordance with their Standard Operating Procedures. The conduct of an on -site review may 
include but is not limited to:  
• requests for progress reports from investigators,  
• examinations of research records, including signed informed consent documents, protocol modifications, 
and unexpected, serious, and/or related adverse experience reports,  
• contacts with research subjects, or  
• observation of the consent process and/or research procedures. Examples of when observation of the 
consent process could occur are:  
• Full board IRB determines during review of a project that a conflict of interest exists such that the 
informed consent process should be observed by a neutral party;  
• IRB is made aware of a complaint or concern with regard to the informed consent process; or  
• IRB determines as a result of the monitoring process that the consent process is insufficient and 
education/training is required for conduct of consent.  
 
14.0 STOPPING DECISION RULES  
 
14.1 Study stopping decision rules  
The study enrollment and further dosing will be stopped and an ad hoc independent medical monitor review will be 
performed if any of the following specific events occur or, if in t he judgment of the study physician , subject safety 
is at risk of being compromised:  
1. Death within one hour of dupilumab administration  
2. Occurrence of a life -threatening allergic/hypersensitivity reaction (anaphylaxis), manifested by 
bronchospasm with or without urticaria or angioedema requiring hemodynamic support with pressor 
medications or mechanical ventilation  
3. One subject with a grade 4 or persistent grade 3 (≥72 hours) associated with study product.  
4. Two subjects with persistent Grade  3 (≥ 72 hours) or higher lab toxicity for the same parameter associated 
with study product.  
5. An overall pattern of symptomatic, clinical, or laboratory events that the medical monitor, ISM, or SMC 
consider associated with study product and that may appear minor in terms of individual events but that 
collectively may represent a serious potential c oncern for safety.  
6. Any other event(s) which is considered to be a serious adverse event in the good clinical judgment of the 
attending physician team.  This will be appropriately documented.  
 
Upon completion of this review and receipt of the advice of the independent medical monitor, the PI  will determine 
if study entry or study dosing should be interrupted or if study entry and study dosing may continue according to 
the protocol.  
 
14.2 Study Drug S topping Rules  Within a Single Subject  
Injection  of study drug  (i.e., patient will not receive any further dupilumab injections if they remain in the hospital 
during pre -specified time periods)  will be halted if any of the following manifestations of anaphylaxis develop and 
will not be restarted:  
1. Skin or mucous membrane manifestations: hives, pruritus, flushing, swollen lips, tongue or uvula  
2. Respiratory compromise: dyspnea, wheezing, stridor, hypoxemia  
Version date: 2-2-22 31 3. A decrease in systolic blood pressure to < 90 mmHg or >30% decrease from baseline or a diastolic drop of 
>30% from baseline.  
4. Tachycardia with an increase in resting heart rate to > 130bpm; or bradycardia <40 that is associated with 
dizziness, nausea or feeling faint.  
5. Any other symptom or sign which in the good clinical judgment of the study clinician or supervising 
physician warrants halting the infusion.  For example, the rapid onset of gastrointestinal symptoms, such 
as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps, for instance, may be manifestatio ns of anaphylaxis and may 
warrant an immediate halt prior to meeting full SAE criteria . 
 
15.0 STUDY MANAGEMENT  
 
15.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval  
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in accordance with federally mandated 
regulations.  The IRB should approve the consent form and protocol.  
 
15.2 Informed Consent  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study and 
continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Consent forms will be Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) -approved and the participan t will be asked to read and review the document. A member of the study team 
will explain the research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise. A verbal explanation 
will be provided in terms suited to the participant’s comprehension  of the purposes, procedures, and potential 
risks of the study and of their rights as research participants.  Participants will have the opportunity to carefully 
review the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing.  The participants should have the opportunity 
to discuss the study with their family or surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. If the 
participant is deemed incapable of making their own medical decisions  (i.e., mechanically ventilated, or otherwise 
incapacita ted), a surrogate decision maker or legally authorized representative will be provided with the study 
information as detailed above and may consent to enrollment on behalf of the participant . The participant  (or 
surrogate decision maker ) will sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done 
specifically for the study.  
 
Results from procedures completed prior to consent for standard of care purposes may be used for research 
purposes.  
 
Participants must be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any 
time, without prejudice. A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the participants for their 
records.  
 
The informed consent process will be conducted and documented in the source document (including the date), and 
the form signed, before the participant undergoes any study -specific procedures. The rights and welfare of the 
participants will be protected by emphasizing to them that the quality of their medical care will not be adversely 
affected if they decline to participate in this study.  
 
15.3 Adherence to the Protocol  
Except for an emergency situation in which proper care for the protection, safety, and well -being of the study subject 
requires alternative treatment, the study shall be conducted exactly as described in the approved protocol.   
 
15.3.1 Emergency Modifications  
Investigators may implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) to trial subjects without prior IRB -HSR approval/favorable opinion.   
For any such emergency modification implemented, a UVA IRB modification f orm must be completed by 
study p ersonnel within five (5) business days of making the change.  
Version date: 2-2-22 32    
15.3.2 Other Protocol Deviations/Violations  
Protocol Deviations : A protocol deviation  is any unplanned variance from an IRB approved protocol that:  
• Is generally noted or recognized after it occurs  
• Has no substantive effect on the risks to research participants  
• Has no substantive effect on the scientific integrity of the research plan or the value of the data 
collected  
• Did not result from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the investigator(s).  
Study personnel will record the deviation, and report to any sponsor or data and safety monitoring 
committee in accordance with their policies.  Deviations should be summarized and reported to the IRB at 
the time of continuing review.  
 
Protocol Violations : An unplanned protocol variance is considered a violation  if the variance:  
• Has harmed or increased the risk of harm to one or more research participants.  
• Has damaged the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study.  
• Results from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the investigator(s).  
• Demonstrates serious or continuing noncompliance with federal regulations, State laws, or 
University policies.  
 
Violations should be reported by study personnel to the IRB within one (1) week of the investigator 
becoming aware of the event  (refer to Table 2  in section 13 – Reporting Adverse Events and Protocol 
Deviations) . 
 
15.4 Obligations of Investigators  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for the conduct of the clinical trial at the site in accordance with Title 21 
of the Code of Federal Regulations, all applicable local regulatory laws and regulations and/or the Declaration of

APPENDIX:  
NIAID 8 -POINT ORDINAL SCALE FOR CLINICAL IMPROVEMENT   
• The ordinal scale is an assessment of the clinical status at the first assessment of a given 
study day. The scale is as follows: 8) Death; 7) Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical 
ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 6) Hospitalized, on non -
invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 5) Hospitalized, requiring 
supplemental oxygen; 4) Hospitalized,  not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring 
ongoing medical care (COVID -19 related or otherwise); 3) Hospitalized, not requiring 
supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care; 2) Not hospitalized, 
limitation on activities and/or requirin g home oxygen; 1) Not hospitalized, no 
limitations on activities.

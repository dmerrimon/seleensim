April 11, 2021  3  1.0 Background  
Hypertension (HTN) is more common and more harmful for African Americans than for any other ethnic group 
(AHA, 2020a). More than half of African American adults, about 15 million people, have HTN (AHA, 2017; 
Annie E. Casey Fdn, 2019). Furthermore, African Americans are 4 times less likely to adhere to HTN meds 
compared to their white counterparts (Schoenthaler et al. 2016). Tailored approaches to reduce the racial gap 
in HTN morbidity and mortality, particularly those supporting med adherence, are needed in  primary care 
(NHLBI, 2020). Importantly, HTN is one of most common co -morbidities in Covid19 hospitalizations, 
particularly for African Americans (CDC 2020). Moreover, media coverage of a possible link between certain 
HTN meds, called RAAS inhibitors, and  severe Covid19 outcomes may have alarmed HTN patients about the 
safety of their meds. As a result, the ACC (March, 2020) issued guidelines recommending all patients adhere 
to HTN meds during the pandemic unless advised by their physicians, as there is no evidence of a link 
between HTN drugs and Covid19 severity. In fact, severe heart complications have been reported among 
Covid19 patients that stopped HTN meds, including RAAS inhibitors, could worsen outcomes (ACC, July 2020). 
Thus, in the time of Covid19,  supporting med adherence of African Americans with HTN is extremely urgent.  
2.0 Goals  
We propose a digital adherence solution to help reduce HTN -related disparities among African Americans, 
called Memento.HTN, which is innovative in three key ways: 1) it  is the first -ever linked digital provider 
platform and patient SMS text system for HTN medication adherence; 2) it is culturally -tailored for African 
Americans with HTN; and 3) it has unique monitoring functionality allowing providers to monitor individua l 
patient adherence, support ‘new start’ patients, who are at increased risk for non -adherence, and to track 
group adherence rates by drug class, pill format, and patient demographics in order to inform clinical  
therapeutics. Requiring only minutes of staf f or prescriber monitoring per day, the Memento system simplifies 
and facilitates provider delivery of adherence support. The provider platform sends patients interactive SMS pill 
reminders plus culturally -sensitive motivational, educational, spiritual/str ess-supportive, and customizable 
texts, along with texts that target intentional non -adherence. Importantly, Memento allows 2 -way 
communication between providers and patients, and automatically alerts providers when a patient is having 
clinically -significa nt pill lapses.  
Specific Aim 1:  Develop an individually -tailored, culturally -sensitive digital health intervention comprised of a 
provider platform and linked patient SMS system to promote medication adherence in African Americans with 
HTN. 
Specific Aim 2: Implement a 6 -wk pilot to evaluate feasibility and short-term effectiveness for improving 
adherence.

UChicago Primary Care Group, Prisma Baptist Hospital, and Brigham & Women’s Hospital, including affiliated 
clinics , and UserInterviews, an online recruitment source . Clinic ads and flyers will be posted on bulle tin 
boards and other clinic -based outlets, and we will ask clinic staff to share flyers and study information with 
potential participants. Flyers & ads will state what the study is about, who is funding it, who might be 
eligible, what the length of time & compensation would be, and will provide contact number for more 
information about the study. Individuals who contact us will be screened (via zoom, phone or face -to-face) 
further for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Individuals who meet study criteria and agr ee to participate in the 
study will complete an online consent form in Qualtrics.  
Patient Recruitment 6 week pre -post evaluation.  Primary care recruitment resources include: UChicago 
Primary Care Group, Prisma Baptist Hospital, and Brigham & Women’s Hospi tal, including affiliated clinics , 
and UserInterviews . Clinic ads and flyers will be posted on clinic bulletin boards and other clinic -based 
outlets, and we will ask clinic staff to share flyers and study information with potential participants. 
Individual s who contact us will be screened further via zoom or phone for inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Individual who meet study criteria and agree to participate in the study will complete an online consent form 
in Qualtrics. Individuals who meet study criteria an d sign the informed consent will complete online baseline 
assessments, including obtaining a BP reading using a BP cuff which we will donate to each person as a part 
of the study.  
Healthcare provider usability and formative focus group participants . Healt hcare providers will be recruited 
through signs and word of mouth in the University of Chicago Medicine, Prisma Hospital and Brigham &  
Women’s Hospital, as well as through Boston -area community health centers where Dr. Weitzman has 
numerous contacts  and/or  through UserInterviews.

answer. Individuals, who are comfortable proceeding, will provide a signature online in the Qualtrics form.   
Patient 6 week Pre-post evaluation:  All potential participants will review inclusion criteria and online consent 
form via Qualtrics. The consent f orm for patient participants in the 6 -week evaluation of Memento will 
describe procedures and potential risks. It will emphasize that participation is voluntary and will not in any 
way affect employment or access to any services received from any provider or agency or clinic, and that 
participants can discontinue involvement at any time. Furthermore, as done in our other adherence studies, 
the consent will state the possibility that SMS texts or the linked provider platform may malfunction during 
the evalua tion, and that participants should continue to use whatever other methods they normally use to 
remember their pills for the duration of the study. It will also state that any information offered as a part of 
the study should not replace a  participant’s own  physician’s advice.  It will also state that the study involves 
potential privacy loss and breach of confidentiality. After the informed consent is electronically signed, the 
study will proceed. At the completion of the 6 -week period, participants will par ticipate in a focus groups with 
up to 10 others or individual interviews (via zoom/phone) to gain their feedback on their experience with of 
the Memento program.  
5.0 Study  Procedures  
Patient Focus Groups:  For the formative & usability patient group  (or individual interviews), after providing 
online consent, individuals will meet for a 1.5 hour conversation via Zoom, during which they will either 
provide formative feedback on the Memento approach and on new text messages & the usability of the 
prototype Memento system. Focus groups/interviews will be audiotaped. Participants will receive $50 in an 
Amazon gift card at the end of each group/interview.  
Healthcare Provider Focus Groups:  For usability groups with healthcare providers (or individual interviews), 
after providing online consent, individuals will meet for a 1.5 hour conversation via Zoom, during which they 
will either provide formative feedback on the prototype Memento system, including how it might fit into 
clinical workflows, or usabil ity feedback on its functioning. Focus groups will be audiotaped.  
Participants will receive $ 75 Amazon gift card at the end of the group.  
Patient 6-week pre-post evaluation:  After signing the online consent, participants will complete baseline 
assessments , pill regimen (including medication name, dosing, retail or mail -order pharmacy, the preferred 
time for pill reminders, refill due date, and how long they have been on HTN meds), and demographic data in 
the online Qualtrics platform. Participants will rec eive $20 Amazon gift card for completion of baseline 
assessments. We will describe how to measure their arm with a tape measure (which we will have sent to 
them in advance) so that we can send them a correct size BP cuff. After taking the measurement, a ne w BP 
cuff (clinically - validated, blue -tooth enabled, Omron 5) will be delivered to each participant . Staff will meet 
again with participant (face -to-face or via zoom or phone) to guide them in getting baseline BP. The 
participant will be asked to sit quie tly in a chair with their feet on the floor for  several minutes, then measure 
their BP and pulse. Staff will record numbers. After another 5 minutes, the process will be repeated, yielding 2 
BP readings, which will be averaged. Afterward, the participant w ill begin receiving SMS texts from the 
provider platform.  
During the 6 -week study period, patient participants will receive several types of text messages: daily 
interactive pill reminders, educational, motivational, spiritual/stress -supportive .   Individuals that are ‘new 
starts,’ i.e. have been prescribed HTN meds within the last 8 weeks, will receive additional texts to support 
their implementation and persistence with their HTN med regimen. Study staff will monitor  backend data to

of 7 days, which Dr.Perez has advised us is a clinically -significant pill lapse. In such instances, study staff will 
reach out  to patients to see if they need support to help them with engagement.  
At 6 weeks, patient participants will receive a phone call and text informing them it is time to re -take baseline 
assessments as well as to participate in end -of-study focus group (or individual interview). At the end of the 
study, participants will be invited to participate in a  zoom  focus group with up to 10 other participants or an 
individual interview (zoom or phone) to  provide feedback on the Memento system.   
After re -taking base lines and participating in the end -of-study focus group/interview, pre -post participants will 
be emailed a link for $130 Amazon gift card.  
6.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk to Participants or 
Others  
We consider the r isks to participants in both the patient and the healthcare provider focus groups to be 
minimal, i.e. there is a minor risk that other members of the patient focus group will know that a given 
participant is taking HTN medications. We will be clear in cons enting patients that such a risk exists. There is 
a small risk of the time demand of the focus group will feel burdensome. We will make clear in informed 
consents for patients and for providers that they may end their participation at any time if the time demand 
becomes a problem.  
Additionally, there is a risk to pre -post evaluation participants that someone will see their text messages and 
realize that the participant is taking HTN meds. In the pre -post informed consent, we will advise participants 
to del ete any texts that they do not wish others to see. We will inform participants that state -of-the-art and 
HIPAA -compliant security protections are in place for any data in transit from the platform to their phone,  
but that there is still a risk to data in transit or privacy loss due to someone reading their text messages or 
breach of confidentiality due to data in transit or data storage. We will advise participants uncomfortable with 
those risks not to participate in the study. We will also outline in the informed consent measures that the 
team will take to protect their  data. 
7.0 Compensation and Costs  
Focus Groups:  For their participation in the focus groups, hypertension patient participants will receive a $50 
Amazon gift card.  Healthcare providers will  receive $75 Amazon gift card.  
Patient 6-week pre-post evaluation.  Participants will receive $20 in an Amazon gift card for completion of 
baseline assessments (e.g. blood pressure (BP) measures). At the completion of the pre -post study, patient 
participa nts will be offered $130 Amazon gift card for their time. In total, pre -post participants will receive 
$150 in Amazon gift card.  
There will be no costs to participants.  
8.0 Study  Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
Any participant may choose to withdraw from the focus group study or the pre -post study at any time and for 
any reason. Participants will need simply to contact the investigator.

April 11, 2021  7  9.0. Outcome Measures  
HTN med adherence will be assessed by the Adherence to Refills and Medication Scale ( ARMS), a 
well-validated self -report measure used widely in studies with minority patients and/or those with low 
literacy (Buis et al., 2019; Kripalani et al., 2009; McNaugton et al., 2014). We will also use Segeral et 
al. (2010) 3 -item adherence measure, a s in our prior research (Pagan -Ortiz et al., 2019). Validated 
self-report measures correlate with clinical outcomes and are desirable to use in research with African 
American patients, who may resist providing bio -specimens due to historical mistrust (Ewin g et al., 
2019, Stirratt et al., 2015). Lastly, electronic pill bottles are cumbersome, expensive, and often 
ineffective for promoting and tracking adherence (Choudhry et al., 2017; Volpp et al., 2017).  
Secondary: Adherence self -efficacy will be assessed w ith the HTN med adherence self -efficacy scale 
(MASES) (Ogedegbe et al. 2003). HTN knowledge will be assessed using the NHLBI HTN Knowledge 
Scale (Carter -Edwards et al., 2002). Stress burden will be assessed using Perceived Stress Scale 
(Cohen et al., 1983) . Exploratory: BP will be measured at baseline and 6 weeks. Primary 
Hypothesis : Participants will show greater HTN med adherence at 6 wks compared to  baseline.  
Secondary Hypothesis: Participants will show greater HTN adherence self -efficacy, greater HTN 
knowledge, and lower stress burden at 6 wks compared to baseline. Exploratory Hypothesis : 
Participants will show a decrease in systolic BP at 6 wks compared to baseline. Data analyses:  We 
will conduct one -tailed paired t -tests at the .05 level for primary and exploratory hypotheses  and 
McNemar’s chi square for secondary hypotheses. Data from our Phase 1 evaluation of short -term 
effectiveness will be used to determine the sample size nec essary for an adequately -powered Phase 2 
RCT. 
10.0  Statistical  Considerations  
Because this is a feasibility study, the pre -post evaluation sample size is not based on power calculations. In 
Phase 2, a sample size will be created with a power of at least 9 0% with a two -sided alpha level of .05.  
11.0  Privacy/Confidentiality  Issues  
For the pre -post evaluation, privacy breach due to electronic exchange of information will be protected 
against via technical safeguards including secure transmission modes for communication, including virtual 
private networks (VPN) or secure sockets layer (SSL), and encryption techniques, developed and utilized in 
other projects by 52Inc.  
The entire Memento.HTN system will use industry standard practices for access control, dat a security in 
transit, and data security at rest. The system will meet or exceed OWASP standards. All data in encrypted at 
rest using AES 256. All data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2 or 1.3 with pinned certificates where 
appropriate. Only users on t he technical team with a direct need to view user data have access to said data 
and all access by the technical and/or study team will be fully logged.  
Following the study, the pre -post data will be moved to a long -term storage database with Amazon Web 
Services and will only be accessible by EHG staff.  
In the patient pre -post informed consent, we will also state that online data collected for this study will be 
removed from the Qualtrics platform, which is HIPAA compliant, stored in our HIPPA compliant EH G 
Google Drive, and backed up on  encrypted folders on  an EHG MacBook Pro. Passwords to access the 
folders will be stored in LastPass, which uses strong encryption algorithms and provides extra

Secondary stroke prevention by Uniting Community and Chronic care model teams Early to End Disparities:  
the SUCCEED Trial  
O
bjectives  
The primary  objectives  of this study are as follows:  
(1)To develop a community -centered component  of a Chronic Care Model -based secondary strok e
pr
evention intervention.
(2)To test the impact of a sustainable Chronic Care Model -based intervention on control of systolic blo od
pr
essure (primary outcome), composite stroke risk, and each individual stroke risk factor (secondary
outcomes), among 500 adults (over 90% minority) recruited “early” - during o r shortly afte r
hos
pitalization for an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or TIA - at one of the four Los Angeles County
safety net medical centers.
(3)To conduct a cost analysis of SUCCEED from the perspective of the Los Angeles County Department
of Health Services, using intervention costs, cost equivalents of associated utilization of county system
resources, and cost equivalents of observed and projected  vascular events.
D
esign and Outcomes  
The study design is a multi -center, randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomized to either a Care 
Management and Community Health Worker led intervention versus  Usual Care to improve management of 
stroke risk factors. The outcomes of this study will be assessed by a blinded Research Assistant. The total 
planned enrollment of this trail is 500 subjects. Subjects will be enrolled in the RCT for a period of 1 Year.   
Fi
gure 1.  SUCCEED Study Design  
We designate systolic blood pressure as the primary outcome for the 
purpose of sample size calculations.  We will assess multiple relevant 
outcomes including all risk factors and a composite index, cost, quality of life, adverse consequences, moderators, mediators, and a range of 
metrics of intervention program implementation and participation.

Interventions and Duration 
We will test the impact of this multi- level, multi- component intervention relative to usual care within the Los 
Angeles County public safety net healthcare system  to improve management of stroke risk factors and 
increase adoption of healthy lifestyle habits.  We will use culturally -adapted educational materials developed by 
  
community-a cademic partnering teams in our Public Outreach and Dissemination Core.  The on study period 
is 12 months. Additional follow-u p off intervention will be every 6 months, up to 18 additional months during 
the period of center funding.  
Data sources include: 
•E
xamination s (Blood pressure, height and weight, waist and hip circumference, NIHSS for
stroke severity, Rankin for disability ): baseline, 3 months, and 12 months
•Fingerstick laboratory tests  (lipid profile, Hgb A1c, CRP ) baseline, 3 months, and 12 months
•Full s urvey : baseline, 3 months, 12 months
•Telephone survey: 8 months
•Telephone surveillance for vascular events and mortality: every 6 months, starting at 12 months,
continuing for duration of center funding
Queri
es of the Los Angeles county administrative database will be conducted when the study is 
completed for LAC service and medication utilization. 
Sam
ple Size and Population  
The setting of this study is all four county hospitals that anchor care for patients in the Los Angeles County public healthcare system (LAC), which serves the largest, most ethnically diverse county in the United States.  This system, often called the Safety Net, serves more than 10 million residents and provides healthcare to 
700,000 people every year, and treats more than 300,000 emergency and trauma victims every year. Through 
an integrated network of hospitals, health centers and clinics, the LA County Health Services System makes 
medical and preventive care services accessible in communities across the county. According to LAC 
administrative databases, more than 50% of patients use a language other than English as their primary 
language and 63% of outpatients are uninsured. 
A to
tal of 500 subjects with the onset of ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or transient ischemic 
attack (TIA) within the prior three months will be recruited from the following off -campus locations:  
•(1) Los Angeles County Hospital + USC Medical Center (LAC+USC) ,
•(2) Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center (Rancho Los Amigos),
•(3) Olive View- UCLA, and
•(4) Harbor -UCLA Medical Center.
No subjects will be recruited at UCLA.  
Str
atification variables are as follows, with 24 strata:  
•Site (4 sites)
•Language (3: English, Spanish, other)
•Type of Stroke (2: ischemic/TIA, hemorrhagic)

1 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1. Primary Objectives  
Primary Objective #1: To develop a community -centered component  of a Chronic Care Model -based 
secondary stroke prevention intervention. This new component includes community health workers  (CHWs) 
collaborating with healthcare system teams based at one of four Los Angeles County -Department of Health 
Services public “safety net” medical centers. CHWs - identified from the communities in which they serve - will 
receive specialized training and will conduct home visits to promote behavior change to address diet  and 
physical activity  risk factors, as well as assess for depression  and social isolation.  CHWs will use an existing, 
scalable mobile health platform specifically designed for care coordination and care teams to use by phone or 
iPAD, to assist patients in tracking selected clinical measures (blood pressure, lipids, weight/BMI, physical 
activity), to promote behavior change. CHWs will communicate and liaison with the healthcare provider team. The community -based  component will also include cultural - and stroke -specific adaptation of physical activity 
and self -management programs at local community venues
 including health education and senior centers.     
Hypothesis : We will develop a culturally -tailored intervention to improve stroke risk factor reduction.  
Primary Objective #2: To test the impact of a sustainable Chronic Care Model -based intervention on control 
of systolic blood pressure (primary outcome), composite stroke risk, and each individual strok e risk factor 
(secondary outcomes), among 500 adults (over 90% minority) recruited “early” - during or shortly after 
hospitalization for an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or TIA - at one of the four Los Angeles County safety net 
medical centers. We will co nduct a randomized trial of this intervention that includes the new, community -
centered component developed in aim #1, and a “re- engineered” healthcare delivery system with nurse 
practitioners or physician assistants as care managers, distribution of home blood pressure monitors, group 
clinics, and a care management software system tailored to secondary stroke prevention and interfaced with 
the mobile health platform used by the CHWs, relative to usual care.  We will include non-English speaking individuals  from Hispanic, Chinese, and Korean racial and ethnic groups, and a broad range of stroke severity.  
We will analyze potential moderators (age, gender, stroke type and severity, education, country of birth/primary 
language, diabetes comorbidity, care team composition) to understand robustness of intervention impacts 
across levels of individual and health system characteristics. We will conduct a formative evaluation to continuously improve implementation, and will measure and analyze extent of intervention implementation, as 
it is delivered for up to 12 months after stroke or TIA through transition of patients into primary care.  We will 
analyze potential mediators (life chaos, competing needs, medication adherence, knowledge of stroke risk 
factors, particip ation in self -management programs, social isolation, depression, health literacy, engagement 
with healthcare provider team, attitudes/health beliefs, self -efficacy, readiness to change, perceived risk, and 
perceptions of quality of interactions with provider) of the intervention’s impact, using both qualitative and quantitative methods.   
Hypothesis : Patients randomized to the SUCCEED intervention will achie ve 8mm greater  reduction in systolic 
blood pressure reduction and lower stroke risk scores at 1 year versus those randomized to usual care.  
Primary Objective #3:  
To conduct a cost analysis of SUCCEED from the perspective of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, using intervention costs, cost equivalents of associated utilization of county system resources, 
and cost equivalents of observed and projected
 vascular events.  We will also develop a financial plan and 
proposal for sustainability  of the intervention if it is effective, incorporating data on cost and utilization, to 
describe potential financial arrangements or approaches – including reimbursement strategies - to support the 
intervention model in the f uture and in other settings.  We will also produce training materials and protocols for 
future dissemination.  
Hypothesis : If effective, the SUCCEED intervention will be sustainable because its community component was 
developed in partnership with the community and is culturally -appropriate, it will demonstrate a projected cost -
offset from future vascular events averted, and intervention tools and training programs will be codified.

2 BACKGROUND  
2.1 Rationale  
Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, with 
well-documented and substantial disparities in the prevention and outcomes of stroke for blacks, Hispanics, 
and Asians relative to whites. The strongest predictor of a future stroke is a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Although the risk of stroke can be substantially reduced through control of modifiable risk factors 
including hypertension, diet, physical activity, and smoking, a nd through optimal management of diabetes and 
dyslipidemia there is abundant evidence that these risk factors are under optimal control in only a small 
proportion of stroke survivors, exposing hundreds of thousands of individuals each year to preventable d eath 
and disability from subsequent strokes. The situation is even more pressing among indigent, minority populations, in which knowledge about stroke is limited and barriers to accessing healthcare – transportation, 
healthcare- related costs, screening of phone communication due to concerns about immigration authorities,  
bill collectors, inability of healthcare providers to maintain current phone numbers due to patients use of prepaid phones that run out, beliefs about causes of stroke symptoms, unhealthy diets, lack of safe places to 
walk or local stores with fresh produce, homelessness, and many others - are formidable. Our group previously 
documented gaps in prevention care after stroke and analyzed barriers among the large, multi -ethnic indigent 
populat ion in Los Angeles County, where out of the entire county’s approximately 10 million residents spread 
over several thousand square miles, fewer than 30% are non- Hispanic whites.  
Bas
ed on International Classification Codes (ICD) codes generated from the Los Angeles county Department 
of Health Services (LAC -DHC) database, there are over 1000 admissions of stroke per year at the four County 
anchor hospitals.  This eligible population is more than 20% greater than in SUSTAIN due to the inclusion of hemorrhagi c stroke.  The eligibility is further increased by including more languages spoken by subjects.

In addition to this eligible inpatient pool, outpatients who have had the onset of with a recent history of stroke or 
TIA are also eligible.  Rancho Los Amigos is implementing a medical home model for uninsured patients with a 
recent stroke, so patients who were admitted elsewhere for their stroke can be fast -tracked to receive post -
discharge follow -up care at Rancho Los Amigos.

Starting in 2010, Los Angeles County has implemented an Emergency Medical System (EMS) routing polic y.  
P
atients w ith acute o nset o f stroke symptoms w ithin three hours ar e divert ed to stroke certified ce nters.   None 
of the four L AC hospitals have  obtained this d esignation yet.  However, we d o not an ticipate this t o be a barrier 
to enrollin g enou gh patients because the number of hospitalized stroke and T IA patients i n 2 011 remains 
ab
ove 1000.   
2.2 Supporting Data (DR. C HENG w ill add S USTAI N ABSTRACT you have unt il the end of t his pa ge) 
Our r esearch team has d esigned and i s implementi ng a chronic ca re model -based program called SUSTAIN 
(Systemic U se of S Troke  Averting I Nterventions)  to improve the d elivery o f secondary st r oke  preventive 
services after h ospital discharge.  This ca re intervention includes gr oup cl inics,  self-management su pport, 
report cards, deci sion support through care guides and protocols,  and coordination of on going care.  The first

Not applicable  
4.2
.6 Specify any clinical (life expectancy, co- existing disease), demographic (age) or other characteristics 
that precludes appropriate diagnosis, treatment, or follow -up in the trail  
Young patients are excluded because the mechanism for their strokes is frequently not due to 
atherosclerosis (e.g. arterial dissections, congenital coagulation defects, etc), so the interventions in 
this proposal may not be as applic able to them.  We will also exclude persons who already meet the 
primary outcome of SBP <120 mm Hg.  We will not be able to translate written materials in languages 
other than English, Spanish, Korean, and Chinese. Patients who do not speak any of those la nguages 
will be excluded.  
4.2
.7 Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would interfere 
with adherence to the study requirements.  
If the participant exhibited active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site 
investigator would interfere with adherence to study requirements, that participant would be excluded from the study.   
4.2
.8 Serious illness (requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization) until subject either completes therapy or is clinically stable on therapy, in the opinion of the site investigator, for at least XX prior to 
the study. (List specific illnesses and acceptable time)  
Not applicable, hospitalized patients are being enrolled in the study.  
4.2
.9 Inability or  unwillingness of subject to give written consent.  
If a subject is unwilling to give written consent, they will be excluded from the trial.  Persons with 
language (aphasia) or cognitive difficulties are in eligible if they cannot  communicate that they 
unders tand the study during the informed consent process.   
4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures  
4.3
.1 Methods for identifying and recruiting candidates for the trial  
The research team will present SUCCEED to clinicians in the neurology, internal medicine, family medicine, emergency department, and the rehabilitation departments.  Study flyers will be posted on the wards, outpatient clinics and housestaff offices of these departments.  In the inpatient setting, we 
will discuss the study with neurology ward nurses and discharge planners, and they will include study 
flyers in discharge packet.  In the outpatient setting, we will discuss the study with the clinic coordinators.  Housestaff will be given pocket- sized index cards about the trial.  One side of the index 
card contains a short description of the aim and the eligibility requirements.  The back side of the index card contains an IRB- approved short script of a few se ntences that describe the study and ask for 
verbal permission for a member of the research team to approach them to further discuss the study.  
Finally, contact information of the research team is listed on the card.   
We
 will adapt our highly successful protocol utilized in the SUSTAIN study to identify, approach, and 
recruit subjects for the SUCCEED study.  As stated earlier, a potential subject’s clinician need to obtain verbal permission from them before passing thei r name to a member of the research team.   
In t
he inpatient setting, we have found that embedding the RA within the inpatient team during rounds 
fosters awareness about the study and prompts the study team during rounds to verbally ask patients 
for permis sion for the RA to meet the patient later.   
12  
           
In the outpatient setting, clinicians would notify the site PI, who attends the clinic.  The Site PI then 
contacts the research team RA. Because outpatients may need to leave the clinic immediately after 
the  vi sit with the clinician, the RA may not be able to speak to outpatients before they leav e, but they 
will be enabled to call the patient at a later time.   
Alternatively, potential s ubjects can also  directly ca ll the RA usi ng the toll -free number l isted on flyers t o 
learn mor e about t he RCT.   
4.3.2  Procedures (e.g., maintaining a screening log at each clinical site) for documenting how subjects 
learned about the trial, who referred them to the trial, reasons for ineligibility, and reasons for 
nonparticipation of eligible subjects.  
Please refer to section 4.3.3 for procedures on consent , documenting how subjects learned about the 
trial, who referred them to the trial, reasons for ineligibility, documentation of ineligibility , and reasons 
for nonparticipation of eligible subjects. A description of how this information will be collected centrally and used to enhance subject recruitment efforts is also provided.  
4
.3.3 Consent (and assent) procedures  
Interaction between the RA and the potential research subject  
•Arranging initial meeting : When a clinician notifies the RA a face- to-face meeting will be arranged to
check whether the patient meets eligibility criteria for enrollment  and to describe elements require d
f
or informed consent .  The RA will read an IRB -approved script that further describes t he
S
UCCEED trial to the patient.
If
 a potential subject directly contacts the RA using the toll -free number, the RA will read the IRB -
approved script that further describes the SUCCEED trial to the patient.  If the potential subject is
interested, a face- to-face meeting will be scheduled.
•Setting: The consent process will take place in a private room .  If the meeting takes place in a
s
hared hospital room, the research staff member will close the curtain when meeting with t he
par
ticipant.   The RA will describe the study.  RA will be bilingual in English or Spanish, but in th e
c
ase that a subject speaks a language other than English or Spanish, the research team will us e
v
olunteers fluent in the appropriate language to translate for the RA.
•Eligibility: If interested in continuing, the RA wil l ask potential subjects questions about age, an d
ons
et of stroke to confirm eligibility.  They will also take BP measurements.  Finally, they will ask
questions that require comprehending the basics details of the study.  If participants cannot
describe what is told to them, they will not be enrolled in SUCCEED.  For potential subjects found to
be ineligible, the reasons for ineligibility will be recorded.
•Voluntary consent: The RA will ensure that eligible subjects are given every opportunity ask
questi ons, and remind the patients that participation in SUCCEED is voluntary.  If interested, th e
pot
ential subject will sign the written consent form. Potential participants will have the opportunity t o
t
ake the consent document home and discuss participation with others before making a decision.
•Declining consent: If patients do not consent to the study, the RA will record the reason why th e
pat
ient did not consent. Further, the RA will ask permission to use the demographic information of
the patient to generate enrollment propensity weights.  Enrollment propensity weights will be us ed
t
o analyze how the tendency to participate in the RCT impacts attainment of outcomes.
•Storing consent forms.  The consent forms at each site will be stored in a locked  file cabinet within a
locked room.  Access is limited to the site’s Principal Investigator and research staff.
13 
For
 the baseline survey, the RA will enter the circumstances of the initial visit (inpatient/outpatient, 
whether clinical team called RA or subject, reasons for ineligibility, and reasons for nonparticipation).  
These data will be summarized in a monthly report by site and shared among the Task Force and the research teams at UCLA and at each site.   
4.3
.4 Procedure for obtaining intervention group assignment  
Before the RCT begins, we will use computer -assisted stratified randomization of block size of 4.  The 
three stratification variables will be site, spoken language (Spanish, English or other), and type of 
stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic).  These lists have an allocation ratio of 1:1 of control and intervention.  
Permuted block randomization that stratifies by site will be used to promote periodic balance through the trial and group balance at the end of the trial.  The study programmer/anal yst will generate 24 lists, 
one for each stratum .  Each row of the list will include a unique subject IDs and intervention arm of the 
study.  The lists will be kept in a notebook that the Project Coordinator will possess at all times .   
For
 patients who consent to the study and meet inclusion criteria, the RA will collect baseline data 
(described below in section of Outcome Measures) before randomization so that the RA will collect data uniformly regardless of the eventual allocation of the subject.  After  an eligible participant has 
consented and completed the baseline survey, the RA will inform the Project Coordinator with the 
information  needed to choose which of the 24 lists to use.  The Project C oordinator will find the next 
uncrossed row,  tell the RA the unique subject ID and intervention assignment, then cross out that row 
so that the next row will be used when this list is used again.   
The P
roject Coordinator will assign the newly enrolled participant a unique subject ID and inform the 
RA the assigned randomization status of this subject.  The Project Coordinator will mark down in the 
notebook the date of randomization for that subject ID.    
Efficiency and productivity metrics such as tracking the effectiveness and outcomes of recruit ment 
strategies employed  
We have the data to determine the enrollment ratios.   
•Numerator: we have developed tracking databases for the RAs to record the number of approached
patients per month.  They further document the reason for ineligibility among subjects.  For eligiblesubjects, the RAs further document which patients consent or decline to p articipate, and for those
that decline, the reasons for not participating.
•Denominator: On a periodic basis, administrators at the LAC -DHS run reports for the SUSTAIN
team that show the number of patients hospitalized at each site per month.
Usin
g our tracking databases and the LAC -DHS reports, we can calculate the proportion of hospitalized 
stroke patients approached by our research team and the proportion of eligible stroke patients who consent to participate in the study.  This will allow us to d iscern when and where and why study 
enrollment rates are lower than expected.   
Thes
e enrollment statistics will be shared among the research team and the Task Force.  If rates of 
participating are lower than expected at a site, we will investigate the reasons for doing so and develop 
strategies for overcoming barriers.  This feedback  loop has been critical for developing our successfully 
recruitment strategy in SUSTAIN.

6.2 Timing of Evaluations  
6.2.1  Pre-Randomization Evaluations  
*Please note: All  evaluations occur prior to the subject receiving any study interventions.
Screening ,  Entry Surveys, and Randomization  
Screening for inclusion/exclusion criteria, baseline (entry surveys), and randomization occur in the 
same face- to-face encounter.   
6.2.2  On-Study /On-Intervention Evaluations  
See Section 6.1 for the schedule of evaluations occurring after randomization while the subject is on-study .  The allowable window for evaluations during the on- intervention period is one month around 
each timepoint.   
6.2.3  Intervention Discontinuation Evaluations  
If patients wish to withdrawal from the study prematurely, we will attempt to administer the final 
outcome measurement survey.  Additionally, the reason for discontinuation will be recorded.   
Re
tention  of subjects will be enhanced by collecting multiple phone numbers and addresses for each 
subject and multiple phone numbers for a close friend and family member.   
6.2.4  On Study/Off- Intervention  Evaluations  
The evaluation schedule remains the same while the subject is “off intervention/on study”  for 
SUCCEED (see Section 6.1) . 
6.2.5  Final On-Study Evaluations  
The schedule of activities during the final 12 month measurement time point  is the same as the 
baseline and 3 month time points , with the difference being that there is no need to conduct the 
randomization procedures other than the baseline time points .   
After the study is completed, we will call the subjects every 6 months for up to 30 months after 
randomization to conduct surveillance of vascular events and ascertainment of mortality.   
6.2.6  Off-Study Requirements  
Once the subject has completed the protocol -specified period on study intervention, they will be follow -
up with every 6 months for up to 18 months for the occurrence of vascular events and death. Refer  to 
Section 6.1. 
6.2
.7  Pregnancy  
Women who become pregnant while on- study, will be instructed to continue their normal care. No 
additional evaluations are needed.   
6.3 Special Instructions and Definitions of Evaluations  
6.3.1  Informed Consent  
The pa tient education and informed consent process has been detailed in Section 4.3.3. Further, plans 
review of consent document in case changes may be required and how documentation of signed consent will be maintained by the study  are outlined in that section. 
A m
odel informed consent form should has been included as Appendix.  When developing the consent 
form, consider including language allowing for the retention of study data and specimens beyond the 
18  
       
close of this study, for sharing the de-i dentified data and spec imens with other researchers, and for 
using the specimens for purposes  beyond the scope of this  study.

6.3.7  Clinical Assessments  
Because NINDS strongly encourages investigators to make use of the NINDS Common Data Elements 
in developing the CRFs (see http://www.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov/ ), the study team will rely 
on those materials  in the development of CRFs for SUCCEED. 
B
lood Pressure (BP):  Participants are seated quietly for 5 minutes before Blood Pressure (BP) 
reading are initiated. Staff are trained to ensure that the proper cutoff size is used and that the 
participant’s arm is resting on a flat surface, with the BP cuff at heart level. Two sequential readings will be taken using the OMRON 90XL with 5 minute intervals between each reading. If the first two readings 
differ by more than 5mmHg, then an additional two readings are taken and recorded electronically using a laptop based data entry system developed through Core A. Average BP is calculated by the data collection system.  
N
IHSS and disability scales: Each RA will obtain certification to perform the National Institute of 
Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the modified Rankin scale prior to the start of the study.  These are 
measures of stroke severity and disability.  Certification is obtained by completing the following courses 
and taking a test by scoring an online video of a patient.   
http://nihss -english.trainingcampus.net/uas/modules/trees/windex.aspx  and  
http://rankin -english.trainingcampus.net/uas/modules/trees/windex.aspx?res . 
In addition, the RA will be observ ed by the site PI for at least the first two study participants.  Each RA 
will be re -observed examining a study participant 2 months later, then 4 months later.   
6.3.8  Laboratory Evaluations  
LDL Cholesterol: Point -of-service CardioChek meters will be used to collect information on LDL 
cholesterol. The meters require only a small capillary blood sample (from a fingerprick). After cleaning the end of one finger with an alcohol wipe, a small lancet is used to prick the participant’s finger. The 
first blood spot is wiped off with gauze and the next blood spot is dropped into a special cartridge which is then simply inserted into the CardioCHek meter for the calculation of LDL cholesterol. Staff will 
record results electronically using the laptop- based data entry system.  
19  
  
Glycosylated Hemoglobic (HgA1c) and C-R eactive Protein (CRP): We will use dried blood spots 
(DBS) t o obtain assa ys for these two parameters.  Whatman 903 Protein Saver filter paper i s used for 
DBS c ollection; t his paper i s commercially av ailabl e as sm all cards.  Participants s hould be well

ANAGEMENT OF ADVERS E EXPERIENCES 
•Elder Abuse : Under California law, all healthcare employees are mandated to report elder abuse.  If abuse
is suspected during your encounter with the patient, the site PI will be contacted.
•Elevated Blood Pressure : If the subject experiences elevated blood pressure that meets the followin g
c
riteria, the following steps should be taken:
oIf ≥ 140 – verbally inform the subject that their BP is at least 140 and give a card to the subject wit h
th
e reading.
oIf ≥ 180 – inform the subject that they must see their doctor immediately. If the subject does not
have a primary doctor, the patient must go to the emergency room.
•Suicide :  Although the subject will not be asked specific questions regarding suicidality, if the subject
expresses suicidal ideation or states they are thinking about harming themselves or have recently
attempted to do so, the site PI will be contacted.

8 CRITERIA FOR INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATIO N 
If a patient has optimal control of all risk factors, the criteria for discontinuing intervention are met, but that 
participant will still remain a part of the study.   
22 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
9.1 General Design Issues  
The primary and secondary hypotheses is that subjects randomized to the intervention arm will have better 
control of risk factors and higher rates of adoption of healthy lifestyle habits compared to the control arm.   
A
ll outcomes will be collected by a blinded RA.  Vascular events will be collected by patient self -report and will 
not require an adjudication committee.   
T
he design is a RCT, 1:1 allocation to control and intervention arms.  There is no crossover. 
R
andomization is stratified by site (4), language (3: English, Spanish, other), and type of stroke (2: 
ischemic/TIA, hemorrhagic).  There are 24 strata.    
I
ntervention on period is up to 12 months for persons.  It may be discontinued if subjects optimally control risk 
factors.   
A
fter the 12 month study period, subjects will be monitored by telephone for the presence of vascular events 
and mortality.  There is no face- to-face contact, and thus, no collection of SBP, the primary endpoint.  This 
surveillance is to better determine the impact of the intervention in the first 12 months after randomization.

9.3 Sample Size and Accrual  
P
ower Analysis  
Power Analyses was conducted with comparison of main outcomes ( systolic blood pressure (SBP))  between 
the control and intervention arms. Based on availability of patients and our capacity, w e plan to enroll 500 
subjects from four senior centers.  Using I ntra-class correlation (ICC) of the four centers at 0.0085 level, attrition 
after the baseline  between 20% to 30% level, mean SBP 141 mm Hg and standar d deviation (SD) 20, three 
repeated measurements: baseline, 3 months, and 12 months  (Brown and Prescott 2006), the underlying 
23  
  
statistical power of the study  comes  from two dimensions of observations: the number of unique subjects and 
the number of repeated measurements within a subject. Based on sample size and power analyses method 
proposed by D iggle et al. ( 1994) and Li u et al. ( 2005) for r epeated measures analysis w ith a t ype I e rror o f 
0.05, type II er ror of 0.2 (or equivalent t o power of 80%),  2.6 and 2.4 average data points f or eac h subject 
(corresponding t o 20% an d 30% at trition r espectively), a nd an auto- correlation at 0. 2 level, t he effective 
sample si ze will b e 147 and 147 o ut of t he planned 250 and 25 0 participants i n each of the 2 arms ( after 
adjustin g for cl ustering e ffect), w hich will e nable us t o detect a n effect  size for S BP as sm all as 0. 215 in 
standard deviation u nits or 4 .29 mm H g (for 2 0% attrition), and 0.253 in standard deviation u nits or 5.06 mm 
Hg (for 30% a ttrition).  
The seminal w ork for m oderator an d mediator effect  was from B aron and Kenny ( 1986). F or potential 
moderators ( e.g., age, gender, s troke  type and severity,  education, co untry o f birth/primary l anguage), w e will 
test power o f moderation using t he most  common measure of effect  size f2 (Aiken & West, 20 01), w hich equals 
the u nique varianc e explain ed by t he interaction t erm di vided by su m of t he error a nd interaction variances.  
Cohen (1988) has s uggested that f2 effect  sizes of 0. 02, 0. 15, a nd 0.35 are termed sm all, m edium, a nd large, 
respectively.  A more realistic st andar d for e ffect si zes w ith m oderators might be 0 .005, 0. 01, a nd 0.025 for 
small, m edium, and large, r espectively.    
Due t o the low power i n tests  of moderation, t here are greater i nterests i n mediation ov er moderation 
(McClell and & J udd, 1993). T o analyze  power of p otential m ediators ( e.g., s elf-efficacy, self -management, 
social i solation, d epression, p erceived risk  of st roke), w e will use indirect effect, w hich is the product  of 
coefficient from i ndependent va riable to mediator, and mediator t o the outcome. Becaus e an indirect effect  is a 
product of two effects, t he us ual C ohen (1988) s tandards of . 1 for sm all, .3 for m edium, and .5 values sh ould 
be squared. T hus, a sm all effect  size woul d be .01, m edium w ould .09, and large would be .25 ( or we can use  
small .02, medium . 15, an d large .40.)  
The effect  size for S BP as small as 0. 215 in standar d deviation units or 4 .29 mm H g (for 20% at trition), a nd 
0.253 i n standar d deviation units or 5 .06 mm H g (for 30% attrition) ca n be considered cl inically m eaningful i n 
the pr esent o f both moderators a nd mediators.  Thus, the pl anned sample size shoul d be su fficient for 
analyses. 
9.4 Data M onitoring 
For C are Management s tudies s uch as t his proposed study,  a Data S afety  Monitori ng Board (DSMB) i s not 
usually r equired. H owever, sh ould NINDS r equir e a DSMB, we will establish  an Internal DSMB for t his m inimal 
risk study. Care coordinators w ill be monitoring risk factor c ontrol a nd resource  utilization o f subjects 
randomized to the intervention.  Care coordinators w ill be making m ultiple telephone calls  about c oordination of 
care.  They w ill ask  subjects a bout the steps t hey are taking to lower t he risk  of st roke.   
ClinicalTrials.gov Re quirements 
This t rial does not m eet the FDAAA r equirement for m andated registration i n ClinicalTrials.gov because it d oes 
not involv e a drug, bi ologic, or device.  However, we d o plan to re gister t his trial o n ClinicalTrials.gov.   Such  
registration i s require d for findings t o be published i n many m edical j ournals,  and it co uld also  serve to 
enhance  the disseminatio n of t he trial’s r esults.   
9.5 Data Analyses 
Baseline characteristics  between the SU CCEED intervention a nd usual c are groups w ill be compared. 
Continuous variable means w ill be compar ed using t he t-test and or dinal or n on G aussian continuous va riables 
will be compar ed using the Wilcoxon rank s um test. U nordered ca tegorical v ariables w ill be compared using 
Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test.  
24  
   
Enrollment weights based on a logistic regression model will be calculated using demographic data c ollec ted 
from eligible non-p articipants.  If needed, attrition weights will be determined from logistic  regression models 
using demographic data on participants who drop out of the study.  These two weights will be combined to 
form an overall weight (us ing the inverse of the product of the probabilities of participation).  Both raw and 
adjusted rates using the ov erall weight will be compared between SUCCEED and usual care arms .   
Intenti on to t reat analyses on all primary a nd se condary o utcomes w ill be conducted using or dinal l ogistic or 
multiple linear r egression models,  incorporating the overall w eight.  Intervention status w ill be an independent 
variable i n all m odels.   We will c ompare study o utcomes betwe en the control a nd intervention gr oups bo th with 
and without a djusting for potential co variates a ssociated with the outcome measure.   
We will test  the moderator a nd mediator effects se parately.  To assess  the moderating e ffects,  we will compare 
regression models w e fit i ncluding i nteracti on terms be tween the independent v ariables a nd each possible 
effect  modifier, a nd the models that do not i nclude t he corresponding i nteraction t erms,  using the l ikelihood 
ratio test  (LRT). T o ass ess the mediating e ffects,  we will use  Baron and Kenny ( 1986) m ethods to r un a series 
of regressi on analysis and us e the Sobel t est and Bootstrappi ng to t est m ediating e ffects.  
To check  the fidelity (uptake) o f the SU CCEED intervention, w e will also analyze attendance  at SU CCEED 
clinics  and the number o f telephone co ordinati on of c are calls m ade durin g enrollment.   
Because subjects  will be recruite d from four h ospital syst ems,  there could b e som e underlying intra- site 
correlations of outcome measures i n the collected data, w hich will have potential i mpacts on st atistical 
significant tests o f parameter estimates i n the analyses.  To take  this into account i n our analyses a nd 
modeli ng, robust  standar d errors w ill be calculated using Huber/ White/Sandwich method to ensure valid 
significance testing.  Although we w ill asse ss for the impact  of clustering data structure, w e do not e xpect  a 
large intra- site correlatio n becaus e the three sites ar e part o f the sam e county he althcare system an d we are 
not aware of di fferences o f outcomes by site. Furthermore, we will also  include site dummies in our m odel t o 
control a nd ev aluate t he differences i n parameter estimates,  especially i f there ar e significant variations am ong 
the si tes.     
10 D
ATA COLLECTION, SIT E MONITORING, AND ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPORTING  
10.1 Records to Be Kept  
Linking file  
Each of the four sites will maintain a linking file that includes identifying information (name, address, 
phone number) and the subject ID. These files are for the purpose of subject tracking, and subject 
payment tracking. These files will be password- protected on a designated computer in a locked offi ce 
and only site’s Principal Investigator and research staff will have access to the tracking file. Site’s 
tracking files will not be sent to UCLA. Only the site’s Principal Investigator and research staff will have 
access to the tracking files. Electronic files will be kept until the completion of all data collection and the 
successful creation of the final analytic dataset.  
10.2 Role of Data Management  
10.
2.1 Clinical site responsibilities in data collection and management  
The clinical site responsibilities are to perform the examination, laborator y tests, and the surveys on the 
subject. 
T
hey will then enter the values directly into the web database of outcome measures.  The 
research team will enter a username and password to generate a blank  form for entering 
25 
outcome data.  T he RA will enter the subject ID and the measurements from the examination, 
survey, and laboratory procedures.  Once the data is submitted, the data is not retrievable on 
the internet, but only to the research team at UCLA .  After the data is entered, it is longer 
available to persons at the site.  It will only be accessible at UCLA, the Statistical Center for the 
study.   
10.2.2  Statistical Center responsibilities in data management  
The Statistical Center will a nalyze the data  stored on a UCLA server. No identifiers that will be kept with 
the data, so it is considered anonymous.   
10.3 Quality Assurance  
The central research team at UCLA will periodically conduct site visits to ensure quality assurance, and to 
check if eval uations are collected appropriately . Additionally, the data will be reviewed periodically by the 
central research team at UCLA to audit data for completeness.  
10.4 Adverse Experience Reporting  
Adverse experiences will be reported as required by the IRB at each site.  There are no additional FDA 
regulations because we are not studying a biological agent.  The Manual of Operations will include detailed 
definitions of adverse experiences, a table for grading their severity, and details o f how clinical sites are to 
report them.  
26 
11 HUMAN SUBJECTS  
11.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review and Informed Consent  
This protocol and the informed consent document (Appendix I ) and any subsequent modifications will be 
reviewed and approved by the IRB or ethics committee responsible for oversight of the study.  A  signed 
consent form will be obtained from the subject. The consent form describes  the purpose of the study, the 
procedures to be followed, and the risks and benefits of participation.  A copy of the consent for m will be given 
to the subject, and this fact will be documented in the subject’s record.  
11.2 Subject Confidentiality  
All laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports, and other records that leave the site will be identified only 
by the Study Identification Number (SID) to maintain subject confidentiality.  All records will be kept in a locked file cabinet.  All computer entry and networking programs will be done using SIDs only.  Clinical information will 
not be released without written permission of the subject, except as necessary for monitoring by IRB, the FDA, 
the NINDS, the OHRP, the sponsor, or the sponsor’s designee. HIPAA guidelines for confidentiality and the 
principles of medical ethics will be adhered to during the s tudy.   
11.3 Study Modification/Discontinuation  
The study may be modified or discontinued at any time by the IRB, the N INDS, the OHRP,  or other 
government agencies as part of their duties to ensure that research subjects are protected.  
T
he NIH , and local IRBs have the authority to stop or suspend this trial at any time. This study may be 
suspended or closed if:  
•Accrual has been met
•The study objectives have been met
•The Study Chair / Study Investigators believe it is not safe for the study to continue
•The NIH or FDA suspends or closes the trial
27 
12 PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH FINDINGS  
Publication of the results of this trial will be governed by the policies and procedures developed by the 
Execu tive Committee. Any presentation, abstract, or manuscript will be made available for review by the 
sponsor and the NINDS prior to submission.

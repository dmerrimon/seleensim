16Jul 2019 ConfidentialStudy design:
Study design :  This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled dose -ranging study of 4total daily 
doses of APT -1011 versus placebo in 100adult subjects (≥18years of age) diagnosed with EoE .  
During the single -blind run -in/baseline symptom assessment, the subjects will receive placebo 30 minutes 
after b reakfast and hora somni (HS; at bedtime) .  Four doses of study drug will be administered :  Placebo 
30minutes after breakfast and 1.5mg HSAPT -1011 , 1.5 mg twice daily (BID)(30 minutes after breakfast
and at bedtime ; total daily dose of 3 mg) APT -1011 , Placebo 30 minutes after breakfast and 3 mg HS (at 
bedtime ), and 3 mg BID ( 30 minutes after breakfast and at bedtime; total daily dose of 6 mg) APT -1011, and 
matching placebo administered 30 minutes after breakfast and HS (at bedtime) .  
The 100 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 to receive placebo or one of the active doses into Part 1 of 
the study . As described below, the treatment that a subject receives in Part 2 depends on their histologic 
response status at Week 12. 
Randomization will occur in a double -blind manner using an integrated Interactive Web Response System 
(IWRS), and w ill be stratified by the presence or absence of a history  of or current esophageal stricture and 
history  of a prior positive steroid response to any corticosteroid treatment previously received to treat the 
subject’s EoE captured with demography .
Efficacy (including sustained EoE response and patient -reported outcomes [PRO] ), safety , and PK of 
APT -1011 will be examined.
FLUTE will be conducted in several parts (Screen ing [4 weeks] , followed by a 4 -week single -blind placebo 
run-in and Baseline Sympt om Assessment, and 2 treatment parts [ Part 1 andPart 2]), with a Follow -up Visit 
to occur 2weeks after the final dose of study drug.  The esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to determine 
eligibility must be performed prior to entry into the 4 -week (28 day) single -blind placebo run -in/Baseline 
Symptom Assessment .  To enter the 4-week Baseline Symptom Assessment, the subject must satisfy all 
eligibility criteria including the Global EoE score >3 (Inclusion Criterion # 5), except those to be confirmed 
during this phase ( Inclusion Criterion #7 : evidence of EoE as defined by ≥15 PEAK eosinophils/ high-power 
field [ HPF]; Inclusion Criterion #8: in the daily diary, report episodes of dysphagia ≥3 days per 7 days during 
the last 14 days of the 4 -week Baseline Symptom Assessment ;Inclusion Criterion #9: completion of the 
daily  diary on at least 5 out of each 7 days during the last 14 days of the Baseline Symptom Assessment; and 
Exclusion Criterion #24: aserum cortisol level < 16µg/dL (440nmol/L) at 60 minutes with 
adrenocorticotropic h ormone [ACTH] stimulation test using 250 µg cosyntropin administered 
intramuscularly [i.e., an ab normal result on the ACTH stimulation test] ).  The ACTH stimulation test should 
have been completed before entry  into the 4 -week Baseline Symptom Assessment, however the results of the 
test may be pending .  The subjects will be dispensed placebo along with their electronic diary at the 
beginning of the 4 -week placebo r un-in/Baseline Symptom A ssessment .  
During the 4-week Baseline Symptom Assessment, baseline symptom severity will be determined and the 
ability  of the subject to be compliant with diary entries will be assessed .  The subjects must have ≥15 PEAK 
eosinophils/HPF on their esophageal biopsies to be r andomized .  In order to ensure that a diagnosis can be 
made, a t least 5 -6 biopsies from both the proximal and distal ( ~3 each) should be taken .  The presence or 
absence of a history  of or current esophageal stricture on the EGD along with a history of a pr ior positive 
response to any corticosteroid treatment previously rece ived to treat the subject’s EoE captured with 
demography  will be stratification variables at randomization .  
Following confirmation of these eligibility criteria, eligible subjects may b e randomized as described above.
During treatment, all subjects will return to the site for scheduled visits and for unscheduled visits due to 
significant adverse events or worsening of symptoms including food impaction .  
Definitions of Histologic Response, Histologic Non-response, and Treatment Failure
Response or non -responsive status will be assessed 2 weeks prior to the planned end of treatment for Part 1 
(Week 12), and Part 2(Week s 26 and 52).  
A histologic responder will be defined as a subj ect who achieves a histologic response of ≤6peak 
eosinophils/HPF (as primary determinant) .  HPF will be defined as a standard area of 235 square microns in a 
Adare Pharmaceuticals 5
SP-1011 -002
APT-1011
16Jul 2019 Confidentialmicroscope with 40x lens and 22mm ocular.
A histologic non-responder will be defined as a subject who does not have a histologic response (i.e., do not 
achieve a histologic response of ≤6peak eosinophils/HPF) .  
Subjects who develop food impaction with or without esophageal dilatation ANYTIME during the study will 
be considered treatment failures and complete early termination assessments and exit the study after the 
2-week post -treatment follow -up period .  Subjects who voluntarily withdraw from the study due to 
worsening symptoms before the week 12 evaluation or later in the study will also be considered treatment 
failures .  Every effort should be made to perform an EGD in subjects wishing to withdraw due to worsening 
symptoms .  They also must complete the early termination assessments and exi t the study after a 2 -week 
post-treatment follow -up period .  
Part 1:  Induction (Day 1 to Week 14)
During Part 1, subjects will be treated for 14 weeks with study drug .  At Week 12, the subjects will undergo a 
response assessment, including EGD to assess endoscop icand histologic status .  
Histologic r espon ders and histologic non -responders (at Week 12) will enter Part 2.
Part 2:  Maintenance (Week 14 to Week 52)
In Part 2 , all subjects classified as histologic responders at Week 12 will continue to be treated according to 
the dosing group to which they were randomized for Part 1 .  Subjects may continue on this dose for up to 9 
months after the completion of Part 1 .
Subjects who are histologic non -responders at Week 12 will receive single -blind 3 mg BID in Part 2.
At Week 26, subjects will undergo a response assessment, including EGD to assess histologic response .  
Symptoms will also be assessed .  The 14 days prior to Week 26 will be compared to the 14 days prior to 
Randomization .  All s ubjects who are histologic non -responders will stop treatment at Week 28 and enter the 
2-week follow -up and exit the study .  Histologic responders will continue on the same dose.
Subjects who complete the study  at Week 52 will undergo a response assessment, including EGD to assess 
endoscopic and histologic status .  Symptoms wil l also be assessed .  The 14 days prior to Week 52 will be 
compared to the 14 days prior to Randomization.
Subjects will complete a Follow -up Visit 2 weeks aft er the final dose of study drug . 
Follow -up Visit
Subjects will complete a Follow -up Visit for 1 or more of the following reasons:
Subject with histologic non -response at Week 26 including subjects on single -blind 3 mg BID ;
Subject completed treatment at Week 5 2 (following EGD) ;
Subject experienced an adverse event ( AE)requiring early discontinuation , including food impaction 
requiring EGD;
Subject swith worsening sy mptoms who voluntarily withdraw during the study or who withdraw for any 
reason .
The Follow -up Visit will occur 2 weeks after the subject takes the final dose of study drug.
All subjects m ust have a final EGD within 3 weeks prior to completing the Follow -up Visit unless the subject 
withdraws consent or has a contraindication to EGD .  
Schedules of events for each part of FLUTE are included in the protocol.
Pharmacokinetics 
Sparse PK sampling will be performed to characterize fluticasone propionate ( FP)exposure in the study 
populatio n.  PopPK analysis will be performed on sparse plasma concentration data .  
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected from subjects in all 5dosing groups to maintain the blind .  
Samples collected from subjects in the placebo group will not be analyzed .  Samples collected from the 
subjects on active doses will be analyzed for PopPK results.
For this sparse PK sampling, a pre -dose sample will be collected on Day 1 .  At Week 4, Week 8, and 
Adare Pharmaceuticals 6
SP-1011 -002
APT-1011
16Jul 2019 ConfidentialWeek 12, subjects must fast approximately 8 hours before the scheduled visits and will take their “after 
breakfast” dose as scheduled on the day of the visit ( at the site and 2 samples will be taken during their 
scheduled vi sit:  upon arrival to the site and approximately 1 to 1.5 hours after first sample (immediately 
prior to leaving the site) .  After arrival at the site and once samples for serum cortisol and sparse PK are 
drawn, the subject will eat breakfast and take thei r “after breakfast” dose approximately 30 minutes after 
breakfast .  Site staf f should document the time of the morning dose .  Due to this variability, the sparse PK 
samples are expected to represent a large portion of the 12 -hour post -dosing interval .
Planned n umber of subjects: Approximately 100subjects will be randomized into Part 1 in a 
1:1:1:1:1 fashion stratified by presence or absence of a history of or 
current esophageal stricture and a history of a prior positive steroid 
response to any corticosteroid treatment previously received to treat the 
subject’s EoE .
While both genders will be encouraged to enroll, it is expected that 
approximately 25% of subjects enrolled will be female .  Although 
subjects are allowed to be up to 75 years old , it is expected that 5% of 
enrolled subjects will be geriatric ( ≥65 years) .  
The protocol details the expected number of subjects who will 
participate in each part of the study .
The final analysis for the primary endpoint will be performed when all 
rando mized subjects have completed Week 12of the study.
Diagnosis and main criteria for 
inclusion and exclusion :Inclusion criteria :  
Subjects must satisfy all of the following criteria:
Before entering 4-week Baseline Symptom Assessment
1.Male o r female between ≥18 and ≤75 y ears of age at the time of 
informed consent;
2.Signed the informed consent form (ICF) and willing and able to 
adhere to all study procedures;
3.Diagnosis or presumptive diagnosis of EoE;
Diagnosis of EoE must be confirmed by symptoms, 
histology, and historical documentation of failed treatment 
on ≥8 weeks of high -dose proton pump inhibitors ( PPI), as 
determined by the Investigator .  High-dose PPI is defined as 
20 to 40 mg BID of any marketed PPI, or alternatively this 
total dose administere d once daily ; maintenance doses of 
PPIs are not acceptable .  
Note: Documentation of PPI failure prior to initial diagnosis or by 
documentation of PPI failure at the time of Screening is required .  The 
subjects may be p re-screened but should not be consent ed, sign an ICF, 
or be offered participation in FLUTE if they have not met the diagnostic 
criteria for EoE that requires that they fail an 8 -week trial of high -dose 
PPIs except those whohave taken PPIs for 8 weeks will use the EGD
within the study for this documentation .  The Investigator and potential 
subject must make the decision to complete a PPI trial independent of 
any considerations of the study .  There is insufficient time to do the 
8-week trial w ithin the current study .  Should a subject be consented in 
error and screen fails due to this point, they may be re -screened as 
described in the protocol .  
4.Have a subject -reported history of ≥3 episodes of dysphagia 
(difficulty with food going down or an awareness of the sensation 
of food going down the esophagus )in the 7 days prior to

ingredient .  
For the purposes of this protocol, the term study drug is used to refer to 
any blinded medication administered (i.e., any dosage of APT -1011 or
placebo).
Subjects will be instructed to take the study drug orally, with no water 
or other liquids .  The tablet should be placed in the mouth and 
manipulated with the tongue until it disintegrates completely .  It should 
be swallowed when fully disintegrated, without biting or chewing .  No 
rinsing with water or liquids is to be allowed after administration .
Dosing will occur in the morning (“after breakfast;” ≥30 minutes after 
breakfast) and at bedtime (“at bedtime;” ≥2 hours after the evening 
meal) .  The “at bedtime” dose of study drug will be administered 
immediately prior to sleep, while lying in bed .  All eating, drinking, and 
tooth brushing should be completed prior to dosing.
Study drug will be administered BID (30 minutes after breakfast and at 
bedtime) in all parts of the study. During the placebo run -in, the 
subjects will receive placebo BID .  In the HS groups, the subjects will 
receive placebo in the morning 30 minutes after breakfast and their

Safety variables :
Adverse events
Any AE or concurrent illness experienced by a subject during any portion of FLUTE must be described in 
detail and be fully evaluated by the Investigator .  The Investigator is responsible for recording all AEs 
observed or reported during the study, regardless of causality and/or clinical significance .  
Safety will be assessed by monitoring and recording all treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation , and serious adverse events ( SAEs ).  All TEAEs will be coded using the current 
version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulat ory Activities classification and classified by severity (mild, 
moderate, or severe) .  Relatedness to study drug (related or not related) will be reported for SAEs only by the 
Investigator .  Treatment -emergent adverse events occurring within 3 days of a do se change will be a ttributed 
to the previous dose.
APT -1011 (fluticasone proprionate ODT) a minimally absorbed corticosteroid is expected to act topically in 
the esophagus .  Because of this, there is potential for decreased efficacy if the subject swallows water soon 
after dosing .  Since the use of fluticasone has only been rarely associated with oral candidiasis, there will be 
no need to do swish and spit since this could inadvertently be associated with swallowed water .  
Oral and esophageal candidiasis will however be considered AEs of special interest .  Subjects may remain in 
the study  during the treatment for these AEs .  The Investigator may allow swish and spit 30 minutes after 
dosing for these subjects .  Subjects must be instructed not to swallow the rinsing water .  
Symptoms of hypercorticism (See below) are also AEs of special interest.
Laboratory tests
Routine laboratory tests and assessments will be performed throughout the study, including hematology, 
blood chemistry, urinalysis, and electrocardi ograms ( ECG s).  Clinically significant changes in laboratory 
tests or ECGs will be summarized .  
Physical examination and vital s igns
Physical examinations will be performed to document the baseline condition of the subject and to highlight 
changes related to AEs .  Vital signs will also be assessed, and clinically significant deviations will be 
reported.
Cortisol -related findings

Adare Pharmaceuticals 12
SP-1011 -002
APT-1011
16Jul 2019 ConfidentialAll subjects will undergo a 250 µg ACTH stimulation test during the Screening period .  This test will also be 
administered at Week 12 (Visit 6), Week 26 (Visit 10), and Week 52 (Visit 14) .  It may also be performed in 
the event of clinical symptoms or a low cortisol result.
At all visits (scheduled or unscheduled), specific attention will be given to potential changes related to
corticosteroids, as well as symptoms of hypercorticism (see Appendix 6 ).  Should a subje ct undergo surgery  
or trauma during the study, particular care should be taken in observing subjects for evidence of inadequate 
adrenal response.
If hypercorticism or adrenal suppression are suspected, an adequate work -up should be performed to confirm 
or rule out these findings .  Specifically, to monitor for hypothalamic pituitary adrenal ( HPA )axis suppression 
of potential clinical concern, a 250 µg ACTH simulation test will also be performed after Screening if any of 
the following occur :
During routine laboratory testing completed for the study, the subject has a morning serum cortisol level 
≤5 µg/dL (138 nmol/L) (confirmed by 2 blood draws), including at the last on -treatment visit for a 
subject and, if applicable, Early Termination Visit;
The subject reports sy mptoms of hypercorticism ;
The subject discontinues due to HPA axis suppression .  
An abnormal result for the ACTH stimulation test is defined as serum cortisol level < 16µg/dL (440nmol/L) 
at 60 minutes after treatment with 250 µg c osyntropin administered intramuscularly .  This result is 
exclusionary if it occurs at Screening/ 4-week Baseline Symptom Assessment and requires follow -up through 
recover y of adrenal function if it occurs thereafter .  Treatment for H PA axis suppression is discussion in the 
full protocol .  The Sponsor will provide guidelines for safety follow -up and document of restoration of 
adrenal function in all subjects demonstrating evidence of hypercorticism or HPA axis suppression during the 
course of the study.
Electrocardiogram
Electrocardiograms signs will be assessed, and clinically significant deviations will be reported.
Safety endpoints :  The safety endpoints of interest are: 
Frequency of TEAEs;
TEAEs leading to discontinuation;
Treatment -emergent SAEs;
Percentage of subjects with serum cortisol level ≤5 µg/dL (≤138 nmol/L) or abnormal ACTH stimulation 
test (serum cortisol < 16µg/dL [≤440nmol/L] at 60 minutes);
The number of subjects discontinuing for HPA axis suppression will be recorded .
Frequency of oral and esophageal candidiasis .
Pharmacokinetic variables :  
The following PopPK parameters will be estimated using sparse sampling , as data permit:
Oral clearance;
Volume of distribution.
Additional PopPK parameters will be estimated, as appropriate, bas ed on the final structural PK model .
Statistical methods:
Sample size determination :  Part 1 will include a sample size with a ran ge of 100 subjects, in which 
20patients are randomized to 1.5 mg HS, 1.5 mg BID, 3 mg HS, 3 mg BID, and placebo (1:1:1:1:1) .  Based 
on these randomization ratios, approximately 80 % of all subjects in Part 1 will be treated with an APT -1011 
dosing regimen and approximately 20% of all subjects in Part 1 will be treated with placebo.
Analy sis populatio ns:  
The All Enrolled Popu lation includes a ll subjects who sign an ICF and are enrolled into the study .
The Safety Population includes all subjects who receive ≥1 dose of the study drug .

APT-1011
16Jul 2019 ConfidentialThe Intent -to-treat (ITT) Population includes all subjects randomized .  
oA subject who isenrolled in the study and receive sstudy  drug, but fails to complete treatment will 
be considered a dropout .  
The Sparse PK Subgroup includes all subjects who have ≥1 quantifiable PK sample collected for sparse 
PK evaluations .  
Additional analysis populatio ns (e.g., Per Protocol Populations including subjects who complete Part 1, 
Part2 Weeks 26 and 52 ) may be defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) .
Statistical methodology :  
Subject characteristics
Baseline and demographic information will be summarized using descriptive statistics for continuous and 
ordinal variables (e.g., age , weight and height [Day 1 only] ) and counts and percentages for categorical 
variables (presence or absence of esophageal strictures, prior response to steroids, sex and race ).  Body Mass 
Index (BMI) will be calculated on Day 1.
Primary efficacy analysis for Part 1
Let jbe the Cochran -Mantel -Haenzel common odds ratio comparing treatment vs .  control for histologic 
response for dose j given randomization strata; with j=1,2,3,4 corresponding to APT-1011 3 mg BID, 1.5 mg 
BID, 3 mg HS, 1.5 mg HS doses, respectively .  There are 4 hypotheses corresponding to the 4 active doses, 
which will be tested using a gatekeeping strategy to preserve Type I error for each analysis.
1) Primary  Hypothesis #1
H0: 1≤1
H1: 1≤1
A stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenzel test will be used to test primary hypothesis #1, i.e .,3mg BID vs .  
placebo, using the randomization strata .  If the corresponding one -sided p -value is less than or equal to 0.05,
the null hy pothesis will be rejected, and subsequently the following hypothesis will be tested: 
2) Primary  Hypothesis #2
H0: 2≤1
H1: 2≤1
A stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenzel test will be used to test primary hypothesis #2, i.e .,3mg HS vs .  
placebo .  If the corresponding one -sided p -value is less than or equal to 0.05, the null hypothesis will be 
rejected, and subsequently the following hypothesis will be tested: 
3) Primary  Hypothesis #3
H0: 3≤1
H1: 3≤1
A stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenzel test will b e used to test primary hypothesis #3, i.e .,1.5mg BID vs .  
placebo .  If the corresponding one -sided p -value is less than or equal to 0.05, the null hypothesis will be 
rejected, and subsequently the following hypothesis will be tested: 
4) Primary  Hypothesis #4
H0: 4≤1
H1: 4≤1
A stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenzel test will be used to test primary hypothesis #4, i.e .,1.5mg HS vs .  
placebo .  If the corresponding one -sided p -value is less than or equal to 0.05, the null hypothesis will be 
rejected . 
Note the gatekeeping strategy only allows formal hypothesis testing of 1.5 mg HS or 1.5 mg BID if the 
higher doses meet statistical significance .  Given prior studies with histologic endpoints, there is a strong 
rationale suggesting that higher doses will have a greater benefit on the primary efficacy endpoint of

Efficacy analysis for Part 2
Sustained EoE response will be assessed in subjects who complete both Part 1 and Part 2 and complete 
Week -26 and 52 evaluations .  This will be assessed by the primary endpoint.
Other measures of efficacy will be assessed at Week 26.
Efficacy will be summarized for histologic non -responders from Part 1 who are treated in Part 2 .  
Other measures of efficacy will be assessed at Week 52.
The primary focus of Part 2 will be descriptive in nature.
Secondary and exploratory efficacy analysis
Formal statistical hypothesis testing will be used to evaluate treatment benefit with respect to the reduction in 
number of dysphagia episodes .  For each dose that meets the criterion for statistical significance on the 
primary  efficacy  outcome, a Wilcoxon Rank -Sum test will be used to test whether the reduction in the 
number of dysphagia episodes from baseline is larger for the treatment group compared to the control .  The 
hypothesis to be tested is: 
H0: R1j(x)≤R0j(x)
H1: R1j(x)>R0j(x)
Where R ij(x) is the distribution function for the reduction in number of dysphagia episodes for treatment 
group i(=0 for control, 1 for treatment) and dose j.  Holm’s step -down procedure will be used to control the 
overall Ty pe I erro r at 0.05, where the number of doses considered for inferential testing is equal to the 
number of doses that meet statistical significance for the primary efficacy analysis .  
Statistical tests to compare each APT-1011 dosing group with placebo will be performed for other secondary 
efficacy endpoints, but the corresponding p -values will be considered as descriptive rather than inferential .  
The secondary endpoints will be analyzed via a stratified Cochran -Mante l-Haenzel test for categorical 
endpoints and analysis of covariance or Wilcoxon Rank -Sum tests for change from baseline endpoints, 
except for the endpoint of time to relapse after initiation of double -blind treatment in Part 2, which will be 
analy zed using Kaplan -Meier methods.
As a secondary efficacy analysis, all 4 doses of active treatment will be pooled and compared to placebo with 
a stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenzel test .  Additionally, Bayesian hierarchical modeling will be used for both 
the primary e fficacy endpoint and reduction in number of dysphagia episodes, in which dose -response 
modeling is used to estimate the difference between each active dose and placebo .  Additionally, a logistic 
regression model using both dose and frequency and dose -frequ ency interaction will be used to analyze the 
primary  endpoint .  Subgroup analyses and regression models will also be conducted on primary and key 
secondary endpoints to assess regional effects and relationships with demographics (age, gender, race, 
ethnici ty, PPI status, and strata variables).
Safety analyses
The incidence of TEAEs will be summarized by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term .  Separate 
summaries by maximum severity (all AEs) and relationship to study drug (SAEs only) will be provided .  The 
incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation from the study and treatment -emergent SAEs will also be 
summarized .  In subjects who change dosing groups, the TEAEs will be attributed to actual dose at the time 
oftheevent.
Clinically significant cha nges of potential clinical interest in clinical tests will be summarized including 
hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, ECG, cortisol, vital signs, and bone mineral density .  No statistical testing 
of safety endpoints will be performed .  Shift tables may be produced, if needed .  The number of subjects 
discontinuing due to HPA axis suppression or positive ACTH stimulation tests will be summarized .  
Population pharmacokinetics
A PopPK analysis will be performed based on sparse plasma concentration data .  It will be performed using 
the nonlinear mixed -effects software, NONMEM, Version 7.2.0 or later or other appropriate nonlinear 
mixed -effects modeling software .  The structural PK model will include oral clearance and volume of

2.1 Eosinophilic Esophagitis
Eosinophilic esophagit is (EoE) i s a chronic, immune -mediated, antigen -driven esophageal 
clinicopathologic disorder characterized by an eosinophilic -predominant inflammatory  process.1  
It appears to represent a spectrum of disease that progresses from being predominant ly 
characterized by  inflammat ion to being predominant ly characterized by stricture.
While EoE was init ially described in 1978, i t reached wi despread awareness only  in the past 
15years.2  The disease is most prevalent in young, male Caucasians fro m urban or suburban 
areas .  It exhibits seasonal variat ions in incidence, suggest ing that both genetic and 
environmental factors may  play a rol e in the pathophysio logy.3  The overall prevalence of EoE is 
25.9 per 100,000 populat ion in the U nited States (US) .  Of this popul ation, approximately  38% 
are female, approximately 10% are elderly, and approximately 16% are children under 18 years 
of age.4  
Updated gui delines for di agnosi s from the 2013 American College of Gastroenterology  Clinical  
Guideline5indicate that EoE is a clinicopatho logic disorder ,taking into account clinical and 
pathol ogical informat ion without param eters interpreted in isolat ion.  The fo llowing parameters 
are considered :
Clinical symptoms related to esophageal dysfunction ;
Eosinophil -predominant inflammat ion on esophageal biopsy, with peak esophageal mucosal 
eosinophil count per hi gh-power fi eld (HPF ; standard area of 23 5square microns; 40x 
magnificat ion[0.3 mm2])number ≥15, shorten to peak eosinophils/HPF in this protoco l;
oThis is defined as the peak eosinophils /HPF number in ~3 biopsies obtained from each 
the proximal and distal esophagus ( 5-6 total biopsies );
Mucosal  eosinophilia is confined to the esophagus and persists after a trial o f proton pump 
inhibitors ( PPIs).  
The m ajority of adolescents and adults present clinically with dysphagia and/or food impaction .  
Since pat ients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) have overlapping symptoms and 
may also have EoE, it is important to rule out GERD in the evaluat ion of patients with suspected 
EoE using a trial o f PPIs.

16Jul 2019 ConfidentialDue to the overlapping symptoms with GERD, there is frequent ly considerable delay in 
diagnosis in both children and adults .  The typical delay in diagnosis of EoE could give the false 
impression that the disease is different in adults when in fact the delay in diagnosis may  just lead 
to an apparent ly more progressive disease in adults .  Adults also are more able to adapt to 
dysphagia by m odifying thei r food choi ces, including food consistency , com pared with children; 
this case further delay diagnosis in adult s.  A review of untreated pediatric pat ients as y oung 
adults suggests that stricture in adults could be a result of lack of treatment in childhood.27
Consequences of EoE include dysphagia, tissue remodeling , food impact ion, spontaneous 
perforation of the esophagus, and food intolerance and avo idance; the last consequence is 
especially  comm on in the pediatric populat ion.  Tissue remodeling of the esophagus is part of the 
inflammatory  process in EoE, akin to the airway remodeling in asthma.6  Such remodeling leads 
to fibrosis and esophageal structural changes, including strictures, which affect most patients 
with EoE.7Food impact ion, which may  be associ ated wi th rings and strictures, has been 
commo nly reported in both adul ts and children wi th EoE .  While the majorit y of food impacti on 
episodes are relieved by  swall owing water or by  regurgi tation, 30% to 55% of a dults requi re 
emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy  (EGD) to remove the food bolus with forceps.8,9  In 
children, vo miting, food intolerance ,and avo idance are commo n, wi th failure to thrive occurring 
in 5% to 19% of patients .10  Malnutrit ion associ ated wi th EoE has not been documented.11
Dysphagia and food impact ion, which are ty pical in adul ts, do not ty pically  appear unt il 
adolescence.14
While concerns have been raised about a possible increased risk of cancer due to the chronic 
inflammat ion that occurs in EoE, this potential risk has not been validated .  There are also no 
data to suggest that EoE progresses to a mor e extensive eosinophilic disorder .  
2.2 Current Therapeutic Options
The goal of treatment is to resolve symptoms of esophageal inflammat ion and to prevent 
complicat ions, such as strictures, that lead to food impact ion.  The only widely advocated 
nonpharmaco logical approach is a food eliminat ion diet that eliminates all intact protein by 
administering an amino acid -based form ula to patients with known food allergies.10  Another 
dietary  approach i s the use of the Six Food Elimination Diet (SFED) that eliminates cow’s milk 
protein, soy , peanuts, wheat, egg, and seafood .  After a patient has responded, the eliminated 
foods are re -introduced 1 by  1 to determin e which are responsible for symptoms .  In 1study , this 
diet had demonstrated efficacy comparable wit h the elemental diet in children at a lower cost and 
improved compliance.12  The SFED has recently been tested in adults with posit ive results.18  
Notably pat ient compliance with the severely restricted diet is poor, and this approach also 
requi res m ultiple endoscopies to assess the esophagus with each change in diet .  As such, this a 
dietary  approach has not been widely adopted in adults.

16Jul 2019 ConfidentialCurrent ly, there are no pharmaco logical treatments approved by the Food and Drug 
Administrati on (FDA) for pati ents wi th EoE, but there are several current ly in clinically 
development .  The m ost wi dely used drug treatm ent is topi cal corticosteroi ds delivered via
metered dose inhalers, including flut icasone propionate (FP) and budesonide .  Such treatment s
requi re that pati ents utilize a nasal formulat ion of corti costeroi d orally  (i.e., spray  medicat ion 
into the m outh and swallow) .  Addit ionally, there is a limit to the dose that can be practically  
administered by  this route .  Due to lack of regulatory  approval  for the EoE indication, patients 
may experience insurance and reimbursement issues if they do no t have concurrent asthma .  
Systemic corti costeroi ds are used for the most severe cases of EoE .1,19There are significant 
concerns about corticosteroi d side effects wi th long-term treatm ent wi th systemic corti costeroi ds.  
When corti costeroi ds are discont inued, the disease ty pically  recurs and re -treatm ent is requi red.10  
Proton pum p inhibitors do also have so me efficacy in so me pat ients with EoE; the term  
“PPI -responsive EoE" is use d to describe such pat ients.16, 27
In ad dition to corti costeroi dsand PPIs in so me pat ients, small studi es examining the use of other 
drugs directed towards the immune react ions thought to underlie EoE have been conducted ; 
these have shown variable or no effects .  Therefore, there is a significant unmet medical need for 
patients wi th EoE, an orphan disease associated with significant morbidit y.

assessed at the time of relapse .  Subjects with relapse underwent EGD at that time (rather than at 
theend of the study ).  At relapse, subjects could receive rescue therapy  (i.e., standard of care ).
Fourteen (58%) subjects who were considered responders at the complet ion of Study  PR-021 
enrolled into Study PR -022.  Ten subjects who enrolled into Study  PR-022 had been included in 
an act ive dosing group in Study  PR-021.  Based on the Invest igator ’sindependent assessment, 
1subject at Week 8 and no subjects after Week 12 were assessed as ongo ing responders to the 
prior treatment with APT -1011 .  All 6males and 8females co mpleted Study  PR-022.  
There were no post -treatm ent adverse events o f special interest (AESIs), such as symptoms or 
signs of  hypercorti cism or adrenal  insufficiency ,that led to discont inuat ionfrom the study  and 
no serious adverse e vents (SAEs) .  No event occurred in more than 1subject .  No events were 
judged to be treatment related and events were generally mild in severit y.
2.4.3 Study PR -023
Study  PR-023 was a Phase 1 open -label, rando mized, parallel -group study  to eval uate the 
pharmac okinet ics(PK) , pharm acodynamics (PD) , safet y,and tol erabili ty of APT -1011 
administered orally at a dose of 3 mg BID or 6 mg QD for 4 days.  Plasma PK of FP was 
evaluated at steady -state foll owing treatm ent wi th either 3 mg BID or 6 mg QD APT -1011 .  The 
effect of food ingest ion 30 minutes prior to a single 6 -mg dose of APT -1011 was also explored .  
Safety, tolerabilit y, and h ypothal amic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis funct ion (as assessed by the 
cumulative cortiso l suppressio n)were al so assessed.
Following repeat -dose administration of APT -1011 (3 m g BID or 6 mg QD), apparent steady -
state exposure of FP was attained within 4 days .  There was no discernible difference between 
steady -state sy stemic exposure of APT -1011 at these 2 dosing regimens .  Systemic exp osure of 
FP waslow following administrati on of  (swallowed )FP at a total daily dose of 6 mgAPT -1011 .  
These data are consistent with a reported oral bioavailabilit y of FP of <1%.  
Administrati on of APT -1011 following a hi gh-fat meal wasassoci ated wi th a decrease in both
area under the plasma concentration time curve, from time 0 to the 24 hours post -dose
(AUC (0-24h)) and the maximum concentration (C max) of FP observed after administration , 
indicat ing that food influences the absorption of oral FP .  Administrati on of  APT -1011 wi th food 
was associated with a 41% decrease in AUC (0-24h)for the full study  populati on.  These 
differences in the fed and fasted scenarios were not expected to be clinically  meaningful .
Since steady -state was achieved within 4 days, the observed steady -state effects on cortiso l levels 
(reflect ing HPA axis suppressio n) could be determined during the study  period.  At Day  5 
(steady -state), m ean serum  cortisol  suppressio n was 5.51% (QD regimen) and 10.8% (BID

cortisol, but the trend for urinary  cortisol  changes was similar .  On Day  5 (steady -state) ,mean 
urinary  corti sol suppression was 1.1% (QD regimen) and 16% (BID regimen) compared wi th 
Day 0. 
APT -1011 was generally  well -tolerated under the dosing condit ions (fasted and fed) and 
regimens (3 mg BID and 6 mg QD APT -1011 for 4 day s) invest igated .  Four subjects 
experienced a total  of 6 TEAEs during the repeat -dose period of the study .  No TEAEs w ere 
experienced during the period in which the effect of food was studied .  There were no AESIs, 
AEs leading to discont inuat ion, or SAEs .  
2.5 Study Rationale and Risk -Benefit Analysis 
The purpose of FLUTi casone in Eosinophilic esophagit is (FLUTE) is to exam ine 4total daily  
doses of APT -1011 to define the exposure -response of APT -1011 and the minimum effect ive 
dose while minimizing any clinically significant HPA axis effects .  
The current therapeutic landscape for EoE is described in Sect ion2.2.  APT -1011 is expected to 
offer the fo llowing advantages for pati ents wi th EoE:  
Oral administrati on is generally more acceptable and more reliable in terms of accurate dose 
administration .  Currently , the only available formulat ion of FP is a metered dose inhaler that 
is sprayed into the mouth and swallowed by the patient.  
Oral administrati on of  APT -1011 has very  low bi oavailabilit y (see Secti on 2.4.3 ) even 
compared wi th similar com pounds such as budesonide, which further reduces its potenti al for 
systemic corticosteroid toxicit y, while i t may be more potent on a mg basis . 
The current study  represents the first dose -ranging study of APT -1011.   Given its low 
bioavailabilit y, it is consi dered unlikely  that APT -1011 will have any  significant systemic 
corticosteroi d effects.  However, these will be carefu lly monitored (see Section 6.3.4 ).
Selection of doses for FLUTE is discussed in detail in Sect ion 5.5.  The selected doses are 
largely  based on the resul ts of studi es discussed in Section 2.4and published informat ion for 
other formulat ions of FP.  
In term s of risk -benefit considerat ions, w hile the safet y profile o f APT -1011 i s preliminary , that 
for FP has been reported for a variet y of approved formulat ions.  This includes liquid for o ral 
inhalat ion (Flo vent® HFA) ;26powder for oral inhalat ion (Flo vent® Diskus) ;suspensio n for 
intranasal insufflat ion (Flo nase®) ; and cream , lotion ,and ointment for dermatologic use
(Cutivate®) .  Due to the substant ially lower systemic exposure expected following oral dosing 
Adare Pharmaceuticals 34
SP-1011 -002
APT-1011
16Jul 2019 Confidentialwith APT -1011 (see Section 5.5), it is expected that APT -1011 will have a more favorable safet y 
profile co mpared with inhaled Flo vent® HFA.
Based on published studies of FP, several precaut ions should be noted until the safet y profile of 
orally  administered APT -1011 is esta blished.26Most important ly, subjects treated with FP 
shoul d be carefully observed for any  evidence of systemic corti costeroi d effects or clinically 
significant suppressio n of the HPA axis .  Particular care should be taken in observing subjects 
post-operatively  or during peri ods of  stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response .  Side 
effects associated with HPA axis suppressio n will be captured in a specific electronic case report 
form (eCRF) and morning cortisol, serum glucose, and urine glucose will be monitored 
throughout FLUTE .  Adrenocorti cotropi c horm one ( ACTH )testing will also be performed . 
In addit ion to concerns regarding cor tisol-related findings, the IB includes warnings , precauti ons, 
and a list of possible AEs .  Other expected safet y risks for APT -1011 include the de velopment of 
candidiasis of the mouth and/or throat due to local exposure of the oral and pharyngeal mucosa . 
Moreover, subjects taking medicat ions that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to 
infect ions than healthy individuals .  For example, chickenpox and measles can have a more 
serious or even fatal  course in suscept ible children or adults using co rticosteroi ds.  As such, 
subjects who have not previously contracted these diseases or have not been properly immunized 
shoul d take parti cular care to avoi d exposure .  APT -1011 should be used with caut ion in 
individuals with active or qui escent tubercul osis infect ion of the respiratory  tract ; untreated 
systemic fungal, bacterial, viral or parasit ic infect ions; or ocular herpes simplex.  How the dose, 
route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect sthe risk of developing a disseminated 
infect ionis not known .  
Due to the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, individuals who have 
experienced recent oropharyngeal ulcers, oropharyngeal surgery , or oropharyngeal  traum a 
shoul d not use APT -1011 until healing has occurred.  
Since EoE typically rel apses f ollowing the discont inuat ion of treatment, it is expected that FP in 
the form  of APT -1011 woul d be used for extended periods of time.  Some subjects have received 
inhaled FP on a continuous basis in a clinical study for up to 4 years .  In clinical studies wit h 
subjects treated for 2 years with inhaled FP (Flovent® HFA) , no apparent differences in the ty pe 
or severit y of adverse reactions were observed after long -term versus short -term treatm ent.  
Glauco maincreased intraocular pressur e, and cataracts have been reported in subjects following 
long-term administrati on of  inhaled corticosteroids, including FP.26  Despite these studie s, the 
long-term effects of topi cal FP are not fully known (e.g., impact of chronic use of FP on 
developmental or immunologic processes in the mo uth, pharyn x, trachea, and lung) .  
Although a formal Data Safet y Moni toring Board is not planned, the study  will be monitored 
continuously by  the Medical  Moni tor and Sponsor.  This will be supplemented by  standard 
Adare Pharmaceuticals 35

every 3 m onths.  This frequency  is expected to be adequat e given the projected enrollment rate.
Data areavailable regarding theexploratory efficacy ofAPT -1011 inthetreatment ofEoE in the 
Phase 1b/2a study and ispresented inSecti on2.4.1. 2.  Addit ionally , data from  the interim 
analysis of this 2b FLUTE study  shows that treatm ent wi th APT -1011 at all doses is safe and 
well-tolerated during Part 1 of the study (data not shown) .  The  primary endpo int, that EoE 
histol ogic response rate at Week 12, was met at all APT -1011 doses verses placebo .  The 3 mg 
HS dose has been chosen for future devel opment due to best bal ance between efficacy  and saf ety,
i.e. Benefit: Risk Rat io and the added convenience of once a day dosing.
2.5.1 Rational efor Inclusion of Placebo
Since there are currently no drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment of EoE (i.e., no 
comparator available) and previous studies have demonstrated very  high placebo response rates, 
it is critical to perf orm placebo -controlled studi es to dem onstrate efficacy in EoE.
Due to the high placebo rates, the study  will utilize a 4 -week single -blind placebo run -in period 
to not only  establish the baseline symptoms for the study , but also to ensure that all subjects 
enrolled have sufficient severit y of EoE to warrant inclusio n in the study .
The exposure to placebo will be minimized by ut ilizing a relat ively short (14 -week) induct ion 
period (Part 1).  Addit ionally , the FLUTE study allows su bjects who are non -responsive to thei r 
rando mized study drug including those on placebo to receive in a single -blind fashio n, the 
highest dose of APT -1011 to be studied (3 mg BID) in Part 2, while other subjects remain on 
their current dose .  At Week 26, s ubjects will undergo an EGD with biopsy to assess histologic 
response.  Histologic non -responders will stop treatment and enter the follow -up period and exit 
the study .  Histol ogic responders will continue on the same dose until Week 52 .

4.1 Summary of Study Design
FLUTE is a rando mized, double -blind, pl acebo -controlled dose -ranging study of 4 total  daily 
doses of APT -1011 versus placebo in 100 adul t subjects (≥18years of age) diagnosed wi th EoE .  
During the single -blind run -in/baseline symptom assessment, the s ubjects will receive placebo 
30minutes after breakfast and HS (at bedtime).  APT -1011 will be administered in 4doses:  
Placebo 30 minutes after breakfast and 1.5 m g HS (at bedtime ), 1.5 m g BID ( 30minutes after 
breakfast and at bedtime; total daily  dose of 3 mg), 3 mg HS (at bedtime), and 3 m g BID ( 30 
minutes after breakfast and at bedtime; total daily  dose of 6 mg), com pared wi th matching 
placebo administered 30 minutes after breakfast and HS (at bedtime) .  The randomizat ion 
scheme is discussed in Sect ion4.1.5.2 .  Efficacy ( histol ogical response ), safet y, and PK of 
APT -1011 will be examined. 
FLUTE will enro ll around 100 adult ( ≥18years of age) subjects (see Section 8.1for a di scussio n 
of the potenti al number of subjects to parti cipate in each part).    
FLUTE is planned to be performed at approximately 60 act ivesites in North America (US and 
Canada ) and Western Europe (Belgium , Germ any, Swi tzerlandand Spain ).  
Thestudy  will be conducted in several parts ( Screening, 4-week single -blind placebo run -in and 
Baseline Symptom Assessment, and 2treatm ent parts [Part 1 and Part2]) with aFollow-up Vi sit 
to occur 2weeks after the final dose of study drug . 
Subjects who enter and complete FLUTE will be in the study for up to 62weeks or until the last 
subject completes Week 28 .

Failure
The fo llowing definit ions of histol ogic responders, histol ogic non-responders, and treatm ent 
failures will be used to c lassify subjects as needed throughout the study .  Response or 
non-responsive status will be assessed 2 weeks prior to the planned end of treatment for Part 1 
(Week 12 ) and Part 2 (Weeks 26 and 52 ).
Histologic Responder 
A histol ogic responder will be defined as a subject who achieve sa histol ogic response o f 
≤6peak eosinophils/HPF (as primary  determinant) .  HPF will be defined as a standard area of 
235 square microns in a microscope with 40x lens and 22 mm ocular.

Treatment Failure
Subjects who develop food impaction wit h or without esophageal dilatation ANYTIME during 
the study  will be considered treatment failures and complete early  terminat ion assessments and 
exit the study  after the 2 -week post -treatm ent follow-up period .  Subj ects who vol untarily 
withdraw from  the study  due to worsening symptoms before the W eek 12 evaluation or later in 
the study  will also be considered treatment failures.  Every  effort shoul d be m ade to perform  an 
EGD in subjects wishing to withdraw due to worsening symptoms .  They  also m ust com plete the

repeated.  Histologic non -responders at Week 12 will receive single -blind 3 mg BID in Part 2.
bThe reason for an unscheduled visit will guide procedures, at the discretion of the Investigator.
cThe subject should be seen at the site within 7 days of determination of the need to discontinue.  If this is not possible du e to an SAE or other unforeseen circumstance, it may be 
completed with a phone visit with the subject or a family member.  The eCRF should document why the subject was not available for an on -site visit.
dAs described in Section 4.1.4 , to enter the 4-week Baseline Symptom Assessment, subjects must meet all inclusion criteria including the Global EoE score >3 (Inclusion 
Criterion #5) except those to be assessed during the 4-week Baseline Symptom Assessment ( Inclusion Criterion #7 : evidence of EoE as defined by ≥15 PEAK eosinophils/HPF , 
Inclusion Criterion #8 : in the daily diary, report episodes of dysphagia ≥3 days per 7 days during the last 14 days of the 4-week Baseline Symptom Assessment , Inclusion Criterion

<16 µg/dL (440nmol/L) at 60 minutes with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test using 250 µg cosyntropin administered intramuscularly [i.e., a nabnormal result 
on the ACTH stimulation test] ).  The ACTH stimulation test should have been completed before entry into the 4 -week Baseline Symptom Assessment, however the results of the 
test may be pending.
eConfirmation that the subject meets eligibility criteria includ ethe following to be confirmed during the 4-week Baseline Symptom Assessment:  Inclusion Criterion #7: evidence 
of EoE as defined by ≥15 PEAK eosinophils/HPF, Inclusion Criterion #8: in the daily diary, report episodes of dysphagia ≥3 da ys per 7 days during the last 14 days of the 4-week 
Baseline Symptom Assessment, Inclu sion Criterion #9: completion of the daily  diary on at least 5 out of each 7 days during the last 14 days of the Baseline Symptom Assessment, 
and Exclusion Criterion #24: serum cortisol level < 16 µg/dL (440 nmol/L) at 60 minutes with ACTH stimulation test using 250 µg cosyntropin administered intramuscularly (i.e., 
an abnormal result on the ACTH stimulation test) .  The ACTH stimulation test should have been completed before entry into the 4 -week Baseline Symptom Assessment, however 
the res ults of the test may be pending.
fPhysical examination will include assessments of height at screening (Day  1 only ), weight, general appearance, head and neck, eyes and ears, nose and throat, chest, lungs, heart, 
abdomen, extremities and joints, lymph nod es, skin, and neurological examination.   Body Mass Index (BMI) will be calculated on Day 1 .
gVital signs to be collected include pulse, respiratory rate, temperature (°C; after a 5 -minute rest in sitting position), and blood pressure (measured from the same arm throughout 
the study).
hHIV 1 and HIV 2 will be tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  The following parameters will be used to determine hepati tis B and hepatitis C infection: positive for 
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), total hepatiti s B core antibody (anti -HBc) positive alone if also hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA )positive, or hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) antibody if also HCV ribonucleic acid ( RNA )positive.  Subjects who are positive for hepatitis B surface antibody, but negative for HBsAg and anti -HBc will be 
eligible (also see Section 6.3.2.4 ).
i HbA1C testing is optional for subjects with diabetes to assess le vel of control.  This may be repeated as needed during the study (also see Section 6.3.2.4 ).
jTo be drawn 0700 to 0800 hours, or as close to that window as possible .  Subjects must be fasting for an 8 -hour period prior to the serum cortisol assessments.  Blood may be 
drawn for serum cortisol (morning fasting) ± 3days of scheduled visit to accommodate accurate timing.  If desired, o ther blood draws s cheduled for the visit may be done at the 
same time .  If an ACTH test is scheduled for the visit, the serum cortisol assessment should occur at the same time .  The pre -ACTH cortisol level can serve as the baseline serum 
cortisol level.
kIf abnormal serum cortisol level is reported at the last on -treatment visit for a subject , additional monitoring and ACTH test may be required (see Section 6.3.4 ).  
lSparse PKsamples willbeperformed inallsubjects. Asample willbecollected pre-dose onDay1. AtWeek 4,Week 8,andWeek 12,subjects must fast for 8 hours prior to the 
visit andwill taketheir “after breakfast” dose atthe site and 2samples willbetaken during their scheduled visit: upon arrival to thesiteand1to 1.5hours after firstsample
(immediately prior toleaving thesite). After arrival at the site and once samples for serum cortisol and sparse PK are drawn, the subject will eat breakfast and take 
their “after breakfast” dose approximately 30 minutes after breakfast .  Site staff should document thetime ofthemorning dose. Thetime ofthe“after breakfast” dose
(day oftheplanned visit)andthetime oftheimmediately preceding “atbedtime” dose (evening prior toplanned visit)willberecorded. Actual PKsampling times willbe
documented.
mIt is expected that the EGD will typically be performed during a separate time from other procedures for a given time point .  Both EGD and any other procedures indicated for a 
study  visit must be completed within the window for that study visit.  For Screening, the EGD must be completed after the ICF is signed and ≥2weeks before the date of expected 
randomization.  
nDuring the EGD, the endoscopist will complete the EREFs and ~3biopsies will be obtained from both the proximal and the distal esophagus (total of 5-6biopsies) .  The 
pathologist will assess histology. 
oThe EGD to determine eligibility must be performed before entry into the 4 -week (28 day) single -blind run -in/Baseline Symptom Assessment .  Pathology for EGD biopsies may 
also be assessed during the 4-week Baseline Symptom Assessment (or earlier if possible).
pIf the subject discontinues from the study due to lack of efficacy or other reasons, the Investigator may perform an EGD, if clinically indicated.  
qA serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening and urine pregnancy test s thereafter.  Pregnancy testing in women of childbearing potential must be negative (see 
Section 6.3.2.1 ).

16Jul 2019 ConfidentialrAllsubjects undergo a 250 µg ACTH stimulation test as part of eligibility assessments.  This evaluation will be completed during the Screening period .  This must be performed 
before entry into the 4 -week (28 day) single -blind run -in/Baseline Symptom Assessment.  Apositive ACT H stimulation test (serum cortisol level < 16µg/dL (440 nmol /L) at 
60minutes after treatment with 250 µg cosyntropin administered intramuscularly ) will be exclusio nary (see Exclusion Criterion #24: in Section 4.2.2 ).  
s A250 µg ACTH simulation test will be performed (at an unscheduled visit) to assess for HPA axis suppression of potential clinical concern as follows:
1) Any time a subject has a morning s erum cortisol level ≤5 µg/dL (138 nmol/L) (confirmed by 2 blood draws )
2) Any time a subject reports symptoms of hypercor ticism (Appendix 6 )
tSubjects who discontinue from the study due to evidence of HPA axis suppression will undergo a 250 µg ACTH stimulation test at the Early Termination Visit.
uFor the Early Termination Visit, the Investigator should record any occurrence of AEs (14 ± 5 days after discontinuation).  Subjects discontinued for HPA issu es should be 
followed until resolution .

The Screening Period is 4 weeks (28 day s).  Along with the reports confirming the subject’s 
primary  diagnosis of EoE, the Invest igator will assess eligibilit y criteria (see Section 4.2.1
and Sect ion 4.2.2 ) of the subject based on Screening results.  The Gl obal EoE score must be 
>3 for the subject to continue in the study .
The EGD procedures to determine eligibilit y (see Inclusi on Cri terion #7 : have evidence of 
EoE, as defined by  ≥15 PEAK eosinophils/HPF . In order to ensure that a diagnosis can be 
made, at least 5 -6 biop sies shoul d be taken including both proximal and distal specimens
[~3each] )will be co mpleted during the Screening Period and the biopsies must be received 
by the central patho logist by  the times noted in this inclusio n criterion.  EGD m ust be 
perform ed prior to Vi sit 2 (4 -week Baseline Symptom Assessment).
ACTH st imulat ion test must also be performed prior to Visit 2 (4 -week Baseline Symptom 
Assessment).
With Medical Monitor approval, a subject may be rescreened once if the previous reason for 
screen failure is no l onger present or the subject withdrew due to personal or family  reasons 
that ha vesince resolved.  If asubject is rescreened, a new informed consent form ( ICF)will 
be signed and a ssigned a new number .  All tests and assessments must be repeated. However, 
if the subject is being rescreened for reasons other than the esophagogastroduodenoscopy  
(EGD), then the EGD does not have to be repeated at rescreening, if the screening EGD 
occurred within the previous 6 weeks. Each subject will be reviewed and discussed on a

Assessment to complete procedures and assessments noted in Table 4-1.  
During the 4-week Baseline Symptom  Assessment, baseline symptom severit y will be 
determined and the abilit y of the subject to be compliant with diary  entri es will be assessed.   
Pathol ogy for EGD bi opsies may  also be assessed (or earlier if possible).
4.1.5 Randomization 
4.1.5.1 Confirmation of Eligibilit y
To be eligible for rando mizat ion, subjects must satisfy allinclusio n/excl usion criteria, 
including the following inclusio n criteria that are expected to be confirmed during the 
4-week Baseline Symptom Assessment :  Inclusio n Cri terion #7: evidence of EoE as defined 
by ≥15 PEAK eosinophils/HPF; Inclusio n Cri terion #8: in the daily  diary, report epi sodes of 
dysphagia ≥3 days per 7 days during the l ast 14 days of the 4 -week Baseline Symptom 
Assessment ; Inclusio n Cri terion #9: com pletion of  the daily  diary on at l east 5 out of each 
7days during the last 14 day s of the Baseline Symptom  Assessment and Exclusi on Cri teria 
#24: a serum cortiso l level<16 µg/dL (440nmol/L) at 60 minutes with adrenocorticotropic 
hormone (ACTH) stimulat iontest using 250 µg cosyn tropin administered intramuscularly
(i.e., an abnormal result on the ACTH stimulat ion test ).  The ACTH st imulation test should 
have been co mpleted before entry  into the 4 -week Baseline Symptom Assessment, however 
the resul ts of the test may be pending.
If the Investi gator confirms eligibilit y criteria are met, he or she will randomize the subject 
using the Interactive Web Response System ( IWRS).  The I WRS will confirm the eligibilit y 
of the subject pertaining to histology  (i.e.,confirm histological evidence o f the EoE diagnosis 
as per Inclusio n Cri terion #7 : evidence of EoE as defi ned by ≥15 PEAK eosinophils/HPF), 
and provide the rando mizat ion numb er to the Investigator and the S ponsor.

A total o f 100adult subjects will be rando mized to 1of 4doses of APT -1011 (1.5 mg HS, 
1.5mg BID, 3 mg HS, and 3 mg BID) orplacebo .  Subjects in the HS treatment groups will 
receive placebo 30 minutes after breakfast in order to maintain the blind.
Randomization will occur in a double -blind manner using an integrated I WRS, and will be 
stratified by the presence or absence of a history  of or current esophageal stricture at 
Screening and history  of a pri or posi tive steroi d response to any corticosteroid treatment 
previously re ceived to treat the subject’s EoE captured with demography .  Randomizat ion for 
subjects in Part 1 will be stratified by use, such that a comparable percentage of subjects 
during the study  will be allo cated to each of the 5dosing groups .

Timing of and instructions for dosing are discussed in Sect ion 5.6.
5.2 Identity of Investigational Product and Placebo
APT -1011 includes FP as its act ive ingredient .  Dosage strengths to be administered in FLUTE 
are discussed in Sect ion 5.1.  It is manufactured and packaged by Patheon Pharmaceut icals.   The 
Sponsor will be responsible for ensuring that study drug is manufactured in accordance with

5.4 Method of Assigning Subjects to Dosing Group
Randomization will be managed by theIWRS.  To randomize a subject, the site staff will access 
theIWRS via the web to enroll and obtain rando mization informat ion.  Site staff will then 
dispense the rando mized treatment allocat ion of study  drug, whi ch corresponds to the allocat ion 
number as assigned by the IWRS .  The I WRS will provi de the Subject Medicat ion Kitof the 
blinded study  drug to be dispensed .  
The rando mizat ion code will be held by the clinical  supplies vendor .
The rando mizat ion scheme is discussed in Sect ion 4.1.5.2 .
5.5 Selection of Doses i n the Study
A formal dose -ranging study  for FP in EoE has not been performed previously.  Select ion of the 
dose in FLUTE is based on safet y, PK (as a major determinant of safet y), and efficacy 
considerations.  
Since the safet y of APT -1011 depends in part on systemic exposure, the bioavailabilit y of oral 
FP is an important factor in determining the dose range to be studied.  Orally  administered and 
inhaled FP each have low bioavailabilit y compared with intravenous (IV) administration (<1% 
and approximately 26%, respectively).  This means the relat ive bioavailabilit y of orally  
administered FP compared with an equivalent dose of inhaled FP is <3%.  
The PK of FP may also be impacted by potential drug interactions.  Specifically , a study  in 
healt hy subjects has shown that ritonavir (a highly  potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) can significantly 
increase systemic FP exposure (area under the curve [AUC]), result ing in significant ly reduced 
serum  cortisol  concentrati ons.  As such, the current study  excl udes subjects on potent CYP3A4 
inhibitors such as ritonavir and ketoconazole.  The consumption of grapefruit is also prohibited 
since this contains a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor.

up), APT -1011 w as generally well -tolerated wi th relatively few and largely mild TEAEs 
reported.  Adrenal and cortiso l-related AEs were rare.
In published results, 1.7 mg of FPadministered orally  (typically 2 sprays of 880 mcg each) by 
metered dose inhaler demonstrates c linical efficacy.21,22  The pl anned 1.5 mg HS dosing group 
closely  approximates this 1.7 mg dose.  
The doses of APT -1011 to be evaluated i n FLUTE range from the expected minimally 
efficacious dose to the highest dose studied in Study PR -023 that is expected to avoid HPA axis 
suppressio n.20  The m aximum  total  daily  dose of 6 mg administered as 3 mg BID was chosen as 
it allows f or assessment of safet y and efficacy over a 4 -fold dose range while maintaining 
anticipated m ean serum corti sol suppressio n below 20%.
5.6 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
The dose to be administered for each subject for Part 1 will be as per rando mizat ion (see 
Secti on5.4).  For Part2, the dose to be administered for each subject depends on their histol ogic 
responder status (see Section 4.1.6 ).

5.7 Blinding
This study  is rando mized, double -blind, and placebo -controlled wit h limited access to the 
rando mizat ion code .  The invest igational product and placebo tablets will be ident ical in physical 
appearance .  The treatment each subject will receive will not be disclosed to the Invest igator , site 
staff, subject , Sponsor, or any  Sponsor desi gnees .  The treatment codes will be held by the 
clinical supplies vendor and rando mizat ion will be completed by the IWRS.  
Several areas of study  operati onalizati on are of parti cular concern:
As di scussed in Sect ion 4.1.6 , subjects may  be assigned to single -blind treatm ent at various 
time points in the study  (Week14 and potenti ally following rel apse depending upon the 
clinical circumstances at any  time after Week 14 ).  This includes subjects who are 
determined to be histol ogic non-responders or who relapse.  For subjects who are assigned to 
single -blind treatm ent wi th 3 mg BID APT 1011 (regardless of reason), the previous 
rando mized dosing group assignment will continue to remain blinded.
oAs di scussed in Sect ion 4.1.6 , subjects who exhibit  a sustained response to study  drug 
(when assessed at Week 12 and Week 26) will continue to be t reated according to the 
dosing group to which they  were randomized for Part 1.  
The central patho logist will co mmunicate histol ogy responder status from  a histol ogical 
perspective to the IWRS vendor.  The corresponding overall responder status (i.e., also
accounting for worsening of symptoms [i.e., dysphagia] and food impact ion) will be 
communicated in a blinded fashion to the sites by the IWRS vendor.  
Subjects in the 1.5 mg HS , 3 m g HS APT -1011 and placebo dosing groups will undergo PK 
sampling to avoid breaking the blind.
Corti sol suppressio n was reported in 1 subject taking placebo and 1 subject taking APT -1011 
1.5mg BID in Study PR -021 (see Section 2.4.1.1 ).  As such, the occurrence of such an event 
Adare Pharmaceuticals 67

APT-1011
16Jul 2019 Confidentialdoes not necessarily  indicate that a subject is being treated with APT -1011 .  However, i t is 
possible that cortiso l laboratory  values could unblind site staff.  As such, these values will be 
blinded at all t imepoints afterrandomization.  Programmed alerts wi ll pro mpt the site should 
a low-level corti sol laboratory  value necessi tate an ACTH stimulat ion test.  
A blinded pharmacist at each site will manage distribution and accountabilit y of study  drug .  
To m aintain the blind, the bottle containing the study  drug will  be labeled for “after breakfast” 
or “at bedtime” administration.  See Table 5-1for a descri ption of the study  drug to be 
contained in “after breakfast” and “at bedt ime” bottle for each dosing group.  
5.7.1 Breaking the Blind
At the site, the blind may be broken only in emerge ncy cases in which knowledge of treatment 
woul d impact the medical care of the subject.  The Investigator and/or site staff should discuss 
possible unblinding with the Medical Monitor before unblinding ,if at all possible.   Adverse 
event(s) associated with HPA axis suppression are not expected to require subject unblinding.  
The Investigator and/or site staff must inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of any unblinding that 
occurs.  The pharmacovigilance group may also break the blind for subjects who experien ce a 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reacti on.
The process for breaking the blind will be handled through the I WRS.  Invest igator s are strongly 
discouraged from  request ing the blind be broken for an individual subject , unless there is a 
subject safety issue that requires unblinding and would change subject management .  Any site 
that breaks the blind under inappropriate circumstances may be asked to discont inue its 
participat ion in FLUTE .  If the blind is broken, it may be broken for only the subject in quest ion.
The Sponsor and contract research organizat ion (CRO )must be notified immediately  if a subject
and/or Invest igator is unblinded during the course of the study .  Pertinent informat ion regarding 
the circumstances of unblinding of a subject ’s treat ment code , including the date, time and 
reason for unblinding must be documented in the subject ’s source documents .  
5.8 Prior and Concomitant Treatments
The brand name (or, if unknown, the generic name), dose, dose unit (or dosage form if 
compound), frequenc y, route of administration, duration of use (start date and, if applicable, stop
date), and indicat ion for all medications taken within 30 days prior to signing the ICF, all 
concomitant medicat ions that are ongoing at the time of the ICF signature, and all conco mitant

6.3.1 Adverse Events
Definition of AE  
An AE is any  untoward m edical occurrence in a subject or clinical invest igation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and thatdoes not necessarily have a causal relat ionship 
with this treatm ent.
All AEs will be coded using the current version o f the Medi cal Dict ionary for Regulatory  
Activities.  A T EAE will be an AE that occurs after the first dose of study  drug i s administered.
Figure 6-1illustrates the decisio n-making process the I nvest igator should fo llow in determining 
how to document an AE for the purposes of FLUTE .

Definition of SAE
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to study  drug or 
not) that at any  dose:
Results in death ;
Is life -threatening ;
oThe subject is at a risk o f death at the time of the ev ent; i t does not refer to an event that
hypotheti cally  might have caused death if it were more severe .
Requires in patienthospi talizat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talizati on;
oHospitalization or prolongat ion of hospitalizat ion not associated with an AE are not 
considered SAEs, including admissio n due to pre -exist ing condit ion that di d not worsen

Results in persistent or si gnificant disabili ty/incapaci ty;
Is a congenital abnormalit y/birth defect ;
Other:  
oMedically  significant events, which do not meet any o f the criteria above, but may 
jeopardi ze the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1or 
more of theother serious outcome slisted in the definit ion above .  Examples of such 
events are blood dyscrasias ( e.g., neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusio n, etc.) 
or convulsio ns that do not result in hospitalizat ion.
oFor the purposes of th estudy , the s uspected transmissio n of infect ious agents will be 
considered an SAE as a medically  significant event.  
Death and surgery  shoul d not be reported as an event; these are viewed as an outcome of an 
event, rather than the event itself .  In cases where the cause of death is unknown, death may  be 
initially reported as an event .  Every  attem pt should be made to submit a fo llow-up report 
ident ifying the cause o f death.
Definition of Adverse Event of Special Interest 
For the purposes of th estudy , the primary  AESIs will  be those rel ated HPA axis suppressio n.  
Subjects will be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects such as 
hypercorti cism and adrenal suppressio n.  Serum cortiso l levels will be measured and will be the 
primary  evaluator of any  potenti al HPA axis suppressio n(see Section 6.3.4 ).  Oral and 
esophageal candidiasis will however be considered AEs of special interest.  Subjects may remain 
in the study  during the treatm ent for these AEs.  The Invest igator may allo w swish and spit 
30minutes after dosing for these subjects.  Su bjects must be instructed not to swallow the rinsing 
water .  Adverse events related to such effects will be considered AESI sfor the purposes of the
study .
6.3.1.1 Severity and Relationship of Adverse Events
Severity
The severit y of the all AEswill be characteri zed as “mild, moderate ,or severe” according to the

An AEmust be promptly documented and recorded on the Adverse Events eCRF .  The 
Invest igator is responsible for recording all AEs observed or reported during the study, 
regardl ess of causalit y and/or clinical significance.  
At each study  visit, after the subject has had an opportunit y to spontaneously ment ion any 
probl ems, the In vestigator or designee should inquire about AEs by asking the appropriate open 
questions .  In addition to straight forward subject observat ion (e.g., headache, nausea, etc.), AEs 
will also be documented fro m any data collected in the eCRF (e.g., laboratory  values, physical 
examinat ion findings, etc.) or other documents (e.g., subject diaries) that are relevant to subject

oOnly 1AE term  shoul d be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event eCRF. If 
several condi tions meet the cri teria for AE reporti ng, each condit ion should be reported in 
the separate eCRF.
oIf known, a diagnosis shoul d be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than 
individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only hepatic injury  or hepati tis rather than 
jaundice and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellat ion of signs and/or 
symptoms cannot be medically  characteri zed as a single diagnosis or syndro me at the 
time of reporting, each individual event should be separately recorded on the Adverse 
Event eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequent ly establish ed, all  previ ously reported AEs 
based on signs and symptoms should be replaced by a single AE report based on the 
single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first 
symptom  of the eventual  diagnosis. Signs/symptoms o f the reported AE should be 
described in the eCRF description field .
Date of onset of the AE;
Intensit y (mild, m oderate, or severe);
Date of resolut ion (or statement that the event is ongo ing);
Action taken;
oConcomitant medicat ion or adj unctive therapy /procedure given will be recorded on the

Drug abuse, misuse ,and overdose with or wi thout AEs (an overdose is a dose higher than 
that prescribed by a health care professio nal for clinical reasons );
oThe Investigator will use their clinical judgement to decide whether a dose was an 
overdose.
Inadvertent or accidental exposure to the study drug with or without an AE;
Any other m edicat ion errors (including dispensing errors such as inadvertent use of expired

6.3.1.5 Follow -Up of Adverse Events
Any AEs observed from Screening up to the end of the study  will be fo llowed up to resol ution.  
Reso lution means that the subject has returned to a baseline state of healt h or the Investigator 
does not e xpect any further improvement or worsening of the AE .  All AEs that occur after the

APT -1011 (flut icasone proprionate ODT) a minimally absorbed corticosteroid is expected to act 
topically  in the esophagus.  Because of this, there is potential for decreased efficacy  if thesubject 
swallows water soon after dosing.  Since the use of flut icasone has only been rarely associated 
with oral candidiasis34,35,36,37there will be no need to do swish and spit since this could 
inadvertent ly be associ ated wi th swall owed water.
Oral and esophageal candidiasis will however be consi dered AESIs.  Subj ects m ay remain in the

At all visits (scheduled or unscheduled), specific attention will be given to potential changes 
related to corti costeroi ds, as well as symptoms of hypercorti cism (Appendix 6 ).  Should a subject 
undergo surgery  or tra uma during the study , parti cular care shoul d be taken in observing subjects 
for evidence o f inadequate adrenal response.   These assessments must be documented in the

If hypercorticism or adrenal  suppressi on are suspected, an a dequate work -up should b e 
perform ed to confirm or rul e out these findings .  Specifically , to monitor for HPA axis 
suppressio n of potenti al clinical concern, a 250 µg ACTH s timulat ion test will be performed 
after Screening if any of the f ollowing occur:
During routine laboratory  testing co mpleted for the study , the subject has a morning serum 
cortisol level ≤5 µg/dL ( ≤138 nmo l/L) (confirmed by 2 blood draws ), including at the last on -
treatm ent visi t for a subject (ACTH stimulat ion test to be completed at an unscheduled visit) ;
oSee Secti on 6.3.4.1 for a di scussio n of the expected management/treatment of abnormal 
serum  cortisol  levels for the purposes of t hestudy .
The s ubject reports symptoms of hypercorticism (Appendix 6 )(ACTH stimulat ion test to be 
completed at an unscheduled visit if needed) . 
The subject discont inues due to HPA axis suppressio n (ACTH st imulat ion test to be 
completed at the Early Terminat ion Visit).
Anabnorm alresul t for th e ACTH st imulation test is defined as serum cortiso l level < 16µg/dL 
(440nmol/L) at 60 minutes after treatment with 250 µg cosyntropin administered 
intramuscularly .  This resul t is exclusio nary (see Secti on 4.2.2 ) if it occurs at Screening /4-week 
Baseline Symptom Assessment and requires fo llow-up through recovery  of adrenal  function if it 
occurs thereafter . The Sponsor will provide guidelines for safet y follow-up (see Secti on6.3.4.1 ) 
and docum ent of restoration of adrenal funct ion in all subjects demo nstrating evidence of

test suggests adrenal insufficiency (i.e., minimum cortiso l value < 16µg/dL [ 440nmol/L] 
before or 30 minutes after ACTH inject ion), the subject will be prescribed CORTEF® 
(hydrocortisone oral) 10 mg/day in the morning and be referred to an endocrino logist for 
further monitoring and management.  The Invest igator will maint ain contact with the subject

Pharmacokinet ic samples will be co llected from subjects in all 5dosing groups to maintain the 
blind (see Section 5.7).  Sam ples collected from subjects in the placebo dosing group will not be 
analyzed.  Samples collected from subjects in the 1.5 and 3 mg HS, 1.5 and 3 mg BID dosing 
group swill be analyzed f or PopPK resul ts.  As part of the PopPK modeling, renal and hepatic 
funct ion as well as conco mitant medicat ions will be considered.
6.4.1 Sparse Pharmacokinetic Sampling
Sparse PK samples (all subjects) will be perform ed in all subjects enrolled in FLUTE .  The main 
study  ICF will  include consent for sparse PK sampling.
The fo llowing PK samples will be collected for all subjects for sparse PK sampling :
Day 1:  pre -dose;
Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12 :  Subjects will take their “after breakfast” dose as scheduled 
on the day  of the visi t at the si teand 2 samples will  be taken during their scheduled visit:
1.Subjects m ust fast approximately 8 hours before the scheduled visit s.
2.Upon arrival to the site :  After arrival at the site and once samples for serum 
cortisol and spa rse PK are drawn, the subject will eat breakfast and take their 
“after breakfast” dose approximately 30 minutes after breakfast .There are no 
requi rements for the time duration between when the “after breakfast” dose is 
administered and this first sample to be collected on -site.  The “at bedt ime” must 
not have been taken at the time of sampling.  
3.Approximately  1 to 1.5 hours after fi rst sam ple (immediately prior to leaving the 
site).  This sam ple must be collected ≥1hour after the first sample at a given site; 
there is no maximum t ime duration between the first and second sample to be 
collected.
Site staff shoul d document the tim e ofthe morning dose.  Due to this variabilit y, the sparse PK 
samples are expected to represent a large portion of the 12 -hour post -dosing interval .

Time and date of administration o f the “after breakfast” dose (day  of the pl anned visit) ;
Time and date of administrati on of  the immediately preceding “at bedt ime” dose (evening 
prior to the planned visit).  
If a subject refuses blood collect ion for PK analysis, this will not be considered a protocol 
violation as the PK analysis is a secondary object ive.
6.4.3 Pharma cokinetic Variables
The fo llowing PopPK parameters will be estimated using sparse sampling , as data permit:
Oral clearance (CL/F);
Volume of distribut ion (V/F).

considered as source documents.
All individual entries in the source documents requi re signatures and dates by  the Investi gators .  
All typed or dictated documents and co mputer printouts must be signed and dated by the 
Invest igator to confirm review .  If the si te uses electronic (paperless) hospital reporting systems, 
the CRA must be provi ded access to verify the source data.  In the case that access cannot be 
provi ded, the Investigator must sign and date a hard copy  of this data for this to be considered a

7.1.1.2 Protocol Deviation Definition and Process
A protocol  deviat ion is an excursio n (generally unplanned )from the expected conduct of the 
study  that is inconsistent wi th the protocol , ICF, or study  agenda .  
At each visit, subjects who fail to adhere to treatment will be assessed on whether or not the lack 
of adherence to dosing regimen was due to AEs .  The Invest igator should make every effort to 
ensure that visits occur at the appropriate intervals.
The Investigator must notify  the Medical  Monitor and/or clinical study  manager of any  protocol  
deviat ion.  Protocol deviations will be documented in the Clinical Trial Management System and 
evaluated and categorized by  the Medical  Monitor. Protocol deviat ions including the reason for 
any out of window study  visits, will  be docum ented in the subject source records .
Protocol  deviat ions must be reported to the IRB/IEC per local requirements.
7.1.2 Data Management and Coding

the eCRFs are accurate and correct .  If some assessments are not done, or if certain informat ion 
is not available or not applicable or unknown, the Investigator should indicate this in the eCRF .  
The Investi gatorwill be required to electronically sign off on the clinical data .  
The CRA will review the eCRFs and evaluate them for completeness and consistency .  The 
eCRF will be compared wit h the source documents to ensure that there are no discrepancies 
between critical data .  All entries, correcti ons,and alterations are to be made by the responsible 
Invest igator or his/her designee .  The CRA cannot enter data in the eCRFs .  Once clinical data of 
the eCRF have been submitted to the central server, corrections to the data fields will be audit 
trailed, m eaning that the reason for change, the name of the person who performed the change, 
together with time and date will be logged .  Roles and rights of the site staff responsible for 
entering the clinical data into the eCRF will be determined in advance .  If addit ional corrections 
are needed, the CRA or data manager will raise a query  in the EDC applicat ion.  The appropriate 
sitestaff will answer queries sent to the Invest igator .  This will be audit trailed by the EDC 
applicat ion meaning that the name of sitestaff, t ime,and date stamp are captured.
The eCRF is essentially considered a data entry  form and shoul d not const itute the original (or

Part 1 i ncludes asample size wit h 100subjects , in which 20 pati ents are randomized each to 
1.5mg HS, 1.5 mg BID, 3 mg HS, 3 mg BID ,and placebo in the ratio 1:1:1:1:1 .  See also the 
discussio n of rando mizat ion in Sect ion 4.1.5.2 .  
8.1.1 Expected Number of Subjects by Part
The following assumpt ionswere used :
The 1:1:1:1:1 (1.5mgHS:1.5mg BID: 3 mg HS, 3mg BID: placebo) randomizat ion rati os 
will remain constant throughout the study .
Based on these rando mizat ion rati os, approximately  80% of  all subjects in Part 1 will be 
treated with an APT -1011 dosing regimen and approximately 20% of  all subjects in Part 1 
will b e treated wi th placebo.
Based upon the PR -021 study , which had slight ly different histologic response criteria, it is 
expected thatapproximately 60% of patients on active treatm ent are expected to be a 
histol ogic responder compared to 10% on placebo.  The lowest dose may be less effect ive. 
oAssuming a 60% histologic response rate for the 3 highest active doses of 1.5 mgBID, 
3mg HS, 3 mg BID, a 20% response rate for 1.5 mg HS, and a 10% response rate for 
placebo, it is expected that overall approximately 50% of active treatm ent will be 
responders at Week 12 (40 out of 80).
oIt is expected that at Week 26 an addit ional 20% will drop out who were previously 
responders and of the PART 1 non -responders that 40% will st ill be non -responders.
oAfter Week 26, of th e remaining subjects, it is expected that approximately 20% will 
dropout before Week 52.
Given these assumpt ions, it is expected that approximately  42 pati ents will  be responders and 
complete Week 26, and about 34 of those responders will co mplete Week 52.
The power for testing each active dose versus placebo given a histologic response rate of 
60% active treatment and 10% placebo for the primary  endpoint (Part 1) is equal to 97.5% 
(one-sided Ty pe Ierror = 0.05).  Addit ionally , the power for achieving sta tistical significance 
for all 3 of the highest active doses of 1.5 mg BID, 3 mg HS, 3 mg BID via the gatekeeping 
hypothesis testing approach assuming independence is approximately 0.93.

16Jul 2019 ConfidentialDue to l ack of  previ ous data, estim ating power for the secondary endpo int of reduction in 
number of dysphagia episodes is difficult.  We expect that majorit y of control  group will 
range between 25 -35 dy sphagia episodes per week at baseline.  We expect a placebo effect 
corresponding to a 20 -30% reduction, implying a reduction of 5-10 epi sodes. If we assume 
that the range of reduction for patients in control group is 0 to 15 episodes (and a normal 
distribut ion), this would correspond to a standard deviat ion of approximately 
15/6=2.5 episodes.  We also expect treatment group to also have 25 -35 dy sphagia episodes 
per week at baseline, and a reduction of 30 -60% wit h treatment, implying a reduction of 7 to 
21 epi sodes.  If we assume that the range of reductio n for pati ents in treatm ent group i s 0 to 
30 epi sodes (and a normal distri bution), this would correspond to a standard deviat ion of 
approximately  30/6=5 episodes.  Given the uncertaint y of these est imates, our conservat ive 
approach assumes standard deviat ions of 4.5 and 7.5 for control and treatment group 
(respectively) for the reducti on in number of dysphagia episodes.  Given these assumpt ions, 
we have 80% power for 20 active dose patients vs. 20 control patients to detect a mean 
difference in reduction between groups of 5.0 episodes.  This calculat ion is for a single act ive 
armvs. control and does not factor in the mult iplicit y of having 4 potential doses to test.  
Assuming independence, a conservat ive Bonferonni approach would provide 80% power for 
a mean difference in reduct ion between groups of 6.3 episodes per arm, indicat ing the study  
is powered for an effect size of 5.0 to 6.3 episodes in reduct ion of dysphagia episodes for 
each of the doses.
Thestudy  has other important objectives which requi re sufficient sample size .  The sample 
size of a total of 100 subjects as specif ied for the primary  endpoint is considered sufficient to 
adequately  evaluate the measurement properties of the new PRO instrument, and assess the 
amount of change that is clinically  meaningful and to establish cut offs for Response and

inferential testing is equal to the number of doses that meet stat istical significance for the 
primary  efficacy  analysis. 
Statistical tests to compare each APT -1011 dosing group with placebo will be performed for 
other secondary  efficacy endpo ints, but the corresponding p -values will be considered as 
descript ive rather than inferent ial.  The secondary  endpoints will  be analyzed via a stratified 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenzel test for categorical endpoints and analysis of covari ance or Wilcoxon 
Rank -Sum tests for change from baseline endpoints, except for the endpo int of time to relapse 
after ini tiation of double -blind treatment in Part 2, which will be analyzed using Kaplan -Meier 
methods.
As a secondary  efficacy  analysis, all 4 doses of active treatment will be pooled and compared to 
placebo wi th a stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenzel test. Addit ionally , Bayesian hierarchical 
modeling will be used for both the primary  efficacy  endpoint and reducti on in number of 
dysphagia episodes, in which dose -response modeling is used to estimate the difference between 
each active dose and p lacebo.  Additionally, a logistic regression model using both dose and 
frequency  and dose -frequency interaction will be used to analyze the primary endpo int.  
Subgroup analyses and regressio n models will also be conducted on primary  and key  secondary  
endpo ints to assess regio nal effects and relationships with demographics (age, gender, race, 
ethnicit y, PPI status, and strata variables).
8.9 Safety Analyses
The incidence of TEAEs will be summarized by system organ class and preferred term using the 
current versi on of  the Medical Dict ionary of Regulatory  Activit ies.  Separate summaries by 
maximum severit y (for all AEs) and relationship (for SAEs only) to study  drug will  be provi ded.

the actual dose at the time of the event .
Clinically significant changes of potential clinical interest in clinical tests will be summarized 
inclu ding hematol ogy, chemistry , urinalysis, ECG, cortisol, vital signs, and bone mineral densit y.  
No stati stical testing of safet y endpo ints will be performed .  Shift tables may be produced, if 
needed.   The number of subjects discontinuing due to HPA axis suppressi on or posi tive ACTH 
stimulat ion tests will be summarized.  
8.10 Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analyses
Sparse PK sampling (all subjects) will be performed to characterize FP exposure in the study 
popul ation.  
8.10.1 Population Pharmacokinetics
A PopPK an alysis will be performed based on sparse plasma concentration data and will be 
described in a separate report .  It will be performed using the nonlinear mixed -effects software, 
NONMEM, Version 7.2.0 or later ( Pharmaceut ical Product Development LLC, Wilming ton, 
North Carolina ) or other appropriate nonlinear mixed -effects modeling so ftware .  The structural 
PK m odel will include CL/F and V/F as fixed -effect parameters .  Addit ionally, the intersubject 
variabilit y in the parameter estimates and the random residu al error in the data will be est imated 
with appropri ate error m odels .  The optimal base model will be selected according to the 
standard cri teria such as minimum object ive function value and diagnostic plots .  The rel evant 
inform ation from bioanalyt ical an d clinical  databases (e.g., dosing t imes and sampling times) 
will be extracted and integrated for generation o f the PopPK input files .  All possible attempts 
will be made to capture missing informat ion.  Any additional information obtained regarding 
missin g data and the procedures followed to handle any  missing data will be documented and 
discussed in the CSR .  After the final model is constructed, secondary parameters such as AUC 
and C maxwill be calculated to characterize the extent of FP systemic exposure for the range of 
dosing regimens .  Addit ional simulat ions may be perform ed, as necessary , to inform  decisi on 
making for future studies .  The output from the final population models incl uding appropri ate 
diagnosti c plots, list ings, and summaries of PK parameters will be generated .  Eval uation of 
renal and hepat ic funct ions and concomitant medications will be included in the PopPK model .  
In addit ion, graphical and tabular presentations of any PK simulat ions will be produced .  A 
separate PopPK report will be generated as an appendix to the CSR .  
Previous serial PK data for APT -1011 (Study  PR-023) m ay be included in this analysis to 
facilitate development of a base PK model.  
Popul ation PK parameters to be estimated are detailed in Sect ion 6.4.3 .

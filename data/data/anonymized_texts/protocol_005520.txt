 2 SUMMARY  
 
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is expressed on pancreatic cancer  (PC). Our recent phase I 
study on patients with colorectal cancer and advanced pancreatic showed encouraging results. This 
protocol will confirm toxicities and estimate the clinical efficacy of combining anti -CD3 x anti -EGFR 
bispecific antibody (EGFRBi) armed ac tivated T cells ( EGFR BATs) given to patients  (pt) with locally 
advanced or metastatic PC who have received at least first line chemotherapy  and may have 
responding, stable or progressive disease.   In the phase I study, 5 patients received  3-4 infusions of 2 x 
1010 BATs per infusion with total 8 x 1010 per course of treatment without dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)  
with a median overall survival  (OS) of 14.5 mo s.   
 
One treatment of chemotherapy  will be given 1- 2 week s before immunotherapy to create immunologic 
space before the infusions of EGFR BATs.  In th e sin gle dose phase I portion of this  study  involving 3- 6 
pt, we will confirm the safety of twice weekly infusions of up to 1010 EGFR BATs infusions in combination 
with 300,000 IU of interleukin 2 (IL- 2)/m2/day and 250 µg granulocyte- macrophage colony stimulating 
factor (GM -CSF)/m2/twice weekly beginning 3 days before the 1st infusion and ending on the day of the 
last infusion.   If there is toxicity in 1 of 3 pt, 3 additional pt will be added to the dose level of 1010.  If 2 of 6 
patient s experience DLTs, then the dose will be reduced to 7.5 x 109 per infusion.  If only 1 pt has toxicity 
in the first 6, then the study will proceed to enroll the remaining cohort of pt in the phase II.  In the phase II 
portion of this study, we will estimate the clinical ef ficacy of 8 infusions of 1010 EGFR BATs in 
combination with IL- 2 and GM -CSF in 39 evaluable pt (including the 3- 6 pt in the above mentioned single 
dose phase I). The primary endpoint is an improvement in median OS from historical data of 7 mos to 
10.5 mos.  
 
Immune evaluations will be performed to determine if: a) infusions of EGFR BATs significantly increase 
cellular or humoral anti -PC responses and if those responses persist and b) immune responses correlate 
with clinical responses.  The original tumor par affin blocks prior to treatment will be evaluated for the 
presence of CD3, CD4, CD8, PD1/PDL1, monocytes subpopulations, MDSC, and cytoplasmic IFN -γ and 
IL-10 by Immunohistochemical staining. The type and number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in 
the tumor microenvironment will be correlated with clinical responses  (secondary objective) . 
 
If the pt does not have rapidly progressive disease 2 months after the last infusion, the treatment may be 
repeated. If the pt has significant progression of disease, the pt will receive oncologist ’s choice of 
chemotherapy . Such  chemotherapy may be given starting 30 days after the last BAT s infusion. The pts 
will receive 3 months of chemotherapy  and continue to be evaluated on protocol .  
 In summary, t he primary objective of the study is to evaluate clinical efficacy after confirm ing the safety at 
a dose up to 10
10 EGFR BATs per infusions for 8 infusions  in combination with IL- 2 and GM -CSF. The 
primary endpoint is OS  with the design to determine whether infusions of BATs in PC pts  could improve 
the median OS from 7  months to 10.5  mos. Given the poor prognosis for pt with metastatic or locally 
advanced PC, we will also follow the pt to determine if immunotherapy followed by chemotherapy 
improve clinical responses over historical responses and improves time to progression free survival 
(PFS) . Patients who are stable, partial responders, or complet e responders by Wolchok criteria are 
eligible for re- treatment with BAT s. The secondary objectives are: 1) immune evaluation studies to 
determine if infusions of  BATs significantly  increases cellular or humoral anti -PC responses and if those 
responses persist and correlate with clinical responses and 2) determine whether the ty pe and number of 
T cells, Th 1/Th 2 secreting T cells, activation markers in the original biopsy paraffin block correlates with 
clinical outcomes.

 4 1.0  OBJECTIVES 
 
1.1   Primary Objectives : 
 In patients who have received at least first line chemotherapy:  
 a)  Confirm in a single dose phase I (3 to 6 pts) that 8 infusions of  up to  1010 EGFR BATs given 
twice per week in combination with IL- 2 (300,000 IU /m2/day) and granulocyte- macrophage colony 
stimulating factor (GM -CSF) (250 µg/m2/twice weekly) beginning 3 days before the 1st infusion and 
ending on the day of the last infusion is safe.  
 
 b) Perform a phase II clinical trial to estimate the clinical efficacy of 8 infusions of 1010 EGFR BATs in 
combination with IL- 2 and GM -CSF in 39 evaluable pts (including the 3- 6 pts in the single dose 
phase I). The primary endpoint is an improvement in median overall survival (OS) from historical 
data of 7 mos to 10.5 mo. The trial will accrue 39 evaluable pts (including those in the single dose 
phase I.   
 
1.2  Secondary Objectives:  
 1.2.1. Determine if infusions of EGFR BATs significantly  increase cellular or humoral anti -PC 
responses by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at different time points after last EGFR BATs infusion and if those responses persist beyond 2 mos   
 
1.2.2 Obtain original tumor paraffin blocks prior to treatment  and evaluate blocks for CD3, CD4, 
CD8, PD1/PDL1, monocytes subpopulations, MDSC, and cytoplasmic IFN -γ and IL- 10 by 
Immunohistochemical staining  to quantitate type and number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the tumor microenvironment to estim ate whether the type and number correlate with clinical 
responses.  
  
 1.2.3 To determine progression free survival  (PFS).  
 2.0  BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 2.1 Metastatic and Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer:  
PC is the fourth most common cause of cancer -related death in the United States with over 48,960 newly 
diagnosed cases expected in 2015 and an expected mortality rate of approximately 40,560
1. Most pt  
diagnosed with PCs have unresectable disease and usually die of metastatic disease even after 
treatment with chemo and radiation therapy. Despite the recent remarkable advancements in many 
malignancies, little success has been reflected i n the outcome of PC. This malignancy is still considered 
among the most aggressive and the least curable of all human malignancies. Unfortunately, late 
diagnosis of PC in most pts with LAPC or MPC is associated with poor prognosis. Without effective 
treatment, the median s urvival of less than one year  is expected for those with MPC.  
2.2 Chemo therapy  for the treatment of PC.  
Single -agent gem became the first -line treatment of MPC after the pivotal 1997 report, where Burris et al2 
comp ared gem with 5- FU. The response rate was 5.4% in pt treated with gem alone whereas none of the 
5-FU treated pts responded (p = NS). Gem was associated with a statistically significant improvement in 
pain control, weight loss and functional impairment leading to FDA approval based on improvements in pt 
performance status. Many other combinations with gem failed to provide any further benefit and .3 and clinical 
outcomes remained alarmingly low2,4-18. More recently, the combination of nab- paclitaxel  plus gem  improved OS 
to 8.5 months compared to 6.7 mos for gem alone.  20 The cocktail of 5 -FU, oxaliplatin, irinotecan and 
leucovorin (FOLFIRINOX) improved OS in the first line setting to 11.1 mos when compared to gem.19 In 
34 second- line chemo clinical trials reviewed by Rahma et al in 2013, pts who received treatments had a 
OS of 6 mos compared to those who received supportive care of 4 mos. Gem and platinum -based 
combinations provided a  PFS and OS of 4 and 6 mos, respectively' and the combination of 5 FU and 
Protocol version: 06/22/201508/25/2015  
,,05/27/2016  
 5 platinum agents provided a PFS and OS of 2.9 and 5.7 mos, respectively .21 With dismal response 
rates, PFS, and OS in clinical trials, innovative and novel therapeutic approaches are desperately 
needed to improve OS in pts with LAPC and MPC.   
 
2.3 EGFR (ERBB- 1 Receptor, HER1) as target.   
EGFR is over -expressed in 30- 50% of PC. In clinical trials, small molecule inhibitors that target the 
intracellular tyrosine kinase signaling pathways of EGFR, such as gefitinib (Iressa®) or erlotinib 
(Tarceva®) have been tested without major impact on dis ease.  Though cetuximab was approved by the 
FDA in 2004 for the treatment of metastatic colon cancer, results from a study in PC with gem and 
cetuximab were disappointing.22 Therefore, cetuximab alone is not effective. Alternative strategies that 
exploit and directly target EGFR over -expression using the targeting ability of cetuximab circumvent the 
activational or mutation status of EGFR may be more effective at killing tumor cells than antibody alone.  
2.4. EGFR BATs:  
Arming anti -CD3 activated T cells (ATC) with anti -CD3 
x anti -EGFR bispecific antibody (EGFRBi) makes every 
T cell into a non- MHC restricted EGFR -specific 
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL).
23,24 Anti-CD3 x anti -
HER2 bispecific  antibody (BiAb) armed ATC (HER2 
BATs)  showed repeated killing, proliferation, and 
release of Th 1 cytokines, Regulated on Activation 
Normal T Expressed and Secreted (RANTES=CCL5), 
macrophage inhibitory protein- 1 alpha (MIP -1α), 
interferon- γ (IFN -γ), tumor necrosis factor -α (TNF -
α),and GM -CSF that induce DC maturation. Dying 
tumor cells release tumor associated antigens (TAA), 
that can lead to increased cross -presentation of TAA 
by antigen presenting cells (DC). This mechanism, 
illustrated in Fig 1 , may vaccinate pts against their own 
TAAs.  Preclinical studies showed that EGFRBi armed 
ATC (EGFR BATs) killed pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaCA, secreted cytokines, and inhibited tumor growth in mice.
24  
2.5. Unarmed ATC as mobile serial killers and immunokine factories.   
Cross -linking the T cell receptor with anti -CD3 triggers activation, proliferation, cytokine synthesis, and 
non-MHC restricted cytotoxicity directed at tumor targets.25-28 The tumoricidal cytokines produced include 
IFN-γ, TNF -α, and GM -CSF.29-39 In animals, infusions of ATC provide anti -tumor effects40-43 and improve 
engraftment when limiting doses of stem cells were given after lethal total body irradiation.44 In humans, a 
phase I trial treating pts with cyclophosphamide followed by infusions of activated CD4+ cells resulted in 1 
complete, 2 partial and 8 minor responses in 31 advanced cancer pts.45,46 If nonspecific ATC had 
enhanced cancer -directed activity after chemoT, BATs may have even greater anti -tumor activity.  
Fig 1:  Infusion of targeted T cells induces anti -tumor immune 
responses. T cells kill tumor cells releasing cytokines and 
chemokines that induce DC maturation followed by antigen 
presentation of unknown tumor antigens to “vaccinate” the patient 
against their own TAAs.

 6 2.6. HER2 BATs  Target high HER2 SK -BR-3 and 
low HER2 SUM 1315 expression cell lines.   
Our preclinical studies showed that HER2 BATs 
killed breast cancer cells lines that expressed not 
only high amounts of HER2 (SK -BR-3, high 3+ 
expression) but, more importantly, target and lyse 
cell lines that express little (MCF- 7, a negative 
control for I HC)47 or essentially no HER2 expression 
(Sum 1315). Using goat anti -HER2/neu Ab to detect 
HER2/ neu receptors on the cells, we showed that 
Sum 1315 was only 6.7% HER2 positive by flow 
cytometry ( Fig 2b) and negative for HER2 
expression by Western blotting ( Fig 2a).  Fig 2c  
shows high levels of specific cytotoxicity of HER2 
BATs directed at both Sum 1315 and SK -BR-3 cells 
using an arming dose of 50 ng/106 ATC at the 
effector:target (E:T) ratios depicted in Fig 2a. This is 
consi stent with the observation that as few as 10- 30 
T cell receptor (TCR) -ligand interactions are 
sufficient to mediate T cell killing.48 Arming doses of 
50, 1.0, and 0.05 ng of BiAb/106 ATC led to 4000, 80, 
and 4 dimers/cell, respectiv ely (assuming 20% dimer 
and 20% of BiAb actually binding to the T cells). 
Therefore, it is clear that only a few molecules of 
HER2Bi on ATC and a few HER2  on 
the surface of tumor cells are sufficient to allow binding and 
triggering of high levels of specif ic 
cytotoxicity.     
2.7. Phase I Safety, Immune and 
Clinical Responses in Metastatic  
Breast Cancer (MBC).   
HER2 BATs exhibit anti -HER2 
cytotoxicity, proliferate, and secrete 
immunokines upon tumor 
engagement. In our phase I trial, 23 
women with HER2 0- 3+ MBC 
received 8 infusions of HER2 BATs 
(twice a week for 4 weeks) in 
combination with IL -2 and GM -CSF 
to evaluate safety, feasibility, PFS, OS, T cell trafficking and immune 
responses. The median OS for 8 
HER2 3+ pts, 14 HER2 0- 2+ pts, 
and all pts was 57.4, 27.4, and 36.2 
mos, respectively ( Fig 3c). One 
HER2 1+ pt who was progressing 
on Femara developed a very good 
partial response (nearly complete 
response) that persisted at 7 mos 
(Fig 3d ). BATs persisted in the

 7 blood for at least a week and trafficked to tumors. Targeting HER2 positive and negative tumors induced 
cytotoxic anti -tumor responses, increases in Th 1 cytokines, and IL -12 serum levels. These robust immune 
responses suggest HER2 BATs infusions may provide a clinical benefit.49,50 
2.7.1. Evidence for activation and 
Immunization of endogenous immune cells in 
MBC pts.  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMC ) exhibited high levels of cytotoxicity 
directed at SK -BR-3 that persisted up to 4 mos 51. 
Fig 4 shows specific cytotoxicity mediated by 
endogenous lymphocytes (IgG2a negative 
population) directed against SK -BR-3 in two 
representative pts. PBMC from these pts were 
depleted of IgG2a+ bearing cells (ATC) using 
Miltenyi columns and the IgG2a negative 
population was used in the killing assay. The 
results strongly suggest that endogenous 
lymphocytes had developed robust immune 
responses to breast cancer antigens. There were 
significant increases in serum Th 1 cytokines ( Fig 
3a) and IL- 12 ( Fig 3b)50 during and after 
infusions. The marked increases in serum IL -12 (Fig 3b)  show that 
monocytes are activated by BATs infusions and secrete high levels 
of IL-12. 
2.7.2. No Human Anti -Mouse Antibody (HAMA) responses. 
Because anti -CD3 mAb moiety comprising the BiAb is a murine 
IgG2a monoclonal antibody (m Ab), we evaluated pts’ sera before 
and after HER2 BATs infusions for the development of HAMA to IgG2a in an ELISA and did not detect clinically significant levels of 
IgG anti -mouse. Of the 10 pts evaluated, none developed levels > 10 
ng/ml during or up to 8 weeks after immunotherapy.  
A.7.3. Vaccination with BATs infusions and Boost after Stem 
Cell Transplant (SCT) with ‘Immune’ ATC.  In 5 evaluable MBC pts 
who had undergone the phase I clinical trial consisting of 8 infusions of HER2 BATs in combination with low dose IL- 2 and GM -CSF, a 
second leukapheresis was performed to obtain "anti -breast cancer 
immune" PBMC. PBMC after 8 infusions of BATs before the second expansion exhibited specific cytotoxicity directed at SK -BR-3 ranged 
from 2 to 38% with a median of 26%.  ATC were produced and 
cryopreserved for multiple infusions (4- 15 infusions) after high dose 
chemo and SCT. Two pts at Roger Williams Hospital received up to 
10
10 immune ATC 3 times per week for 3 weeks and then once 
weekly infusions of 2 x 1010 ATC for 6 weeks and 4 pts at KCI 
received ATC once per week for 4 weeks. Fig 5a  shows immediate 
non-MHC restricted specific cytotoxicity mediated by uncultured 
PBMC directed at SK -BR-3 targets at the designated time points for 
IT and post SCT for 5 pts. There were significant serum titers of anti -
SK-BR-3 that increased after the vaccination with 8 HER2 BATs 
infusions and high levels of anti -SK-BR-3 IgG antibody titers were 
present at the various time points after HDC and SCT up to 2 years after SCT (data not shown).  In order to confirm that transferred memory B cells were responsible for the serum antibodies were transferred in 
the stem cell product, fresh PBMC from 5 pts were re- stimulated in vitro with SK -BR-3 targeted T cells FG91801

 8 and CpG using a new assay fo r inducing anti -tumor antibodies in 
vitro.52  The 14 day culture supernatants contained anti -breast 
cancer antibodies befor e and after SCT. In other words, the stem 
cell product contained memory B cells that produce anti -breast 
cancer antibodies when re- stimulated in vitro ( Fig 5b) . Together, 
this proof -of-concept pilot study shows that both cellular and 
humoral anti -tumor imm une responses can be detected during and 
after IT, and these immune responses can be transferred via the 
"immune" ATC.  
2.7.4.Summary of HER2 BATs.  The HER2 BATS infused into 
MBC pts in the phase I were safe and induced immune and clinical 
responses. BATs infusions induced endogenous immune cells to 
develop anti -breast cancer CTL and serum antibody activity that 
could be transferred in pts after autologous SCT in multiple 
infusions of immune ATC which provided anti -tumor specific helper 
activity for antibody synthesis. These studies provide PROOF of 
CONCEPT that BATs can vaccinate pt against their own tumor 
antigens and the memory effector T cells and 
specific antibody forming B cells can be 
transferred and be easily detected after HDC and 
SCT.  
2.8. Preclinical Data that support proposed 
research:  
A.8.1 EGFR BiAb redirects non- MHC restricted 
cytotoxicity of ATC. Based on the ex perience 
generated with HER2 BATs, EGFR directed BATs 
were generated. EGFR is expressed in several 
epithelial cancers including non- small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC). In NSCLC addition of EGFR 
directed antibodies (cetuximab and necitumumab) 
to chemo has shown modest improvement in 
survival.53,54 The degree of binding of EGFR BATs 
to the EGFR -positive NSCLC cell line, A549, 
compared to an EGFR -negative cell line, MDA -
MB-453, was evaluated using phycoerythrin -
conjugated (PE) goat anti -mouse IgG2a to detect 
the OKT3 (anti -CD3) moiety of the BiAb ( Fig 6). 
EGFR  BATs binding to A549 cells 
was consistent with their expression 
of EGFR; in contrast, EGFR BATs 
bound just above the background of 
the isotype control to MDA -MB-453 
cells. A representative histogram of the background binding for an 
isotype control to A549 is also 
shown.  
Fig 7:  1) Anti -CD3 (OKT3, Centrocor Ortho -Biotech, Raritan, NJ) was 
cross -linked with Traut’s reagent (2- iminothiolane HCl, Pierce); 2) Anti -
EGFR was cross -linked with sulphosuccinimidyl 4- (N-male imido methyl) 
cyclohexane- 1-carboxylate (Sulpho- SMCC); and 3) Cross linked 
monoclonal antibodies were desalted on PD -10 columns (Pharmacia, 
Uppsala, Sweden) to remove unbound cross -linker.  The cross -linked 
OKT3 and anti -EGFR will be heteroconjugated overnight.  
Fig 8 Antiproliferative effects of EGFR BATs 
compared with mAbs (cetuximab) or 
unarmed ATC against COLO 356/FG cells. 
COLO 356/FG cells were treated with unconjugated OKT3 (anti -CD3) or 
cetuximab (500 ng/well), unarmed  
ATC (107/well), EGFR BATSs (107/well 
armed wi h 50 ng EGFRBi/106 ATC), or a 
combination of the mAbs with unarmed 
ATC. COLO 356/FG cells were counted 
after 72 hours. Results from three 
independent experiments are shown as the 
number of cells for each treatment as a % of 
the cells cultured with medium only. After 72 
hours, the cells in the control wells had 
gone  through 1.5 doublings. Bars = SD.

CD3  moiety of the BiAb. A representative histogram ( peak

 9 2.8.2 Production of EGFRBi.  The production of anti -CD3 x anti -
EGFR (OKT3 x cetuximab) BiAb by chemical heteroconjugation has 
been described ( Fig 7).47 The heteroconjugated product is analyzed 
by non- reducing SDS-PAGE and quantified by densitometry using 
Quantity One software (Bio- Rad, CA). EGFR BATs  are prepared and 
quality controlled and assured per SOP to be pathogen free, and 
endotoxin levels are quantitated and approved for use by the FDA (IND 
13091.47,55 
2.8.3. In vitro  and in vivo characterization studies of EGFR BATs 
performed in a pancreatic cancer cell line.  Much of the preliminary 
characterization of EGFR BATs was initially performed using the 
pancreatic carcinoma cell line, COLO 356/FG (FG), which 
demonstrates sensitivity to EGFR BATs -mediated cytotoxicity. We 
compared the anti -proliferative effect of EGFR BATs to cetux imab in 
cell proliferation assays. ATC alone, EGFR BATs (E:T of 10) or 
equivalent concentrations of unconjugated monoclonal antibodies 
(anti-CD3 or cetuximab) were co- cultured with FG cells. After 72-
hours, surviving FG cells were harvested and counted usi ng a 
Coulter Particle Counter. Results ( Fig 8 ), expressed as the number 
treated cells as a % of FG target cells plated alone (mean ± SD) from 
3 independent experiments, show that although cetuximab alone 
was ineffective (p > 0.05 compared to control) at inhibiting 
proliferation of FG, EGFR BATs induced significant killing 
(p<0.001) of the same target cells.  When FG was grown as subcutaneous xenografts in a SCID -Beige 
mouse model (T -, B-, and NK cell deficient model), cetuximab (1 mg/week) administered intravenously for 
6 weeks significantly delayed tumor growth compared to 
ATC alone or medium administered on the same schedule, 
but EGFR BATs administered at a 1000 -fold lower dose (20

mg cetuximab/week ) produced comparable tumor growth 
inhibition ( Fig 9). No gross toxicities were observed in any of 
the treated groups of mice. Body weights of mice over the 
course of treatments were significantly lower (6- 8%) in the 
unarmed ATC treatment group (p < 0.001) , but did not differ 
significantly between the other 3 treatment groups. Post -
mortem necropsy of vital organs showed significant 23- 30% 
and 22- 32% increases in liver and kidney weights, 
respectively, in the mice treated with cetuximab compared to 
the other  3 treatment groups; liver and kidney 
are the primary target organs for EGFR -
targeted toxicities. These findings are 
consistent with observations from preclinical 
and clinical studies exploring other EGFR -
targeted therapeutics.56,57  Importantly, 
compared to cetuximab, EGFR BATs showed no evidence of organ toxicities in our preclinical 
studies and produced comparable tumor 
growth delay suggesting that EGFR BATs may 
offer a wi der therapeutic window with regard to 
safety. The EGFR BATs total dose used in these mice is equivalent to a 3.2 x 10

2.9. Phase I Clinical Trial targeting colorectal and pancreatic cancer with EGFR BATs.  
Five PC and 6 colorectal cancer pts received up to 78.8 x 10
10 
(median of 43, range 20.4 -  78.8 x 109) EGFR BATs in 3 -4 
doses given once per week for 3 weeks followed by a boost at 
12 weeks. There were no DLTs. The planned doses were 10, 
20, and 40 x 109 BATs/infusion. The OS for the entire group, 
the colorectal, and pancreatic cancer pts was 13.6, 13.2, and 
14.5 mos, respectively ( Fig 10) . Most remarkable are the PC 
pts. Three are alive at 664, 333, and 284 days after pheresis, 
and two died at 375 (IT20087) and 408 (IT20092) days after study enrollment ( Table 1 as of 5/26/2015). Fig 11 shows the 
cytotoxicity mediated by fresh PBMC from pt against PC cell

γ EliSpots (right panel).  Fig 12 shows cytotoxicity of PBMC from 9 of the pts before (preIT) and 2 weeks 
post infusions #3 directed at a colorectal cell line. These data suggest that IT may sensitize or make 
tumor cells more susceptible to chemo leading to remarkable complete responses. Pt IT20102 had an 
abdominal lymph node decrease in size at 3 mos, received his booster infusion, and decreased by 27% 
at 6 mos on CT scan. This pt was interviewed (with consent) by the local Fox News affiliate. His story is

2.9.1. Toxicity of EGFR BATs.  There 
have been no DLTs and only eleven 
episodes of Grade 2 toxicities ( Table 
2). There were no grade 3 or 4 
toxicities. Toxicities related to the 
cellular infusion typically resolved with 
medication within 24- 48 hours after an 
infusion.59 
2.10. Summary of Preliminary Data 
on In vitro and Clinical Use of EGFR 
BATs.  
Our preclinical studies clearly show 
that EGFR BATs lyse EGFR positive 
colorectal and pancreatic cell lines in 
vitro and significantly inhibited the 
growth of EGFR positive tumors in immunodeficient mice.  The phase I 
clinical trial in colorectal and pancr eatic 
cancer pts was particularly 
encouraging and remarkable in the PC 
pts who, as summarized in Table 1, 
had substantial amounts of metastatic disease.  A median survival of 14.5 mos with a near PR in IT20102 
without any other treatment, and complete responses (CR), and a persistent CR response to 
chemotherapy in IT20104 are striking.  It is not clear what the mechanism is for responses to chemotherapy in IT20091 and IT20104.  Our working hypothesis is that immunotherapy sensitized the 
tumor or modulated t he tumor so that subsequent chemotherapy was more effective.  Studies to dissect 
and understand these results are underway.

 4. TREATMENT PLAN  
4.1 Treatment Summary  
One treatment of chemotherapy  (see section 4.2)  will be given 1- 2 week s before immunotherapy to 
create immunologic space before the infusions of EGFR BATs. In the single dose phase I portion of this 
study involving 3- 6 pt, we will conf irm the safety of twice weekly infusions of  up to 10
10 EGFR BATs 
infusions in combination with 300,000 IU of interleukin 2 (IL- 2)/m2/day and 250 µg granulocyte-
macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM -CSF)/m2/twice weekly beginning 3 days before the 1st infusion 
and ending on the day of the last infusion.   The pt will receive a single treatment with chemotherapy  up to 
Protocol version: 06/ 22/201508/25/2015  
,,05/27/2016  
 13 1-2 week s prior to starting t he BATs infusions .  If there is toxicity in 1 of 3 pt, 3 additional pt will be added 
to the dose level of  up to  1010.  If 2 of 6 pt experience DLTs, then the dose will be reduced to 7.5 x 109 
per infusion.  If only 1 pt has toxicity in the first 6, then the study will proceed to enroll the remaining 
cohort of pt in the phase II.   
 
In the phase II portion of this study, we will estimate the clinical efficacy of 8 infusions of 1010 EGFR BATs 
in combination with IL- 2 and GM -CSF in 39 evaluable pt (including the 3- 6 pt in the abovementioned 
single dose phase I). The primary endpoint is an improvement in median OS  from historical data of 7 mos 
to 10.5 mo.  
 
Immune evaluations will be performed to determine if: a) infusions of EGFR BATs significantly increase cellular or humoral anti -PC responses at 8 weeks after last EGFR BATs infusion and if those responses 
persist  at 26 weeks or 52 weeks and b) immune responses correlate with clinical responses.  The original 
tumor paraffin blocks prior to treatment will be evaluated for the presence of CD3, CD4, CD8, PD1/PDL1, 
monocytes subpopulations, MDSC, and cytoplasmic IFN -γ and IL -10 by Immunohistochemical staining. 
The type and number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the tumor microenvironment will be 
correlated with clinical responses.  
 
If the pt does not have rapidly progressive disease 2 mos after the last infusion, the treatment may be 
repeated. If the pt has significant progression of disease, the pt will receive oncologist choice of 
chemotherapy. Oncologist choice chemotherapy will be given starting 30 days after the last BATs 
infusion if the repeat tumor evaluation shows progression of disease . (The MDT team will specially 
discuss the management of each pt at the time of progression).  The pt will continue to be followed 
for disease and overall survival status and blood studies may be done optionally to continue evaluate 
immune responses to tumor every 3 months.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate clinical efficacy and to confirm the safety at a dose up to 
10
10 EGFR BATs per infusions for 8 infu sions. The primary endpoint is OS  with the design to determine 
Figure 13  
Protocol version: 06/ 22/201508/25/2015  
,,05/27/2016  
 14 whether infusions of BAT s in PC pts could impro ve the median OS from 7 mos to 10.5 mos. Given the 
poor prognosis for patients with metastatic or locally advanced PC, we will also follow the patients to 
determine if immunotherapy followed by chemotherapy improve clinical responses over historical 
responses and improves progression free survival . Patients who are stable, partial responders, or 
complete responders by RECIST criteria are eligible for re -treatment with BAT s.  
 The secondary objectives are: 1) immune evaluation studies to determine if infusions of BATs 
significantly increase cellular or humoral anti -PC responses at 8 weeks after last BAT s infusion and if 
those responses persist at 26 weeks or 52 weeks; and 2) progression free survival . 
 
Each pt will be given two infusions per week with doses ranging up to 10 x 1091010 per infusions per 
week for 4 weeks in a row .  Restaging CT and immune evaluations will be done 8  weeks after the last 
BATs infusions  and then every 2 months as per standard of care until disease progression.  
 
Baseline serum and cell will be aliquoted from the pheresis. Blood draws (4 green top tubes containing 
approximately 40 mls of anti -coagulated blood and 1 red top tube containing  8 mls of serum) will be pre-
BAT infusion, after the 4th infusion, and then approximately 2 weeks (14±4 days), 2 months  (60 days±7 
days, optional), 4 months (120 days±7 days) and optionally every 6 months (180 days±7 days) after 
the last infusion.  Optional IEs will be done if there continue to be immune responses at 6 month (± 2 
weeks)  intervals until the responses have disappeared.   
 
 
Given the poor prognosis for patien ts with advanced pancreatic cancer, we will also follow the patients to 
determine if immunotherapy has any impact on survival and response rate (secondary endpoint). Patients 
who are stable, partial responders, or complete responders by RECIST criteria are eligible for re-
treatment with EGFR BATs. Patients who show evidence of progression at 8 weeks after the last BATs 
infusion will be given oncologist’s choice chemotherapy.  
 
4.2 Chemotherapy  
The time from leukopheresis to harvest of ATC is about 3 weeks. One treatment of s tandard  
chemotherapy : 1) gemcitabine;  2) gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel ; 3) modified FOLFOX6  (oxaliplatin, 5-
fluorouracil and leucovorin);  or 4) FOLFIRINOX  (5-fluorouracil,  leucovorin,  irinotecan, and oxalipalatin)  to 
create immune space.  In patients  with advanced pancreatic cancer with no other standard chemotherapy 
available or allergy , immunotherapy may be given within 1 week after a single dose of cyclophosphamide 
(1 gram /m2). 
 
4.3 Immunotherapy    
4.3.1 EGFR BATs infusions:   EGFR BATs infusions will be done in an outpatient setting at KCI.  All 
appropriate assurances for identification of product, patient, sterility, etc. will be performed prior to 
infusion.  The identity of the frozen BATs will be verified with patient’s identifiers and thawed at the 
bedside of the pt just prior to infusion.  BAT s will be infused intravenously (IV) with the rate of infusion 
based on the endotoxin content of the product.  All patients will be observed for at least 4 hours after an infusion.  If stable, patients will be discharged home.  BATs infusions will begin approximately 1- 2 weeks 
after chemotherapy and the subsequent doses will be administered twice weekly for 4 weeks.  
 
4.3.2  Subcutaneous IL- 2 Injections :  All patients will receive SQ IL- 2 (300,000 IU/m
2/day),  beginning 
3 days before the first ATC infusion and ending at  the last  BATs  infusion.  
 
4.3.3  GM-CSF Injections:   All patients will receive SQ GM -CSF (150 µg/m2/daily), to start 3 days 
before the first ATC infusion and ending at  the last BATs  infusion.  
 
Protocol version: 06/ 22/201508/25/2015  
,,05/27/2016  
 15 4.4 Recommended Concomitant Medications:   
Anti-emetics such as ondansetron, dolasetron, or granisetron should be used prior to chemotherapy .   30 
minutes prior to each EGFR  BATs infusions , all patients will be pre- medicated with Benadryl (50 mg IV or 
PO) and Tylenol 650 mg PO.  Demerol (25- 50 mg IV) will also be administered post infusion if the pt 
develops grade 3 chills and then may be administered 30 minutes prior to subsequent BATs infusions 
dependent upon the severity of the initial reaction.  The pt will alternate ibuprofen 600 mg every 8 hours 
with acetominophen 650 mg every 8 hours for 24 hours after the BATs infusion.  
• Ancillary Therapy:   
Patients will receive full supportive care including transfusion of blood and blood products, antibiotics, 
and anti -emetics, when appropriate.  The reason(s) for treatment, dosage and the dates of treatment  
will be recorded.  
• Steroids/Other Therapy:    
With the exception of steroids for anti -emetic regimen, adrenal failure, septic shock, pulmonary 
toxicity or hormones administered for non- disease- related conditions (e.g. insulin for diabetes), 
steroids will not be administered.  The patients will stop hormonal therapy 1 week prior to 
immunotherapy.  Hydrocortisone (50 -100 mg IV every 6 hrs) for severe adverse reactions related to 
BATs  infusions is allowed.  Life-threatening reactions may be treated with Situximab (anti -IL-6 mab to 
control cytokine storm).  
 
4.5  Quality Control and Assurance of BAT s 
 Lists and lots of suppliers of mAbs, heteroconjugation reagents, and culture reagents are maintained. 
Release criteria for armed products for clinical use include: negative results for sterility check with ID (7 days, negative for mycoplasma, endotoxin les s than 2.5 EU/mL (otherwise a calculated infusion 
rate will be used to ensure the pt receives no more than 5 EU/kg/hr), ≥10% cytotoxicity directed at 
EGFR+ cancer cell line (25:1 E/T) compared to the respective unarmed ATC, >50% CD3+ cells and 
<10%: CD19, CD20, CD16; and CD56+ cells will be measured in ATC product.  
 
4.6 Tumor Measurements   
All tumors will be measured in millimeters or centimeters prior to initiation of therapy.  These measurements will consist of the longest diameter and the perpendicular  diameter at the widest portion of 
the tumor and will be made and recorded by the physician or his designee.  An estimate of overall objective and subjective response will be made and recorded at the end of treatment.  Disease status will 
be evaluated in t he patients and their responses will be confirmed a minimum of four (4) weeks after the 
first response has been recorded using standard RECIST 1.1  criteria. Responses will be noted as 
Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Minor Response (MR), Stable Disease (SD) or 
Progressive Disease (PD).  Duration of response will be measured from first observation of the response.  
All patients will be staged before IT and at designated follow up times after IT (see section 8).  
 
4.7  Accrual and Duration of Study   
Our anticipated accrual rate is 11 patients per year. Thus, it should take approximately 4 years to accrue 
the 43  patients needed for the trial. Allowing for 18 months of follow -up to obtain the primary endpoint on 
the last pt enrolled and 6 months to assem ble, analyze and interpret the data the total study duration is 
projected to be at most 6 years.  
4.8 Re-start Criteria    
    Patients removed from the study due to unrelated toxicity may be re- entered upon complete resolution 
of toxicity.  Re -entry criteria are the same criteria required for initial treatment.

,,05/27/2016  
 16 5.0 TOXICITIES, DOSE MODIFICATIONS AND MANAGEMENT  
 
5.1  Leukapheresis Procedure   
  Reported toxicity from leukopheresis is minimal. Patients have a small potential for infection from 
the placement of central catheters used for pheresis. Use of the anticoagulant citrate dextrose may 
cause symptoms of mild hypocalcemia,  which are controlled with calcium replacement.  
 5.2 Granulocyte- Macrophage- Colony Stimulating Factor (GM -CSF).  
 Therapeutic Classification:  Colony stimulating factor.  
Known Side Effects and Toxicities:  Patients receiving GM -CSF (Leukine- Sagramostim) have 
experienced fever 60- 90 min after administration (duration 1 -4 hrs); chills; nausea; vomiting; 
diarrhea; fatigue; weakness; headache; decreased appetite; thrombosis; rapid or irregular heartbeat 
or other heart problems; feeling of faintness; facial fl ushing; pain in the bones, muscles, chest, 
abdomen, or joints; local reaction at the site of injection; rashes; and kidney and liver dysfunction. 
Eosinophilia or other blood component abnormalities may occur.  There have been infrequent 
reports of fluid ac cumulation or worsening of preexisting fluid accumulation in the extremities, in the 
lungs, and around the heart which may result in breathing problems or heart failure.  Rarely, 
patients have developed acute allergic reactions.  There have also been repor ts of low blood 
pressure, hypoxia, transient loss of consciousness, and difficulty in breathing after the first injection 
of Sargramostim. These signs may or may not recur with additional injections of Sargramostim.  
Patients with prior heart, lung, kidney , or liver problems may have worsening of their symptoms 
following administration of Sargramostim. There may be other side effects that could occur.  
 
5.3 Toxicity of Low -Dose Subcutanous (SQ) Interleukin 2 (IL- 2). Therapeutic classification:  
Lymphokine Known Side Effects and Toxicities:  Administration of low dose SQ IL- 2 (2 × 10
5 
IU/m2/day) for 90 days resulted in no grade III toxicities.  None of the patients experienced 
pulmonary capillary leak syndrome, severe hypotension, oliguria, azotemia, or hyperbilirubinemia.  
The most frequent toxicities included fatigue, fever, and nausea. None of the patients had to stop 
their SQ IL -2 therapy due to side effects.  Therefore, it is unlikely that major toxicities associated 
with the low dose SQ IL- 2 will occur al though death due to high dose IL- 2 toxicity has been 
reported.60. 
    
5.4  EGFR BATs 
Toxicity associated with BATs  has been minimal. The reported symptoms have been reversible with 
cessation of therapy.  Most patients treated with BAT s some  experienced chills , headaches, fati gue, and 
hypotension after infusions.  Fever , chills , fati gue, and headache were the most comm on reactions.  
Other rarely reported effects included mild gastrointestinal and neurologic symptoms.  
 
5.4.1 Dose Modification for EGFRBi -armed ATC -related Toxicities    
     All patients with treatment related, grade 4 non- hematologic toxicity will be removed. If the left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF by MUGA) falls by more than 10% from the previous value after 
EGFRBi BATs , therapy will be withheld and the pt removed fr om the protocol (no one has been removed 
for cardiac -related toxicities in our phase I study).  If there is persistent grade- 3 toxicity at any time, 
treatment will be held until toxicity improves to grade 0 or 1. If grade 3 toxicities recur, the BATs  infus ions 
will be stopped (this would be considered a DLT).  Toxicity will be assessed daily for 7 days after each 
reinfusion and then weekly for unresolved toxicities.  
 
   It is anticipated that in some cases, maximal T- cell expansion will not achieve the desi red dose per 
infusion. In this case, the available T -cells will still be infused in 8 divided doses. Patients who receive 
less than this dose will be evaluable for clinical efficacy and immune responses.

5.5 Monitoring of patients getting chemotherapy    
 The major toxicities expected with chemotherapy are myelosuppression, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
neuropathy and loss of appetite. No dose modification is planned since patients are receiving only one 
course of treatment.  No prophy lactic antibiotics are planned. The patients will receive prophylactic anti -
emetics and will be monitored for signs of acute toxicity.  
 
 
5.5.1. Cetuximab toxicity 
   Acne -like Rash : The most common adverse event associated with cetuximab administration is acne-
like rash. Acne- like rash usually occurs on the face, upper chest, and back, but occasionally extends to 
the extremities and is characterized by multiple follicular or pustular appearing lesions characterized 
histologically as a lymphocytic perifollic ulitis or suppurative superficial folliculitis. The onset of rash is 
generally within the first 2 weeks of therapy.  
   A number of therapeutic interventions have been attempted, including oral and topical antibiotics, 
topical steroids, and rarely, oral steroids. The value of these measures is unknown since definitive clinical 
trials have not bee performed. The etiology of the acne- like skin rash is believed to be the result of 
cetuximab binding to EGFR in the epidermis.  When cetuximab was  chemically heteroconjugated to OKT3 
in the bispecific antibody format and infused on activated T cells in the phase I clinical trials, there were 
no nail disorders, allergic reactions , acute infusional reactions, cardiac toxicities, or skin rashes ( Choi 
2015, GI ASCO abstract).  
 
Nail Disorder : Nail disorders were reported in 6.4% of patients receiving cetuximab as a single agent. The 
nail disorder is characterized as paronychial inflammation with associated swelling of the lateral nail folds of the toes and fingers. The most commonly affected digits are the great toes and thumbs. According to 
investigators, the nail disorder persists for up to 3 months after discontinuation of cetuximab.  Soaks in 
aluminum acetate (Burow’s) solution BID -QID will prevent secondary infect ion. Symptom relief may be 
achieved with standard bandages or with the application of liquid bandages (cyanoacrylate preparations). 
Preliminary analysis in patients treated at usual doses (400 mg/m
2 initial dose, followed by 250 mg/m2 
weekly), revealed that the incidence of nail disorders is greater in patients who received more than 6 infusions (approximately10%) compared to patients treated with 6 or less infusion of cetuximab 
(approximately 3%).  
 
Allergic Reactions : The majority of the allergic/hypersens itivity reactions described have been grade 1 to 
2 toxicities with less occurrences of grade 3 -4. All reactions responded promptly to appropriate medical 
intervention.  
 
Infusion Reaction: Infusion reactions are distinct from allergic or hypersensitivity reactions, although 
some of the manifestation are overlapping. Infusion reactions generally develop during or shortly after the 
infusion. Mild infusion reactions (chills, fever, dyspnea) have been reported in 23% of patients receiving 
cetuximab as a single agent. Severe infusion reactions (airway obstruction [bronchospasm, stridor, 
hoarseness], urticaria, hypotension) were reported in 2% of patients receiving single agent cetuximab. 
Infusion reactions occur most often with the first dose.  
 
Pulmonary Toxicity : Interstitial lung disease has been reported in less than 1% of patients who have 
received cetuximab for advanced colorectal cancer, and in one pt with head and neck cancer.  
 
Cardiac Toxicity : Recent reports described the occurrence of cardiac dysfunction,  chest pain, and/or 
cardiac ischemia/infarction. These events occurred in patients who were receiving cetuximab in addition to 5-FU-containing therapy. Cardiac ischemia/infarction and acute cariomyopathy are known side effects

6.4 Leucov orin: Leucovorin is commercially available in parenteral formulations (3 - and 5- mg 
ampules; 50- ,100-  and 350- mg vials). In situations where leucovorin (folinic acid) is not available 
because of shortage, then the pure l -stereioisomer, levoleucovorin (levo- folinic acid) may be 
administered as a substitute, at one- half of the protocol -stipulated leucovorin dose (200 mg/m2 of 
levoleucovorin in most situations) in order to facilitate continuity of pt care.  
 
6.4.1   Leucovorin Storage and Preparation : All dosage forms are stored at room temperature. 
The reconstituted parenteral solution,10 mg/mL, is stable for at least 7 days at room temperature. 
At concentrations of 0.5 to 0.9 mg/mL the drug is chemically stable for at least 24 hours at room 
temperature under no rmal laboratory light. The 50-  and 100- mg vials for injection are 
reconstituted with 5 and 10 mL of sterile water or bacteriostatic water, respectively, resulting in a 
10-mg/mL solution. The 350- mg vial is reconstituted with 17 mL of sterile water resulting in a 20-
mg/mL solution. Leucovorin (0.5– 0.9 mg/mL) is chemically stable for at least 24 hours in normal 
saline, 5% dextrose, 10% dextrose, Ringer's injection, or lactated Ringer's injection. Leucovorin 
(0.03, 0.24, and 0.96 mg/mL) is stable for 48 hours at room and refrigeration temperatures when 
admixed with floxuridine (FUDR, 1, 2, and 4 mg/mL) in normal saline. Leucovorin is also

Protocol version: 0 6/22/2015  9.0 CRITERIA FOR RESPONSE, PRO GRESSION, AND RELAPSE  
9.1 Tumor Measurements  
All tumor measurements will be measured in centimeters prior to initiation of therapy.  These 
measurements should be done according to Wolchok criteria.  An estimate of overall objective and 
subjective response will be made and recorded at the end of treatment, 2 months after the first 
infusion. Since it is expected that immune activity would lead to tumor flare, the restaging CT’s may be repeated 2 months later based on immune- related response criteria (irRC) .
61,62  and the 
designation of CR, PR, SD, or PD will be made at that time.   
 
9.2 Response Definitions: Response will be defined by using the irRC criteria with the allowance of an 
initial mild PD due to the nature of immunologic therapies as above.  
 
“Only measurable lesions are taken into consideration. Measures are taken bidimensionally for 
each lesion. Measurability is defined as 5 × 5 mm or more on helical computer tomography scans. 
The sum of the perpendicular diameters (SPD) of index lesions at baseline is added to that of 
new lesions to calculate total tumor burden according to the following formula:  
 
Tumor Burden = SPD index  lesions  +SPD  new, measurable lesions  
 Response categories are defined as immune- related complete response (irCR), immune -related 
partial response (irPR), immune- related stable disease (irSD), and immune- related progressive 
disease (irPD) using the same thresholds defined by standard WHO criter ia”. Decreases in total 
measurable tumor burden compared to the baseline tumor burden  (SPD of all index lesions at 
baseline) . irPD should be confirmed at 2 consecutive times  mandated for irPR or irCR.  New lesions 
are allowed when the overall tumor burden d ecreases qualifying for partial response (≥50% 
decrease) or stable disease (<50% decrease to >25% increase)  as described inTable 2. These new 
patterns are considered clinically meaningful because they appear to be associated with favorable 
surviva l.
61,63 Importantly, early increases in the size of lesions may be due to infiltration of 
lymphocytes  and does not preclude an irCR, irPR, or irSD at the next consecutive time point.  If a pt 
is classified as having irPD, confirmation by a second scan in the absence of rapid clinical 
deterioration is required. Thus, the definition of confirmation of progression represents an 
increase in tumor burden of at least 25% compared with baseline at two consecutive time 
points at least 4 weeks apart. It is recommended that this confirmation be done at the discretion of the investigator in the context of the patient’s tumor type, disease stage, and 

Protocol version: 06/ 22/2015, 05/27/2016  
 
 25 clinical status because awaiting a response after tumor burden increase may not be 
appropriate for patients with rapid symptomatic progression accompanied by a decline in 
performance status. ” 
 
9.2.1  Complete Response ( irCR): Disappearance of all clinical evidence of active tumor for a 
minimum of eight (8) weeks.  The pt must be free of all symptoms.  All measurable, evaluable 
and non- evaluable lesions and sites must be assessed.  
 
9.2.2  Partial Response ( irPR): a decrease ≥ 50% decrease in SPD  compared to the baseline SPD . 
This category includes changes in non- index lesions and new, nonmeasurable lesions under 
“non measurable response” in Table 2.  Unequivocal progression of non- index lesions if there 
is a decrease ≥ 50% in SP D is an irPR.  
 
9.2.3 Stable Disease ( irSD): a decrease <50% to <25% of index and new, and measurable lesions 
with absent/stable non- index lesions or any new, non measurable lesions . 
 
9.2.4 Progressive Disease (irPD):  ≥ 25% increase with any non- index lesi ons and any new, 
nonmeasurable lesions.  
 9.3 Evaluation of best overall response.  The best overall response is the best response recorded from 
the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). In general, the patient's best respon se assignment 
will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.  
 
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without 
objective evidence of disease progression at that time will be classified as having “symptomatic 
deterioration”. Every effort will be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation 
of treatment.  
 
In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When the 
evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, the residual lesion may be investigated 
(fine needle aspirate/biopsy), if possible, to confirm the complete response status.  
 
9.4 Duration of overall response.   The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever status i s recorded first) until the first date that 
recurrence or PD is objectively documented, taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started.  
 
9.5  Duration of stable disease.   SD is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for 
disease progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started.  
 
9.6  Reporting of results.   All patients included in the study will be assessed for response to treatment, 
even if there are major protocol treatment deviations. Each pt will be assigned one of the following 
categories: 1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early 
death from malignant disease, 6) early death from t oxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 8) 
unknown (not assessable, insufficient data). Patients with no measurable disease at the start of treatment will be evaluated based on recurrence -free survival.  
 
9.7  Additional Assessments.   All patien ts will have a baseline tumor marker assessment and testing of 
tumor markers at the designated follow -up time points. Changes in serial tumor marker measurements, in 
Protocol version: 06/ 22/2015, 05/27/2016  
 
 26 those patients who have baseline elevations, will be utilized as a surrogate marker of cli nical response, 
stable disease or disease progression and reported as such.  
 
9.8  Patients without residual disease:   Patients whose primary tumor or metastatic disease has been 
removed or successfully treated, respectively, prior to entry into the phase I trial will be evaluated based 
on duration of relapse -free survival.  
 
9.9. Progression free survival: length of time from enrollment in the study until disease progression or 
death.   
 
10.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL OF PATIENTS FROM STUDY  
 
10.1  Disease Progression:  Patients with progressive disease following BATs  infusions will be removed 
from treatment , their disease pathologically documented, and the pt will be followed for survival and the 
immunologic endpoints.  
 
10.2  Extraordinary Medical Circumstances:  If at any time the constraints of this protocol are 
detrimental to the patient’s health, the pt shall be withdrawn from treatment. In this event:  
 10.2.1   Document reasons for withdrawal and record whether this action was pt or physician directed.  
 10.2.2   The pt will remain technically on- study although treatment has been discontinued. The patients 
will be followed for relapse and survival.  
 10.3 Unexpected or Life- Threatening Toxicity (CTCAE v4.0 Table):  
 10.3.1  Direct questions regarding drug therapy to the P rincipal Investigator.  
 
10.3.2   Reporting requirements and procedures depend upon: (1) whether agents are suspected of 
causing toxicity, (2) whether possibility of such a toxicity was reported in the consent form, or 
manufacturer’s literature (Published Toxicity), (3) the severity or grade of the toxicity.  
 
10.3.3  Expected toxicities include:  
 
10.3.3.1  Grade 4 myelosuppression: Report only as part of regular data submission.  
 10.3.3.2  All other toxicities, Grades 4: Written Report to Principal and Co- Inves tigators, within 10 working 
days.  
 10.3.3.3  All other toxicities, Grades 1 to 3: Report only as part of regular data submission.  
 10.3.4  Unexpected Toxicities:  Unexpected toxicities are toxicities that are not listed in the toxicity 
management section of the protocol, the consent form, or the manufacturer’s package insert. All 
unexpected toxicities will be reported to Principal and Co- Investigators, within 10 working days.

11.0 ADVERSE EVENT (AE) REPORTING  
WSU IRB Adverse Event reporting  
Adverse Event reporting t o begin after initiation of any immunotherapy drugs (IL -2 and GM -CSF).    
Adverse event reporting will be done in compliance with the Wayne State University Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) as follows:  
 
A.  Death or Life Threatening Adverse Reaction or Unexpected Event:  
If a death or immediately life- threatening Adverse Reaction/Unexpected Event occurs, it must be 
reported to the IRB office within five (5) business days of the PI becoming aware, even if the 
information in the report is incomplete. As more i nformation is forthcoming, one or more additional 
reports should be filed with the WSU IRB Administration Office. The initial report of the Adverse Reaction or Unexpected Event and follow -up reports should be filed using the IRB Unexpected 
Problem Report Form.  
 
B. Serious Adverse Reaction or Unexpected Event:  
If a Serious Adverse Reaction/Unexpected Event occurs (one that necessitates or prolongs 
hospitalization, results in a permanent or significant disability or congenital anomaly, or is judged 
to be serious by the principal investigator), and is unexpected , (not listed in the consent form) it 
must be reported to the IRB within five (5) business days of the PI becoming aware. If the Serious 
Adverse Event is  listed in the consent form but a relationship t o the study intervention/activity 
cannot be ruled out by the PI , it must be reported to the IRB within five (5) business days. If the 
information is incomplete on the initial filing, follow -up reporting is required. The IRB Unexpected 
Problem Report Form s hould be used in all reports pertaining to these reactions/events.  
 
C. Non -Serious (Moderate or Minor) Adverse Reaction or Unexpected Event:  
If a non- serious Adverse Reaction occurs that is unexpected (not listed in the informed consent), 
it must be repo rted to the IRB within five (5) business days of awareness, unless the Principal 
Investigator can rule out the relationship to the study agent or intervention. If a non -serious 
Adverse Reaction occurs that is expected (listed in the informed consent), but is more frequent, 
more intense or longer lasting that expected, or requires medical treatment, it must be reported to 
the IRB within five (5) business days. If the reaction that is listed in the consent form occurs as 
described in the informed consent, it does not need to be reported to the IRB.  
If an Unexpected Event occurs, it must be reported to the IRB within five (5) business days of the 
awareness by the Principal Investigator. The Adverse Reaction/ Unexpected Event Form should 
be used for these submi ssions.  
 
D. Possibly -Related Adverse Reactions/ Unexpected Events 
In the rare case where a sponsor requires that a non- reportable (i.e., possibly related) Adverse 
Reaction/ Unexpected Event be reported to the IRB, an amendment should be submitted by the 
PI requesting that the non- reportable safety report be appended to t he IRB file. It remains the 
primary responsibility of the WSU PI, the study sponsor, and any associated DSMC to identify 
trends that might require the event to be elevated to definitely or probably related status.  
If a trend is identified that elevates the Adverse Reaction to definitely or probably related status, an Unexpected Problem Report Form should be completed, along with an amendment for consent 
form changes, if needed, and submitted to the IRB.

 28 Safety Reporting Requirements for IND Holders 
In accordance with 21 CFR 212.32, sponsor -investigators of studies conducted under an IND must 
comply with following safety reporting requirements:  
 
a. Expedited IND Safety Reports:  
 
7 Calendar -Day Telephone or Fax Report:   
The Sponsor -Investigator is requir ed to notify the FDA of any fatal or life- threatening adverse 
event that is unexpected and assessed by the investigator to be possibly related to the use of 
investigational agent. An unexpected adverse event is one that is not already described in the 
Investigator Brochure.  Such reports are to be telephoned or faxed to the FDA within 7 calendar 
days of first learning of the event.  Each telephone call or fax transmission (see fax number 
below) should be directed to the FDA new drug review division in the C enter for Drug Evaluation 
and Research or in the product review division for the Center for Biologics Evaluation and 
Research, whichever is responsible for the review of the IND. All telephone conversations will be 
log as note to file in the IND BB -#13091.  
 
15 Calendar -Day Written Report:  
The Sponsor -Investigator is also required to notify the FDA and all participating 
investigators, in a written IND Safety Report, of any serious, unexpected AE that is considered 
possibly related to the use of the investig ational agent.  An unexpected adverse event is one that 
is not already described in the Investigator Brochure.  
Written IND Safety Reports should include an Analysis of Similar Events in accordance 
with regulation 21 CFR § 312.32.  All safety reports previously filed with the IND concerning 
similar events should be analyzed.  The new report should contain comments on the significance 
of the new event in light of the previous, similar reports.   
Written IND safety reports with Analysis of Similar Events are t o be submitted to the FDA, 
Genentech Drug Safety, and all participating investigators within 15 calendar days of first learning of the event.  The FDA prefers these reports on a MedWatch 3500a Form but alternative formats 
are acceptable (e.g. summary letter).

12.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
12.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
The objectives of this single arm phase II clinical trial are to evaluate the clinical efficacy and to confirm 
the safety  of anti-CD3 x anti -EGFR -Bispecific Antibody Armed Activated T -Cells (BATs) therapy for 
locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer who have received at least first line chemotherapy. The 
primary endpoint will test whether the treatment improves overall survival (OS) as compared to an 
historical standard. The secondary objectives include evaluating PFS af ter the last BATs infusion . Events 
that are considered progression events are detailed in section 9.  
 
12.2 Sample Size  
Previous studies indicated that the median survival of 2
nd line pancreatic cancer patients receiving 
chemotherapy is 7 months21,64. The hypothesis in this trial is that the BAT therapy as described in this 
protocol will increase the median overall survival to 10.5 months (a 50% increase). A sample size of 39 yields 0.80 power to detect an increase in median survival of 3.5 months assuming exponentially 
distributed death times, 48 months of accrual and 18 months minimum follow up with a one- sided Type I 
error of 0.05. We plan on enrolling 10% more patients, 43  total to ensure that we obtain 39 evaluable 
patients  (patients who complete all BAT infusions) at the conclusion of the tri al. The 3-6 six patients in the 
phase I portion, assuming no dose limiting toxicities, will be analyzed as part of the phase II.  No 
additional patients would be needed  (section 4.1 Treatment Plan) . 
 
12.3 Analysis 
 
Descriptive statistics (point and exact 90% confidence interval estimates from the resultant Kaplan -Meier 
curve) will be generated for the primary objective as well for the PFS endpoint in the secondary 
objectives. The median OS and PFS will be estimated on an intention- to-treat basis (using all registered 
patients), and on a response- evaluable basis (using all patients who completed all BAT infusions) using 
the Kaplan- Meier method. Toxicity rates will be estimated using all treated patients. Point and 90% 
Wilson’s confidence intervals will be estimated to describe binary endpoints including toxicity rate and response rates. Patients who did not have an event 18 months after the last pt was enrolled will be 
censored for the survival endpoints (date of last c ontact for OS and date of last evaluation for progression 
for PFS). Exploratory Cox regression analyses will be undertaken to determine if any of the clinical covariates measured at the beginning of the trial (e.g., age, race, group assignment) are associated with 
OS and/or PFS.  
 
12.4 Evaluation of toxicity  
All registered patients will be evaluated for toxicity probably related to the treatment. Toxicity data will be 
Protocol version: 06/ 22/2015, 05/27/2016  
 
 30 collected at least weekly during the course of treatment. Specific toxic outcomes are detai led in section 5 
of this protocol.  
 
12.5 Other toxic outcomes  
Data on other toxic side effects (excluding those detailed in section 5.0) that patients may experience will 
also be collected. We have chosen a safety threshold of 0.25 to monitor other toxic side effects. We 
would recommend reconsidering the phase II portion of the study for safety reasons if there were X many 
occurrences of grade 3 or higher toxicity (using the CTCAE guidelines) among the first N (or fewer) 
patients treated, as it would resul t in an upper confidence limit greater than 0.25:  
 
N X p UCL 
8 1 0.125  0.255  
13 2 0.154  0.256  
18 3 0.167  0.253  
22 4 0.181  0.261  
27 5 0.185  0.256  
32 6 0.188  0.252  
36 7 0.194  0.256  
41 8 0.195  0.252  
 
In the above table, N = the number of patients treated; X = the cumulative number of patients with a 
grade 3 or higher toxicity currently observed; p = the observed toxicity rate; and UCL = the exact 1- sided 
upper 80% confidence limit for p, using Wilson's  method without a continuity correction. After treating 41  
patients, the potential toxicity risk of this regimen should be well defined, and thereafter the possible need 
for termination of the study based on toxicity should be minimal.  
 
12.6 Expected accrual rate, accrual duration, and study duration  
Our anticipated accrual rate is 11 patients per year. Thus, it should take approximately 4 years to accrue 
the 43 patients needed for the trial. Allowing for 18 months of follow -up to obtain the primary endpoint on 
the last pt enrolled and 6  months to assemble, analyze and interpret the data the total study duration is 
projected to be at most 6 years.  
 
12.7 Secondary Objectives  
12.7.1: Immune Evaluations:  For the quantitative immune response variables measured in this 
objective,  we will produce summary statistics (including means, medians, and standard deviations) pre - 
and post -BATs treatment. Subsequent analyses will compare the immune response variables (after a 
suitable transformation, if necessary) pre - and post -treatment using a paired t -test (or Wilcoxon sign 
ranked test if the data are not approximately normally distributed).   To explore whether immune 
responses associate with clinical responses, the association between the baseline of each biomarker and 
clinical endpoints (such as response, or OS) will be analyzed using logistic regression for binary 
endpoints and Cox regression for time to event endpoints. Analyses will adjust for other covariates such 
as age and tumor stage.  No multiplicity adjustment is planned due to the nature of being exploratory. A 
two-sided p- value of < 0.05 will be considered significant. Power calculation : Given the anticipated 39 
pts enrolled on this trial. We have 80% power to detect a difference in paired mean of an immune 
response variable pre-  and post - treatment of 0.46 standard deviation units using a two- sided Type I error 
rate of 0.05. The minimum detectable effect size for the logistic and Cox regression analyses will be a 
function of the response and event rates. For example, assuming an event rate of 20%, we have 80% 
power to detect a hazard ratio of 2.7 with a two- sided Type error rate of 0.05.  
 
Protocol version: 06/ 22/2015, 05/27/2016  
 
 31 12.7.2 Paraffin Block Staining:  Each biomarker and computed biomarker (e.g., Th 1/Th 2) will be 
evaluated for normality and transformed (including non- parametric) if necessary to achieve normality. We 
will produce summary statistics (including means, medians, and standard deviations) for each variable 
and subsequently associate each variable with OS using Cox regression. In addition, a threshold for each variable associating with OS will be defined using classification and regression trees.
65 Power 
calculation:  Assuming an event rate of 20%, we have 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 2.7 with a 
two-sided Type error rate of 0.05 with 39 patients.  
 
 
13. HUMAN SUBJECTS  
 
13.1  Recruitment    
In address concerns related to decreased minority recruitment in local and national protocols, we 
will take specific steps to enhance the awareness in the Detroit Metro Region and the State of Michigan 
to recruit minority groups for these studies. The location of the KCI provides a unique opportunity to 
recruit African American s to the protocol. Our previous accrual record also indicated that we have been 
successful in recruitment to this pt population and with enrollment of African Americans.  
 
 
13.2  Informed Consent   
Patients will be enrolled only after informed consent is obt ained after a full explanation and 
discussion of all alternatives with the investigator/s in a consultation visit of approximately 1 hr with a follow up and reinforcement of the risks and benefits with the nurse coordinator. The Consent forms are 
signed in the presence of one of the investigators and/or the Immunotherapy Nurse Coordinator. No links 
to pt names will be presented. The patients are given consent forms after the consult and asked to write 
down any questions after reading the consent forms and t o bring the questions to the signing meeting.  
 
13.3  Data and  Safety and Monitoring Plan 
Pt safety will be monitored by the PI and protocol data manager(s) on a monthly basis. The safety 
of protocol participants will be reviewed and adherence to stopping  rules will be monitored. Adherence to 
the protocol, i.e., protocol violations, and data completeness and integrity will also be reviewed. Overall 
assessment of accrual, toxicities and responses will be done at this time to determine whether significant 
benefits or risks are occurring that would warrant study closure.  A monthly summary will be provided to 
the Karmanos Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee and will be reviewed quarterly. 
One month prior to anniversary date of the IRB original approval, a yearly summary report of trial 
activities will be made to all participating co- investigators and the Karmanos Cancer Institute Protocol 
Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC). This report will include the number of patients, the number of patients treated, a summary of all adverse events reported to date, a specific list of serious adverse 
events requiring immediate reporting and any significant developments that may affect the safety of the 
participants or ethics of the study.  
 13.3.1  Meetings   
Scheduled meetings will be held monthly on the activity of the protocol.  These meetings will 
include the protocol investigators, data managers, and key personnel involved with the conduct of the 
protocol.  
 
13.3.2  Evaluation   
During these meetings t he investigators will discuss matters related to:  
 
• Safety of protocol participants (Adverse Event reporting)  
• Validity and integrity of the data  
Protocol version: 06/ 22/2015, 05/27/2016  
 
 32 • Enrollment rate relative to expectation of target accrual, characteristics of the  
 participants  
• Retention of participants, adherence to the protocol (potential or real protocol violations)  
• Data completeness on case report forms and complete source documentation 
 
13.3.3  Completed Data and Safety Monitoring  
Reports of these regular investigator meetings will be kept on file in the office of the Clinical Trials 
Core. The data manager assigned to the clinical trial will be responsible for completing the report form.  The completed reports will be reviewed and signed off by the Principal Investigator ( PI) or by one of the 
Co-PI’s in the absence of the PI.  The signed off forms will then be forwarded to the Quality Manager, 
Clinical Trials Office for review of completeness and processing with the Karmanos Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Commi ttee. 
 
13.3.4  Data Safety Monitoring Committee  
The Barbara Ann KARMANOS Cancer Institute, Data and Safety Monitoring Committee will meet 
on a monthly basis to review the prior months Serious Adverse Event forms and Data and Safety 
Monitoring study specif ic reports that have been filed.  
 
13.3.5  Retention Of Records  
All documentation of adverse events, records of study drug receipt and dispensation, and all IRB 
correspondence will be retained for a minimum of 2 years after the investigation is completed.  
 
13.3.6 Protocol Activation   
This protocol will not be activated until the Karmanos Cancer Institute Protocol Review 
Committee, the Wayne State University IRB, and the US Food and Drug Administration have approved 
the initiation of this protocol.

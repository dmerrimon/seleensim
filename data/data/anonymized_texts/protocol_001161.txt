6 ABSTRACT   
Objective 
To better understand the  range of physical and emotional experiences and alterations in 
behavior that women have during pregnancy and after giving birth, the impact of these experiences on women’s lives, and the perinatal challenges encountered by special sub -
populations of women.   Study Population/Eligibility Criteria  
Pregnant women age 18 to 70 , all races and ethnicities . 
 Design  Type  
PregSource℠: Crowdsourcing to Understand Pregnancy  (PregSource℠) will use a longitudinal, 
crowd -sourcing, citizen science approach, asking pregna nt women regularly and directly about 
their pregnancies. Participants will enter information throughout gestation and the early 
infancy of their babies into online surveys and trackers via a website and/or mobile applications 
(“apps”). In exchange, participants will be able to track their pregnancy data over time, print out reports to share with their healthcare team, and view summaries of de -identified data to 
see how they compare to other women. In addition, PregSource℠ will provide participants with 
links to trusted, evidence -based information from partner organizations about pregnancy  
management,  issues, and complications.  
 Participants may also be a potential pool of recruits for clinical studies. Based on information they enter, eligible women who are interested in participating in clinical studies may be sent 
contact information about observational or interventional studie s. Their contact information 
will not be shared directly with researchers.  
 After a critical mass of data is  collected, de -identified data will be available to approved 
researchers for analysis.  
 Outcome  Measures  
PregSource℠ is an online  research registry  for collecting information about the natural history 
and range of normative experiences of pregnancy from the primary source: pregnant women. It, therefore, does not have specific outcome measures  beyond descriptive data on women ’s 
experiences and pregnanc y outcomes.  
 
7 SECTION 1.  STATEMENT OF PROBLEM  
In 20 09, the U .S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported an estimated 
6,369,000  pregnancies  – 102 pregnancies per 1,000 women – resulting in 4,131,000 live births 
and 1,087,000 fetal losses  (Curtin SC, et al  2013) . While many  of these women are seen by 
physicians, and hundreds of research studies are conducted, we know more about pregnancy 
complications , than about  the natural history of human pregnancy . There is limited to no 
information o n normal pregnancy despite its prevalence as the majority of studies are 
performed on specific conditions. Furthermore, even those tend to be case series and not 
representative of the population. In a review of clinicaltrials.gov there are no ongoing studi es 
characterizing normal pregnancy. Information collected in any systematic way from the 
patient’s point of view about how pregnancy affects the lives of women in our modern world is 
also missing, such as : 
 
• How many women get morning sickness? How long doe s it generally last? At w hat 
gestational ages does it tend to occur? Does it have any impact on  maternal weight?  
• How does being pregnant affect women’s sleep, energy levels, and mood ? How do 
these change over the course of the pregnancy?  
• What is the impact  of pregnancy and pregnancy symptoms on women’s  lives? How easy 
is it to stick to your doctor’s orders for diet, exercise, and special treatments?  
• How is being pregnant more challenging for certain women (e.g., women with physical and intellectual disabili ties)?  
 We believe that PregSource℠: Crowdsourcing to Understand Pregnancy  (PregSource℠) will help 
us gather information directly from pregnant women as they experience it, so that we can help 
answer some of these questions. A ccording to Project HealthDesign, “Lay people engage in 
health practices and health behaviors every  day, not just during visits to clinicians. They 
revealed that they attend not only to signs and symptoms of illness as directed by clinicians, but 
also to the idiosyncratic, highly perso nal thoughts, behaviors, attitudes, sensations, and 
environmental conditions that inform them about their health state and alert them to take action related to health. These observations of daily living (ODLs) complement traditional signs and symptoms of disease (e.g., blood pressure, shortness of breath) and highlight the personal experience of health and disease (Brennan 2010).”  
 PregSource℠ is an initiative run by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver  National Institute of Child Health 
and Human Development, to learn about women’s experiences  with pregnancy, to collect 
observations of daily living and  healthcare information about their pregnancies . It is an online 
research registry for collecting information about the natural history and range of normative experiences of pregnancy from the primary source: pregnant women. Its goal is to collect data that will help inform future studies on pregnancy and other health areas, which we discuss 
below in more d etail. It is neither designed nor intended to determine clinical effectiveness or 
cost-effectiveness of health care products and services, measure or monitor safety and harm, 
8 measure quality of care, or diagnose or treat any disease or condition. The purpo se of 
PregSource℠ is to inform future research –  not necessarily to perform empirical research –  by 
learning about : 
• Women’s physical and emotional experiences during pregnancy and after giving birth ; 
• How pregnancy  affects their lives ; and 
• Special challenges of some women, such as women with disabilities  or chronic health 
conditions . 
 
PregSource℠ can give us an overall picture of what women experience during pregnancy based 
on information from the women themselves.  
 
Crowdsourcing Methodology  
 To do this, PregSource℠ will harness the innovative power of crowdsourcing and citizen science  
(Swan M 2012)  by asking pregnant women to contribute their personal observations of daily 
living to our database. Promoted recently by the White House Office of Scienc e and Technology 
Policy (OSTP) , “Crowdsourcing is a process in which individuals or organizations request 
voluntary contributions from a large group of unknown individuals (“the crowd”) (The White 
House, Web log post, December 2, 2014) .” OSTP includes initi atives that incorporate and 
improve upon crowdsourcing as part of the Second Open Government Federal Action Plan. The Office also notes that “Citizen science and crowdsourcing are powerful tools that can help Federal agencies: a dvance and accelerate scient ific research through group discovery and co -
creation of knowledge; increase science literacy and provide students with skills needed to excel in science, technology, engineering, and math; improve delivery of government services with significantly lower r esource investments; and connect citizens to the missions of federal 
agencies by promoting a spirit of open government and volunteerism. ” PregSource℠  is 
designed to do all of the se. 
 PregSource℠ will use a longitudinal, crowd -sourcing, citizen science approach, asking pregnant 
women directly about their pregnancies. Participants will enter information throughout gestation and the early infancy of their babies into online surveys and trackers via a website and/or mobile applications (“apps”). This research registry will enable us to collect data and 
experiential trends on issues and topics for which no baseline data currently exist, and that can inform current and future research projects among pregnant women (Wang et al 2015) . 
Because of the Intern et-based design of the study, it may not enroll a nationally representative 
sample. But by surveying a broad cross -section of women about their experiences in near real -
time, data from PregSource℠ might confirm (or contradict) some of the information that 
currently exists about pregnancy topics such as nausea, weight gain, and sleep quality and duration. For instance, one of the key findings from the 2009 IOM pregnancy weight gain guidelines were  that “Currently available data sources are inadequate for stu dying national 
trends in GWG [gestational weight gain], or postpartum weight, or their determinants  (IOM 
2009) .” PregSource℠ can provide data on GWG trends and other baseline data that 
investigators can use to inform their observational studies and interve ntional trials on such 
topics and can potentially aid in recruitment.  
9  
By collecting information directly from the primary source (pregnant women), PregSource℠  
requires minimal infrastructure cost, while simultaneously maximizing delivery of evidence -
base d pregnancy information from experts.  
 Participants answer questionnaires about their experiences over the course of their pregnancy, recovery, and their baby’s development –  observations of daily living that are usually available 
only from periodic, time -constrained clinical visits. Women with certain pre -pregnancy 
conditions (e.g., physical disabilities) and those who develop pregnancy complications (e.g., gestational diabetes) will be asked additional questions about their pregnancy experiences, outcomes , and recovery. The anytime/anyplace access to participants improves data collection 
by recording events as they occur throughout pregnancy. This type of access to participants in research is unprecedented and not feasible in other types of research designs.  
 In addition to utilizing the power of the crowd, PregSource℠  aims to capitalize on the new 
trend of the “quantified self,” people aiming to improve their personal health by using technology to record their daily activities and biometrics. Many women n ow are currently 
tracking their menses, fertility, and other health data using apps, wearable devices such as FitBit and Apple Watch, and other websites  (Swan M 2009, Wolf G 2009, Appelboom G et al 
2014) . Given the 300+ pregnancy -related apps currently available, we believe that pregnant 
women are particularly interested in tracking their data. We also believe that they will be willing to donate their data for scientific research, if we: provide them with easy -to-use trackers 
and questionnaires, and incenti vize them to keep using them over the course of their 
pregnancy with educational materials, comparison summary data, and tools that capture what they are interested in tracking, in addition to data that are of empirical research value. Finding out how many  women are willing to do so, and best practices and lessons learned along the 
way, in and of itself, will provide meaningful information for future crowdsourcing research 
efforts in pregnancy and other health areas.  
 In exchange, participants will be able to track their pregnancy data over time, and print out 
reports to share with their healthcare team. They will also be able to view summaries of PregSource℠ data to see how they compare to other women – “Am I the only one that still has 
morning sickness at 6 months of pregnancy?”  In addition, PregSource℠  participants will receive 
relevant information about evidence -based medical guidelines and practices that are already 
published by government and non -government health care societies and organizations. 
Participants will be clearly told that if they have any concerns about their pregnancy or about 
what they learn in PregSource℠, they should discuss their concerns with their health care 
provider.  
 Participants may also be a potential pool of recruits for clinic al studies. Based on information 
they enter, eligible women interested in participating in clinical studies, would be sent contact information about observational or interventional studies . Their contact information will not be 
shared directly with researc hers.  
 
10 After a critical mass of data has been collected, de -identified data from PregSource℠  will be 
made  available to approved researchers for analysis.  De-identified data will be housed in the  
Research Data Patient Repository  (RDPR) . 
 
By gathering information  directly from pregnant women, research ers will have access to a large 
dataset  to better understand pregnancy from the participant’s point of view and potentially 
find ways to improve healthcare and wellness for all pregnant women.  
 
11 SECTION 2.  STUDY OBJECTIVES  AND OUTCOME MEASURES  
2.1. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  
To better understand the  range of physical and emotional experiences and alterations in 
behavior that women have during pregnancy and after giving birth, the impact  of these 
experiences on women’s lives, and the perinatal challenges encountered by special sub -
populations of women.  The protocol will be positioned to address numerous questions. 
Initially , it will focus on eight areas with the ability to expand to many other areas once 
the foundation is developed.  
 
2.2. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES  
To measure the impact that pregnancy symptoms and treatments have on women’s lives . 
Examples of the overarching questions and measures include:  
 
• Nausea and vomiting during  pregnancy – to identify how often this  affects pregnancy, 
its timing, treatments , and impact on weight  
• How often and at what gestational age do nausea and vomiting begin /improve ? 
• Impact on weight  
• Treatments  
• Physical disabilities and pregnancy – to identify how many pregnancies may be affected 
by physical disabilities  
• What disability ? 
• Impact on pregnancy  
• Impact of pregnancy on the condition  
• Weight gain in pregnancy – to identify weight gain patterns in pregnancy and compare 
to Institute of Medicine guidelines  
• Pre-pregnancy weight and height  
• Weight week ly or monthly  
• Plot weight gain on the appropriate IOM guideline  chart  
• Activity/ Exercise in pregnancy  – to identify exercise patterns in pregnancy including type 
and amount of exercise, impact on pregnancy  
• Evaluation of moderate and high impact activities across pregnancy  
• Sleep in pregnancy – to identify sleep patterns in pregnancy including number of hour s, 
sleep quality , and sleep position  
• Sleep pattern prior to pregnancy  
• Number of hours (on average) sleep per night  
• Quality of sleep  
• Prevalence of  sleep apnea  
• Sleep position  
• Mood in Pregnancy  – to identify general mood in pregnant women throughou t 
gestation. This will be done via a Mood Tracker and mood may be entered as often as necessary. We will use the validated Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) 
12 (Watson D and Clark LA 1994; Thompson ER 2007 ). This measure has also been used to 
access psychological stress among women with and without reproductive failure 
(Coughlan C  et al 2014). It may collect m ood descriptions  such as excited, irritable, 
angry, jittery , etc.  
• Medications  in pregnancy – to identify how many medications women are taking, 
reasons for their use, and how many are taken without clinician recommendation  
• Any medications used (weekly query) with triggers of those input in prior week to allow a continuation or stopping of that medication  
• Reason for the medication being use d 
• Did a medical provider recommend the medication or is it being used over the counter?  
• Alternative “medications ”/herbal supplement use in pregnancy –  to identify how many 
and what alternative medications/herbal supplements women are taking, reasons for 
their use, and how many are taken without clinician recommendation  
• Any herbal supplements or alternative medications used?  
• If yes, at what gestational age  and for how long ? 
• Reason for use  
• Number of ultrasounds in pregnancy –  to identify how many ultrasounds are being 
performed  in pregnancy, the  reasons,  and how many are performed  without clinician 
recommendation  
• Any ultrasounds during  pregnancy ? 
• Reason for the ultrasound 
 2.3. OUTCOME MEASURES 
PregSource℠ is a research registry  for gathering longitudinal, observational data from women 
during their pregnancies.  It, therefore, does not have specific outcome measures  beyond 
descriptive data on women’s experiences and pregnancy outcomes.  
It will provide  the following benefits : 
• Allow participants to compare their personal health situation to the summarized, de -
identified information from other participants, and links to evidence -based information 
sources  
• Provide de-identified data to approved researchers  for analysis  on etiology, natural 
history, and/or treatment effectiveness  on issues related to pregnancy  
• Identify pregnant women who may be eligible and interested in participating in clinical studies and trials  
 Below is a sample of outcome measures that PregSource℠ will collect and an alyze.  
 2.3.1.  Primary Outcome Measure s 
• Gestational age of delivery  
• Birthweight of baby  
• Maternal gestational weight  gain 
• Health of baby and mom  
13  
2.3.2.  Secondary Outcome Measures  
• Proportion  of pregnant women who experience nausea and vomiting in pregnancy 
across gestati on 
• Proportion  of pregnancies that are impacted by physical disabilities  
• Weight gain patterns in pregnancy with a comparison  to IOM guidelines  
• Exercise patterns in pregnancy including type and amount of exercise, impact on 
pregnancy  
• Sleep patterns in preg nancy including number of hours, sleep quality , and sleep position  
• How many medications women are taking, reasons for their use, and how many are taken without clinician recommendation  
• How many alternative medications /herbal supplements pregnant women are taking, 
reasons for their use, and how many are taken without clinician recommendation  
• Number of  ultrasounds in pregnancy  
 
In the future, additional measures may be added, such as assessments of maternal mental 
health, stress, chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes, and assessment of 
maternal diet and other environmental factors.  
14 SECTION 3.  STUDY POPULATION 
This will be a prospective cohort study, collecting information from women of child -bearing age 
who are pregnant. The study will include healthy volunteers, as well as those with pre -
conception medical conditi ons and/or pregnancy complications. Because it will be online, there 
is no limit to the number of participants who can join. It will be focused on  women in the 
United States, but because it will be online, women in other countries may also participate.  
 
3.1. INCLUSION CRITERIA  
• Women who are pregnant and over 18  and under 70 years of age . 
 
3.2. EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
• Males  
• Women who are not pregnant  
• Minors  under age 18  
• Women over the age of 70  
• Women who are unable to provide consent for themselves  
 
  
15 SECTION 4.  STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS  
4.1. STUDY OVERVIEW  
PregSource℠ is a participant opt-in resea rch registry . A pregnant woman can go online to the 
Website or download the app to join directly at a time of her choosing. PregSource℠  will not 
provide  medical advice, treatments , or evaluations, for either clinical or research purposes, and  
the participant will not be required to visit a doctor , complete any medical examinations , or 
provide biological samples  in order to participate.  
 
Registry questions cover  the time period from pre -conception through pregnancy and the post-
partum period  until 36 months, including neonatal outcomes . A participant  can remain in the 
study as long as she chooses. It is possible, but not required, that she  could remain in the study  
between pregnancies , enter ing information for multiple pregnancies.  
 PregSource℠ will be run on a web -based  platform under contract with Lockheed Martin 
Management Systems Designers, Inc.  and its affiliated subcontractor, Patient Crossroads , Inc.  
(collectively referred to  as “Contractor”) . The platform will capture participant information 
using condition -specific elements , as well as existing Common Data Elements  
(http://www.nlm.nih.gov/cde/ ). 
 4.2. RECRUITMENT  
4.2.1.  Recruitment Strategy 
We do not anticipate contacting potential participants  directly , and will not have access to 
medical records to identify women  for inclusion. Potential enrollees  may learn of the study  
from many sources , including : the NICHD Website, the PregSource ℠ Website (or downloading 
the PregSource℠  app), our partner organizations
1, a participant’s  doctor or midwife  (via 
professional organizations), or by word of mouth from friends , family members , and other 
participants . 
 
In addition, NICHD’s  Public Communic ations Branch will  draft posts about PregSource℠ for 
NICHD’s social media outlets ( https://www.facebook.com/nichdgov  and 
https://twitter.com/nichd_nih ). 
 
The Website  will provide information that explains the purpose of data collection, what 
participation involve s, risks and benefits, alternatives to participation, an explanation of how 
 
1 Partner organizations include: the American Academy of Pediatrics ; the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists ; the American College of Nurse- Midwives ; American Society for Reproductive Medicine ; Office of 
Research on Women’s Health ; , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ; Health Resources and Services 
Administration ; Lamaze International, Preeclampsia Foundation; Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses; Office of 
Behavioral and Social Sciences Research ; the March of Dimes; and the Society for Maternal -Fetal Medicine and 
several NIH institutes such as NCCIH, NHLBI, NIEHS, NINR and NIMHD.  
16 the data will be used, and contact information for any questions about the research or  their 
rights as a research subject.  
 
4.2.2.  Recruiting Non-English Speakers  
We will launch  the main PregSource℠ website and app  in Engli sh first. After that, the full 
website, main consent form, app,  and questionnaires  will be translated into additional 
languages, starting with Spanish.  
 
We anticipate launching a fully translated Spanish version of PregSource℠  within 12 months of 
the launc h of the English version. Creating a syntactically and culturally appropriate Spanish 
version means going beyond a straight word -for-word translation to also incorporate nuances 
in vocabulary, tone, idioms, and approach. The process is more akin to creatin g an entirely new 
website and application than to providing information in a different language because all 
PregSource℠ content will be affected: from questionnaires and consent documents to help 
information and system error messages to color schemes and i mages.  
 This effort will be led by the NICHD Office of Communications, which has successfully led several other similar projects including the creation of the Spanish version of DS- Connect®: The 
Down Syndrome Registry and the Spanish subsite of the main NI CHD website. The plan outlined 
below is based on the team’s experience with other similar projects.  
 
1. After English website and app are launched, identify, program, and get IRB approval for 
additional modifications as needed. (15 weeks)  
2. Outline trans lation requirements (i.e., setting freeze date for English content, identifying 
neutral Spanish words and phrases for use throughout, selecting a neutral Spanish editing style guide, listing staff roles and responsibilities, developing draft deliverable 
schedule, etc.). (2 weeks)  
3. Freezes English version of website and/the app, inventory English content, and pulls into spreadsheet with appropriate technical information. (3 weeks)  
4. Provides spreadsheet to American Translation Association -certified transl ator(s), who 
then translate the content. This activity comprises the bulk of the timeframe and includes some review and discussion with subject matter and other experts to ensure original intent of questions/content is maintained. (10 weeks)  
5. Translator( s) return translated content to programmers, who then build the new 
website and application in a development or production environment. (7 weeks)  
6. Once the site and/app are fully programmed, translators, technical experts, subject 
matter experts, securit y experts, and others review the content and function of the site 
and/app and make any necessary changes. Obtain IRB approval for revisions. (5 weeks)  
7. Beta testing begins with different users focused on different aspects of the site/app: 
some are review ing for content clarity, others for user experience, and others for overall 
function and security. All teams discuss suggested changes before they are incorporated. (4 weeks)  
8. Final translated content is sent to the IRB for review and approval. (3 weeks)  
17 9. Once approved, the site/app moves from development/production environment to live 
environment and technical and security experts verify technical and security functions. The English version content is unfrozen. (3 weeks)  
10. Maintenance and minor  revisions are ongoing as users work in and through the English 
and Spanish versions. Plans for any changes should include both English and Spanish versions. Analysis of functionality and use is also ongoing for both English and Spanish versions (currently  using Google Analytics, but specific tools may change over time).  
 
4.2.3.  Recruitment Advertising  
Recruitment and retention are critical to the success of a project like PregSource℠, and we 
intend to employ multiple strategies and tactics at different times throughout the project to achieve our target goals. The tactics may vary from creating radio and transit ads, to providing materials and information for intermediaries (in this case, care providers), to working with and through online and in -person communities, to utilizing sponsored referrals. The specific tactics 
used will depend on many factors, such as the signup rates, the survey completion rates, participant demographic coverage, and the geographic areas in which we will focus our initial efforts.  
 The NICHD will rely on its many Partners to help engage their constituents and encourage women to participate. For example:  
• The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , the Society for Maternal -Fetal 
Medicine, and the Association of Women’s Health, Obstetric, and Neonatal Nurses, have 
already agreed to recommend that their members promote PregSource℠  and will share 
NICHD -provided materials and information with their members to make this promotion 
easy and cost -effective.  
• The Health Resources and Services Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, and the March of Dimes have indicated that they will promote the 
website/app through their local chapter s and regional maternal and child health offices 
and departments.  
 We plan to create an array of items for multiple channels and types of media that we will share with all of our partners and will make them publically available to non -partners. These will 
include (but are not limited to): social media messages and graphics, slides that can be inserted into presentations, flyers that are easily reproducible, text that can be dropped into a newsletter or conference program, digital badges that women can incl ude in their social media 
profiles indicating that they are participating, posters for clinics and provider offices, emails 
that can easily be distributed over existing listservs and distribution lists, designs for displays 
that can be used at health fairs  or in birthing classes, posting information about the site/app in 
online resources such as clinicaltrials.gov and ResearchMatch, etc.  
 NICHD will also issue press release s via the NICHD and/or NIH Communications Offices. NICHD’s 
Website will also post a description of the research registry , along with a link to the main 
website , and include information in appropriate lists of similar registries and trials , such as the 
18 NIH List of Registries webpage ( http://www.nih.gov/health/clinicaltrials/registries.htm ). Similar 
registry descriptions may be available in electronic and/or printed handouts.  
 
In addition, according to the Pew Research Center , when Americans look for health information 
online , three -quarters of them begin  by using a search engine (Fox 2013) . If recruitment is slow, 
Google AdWords and other online mechanisms  may be used  to boost the online profile of 
PregSource℠ in such searches.  
 
Concurre nt to the culturally appropriate translation process, the NICHD will develop a 
promotion plan for the Spanish version of the site and app. The promotion plan will involve 
PregSource℠ partners and other organizations, such as the National Hispanic Medical 
Association (NHMA) and the National Hispanic Nurses Association (NHNA), as well as 
community groups, such as the Mary’s Centers for Maternal and Child Care, and other agencies, such as the HHS Office of Minority Health. Specific tactics for promoting the Spanish website’s availability include (but are not limited to): contributing information and visuals for NHMA, NHNA, and others to include in their newsletters, electronic updates, and other communications with their constituents for providers to share with their patients; creating 
online assets that NICHD and PregSource℠  partners can incorporate into their websites and 
social media accounts; sending out announcements and notices using outlets such as Hispanic PR Newswire; conducting some face -to-face outrea ch at Mary’s Centers and other community 
venues; and asking Gobiernousa.gov (the official web portal of the United States Government in Spanish) and other resource sites to include information about PregSource℠ on their sites. The 
messages and materials will be ready to share when the Spanish site/app are launched.  
 If during data monitoring (see Section 7.2.4, Monitoring Recruitment and Sample Population), PregSource℠ identifies under -represented groups, we will develop and implement similar 
targeted recruitment and outreach efforts to enroll participants  in these groups . 
 4.2.4.  Anticipated Accrual Rate 
There is no limit on the number of participants in PregSource℠. At this time it is difficult to 
estimate accurately how many women may choose to register, how many will enter  – and 
continue to enter  – data  throughout their pregnancy , and what the accrual rate is likely to be . 
The immediate goal is to accrue  10,000 participants within 2 years  of launch . 
 4.2.5.  Recruitment Replacement Strategy  
If a participant decides to withdraw her information from the database , no specific effort will 
be made to replace that individual.  
 4.3. SCREENING  
A potential participant will self -register online via the Website or app without providing proof 
of eligibility (e.g., a medical diagnosis). The Website will provide general information about the registry on a  Frequently Asked Questions  webpage . 
 Participa nts must complete the online consent form before they can enter data.  
19  
4.4. STUDY PROCEDURES 
4.4.1.  Consent Documents and Process  
Who o btains consent . Informed consent will be collected electronically via the Internet ; study 
staff will not obtain verbal or in -person i nformed consent. Each subject will read, complete , and 
submit an online consent form herself .  
 Consent procedure . To join the study , a participant  will need to:  
 
1. Create an account by going online to the PregSource℠ Website , 
https://PregSource.nih.gov
. The Website  can be accessed  via computer or the  app. Apps 
will be available for  download ing in both iPhone and Android versions. The participant 
will need to choose  a unique user name and a password.  
 2. Review and complete the online consent form.  
 Consent documents . A Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)  document will be available on the 
Website to help address questions participants may have, such as: what is  the purpose of the 
study, what does participation involve, what are the known risks and benefits of participation, 
how will the data be used, and contact information for further questions . A copy of the 
electronically signed consent responses will be saved in each participant’s Profile for future 
reference. The PregSource℠ Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions will also be available on 
the Website. In addition, Coordinators will be available via email (posted on the “Contact Us” webpage ) during regul ar business hours to answer questions . 
 Consent to re -contact for follow -up. After completing the consent and registration process, a 
participant will be asked , as part of completing her  account profile , whether she is  willing to be 
contacted by PregSource℠ staff about studies and clinical trials she may be eligible to 
participate in . The original consent will be part of her  account profile, and she will be able to 
change her Contact and Sharing  Preferences  at any time.  
 4.4.2.  Account Profile Set up and Health History Questionnaire  
Once registered and consented, a participant  can begin to enter information after  reading the 
PregSource℠ Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions of use, then completing her Account 
Profile and taking an initial Health History q uestionnaire  to collect  data on: 
• Contact information and preferences (email, text, etc.) , including an optional alternate 
contact
2 
• Demographic s and socioecono mics  -- NIH-required race/ethnicity data, general family 
income ranges, education levels  
 
2 Alternate Contacts will be contacted only in cases when repeated attempts to gather final pregnancy outcome 
information have been unsuccessful.  
20 • Interest in participating in a clinical trial. The p articipant  will be asked for her consent  to 
allow the PregSource℠ coordinators  to contact her regarding future opportunities for 
participation in a clinical trial or research study.  
• Pre-pregnancy general health – height, weight, a checklist for chronic conditions (e.g., 
diabetes, lupus), medications  
• Reproductive health – contraceptive use, pre vious pregnancy histories, infertility, use of 
assisted reproductive technologies  
• Current pregnancy health –  gestational age, number of fetuses, date of first prenatal 
visit, prenatal visits completed, any diagnoses received or test results . 
 
A participant  will access PregSource℠ questionnaires online  and/or via a mobile app to enter 
her own data.  She will be able to download apps (e.g., via the iTunes or Android online app 
stores) to a smartphone or tablet, and connect these to her online account.3 The apps, as well 
as the Website, will let her access and enter data into online surveys and trackers. A participant will also be sent reminders and push notifications, asking her to update her information.  
 All questionnaires will be constructed using “S mart Survey Design” –  i.e., using conditional or 
skip logic to add or skip questions that are not relevant, based on previous answers. Aggregated 
data will help us analyze response frequencies for survey questions.  
 
4.4.2.1.  Trackers  
Each participant can enter data  in a set of health “trackers” –  online or in -app software diaries 
that capture daily or weekly information over the course of pregnancy about her weight, 
nausea symptoms, mood, and sleep. Additional trackers may be added at a later date for tracking nutri tion, exercise, and pain. She can enter data in the trackers as often as she 
chooses. We anticipate that for trackers such as nausea, sleep, and mood, a participant might enter data on a daily basis; while weight data might be entered only once a week or e ven once 
a month. Most trackers will collect data on timing, duration, severity/intensity, and related issues. A 2013 report by Citrix
4, a software company that tracks app usage, shows pregnancy 
related apps to have wider usage. Many of the available  trackers have been used and/or 
validated in the pregnant population5.  Recent research articles6 have demonstrated the  use of 
web -based methods to collect relevant health related information from pregnant women.  
 
Unless otherwise indicated in her Account Profile, a participant will be reminded on a weekly 
basis to update her information, if she has not entered new data within the past two weeks . 
 
3 Participants will not be required to use the apps. The apps will be available as a potentially more readily available 
means of accessing the questionnaires and trackers.

21  
We anticipate including the following trackers:  
 Weight tracker . Weig ht would likely be entered  weekly /monthly. Data collected include s: 
• Weight (in pounds or kilograms)
7 
 Nausea tracker . The Nausea Tracker could be entered as often as necessary , collect ing data on:  
• Date  
• Timing (morning, afternoon, all day)  
• Duration  
• Severit y (just nauseous, vomited)  
 Sleep  tracker . In addition to asking about a participant’s s leep pattern s and apnea diagnosis  
prior to pregnancy  in the initial health questionnaire, the Sleep Tracker may  collect data on:  
• Number of hours of sleep each  night  
• Quality of sleep (slept soundly, tossed and turned, etc.)  
• Sleep position (back, stomach, right side, left side)  
 Activity  tracker . Activity could be entered as often as necessary. It may  collect data on:  
• Intensity  of physical activity  
• Duration of ph ysical activity  
 Mood  tracker . The Mood Tracker could be entered as often as necessary. We will use the 
validated Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)  (Watson D and Clark LA 1994; 
Thompson ER 2007) . This measure has also been used to access psychological stress among 
women with and without reproductive failure  (Coughlan C  et al 2014) . It may  collect:  
• Mood description  
As per Section 7.1.1.1 Safety: “If a participant enters data indicating a health or safety concern, 
the database will send an automated notice to her that she may want to contact her doctor for 
advice. The database may also refer her to related factsheets and websites with further information.” In PregSource℠, after a participant enters data for the PANAS, the platform will calculate raw scores for both positive affect ( PA) and negative affect ( NA). Crawford (2010) 
reported norms for the PA and NA scores on  the PANAS instrument.  Because the data were not 
normally distributed, they converted the data into percentiles. The Crawford nomogram will be used to convert raw scores into percentiles. Participants who score >95th percentile for NA and/or <5th percenti le for PA will be considered to have affect that deserves further attention 
by a clinician. Participants with scores in these ranges will receive a notification stating that their mood may indicate a problem that they may want to discuss with their care provider.  
Participants will also receive a follow -up message 2 weeks after the initial notification 
 
7 Height data would be collected in the Initial Health Questionnaire, so that BMI can be calculated. We would ask in 
the Gestational Age monthly questionnaires if there was any change in height (not likely for adults, but may 
change for teenagers).  
22 reminding them that their mood tracker indicated a concern that may warrant discussion with 
their health care provider.  
 Medications in pregnancy  tracker . The Medications T racker may ask if the women have:  
• Taken a ny medications for specific conditions  
• When they stopped taking th e medication  
• Reason for the medication being used  
 
Alternative therapies tracker . The Alternative Therapies Tracker may ask women if they are 
taking any alternative medications  or herbal supplements, reasons for their use, and how many 
are taken without clinician recommendation : 
• Any herbal supplements or alternative medications used?  
• If yes, which therapies ? 
• Reason for use  
 
4.4.2.2.  Gestational Age Questionnaires  
Once a month, PregSource℠ will send each participant a n email, text,  or app push notification, 
with a link to a new questionnaire  relevant to her current week of gestation. For example, at 25 
weeks of gestation, we may ask whether she has felt her baby move yet. At the end of each 
questionnaire, if the participant has not entered data into the health trackers in the past month, she will be taken to the appropriate trackers to enter information. This process will allow PregSource℠ to reduce duplication of questions, and capture changes over time in a 
consistent manner (e.g., all weight data will be entered into the Weight tracker).  
 If a participant does not complete  her monthly questionnaire, she will receive a reminder once 
a week to do so via email or text to review the information she has entered into the database 
and provide any appropriate updates to her  information.  
 Gestational- age questionnaires will continue monthly through pregnancy and then quarterly up 
to 36-mon ths post -partum  to capture information on maternal recovery and neonatal and 
infant outcomes  and development.  
 
4.4.2.3.  Sub-group Q uestionnaires  
Based on answers to  previous questions , a participant  with a special condition  or complication  
may be asked to complete additional questionnaires. Such questionnaires will collect more 
detailed information about her  health history , current pregnancy status, and special challenges 
and issues . Sub-groups may include women with : 
• Disabilities  (physical or intellectual)  
• Obesity  
• Lupus or other autoimmune diseases  
• Diabetes or gestational diabetes  
 Sub-group questionnaires will be submitted to the IRB for approval prior to being launched.  
23  
4.4.2.4.  Future Modules  
PregSource℠ is intended to evolve over time  with the  investigators  reviewing, revising, and 
adding questions , questionnaires,  and interactions based on new topic areas and feedback 
received as well as results collected.  
 
For example, we envision a future module on mental health issues in pregnant and post -partum 
women. Such a component needs to be carefully planned and implemented to be sensitive to 
participants’ perceptions and to provide meaningful sources of intervention, as needed, for 
participants whose answers indicate they may be in need of immediate clinical assistance. We would first analyze the results obtained from the Mood Tracker to see how many women require notifications about negative affect. We would , then,  consult with experts on post-
partum depression and other relevant mental health issues to develop questionnaires and follow -up procedures. As part of that plan, we  anticipate conduct ing beta -testing of any new 
questionnaire s and the follow- up procedures that assure  participant safety.   
 We will submit plans for any future modules  to the IRB for review  prior to beta testing and 
module implementation.  
  
4.4.3.  End of Participation  
Unless she withdraws from the study , a participant  ends her participation in the study when her 
pregnancy ends due to termination, miscarriage, or stillbirth , or at 36-months  post -partum. She 
may , however,  choose to continue entering data through subsequent pregnancies.  
 4.4.4.  Follow -up 
A participant will not be required to undergo any follow- up medical examinations or doctor’s 
visits. To prompt her to enter information throughout her pregnancy, including pregnancy and 
newborn outcomes, PregSource℠ will send each participant  regular email, text, and /or app 
push notification reminders, asking her  to update  her information.  
 4.4.5.  Other C linical Trials and Studies  
No participant will be required to take part in any other research protocol(s), and may continue 
to participate in PregSource℠ whether she does or does not participate in any other 
protocol(s).  
 As part of her account profile, each participant  will indicate whether she would like to be 
contacted to participate in other clinical trials and studies. She will be able to change her  
Contact and S haring Preference s at any time in her online Account Profile.  
 Research investigators for other clinical studies and trials can submit an IRB -approved protocol 
request to the PregSource℠ Coordinator to recruit participants for their studies. The Operations 
Committee  or its designees  will review each proposal. If approved, the Database Administrator 
will develop an automated search for each protocol to regularly search the data of each registered and interested participant and compare it to the e ligibility criteria for the protocol. 
24 Positive search results will be sent to the Coordinators, who will verify the eligibility and send 
each interested  and eligible participant information on how to contact the protocol 
investigator, if she chooses  to do so . 
 Researchers and physicians will not have access to personally identifiable information (PII) for 
any participants, nor will they be able to contact participants directly. Studies external to the registry would consent participants separately, based on each study’s IRB requirements.  
 
4.4.6.  Beta Testing  
PregSource℠ will not implement a pilot project. Prior to launching the main PregSource℠ 
website, app, questionnaires, and trackers, however, we will conduct beta -testing of the 
website and a pp, in which beta testers  will enter data into PregSource℠ and, in addition, 
answer questions about the surveys and trackers, their usability , and the process and flow of 
the tool . We anticipate at least 30 beta testers identified from our Partner organiza tions will 
participate.  
 
At the request of the IRB, during the beta test, and a fter obtaining appropriate informed 
consent, all pregnant or recently pregnant  beta -testers (N= 10-20) will be asked to  provide us 
with a copy of their antepartum medical records , so that we can compare their data responses 
in PregSource℠  to key variables in their medical record for verification. V ariables for validation 
may  include : 
• Age 
• Current p regnancy status  
• Pre-pregnancy weight  
• Pregnancy weight gain  (for women who have delivered)  
• Number of previous pregnancies  
• History of diabetes  
• History of  chronic hypertension  
• History  of prior  preterm pregnancies  
• Estimated due date for the current pregnancy  
 These variables are chosen because of their general importance to obstetric care and outcomes and because they are very likely to be recorded in an obstetric medical record. Because many of our beta testers will be pregnant at the time of the test, to validate items from all of them we 
will need to limit most of  the variables to those available early in gestation –  excluding outcome 
variables or variables such as diagnosis of gestational diabetes that are identified at later gestational ages.  For those  who have delivered, we will also evaluate pregnancy weight gain, an 
objective measure that can be validated using medical records.  
 In consultation with biostatisticians in the NICHD Division of Intramural Population Health Research (DIPHR), w e will calculate kappa (ĸ) statistics to quantify agreement between the 
baseline questionnaire data and the obstetric record. A ĸ >= 0.61 will be considered substantial 
to excellent agreement  (Landis JR and Koch GG 1977) .  
25 SECTION 5.  STORAGE OF DATA AND SAMPLES  
5.1. REGIS TRY DATA STORAGE  
Under a contract with Lockheed Martin, PregSource℠ will use a web -based, patient opt- in 
registration system developed by PatientCrossroads, Inc., San Mateo, California, for DS -
Connect ® and other registries. PatientCrossroads will track par ticipant enrollment, capture 
data, and deliver appropriate summary information based on entered data via a secure web 
portal, using MySQL Server as the back end relational database.  
 Lockheed Martin will work with PatientCrossroads to ensure that the syste m is compliant with 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) and with the Federal 
Information Security Management Act of 2002 ("F ISMA", 44 U.S.C. §3541 ). Security features 
target multiple levels , including the data element (e .g., restricted access to fields), user (e.g., 
password authentication access), application (e.g., role -based access to features, access audit 
trails), and hosting services (e.g., firewall, secure sockets layer). T hese features ensure access 
and audit control, data integrity, user authentication, and transmission security.  
 All server requests are transmitted over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). All servers have multiple layers of data and access protection: (1) A dedicated, managed Cisco router firewall, (2) A redundant array of independent disk (RAID) Level 5 is used to ensure that data will not be lost if a hard drive fails between backups, (3) A system level backup is performed nightly, retained for 2 weeks, and stored in the data center, (4) a database level backup is performed nightly, retained for 2 months, and stored at the data center.  
 5.2. DATA SHARING  
Researchers may request data from the registry to analyze it for research purposes, such as to 
determine the prevalence of clinical manifestations and/or estimate numbers of participants who may be eligible for approved clinical studies or trials. The Operations Committee  or its 
designees  will review these  requests. If approved, researchers may be given access to de -
identified data only via the Website’s Profe ssional Portal which will be launched in the future . 
 5.3. DATA DISP OSITION  
On a regular schedule (not less often than once every 5 years) and when the registry stops accepting new participants and new data from existing participants , PregSource℠ will submit 
de-identified data to a NICHD d ata repository such as DASH ( Data and Specimen Hub) for future 
researchers to access and analyze.  
 Once a participant has  completed  the registration and consent process , she will be able to view 
summaries of the de -identified data  from all participants . This access will allow her  to see how 
she compare s with other similar participants.  
 
26 5.4. REGISTRY  SAMPLES STORAGE AND DISPOSITION  
PregSource℠ does not plan on c ollecting biological samples at this time.  
 
5.5. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS  
5.5.1.  Research with I nvestigational Drugs or Devices  
PregSource℠ will not be conducting research with any investigational drugs or devices.  
 5.5.2.  Gene T herapy  
PregSource℠ will not be using any  gene therapy.  
 
27 SECTION 6.  POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
6.1. KNOWN AND ANTIC IPATED RISKS A ND DISCOMFORTS 
There are no known or anticipated physical, psychological, social, legal, or economic risks from  
taking part in this study . 
 
Psychologically, if a participant is  not comfortable answering or do es not want to answer a 
question  in the study , she does not have to answer it. When l ooking at summaries of de-
identified data  and comparing it to her own situation , it is possibl e that a participant  may learn 
information that is upsetting  to her . 
 One potential risk is a loss of private or confidential information, such as from a security breach. In the event of a breach, we will let participants know about it as soon as possible.  
 6.2. STEPS TAKEN TO MINIMIZE RISK  
6.2.1.  Data S ecurity  
While we cannot guarantee security for information stored on each participant’s computer or mobile device(s), or while it is being t ransmitted via cell phone towers, Wi -Fi, or the Internet, 
once received, our database has  a FISMA -moderate level of security, including  multiple security 
safeguards and protec tions . To minimize the risk of a security breach, we will:  
• Use up -to-date, compliant, and proven database and security software and data 
transmission protections (See Section 5.1 for details)  
• Monitor the Website and database system continually  
• Maintain up dated anti -viral protections  
• Conduct regular evaluations of the database and security features by an independent, 
outside security expert  
• Maintain multiple levels of restricted access for user access (e.g., a password is needed 
to enter), application access (e.g., role -based access to features, access audit trails), and 
hosting services (e.g., firewall, secure sockets layer)  
• Store direct participant identifiers (i.e., subject names and other personally identifiable 
information) in tables separate from medical information  
• Limit access to participant identifier tables to the Coordinators only  
• Anonymize any shared data following current HIPAA standards  
 
These safety features help ensure that participant  information is protected. In the event of a 
breach, we will notify participants about it as soon as possible.  
 6.2.2.  Cont acting S ubjects about O ther Clinical Studies  
As mentioned  in Section 4.4. 5, approved researchers  will not have access to personally  
identifiable information for any participants that would allow them to contact participants 
directly. Once approved, p otentially  eligible and interested participants would be sent the 
28 contact information for the researchers  by the Coordinators; it would be each participant’s 
choice whether to contact those  investigators.  
 
Studies external to PregSource℠  would consent participants separately, based on each study’s 
IRB requirements.  
 6.2.3.  Sharing De-identified Data with Other Resea rchers  and/or Data Repositories  
Researchers may request de-identified data from the study to analyze for research purposes , 
such as to estimate  the prevalence of clinical manifestations or numbers of participants who 
may be eligible for approved  clinical studies or trials. The Operations Committee  or its 
designees  will review these  requests. If approved, researchers may be given access to the data 
via the Website’s Professional Portal and/or sen t a file of the de -identified data . 
 De-identified data may als o be deposited in data repositories, such as the  DASH . 
 6.3. CLASSIFICATION OF RISK  
Per 45 CFR 46 , PregSource℠ falls under Subpart B, Additional Protections for Pregnant Women, 
Human Fetuses , and Neonates Involved in Research .  
 For adults, including those  without consent capacity, PregSource℠  will involve only minimal 
risk. 
 
For infant s/children, PregSource℠ falls under 45 CFR 46.404, “Research that does not involve 
greate r than minimal risk to children,” as  we will be collecting  developmental data on the 
infants born to the mothers and reported by them . 
 
Overall, given the known and anticipated risks and discomforts, PregSource℠ will not involve 
more than minimal risk to any participant, and we believe the risks are reasonable in  relation to 
anticipated benefits.  
 6.4. ANTICIPATED BENEFIT S 
6.4.1.  Direct Benefits  
A participant  will not benefit directly from participating in  PregSource℠.  
 6.4.2.  Indirect Benefits  
Because PregSource℠  provides a means  for each participant  to track her personal health 
information, and it may suggest that she  contact her healthcare team based on her answers to 
particular questions, it may help her  better inform her  healthcare team about her health. For 
example, if a woman indicates that she is gaining weight beyond recommended levels , the 
database may send her  a message telling her that she may want to discuss this with her 
prenatal care provider. Both the  tracking capabilities and the prompts  may he lp her healthcare 
team better monitor and address her  healthcare needs.  
 
29 Each participant  will also get evidence -based information about pregnancy. For example, if a 
woman indicates  that she has morning sickness, she will be able to see how many other wome n 
in the database also have this symptom . She will also get links to information  and websites 
about morning sickness from PregSource℠  partner organizations and other trusted sources.  
 
Finally, being able to see how she compares to others similar to her may  give a participant 
some peace of mind about her concerns (i.e., “I’m not the only one”) and/or prompt her to 
contact her healthcare team for issues that are of concern (i.e., “This doesn’t seem normal –  I 
should see my doctor”).  
 
30 SECTION 7.  SUBJECT SAFETY MONITORING 
7.1. STUDY  MONITORING PLAN  
 
7.1.1.  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan and Stopping Rules  
7.1.1.1.  Safety  
Because we do not anticipate any health risks to participants for taking part in PregSource℠, we 
will not have a Data  and Safety Monitoring Committee. The lead principal investigator, in 
conjunction with the Management Team,  will monitor study data and safety.   
 PregSource℠, its Website , and app c ontent  are not intended to be a substitute for 
independent, professional medica l judgment, advice, diagnosis, or treatment.  Participants 
should always seek the advice of their  physician s or other qualified health provider s with any 
questions or concerns they  may have regarding their health, their  pregnancy, or their baby’s 
health.  
 If a participant reports a health - or safety -related conce rn, the  Coordinator  will report it to the 
lead principal investigator and the Management Team for review.  
 If a participant enters data indicating a health or safety concern, the database will send a n 
automated notice to her that she may want to contact her doctor for advice. The database may also refer her to related factsheets and websites with further information.  
 
7.1.1.2.  Futility  and Stopping Rules  
The Operations Committee will review study recruitment numbers and study  data completion 
rates annually. If recruitment targets and/or study questionnaire completion rates are not within the expected target, the Committee may recommend options to the  Director of NICHD 
to alter the design, halt , or terminate the study . 
 
If a particular study question or questionnaire is  being completed by less than 67% of relevant 
participants, the Committee  will review it and may recommend revision s and/or deletions. 
 
7.1.2.  Procedures for Suspending or Stopping Enroll ment  
PregSource℠ will suspend registration and data entry if there is a security breach that 
compromise s the ability to collect information in a secure, confidential manner. Participants 
will be notified in a timely manner about the breach. Registration/da ta entry will be restarted 
only if/when the Management Team, including the independent security experts, are confident that the system is secure, and the IRB has approved continuation.  
 If the study end is planned for a set future date  (e.g., at the end of the contract) , new 
participants will be warned of the end date before they join, so that they may make an 
informed decision about whether to enroll.  
31  
When PregSource℠  ends, current participants will be notified of the end date and given a 
reasonable opportunity (e.g., 3 months) to download and/or print their own data before the Website and database are shut down.  
 7.2. QUALITY ASSURANCE  
7.2.1.  Data Curation  
PregSource℠ Coordinators will be trained in curation methods to review and investigate 
participant responses, re ports, or registration details that are inconsistent with each other 
and/or the expected clinical course or status of the participant. Coordinators will follow up with 
the participant, as needed, to correct and/ or explain  the inconsistencies.  
 7.2.2.  Monitoring the Participant Registration Process  
PregSource℠’s curation and quality monitoring program will assess the appropriateness of the 
participant through a review of contact, demographic , and consent details. If the participant 
appears valid, the PregSource℠ Coordinators  may review a selection of Health History 
questionnaire  responses. Accounts are assessed and assigned a status with regard to the 
completeness and reliability of the partic ipant -provided information . Monitoring is ongoing as 
the participant contributes future information.  
 7.2.3.  Monitoring Participant Burden  
PregSource℠ will implement a curation and quality monitoring program to monitor participant 
burden of use and adherence/attr ition over time. This will include monitoring:  
• Number of participants who complete monthly questionnaires  
• Number of participants who complete weekly trackers at least once per week  
• Number of participants who have turned off/adjusted reminder frequencies in their 
Profiles  
• Number of participants who dropout (do not enter data for more than 3 months) and/or withdraw from the study, the timing in their pregnancy of dropout/withdrawal, and their demographic characteristics  
• Number of participants co ntinuing to enter data through the end of their pregnancy  
• Number of participants continuing to enter data for neonatal outcomes  
• If participants enroll at earlier gestational ages, are they more or less likely to continue 
entering data throughout their preg nancy?  
• Are participants more likely to enter certain types of data than others (morning sickness, 
sleep, mood)?  
 The database will also use  statistical tracking and Google Analytics to report  on participants’:  
• Date of registration  
• Date of last login  
• Date o f last update (demographics and complete audit of questionnaire responses)  
• Registrants by country  
• Registrants by date  
32 • Website visitors by date  
• Website visitors by country  
• Most frequently accessed content  
• Average length of time spent on the site  
• Number of app downloads  
 
For example, the system can report on completion of health history questionnaires similar to the pie chart or bar chart below. Additional sample reports can be viewed at http://www.nltechno.com/awstats/awstats.pl?config=destailleur.fr
. 
 
 
   
 
 
We will also be monitoring site/app usage statistics and analyzing user behaviors so we can refine questions and site/app function as PregSource℠ continues. For instance, if the majority 
of users drop out of the pre -conception survey before completing it, we can break up the 
survey into segments to make it easier for people to complete . 
 7.2.4.  Monitoring Recruitment and Demographic Distribution  
PregSource℠ coordinators will monitor recruitment every quarter – and more often if 
necessary – paying particular attention to the demographics (race, ethnicity, income) of 
U.S. participants in the study population. If minority enrollment is more than ~ 10% 
below the demographics of the U.S. population, based on the most recent U.S. Census for which data are publicly available, the Operations Committee will initiate additional 
recruitment efforts to enroll participants from under -represented sub -groups.  
 

33 7.2.5.  Lost to F ollow-up 
Because the pregnant woman  will be the person entering data, and given the possibility of 
maternal death s, we will give the participant the option of providing  the name and email 
address  for an alternate contact (e.g., a family member or friend). If t he participant has not 
entered final maternal and neonatal outcome data after repeated reminders, at 6  months after 
her expected due date, the Coordinator s will email the alternate contact to try to gather  this 
information  if permission is granted under Co ntact and Sharing Preferences . 
 
7.3. REPORTING OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS, ADVERSE EVENTS AND PROTOCOL 
DEVIATIONS  
There is a small risk that confidential information may be lost , or there may be a breach in the 
computer database storing personally identifiable i nformation (PII).  
 The Lead Principal Investigator is responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting unanticipated problems, adverse events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs), and protocol deviations in accordance with NIH policy, IRB re quirements, and federal regulations. 
Relatedness to the research of all serious adverse events will be determined by the PI.  
 Serious unanticipated problems and serious protocol deviations will be reported to the IRB as soon as possible and in writing not more than 7 days after the  PI first learns of the event. 
Adverse events that are deemed not to be serious will be reported to the IRB as soon as possible and in writing not more than 14 days after the PI first learns of the event.  
 All adverse events, deviations, and unanticipated problems will be summarized and reported at the time of Continuing Review.  
 7.4. CRITERIA FOR INDIVIDUAL SUBJECT WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY  
A participant may be removed from the study at any time if the Management Team believes that it is not in the participant’s best interest to continue, or if the participant is unable to comply with the requirements or Terms and Conditions . 
 Participation is entirely voluntary. If a participant changes her mind and wishes to withdraw her information from the study, she is free to do so without having to provide any explanation and without loss of benefits or privileges to which she is otherwise entitled. If a participant no longer wants to take part, she can change her profile preferences so that she  stops receiving 
reminders. If she wants to withdraw her data from the database, she can contact the 
Coordinators to start that process; however, data that has already been de -identified and 
provided to outside researchers and/or data repositori es before the request was received and 
processed cannot be retrieved.  
  
34 SECTION 8.  STATISTICAL ANALY SIS PLAN 
8.1. ANALYSIS OF DATA/ STUDY OUTCOMES  
PregSource℠ will be a research registry  for investigators to use. As such, we do not have any 
pre-planned statistical analysis. Power calculations would vary depending on the proposals 
investigators submit for approval.  
 
8.2. SAMPLE SIZE , POWER ANALYSIS, AND AVAILABLE POPULATION  
Given PregSource℠ ’s online, self -consenting process, t here is no set limit to the number of 
participants  who can enroll, and it is difficult to estimate accurately how many women will find 
the study, choose to enroll, and enter their data consistently.  
 For 20 09 (the latest y ear for which data is currently available), the CDC reported an estimated 
6,369,000  pregnancies, resulting in 4,131,000 live births  (Curtin  2013) . According to the Pew 
Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project , in 2012, 72% of U.S. adults in the s urvey 
said that they had  gone online in the past year to look up health information; and women were 
more likely than men to  look up information about specific medical conditions for themselves 
or someone else  (Fox 2013) . 
 Conservatively, with falling birth rates reported (Curtin 2013), if only 1% of these pregnant women locate the study and 50% choose to join, the study could enroll more than 30,000 
women per year. This could lead to an anticipated enrollment of 120,000 women over 4 years.  
 For recruitment purposes, if a participant drops out or withdraws her information, no specific 
effort will be made to replace her.  
 8.3. PROJECT ED R ECRUITMENT TIME 
The current contract with Lockheed Martin covering PregSource℠  is for 3 years from 
September 30, 2014 – September 29, 2017. NICHD is committed to continuing PregSource℠ 
even after the current 3-year contract period either by extending t he contract or using another 
solicitation as needed.  
   
35 SECTION 9.  HUMAN SUBJECT S PROTECTION  
9.1. SUBJECT SELECTION  
9.1.1.  Statement of E quitability  
The racial and ethnic characteristics of PregSource℠ participants will reflect the demographics 
of the individuals who are seeking information regarding pregnancy and interested in 
participating in clinical trials or research studies.  With appropriate consent, n o individuals who 
meet the inclusion criteria will be excluded from participation based on race or ethnicity (see 
exclusion criteria). Given the nature of pregnancy, men will not be included in sample collection .  
 Justification for inclusion of children  
Not applicable. Participation in PregSource℠  is open to adults between the age s of 18 to 70 
years who are pregnant.  
 
In addition, we will be collecting developmental data on the infants born to the mothers.  
 
9.2. JUSTIFICATION FOR INCLUSION OF VULNERABLE SUBJECTS 
Pregnant wom en who have access to the Internet  may join PregSource℠. Because this study 
will only be collecting data, not providing or requiring any physical examinations or procedures, inclusion of pregnant women does not pose any specific risk above minimal risk to her or her fetus .

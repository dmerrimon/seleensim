Dear Parents and Guardians,  
We would like to invite your child to participate in a research project to learn about how certain 
activities might help them relieve stress and improve their quality of life. We are asking for your 
child’s help because we don’t know very much about how st udents your child’s age might be 
able to best cope with and reduce stress.  Participation in this study is completely voluntary.  If 
you agree to your child being in our study, we are going to ask your child to answer a few 
questions about their stress lev els and overall well -being before and after this 8 -week program. 
We want to know if certain activities help reduce their stress —specifically, yoga.   Here’s what
your child’s activities might look like:
*Yoga : Each session will highlight deep breathing, m indful movement, and stress relief.
Sessions will begin with goal -setting, will move into the physical practice, and will end with
a peaceful reflection that will help students feel less stressed.  This program will take place
twice weekly during your chil d’s regularly scheduled physical education class.
At the end of the program, we may ask your child if they feel like they can concentrate in class 
more, if they feel less stressed out, or if they feel happier or less anxious. In order to measure 
stress le vels, students’ stress hormone (cortisol) levels will be tested throughout the program
through a collected saliva (spit) sample; you can learn more about the procedure for this safe, 
non-invasive process here:  https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/family -resources -
education/health -wellness -and-safety -resources/helping -hands/saliva -cortiso l-test-collection -
guidelines .  You or your child can ask questions about the details of study at any time. If you or 
they decide at any time not to continue participating, then they won’t be a part of the study.
The questions we will ask are only about w hat your child thinks and feels before and after the 
study, which will take place for 8 weeks. There are no right or wrong answers, and we will 
explain to them that this is not a test. We will also ask your child to write down and share with us 
his or her reactions to the yoga session in a journal each week so we can learn what was helpful 
to them in this study. As a part of the study, we will look at your child’s academic  records and 
stress levels measured in multiple ways ; specifically, we will examine  their MAPS scores, 
attendance/tardiness records, and behavioral referrals before and after the study.  We will also ask 
your child  to fill out surveys that gather information about their overall quality of life, and we 
will also give students a survey where t hey will be providing the number of difficult life 
experiences they have experienced.  In order to protect your child’s privacy, no information
concerning the details of these experiences will be collected other than the number the child has 
experienced. A ll student information will be kept completely confidential and private --random 
ID numbers will be assigned by your child’s teacher to each child in the study. However, in the 
event that a child shows any indication of suicidal thoughts, risk of self -harm,  or harm to others 
during any part of the study, we will promptly notify school officials to discuss appropriate 
responses .  Copies of all surveys and questionnaires will be provided to parents/guardians by 
request prior to the beginning of the program.  This program is scheduled to begin late January 
2020.            (continued on next page)  
 
It is possible that the program may bring up strong emotions for the participants; to help with this 
this, the research team will caution students that this may happen, and we will and emphasize the  
importance of self -care and knowing one’s own limits wit h the program. If needed, referrals for  
additional, outside treatment will be provided if necessary and/or requested.  Additional 
resources include:  
-    Talking with someone who you can trust  
- Calling 911, your doctor or other healthcare provider  
- Going to an Emergency Room  
- Calling 1 -800-273-TALK (8255) to talk with a crisis worker for free  
- Texting 741741 to text with a counselor for free  
- Visiting NowMattersNow.org to learn skills for dealing wi th thoughts of suicide  
 
Importantly, there are also potential benefits to being part of the study.  Participants may have 
reductions in severity of depression and/or anxiety as well as improvements in overall behavioral 
health and well -being. Additional  benefits for participants may be improved sleep, improved 
social skills, improved emotion regulation, improved academic behaviors and outcomes.   
 
Please return this form to the school by January 15, 2020. Being in the study is up to you and 
your child. No on e will be upset if you don’t want your child to be in the study or if you or your 
child decide later not to participate.  It will also not impact your child’s grades or school standing 
in any way.

Student Assent Form  
We are doing a research project to learn about how certain types of activities might help lower your 
stress and make your life better. We are asking for your help because we don’t know very much about 
how kids your age are best able to reduce their stress levels.  If you agree to join our project, we are going 
to ask you some questions about yo urself and your stress levels before and after this 8 -week program. We 
want to know if you feel like certain activities help you feel calmer and/or happier after participating in 
yoga.  Here’s what the activities might look like:  
*Yoga : Each session will h ighlight deep breathing, mindful movement, and stress relief. Sessions will 
begin with goal -setting, then the physical practice, and will end with a peaceful relaxation activity 
that will help you feel less stressed. This will take place twice weekly for 8  weeks during your 
physical education class.  
After you complete the program, we may ask you if you feel more focused in class, if you feel less 
stressed out, or if your grades have changed with the exercise program. We will also be collecting a 
sample of your saliva (spit) periodically during the program to measure your stress hormone levels 
(cortisol) to see if this program helps reduce your stress.   
The questions we will ask you are only what you think before and after the study. There are no right 
or wrong answers, and this is not a test --it will NOT have any impact on your school grades. As a part of 
the research project, we will look at some information on your student records, your stress levels, and ask 
you to respond to a survey where you will prov ide the number of difficult life experiences you have 
experienced.  To protect your privacy, no information concerning the details of these experiences will be 
collected other than the number you have experienced. All your information will be kept complete ly 
confidential and private.  However, if you start to have suicidal thoughts, think about hurting yourself or 
others during any part of the study, we will let school officials know for your own and others’ safety.  
You can ask questions about this study a t any time. If you decide at any time not to finish, then you 
don’t have to be a part of the study; participation in this study is completely voluntary.  
The questions on the surveys we will ask are only about what you think. There are no right or 
wrong ans wers because this is not a test.   We will also ask you to write down and share with us your 
reactions to the yoga session in a journal each week so we can learn what was helpful to you in this study. 
It is possible that the program may bring up strong feel ings for you; it’s important for you to know your 
own limits and take care of yourself during the program.   If you ask or if you need it, we will give you 
information for where you can find extra support. Some examples are:  
-    Talking with someone who you  can trust  
- Calling 911, your doctor or other healthcare provider  
- Going to an Emergency Room  
- Calling 1 -800-273-TALK (8255) to talk with a crisis worker for free  
- Texting 741741 to text with a counselor for free  
- Visiting NowMattersNow.org to learn skills for  dealing with thoughts of suicide  
Importantly, there are also potential benefits to being part of the study.  Participants may have 
reductions in severity of depression and/or anxiety as well as improvements in overall behavioral health 
and well -being. Add itional  benefits for participants may be improved sleep, improved social skills, 
improved emotion regulation, improved academic behaviors and outcomes.

upset if you don’t sign this paper or if you change your mind lat er.  It also won’t affect your grades or 
school standing whatsoever.

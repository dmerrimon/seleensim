Protocol Number/Title  Phase II Trial of Nivolumab in Combination with 
Talazoparib in Patients with Unresec table or Metastatic 
Melanoma with  Mutations in BRCA  or BRCA -ness 
Study Phase  II  
Brief Background/Rational e 
 
 
 Current treatment for unresectable or metastatic melanoma 
includes monotherapy with nivolumab, with  an objective 
response rate (ORR) of about 40%  in the first line setting 
and about 15% in the refractory setting .  Newer targeted 
therapies in melanoma are needed , especially once patients 
progress on standard therapies . 
 
“BRCA -ness” has not specifically been studied in 
melanoma; however, our  own data  from the only familial 
melanoma registry in the United States suggests a 
substantial presence of germline and somatic  mutations in 
this patient population.  In the first 130 melanoma patients 
accrued to our Gross Family  Melanoma Registry at the 
Cleveland Clinic, 19% (25) had a germline 
pathogenic/likely pathogenic  mutation, of which 52% (13) 
were in genes associated  with BRCA1/2 and “BRCA -ness.” 
This represents a significant proportion of patients with 
metastatic melanoma that could benefit from PARP  
inhibitor (PARPi) therapy.  These findings are confirmed in 
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).  Out of 470  
skin cutaneous melanoma patients that have germline 
sequencing data available, 52 (11%) have  
pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline mutations, and 25 
patients (5.3%) have mutations in “BRCA -ness”  genes. 
Somatic mutations involving “BRCA -ness” are equally 
common in TCGA, 16% (n = 72) possess  actionable/likely 
actionable mutations.  
 
Additionally, some data indicate that BRCA -ness genes 
may not be required fo r PARPi efficacy if a tumor  is 
sensitive to immunotherapy. A recent study suggests that in 
addition to synthetic lethality, PARPi trap  the PARP1/2 
enzyme at sites of damaged DNA, and thus prevent DNA 
repair, replication, and  transcription. In vitro studies  have 
demonstrated that the PARPi, talazoparib, has more potent 
PARP  trapping than other PARPi in clinical development 
(4-5). Additionally, PARPi -mediated DNA damage by  
talazoparib has been shown to increase the immunogenicity 
of tumor cells by promoting T  cell and  natural killer cell 
infiltration, and increasing tumor expression of PD-L1 in 
5 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  vitro and in vivo .  Therefore, the use of talazoparib in 
combination with the immune checkpoint inhibitor  (CPI) , 
nivolumab, may  have a synergistic immunotherapeutic and  
antitumor effect without requiring genes conferring 
“BRCAness.”  
 
Biomarker selection strongly influences the efficacy of 
PARP inhibition. Mateo et al. looked at treatment  with the 
PARPi olaparib  in patients with metastatic castration -
resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) . This  study showed that 
treatment with olaparib in patients with mCRPC who had 
germline defects in DNA  repair  genes led to a high 
response rate.  Conversely, within the mCRPC cohort 
without a “BRCA -ness”  marker, only a single responder 
was observed.  Eligible alterations were in BRCA1/2, ATM, 
PALB2, CHEK2, FANCA, HDAC2, RAD51, MLH3, 
ERCC3, MRE11 , and NBN . 
 
We propose that PARP inhibition with talazoparib will 
have synergistic antitumo r activity in combination  with 
nivolumab in unresectable and metastatic melanoma 
patients with DNA -repair defects , who have progressed on 
prior CPI  therapy,  and improve  the ORR from 10% to 3 0% 
with limited toxicity.  
Primary Objective  Determine the  clinical efficacy of nivolumab plus 
talazoparib in patients who have progressed on prior CPI , 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRCA1/2  or 
other DNA damage repair mutations (defined as BRCA -
ness), as measured by objective response rate (ORR).   
 
Secondary Objective s • Determine progression free survival (PFS) in 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma patients 
treated with nivolumab plus talazoparib.  
• Determine overall survival (OS).  
 
• Evaluate treatment -related adverse events in patients 
treated with nivolumab plus talazoparib. To assess the 
anti-tumor activity of nivolumab in combination with 
talazoparib in unresectable or metastatic melanoma 
patients with BRCA1/2  or other DNA damage re pair 
mutations (defined as BRCA -ness), as measured by 
immune -related objective response rate ( irORR)  
every 12 weeks for a period of approximately 12 
months.

05/09/2023  • Determine immune -related progression free survival 
(irPFS) in unresectable or metastatic melanoma  
patients treated with nivolumab plus talazoparib.  
Correlative  Objective (s) 
 • Measure  adaptive and innate cellular 
immunofiltration into tumor (by tumor biopsies) and 
peripheral circulating T cells (by PBMCs) at 
baseline (pre -treatment), after treatment initiation 
(at about 12 weeks), and at time of progression, and 
to correlate activity with response to treatment.  
   
• Assess total somatic tumor mutation burden by 
sequencing at baseline (pre -treatment), after therapy 
at 12 weeks, and at time of progression to evaluate 
DNA landscape and its effect on sensitivity of 
combination nivolumab and talazoparib therapy.  
 
• Assess patient reported outcomes for adverse events 
while on combination therapy at baseline and before 
each cycle (about every 4 weeks) of nivolumab.  
 
• Assess ctDNA, CNV at baseline, at C2D1 and 
C3D1  and at time of progression .

05/09/2023  1.0 Introduction  
 
1.1 Background of Melanoma and standard therapies   
 
Cutaneous malignant melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer, accounting 
for the large majority of skin cancer -related deaths.  Incidence rates continue to increase 
for melanoma, it is the fifth most common cancer in men and women, with current  
estimate of 96,000 new diagnoses and 9,000 deaths annually in the United States.1  
Although early stage patients can be treated successfully with surgical resection in the 
majority, many will develop metastatic disease.  Overall five year survival for all stages 
of melanoma is  about  92%; however five year overall survival for metastatic melanoma 
is 23% .1  
 
Prior to the advent of immunotherapy in 2011, median overall survival for metastatic 
melanoma was 6 -8 months, with five year OS less than 10%  with the use of dacarbazine 
or temozolomide chemotherapy .2  Recently, treatment options for patients with advanced 
melanoma have expanded greatly with the United States (US ) Food and Drug 
Administration ( FDA ) approval in 2011 -2013 of the anti -cytotoxic T -lymphocyte antigen 
4 (CTLA -4) antibody, ipilimumab, and the highly selective inhibitors of BRAFV600E, 
vemurafenib and dabrafenib.  In addition, the MEK inhibitor, trametinib , also received 
FDA approval in 2013 for the treatment of patients with BRAFV600E mutant melanoma. 
Combination  BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy received FDA approval in 2014 based on a 
randomized Phase II study in which the combination showed superior efficacy relative to 
dabrafenib alone.  
 
Current treatment of metastatic melanoma includes combined administration of anti - 
CTLA -4 immunotherapy with ipilimumab plus anti -programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD -
1) immunotherapy with nivolumab or monotherapy with nivolu mab.3–7  In a phase 3 study 
by Larkin et al. (CheckMate 067), 945 previousl y untreated unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive nivolumab alone, nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab, or ipilimumab alone.  T he median progression -free survival was 14 months in 
the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group and in the  nivolumab group, however higher adverse 
events of grade 3 or 4 toxicity were observed in the combination group  (55.0%) compared 
to nivolumab monotherapy (14.3%).3 The objective response rate (ORR) was 43.7% (95% 
CI, 38.1 -49.3) in the nivolumab group, and 57.6% (95% CI, 52.0 -63.2) in the combination 
group. In December 2014, the FDA  approved nivolumab as a single agent for treatment in 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma.  In Checkmate 066, advanced BRAF wild -type 
melanoma patients were randomized to receive nivolumab or dacarbazine as first line 
therapy.  The objective respon se rate was 40% in the nivolumab group and 14% in the 
dacarbazine group.8   
 
Once patients progress on prior anti -PD-1 therapy, limited treatment options are available.  
This refractory population includes patients who possess a targetable BRAF mutation and 
have already received combined BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy and those who have 
received prior anti -PD-1 therapy, in whom response rates to salvage anti -PD-1 therapy or 
combination CTLA4/PD -1 inhibition are low.  A recent retrospective study presented at 
11 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  ASCO 2019 (n = 200) demonstrated that treatment after anti -PD-1 monotherapy with 
combination ipilimumab and nivolumab (n = 77) had an ORR of about 19%, single agent 
ipilimumab (n = 47) 4.2%, and re -challenge with BRAF/MEK inhibitor in the BRAF 
mutant subpopulation (n = 18) 22%.9  Grade 3 -4 toxicity or toxicity requiring treatment 
discontinuation was observed in 34% of patients in the combination ipilimumab /nivolumab 
arm.  This finding is consistent with a prior study where patients treated with 
ipilimumab/nivolumab (n = 37) after failure with anti -PD-1 therapy had an ORR of 21% 
and 16% in patients treated with single agent ipilimumab (n=47).10  Additionally, another 
retrospective study (n=398) presented at ASCO 2019 demonstrated that once patients 
progress on prior anti -PD-1 therapy, retreatment with anti -PD-1 achieved modest 
responses.  Of 34 patients who received a second course of anti -PD-1 therapy, only five 
(14.7%) had an objective response; specifically, two (5.9%) achieved a CR and three 
(8.8%) had tumor shrinkage.11 Ongoing trials in refractory metastatic melanoma aim to 
reach better salvage efficacy in ORR than with single agent anti -PD-1 therapy or 
combination CTLA4/PD -1 inhibition.  
 
1.2 Nivolumab  
 
Nivolumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibody that targets the PD -1 protein. This 
monoclonal antibody was evaluated in a phase I/II study in 296 patients with a variety of 
heavily pretreated malignancies, including 107 patien ts with melanoma.12 Updated 
efficacy data with an additional one year follow up for the melanoma cohort showed that 
the overall ORR was 31% for the entire melanoma patient cohort and an additional 7% of 
patients had stable disease .13 No clear -cut dose response relation was observed, although a 
dose of 3mg/kg had the highest response rate (41%).  Median duration of response was 24 
mont hs.   
 
Grade  3 or 4  treatment related adverse events  (AE)  were observed in 32 of 296 patients 
(14%) enrolled in the study.12  A variety of autoimmune side effects were observed, 
including pneumonitis, vitiligo, hepatitis, hypophysitis, thyroiditis, and colitis.  
 
Severa l phase 3 trials have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nivolumab 
in unresectable or advanced melanoma.  An international phase 3 randomized controlled 
trial by Weber et al. evaluated nivolumab as second -line or later -line therapy.  Spe cifically, 
if patients had progressed after ipilimumab, (and if indicated) BRAF inhibitor therapy, they 
were randomly assigned to intravenous nivolumab 3mg/kg every 2 weeks or investigator 
choice chemotherapy (ICC) with decarbazine or paclitaxel combined w ith carboplatin.  
From December 2012 -January 2014, 272 patients were randomized to nivolumab and 133 
to chemotherapy. ORR of first 120 patient on nivolumab was 32% versus 10% in 
chemotherapy group. Grade 3 -4 AEs related to nivolumab was observed in 12 (5%)  of 
patients, which included increased lipase, transamintis, anemia, and fatigue.4 Updates to 
this study showed longer median duration of response for nivolum ab versus ICC (32 
months vs. 13 months), and confirmed overall response rate of nivolumab (27% versus 
10% in ICC).14 Preli minary results of this study le d to FDA approval of nivolumab in 
refractory melanoma  on December 22, 2014 .   
 
12 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  A second phase 3 study by Robert et al. (CheckMate 066) randomly assigned 418 
previously untreated patients with metastatic melanoma without a BRAF mutation to 
receive nivolumab 3mg/kg every two weeks and dacarbazine -matched placebo every three 
weeks or dacarbazine and placebo  from January 2013 to February 2014 .  At one year, 
overall rate of survival was 73% in nivolumab group versus 42% in dacarbazine group.  
Median PFS was 5 months in nivolumab group versus 2.2 months in dacarbazine group. 
ORR was 40% versus 14%, respectively.15  Three -year follow up of this study showed 
median OS of 37.5 months in nivolumab group and 11.2 months in dacarbazine group; 
three -year overall survival rates were 51.2% and 21.6% respectively.  Treatment related 
grade  3/4 AEs were reported in 15 .0% (31 of 206) of nivolumab treated patients, leading 
to 5% (10 of 206) discontinuing therapy.   These included pruritis, diarrhea, and rash.  Any 
grade AEs included vitiligo, erythema, hypothyroidism and infusion -related reaction.16 
This study led to FDA approval of nivolumab in treatment -naïve BRAF V600E wild -type 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma on November 23, 2015.  
 
1.3  Talazoparib  
 
Poly ADP ribose polymerase -1 (PARP1) is a protein responsibl e for repairing single -strand 
breaks in DNA. Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 cause errors in DNA repair. Talazoparib 
is a potent, orally bioavailable, small molecule PARP inhibitor in development for the 
treatment of a variety of human cancers.  Drugs that in hibit PARP1 cause multiple double 
strand breaks (DSBs) to form in tumors with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations that cannot 
be repaired, leading to cell death, a cytotoxic effect referred to as synthetic lethality. Studies 
have demonstrated clinical benefit with P ARP inhibitors in treatment of germline 
BRCA1/2 -mutant breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. A more recent study suggests that 
PARP inhibitors trap the PARP1 and PARP2 enzyme at sites of damaged DNA, and thus 
prevent DNA repair, replication, and transcrip tion.17  
 
In vitro  studies have demonstrated that the PARP inhibitor, talazoparib, has more potent 
PARP trapping than other PARP inhibitors in clinical development.18,19 Additionally, 
PARP inhibitor -mediated DNA damage has been shown to increase the immunogen icity 
of tumor cells, as evidenced by talazoparib promoting T cell and natural killer cell 
infiltration in a murine model of ovarian cancer.20  Talazoparib has also been shown to 
increase tumor expression of programmed death -ligand 1 (PD -L1) in vitro  and in vivo .21 
Therefore, the use of talazoparib in combination with the immu ne checkpoint inhibitor, 
nivolumab, may have a synergistic immunotherapeutic and antitumor effect.   
 
Talazop arib has been studied in Phase I and II  (ABRAZO) trials in solid tumors, and in a 
Phase III (EMBRACA) study in locally advanced or metastatic breas t cancer with germline 
BRCA  mutations.  In the Phase I  trial, the most common adverse events related to 
talazoparib were anemia, thrombocytopenia, and mild -to-moderate fatigue.22 Overall, 
talazoparib was tolerated well in the EMBRACA trial. Of 28 7 patients in the talazoparib 
arm, grade 3 or 4 hematologic adverse events, pri marily anemia, occurred in 55% of the 
patients. Nonhematologic adverse events like diarrhea and nausea, occurred in 32% of 
patients; however, the majority of nonhematologic adverse events in the talazoparib group 
were grade 1 in severity.  Patients treated with talazoparib (1 mg QD) had significantly 
13 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  longer median progression -free survival than those receiving physician’s choice of 
chemotherapy (8.6 vs. 5.6 months, respectively; 95% CI: 0.41 –0.71; HR: 0.54; 
p<0.0001).23  Patients who received talazoparib had significant overall improvements in 
patient -reported global health status/quality of life scores and a significantly greater delay 
in time to clinical d eterioration.24  Based on this study, talazoparib was approved for use 
by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults with deleterious or 
suspected deleterious germline BRCA -mutated (g BRCA m) human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 (HER2) -negative loc ally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in 2018.  
 
1.3.1 Talazoparib Clinical Experience  
 
Talazoparib is a potent, orally bioavailable, small molecule PARP inhibitor in development 
for the treatment of a variety of human cancers.  
 
As of 30 November 2016, approximately 439 patients have received talazoparib in  
company -sponsored studies in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Studies in solid 
tumors include a Phase 1 study (PRP -00122) in advanced or recurrent solid tumors, a  
Phase 1 study in advanced malignancies (PRP -002), a Phase 2 study (673 -20125) in locally 
advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer patients with a ge rmline BRCA defect, a  
Phase 3 study (673 -30123) in locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with a germline  
BRCA defect, a Phase 1 hepatic impairment  study (MDV3800 -02), a Phase 1 absorption, 
distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) study (MDV3800 -0326), and a Phase 1 
study  on cardiac repolarization (MDV3800 -1427). 
 
As of 30 November 2016, aggregate safety data from 3 company -sponsored clinical studies 
evaluating  talazoparib monotherapy at the proposed dose of 1 mg QD in patients with 
advanced malignancies (Phase 1 studies PRP -001 and MDV3800 -14 and Phase 2 study 
673-201; 164 patients total) provide the basis for the most common treatment emergent 
adverse events ( TEAEs).  The most common TEAEs associated with talazoparib (>20%) 
occurring in patients who received 1 mg QD talazoparib were anemia (42.1%), fatigue 
(36.6%), nausea (29.3%), thrombocytopenia (25.6%), neutropenia (20.7%), and alopecia 
(20.1%). The most com mon Grade 3 or higher drug -related TEAEs occurring in ≥5% of 
patients were anemia (28.0%), thrombocytopenia (16.5%), and neutropenia (12.2%).  
 
Serious AEs (SAEs) occurred in 52 of 164 patients (31.7%) who received 1 mg QD  
talazoparib. SAEs occurring in ≥2% of patients were pleural effusion (4.3%), anemia and 
dyspnea (3.7% each), and neoplasm progression and thrombocytopenia (2.4% each).  
Fourteen patients had SAEs considered related to talazoparib, which included anemia 
(3.0%); thrombocytopenia (2.4%); plate let count decreased (1.2%); and increased 
transaminases, neutropenic sepsis, and vomiting (0.6% each).  
 
A total of 12 of 164 patients (18.8%) who received 1 mg QD talazoparib had a TEAE that 
led to death (6 associated with the underlying malignancy includi ng 1 also associated with 
bronchopneumonia; 2 dyspnea; and 1 each disease progression, lung infection, hypoxia, 
and respiratory failure). Of these events, none were assessed as related to talazoparib.  
 
14 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  Among the 164 patients who received 1 mg QD talazopari b, 19.5% had a TEAE that led 
to dose reduction and 57.3% had a TEAE that led to dose interruption. The most common  
TEAEs that led to dose reduction or interruption were associated with myelosuppression.  
Five of 164 patients (3.0%) treated with talazoparib at a dose of 1 mg QD permanently 
discontinued talazoparib due to a TEAE. The TEAEs that led to study drug discontinuation 
were anemia, increased ALT, increased AST, metastatic breast cancer, and dyspnea.  
 
1.3.2  Clinical Efficacy  of Talazoparib  in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors  
 
A total of 110 patients with advanced tumors with DNA repair pathway abnormalities, 
particularly those associated with BRCA and phosphatase tensin homolog (PTEN) 
dysfunction, were enrolled in the Phase 1 study PRP -001, which was completed in March  
2015.22 The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of talazoparib was defined as 1 mg QD and 
it was used in the expansion phase of the study in patients with breast, ovarian/primary  
peritoneal, and pancreatic cancer with deleterious germline mutations; small cell lung 
cancer (SCLC); and Ewing sarcoma . As of 13 February 2015, the proportion of patients 
with breast, ovarian/primary peritoneal, and pancreatic cancers with BRCA mutations who 
were treated with talazoparib at 1 mg QD and had objective responses according to 
RECIST v1.1 was 50% (7 of 14; 95%  CI: 23.0, 77.0), 41.7% (5 of 12; 95% CI: 15.2, 72.3), 
and 20.0% (2 of 10), respectively. Cancer patients harboring BRCA mutations who are 
resistant to platinum -based chemotherapy display decreased sensitivity to PARP 
inhibitors.28  
 
1.3.3  Clinical Efficacy  of Talazoparib  in Patients with Germline BRCA Mutations 
and Locally Advanced and/or Metastatic Breast Cancer  
 
The ongoing Phase 2, open -label, 2 -stage, 2 -cohort study, 673 -201, is evaluating 
talazoparib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with deleterious 
germline BRCA mutations. Enrolled patients included those who were platinum -sensitive 
(Cohort 1) and patients who received at least 3 prior chemotherapy regimens and no prior 
platinum therapy (Cohort 2). As of 1 September 2016, the data cut -off for the primary 
analysis, 83 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with deleterious 
germline BRCA mutations were tumor evaluable (48 patients in Cohort 1; 35 patients in 
Cohort 2), and 9 patients were continuing on treatment. Efficacy  analyses were conducted 
by independent central radiology assessment. The ORR was 20.8% (95% CI: 10.47, 34.99) 
in Cohort 1, 37.1% (95% CI: 21.47, 55.08) in Cohort 2 and 27.7% (95% CI: 18.45, 38.62) 
overall. This response rate, which included 2 CRs and 8 PR s in Cohort 1 and 13 PRs in 
Cohort 2, is considered clinically meaningful as these populations have a poor prognosis.25 
 
The landmark EMBRACA phase 3, randomized, open -label trial for patients with advanced 
breast cancer and a germline BRCA1/2 mutation (n = 431) compared patients treated with 
single agent ta lazoparib (1mg daily) or standard single -agent chemotherapy of physician’s 
choice. 287 were assigned to receive talazoparib.  Median PFS was significant longer in 
the talazoparib group than in the standard -therapy group (8.6 months vs 5.6 months; HR 
0.54; 95% CI 0.41 -0271 p<0.001).  The ORR was higher in the talazoparib group than in 
the standard -therapy group (62.6% vs. 27.7%; OR 5; 95% CI 2.9 -8.8; p<0.001).  
15 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  Additionally, patient -reported outcomes favored talazoparib; significant overall 
improvements and significant delays in the time to clinically meaningful deterioration were 
observed.  Grade 3 -4 hematologic events (anemia) occurred in 55% of patients who 
received talazoparib and 38% of patients who received standard therapy. Nonhematologic 
adverse event s like diarrhea and nausea, occurred in 32% of patients; however, the majority 
of nonhematologic adverse events in the talazoparib group were grade 1 in severity.23,24 
 
1.3.4  Pharmacokinetics of Talazoparib in Humans  
 
PK analysis for talazoparib was conducted based on 6207 PK observations of 490 patients 
with advanced cancer from 4 clinical trials, Studies PRP -001, PRP -002, 673 -201, and 673 -
301.  The PK of talazoparib as a single agent was evaluat ed in 142 adult patients with 
cancer, including 109 patients with solid tumors (Study PRP -001) and 33 with hematologic 
malignancies (Study PRP -002). Doses of 0.025 mg to 2 mg were administered orally as a 
single dose or as QD doses. This dose range bracket ed the 1 mg QD dose used in ongoing 
safety and efficacy studies, and provided a framework for assessing dose linearity. As the  
PK of talazoparib was similar in patients wi th solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, 
and no differences were apparent betwee n males and females, the results are summarized 
collectively.  
 
Oral absorption of talazoparib was rapid and independent of dose after administration of 
single or QD doses. Peak talazoparib concentrations were generally reached approximately  
1 to 8 hours po st-dose. Exposure increased approximately dose -proportionally with 
increasing doses. At 1 mg/day, the mean t1/2 was approximately 2 days; the mean apparent 
volume of distribution (V/F) was 415 L, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.  
 
Steady sta te was reached in approximately 2 to 3 weeks with daily administration.  
Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of talazoparib appeared to be dose linear, with a mean CL/F 
across doses of approximately 5 L/h. Renal excretion was a major elimination pathway for 
unch anged parent talazoparib. Following oral administration, 44% to 90.6% of the dose 
was recovered in urine as unchanged parent drug over 24 hours at steady state for doses up 
to 1 mg QD. Mean renal clearance ranged from 1.38 L/h to 4.96 L/h independent of do se, 
suggesting linear urinary elimination kinetics.  
 
Following repeated administration at 1 mg QD, talazoparib accumulated approximately  
2.4-fold relative to a single dose.  At steady state, the mean maximum plasma concentration 
(Cmax) was 21.0 ng/mL (55 n M), the mean plasma trough concentration (Ctrough) was 
3.72 ng/mL (9.87 nM), and the mean area under the plasma concentration -time curve 
(AUC) was 202 ng*h/mL (532 nM*h). The Ctrough of talazoparib at steady state at 1 mg 
QD is above the Ctrough values at the efficacious dose of 0.33 mg/kg daily used in some 
of the xenograft models (1.3 nM).  
 
PK data from a food -effect study showed that food had no effect on the extent of absorption 
of talazoparib (AUC) but decreased the rate of absorption (Cmax was 46% low er and time 
to Cmax [Tmax] was 2.63 hours later); however, this reduction in the rate of absorption 
following a single dose is not clinically relevant because talazoparib accumulates 2.4 -fold 
16 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  at steady state after 1 mg QD dosing. Furthermore, AUC or Ctroug h is thought to drive 
efficacy, not Cmax; therefore, talazoparib can be taken with or without food. Talazoparib 
is being administered without regard to food in ongoing safety and efficacy studies.  
 
A preliminary population PK analysis used data from patients in Studies PRP -001 and  
PRP-002 to assess the effects of renal function on the PK of talazoparib. The talazoparib  
CL/F in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLCR] 60 -89 mL/min) 
was similar compared with patients wi th normal renal function (CLCR ≥ 90 mL/min ). In 
patients with moderate renal impairment (CLCR 30 -59 mL/min), the talazoparib CL/F was 
decreased by 44% from normal, resulting in higher talazoparib exposure.  
 
The effect of renal impairment on talazoparib PK is also be ing investigated in the ongoing 
study MDV3800 -01. 
 
The effect of hepatic impairment on talazoparib PK is being investigated in the ongoing  
MDV3800 -02 study.  
 
The potential for talazoparib to affect the PK of other drugs was assessed through in vitro 
experi ments and is described in the talazoparib IB.29  For additional information on 
pharmacokinetics, metabolism, drug -drug interactions, safety, efficacy and any additional 
information on talazoparib, please refer to the investigator brochure.  
 
1.3.5  Clinical Experience in Patients with mCRPC Treated with PARP Inhibitors 
as a Single Agent or in Combination with Immunotherapy  
 
The PARP inhibitor olaparib given as single agent was evaluated in a Phase 2 study in  
50 patients with previously treated mCRPC.30 Of the 50 patients, all patients had received 
prior treatment with docetaxel, 49 (98%) had received abiraterone or enzalutamide, and 29 
(58%) had received cabazitaxel. Of the 49 patients evaluable for response (defined either  
as an objective response according to RECIST v1.1, or as a reduction of at least 50% in the 
prostate -specific antigen (PSA) level or a confirmed reduction in the circulating tumor -cell 
count from 5 or more cells per 7.5 mL of blood to less than 5 cells pe r 7.5 mL), 16 patients 
achieved a response (33%; 95% CI: 20.0, 48.0). Homozygous deletions, deleterious 
mutations, or both were identified in DNA -repair genes in 16 patients (33%) and 14 of 
these patients (88%) achieved a response.  
 
The combination of olap arib with durvalumab was evaluated in a Phase 1/2 study in  
17 patients with mCRPC  with and without somatic or germline DDR mutations . Overall, 
median radiographic progression -free survival (r PFS) for all patients was 16.1 months 
(95% CI: 4.5 -16.1 months) w ith a 12 -month rPFS of 51.5% (95% CI: 25.7 -72.3%).  
Activity was seen in patients with alterations in DDR genes with median rPFS of 16.1 
months (95% CI: 7.8 -18.1 months). 53% (n = 9) had a radiographic and/or PSA response  
(defined as ≥50% decline in PSA) .  Patients with fewer peripheral myeloid -derived 
suppressor cells and with alterations in DDR genes were more likely to respond . The 12 -
month PFS probability was 83% (95% CI: 27.3 -94.5%) in patients with mutations, 
compared to 36.4% (95% CI: 11.2 -62.7%) for  those without mutations ( p = 0.031) .  Most 
17 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  common treatment -related grade 3 or 4 adverse events were anemia (24%), lymphopenia 
(12%), infection (12%), and nausea (12%).  Four patients had immune -related adverse 
events (irAEs) of any grade, including two w ith acute onset hearing loss, one with optic 
neuritis, and one patient with synovitis.  All were treated with high -dose steroids and 
symptoms improved to near complete resolution with exception of one patient with hearing 
loss, who required use of a hearin g aid.31 
 
Veliparib given as a single agent was investigated in a Phase 1 dose -finding study in 
patients  with advanced solid tumors; overall, 98 patients were enrolled, of whom 78 had 
disease with  a germline BRCA defect.32  Three patients with BRCA2 germline mutated 
mCRPC were  enrolled at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and wer e evaluable for 
response. In these  patients, the ORR was 2/3 (66%) and all patients had a PSA reduction 
>50% with respect to  baseline.  
 
A Phase 1 study evaluated niraparib given as a single agent in 100 patients with advanced  
solid tumors.33 A total of 23 mCRPC patients were enrolled and 21 of these received  
niraparib at 290 mg QD or 300 mg QD. No mCRPC patient achieved an objective response  
but 9 patients h ad SD with a median duration of 254 days (range: 124 –375 days)  and 1 
patient had a >50% decrease in the concentration of PSA and had remained on study for  
306 days.  
 
RP2D for talazoparib  in combination with avelumab is currently being studied in Phase 
1b/2 trial [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] in patients  with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.  DLT rate 
of avelumab in combination with talazoparib is also being studied in this clinical trial.  
 
Additionally, combination niraparib  (200mg daily)  and pembrolizumab (200mg IV every 
21 days) was recently studied in a phase 2 trial of 55 patients with advanced or metastatic 
TNBC, and showed reasonable efficacy with a tolerable safety profile.  This stud y found 
an ORR of 21% and DCR of 49% with a tolerable safety profile.  Most common treatment -
related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were anemia, thrombocytopenia, and fatigue; 
two patients experienced grade 3 immune -related adverse events.34 
 
 
 
 
 
1.4 Rationale  
 
Limited studies are available to understand the role of PARP inhibitors in treatment of 
melanoma. Czyz et al. conducted in vitro  studies looking at the effect of the PARP inhibitor 
olaparib in eight DSB repair genes expressed in melanoma that were identifi ed in The 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Specifically, in melanoma cells displaying down 
regulation of the DSB repair gene LIG4, PARP inhibition alone and in combination with 
dacarbazine caused accumulation of toxic DSBs and apoptosis, suggesting tha t the 
phenomenon of synthetic lethality could be applied in melanoma.35 Furthermore, this study 
showed that olaparib was selectively toxic to DSB repair deficient human melanoma 
18 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  xenografts, which was further enhanced in the presence of dacarbazine .  This suggests that 
melanomas could be sensitive to PARP inhibitor -mediated synthetic lethality due to their 
putative deficiencies in DNA repair pathways. Further elaborating on this concept, in the 
B16F10 murine syngeneic melanoma model, the PARP inhibi tor (ABT -888), now known 
as veliparib, strongly potentiated temozolomide (TMZ) with significant antitumor efficacy 
in a dose -proportional manner, but did not show single agent activity.36,37  Preclinical 
studies with PARP inhibitor therapy in DSB repair deficient melanoma tumors suggest a 
synthetic lethality and a synergistic effect.  
 
In vitro  studies have demonstrated that the PARP inhibitor, talazoparib, has more potent 
PAR P trapping than other PARP inhibitors in clinical development.18,19 Additionally, 
PARP inhibitor -mediated DNA damage has been shown to increase the immunogenicity 
of tumor cells, as evidenced by talazoparib promoting T cell and natural killer cell 
infiltration in a murine model of ovarian cancer.20  Talazoparib has also been shown to 
increase tumor expression of programmed death -ligand 1 (PD -L1) in vitro  and in vivo .21 
Furthermore, olaparib has been shown to increase cytotoxic T cell infiltration by 
augmenting STING (stimulator of interferon genes) intracellular pathway,  an innate 
immune response activated by cytosolic DNA (perhaps a consequen ce of DNA damage by 
olaparib) that can lead to enhanced interferon (IFN) production and further T cell 
recruitment and activation.38  Therefore, the use of talazoparib in combination with the 
immune checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, may have a synergistic immunotherapeutic and 
antitumor effect.   
 
Middleton et al. conducted a Phase II randomized, controlled, double -blinded clinical trial 
evaluating veliparib with TMZ in patients with metastatic melanoma.  Patients ( n = 346) 
were randomized to veliparib 20mg with TMZ, veliparib 40mg with TMZ, or placebo with 
TMZ.39 Median PFS was 3.7 [95% CI, 3.0 -3.5], 3.6 [95% CI, 1.9 -4.1], and 2 [9 5% CI, 1.9 -
3.7] months in the 20 mg, 40mg, and placebo arms, respectively. The ORR was 10.3%, 
8.7%, and 7.0%. Although not statistically significant, the PFS was almost doubled in the 
combination arms compared to the placebo arm, supporting that PARP inhib ition promotes 
synthetic lethality and potentiates TMZ activity in melanoma. PFS was better in patients 
receiving veliparib with low ERCC1 expression (5.6 vs. 1.9), wildtype BRAF V600 status 
(2.4 vs. 1.8), and positive p16 status (3.8 vs. 1.8) when compare d to placebo.39 ERCC1 is 
part of the nucleotide excision repair pathway.  Low ERCC1 expression coupled with 
PARP inhibition may hinder DNA repair following TMZ exposure, leading to lethal DSBs 
during replication. These data suggest that biomarker selection may inf luence the efficacy 
of PARP inhibition when combined with TMZ.  
 
Biomarker selection strongly influences the efficacy of PARP inhibition.  A study by 
Mateo et al. looked at treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients with 
metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer with DNA -repair defects.30 Of 49 patients, 
16 had a response to olaparib (33%; 95% CI, 20 -48).  In these 16 patients, next -generation 
sequencing identified homozygous deletions, deleterious mutations, or both in DNA -repair 
genes, which included BRCA1/2, ATM , Fanconi anemia genes, and CHEK2 .  The hazard 
ratio for radiologic progression in the biomarker -positive group as compared with the 
biomarker -negative group was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.11 -0.50).  This study showed that treatment 
19 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients with metastatic pr ostate cancer who had 
germline defects in DNA -repair genes led to a high response rate.30 Eligible alterations 
were in BRCA1/2, ATM, PALB2, CHEK2, FANCA, HDAC2, RAD51, MLH3 , ERCC3, 
MRE11 , and NBN .  Many of these, specifically BRCA1/2, ATM, ATR, PALB2, CHEK1/2, 
RAD51, FANCA , and HDAC  have been reported to have a synthetic lethal interaction with 
PARP inhibition, and have been termed “ BRCA -ness.”17,40,41 
 
“BRCA -ness” has not specifically b een studied in melanoma; however our imputations 
from TCGA data and our own data from a local familial melanoma registry suggest a 
substantial presence of germline and somatic mutations in this patient population. Huang 
et al. identified pathogenic germlin e mutations in all cancers using The Cancer Genome 
Atlas. Out of 470 skin cutaneous melanoma patients that have germline sequencing data 
available, 52 (11%) have pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline mutations, and 25 patients 
(5.3%) have mutations in BRCA 1/2 or “BRCA -ness.”42  Looking at somatic mutations 
involving BRCA1/2  or “BRCA -ness” genes in melanoma in TCGA, 16% (n = 72) possess 
actionable/likely actionable mutations when variants of undetermined significance (VUS) 
are excluded.  If VUS are included, 58% (n = 255) of patients possess likely actionable 
mutations.43,44 Up to 63% of melanoma patients possess germline and/or somatic mutations 
in DSB repair genes that could be targeted with PARP inhibitor t herapy.  In the first 130 
melanoma patients accrued to our Gross Family Melanoma Registry at the Cleveland 
Clinic, 19% (25) had a germline pathogenic/likely pathogenic mutation, of which 52% (13) 
were in genes associated with BRCA1/2  and “ BRCA -ness.”45 This rep resents a significant 
proportion of patients with metastatic melanoma that could benefit from PARP inhibitor 
therapy.   
 
We propose that PARP inhibition with talazoparib at a dose of 1mg orally daily will 
have synergistic antitumor activity in combination with nivolumab 480mg 
intravenously every 4 weeks  in unresectable and metastatic melanoma patients with 
DNA -repair defects  in BRCA1/2 or BRCA -ness that have progressed on prior CPI 
therapy  and improve the obje ctive response rate from about 10% to 30 % with limited 
toxicity .   
 
 
 
1.5 Background and rationale of correlative studies  
 
This study intends to characterize the activity of nivolumab in combination with 
talazoparib, with the aim of increasing the clinical benefit seen historically with single 
agent  nivolumab . A key mechanistic hypothesis underpinning the combination is that 
increased DNA damage and cell death mediated by talazoparib will lead to enhanced 
immune priming and tumor immunogenicity, enabling a more effective anti -tumor immune 
response to be promoted by nivolumab. Given this hypothesis, one subgroup of patients 
likely to benefit from the combination will be those whose tumors are most sensitive to 
talazoparib -mediated cell death and DNA damage.  Several biomarkers have the potential 
to identify patients with such increased sensitivity to talazoparib, one of these wil l be 
employe d in the context of this study, the presence of  pathogenic or likely pathogenic 
20 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  germline or somatic  defects in a panel of DDR genes .46  A correlative study will include 
that p rior to study enrollment, we will obtain tumor -biopsy samples from all patients to 
conduct biomarker studies from both germline and somatic DNA, including sequencing to 
identify genomic aberrations  and tumor mutational burden (TMB)  associated with 
sensitivity to PARP inhibition in this disease . 
 
Complementing the DDR biomarkers described above, a number o f assessments will be 
undertaken as correlatives to understand the immune context of patient tumors, which may 
also be a contributing factor in response to the combination of talazoparib and nivolumab. 
These include assessment of immune cell types in the t umor using immunohistochemistry, 
assessment of infiltrating immune cell number and phenotype by immunohistochemistry 
or flow cytometry , relative expression of genes representative of immune activation versus 
suppression by gene expression profiling, and as sessment of mutational or neoantigen load 
within  tumors.  
 
To enable the above mentioned biomarker assessments, the collection of pre -treatme nt 
tumor specimens, including  a tumor tissue sample from a biopsy performed during, or 
within  1 year of, the screen ing period .  See section 4.0 for further clarification on pre -
treatment tumor specimen.   
 
Given the limited ability to assess tumor tissue -based biomarkers longitudinally, 
biomarkers will also be measured in peripheral blood at time points pre -treatment, post-
treatment  and at progression . The primary aim of these measurements is to identify  
mechanistic biomarkers for the combinatio n of nivolumab and talazoparib.  Such 
biomar kers may have value in predicting response to treatment.   
 
In the event that clinical benefit is not observed or is transient, assessment of reasons for 
lack of benefit may help guide patient selection for future development of the combination.  
For these  reasons, tumor biopsies performed at the End -of-Treatment (EOT) visit or in the 
event of permanent treatment discontinuation due to disease progression, are requested 
from patients, unless clinically contraindicated. If the Sponsor considers sufficient da ta 
have been obtained to confirm possible causes for lack of clinical benefit, collection of 
tumor tissue from EOT tumor biopsies may be discontinued.  
 
1.5.1  Banked Biospecimen Collection Rationale  
Banked biospecimens will be collected for the purpose of c onducting research; specific 
uses are described in the Banked Biospecimens section. Comparing the deoxyribonucleic 
acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), protein, and metabolite variation patterns of patients 
who respond well and those who respond poorly to t reatment may help to better define the 
most appropriate group of patients in which to target a given treatment. Collecting 
biospecimens for exploratory pharmacogenomic/genomic/biomarker analyses and 
retaining them in the  Biospecimen Banking System (BBS) ma ke it possible to better 
understand the investigational product’s mechanism of action and to seek explanations for 
differences in, for example,  exposure, tolerability, safety, and/or efficacy not anticipated 
prior to the beginning of the  study.  
 
21 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  Banked bio specimens retained in the BBS also can be used in research on melanoma . 
Providing these biospecimens is a required study activity for study sites and patients, unless 
prohibited by local regulations or ethics committee (EC) decision.

3.0 Study Design  
 
3.1  Study Design  and Schema  
A phase II, single arm,  multi -institutional, open la bel trial in a sample size of 37  primary 
or recurrent , unresectable or metastatic melanoma patients  progressed on prior checkpoint 
inhibitor therapy  with germline or somatic mutations in BRCA1/2  or BRCA -ness.  Prior to 
study enrollment, patients will initially be screened for g ermline or somatic mutations in 
one of the following genes: ARID1A, ARID1B, ARID2, ATM, ATR, BAP1, BARD1, BLM,  
BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDK4, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, DSS1, EMSY, ERCC3,

CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  repair deficiency such as  gLOH  are also permitted as inclusion criteria; other markers of 
HRD may be included as determined by review by the medical monitor .  Prior  to study 
enrollment, we will obtain tumor -biopsy samples to conduct biomarker studies from both 
germline and somatic DNA, including targeted panel and transcriptome sequencing to 
identify genomic aberrations associated with sensitivity to P ARP inhibition in this disease.  
Patients with identified mutations listed above, will then be enrolled in the study.  Patients 
will be treated simultaneously with standard of care therapy,  nivolumab 480mg 
intravenously every 4 weeks plus investigational agent, talazopar ib 1mg orally once daily.   
Beginning with Cycle 1 Day 1, all patients enrolled will simultaneously begin treatment 
with talazoparib 1mg daily , unless otherwise specified,  and nivolumab 480mg every 4 
weeks.  
 
 
Patients will  be assessed every 4 weeks and lab work will be obtained  at that time . CT 
imaging scans will be obtained every 12 weeks  to assess treatment response. If a patient 
achieves a CR, treatment with nivolumab will be continued for a total of one year  from 
time of CR  and talazoparib  will be continued .  In patients with partial response (PR) or 
stable disease (SD), treatment with both agents will be continued until the time of disease 
progression or adverse events.  
 
3.2 Number of Subjects  
Approximately 37  analyzable  subjects will be e nrolled in this trial.  For sample size 
calculation please see Section 14.  
 
3.3 Replacement of Subjects  
Patients who receive at least one dose of treatment with nivolumab and talazoparib will 
contribute to the efficacy analysis.  Any subject who receives at least one cycle or dose 
of treatment on this protocol is evaluable for toxicity.  With 10% of patients potentially 
not evaluable  due to drop out or loss to follow up , 37 patients would need to be enrolled 
for a total of 33  analyzable. Patients who are n ot evaluable are defined as patients who 
are consented and enrolled in the study, but have physically move d away that it would 
be too burdensome to follow up with institution, those who are lost to follow up defined 
as individuals who enroll but do not receive treatment, imaging, and are not present at 
scheduled office visits.

be provided a study number by contacting the study coordinator listed on the cover page.   
 
6.0  Treatment Plan  
 
6.1 Treatment Regimen Overview  
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.  
Patients  found to have a mutation in BRCA1 /2 or BRCA -ness who have enrolled in the trial,  
will begin treatment with both talazoparib 1mg orally daily on Cycle 1 Day 1  and 
nivolumab 480mg intravenously every 4 weeks  and continue without interruption, unless 
necessitated by an adverse event .   
 
Patients will have labs, survey, and an office visit every 4 weeks, prior to administration 
of nivolumab.  Patients will have imaging scans completed every 3 months.  
 
If a CR is achieved, treatment duration for nivolumab and talazoparib will be continued 
until one year from CR. For PR or SD, patients will continue talazoparib 1mg daily and 
nivolumab 480mg every 4 weeks until disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , or for 24 
months of therapy . 
 
28 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  Appropriate dose modification  for talazoparib  is described in Section 7.0  and 7.1 for renal 
impairment .  No dose modification is permitted for nivolumab.   Dose delays are permitted 
for talazoparib and nivolumab to manage toxici ty. 
 
Reported adverse events and potential risks of talazoparib  and nivolumab  are described in 
Section 8.0.  
 
No investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than those described below may 
be administered with the intent to treat the subject's  malignancy.  
 
6.1.1  Talazoparib  Administration  
 
Subject s will take Talazoparib  1mg orally  on Days 1 -28 of each (28 day) cycle  unless 
otherwise specified. . 
Patients should self -administer talazoparib orally QD, with or without food. The capsules 
should be s wallowed whole with a glass of water without chewing, dissolving, or opening 
them prior to swallowing.  
 
Patients should be instructed to take talazoparib at approximately the same time each day 
and to not take more than the prescribed dose at any time.  
 
If a patient misses a day of treatment or vomits any time after taking a dose, he/she must 
be instructed not to “make it up” but to resume subsequent doses the next day as 
prescribed.  
 
Patients should complete the Dosing Diary after taking each dose. If the patient misses a 
day of treatment or takes a dose different than was prescribed, the reason for the missed 
dose or different dose must be recorded in the Dosing Diary. The Dosing Diary should be 
returned  to the site at every cycle.  
 
6.1.2  Nivolumab  Administration  
Subject s will receive Nivolumab 480mg on Day 1  of each (28 day) cycle. Nivolumab  will 
be administered IV over 30 (+/- 5) minutes . 
 
6.4 General Concomitant Medications and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
The following medications are prohibited during the study:  
  
• Prednisone greater than 10 mg (except when used in the management of adverse 
events)  
• Any concurrent antineoplastic therapy for melanoma (ie, chemotherapy, extensive 
radiation therapy, or standard or investigational agents for treatment of 
melanoma ).  
• P-gp inducers  or BCRP inhibitor s (Appendix 5; Section 16.5)  
 
29 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  Because there is a potential for interaction of nivolumab and talazoparib with other 
concomitantly administered drugs through the cytochrome P450 system, P -gp or BCRP 
inhibitors, the case report form must capture the concurrent use of all other drugs, over -
the-counter medications, or alternative therapies. The Principal Investigator should be 
alerted if the subject is taking any agent known to affect or with the potential to affect 
selected CYP450 isoenzymes, P -gp or BCRP inhibitors. Please refer to Appendi x 5; 
Section 16.5 for a complete list.  
 
Palliative (limited -field) radiation therapy is permitted, if all of the following criteria are 
met:  
▪ The lesion being considered for palliative radiation is not a target lesion .  
 
Subjects should receive full suppo rtive care, including transfusions of blood and blood 
products, cytokines, antibiotics, antiemetics, etc . when appropriate.  
 
6.5 Criteria for Removal from Study  
 
Patients will be treated per protocol until : 
 
• Disease progression,  
• Immune -related RECIST v1.1 will be used to guide treatment; if imaging shows 
progressive disease, patients can continue study treatment at the investigator’s 
discretion until confirmatory assessment by imaging ≥ 4 weeks later.  
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
 
• The investigator considers the cessation of treatment , for safety reasons, to be in the best 
interest of the subject .  
 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s) (Defined as u nacceptable treatment relate d toxicity, NCI 
CTCAE version 5 .0 Grade 3 or 4 that fails to recover to < Grade 3 within 4 weeks ), 
 
• Subject  decision to withdraw from treatment (partial consent) or from the study (full 
consent),  
 
• Lost to follow -up 
 
• Pregnancy during the course of the stu dy for a child -bearing participant , 
 
• Death, or  
 
• Sponsor reserves the right to temporarily suspend or prematurely discontinue this study.  
The date and reason for discontinuation must be documented. Every effort should be made 
to complete the appropriate  assessments.  
 
6.5.1  Withdrawal of Consent  
30 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  If the patient refuses further visits, the patient should continue to be followed for survival  
unless the patient withdraws consent for disclosure of future information or for further 
contact. In this case, no fu rther study specific evaluations should be performed, and no 
additional data should be collected. The Sponsor may retain and continue to use any data  
collected before such withdrawal of consent. Subjects should notify the investigator in 
writing of the dec ision to withdraw consent from future follow -up, whenever possible. The 
withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the 
investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is only from further receipt of investigational  
product (in  which case the withdrawal of consent form is not applicable) or also from study 
procedures and/or posttreatment study follow -up (in which case a withdrawal of consent 
form should be provided and signed). In the event that vital status (whether the subject  is 
alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available information should be used to 
determine vital status only as appropriately directed in accordance with local law.  
 
6.5.2 Lost to Follow -up 
If a patient does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact 
the patient and report their ongoing status.  The Investigator should inquire about the 
reason for withdrawal, request that the patient return all unused talazoparib, request that 
the patient return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow -up with the patient regarding 
any unresolved AEs.  
 
 If it is determined that the patient has died, the site will use locally permissible methods 
to obtain the date and cause of death. The site staff and representative will consult  
publicly available sources, such as public health registries and databases, in order to 
obtain updated contact information. If, after all attempts, the patient remains lost to 
follow -up, then the last -known -alive date as determined by the Investigator sho uld be 
reported and documented in the patient’s medical records.  
 
6.6 Duration of Follow Up  
Subjects wil l be followed for toxicity for 30 days after treatment has been discontinued or 
until death, whichever occurs first.  
 
The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it 
has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the ca use.  
 
Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period will necessitate 
follow -up to determine the final outcome. Any serious adverse event that occurs after the 
study period and is considered to be possibly related to the stud y treatment or study 
participation will be recorded and reported immediately.  
 
7.0  Dose Delays/Dose Modifications  
Following dosing interruption due to toxicity at any time in the study, the talazoparib  
dose may need to be reduced, based on the worst toxic ity reported, when treatment is 
resumed.  
 
Dose reduction should be made in accordance with the guidance provided in Section 7 .2. 
31 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  Dose reduction of talazoparib  by 1 dose level at a time will be allowed depending on the 
type and severity of toxicity encountered. Doses less than 0.5 mg are not permitted. 
Patients unable to tolerate 0.5 mg QD, will be permanently discontinued from 
talazoparib, but may continue on s ingle agent nivolumab. Dose reductions of nivolumab 
are not permitted, however dose delays are permitted.  Available dose levels for dose 
reductions for talazoparib are listed in Table 1 . 
 
 
Once a dose has been reduced for a given patient, all subsequent cycles should be 
administered at that dose level, unless further dose reduction is required. Intra -patient 
dose re -escalation is not allowed.  
 
7.1 Dose Modification for Talazoparib for Patients with Renal Impairment  
For patients with moderate renal impairm ent, defined as CLcr 30 -59 mL/min, the 
recommended dose of Talazoparib is 0.75 mg once daily.   Please see S ection 1.3.4 for 
more information. Also  described  in prescriber information/package insert.  
 
7.1.1  Dose Modification for Talazoparib  for use with p -glycoprotein inhibitors  
If patients must be co -administered a p -gp inhibitor ( amiodarone, carvedilol, 
clarithromycin, cobicistat, darunavir, drone darone, erythromycin, indinavir , itraconazole,  
ketoconazole, lapatinib, lopinavir, propafenone , quinidine, ranolazine, ritonavir, 
saquinavir, telaprevir, tipranavir, valspodar, and verapamil) , the talazoparib dose should 
be reduced to 0.75mg daily.  
 
7.2 Study Treatment Modifications for Nivolumab and Talazoparib Drug -Related 
Toxicity (excluding imm une-related adverse events)  
 
Recommended nivolumab  and talazoparib treatment modifications in case of 
investigational  product  (talazoparib)  related toxicity is shown in Table 2 . The specific 
guidelines are applicable in cases  which can be attributed to one of the therapies . The 
instructions should be  followed in the column regarding the therapy  that toxicity is 
attributed to. In  cases where an AE is possibly related to both drugs , the guidelines in 
both columns for both drugs  should be followed. Patients who stop nivolumab or 
talazoparib for unacceptable toxicity may continue treatment with the drug that is not 
considered to be responsible for the toxicity observed.

7.3 Management  of Nivolumab Related Infusion Reaction  
For management of nivolumab related infusion reaction,  follow Institutional guidelines.  
 
In the absence of any such guidelines, or per provider discretion, apply the 
following:  
 
For Grade 1 symptoms: (Mild reaction; itching, rash, hives, fever, rigors): Stop the 
infusion, notify provider and study nurse. Initiate normal saline infusion at 500 ml/hr, 
titrate up to maintain systolic BP >100. Administer diphenhydramine 50mg IV. Remain 
at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms.  
 
The following prophylactic pre -medications are recommended for future infusions: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg  (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg 
(acetaminophen) at least 30 minutes before additional nivolumab administrations.  
 
For Grade 2 symptoms : (Moderate reaction such as SOB, chest tightness, back pain, 
which requires therapy or infusion inter ruption but responds promptly to symptomatic 
treatment ): Follow above for Grade 1 and add o xygen at 2L via nasal cannula and titrate 
to keep O2 saturation > 92% , and give hydrocortisone 100mg IVP once; remain at 
bedside and monitor subject until resolution  of symptoms. If symptoms progress, do not 
re-dose medications already given, move on to treatment for severe / Grade 3 reactions. If 
the infusion is  interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate 
when symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may 
be increased to 100% of the original infusion rate.  
 
Monitor subject closely. If symptoms r ecur, then no further nivolumab will be  
administered at that visit. Administer diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, and remain at bedside 
and monitor the subject until resolution of symptoms. The amount of study drug infused 
must be recorded on the electronic case re port form (eCRF). The following prophylactic 
premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or 
equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) should be administered 
at least 30 minutes before additional nivolumab  administrations. If necessary, 
corticosteroids (recommended dose: up to 25 mg of IV hydrocortisone or equivalent) may 
be used.  
 
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms: (Severe reaction, anaphylaxis, bronchospasm,  
stridor, wheezing, respiratory distress, angioed ema, systolic BP < 80mm Hg, or LOC. 
Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapidly responsive to symptomatic medication and/or brief 
interruption of infusion] recurrence of symptoms following initial improvement; 
hospitalization indicated for other clinical sequelae [eg, renal impairment, pulmonary 
infiltrates]). Grade 4: (life threatening; pressor or ventilatory support indicated): 
Immediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab. Follow guidelines for Grades 1 and 2 
and add the following: Activate emergency response te am as appropriate. Administer 
36 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  medications from Grade 1 and 2 reaction guidelines if not yet given and add Epinephrine 
0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1,000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 
1:10,000 solution.  
 
Subject should be monitored until the investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will 
not recur. Nivolumab will be permanently discontinued.  
 
In the case of late -occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (eg, appearance of a localized or 
generalized pruritis within 1 week after treatmen t), symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, 
oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids).  
 
7.4 Immune -Related Adverse Events Toxicity Management  
 
For patients receiving nivolumab, any AE suspected to be immune -related (irAE ) should 
be managed according to the guidance for management of irAEs  per ASCO guidelines.47  
 
Treatment of irAEs is mainly dependent on severity (NCI CTCAE  v5.0 grade) , 
management summarized per ASCO guidelines below : 
 
• Grade 1: continue nivolumab with close monitoring.  
 
• For grade 2 toxicities, hold nivolumab.  Consider resuming when symptoms 
and/or laboratory values revert to grade 1 or less.  Corticosteroids (initial dose of 
0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent) may be administered.  
 
• Grades 1 to 2 (persistent): manage similar to Grades 3 to 4 AE.  
 
• Grades 3 to 4: treat with high dose corticosteroids; if suspected to be related to 
nivolumab, talazoparib should be withhold until toxicity resolves to Grade ≤1 or 
baseline.  
 
• For Grade ≥3 immune -related toxicities sus pected to be related to nivolumab , 
talazop arib should be withheld until toxicity resolves to Grade ≤1 or baseline.  
Nivolumab should be held for grade 3 toxicities and high -dose corticosteroids 
(prednisone 1 to 2mg/kg/day or methylprednisolone IV 1 to 2mg/kg/day).  
Corticosteroids should be tapered  over the course of at least 4 -6 weeks.  If 
symptoms do not improve with 48 -72 hours of high -dose corticosteroid, 
infliximab may be offered for some toxicities.  
 
• Grade 4 toxicities warrant permanent discontinuation of nivolumab, with the 
exception of endocrinopathies that have been controlled by hormone replacement.

8.0 Adverse Events and Potential Risks  
 
8.1 Talazoparib  
  
A comprehensive list of all reported adverse events and any potential risks for talazoparib  
seen alone or in combination with nivolumab is detailed in Section 7.2.  The recommended 
treatment and clinical management for the commonly occurring events  is outlined in 
Section 7.2 .   
 
8.2 Definitions   
 
8.2.1  Adverse Event   
An adverse event  (AE) is any unfavorable or unintended event, physical or psychological, 
associated with a research study, which causes harm or injury to a research participant as 
a result of the participant’s involvement in a research study. The event can i nclude 
abnormal laboratory findings, symptoms, or disease associated with the research study. 
The event does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the research, any 
risk associated with the research, the research intervention, or the rese arch assessments.  
 
Adverse events may be the result of the interventions and interactions used in the research; 
the collection of identifiable private information in the research; an underlying disease, 
disorder, or condition of the subject; and/or other circumstances unrelated to the research 
or any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject.  
 
8.2.2   Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is any adverse experience occurring at any dose that results 
in any of the following o utcomes:  
• Results in death .  
• Is a life-threatening  adverse experience.  The term life -threatening in the 
definition of serious refers to an adverse event in which the subject was at risk 
of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an adverse e vent which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe .  
• Requires inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization .  Any adverse event leading to hospitalization or prolongation 
of hospitalization will be considered as Serious, UNLESS at least one of the 
following expectations is met:  
o The admission results in a hospital stay of less than 24 hours OR  
o The admission is pre -planned ( e.g., elective or scheduled surgery 
arranged prior to the start of the study) OR  
40 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  o The admission is not associated with an adverse event (e.g., social 
hospitalization for purposes of respite care.  
However it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospitalization may 
fulfill the criteria of “medically important” and as such may be reportable as a 
serious adverse event dependant on clinical judgment.  In addition where local 
regulatory authorities specifically require a more stringent definition, the local 
regulation takes precedent.  
• Results in persistent or significa nt disability/incapacity .  The definition of 
disability is a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life’s 
functions.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect .  
• Is an important medical event .  Important medical events that may not resul t 
death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious 
adverse experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the ou tcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood disease or disorders, or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient  hospitalization, or t he development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse . The development of a new cancer is always considered an 
important medical event.  
 
For the purpose of  this study the following events would not be considered adverse 
events and would not be recorded in the da tabase:  
• Abnormal laboratory findings considered associated to  the original disease  
 
8.2.3 Adverse Event Evaluation  
The investigator  or designee is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events  (both serious 
and non -serious)  observed by the clinical team  or reported by the subject which occur after 
the subject has signed the informed consent are fully recorded in  the subject’s medical 
records . Source documentation must be available to support al l adverse events.   
 
A laboratory test abnormality considered clinically relevant  (e.g., causing the subject to 
withdraw from the study, requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical manifestations, 
result in a delay or dose modification of study treatme nt, or judged relevant by the 
investigator),  should be reported as an adverse event.   
 
The investigator or sub -investigator (treating physician if applicable) will provide the 
following for all adverse events  (both serious and non -serious) : 
• Event term (as per CTCAE)  
• Description of the event  
• Date of onset and resolution  
• Expectedness of the toxicity  
• Grade of toxicity  
• Attribution of relatedness to the investigational agent - (this must be assigned 
41 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  by an investiga tor, sub -investigator, or treating physician)  
• Action taken as a result of the event , including but not limited to; no changes, dose 
interrupted, reduced, discontinued, etc. or action taken with regard to the event, i.e. 
no action, received conmed or other intervention, etc.  
• Outcome of event  
 
Descriptions and grading scales  found in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version  5.0 will be utilized for AE  reporting.  
 
An expected adverse event  is an event previously known or anticipated to result from 
participation in the research study or any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the 
subject. The event is usually listed in the Investigator Brochure, consent form or research 
protocol.  
 
An unexpected adverse event is an adverse event not previously known or anticipated to 
result from the research study or any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the 
subject.  
 
Attribution  is the relationship between an adverse event or serious a dverse event and the 
study drug.  Attribution will be assigned as follows:  
 
• Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study drug.  
• Probable – The AE is likely related  to the study drug.  
• Possible – The AE may be related  to the study drug.  
• Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related  to the study drug.  
• Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT  related  to the study drug.  
 
Protocol must specify if attribution is required for individual components of the treatment 
regimen or the treatmen t regimen as a whole.

10.0 CORRELATIVE  STUDIES  
 
10.1 Anti -Tumor Response by TILs and PD -L1 Expression  
 Assess anti -tumor response by measure of immune -infiltration  of cells to include, but not 
limited to, CD8, CD4, Treg  (FOXP3), NK cells (CD56) , MDSCs  into tumors , and PD -L1 
expression on tumor by multiplex immunofluorescence , flow cytometry  and 
immunohistochemistry on tumor biopsies an d serum samples at baseline, 12 weeks, and 
at progression.   As additional clinical and medical knowledge is learned from this study, 
additional analysis may be performed on pri or collected blood and tissue specimens.  
 
45 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  10.1.1  Background  
Immunotherapy such as nivolumab functions to modulate the immune microenvironment. 
CD8+, CD4+ T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), Natural Killer cells (NK), among others 
are important contributo rs both to the function of and resistance to targeted therapy and 
immunotherapy.48 The tumor microenvironment as well as the peripheral blood are 
dynamic and subject to change based on changes in tumor burden and therapy. There is 
need for prospective data demonstrating correlations between changes in peripheral blood 
and changes i n the tumor microenvironment. The goal of this study is to evaluate the 
hypothesis that changes in the type and behavior of immunomodulatory cells in the 
peripheral blood will reflect tumor burden and that such changes will impact tumor burden 
and response  while on therapy with nivolumab and talazoparib.  Additionally, this study 
will further investigate the preclinical findings that PARP inhibitor -mediated DNA damage 
has been shown to increase the immunogenicity of tumor cells by promoting T cell and NK 
cell infiltration .21  
 
10.1.2   Rationale for Analysis  
Identifying an immunomodulatory effect by analyzing tum or infiltrating lymphocytes 
circulating immune cells will help identify patients that would respond better to 
combination therapy and decrease tumor burden.  Please see section 14 for analysis plan.  
 
10.1.3  Collection of Specimens  
Tumor biopsies  (fresh frozen preferred ; however , FFPE acceptable if fresh froz en not 
available)  and peripheral  blood samples  (periphera l blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) ) will 
be collected prior to treatment (at time of enrollment, or archival FFPE tumor tissue) , at 12 
weeks (+/ - 1 week) at time of imaging, and at time of progression  will be collected.  See 
Section 11.0.  Blood samples  at each time point  will be drawn into two 8 ml heparinized 
(green top) tube s and two 4.5 mL Na Citrate tubes . PBMCs will be isolated by Ficoll 
separation method.  For fresh frozen tumor biopsies, submissio n of 3-4 grams of tissue 
(equivalent of 2 to 3 passes  of tissue , or 3 -4 core biopsies)  is preferred . For FFPE tissue, 
submission of  12-15 slides of 10µm thickness  preferred ; however, if unable to obtain, 12 
slides of 10µm thickness or what is able to be obtained is sufficient .  
 
10.1.4  Handling of Specimens  
De-identify the specimen using a code specific for this trial and transport the specimen to  
 lab at the Cleveland Clinic .

Flow cytometry,  TCR repertoire,  and single cell sequencing.  
 
10.2 Analysis of Longitudinal Genomic Evolution  
Assess longitudinal genomic evolution  by seque ncing at baseline, at 12 weeks, and at 
progression to evaluate DNA landscape and its correlation to response.   As additional 
clinical and medical knowledge is learned from this study, additional analysis may be 
performed on pr eviously  collected blood and t issue specimens.  
 
10.2.1  Background   
This study intends to characterize the activity of nivolumab in combination with 
talazoparib , with the aim of increasing the clinical benefit seen historically with single 
agent nivolumab. A key mechanistic hypothesis underpinning the combination is that 
increased DNA damage and cell death mediated by talazoparib will lead to enhanced 
immune prim ing and tumor immunogenicity, enabling a more effective anti -tumor immune 
response to be promoted by nivolumab. Given this hypothesis, one subgroup of patients 
likely to benefit from the combination will be those whose tumors are most sensitive to 
talazopa rib-mediated cell death and DNA damage.  Several biomarkers have the potential 
to identify patients with such increased sensitivity to talazoparib, one of these will be 
employed in the context of this study, the presence of pathogenic or likely pathogenic 
germline or somatic defects in a panel of DDR genes.46 Whole exome sequencing of tumor 
tissue prior to initiation of treatment, after treatment, and at progression will identify 
mutational load while on therapy.  The combination of talazoparib and nivolumab will 
increase DSBs and therefore increase l evels of fragmented DNA both in the tumor and 
PBMCs, likely results in changes in mutational burden.  This was shown in prior in vitro 
and in vivo studies.49  If patients who respond to combination therapy are shown to have a 
higher tumor mutational burden, this would confirm mechanistic action of this combination 
and could genera te hypothesis to further explore this combination in studies without 
mutations in BRCA1/2  or BRCA -ness and more cancer patients could potentially derive 
benefit from this combination therapy.

10.3.  Assessment of Patient Reported Outcomes for Adverse Events  
Assess patient reported outcomes for adverse events, as measured by PRO -CTCAE while 
on combination therapy at baseline and before  each cycle (every 4 weeks) of nivolumab 
for a period of 12 months.  
 
 
 
10.3.1  Background   
 
Immunotherapy has transformed treatment for melanoma. A better understanding of 
toxicities , long-term effects of immunotherapy , and effect on patient’s quality of life is 
needed, especially when introducing a second anti -cancer agent to immunotherapy.   
Patient-reported outcomes (PRO’s) can help show clinical benefit in reducing disease 
related symptoms, provide more accurate estimates of toxicity, help model treatment costs  
and improve symptom management.  PRO -CTCAE provides a systematic yet flexible tool 
for descriptive reporting of symptomatic treatment side effects in clinical trials. PRO -
CTCAE can be  used and reported in conjunction with the CTCAE reports gathered by 
clinicians. It provides additional information that is complementary to existing safety and 
tolerability assessments reported by clinicians using the CTCAE.  
 
10.3.2 Rationale for Analysis  
Discussed in Section 14.  
 
10.3.3 Collection of PRO -CTCAEs  
Surveys will be administered to patients beginning prior to treatment (baseline), and every 
12 weeks (at time of imaging and office visit) after treatment initiation.  
 
10.3.4 Handling of PRO -CTCAEs  
Surveys will be de -identified and sent electronically by s ecure email or postal mail to the 
study coordinator at the lead institution (address listed on first page of document) every 
three months until the end of the trial .  During the trial, the study coordinator at each 
institution will be responsible for maint aining the PRO -CTCAE surveys.

10.3.6 Methods  
Utilize PRO -CTCAE form designed by NCI. The National Cancer Institute's PRO -CTCAE 
measurement system was developed as a companion to the Common Terminology Crit eria 
for Adver se Events (CTCAE) . It is not intended to be used as a stand -alone patient -reported 
48 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  outcome . The current standard for grading and reporting all AEs in cancer clinical trials, 
including symptomatic AEs, is clinician grading using the CTCAE.   The PRO -CTCAE 
measurement system includes an item library of 124 discrete items representing 78 
symptomatic toxicities drawn from the CTCAE. As such, it provides a systematic yet 
flexible approach to capture symptomatic adverse events in trials of new cancer therapies.  
Custom PRO -CTCAE form is in Appendix 16. 7.  
10.4 Additional correlative analysis , including, but not limited to, analysis of STING 
pathway on prior collected tissue and blood specimens to evaluate effects on 
immunogenicity of combination therapy ; circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) 
measurements , and copy number variation to evaluate their association with 
response to treatment.   
10.4.1  Collection of Specimens  
Blood will be collected in four 10mL  Streck  tubes for cell free DNA analysis at 
each of the following time point s: before treatmen t initiation, at Cycle 2 Day 1  of 
nivolumab , at Cycle 3 Day 1 , and at progression.

13.2 Regulatory Considerations  
The study will be conducted in compliance with ICH guidelines and with all applicable 
federal (including 21 CFR parts 56 & 50 ), state or local laws.  
13.2.1  Written Informed consent  
Provision of written informed consent  must be obtained prior to any study -related 
procedures.  The Principal Investigator will ensure that the subject is given full and 
adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risks and benefits 
of the s tudy as well as the subject’s financial responsibility.  Subjects must also be notified 
that they are free to discontinue from the study at any time.  The subject should be given 
the opportunity to ask questions and be allowed time to consider the informatio n provided.  
The original, signed written Informed Consent Form must be kept with the Research Chart 
in conformance with the institution’s standard operating procedures. A copy of the signed 
written Informed Consent Form must be given to the subject.  Additionally, documentation 
of the consenting process should be located in the research chart.  
13.2.2  Subject Data Protection  
In accordance with the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), a 
subject must sign an authorizatio n to release medical information to the sponsor and/or 
allow the sponsor, a regulatory authority, or Institutional Review Board access to subject’s 
medical information that includes all hospital records relevant to the study, including 
subjects’ medical hi story.   
 
13.2. 3  Retention of records  
The Principal Investigator of The Case Comprehensive Cancer Center supervises the 
retention of all documentation of adverse events, records of study drug receipt and 
dispensation, and all IRB correspondence for as long as needed to comply with  local,

Investigator confirms destruction is permitted.  
 
13.2. 4  Audits and inspections  
Authorized representatives  of the sponsor, a regulatory authority, an Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) or an Institutional Review Board (IRB) may visit the  site to perform 
audits or inspections, including source data verification.  The purpose of an audit or 
inspection is to syste matically and independently examine all study -related activities and 
documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, 
analysed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), 

56 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  guidelin es of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), and any applicable 
regulatory requirements.   For multi -center studies, participating sites must inform the 
sponsor -investigator of pending audits.  
 
14.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
In this phase II, single arm, multi -institutional, open label trial in primary or re current , 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma patients who progressed on prior checkpoint inhibitor 
therapy with germline or somatic mutations in BRCA1/2  or BRCA -ness, we hypothesiz e 
that combination therapy with talazoparib and nivolumab will improve th e objective 
response rate from 10% to 3 0% with limited toxicity.   The primary objective is to estimate 
the clinical efficacy of nivolumab plus talazoparib in patients with unresectabl e or 
metastatic melanoma with BRCA1/2  or other DNA damage repair mutations (defined as 
BRCA -ness), as measured by objective response rate (ORR) every 12 weeks for a period 
of approximately 12 months.  This will be assessed by  best overall response (CR+PR) by 
RECIST v1.1.  Secondary objectives and their endpoints  include PFS defined as time from 
first dose of treatment until disease progression, as assessed by RECIST v1.1, treatment 
related adverse events  as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, anti-tumor activity as mea sured by  
irOR as assessed by  irRECIST , and irPFS as assessed by irRECIST.  
 
The historical ORR for anti -PD-1 re-challenge after progression is about 5% -10%.  ORR 
for re -challenge with combination anti -PD-1/anti -CTLA4 inhibition after progression is 
about 15% -20%.  The ORR for single agent PARP inhibitors in ovarian and breast cancer 
patients that harbor a mutation in BRCA  is at least 50%; about 72% and 62% (SOLO3 and 
EMBRACA  trials , respectively) . 
 
Sample Size Justification  
To test this hypothesis  with 90% power and a 2 -sided bino mial test with alpha of 0.10 , 
33 patients will need to be treated  to achi eve an improvement in ORR from 10% to 
30%.  With 10% of patien ts potentially not evaluable, 37  patients would need to be 
enrolled for a total of 33  patients th at are analyzable. Patients who are not evaluable 
are defined as patients who are consented and enrolled in the study, but who physically 
move  away that it would be too burdensome to follow up with institution, those who 
are lost to follow up defined as in dividuals  who enroll but do not receive treatment , 
imaging , and are not present at scheduled office visits . 
 
Bayesian Monitoring Rule for Safety  
We will use the method of Thall et al to monitor toxicity  in this study .50  Unacceptable 
toxicity  observed at the time the 11th patient has received three cycles of therapy  is 
defined for this protocol as CTCAE Grade 3 -4 non -hematological toxicities, excludin g 
fatigue and endocrinopathies, which  fail to resolve to Grade 1 despite  appropriate 
supportive care .  A point mass of 0.65 was used as target toxicity rate.  Beta (0.65, 0.35) 
was used as non -informative prior distributions for toxicity rate. Total accrual will be 33 
patients. Patients will be monitored in cohorts of 11, star ting from the 11th patients. The 
trial will stop early if an excessive toxicity rate is observed. Formally, stop the trial early 
if Pr(Toxicity rate > 65%|data) > 0.9, i.e.  we will stop the trial early if the posterior 
probability of toxicity rate being hi gher than 65% given data is higher than 0.9. Table 1 
57 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  and 2 summarize the stopping boundaries for toxicity and operating characteristics based 
on the stopping rules.  
 
Table 1. Summary of early stopping boundaries in cohorts of 11 for toxicity. E.g. If 9 or more 
patients experienced toxicity out of the first 11 patients, the trial will stop early; similarly, if 17 
or more out of the first 22 patients experienced toxicity, the trial will stop early for safety.  
Stop Early if #Toxicities Observed ≥  9 17 
Total #Patients Treated  11 22 
 
Table 2. Summary of operating characteristics based on 10,000 simulations using stopping 
boundaries in table 1. For example, if the true toxicity rate  is 0.65, the probability of early 
stopping is 0. 26; if the true toxicity rate is 0.8, the probability of early stopping is 0. 79.

Interim Analysis  
No planned interim analysis will be performed due to expected accrual rate for this 
study.  
 
Analysis Plan  
All baseline patient demographics and clinical characteristics will be summarized by 
mean/standard deviations and count/frequency for continuous and categorical variables 
respectively. All analyses will be completed as intent to treat.  
 
Patients who receive at least one dose  of treatment with nivoluma b and talazoparib will 
contribute to the efficacy analysis.  Any subject who receives at least one dose of 
treatment on this prot ocol is evaluable for toxicity.  Proportion of patients with overall 
response will be estimated with corresponding 95% confidence interval. PFS  and irPFS  
curves will be based on the Kaplan -Meier method.  Overall response by irRECIST will 
be estimated as a proportion with corresponding 95% confidence interval.   
 
All subjects will be included in the safety analysis, with toxicities graded according to 
NCI CTCAE v5.0. Incidence tables will be generated to sum marize incidence of 
patients reporting at least one episode of each specific adverse event, incidence of 
adverse events causing withdrawals and incidence of serious adverse events. Listing of 
adverse events by patients will include the time to onset, the d uration of each event, the 
severity of each event, and the relationship of the event to study therapy, whether it was 
a serious event, and whether it caused withdrawal.  
 
Correlative Studies and Analysis Plan  
Correlative studies include , but are not limited to : assessing anti -tumor response  by 
measure of immune -infiltration of CD8, CD4, Treg (FOXP3), NK cells (CD56) into 
58 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  tumors  by flow cytometry, and PD -L1 expression on tumor by immunohistochemistry  
performed on  tumor biopsies at baseline,  12 weeks, a nd at progression ; and assessing 
total somatic mutation burden by sequencing at baseline,  12 weeks, and at progression 
to evaluate DNA landscape and its correlation to response.   These studies will be 
performed on all patients enrolled in the study, unless  deemed not evaluable.  
Parametric assumptions will be assessed using Shapiro -Wilk statistics and qqplots and 
non-parametric alternatives will be considered when necessary.   Tumor infiltrating 
lymphocyte s (CD8, CD4, Treg, NK cells),  total mutational burden , and PD -L1 
expression  will be assessed using a mixed model approach, adjusting for repeated 
measurements over time and response (yes/no). If there are differences by time, 
pairwise contrasts will be utilized to assess for specific differences at various t ime 
points, adjusting for multiple comparisons using the Tukey method.    
 
The final c orrelative  objective of patient reported adverse events (PRO -CTCAE) will 
be summarized as percentages and frequencies , as described above in analysis plan . 
 
Although exploratory,  for 33 evaluable patients, we will be able to detect moderate 
effect sizes of 0.44 for all correlati ve outcomes listed above, with 90% power and two -
sided level of significance of 0.10 .  
 
Accrual  
About 225  primary or recurrent metastatic or unresectable melanoma patients  are seen 
annually at seven  institutions  in the Regional Melanoma Translational Research 
Consortium (RMTRC), which include:  Cleveland Clinic, University Hospi tals, 
MetroHealth, University of  Pittsburgh Medical Center, Roswell Park, Penn State, and 
Ohio State University. About 50 patients per year would meet eligibility criteria.  Of 
these, about half are expected to enroll .  The estimate annual accrual rate is 25 patients 
per year. At t his ra te, the accrual goal of 37  patients is anticipated to be completed 
within two years.

16.0 APPENDIX  
16.1 RECIST 1.1 Criteria  
 
The determination of antitumor efficacy during this study will be based on objective tumor 
assessments made according to the RECIST system of unidimensional evaluation.  
Adapted from E.A. Eisenhauer, et al. New response evaluation criteria in solid tumours : 
Revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1). European Journal of Cancer 45 (2009) 228 –
247.51 
 
Measurability of Tumor Lesions  
At baseline, individual tumor lesions will be categorized by the investigator as either 
measurable or non -measurable by the RECIST criteria as described below.  
 
Measurable:  
 
Tumor lesion:  Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
 
10 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm);  
 
10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable).  
 
Malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically enlarged and me asurable, a lymph 
node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis 
will be measured and followed.  
 
Non-Measurable: All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with 
 10 mm to <15 mm short axis) as well as truly non-
measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non -measurable include: leptom eningeal 
disease, ascites, p leural or pericardial effusion, inflammato ry breast disease, lymphangitic 
involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by 
physical exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.  
 
NOTE: If measurable diseas e is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be 
confirmed by cytology/histology.  
 
Recording Tumor Measurements  
 
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total 
representative of all involved orga ns should be identified as target lesions and measured and 
recorded at baseline and at the stipulated intervals during treatment. Target lesions should be 
64 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  selected on the basis of their size (lesion with the longest diameters) and their suitability for 
accurate repetitive measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically).  
 
The longest diameter will be recorded for each target lesion. The sum of the longest diameter 
for all target lesions will be calculated and recorded as the baseline sum longest d iameter to 
be used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable 
dimension of the disease during treatment. All measurements should be performed using a 
caliper or ruler and should be recorded in metric notation in cen timeters.  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should 
also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and these lesions should be 
followed as “present” or “absent.”  
 
Techniques for Assessing M easurable Disease  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at screening and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by clinical (physical) examina tion when both methods have been used 
to assess the antitumor effect of a treatment.  
 
Definitions of Tumor Response  
 
Target Lesions  
 
Complete response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Any 
pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to 
<10 mm.  
 
Partial response (PR) is defined as a ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of 
the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions.  
 
Progressive disease (PD) is defined as a ≥ 20% increase in the sum of the longest dimensions 
of the target lesions taking as a reference the smallest sum of the longest dimensions  recorded 
since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions. In addition to the 
relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 
mm.  
 
Stable disease (SD) is defined as neither sufficient sh rinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD taking as a reference the smallest sum of the longest dimensions 
since the treatment started.  
 
Non-Target Lesions  
 
Complete response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all non -target lesions. All lymph 
nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
Non-CR/Non -PD is defined as a persistence of ≥ 1 non -target lesions.  
 
Progressive disease (PD) is defined as unequivocal progr ession of existing non -target  
lesions, or the appearance of ≥ 1 new lesion.  
65 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable dis ease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease and progressive disease.  
 
Confirmation of Tumor Response  
To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements in patients with 
responding tumors must be confirmed by repe at studies that should be performed  
4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. In the case of SD, follow -up 
measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum 
interval of 8 weeks.  
 
Determination of Tumor Response by the RECIST Criteria  
When both target and non -target lesions are present, individual assessments will be recorded 
separately. Determination of tumor response at each assessment is summarized in the 
following table.  
 
Response Evaluation Criteri a in Solid Tumors  
 
Determination of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest sum on study). For CR and PR, the patient’s best response assignment will 
depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria. CR and PR 
must be confirmed by 2 measurements at least 4 weeks apart. In the case of SD, follow 
up measurements must  have met the SD criteria at least once after start of the treatment at 
a minimum interval of 6 weeks.  
 
16.2 Immune -related Response Criteria Derived From RECIST  v1.1 (irRECIST)  

66 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023   
Increasing clinical experience indicates that traditional response criteria m ay not be 
sufficient to fully characterize activity in this new era of targeted therapies and/or 
biologics.  
 
This is particularly true for immunotherapeutic agents such as anti -CTLA4 and anti -PD-
1\anti PD -L1 antibodies which exert the anti -tumor activity b y augmenting activation and  
proliferation of T -cells, thus leading to tumor infiltration by T -cells and tumor regression 
rather than direct cytotoxic effects.52,53  Clinical observations of patients with  advanced 
melanoma treated with ipilimumab, for example, suggested that conventional response 
assessment criteria such as Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and 
World Health Organization (WHO) criteria are not sufficient to fully characterize 
patterns of tumor response to immunotherapy because tumors treated with  
immunotherapeutic agents may show additional  response patterns that are not described 
in these conventional criteria.54,55 
 
Furthermore, the conventional tumor as sessment criteria (RECIST and WHO criteria) 
have been reported as not capturing the existence of a subset of patients who have an OS 
similar to those who have experienced CR or PR but were flagged as PD by WHO 
criteria.54,55 
 
On these grounds, a tumor assessment system has been developed that incorporates these 
delayed or flare -type responses into the RECIST v1.1 ( irRECIST).56 
 
For irRECIST, with the exception of a complete response assessment, only target and 
new measurable lesions are taken into account.  
 
In contrast to R ECIST v1.1, the irRECIST:  
• Requires confirmation of both progression and response by imaging at least 4 
weeks  from the date first documented, and  
 
• Does not necessarily score the appearance of new lesions as progressive disease if 
the sum of lesion diameters  of target lesions (minimum of 10 mm per lesion, 
maximum  of 5 target lesions, maximum of 2 per organ) and measurable new 
lesions does not increase by ≥20%.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified  and reported target lesion(s) at baseline and throughout the study.  
 
irRECIST responses are defined as follows:  
 
• Overall immune -related complete response (irCR): Complete disappearance of 
all lesions (whether measurable or not) and no new lesions. All measurable lymph 
nodes also must have a reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
 
67 
CASE2619 Protocol v5 
05/09/2023  • Overall immune -related partial response (irPR): Sum of the diameters (longest 
for non -nodal lesions, shortest for nodal lesions) of target and new measurable 
lesions decreases ≥30%. 
 
• Overall immune -related stable disease (irSD): Sum of the diameters (longest 
for non -nodal lesions, shortest for nodal lesions) of target and new measurable 
lesions does not meet criteria for irCR or irPR (compared to baseline), or 
immune -related progres sive disease (irPD, compared to nadir).  
 
• Overall immune -related progressive disease (irPD): Sum of the diameters 
(longest for non -nodal lesions, shortest for nodal lesions) of target and new 
measurable lesions increases ≥20% (compared to nadir), confirmed by a repeat, 
consecutive observation at least 4 weeks from the date first documented.  
 
New measurable lesions: Incorporated into tumor burden (i .e., added to the target lesion 
measurements). A lymph node has to be ≥15 mm in short axis to be a measurable ne w 
lesion and its short axis measurement is included in the sum. Up to 2 new lesions per 
organ and up to 5 new lesions in total can be added to the measurements.  
 
New non -measurable lesions: Do not define progression but preclude irCR.  
 
Overall responses derived from changes in target, non -target, and new lesions are 
outlined in the following table.

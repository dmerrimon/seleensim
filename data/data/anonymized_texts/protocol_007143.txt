This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according to US 
and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International 
Confe rence on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research 
policies and procedures.  
 
2.0 BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Disease  
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer related mortality in the US.  Radiation therapy 
is a main t reatment modality for lung cancer: for resectable tumors, radiation can be given pre -
operatively or post -operatively to improve local tumor control and outcomes; for unresectable tumors, 
radiation can be given as definitive treatment for the cancer, either  alone or in combination with 
chemotherapy.   
 
Local recurrence remains a significant  cause of treatment failure in lung cancer.  For stage III 
lung cancer treated with definitive chemoradiation, local failure rates range from 30% to 50% [1, 2].  At 
the time of lung cancer recurrence, patients often present as a heterogeneous group, with a mixture of 
local as well as systemic disease, and varying time intervals to recurrence.  Outcomes are generally poor 
with recurrence, however, various treatments are often given to either prolong life or palliate symptoms.  
Depending on specific patient characteristics such as age , stage, histology, and performance status, 
aggressive treatments can sometimes be pursued with superior outcomes to supportive care alone.   
 
External beam radiation is often given to  patients with recurrent lung cancer  to provide local 
tumor control and pal liate symptoms.  This can be challenging in patients who have previously received

normal tissue tolerances, which is the standard of care radiatio n dose that is felt to be safe for specific 
organs in the body.  Typically, for patients who have already received thoracic radiation, many organs in 
the area have already received a significant radiation dose.  Therefore, it is often assumed that thoracic  
radiation cannot be repeated.  Even when repeat radiation is given, it is typically for palliative doses, due 
to concerns about toxicity if higher radiation doses were attempted, as well as concerns over patient life 
expectancy  [3].   
 
Recent technological advances in radiation therapy and imaging have led to more interest  and 
more feasibility  in the role of repeat radiation for a select group of recurrent cancer patients.  For 
patients with symptomatic locally recurrent tumors, or patients with good systemic disease control but 
persistent or progressive local disease, repeat radiation with moderately high radiation doses can provide 
lasting tumor control and symptom palliation.  Multiple clinical series have been published on thoracic 
re-irradiation, showing safety and efficacy [4-10]. However, the series are typically retrospective or 
prospective registry trials, with no prospective guidelines in terms of radiation dose limits for normal 
organs.   Radiation doses and fractionation varies widely.  Toxicity and efficacy information are often 
incomplete.  Table 1 summari zes some of the best  published clinical data on repeat irradiation in the 
thorax.  As systemic treatments improve for lung cancer, local control will also become more critical for 
this patient population, and prospective guidelines to safely deliver repeat radiation must be d eveloped.

In addition to recurrent lung cance rs, other malignancies can also result in the need for repeat 
irradiation of the chest.  For example, recurrent thymomas that were previously treated with radiation 
therapy can still have a relatively long disease course.  In unresectable localized recurre nces that show 
no evidence of dissemination, in patients with good performance status and life expectancy, it would be 
reasonable to consider repeat radiation.  Patients with one thoracic cancer can also develop a second 
primary malignancy in the chest (i. e. esophageal cancer that was treated with radiation years ago, now 
with lung cancer ; or breast cancer treated previously, now with lung cancer ).  Since radiation planning is 
guided by normal organ dose limits, this patient population would follow similar radiation guidelines as 
recurrent lung cancer patients, in terms of normal organ radiation constraints.   
 
  
2.2 Rationale for Use of Proton Radiation   
Proton radiation has unique physical properties compared with photon -based radiation due to the 
Bragg peak [11].  For the more widely available photon -based radiation, th e radiation beams enter the

v. 6/18/14  revised 5/21/15  patient’s body, deposits energy and causes tissue damage, and exists through the body on the other side.  
In comparison, proton radiation beams enter a patient’s body, deposits a relatively small amount of 
energy along the path,  until the beam weakens to the point when it deposits all of its energy immediately 
before the proton particles come to rest.  This is called the Bragg peak.  This physical characteristic of 
proton therapy has the potential for less normal tissue exposure to radiation, and therefore less toxicity.  
Multiple publications have shown that proton radiation have superior normal tissue sparing compared 
with photon -based radiation [12-14].       
 
2.3 Clinical Data to Date  
Proton radiation has been increasingly used for treating lung and other thoracic malignancies in the 
recent years, with multiple published patient series showing safety and efficacy [15-17].  Multiple 
clinical series have also been published on thoracic re -irradiation, showing safety and efficacy [4-7]. 
However, the series are typically retrospective or prospective registry trials, with no prospective 
guidelines in terms of radiation dose limits for normal organs.  Radiation doses and fractionation varies 
widely.  Toxicity and eff icacy information are often incomplete.   
 
2.4 Risks/Benefits  
The benefit for patients enrolled in this trial is to receive proton radiation treatment to the thorax for 
recurrent tumors, which adheres to strict radiation normal organ dose limits that has been developed 
after thorough literature review and multiple radiation oncology specialists.   
 
The potential harm for patients enrolled in this trial is the radiation toxicity related to re -irradiation.

thoracic cancer who will be receiving radiotherapy to at least BED 2Gy 60 Gy .  Subjects will undergo an 
informed con sent process in accordance with GCP. Informed consent will be obtained prior to the 
performance of any screening procedures.  
 
6.0 SUBJECT REGISTRATION  
  
Subjects will be registered by the FHCRC/UW Study Coordinator and entered into the Protocol Accrual 
Trackin g System (PATS).  Information regarding the PATS system is available at 
http://www.cancerconsortiumorg/rto/protocol_office/pats/ . A complete , signed , study consent and 
HIPAA consent a re required for registration.  
 
 
7.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
All patients will receive radiation treatment per standard of care , adhering to  the normal organ radiation 
dose constraints outlined in this protocol .  The only additional procedure related to this protocol i s 
informed consent at enrollment.   
 
The standard treatment outline for patients receiving radiation treatment, which also applies to patients 
on this protocol, begins with an initial consultation, including history and physical.  Patients’ prior 
radiation  records will be obtained and reviewed.  If patients are eligible and consent to repeat irradiation, 
they are scheduled for a radiation simulation scan, to be used for radiation treatment planning.  
Physicians will delineate the target tumor volume as well  as normal organs to be protected in the region.  
A radiation plan will be generated that meets the normal organ dose limits outlined in this protocol.  The 
plan undergoes quality assurance checks, and patients then start treatment.  During treatment, pati ents 
are seen at least once weekly by the physician to assess for toxicity.  After completion of radiation, 
patients are seen typically 3 months post -treatment with CT chest to assess for treatment response and 
toxicity.  Additional imaging or follow up vi sits may take place per routine medical standard of care.  
Research staff will review clinical  record  at 3 months post -treatment .  See Table 1 below for summary.

7.1 Radiation Treatment Parameters  
7.1.1 Localization, Simulation, and Immobilization  
 
Body cradle  or similar immobilization device(s) must be utilized.  A treatment planning CT scan is 
mandatory. CT scan thickness should be 0.5 cm or smaller  (preferably ≤0.3 cm) through the treatment 
volume. Intravenous contrast is recommended in  patients who do not have a contraindication to it. MRI 
and/or PET scans with image fusion also  may be helpful in treatment planning, particularly if these 
scans can be performed with the  same immobilization device as was used for the planning CT scan.   4D 
CT scan with respiratory motion tracking is strongly preferred for lung tumors.  Any tumors moving 
more than 1 cm with respiration must be considered for  motion management for ra diation treatment, 
which can include but not limited to: abdominal compression, respiratory gating,  and active breathing 
control.  These are all standard of care for lung radiation treatment.   
 
7.1.2 Volume Definitions  
 
Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) : This is the reg ion of interest that is known to contain gross  cancer. This 
will include all gross tumor as based upon the planning CT scan. This also may  include areas that appear 
“normal” by the planning CT scan but are known to harbor cancer  based on the MRI, PET, phys ical 
examination, endoscopy, etc.  
Clinical  Tumor Volume (C TV): The CTV is defined to be the GTV plus a margin as  appropriate to 
account for microscopic tumor extension.  The exact CTV margin to be used is at the discretion of the 
treating physician, and ca n be as low as 0 mm if microscopic extension is not felt to be of concern in a 
particular patient situation.   
Internal Target Volume (ITV): If 4D CT scans are used to assess for breathing motion, the ITV will be 
used to encompass the CTV and all respirato ry motion.  
Planning Tumor Volume ( PTV ): This includes the CTV  (or ITV if appropriate)  plus a margin to 
compensate for various uncertainties, such as  systematic treatment setup variables, organ motion  
(especially with respiratory motion) , and organ displace ment . A minimum of 5 mm around the C TV is 
required in all directions, except where the  CTV is immediately adjacent to a critical organ such as the 
spinal cord  (in which case, the margin from  CTV to PTV may be as small as 1 mm).

v. 6/18/14  revised 5/21/15  7.1.3 Treatment Planning Dose Co nstraints  
 
 A composite radiation plan that includes the prior thoracic radiation must be generated.  
 Minimum PTV dose should be 90% of the prescription dose and 95% of the PTV  should  receive 
the prescription dose, unless PTV overlaps with a critical normal organ.  In that case, the portion 
of PTV not overlapping with the critical organ should meet the constraint above.  Min PTV dose 
<80% will be a major violation, volume of PTV receiving prescription dose <90% will be a 
major violation.   
 Minimum prescriptio n dose to PTV must be at least BED 2Gy 60 Gy. 
 Spinal c ord: max point dose 50 Gy (<0.03 cc) or BED equivalent (BED 2Gy 83 Gy) from proton 
radiation plan.  Composite  maximum spinal cord dose must not exceed BED 2Gy 90 Gy .  For 
patients who received radiation > 3 years prior, the cord constraint can be increased with PI 
approval.   
 Normal lung: mean dose < 20 Gy and volume receiving 20 Gy (V20)  < 35% for proton radiation 
plan.   
 Esophagus:  mean dose <34 Gy and max dose < 66 Gy for proton plan.  Composite  max poin t 
dose <  BED 2Gy 140 Gy . 
 Heart: mean d ose < 40 Gy and max dose < 66  Gy for proton plan.  Composite  max point dose <  
BED 2Gy 140 Gy . 
 
7.1.4 Treatment delivery  
 
All patients will have daily imaging guidance for setup and positioning prior to proton radiation 
deliver y.  This is typically done with port films.  
 
7.1.5 R.T. Qua lity Assurance Reviews  
 
All patients treated on this protocol will undergo standard review in the Department of Radiation 
Oncology.  At least two physician s will review the patient history, imaging find ings, tumor contours, 
and radiation plan.   
 
7.1.6 Radiation Toxicity  
 
Toxicity will be graded based on CTCAE 4.0.  Grade two and above adverse events will be recorded .in 
a Redcap  database.   The AE ’s will be followed for three months post -treatment.  
 
7.2 Criteria fo r Removal/Withdrawal from Treatment  
Patients will be withdrawn from treatment if their clinical conditions decline so they are no longer able 
to tolerate proton radiation, or are unlikely to clinically benefit from further therapy.  
 
Patients will still rec eive follow up care per standard of care even if they withdraw from the study.  If a 
subject withdraws consent to participate in the study or aspects of the study, attempts will be made to 
obtain permission to record at least survival data up to 6 months p ost-treatment.   
 
8.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
 
Oversight for this study at the SCCA and UWMC will be provided by the Principal Investigator with 
delegation of appropriate responsibilities to sub -investigators and designated study personnel.  They will 
ensure all entry criteria are met prior to the initiation of the protocol and all study procedures and 
reporting of adverse events are performed according to the IRB-approved protocol.

8.1 Early Stopping Rules  
In the event of a grade 5 event  occurring within  ≤ 30 days after the end of treatment , there will be a 
temporary cessation in patient enrollment for event review   If the event is defined as possibly, probably, 
or definitely related to treatment (per CTCAE, v.4.0), early stopping of this trial will occu r permanently .   
All Grade 3 and 4 AE’s will be immediately monitored and reviewed by PI.   
 
8.2 Interim Data Review  
Interim reports with statistical analyses will be prepared twice per y ear until the initial treatment results 
have been presented or published.  In general, the interim reports will contain the  following information:  
 Patient accrual rate with a projected completion date (while the study is still accruing)  
 Total patients accrued  
 Frequencies and severity of  adverse events  
 Compliance rates of treatm ent delivery  
 
 
9.0 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
 
9.1 Efficacy Parameters  
Tumor response will be assessed using the RECIST criteria.   
 
For tumors targeted by radiation:  
 Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions  
 Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% de crease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum LD  
 Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatmen t started  
 Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking 
as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or 
more new lesions  
 
Patients with a global deteriorat ion of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without 
objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having “symptomatic 
deterioration”. Every effort will  be made to document the objective progression even afte r 
discontinuation of treatment.  
 
 
9.2 Method and Timing  
Tumors will be measured on axial CT chest images.  The radiation treatment planning scan will be used 
as baseline.  The 3 -months post -treatment scan will be used for comparison.   
 
9.3 Toxicity Profile  
Toxici ty will be measured by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  version 
4.0.

10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
The primary objective of this protocol is to provide a preliminary evaluation of the safety and efficacy of 
re-irradiation with proton beam radiotherapy in patients with recurrent thoracic cancer.  Ideally this 
therapy should have a grade 3 toxicity rate of < 25% and a local control rate of > 80%.  
 
Twenty patients will be enrolled.   If 7 or more of the 20 patients experience grade  3 toxicity, then we 
would be at least 80% confident that the true toxicity rate exceeds 25%; conversely, if 3 or fewer of the 
20 patients experience grade 3 toxicity, then we would be at least 80% confident that the true toxicity 
rate is less than 25%.   An intermediate result, 4 -6 patients with grade 3 toxicity, would be regarded as 
inconclusive.  
 
With regard to efficacy, if the therapy results in 14 or fewer of the 20 patients with local tumor control, 
then we would be at least 80% confident that the tru e local control rate is less than 80%; conversely, if 
18 or more of the patients have local tumor control, then we would be at least 80% confident that the 
true local control rate exceeds 80%.  An intermediate result, 15 -17 patients with local tumor contro l, 
would be regarded as inconclusive.  
 
An early stopping rule will be imposed for grade 5 adverse events, and the protocol will stop should any 
patients experience a grade 5 AE as described in Section 8.1.   If the true rate of grade 5 AE is 10%, then 
there is an 88% chance that this stopping rule will be triggered.  
 
 
11.0 DATA MANAGEMENT/CONFIDENTIALITY  
 
The investigator will ensure that data collected conform to all established guidelines.  Each subject is 
assigned a unique patient number to assure subject conf identiality.  Subjects will not be referred to by 
this number, by name, or by any other individual identifier in any publication or external presentation.  
The licensed medical records department, affiliated with the institution where the subject receives 
medical care, maintains all original inpatient and outpatient chart documents.  
 
Subject research files are stored in a secure place (or database).  Access is restricted to authorized 
personnel.

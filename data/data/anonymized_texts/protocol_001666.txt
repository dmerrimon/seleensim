-GE CONFIDENTIAL - 4.0 INTRODUCTION  
4.1 Background  
Recent ly, preclinical and clinical studies have been perfo rmed on the  stimulation  of the 
vagus nerve . Most studies have utilized implanted vagus nerve stimulators (VNS; 
implanted at the cervical vagus position). Several studies have shown promise in using 
the stimulator to modulate signaling along neuro- immune pathways/reflexes. Precli nical 
studies have shown that one such reflex is dependent on a vagus nerve signal that reaches the spleen, alter s concentration of norepinephrine and acetylcholine, and modulates the 
release and production of cytokines by resident macrophages.
1,2 One of the main 
cytokines under regulation by this reflex is tumor necrosis factor ( TNF). Interestingly, 
TNF is the target of biologic therapies that inhibit TNF signaling in rheumatoid arthritis 
([RA] and other chronic inflammatory disease) patients.3 In RA, symptomatic relief can 
be achieved in up to 50%  of patients using anti -TNF  biologics, and recently a first -of-its-
kind study has shown that VNS significantly inhibited TNF production for up to 84 days 
in a pilot study in RA patients (with a concomitant decrease in disease severity as 
measured by standardized clinical composite scores).3 
 
Based on the initial success of using VNS in a bioelectronic medicine (i.e. , use of nerve 
stimulators to effect specific molecular and/or drug target ); 2,4 several groups are 
targeting other (non- splenic) organs, disease applications, and drug target s. In prior 
literature, the brain -liver connection is well established and includes vagal sensory neural 
innervation.5 The central nervous system (CNS) is known to control glucoregulatory 
response to both hype r- and hypoglycemia.5-8 However, past VNS experiments measuring 
effects o f metabolic processes have shown complex and contrary results.9-12 This is in 
part due to the complexity of the innervation of the liver (i.e. , combine d afferent and 
efferent innervation with different function depending on innervation site with the liver), 
and the inability of implants to stimulate specific neurons (having specific function) within nerves.  
 
Recently, GE has published results on the use of focused, pulsed ultrasound to stimulate 
small sub -sets of neurons within organs.
13,14 This data includes stimulation of sub -organ 
sites within the liver (surrounding the porta hepatis and sensory vagal innervation points) 
and prevention or reversal in several models of hyperglycemia (including LPS -induced 
hyperglycemia and Fatty Zucker Diabetes/Obesity models). Unlike VNS studies, the precision stimulus has allowed for stimulation of a specific liver -hypothalamic pathway, 
mapping of the nerve modulation effect, and daily stimulation of the liver site for long 
term (weeks -month) prevention of diabetes symptoms in several diabetes and obesity 
models.

-GE CONFIDENTIAL - For this study, the commercially available ultrasound device, GE General Electric 
LOG IQ E10 and C16 Probe , will be used to perform hepatic ultrasound insoni fication in 
patients  with T2DM on metformin monotherapy . This device and probe have previously 
received IRB approval to perform splenic insonification and measure inflammatory 
markers f rom blood samples in healthy human subjects . Additionally, IRB approval has 
previously been received to perform liver insonification in healthy subjects and subjects with pre -diabetes . In clinical feasibility studies, the system is set to an elastography 
imaging mode that is utilized within the commercial product for hepatic elastography 
testing. A pulsed ultrasound stimulus like those utilized in this standard imaging 
procedure will be applied to the liver (at the porta hepatis region) in this study. Pleas e 
refer to the User’s Manuals for further information on the device  and the customized 
instructions  for the pulsed insonification in the elastography setting.  
4.2 Rationale for the Proposed Study  
The primary outcome to determine whether diagnostic -level ultrasound to the liver  has a 
biological effect , which  is measured as a statistically significant change in the  primary 
and secondary markers listed within this protocol (including measures of glucose 
utilization, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and glucoregulation).  
4.3 Summary of Pre -Clinical /Clinical Studies  
A clinical  feasibility  study has recently been completed  that observes the biological 
effects of ultrasound insonification of the spleen . It is performed in healthy subjects after 
insonification of the spleen with pulsed ultrasound using the elastography setting within 
the commercial LOGIQ E10 with C1 -6 probe.  This study is being conducted to determine 
if insonification has a biological ef fect on inflammation markers. This study is being 
performed based on past GE data showing that the cholinergic anti -inflammatory 
pathway can be activated by pulsed ultrasound in the spleen.
13 
Additional, pre -clinical studies from GE have demonstrated that pulsed ultrasound 
focused on specific locations in the liver (i.e. porta hepatis) modifies glucose regulation 
and insulin sensing and may have beneficial effects in rodent models of diabetes and 
obesity.13,14 This feasibility study is designed to test whether insonification at the liver 
site has a biological effect on measures of glucose utilization, glucose tolerance, insulin 
sensitivity, and glucoregulation.  
4.4 Summary of K nown and Potent ial Risks and B enefits  
Although subjects participating in this study will not directly benefit, the knowledge 
gained may help other people in  the future by leading to changes in clinical care. Given 
the study goal of determining whether insonification at t he liver site has a biological 
effect on measures of glucose utilization, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and glucoregulat ion, this study may lead to better methods for treat ment.  
The General Electric LOGIQ E 10 ultrasound pulsed doppler imaging system and C1‐6‐D 
XDclear abdominal , curvilinear probe are FDA cleared ( K173555) with the indication for 
GE Research

Version 4.0 24Sep2020  
-GE CONFIDENTIAL - ultrasound evaluation of fetal,  abdominal, pediatric, small organ (breast, testes, thyroid), 
neonatal cephalic, adul t cephalic, cardiac (pediatric and adult), peripheral vascular, 
musculoskeletal conventional and superficial, urology (including prostate), transrectal, 
transvaginal, transesophageal, and intraoperative (abdominal, thoracic,  and vascular).  
Since the ultras ound device will be used in  this study to achieve organ‐specific biological 
effects, it is  being used off‐label on this study, and therefore, is considered 
investigational. Although its use in this  study is considered investigational, its use is 
considered  to constitute minimal risk given that it will be  operated within the confines of 
its FDA‐cleared equipment parameters and below the guidelines established by the FDA 
for ultrasound equipment. The FDA guidelines indicate that the  derated global maximum 
acoustic output should not exceed preamendment acoustic output exposure  levels. In the 
case of diagnostic ultrasound, the global maximum derated spatial‐peak temporal‐average  
intensity (ISPTA –  the highest intensity measured at any point in the ultrasound bea m 
averaged over the pulse repetition period) is ≤  720 mW/cm2 with either the global 
maximum mechanical index being ≤  1.9 or the global maximum derated spatial‐peak 
pulse‐average intensity (ISPPA – the highest intensity  measured at any point in the 
ultrasound beam averaged over the temporal duration of the pulse) being  ≤ 190 W/cm2 
(not including ophthalmic use). These FDA guideline values are significantly higher than 
the maximum spatial‐peak temporal‐average intensity to be delivered on this study.  
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that this clinical study is a 
nonsignificant risk (NSR) device study, because it does not meet the definition of a 
significant risk (SR device under $812.3(m) of the Investigational Device Exemption 
(IDE) regul ation (21 CFR 812).  An NSR study is  subject to the abbreviated requirements 
as described in § 812.2(b) of the IDE regulations . 
4.5 Rationale for Treatment and  Dose  
Insonifications will be performed on three consecutive days (Days 15, 16 and 17) for 15 
minutes of ultrasound push- pulse waveform exposure on each day for a total of 45 
minutes. Fifteen (15)  minutes was chosen as a typical procedure time for imaging, 
specifically elastography imaging sessions in clinical practice. The 15 -minute dose will 
be targeted to the porta hepatis by the ultrasonographer, and the ultrasonographer may 
choose to perform breath holds during the procedure in order to locate and target the 
ultrasound pushpulses on the porta hepatis. If breath holds are utilized during tar geting, 
the subject will be allowed 2 -3 minutes between breath holds (and this waiting period 
will not count toward the 15- minute dose or ultrasound duration).

Sampling and Assessment:  
Safety assessments will occur throughout the duration of the study, including monitoring 
of adverse device effects (ADEs) , clinical laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, and 
urinalysis), vital signs measurements (blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, and 
aural temperature), 12 -lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examinations.  
Unscheduled Outpatient Visits:  
Additional , unscheduled outpatient visits may occur, in case the CGMS might get 
dislodged and the sensor would need to be re -inserted  by clinic staff.   
6.3 Rationale  for Study Design  and Endpoints  
The aim of this exploratory, pilot study is to determine  the effect of hepatic ultrasound 
insonification on insulin sensitivity, glycemic , metabolic and lipid parameters, as well as 
on various biomarkers  in subjects  with T2DM.  
Subjects with T2DM will participate in the study, as these subjects are an important target population. These subjects are characterized by relative rather than absolute insulin deficiency in association with vari able degrees of insulin resistance.  
Subjects on metformin therapy will continue the stable drug dose throughout the entire 
study.  
Subjects will be supplied with a CGMS to ensure that blood glucose levels are monitored 
closely.  CGM as assessment has been chosen to assess the ultrasound insonification 
effects with a standardized method for efficacy .  As assessment of insulin secretion and 
resistance,  an OGTT and H -E clamp will be performed.  
Whole -body insulin sensitivity will be assesse d with the  2-step H -E clamp procedure. 
The use of two- stepped IV insulin infusions is used in co mbination  with IV stable isotope 
labeled glucose infusion to  allow the differentiation between hepatic (EGP) and 
peripheral insulin sensitivity.  
Due to the variability in fasting blood glucose concentrations in subjects with diabetes mellitus, which might affect the metabolic response, an overnight baseline period will be 
GE Research  
Clinical Study  Protocol  Confidential  Page 39 of 89

Version 4.0 24Sep2020  
-GE CONFIDENTIAL - used to establish the target plasma gluc ose concentration of 100 mg/dL (± 10%)  prior to 
fasting EGP measurements . 
Endogenous glucose production will be measured in the fasting state prior to the start of 
the clamp  and suppression of EGP during step 1 of the 2- step H -E clamp. It will be 
assessed using a stable isotope labeled glucose ( [6,6-2H2]glucose ) tracer method.  
Insulin will be infused at a low  dose, followed by a high dose. During the low -dose IV 
insulin infusion, EGP will be partially suppressed, while during the high dose IV insulin 
infusi on, EGP will be near completely suppressed.  
Metabolic changes in response to glucose ingestion will be assessed via an OGTT . It will 
be performed to assess the postprandial carbohydrate metabol ism to see changes in 
insulin and glucose response . 
The other glucometabolic  endpoints of this study are chosen to investigate 
additional ultrasound insonification effects.

8.4 Regimen  of Hepatic Ultrasound Insonification  
The porta hepatis  of the liver, is a deep, short, transverse fissure that is located  across the 
left posterior region of the undersurface of the right lobe of the liver. The porta hepatis 
encompasses the portal triad (the main portal vein, common hepatic artery, and common 
bile ducts), lymphatics, nerves, and connective tissue.  The portal vein, hepatic artery, and 
nerves derived from the left vagal trunk and sympathetic plexus ascend the porta hepatis, whereas the common bile duct and lymphatics descend the porta hepatis. T he nerves that

Version 4.0 24Sep2020  
-GE CONFIDENTIAL - run through the porta hepatis are branches of the left vagus nerve and sympathetic 
branches of the celiac plexus.  
Assessment of the porta hepatis region with u ltrasound i nsonifications will be performed 
by a specialized  health care professio nal, specialized in ultrasonic imaging, with 
appropriate training in the assessment of the liver and porta hepatis region, as well as in 
using the GE LOGIQ™ E10 Imaging Ultrasound System . Insonification will be 
performed on  three consecutive days during the study (Days 15, 16 and 17). Subjects will 
be insonified by the stimulus pulse  for 15 minutes on each day,  for a total of 45 minutes.  
The s onogra pher will perform all ultrasound examinations in all subjects  of this st udy. 
The sonographer will have the option of performing targeting and insonification during 
breath holds in order to aid in identification and ultrasound delivery to the target location. 
If breath holds are utilized, the subject will be allowed 1 -2 minutes during each breath 
hold (during which ultrasound is not being applied), these rest periods will no count 
toward the 15- minute dose or ultrasound delivery time target.  
For the actual assessment, s ubjects need to  be in fa sting conditions for ≥10 h prior to 
assessment. Insonification s will s tart between  approximately 07:00 h and 08:30 h on each 
insonification day. 
For details and images that represent the anatomical area, please see the customized 
instructions on the insonification and the Operations Manual.  
8.5 Ultrasound Insonification Effect  
If a study procedure  error occurs  (including, but not limited to Principal Investigator 
errors, and/or study subject non- compliance) , it should be documented as Protocol 
Deviation . A brief description should be provided in the deviati on, including whether the 
subject was symptomatic (list symptoms) or asymptomatic, and the event accidental or intentional.  
Details should be captured on the Dosing Case Report Form. If the subject  was exposed 
to the procedure for a time  that exceeds proto col specifications and the subject is 
symptomatic, then the symptom(s) should be documented as an A DE and be reported.  
Should a  study procedure error  occur, the Principal Investigator  or designee should 
contact the Sponsor  or designee within 24 hours.   
8.6 Randomization  and Blinding  
As this is an exploratory , open- label study, no randomization or blinding will be 
performed and no- unblinding codes are required.  
If subjects drop out  or are removed from the study, they may be replaced until the 
anticipated number of subjects have completed the study.

9.1 Study Procedures  
9.1.1 Informed Consent  and HIPAA Release  
Written informed consent will be obtained from each subject prior to performing any 
study- specific evaluations. The HIPA A release is embedded in the informed consent 
document. The informed consent document is subject to review and approval by the 
Sponsor and will be approved by a qualified IRB. The IRB -approved document must 
contain, at minimum, the eight basic elements of informed consent set forth in applicable law. Only the most recently IRB -approved informed consent document must be used to 
consent prospective study subjects. The Principal Investigator  (according to applicable 
regulatory requirements), or a person designated by the Principal Investigator  and under 
the Principal Investigator ’s responsibility, will fully inform the potential study subject of 
all pertinent aspects of the Clinical Study, including written information given approval/favorable opinion by the  IRB.  
Prior to the potential subject’s participation in the Clinical Study, the written informed 
consent form must be signed, name filled in and personally dated by the subject and by 
the person who conducted the informed consent discussion, and by the Principal  
Investigator . One copy of the signed and dated informed consent document will be given 
to the subject and the original retained by the Principal Investigator /site.  
9.1.2 Screening  
Investigators must account for all subjects who sign informed consent forms. The 
Principal Investigator  will keep a Subject Screening and Enrollment Log at the 
investigational site. Subjects who have screen failed may be allowed to re- screen once at 
the discretion of the Principal Investigator . A new screening number will be assigned.  
Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are eligible for this study and will be invited for the i n-house periods.   
Subjects will be instructed on factors influencing insulin sensitivity . They will be 
instructed on maintain ing their usual diet and exercise programs for the duration of the 
study and refraining from strenuous exercise prior to the study assessments /check -in to 
the in -house periods , avoidance of alcohol  and herbal products , smoking or medicat ion 
and illness/infection.  Specific f actors will be assessed at check -in for the in- house 
periods.  
If subjects  are fasting (only water for ≥  10 hours), all screening assessments may be done 
on the same day. If subjects  are not fasting, they will be invited  to return for a second 
screening visit as available to complete any missing screening procedures (e.g. laboratory assessments)  within the available screening window . 
For eligible subjects with a BMI> 35.0 and ≤ 40.0 kg/m

contraception must  be on stable hormonal contraception for >2 month prior to Screening 
and for the entire study.  
Male  subjects  are not required to  use any methods of contraception.   
9.1.10  Pregnancy  
In the event a  subject becomes  pregnant during the study,  she should be wi thdrawn.  
However, the subject will be encouraged to complete the post -treatment follow -up 
portion of the study to the extent that study procedures do not interfere with the 
pregnancy.  
If the pregnancy occurs at any time during the  study, t he pregnancy should be reported 
immediately  to the Sponsor , using a pregnancy notification form . 
Study subjects will give consent on enrol lment that the Principal Investigator  will report 
any pregnancy during the study to the Sponsor  and that they will be asked to provide 
information about her pregnancy, delivery,  and the health of her infant until age one 
month.  Payment for all aspects of obstetrical care, child,  or related care will be the 
subject’s responsibility.  
All reported pregnancies will be followed up to final outcome, using the pregnancy and 
pregnancy follow -up form s. The outcome, including any premature termination, will  be 
reported to the Sponsor . An evaluation after the birth of  the child may  also be conducted.  
Study- related p regnancy complications must be recorded as adverse event(s).  
9.1.11  ECG Procedure   
A standard 12- lead ECG will be recorded  after 5 minutes in a supine position.  
The Principal Investiga tor (or designee) will interpret the ECG’s by use of an electronic 
measurement using the following categories: within normal limits, abnormal but not 
clinica lly significant, or abnormal with clinical  significance.  ECG s are performed 
according to the Schedule of Events (SOE) . The following par ameters will be recorded  
GE Research  
Clinical Study  Protocol  Confidential  Page 55 of 89  
Protocol No. GE -HUI -01 
 
Version 4.0 24Sep2020  
-GE CONFIDENTIAL - from the subject’s ECG trace as calculated by the machine algorithm : heart rate, QT 
interval, PR interval, QRS interval, RR interval, and QTc (correc ted) using the Fridericia 
correction  (QTcF = QT ÷ cube root of the R -R interval [ where R -R is the duration of the 
entire cardiac cycle] ). 
When ECGs are to be collected at the same time point as a blood collection, ECGs should 
be collected first  to avoid any artificially increased heart rates due to the blood collection.  
ECGs on clamp days will be performed before  and a fter the clamp procedure.  
In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs. If a machine- read QTc 
value is prolonged, repeat mea surements ma y not be necessary if the Principal 
Investigator ’s interpretation determines that the QTc value is in the acceptable range.  
9.1.12  Check -in Procedure 
All subjects will check in to the clinic in the morning to the In -house  Periods . The 
following will be assessed:  
1. Alcohol breath test.  
2. Urine drug screen.  
3. Urine pregnancy test.  
4. Any use of prescription or non- prescription medicine /herbal medicine  other than the 
allowed concomitant medications.  
5. Any medical condition that could interfere with glucose metabolism, as judged by the Principal Investigator . 
6. Any vigorous exercise 24 hours prior to check- in to the in -house periods (for example: 
heavy lifting, weight training, calisthenics, and aerobic activity).  
Subjects who fulfill one or more of the stated criteria at check -in, will not be able to 
continue onto the in-house  period. The in-house  period will be rescheduled. Each in -
house  period may be rescheduled no more than once . Subjects will be given up to 5 days 
to reschedule check -in on Day 15, in case of a weekend/holiday or subject’s personal 
issue. However , once checked -in for Day 15, there w ill not be a window to reschedule 
remaining insonification procedures (Day 16 & 17).  After that, the subject will be 
excluded from the study. Replacement of subjects  is be permitted . 
9.1.13  Fasting Plasma Glucose  
Fasting plasma glucose will be measured during the in- clinic period with an YSI 2300 
STAT glucose analyzer (YSI) at time points stated in the  Schedule of Events (SOE)
. On 
the days that subjects are treated for hypoglycemic events during the evening hours, the morning lab will not be in the fasting state.

-GE CONFIDENTIAL - 9.1.14  Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG)  
Subjects will also be provided with a SMBG device for glucose m onitoring.  They will be 
instructed on how to use the glucometer and to monitor their fasting plasma glucose 
levels. For further details on capturing data and documentation, please see the Operations 
Manual.  
In this study, a BG meter ( e.g., Accu -Check® Aviva Plus) will be used, so that data can 
be downloaded by the site at the study visits. A confirmation measurement of the glucose 
values may be performed by a standard glucose analyzer.   
Although subjects apply whole blood to the test strip, the system ha s been calibrated to  
deliver plasma‑like values for easier comparison to laboratory results.  The term plasma 
glucose will be used throughout the protocol in reference to the glucometer results, while 
the term blood glucose will be used in reference to the blood sample that is used for 
measurement.  
Subjects  will be instructed to perform a SMBG check every morning in fasting condition 
(FPG)  during the outpatient  period.  
Additional blood glucose measurements can be performed by fingerstick at any time for 
safety reason, or when a CGMS measurement needs to be confirmed or validated.  
Subjects will be instructed to monitor their fasting plasma glucose levels daily during the outpatient  period. Subjects will be frequently contacted by qualified study site staff vi a 
telephone calls to review their fasting plasma glucose values. These phone calls/phone visits will be documented in a Telephone Log. For further details please see the Operations Manual.  
Subjects are instructed to contact study staff i f they measure an FPG (after 10 hours of 
fasting) > 220 mg/dL, experiences symptoms of hypoglycemia , or measures  an FPG < 70 
mg/dL. A confirmation measurement of the glucose values may be performed by a 
laboratory method (YSI). In case FPG value have reached the stated limit s, and values are 
confirmed by a standard glucose analyzer, subjects will be counseled on how to keep 
their FPG w ithin these limits . The subject will then have a reassessment, per PI 
discretion, of their FPG, confirmed by the glucose analyzer. If the retested and verified 
FPG is still outside  the stated thresholds  they will be dropped from the study and may be 
replaced. At the end of the study, subjects may keep their glucometer to measure to 
control their blood glucose at home.  
9.1.15  Standardized Meals  
During in- house period(s) , subjects will receive standardized meals.  These meals will be 
provided up to 12 hours prior to OGTT and start of scheduled clamp procedures . Meals 
will be provided after the OGTT and or clamp procedure have  been terminated.  
The standardized weight maintaining meals will be provided using estimated BMR × 
activity factor of 1.5 to determine daily cal oric intake. Macronutrient composition will be 
standardized.

Subjects will be counseled to maintain their normal diet and exercise regimen. They will 
be instructed not to start any new diets, supplements, or exercise progra ms during the 
study.   
9.1.17  Physical Activity  
Subjects will be instructed to maintain their usual exercise programs for the duration of 
the study. Subjects will be asked to refrain from vigorous exercise 24 hours prior to 
check -in to the in -house periods and during in- house stays (for example: heavy lifting, 
weight training, calisthenics, and aerobic activity).  
9.1.18  CGMS  
All subjects will be connected to a CGMS ( e.g., Dexcom G 6, San Diego, CA, USA) to 
register blood glucose concentrations during the study as descri bed in the Operations  
Manual.  
Please refer to the User Guide for all detailed device instructions  and the Operations 
Manual . 
In case the CGMS might get dislodged and the sensor would need to be re -inserted , 
subjects would be asked to come to the clinic . 
9.1.19  Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) 
An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be administered at the time points specified in 
the Schedule of Events (SOE) .  
Subjects will be fasted ≥ 10 hours prior to the OGTT. At approximately 08:00 h -09:00 h 
the OGTT will begin. Subjects will be asked to drink 75 g of glucose in a 10 -fluid ounce 
beverage over 5 minutes. The glucose ingestion will be followed by approximately 100 
mL of water. The subject will rest for the duration of test and will abstain from eating. Only small amounts of water may be consumed for the duration of the test. Sampling for 
fasting glucose, C -peptide, insulin sampling will be performed before the OGTT and 15, 
30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min after the start of the glucose administration.  
The time of all blood draws and the time when the subjects start to drink the glucose 
solut ion will be recorded.  
OGTT sampling schedule: Time points are relative to start of OGTT procedure. All samples will be taken within a window of ± 3 -minutes.  
All OGTT procedures during the in- house periods  on Day 1 and Day 16 will follow the 
same schedule.  
The OGTT procedure for each subject (inter -individual) will start one hour  (nominal 
time)  after the start of their hepatic ultrasound insonification.  A window of ± 15 minutes 
will be allowed.

9.1.20  Overnight IV Insulin Infusion  
At approximately 22:00 pm on the evening prior to a clamping procedure, an overnight 
IV insulin infusion to achieve plasma glucose levels of approximately 100 ± 10 mg/dL 
during the last two hours of the overnight  IV infusion prior to the fasting  EGP assessment 
period. Glucose levels will be monitored frequently.   
On the evening prior to the clamp procedure, subjects will receive a standardized dinner, 
which will be followed by an approximately 10- hour overnight fast.  
The aim is to only use insulin to achi eve the target glucose level and to avoid 
simultaneous infusion of glucose. In case blood glucose levels are lower than the target 
level, an IV  glucose infusion may be used and recorded.  
The amount of insulin administered will be recorded and expressed in mU/m2/min for 
each individual subject considering his/her body surface area. GIR will be recorded 
during the entire clamp procedure.  
For details please see the Operations Manual.  
9.1.21  Intravenous Infusion of Stable Isotope Labeled Glucose and Assessment of 
Endogenous Glucose Production  
Endogenous glucose production or EGP will be measured in the fasting state prior to the 
start of the clamp and during the 2- step H -E clamp procedure  to assess insulin -induced 
suppression of EGP using a stable isotope labeled glucose ( [6,6-2H2]glucose ) tracer 
method.

Version 4.0 24Sep2020  
-GE CONFIDENTIAL - A primed -continuous  IV infusion of [6,6-2H2]glucose  will be initiated prior to the clamp 
and continued throughout  the clamp  at various rates . At approximately mid night , 5.5 mg 
[6,6-2H2]glucose/kg body weight will be injected  (priming dose) over  10 minutes, 
followed by a constant infusion of 0.05 mg [6,6-2H2]glucose/kg body weight/min until 
the end of the fasting EGP assessment period, followed by a rate of 0.025 mg [6,6 -2H2] 
glucose/kg body weight/min from beginning to end of the Step 1 insulin infusion.  The 
[6,6-2H2]glucose infusion is discontinued at the end of the Step 1 of the clamp.  Blood 
samples will be taken during the last 30 minutes of the fasting, step 1 and step 2 periods 
(see Table 9-3). The glucose enrichment in the plasma  will be measured using gas 
chromatography- mass spectrometry (GC -MS). EGP will be calculated during the last 30 
minutes of each assessment period from the dilution of the infused stable isotope labeled glucose using the steady- state method of Steele.  
For details please see the Operations Manual  and Pharmacy Manual.  
9.1.22  Two -step Hyperinsulin emic, Euglycemic Clamp  
On the evening prior to the clamp procedure, subjects will receive a standardized dinner, 
which will be followed by an approximately 10- hour overnight fast.  
Subjects will receive an overnight insulin IV infusion to achieve plasma gl ucose levels of 
approximately 100 ± 10 mg/dL during the last two hours of the overnight IV infusion 
prior to the fasting  EGP assessment period.  
Subjects will be connected to the Biostator
 prior to the start of the clamp procedure.  
During step 1 and step 2 of  the clamp procedure, insulin will be infused at two infusion 
rates each lasting approximately 180 minutes  and D20W will be enriched with stable 
isotope labeled glucose to achieve a stable isotope glucose enrichment comparable to that 
of plasma in the fa sting state (e.g., 2.5 to 3% for plasma [6,6-2H2]glucose). Insulin will be 
infused IV by means of a precision pump for 180 min at the following rate:  
Step 1:  For the Step 1 insulin infusion of the clamp procedures at Day 2 , an amount of 10 
mU/m2/min will be added to the average insulin infusion rate which was provided per 
algorithm over the last 2 hours of the overnight infusion. This will be calculated for eac h 
individual subject.  
For the Step 1 insulin infusion of the clamp procedures at Day 17, the insulin infusion rate 
should be identical to the rate used at Day 2 . It is important that each subject receives the 
same insulin infusion rate on Day 17 that he/s he received on Day 2.  
Step 2:  After 180 minutes (end of Step 1), the insulin infusion will be increased to 120 
mU/m2/min for a further 180 minutes (Step 2) of the clamp for all subjects at Day 2 and 
Day 17. This will provide supraphysiological insulin conc entrations that will near -
maximally stimulate glucose disposal. EGP is expected to be near maximally suppressed.  
The glucose infusion rate (GIR; 20% v/v) required to maintain arterialized venous blood 
glucose (glucose oxidase method) at the target level of  100 ± 10 mg/dL will be recorded 
throughout the clamp. The steady- state period for insulin sensitivity measurements is

insulin infusion during each step, and the GIR rec orded during the last 30 minutes 
(steady -state) of each insulin infusion step is used for the determination of insulin 
sensitivity. Blood samples for the determination of plasma glucose will be drawn at 
scheduled time points before and during the clamp.  
 Insulin infusion rates may be adjusted per PI discretion and discussion.  
The clamp procedure will terminate approximately 6 hours after the initiation of Step 1. 
The insulin infusion will be discontinued after the last blood sample has been collected.  
As a background validation with a second methodology for safety, the standardized 
measurements of the Biostator  will be verified on a regular basis  using the YSI reference 
device at approximately every 30 minutes.  
All clamp procedures will follow the same sc hedule.

10.1 Definitions  
10.1.1  Adverse Device Effect  (ADE)  
An AD E is any undesi rable and unintended medical event occurring to a subject in a 
clinical study, whether or not related to the study procedures . This includes events from 
the first study related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent and until 
post treat ment follow -up period as defined in the protocol. The following should not be 
recorded as A DEs, if recorded as medical history/concomitant illness on the CRF at 
screening:  
• Pre-planned procedure, unless the condition for which the procedure was planned 
has worsened from the first study related activity after the subject has signed the 
informed consent  
• Pre-existing conditions found as a result of screening procedures  
• Pre-existing events that has not worsened in intensity or frequency from baseline  
10.1.2  Clinical Laboratory Adverse Device Event  
A clinical laboratory A DE is any clinically significant laboratory abnormality that 
suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity, which requires active management, (i.e. more frequent follow -up or diagnostic investigation).  
A laboratory re -test and/or continued monitoring of an abnormal value is  not considered 
an intervention. In addition, repeated or additional noninvasive testing for verification, 
evaluation or monitoring of an abnormality is not considered an intervention.  
10.1.3  Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  (UADE)  
Any serious adverse effect o n health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death 
caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan 
or application (inc luding a supplementary plan or application) or any other unanticipated 
serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of 
subjects.  
10.1.4  Severity  of ADEs 
ADEs will be graded according to National Cancer Institute Common T erminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE v5.0). The different categories of intensity (severity) are characterized as follows:

**Self- care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden  
10.1.5  Relationship to Study Treatment  
The relationship of each A DE to the study pr ocedure(s) will be assessed by the Principal 
Investigator  or Sub- Investigator on the basis of his/her clinical judgment and the 
following definitions:  
1= Related : 
The A DE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from t he ex posure to the study 
procedures , and cannot be reasonably explained by the subject’s clinical state or other 
factors (e .g., disease under study, concurrent diseases, or concomitant medications).  
 
The A DE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from exposure to the study procedures , 
and represents a known reaction to the study treatments or procedures, or is predicted by the known pharmacological properties of the treatment.  
 The A DE resolves with discontinuation of the investigational product and/or recurs wi th 
rechallenge, if applicable.  
 
2 = Not Related : 
The A DE does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from exposure to the study 
procedures , or can be reasonably explained by the subject’s clinical state or other factors 
(e.g., disease under study, concurrent diseases and concomitant medications).  
10.2 Procedures  
10.2.1  Collection and Record ing of A DEs 
Collection of all ADEs (UADEs and ADEs) will commence from the time the subject 
signs the informed consent to participate in the study until the post -treatment follow -up 
GE Research  
Clinical Study  Protocol  Confidential  Page 67 of 89  
Protocol No. GE -HUI -01 
 
Version 4.0 24Sep2020  
-GE CONFIDENTIAL - visit.  At each study visit  and throughout the in- house treatment period, the Principal 
Investigator  will assess whether any subjective A DEs have occurred. In order to avoid 
bias in eliciting A DEs, a non- specific question, such as “How have you been feeling 
since your last visit?” may be asked. Subjects may report A DEs occurring at a ny other 
time during the study.  
All subjects experiencing A DEs must be monitored and given appropriate medical 
treatment at the discr etion and judgement of the Principal Investigator  until the symptoms 
subside and any clinically relevant changes in laboratory values have returned to baseline 
or until there is a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed. All  ADEs will be 
document ed in the A DE page of the eCRF,  whether or not the Principal Investigator  
concludes that the event is related to the treatment /procedure . The event term, start and 
stop dates , severity, action taken  and outcome, will be documented.  
10.2.2  Collection and Reporting  of UADEs  
When an UADE  occurs , the Principal Investigator  should report it according to the 
following procedure:  
An UADE  form must be completed  immediately or within 24 hours of first onset or 
notification of the event. The information should be completed as fully as pos sible but 
contain, at a minimum a  short description of the event and the reason why the event is 
categorized as serious , subject  identification numb er, Principal Investigator ’s name, name 
of the study procedure  and a c ausality assessment.  
In the interest of subject safety, and in order to fulfill regulatory requirements , all UADEs  
should be reported to the IRB and Sponsor or a designated qualified vendor within 24 
hours of the Study Center’s first knowledge of the  event , but in no event later than 10 
working days .  
The collection of UADEs  will begin after the subject signs the informed consent form 
and stop at the end of the subject’s follow -up period. An Initial UAD E Form should be 
completed , and a copy should be securely faxed  or e-mailed  to the Sponsor or designated 
qualified vendor . 
10.3 Anticipated ADEs  
Normal precautions taken for a human study, including the provision of emergency equipment, will be taken during this study. Qualified and well -trained  physicians and 
medical staff will instruct the subjects.  
Possible anticipated, adverse effects or inconveniences for subjects participating in  the 
study procedure are:

Version 4.0 24Sep2020  
-GE CONFIDENTIAL - under  continuous surveillance and frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels as 
specified. Since there is simultaneous IV infusion of glucose, the occurrence of severe 
hypoglycemia is unlikely. If a blood glucose value < 70 mg/dL is recorded and confirmed 
by Y SI, or the subject has neurogenic symptoms (palpitations, tremor, hunger, sweats) or 
symptoms of neuroglycopenia (confusion, lethargy, agitation, reduced level of 
consciousness), the subject must be treated at the discretion of the Principal Investigator  
to prevent or alleviate neuroglycopenic symptoms. Treatment may include ingestion of 
carbohydrates (e .g., apple juice), IV  glucose bolus injections, IV  glucose infusions or 
other methods as required per Principal Investigator . Subjects will be monitored clo sely, 
and it will be a clinical decision made by the Principal Investigator  to move from oral to 
IV glucose bolus, to IV  glucose infusion. Severe hypoglycemia (as defined by the ADA 
Workgroup) should be treated at the Principal Investigator ’s discretion according to best 
available medical practice. As a safety precaution, a glucose solution will be available 
near the subject.  
Hypoglycemic events will be recorded as adverse events, if symptoms develop or if blood 
glucose measured is <  70 mg/dL , even if no s ymptoms are present. The subjects will only 
be discharged from the clinic, if deemed safe by the Principal Investigator . 
10.3.2  Procedure Related Adverse Events  
Study procedures involve the placement of an IV  catheter which may lead to allergic 
reaction, redness, swelling, bruising, pain, bleeding or infection at catheter insertion site .  
The study procedures also involved the use of adhesive to secure the placement medical equipment. The adhesive may cause an al lergic reaction, redness, swelling or itching 
when in contact with the skin.  
10.3.3  Risks Related to CGMS  
During the study, CGMS will be used. The CGM poses no major risks to the subjects. CGMS sensor placement may lead to mild skin irritation at the insertion site, such as 
erythema, edem a, rash, bleeding, itching, bruising, scaling skin, and induration. Rarely 
sensors may fracture,  and a small piece may remain under the skin which will need to be 
removed by a study clinician. This may cause mild discomfort, bruising, or temporary 
bleeding.  In order to avoid risks, CGM catheter will be placed under sterile conditions by 
experienced staff members. In the case of signs of inflammation or bruising at the sensor insertion site, the sensor will be removed immediately , and standard of care will apply. 
The subject s will be given one of the study physician or nurse practitioner’s cell phone 
number to contact for any questions, concerns or problems.  
10.3.4  Risks Related to OGTT  
Subjects will participate in OGTTs during the study, which may lead to  nausea or  
gastrointestinal discomfort following the drink.  Subjects will be asked to lie flat and rest 
as typically these feelings pass very quickly. If the nausea does not pass, then the study 
will be terminated and they will be offered food to eat, which will mitigate the problem.

Version 4.0 24Sep2020  
-GE CONFIDENTIAL - 10.3.5  Risks Related to R epeated Blood Draws  
Subjects will participate in several blood draws throughout the course of the study which 
have the potential to cause a v enous line -vasovagal response, bruising, tenderness, and 
rarely infection.  Treatment of any  complication s, if necessary, usually involves warm 
compresses to the area for one to several days. Although the study involves numerous 
blood draws, it is considered minimal risk since the study will only involve healthy adult 
individuals. In addition, the overall blood volume that will be  collect ed, will be below the 
maximum blood collection volume deemed minimal risk (i.e., no more than  550 ml in an 
8‐week period).  
10.3.6  Risk Related to H epatic Insonification  
The General Electric LOG IQ E 10 ultrasound pulsed doppler imaging system and C1‐6‐D 
XDclear abdominal  curvilinear probe are FDA cleared ( K173555) with the indication for 
ultrasound evaluation of fetal,  abdominal, pediatric, small organ (breast, testes, thyroid), 
neonatal cephalic,  adult cephalic, cardiac (pediatric and adult), peripheral vascular, 
musculoskeletal conventional and superficial, urology (including prostate), transrectal, 
transvaginal, transesophageal, and intraoperative (abdominal, thoracic,  and vascular).  
Since the u ltrasound device will be used on this study to test for organ‐specific biological 
effects,  it is being used off‐label on this study, and therefore, is considered 
investigational. Although its  use in this  study is considered investigational, its use is 
considered to constitute minimal risk  given that it will be  operated within the confines of 
its FDA‐cleared equipment parameters and below the guidelines established by the FDA 
for ultrasound equipment. The FDA guidelines  indicate that the  derated global maxim um 
acoustic output should not exceed preamendment  acoustic output exposure  levels. In the 
case of diagnostic ultrasound, the global maximum  derated spatial‐peak temporal‐average 
intensity (ISPTA –  the highest intensity measured at any point in the ultrasound beam 
averaged over the  pulse repetition period) is ≤  720 mW/cm2 with either the global 
maximum mechanical index being ≤  1.9 or the global maximum derated spatial‐peak 
pulse‐average intensity (ISPPA – the highest intensity  measured at any point i n the 
ultrasound beam averaged over the temporal duration of the pulse) being  ≤ 190 W/cm2 
(not including ophthalmic use).  
10.4 Follow -up of A DEs and UADEs  
All A DEs should be followed up and subjects will be rendered appropriate medical care 
and treatment at the discretion of the Principal Investigator  until resolution or until the 
Principal Investigator  and Sponsor concludes that “further follow -up is not necessary”. If 
the ADE has not resolved by the post -treatment follow -up visit, the stop date will be 
recorded as “ongoing.”  
All UADEs  should be followed up until resolution or permanent outcome of the event or 
until the Principal Investigator  and S ponsor judge that fur ther f ollow -up is not necessary .

later date, the Principal Investigator  should complete a follow -up UADE  form at the 
earliest possible or provide other written documentati on and send  it electronically  within 
24 hours of receipt  of information to the Sponsor or designee . Copies of any relevant data 
from the hospital notes (e .g., ECGs, laboratory tests, discharge summary, postmortem 
results) should be sent  accordingly.  
All other non- serious ADEs must be followed until the outcome of the event is 
“recovering” (for chronic conditions), or “recovered” , or until the end of the post -
treatment follow -up stated in the protocol, whichever comes first, and until all  queries 
related to these A DE’s have been resolved.  
10.4.1  Safety Reporting to  IRBs and Regulatory Authorities

12.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans  
ProSciento  or qualified designee  will be responsible for the statistical services, including 
statistical analysis , statistical reports  and the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
An SAP will be prepared  prior to database lock, that will provide further details regarding 
the definition of analysis variables and analysis methodology to address all study 
objectives.  It will also provide any changes or additions to the analys es that are not 
apparent in the protocol.  
12.1.1  Analysis Sets 
12.1.1.1 Safety Set  
The Safety population will consist of all  subjects  who received at least  1 hepatic 
ultrasound insonification. This will be the  primary analysis population for the evaluation 
of exposure  and safety . 
12.1.1.2 Ultrasound Insonification Effect  Set 
The ultrasound insonification effect population will consist of all subje cts who received 
at least 1 hepatic ultrasound insonification.  It is the same as the safety set and will be the 
primary analysis population for the primary endpoint.  
12.1.2  Analysis of Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for all subjects . Summary 
statistics (e .g., number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation, and range) will be 
generated for continuous variables (e .g., age and weight) and the number  and percentage 
of subjects within each category will be presented for categorical variables . 
12.1.3  Analysis of the Endpoints  for Ultrasound Insonification  
12.1.3.1 Two-Step Hyperinsulinemic -Euglycemic Clamp  Analysis  
The analysis of the two- step H -E Clamp will consist of summarizing whole -body insulin 
sensitivity and EGP results. Results will be summarized descriptively.  
Changes in insulin sensitivity will be assessed by the following calculations:  
• SIclamp:  Insulin Sensitivity Index 
• M:  Glucose disposal rate d uring steady state  
• MCR:   Glucose metabolic clearance rate during steady state  
• M/I:  Glucose metabolism: insulin ratio during steady state  
Insulin Sensitivity Index (SI clamp)

Version 4.0 24Sep2020  
-GE CONFIDENTIAL - The insulin sensitivity index (SI clamp) will be calculated using the formula be low, with 
Step 1 indicating the first phase of the clamp, or the period of administration of the first 
(lower) insulin infusion rate and Step 2 indicating the second phase of the clamp or the 
period of administration of the second (higher) insulin infusion rate. Mean glucose 
infusion rates and mean insulin concentrations will be calculated during steady state (the 
last 30 minutes of the clamp step) for the applicable step(s).  
SIclamp =mean (GIR )Step2−mean (GIR )Step1
�mean (I)Step2-mean (I)Step1�×�mean (BG)Steps1&2� 
Change from baseline (CFB) of SI clamp will then be computed for each subject as 
CFB�SIclamp�=SIclamp2−SIclamp1 , where clamp 2 is the second clamp and clamp 1 is 
the first clamp (completed on Day 2; prior to first insonification). Change from baseline 
of SI clamp, together with SI clamp for each clamp individually, will be included in the 
efficacy analysis dataset.  
Glucose disposal rate (M) during steady state  
Glucose disposal rate (M) is obtained as the glucose infusion rate per min corrected for 
body weight and/or fat free mass.  Glucose disposal rate will be calculated separately for 
Step 1 and Step 2  and for each clamp . 
Glucose metabolic clearance rate (MCR) during steady state  
Glucose metabolic clearance rate (MCR) is calculated using the formula below  for each 
clamp . Rates will be compared.  Glucose MCR will be calculated separately for Step 1 
and Step 2, with Step 1 indicating the first phase of the clamp, or the period of 
administration of the first (lower) insulin infusion rate and Step 2 indicating the second 
phase of the clamp or the period of administration of the second (higher) insulin infusion 
rate.  
MCR=100×mean (M)
mean (BG) 
Glucose metabolism: insulin ratio (M/I) during steady state  
Insulin ratio (M/I) will be calculated for each clamp and ratios will be  compared. This is 
the preferred measure and primary endpoint . Glucose metabolism: insulin ratio (M/I) is 
calculated as the glucose disposal rate (M) divided by the insulin concentrati on (I).   
 
The planned analyses will be described in more detail in the statistical analysis plan 
(SAP).  
12.1.3.2 EGP  
Fasting EGP  
Prior to the two -step H -E Clamp, fasting EGP will be assessed utilizing a low  
primed -continuous infusion of a stable isotope -labeled glucose. At each blood collection

Version 4.0 24Sep2020  
-GE CONFIDENTIAL - time point, plasma glucose enrichments will be measured to determine steady state and to  
determine fasting EGP  using steady- state equations ( Steele 1959 ). 
Insulin- mediated EGP Suppression 
For each clamp, t he degree of EGP suppression from the fasting EGP value will be 
determined during the  last 30 minutes point during each step of the two- step H -E Clamp 
using the following  equation:  
% EGP suppression = 1 - (EGP clamp/EGP fasting)  
 
Partial suppression of EGP during Step 1 is assessed to determine hepatic insulin 
sensitivity and EGP suppression during S tep 2 will be measured to confirm EGP  was 
(near) fully suppressed to allow  the determination of extrahepatic insulin sensitivity.  
 
Rate of Glucose Disappearance (Rd)  
Under steady state conditions, the Rate of Glucose Disappearance (Rd) is equal to the Rate of Glucose Appearance (Ra) and under these condi tions Ra is calculated from the 
dilution of plasma [6,6-
2H2]glucose during constant infusion of [6,6-2H2]glucose.   Rd will 
be calculated during steady state in the fasting period and during S tep 1 and S tep 2 of the 
clamp.  
12.1.4  Safety Analysis  and Endpoints  
Safety of the procedure  will be assessed by collection and review of adverse device 
effects , laboratory parameters, physical examination, vital signs, and ECG parameters 
throughout the duration of the study.  Safety analysis will involve examination of the 
descriptive statistics and individual subject listings  for effects of study treatment on 
clinical tolerability and safety.  
Safety data will be summarized using the safety analysis set.  
12.1.4.1 Adverse Device Effects

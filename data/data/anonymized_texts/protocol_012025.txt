CLINICAL STUDY SYNOPSIS: Study LIN-MD-10
Study Number LIN-MD -10
Title of StudyAn Open -label, Long -term Study to Assess the Immunogenicity of Linaclotide 
Administered Orally to Adult Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome W ith 
Constipation or Chronic Idiopathic Constipation
Study Centers (Country) Approximately 80 (United States)
Development Phase 4
Objective sThe primary objective of this study is to assess the potential of linaclotide 
treatment to induce the development of anti -drug antibodies (ADAs). The 
secondary objectives are to provide additional evidence supporting the long -
term safety and efficacy of linaclotide in adult irritable bowel syndrome with 
constipation (IBS -C) and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) patients and to 
evaluate lower doses of linaclotide in patients who consider study withdrawal 
due to intolerable adverse events (AEs) .
Methodo logyMulticenter , open -label study . Patients who experience intolerable AEs ( defined 
as AEs that subjectively would cause a patient to consider study withdrawal),
may have their dosing suspended and, following resolution of the intolerable 
AEs,be randomiz ed to receive the same or lower doses of double -blind 
linaclotide as an optional treatment course . Patients who experience further 
intolerable AEs after the randomization can be transitioned to open -label 72 ug
linaclotide.
Number of Patients1000 (projected number screened); 800 IBS -C or CIC enrolled. For each patient 
group (IBS -C or CIC), at least 300 patients are expected to be enrolled.
Diagnosis and 
Main Criteria for InclusionMale and female adult ( ≥ 18 years of age) outpatients who meet the Rome III 
criteria for IBS -C or CIC
Test Product, Dosage, and Mode of 
AdministrationPatients with CIC: l inaclotide 145 -ugcapsules , oral ly,once daily 
Patients with IBS -C: linaclotide 290- ugcapsules, orally, once daily
Patients with intolerable AEs will be randomized to receive 290 ug, 145 ug, or 
the lower (unapproved) dose of 72 uglinaclotide oral capsules for IBS-C; and 
145 ug or 72 u g for CIC. Patients who experience further intolerable AEs after 
the randomization ca n be transitioned to open -label 72 uglinaclotide.
Duration of Treatment Up to a 3 -week Screening Period, followed by a 52 -wee k Treatment Period
Reference Therapy, Dosage, and 
Mode of Adm inistrationNone
Criteria for Evaluation Patient -reported assessments
Phar macokinetic Analysis Immunogenicity assessments
Primary Outcome Measure ADA determinations from blood samples
Secondary Outcome MeasuresAE reporting of recurrence (including date) of intolerable diarrhea after 
randomization to double -blind treatment following resolution of initial 
intolerable diarrhea.
Assessments of efficacy  during open -label 
treatment, and during double -blind treatment.

Statistical MethodsImmunogenicity Assessments
For each indication separately and combined, the number and percentage of 
patients meeting treatment -related ADA -positive status will be summarized, 
along with the 1-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence interval, for Safety 
Population patients with at least 1assessable postbaseline sample, ie, patients 
who are not postbaseline ADA undetermined (sample lost, damaged ,or out of 
specifications). A sensitivity analysis will be performed where baseline ADA 
undetermined patients are excluded . 
Efficacy 
The efficacy  will be analyzed descriptively based on 
the Inten t-to-Treat Population. As this is an open -label study, no inferential 
statistics will be performed .

7.0 INTRODUCTION
7.1 CHRONIC IDIOPATHIC CONSTIPATION
The sy mptoms of chronic idiopathic constipation (C IC) are repor ted in approximately  
15% of the general population (Stewart et al, 1999). The prevalenc e of C IC is higher in 
women than men and increas es with age (Johanson et al, 1989; Lembo and Camilleri, 
2003). Patients with C IC report multiple bowel and abdominal sy mptoms including 
straining, gas, hard stools, abdominal discomfort, infrequent bowel movements (BMs ), 
bloating, a sense of incomplete eva cuation, and abdominal pain (Johanson and Kralstein, 
2007).
7.2 IRRITABLE BOWEL SYND ROME WITH CONSTIPATI ON
Irritable bowel sy ndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder
characterized b y recurrent sy mptoms of abdominal pai n and/or discom fort accompanied
by altered bowel function (L ongstreth et al, 2006). I n mode rate to severe cases of IBS, an
overall deterioration in quality  of life is often present (Drossman et al, 2002). IBS is one
of the most common GI disorders diagn osed in the United States; data suggest the 
prevalence of IBS is 10% to 15% of the population in North America and Europe
(Muller-Lissner et al, 2001). Based on Rome III guidelines, IBS is subty ped as IBS wi th 
diarrhea (IBS -D) or IBS with constipation (IBS -C); patients who do not fit IBS -C or 
IBS-D subt ypes are classified a s having mixed IBS (IBS- M) or unt yped IBS (IBS -U) 
(Longstreth et al, 2006). In addition to abdominal pain or discomfort and reduced stool 
frequency , IBS -C patients also report a number of other complaints including bloating, 
hard stools, straining, and a sensation of incomplete evacuation.
7.3 SUMMARY OF LINACLOTI DE PROPERTIES
Linacl otide, a 14-amino acid peptide that acts on the apical surface of epithelial cells in
the intestinal lumen to stimulate guan ylate cy clase subty pe C, is approved and marketed 
as an orall y administered therapeutic for the treatment of CIC and IBS-C. By  activating
guan ylate cy clase subt ype C, orally  administered linaclotide has been found to increase 
both intestinal fluid secretion and intestinal transit and also to decrease visceral pain in 
animal models (Linaclotide, 2013) .Linaclotide has minimal oral bioav ailability  (≤ 0.2% ) 
in several animal species (Bryant et al, 2010; Eutamene et al, 2009). Refer to the 
Investigator’s Brochure for a more detailed description of the chemistry , pharmacology , 
efficacy , and safety of linaclotide, based on studies conducted i n animals, healthy  
volunteers, and in patients with IBS- C and CI C(Linaclotide, 2013) .

7.4 CLINICAL EXPERIENCE
Linaclotide has been developed b y the Sponsor ( Forest Research Institute, Inc.) and 
Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, I nc.,for the treatment of CI C and IBS-C in adults. The 
clinical development program for linaclotide that culminated in FDA and European 
Medicines Agency  approvals included the following studies in adult patients:
4 large double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase 3 registration studies (2 IBS- C studies 
[LIN- MD-31 and MCP- 103-302] and 2 CI C studies [LIN -MD-01 and 
MCP -103- 303]) 
2 long -term safet y studies (LIN -MD-02 and MCP-103- 305), each with 78 -week 
treatment periods
In addition, a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group Phase 3b 
study  (LIN -MD-04) in patients with CI C was recently  completed.
The 2 IBS -C studies (LIN -MD-31 and MCP-103- 302) evaluated the safety and efficacy  
of linaclotide 290 ug(the adult dose subsequently  approved b y FDA) administered as an 
oral capsule for 12 o r 26 weeks, respectivel y. In these studies, linaclotide demonstrated 
statistically  significant and clinically  meaningful improvements in patients’ constipation 
symptoms and abdominal pain, and met all the pre- specified primary  and secondary  
endpoints. Study MCP -103-302 demonstrated improvement in abdominal and bowel 
symptoms at 12 weeks that was maintained throughout 26 weeks of treatment. Study  
LIN-MD-31 included a 4 -week double -blind, randomized withdrawal period immediately  
following the 12- week treatment period to assess the potential for rebound worsening of 
bowel or abdominal s ymptoms. The results from the randomized withdrawal period 
showed that there was no evidence of development of tolerance, nor was there evidence 
of rebound worsening of bowel or abdominal s ymptoms relative to baseline once the 
linaclotide was discontinued. The most common adverse event (AE) was diarrhea 
occurring in approximately  20% of IBS-C patients in both studies. Overall, there was no 
obvious pattern in the ty pes of SAEs experienced in either the placebo or linaclotide 
group. There were no SAEs of diarrhea. 
The 2 CI C studies (LIN -MD-01 and MCP-103- 303) evaluated the safety  and efficacy  of 
linaclotide 145 ug (the a dult dose subsequently  approved b y FDA for this indication) and 
linaclotide 290 ug administered as oral capsules. Both the 145 ug and 290 ug doses 
demonstrated statistically significant and clinicall y meaningful improvement in 
constipation and abdominal sy mptoms, and met all pre -specified primary  and secondary  
endpoints. The most common AE was diarrhea occurring in 13.1 % to 17.2% of CI C 
patients in both studies. There were no SAEs of diarrhea although diarrhea was reported 
in 1patient along with SAEs of de hydration and orthostatic hy potension. There were no 
clinically  relevant differences between the 2 linaclotide dose groups in the incidence of 
diarrhea treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), severe diarrhea TEAEs, or diarrhea 
that resulted in discontin uation from the studies.

APPROVED 05 Oct 2015Amended Protocol LIN-MD-10 Amendment 2
The sy stemic exposure to linaclotide was also evaluated in the Phase 3 IBS -C and CI C 
studies in adults. Analy sis of plasma indicated that linaclotide and its only  active 
metabolite (des t yrosine linaclotide) MM-419447, plasma conce ntrations are generally  
not detectable. Linaclotide was detectable at concentrations just above the limit of 
detection (0.2 ng/mL) in the plasma of onl y 2 out of the 465 patients whose plasma 
samples were anal yzed (both were IBS -C patients). MM -419447 was not detectable in 
any patient plasma samples.
Because of linaclotide’s limited sy stemic availability , a thorough QT stud y was not 
performed. However, triplicate electrocardiograms (ECGs) were part of the safet y data 
obtained during the Phase 3 studies in a dults. There were no clinically  meaningful 
differences between placebo and linaclotide groups in the mean or change from baseline 
QT interval ( corrected by either the Bazett or Fridericia formula). Overall the data 
indicated that linaclotide does not adver sely affect the ECG of adult linaclotide -treated 
patients.
Long -term studies LIN -MD-02 and MCP-103- 305 included 78- week treatment periods to 
evaluate the long- term safety  of linaclotide in IBS- C and CI C adult patients. Both studies 
included patients who co mpleted 1 of the linaclotide Phase 2 or 3 studies, or completed 
the pretreatment period of 1 of the Phase 3 double-blind studies, but failed to meet 
specific inclusion or exclusion criteria to be randomized. Study  MCP -103- 305 had a 
single case of aplastic anemia reported; the clinical presentation of the patient suggested 
that the disease process culminating in aplastic anemia began prior to linaclotide 
exposure and was most likely  idiopathic. Post -hoc anal yses of the linaclotide Phase 3 
clinical studies an d long -term safet y studies were undertaken to determine whether there 
was an y evidence of a linaclotide effect on blood cell counts. There was no evidence of 
such an effect and based on linaclotide’s pharmacologic properties and minimal sy stemic 
bioavailab ility, linaclotide is unlikely to cause aplastic anemia. In both Study  
MCP -103- 305 and Study LIN -MD-02, the most commonly  reported AE was diarrhea, 
which occurred in approximately  30% of CI C patients and IBS- C patients in both studies. 
Neither stud y report ed SAEs of diarrhea.
The recentl y completed Phase 3b study (LIN -MD-04) was a randomized, double -blind, 
placebo- controlled, parallel -group, study . Linaclotide at doses of 145 ug /day and 
290 ug /day was administered orally  for 12 weeks to 487 randomized adult patients with 
chronic constipation and prominent abdominal bloating at baseline (ie, bloating ≥ 5.0 on 
an 11 point numerical rating scale). No new safet y trends or concerns were identified. 
There were no deaths during the stud y and no SAEs of diarrhea.

Safety data from these studies in adults showed that, except for diarrhea, the proportion 
of patients reporting a TEAE was similar between placebo and each linaclotide dose 
group, and the incidence of TEAEs was not dose -related. With the exception of the GI 
system organ class (SOC), the occurrence of TEAEs in the CI C and IBS -C patients was 
balanced across treatment groups in each SOC for the adult Phase 3 placebo -controlled 
studies. Diarrhea was the most common TEAE in linaclotide-treated CIC and IBS- C 
patients, consistent with its pharmacology ; however diarrhea was rarel y associated with 
serious sequelae such as dehy dration, fecal incontinence, or defecation urgency . 
SAEs were infrequent and balanced across treatment arms within each indication. An 
analysis of the SAEs across the entire clinical development program revealed no pattern 
to suggest that linaclotide causes any specific serious condition.
Minor abnormalities in laboratory , vital sign, or ECG parameters were observed rarel y; 
overall, there were no clinically  meaningful differences between linaclotide and placebo 
treatment groups for an y of these parameters in the Phase 3 placebo -controlled studies in 
adults.
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for a more detailed description of the chemistry , 
pharm acology , efficacy , and safet y of linaclotide, based on studies conducted in animals, 
healthy  volunteers, and in adult patients with IBS -C and CI C. Linaclotide is 
contraindicated in pediatric patients up to 6 y ears of age. This is because i n nonclinical 
studies, administration of a single, clinically  relevant adult oral dose of linaclotide caused 
deaths in y oung juvenile mice.
7.5 RATIONALE FOR THIS S TUDY
The possibility  of an immune response to linaclotide, in the form of anti -drug antibody  
(ADA), was not evalu ated in the linaclotide clinical development program. Upon 
approval of the NDA, the FDA Division of Gastroenterology  and Inborn Errors Products 
required the S ponsors to evaluate this possibility  by performing “a clinical trial in adults 
receiving Linzess ( linaclotide) to assess development of ADA responses in patient 
samples.” The Division also prescribed that in this trial “adverse events will be 
collected.”
Evaluation of the immunogenicity  of therapeutic proteins and peptides remains an 
important part of product development. Antibody -related clinical sequelae that can occur 
in humans range from no apparent or mild side effects to altered efficacy , 
immune -complex -mediated sy mptoms, and allergic reactions. Thus, it is necessary  to 
collect appropriate data re garding the possibility  of the appearance of and, if they  appear, 
the characteristics of antibodies induced over time and assess how these findings may  be 
associated with clinical outcomes. (Koren et al, 2008; Parenk y et al, 2014 ; Shankar et al,

This open -label stud y is designed to fulfill a post -marketing requirement and in doing so 
determine if ADAs develop in patients treated with linaclotide. Secondarily ,the study  
will provide additional evidence to support the long- term safety  of linaclotide in adult 
IBS-C and CIC patients and evaluate lower doses of linaclotide in patients who develop 
intolerable AEs that prompt consideration of study withdrawal.

8.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES
The primary  objective of this study  is to assess the potential of linaclotide treat ment to 
induce the development of ADAs. The secondary objectives are to provide additional 
evidence supporting the long- term safety  and efficacy  of linaclotide in adult irritable 
bowel sy ndrome with constipation (IBS -C) and CIC patients and to evaluate low er doses 
of linaclotide in patients who consider study withdrawal due to intolerable AEs.

9.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
9.1 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN: DESCRIPTIO N
This will be a multicenter, open -label, long -term clinical study to assess the 
immunogenicit y and long -term safety  of linaclotide administered orally  to adult patients 
with IBS-Cor CIC,and to evaluate lower doses of linaclotide in patients who consider 
study  withdrawal due to intolerable AEs that may  be related to the use of linaclotide.
Approximately  800 IBS- C or CI C patients (a minimum of 300 each) will be enrolled.
The study  will consist of u p to a 3 -week Screening Period, followed b y a 52 -week 
Treatment Period (Figure 9.1–1). Patients who meet the entry  criteria will receive o nce 
daily , open -label dosesof 290 uglinaclotide forpatients with IBS -C; those with CI C will 
receive once daily , open -label dosesof 145 ug linaclotide.
In order to limit patient withdrawa ls from the study  due to AEs and to gain information 
about the effect of lowering the dose inpatients who ex perience intolerable AEs ( defined 
as AEs that subjectivel y would cause a patient to consider stud y withdrawal) , in 
particular diarrhea and other GI AEs that may  be related to the use of linaclotide ,the 
following intervention ( Figure 9.1–2) will be offered as an optional treatment course to 
such patients, unless deemed clinically  inappropriate by  the Investigator:
1.A temporary  suspension of dosing of up to 7 day s. If the dose suspension needs to last 
longer than 7 day s because the intolerable AE has not resolved, then the Investigator 
should contact the Study  Physician to discuss the duration of the dose suspension or 
withdrawal of the patient from the study. All AEs resulting in the temporary  
suspension will be recorded on the eCRF.
2. After the intolerable AE has resolved, the patient will be randomized into a 
Double -blind Treatment Period via an interactive W eb response s ystem (IWRS) and 
will receive dose regimens specific to each indication as follows. If the randomized 
dose regimen is tolerated, the patient will remain on this dose for the duration of the 
study (total duration of linaclotide exposure [whether open -label or double -blind] is 
not to exceed 52 weeks).
IBS-C patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of the following regimens:
○Linaclotide 290 ugevery day
○Linaclotide 145 ugevery day
○Linaclot ide 72 ug every  day 
Forest Research Institute, Inc. Page 26 of 101
APPROVED 05 Oct 2015Amended Protocol LIN-MD-10 Amendment 2
CIC patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the following regimens:
○Linaclotide 145 ugevery day
○Linaclotide 72 ugevery  day
3.If, after randomization, patients experience intolerable AEs , in particular diarrhea or 
other GI AEs , the dosing should be temporarily suspended for up to 7 day s. If the 
dose suspension needs to last longer than 7 day s because the intolerable AE has not 
resolved, then the Investigator should inform the Study  Physician about the duration 
of dose suspensio ns or withdrawal of the patient from the study . 
After the intolerable AE has resolved, irrespective of the IBS -C or CIC status, 
patients should be dispensed open -label linaclotide (72 ug) and may  continue on this 
dose in a Dose -Reduced Open- label Treatment Period for the duration of the study .
4.If patients experience an intolerable AE while receiving the adjusted dose of 72 ugin 
the Dose -Reduced Open- label Treatment Period, study  participation should be 
terminated.
5.In the event of a planned procedu re or an AE during which a patient requires dose 
suspension longer than 7 day s, the Investigator should inform the Study  Physician 
about the duration of dose suspensions. Upon event completion or AE resolution, the 
patient should be resumed on the assigned dose.

Screening Period
The Screening Period starts with signing of the ICF and lasts for up to 2 1calendar day s. 
During this period, patient eligibility  for entry  into the Treatment Period will be 
determined, based on results of physical examination, medication history , 
medical/surgical history , all laboratory  tests, ECG ,and colonoscop y (if applicable). The 
end of the Screening Period coincides with the start of the Treatment Period. 
Treatment Period
The Treatment Period lasts for 52weeks , including open -label treatment (all patients) and 
double -blind treatment (patients with intolerable AEs). Patients will attend study  visits to 
complete all assessments. A list of assessments to be completed for all patients, for IBS -C 
patients, and for CIC patients , as well as the visits at which they  are performed is 
provided in the Schedule of Evaluations ( Section 2.0 ).

Follow-up Period
The follow -up period consists of a 1 -month telephone visit for all patients (Visit 9). A 
4-Month Follow -Up Visit (Visit 10) is required only for patients with treatment- related 
ADAs at the time of study completion (52 weeks, Visit 8) or early termination [ET]. If 
treatment -related ADAs are still present in the patient’s serum at the 4 -Month 
Follow-up Visit, an 8 -Month Follow -up Visit will be required for ADA testing. Patients 
completing the 4 -Month Follow -up Visit will also have a subsequent 1- month 
telephone call to review ADA status and determine if continuation to an 8- Month 
Follow-up Visit (Visit 11) is necessary.
If an ADA -positive patient becomes ADA negative or a baseline ADA- positive patient’s 
titer returns to less than 4 -fold the baseline titer at the e nd the treatment period 
(52weeks or early termination) or 4 -Month Follow -up Visit (Visit 10), no further 
follow-up or visits are required. A list of assessments and the visits at which they are 
performed is provided in the Schedule of Evaluations (Section 2.0).
9.2 DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN, INCLUDING TH E CHOICE 
OF CONTROL GROUPS
An open -label stud y design with up to 52 weeks (12 months) of investigational -product 
exposure was chosen in accordance with the concepts in the I CH-E1 guideline for the 
safet y evalu ation of drugs intended for the long -term treatment (chronic or repeated 
intermittent use for longer than 6 months) of non- life-threatening diseases. The 12- month 
duration of the study  will allow for assessment of the potential for ADAs to develop in 
respo nse to long -term linaclotide treatment.
Two of the linaclotide doses selected for use in this study  for CIC and IBS-C patients 
(145-and 290- ug, respectively ) have been approved, and are currentl y marketed, in North 
America (ie, United States, Canada, and Mexico for both indications) and the European 
Union (IBS -C onl y).Patients with intolerable AEs that occur during open -label dosing 
will be randomized to receive double- blind treatments of 290 ug, 145 ug , or the lower 
(unapproved) dose of 72 uglinaclotide oral capsules for IBS- C; and 145 ug or 72 ug for 
CIC. Patients who experience further intolerable AEs after the randomization can be 
transitioned to open -label 72 ug linaclotide.

9.3.3 Removal of Patients from Therapy or Assessment
Apremature discontinuation will occur when a patient who signed the ICF ceases 
participation in the study , regardless of circumstances, before the completion of the 
study . Patients can be prematurely  discontinued from the study  for one of the following 
reasons:
○Screen failure ( failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria )
○Withdrawal of consent
○AE
○Lack of efficacy
○Protocol violation
○Noncompliance with investigational product
○Lost to follow -up
○Study  terminated by  Sponsor
○Site terminated by  Sponsor
○Other 
All enroll ed patients who prematurel y discontinue from the study, unless the cause is 
screen failure , must beseen for a final assessment at ET ,and follow -up blood samples as 
described in the Schedule of Evaluations ( Section 2.0) should be obtained for patients 
who are ADA positive at the last visit. A final assessment will be defined as completion 
of the evaluations scheduled for the Final Visit at the end of Week 52End of Study  
(EOS)/ET Visit (Visit 8).

APPROVED 05 Oct 2015Amended Protocol LIN-MD-10 Amendment 2

Any patient who withdraws because of an AE will be followed until the AE resolves, 
stabilizes, or can be explained as being unrelated to investigational product. Thestudy
centers must make a reasonable effort to follow pregnant patients until delivery  orend of 
the pregnancy .
Patients who do not complete all required scheduled visits/procedures must be requested 
in writing to come in for a n ET Visit and to return any  unused investigational product. A 
clear description of premature discontinuation must be documented. A copy of the letter, 
together with the source documentation, will be kept by  the Investigator . The reasons for 
premature disc ontinuation from the study  will be reflected on the eCRF.
9.3.4 Patient Replacement Procedures
Patients in this study  who prematurel y discontinue treatment will not be replaced.
9.4 TREATMENTS
9.4.1 Treatments Administered
Investigational product in the form of capsules w ill be provided by  the Sponsor. Patients 
will be supplied capsules with identical appearance containing either 72 uglinaclotide, 
145 ug linaclotide, or 290 ug linaclotide.
Rescue medication will not be provided; however, patients may  use any  laxative, 
suppository , or enema that they  choose when at least 72 hours have passed since their 
previous BM or when their sy mptoms become intolerable. Laxative, suppository  or 
enema use must be documented with all other concomitant medication use in the eCRF.
9.4.2 Identity of Investigational Products
All investigational product will be supplied in bottles containing 35 capsules and will be 
labeled with the following content: protocol number, storage information, warning 
language (“Caution: New Drug -Limited by  Federal L aw to Investigational Use .Keep Out

9.4.3 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups
After a patient signs the ICF at the fi rst screening visit, study  personnel will register the 
patient in the I WRS, and the sy stem will assign the patient a sequential patient 
identification number. The first patient to sign the I CF at each site will be assigned the 
first number in the sequence by the s ystem.  
 
 
 
The study  center must contact the I WRS at the Screening Visit and at investigational 
product dispensing visits; the IWRS will assign the kit number for the investigational 
product to be dispensed to the patient at the first Treatment Period visit (Visit 2) and at 
other visits as designated on the Schedule of Evaluations ( Section 2.0). 
This is an open -label (unblinded) study , with IBS -C patients init ially assigned to receive 
290 ug linaclotide and CIC patients assigned to receive 145 ug. Patients who experience 
intolerable AEs during open -label phase will be randomized into a Double -blind 
Treatment Period via the IWRS and will receive dose regimens sp ecific to each 
indication as described in Section 9.4.4.
9.4.4 Selection of Dosages in the Study
The linaclotide dosages chosen for the open- label phase of this study  (145 ugand 290 ug)
have been shown to be safe and effective in adults for treatment of IBS -C (290 ug) and 
CIC (145 ug ) and are approved in North America at those doses for those indications. 
Data from the pivotal clinical studies showed that for patients in bo th patient populations 
treated with linaclotide, diarrhea was the most frequent AE, reported in 20% for 
IBS-Cpatients treated with 290 uglinaclotide and in 16% for CI C patients treated with 
145 ug linaclotide, and was the most common reason for discontinuation (5%). In the 
majority  of cases, onset of the diarrhea occurred within the first 2 weeks of treatment, and 
the diarrhea was generally mild to moderate (being assessed as severe in only  2% of 
linaclotide -treated patients in each patient population). 
Patients with intolerable AEs that may  be related to the use of linaclotide will be 
randomized to receive double -blind 290 ug, 145 ug , or 72 ug linaclotide oral capsules for 
IBS-C; and 145 ug or 72 ugfor CI C. Patients who experience further intolerable AE s 
after the randomization can be transitioned to open- label 72 ug linaclotide. 
Forest Research Institute, Inc. Page 38 of 101
APPROVED 05 Oct 2015Amended Protocol LIN-MD-10 Amendment 2

The 72 ugdose was selected as part of the dose regimen during the double -blind phase 
for patients with intolerable AEs as it demonstrated efficacy  in Phase 2b IBS -C and CI C 
studies, particularl y related to improvement of bowel symptoms, with a nimproved safet y 
profile compared to higher doses. 
9.4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient
All investigational product will be administered orally  as a single dail y dose in the 
morning at least 30 minutes before the first meal of the day .
Patients who meet all eligibility  criteria at Day 1 (Visit 2) will be dispensed 1bottle 
(assigned b y IWRS) containing 35capsules of investigational product . Additional bottles 
of investigatio nal product will be dispensed at subsequent visits per the Schedule of 
Evaluations (Section 2.0). Patients will be instructed to return an y unused investigational 
product at the next study  visit.
Patients must have fasted for at least 2 hours before arrivi ng at the site for Day 1 
(Visit 2). Patients will take their initial dose of investigational product (1 capsule) at the 
study  center during Day 1 (Visit 2) after all study  eligibility  criteria have been confirmed. 
On all subsequent day s, the patient will t ake 1 capsule of investigational product in the 
morning at least 30 minutes before breakfast. If, for an y reason, it is inconvenient for a 
patient to take linaclotide in the morning, the dose may  be taken at another time during 
the day  with the I nvestigato r’s prior approval and documentation, as long as linaclotide is 
taken on an empt y stomach or at least 2 hours after a meal.
Should an intolerable AE occur and, in the Investigator’s judgment, the patient is unable 
to resume investigational product dosing a fter 7 day s, the Investigator must contact the 
Study  Physician to discuss the patient’s continued participation in the study 
9.4.6 Blinding
Randomization only  occurs for those patients who experience intolerable AEs that may  
be related to the use of linaclotide and undergo intervention ( Section 9.1). For those 
patients, a list of patient randomization codes will be generated b y Statistical 
Programming at the Sponsor or de signee, and implemented by  the I WRS vendor (an 
electronic version will be stored on a secure server). This list will identify  each patient b y 
randomization number and include the patient’s corresponding treatment assignment.

APPROVED 05 Oct 2015Amended Protocol LIN-MD-10 Amendment 2
9.4.7 Unblinding
In the open- label a nd double -blind treatment phases, bottles of linaclotide will be 
dispensed that include on the label: contains either 72 ug linaclotide, 145 uglinaclotide, 
or 290 ug linaclotide. During the open- label treatment phase both the Investigator and 
patient will be made aware of the dose contained in the I WRS -assigned bottle.
Unblinding procedures are applicable to the double- blind treatment phase only .
Any unblinding (performed only  via IWRS) at a study  center should be done only  in an 
emergency  that requires the investigational product to be identified for the medical 
management of the patient. The Investigator must notify  the Study  Physician immediately  
(see Appendix II ),and a full written explanation must be provided if the blind is broken. 
Before the investi gational product is unblinded, every attempt should be made to discuss 
the case with the Study Physician. Breaking the code at the study center will immediately 
disqualify  the patient from further participation in the study .
Treatment codes may  be broken b y the Patient Safety Department at Forest Research 
Institute, Inc., for regulatory  reporting purposes. In such cases, the study  staff will be kept 
blinded, and the patient will not need to be disqualified from the stud y.
In an emergency , the Investigator c an obtain the treatment assignment of any  patient at 
his or her study site through the IWRS.
9.4.8 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
All ongoing medicines taken by  the patient at the time of screening and prior to first dose 
of investigational product will be recorded as prior medications. An y changes in 
concomitant medicines or new medicines added will be recorded in the eCRF. 
Concomitant medicines will be recorded at stud y visits throughout the entire study  
(beginning at Visit 1) including the Follow -up Perio d (Visits 9 - 11).
The concomitant medicines listed below are prohibited from the Screening Visit until the 
end of the Treatment Period ( Appendix III ):

APPROVED 05 Oct 2015Amended Protocol LIN-MD-10 Amendment 2

During the Follow -up Period there are no concomitant medication restrictions.
9.4.9 Monitoring Treatment Compliance
Investigational -product compliance during the Treatment Period will be monitored by  
counting the number of capsules dispensed and returned. Patients will be instructed to 
return all investigational product and bottles at specified visits defined in the Schedule of 
Evaluations ( Section 2.0). Before new investigational product is dispensed at the 
specified visits,every  effort will be made to collect all unused investigational product.
9.5 EFFICACY AND SAFETY VARIABLES
9.5.1 Primary Outcome Assessment
Assessments of total anti- linaclotide antibodies will be used to determine the primary  
outcome parameter , the presence of ADAs. The p resence of anti -linaclotide antibodies 
will be determined b y a validated assay.    
9.5.1.1 Immunogenicity Assessments 
Blood will be collected for determination of ADAs to linaclotide at the Day  1 Visit 
(Visit 2) prior to the patient receiving investigational prod uct (to acquire a baseline), and 
at all scheduled study visits during the Treatment Period. For patients who prematurel y 
discontinue, blood samples should be obtained within 7 day s of the last dose of 
linaclotide, and follow -up blood samples as described in the Schedule of Evaluations 
(Section 2.0) should be obtained for patients who are ADA positive at the last visit.
Blood samples collected for ADA determinations will be anal yzed in batches; therefore 
real-time repor ts of ADA results will not be available.   
Investigators and patients will remain blinded throughout the stud y as to ADA status. 
Patients who develop positive or increased ADA titers will not be withdrawn from 
treatment; investigators will continue such p atients on therapy  as they  would any  patient 
in the study .Clinical symptoms of hy persensitivity  such as anaph ylactic shock, 
angioedema, skin rash, and urticaria require treatment withdrawal even without ADA 
results available at the time of occurrence. 
Each individual sample will be assay ed and categorized as one of the following:
○ADA positive
○ADA negative
○ADA undetermined (sample lost, damaged ,or out of specifications) 
Forest Research Institute, Inc. Page 41 of 101
APPROVED 05 Oct 2015Amended Protocol LIN-MD-10 Amendment 2
A sample is only  considered ADA positive if the screening and confirmatory  assay  both 
indicate the presence of ADAs. A sample indicating the presence of ADAs by  the 
screening assay  that cannot be confirmed (eg, insufficient sample, lab oratory error) will 
be considered ADA undetermined.
ADA-positive patients will be split into two groups at the end of the study; treatment -
related ADA and non –treatment -related ADA. A treatment -related ADA is any patient 
who is ADA negative at baseline and becomes ADA positive at one or more time points 
in the study (treatment induced ADA), or who is ADA positi ve at baseline and has a 
titer increase greater than or equal to 4- times the baseline titer at one or more time 
points in the study (treatment boosted ADA). A non–treatment -related ADA positive 
patient is any patient who is ADA positive at baseline and is either ADA negative or 
has a titer less than 4- fold the baseline titer at any time point in the study.
Patients with treatment -related ADAs detected at the end of the Treatment Period 
(52weeks visit or early termination visit) will be followed at 4 months (Visit 10) and, if 
needed, up to a maximum of 8 months (Visit 11), or until they are ADA negative or 
their titers revert to baseline. Any patient who is ADA negative or has non –treatment -
related ADA at the end of the treatment period (52 weeks or ET) does not require 
follow up regardless of ADA status at any other time during the study. In order to 
minimize the number of ADA-undetermined results, patients whose serum samples 
from theWeek 52 EOS/ET Visit (Visit 8) are lost, damaged, or out of specification may 
be called for an unscheduled visit to obtain another sample.
In order to show reversion to baseline for treatment- related ADA -positive patients who 
require follow up, 1 negative sample or 1 sample showing a return to an ADA titer less 
than 4-fold the baseline titer is required. Patients with treatment- related ADAs who 
complete the study or terminate early will be requested to return for additional follow -
up visits to provide blood samples for ADA assessments at 4 and 8 months to document 
persistence of positivity or reversion to baseline. No further visits will be required after 
the 8-Month Follow -up Visit (Visit 11). Patients previously ADA positive who have 
become ADA negative or have reverted back to within 4 -fold their baseline titer at the 
4-Month Follow-up Visit will not be required to complete the 8 -Month Follow -up Visit. 
Investigators will be notified of the ADA status following patient completion or ET and 
before the 1- month follow -up phone call to the patient.
Samples will be banked for up to 10years in case further testing for isoform, subform ,
and/or linaclotide concentration is requested. Consent for storage and further testing will 
be obtained from patients. 
In cases of SAEs, ADA status can be reported to both patients and investigators if
requested and felt to be necessary  for the medical care of the patient. If the blind is 
broken, the patient must be withdrawn from treatment.

The study  Sponsor will contract with Q-Squared Solutions BioSciences LLC for ADA 
testing.
The testing methods wil l be the following: 
Screening a ssay for the presence of anti-linaclotide antibodies: c ustom bridging 
ELISA with electrochemiluminescence detection. Positive results in the screening 
assay  will be confirmed by  competitive displacement of the anti-linaclotide antibodies 
with free linaclotide using the same assay . A sample is considered ADA negative if it 
is negative in either the screening or confirmatory assays. A sample is considered 
ADA positive if it is positive in the confirmatory assay   
ADA positive serum will be titered and assay ed for neutralizing antibodies and cross 
reactivit y with the endogenous hormones, guan ylin and uroguany lin

9.5.4 Safety Assessments
9.5.4.1 Adverse Events
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily  have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or 
disease temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product (ICH -E2A). 
Forest Research Institute, Inc. Page 45 of 101
APPROVED 05 Oct 2015Amended Protocol LIN-MD-10 Amendment 2

For the purpose of the site’s data collection responsibilities, any  untoward event that was 
reported from the time the pa tient signed the ICF until 30 day s after the last known dose 
of investigational product , until ADA positive status for antibod y positive patients has 
reverted to ADA negative , or until the end of the Follow- up Period (whichever is later), is 
to be consider ed an AE.
Examples of AEs are as follows:
Changes in the general condition of the patient
Subjective sy mptoms offered by  or elicited from the patient
Objective signs observed by  the Investigator or other study  site personnel
All diseases that occur after s igning inform consent, including an y change in severity 
or frequency  of pre -existing disease
All clinically  relevant abnormalities in laboratory  values or clinicall y relevant 
physical findings that occur during the study  schedule
Please note that medical procedures scheduled prior to consenting, but occurring during 
the study  should not be captured as AEs, but should be listed in the medical history  if 
related to a pre -existing condition.

9.5.4.3 Severity Assessment
The Investigator will provide an assessment of the severit yof each AE b y recording a 
severit y rating on the appropriate AE reporting page of the patient’s eCRF. Severity,
which is a description of the intensity  of manifestation of the AE, is distinct from 
seriousness, which implies a patient outcome or AE -require d treatment measure 
associated with a threat to life or functionalit y (Section 9.5.4.4). Severit y will be assessed 
according to the following scale:
Mild: The AE was an anno yance to the patient but did not further hinder 
baseline functioning; the AE may  have been intermittent or continuous.
Moderate: The AE caused the patient to experience some discomfort or some 
interference with normal activities but was not haza rdous to health; 
prescription drug therap y may have been emplo yed to treat the AE.
Severe: The AE caused the patient to experience severe discomfort or severel y 
limited or prevented normal activities and represented a definite hazard to 
health; prescriptio n drug therap y and/or hospitalization may have been 
employ ed to treat the AE.
9.5.4.4 Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death
Is life threatening
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of exis ting hospitalization
Results in a persistent or significant incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability
to conduct normal life functions, or
Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
Important medical events that may  not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may  be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, 
they may  jeopardize the patient or subject and may  require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definit ion. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in patient 
hospitalization, or the development of investigational product d ependency  or drug abuse. 
Forest Research Institute, Inc. Page 48 of 101
APPROVED 05 Oct 2015Amended Protocol LIN-MD-10 Amendment 2
Emergency  room visits that do not result in hospitalization should be evaluated for one of 
the other serious outcomes to determine whether they  qualify  as SAEs.
Preplanned hospitalizations (eg, elective procedures for pre- existing conditions that did 
not worsen, such as cosmetic surgery  and hy sterectomy ) are excluded from SAE 
reporting.
9.5.4.5 Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
At each visit, patients are to be queried regarding any  AEs or SAEs that have occurred 
since the previous visit. Patients will be asked to volunteer information with a nonleading 
question such as, “How do y ou feel since your last visit?” Study  site personnel will 
record all pertinent information in the patient’s eCRF. Any AEs reported in diaries will
also be reported on the relevant eCRF page.
All AEs must be recorded on the appropriate AE reporting page of the patient’s eCRF 
whether or not they  are considered causally  related to the investigational product.
For every  AE, the Investigator must:
Provid e an assessment of the seriousness of the event (ie, is it an SAE?), as well as 
the severit y and causal relationship
Document all actions taken with regard to the investigational product
Detail an y other treatment measures taken for the AE
Document the out come of the AE
In addition, patients are to be reminded, as described in the I CF and in accordance with 
Section 9.5.4.1, to notify  site personnel of a ny AEs occurring up to 30 day s after the last 
known dose of linaclotide, or for ADA positive patients, until the end of the 8 -month 
Follow -up Period. An y AEs reported b y the patient (or patient representative) during this 
period are to be recorded in original source documents. AEs are also to be recorded in the 
eCRF if at least 1 of the following conditions is met: 1) the event meets the criteria for an 
SAE (see Sections 9.5.4.4 and 9.5.4.6), and/or 2) the event is considered b y the 
Investigator to be potentially  causall y related to investigational product.
Any AEs that are ongoing at the time of the final protocol -defined stud yvisit will be 
followed until the condition returns to prestud y status, has resolved or stabilized, or can 
be explained as being unrelated to the investigational product. If a follow -up visit is 
deemed necessary  for appropriate safet y surveillance, it will take place within 30 day s of 
the final protocol -defined study  visit.

APPROVED 05 Oct 2015Amended Protocol LIN-MD-10 Amendment 2
9.5.4.6 Immediate Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
The Sponsor is required to inform worldwide regulatory  authorities of SAEs that meet 
specific criteria. Therefore, the Sponsor must be not ified immediately  regarding an y SAE 
that occurs after informed consent is obtained.
Within 24 hours of learning of an y AE that meets one of the criteria for an SAE, the 
study  site personnel must report the event to Forest Patient Safety  on the SAE Form for
Clinical Studies. The Sponsor’s Study  Physician may  also be notified by  telephone.
If, during follow -up, any  nonserious AE worsens and eventuall y meets the criteria for an 
SAE, that AE should be recorded as a new SAE. 
The site must transmit the SAE Form for Clinical Studies to the SAE fax number shown 
below. Even if an initial report is made b y telephone, the SAE Form for Clinical Studies
completed with all available details must still be faxed within 24 hours of knowledge of 
the event at the stud y site.
Supplemental information should be submitted as soon as available and may  include 
laboratory  results, radiology  reports, progress notes, hospital admission and emergency  
room notes, holding and observation notes, discharge summaries, autops y reports, and 
death certificates.
The Investigator is expected to take all therapeutic measures necessary  for resolution of 
the SAE. Any medications or procedures necessary  for treatment of the SAE must be 
recorded on the appropriate pages of the patient’s eCRF. All SAEs are to be followed b y 
the study  staff until resolution or until the SAE is deemed stable. The Sponsor may 
contact the study site to solicit additional information or follow up on the event.
Fax the SAE Form for Clinical Studies to Forest Research Institute, Inc.

9.5.4.7 Reporting of Pregnancies That Occur During the Study
Study  site personnel must report a pregnancy  from the time the patient signs the I CF until 
30 day s after the last dose of investigational product. Within 24 hours of learning of the 
pregnancy , the study  site personnel must report the event to Forest Patien t Safet y on the 
Clinical Study  Pregnancy Form and fax it to the SAE/Pregnancy fax number stated in 
Section 9.5.4.6, even if no AE has occurred. Pregnancies in female partners of male 
patients occurring during the time frame described above must also be reported.

APPROVED 05 Oct 2015Amended Protocol LIN-MD-10 Amendment 2

The pregnancy  must be followed to term and the outcome reported by  completing a 
follow -up Clinical Study  Pregnancy  Form. If the pregnanc y is associated with an SAE 
(eg, if the mother is hospitalized for hemorrhage), a separate SAE Form for Clinical 
Studies must be filed as described in Section 9.5.4.6 with the appropriate serious criterion 
(eg, hospitalization) indicated in addition to the Pregnancy Form.

9.6 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE
9.6.1 Data Monitoring
Before an y patient enters the study , a representative of Forest Research Institute, I nc., 
will meet with the I nvestigator and the stud y-site staff to review the procedures to be 
followed during the study. Electronic data capture (EDC) functionalit y training is 
provided via computer -based training to train Investigators and authorized designees on 
recording the data i
n the eCRFs using the electronic data capture EDC s ystem. After the 
first patient is enrolled, the Forest representative, a Regional Site Manager (RSM) or 
designee, will periodically monitor the progress of the study  by conducting on -site visits. 
This RSM or designee will review query statuses remotely, possibl y warranting more 
frequent communication and/o r site visits with the Investigator and the study  site staff. 
The Investigator will make available to the RSM or designee source documents (written 
notes and electronic medical records, if used), signed consent forms, and all other study -
related documents. The Investigator and the stud y-site staff will be responsible for data 
entry  of patient data into the eCRFs via the EDC system, resolving data queries generated 
via the EDC sy stem and providing missing or corrected data. The Investigator or 
designee will be responsible for approving all changes performed on the data, and 
endorsing the patient data within the EDC sy stem. This approval method will include 
applying an electronic signature linked to a uniquely  assigned username and password 
that together will represent a traditional handwritten signature.

APPROVED 05 Oct 2015Amended Protocol LIN-MD-10 Amendment 2

9.6.2 Data Recording and Documentation
Data collection will involve the use of the Forest EDC sy stem, to which o nly authorized 
personnel will have access. Patient’s data are to be entered into the EDC system b y the 
Investigator or designee using their assigned EDC user account. After data entry  into the 
EDC sy stem by  the Investigator or designee, a combination of ma nual and programmatic 
edit checks will be used to review the data for completeness, logic, and adherence to 
study  protocol. As a result of these edits checks, data monitoring and reviews ,queries 
may be electronicall y issued to the site and should be answe red electronically  via the 
EDC sy stem.
Each query  will carry  identify ing information (assigned username, date, and time) to 
assist Forest and the Investigator on the origin of the data clarification request and the 
response provided b y the Investigator. All data changes made to the patient’s data via a 
data query  will be approved by  the Investigator prior to final database lock.
After all data have been reviewed and all issues have been resolved, the database will be 
locked.
All data collected in the contex t of this study  will be stored and evaluated per regulatory  
requirements and applicable guidance for electronic records. Also, data will be stored and 
evaluated in such a way  as to guarantee patient confidentiality  in accordance with the 
legal stipulations apply ing to confidentiality  of data. Study  records (eg, copies of eCRFs , 
laboratory  reports, patient diaries, regulatory  documents, etc.) will be retained at the site, 
along with adequate source documentation, according to FDA and ICH requirements. All 
study records must be available for inspection by  Forest Research Institute, I nc., its 
authorized representatives, and the FDA or other health authorities .

CANCER AND OTHER COL ONOSCOPY 
REQUIREMENTS
Note: Patient may  be enrolled if no follow -up colonoscopy after poly p removal is due while 
participating in the study .
1.Patients age 50 years (40 years if African American) and older must have had a 
colonoscopy  with negative findings within the 10 years prior to the Screening Visit 
(Visit 1).
2.If the most recent colonoscopy revealed hyperplastic polyps that were entirely 
removed, the patient may be enrolled, provided the colonoscopy  was performed 
within 10 y ears prior to the Screening Visit (V isit 1).
3.If the most recent colonoscopy revealed 2 or fewer small (<1 cm) adenomatous 
polyps with tubular structure with low grade dysplasia and without appreciable 
villous tissue, the patient may be enrolled, provided the colonoscopy was 
performed within 5 years prior to the Screening Visit (V isit 1). 
4.Patients who have 1first-degree relative with colorectal cancer or adenomatous 
polyps diagnosed before age 60 or 2 first-degree relatives with colorectal cancer 
diagnosed at any age must have had a colonoscopy with negative findings 5 years 
before the Scr eening Visit (Visit 1). This applies to patients who are 40 years or 
older and to patients younger than 40 years ,who are 10 or fewer years from the 
age at which their youngest relative was found to have 1of the aforementioned 
conditions .
5.Patients who ha ve 1first-degree relative with colorectal cancer or adenomatous 
polyps diagnosed at age 60 or older or 2second -degree relatives with colorectal 
cancer diagnosed at any age must have had a colonoscopy with negative findings 
within 10 years prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1). This applies to patients who 
are 40 y ears or older and to patients y ounger than 40 y ears,who are 10 y ears or 
fewer y ears from the age at which their youngest relative was found to have 1of 
the aforementioned conditions. 
Other Colonoscopy Requirements:
Patients of any  age who have alarm symptoms must have had a colonoscopy with
negative findings after the onset of the alarm symptoms and within 5 years prior to the 
Screening Visit (Visit 1). Alarm symptoms include lower GIbleeding (rectal bleeding or 
heme -positive stool), iron -deficiency  anemia, and weight loss. (Note: Current 
unexplained or clinically significant alarm symptoms are exclusionary.)
These requirements are adapted based on recent Guidance on Colorectal Cancer Screening 
(Levin et al, 2008; Lieberman et al, 2012; Quaseem et al, 2012).

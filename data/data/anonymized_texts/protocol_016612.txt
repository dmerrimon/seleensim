SCHEMA  
PROTOCOL TITLE:  A phase II study of daily alternating Thalidom ide and Lenalidomide therapy plus rituximab 
(THRiL) as initial treatment for patients with CLL. 
  
STUDY DRUGS: Revlimid®, lenalidomide 
Thalomid®, thalidomide Rituxan®, rituximab 
INDICATION: Untreated CLL patients 
STUDY PHASE: Phase II 
BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE:  
While CLL lymphocytes demonstrate impa ired apoptosis in vivo, they undergo spontaneous apoptosis ex vivo, even 
when cultured with cytokines that maintain normal and othe r malignant B lymphocytes.  These data are often taken as 
evidence of CLL lymphocyte dependency upon cell surface derive d signals (either cytokine or cell to cell mediated 
interactions) for survival. Thalidomide and lenalidomide ar e proprietary IMiD™ compounds of Celgene Corporation. 
These immunomodulatory agents are thought to work, in part , through similar mechanisms involving the inhibition of 
cytokine networks and alteration of adhesion molecules [1-2 ].  Both thalidomide and lenalidomide have shown activity 
as single agents and in combination with chemotherapy for th e treatment of patients with CLL [3-6].  Treatment with 
thalidomide, studied first given its earlier development, was limited by its toxicities of  neuropathy, sedation, and 
constipation.  While lenalidomide demonstrates increased poten cy and tolerability compared with thalidomide, its use is 
complicated by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, tumor flar e, and tumor lysis syndrome [4, 6] and there are ongoing 
studies addressing these issues. 
Our hypothesis is that treatment of CLL with an alternating daily dosing schedule of thalidomide and lenalidomide may 
result in better tolerability by decreasing each agent’s toxicities, while preserving efficacy, a nd therefore lead to longer 
duration of therapy and improved responses than has been  accomplished with either agent alone.  Additionally, the 
combination of thalidomide and lenalidomide may have  additive or synergistic effects therapeutically. 
STUDY OBJECTIVES: 
Primary:    
To assess the response rate (overall, complete, and pa rtial) in patients with CLL receiving initial treatment
with thalidomide, lenalidomide, and rituximab.
Secondary:    
To determine the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of combining thalidomide, lenalidomide, and rituximab as 
initial treatment for patients with CLL requiring therapy.
To evaluate duration of response, time to respons e, progression free survival, and overall survival
To perform correlative studies to determine the pot ential mechanism of action of how thalidomide and
lenalidomide are affecting CLL lymphocytes.

STUDY DESIGN: 
This is an open label, phase II, single arm, and single ins titution study investigating daily alternating therapy with the 
IMiD™ compounds, thalidomide and lenalidomide, plus rituxi mab in untreated CLL patients requiring treatment.  In 
order to obtain correlative samples, patients will receive a tw o week course of single agent thalidomide or lenalidomide 
before beginning treatment with the combination regimen.  Ha lf of the patients (odd numbered subjects) will start with a 
two week course of single agent thalidomide and the other half of the patients (even numbered subjects) will start with a 
two week course of single agent lenalidomide.  This will allow the study of correlative samples of monotherapy with either IMiD™ agent.  In Cycle -1, half of the patients (odd numbered subjects) will receive thalidomide 50mg PO daily on days 1-14, followed by no treatment days 15-28.  The other half of the patients (even numbered subjects) will receive 
lenalidomide PO daily on days 1-14, followed by no treatment  days 15-28.  Starting cycle 1, patients will receive 
thalidomide 50 mg every other day (every odd day on days 1-28: Days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25 & 27 
of a 28 day cycle) alternating with lenalidomide on altern ate every other day, dosed based upon current level with 
stepwise incremental dosing (every even day on days 1-28: Days  2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16,  18, 20, 22, 24, 26 & 28 of a 
28 day cycle).  The starting dose of lenalidomide will be  based on calculated creatinine clearance and the dose of 
lenalidomide may be escalated as tolerated to maximal dose of 25 mg (see Section 5 for details).  Rituximab 375 mg/m
2 
will be administered on days  1, 8, 15 and 22 starting with Cycle 1 and then again on the same weekly x 4 schedule every 6
th cycle through Cycle 19 (Cycles 7, 13, and 19).

2. BACKGROUND 
 
2.1  Introduction 
 
Lenalidomide and thalidomide ar e proprietary IMiD™ compounds of Celgene Corporation.  IMiD™ 
compounds have both immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic properties which could confer antitumor and antimetastatic effects.  Lenalidomide has been demonstrated to possess anti-angiogenic activity through inhibition of bFGF, VEGF and TNF- alpha induced endothelial cell migration, due at 
least in part to inhibition of Akt phosphorylation re sponse to bFGF [7].  In  addition, lenalidomide has 
a variety of immunomodulatory eff ects.  Lenalidomide stimulates T cell proliferation, and the 
production of IL-2, IL-10 and IFN-gamma, inhibits  IL-1 beta and IL-6 and modulates IL-12 
 
2  production [8].  Up regulation of T cell derived IL-2 production is ach ieved at least in part through 
increased AP-1 activity [9]. 
 
Although the exact antitumor mechanism of ac tion of lenalidomide is unknown, a number of 
mechanisms are postulated to be responsible for the activity of lenalidomide seen against multiple 
myeloma.  Lenalidomide has been shown to increase T cell proliferation, which leads to an increase in 
IL-2 and IFN-gamma secretion.  The increased level of these circulating cytokines augment natural killer cell number and function, and e nhance natural killer cell activity to yield an increase in multiple 
myeloma cell lysis [10].  In addition, lenalidomide has direct activity against multiple myeloma and 
induces apoptosis or G1gr owth arrest in multiple myeloma cell lines and in multiple myeloma cells of 
patients resistant to melphalan, doxorubicin and dexamethasone [11]. 
 
2.2  Indications and Usage  Revlimid
® (lenalidomide) is indicated for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia 
due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodyspl astic syndromes associated with a deletion 5q 
cytogenetic abnormality with or without additiona l cytogenetic abnormalities.  Revlimid® is also 
approved in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma 
that have received at least one prior therapy.   Thalomid® (thalidomide) is indicated for the treat ment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple 
myeloma in combination with dexamethasone.   
Rituxan
® (rituximab) is indicated for the treatment of  patients with: Relapsed or refractory, low-
grade or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL as a single agent,  Previously untreated follicular, 
CD20-positive, B-cell NHL in combination with CVP chemotherapy,  Non-progressing (including 
stable disease), low-grade, CD20-positive B-cell NHL, as a single agent, after first-line CVP chemotherapy and  Previously untreated diffuse large B-cell, CD20-positive NHL in combination with CHOP or other anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens.  
 
 
2.3  Adverse Events 
 Most frequently reported adverse events reporte d during clinical studies with lenalidomide in 
oncologic and non-oncologic indications, regardless of presumed relationship to study medication 
include: anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia a nd pancytopenia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting 
and diarrhea, dehydration, rash, itching, infections , sepsis, pneumonia, UTI, Upper respiratory 
infection, cellulites, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, chest pain, 
weakness, hypotension, hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia, back pain, bone pain, generalized pain, 
dizziness, mental status changes, syncope, re nal failure, dyspnea, pleural effusion, pulmonary 
embolism, deep vein thrombosis, CVA, convulsions, dizziness, spinal cord compression, syncope, disease progression, death not specified and fractur es. Tumor flare reaction (TFR) has been reported 
frequently in CLL patients treated with lenalidomid e.  Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) has been reported 
in CLL patients treated with lenalidomide.  Pr ecautions must be taken to prevent TLS including 
proper selection of patients with regard to renal function, correction of elect rolyte abnormalities, and 
 
3  TLS prophylaxis and monitoring.  Lenalidomide has b een shown to increase the level of digoxin in 
the blood in some patients 
 
Complete and updated adverse events  are available in the Investigational Drug Brochure and the IND 
Safety Letters. 
 
2.4  Overview of CLL 
 Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most  common leukemia in North America, with an 
estimated 15,000 new cases dia gnosed in the United States in 2007 [12].  CLL is typically a disease of 
advanced age, with a median age at diagnosis of approximately 65 years, and a male-to-female ratio 
of 2:1 [13].  CLL is characterized by the clonal e xpansion of long-lived, mature B lymphocytes that 
co-express the CD5, CD19, and CD23 surface antigens [14-15].  The malignant cells of CLL are 
frozen in the G0 stage of the cell cycle, increasing in numbers due more to a lack of apoptosis than 
augmented proliferation [16-21].  The morbidity and mortality associated with CLL results primarily 
from the progressive accumulation of lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid tissues and bone marrow.  
Patients might remain asymptomatic for prolonged periods of time, but most develop disease progression, with 70% of CLL patients dying from causes related to their disease [22]. 
 
Overall, patients with CLL have a median life expect ancy of almost nine years, but great variability 
exists depending upon several well described pr ognostic markers [23].  Traditional prognostic 
markers include stage [24-25], age [26], gender [ 26], pattern of bone marrow involvement [27-28], 
lymphocyte doubling time [29-30], number of circ ulating prolymphocytes [31-32], and beta-2-
microglobulin level [33-34].  More recently, prognostic  markers have been identified that are based 
more on the biological features of the malignant  lymphocytes themselves.  These novel prognostic 
markers include: IgVH mutational status [35-36], CD38 expression [36], zap-70 expression [37], and 
interphase FISH (iFISH) abnormalities [38]. 
 
Criteria initially described by the National Cancer  Institute Working Group (NCI-WG) on CLL [14], 
and updated by the International Workshop on CLL (IWCLL) [15], describe the indications for 
initiation of therapy for patients with CLL as: evidence of progressive marrow failure as evidence by anemia or thrombocytopenia (Rai stage III or IV), massive or symptomatic splenomegaly, massive or 
symptomatic lymphadenopathy, progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of more than 50% over a 2-month period or a lymphocyte doubling time of less than 6 months, autoimm une cytopenias poorly 
responsive to corticosteroids, or the presence of  B symptoms (fevers greater than 38.0, unintentional 
weight loss >10% in six months, signi ficant fatigue, or night sweats) [15]. 
 
The first chemotherapy treatments proven to be of be nefit for patients with CLL were alkylator based 
regimens, with or without steroids.  For untreat ed patients, response rates range from 50-80%, but 
these include few complete remissions and a 5-year survival of approximately  50% [39-40] [41] [42-
43].  In the late 1980s, the nucleoside analogs, fl udarabine [44-49], 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine [50-51], 
and pentostatin [52-53], emerged as effective ther apies for CLL.  Based upon the very high response 
rates apparent in early clinical trials, fludarabine has received the most interest.  Fludarabine produces 
response rates of approximately 70-80% in previ ously untreated patients, including a complete 
response rate of up to 30%.  In previously treated  patients, response rates to fludarabine of 50-70% 
are seen, including a 67% response rate in patients who received fludarabine as their initial therapy 
[44-49].  By combining fludarabine with rituxima b [54-55] or cyclophosphamide plus rituximab [56-
 
4  57], response rates as high as 90-95% can be ach ieved.  Two additionally approved agents for 
treatment of CLL include alemtuzumab and bendamu stine.  Alemtuzumab, originally approved for 
fludarabine refractory CLL with overall response rate s of 33% [58], has also received FDA approval 
in untreated CLL patients with an overall response rate of 83%, including a CR rate of 24% [59].  
Bendamustine, approved in 2008 for all lines of treat ment of CLL, can generate an overall response 
rate of 68% and a CR rate of 30% in untreated patients with CLL [60]. 
 
Once a patient has progressed on fludarabine, few therapeutic options remain.  Fludarabine 
retreatment offers a possible option for some patie nts, with overall response rates of 67%, but a CR 
rate of only 20% [45].  Once a pa tient becomes refractory to fludarabine, the median overall survival 
is only nine to ten months [61-62].  Alemtuzumab, initially approved for patients whose disease is 
refractory to fludarabine, demonstrated 33% response rates, but an overall survival of only 16 months 
[58].  Ofatumumab, a novel antibody directed agains t CD20, is currently undergoing testing in these 
patients, with preliminary overall response rates of 51% in fludarabine-refractory patients that 
progress after alemtuzumab and 44% in fludarabi ne-refractory patients with bulky lymphadenopathy 
that are unlikely to respond to alemtuzumab [63].  Unfortunately, the overall survival for the two 
groups was 14 and 15 months, respectively.  
2.5  Rational for Treatment in this Setting 
 While CLL lymphocytes demonstrat e impaired apoptosis in vivo, they undergo spontaneous apoptosis 
ex vivo, even when cultured with cytokines that maintain normal and other malignant B lymphocytes. 
 These data are often taken as evidence of CLL lymphocyte dependency upon cell surface derived 
signals (either cytokine or cell to cell mediated interactions) for survival.  Numerous cognate and non-cognate pathways that may play vital roles in CLL cell survival have been identified, including 
CD40-CD154, VEGF, bFGF, BAFF/BLyS, APRIL, TNF-al pha, IL-4, and IL-10 [64-83].  Agents that 
alter or inhibit these cytokine networks may be able to play an important role in CLL therapy. 
 
Thalidomide and lenalidomide are immunomodulatory agents that are thought to work, in part, 
through the inhibition of cytokine networks and alteration of adhesion molecules, including multiple TNF family members [1-2].  One of the early rati onales for testing thalidomide as a therapy for CLL 
were data suggesting a role for TNF-alpha in CLL cell survival [79-81] and the ability of thalidomide 
to inhibit TNF-alpha production [84] .  Subsequent work has demonstrated additional mechanisms of 
action for thalidomide [85-87].  Clinical studies i nvolving thalidomide, alone and in combination with 
chemotherapy, confirmed its activity as a therapy for CLL [3, 5].  Unfort unately, treatment with 
thalidomide was limited by its toxicities of neuropathy, sedation, and constipation.  
 
Lenalidomide, developed by chemically modifying thalidomide, demonstrates improved efficacy and 
tolerability compared with thalidomide, although its use is still limited by its toxicities of neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, tumor flare, and tumor lysis syndrome [4, 6, 88].   Given the likely similar mechanisms  of action for thalidomide and le nalidomide and that  the toxicities 
of both agents are dose related, alternate daily dos ing of these agents would provide continuous anti-
tumor effect, while utilizing a lower dose of each of  the agents.  The alternating daily dosing of 
thalidomide and lenalidomide may result in better tolerability by potentially decreasing each agent’s 
toxicities, lead to longer duration of therapy and result in improved responses than has been 
accomplished with either agent alone.  Additionally, the combination of thalidomide and lenalidomide 
 
5  may have additive or synergistic effects therap eutically.  The tolerability of thalidomide and 
lenalidomide used in combination has been dem onstrated in studies of patients with multiple 
myeloma [89-90]. 
 
The potential tolerability and response rate of a re gimen combining thalidomide, lenalidomide, and 
rituximab make it an ideal treatment for patients w ith CLL early in the course of their disease.  
Positioning such a regimen early in the treatment al gorithm enables agents with greater toxicities to 
be delayed until required, helping preserve the patient’s quality of life for as long as possible. 
 
This phase II study would investigate the combinati on of thalidomide, lenali domide and rituximab in 
patients with untreated CLL.  Patients will rema in on the treatment regimen as long as they do 
demonstrate disease progression or toxicity.

9  mechanisms of action of thalidom ide and lenalidomide.  Daily alte rnating IMiD™ agent therapy will 
begin with cycle 2 as follows: 
 Cycle -1: half of the patients (odd numbere d subjects) will receive thalidomide 50 mg 
PO daily on days 1-14, followed by no treatment  days 15-28 and the other half of the 
patients (even numbered subjects) will recei ve lenalidomide PO daily on days 1-14, 
followed by no treatment days 15-28.  Th e lenalidomide dose will be based on 
baseline calculated creatinine clearance*. 
 Cycles 1 and all escalation cycles: Patients will receive thalidomide 50 mg (every 
ODD  day on Days 1-28 of a 28 day cycl e: Days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 
25 & 27) with lenalidomide (every EVEN day on Days 1-28 of a 28 day cycle: Days 
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26 & 28). Each cycle will be 28 days in 
length.  Patients who received lenalidomide during Cycle -1 will receive the same dose of lenalidomide starting with Cycle 1.  For patients who did not receive lenalidomide during Cycle -1, lenalidomide will be initiated at a starting dose based 
on baseline calculated creatinine clearance*.   
 Cycle 1: Patients will also receive rituximab 375 mg/m
2 IV on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 
(+/- 2 days) and then again on the same weekly x 4 schedule every 6th cycle through 
Cycle 19 (Cycle 7, 13, and 19).   
 
**** Rituximab can be given +/- 2days.   ****All correlative work must be drawn prior to Rituximab administration regardless of the day 
Rituximab is given. 
 
 
*The lenalidomide starting dose will be based on baseline calculated creatinine clearance as 
follows:  
Lenalidomide Starting Dose Based on Renal Function at Study Entry 
Baseline Calculated Creatinine 
Clearance (by Cockcroft-Gault) Starting Lenalidomide Dose 
 60 ml/min 5 mg every EVEN day during Days 1 – 28 of each 28-
day cycle** 
 30 and < 60 ml/min 5 mg every 2nd EVEN day during Days 1 - 28 of each 
28-day cycle** 
**For patients who receive lenalidomide during Cycle -1, the lenalidomide dose during Cycle -1 
will be at the dose indicated above (5 mg every other day or 5 mg  every 2nd EVEN day depending 
on baseline calculated creatinine clearance) taken daily on Days 1 – 14 of the 28-day cycle. 
 
10  At investigator discretion, the lenalidomide dose may be gradually increased in a step-wise 
manner (in 5 mg increments) at the start of any subsequent 28-day treatment cycle beginning with the start of Cycle 2, if the patient tolerated the prior treatment cycle without requiring dose modifications, interruptions or delays due to toxicity.  For patients who initiate therapy at a lenalidomide 5 mg every 2
nd EVEN day starting dose, the first dose titration would be to 
lenalidomide 5 mg every EVEN day, and subsequent dose titrations would be permitted in 5 mg increments.  The lenalidomide dose may only be increased at the start of a new cycle of therapy, may only be increased once every 28 days (or less frequently), and may only be increased if the prior treatment cycle was completed without requi ring dose modifications, interruptions or delays 
due to toxicity.  For patients who initiate treatment at lenalidomide 5 mg based on baseline calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 60ml/min, the maximum allowable dose is lenalidomide 25 mg 
every EVEN day during Days 1-28 of a 28-day cycle.  For patients who initiate treatment at lenalidomide 5 mg every 2
nd EVEN day due to baseline calculated creatinine clearance ≥  
30ml/min but < 60ml/min, the maximum allowable dose is lenalidomide 15 mg every EVEN day 
during Days 1-28 of a 28-day cycle. 
 
5.2  Investigational Study Drug Combination (THRIL) 
Starting with Cycle 1:   
A cycle is 28 days:  
Thalidomide 50 mg every ODD day, days 1-28 every 28 days 
Lenalidomide every EVEN day, days 1-28 every 28 days at the dose indicated above and with 
possible dose escalation as described in 5.1.    Rituximab 375 mg/m
2 IV on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 (+/- 2 days) starting with Cycle 1 and then again on 
the same weekly x 4 schedule every 6th cycle through Cycle 19 (Cycles 7, 13, and 19).   
Responses will be assessed at monthly intervals using the response criteria outlined by the IWCLL 
update of the 1996 NCI-Working Group criteria.  Patients will remain on treatment until they 
demonstrate disease progression or unacceptable toxicit y.  It will be important for the investigator to 
differentiate disease progression from tumor flare.  While no strict criteria can be established for this 
distinction, rapid changes in  clinical status that occur within four weeks of a dose escalation are likely 
to be tumor flares and should be treated as such. 
Tumor flare has been described with both thali domide and lenalidomide treatment.  Therefore, 
patients should be monitor closely for signs and sy mptoms of tumor flare for four weeks after each 
increase in dose.  Prophylaxis for (TFR) is not recommended.  Grade 1 TFR may be treated with 
NSAIDs (i.e. ibuprofen 400-600 mg orally  every 4-6 hours as needed).  TFR ≥ Grade 2 may be 
treated with corticosteroids.  Narcotic analgesics may be added as needed for pain control in subjects 
experiencing ≥ Grade 2 tumor flare.  If corticosteroid s are used, the following dosage schedule is 
 
11  recommended: prednisone 20 mg PO QD x 7 days followed by 10 mg PO QD x 7 days.  (See 
Appendix D: Cairo Bishop Tumor Lysi s Definition and Grading Criteria.) 
 
5.3 Visit schedule and assessments 
Screening Assessments and all on study scheduled vi sits and assessments are outlined in Section 10 
Table of Study Assessments. 
At treatment discontinuation, subjects will under go off study evaluations per the Schedule of 
Assessments, Section 10.   In addition, a safety assessment will be done approximately 28 days post 
the last dose of study drug.  Follow-Up contact with  the subjects should occur at a minimum of sixth 
months.  
5.4 Drug Administration 
 5.4.1 Dosing regimen 
 Cycle -1: patients will receive thalidomide 50 mg PO daily on days 1-14 or lenalidomide 
PO on days 1-14, followed by no treatment days 15-28, as described previously in 5.1.   
 Cycle 1 and subsequent cycles: Patients will receive thalidomide 50 mg (every ODD  day 
on days 1-28 of a 28 day cycle) with lenalidomide (every EVEN day on days 1-28 of a 28 
day cycle), as described previously. Each cycle will be 28 days in length.     
 Cycle 1: Patients will also receive rituximab 375 mg/m
2 IV on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22  and 
then again on the same weekly x 4 schedule every 6th cycle through Cycle 19 (Cycle 7, 13, 
and 19), as described previously.   
Patients unable to tolerate either thalidomide or le nalidomide will be removed from protocol.  Patients 
unable to tolerate rituximab can continue on with  protocol treatment without additional rituximab 
being administrated.   
Dosing of thalidomide and lenalidomide should be at bedtime in order to allow for the sedative effects 
of thalidomide to not cause daytime somnolence and to maintain regular dosing intervals.  Only 
enough lenalidomide for one cycl e of therapy will be supplied to the patient each cycle. At the 
start of any non-clinic visit treatment cycles subs equent to Cycle 24, one cycle of study drug will be 
shipped to the subject. 
See Section 5.5 for allopurinol a nd oral hydration requirements as prophylaxis against tumor lysis 
syndrome (TLS). Thalidomide and lenalidomide capsules should be  swallowed whole, and should not be broken, 
chewed or opened.    If a dose of thalidomide or lenalidomide is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same 
day.  If it is missed for the entire day, it should not be made up. 
 
12  Patients who take more than the prescribed dose of  thalidomide or lenalidomide should be instructed 
to seek emergency medical care if needed and contact study staff immediately. 
Subjects experiencing adverse events may need study treatment modifications (See section 5.6). 
 5.4.2 Record of administration 
Accurate records will be kept of all st udy drug administration (including dispensing 
and dosing) will be made in the source documents. At all times, when dispensing 
study drug, research center personnel will re view the instructions, printed on the 
packaging, with subjects. Subjects will be aske d to maintain a diary to record the drug 
administration. Subjects will be asked to bring any unused study drug and empty study 
drug containers to the research center at their next visit.  Research personnel will 
count and record the number of used and unused study drug capsules at each visit and reconcile with the patient diary. At the star t of any non-clinic visit treatment cycles 
subsequent to Cycle 24, the packaging instru ctions will be reviewed with subjects by 
telephone call, and study drug and medication log will be shipped to the subject. 
 
5.5  General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
 5.5.1 Recommended Concomitant Therapy   
Subjects should receive full supportive care, including transfusions of blood and blood 
products, antibiotics, and antiemetics when appr opriate.  Starting with  Cycle   -1 and 
while on study, subjects will receive prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia 
(with Bactrim DS thrice weekly or equivale nt), varicella zoster (with valacyclovir 500 
mg daily or equivalent), tumor lysis syndrome (with allopurinol and 8-10 eight ounce glasses of  fluid daily), and thrombosis (with aspirin 81 mg daily). 
Patients intolerant to or unable to take allopurinol beyond the first 2 cycles and can 
maintain adequate oral hydration are still elig ible to continue to receive treatment on 
study.  Patients who cannot take allopurinol fo r at least the first 2 cycles are to be 
removed from study. 
Treating physicians must watch for signs of tumor lysis syndrome.  It is recommended 
that all patients with signs of significan t tumor lysis syndrome be hospitalized for 
monitoring, aggressive fluid management, and possible rasburicase. 
 Hematopoietic Growth Factors 
Myeloid growth factors (G-CSF and pegfilgra stim only) may be used.  GM-CSF may 
not be used given the theoretical impact  it might have on CLL disease activity.  
Erythropoietic Stimulating Agents (ESAs; Aranesp, Procrit) may be used at the 
discretion of the treating physician and need to be recorded in the medication list. 
 
13    Anticoagulation Considerations 
Patients already on aspirin or other anticoagulation should remain on the current 
anticoagulation dosing regimen they are on.  If they are not on anticoagulation, then they should initiate prophylaxis with aspiri n 81 mg or 325 mg daily on Day 1 of Cycle 
-1.  Dose is at the discretion of the Inves tigator.  Coumadin or low molecular weight 
heparin may be utilized in patients that are intolerant to ASA. 
If prophylactic anti-coagulation is used, it should be held for platelet counts < 
50,000/mm
3 and then restarted when platelet counts are above this level. 
   Tumor Lysis Syndrome Prophylaxis (allopurinol and hydration) 
Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), characterized by hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and 
hyperphosphatemia resulting from the rapid release of potassium, uric acid, and 
phosphate, has been reported in CLL patient s treated with lenalidomide necessitating 
TLS prophylaxis including allopurinol and oral hydration.  The risk of TLS is highest during the first cycle of therapy and may be elevated when lenalidomide is re-started after treatment interruptions or when the lenalidomide dose is escalated. 
If patients are intolerant or unable to ta ke allopurinol beyond the first 2 cycles AND 
can maintain adequate hydration, it will be up to the discretion of the Investigator if 
patient can continue the treatment plan.  Patients who cannot take allopurinol for at 
least the first 2 cycles are to be removed from study. Allopurinol 300 mg daily beginning at least 3 days before the start of Cycle -1,  
continuing through any cycle of lenalidomide escalation and continuing
, at least for 
one additional cycle post escalation as TLS prophylaxis is required for all subjects.    
Subjects should be instructed to maintain  adequate hydration and maintain urinary 
output as an additional measure to prevent TLS.  To maintain fluid intake, subjects 
should be instructed to drink 8 to 10 eight ounce glasses of fluid each day for the first 
14 days of Cycle -1 and Cycle 1 and any subsequent cycle of lenalidomide escalation.  Hydration levels should be adjusted according to age and clinical  status, and lowered 
if the subject’s cardiovascular status i ndicates the possibility of volume overload.  
Within the first 3 cycles of therapy, add itional oral hydration should be considered 
concurrent with any dose escalation (or re-e scalation, if permitted) of treatment, or 
when treatment is restarted after having been held for any reason. 
Based on a patient’s reaction and laborat ory parameters, TLS prophylaxis may be 
continued or restarted as needed at the Investigator’s discretion. 
 
 
14     Treatment and Dose Modification for Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
All subjects meeting criteria of laboratory TLS or ≥ Grade 1 TLS according to the 
Cairo-Bishop Definition of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (see Appendix D) should receive 
vigorous intravenous hydration and should be considered for rasburicase therapy as 
needed to reduce hyperuricemia, until correction of electrolyte abnormalities.   
 In cases of laboratory TLS and Grad e 1 TLS (see Appendix D: Cairo-Bishop 
Definition of Tumor Lysis Syndrome), lenalidomide and thalidomide will be 
continued at the same dose without interruption or dose reduction.  TLS 
prophylaxis measures outlined in Sec tion 5.5.1 should be continued or re-
instituted. 
 Subjects with ≥ Grade 2 TLS (see Appendix D: Cairo-Bishop Definition of Tumor 
Lysis Syndrome) will be managed as follows in addition to intravenous hydration and consideration for rasburicase therapy (above).   
o Hold (interrupt) treatment. 
o First episode: restart lenalidomide and thalidomide at the current dose with appropriate TLS prophylaxis (Section 5.5 .1) after resolution of electrolyte 
abnormalities to Grade 0.   
o Subsequent episodes: restart lenalidomide and thalidomide with appropriate TLS prophylaxis (Section 5.5 .1) after resolution of electrolyte 
abnormalities to Grade 0.  At physician discretion, the doses of lenalidomide and thalidomide may be restarted at the current dose or the dose of lenalidomide and/or thalidomid e may be reduced by 1 dose level.  
o First or subsequent episodes: subj ects should be closely monitored for 
signs of TLS after resuming treatment.  To monitor for TLS, serum chemistry and uric acid tests should be performed at least every week 
following initiation of treatment for 4 consecutive weeks and on Day 3 or 
4 following initiation of treatment.  See Section 10, Schedule of Study 
Assessments, for additional specifics regarding serum chemistry and uric acid testing.  
 
   Tumor Flare Reaction 
Prophylaxis for (TFR) is not recommended.  Grade 1 TFR may be treated with 
NSAIDs (i.e. ibuprofen 400-600 mg orally every 4-6 hours as needed).  TFR ≥  Grade 
2 may be treated with corticosteroids.  Narcotic analgesics may be added as needed for 
pain control in subjects experiencing ≥ Grade 2 tumor flare.  If corticosteroids are 
used, the following dosage schedule is recommended; prednisone 20 mg PO QD x 7 
 
15  days followed by 10 mg PO QD x 7 days. Give n the potential for tumo r flares to occur 
at each escalation of lenalidom ide dose, prednisone treatment may be repeated at each 
occurrence of tumor flare.  Patients experi encing tumor flares should not have their 
dose of lenalidomide escalated the subsequent cycle. 
Tumor flare occurring during a cycle when the dose of lenalidomide or thalidomide 
was escalated should be recorded as an a dverse event and not as progressive disease 
(PD).  For tumor flare occurring after the fi rst 2 weeks of any cycle of lenalidomide 
escalation, it is up to the discretion of the physician to differentiate tumor flare from 
progression.  It is expected that some degree of tumor flare reaction is likely until the 
patient is on the maximum dose of lenalidomid e for more than four weeks.  Because 
of this and the typically indolent nature of CLL, investigators are encouraged to 
continue escalating a subject’s lenalidomide dose if safe and not to determine a patient as having progressive disease until after they have been on the maximum dose of 
lenalidomide for more than four weeks. 
  
 5.5.2 Prohibited concomitant therapy 
Concomitant use other anti-cancer therapies, including radiation, or other 
investigational agents is not permitted wh ile subjects are receiving study drug during 
the treatment phase of the study.  Corticostero ids may be administered for treatment of 
a tumor flare reaction as detailed above.    
 
5.6  Duration of Therapy and Criteria for Removal From Study  
 
 Treatment will continue until the occurrence of any of the following events.   
 Disease progression (excluding tumor flare) 
 Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of  the Investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out continuation of the treatment regimen. 
 Discontinuation of thalidomide or lenalidomide for any reason.  (Note, patients 
who are unable to tolerate rituximab infusions may still continue on the protocol.) 
 Major violation of the study protocol. 
 Withdrawal of consent 
 Lost to follow up 
 Death 
 Suspected pregnancy or positive pregnancy 
 
5.7 Duration of Follow Up  
Subjects who discontinue treatment for any reas on will be followed for 30 days. At 28 days post 
treatment, subjects will undergo a safety assessmen t.  In addition, off study evaluations per the 
Schedule of Assessments, Section 10 will be done. 
 
 
16  6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
6.1 Dose Reduction and Escalation Steps  
Doses of the agent believed to be the cause of the AE should be held until resolution of the AE (see 
Section 6.3 for detailed dose modification instructions). 
Table 1 below is used for step-wise dose titration of lenalidomide and for dose reductions of 
lenalidomide or thalidomide.  In all cases, dose modifications should be applied one Dose Level at a 
time.  Please see Section 5.1 for dose escalation criteria and other details. 
 
 
Table 1: Dose Levels 
Lenalidomide 
Dose Level -2 * 5 mg every 3rd EVEN day on Days 1-28 of a 28 day cycle * 
Dose Level -1*** 5 mg every 2nd EVEN day on Days 1-28 of a 28 day cycle  
Dose Level 1** 5 mg every EVEN  day on Days 1-28 of a 28 day cycle 
Dose Level 2 10 mg every EVEN   day on Days 1-28 of a 28 day cycle  
Dose Level 3 15 mg every EVEN  other day on Days 1-28 of a 28 day cycle   
Dose Level 4 20 mg every EVEN  other day on Days 1-28 of a 28 day cycle   
Dose Level 5 25 mg every EVEN  other day on Days 1-28 of a 28 day cycle   
Thalidomide  
Dose Level -1 50 mg every 2nd ODD day on Days 1-28 of a 28 day cycle  
Dose Level 1 50 mg every ODD day on Days 1-28 of a 28 day cycle  
 
Lenalidomide 5 mg every 3rd even day is the minimum lenalidomide dose.  Lenalidomide will be discontinued in patients 
who cannot tolerate this dose.  However, patients who experience toxicity requiring dose reduction while receiving 
lenalidomide 5 mg every 3rd even day may, at the discretion of their physicia n, have their dose held until toxicity resolves 
as described in Sections 6.2 and 6.3, and then restart lenalidomide at 5 mg every 3rd even day.  If the same toxicity recurs 
at lenalidomide 2.5 mg every second even day, consid eration should be given to discontinuing lenalidomide. 
 
** For lenalidomide, Dose Level 1 is the starting dose for patients that have a baseline creatinine clearance ≥ 60ml/min 
(along with thalidomide Dose Level 1). 
*** For lenalidomide, Dose Level -1 is the starting dos e for patients that have a baseline creatinine clearance ≥ 30ml/min 
and < 60ml/min (along with thalidomide Dose Level 1).  
 
Lenalidomide dose escalation is permitted in a step-wise manner per Table 1.  Please see Section 
5.1 for dose escalation criteria and other details. 
 
6.2  Instructions for Initiation of a New Cycle  
A new course of treatment may be gin on the scheduled day 1 of a new cycle utilizing the same criteria 
as outlined for dose modifications in sections 6.3, table 2. 
 
17   The ANC is ≥ 1000/mm³; if ANC is between 500-1000/mm3 and not associated with 
fever > 38.5°C, the new cycle should start as planned and G-CSF or pegfilgrastim may 
be used to support neutrophil count.   
 The platelet count is ≥ 25,000/mm³;  
 Any drug-related rash that may have occurred has resolved to ≤ grade 1 severity; 
 Any drug-related neuropathy that may have occurred has resolved to < grade 2 in 
severity; 
 Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) has not exceeded grade 1 severity during previous cycle 
(see Appendix D: Cairo-Bishop Definition of Tumor Lysis Syndrome); 
 If TLS ≥  grade 2 during previous cycle (see A ppendix D: Cairo-Bishop Definition of 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome), electrolyte  abnormalities have resolved to ≤ grade 0 severity; 
 Any other drug-related adverse events that  may have occurred have resolved to ≤ 
grade 2 severity.  
 
If these conditions are not met on Day 1 of a new cy cle, the subject will be evaluated weekly and a 
new cycle of treatment will not be initiated until the t oxicity has resolved as described above.  If the 
dose of lenalidomide or thalidomide was reduced during the previous cycle, and the cycle was 
completed without requiring further dose modification, th en the next cycle will start at the same doses 
of lenalidomide and thalidomide as given at the end of the previous cycle.  If lenalidomide or 
thalidomide dosing was omitted for the remaind er of the previous cycle due to toxicity 
attributed to lenalidomide or thalidomide or if  the new cycle is delayed due to lenalidomide-
related or thalidomide-related toxicity newly encountered on the scheduled Day 1 , then the   new 
cycle will be started with a one-level dose re duction of lenalidomide or thalidomide based on 
attribution. 
Instructions for dose modifications or interruption  
Dose delay and dose reduction rules are as follows and in the table below. 
 Lenalidomide and thalidomide dose reduction steps are outlined in Section 6.1.   
 For treatment interruptions during a cycle, the 28-day schedule of each cycle will continue to 
be followed.  Missed doses of lenalidomide or thalidomide are not made up.   
 For treatment interruptions that delay the schedul ed start of a new cycle, when toxicity has 
resolved as required to allow the start of a ne w cycle (Section 6.2), the restart day of therapy 
becomes Day 1 of the next cycle. 
 
 
18  Dose re-escalation of lenalidomid e following dose reductions due to neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, 
tumor lysis syndrome, tumor flare, rash, neuropathy, hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism: 
 If the dose of lenalidomide has been reduced for neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, rash, 
neuropathy, lenalidomide dose re-escalation is permitted if the subject completes one full 
cycle without experiencing any toxicity that  requires dose interruption or reduction.  The 
lenalidomide dose may be increased by one dose level at the initiation of a new cycle of 
therapy.   
 If the dose of lenalidomide has been dose re duced for tumor lysis syndrome, lenalidomide 
dose re-escalation is permitted if the subject completes one full cycle without experiencing a 
laboratory TLS or ≥  Grade 1 TLS (see Appendix D: Cair o-Bishop Definition of Tumor Lysis 
Syndrome), unless the subject requires a dose interruption/reduction for other toxicity.   
 If the dose of lenalidomide has been dose re duced for tumor flare, lenalidomide dose re-
escalation is permitted if the subject completes one full cycle without experiencing ≥ Grade 1 
tumor flare, unless the subject requires a dose interruption/reduction for other toxicity.   
 The dose of lenalidomide will be reduced for hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism as outlined 
in Table 2.    
 Serum chemistry and uric acid should be closely monitored for signs of laboratory or clinical 
TLS (see Appendix D: Cairo- Bishop Definition of Tumor Lysis Syndrome) following 
lenalidomide dose re-escalation (see Section 2, Schedule of Study Assessments, for details regarding serum chemistry and uric acid monitoring).   
 TLS prophylaxis with allopurinol and hydrati on as described in Section 5.5.1 should be 
considered with each dose re-escalation.

 If rash development is related to a r ituximab infusion, restart treatment as 
scheduled at the previous doses  once toxicity resolves to ≤ grade 1. 
 If the development of the rash is not re lated to a rituximab infusion, and the 
rash is purpuric, vasculitic, or bullous, or possibly the result of Stevens-
Johnson Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis, the patient will be 
discontinued from the study. 
 If the development of the rash is not related to a rituximab infusion and inconsistent with Stevens - Johnson sy ndrome, the clinician may re-institute 
therapy once the toxicity resolves to ≤ grade 1.  Re-institute lenalidomide 
monotherapy at a one dose level reduction.   If no recurrence of the rash occurs after one week, then restart th alidomide monotherapy at 50 mg every 
other day.   Further dose escalation of the lenalidomide will be at the discretion of the treating physician per guidelines in Section 6.2. 
 
 Discontinue treatment and remove patient from study.

weekly.  Omitted doses are not made up.. 
 Restart lenalidomide, thalidomide, and / or rituximab therapy at discretion of 
investigator, if the toxicity resolves to ≤ grade 2 and consider dose reduction of 
most likely causative agent. 
* Lenalidomide 5 mg every 3rd even day is the minimum lenalidomide dose.  Lenalidomide will be discontinued 
in patients who cannot tolerate this  dose.  However, patients who expe rience toxicity requiring dose reduction 
while receiving lenalidomide 5 mg every 3rd even day may, at the discretion of their physician, have their dose 
held until toxicity resolves as described in Sections 6.2 and 6.3, and then restart lenalidomide 5 mg every 3rd even 
day.  If the same toxicity recurs at lenalidomide 5 mg  every 3rd even day, consideration should be given to 
discontinuing lenalidomide. 
 
21  Treatment Compliance 
At all times, when dispensing protocol therapy, res earch center personnel will review the instructions, 
printed on the packaging, with subjects. Subjects will be asked to maintain a medication log to record 
the drug administration. Subjects will be asked to bring any unused drug and empty drug containers to 
the research center at their next visit.  Research  personnel will count and record the number of used 
and unused drug at each visit and reconcile with the patient medication log.  Any unused Thalomid® 
(thalidomide) or Revlimid® (lenalidomide) should be returned to the patient for disposition in accordance with the STEPS® and RevAssist® programs. At the start of any non-clinic visit treatment 
cycles subsequent to Cycle 24, the packaging instructions will be reviewed with subjects by telephone call, and study drug and medication log will be shipped to the subject.  
 
7. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS   
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and repor ting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The investigator 
will be required to provide appropriate informati on concerning any findings that suggest significant 
hazards, contraindications, side effects, or precau tions pertinent to the safe use of the drug under 
investigation.  Safety will be monitored by eval uation of adverse events reported by patients or 
observed by investigators or research staff, as we ll as by other investigations such as clinical 
laboratory tests, x-rays, electrocardiographs, etc.  
 
7.1  Adverse Event Characteristics   
 
 CTCAE term (AE descri ption) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales 
found in the revised NCI Common Term inology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE  reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE version 
4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site (http://ctep.cancer.gov). 
 
 Attribution  of the AE: 
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment. 
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment. 
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment. 
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment. 
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment. 
   
7.2  Recording of Adverse Events 
 
All adverse events will be recorded on a patie nt specific adverse event log.  The AE log 
will be maintained by the research staff and kept in the patient’s research chart.     
 
7.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
 7.3.1  Definition of SAE 
  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Definition  
A serious adverse event is one that at any dose (including overdose): 
 
22   Results in death 
 Is life-threatening1 
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity2 
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 Is an important medical event3 
 Positively identified pregnancy 
1“Life-threatening” means that the subject was at i mmediate risk of death at the time of the serious 
adverse event; it does not refer to a serious adverse event that hypothetically might have caused death if 
it were more severe. 
2“Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” m eans that there is a substantial disruption of a 
person’s ability to carry out normal life functions. 3Medical and scientific judgment should be exerci sed in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in situations where none of the outcome s listed above occurred.  Important medical events 
that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above 
should also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the deve lopment of drug dependency or drug abuse.  A new 
diagnosis of cancer during the course of a treatment should be considered as medically important. 
 
 7.3.2  Adverse Event Reporting 
Toxicity will be scored using CTCAE Version 4.0 for toxicity and adverse event 
reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE Version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP homepage (HTTP://CTEP.INFO.NIH.GOV).  All appropriate areas should have 
access to a copy of the CTCAE Version 4.0.  All adverse clinical experiences, whether observed by the investigator or reported by th e patient, must be recorded, with details 
about the duration and intensity of each episode, the action taken with respect to the test drug, and the patient’s outcome.  The investigator must evaluate each adverse 
experience for its relationship to the test drug and for its seriousness. 
The investigator must appraise all abnormal laboratory results for their clinical 
significance.  If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator must provide details about the action taken with respect to the test drug 
and about the patient’s outcome. 
 
 7.3.3 Pregnancies 
 
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (inc luding a positive pregnancy test regardless 
of age or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on IP (Investigational Product), or within (insert time-frame which must be at least 28 days 
 
25   If the event is unexpected AND definitely or probably related to the study, 
complete the IRB Unexpected, Study-related Adverse Events, Incidents, and Information Reporting Form.  This form should be submitted within 24 hours of investigator notification of the event. 
 If the event is expected OR possibly or unrelated to the study, only the SAE Cover Sheet must be completed.  These events will be reported to the IRB at the time of continuing renewal on the Adverse Event & IND Safety Reporting Cumulative Table. 
 
Forms may also be downloaded from the IRB website at: 
http://www.med. cornell.edu/research/for_pol/ins_rev_boa.html 
 
 
7.8 Adverse event updates / IND safety reports 
Celgene shall notify the Investigator via an IND Safety Report of the following information:  
 Any AE associated with the use of study drug in this study or in other studies that is 
both serious and unexpected. 
 Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human 
subjects including reports of mutagenic ity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity. 
 The Investigator shall notify his/her IRB/EC promp tly of these new serious and unexpected AE(s) or 
significant risks to subjects. 
 The Investigator must keep copies of a ll AE information, including correspondence with 
Celgene and the IRB/EC, on file (see Section 12.1 for records retention information). 
 
8. PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
8.1  Lenalidomide 
8.1.1   Chemistry 
REVLIMID
® (lenalidomide), a thalidomide analogue, is an immunomodulatory agent 
with anti-angiogenic properties.  The chemical name is 3-(4-amino-1-oxo 1,3-dihydro 
-2H-isoindol-2-yl) piperidine-2,6-dione and it has the following chemical structure:  
Chemical Structure of Lenalidomide 
 NNHOO
O
NH2 
 
26  3-(4-amino-1-oxo 1,3-dihydro-2H -isoindol-2-yl) piperidine-2,6-dione 
The empirical formula for lenalidomide is C 13H13N3O3, and the gram molecular weight 
is 259.3.  
Lenalidomide is an off-white to pale-yello w solid powder. It is soluble in organic 
solvent/water mixtures, and buffered aqueous solvents. Lenalidomide is more soluble 
in organic solvents and low pH solutions . Solubility was significantly lower in less 
acidic buffers, ranging from about 0.4 to 0.5 mg/ml. Lenalidomide has an asymmetric 
carbon atom and can exist as the optically active forms S(-) and R( +), and is produced 
as a racemic mixture with a net optical rotation of zero. 
REVLIMID® (lenalidomide) is available in 5 mg and 25 mg capsules for oral 
administration.  
 
 8.1.2 Clinical Pharmacology 
Mechanism of Action:  
The mechanism of action of lenalidomide remains to be fully characterized. 
Lenalidomide possesses immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties.  Lenalidomide inhibited the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  Lenalidomide inhibited cell proliferation w ith varying effectiveness (IC50s) in some 
but not all cell lines.  Of cell lines teste d, lenalidomide was effective in inhibiting 
growth of Namalwa cells (a human B cell lymphoma cell line with a deletion of one 
chromosome 5) but was much less effective in inhibiting growth of KG-1 cells (human 
myeloblastic cell line, also with a deletion of one chromosome 5) and other cell lines 
without chromosome 5 deletions.  Lena lidomide inhibited the expression of 
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) but not COX-1 in vitro.   
 
 8.1.3 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism: 
 Absorption: 
Lenalidomide, in healthy volunteers, is rapi dly absorbed following oral administration 
with maximum plasma concentrations occurring between 0.625 and 1.5 hours post-
dose. Co-administration with food does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC) but 
does reduce the maximal plasma concentr ation (Cmax) by 36%. The pharmacokinetic 
disposition of lenalidomide is linear. Cmax  and AUC increase proportionately with 
increases in dose. Multiple dosing at th e recommended dose-regimen does not result 
in drug accumulation. 
Pharmacokinetic sampling in myelodyspl astic syndrome (MDS) patients was not 
performed. In multiple myeloma patients maximum plasma concentrations occurred 
 
27  between 0.5 and 4.0 hours post-dose both on Da ys 1 and 28.  AUC and Cmax values 
increase proportionally with dose following single and multiple doses. Exposure 
(AUC) in multiple myeloma patients is 57% higher than in healthy male volunteers.  
Pharmacokinetic Parameters: 
Distribution: 
In vitro (14C)-lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins is approximately 30%. 
Metabolism and Excretion: The metabolic profile of lenalidomide in humans has not been studied. In healthy 
volunteers, approximately two- thirds of lenalidomide is eliminated unchanged through 
urinary excretion. The process exceeds the glom erular filtration rate and therefore is 
partially or entirely active.  Half-life of elimination is approximately 3 hours.  
 
 8.1.4 Supplier(s) 
Celgene Corporation will supply Revlimid® (l enalidomide) to study participants at no 
charge through the RASP program (RevAssist® for Study Participants).  See 
Appendix G.   
 
 8.1.5 Dosage form 
 Lenalidomide will be supplied as 5 mg and 25 mg capsules for oral administration.   
 
 8.1.6 Packaging 
Lenalidomide will be shipped on a per subject basis by the contract pharmacy to the 
clinic site.   Bottles will contain a suffi cient number of capsules for one cycle of 
dosing .    
   
 8.1.7 Storage
 
Lenalidomide should be stored at room temp erature away from direct sunlight and 
protected from excessive heat and cold.     
  
 8.1.8 Special Handling Instructions  
Females of childbearing potential should not handle or administer  lenalidomide unless 
they are wearing gloves. 
   8.1.9 Prescribing Information  
Lenalidomide (Revlimid®) will be provided to  research subjects for the duration of 
their participation in this trial at no char ge to them or their insurance providers.  
Lenalidomide will be provided in accord ance with the Celgene Corporation’s 
Revlimid REMS® program.  Per standard Revlimid REMS® program requirements,  
 
28  all physicians who prescribe le nalidomide for research subjects enrolled into this trial, 
and all research subjects enrolled into this trial, must be registered in, and must 
comply with, all requirements of the Revlimid REMS® program.   
Only enough lenalidomide for one cycle of th erapy will be supplied to the patient each 
cycle. 
 
8.1.10 Pregnancy Testing    
Pregnancy tests for females of childbearing potential.  A female of childbearing 
potential (FCBP) is a  sexually mature female who: 1) has not undergone a 
hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2)  has not been naturally postmenopausal 
for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months). 
 
Pregnancy tests must occur within 10 – 14 days and again within 24 hours prior to 
prescribing lenalidomide for Cycle 1 (prescri ptions must be filled within 7 days).  
FCBP with regular or no menstruation must have a pregnancy test weekly for the first 28 days and then every 28 days while on therapy (including breaks in therapy); at discontinuation of lenalidomide and at Day 28 post the last dose of lenalidomide.  
Females with irregular menstruation must have  a pregnancy test w eekly for the first 28 
days and then every 14 days while on th erapy (including breaks in therapy), at 
discontinuation of lenalidomide and at Day 14 and Day 28 post the last dose of 
lenalidomide (see Appendix A: Risks of  Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing 
Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control Methods).
    
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test 
regardless of age or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on lenalidomide, or within  28 days of the subject’s last dose of lenalidomide, are considered immediately reportable events. Lenalidomide  is to be discontinued immediately. The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by facsimile or email using the Pregnancy Initial Report Form. The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist, preferably one experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.  The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must notify Celgene Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow-up Report Form.  If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion), the Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by facsimile, or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form. 
 
29   
All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, any infant death after 28 days that the Investigator suspects is related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by facsimile, or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form.  
 
Male Subjects 
 
If a female partner of a male subject taking investigational product becomes pregnant, the male subject taking lenalidomide should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female partner should be advised to call their healthcare provider immediately. 
 
8.2 
 THALOMID (thalidomide)  
 
 8.2.1 Chemistry 
THALOMID(thalidomide), α-(N-phthalimido) glutarimide, is an immunomodulatory 
agent.  The empirical formula for thalidomide C ₁₃H₁₀N₂O₄ and the gram molecular 
weight is 258.2.  The CAS number of thali domide is 50-35-1.  Thalidomide is off-
white to white, nearly odorless, crystalline pow der that is soluble at 25°C in dimethyl 
sulfoxide and sparingly soluble in water and ethanol.  The glutarim ide moiety contains 
a single asymmetric center and, therefore, ma y exist in either of two optically active 
forms designated S (-) or R (+).  THALOMID (thalidomide) is an equal mixture of 
the S (-) and R (+) forms and, therefore, has net optical rotation of zero. 
Active ingredient: thalidomide.  Inac tive ingredients: anhydrous lactose, 
microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, stearic acid, colloidal anhydrous 
silica, and gelatin.  
 8.2.2 Pharmacology and Pharmacokinetics 
Clinical pharmacokinetics studies have shown that thalidomide when administered as 
a single 200 mg dose, the mean peak plasma concentration is 1.9 g/ml  0.5, 
occurring 3.3 hours  1.7 after dosing.  Mean half- life of elimination is 5.9 hours  
2.1. Single dose, dose proportionality was evalua ted over the clinical dose range, i.e., 
from 50 to 400 mg. The extent of absorption is proportional to dose, however, as the 
dose increases beyond 200 mg, a flattening of th e peak concentration is seen with a 
delay in the time to the peak concentra tion. The mean peak plasma concentration 
following a single 400 mg dose administration was 2.82 g/ml  0.80 occurring by 4.3 
 1.6 hours after the dose; mean half-life of elimination was 7.29 hours  2.62. The 
rate of absorption was also slower at the highest dose as evidenced by a rate constant 
 
30  of absorption that was approximately one-half that observed at the lower doses. 
 8.2.3 Human Toxicology 
Available data from three clinical pharmacology studies sponsored by Celgene 
Corporation showed that 38 subjects have been exposed to single doses of thalidomide 
given either on one occasion or three o ccasions with one to two week washouts 
between doses. Two studies were conducted in healthy volunteers and the third study 
was conducted in patients with Hansen’s dis ease. Thalidomide was administered in a 
50 to 400 mg single dose range. 
Based on the results of the studies, the most  frequently reported adverse experiences 
were dizziness (31 subjects or 82 %), somnol ence (29 subjects or 76%), headache (15 
subjects or 39%), and asthenia (12 subjects or 32%).  Somnolence and dizziness were 
reported to occur more frequently at doses  of 200 mg and 400 mg than they did at a 
dose of 50 mg. There was no dose relations hip evident for the remaining adverse 
experiences. 
There was no reported severity in  intensity of all adverse experiences. All events were 
mild with the exception of moderate somnol ence in 13 subjects, moderate dizziness in 
6 subjects, moderate headache in 4 subject s, moderate hypotension in 2 subjects and 
moderate constipation and moderate pallor in 2 subjects, and a single report of 
moderate asthenia, diarrhea, leg cramps, nausea and rhinitis.  There have been reports of a slowing of the heart rate. 
Thalidomide is known to cause nerve damage that may be permanent. Peripheral 
neuropathy is a common, potentially severe, side  effect of treatment with thalidomide 
that may be irreversible. Peripheral neuropa thy generally occurs following chronic use 
over a period of months, however, reports fo llowing short-term use also exist. The 
correlation with cumulative dose is unclear. Patients should be examined at monthly 
intervals for the first three months of tha lidomide therapy to enable the clinician to 
detect early signs of neuropathy, which in clude numbness, tingling or pain in the 
hands and feet. Patients should be evaluate d periodically thereafter during treatment. 
If symptoms of drug-induced neuropathy de velop, thalidomide should be discontinued 
immediately to limit further damage, if clin ically appropriate. Usually treatment with 
thalidomide should only be reinitiated if the neuropathy returns to baseline status.  
Serious dermatologic reactions including t oxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-
Johnson syndrome, which may be fatal, ha ve been reported in association with 
thalidomide therapy.  THALOMID
 should be discontinued, if a skin rash occurs and 
only resumed following appropriate clinical evaluation.  If the rash is purpuric, 
vasculitic, exfoliative, or bullous or if Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal 
necrolysis is suspected, use of THALOMID should not be resumed. 
 
31  The use in Thalidomide in Multiple Myeloma results in an increased risk of venous 
thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus. The 
risk increases significantly when thalidomid e is used in combination with standard 
chemotherapeutic agents including dexamethasone. In one controlled trial the rate of venous thromboembolic events was 22.5% in patients receiving thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone compared  to 4.9% receiving dexamethasone alone. 
Patients and physicians are advised to be observant for signs of thromboembolism. 
Patients should seek medical attention s hould they develop symptoms such as 
shortness of breath, chest pain or leg or arm swelling. Preliminary reports suggest that patients who are appropriate candidates ma y benefit from concurrent prophylactic 
anticoagulation or aspirin treatment. 
Although not reported from pre- marketing controlled clinical trials, seizures, including 
grand mal convulsions, have been reporte d during post-approval use of THALOMID
® 
(thalidomide) in clinical practice.  Because  these events are reported voluntarily from 
a population of unknown size, estimates of fr equency cannot be made.  Most patients 
had disorders that may have predisposed them to seizure activity, and it is not 
currently known whether thalidomide has any epileptogenic influence.  During 
therapy with thalidomide, patients with a history of seizures or with other risk factors for the development of seizures should be m onitored closely for clinical changes that 
could precipitate acute seizure activity. 
THALOMID (thalidomide) can cause severe birth defects in humans.    Women 
and men taking thalidomide must take special precautions and be willing and 
able to comply with all aspect s of the FDA-mandated S.T.E.P.S.
® program. (see 
Appendix A: Risks of Fetal Exposure,  Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and 
Acceptable Birth Control Methods).   
This medicine is for subject use ONL Y. IT SHOULD NOT BE SHARED WITH 
ANYONE. It should be safely stor ed.  It must be kept out of the reach of children and 
should never be given to women who are ab le to have children, and used only as 
directed by the physician. 
Subjects should not drink alc ohol or take any other medicine that has not been 
prescribed by the doctor, especially nonprescription drugs that makes the subject 
sleepy. 
 8.2.4 Formulation 
 THALOMID(thalidomide) is available in 50 mg capsules for oral administration. 
 8.2.5 Storage and Stability 
Thalidomide has been shown to be stable  for up to 36 months when stored under 
 
32  ambient   conditions. Over this time peri od, the capsules show no significant loss in 
potency and no increase in degradation produc ts. Thalidomide has been shown also to 
be stable when stored under accelerated conditions (40°C/75% Relative humidity, 3 
months). Clinical supplies should be retained in a secure, cool dry place. 
 
 8.2.6 Supplier(s) 
Celgene Corporation will supply Thalomid® (t halidomide) to study participants at no 
charge through the P-TAP (S.T.E.P.S®) program (see Appendix F).

Thalidomide will be supplied as capsules for oral administration.   
   
 8.2.8 Packaging 
Thalidomide will be shipped on a per subject  basis by the contract pharmacy to the 
clinic site.   Bottles will contain a suffi cient number of capsules for one cycle of 
dosing .    
 
 8.2.9 Special Handling Instructions 
 Females of childbearing potential should not  handle or administer  lenalidomide unless 
they are wearing gloves. 
            8.2.10 Prescribing Information 
Patients enrolled into this trial are eligib le to participate in Celgene’s Protocol 
Therapy Assistance Program (PTAP). Celg ene will provide Thalidomide to study 
patients free of charge through PTAP.  Tha lidomide (Thalomid®) will be provided in 
accordance with the S.T.E.P.S.® program of Celgene Corporation.  Per standard 
S.T.E.P.S.® requirements all physicians who prescribe thalidomide for research 
subjects enrolled into this trial, and all res earch subjects enrolled into this trial, must 
be registered in and must comply w ith all requirements of the S.T.E.P.S.® program.  
Prescriptions must be filled within 7 days.  Authorization numbers are only valid for 7 
days.  Only enough thalidomide for one cycl e of therapy will be supplied to the 
patient each cycle, but no more than a 28 day supply.  
 
Thalidomide must be prescribed through and in compliance with the S.T.E.P.S® 
program of Celgene Corporation.  Prescrip tions must be filled within 7 days.  
Authorization numbers are only valid for 7 days.  Consideration should be given to 
prescribing thalidomide 5 to 7 days in a dvance of Day 1 of each  cycle to allow time 
for required patient and prescriber surveys,  and drug shipment to patient.  Any unused 
Thalomid® (thalidomide) should be return ed to the patient for disposition in 
 
33  accordance with the S.T.E.P.S ® program. 
Only enough drug for one 28 day cycle will be supplied at a time. 
        8.2.11 Pregnancy Risk   
Thalidomide is a powerful human terat ogen, inducing a high frequency (about 30%) 
of severe and live-threatening birth defects such as: ectromelia (amelia, phocomelia, 
hemimelia) of the upper and/or lower extrem ities, microtia with abnormality of the 
external acoustic meatus (blind or absent ), middle and internal ear lesions (less 
frequent), ocular lesions (anophthalmia, mi crophthalmia), congenital heart disease, 
renal abnormalities. Other less frequent abnormalities have also been described. 
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) mu st agree to use two reliable forms of 
contraception simultaneously or to practi ce complete abstinence from heterosexual 
contact during the following time periods relate d to this study: 1) for at least 4 weeks 
before starting study drug; 2) while taking study drug; 3) during dos e interruptions and 
4) for at least 4 weeks after discontinua tion of the study drug. The two methods of 
reliable contraception must include one hi ghly effective method (i.e. intrauterine 
device (IUD), hormonal [birth control pills, injections, patch or vaginal implants], 
tubal ligation, partner’s vasectomy) and one additional effective (barrier) method (i.e. 
male condom, diaphragm, cervical cap).  Th e FCBP must be referred to a qualified 
provider of contraceptive methods if needed.  Combined hormonal contraceptives are not r ecommended due to the increased risk of 
venous thrombo-embolic disease. The choice of contraceptive methods should 
necessitate a risk/benefit discussion betw een the patient and a qualified physician 
experienced in the use of contraceptive methods. Effective measures to avoid 
pregnancy must be taken.  
Implants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an 
increased risk of infection at the time of  insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. 
Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered particularly in patients with neutropenia.  
Copper-releasing intrauterine devices are generally not recommended due to the potential risks of infection at the time of insertion and menstrual blood loss which may compromise patients with neutropenia or thrombocytopenia 
Criteria for females of childbearing potential (FCBP) 
Two categories: 
1 – Females not of childbearing potential include females who have had a natural 
menopause for at least 24 consecutive months, a hysterectomy, and/or bilateral oophorectomy 
 
34  2 – Females of childbearing potential are all other females who are menstruating, 
amenorrheic from previous medical treat ments, under 50 years of age, and/or 
perimenopausal 
           8.2.12 Pregnancy Testing    
Pregnancy tests must occur within 10 – 14 days and again within 24 hours prior to 
prescribing Thalidomide for Cycle 1 (prescri ptions must be filled within 7 days).  
FCBP with regular or no menstruation must have a pregnancy test weekly for the first 
28 days and then every 28 days while on therapy (including breaks in therapy); at discontinuation of thalidomide and at Day 28 post the last dose of thalidomide.  
Females with irregular menstruation must have  a pregnancy test w eekly for the first 28 
days and then every 14 days while on th erapy (including breaks in therapy), at 
discontinuation of thalidomide and at Day 14 and Day 28 post the last dose of thalidomide (see Appendix A: Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control Methods).
    
 
8.3 Rituximab  
 8.3.1   Chemistry 
Rituximab is a genetically engineered chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody 
directed against the CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant B-
lymphocytes. The antibody is an IgG1 kappa immunoglobulin containing murine 
light- and heavy-chain variable region sequences and human constant region 
sequences.  The Fab domain of rituxi mab binds to the CD20 antigen on B 
lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits i mmune effector functions to mediate B-
lymphocyte lysis in vitro.  Possible mechan isms of cell lysis include complement-
dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity 
(ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-
cell lymphoma line. 
 8.3.2   Pharmacology and Pharmacokinetics 
In prior studies patients treated at the 375 mg/m2 dose levels exhibited detectable 
antibody concentrations throughout the treat ment period. Most patients exhibited 
increasing pre-infusion antibody concentrations with each subsequent infusion. In nine 
patients, the T1/2 following the firs t antibody infusion was 59.8 hours (11.1-104.6 hr) 
with a Cmax of 271 μ g/ml. Following the fourth antibody infusion when circulating B 
cells had been depleted and antigenic sites coated, the T 1/2 was 174 hr (26.4-442.3 
hr) and Cmax 496.7 μg/ml. 
 8.3.3 Human Toxicology 
 
35  No dose-limiting effects were observed in the Phase I/II studies.  Reported adverse 
events including fever, chills, headache,  nausea, vomiting, rhinitis, asthenia, and 
hypotension, occurred primarily during rituximab infusions and typically responded to 
an interruption of the infusion and resumption at a slower rate.  
Fatal Infusion Reactions:  Severe and fatal cardiopulmonary events, including 
angioedema, hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates , acute respiratory distress syndrome, 
myocardial infarction, and cardiogenic shoc k, have been reported.  These severe 
reactions typically occurred during the fi rst infusion with time to onset of 30-120 
minutes. 
Cardiac Events:   Patients with preexisting cardi ac conditions, including arrhythmia 
and angina, have had recurrences of thes e cardiac events during rituximab infusions. 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome:  Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported and is 
characterized in patients with a high number of circulating malignant cells 
(≥25,000/mm3) by rapid reduction in tumor volume, renal insufficiency, hyperkalemia, 
hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperphosphatemia. Renal Events:   Rituximab has been associated w ith severe renal toxicity including 
acute renal failure requiring dialysis, and in  some cases has lead to death.  Renal 
toxicity has occurred in patients with high numbers of circulating malignant cells 
(≥25,000/mm
3) or high tumor burden who experience tumor lysis syndrome and in 
patients administered concomitant cisplatin. 
Mucocutaneous Reactions:  Severe bullous skin reactions, including fatal cases of 
toxic epidermal necrolysis and paraneoplastic pemphigus, have been reported in patients treated with rituximab.  The onset of reaction has varied from 1 to 13 weeks 
following rituximab exposure. 
Hematologic Events:   In clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 cytopenias were reported in 
48% of patients treated with rituxima b; these include: lymphopenia (40%), 
neutropenia (6%), leukopenia (4%), anemia (3%), and thrombocytopenia (2%).  The 
median duration of lymphopenia was 14 days (range, 1 to 588 days) and of 
neutropenia was 13 days (range, 2 to 116 da ys).  A single occurrence of transient 
aplastic anemia (pure red cell aplasia) and two occurrences of hemolytic anemia 
following Rituximab therapy were reported. 
In addition, there have been a limited num ber of postmarketing reports of prolonged 
pancytopenia, marrow hypoplasia, and late onset neutropenia. 
 
36  Infectious Events:   Rituximab induced B-cell depletion in 70% to 80% of patients 
with NHL and was associated with decreased serum immunoglobulins in a minority of 
patients; the lymphopenia lasted a median of  14 days (range, 1-588 days).  Infectious 
events occurred in 31% of patients: 19% of  patients had bacteria l infections, 10% had 
viral infections, 1% had fungal infections , and 6% were unknown infections.  Serious 
infectious events (Grade 3 or 4), including sepsis, occurred in 2% of patients. 
Hepatitis B Reactivation:  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reac tivation with fulminant 
hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death has been reported in some patients with 
hematologic malignancies treated with rit uximab.  The majority of patients received 
rituximab in combination with chemotherapy.  The median time to the diagnosis of 
hepatitis was approximately four months after the initiation of rituximab and approximately one month after the last dose. 
Other Serious Viral Infections:   The following additional serious viral infections, 
either new, reactivated or exacerbated, have  been identified in clinical studies or 
postmarketing reports. The majority of patie nts received Rituxan in combination with 
chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. These viral infections 
included JC virus (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML]), 
cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, pa rvovirus B19, varicella zoster virus, West 
Nile virus, and hepatitis C. In some cases, the viral infections occurred up to one year 
following discontinuation of Rituxan and have resulted in death. 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): PML is a rare and 
demyelinating disease of the brain caused by infection with the JC virus that usually 
leads to death or severe disability.  JC virus infection resulting in PML and death has 
been reported rarely in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving rituximab. The majority of these patients had received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoie tic stem cell transplant.  Cases of PML 
resulting in death have also been repor ted in patients with systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) treated with rit uximab.  These patients with SLE had 
longstanding disease, history of prio r immunosuppressant therapy, and were 
diagnosed with PML within 12 months of their last infusion of rituximab. 
Physicians should consider PML in any pa tient presenting with new onset neurologic 
manifestations. Consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture 
should be considered as clin ically indicated.  In patients who develop PML, rituximab 
should be discontinued and reductions or discontinuation of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy should be considered. 
 
37  Bowel Obstruction and Perforation:   Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction and 
perforation, in some cases leading to death, were observed in patients receiving 
Rituxan in combination with chemothera py for DLBCL. In post-marketing reports, 
which include both patients with low-grade or follicular NHL and DLBCL, the mean time to onset of symptoms was 6 days (range 1 −77) in patients with documented 
gastro-intestinal perforation. Complaints of  abdominal pain, especially early in the 
course of treatment, should prompt a t horough diagnostic evaluation and appropriate 
treatment. 
Additional Safety Signals:   The following serious advers e events have been reported 
to occur in patients following completion of rituximab infusions: arthritis, disorders of 
blood vessels (vasculitis, serum sickness a nd lupus-like syndrome), eye disorders 
(uveitis and optic neuritis), lung disorders including pleuritis and scarring of the lung (bronchiolitis obliterans), that may result in fatal outcomes, and fatal cardiac failure. 
 8.3.4   Formulation 
Rituximab is commercially available in 10 mL and 50 mL single-use vials containing 
100 mg or 500 mg rituximab solution, respec tively, at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. 
 8.3.5   Storage and Stability Intact vials should be stored under refrigeration (2°-8°C). Dilute solutions for infusion 
(1-4 mg/mL) are stable for 24 hours under re frigeration, and for an additional 24 hours 
at room temperature. The desired dose of r ituximab should be diluted in 0.9% NaCl or 
D5W to a final concentration of 1-4 mg/mL. The solution should be mixed by gently inverting the bag. 
 8.3.6   How Supplied 
Rituximab will be obtained from commerc ial stock from the non-investigational 
pharmacy and, along with its administration costs, will be billable to the patient. 
 8.3.7   Rituximab Administration Rituximab will be administered on days  1, 8, 15 and 22 starting with Cycle 1 and then 
again on the same weekly x 4 schedule ev ery 6th cycle through Cycle 19 (Cycles 7, 
13, and 19). All patients should be prem edicated with acetaminophen 650 mg and 
diphenhydramine 25-50 mg (or equivalent) 30 minutes prior to the rituximab.  
Rituximab 375 mg/m
2 will be administered by IV in fusion starting at a rate of 50 
mg/hour.  If no infusion related reactions occur, the infusion rate should be escalated in 50 mg/hour increments every 30 minutes  to a maximum of 400 mg/hour until the 
infusion is completed.  Vital signs will be  monitored every 15 minutes while infusion 
rate is being escalated.

 Prior to administration of study drug Days:  1 and 15 of Cycle 1; Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 3;q 3 cycles 
through Cycle 24(cycle 6, 9, 12, etc.); then q 6 cy cles thereafter:  CD3/CD4/CD8-T cell subsets;  
 
44  CD16/CD56- NK cells;  CD14- monocytes; CD3/CD25/F oxP3-regulatory T cells;  Circulating Endothelial 
cell precursors 
7 To include WBC, differential, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets. Hematology profiles are required weekly during Cycle 
-1 of lenalidomide-containing therapy, and during any cycl e in which the dose of lenalidomide is escalated or re-
escalated.  For subjects who are on a stable lenali domide dose (without escalation or interruption) for ≥ 1 cycle of 
treatment, hematology profiles are required on Days 1 and 15 of the cycle. 
8 To include Na, K, Cl, CO2, BUN, Cr, glu, Ca, phos, uric  acid, LDH, alkaline phosphatase , total bilirubin, ALT, AST, 
albumin, total protein.  At a minimum, for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) monitoring purposes, subjects will have chemistry assessments weekly during at least the first 2 cycles of lenalidomide-containing treatment as well as on Day 3 or 4 of Cycle -1.  In addition, because the risk for TLS may be elevated when lenalidomide is re-started after treatment 
interruptions or when the lenalidomide dose is escalated, in  any cycle in which the lenalidomide dose is escalated, re-
escalated, or treatment is interrupted for more than 1 week , subjects will have weekly chemistry assessments performed 
for at least 4 consecutive weeks, as well as an additional ch emistry assessment on day 3 or 4 during the first week.  For 
subjects who do not experience any abnormalities in serum ch emistry assessments for 2 consecutive cycles while on a 
stable lenalidomide dose (without escalation or interruption) throughout these 2 cycles, the timing of chemistry assessments may be reduced to Day 1 and Day 15 in subsequent cycles. 
9 Pregnancy tests required for females of childbearing poten tial.  A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a  sexually 
mature female who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally 
postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months). 
10 Pregnancy tests must occur within 10 – 14 days and ag ain within 24 hours prior to initiation of lenalidomide and 
thalidomide.  FCBP with regular or no menstruation must ha ve a pregnancy test weekly for the first 28 days and then 
every 28 days while on therapy (including breaks in therapy); at discontinuation of lenalidomide/thalidomide and at day 28 post the last dose of lenalidomide/thalidomide.  Females with irregular menstruation must have a pregnancy test weekly for the first 28 days and then every 14 days while on therapy (including breaks in therapy), at discontinuation of lenalidomide/thalidomide and at day 14 and day 28 post the last dose of lenalidomide/thalidomide (see Appendix A: Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guid elines and Acceptable Birth Control Methods). 
11 After cycle 24, clinic visits (and the corre sponding assessments) are only required every 3rd cycle (e.g. Cycle 24, 27, 30, 
etc.). For any non-clinic visit treatment cycles (e.g. Cycle 25,  26, 28, 29, etc.), subjects must still meet all requirements 
for the initiation of a new treatment cycle, including complia nce with the RevAssist® and S.T.E.P.S.® programs, and all 
pregnancy testing and pregnancy risk counseling requirements. Hematology assessment (see number 7) will be done 
locally as required for the initiation of a new treatment cycle. 
12 CT scans should be done every six months for three years, and every twelve months thereafter. Response assessment and 
MRD assessment should be performed every six months s ubsequent to Cycle 24. Patients whose blood counts meet 
criteria of a CR should undergo a CT scan within 4 weeks.  If CT scan supports a response of CR, then bone marrow examination and peripheral blood MRD assessment should be performed within 4 weeks. 
13 An additional safety assessment will be done 28 days  (+/- 2 days) following the last dose of study drug. 
14 Only enough thalidomide and lenalidomide for 1 cycle of therapy may be provided to the patient each cycle. For non-clinic visit treatment cycles subsequent to Cycle 24 (e.g. Cycle 25, 26, 28, 29, etc.), study drug will be shipped to the subject at the start of each cycle. 
15 Physical examination of lymphadenopathy, spleen and liver w ill be performed on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycles -1, 1, 
2, 3,4 and 5 to access for tumor flare reaction, and on Day 1 of subsequent cycles starting with cycle 5 to assess 
response.   
16 CLL Flow Cytometry should include markers for diagnos is and prognosis: CD5, CD19/CD20, CD23, CD38, sIg, and 
zap-70, by immunohistochemistry. Also IgVH Mutation Anal aysis, Purified CLL cell interphase FISH, beta 2 
microglobulin   
17 Rituximab administration starting with Cycle 1 and then every 6th cycle through Cycle 19 (i.e. 7, 13, and 19)  on Days 1, 
8, 15 and  22.  
18 Metabolimics on Days 1 and 15 prior to study drug administration for Cycles -1 and 1.   
19 T-cell Repertoire Studies: samples will be collected prior to treat ment on cycle -1 and prior to cycles 6, 12, and 24 and evaluated for 
T-cell Repertoire 
20 PI 3-Kinase Assessment:  samples will be a ssessed for PI 3-Kinase activity levels prior to cycle -1, day 15 of cycle -1, and da y 15 of 
cycle #1. 
21 After Cycle 19, IFE, beta-2-microglobulin, DAT assessment will be  done every 6 cycles starting with Cycle 24. 
 
 
45  **** Rituximab can be given +/- 2days.   
****All correlative work must be drawn prior to Rituximab administration regardless of the day 
Rituximab is given. 
 
46  11. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
Baseline lesion assessments must occur within  28 days of study drug admini stration or as indicated 
in Section 10, Schedule of Study Assessments. 
Efficacy assessments are scheduled to occur every f our weeks.  It should be  noted that signs and 
symptoms of a tumor flare may appear similar to  disease progression.  Investigators should decide 
whether apparent increases in disease are indicativ e of a tumor flare or disease progression.  If the 
increases in lymphadenopathy, tenderness, leukocytosis , or cytopenias occur w ithin four weeks of a 
dose escalation, then it is possible th e changes are indicative of a disease flare.  If these changes begin 
more than four weeks after a dose increase, then the changes are likely disease progression.  These are 
guidelines to help investigator in making their d ecision, but the decision regarding classifying their 
disease as progression or flare remains ultimately with the investigator. Response and progression will be evaluated in th is study using the International Workshop on CLL 
(IWCLL) update of the 1996 NCI-Working Group criteria for CLL [15]. 
11.1 Complete response:  requires all of the following conditions to be met: 
1. Absence of clonal lymphocytes in the peripheral blood by flow cytometry. 
2. Blood counts above the following values: 
a) neutrophil count > 1500/ mm
3, without the use of growth factors 
b) hemoglobin > 11 gm/dL, untransfused (men and women) 
c) platelet count > 100,000/ mm3, untransfused 
3. Absence of lymphadenopathy on CT examination of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
(lymph nodes < 1.5 cm in diameter). 
4. Absence of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly by CT examination 
5. Absence of constitutional symptoms. 
6. Bone marrow biopsy and aspirate demonstra ting normal cellularity for the age of the 
patient and free of clonal CLL cells by conventi onal (not 4-color) flow cytometry and / or 
immunohistochemistry.  If lymphoid nodules are present (formerly nPR), they should be 
assessed by immunohistochemistry to determine whether they are composed of CLL cells. 
 If the lymphoid nodules are not CLL cells, then the patient will be cons idered a CR.  If the 
lymphoid nodules are composed of CLL cells, then  the patient will be categorized as a PR. 
 If the bone marrow is found to be hypocellular, a repeat marrow biopsy should be performed after 4-6 weeks. 
7. Patients who fulfill all of the criteria for CR,  including marrow examination, but who have 
persistent anemia or thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia unrelated to CLL but related to drug toxicity will be characterized as CR with  incomplete marrow recovery (CRi).  These 
patients will be followed in order to dete rmine whether their prognosis differs from 
 
47  patients in CRs or PRs. 
11.2  Partial response:  any response less than a complete response but still meeting the following 
criteria: 
1. 50% decrease in peripheral blood lymphocytes from the pre-treatment value. 
2. 50% reduction in lymph node size by CT ex amination as measured by the sum of the 
products of up to 6 lymph nodes, or in one lymph node diameter if only a single lymph 
node is present. 
3. No increase in the size of any lymph node , and no new enlarged lymph nodes, by CT 
examination. 
4. 50% reduction in the size of the liver and / or spleen by CT examination 
5. Blood counts must show one of the following: 
a) neutrophil count > 1500/mm3 or 50% improvement over baseline without the use 
of growth factors. 
b) hemoglobin > 11.0 gm/dL or 50% improvement  over baseline without transfusions 
or erythropoietin support. 
c) platelet count > 100,000/mm3 or 50% improvement over baseline without 
transfusions. 
11.3 Progressive disease:  any of the following characteristics: 
1. Progressive lymphadenopathy, as defined by: 
a) Appearance of any newly enlarged lymph nodes to > 1.5 cm. 
b) An increase by 50% or more in greatest diamet er of any previous site of disease.  
For a lymph node of 1 to 1.5 cm must incr ease by at least 50% to a size greater 
than 1.5 cm.  A lymph node greater than 1.5 cm in diameter must increase to more 
than 2.0 cm in diameter. 
c) An increase of 50% or more in the sum of the products of diameters of multiple 
lymph nodes. 
2. An increase in liver or spleen size by 50% or  more or the appearance of new hepatomegaly 
or splenomegaly. 
3. An increase in the number of blood lymphoc ytes by 50% or more with at least 5000 B 
lymphocytes /mm3. 
4. Transformation to a more aggressive histology. 5. Occurrence of cytopenias attributable to CLL, excluding those related to therapy or 
autoimmune phenomenon.  The progression of any cytopenia is defined by: 
 
48  a) decrease in Hb by more than 2 g/dL or to less than 10 g/dL. 
b) decrease in platelet counts by more than 50% or to less than 100,000/ mm3. 
11.4 Stable disease: patients who have not achieved a CR or  a PR, and who have not exhibited 
progressive disease, will be considered to have stable disease. 
11.5 Relapse:  patients who has previously ach ieved a CR or PR, but after a period of 6 or more months, 
demonstrate evidence of disease progression. 
11.6 Refractory disease: disease progression within 6 months of the last treatment. 
11.7 Duration of response definitions: 
1. Duration of response:  from the end of the last treat ment until evidence of progressive 
disease. 
2. Time to response:  interval from the first treatment day to the date response first identified. 
2. Progression-free survival:  interval between the first treatment day and the first sign of 
disease progression. 
3. Event-free survival:  interval between the first treatment  day to the first sign of disease 
progression, treatment for relapse, or death, whichever occurs first. 
4. Survival duration:  interval between the first day of treatment and death 
 
 
12. DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
 
12.1  Protocol amendments 
Any amendment to this protocol must be agreed to by the Principal Investigator and reviewed by 
Celgene.  Amendments should only be submitted to IRB/EC after consideration of Celgene review.  
Written verification of IRB/EC approval will be obtained before any amendment is implemented.   
 
12.2  Protocol deviations 
When an emergency occurs that requires a deviati on from the protocol for a subject, a deviation will 
be made only for that subject.  A decision will be made as soon as possible to determine whether or 
not the subject (for whom the deviation from protoc ol was effected) is to continue in the study.  The 
subject’s medical records will completely describe  the deviation from the protocol and state the 
reasons for such deviation.  In addition, the Inves tigator will notify the IRB/EC in writing of such 
deviation from protocol. 
Non-emergency minor deviations from the protocol  will be permitted with approval of the Principal 
Investigator.  
 
49   
 12.3 Data Safety Monitoring Board  
The role of the Data Safety Monitoring Board (D SMB) will be fulfilled by the Weill Cornell Medical 
College DSMB. The purpose of the Data Safety M onitoring Board (DSMB) is to advise on serious 
safety considerations, lack of efficacy and any other considerations within the charge to the 
Committee. Data will be analyzed and submitted to the DSMB annually in order to allow for 
assessments of response and toxicities. 
 The DSMB may request additional meetings or sa fety reports as deemed necessary upon discussion 
with Celgene and its representatives.  The DSMB may stop the study following review of results from 
each interim analysis.  Appropriate efficacy and sa fety data summaries will be provided to the DMC 
after each interim analysis. 
 
12.4 Data Collection  
 
The data collection plan for this study is to utili ze the HemOnc database to capture all treatment, 
toxicity, and efficacy data for all enrolled patients.  
12.5   Regulatory Considerations  
All protocol amendments and consent form modifications will be made by the Principal 
Investigator. Celgene Corporation  will have the opportunity to review and approve the changes 
prior to submission of these changes to the local IRB and distribution to participating sites.  
 
12.6   Investigator responsibilities 
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and in 
the US Code of Federal Regulations. 
Investigators must enter study data onto CRFs or othe r data collection system.  The Investigator will 
permit study-related audits by Celgene or its representatives, IRB/EC review, and regulatory inspec-
tion(s) (e.g., FDA, EMEA, TPP), providing direct access to the facilities where the study took place, to source documents, to CRFs, and to all other study documents. 
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Inve stigator’s staff, must be available at some time 
during audits to review data and resolve any queries and to allow direct access to the subject’s records 
(e.g., medical records, office charts, hospital charts, and study related charts) for source data 
verification.  The data collection must be completed prior to each visit and be made available to the 
Celgene representative so that the accuracy and completeness may be checked.  
12.7  Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee approval 
The protocol for this study has been designed in  accordance with the general ethical principles 
outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.  The re view of this protocol by the IRB/EC and the 
 
50  performance of all aspects of th e study, including the methods used for obtaining informed consent, 
must also be in accordance with principles enunciated in the declaration, as well as ICH Guidelines, 
Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR),  Part 50 Protection of Human Subjects and Part 56 
Institutional Review Boards. 
The Investigator will be responsible for preparing documents for submission to the relevant IRB/EC 
and obtaining written approval for this study.  The a pproval will be obtained pr ior to the initiation of 
the study. The approval for both the protocol and informed cons ent must specify the date of approval, protocol 
number and version, or amendment number. Any amendments to the protocol after receipt  of IRB/EC approval must be submitted by the 
Investigator to the IRB/EC for approval.  The I nvestigator is also responsible for notifying the 
IRB/EC of any serious deviations from the protocol , or anything else that may involve added risk to 
subjects. Any advertisements used to recruit subjects for the study must be reviewed and approved by the 
IRB/EC prior to use. 
 
12.8  Informed consent 
The Investigator must obtain informed consent of  a subject or his/her designee prior to any study 
related procedures as per GCPs as set forth in the CFR and ICH guidelines. 
Documentation that informed consent occurred prio r to the subject’s entry into the study and the 
informed consent process should be recorded in the subject’s source documents.  The original consent 
form signed and dated by the subject and by the pers on consenting the subject prior to the subject’s 
entry into the study, must be maintained in the Investigator’s study files. 
 
12.9  Subject confidentiality 
Celgene affirms the subject’s right to protection against invasion of privacy.  In compliance with 
United States federal regulations, Celgene re quires the Investigator to permit Celgene’s 
representatives and, when necessary, representatives  of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to 
review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in accordance with local laws. 
Should direct access to medical records require a waiv er or authorization separate from the subject’s 
statement of informed consent, it is the responsibility  of the Investigator to obtain such permission in 
writing from the appropriate individual. 
 
51   
12.10   Study records requirements 
The Investigator must ensure that the records and documents pertaining to the conduct of the study 
and the distribution of the study drug, that is c opies of CRFs and source documents (original 
documents, data, and records [e.g., hospital records;  clinical and office charts; laboratory notes; 
memoranda; subject’s diaries or evaluation checklists; SAE reports, pharmacy dispensing records; 
recorded data from automated instruments; copies or  transcriptions certified after verification as being 
accurate copies; microfiches; photographic negatives , microfilm, or magnetic media; x-rays; subject 
files; and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico-technical departments 
involved in the clinical study; documents regarding subject treatment and study drug accountability; original signed informed consents, etc.]) be retain ed by the Investigator for as long as needed to 
comply with national and international regulations  (generally 2 years after discontinuing clinical 
development or after the last marketing approval) .  The Investigator agrees to adhere to the 
document/records retention procedures by signing the protocol. 
 
12.11  Premature discontinuation of study 
  
 12.11.1 Single center 
The responsible local clinical Investigator, as well as Celgene, have the right to 
discontinue this study at any time for reas onable medical or administrative reasons 
in any single center.  Possible reasons for termination of the study could be but are 
not limited to: 
 Unsatisfactory enrollment with respect to quantity or quality. 
 Inaccurate or incomplete data collection. 
 Falsification of records. 
 Failure to adhere to the study protocol. 
 12.11.2 Study as a whole 
Celgene reserves the right to terminate this clinical study at any time for reasonable medical or administrative reasons. 
Any possible premature discontinuation w ould be documented adequately with 
reasons being stated, and information would have to be issued according to local 
requirements (e.g., IRB/EC, regulatory authorities, etc.). 
 
 
13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
 
52  13.1  Overview 
Sample size reco mmendations for the phase II design are determined according to Simon’s two-stage 
Minimax design [91].  We project an overall res ponse proportion (CR + PR) of 60%, below which the 
response will be unacceptable, and an overall res ponse proportion of 80% above which the regimen 
will be considered worthy of further exploration.  The null hypothesis that the overall response 
proportion is less than or equal to 60% will be tested against the alternative hypothesis that the overall 
response proportion is greater than or equal to 80%.  For the purpose of these statistical analyses, responses will be assessed starting after cycle #6 of treatment and then every cycle thereafter. 
The sample size computations were performed a ssuming a 10% level of significance and 80% power. 
 In the first stage, 11 patients will enter the study.  If 6 or fewer patients respond, the study will be 
terminated early and declared to have a negative re sult.  If 7 or more patients respond, enrollment will 
be extended to 24 patients.  At Stage 2, the treatment will be declared effective and worthy of further 
testing if 18 or more patients re spond among the 24 patients entered.  This two-stage design yields a ≥ 
0.80 probability of a positive result if the tr ue percentage of overall responders is ≥ 80%.  It yields a ≥  
0.90 probability of a negative result if the true percentage of overall responders is ≤ 60%. 
 
Table A. Numbers of observed overall responders required to accept or reject H

Under this design, H 0 will not be rejected at Stage 1 
 
 N Accept H0 Reject H 0 
Stage 1 11 ≤ 6 --- 
Stage 2 24  17  18 
 
13.2  Datasets to be analyzed   
Primary Endpoint: 
 Overall response rate (CR + PR) 
Secondary Clinical Endpoints: 
 Progression Free Survival 
 Duration of response 
 Time to response 
 Overall survival 
 Toxicity profile 
 
 
13.3  Statistical Methodology 
Primary Endpoint: 
 
53   The primary endpoint of response rate (overall, CR, PR) will be estimated and a 95% 
confidence interval will be estimated via binomial proportions 
 
Secondary Endpoints: 
 With adequate follow-up time, progression-free survival (PFS) will be assessed by 
Kaplan-Meier survival  analysis and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated using 
Greenwood’s formulae.  PFS will be defined as  the time from the first treatment day 
until objective or symptomatic progression (or until date of last follow-up if no progression).  
 Duration of Response: from the end of the last treatment until evidence of progressive disease. 
 Time to Response 
 Overall Survival 
 The frequency of subjects experiencing toxic ities will be tabulated.  Toxicities will be 
assessed and graded according to CTCA E v4.0 terminology.  Exact 95% confidence 
intervals around the toxicity proportions will be calculated to assess the precision of the obtained estimates. 
13.4  Safety evaluation 
Data from all subjects who receive any drug while on study will be included in the safety 
analyses. Subjects enrolled on to the study but who did not take any study drugs, will not be 
evaluated for safety. 
The severity of the toxicities will be grad ed according to the NCI CTCAE v4.0 whenever 
possible (Appendix C).  
13.5  Interim analyses 
 
 13.5.1  Interim analysis strategy  
Accrual will not be put on hold during the study in order to perform an interim 
analysis given the preliminary clinical data already generated demonstrating activity 
for lenalidomide in CLL.  Efficacy and safety data will be analyzed after the first eleven patients reach cycle four.  Data w ill be analyzed subsequently every four 
months in order to allow for assessments of response and toxicities.  For the purpose 
of performing the interim analysis, responses will be assessed starting after cycle #6 of treatment and then every cycle thereafter. In the first stage, 11 patients will enter th e study.  If 6 or fewer patients respond, the 
study will be terminated early and declared to  have a negative result.  If 7 or more 
patients respond, enrollment will be extended to 24 patients.

Appendix A: Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregna ncy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth 
Control Methods 
 
62   
Risks Associated with Pregnancy 
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic 
active substance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects.  An embryofetal development study in animals indicates that lenalidomide produced malformations in the offspring of female monkeys who received the drug during pregnancy.  The teratogenic effect of lenalidomide in 
humans cannot be ruled out.  Therefore, a risk minimization plan to prevent pregnancy must be observed. 
All study participants must be registered into th e mandatory RevAssist® and S.T.E.P.S programs, and 
be willing and able to comply with the requirements of RevAssist® and S.T.E.P.S. 
 
Criteria for females of childbearing potential (FCBP) 
This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a sexually mature woman who: 1) has 
not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months). 
Counseling 
For a female of childbearing potential, lenalidomide and thalidomide is contraindicated unless all 
of the following are met (i.e., all females of childbearing potential must be counseled concerning the following risks and requirements prior to the start of lenalidomide study therapy):  
 She understands the potential teratogenic risk to the unborn child 
 She understands the need for effective contraception, without interruption, 4 weeks before starting study treatment, throughout the entire duration of study treatment, dose interruption and 28 days after the end of study treatment 
 She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures 
 She is informed and understands the potential consequences of pregnancy and the need to notify her study doctor immediately if there is a risk of pregnancy 
 She understands the need to commence the study treatment as soon as study drug is dispensed following a negative pregnancy test 
 She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing based on the frequency outlined in this protocol  
 
63   She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions 
associated with the use of lenalidomide and thalidomide 
The investigator must ensure that for females of childbearing potential: 
 Complies with the conditions for pregnancy risk minimization, including confirmation that she has an adequate level of understanding 
 Acknowledge the aforementioned requirements 
For a female NOT of childbearing potential, lenalidomide and/or thalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the following are met (i.e., all females NOT of childbearing potential must be counseled concerning the following risks and requirements prior to the start of lenalidomide and/or thalidomide study therapy):  
 She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions associated with the use of lenalidomide and/or thalidomide 
Traces of lenalidomide have been found in semen.  Male patients taking lenalidomide must meet the following conditions (i.e., all males must be counseled concerning the following risks and requirements prior to the start of lenalidomide and/or thalidomide study therapy): 
 Understand the potential teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential 
 Understand the need for the use of a condom even if he has had a vasectomy, if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential.   
Contraception 
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) enrolled in this protocol must agree to use two reliable forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual contact during the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at least 28 days before starting study drug; 2) while participating in the study; 3) dose interruptions; and 4) for at least 28 days after study treatment discontinuation.  
The two methods of reliable contraception must include one highly effective method and one 
additional effective (barrier) method. FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods if needed. The following are examples of highly effective and additional effective methods of contraception:   
 Highly effective methods: 
 Intrauterine device (IUD) 
 Hormonal (birth control pills, injections, implants) 
 
64   Tubal ligation 
 Partner’s vasectomy 
 Additional effective methods: 
 Male condom 
 Diaphragm 
 Cervical Cap 
Implants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an increased risk of 
infection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered particularly in patients with neutropenia.  
Pregnancy testing 
Medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU/mL must be 
performed for females of childbearing potential, including females of childbearing potential who commit to complete abstinence, as outlined below. 
Before starting study drug 
Female Patients: FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests (sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) prior to starting 
study drug.  The first pregnancy test must be performed within 10 to 14 days prior to the start of study drug and the second pregnancy test must be performed within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug.  The patient may not receive study drug until the study doctor has verified that the results of these pregnancy tests are negative. 
Male Patients: Must practice complete abstinence or  agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a 
pregnant female or a female of childbearing pot ential while participating in the study, during dose 
interruptions and for at least 28 days follo wing study drug discontinuation, even if he has 
undergone a successful vasectomy.   
During study participation and for 28 days following study drug discontinuation  
Female Patients: 
 FCBP with regular or no menstrual cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests weekly 
for the first 28 days of study participation and then every 28 days while on study, at study discontinuation, and at day 28 followi ng study drug discontinuation. If menstrual 
cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing must occur weekly for the first 28 days and 
 
65  then every 14 days while on study, at study discontinuation, and at days 14 and 28 
following study drug discontinuation.   
 At each visit, the Investigator must confirm with the FCBP that she is continuing to use two reliable methods of birth control.   
 Counseling about pregnancy precautions and the potential risks of fetal exposure must be conducted at a minimum of every 28 days.  
 If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in a study patient, study drug must be immediately discontinued. 
 Pregnancy testing and counseling must be performed if a patient misses her period or if her pregnancy test or her menstrual bleeding is abnormal.  Study drug treatment must be discontinued during this evaluation. 
 Females must agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at least 28 days after study drug discontinuation. 
Male Patients: 
 Counseling about the requirement for complete abstinence or condom use during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential and the potential risks of fetal exposure to lenalidomide must be conducted at a minimum of every 28 days.   
 If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in the partner of a male study patient during study participation, the investigator must be notified immediately. 
Additional precautions 
 Patients should be instructed never to give this medicinal product to another person and to return any unused capsules to the study doctor at the end of treatment. 
 Female patients should not donate blood during therapy and for at least 28 days following discontinuation of study drug. 
 Male patients should not donate blood, semen or sperm during therapy or for at least 28 days following discontinuation of study drug. 
 Only enough study drug for one cycle of therapy may be dispensed with each cycle of therapy.

Table:  Cairo-Bishop Definition of Laboratory Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
Uric Acid ≥ 476 μmol/l (≥ 8.0 mg/dl) or 25% increase from baseline 
Potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/l ( ≥ 6.0 mEq/l) or 25% increase from baseline 
Phosphorous ≥1.45 mmol/l  ( ≥ 4.5 mg/dl) or 25 % increase from baseline 
Calcium ≤ 1.75 mmol/l ( ≤ 7.0 mg/dl) or 25% decrease from baseline 
Laboratory tumor lysis syndrome (LTLS) is defined as eith er a 25% change or level above or below normal, as 
defined above, for any two or more serum values of ur ic acid, potassium, phosphate, and calcium within 3 days 
before or 7 days after the initiation of chemotherapy.  Th is assessment assumes that a patient has or will receive 
adequate hydration (± alkaliniza tion) and a hypouricaemic agent(s).

76  Appendix H: Summary of Changes from Pr otocol Version 2 dated September 23, 2013 
The protocol has been amended to discontinue rituximab after Cycle 19 and reduce the frequency 
of subject visits to every three cycles subsequent to Cycle 24. 
List of substantive changes [relevant sections]: 
‐ Treatment with rituximab will be discontinued after Cycle 19.  
[Schema, Sections 5.1, Section 5.2, Section 5.4.1, Section 8.3.7, Section 10]  
‐ Subsequent to Cycle 24, clinic visits are required every three cycles. At the start of non-clinic 
visit treatment cycles, subjects must still meet all the requirements for the initiation of a new treatment cycle, including compliance with the RevAssist® and S.T.E.P.S.® programs, and all pregnancy testing and pregnancy risk counseling requirements. Hematology assessment will be done locally as required for the initiation of a new treatment cycle. Study drug will be shipped to subjects at the start of non-clinic visit cycles.  
[Section 5.4.1, Section 5.4.2, Section 6.3, Section 10]  
‐ The provision of Lenalidomide and Thalidomide has been corrected to state that both drugs are shipped on a per subject basis by the contract pharmacy to the clinic site, rather than direct-to-patient.  
[Section 8.1.6, Section 8.2.8]  
‐ BLyS/BAFF Analysis will be discontinued after the last cycle of Rituximab treatment.  
[Section 9, Section 10] 
‐ Peripheral Blood Cell Subset Analysis will now be done every six cycles subsequent to Cycle 
24. 
[Section 9, Section 10] 
‐ CT scans will be done every six months for three years, and every twelve months thereafter.  
Response assessment and MRD assessment should be performed every six months subsequent to Cycle 24. 
[Section 10] 
‐ IFE, beta-2-microglobulin, DAT assessment will be done every 6 cycles starting with Cycle 
24. 
[Section 10] 
‐ The DSMB concluded at the 8/11/2016 meeting that the data and safety review schedule be 
changed from quarterly to annual. 
[Section 12.3]

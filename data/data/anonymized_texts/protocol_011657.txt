AMENDMENT 3: RATIONALE FOR CHANGES  
 
This amendment updates and supersedes  Amendment 2 dated 14 -June-2021.  
 
Modifications made to the protocol as a part of Amendment 3 and a brief rationale for the 
changes are summarized below.   
 
Major Revisions include:   
• Eliminat ed C ohorts A and B  
• Study now consists of a single cohort with 60 patients with screening  (central 
laboratory)  BK viral load between 350 and 10,000,000 copies/mL . Increasing from the 
previous maximum of 50,000 copies/mL to a maximum of 10,000,000 copies/mL allows 
for inclusion of a greater number of patients, including t hose with higher viral loads, in 
order to include patients with an even greater unmet medical need.  
• Added stratification based on screening BK viral load  
• Stratum 1 will consist of patients with a BK viral load  at 
screening  
• Stratum 2 will consist of patients with a BK viral load  
at screening  
• Stratification will allow for equal randomization among  active and placebo  arms  for 
patient populations . 
• Changed local BK viral l oad (ie, pre -screening values) requirement from 1,000  to 
<10,000 copies/ mL for Cohort A and 10,000  to 50,000 copies/mL for Cohort B to any 
positive local BK viral load, and c larifi ed that whole blood or plasma results may be 
used for local BK viral load  
• Allowing results from local laboratories s implifies screening for sites, while making the 
final determination of eligibility reliant on the standardized VL testing at the central 
laboratory to ensure consistent screening data.   
• Allow ed local BK viral load (ie, pre -screening values) to be within 90 days prior to 
screening (instead of 21 days)  
• Increasing the window for pre -screening simplifies screening for sites, while retaining the 
rigor and consistency of central laboratory testing for final determination of eligibility.  

AlloVir  
Clinical Study Protocol P -105-201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 3 • For patients in Period 1 who have undetectable BK plasma viral load s at 2 or more 
consecutive assessments at least 2 weeks apart  and who no longer require dosing visits , 
allowed subsequent study visits  (excluding Weeks 8 and 12)  to be conducted by a 
Sponsor -approved home health vendor in conjunction with a Sponsor -approved 
telehealth  provider  
• Allowing more home -health visits reduces patient burden.  
• For all patients, a llowed study visits after Week 12 to be conducted by a Sponsor -
approved home health vendor in conjunction with a Sponsor -approved telehealth 
provider  
• Allowing more home -health visits reduces patient burden.  
• Eliminated long -term follow -up period (ie, Weeks 48 to 96)  
• Study duration is now 26 weeks (2 -week screen ing period, 12 -week treatment period, 
12-week follow -up period) . 
• Patients will be eligible for enrollment in a long -term observation al study (ALVR105 -
401) and  will be encouraged to enroll in this study.  
• Eliminating the long -term follow -up reduces patient b urden in this study, while allowing 
more flexible visit timing in the observational study.  Also allows  twice as much  long-
term- follow up  in the observational study ( — up to 4 years — compared  to the original 
protocol) . 
• Eliminated  sirolimus and everolimus as prohibited medications  
• Removed from prior /concomitant therapy in exclusion criterion #10 ( Section 5.2). 
• Added  as medications  that cannot be started during  the first 12 weeks  of the study  to 
Excluded Medications and/or Procedures ( Section 6.8.1 ). 
• Allowing patients with persistent BK viremia whose immunosuppression thera py prior to 
enrollment included these medication s,  to allow them to participate in the study , while 
avoiding the confounding factor of initiating these medications during the treatment 
period.  
• Added interim administrative analyses  and removed interim ana lyses 1 to 3 from the 
original protocol  
• The first  administrative  interim analysis will be performed by the Sponsor when 12 
patients in Stratum 1  have 
completed 8 weeks in the study  
• The second  administrative  interim analysis will be performed when 30 patients have 
completed 8 weeks in the study  
• Administrative i nterim analyses may be omitted or added at the discretion of the 
Sponsor to allow for long term planning, and to assess ending the study  early . 
• Adde d United States Adopted Name  and International Nonproprietary Name,  
posoleucel , in lieu of  ALVR105

Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 4 This amendment updates and supersedes  Amendment 1 dated 24 -May-2021.  
 
Modifications made to the protocol as a part of Amendment 2 and a brief rationale for the 
changes are summarized below.   
 
Major Revisions include:   
 
• Update to Data Safety and Monitoring Board (Section 10.1.5.1)  
• Removed requirement of pause to enrollment wh ile the DSMB reviews safety data from 
the first 3 subjects enrolled in each respective cohort. The rationale for this change is that 
the recently published data demonstrates the well tolerated safety profile of virus -specific 
3rd party T cells (VSTs) when used to treat BK virus following kidney transplant. 
Moreover, the on -going ALVR105 studies of initial treated HCT patients show no 
reported cases of graft -versus -host disease (GVHD) and/or cytokine release syndrome  
(CRS), and the infusions were well tolera ted. 
 
AMENDMENT 1 : RATIONALE  FOR CHANGES   
  
This amendment updates and supersedes  P-105-201 Original Protocol, dated 06 July 202 0, as 
follows:   
  
Modifications made to the protocol as a part of Amendment 1 and a brief rationale for the 
change s are summarized below.   
  
Major Revisions include:   
 
• Updates to Schedule of Activities  (Section 1.3)  
• Shorten ed maximum screening period from 21 to 14 days . This was done  given the 
change to allow a single viral load  at the central lab to qualify a patient, assuming th e 
patient’s viral load  at the local lab (done as standard of care)  is  
copies /mL for Cohort A.  
• Delete d CMV viral load  from screening  as the CMV -based  exclusion criteria has been 
removed.  
• Amended  language to  allow for up to 3  home health  visits for  clinical and viral load 
assessments in the follow up period after the initial 12 week dosing  period . This is done 
to minimize visits to hospitals and clinics during the COVID -19 pandemic, except when 
necessary for dosing  in the initial 12 week period . 
• Deleted language around locally obtained donor specific antibodies as these are no 
longer required to qualify  since they  are obtained in the study . 
• Visit window days have been changed from 14 days to  7 days for weeks 14 to 24, as 
visits are every 2 weeks during this period of time.  
  
• Revisions to Inclusion and Exclusion criteria to broaden enrollment  (section 5.1 and 5.2  
and in Synopsis ) 

AlloVir  
Clinical Study Protocol P -105-201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 5 • Updated the inclusion criteria to remove the 2 -year eligibility window after kidney 
transplant to allow additional patients with BK viremia outside this 2 -year post -
transplant window to also be eligible.  
• Updated the inclusion criteria to eliminate the exc lusion for > 12 weeks of BK viremia 
to also allow participation of patients with stable persistent BK viremia of greater than 
12 weeks duration.  
• Eliminate d the exclusion for > 12 weeks of BK viremia  to allow participation of patients 
with stable persistent  BK viremia  of greater than 12 weeks duration.  
• Remove d the 2 -year eligibility window after transplant to allow additional patients with 
BK viremia outside this 2-year post-transp lant window t o be eligible.  
• Remove d exclu sion for  patients with donor specific  antibodies  at transplant  since the 
data on these antibodies can be accurately compared between central lab data obtained 
at randomization and subsequently.  
• Added belatacept to the list of prohibited medication s. 
 
• Study treatment  prepar ation (section 6.1.2) now refers to the Cell Therapy Manual  
• IP preparation and infusion procedure description has been removed from the protocol, 
and referral to the Cell Therapy Manual has been added, as the IP management is more 
extensively described in the Cell Therapy Man ual.  
 
• Study treatment withdrawal (section 7.1) versus patient  discontinuation (section 7.2) 
after receipt of a prohibited study treatment or after pregnancy . 
• Clarified by changes in section s 7.1 and 7.2 that patients who receive a prohibited 
medication or become pregnant may continue in the study for the purposes of observation 
but are ineligible to receive study treatment.  
 
• CHARMS study data in section 2.3.2.2 is now refer enced  to the IB . 
• As ALVR105 safety and efficacy data from the CHARMS study is more  extensively 
described in the investigational brochure (IB), the specific data have been removed from 
section 2.3.2.3 and refer ence to the IB has been added.  
 
• Miscellaneous revisions to reflect administrative changes , correct typographical errors , 
or refer  to current study documents such as the IB . 
• Changed references to the study treatment  from Viralym -M to ALVR105 to conform to 
other Allovir  protocols.   
• Removed transmission of infectious agent from the list of SAE examples to avoid 
confusion over whether such an event would always be an SAE.  
• Corrected typo graphical error that omitted a line  in CTCAE grading to  now include 
Grade 5 SAE.  
• Added names of certain the laboratory chemistry values obtained in the study to be 
consistent with the lab oratory  manual.

associated  infusions  are as follow:  
Administrative interim analyses  are planned for the study . The Sponsor’s study team and 
Investigators will remain blinded to individual patient data during and after the administrative 
interim analyses. The  first interim analysis will be performed by the Sponsor when 12 patients 
in Stratum 1 have completed 8 weeks in  the study. The second interim analysis will be 
performed when 30 patients  have completed 8 weeks in the study. Interim analyses may be 
omitted or added at the discretion of the Sponsor to allow for long term planning, and to assess 
ending the study  or eit her arm  early.  Stopping rules for the study are detailed in Section 9.5.1 . 
After the first 3 doses, patients who have undetectable BK plasma viral loa d at 2 or more 
consecutive assessments at least 2 weeks apart will discontinue PSL infusions.  If a patient’s 
viral load becomes undetectable , the patient may be followed every 14 days for study 
evaluations as per the Schedule of Activities  (SoA) (Section  1.3). No patients are permitted to 
receive a subsequent infusion of PSL/placebo  if they develop new onset graft versus host 
disease ( GVHD ) (≥Stage 1; see Appendix 5, Section 10.5) or cytokine release syndrome ( CRS  
>Grade  2; see Appendix 6, Section  10.6) at the proposed time for infusion of any subsequent

1. Unless noted otherwise, the Day 1 procedures must be performed within 96 hours of randomization and prior to study treatment administration.  
2. Prior to conducting any study -related activities, written informed consent to participate in the study must be provided by the patient.  
3. Adverse events  will be monitored and documented from randomization through Week 24  in all patients.  
4. Complete physical examinations  require the patient to be at the site, and  will include, at a minimum, assessments of the C ardiovascular, Respiratory, Gastrointestinal and 
Neurological systems. Targeted physical examinations or assessments will include careful skin examination for GVHD, and other aspects as clinically indicated . 
5. Height and weight will be measured at screening;  only weight will be measured at other specified later visits.  For home visits, stated weight may be used.  
6. Includes body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration rate and will be measured after resting for 5 minutes.  For visits with infusio ns, vital  signs will be 
measured  within 30 minutes prior to infusion , at the end of the infusion, and at 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after the end of the infusion . A ±5 minute window will be permitted 
for all vital sign assessments.  
7. Performed within 1 hour after study treatment administration and at the end of study or early termination visit.  ECGs will be obtained with the patient in a semi -supine 
position after a 5-minute rest.  
8. The HLA type of the patient and their donor kidney will be obtained from the me dical record.  
9. CBC must include differential and LFTs must include alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, AST, and ALT. Urinalysis must be perform ed. 
10. Viral loads of BKV in plasma will be measured. The results of analys es from screening  must be available at the ti me of randomization. Results of central laboratory testing for 
viral load will be used for the purpose of determining eligibility/inclusion. Additional post -infusion samples may be collected, as clinically indicated. AdV, CMV, JCV, EBV, 
and HHV -6 viral  loads will also be assessed.  A whole blood or plasma BK viral load from the local lab oratory  may be used for the patient to qualify  for screening  if obtained 
≤90 days before the start of screening and  with any positive BK viral load  (may be reported as either copies/mL or IU/mL) . 
11. Viral DNA isolated from blood samples will be stored for potential future sequencing/genotyping from the samples collected at  baseline for viral load determination. Viral 
sequencing/genotyping will also potentially be performed in the event of viral recurrence and this sequencing result be compared with the baseline results.  
12. Urine samples will be obtained and will be stored for urinary polyomavirus haufen testing.  
13. A serum pregnancy test will be performed  at screening for all patients of childbearing potential.

mark the end of the screening per iod. Patients who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive sequential i nfusions of 
PSL cells or placebo.  
17. Patients will receive infusions of either PSL or placebo  after all blood drawing procedures listed for their visit in the SoA. Patients  in the active treatment arms  will receive the 
same  cells dose for all infusions. Placebo infusions will be administered as appropriate  to maintain the blind. As GVHD and CRS are  a theoretical safety concern, the 
incidence and severity of GVHD and CRS will be monitored during the study. No patients are permitted to receive an infusion o f PSL or placebo if they develop GVHD  
(≥Stage 1; see Appendix 5, Section 10.5) or CRS  >Grade  2. If any patient develops GVHD or CRS  >Grade 2, study treatment infusions should be stopped immediately, and 
the patient treated per standard of care.  
18. Patients will be monitored closely and must remain in the clinic for 1 hour after the end of each infusion. Vital signs, including body temperature, heart rate, respiration rate, 
and blood pressure, will be measured within 30 minutes prior to infusion, at the end of the infusion,  and at 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after the end of the infusion.  A ± 5 
minute  window is permitted for all vital sign measurements. Patients must also remain on continuous pulse oximetry for 30 minutes after the end of the infusio n. Post -
infusion monitoring should be completed for all infusions of study treatment.  
19. Blood will be collected into a cell separation tube and processed to generate a PBMC fraction and a plasma fraction. These fra ctions will be cryopreserved for potential f uture 
evaluation of virus -specific T cell  immune function/ virus -specific T cell  persistence and for potential future evaluation of cytokines and/or other humoral markers of 
inflammation and/or immune function. In addition, a tube of whole blood will be col lected for exploratory determination of virus -specific - T cell immune function in whole 
blood.

Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 25 2 INTRODUCTION  
AlloVir is developing  posoleucel ( PSL, ALVR105 , formerly  Viralym -M), a novel multivirus -
specific cellular therapy, to treat a number of serious, virus -associated causes of morbidity and 
mortality after transplant, including those caused by infection or reactivation with BK viremia 
([BKV ] and the related polyomavirus JC vi rus [JCV]), cytomegalovirus ( CMV ), human 
herpesvirus 6 (HHV -6), Epstein -Barr virus (EBV ), and adenovirus (AdV ). 
PSL (ALVR105)  is a biological product consisting of PSL cells (third -party, multivirus -specific 
T cells with specificity for BKV, JCV, AdV, HHV -6, EBV, and CMV) in cryopreservation  
medi a.  
2.1 Study Rationale  
This is a proof -of-concept study of PSL, and the principal objective is to assess the safety and 
tolerability of PSL in kidney  transplant recipients  with BK virus -associated nephropathy . The 
key secondary objective  is to test the hypothesis that the administration of PSL to kidney  
transplant recipients  will demonstrate superiority in suppressing BK viral load compared with 
placebo . 
2.2 Background  
In healthy, immunocompetent individuals, T ce ll immunity defends against viral infections . In 
transplant  recipients, the use of potent immunosuppressive regimens (and subsequent associated 
immune compromise) leaves patients susceptible to severe viral infections  and diseases . Viral 
infections are maj or causes of mortality and morbidity , and they have become  leading  etiolog ies 
for -transplant -related  mortality.  
BKV  is a polyomavirus that causes disease primarily in immunocompromised individuals. After 
primary infection, the virus remains latent in geni tourinary cells. In immunosuppressed kidney 
transplant recipients, the virus can reactivate and cause tubulointerstitial nephritis, and in some  
cases, ureteral stenosis ( Goldberg 2016 ). Nephropathy  secondary to BKV infec tion occurs in up 
to 10% of transplant recipients ( Jawdeh 2017 ) and is usually seen within the first year  following 
transplantation . There are no US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )-approved therapies for 
BKV infection  in kidney transplant recipients. The current t reatment consists of reduction in 
immunosuppression with close monitoring of allograft func tion; however, immunosuppression 
reduction may expose kidney transplant recipients to the risk of graft rejection .  
The cellular immune response to BK V plays a critical role in the control of BK virus replication. 
Several immune parameters predict an increased risk of high -level BK viremia; these include a 
low pre-transplant CD4+ T cell count (DeWolfe 2017 ), indicators of T cell exhaustion such as T 
cells with lower production of protective cytokines  and interferon  (IFN) -ɣ (Mueller 2011 ), and a 
lower number of  BKV-specific polyfunctional CD8+ T cells ( Schmidt 2014 ). 
Thus, development of a n adoptively -transferred T cell  treatment , such as  PSL, may meet an 
unmet medical need for BKV infection  in kidney transplant recipients .

Posoleucel ( PSL, ALVR105)  is a biologic al product consisting of PSL cells  
 
.  
For additional information on PSL, refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
2.3.1 Overview of  Nonclinical Studies with Posoleucel  
Consistent with guidance from the FDA, AlloVir proceeded to clinical studies following 
completion of in vitro studies. No nonclinical animal pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, or 
toxicology studies of PSL have been conducted or are planned. For additional information 
related to nonclinical studies with PSL, see the Investigator’s Brochure.  
2.3.2 Overview of Clinical Studies with Virus -Specific T Cells  
2.3.2.1  Results of an Initial Phase 1 Study with Viralym -C 
Initially,  AlloVir completed a Phase 1 study to assess the safety and efficacy of Viralym -C, a 
third -party, CMV -specific T cell product, in pediatric and adult allogeneic hematopoietic cell 
transplant (HCT ) recipients with refractory CMV infections  (Tzannou 2019 ). Similar to PSL, 
Viralym -C is generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cell s (PBMCs ) after expansion in the 
presence of overlapping viral peptides and cytokines. Unlike PSL, Viralym -C is only directed 
against a single virus , CMV. Although Viralym -C is a single  virus -specific  T cell product, the 
results of this study support the safety and efficacy of AlloVir’s  allogeneic,  virus -specific  T cell 
products when used in a clinical setting. Briefly, a bank of 8 Viralym -C lines w as generated from 
8 carefully selected, healthy, CMV -seropositive, transplant donor -eligible volunteers and was 
predicted to provide a suitably matched cell line for at least 95% of potential patients. Ten 
patients were treated with Viralym -C: each patient r eceived a single intravenous ( IV) infusion of 
2×107 partially human leukocyte antigen (HLA )-matched virus -specific  T cells/m2 with the 
option to receive a second infusion after 4  weeks and additional infusions at biweekly intervals 
thereafter. Of the 10 treated patients, 8  patients received a single infusion and 2 patients required 
2 infusions for sustained benefit. There were no immediate infusion -related toxicities , and there 
were no cases of de novo or recurrent graft versus host disease (GVHD ). Based on viral load 
(measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction  [qPCR] ) and/or resolution of signs and/or 
symptoms, Viralym -C appeared to control CMV infections in all patients with 8  complete 
responses (CRs) and 2 partial responses (PRs) achieved within  4 weeks of infusion. One patient 
with CMV retinitis had complete resolution of disease following Viralym -C infusion.  
2.3.2.2  Results of the ARMS Study with Donor -Derived Multivirus -Specific T Cells  
(Administration Of Rapidly Generated Multivirus -Specific Cytotoxi c T-
Lymphocytes For The Prophylaxis And Treatment Of EBV, CMV, Adenovirus, 
HHV6, And BK Virus Infections Post Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplan t) 
In order to broaden the range of viral infections targeted by virus -specific  T cells, AlloVir 
developed donor -derived multivirus -specific T cells with specificity for BKV, AdV, HHV -6, 
EBV, and CMV. This initial open -label Phase 1/2 study was conducted to assess the safety and 
toxicity of the multivirus -specific T cells in patients at risk of developing AdV, BKV, CMV, 
EBV, and/or HHV -6 infections after allogeneic HCT. The first stage of the study was a Phase 1

Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 27 dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety of 3  dose levels and to determine the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) level. Upon the completion of Phase 1, additional patients were accrued at 
the MTD level to evaluate a clinically relevant endpoint for antiviral activity in Phase 2.  
Patients received   donor -derived multivirus -specif ic cytotoxic T 
lymphocytes (CTLs)/m2 in a single infusion in the dose -escalation phase of the study, and  
multivirus -specific  CTLs/m2 for the fixed -dose Phase 2 efficacy component (actual number of 
cells infused ranged between    cells per patient). Patients were followed for 
toxicity for 30 days, GVHD for 6  weeks, and antiviral responses for 3 months; long -term follow -
up continued for 12  months following the final CTL infusion.  
A total of 21 patients were enrolled, and all 21 patients  completed the study. All doses were well 
tolerated. There were no adverse events (AEs) experienced by patients enrolled in the study that

2.3.2.3  Results of the CHARMS Study with Third Party -Derived Multivirus -Specific 
T Cells, Posoleucel (Multivirus -specific T Cells for the Tre atment of Virus 
Infections After Stem Cell Transplant ) 
To investigate the safety and clinical efficacy of PSL, a multivirus -specific T cell product 
reactive for BKV, AdV, HHV -6, EBV, and CMV generated from third -party, healthy donors, a 
Phase 1/2a clinical  study was conducted in recipients of allogeneic HCT with drug  refractory 
infections with ≥1 of the 5 viruses targeted by PSL. In this study, patients received a single IV 
infusion of 2 107 partially HLA -matched PSL cells/m2, with the option to receive a second 
infusion after 4  weeks (actual range 14 days to >6 weeks) and additional infusions at biweekly 
intervals thereafter. Therapy with standard antiviral medications could be continued at the 
discretion of the treating physician.  
A total of 58 patients with drug -refractory infections following allogeneic HCT were infused 
with PSL cell lines matched at 1 to 6 HLA antigens; 54 of these patients completed study 
treatment and the initial 28 -day safety follow -up (the first 38 patients to complete the study ar e 
reported in  Tzannou 2017 ). For additional information on PSL, refer to the current Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB).  
In addition to patients with post -HCT CMV, EBV, AdV, BKV, and HHV -6-associated 
infections, patients with J CV infections were also enrolled in this Phase 1/2 study. This decision 
was based on the homologous nature of BKV and JCV and on results of previous studies . 
Recently , it was demonstrated that partially HLA -matched third -party BKV -specific T cells 
could pr oduce similar results in 3 immunosuppressed patients with progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML ). Post -infusion, 2 patients experienced an alleviation of the clinical 
signs and imaging features of PML while the third patient had a reduction in JCV load and 
stabilization of symptoms  (Muftuoglu 2018 ). Given these promising results in the context of a 
complete lack of proven antiviral medications effective against JCV and the potentially 
devastating natural history  associated with JCV, activity of PSL in patients with JCV viremia  
will be monitored in this study .

Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 28 2.4 Benefit /Risk Assessment  
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expected AEs of PSL may be found in the IB. 
2.4.1 Potential Benefits  
A serious unmet medical need exists for patients experiencing viral infections and diseases such 
as BKV -associated nephropathy. Up to 10% of kidney transplant recipients will have BK plasma 
viral load s ≥10,000 copies/mL, a level that is  predictive of an allograft biopsy indicating  BK 
virus -associated nephropathy ( Hirsch 2013 ; Bohl 2007 ; Schachtner 2015 ), which can progress to 
graft loss ( Gardner 1984 ). Even with the best current treatments (principally immunosuppression 
reduction), many centers report allograft nephropathy, rejection, and graft failure more 
commonly than in non -BK viremic patients ( Favi 2019 ; El-Husseini 2019 ; Sawinski 2015 ). 
There are no FDA - or European Medicines Agency -approved antiviral therapies for BK viremia 
or BK virus nephropathy  in kidney transplant recipients . The CHARMS study and other related 
clinical studies strongly suggest that PSL is a safe and effective broad -spectrum therapy to treat 
commonly  observed, severe virus -associated disease in immunocompromised patients . The 
results of these studies provide preliminary evidence of PSL’s  efficacy in multiple opportunistic 
viral infections , including BKV,  in immunocompromised patients . Since standard of care 
immunosuppression reduction in response to persistent high -level BK virem ia has been 
associated with the development of donor -specific antibodies and graft rejection  (Sawinski 
2015 ), a therapy such as PSL has the potential to be better than that of standard  of care 
immunosuppression reduction . 
2.4.2 Potential Risks  
PSL primarily targets cells infected with AdV, BKV (and/or JCV), CMV, EBV, and/or HHV -6. 
The main risks of administration are inflammation at sites of disease or GVHD due to cross 
reactivity with the recipient’s HLA antigens . Adverse events attributable to virus -specific  T cell 
administration may potentially occur in a small percentage of the treated population. These can 
include both hematologic and non -hematologic effects, as reported in the CHARMS study.  
Studies of donor -derived virus -specific T cells suggest that virus -specific  T cells do not persist in 
patients who receive methylprednisolone in doses 1 mg/kg/day. Therefore, if patients develop 
severe inflammatory reactions thought to be attributable to PSL, a therapeutic option is to 
administer methylprednisolone (1 to 2 mg/kg/day). In patients who develop skin rash or skin 
GVHD, excellent responses have been seen with administration of topical steroids.  
As with other biological therapies delivered by IV infusion, possible side effects  of PSL infusion 
include allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), decreased oxygenation, nausea/vomiting, arrhythmia, and 
hypotension . 
A detailed breakdown of the time  points for blood sample collection  during the course of this 
study is provided in in Section 1.3.  
In order to minimize the volume of blood collected during the study, the blood volume of 
individual samples has been reduced to the maximum extent feasible. This has been done in a 
manner that is expected to maintain the scientific integrity of the study while minimizing the 
risks to patients.

Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 32 4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Overall  Design  
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled , multiple dosing 
interval, 2-period  study of the safety, tolerability and efficacy of adoptively transferred PSL 
virus -specific T cells in kidney transplant recipients with BK viremia.  
This study is comprised of 2 periods. Period  1 includes a 2-week window for screening 
assessments followed by a 12 -week treatment period for eligible patients. Period 2 consists of a  
12-week follow -up. Overall, the total duratio n of patient participation in the study is 
approximately 26 weeks ( 2 weeks for screening, 12 weeks of treatment, and 12 weeks of follow -
up). The overall enrollment period is anticipated to be approximately 12  months.  
The protocol defines standardized conse nsus guidelines for the type of immunosuppression 
reduction in order to s ystemat ize the approach to immunosuppression reduction across sites 
(Appen dix 7, Section  10.7). Administration of PSL in the active arms of the study may result in 
fewer patients meeting the criteria for initiation or intensification of immunosuppression 
reduction according to the prot ocol at their institution than in the placebo arm of the study, and 
changes to each patient’s immunosuppression will be monitored.  
Patients who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be 
randomized to receive PSL or placebo infusions.  Patients will be stratified  
 
 
 Patients will be monitored following randomization for safety, BK viral load, renal 
function , and immune function, including modification  of immunosuppression reduction.  
Patients will receive infusions of either PSL or placebo for 12 weeks . The specific PSL cell line 
for infusion will be selected  
 
. Cryopreservat ion media (without cells) will serve as the placebo and will be 
identical in volume and appearance upon administration. All infusions will be administered 
intravenously ( IV) (via peripheral or central line) over approximately  as a slow push. 
Patients will receive the same dose for all infusions.  
The study  will consist of 3 treatment arms. To maintain the blind, all patients will receive an 
infusion (either PSL or placebo)  
 The treatment arms and associated infusions for 
Cohort A are as follow:

Administrative interim analyses are planned for the study . The Sponsor’s study team and 
Investigators will remain blinded to individual patient data during and after the administrative 
interim analyses.  The first interim analysis will be performed  by the Sponsor when  12 patients in 
Stratum 1  have completed 8 weeks in the study, and the second  interim analysis  will be 
performed when 30 patients  have completed 8 weeks in the study . Interim analyses may be 
omitted or added  at the discretion of the Sponsor to allow for long term planning, and to assess 
ending the study  or either arm  early , as described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) . See 
Figure  1 for a schematic representation of the study design.  
Stopping rules for each dosing interval arm and for the study are detailed in Section 9.5.1 . 
After the fi 3 doses,  patients who have undetectable BK plasma viral load  at 2 or more 
consecutive assessments at least 2 weeks apart will discontinue PSL infusion s. If a patient’s viral 
load becomes undetectable, such a  patient may be followed every 14 days for study evaluations 
as per the Schedule of Activities  (Section  1.3). No patients are permitte d to receive a subsequent 
infusion of PSL if they develop new onset GVHD  (≥Stage 1; see Appendix 5, Section 10.5) or 
cytokine release syndrome (CRS ) (>Grade  2; see Appendix 6, Section  10.6) at the proposed time 
for infusion of any subsequent dose.  
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB ) will be convened for this study to 
routinely monitor patient safety and evaluate prespecified interim analyses  to stop the study early 
(see Section  10.1.5 ). 
4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
Even with the best current treatments (principally immunosuppression reduction), many centers 
report a llograft nephropathy, rejection , and graft failure more commonly  in patients with BK  
viremia  than in those without  (Favi 2019 , El-Husse ini 2019 , Sawinski  2015 ). The unmet medical 
need in BK virus nephropathy is reflected in the continue d use of (ineffective) antiviral 
treatments such as leflunomide, cidofovir, intravenous immunoglobulin G,  and levofloxacin 
concurrently with immunosuppression  reduction ( Bruminhent 2019 ). 
PSL multivirus -specific T cells target BK virus infected cells, and thus offer a way to lower viral 
load in BK viremic kidney transplant recipient s at risk for BK nephropathy . To date,  
immunosuppression reduction  is the only therapy that  has succeeded in lowering BK viral load , 
and even it has had limited success  and can lead to increased risk of rejection and/or production 
of donor -specific antibodies . This proof -of-concept  study will also identify the dos ing interval 
for virus -specific T  cell infusions needed to lower viral load  in kidney transplant recipient s on 
continued immunosuppression  and potentially limit the damage caused by BK virus replication 
in the kidney allograft . 
The use of placebo in this clinical  study is justified for the following reasons:  
1) A placebo control group is required to provide an objective, contemporaneous assessment 
of the therapeutic effects and AE profile of PSL. 
2) The use of an active control group in the study is not feasible since there are no approved, 
efficacious antiviral therapies for the treatment of BKV infections .

Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 34 3) Investigators are permitted to administer standard of care immunosuppression reduction 
as per the algorithm included in  Appendix 7 ( Section 10.7). 
4.3 Justification for Dose  
PSL is to be administered at a fixed cell dose. The fixed dose was selected based on data from 
previous clinical studies in which PSL cells were well tolerated, safe, and effective.  
    
   
 
  
The use of PSL in a solid organ transplant population that may be receiving  several different 
chronic immunosuppressive agents justifies the need for dose interval ranging in this study.  
 
 
 
 
; to date, there are no data for the use 
of PSL in the setting of solid organ transplant . The use of other T cell regimens for the treatment 
of viral infections specific to the solid organ transplant setting has demonstrated preliminary 
efficacy and safety when cell are administered weekly for 3  weeks followed by a variable period 
of rest , depending on the presence or absence of disease progression ( Prockop 2019 ). Two-
week  -Virus -Specific  T cell dosing intervals have  been described in several studies in which  
suppression of BK viral load  was observed ; however, an incomplete and/or delayed virologic 
response was often observed  (Flower 2020 ).  
 
 
 
 
 During this time , clinical safety and viral load will be monitored very 
closely by the DSMB. T cell persistence data will also be collected.   
4.4 End of Study Definition  
The end of the study (“study completion”) is defined as the date of the last protocol -specified 
visit/assessment (including telephone contact) for the last patient in the study.  
A patient  is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of the 
study including the Week 24 visit.

6.1.2 Study Treatment  Administration  
Randomization of patients to PSL versus  placebo will occur only after cell line matching and 
selection has been confirmed (to satisfy inclusion criteria).  
Premedication is not required, except for patients  with a prior history of reaction to blood 
products . These patients may  receive  premedication with 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg (maximum dose of 
25 mg) diphenhydramine  (IV or oral)  and/or 5 to 10 mg/kg (maximum dose of 1000 mg) 
acetaminophen  (IV or oral)  prior to study treatment administration. Premedication with 
corticosteroids is prohibited . 
At or close to the time of administration, the product will be thawed.  For further details on 
product preparation prior to infusion, please see the  Cell Therapy Manual.  
Patients will be monitored according to institutional standards for the administration of blood 
products and, at a minimum, according to the following requirements:  
• Patients in an outpatient setting must remain in the clinic for 1 hour after the end of the 
infusion.  
• Patients must remain on continuous pulse oximetry for 30 minutes after the  end of the 
infusion.  
• Vital signs will be monitored within 30 minutes prior to the infusion, at the end of infusion, 
and at 15, 30, 45, and 60 (±5) minutes after the end of the infusion.  
All findings must be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF ). 
Patients will receive supportive care for acute or chronic toxicity, including blood components, 
antibiotics, or other interventions as appropriate per local treatment guidelines. See Section  6.8.2  
for additional information.  
If a patient experiences an  infusion reaction, 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg (maximum dose of 25 mg) 
diphenhydramine (IV or oral) and/or 5 to 10 mg/kg (maximum dose of 1000  mg) acetaminophen

Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 42 (IV or oral) may be administered as treatment . The maximum recommended single and daily 
doses of diphenhydramine and acetaminophen should not be exceeded.  In the case of sub optimal 
control of an infusion reaction or the need to use corticosteroids for treatment of an infusion 
reaction, doses of 0.5mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent should be considered first . 
6.2 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability  
1. The Investigator  or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study treatment received and any discrepancies are 
reported and resolved before use of the study treatment.  
2. Only patient s enrolled in the study may rec eive study treatment and only authorized site 
staff may supply or administer study treatment. All study treatments must be stored in a 
secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in 
accordance with the labeled storage condi tions with access limited to the Investigator  and 
authorized site staff.  
3. The Investigator , institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study treatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance ( ie, 
receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).  
4. Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study treatment are 
provided in the  Cell Therapy Manual .  
6.2.1 Study Treatment  Preparation and Dispensing  
PSL and placebo will be supp lied in cryovials, which are to be transported from vapor  phase 
liquid nitrogen storage at the clinical site to the cell -thawing and preparation location in a liquid 
nitrogen dewar or other suitable container. Details of the cell thawing, preparation for d osing, 
and administration to the patient will be provided to clinical sites in a separate Cell Therapy  
Manual.  
6.2.2 Storage and Accountability  
PSL or placebo is stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen in a continuously monitored 
storage freezer.  
All materi al containing PSL or placebo will be treated and disposed of as hazardous waste in 
accordance with governing regulations and clinical site procedures.  
PSL and placebo accountability are the responsibility of the Principal Investigator and Sponsor. 
However,  this responsibility may be delegated to a suitably qualified Investigator or designee 
who has had appropriate study -specific training that has been documented. The Sponsor will 
maintain records that will allow anonymous traceability of each PSL cell line to the third -party 
PBMC donor from whom it originated. These records will be maintained for 30 years after 
expiry for each cell line.  
Detailed records will be maintained to allow for accurate accountability of PSL and placebo as 
per applicable Sponsor and clinical site procedures. For further details and specifications, see the 
Cell Therapy  Manual.

Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 43 6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding  
This study is blinded to safeguard  the integrity of the AE determination process, and to ensure 
that decisions regarding discontinuation of infusions for apparent efficacy are made in an 
unbiased fashion.  
Study using 
IVRS/IWRS  All patient s will be centrally assigned to randomized study treatment  
using an Interactive Voice/Web Response System (IVRS/IWRS). Before 
the study is initiated, the telephone number and call -in directions for the 
IVRS and/or the log in information and directions for the IWRS will be 
provided to each site.  
Study treatment  will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in the 
Schedule of Activitie s (SOA, Section  1.3). 
The Sponsor designee ( eg, interactive response technology [IRT] vendor) will have a designated 
randomization administrator who will maintain the randomization codes in accordance with 
standard operating procedures to ensure the blind integrity is properly maintained. Care should 
be exercised to ensure that only Sponso r personnel who require knowledge of treatment 
assignments will be unblinded ( eg, staff involved in Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse 
Reaction [SUSAR] reporting).  
Blind Break 
(IVRS/IWRS)  The IVRS/IWRS will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions.  
In case of an emergency, the Investigator  has the sole responsibility for 
determining if unblinding of a patient s’ intervention assignment is 
warranted. Patient  safety must always be the first consideration in 
making such a determination. If the Investigator  decides that 
unblinding is warranted, the Investigator  should make every effort to 
contact the Sponsor  prior to unblinding a patient ’s intervention 
assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the patient . 
If a patient ’s intervent ion assignment is unblinded, the Sponsor  must 
be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind. The date and 
reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source 
documentation and case report form, as applicable.  
Unblinding should only occur in the event of an emergency or AE for which it is necessary to 
know the study treatment to determine an appropriate course of therapy. If the patient’s study 
treatment must be unblinded, the Investigator or qualified designee should contact IRT for the 
study treatment information. The IRT documentation indicating the blind break at the site must 
be retained with the patient’s source documentation in such a way as to avoid unblinding the 
treatment assignment to other site or Spo nsor blinded personnel.  
If possible, the Investigator should attempt to contact the Medical Monitor prior to unblinding. If 
not possible, the Investigator should notify the Medical Monitor as soon as possible of the 
unblinding without disclosing the treatm ent assignment of the unblinded patient. The 
Investigator must document the patient’s identification, the reason for breaking the blind, and the 
date and time for breaking the blind. Following unblinding, the Investigator must withdraw the 
patient from the  study.

Clinical Study Protocol P -105-201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 44 6.4 Study Treatment  Compliance  
When patient s are dosed at the site, they will receive study treatment  directly from the 
Investigator  or designee, under medical supervision. The date and time of each dose 
administered in the clinic will be recorded in t he source documents  and on the appropriate eCRF . 
The dose of study treatment  and study patient  identification will be confirmed at the time of 
dosing by a member of the study site staff other than the person administering the study 
treatment . 
6.5 Dose Modification  
This section is not applicable.  
6.5.1 Retreatment Criteria  
As GVHD is a theoretical safety concern, the incidence and severity of GVHD will be monitored 
during the study. No patients will be permitted to receive a subsequent  infusion of PSL if they 
develop new onset GVHD  (≥Stage 1; see Appendix 5, Section 10.5) or CRS  (>Grade 2; see 
Appendix 6, Section  10.6). 
After the first 3 doses, patients who have undetectable BK plasma viral load at 2 or more 
consecutive assessments at least 2 weeks apart will discontinue PSL infusions.  If a patient’s viral 
load becomes undetectable in this way  such patients may be followed every 14  days for study 
evaluations as per the SoA (Section  1.3). 
6.6 Continued Access to Study Treatment  after the End of the Study  
No further treatment will be provided after the last dose of PSL (or placebo) after Week  12. 
However, patients will continue in the study for evaluation of safety, efficacy, and other 
endpoints for an additional 12 week s. 
6.7 Treatment of Overdose  
For this study, any dose of PSL greater than cells within a 24-hour period (±1 hour) will 
be considered an overdose.  
As there is no antidote, the Sponsor  does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose . 
In the event of an overdose, the Investigator  should:  
• Contact the Medical Monitor immediately.  
• Evaluate the patient  to determine, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, whether 
study treatment  should be interrupted or whether the dose interval should be extended . 
• Closely monitor the patient  for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities until  the next 
dosing day . 
• Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose.  
6.8 Concomitant Therapy  
All medications, including transplant immunosuppression , used within 30 days before screening 
will be recorded. All concomitant medications and concurrent therapies will be documented as 

AlloVir  
Clinical Study Protocol P -105-201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 45 indicated in Section 1.3. Dose, route, unit frequency of administration, indication for 
administration, and dates of medication will also be captured in source documents and on the 
appropriate eCRF . 
Clinically available ( ie, not investigational) antiviral agents prescribed for other infections, such 
as foscarnet and ganciclovir to treat CMV, are allowed. Data on their use will be collected along 
with other concomitant medications.  
Standard of care immunosuppression reduction is permitted as per the g uidelines for the type of 
immunosuppression reduction that are provided in Appendix 7 (Section 10.7). The typical 
immunosuppression regimen for kidney transplant patients, which includes a calcineurin 
inhibitor, an anti -metabolite, commonly mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolic acid, with or 
without low dose prednisone, is included in Section 10.7, Figure 2. If a patient’s 
immunosuppression regimen  includes sirolimus or everolimus, a change in these agents based on 
BK viral load is not usually made; for this reason they are not included in Figure 2, and patients 
taking these medications who require changes in dose of their sirolimus or everolimus will 
require discussion with the Medical Monitor. These guidelines should be followed in order to 
standardize the approach to immunosuppression  across sites.  Administration of PSL in the active 
arms of the study may result in fewer patients meeting the cri teria for modification  of 
immunosuppression reduction according to the protocol at their institution than in the placebo 
arm of the study, and changes to each patient’s immunosuppression will be monitored and may 
be summarized as an exploratory endpoint.  
6.8.1 Excluded Medications and/or Procedures  
All patients may receive available supportive therapy with approved treatments, but initiation of 
therapy for the attempted treatment of BK virus  infection  with sirolimus, everolimus,  cidofovir, 
brincidofovir, fluoroqu inolones ( eg, ciprofloxacin), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or 
leflunomide during the first 12  weeks after randomization is prohibited.  
Receipt of other investigational antiviral treatments ( eg, anti-BK virus monoclonal antibodies) 
within 28 days or 5  half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to randomization and throughout the 
duration of the study is prohibited.  
T cell ablative therapies such as antithymocyte globulin, alemtuzumab (Campath -1H), or other 
immunosuppressive T cell -targeted monoclonal antibodies are prohibited during the study. Daily 
doses of corticosteroids exceeding 0.5 mg/kg prednisone (or equivalent) are also prohibited 
during the study.  
6.8.2 Supportive Care 
The following supportive care measures are permitted:  
• Analgesics  
• Narcotics  
• IV hy dration  
• Bladder irrigation  
• Antispasmodics

DISCONTINUATION/WITH DRAWAL  
7.1 Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
The following criteria do not necessitate withdrawal from the study, but do render the patient 
ineligible to receive any additional infusions of study treatment:  
1. Development of  ≥ Grade 1  acute GVHD within 6  weeks, or a Grade 3 to 4 non -hematologic 
AE within 4 weeks from last PSL dose that is considered related to study treatment 
administration. If t his occurs, the patient’s toxicities will be followed until resolution or 
until the patient’s participation in the study ends.  
2. Receipt of any other hematopoietic stem cell product.  
3. Receipt of therapy for new malignancy.  
4. Occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 CRS. If  this occurs, the patient’s toxicities will be followed 
until resolution or until the patient’s participation in the study ends.  
5. Requirement for prohibited concomitant medication  
6. Pregnancy  
If any of the above criteria are met, every effort should be made to keep the patient in the study 
and continue follow -up. 
7.1.1 Rechallenge  
This section is not applicable.  
7.2 Patient  Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
Participation of a patient in this clinical study may be discontinued for any of the following 
reasons:  
• The patient withdraws consent  
• The patient requests discontinuation from the study for any reason  
• Occurrence of any medical condition or circumstance that exposes the patient to 
substantial risk and/or does not allow the patient to adhere to the requirement s of the 
protocol  
• Any SAE, clinically significant AE, severe laboratory abnormality, intercurrent illness, or 
other medical condition that indicates to the Investigator that continued participation is 
not in the best interest of the patient  
• Patient failure  to comply with protocol requirements or study -related procedures  
• Termination of the study by the Sponsor or the regulatory authority  
If a patient withdraws prematurely from the study due to the above criteria or for any other 
reason, study staff should ma ke every effort to complete the full panel of assessments scheduled 
for the Week 24 (Day 169) Visit. The reason for patient withdrawal must be documented in the 
eCRF . 
AlloVir

Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 48 If the patient  withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor  may re tain and 
continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.  
If a patient  withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and 
not tested, and the Investigator  must document this in the site study records.  
Withdrawn patients will not be replaced.  
7.3 Lost to Follow  up 
A patient  will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.  
The following actions must be taken if a patient  fails to return to the clinic for a required study 
visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact the patient  and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the patient  on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the patient  wishes to and/or should continue in the 
study.  
• Before a patient  is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator  or designee must make 
every effort to regai n contact with the patient  (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if 
necessary, a certified letter to the patient ’s last known mailing address or local equivalent 
methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the patient ’s medical record.  
• Shoul d the patient  continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study.  
Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole are handled as part of Appendix 1  in 
Section  10.1.9 .

• Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA  (Section 1.3). Protocol  
waivers or exemptions are not allowed.  
• Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor  immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the patient  should con tinue or discontinue study 
treatment . 
• Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is 
essential and required for study conduct.  
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
patient s meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator  will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all patient s screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.  
• Procedures conducted as part of the patient ’s routi ne clinical management (eg, blood 
count , local BK viral load, etc. ) and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized 
for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedures met the protocol -specified 
criteria and were performed within the time frame defined in the SoA.  
• At the discretion of the Investigator, and with the exception of Weeks 8 and 12 (which 
must be conducted at the site), study visits for patients who have undetectable BK plasma 
viral load at 2 or more consecutive assessments at least 2 weeks apart after 3 doses may 
be conducted by a Sponsor -approved home health vendor in conjunction with a Sponsor -
approved telehealth provider. These visits may be conducted via video or telephone call.  
• For all patients, a t the discretion of the In vestigator, study visits after Week 12  may be 
conducted by a Sponsor -approved home health vendor in conjunction with a Sponsor -
approved telehealth provider . These visits may be conducted via video or telephone call.  
• Results  (eg, Safety/Laboratory/analyte)  that could unblind the study will not be reported 
to investigative sites or other blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded . 
• The maximum amount of blood collected from each patient  over the duration of the study  
is outlined in the laboratory ma nual. 
• Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues 
with the samples.

• See Appendix 2 (Section 10.2) for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be per formed and 
the SoA ( Section  1.3) for the timing and frequency.  
• The Investigator  must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any 
clinically significant changes occurring during the study as an AE. The laboratory reports 
must be filed with the source documents.  
• Abnormal laboratory findings associated with the u nderlying disease are not considered 
clinically significant unless judged by the Investigator  to be more severe than expected 
for the patient ’s condition.  
• All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation in  the study or within 28 days after the last dose of study treatment  should 
be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered 
clinically significant by the Investigator  or Medical Monitor . 
o If clinically significant  values  do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time 
judged reasonable by the Investigator , the etiology should be identified, and the 
Sponsor  notified.  
o All protocol -required laboratory tests, as defined in Appendix 2  (Section 10.2), must 
be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA ( Section 1.3). 
o If laboratory values from non -protocol specified laboratory tests performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in patient  management or are 
considered clinically signific ant by the Investigator  (eg, SAE or AE or dose 
modification), then the results must be recorded.  
8.2.5 Pregnancy Testing  
A serum pregnancy test will be performed at screening for all patients of childbearing potential. 
A urine pregnancy test will be performed mo nthly for patients who are of childbearing potential. 
See Section 1.3. 
8.2.6 Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Risk Monitoring  
This section is not applicable.  
8.3 Adverse Events , Serious Adverse Events , and Other Safety Reporting  
The definitions of A Es and SAEs can be found in Appendix 3  in Section 10.3. 
The def initions of unsolicited and solicited AEs can be found in Appendix 3  (Section  10.3). 
Adverse events  will be reported by the patient  (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, 
or the patient ’s legally authorized representative).  
The Investigator  and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE a nd remain responsible for following 
up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatment  or study procedures, or that 
caused the patient  to discontinue study treatment  (see Section 7).

Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 52 The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3  
(Section  10.3). 
8.3.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information  
All AEs and SAEs will be collected at the time points specified in the SoA ( Section 1.3) from 
randomization  until study participation is complete . 
Medical occurrences that begin before randomization  but after obtaining informed consen t will 
be recorded as Medical History/Current Medical Conditions, not as AEs. 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor  or designee immediately and under no 
circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 3  (Section 10.3). The 
Investigator  will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor  within 24 hours of it being 
available.  
Investigators are not obligated to act ively seek information on AEs or SAEs after conclusion of 
the study participation . However, if the Investigator  learns of any SAE, including a death, at any 
time after a patient  has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be 
reaso nably related to the study treatment  or study participation, the Investigator  must promptly 
notify the Sponsor . 
8.3.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the patient  is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences.  
8.3.3 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator  is required to proactively follow each patient  at 
subsequent visits/contacts. All  SAEs  and AEs of special interest (as defined in Section  8.3.7 ), 
will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the patient  is 
lost to follow -up (as defined in Section  7.3). Further information on follow -up procedures is 
provided in Appendix 3  (Section 10.3). 
8.3.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
• Prompt notification by the Investigator  to the Sponsor  of an SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the sa fety of patient s and the safety of a 
study treatment  under clinical investigation are met.  
• The Sponsor  has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment  under clinic al 
investigation. The Sponsor  will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards 
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC) , and Investigator s. 
• An Investigator  who receives an Investigator  safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information ( eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor  will 
AlloVir  
Clinical Study Protocol P -105-201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 53 review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the 
IRB/IEC, if appropr iate, according to local requirements.  
• Investigator  safety reports must be prepared for SUSAR s according to local regulatory 
requirements and Sponsor  policy and forwarded to Investigator s as necessary.  
8.3.4.1  Expedited Reporting  
The Sponsor/designee will report a ll relevant information about SUSARs that are fatal or life-
threatening  as soon as possible to the FDA, applicable competent authorities in all the Member 
States concerned, and the Central Ethics Committee, and in any case no later than 7  days after 
knowle dge by the Sponsor/designee of such a case. Relevant follow -up information will 
subsequently be communicated within an additional 8  days.  
All other SUSARs will be reported to the FDA, applicable competent authorities concerned, and 
the Central Ethics Comm ittee concerned as soon as possible but within a maximum of 15 days of 
first knowledge by the Sponsor/designee.  
The Sponsor/designee will also report any additional expedited safety reports required in 
accordance with the timelines outlined in country -specific legislation.  
The Sponsor/designee will also inform all Investigators as required per local regulation.  
The requirements above refer to the requirements relating to the investigational medicinal 
product.  
8.3.5 Pregnancy  
• Details of all pregnancies in female  patient s and female partners of male patient s will be 
collected after the start of study treatment  and until 90 days after the last dose of study 
treatment . 
• If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator  will record pregnancy information on the 
appropriate form and submit it to  the Sponsor  within 24 hours  of learning of the 
pregnancy  of the female patient  or female partner of  a male patient  (after obtaining the 
necessary signed informed consent from the f emale partner).  
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy 
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported 
as an AE or SAE.  
• Abnormal pregnancy outcomes ( eg, spontaneous abortion, feta l death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs and will be reported as 
such.  
• The female patient  or pregnant female partner of a male patient  will be followed to 
determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The Investigator  will collect follow -up 
information on the female patient or pregnant female partner of a male patient and the 
neonate and the information will be forwarded to the Sponsor . 
• Any post -study pregnancy -related SAE considered reasonably related to the study 
treatment  by the Investigator  will be reported to the Sponsor  as described in 
Section  8.3.4 . While the Investigator  is not obligated to actively seek t his information in 
AlloVir  
Clinical Study Protocol P -105-201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 54 former study female patient s or pregnant female partner s of a male patient s, he or she 
may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.  
• Should a female patient  become pregnant during the course of a study, under certain 
circumstances t he study design may allow for the continuation of study treatment . In 
these instances, International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines and local 
regulations must be observed, and appropriate justification given in Section  4.2. In the 
absence of such justification female patient s who become pregnant must be discontinued 
from study treatment .

9.1 Statistical Hypotheses  
No formal hypothesis testing is planned for this study.  
9.2 Sample Size Determination  
Note : “Enrolled” patients are those who have been randomized to a treatment arm .  
 
No formal sample size determination was made for this study, whose primary endpoint is safety 
and tolerability. Approximately 60 patients will be randomized at approximately 38 clinical sites. 
Patients (n=20 i n each arm) will be randomized to receive PSL  
 or placebo.  
Sample size  estimates are based on a one -sided test at the 0.05 level to detect suppression of viral 
load to und etectable levels based on the viral load data from the CHARMS study of multivirus -
specific T cells for patients with a plasma BK viral load <2000  copies/mL . 
 
Patients will be stratified by screening BK viral load  at randomization to ensure equal 
randomizat ion among active and placebo arms for patient populations  
 
 
 A minimum of 6 patients must be enrolled in each stratum, but the 
remaining patients can be enrolled in either stratum.  
9.3 Analysis Sets  
For the purposes of analysis, the following analysis sets are defined:  
Population  Description  
Intent -to-Treat (ITT)  All randomized patients regardless of whether the patient 
receives PSL or placebo. Patients will be analyzed according to 
the randomized study treatment.  
Safety  All randomized patients who receive PSL or place bo. All safety 
analyses will be based on the Safety Population. Patients will be 
analyzed according to the treatment actually received.  
9.4 Statistical Analyses  
The SAP will be finalized prior to database lock , and it will include a more technical and detailed 
description of the statistical analyses described in this section. This section is a summary of the 
planned statistical analyses of the most important endpoints including primary and key secondary 
endpoints.  

AlloVir  
Clinical Study Protocol P -105-201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 57 9.4.1 General Considerations  
Summary statisti cs will be presented by treatment group. Unless otherwise stated, continuous 
variables will be summarized using the number of non -missing observations, arithmetic mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values as descriptive statistics. Cate gorical 
variables will be summarized using the frequency count and the percentage of patients in each 
category as descriptive statistics.  
9.4.2 Primary Endpoint(s)  
The primary endpoint  is safety and tolerability, as assessed by a qualitative analysis of  -treatme nt 
emergent  adverse events (TEAEs) and changes in vital signs, physical exam ination s, clinical 
laboratory assessments, and ECGs . 
9.4.3 Secondary Endpoints  
The key secondary endpoint is change in BK viremia in patients receiving  PSL compared to 
patients receiving  placebo, based on quantitation of viremia performed at the central laboratory.  
9.4.4 Tertiary/Exploratory Endpoint(s)  
Exploratory continuous and categorical efficacy endpoints will be summarized descriptively by 
treatment group and dose cohort using the I ntent -to-Treat (I TT) Population. Categorical 
endpoints will be summarized using number and percentage of patients within each category. For 
time-to-event variables, the Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the median time 
(days) and its 95% confidence in terval . 
9.4.5 Safety  Analysis  
All safety data will be summarized by treatment arm  actually received . Categorical endpoints 
will be summarized using number and percentage of patients within each category. Continuous 
endpoints will be summarized descriptively with  summary statistics (number, mean, standard 
deviation, standard error, median, first quartile, third quartile, minimum, and maximum).  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. A TEAE is 
defined as an AE with a sta rt date and time on or after the first dose of study treatment  and 
through the Week 24 visit . Treatment -emergent AEs  will be summarized by System Organ Class 
and Preferred Term and further by severity (according to the National Cancer Institute [NCI] 
Commo n Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] v5.0) and relationship to study 
treatment. The incidence of SAEs  will be summarized.  
The incidence of AESIs including acute GVHD, CRS , infusion reactions and their corresponding 
exact binomial confidence in tervals with 95% confidence level will be presented by treatment 
group.  Grading criteria for GVHD and CRS are in Appendix 5 in Section  10.5 and Appendi x 6 in 
Section 10.6, respectively . 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for relevant laboratory, vital sign, and ECG data. 
Abnormal laboratory results will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, if applicable. A shift 
table,  presenting the 2 -way frequency tabulation for baseline and the worst post -baseline value 
according to the NCI CTCAE grade, will be provided for selected clinical laboratory tests.  
AlloVir  
Clinical Study Protocol P -105-201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 58 Clinical safety laboratory parameters will be presented in summary tables. Changes from 
baseline in laboratory parameters, vital sign param eters, and quantitative ECG parameters will be 
summarized. Selected laboratory parameters will be summarized in shift tables.  
Statistical comparisons will be carried out using Fisher’s exact test and Student’s  t test. A 1 -sided  
P < .05 will be considered s tatistically significant. Key secondary outcomes such as BK viral load 
assessments  and change in eGFR  (measured by comparing the slope of decline in the eGFR  over 
time) between the placebo group and treatment group will be analyzed using the statistical 
comparisons described above. The baseline demographics of patient s, such as age and gender, 
etc., will also be analyzed to ensure adequate randomization.  
9.4.6 Other Analyses  
In addition to the endpoints described previously, the following endpoints may be analyzed:  
• Frequency and severity (adjudicated Banff classification) of biopsy -proven acute 
allograft rejection in recipients of PSL versus  placebo . 
• Number of patients in the investigational arms with polyomavirus haufen in the urine as 
compared to the plac ebo arm.  
• Quantification of IFN -ɣ (+) T cells specific for BK virus in patients in the investigational 
arms as compared to the placebo arm . 
• Levels of ( virus -specific T cell ) donor T  cell deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA ) as compared 
to patient T cell DNA in perip heral blood . 
• Time to resolution of non -BK target viral infections (ie, associated signs, symptoms, and 
presence/absence of HHV -6, EBV, JCV, and/or AdV viremia) present at the time of 
randomization.  
• Use of immunosuppressive agents, including specific immuno suppressive agents used, 
dosed, and any changes in dose.  
• Number of hospitalizations/re -hospitalizations for any reason and number of days . 
• Incidence and duration of use of any other antiviral therapies during the study.  
• Time to death (from any cause) from the time of randomization.  
• Number of patients with kidney injury requiring hemodialysis .  
• Rate of decline  of BK viremia in recipients of PSL using different dosing intervals versus 
that in patients receiving placebo . 
• Assessment of renal function (eGFR estimated by the creatinine -cystatin C method) . 
Details of these analyses are provided in the SAP. 
9.5 Interi m Analyses  
Administrative interim analyses are planned for the study.  The Sponsor’s study team and 
Investigators will remain blinded to individual pati ent data during and after the administrative 
interim analyses.  All administrative  interim analyses  will be conducted by the Sponsor . 
AlloVir  
Clinical Study Protocol P -105-201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 59 • The first  administrative  interim analysis will be performed by the Sponsor when 12 
patients in Stratum 1  have 
completed 8 weeks in the study . 
• The second administrative interim analysis will be performed when 30 patients have 
completed 8 weeks in the study . 
• Interim analyses may be omitted or added at the discretion of the Sponsor to allow for 
long term planning, and to assess ending the study  or either arm  early . 
9.5.1 Stopping Criteria  
9.5.1.1  Stopping Criteria for Individual Patients  
As GVHD and CRS are  theoretical safety concern s associated with administration of third -party 
allogenei c T cells, the incidence and severity of GVHD  and CRS  will be monitored during the 
study.  
No patients will be permitted to receive a second infusion of PSL or placebo  if they develop new 
onset GVHD  ≥Stage 1  or CRS Grade  2 at the proposed time of infusion of any subsequent  
dose. 
After the first 3 doses, patients who have undetectable BK plasma viral load at 2 or more 
consecutive assessments at least 2 weeks apart will discontinue PSL infusions.  
9.5.1.2  Stopping Criteria for the Study  
Randomization into the study will be halted if 3 patients experience SAEs that meet the 
following criteria:  
• ≥CTCAE Grade 3 , 
• Considered related by the Investigator , 
• Occur during Period 1 following the initial dose , AND  
• Cannot be reasonably attributed to the patient’s underlying disease, other medical 
condition, or concomitant medications . 
If this occurs, randomization will not resume until the DSMB has thoroughly reviewed all safety 
data to date and concluded that it is safe for the study to continue.

Women in the following categories are considered WOCBP (fertile):  
1. Following menarche  
2. From the time of m enarche until becoming post -menopausal unless permanently sterile 
(see below)  
• A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause.  
o A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range 
may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence 
of 12 months of amenorrhea, c onfirmation with more than one FSH measurement 
is required.  
o Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 
one of the non -estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they 
wish to continue their HRT during th e study. Otherwise, they must discontinue 
HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.  
• Permanent sterilization methods (for the purpose of this study) include:  
o Documented hysterectomy  
o Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
o Docume nted bilateral oophorectomy  
o For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other 
than the above,  (eg, Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity, gonadal 
dysgenesis), Investigator  discretion should be applied to determining study entry.  
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the patient ’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• If fertility is unclear ( eg, amenorrhea in adolesce nts or athletes) and a menstrual cycle 
cannot be confirmed before first dose of study treatment , additional evaluation should 
be considered.  
Woman of Nonchildbearing Potential (WONCBP)  
Women in the following categories are considered WONCBP:

a. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause.  
i. A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or HRT. 
However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with more 
than one FSH measurement >40 IU/L or mIU /mL is required.  
ii. Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt must discontinue HRT 
to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.

Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 76 10.4.2  Contraception Guidance  
CONTRACEPTIVESa ALLOWED DURING THE STUDY INCLUDE:  
Highly Effective Methodsb That Have Low User Dependency Failure rate of <1% per year when used 
consistently and correctly.  
• Implantable progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation c  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS) c 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Azoospermic partner (vasectomized or due to a medical cause)  
Azoospermia is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of 
the woman of childbearing potential and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly 
effective method of contraception should be used. Spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days.  
Note: documentation of azoospermia for a male patient  can com e from the site personnel’s review of the 
patient ’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview. ) 
Highly Effective Methodsb That Are User Dependent Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and 
correctly.  
Combined (estrog en- and progestogen -containing)  hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationc 
− oral 
− intravaginal  
− transdermal  
− injectable  
Progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation c 
− oral 
− injectable  
Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment . The reliability of sexual abstinence 
needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient .) 
Effective Methodsd That Are Not Considered Highly Effective Failure rate of ≥1% per year when used  
consistently and correctly.  
• Progestogen -only oral hormonal contraception where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action  
• Male or female condom with or without spermicide  
• Cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide  
• A combination of male condom with either cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (double -barrier 
methods)e 
a) Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods 
for those participating in clinical studies.  
b) Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Typical use failure rates differ from those when used 
consistently and correctly.  
c.) If locally required , in accordance with Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) g uidelines, acceptable contraceptive 
methods are limited to those which inhibit ovulation as the primary mode of action.  
d) Considered effective, but not highly effective - failure rate of ≥1% per year. Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, 
post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) are 
not acceptable methods of contraception.  
e) Male condom and female condom should not be used together (due to risk of failure from friction).

Note: Organ toxicities associated with CRS may be graded according to CTCAE v5.0 but they do not influence CRS grading.  
Note: Grade 5 CRS is defined as death due to CRS , in which another cause is not the principle factor leading t o the outcome.  
1  Fever is defined as temperature 38.0C not attributable to any other cause. In patients who have CRS and then receive 
antipyretic or anticytokine therapy such as tocilizumab or steroids, fever is no longer required to grade subsequent CRS 
severity. In this case, CRS grading is driven by hypotension and/or hypoxia.  
2  CRS grade is determined by the more severe event: hypotension or hypoxia not attributable to any other cause. For example, 
a patient with temperature of 39.5 C, hypotension  requiring 1 vasopressor, and hypoxia requiring low -flow nasal cannula is 
classified as grade 3 CRS.

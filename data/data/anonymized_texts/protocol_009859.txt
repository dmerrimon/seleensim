4 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Study Synopsis  
This is an exploratory (n=10-12 evaluable patients), open- label, single -arm, phase 
II study in patients with ‘non -inflamed’ unresectable regional or distant metastatic 
melanomas irrespective of prior treatment with PD -1/PD -L1 pathway inhibitors. 
The primary endpoint is to assess the inc idence of histopathologic conversion of 
non-inflam ed melanomas from patients with metastatic melanoma to ‘infla med’ 
melanoma following single -agent entinostat “priming ” (entinostat monotherapy) . 
More specifically, patients with metastatic melanomas that have no evidence of 
tumor- infiltrating  or tumor -associated  lymphocytes (TIL /TAL ), based on standard 
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain ing of representative tumor sections (non-
inflamed melanomas) will receive weekly entinostat for 3 weeks in cycle 1  
(entinost at monotherapy; 5mg PO, qwk on D1, D8, D15 of cycle 1; cycle length = 
21 days ). Mandatory tumor tissue biopsies will be performed in the end of cycle 1, 
beginning of cycle 2 ( day 22± 2 days ), immediately before treatment with 
concurrent entinostat (once weekly × 3)  and pembrolizumab (200 mg q3wks) in 
cycles 2 -9 (see section 5.2.1 drug dosing schema) . Correlative studies will be 
performed at baseline and in the end of cycle 1, beginning of cycle 2 ( day 22± 2 
days) to assess whether : (a) 3 weeks of entinostat monotherapy converts TIL/TAL -
absent melanomas to TIL /TAL -present by histopatholog ic (H&E stain ) analysis, 
(b) 3 weeks of single- agent entinostat induces changes in gene expression profiling 
by assessing distinct signatures  as defined  by RNA-sequencing signatures (RNA -
seq; ‘immune -high’ , innat e anti- PD-1 resistance [IPRES] , and  epigene tic 1-3), (c) 
3 weeks of single -agent entinostat induces changes in histone -accessible DNA by  
performing  formaldehyde- assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE )4, (d) 
conversion of non- inflamed to inflamed melanomas by single -agent entinostat 
and/or antitumor response to the entinostat -pembrolizumab combination is 
associated with a baseline signature that consists of distinct somatic mutation gene 
profile, global histone modification profile  in melanoma tissue or peripheral bloo d 
mononuclear cells (PBMC), and/or a bundance of entinostat targets in melanoma 
cells (HDAC 1, 2, 3, and 11) . Up to 12 evaluable patients will be treated with 
entinostat plus pembrolizumab for up to 27  weeks (approximately 6 months) based 
on clinical benefit. Patients who continue to have clinical benefit at  27 weeks may 
continue therapy with pembrolizumab or any other PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitor , as per 
standard of care.  
 Secondar y exploratory endpoints involve : (a) assessment of antitumor response of 
entinostat administered concurrent ly with pembrolizumab at week 10(or earlier if 
patient progresses), based on response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). (b) assessment of the progression- free 
survival (PFS) rate at 27  weeks (approximately 6 months) of the entinostat -
pembrolizumab combination.  (c) determine the safety of the entinostat -
pembrolizumab combination in patients with metastatic melanoma per NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI- CTCAE). (d) assessment

5 of other exploratory biomarkers in tumor tissue and peripheral blood (see 
‘Secondary Correlative Studies”).  
1.2 Disease Background  
1.2.1  Melanoma Heterogeneity  
Melanoma is derived from malignant transfo rmation of melanocytes, neural crest -
derived cells that produce melanin and at least for  the skin protect basal cells 
of the skin from the effects of ultraviolet radiation  (UVR) .  Cutaneous melanoma 
represents t he most common melanoma subtype  (approximat ely 95% ); other non-
cutaneous melanomas are mucosal (1.3% total; conjunctival, sinonasal cavity, 
anorectal, oral cavity)
5, and ocular (3 -5%; choroidal, iris, and ciliary body)6. 
Alternative to the clinical -anatomic heterogeneity, melanomas can be 
histogenetical ly classified as epithelium- associated (high UVR-induced  lentigo 
maligna, desmoplastic; low  UVR-induced  non-chronic sun damag e melanomas, 
spitzoid melanomas; mucosal;  and acral melanomas) and non- epithelium -
associated (uveal, visceral, blue -nevus- like, melanoma in congenital nevus). 
Irrespective of the method of classification, melanoma subtypes exhibit stark 
molecular differences (e.g. high incidence of BRAF  codon V600, NRAS codon 12 , 
13, 61 mutations in cutaneous;  low incidence of BRAFV600, NRAS codon 12, 13, 
51 mutations in mucosal;  high incidence  of cKIT mutations in acral; high incidence 
of GNAQ/GNAS mutations in ocular melanomas)7-10 as well as differences in 
underlying host immune response9-11. For example, t he Cancer Genome Atlas 
Project (TCGA) in Cutaneous Melanoma (n=329) has sh own that approximately 
50% of melanomas bear the ‘inflamed’ phenotype that is defined by the presence 
of a pleomorphic immune cell population that includes lymphocytic and other 
stromal infiltrate  and contains various co -stimulatory and co- inhibitory immune 
checkpoint proteins8. In contrast, the TCGA Project in Primary Ocular Melanoma 
(n=80) showed that the incidence of TIL  was only in 13% of primary ocular 
melanoma specimens 11. Finally, a single institution analysis in primary or al 
mucosal melanomas showed that high density o f TIL  was present in only 22% of 
patients 12. Interestingly, the heterogeneity of host immune response across 
different melanoma su btypes is a  poor prognostic factor. M ore specifically , 
melanomas with high density of TIL  have better overall survival and vice versa . 
The stark differences in the somatic mutation burden, distinct somatic mutations, and host immune response among different melanoma subtypes 
7,10,13 suggests that 
aberrations other than genetic  changes may play a role. An increasing number of 
reports summarize that epigenetic dysregulation by means of microRNA expression, gene hypermethylation, and histone modification plays a role across various melanoma subtypes  
14,15.

1.2.2  Differential Responses of Various Melanoma Subtypes to Available Systemic 
Treatment s; Interplay with Underlying Biology and Host Immune Response  
Existing systemic treatments for metastatic melanoma exhibit different clinical benefit across different melanoma subtypes , and irrespective of treatment type (i.e. 
immunotherapies versus targeted therapies). For example, a large proportion of 
patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma who receive any type  of systemic 
treatment have both high response rates and durable clinical benefit [ concurrent 
dabrafenib and trame tinib, response rate (RR)  67%, 3-year OS rate  44%; 
single- agent ipilimumab, RR 7-19% , 3-year OS rate  22%; single -agent 
nivolumab, RR  43.7-44% , 3-year OS rate 35%; single -agent pembrolizumab 
RR 33%, 3-year OS rate 38-43%; concurrent nivolumab and ipilimumab RR  
52-57.7% , 2-year OS rate 67%] 
16-21. However , RR in mucosal /acral (m/a)  and 
ocular (o) melanoma to immune checkpoint inhibitors  is lower [ single -agent 
ipilimumab  (m/a) 0-8.3%, single-agent pembrolizumab (m/a)25%, concurrent 
pembrolizumab plus ipilimumab (m/a) 20%; single- agent nivolumab 
(m) 23.2%, concurrent nivolumab plus ipilimumab (m)  37.2% ; single -agent 
PD-1 inhibitors (a)  32%, single -agent PD-1 inhibitors (m) 23%; single -agent 
D-1/PD -L1 inhibitors (o)  2.6% ; concurrent ipilimumab plus nivolumab (o) 0] 
22-26. Lower responses have also been seen in  mucosal or acral melanomas that are 
BRAFV600 -mutant to MAPK inhibitors (BRAF inhibitors (m) 38.1%, 
(a)20%) 27. Interestingly , presence of TIL has been predictive of response to 
BRAF inhibitors (BRAFV600 -mutant), ipilimumab, and PD -1 inhibitors in 
cutaneous metastatic melanoma28-32. Given that availa ble systemic treatments have 
better clinical benefit in melanomas with pre -existing host immune response 
(inflamed) and the incidence of infla med melanomas differs according to 
melanoma subtype (e.g. in the two melanoma TCGA  project s inflamed cutaneous 
melanomas were approximately 51% whereas inflamed ocular melanomas were 
12% respectively ), these data imply  that such treatments may have clinical benefit 
in a subset o f all melanomas.  It is therefore accurate to postulate that by being able 
to alter the biology of melanomas towards a more immunogenic/’ infla med’  
phenotype , it is possible to augment the response of  immunotherapies to non-
infla med melanomas which  do not usually respond to systemic treatment s. 
Such strategies are expected to expand the therapeutic benefit in the non -‘inflamed’  
melanomas.  
 
1.3 Current Standard of Care  
Multiple systemic treatments have now been approved in metastatic cutaneous 
melanoma, such as immunother apies { high- dose bolus IL -233, CTLA- 4 inhibitors 
(ipilimumab)34, PD -1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab)35-37], targeted 
therapies [BRAF inhibitors (dabrafenib, vemurafenib) and MEK inhibitors (trametinib, cobimetinib)
38,39]}, and chemotherapies (dacarbazine)40. BRAF 
inhibitors and MEK inhibitors are used in combination (i.e. vemurafenib plus cobimetinib and dabrafenib with trametinib) because of their superiority over single- agent BRAF inhibitors in patients with BRAFV600 -mutant metastatic

7 melanoma17,39. No predictive biomarkers exist for any immunotherapy type, and 
BRAFV600 mutation status or any other distinct somatic mutation does  not 
influence response to such treatments36,37. However , underlying host immune 
response alone and/or in association with intratumoral expression of PD -L1 in the 
vicinity of TIL may predict better responses and clinical benefit to any 
immunotherapy, in particular to  single-agent PD-1 inhibitors29,32. Concurrent 
blockade of CTLA -4 (ipilimumab) and PD -1 (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) has 
shown to have higher antitumor responses  compared to single -target blockade  and 
with toxicity that is life -threatening , but dependent on the ipilimumab  dose 21,41. 
However , no overall survival (OS) benefit was seen in the randomized study 
between concurrent ipilimumab -nivolumab versus nivolumab alone, except for the 
unplanned subgroup analysis of patients with PD- L1 negative tumors42.  
There are no established guidelines regarding the sequence of systemic therapies 
(immunotherapies first followed by targeted therapies or  vice versa ), which is 
currently the primary aim o f the intergroup EA6134 randomized ongoing study. 
Upfront single -agent CTLA -4 or PD -1 inhibitors  followed by MAPK inhibitors  
conferred longer OS  compared to the reverse sequence  in patients with 
BRAFV600 -mutant melanoma  43,44. Guidelines regarding upfront concurrent PD -1 
and CTLA -4 blockade , as opposed to single PD -1 blockade , are not defined  at this 
time, although symptomatic disease or fast melanoma kinetics favor the ir combined 
use. It appears though that resistance t o one immunotherapy type (ipilimumab, PD -
1 inhibitor, or high dose bolus IL -2) does not predict  cross -resistance to any other 
immunotherapy type  45,46. Upfront treatment with PD -1 inhibitors (as oppose d to 
ipilimumab) is associated with  longer OS  than upfront treatment with ipilimumab47.  
Non-cutaneous melanoma subtypes are conventionally treated similarly to 
cutaneous melanoma, although most  registration studies did not include non-
cutaneous melanoma subtypes. As summarized in section 1.2.2, immunotherapies 
consistently underperform in the non- cutaneous melanoma subtypes (and acral 
melanoma), suggesting the need to improve the therapeutic benefit of immunotherapies.  
As of June 2018, efforts to improve the clinical benefit of immun e checkpoint 
inhibitors in melanoma focu s on the following strategies:  
a) combine PD -1/PD -L1 pathway inhibitors with MAPK inhibitors in 
BRAFV600 -mutant ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], atezolizumab plus vemurafenib plus 
cobimetinib48; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], pembrolizumab, encorafenib, binimetinib), 
b) combine PD -1/PD -L1 pathway inhibitors with other non- CTLA -4 blocking 
antibody therapies49, 
c) combine PD -1/PD -L1 pathway inhibitors with drugs targeting 
immunoregulatory components of the tumor microenvironment   (e.g. I DO 
inhibitors50), and  
d) adoptive T cell therapy in combination with lymphodepletion (fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide) and high dose bolus IL-2
51.

8  
These approaches are expected to enhance the therapeutic benefit of immune 
checkpoint inhibitors by bypassing issues of local immune tolerance. However, with the exception of treatment strategies that directly target melanoma (e.g. MAPK inhibitors) immunotherapeutic -based strategies are not expected to have an effect , 
if melanomas are not immunogenic 
52. Based on the estimate  from TCGA in 
cutaneous melanoma s, lack of immunogenicity is seen in up to 50% of cutaneous 
melanoma  cases 13. Cancer i mmunogenicity and antigenicity is a complex 
phenomenon that dynamically changes as cancer s develop, establish and progress.  
While during early stages of cancer development both immunoreactive and non-
immunoreactive tumor clones may be present, the process of cancer immunoediting may gradually eliminate the former whereas the latter may be left unchecked and grow 
53.  Another important issue is that i mmunogenicity and antigenicity are not 
strictly dependent on the number of somatic mutations,  although admittedly various 
studies have shown a moderate but significant benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with high neoantigen burden and acr oss various cancers 
54. 
There is a growing number of reports  that resistance to various FDA -approved 
treatments in metastatic melanoma – both targete d therapies and immunotherapies – 
is also transcriptionally/epigenetically  mediated  55. Therefore, i t is tempting to 
speculate that drugs which  affect transcription may potentially render less 
immunoreactive tumors to more immunoreactive .  
  
1.4 Investigational Treatment s 
 
1.4.1  Epigenetic Dysregulation and not Somatic Mutations Per Se May Account 
for Poor Immunogenicity of Melanomas and Resistance to PD- 1 Inhibitors  
Understanding resistance to PD -1 inhibitors, the systemic therapy with the largest 
clinical benefit -to-toxicity ratio  in melanoma , is of great importance to expand the 
clinical benefit in metastatic melanoma and other cancers. With the possible exception of BRCA -2, no genes were more frequently mutated in responders versus 
non responders to PD- 1 inhibitors 
2,56. Transcriptional analysis of tumors collected 
from patients who responded versus those who resisted PD -1 inhibitors showed that 
gene signatures associated with mesenchymal transition (AXL, ROR2, WNT5A, LOXL2, TWIST2, TAGLN, FAP, loss of E-cadherin), immunosuppression/angiogenesis (IL10, VEGFA, VEGFC), monocyte/macrophage chemotactic genes (CCL2, CCL7, CCL8, CCL13) , and low 
MHC class II expression was associated with poor response to PD1 inhibitors 
2,57,58. 
This su ggests that epigenetic , in addition  to genetic changes , by melanoma cells 
may drive the PD-1 inhibitor resistance phenotype. 
 
1.4.2  Overview of Epigenetics with Focus on Histone Deacetylases  
Epigenetic regulation involves heritable  modification s to DNA that alter gene 
expression and chromatin structure without changes to the underlying nucleotide 
LCCC 1729  CONFIDENTIAL

Amendment 2    December 15, 2021  
 
9 DNA sequence. This non- genetic type of regulation shifts chromatin between two  
interchangeable states: closed (hetero -chromatin) and open (eu-chromatin). 
Depending on the chromatic structure genes can be switched ‘on’ and ‘off’ by 
allowing/restricting access and/or function of components of the transcriptional 
machinery (RNA polymerase and DNA -binding transcription factors)59. Epigene tic 
dysregulation is now a well -established mechanism of melanoma development and 
progression. Epigenetic changes include : (1) DNA methyl ation in CpG 
dinucleotides  enriched in regions known as ‘ CpG islands ’. This process is more 
permanent , because methylated gene promoters along with the recruitment of bulky 
MB methyl -CpG- binding proteins by means of direct steric hindrance block 
binding of  transcription factors and RNA polymerase leading up to a  closed 
heterochromatin state , and therefore transcriptional repression/silencing . For 
example, the promoter of cell cycle genes corresponding to the CDKN2A gene locus is hypermethylated in cutaneous  and uveal melanomas 
60. In addition, 
promoters of more than 50 other genes with tumor suppressive function are  
hypermethylated during melanoma development, progression, and metastases (reviewed in 
61). To make matters more complex , hypomethylation, both global as 
well as gene- specific, can also occu r; in the case of melanoma, the promoter of 
genes encoding several cancer testis and melanoma- associated antigens  can be 
hypomethylated resulting in increased expression (reviewed in 61). (2) histone  
modifications  which are more dynamic, diverse, and are mediated by multiple 
mechanisms, such as post- transla tional modifications of histo ne proteins 
(acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination), ATP -dependent 
chromatin remodeling complexes, histone variant exchanges, and the action of non-
coding RNA (e.g. miRNA). Histone methylation is more complex to predict the 
effect in gene transcription becau se it is dependent on the extent  of methylation 
[e.g. mono- (me1), di - (me2) , or tri -methylation  (me3 )]. It is important to mention 
that promoter methylation can affect histone activity and, vice versa , histone 
acetylation affects promoter methylation levels62.  
Reversible acetylation of lysine residues  on the tails and other more internal 
residues of histone proteins, H3 and H4 (e.g. H3K9, H3K14, H4K5, H4K16) , is the 
best studied type of histone modific ation  and is catalyzed by the transfer of acetyl 
group from acetyl- CoA to the ε -amino group at the terminal of the lysine side chain 
by means of histone acetyl transferases (HAT) . The addition of the acetyl group 
neutralize s the lysine’s positive charge, thereby weakening the interaction with the 
negatively charged DNA , and leads to a more open chromatin structure allow ing 
easier access to transcriptio n factors and increased transcription. Histone 
acetylation also influences transcription by acting as a binding target for histone reader groups and regulates (prevents) deposition of other histone marks, such as  
the transc riptionally permissive H3K4me3 or the repressive H3K27me3  
modification
63. On the other hand, these acetyl groups are removed by histone 
deacetylases (HDAC s). HDACs are divided into 4 classes  on the basis of structural 
homology to yeast HDACs, mechanism of enzyme activity, and ce llular 
localization. The ‘classic’, or type I, are ubiquitously expressed in all cell types and mostly localized to the nucleus  (1, 2, 3, and 8). Type II are more restricted in distinct 
LCCC 1729  CONFIDENTIAL

Amendment 2    December 15, 2021  
 
10 cell types (smooth muscle, heart, pancreas, and brain) and shuttle between the 
nucleus and cytosol (4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10) . Type III (NAD -dependent sirtuins  1-7) 
possess dual enzymatic activity that includes mono -ADP -ribosyl transferase, in 
addition to the HDAC activity. In addition, type III HDAC s have various 
subcellular organizations other than the nucleus (cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nucleolus) . Class IV  HDACs have similar localization to class II ( HDAC11)
64.  
The clinical significance of HDAC s in cancer is that HDAC1, 2, 3, and 6 are  
upregulated in various cancers . Compared to normal skin and nevi , primary 
cutaneous melanomas overexpress HDAC1, 2, and 365. However, i n metastatic 
cutane ous melanoma, expression of  class I HDACs can be upregulated , but without 
any prognostic significanc e 66. Finally, HDACs sand HAT s have histone -
independent targets, such as HSP90, TP 53, and the NFκB subunit p65 with 
significant cellular effects. For example, hyperacetylation of HSP90 via class I HDAC inhibition may lead to degradation of signaling molecules ( c-RAF, Akt)  or 
upstream receptor tyrosine kinases (ERBB1 and ERBB2)  and may t herefore 
account for resistance to MAPK inhibitors . Hyperacetylation of TP53 may 
similarly alter melan oma resistance to therapy whereas NF -κB activation may alter 
cytokine production, anti- apoptotic protein transcription , and immune response
67.   
1.4.3  Histone Acetylation, HDAC I nhibitors and Direct E ffects i n Melanoma  Cells  
As expected , HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) modulate expression of thousands of 
genes in melanoma .  More specifically,  HDACi inhibit expression of anti -apoptotic 
proteins survivin, bcl -XL, blc-2, Mcl -1, XIAP, reduce expression of cFLIP, an 
inhibi tor of TNF -related apoptosis, and induce expression of pro- apoptotic proteins 
BIM, BAX, BAK, an d CDKN1A68. Equally important, class I HDACi may alter 
immunogenicity by upregulating expression of melanoma differentiation  antigens , 
class I  and class II  MHC antigens, antigen processing and presenting machinery 
(TAP1, TAP2, LMP2, LMP7, tapasin, CIIA), costimulatory molecules  (CD40, 
CD86) , ligands of activating receptor on NK cells (MICA, MICB), and PD-L1/PD -
L2 genes  in vitro  69-72. The ultimate effect of HDAC inhibition in melanoma can 
be suppression of cell proliferation, increased immunogenicity,  and increased 
apoptosis .  
 
1.4.4  Histone Acetylation, HDAC I nhibitors and E ffects on Host Immune 
Response 
It is important to emphasize that DNA methylation and histone modifications 
regulate  development, differentiation, activation, and memory lineage function  of 
host immune response 73. In particula r, selective demethylation of several specific 
CpG dinucleotides in the promoter region of IFN -γ, IL-3 and IL -13 genes regulate 
T helper cell differentiation  into Th1, Th2, Th17 and induction of  regulatory T cells . 
Signaling through cytokines activates transcription factors (STAT4, STAT6, 
GATA- 4, T -bet), which facilitate s chromatin remodeling (long- range H4 
acetylation, H3K9 trimethylation)  at the enhancer regions  of T helper cell -specific 
gene s and  ultimately influences activation and T cell differentiatio n (reviewed in 
74).

11 Not surprisingly, HDACi have pleiotropic effects on immune cells. Therefore, the 
net ef fect remains ill- defined as HDACi can  also impair immune surveillanc e and 
induce hematologic toxicity in cancer patients depending on the dose, type and 
selectivity of HDACi used . For example, panobinostat can have differential effect s 
on T cell viability and function, depending on the dose used 75,76. Similar dose-
dependent results were seen with entinostat  77. Nevertheless, several positive effects 
of HDACi were seen , such as the  activation  and inhibition of apoptosis  of CD4+  
cells78, CD8+ cells79, macrophages80, T regulatory cells81, and myeloid- derived 
suppressor cells (MDSC) 82. 
 1.4.5  Preclinical Evidence about the Role of Histone Deacetylation Inhibition in Melanoma Treatment with a pan -HDACi  (LBH589) enhanced survival and proliferation of 
tumor antigen- specific T cells and suppressed  the T regulatory (Treg) population 
when coadministered with gp100- specific T cells in a B16 melanoma model  
79. The 
pan-HDACi lost its  antitumor effect in immunodeficient as opposed to 
immunocompetent mice 70. Concurrent LBH589 (15mg/kg, M -W-F) and PD -1 
blockade (3mg/kg, Tu- Th) in C57BL/6 mice showed delayed growth and enhanced 
survival of B16- F10-bearing melanoma tumors69, similar to results seen in a lung 
adenocarcinoma model83. Entinostat has effects in MDSC  82,84, Treg 81, and 
dendritic cells85. When administered as a single- agent orally no antitumor 
responses were seen in patients with metastatic melanoma86.  
 
1.4.6  Entinostat  
 
1.4.6.1 Non -Clinical studie s 
Entinostat (pyridine -3-yl)methyl((4-[ (2-aminophenyl)carbamoyl]phenyl) methyl)  
carbamate), or SNDX -275, MS -275 is an orally available inhibitor of HDACs 1,  2, 
3, and 11 [IC 50 (nM) 124, 139, 187, 427, respectively]. The selectivity of entinostat 
for these HDAC isoforms may account for its better safety and efficacy compared to other nonselective pan- HDAC inhibitors
87,88. Exposure of various cancer cell 
lines to entinostat resulted in accumulation of hyperacetylated histones at 
concen tration between 0.3-1 µM and gene expression changes in various cell 
processes, such as cell growth, apoptosis, differentiation, cell communication, 
regulation of transcription, cell signaling, and chromosome organization. Entinostat 
demonstrated broad, dose -dependent, tumor- inhibitory effect s against cancer cell 
lines with IC 50 values rang ing between  0.04-4.71 µM. Entinostat showed tumor 
growth inhibition in human tumor xenografts from diverse cancer types , such as  
melanoma, non- small cell lung cancer, and breast cancer . The maximum tolerated 
dose in the animal experiments was 50mg/kg daily. 
As predicted by its epigenetic mechanism of action, entinostat may restore 
sensitivity in resistant cancer cell lines in vitro  and in vivo  when combined with  
various classes of anticancer agents, such as  chemotherapies, anti-estrogens, EGFR 
inhibitors , DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors  and immunotherapies .

12 Examples of entinostat in combination with hormonal therapies (aroma tase 
inhibitor , selective estrogen modulators)  and DNA methylase transferase inhibitors 
(‘dual epigenetic blockade’ ) are provided in  the Investigators’ Brochur e and 
elsewhere89,90.  
Proof-of- principle experiments in syngeneic murine models that  bear poor or 
modestly immunogeni c tumors suggest that resistance to concurrent CTLA -4 and 
PD-1 blockade can be restored with entinostat. In these models primary targets of 
entinostat were actually circulating granulocytic MDSC, which are known to be 
immunosuppressive, where as the functio n of CD8+ cells remained intact82. In other 
preclinical models entinostat reduced transcription of FoxP3 in circulating Treg, an 
important transcr iption factor for survival and function of this other 
immunosuppressive population81. In other clinical models entinostat can induce 
favorable changes in effector T cell response again st cancer cells91. The entinostat -
induced reduction of circulat ing MDSC was confirmed in a clinical study of 
entinostat in combination with aromasin compared with aromasin alone  84. 
Reduction of circulating Tregs and monocytic MDSC was also seen in a clinical 
trial of entinostat administered in combination with high dose bolus IL -2 in patients  
with advanced renal cell carcinoma  92. Entinostat also showed single- agent activity 
against xenograft melanoma models93 and in combination w ith temozolomide65 and 
interleukin -294.  
Entinostat administered in rats a t doses comparable to those currently used in 
clinical studie s had no effects  in various physiologic systems (cardiovascular, 
central nervous, respiratory, GI, and urogenital) , with the exception of diuresis and 
increased excretion of Na+, K+, Cl -, and creatinine.  
Pharmacokinetic studies of entinostat administered across various animal models show considerable differences with respect to oral bioavailability, serum half -life 
(t ½), area -under- curve (AUC)  exposure , peak serum concentrations (C
max), time -
to-peak serum  concentrations (t max). Food decreased absorption of entinostat. The 
highest serum concentrations were seen in liver, kidney, spleen, and glandular 
tissue. Entinostat was moderately stable in preparation of human hepatocytes and 
liver microsomes. Reversible inhibition by entinostat was demonstrated for CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 and glycuronidation was the major method of metabolism. Entinostat is excreted equally by urine and biliary tract.  
Toxicologic studies of entinostat across various animals suggested effects on the 
skin, atrophy of lymphatic organs, myelosuppression, GI toxicity, loss of appetite, weight loss, changes in renal function, hypercholesterolemia, reduce d fertility , and 
teratogenicity.  
 1.4.6.2 Effects of Entinostat in Humans As of September 29 2016, Entinostat has been administered in >1,000 cancer 
patients across pharma- sponsored studies (Syndax, Syndax predecessors, NCI, 
Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd - the company that bears development and 
commercialization rights of entinostat in Japan and Korea) . This number does not

13 include patients who were treated as part of investigator -initiated studies . In 
particular, clinical studies investigated entinostat as monotherapy [6 studies had 
reportable data  at the time; 4 studies in patients with solid tumors (n= 128), and 2 
studies in patients with hematologic malignancies (n= 89)] and in combination with 
other systemic treatments [ 22 studies had reportable data  at the time ; 17 studies in 
patients with solid tumors (n=535) and 5 in patients with hematologic malign ancies 
(n=205)]. 
1.4.6.2.1 Pharmacokine tic Studies 
Pharmacokinetic data, which were compiled from 4 studies, showed linear 
dose- dependent pharmacokinetics based on single and repeated dose 
administrations. Entinostat absorption  is facilitated by low pH in the stomach 
and its metabolism is mediated by UGT 1 A4, but not by CYP enzymes. 
Entinostat mean terminal  t1/2 was approximately 194 hours based on the 
radiolabeled absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME ) study 
with the majority of the radioactive dose excreted in urine (71%) and feces 
(12%). Entinostat and/or its metabolites partition preferentially into 
erythrocytes, wi th greater affinity to binding sites on erythrocytes relative to 
those in pl asma. In fact, the slow dissoci ation rate of entinostat fr om 
erythrocytes may account for the long  t½ of entinostat.  
1.4.6.2.2 Safety  in Human Clinical Studies  
An integrated analysis across all industry -sponsored and NCI -sponsored studies 
with available safety data showed that single- agent entinostat was well tolerated 
at the doses and schedules inv estigated. The most frequent adverse effects  (AE) , 
predominantly grade 1 -2, included fatigue, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, 
diarrhea, hematologic abnormalities (anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia), and metabolic abnormalities (hypoalbuminemia, 
hypophosphatemia, hyperglycemia, and hyponatremia) . Certain types of AE s 
were more frequent in patients with solid tumors than in those with hematologic 
malignancies; for example, hypoalbuminemia (59%), fatigue (58%), nausea (57%), hypophosphatemia (45%), anemia (42%), and thrombocytopenia (41%) were more frequent in  patient s with solid tumors whereas thrombocytopenia 
(52%), anemia (36%), neutropenia (36%), fatigue (35%), and nausea (34%) were more frequent in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. Similar patterns and incidence for serious adverse events ( SAE s, grade 3 and 4) 
were seen for all AE s in patients with solid tumors versus hematologic 
malignancies.  The most SAE s occurring in >5% of patients with solid tumors 
included fatigue (13%), dyspnea (9%), dehydration (9%), infection (9%), anemia (7%) and neutropenia (7%). The most  common  SAE s in patients with 
hematologic malignancies were neutropenic infection (15%)  and febrile 
neutropenia (12%). Fatal (grade 5) events were febrile neutropenia, respiratory failure, neutropenic infection, and disease progression; almost all occurred in 
patients with hematologic malignancies.  
Entinostat has been combined with other systemic treatments [aromatase inhibitors (n=111), erlotinib (n=99), 5-azacytidine (n=319), other agents (13 -

14 cis-retinoic acid, interleukin -2, sorafenib, lapatinib, trastuzumab, nivolumab, 
ipilimumab; n=211)]. In general, AE s were  seen regardless of indication , such 
as fatigue, nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, diarrhea, vomiting, 
and neutropenia. Again, patients with hematologic malignancies t rended to 
have hi gher incidence s of both AEs and SAE s (62% versus 45%) . The incidence 
of SAE s was also high in patients receiving entinostat in combination with 
azacytidine  (43%). The most frequent SAE s that occurred in entinostat -based 
studies in 535 patients wi th solid tumors were decreased absolute lymphocyte 
count (7%), fatigue (7%), dyspnea (6%), and anemia (5%). Fatal AEs were 
reported in 15% of the 740 patients treated with entinostat in combination with 
other agents and were at least twice  more frequent in patients with hematologic 
malignancies compared to those with solid tumors. However, approximately 90% of the fatal AE s were attributed to disease progression.  
1.4.6.2. Efficacy  in Cancer Clinical Studies  
Table 1 shows several phase I/II studies of entinostat administered in various 
schedules alone or in combination with systemic therapies with different mechanisms of action (hormonal, targeted, dual epigenetic blockade, immunomodulators). Entinostat exhibited clinical benefit  either as monotherapy or 
in combination with other therapies, including cancer types with resistance to standard of care therapies. B ased on thes e results  entinostat (5mg po qwk) is 
currently being investigated in combination with exemestane (25mg po qd) in 
patients with advanced hormone recept or-positive, HER2- negative breast cancer 
with prior disease progression on a non- steroidal aromatase inhib ition as part of a 
randomized double -blind (entinostat vs. placebo) 600- patient phase III study 
(E2112, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). In particular, entinostat has shown promising activity in combination with high dose bolus IL -2 in renal cell carcinoma as well as with 
pembrolizumab in patients with PD -1 inhibitor refractory non -uveal melanoma. 
Entinostat is currently being evaluated in combination with avelumab (epithelial 
ovarian cancer , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), pembrolizumab (MDS, after DNMTi therapy 
failure, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; NSCLC an d mismatch repair -proficient colorectal cancer, 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; uveal melanoma, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; relapsed/refractory lymphomas, 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), atezolizumab (triple negative breast cancer, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), 
atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (renal cell carcinoma, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), and with 
nivolumab- ipilimumab (HER2 -negative breast cancer, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).

1.5 Pembrolizumab (MK -3475) 
Pembrolizumab  (MK -3475, KeytrudaTM) is a potent and highly selective 
intravenous humanized mAb of the immunoglobulin (Ig) G4/kappa isotype that 
directly blocks the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2. 
This blockade enhances func tional activity of the target lymphocytes to facilitate 
an antitumor immune response, leading to tumor regression and immune rejection of the tumor. Pembrolizumab was  approved by the U.S FDA as a front line therapy 
in metastatic melanoma, metastatic non -small cell lung (NSCLC) cancers, recurrent 
or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, recurrent locally

. 
 The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformation has been known for decades 
105.  Accumulating evidence 
shows a correlation between TILs  in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies 106-110.  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T-cells and t he 
ratio of CD8+ effector T -cells / Fo xP3+ Treg cells correlate s with improved 
prognosis and long- term survival in several  solid tumors.  
 The PD -1/PD -L1 pathway is a major co -inhibitory immune checkpoint pathway 
that suppress es effector T cell immune  respo nse in various cancers.  PD -1 is one of 
the several co -inhibitory immune checkpoint proteins that is normally upregulated  
on the cell surface of activated T -cells under physiologic conditions to 
downregulate unwanted or excessive immune responses  against exogenous stimuli 
(viruses, bacteria, cancer) , includi ng autoimmune reactions.  PD -1 is encoded by 
the ge ne (PDCD1 ) and is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -4. 
The structure of its murine counterpart reveals that it is a ty pe I transmembrane 
glycoprotein that contains an Ig variable -type (V -type) domain responsible for 
ligand binding and a cytoplasmi c tail that is responsible for binding of signaling 
molecules.  The cyt oplasmic tail of PD -1 contains two tyrosine -based signaling 
motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif (ITSM). Following T -cell 
stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases SHP -1 and SHP -2 to the ITSM 
motif within its cytoplasmic tail, l eading to the dephosphorylation of effector 
molecules, such as CD3ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70, all of which are involved in the T -cell 
signaling cascade 
111-114.  The mechanism by which PD -1 down modulates T -cell 
responses is similar to, but distinct from that of CTLA -4, as both molecules regulate 
an overlapping set of signaling proteins [13; 14].  PD -1 is ex pressed on activated 
lymphocytes, including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, B -cells, Treg and 
natural killer cells 115,116. 
 The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are constitutively expressed or can be 
induced in a variety of cell types, including non- hematopoieti c tissues as well as in 
various tumors 
117-120.  Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing 
both IgV - and Ig (constant) C- like domains in the extracellular region  and short 
cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD -1 ligand

17 to PD -1 inhibits T -cell activation triggered through the T -cell receptor.  PD -L1 is 
expressed at low levels across various non- hematopoietic tissues, most notably on 
vascular endothelium, whereas P D-L2 protein is only detectable on antigen -
presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  
PD-L2 is thought to control immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas 
PD-L1 dampens unwarranted T -cell function in peripheral tissues 121.  Although 
healthy organs express little, if any, PD-L1, several  cancers, including melanoma  
can ove rexpress PD -L1 by means of amplification of the gene locus that contains 
the PD -L1 gene 122. It is important to emphasize that this mechanism of 
upregulation is independent from the reactive expression of PD -L1 in response to 
host immune response, which may have importa nt therapeutic implications 123.  
1.5.1 Pre-clinical Studies of Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab (MK -3475) strongly enhances T-ly mphoc yte immune  responses  
in cultured blood cells from healt hy human  donors, cancer  patients,  and 
primates. In in vitro  assays using T -cells isolated from human donor blood cells , 
pembrolizumab induces production of interleukin -2 (IL- 2), tumor necrosis  factor  
alpha (TNFα),  interferon  gamma  (IFNγ), and activates T cells in subnanomolar 
EC 50 concentrations (i.e. concentrations wher e 50%  of the maximum effect is 
achieved; ~0.1 - 0.3 nM) .  It is important to emphasize that pembrolizumab 
potentiates existing immune responses on ly in the presence of antigen and 
specifical ly activate T- cells 124. 
 
Using a murine antibody against  PD-1 (mDX400), PD- 1 blockade has been shown 
to significantly inhibit  tumor growt h in a varie ty of syngeneic murine  tumor  
models. I n these  mouse  experiment s, mDX400 treatment is sy nergistic  with 
chemotherapeutic  agents, such  as gemcitabine  and 5- fluorouracil (5- FU), and 
combination therapy r esults  in increased complete tumor regression rates in vivo  
124. 
 The safety of pembrolizumab  was characterized  in the one-month, repea ted-dose 
toxicity study in cynomolgus monke ys when  administered  as intravenous (I V) 
doses of 6, 40 or 200 mg/kg once a week (a total of five doses)  and in the 6-month 
repeat -dose toxicity s tudy in the same species when administered  as IV doses of 
6, 40 or 200 mg/k g every other week (a total of 12 doses) .  Pembrolizumab was 
well tolerated  with a systemic  exposure [area under the curve (AUC)]  of up to 
~170,000 μg/da y/mL over the course of the one-month study, and with an AUC of  
up to approximatel y 67,500 μg/da y/mL over the course of the 6 -month study. No 
findings of toxicological significance  were  observed in either study and the No 
Observed Adverse Event Level (NOAEL)  was ≥200 mg/kg.   In addition, no 
findings of toxicological  relevance were observed in the in vitro  tissue  cross-
reactivity s tudy using human  and cynomolgus monkey tissues 
124. 
1.5.2 Summary from Relevant Clinical Studies of Pembrolizumab  in Melanoma  
In the largest ever conducted disease-spe cific phase I study of an experimental drug 
(n=655, KEYNOTE -001) pembrolizumab was administered in various schedules

18 in patients with advanced metastatic melanoma 35,125. This phase I study was 
essentially comprised of 4 different cohorts. The first (n=135) was a study in which 
patients were treated with 3 different dose schedules; 2mg/kg q3wks, 10mg/kg q3wks, and 10mg/kg q2wks, irrespective of prior treatment with ipilimumab. The second (n=173) was a randomized study of patients who have previously received and have become resistant to ipilimumab ( ipilimumab  -treated; IPI-T), define d as 
administration of at least 2 ipilimumab doses and equivocal progressive disease within 6 months of first ipilimumab dose; patients were randomized to 2mg/kg q3wks versus 10mg/kg q3wks. The third (n=103) was a randomized study of patients who have neve r received ipilimumab treatment (IPI naïve; IPI- N).  The 
fourth (n=244) was a randomized study of patients who have been IPI -N and IPI -T 
to either 10mg/kg q3wks vs. 10mg/kg q2wks. At a cutoff date of April 18, 2015, the median duration of follow -up was 15 months (range 8- 29) and 244 patients 
(37%) were still receiving pembrolizumab. IPI- T (n=342) as opposed to IPI -N 
(n=313) patients had received a smaller number of pembrolizumab infusions (8 versus 11 doses). No treatment -related deaths were observed in thi s trial and no 
differences in grade 3 -4 treatment -related events were observed between IPI -T 
versus IPI -N. The most frequent immune -mediated adverse events were 
hypothyroidism (any grade, 7.5%; grade 3 -4, 0.2%), hyperthyroidism (2.3%, 
0.3%), pneumonitis (2.7%, 0.3%), colitis (1.7%, 1.1%), hepatitis (0.6%, 0.3%), nephritis (0.5%, 0.3%), and uveitis (0.9%, 0%). As of October 18, 2014, and with 
a median follow -up of 21 months, 581 patients had measurable disease per central 
RECIST v 1.1 at baseline. In this combined cohort of IPI -T and IPI -N overall 
response rates (ORR) were assessed at 33% whereas complete response (CR)  was 
8%. Subgroup analys es revealed that M1b disease, tumor burden less than the 
median seen in this study, no prior treatment with ipilimumab , and normal serum 
LDH were asso ciated with  RR greater  than 33% whereas prior treatment with 
BRAF inhibitors, tumor burden higher than the median seen in this study, M1c disease, and elevated serum LDH were associated with a significantly lower 
incidence of  ORR. In this subgroup analysis , there were no significant differences 
in ORR between the 2mg/kg q3wk (n=143), 10mg/kg q3wk (n=272), and 10mg/kg 
q2wks (n=166).  The me dian PFS was 4.4 months (PFS rate at 12 months  was 0.35), 
where as the median OS  was 22.8 months (OS rate at 12 and 24 months  was 0.66 
and 0.49, respectively )
126. 
 When pembrolizum ab was administered as first -line therapy in patients with 
advanced cutaneous melanoma, CR and ORR were  13.5% and 45.1%, respectively, 
whereas the corresponding median PFS  was 13.8 months  and OS was 31.1 months , 
respectively . In this study tumor blocks fro m 67% of the first 411 patients who were 
enrolled into this study were evaluable for immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of PD -L1 in the tumor. Allred proportion scores (APS) were randomly set for 
expression of PD -L1; APS=0, corresponds to 0% staining, APS=2 corresponds to 
1-10% staining, APS=3 corresponds to 10 -33% staining, APS=4 corresponds to 
34%- 66% staining, and APS=5 corresponds to 66- 100% staining. Patients with 
APS=0 or 1 (n=28, n=24, respectively) had ORR <10% each, patients with APS=2 (n=72) had ORR ~ 20%, patients with APS=3 (n=54) had ORR 40%, patients with

19 APS=4 (n=32) had ORR ~70%, and patients with APS=5 (n=32) had ORR ~ 50% 
35. Pembrolizumab monotherapy ha d lower clinical benefit when administered in 
patients with metastatic ocular or metastatic mucosal melanoma23,24. The lower 
responses in these two no n-cutaneous melanoma subtypes was attrib uted to the 
lower frequency of ‘inflamed’ types. Pembro lizumab was safe and showing 
promising antitumor activity in 18 patients with asymptomatic , up to 20- mm active 
melanoma brain metastases (22% incidence of intracranial antitumor response)127.  
 
KEYNOTE -006 was a randomized study in which patients with advanced 
melanoma and no prior treatment with CTLA -4, PD -1, and PD -L1 inhibitors were 
randomized to pembrolizumab 10mg/kg administered every 2 wks (n=279) or every 
3 wks (n=277) versus standard of care ipilimumab (3mg/kg, n=278). In the intention -to-treat population the estimated 6 -month PFS rate for patients receiving 
pembrolizumab every 2 or 3 weeks w as 47.3% and 46.4%, respectively, whereas 
the corresponding 6- month PFS rate for ipilimumab -treated patients was 26.5%. 
Median estimates of PFS were 5.5 months, 4.1 months, and 2.8 months, respectively. At the time of data cut -off for the second interim analysis, which was 
driven by a minimum follow -up duration of 12 months for all patients, one -year 
estimates for OS  were 74.1%, 68.4%, and 58.2%, respectively. At a longer follow -
up (median 22.9 months) median OS  was not reached for any of the pembrolizumab 
arms but was 16 months for the ipilimumab arm
128. The results from this study 
suggest that pembrolizumab administered at 10mg/kg irrespective of the schedules 
tested was superior to ipilimumab in the front- line setting (i.e. no prior treatment 
with co -inhibitory immune checkpoint inhibitors) 35. 
 
KEYNOTE -002 is a randomized study in which patients with advanced melanoma 
who have previously received and have become resistant to ipilimumab and MAPK pathway inhibitors (if BRAFV600 -mutant) were randomized to receive 
pembrolizumab , 2mg/kg every 3wks (n=180), pembrolizumab, 10mg/kg every 3 
wks (n=181), and investigator’s choice chemotherapy (n=171; paclitaxel plus carboplatin, paclitaxel, carboplatin, dacarbazine, or oral temozolomide). At a median follow -up duration of 10 months pembrolizumab administered at either 
2mg/kg or 10mg/kg showed significant improvem ent in PFS compared to 
investigator’s choice chemotherapy (hazard ratio or 0.57 and 0.50, respectively). RR in patients who received pembrolizumab at 2mg/kg, 10mg/kg versus 
investigator’s choice chemotherapy were 21%, 25%, and 4%, respectively, whereas the median PFS was 5.4 months, 5.8 months, and 3.6 months, respectively. 
Incidence of grade 3 -4 treatment -related AEs was higher in those given 
chemotherapy (26%) than in those given pembrolizumab at 2mg/kg (11%) and pembrolizumab at 10mg/kg (14%). The most common grade 3- 4 treatment- related 
AEs in the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg group were fatigue, generalized edema, and 
myal gia whereas in the pembrolizumab 10mg/kg group common grade 3 -4 events 
were hypopituitarism, colitis, diarrhea, decreased appetite, hyponatremia, and pneumonitis. In the pre -specified subgroup analysis of PFS the only subgroup that 
did not appear to signif icantly benefit from pembro lizumab 2mg/kg was the 
BRAFV600 -mutant group 
37.

In summary, pembrolizumab administered at 10mg/kg provides better clinical benefit than the standard of care ipilimumab in the front -line setting (i.e., no prior 
co-inhibitory immune checkpoint inhibitors). Although the FDA -approved 2mg/kg 
every 3 weeks dose was never directly compared head -to-head against ipilimumab, 
data from KEYNOTE -001 and KEYNOTE -002 show that there is no significant 
difference between pembrolizumab administered at 2mg/kg and 10mg/kg  every 3 
wks. Currently, pembrolizumab is administered at 200mg IV, flat/fixed dose every 
3 weeks.  
 
1.6 Rationale for Clinical Study  
No immunotherapies in metastatic cutaneous melanoma have achieved an 
antitumor response rate more than 6 0%. Furthe rmore, combined ipilimumab and 
nivolumab has not resulted in longer OS compared with single -agent nivolumab in 
a randomized phase III study
42. The ‘up to 60% ceiling effect’ of combined PD -
1/CTLA -4 blockade can be  explained by the f act that pre -existing TIL and 
immunogenicity are required for most of these immunotherapies to have an effect , 
which was set to approximately 50% in the case of cutaneous melanomas13. The 
requirement for underlying immune response for clinical benefit from 
immunotherapies can be better recognized indirectly among other non-cutaneous 
melanoma subtypes, in which the incidence of unde rlying immune response  is 
much lower compared to that seen  in cutaneous melanoma. Unless we attempt to 
develop strategies to augment immunogenicity of non-‘ inflamed’ melanomas , the 
clinical benefit from any immunotherapy regimen will predominantly remain 
limited  to inflamed melanoma s only. Although immunogenicity is to some  exten t 
defined by the number of high- avidity neoantigens, it is also regulated at the 
transcriptional level.  
Epigenetic modifiers t hat affect gene expression via changes in promoter 
methylation or chromatin (e.g. histone) structure have  shown to augment 
immunogenicity of cancer cells129. HDAC i are expected to augment 
immunogenicity of melanoma cells in a subgroup that is likely not to be define d by 
somatic mutations  in most genes  (overall burden and type) but rather by melanoma 
biology that is defined by distinct changes in DNA promoter methylation  and 
regulatory  elements that are regulated by histone marks ( acetylation and/or 
methylation ); these changes will  ultimately be reflected by the RNA/miRNA 
expression profiling 58. We predict that a subset of non- inflamed melanomas treated 
with entinostat will ultima tely become immunogenic and that this conversion can 
be predicted by a combined biomarker that involves : (a) a handful of somatic 
mutations in epigenetic modifi ers and epigenetic mediators (e.g. OCT4, NANOG, 
LIN28, SOX2, KLF4) , which have been previously identified in cutaneous 
melanomas130, (b) DNA pr omoter methylation profiling, and (c) changes in 
chromatin accessibility  of distinct regulatory  DNA elements.  
Clinical trials in metastatic melanoma using single -agent HDACi have  not shown 
any major antitumor responses  86,131. In addition, two trials using HDACi in 
LCCC 1729  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Stergios Moschos, M.D.  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Amendment 2    December 15, 2021  
 
21 combination with PD -1 inhibitors were recently reported104,132. While the 
entinostat-b ased treatment combination with  pembrolizumab showed activity in a 
portion of patients with PD -1 inhibitor resista nce, the panobinostat trial did not 
show any clinical benefit in patients with PD -1 inhibitor -naïve melanoma. We 
interpret the se results as follows:  
a. Potency and selectivity of the HDACi matter s. Entinostat  (a class I  HDACi ) is 
more selective than panobinostat (pan-HDACi ) yet more potent for class I HDAC s 
133.  
b. The type of i mmune checkpoint inhibitor that the HDACi is concurrently 
administered with may matter. In the panobinostat trial, ipilimumab was used.  
c. Given that  entinostat/ pembrolizumab -treated  patients with PD -1 inhibitor 
refractory melanoma did respond, id entification of pretreatment and on- treatment 
changes in response to entinostat at the tumor tissue  level  should be pursued in 
parallel with investigations that explore  entinostat effects on various peripheral 
blood immune cell (PBMC) subset s. Given the complex changes that HDACi 
induce, a comprehensive –omics strategy focusing on epigenetic changes (DNA 
methylation profiling, profiling of regulatory DNA elements that are free from 
nucleosomes , RNA- seq) at baseline and on -treatment may be important for 
identifying a biomarker.  
 
Dose Rationale : We will use the standard of care FDA -approved dose of 
pembrolizumab (2 00 mg, once  every 3 weeks) along with the entinostat 
administered at 5  mg once weekly ( qwk). This dose of entinostat was safe and well 
tolerated in combination with pembrolizumab in an ongoing phase 1b/2 study104. 
104.  
1.7 Correlative Studies  
The study contains a single integral tumor tissue biomarker and several  exploratory 
tumor tissue a nd peripheral correlative biomarkers.  
1.7.1 Integral  Biomarker. Assessment of TIL/TAL in representative H&E -stained 
sections from archived tumor tissues to determine eligibility for the trial 
during screenin g.  
Since the primary endpoint of the study is to assess the incidence of conversion of non-inflamed vs. inflamed melanoma following 3  weeks of entinostat 
monotherapy, we will use a cost -efficient assay to determine eligib ility, namely 
assessment of TIL/TALs in archived metastatic melanoma specimens. Since the 
presence of TIL /TALs  can be heterogeneous within the same tissue as well as 
across different metastatic sites , the following are requirements for archived tumor 
tissue eligibility:  
• The amount of surface area corresponding to melanoma devoid of stroma 
should be at least 1cm
2. This ensures sufficient tumor to be screened for 
presence of TIL /TAL s, yet it is NOT too restrictive for patients who do not 
have “sufficiently large” archived tumor specimen for analysis.  
LCCC 1729  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Stergios Moschos, M.D.  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Amendment 2    December 15, 2021  
 
22 • No more than 20% of necrosis is allowed; this ensures that high quality 
specimens are available for analysis. 
• At least 60% of viable melanoma cells are present; this ensures that the 
melanoma cell compartment is sufficiently larger than the stromal component. 
• Must have available archival tissue and subjects must have consented to 
allow collection of archived tumor blocks from previous surgeries confirming or treating unresectable stage III or distant metastatic disease. If more than one archived tumor block is available, only one block is required 
to be analyzed for the presence of TIL/TALS. Archived tumor tissues must 
fulfill the following criteria based on representative H&E -stained tissue 
sections: (1) the tumor surface area must be ≥ 1cm
2 (which can be the sum 
tumor surface from more than metastatic blocks , if necessary), (2)  ≤20% of 
necrosis, (3) the ratio of viable tumor cells to tumor- associated stroma 
should be ≥60/40, and (4) i f TILs are present based on H&E stained 
sections, they must be ≤1% of the total number of cells in the specimen . 
• If more than one arc hived metastatic melanoma specimen is  available  
during the 21- day screening period, only one block is required to be 
analyzed for the presence of TIL/TALs. 
1.7.2 Exploratory Biomarkers- Tumor Tissue  
 
1.7.2.1 RNA- seq (both baseline and in the end of cycle 1, beginning of cycle 2 
(day 22±2 days), immediately before concurrent entinostat- pembrolizumab 
treatment day 22 ± 2 days).  
RNA will be extracted from FFPE tissue sections from both archived in the end 
of cycle 1, beginning of cycle 2 (day 22±2 days), immediately before treatment  
for sequencing analysis. RNA -seq on paired baseline and on day 22± 2 treatment 
tissues will assist in: (a) identifying transcription signatures  that are associated 
with non- inflamed melanomas, such as IPRES and immune low signatures 
(baseline), type I  interferon response, IPRES and epigenetic signatures  (day 2 2 
versus baseline)  2,3,13. Secondly, (b) perform  a s omatic mutation calling 
(expressed mutations)  analysis , in particular for genes encoding for epigenetic 
modifiers (e.g. SMARCA4 , PBRM1 , ARID1A, ARID2 , ARID1B, DNMT3A , 
TET2 , MLL1/2/3 , NSD1/2 , EZH2 , SETD2 , BRD4 ) and epigenetic regulators 
(e.g. OCT4 , NANOG, LIN28 , SOX2 , KLF4 ). We predict that inactivating 
mutations in any of these genes may have impact in chromatin accessibility, as has been previously published in renal cell carcinoma from UNC -CH 
investigators 
134, and therefore the se tumors  may differentially respond to 
HDAC inhibition . RNA- seq is also ideal for detection of aberrant splicing and 
expressed immunogenic neoepitopes  135 (Dr. Benjamin Vincent UNC -CH, 
unpublished data ). This process can therefore help us study immunogenicity of 
tumors that may have a low somatic tumor burden. It is therefore quite possible 
that HDAC inhibition may change RNA expression of genes that may have low or absent expression at baseline due to widespread RNA processing defects, but 
LCCC 1729  CONFIDENTIAL

Amendment 2    December 15, 2021  
 
23 upon treatment with a HDACi , RNA expression of these genes may be  
significantly upregulated leading  to increased  expression of neoepitopes . 
Thirdly, (c) analyze the immune receptor repertoire  (richness, observed V -J 
rearrangements; clonality, evenness of the repertoire based on frequencies of 
specific V -J rearrangements) within tumors. The T- cell receptor ( TCR) 
repertoire in peripheral blood ha s been previously assoc iated with response to 
immune checkpoint  inhibitors 136-139. We postulate that TCR and B- cell receptor 
(BCR) repertoire analysis within tumor tissue will yield more specific 
TCR/BCR clones that are associated with immune response in the end of cycle 
1, beginning of cycle 2 (day 22± 2 days), immediately before treatment samples 
from the prospective  responders, compared to the prospective  non-responders. 
 
 1.7.2.2 Formal dehyde -assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE ; 
baseline and on day 22).  
In tumors, organization of the chromatin landscape offers a comprehensive 
overview of the rewiring of transcriptional networks that accompany processes 
such as cellular differentiation, tumor growth, metastasis, and therapeutic 
resistance, w hich can be more reliable in predicting cell behavior than gene 
expression profiles alone140,141.  Further, it has been shown that chromatin 
accessibility changes can be detected in cancer cells following treatment with small 
molecule inhibitors142-144.  Therefore , tumor -specific chromatin signatures may 
offer remarkable diagnostic and biomarker potential.  We will use a protocol 
developed by the Pattenden, Dayton, and Davis labs at UNC- CH to extract 
DNA accessible chromatin from formalin -fixed , paraffin -embedded (FFPE) 
tissue.  These DNA regions harbor regulatory elements (active transcriptional 
start sites, transcriptional enhancers, insulators, silencers, and locus control regions). Chromatin signature s will be determined by performing FAIRE , a 
biochemical technique that purifies accessible chromatin from formalin -fixed 
samples, followed by high-throughput sequencing.  1.7.2.3 Tissue- imaging studies  
1.7.2.3.1 E xpression of PD -L1 (melanoma cells and immune cells), MHC 
class I (melanoma cells) and CD8+ cells at baseline and on day 22, using 
multicolor immunofluorescence  (IF). If our integrated biomarker of 
assessing  TIL/TAL is correct, we do not anticipate detect ing any CD8+ cells 
at baseline; in fact, a proportion of these non- inflamed m elanoma s may have 
no expression of MHC class I. However, in the end of cycle 1, beginning of 
cycle 2 (day 22± 2 days), immediately before concurrent pembrolizumab-
entinostat treatment,  we anticipate that HDAC inhibition in those 
melanomas that have TIL /TAL  present , based on the H&E analysis (integral 
biomarker), to also contain  CD8+ cells. In addition, we anticipate that 
melanoma cells in patients who respond to concurrent entinostat -
pembrolizumab will express both  MHC class I+ and PD -L1, which have 
been previously shown to be upregulated in response to HDACi.

24 1.7.2.3.2 Expression of global histone modification markers: acetylated 
histone 3 lysine 18 (H3K18Ac), acetylated histone 4 lysine 12 (H4K12Ac), 
dimethylated histone 4 arginine 3 (H4R3diMe), dimethyla ted histone 3 
lysine 4 (H3 K4diMe), (H3K27triMe) in tumor specimens by single -color 
immunohistochemistry (IHC)  will be important due to previous reports 
about association between global histone modification levels and 
prognosis145,146. Both archived/baseline and day 22 samples will be stained 
to assess both prediction of response to entinostat as well as entinostat -
associated changes in global histone modifications. We anticipate that at 
least the global histone acetylation markers H3K18Ac and H4K12Ac to be high at baseline in a subset of patients whose me lanomas convert from ‘non-
inflamed ’ to ‘inflamed ’ and that 21± 2 days of entinostat priming will 
significantly suppres s H3K18Ac and H4K12Ac. Lack of suppression of the 
histone acetylation markers may suggest inadequate target inhibition by entinostat.  
 
1.7.2.3.3 Expression of entinostat  targets HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3  in 
archived -baseline tumor tissues only by single -color IH C will be examined 
due to reports about heterogeneous expression of HDAC1, HDAC2, and 
HDAC3  in melanoma  66. We would like to investigate whether expression 
of any of these targets , HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3,  is associated with 
treatment response to the entinostat- pembrolizumab combination.  
 
1.7.2.4 Exploratory Biomarkers -Peripheral blood mononuclear cells  
(PBMC; baseline,  in the end of cycle 1, beginning of cycle 2 (day 22 ±2 days), 
immediatel y before concurrent entinostat -pembrolizumab; week  10; and 
end of treatment) : 
a. It is quite possible that entinostat will have an indirect immunomodulatory effect on immune cell subsets , much like the 
suppression of peripheral blood MDSC in breast cancer patients
84. We 
plan to perform multi -parameter flow cytometry  on PBMCs to identify  
various immunoregulatory cell subsets (e.g. monocytic and granulocytic MDSCs, T reg  cells).  
b. Assess Histone H3 and H4 acetylation  in PBMCs  by peripheral blood 
multi- parameter flow cytometry  
147,148. In the ENCORE 301 tria l 
patients bearing peripheral immune cell subsets (T cells, B cells, monocytes) that were found to be hyperacetylated and were treated with entinostat and exemestane lived longer compared to non- acetylators. It 
would be interesting to see if TIL/TAL -absent  melanomas that convert  
from absent TIL/TALs before entinostat treatment to TIL/TAL -present 
tumors following  21 days of  entinostat monotherapy exhibit (a) higher 
levels of H3 and H4 acetylation in peripheral blood compared to non -
converters at baseline b) undergo the greatest changes in acetylation between baseline and day 22, immediately prior to pembrolizumab treatment.

33 of TIL/TAL in representative H&E -stained tumor tissues. Subjects are eligible even 
if they have received any prior PD -1/PD -L1 pathway inhibitors or any other 
systemic treatments, including im munotherapies, on condition that they have not 
received HDACi for their melanoma. They must have recovered from any side 
effects associated with prior anticancer treatment s. Patients will be ‘primed’ with 
entinostat, 5mg PO qwk, for 3 weeks. In the end of cycle 1, beginning of cycle 2 
(day 22± 2 days), immediately before concurrent entinostat -pembrolizumab 
treatment, they will undergo a mandatory melanoma biopsy after which they will 
receive up to 4 infusions of standard of care pembrolizumab along with weekly 
administration of entinostat. Restaging radiographic studies will be performed on week 10and then every 6 weeks until week 27.  Peripheral blood will be collected 
at baseline; in the end of cycle 1, beginning of cycle 2 (day 22 ±2 days), immediately 
before concurrent entinostat -pembrolizumab treatment ; on week 10 after 3 
infusions (cycles)  of pembrolizumab; and at the end of treatment, either at disease 
progression or week 27, or if intolerable toxicity occurs that requires permanent discontinuation of pembrolizumab and/or entinostat. Subjects will be considered to have completed all trial requirements if:  
(a) Their  disease has progressed by RECIST v1.1 criteria within less than 10 
weeks from the first dose of entinostat, 
(b) They  develop toxicity re lated to pembrolizumab or entinostat, but still 
complete sample collection (peripheral blood and tumor tissue) and tumor 
assessments by at least week 3,  
(c) Complete  the entire 27 weeks of combination therapy and study- related 
assessments without experiencing disease progression  by RECIST v1.1 criteria 
or clinical grounds . Those subjects experiencing clinical benefit after 27 weeks 
may continue pembrolizumab therapy  per standard of care . 
5.2 Treatment Dosage and Administration  
Subjects in this trial will be administered entinostat, 5mg PO, once weekly (D1, D8, D15 of a 21- day cycle)  starting on day 1 of study treatment. Pembrolizumab, 
200 mg will be administered intravenou sly (IV) every 3 weeks and initiated at cycle 
2 after the mandatory research tumor biopsy in the end of cycle 1, beginning of 
cycle 2 (day 22± 2 days). Combination therapy with both agents will continue  if 
subject is receiving clinical benefit from therapy for up to 27 weeks ( 8 cycles of 
combination therapy or approximately 6 months).  Study therapy will be discontinued for intolerable toxicity, disease progression or for other reasons at the discretion of the investigator.

5.3 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications 
Any subject  who receives at least one dose of entinostat on this protocol will be 
evaluable for toxicity.  Each patient will be assessed periodically for development 
of any toxicity according to the Time and Events table in section  7.1.  Toxicity will 
be assessed according to the NCI -CTCAE v 5.0. No dosing adjustments will be 
made for pembrolizumab , but delays in dosing or discontinuation of 
pembrolizumab and entinostat may be required. D epending on the side effects  
related to pembrolizumab  administration , there would be either treatment delays  
(i.e., delays up to 3 days of scheduled dose  if AE(s) oc cur prior to cycle 3 or 4, up 
to 7 days of scheduled dose allowed if AE(s) occurs  prior to cycles 5 and 6; delays 
up to 15 days of scheduled dose allowed  for pembrolizumab infusions if AE(s) 
occurs for cycle 7, 8 or 9 of combination treatment) .  If pembrol izumab  delays go 
beyond what is allowed, subject will skip the particular dose and a note will be 
made regarding the reason. If pembro lizumab  is permanently discontinued, then 
entinostat must also be discontinued . Entinostat dosing guidelines and delays ar e 
provided in the section  below .  
5.3.1 Entinostat Dosing  Modification  Guidelines  
All dose modifications should be based on the AE s requiring the greatest 
modification and also meet criteria for dose adjustment. AEs should be properly 
documented in source documents. Investigators may take a more conservative 
approach than the guidelines outlined below based on clinical judgment that is in 
the best interest of the subject. 
Management of toxicities that are at least possibly related to entinostat, with 
toxicities graded by the Investigator according to the NCI, CTCAE, version 5.0 should be managed as follows:  
Non-hematologic  Toxicity  
Toxicity  Dose Modifications  for Entinostat  
Grade 4  Administer  symptomatic  remedies/ start prophylaxis.  
Hold dose until recovery to  Grade  1 or baseline under the following  directions:

resume study drug as follows:  
• If receiving 5 mg, restart study drug at 3 mg, 
• If receiving 3 mg, restart study drug at 2 mg, 
• If receiving 2 mg, discontinue study treatment . 
2. If not recovered within  4 weeks,  permanently discontinue study drug.

Dosing of study drug may  be interrupted at the Investigator’s discretion.  
•     If dose is held for 4 consecutive weeks,  permanently discontinue  
study drug1. 
•     If toxicity  resolves, resume  entinostat at the original dose.  
If greater than  50% of  doses are missed during any 6- week  period, discontinue from study 
drug treatment.  Entinostat must also be discontinued in case of permanent discontinuation 
of pembrolizumab.

5.3.2 Dose Modification and toxicity management for immune -related AEs 
associated with pembrolizumab and combination therapy   
AE (both non- serious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab exposure , 
including coadministration with additional compounds, may represent an 
immunologic etiology . These immune -related AEs (irAEs)  may occur shortly after 
the first dose or several months after the last dose of pembrolizumab /combination 
treatment and may affec t more than one body system simultaneously. Therefore, 
early recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to reduce complications.  Based on existing clinical study data, most irAEs were reversible and could be managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab/combination treatment, administration of corticosteroids and/or other supportive care. For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Additional procedures or tests such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, skin biopsy may be included as part of the evaluation. Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for irAEs associated with pembrolizumab/combination treatment are provided in the table below . Pembrolizumab must be withheld for drug -related toxicities and 
severe or life- threatening AEs as per the table provided  below. See Section 5.6
 for 
supportive care guidelines, including use of corticosteroid s and additional guidance 
on management of  immune- mediated events (i .e., pneumonitis , diarrhea/colitis, 
Type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypophysitis, hyper/hypothyroidism, hepatotoxicity, 
renal insufficiency/nephritis, Steven’s-Johnson Syndrome, and myocarditis).  
 Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical/surgical events or logistical reasons not related to study therapy  (e.g., elective surgery, radiation 
therapy, unrelated medical events, patient vacation, and/or holidays). Subjects 
should be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks  (i.e., 21 days)  of the 
scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the Sponsor. The reason for interruption should be documented in the patient's study record.  If 
pembro lizumab  is permanently discontinued, entinostat must be discontinued as 
well.  
 Attribution of Toxicity:  When study interventions are administered in combination, attribution of an adverse event to a single component is likely to be difficult.  Therefore, while the investigator may attribute a toxicity event to the combination,  to entinostat alone 
or to pembrolizumab alone], for adverse events listed in the table below , both 
interventions must be held according to the criteria in the table below:  Dose 
Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune -Related Adverse 
Events Associated with Pembrolizumab  and IO Combinations .

38 When study interventions are administered in combination, if the AE is considered 
immune -related, both interventions should be held according to recommended dose 
modifications.  
 Restarting Study Interventions:  
 Participants may not have any dose modifications (no change in dose or schedule) of pembrolizumab in this study, as described in the table below . 
• If the toxicity does not resolve or the criteria for resuming treatment are not met, the parti cipant must be discontinued from all study interventions. 
• If the toxicities do resolve and conditions are aligned with what is defined in the table below , the combination of entinostat and pembrolizumab may 
be restarted at the discretion of the investigato r. In these cases where the 
toxicity is attributed to the combination or to  entinostat alone  , re-initiation 
of pembrolizumab as a monotherapy may be considered at the principal investigator’s discretion .

45 5.3.3 Combined Entinostat and Pembrolizumab Dosing Guidelines  
In the  ongoing study of concurrent pembrolizumab  – entinostat administration  in 
patients with solid tumors , no overlapping toxicities have been identified between 
these two drugs except for  the following: fatigue , arthralgia, AST/ALT elevation, 
rash,  and diarrhea. Overall, the  treatment  regimen has been  tolerated well  104.  
 
• If any AEs with  grade ≥3 are eq ually attributed to both pembrolizumab and 
entinostat, reduce entinostat and pembrolizumab as per dosing guidelines in 
section s 5.3.1 and 5.3.2.  
 
• As with  any new treatment, we will also monitor for any AE s that have not  
been observed with this combination  (unexpected SARs will be reported 
per guidelines) under study. 
 
• If pembro lizumab  is permanently discontinued, then entinostat must also be 
discontinued. 
 
5.4 Concomitant Medications/Treatments/Supportive Care Allowed  
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a subject’s we lfare may 
be administered at his/her  discretion , in keeping with the community standards of 
medical care.  All concomitant medication s will be recorded on the case report form 
(CRF) including all prescription s, over -the- counter (OTC),  non-exclusionary 
herbal supplements, IV medications and IV fluids. If changes occur during the trial 
period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date may also be 
included on the CRF. 
 
All concomitant medications received within 28 days before the first dose of trial treatment and 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment should be recorded.   
5.5 Prohibited Medications/Treatments  
Subjects with pre -existing hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or other PD -1/PD -
L1 pathway inhibitors are disqualified  from participation in the trial.  
 Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapies during the Screening and Treatment Phase (including  retreatment for post- complete response relapse) of 
this trial:  
• Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy  
• Targeted therapy (e.g. MAPK inhibitors), or biological therapy  
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol 
• Radiation therapy  to multiple lesions  or major surgery  
Note : Radiation therapy or minor surgery to a single pre-existing but currently 
growing symptomatic extracranial  lesion may be considered on an exceptional 
case-by- case basis after consultation with SYNDAX. The patient must have

46 measurable disease outside the radiated  or operated field. Administration of 
palliative radiation therapy to a new lesion will be considere d clinical 
progression. 
• Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and 
while participating in the trial.   Examples of live vaccines include, but are 
not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine. 
• Systemic glucocorticoids with the exceptions specified in section 4.2.1, 
• Any other HDACi, including val proic acid , 
• DNA methyltransferase inhibitors , 
• Any additional anticancer agents, such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, biological response modifiers will not be allowed, even if utilized as treatment of non- cancer indications, 
• Any other inv estigational agents.  
• Traditional herbal medicines; these therapies are not fully studied and their use may result in unanticipated drug -drug interactions that may cause or 
confound the assessment of toxicities. 
• Sensitive substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP3A with a narrow therapeutic window  (see APPENDIX A  PROHIBITED MEDICATIONS
), 
• Drugs that are known to inhibit or induce P -gp (see APPENDIX A  
PROHIBITED MEDICATIONS ). 
 
There are no prohibited therapies during the Post -Treatment  and Follow- up Phase s. 
5.6 Rescue Medications and Supportive Care  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures, as deemed necessar y 
by the treating investigator.  Suggested supportive care measures f or the 
management of AEs  with potential immunologic etiology are outlined  below . 
Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or IV  treatment with 
corticosteroids as well as additional anti -inflammatory agents if symptoms do not 
improve with  admi nistration of corticosteroids.  Note that several courses of steroid 
tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes, such 
as metastatic disease, bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care. The treatment guidelines will be applied when the investigator 
determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
NOTE:  If after the evaluation the event is determined unrelated, the investigator 
does not need to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined below). Refer to Section 5.3.2 for dose modification guidelines.  
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures , such as bronchoscopy, 
endoscopy, or skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.

47 • Pneumonitis :  
Diagnosis of pneumonitis may require  consultation with pulmonology and should 
not be solely relying on radiographic imaging. If possible, bronchoscopy with 
bronchoalveolar lavage and/or lung biopsy should be performed. 
o For Grade 2 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 1 -
2mg/kg daily, or its equivalent). When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
o For Grade 3- 4 events, immediately treat with intravenous steroids.  
Administer additional anti- inflammatory measures, as needed. 
o Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged steroid administration. 
• Diarrhea/Colitis:  
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus). Given that entinostat may also present with diarrhea, consultation with gastroenterology for possible colonoscopy should be considered. An attribution to specific drug (entinostat or pembrolizumab) should be sought versus  a combination of 
interventions/maneuvers (e.g. entinostat hold and/or rechallenge). 
o All subjects who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.  For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, consider GI consultation and endoscopy to confirm or rule out colitis. 
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis attributed to pembrolizumab, administer oral corticosteroids (prednisone 1 -2mg/kg daily, or its equivalent).  
o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis attributed to pembrolizumab, treat with intravenous steroids followed by high dose oral steroids.   
o When symptoms attributed to pembrolizumab improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
o For diarrhea associated with entinostat, please consult section 5.3.1. 
• Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM, if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis) or ≥ Grade 3 hyperglycemia  in patients with pre -existing diabetes , if associated 
with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic acidosis  
o For T1DM or Grade 3- 4 hyperglycemia  
LCCC 1729  CONFIDENTIAL

48  Insulin replacement therapy is recomme nded for T1DM and for 
Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic acidosis or 
ketonuria.  
 Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine 
ketones, glycosylated hemoglobin, and C-peptide. 
• Hypophysitis:  
o For Grade 2 events, treat with corticosteroids (prednisone 1 -2mg/kg daily, 
or its equivalent). When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of 
appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered. 
o For Grade 3- 4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids 
followed by oral corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate ho rmones may be required as the steroid dose 
is being tapered. 
• Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism:  Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during trea tment, 
and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. 
o Grade 2 hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2-4 hypothyroidism): 
 In hyperthyroidism, non- selective β-blockers (e.g. propranolol) are 
suggested as initial therapy if subject has a resting heart rate >90 beats/min. If free T4 is 30% more than institutional ULN , patient is 
required to start on anti -thyroid medication (e.g. propylthiouracil, 
methimazole, tapazole).  
 In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with levothyroxine or liothyronine, is indicated per standard of care. 
o Grade 3 -4 hyperthyroidis m  
 Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by oral corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is being tapered.

49 • Hepatic:  
Given that both entinostat and pembrolizumab can induce transaminitis, a liver  
biopsy can be considered to exclude  autoimmune hepatitis , because management 
can be vastly different.  
o For Grade 1-2 events attributed to pembrolizumab, monitor liver function 
tests more frequently until returned to baseline values (consider weekly).  
 Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids  
o For Grade 3- 4 events attr ibuted to pembrolizumab, treat with IV 
corticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be 
started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
o If transaminitis is attributed to entinostat, please consult se ction 5.3.1. 
• Renal Failure or Nephritis:  
Although autoimmune interstitial nephritis can occur with pembrolizumab but not entinostat, electrolyte abnormalities due to electrolyte wasting can occur with entinostat. Please consider urinalysis (with urine culture if WBC s in urine are 
present) and urine electrolytes (Na, Cl, Mg, Phos, Ca
2+, CO 2) if unexplained low 
serum electrolytes are observed. Consult nephrology if  there is suspicion of 
autoimmune interstitial nephritis attributed to pembrolizumab.  
o For Grade 2 events attributed to pembrolizumab, treat with corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3- 4 events attributed to pembrolizumab, treat with systemic 
corticosteroids.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
• Steven -Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN):  
o For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold pembrolizumab and entinostat and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and 
treatment. 
o If SJS or TEN is confirmed,  permanently discontinue pembrolizumab and 
entinostat. 
• Cardiac Immune -mediated myocarditis:  
Although both entinostat and pembrolizumab can affect heart function, AEs can be different (e.g. entinostat can cause cardiac arrhythmias whereas pembrolizumab can cause myocarditis). Please consult cardiology if any suspicion for cardiac

● Vasectomized partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the sole 
male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional 
highly effective method of contraception should be u sed.  
● Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. The reliability of sexual abstinence nee

52 Notes:  
Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants 
of clinical studies . 
a) Typical use failure rates are lower than perfect- use failure rates (i.e. , when used consistently and 
correctly).  
b) If hormonal contraception efficacy is potentially decreased due to interaction with study treatment, 
condoms must be used in addition to the hormonal contraception during the tre atment period and for at 
least 120 days, (corresponding to time needed to eliminate study treatment plus 30 days for study 
treatm ents with genotoxic potential) after t he last dose of entinostat . 
c) If locally required, in accordance with Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidelines, acceptable 
hormonal contraceptives are limited to those which inhibit ovulation .  
 
5.6.3 Use in Pregnancy  
If a subject inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with 
pembrolizumab/entinostat, the subject will immediately be removed from the study.  The site will contact the subject at least monthly and document the subject’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated.  The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to SYNDAX without delay and within 24 hours  to the 
Sponsor and within 2 working days to SYNDAX, if the outcome is a serious 
adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn).  
  The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the 
outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the 
Sponsor. If a male subject impregnates his female partner , the study personnel at 
the site must be informed immediately and the pregnancy reported to  SYNDAX, as 
described above and in Section 8.4. 
5.6.4 Overdose of Pembrolizumab  
For purposes of this study , an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any 
dose of 1,000 mg or greater (≥5 times the indicated dose).  No specific information 
is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab . In the event of 
overdose, the participant should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  
Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided, if clinically indicated.  
 If an AE (s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of pembrolizumab , the 
AE(s) is reported as a SAE, even if no other seriousness criteria are met.   
 
5.6.5 Overdose of Entinostat  
There  is no information on overdose  of entinostat.  A ny SAE that occurs at any 
dose level of entinostat should be report ed to SYNDAX Pharmaceuticals. Refer to 
section 8.4 for additional details on AE reporting requirements.

53 5.7 Other Modalities or Procedures  
5.7.1 On-Entinostat Treatment Biopsy (Day 22 (± 2 days)) 
A mandatory on- entinostat treatment tumor biopsy will be performed in the end of 
cycle 1, beginning of cycle 2 (day 22± 2 days), immediately before conc urrent 
entinostat- pembrolizumab treatment . Depending on the location of the tumor, the 
biopsy can be a core,  excisional, or punch and performed as an outpatient procedure 
at the bedside (if palpable; e.g. subcutaneous, cutaneous, or palpable lymph node 
or CT-guided by interventional radiology). The tumor must be accessible for biopsy 
in a location considered safe for biopsy. Lung metastases should not be biopsied due to risk of pneumothorax. 
5.7.2 Peripheral Blood for Translational Endpoints  
Approximately 50 mL of peripheral blood will be collected for the purpose of 
analyzing the translational endpoint outlined in section 6.5.1.  
5.8 Duration of Therapy  
In the absence of treatment delays due to AE , treatment may continue for  up to 27 
weeks o r until:  
• Disease progression , 
• Inter -current illness that prevents further administration of treatment, 
• Unacceptable AE (s), 
• Pregnancy, 
• Patient decides to withdraw from study  treatment , OR  
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator,  
• Subject completes maximum number of treatment cycles  (i.e., 9 cycles / 27 
weeks of treatment)  allowed per protocol, 
• Subject is lost to follow -up. 
 
Subjects receiving clinical benefit after the study assessment period  (6 months ) may 
continue pembrolizumab off-study a t the investigator’s discretion , as per standard 
of care guidelines.  
5.9 Duration of Follow Up 
Patients who have not progressed on pembrolizumab plus entinostat after 27 weeks  
of treatment will be followed every 3 months (± 2 weeks) for up to 2 years following 
treatment initiation  (C1D1) . Follow ups include  phone calls  or visits. The following 
information will be recorded: (a) details regarding systemic treatment for their 
melanoma that they are currently on  (type, response if any, duration on treatment) , 
(b) whether they have progressed  (and when)  from current PD-1 inhibitor 
treatment, (c) whether treatment -related AEs that patients may have developed 
during the 27 weeks  of entinostat -pembrolizumab treatment have resolved, and 
when, (d) whether they are alive or not ; if dead, precise date of death .

Patient s who have progressed on pembrolizumab plus entinostat within the 27 
weeks of the study duration will be followed every 3 months  (± 2 weeks)  for up to 
2 years following treatment initiation . Follow up may include phone calls  or visits . 
The following inform ation will be recorded: (a)  systemic treatment for their 
melanoma they are currently on  (type, response if any, duration on systemic 
anticancer treatment s, systemic anticancer treatment- related grade 2 or higher 
AEs) , (b) whether treatment -related AEs that patients may have developed during 
the year of entinostat -pembrolizumab treatment have resolved, and when, (c) 
whether they are alive or not; if dead, precise date of death .  
 Patients removed from study treatment for una cceptable AEs will be followed for  
resolution or stabilization of the  adverse event(s). All patients (including those 
withdrawn for AEs) should be followed after removal from study treatment as stipulated in the protocol.   
5.10 Study Withdrawal  
If a patient de cides to withdraw  from the study treatment (and not just from protocol 
therapy), an effort should be made to complete and report study assessments as 
thoroughly as possible.  At the time of withdrawal, the investigator should attempt 
to establish as completely as possible the reason for the study treatment withdrawal.  
1. The patient should be asked if they are willing to allow for the abstraction 
of relevant information from their medical record to meet the long -term 
follow -up (e.g., survival  endpoints ) objec tives outlined in the protocol.   
2. A complete final evaluation at the time of the patient’s study treatment 
withdrawal should be  obtained with an explanation of why the patient is 
withdrawing from the study.   
3. If the patient is noncompliant and does not return for an end of study follow -
up assessment, this should be documented in the eCRF  as lost to follow -up.  
4. If the reason for removal of a patient from the study is an AE , the principal 
specific event will be recorded on the eCRF  per reporting guidelines.  
 
Note : Inappropriately high number of  patient  withdrawals  from protocol therapy or 
from the study  (i.e. >4 patients)  can render the study un- interpretable; therefore, 
unnecessary withdrawal of  patients should be avoided.

6.0 DRUG INFORMATION  
6.1 Entinos tat - Investigational Agent  
6.1.1 Description  
Entinostat is a synthetic orally available class I selective HDACi that belongs to the 
class of substi tuted pyridylcarbamates with a molecular weight of 376.4 . Entinostat 
belongs to the pharmacologic class of antineoplastic agents.  
6.1.2 Supplier/How Supplied/Storage/Handling  
Investigational supply of entinostat will be provided at no cost to the patient by Syndax Pharmaceuticals.  
Entinostat is an oral drug supplied by SYNDAX as pink to light red (1 mg) or 
yellow (5 mg) polymorph B coated tablets. Each tablet contains mannitol, sodium starch glycolate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, potassium bicarbonate, and magne sium 
stearate as inert fillers. The film coating consists of hypromellose, talc, titanium dioxide, and ferric oxide pigments (red and yellow) as colorants. Entinostat is to be stored at controlled room temperature (15ºC to 25ºC) in a secure, locked storage  
area to which access is limited.  Entinostat is to be protected from light and not to be exposed to extremes of temperature (greater than 30ºC or less than 5ºC). The pharmacist should dispense the investigational material to the patient at appropriate intervals throughout the study in childproof containers. 
6.1.3 Dosage and Administration 
Entinostat is to be taken on an empty stomach, at least 2 hours after a meal and at 
least 1 hour before the next meal.  If entinostat is vomited, dosing should not be re -
administered but instead the dose should be skipped.  
For weekly (or less frequent) dosing : If an entinostat dose is missed, it may be taken 
up to 48 hours after the scheduled dosing time. If it is not taken within the 48-hour window, the dose should not be taken and should be counted as a missed dose. The patient should take the next scheduled dose per protocol.   
6.1.4 Entinostat Compliance  
Treatment compliance for  entinostat dosing will be assessed at the end of each 
cycle, defined as 3 weeks (21 days). The first cy cle on study will consist only of 
entinostat (mono- therapy ). All 21- day cycles of treatment on study thereafter will 
include entinostat in combination with pembrolizumab. Patients will complete the 
IRB- approved dosing  diary for documenting date and time of  each weekly 
entinostat dose. Subjects  will be instructed to bring  all study IP  (including partially 
used bottles) to each visit, including their subject dosing diary. The dates of any 
missed doses will also be recorded in the subject dosing diary. Site staff will perform accountability of the returned drug . Patient compliance will be assessed.

6.2.4 Adverse Events Associated with Commercial Drug  
The most common AEs  (reported in ≥20% of patients in clinical trials of 
pembrolizumab) included fatigue, pruritu s, diarrhea, decreased appetite, rash, 
pyrexia, cough, dyspnea, musculoskeletal pain, constipation, and nausea. The following warnings are associated with the use of pembrolizumab:  
 
 Immune -Mediated Pneumonitis 
Pneumonitis occurred in ~3% of melanoma patients treated in clinical trials of  
pembrolizumab. The median time -to-develop ment of pneumonitis was 5 months 
with a median duration of 4.9 months.  The one patient with Grade 3 pneumonitis required initial treatment with high -dose systemic corticosteroids (greater than or 
equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper. Pneumonitis completely resolved in seven of the nine patients with Grade 2 -3 
pneumonitis.  
Immune -Mediated Colitis  
Colitis occurred  in 1% of melanoma patients treated in clinical trials of  
pembrolizumab. The median time -to-onset w as 6.5 months with a median duration 
of 2.6 months. All three patients with Grade 2 or 3 colitis were treated with high -
dose corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day).

Amendment 2    December 15, 2021  
 
59 Immune -Mediated Hepatitis  
Autoimmune hepatitis occurred in 0.5% of melanoma patients treated in clinical 
trials of pembrolizumab. The time -to-onset was 22 days for the case of Grade 4 
hepatitis , which lasted 1.1 months. The patient with Grade 4 hepatitis permanently 
discontinued pembrolizumab and was treated with high- dose (≥ 40 mg prednisone 
or equivalent per day) systemic corticosteroids followed by a corticosteroid taper. Both patients with hepatitis experienced complete resolution of the event.   
Immun e-Mediated Hypophysitis  
Hypophysitis occurred in 0.5% of melanoma patients treated in clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The time -to-onset was 1.7 months for the patient with Grade 4 
hypophysitis and 1.3 months for the patient with Grade 2 hypophysitis. Both patients were treated with high -dose (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or 
equivalent per day) corticosteroids followed by a corticosteroid taper and remained on a physiologic replacement dose.  
 
Renal Failure and Immune- Mediated Nephritis  
Neph ritis occurred in 3 (0.7%) patients of melanoma patients treated in clinical 
trials of pembrolizumab, consisting of one case of Grade 2 autoimmune nephritis (0.2%) and two cases of interstitial nephritis with renal failure (0.5%), one Grade 3 and one Grade  4. The time -to-onset of autoimmune nephritis was 11.6 months after 
the first dose of pembrolizumab (5 months after the last dose) and lasted 3.2 months; this patient did not have a biopsy. Acute interstitial nephritis was confirmed by renal biopsy in two patients with Grades 3 -4 renal failure. All three 
patients fully recovered their renal function with treatment with high -dose 
corticosteroids ( ≥40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a 
corticosteroid taper.  
 
Immune -Mediated Hyperthyroidism  
Hyperthyroidism occurred in 5 (1.2%) of 411 melanoma patients treated in clinical 
trials of pembrolizumab. The median time -to-onset was 1.5 months and the median 
duration was 2.8 months (range 0.9 to 6.1 months ). One of two patients  with Grade 
2 and the one patient with Grade 3 hyperthyroidism required initial treatment with high- dose corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent 
per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper. One patient  required permanent 
discontinuation of pembrolizumab due to hyperthyroidism. All five patients with 
hyperthyroidism experienced complete resolution of the event.  
Immune -Mediated Hypothyroidism  
Hypothyroidism occurred in 34 (8.3%) of 411 melanoma patients treated in clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The median time -to-onset of hypothyroidism was 3.5 
months. All but two of the patients with hypothyroidism were treated with long-term thyroid  hormone replacement therapy. The other two patients only required 
short- term thyroid hormone replacement therapy. No patient received 
corticosteroids or discontinued pembrolizumab for management of  
hypothyroidism. Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment.

Other Immune -Mediated Adverse Reactions  
Other clinically important immune -mediated adverse reacti ons can occur. The 
following clinically significant, immune -mediated adverse reactions occurred in 
less than 1% of patients treated with pembrolizumab, including exfoliative 
dermatitis, uveitis, arthritis, myositis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma, and  
adrenal insufficiency.  
 Across clinical studies with pembrolizumab in approximately 2 ,000 patients, the 
following additional clinically significant, immune -mediated adverse react ions 
were reported in less than 1% of patients: myasthenic syndrome, optic neuritis, and rhabdomyolysis. 
 
Embryofetal Toxicity  
Pembrolizumab may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. 
Animal models link the PD -1/PD -L1 signaling pathway wit h maintenance of 
pregnancy through induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue.   
Steven’s Johnson Syndrom e (SJS)  and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN)  
The risk  of SJS and TEN i s reported at approximately 0.4– 7 cases per million 
patient years in the general adult population. Independent risk factors include 
certain medications, such as anticonvulsants, sulfonamides, aminopenicillins, 
allopurinol, and NSAIDs. Non- medication triggers include infection, contrast 
media, and vaccinations. Mali gnancy is associated with an increased mortality rate 
in patients with SJS and TEN.  
Myocarditis 
A total of 6 cases of myocarditis have been reported in patients treated with pembrolizumab in clinical trials in an expanded access program. There was one fatal case reported in a clinical trial.  Immune -mediated myocarditis should be 
suspected if other causes of myocarditis, such as infection or prior radiation 
therapy, have been excluded. Risk factors include certain medications and 
treatment modalities , such as radiation, anthracycline, alkylating agents and, most 
recently , checkpoint inhibitors.  
 
6.3 Clinical Assessments  
Clinical assessments will be performed as outlined in the Time and Events Table in 
Section 7.1. 
6.3.1 Concomitant Medications  
All concomitant medication and concurrent therapies will be documented at Baseline/Screening and throughout the study, as summarized in the Time and 
Events Table in Section 7.1. Dose, route, unit frequency of administration, and 
indication for administration and dates of medication will be captured.

Amendment 2    December 15, 2021  
 
61 6.3.2 Demographics  
Demographic information (date of birth, gender, race) will be recorded at 
Screening. 
6.3.3 Medical History  
Relevant medical  history, including history of current disease, patient 
demographics, other pertinent history  and information regarding underlying 
diseases will be recorded at s creening and a focused medical history on 
symptoms/toxicity will be performed thereafter.  
6.3.4 Phys ical Examination  
For screening : A complete physical examination , including height (at screening 
only), weight, examin ation of skin, ECOG performance status and vital signs (i.e., 
weight, temperature , blood pressure , heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation) 
will be performed at s creening and the first study visit #.   Qualified staff (MD, NP, 
RN, and PA) may complete the abbreviated physical exam  (i.e., focused on 
symptoms/toxicity as noted below) at all other visits.   
 
After screening  starting on D1/ Cycle 1 /Wk1:  physical exam should be focused on 
symptoms/toxicity including weight, examination of skin, ECOG performance 
status and vital signs  thereafter.  New abnormal physical exam findings must be 
documented and will be followed by a physician or other qualified staff at the next 
scheduled visit.  
6.3.5 Adverse Events  
Events should be assessed per NCI -CTCAE criteria v5.0. Information  regarding 
occurrence of AEs will be captured throughout the study. Duration (start and stop 
dates), severity/g rade, outcome, treatment and relation to study drug will be 
recorded in the CRF.  
6.3.6 Disease Assessment  
This following test should be performed for assessment of melanoma disease. 
6.3.6.1 Computed tomography (CT) of the  whole body i .e., neck (if applicable), 
chest, abdomen, pelvis with IV contrast  (or abdominal/pelvis MRI if allergy to IV 
contrast)   
Baseline (screening) disease assessment should be obtained within 21 days of 
initiating study treatment . During the study, scans will be repeated as outlined in 
the Time and Events table in section 7.1 (i.e., at the end of week 10[ D1 of cycle 4 
or Study day 64/Wk10] , end of week 15 [ D1 of cycle 6 i .e., Study day 106/ Wk16], 
end of week 21 [D1 of cycle 8  or Study day 148/Wk22] , and end of week 27) .  
Scans obtained during study treatment may be performed within ±7 days of the 
scheduled study visit.

62 6.3.6.2 Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI) of the brain  
MRI of the brain must be obtained at baseline (screening) and at end of treatment 
(i.e., at time of disease progression or at week 27); on any other visit only if 
clinically indicated , as per standard of care.  If brain MRI is not feasible, patient 
can have a CT scan with IV contrast.  
6.3.7 Pre-Screening Pathology Assessment Period (pre -screening  only ) 
Given the limited 21- day screening period, and the requirement for absent TIL/TAL 
in melanoma tissues, a rchival metastatic tissue (locoregional, distant metastatic) 
can be requested and assessed before study enrollment (pre -screening) .  There is 
not an official pre -screening period given that Dr. Googe, study’s pathologist, is 
UNC’s sole melanoma pathologist and routinely signs off his pathology reports, 
either from outside consultation slides or from in -house cases, along with a report 
about the presence of absence of tumor -infiltrating/- associated lymphocytes. If not 
available already, representative tumor sections from archived tumor block s will be 
stained with H&E and will be assessed by Dr. Paul Googe, study pathologist, for assessment of quality  using these criteria:  (1) the tumor surface area must be at 
least 1cm
2 (which can be from a combination of metastatic blocks if necessary), (2) 
no more than 20% of necrosis, (3) the ratio of viable tumor cells to tumor- associated 
stroma should be at least 60/40, and (4) i f TILs are present based  on H&E stained 
sections, they must be ≤  1% of the total number of cells in the specimen; the amount 
of tissue should be ≥ 1 cm2.  
If archival tissue is unavailable or insufficient, a fresh biopsy should be performed 
to confirm unresectable stage III or dis tant metastatic disease.  If the patient 
qualifies , then they can sign  the informed consent.  
6.3.8 Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed at screening and on cycles 2, 4, 6, 8, as outlined 
in the Time and Events table. 
6.3.9 Patient Pill Diary (Entinos tat) 
A patient  pill diary will be checked  at the beginning of each cycle and should be 
kept by subject for self -documentation of entinostat dosing (as outlined in the Time 
and Events table). A single 5 mg tablet is to be taken on day 1, day 8, and day 15 
of each cycle within the specified 21 -day cycle windows . See S ection 6.0 for 
information on entinostat drug supply, storage, handling and compliance.  
6.4 Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
6.4.1 Hematology  
Blood will be obtained and sent to the clinical site hematology lab  for assessment 
of a complete blood count  with differential (i.e., hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood 
cell count, white blood cell count, white blood cell differential, and platelet count) , 
as outlined in the time and events table.

Amendment 2    December 15, 2021  
 
63  
Hematology labs should be performed pre-study and on D1 at every treatment cycle 
and at the end of treatment (i.e., D1C1, D1C2, D1C3, etc.), as outlined in the Time 
and Events Table . 
6.4.2 Blood Chemistry Profile  
Blood will be obtained and sent to the clinical site chemistry lab for determination of the following: sodium ( Na) potassium (K),  chloride (Cl), creatinine, blood urea 
nitrogen ( BUN), aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ), alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT ), total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase,  glucose, total protein, albumin, 
calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ), amylase, and 
lipase .  
 All listed serum chemistries will be performed during screening, D1 of each treatment cycle,  and at the end of treatment as outlined in the Time and E vents 
table . 
6.4.3 Urinalysis  
A standard urinalysis test (Dipstick test) will be obtained at screening and at C ycle 
1, and at other times as clinically indicated , as outlined in the Time and Events table 
below. The analysis includes testing for the presence of proteins, glucose, ketones, hemoglobin, bilirubin, urobilinogen, nitrite, and leucocytes as well as testing of pH and specific gravity.  
6.4.4 Endocrine  Test  
At the screening visit  and then repeated on D1 of cycle 4/ week  10 visit (section 
7.4.4) and D1 of cycle 6/week 16 visit (section 7.4.6 ): The endocrine test at baseline 
should include  measurement of t hyroid stimulating hormone (TSH),  free thyroxine 
4 (fT4).  
 
During study treatment on D1 of cycles 7, 8 and 9 scheduled at weeks 19, 22, 25, 
respectively,  and also at the end of study visit : the endocrine test will only need to 
include TSH and f T4. 
6.4.5 Pregnancy Test  
A pregnancy test  (β-hCG) will be obtained from female subjects who are of 
childbearing age prior to their participation in the study .  A negative urine 
pregnancy test must be perform ed within 3 days prior to receiving the first dose of 
study drug i.e., within 72 hours of administration of the first dose of entinostat .

64 6.5 Correlative Studies  
6.5.1 Collection of Per ipheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC)  
Peripheral blood ( approximately 50 mL at each time point) will be collected for 
isolation of PBMCs using the Ficoll isolation  technique for multiparameter flow 
cytomet ry (immunoregulatory subsets and assessment of H3 and H4 acetylation 
levels).  
 
Samples will be collected at  baseline; in the end of cycle 1, beginning of cycle 2 
(day 22± 2 days), immediately before concurrent entinostat -pembrolizumab; week 
10; and end of treatment  (i.e., at time of withdrawal for progression or other 
reasons)  D105/wk16 visits, as outlined in the Time and Events table  in Section 7.1. 
6.5.2 Mandatory On- Treatment Biopsy   
A mandatory (excisional, punch or CT -guided) biopsy will be obtained in the end 
of cycle 1, beginning of cycle 2 (day 22± 2 days), immediately before concurrent 
entinostat- pembrolizumab treatment . 
 
 6.5.3  Targeted panel somatic mutation sequencing  
If this  has not been previously done as part of patient’s standard of care, a rchived 
tumor tissue will be submitted to Foundation Medicine (foundationmedicine.com) 
for FoundationOne  testing . FoundationOne  assesses somatic mutations across 
300 cancer -associated genes, computes tumor mutation burden, assesses expression 
of PD -L1, and calcul ates tumor infiltrating lymphocyte density , as per standard of 
care.   If patient’s tumo r has been previously submitted for targeted panel 
sequencing using other commercially ava ilable tests these tests would be acceptable 
on condition that sequencing has been performed on  >100 genes and that  all 
exomes  of these genes have been sequenced (i.e.  not just hotspot mutations).   
Results from other non -FoundationOne targeted sequenc ing panels will be at the 
discretion of the principal Investigator.  Results are not required to be available at the time of initiation of study treatment.

7.6 Handling of Bio specimens Collected for Correlative Research  
Bio specimens  collected for this study will be stored in the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer 
Center (LCCC) Tissue Procurement Facility (TPF), or, if needed, in a secure o ff-site st orage 
facility. All bio specimens  will be obtained in accordance with procedures outlined in the LCCC 
1729 Study Laboratory Manual and stored in containers with controlled access. Each sample 
will be assigned a unique code number and no identifiable personal health information (PHI) 
will be on the specimen label.  Information about the patient’s disease will be linked to the specimens stored in the repository database. TPF -associated research staff, LCCC 
Bioinformatics staff who support the TPF da tabase and the LCCC Data Warehouse, and 
researchers with IRB -approval for access to PHI for each subject in this study will be able to 
link specimens to relevant medical information. Some results from laboratory analyses that occurred during the patient’s participation in the clinical study may also be included. This information may be important for understanding how the patient’s cancer developed and responded to treatment. Storage Time: 1. The biospecimen will be used first and foremost for research purposes  outlined within the 
confines of this protocol. Samples will be discarded/destroyed after relevant data are collected for this study, unless consent was obtained from the patient to use tissue for other research purposes (e.g., TPF consent form was signed by the patient).  In this circumstance, there is no time limit on how long biospecimens may be stored. 
2. The Principal Investigator must agree to abide by policies and procedures of the TPF 
facility and sign a letter of research agreement for ethical and appropriate conduct of their research that utilizes specimens obtained from the TPF facility (e.g., u se of leftover 
specimens will require a protocol outlining the research plan for biospecimen use).  
 Compliance Statement  
Biospecimen collection for this study will be conducted in full accordance to all applicable 
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC -CH) Research Policies and Procedures and 
all applicable Federal and state laws and regulations including 45 CFR 46, and the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule. Any episode of noncompliance will be documented. 
 The investigators will perform the study in accordance with this protocol, will obtain consent 
and assent (unless a waiver  is granted), and will report unexpect ed problems in accordance with 
the UNC- CH IRB Policies and Procedures and all federal requirements. Collection, recording, 
and reporting of data will be accurate and will ensure the privacy, health, and welfare of rese arch 
subjects during and after the study.

72 7.7 Assessment of Safety  
Any patient who receives at least one dose of entinostat  will be evaluable for toxicity.  Each 
patient will be assessed periodically for the development of any toxicity according to the Time  
and Events table.  Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI CTCAEv5.0.   
7.8 Assessment of Efficacy  
7.8.1 Assessment of Disease -Tumor Measurement Based on RECIST v1.1 
See the international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) Committee, version 1.1 for additional details and clarifications149,150.  
 
Measurable disease will be defined as the presence of at least one measurable lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with the longest diameter a minimum size of:  
• >10 mm by CT scan (C T scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)  
• 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be accurately measured 
with calipers should be recorded as non- measurable).  
• 20 mm by chest x-ray. 
 
For malignant- appearing  lymph nodes  on radiogra phic imaging that can  be considered 
pathologically enlarged and measurable a lymph node must be ≥15 mm in short axis when 
assessed by CT scan  with IV contrast performed with slice thickness ≤  5 mm).  At baseline and 
in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.    All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10  mm or pathological lymph 
nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis) as well as truly non- measurable lesions, will be 
considered non- measurable.  Lesions considered truly non- measurable include:  leptomeningeal 
disease; ascites; pleural/pericardial effusion; inflammatory breast disease; lymphangitic 
involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical 
exam that is not m easurable by reproducible imaging techniques. 
 All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers , if clinically assessed. 
All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 21-days before the beginning of the treatment.  The same method of assessment 
and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and d uring follow -up.  Imaging- based evaluation should always be done rather tha n 
clinical examination , unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable 
by clinical exam.  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and ≥10 mm diameter , as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesions is 
recommended.  
7.8.2 Baseline Documentation of Target and Non- Target Lesions 
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline.   
LCCC 1729  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Stergios Moschos, M.D.  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Amendment 2    December 15, 2021  
 
73  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longer di ameter), 
growth rate at the time of study enrollment (stable or regressing tumor lesions should be excluded, irrespective of other parameters), be representative of all involved organs, and, in 
addition, should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  
 A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lym ph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 All other lesions (or sites of disease) , including pathological lymph nodes, should be identified 
as non- target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required 
and these lesions should be followed as “present” or “absent”, or in rare cases “unequ ivocal 
progression”.   
7.8.3 Evaluation of Target Lesions using RECIST 1.1 Criteria  
NOTE:  In addition to the information below, also see section 4.3.2 in the international criteria 
proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee, version 1.1 
150 for special notes on the assessment of target lesions.  
 
Complete re sponse (CR ) − Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph node  
(whether target or non- target) must have decreased in short axis to <10  mm. 
 
Partial response (PR ) −At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of the target lesions  taking 
as reference the baseline sum LD.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD ) − At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of the target lesions 
taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started including baseline if that is the smallest on study.  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5  mm.  The appearance of one or more new lesions 
also constitutes PD.  
 
Stable disease (SD ) − Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.  
7.8.4 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions using RECIST  1.1 Criteria  
Complete response (CR ) − Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization  of tumor 
marker levels.  All LN must be non -pathological in size (<10  mm short axis).   
 
Non-complete response (non- CR)/non -progression (non- PD) − Persistence of ≥1  non- target 
lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive disease (PD ) − Appearance of ≥1 new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of 
existing non- target lesions.

74 7.8.5 Evaluation of Best Overall Response using RECIST 1.1 Criteria  
Please see review the RECIST v1.1 criteria for complete details150. The best overall response is 
the best response recorded from the start of the study treatment until the end of treatment , 
provided the confirmation criteria are met.  To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in 
tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat studies that should be performed > 4 weeks 
after the criteria for response are first met. If a CR/PR cannot be confirmed , the original 
‘response’ should be considered stable disease.  The best overall response will be defined 
according to the following table:  
 
Overall  
Response First 
Time Point  Overall Response 
Subsequent Time 
Point  BEST Overall Response  
CR CR CR 
CR PR SD, PD, or PR1

NE NE2 NE2 
1 If a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR criteria relative 
to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR).  Best response would depen d on 
whether minimum duration for SD was met.  However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed when subsequent scans suggest small 
lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the first time point.  Under these circumstances,  the 
original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.

8.0 ADVERSE EVENTS 
8.1 Definition s  
8.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE  is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with th e use of a drug) in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.   
 
Laboratory abnormalities that do not require dose modification for entinostat, h ospitalization 
for elective surgery or routine clinical procedures that are not the result of an AE (e.g., surgical 
insertion of central line) need not be considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE.  
LCCC 1729  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Stergios Moschos, M.D.  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Amendment 2    December 15, 2021  
 
75 Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE, unless it i s attributable by the investigator 
to the study therapy. 
8.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction  (SAR)  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility  that 
the drug is the cause.  Reasonable possibility  means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the AE.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree 
of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE  caused by a drug.   
 
Causality assessment to a study drug is a medical judgment made in consideration of the 
following factors: temporal relationship of the AE to study drug exposure, known mechanism 
of action or side effect profile of study treatment, other recent or concomitant drug exposures , 
normal clinical course of the disease under investigation, and any other underlying or concurrent medical conditions .  Other factors to consider in considering drug as the cause of the AE: 
1. Single occurrence of an uncommon event known to be strongly assoc iated with drug 
exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens- Johnson Syndrome) . 
2. One or more occurrences of an event not commonly associated with drug exposure, but otherwise uncommon in the population (e.g., tendon rupture) ; often more than once 
occurrence from one or multiple studies would be needed before the sponsor could determine that there is reasonable possibility  that the drug caused the event.   
3. An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial that indicates the events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group. 
8.1.3 Unexpected AE  or SAR  
An AE or SAR is considered unexpected if its specificity or severity is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure [IB] for an unapproved 
investigational product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product).   Unexpected also refers to AEs or SARs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring w ith 
a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.   
8.1.4 Serious AE  or SAR  
A SAE  is one that at any dose (including overdose): 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening
1 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity2 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event3 
• Pregnancy  
 
1 “Life -threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the SAE ; it does not refer 
to a SAE  that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
2 “Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means that there is a substantial disruption of a person’s ability 
to carry out normal life functions.  
LCCC 1729  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Stergios Moschos, M.D.  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Amendment 2    December 15, 2021  
 
76 3 Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in 
situations where none of the outcomes listed above occurred.  Important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above should also usually be  considered 
serious.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.  A new diagnosis of cancer during the course of a treatment shoul d be considered 
as medically important.  
 
The investigator will report serious, unexpected reactions to the FDA, Syndax, and the IRB in 
accordance with applicable laws and regulations.    
8.2 Document ation of non- serious AEs or SARs  
For non- serious A Es or SARs , documentation must begin from day 1 of study treatment and 
continue until patient completes  the 30 -day follow-up period assessments. 
 
Collected information should be rec orded in the e CRF  and source documentation appropriately . 
Please include a descriptio n of the event, its severity or toxicity grade, onset and resolved dates 
(if applicable), and the relationship to the study drug.  Documentation should occur at least 
monthly.  8.3 SAEs or Serious SAR s  
8.3.1 Timing  
After informed consent but prior to initiation of study medications, only SAEs caused by a 
protocol- mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. SAEs related to invasive procedures such 
as biopsies, medication washout ).  
 For any other experience or condition that meets the definition of an SAE or a  serious SAR , 
recording of the event must begin from day 1 of study treatment and continue through the  30-day follow-up period after treatment is discontinued.  
8.3.2 Documentation  and Notification 
SAEs or Serious SA Rs must be recorded in the SAE console  within OnCore
® for that patient 
within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence and will reported to SYNDAX.   
8.4 Adverse Event Reporting  
8.4.1 IRB Reporting Requirements:  
UNC: 
• The UNC- IRB will be notified of all S AEs that qualify as an Unanticipated Problem as 
per the UNC IRB Policies using the IRB’s web -based reporting system (see section 
9.5.3) within 7 days of the Investigator becoming aware of the problem.

77 Pregnancy 
Pregn ancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age 
or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on study , or within 30 days 
of the subject’s last dose of study should be recorded as SAEs.  The pa tient is to be  discontinued 
immediately  from the study .  
 
The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician -gynecologist, preferably one 
experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.  The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must document the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome)  and report the 
condition of the fetus or newborn to the  UNC Study Coordinator. If the outcome of the 
pregnancy was abnormal (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion), the Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE.   
8.4.2 Syndax Reporting Requir ements:  
The investigator must inform Syndax in writing using a SAE form or MEDWATCH 3500A form of any SAE within 24 hours of being aware of the event.  The date of awareness should be noted on the report.  The written report must be completed and supplied to Syndax within 24 hours/1 business day at the latest on the following working day.  The initial report must be as complete as possible, including details of the current illness and (serious) AE , and an assessment 
of the causal relationship between the ev ent and the investigational product(s).  SAE reports 
must include  the Syndax Study ID Number, the Site Number, the Subject ID Number, and the 
name of the PI .  Information not available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end date for 
the AE or laboratory values received after the report) must be documented on a follow -up report.  
A final report to document resolution of the SAE is required.  SAEs  should be sent via email to: 
 
SyndaxSAEReporting@syndax.com  
8.4.3 FDA Expedited Reporting requirements for studies conducted under an IND:  
A sponsor must report any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected to the 
FDA. The sponsor must report an AE  as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence 
to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event, such as: 
1. A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome); 
2. One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with dr ug 
exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g. tendon rupture);  
3. An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group.  
The sponsor must submit each IND safety report on FDA Form 3500A. Each notification to FDA must bear prominent identification of its contents, i.e., ‘IND Safety Report,’  and must be 
transmitted to the review division that has the responsibility for review of the IND. In each IND 
LCCC 1729  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Stergios Moschos, M.D.  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Amendment 2    December 15, 2021  
 
78 safety report, the sponsor must identify all IND safety reports previously submitted to FDA 
concerning a similar suspected adverse reaction and  must analyze the significance of the 
suspected adverse reaction in light of previous, si milar reports or any other relevant information.  
 
Timing  
FDA must be notified of potential serious risks within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines the event requires reporting. FDA must be notified of unexpected fatal or life -
threatening suspec ted adverse reactions as soon as possible but in no case later than 7 calendar 
days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. If the results of a sponsor’s investigation show that an AE  not initially determined to be reportable is reportable,  the sponsor 
must report such suspected adverse reaction in an IND safety report as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the determination is made.  
 
Follow-up 
The sponsor must promptly investigate all safety information it rec eives. Relevant follow -up 
information to an IND safety report must be submitted as soon as the information is available and must be identified as such, i.e., ‘Follow -up IND Safety Report.’  Additionally, upon request 
from FDA, the sponsor must submit to FDA any additional data or information that the agency deems necessary, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after receiving the request.  
 
Notification of Investigators  
The sponsor must notify all participating investigators (i.e., all investigators to whom the 
sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any investigator’s IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calenda r days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies 
for reporting.   
Process  
If the sponsor deems that an event is both a serious adverse reaction (SAR)  AND unexpected, it 
must also (in addition to OnCore®) be re corded  on the MedWatch Form 3 500A as per 21 CFR 
312.32. Unexpected AEs  or adverse reaction refers to an event or reaction that is not listed in the 
investigator’s brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or if an investigator’s brochure is not r equired or available, is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the general investigation plan or elsewhere in the current IND application.    The MedWatch form should be submitted on MedWatch by the study coordinator.   The MedWatch 3500a form can be accessed at : 
http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/DownloadForms/default.htm
.  
 Note: (Please be sure and access form 3500a, and not form 35 00).  
 The MedWatch form should also be sent to the UNC -CH Regulatory Associate and the IND 
Specialist within 48 hours of the sponsor being aware of the event.  The Regulatory Associate

Amendment 2    December 15, 2021  
 
79 with the aid of the IND Specialist will submit the IND Safety Report via IND serial submission 
to the FDA review division.  All IND safety reports must be submitted on Form 3500A and be accompanied by Form 1571.  
The FDA must be notified or any unexpected or life -threatening suspected adverse reactions as 
soon as possible, but no later than 7 calendar days of learning of the event.  
Additional Reporting Requirements 
The following additional items must be reported via IND safety report: 1. Findings from other studies. The sponsor must report any findings from epidemiol ogical 
studies, pooled analysis of multiple studies, or clinical studies, whether or not conducted under an IND, and whether or not conducted by the sponsor, that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug.  
2. Findings from animal or in vitro t esting. The sponsor must report any findings from 
animal or in vitro testing, whether or not conducted by the sponsor, that suggest a 
significant risk in humans exposed to the drug, such as reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity, or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the 
expected human exposure.  
3. Increased rate of occurrence of serious suspected adverse reactions.  
 
Additional Guidance  
Please refer to 21CFR312.32 and “Guidance for Industry and Investigators: Safety Reporting 
Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies” for additional information and reporting 
requirements. All IND Safety Reports will be submitted in accordance with regulat ions and 
guidance provided.   
8.5 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
The Princip al Investigator will provide continuous monitoring of patient safety in this trial with 
periodic reporting to the Data and Safety Monitoring C ommittee (DSM C).  
 
Meetings/teleconferences will be held at a frequ ency dependent on study accrual  and in 
consultati on with the study Biostatistician.  These meetings will include  the investigators  as 
well as protocol nurse s, clinical research associates , regulatory associat es, data manager s, 
biostatistician s, and any other relevant personnel the principal investigators  may deem 
appropriate.  At these meetings, the research team will discuss all issues relevant to study 
progress, including enrollment, safety, regulatory, data collection, etc.  
 The team will produce summaries or minutes of these meetings. These summaries will be available for inspection when requested by any of the regulatory bodies charged with the safety of human subjects and the integrity of data including, but not limited to, the oversight ( Office 
of Human Research Ethics (OHRE) Biomedical  IRB, the Oncology Protocol Review 
Committee (PRC) or the North Carolina TraCS Institute  Data  and Safety Monitoring Board  
(DSMB) .

80 The UNC- CH LCCC Data and Safety  Monitoring Committee (DSMC ) will review the study on 
a regular (quarterly to annually) basis, with the frequency of review based on risk and 
complexity as determined by the UNC -CH Protocol Review Committee .  The UNC PI will be 
responsible for submitting the following information for review: 1) safety and accr ual data 
including the number of patients treated; 2) significant developments reported in the literature 
that may affect the safety of participants or the ethics of the study; 3) preliminary response data; and 4) summaries of team meetings that have occurred since the last report.  Findings of the 
DSMC review will be disseminated by memo to the UNC PI, PRC, and the UNC IRB and 
DSMB.    
9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This is a phase II study using one FDA -approved drug, pembrolizumab, and an investigational 
agent, entinostat.  
9.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints  
All patients will receive pembrolizumab plus entinostat for up to 27 weeks. Drugs will be sequentially introduced; such that correlative analysis can be performed to investigate the 
indirect immunomodulatory ef fect of entinostat alone and in combination with pembrolizumab 
by performing serial peripheral blood collections (4 time points) and tumor collection (2 time 
points). Assessment of response to the treatment combination will be assessed at week 10 and then every 6 weeks of pembrolizumab treatment for up to 27- weeks.  
 
9.1.1  Definitions  
Evaluable patients are those who complete all activities by at least day 2 2, namely: (a) they have 
received at least one and up to 4 entinostat weekly doses on day 1 and day 8, 15 and 22 (b) they 
have received the first pembrolizumab infusion on day 2 2 (±2 days), and (c) they have 
completed day 22 (±2 days) mandatory tumor biopsy. The rationale for this is to answer the 
primary translational endpoint regarding entinostat -alone immunomodulatory effects in 
peripheral blood and tumor tissue with sufficient power.  
- SAE  are events that meet FDA’s defi nition as defined in section 8.1.4  of the protocol 
irrespective of attribution to study drug(s) . Subjects who receive at least one dose of entinostat 
are evaluable for safety.  
-ORR by RECIST 1.1 criteria is t he sum of complete response and partial response.  
-PFS is measured from the date of enrollment on study to the date of documented progression. 
The rate of patients who are progression -free will be specifically calculated at 27 -weeks 
(approximately 6 months ) from study entry.  
-OS is measured from the date of enrollment on study to the recorded date of death. The rate of 
patients who are alive at 27 -week (approximately 6 months) will be specifically calculated for 
the study.

12.0 APPENDICES  
APPENDIX A  PROHIBITED MEDICATIONS  FOR ENTINOSTAT  
 
Examples of sensitive in vivo CYP substrates and CYP substrates with narrow therapeutic 
range are summarized below.   
  
Examples of substrates that may be affected by entinostat  
CYP Enzymes   
 Substrates with narrow therapeutic range1 
CYP1A2  Theophylline, tizanidine  
CYP2C8   
 Paclitaxel  
CYP3A2  Alfentanil, astemizole3, cisapride3, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, 
ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, 
terfenadine3  
1. CYP substrates with narrow therapeutic range refers to drugs whose exposure -response relationship 
indicates that small increases in their exposure levels by the concomitant use of CYP inhibitors may lead to serious safety concerns (e.g., torsade de pointes ). 
2. Because a number of CYP3A substrates (e.g., darunavir, maraviroc) are also substrates of P -gp, the 
observed increase in exposure could be due to inhibition of both CYP3A and P -gp. Note: The prohibited 
use of fentanyl does not apply to the study biopsy p rocedure.  
3. Withdrawn from the United States market because of safety reasons.

98 APPENDIX B  P ATIENT HANDOUT -PROHIBITED MEDICATIONS  
 
Prohibited Medications or those to be used with caution 
One of the medications you are receiving during this clinical trial is entinostat.   
Entinostat interacts with some drugs that are processed by your liver. Because of this, it is very important to tell your study doctors about all of your medicine before you start this study. It is also very important to tell them if you stop taking any regular medicine, or if you start taking a new medicine while you take part in this study. When you talk about your medicine with your study doctor, include medicine you buy without a prescription at the drug store (over -the counter remedy), or 
anything that you buy from the health food store or grocery store (herbal supplement). Many health care prescribers can write prescriptions. You must also tell your other prescribers (doctors, physicians’ assistants or nurse practitioners) that you are taking part in a clinical trial. Bring this paper  with you .  
• Entinostat is processed by a certain enzyme in the liver called CYP s including 
CYP 3A4.  Entinostat should not be given with dr ugs that are sensitive substrates 
of CYP1A2, CYP2C8, and CYP3A that have a narrow therapeutic window  
• You and healthcare providers who prescribe drugs for you must be careful about adding or removing any drugs in the above categories.  
• Before you start the study, your study doctor will work with your regular 
prescriber to switch the following medications if you are taking them: Theophylline, tizanidine, paclitaxel,  alfentanil, astimizole, cisapride,

Amendment 2    December 15, 2021  
 
99 APPENDIX C  ARCHIVED TUMOR TISSUE FOR ENROLLMENT  
 
Below is a sample  letter  (e-mail of this form is also acceptable) from the pathologist 
stating the adequacy of archived  of tumor tissue for patient eligibility  
 Dear Dr. Moschos,  
 I have reviewed the hematoxylin and eosin- stained (H&E) slides corresponding to 
[SCREENING SUBJECT ID NUMBER and SUBJECT INITIALS]’s [PATIENT’S NUMBER OF AVAILABLE METASTATIC MELANOMA TISSUE BLOCKS) archived tumor block from the [PATIENT’S DIFFERENT 
PATHOLOGY ACCESION NUMBERS CORRESPONDIND TO PREVIOUS STANDARD OF CARE SURGICAL OR BIOPSY PROCEDURES]. I have confirmed that:  
 The total tumor surface area from all the melanoma tissue blocks I have reviewed is at least 1 cm
2.  will release 11 -15 5- micron tissue section on charged slides to 
your institution for research analysis.  
 The tumor contains no more  than 20% necrosis  
 The ratio of melanoma to stroma cells is at least 60:40. 
 
I attest that none of the H&E slides I have reviewed contains evidence of ≥  1% 
tumor- infiltrating or tumor- associated mononuclear cells.  
 I attest that the total volume of corresponding tumor tissue that is contained within these block(s) is sufficient to yield fifteen (15) 10 -micron tumor sections for your 
molecular correlative studies (i.e. FoundationOne® testing, RNA -seq, FAIRE 
analysis)  
 I attest that the total volume of corresponding tumor tissue that is contained within these block(s) is sufficient to yield addition ten (10) 5 -micron tumor sections for 
your tumor imaging correlative studies (immunohistochemistry and/or immunofluorescence)  
 
 Sincerely,  
 Dr. Paul B. Googe [PRINTED NAME AND MAILING ADDRESS]

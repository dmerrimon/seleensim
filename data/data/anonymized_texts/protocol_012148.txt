Study Measurements 
CONFIDENTIAL and inclusion/exclusion criteria reviewed to determine subject eligibility. 
Subjects that require a "washout" period prior to enrollment to meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria requirements will be required to return to the 
clinic within 45 days to complete the remaining activities. Subjects who 
require "washout" for longer than 45 days will be re-consented. A brief 
physical examination including vital signs, UPT (if applicable), 
electrocardiogram (ECG), Fitzpatrick Skin Type assessment, clinical 
evaluations (lesions counts, IGA, as well as baseline local skin reactions 
(LSRs) pre-application), and photographs will be performed at this visit. 
Prior and concomitant therapy and concomitant medications/procedures 
will be reviewed. Subjects will be randomized and assigned a test article 
kit number. Test article and Subject Diary will be dispensed. Subjects and 
parent/guardian (if applicable) will be instructed on how to apply the test 
article and to record applications in the Subject Diary. The first dose will 
be applied during this visit under supervision of the investigator. Adverse 
events (AEs) and LSRs post-application will be assessed. The subject will 
be scheduled for the first follow-up visit. 
2. Visits 2 and 3 (Weeks 4 & 8): Subjects will return after the initial 
treatment for clinical evaluations (lesion counts, IGA, AEs, and LSRs), 
UPT (if applicable), and review of concomitant medications/procedures. 
Test article application and compliance will be reviewed (from Subject 
Diary), test article and Subject Diary will be dispensed/returned (as 
required), and photography will be performed. The subject will be 
scheduled for the next follow-up visit. 
3. Visit 4 (Final Visit. Week 12 & Early Termination): Subjects will return 
for the final visit for review of concomitant medications/procedures, UPT 
(if applicable), ECG, clinical evaluations (lesion counts, IGA, AEs, and 
LSRs), and photography. All test article will be returned and compliance 
documented (from Subject Diary). 
Efficacy will be assessed by the investigator as follows: 
• Investigator's Global Assessment OGA): Overall severity of acne using 
a five-point scale from 0 = clear to 4 = severe will be conducted at each 
visit. This is a static morphological scale that refers to a point in time 
and not a comparison to Baseline. 
• Acne Lesion Counts: Total lesions, including inflammatory lesions 
(papules, pustules, and nodules) and non-inflammatory lesions (open 
and closed comedones), on the face will be accurately counted, but 
recorded separately at each visit. 
Assessment of subject satisfaction with the treatment will be obtained using a 
four-point scale from (very satisfied) to (not satisfied at 
all) at the final visit (Week 12). 
Safety will be assessed by the investigator via the evaluation of local and 
systemic AEs and UPTs at each visit (Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, and 12, or at the 
end of treatment). ECGs will also be assessed at Baseline and Week 12. 
LSRs including telangiectasia, skin atrophy, striae rubrae, erythema, edema, 
and scaling/dryness will be assessed by the investigator at each visit using a

Study Endpoints 
Sample Size 
Calculations and Power 
Considerations 
CONFIDENTIAL five-point ordinal scale (0 none, I trace, 2 mild, 3 moderate, and 4 
severe). Subjects will be asked to rate the severity of stinging/burning and 
pruritus using a four-point scale (0 none, I mild, 2 moderate, and 3 
severe) at each visit (Baseline [pre· and post-application], and Weeks 4, 8, and 
12). 
Efficacy Endpoints: 
Primary Endpoints (Hierarchical) 
• Pl: Proportion of subjects in each treatment group achieving 
"success" at Week 12, with "success" defined as an IGA score of 
"clear (score=O)" or "almost clear (score=l)" AND at least a two-
point reduction in IGA compared to Baseline. 
• P2: Absolute change from Baseline in non-inflammatory lesion 
counts in each treatment group at Week 12. 
• P3: Absolute change from Baseline in inflammatory lesion counts in 
each treatment group at Week 12. 
Secondary Endpoints (Hierarchical) 
• Sl: Absolute change from Baseline in total lesions counts in each 
treatment group at Week 12. 
• S2: Percent change from Baseline in total lesions counts in each 
treatment group at Week 12. 
• S3: Percent change from Baseline in non-inflammatory lesions count 
in each treatment group at Week 12. 
• S4: Percent change from Baseline in inflammatory lesions count in 
each treatment group at Week 12. 
Safety Endpoints: 
• Local and systemic AEs at every visit (Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, and 12). 
• LSRs: telangiectasia, skin atrophy, striae rubrae, erythema, edema, 
scaling/dryness, stinging/burning, and pruritus scored by frequency 
and severity at every visit (Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, and 12). 
• UPTs in all WOCBP at every visit (Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, and 12). 
• Material changes from Baseline in ECGs at Week 12. 
Assumptions used for sample size calculations were estimated from Phase 2 
Dose Escalation Study (171-7151-201), using a subset of subjects with 30-75 
inflammatory lesions and 30-100 non-inflammatory lesions at Baseline. 
All the hypothesis tests for the primary endpoints have to be performed at the 
same significance level two-sided and the failure to reject a null 
hypothesis will imply the failure of rejecting all of the subsequent null 
hypotheses. 
In order to keep the overall Type II error for the whole study, the sample 
size for the three hypothesis tests on the primary endpoints will be calculated 
considering an individual Type II error 
For an IGA success rate of(continuity corrected) 14.00% for CB-03-01 cream 
and 2.17% for vehicle cream (odds sample size was estimated to be 
202 subjects per treatment group.

Statistical Methods 
CONFIDENTIAL For a mean absolute change from Baseline in non-inflammatory lesion counts 
of -22 for CB-03-0 I cream and -1 for vehicle cream (standard 17), 
sample size was calculated to be 19 subjects per treatment group. 
For a mean absolute change from Baseline in inflammatory lesion counts of-
15 for CB-03-01 cream and -10 for vehicle cream (standard 
sample size was calculated to be 334 subjects per treatment group. 
The hypothesis test for the secondary endpoints will be performed at the same 
significance level two-sided of the primary endpoints if and only if all 
the null hypotheses on the primary endpoints are rejected. 
For a mean absolute change from Baseline in total lesion counts of -35 for CB-
03-01 cream and -13 for vehicle cream (standard sample size 
was calculated to be 13 subjects per treatment group. 
For a mean percent change from Baseline in total lesion counts of -35 for CB-
03-01 cream and -14 for vehicle cream (standard sample size 
was calculated to be 77 subjects per treatment group. 
For a mean percent change from Baseline in non-inflammatory lesion counts of 
-33 for CB-03-01 cream and -5 for vehicle cream (standard 
sample size was calculated to be 43 subjects per treatment group. 
For a mean percent change from Baseline in inflammatory lesion counts of -37 
for CB-03-01 cream and -23 for vehicle cream (standard sample 
size was calculated to be 172 subjects per treatment group. 
Based on those assumptions, at least 350 subjects in each treatment group (CB-
03-01 cream, I% BID and vehicle BID) will be included into each Phase 3 
study to provide sufficient power (90%) with the chosen primary endpoints. 
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. 
Summary tables (descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables) will be 
provided for baseline variables, efficacy variables, and safety variables. 
Continuous variables will be described by descriptive statistics (n, mean, 
standard deviation, CV%, minimum, median, and maximum). Frequency 
counts and percentage of subjects within each category are provided for 
categorical data. Summaries will be provided for each treatment group. 
Study Sets: 
The Safety set will include all subjects who received at least one application of 
the test article. The intent-to-treat (ITT) set will include all randomized 
subjects. The per-protocol (PP) set will be a subset of the ITT set and will 
include subjects who completed the study without any significant protocol 
deviations. The analysis of safety will be conducted on the Safety set. The 
analysis of efficacy will be conducted on both the ITT and PP sets, with the 
ITT set considered as the primary set for statistical analysis. Multiple 
imputation will be used to impute missing values for the primary endpoints and 
absolute change in total lesions count (S I) in the ITT analyses. Sensitivity

CONFIDENTIAL analyses will be performed to investigate the robustness of the results obtained 
on the ITT set for the primary endpoints (change from Baseline in non-
inflammatory and inflammatory lesion counts and IGA "success" at Week 12). 
Missing values for the other secondary endpoints (i.e., S2-S4: percent change 
in lesions counts) will be calculated using the values obtained from the 
multiple imputation of the primary efficacy endpoints and secondary efficacy 
endpoint #1 (Sl). 
Efficacy Analyses: 
Primarv Efficacv Analvsis 
Hypothesis tests on the primary endpoints will be conducted in hierarchical 
order for P 1 through P3. 
Pl: A logistic regression model with treatment and analysis center as fixed 
effects will be used to compare the proportion of subjects achieving "success" 
in each treatment group at Week 12, where "success" is defined as an IGA 
score of"clear (score=O)" or "almost clear (score=l)" AND at least a 
improvement in IGA compared to Baseline. 
P2: An analysis of covariance (ANCOV A) will be used to compare the 
absolute change from Baseline in non-inflammatory lesion counts in each 
treatment group at Week 12, with treatment and analysis center as fixed effects 
and the Baseline non-inflammatory lesion count as the covariate. 
P3: An ANCOV A will be used to compare the absolute change from Baseline 
in inflammatory lesion counts in each treatment group at Week 12, with 
treatment and analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline inflammatory 
lesion count as the covariate. 
Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
Hypothesis tests on the secondary endpoints will be conducted in hierarchical 
order for S I through S4. 
Sl: An ANCOV A will be used to compare the absolute change from Baseline 
in total lesion counts in each treatment group at Week 12, with treatment and 
analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline total lesion count as the 
covariate. 
S2: An AN COY A will be used to compare the percent change from Baseline 
in total lesion counts in each treatment group at Week 12, with treatment and 
analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline total lesion count as the 
covariate. 
S3: An ANCOV A will be used to compare the percent change from Baseline 
in non-inflammatory lesion counts in each treatment group at Week 12, with 
treatment and analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline non-
inflammatory lesion count as the covariate. 
S4: An ANCOV A will be used to compare the percent change from Baseline 
in inflammatory lesion counts in each treatment group at Week 12, with 
treatment and analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline inflammatory 
lesion count as the covariate.

CONFIDENTIAL Treatment Compliance and Extent of Exposure Analyses: 
Treatment Compliance 
Compliance to the test article will be evaluated at each visit and overall 
according to the following formula: 
Number of actual applications 100 x Number of scheduled applications 
Non-compliance will be defined as a compliance value less than 80%. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize test article compliance at each 
visit and overall for the ITT and PP sets. The proportion of compliant and non-
compliant subjects will be summarized by table of frequencies at each visit and 
overall for the ITT and PP sets. Subjects with an overall compliance not 
evaluable (due to missing data) or less than 80% will be excluded from the PP 
set. 
Extent of Exposure 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize exposure to test article for the 
ITT, PP, and Safety sets. The total amount oftest article used (grams applied) 
will be calculated for each subject from the weights of the returned test articles. 
The mean daily amount of test article applied (total amount of test article 
used/number of days of treatment) will be calculated for each subject. 
Safety Analyses: 
Local Skin Reactions CLSRsi 
LSRs (telangiectasia, skin atrophy, striae rubrae, erythema, edema, 
scaling/dryness, stinging/burning, and pruritus) will be summarized by the 
frequency of each individual LSR by treatment group and severity at each visit. 
Adverse Events (AEs) 
Pre-treatment AEs (PTAEs) and Treatment Emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be 
coded using the MedDRA coding dictionary. TEAEs will be summarized by 
treatment group and overall. The number and proportion of subjects with any 
TEAE and the number of TEAEs will be tabulated by MedDRA system organ 
class (SOC) and preferred term (PT), seriousness, relationship to test article, 
and severity. 
Electrocardiograms (ECGs) 
ECGs will be evaluated for any material change during the study period. 
Results (normal/borderline/abnormal) of the ECG and descriptive statistics will 
be provided by treatment group at each visit for heart rate, RR duration, PR 
duration, QRS duration, QT duration including Bazett's and Fridericia's 
corrections, and P axis for the Safety set. Changes in overall interpretation 
(normal/abnormal/borderline) of the ECG from Baseline to Week 12 will be 
examined using shift tables.

Product Name: Cortexolone !?a-Propionate (CB-03-01) Protocol: CB-03-01/26 
Sponsor Name: Cassiopea S.p.A. Protocol Date: June II, 2015 
1. BACKGROUND 
CB-03-01 (cortexolone !?a-propionate) is a steroidal antiandrogen that is being 
developed as a I% cream for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris, an androgen-
dependent skin disorder. CB-03-01 binds to the human androgen receptor displacing the 
androgenic hormones and acts as an androgen antagonist. In human plasma, CB-03-01 is 
rapidly metabolized to parent cortexolone so that its systemic bioavailability after topical 
application is anticipated to be low. Cortexolone, the main by-product, is a physiological 
component of the pool of endogenous corticosteroids, and is an intermediate in the 
synthesis of glucocorticoids, but it only exhibits weak glucocorticoid properties [I]. 
In single-dose studies in mouse and in rat, and following repeated subcutaneous 
administration in rats, and dermal administration in rabbits and minipigs, the drug was 
well tolerated with no significant local or unexpected systemic effects. CB-03-0 I is not 
mutagenic in the Ames test or in the human chromosome aberration test, and it is not a 
skin sensitizer. 
To date, four Phase I and three Phase 2 clinical studies have been completed with CB-03-
01 cream in Europe and the United States, with over 500 subjects exposed to CB-03-01 
creams. All studies were conducted using CB-03-01 cream, 1%; additional concentrations 
of CB-03-01 cream (0.1% and 0.5%) were also used in the most-recent Phase 2 Dose-
Escalating study. The studies included: 
I. A Phase I Single Dose Pharmacokinetics (PK) Study in 24 healthy volunteers 
[randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, single-ascending dose], 
2. A Phase I Repeat Dose PK Study in 24 healthy volunteers [randomized, vehicle-
controlled, 14-day repeat-dose], 
3. A Phase I Steady State PK Study in 8 subjects with acne vulgaris [single center, 
open-label, pilot, 6-week repeat-dose] 
4. A Phase I Three-week Cumulative Skin Irritation Study in 36 healthy volunteers, 
5. A Phase 2 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis (HPA)/PK study in 42 subjects 
with acne vulgaris [open-label, 14-day repeat-dose] 
6. A Phase 2 Comparator Proof of Concept Study in 72 adult subjects with facial 
acne [randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, active-comparator 
(Retin-A [tretinoin] 0.05% cream), 8-week repeat-dose], and 
7. A Phase 2 Dose-Escalating Study in 363 subjects with facial acne vulgaris [multi-
center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle controlled, 12-week repeat-dose] 
Overall, the data that resulted from the completion of the aforementioned studies has 
demonstrated that CB-03-01 creams selected for clinical development (a) are well 
tolerated locally, (b) result in minimal systemic exposure when applied topically, (c) have 
a clinical safety profile without any concern and similar to the placebo, and (d) at I%

concentration applied BID are significantly more effective than its vehicle at reducing 
inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions counts in adolescent and adult subjects. 
CB-03-0 I could offer advantages over existing products for acne vulgaris due to its 
potential efficacy and lack of systemic antiandrogen activity. Because its 
pharmacological action appears to be limited to the local site of application, use of CB-
03-0 I may be able to mitigate the side effects related to systemic exposure to hormonal 
agents currently used in the treatment of acne. 
2. RATIONALE 
The concentration ofCB-03-01 selected for the initial clinical studies(!%) was based on 
antiandrogenic activity in the hamster flank organ test in which the best effective 
concentration was 0.8% [!]. The results of the Phase 2 Dose Escalation Study 
demonstrated that CB-03-0 I cream, I% applied BID had more favorable results than 
other treatments (0.1% BID, 0.5% BID, and I% QD) and no material safety issues were 
noted with any of the concentrations of CB-03-01 cream [2]. Based on the collective 
findings of the previous Phase I and Phase 2 studies, CB-03-01 cream, 1% BID appears 
to be the best treatment candidate to advance for further clinical study and development 
as a topical treatment for acne vulgaris. Thus, the present Phase 3 study has been 
designed to determine and compare the efficacy of treatment with CB-03-01 cream, I% 
and the vehicle cream applied twice daily for 12 weeks in subjects with moderate to 
severe facial acne vulgaris. 
3. OBJECTIVE 
The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of CB-03-0 I 
cream, I% versus the vehicle cream applied twice daily for 12 weeks in subjects with 
facial acne vulgaris. 
4. STUDY DESIGN 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group 
comparison study of safety and efficacy for CB-03-01 cream, I% in male and female 
subjects, 9 years or older with moderate to severe acne vulgaris on the face. Eligible 
subjects must have acne vulgaris of the face (which can include the nose) with an 
Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 3 or 4, at least 30 to a maximum of 75 
inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodules), and at least 30 to a maximum of 
100 non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones). At least 700 subjects will be 
enrolled at approximately 40 sites. Subjects will be randomized in a I: I ratio to one of 
two treatment groups: 
I. CB-03-01 (cortexolone 17a-propionate) cream, 1% 
2. Vehicle cream

Evaluate the Safety of Cortexolone !?a-Propionate (CB-03-01) Cream, 1% Applied 
Twice Daily for up to 12 Months in Subjects with Facial Acne Vulgaris). In this open 
label study, all subjects will apply the active medication (cortexolone !?a-propionate 
cream, 1%) twice daily for up to 9 additional months of treatment (for a total of up to 12 
months; 0 or 3 months in the pivotal Phase 3 trial and an additional 9 months in the open-
labellong-term extension study).

6.2 Instructions for Use and Application 
At the first visit, the subjects will be instructed to wash their entire face (the area to be 
treated) with mild soap and water and then dry the area gently. The study staff will then 
instruct the subject and parent/guardian (if applicable) on how to dispense the cream, how 
much of the test article to use, and where to apply the assigned test article. The first 
application of cream should be applied in the office at Visit I under supervision of the 
study staff after subject has been deemed eligible. Typically, about I gram of the cream 
will be dispensed onto a fingertip and applied to the face by dabbing small amounts 
gently on multiple regions of the face (e.g., forehead, nose, cheeks, chin). Using a 
fingertip, the cream will be spread to provide a thin, uniform layer of the cream over the 
entire face. 
Subjects and parents/guardians (if applicable) will be instructed to apply the cream to the 
whole face twice daily (morning and in the evening) for 12 weeks. The subject should 
ideally allow at least eight (8) hours between applications. All subjects should not wash 
the treated area for at least four (4) hours following test article application; and MUST 
NOT APPLY THE TEST ARTICLE WITHIN FOUR (4) HOURS PRIOR TO ANY 
STUDY VISIT. 
Subjects will be provided with a Subject Diary to record the dates and time of 
application. Subjects will be instructed to only apply the study cream to the face as 
instructed by the investigator or designated study personnel. Note: The dispensing, 
recording, and application of the test article by the subject may require adult 
supervision by the subject's parent/guardian. 
Subject and parent/guardian (if applicable) will also be provided with a Subject 
Instruction Sheet providing them with instructions on how to use and store the cream at 
home during the study period. 
Subject and parent/guardian (if applicable) will be instructed to bring all the containers of 
cream (used and unused) and their completed diaries to each visit. The study staff will 
weigh all the returned containers and will record the weights on the appropriate study 
medication accountability logs and case report forms (CRFs). 
Subjects who are not compliant with applying the creams as instructed (determined from 
subject diaries and/or the weight of test article used) may be discontinued from the study. 
6.3 Warnings, Precautions and Contraindications 
These test articles are for topical use only. Care should be taken to avoid contact with 
eyes and all mucous membranes. If contact with eyes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water. 
Subjects with a known sensitivity to any of the ingredients in the test articles should not 
participate in this study.

Should skin irritation or rash develop, subjects should discontinue use and contact the 
study site. 
In case of accidental ingestion, subjects should contact the investigator immediately. 
The effects of the test article in nursing mothers, pregnant women and their unborn 
children are unknown. WOCBP must not be pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the 
study period. 
7. RANDOMIZATION ASSIGNMENT 
Subjects who are eligible for enrollment into the study will be randomized to receive CB-
03-01 cream or vehicle cream in a 1:1 ratio. The randomization scheme will be blocked 
by investigational site. At each site, subject kits will be dispensed according to the kit 
number assigned by an IVRS/IWRS system as subjects are enrolled. At each site, the 
study staff will add the site number (provided to each site) and the subject number 
(starting with 001) to each kit label. The kit number dispensed to each subject will also be 
recorded on the source documents and CRFs. Treatment group designation will remain 
blinded until the final database is locked (unless unblinding is required as described in 
Section 15). Subjects who withdraw prematurely from the study will not be replaced. 
8. PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT THERAPIES 
Current medications and any medications taken in the 30 days prior to the start of the 
study (Screening, Visit l) will be recorded on the appropriate CRFs with the 
corresponding indication. The medications to be recorded include RX and OTC 
medications (except vitamins and dietary supplements not used to treat a medical 
condition). All medications taken on a regular basis should be recorded on this page prior 
to commencing the use of the test article. 
Therapies (medication and non-medication therapies) not restricted by the protocol may be 
used during the study for the treatment or prevention of disease or to maintain good health. 
Vitamins and mineral supplements are permitted at dosages considered by the investigator 
as reasonable for maintaining good health. Non-prohibited chronic therapies being used at 
Visit I may be continued. Any changes in concomitant therapies during the study must be 
recorded on the Concomitant Therapy Form. The reason for any change in concomitant 
therapies should be evaluated and, if appropriate, reported as, or in conjunction with, an 
adverse event. 
8.1 Prohibited Medications or Therapies 
Medications or therapies that are prohibited during the duration of the study are as 
follows:

Prior to entry into the study, subjects must not use the medications and/or procedures 
on the face as specified in Section 5 .1.2. 
During the study, subjects must not use the following products and/or procedures on the 
face: 
• Topical anti-acne treatments including, but not limited to, OTC acne cleansers or 
treatments, benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics, azelaic acid, sulfa based products, 
corticosteroids, and salicylic acid. 
• Retinoids including tazarotene, adapalene, and tretinoin. 
• Light treatments (including artificial tanning devices), microdermabrasion, or 
chemical peels. 
• Any other investigational drug or use of any investigational device 
• Systemic medications with potential anti-acne effects including: 
• Corticosteroids (including intramuscular and intralesional injections). Inhaled, 
intranasal, or ocular corticosteroids are allowed (see Section 8.2). 
• Antibiotics 
• Spironolactone 
• Retinoid therapy 
• The addition of hormonal contraception 
• Change to pre-existing hormonal contraception 
• Other systemic therapy, which may materially affect the subject's acne in the 
opinion of the investigator. 
Other chronic medications being used at the time of Baseline Visit can be continued at 
the discretion of the investigator. The reason for any changes in such concomitant 
therapies should be reported as, or in conjunction with, an AE. 
8.2 Allowed Medications or Therapies 
Subjects must be on a consistent skin care program (make-up, moisturizers, soap, 
sunscreen, etc. of their choice, exclusive ofRX/OTC acne cleansers) for at least one (I) 
month prior to enrollment. The subject's skin care regimen will be reviewed and 
approved prior to their randomization. This skin care program should not contain any 
OTC products with significant levels of anti-acne ingredients such as retinol or alpha-
hydroxy acids (i.e., lactic acid, glycol acid, etc. at greater than 5%). 
No additional medications, including OTC preparations, should be used without the 
knowledge and, if possible, permission of the investigator. Vitamins and mineral 
supplements are permitted at dosages considered by the investigator as reasonable for 
maintaining good health. The addition, discontinuation, or dose change of any 
concomitant medications will be documented in the source documents.

Medications will be permitted, at the discretion of the investigator, to treat local skin 
reactions, if applicable. 
Intranasal, inhaled, and ophthalmic steroids used for the management of allergies, 
pulmonary disorders, or other conditions exclusive of acne are NOT considered 
prohibited medications, but should be recorded on the Concomitant Medication Form. 
WOCBP taking per protocol allowed hormonal contraception therapy at enrollment 
must remain on the same treatment for the duration of the trial. 
Any changes in concomitant therapies during the study must be recorded on the CRFs. The 
reason for any changes in concomitant medications or therapies/procedures should be 
reported and should reflect either a baseline medical condition documented in the medical 
history of the CRF or an AE. 
9. STUDY PROCEDURES 
The study will consist of a Screening/Baseline Visit and three (3) scheduled visits. 
Specific activities for each study visit are listed below. 
9.1 Visit 1 (Day 1): Screening/Baseline 
Subjects can be screened for the study up to 45 days before Visit I. During screening, the 
study requirements will be reviewed, written informed consent/assent obtained, and 
eligibility confirmed. If applicable, the washout from prohibited medications or 
treatments will be determined and implemented. Subjects who require "washout" for 
longer than 45 days will be re-consented. 
At Screening, the investigator or designee will: 
• Obtain a signed, written informed consent (unless the subject signed a consent 
within the past 45 days). Note: a subject under 18 years of age must provide 
written informed assent and be accompanied by the parent or legal guardian at the 
time of assent/consent signing. The parent or legal guardian must provide 
informed consent for the subject. If a subject becomes 18 years of age during the 
study, the subject must provide written informed consent at that time to continue 
study participation. 
• Complete review and documentation of the subject's medical and dermatological 
history and demographic information. 
• Record any concomitant medications and therapies. 
• Confirm the subject meets the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
• Have subject complete washout from any prohibited medications, if necessary.

10. CLINICAL EVALUATIONS 
The following clinical evaluations will be performed according to the schedules indicated 
during the study. The same investigator should complete the evaluations for a given 
subject throughout the study. If this becomes impossible a sub-investigator with 
overlapping experience with the subject and the study should complete the evaluations. 
10.1 Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) 
At every study visit, overall severity of acne using a five-point scale from 0 = clear to 
4 = severe will be conducted at each visit. This is a static morphological scale that refers 
to a point in time and not a comparison to Baseline. Subjects must have an IGA score of 
3 (moderate) or 4 (severe) at Baseline. 
0 Clear Absence of active disease with no inflammatory or non-
inflammatory lesions. 
1 Almost Clear Rare non-inflammatory lesions with no more than one small 
inflammatory lesions. 
2 Mild Some non-inflammatory lesions with no more than a few 
inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules only; no nodular/cystic 
lesions). 
3 Moderate Up to many non-inflammatory lesions and may have some 
inflammatory lesions but no more than one nodular/cystic lesion. 
4 Severe Up to many non-inflammatory lesions and inflammatory lesions 
but no more than a few nodular/cystic lesions. 
10.2 Acne Lesion Counting 
The number of inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodules) and non-
inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) on the face vertically from the 
hairline to mandible rim and horizontally from ear to ear, including those on the nose will 
be counted to determine subject eligibility at Visit 1. Subjects must have at least 30 to a 
maximum of 75 inflammatory lesions and 30 to a maximum of 100 non-inflammatory 
lesions on the face (which can include the nose) at Baseline. 
Lesions are defined as follows: 
• Comedones- open (blackheads) and closed (whiteheads). 
• Papules- raised inflammatory lesions with no visible purulent material. 
• Pustules- raised inflammatory lesions with visible purulent material. 
• Nodules- Any circumscribed, inflammatory masses greater or equal to 5 mm in 
diameter with or without cystic changes.

10.3 Fitzpatrick Skin Type Assessment 
At Visit I, the investigator or designee will document the subject's skin phototype (I-VI) 
using the Fitzpatrick Skin Type Assessment as described below: 
FITZPATRICK SKIN TYPE 
Skin Typical Features Tanning ability Phototype 
I Pale white skin, blue/hazel eyes, Always burns, does not tan blond/red hair 
II Fair skin, blue eyes Burns easily, tans poorly 
III Darker white skin Tans after initial burn 
IV Light brown skin Burns minimally, tans easily 
v Brown skin Rarely bums, tans darkly easily 
VI Dark brown or black skin Never burns, always tans darkly 
10.4 Local Skin Reactions (LSRs) 
At every study visit, the investigator or designee will document the severity of the 
following LSRs known to be associated with application of topical steroids: 
• Telangiectasia 
• Skin atrophy 
• Striae rubrae 
A five-point ordinal scale will be used to assess the severity of these reactions (0 =none, 
I =trace, 2 =mild, 3 =moderate, and 4 = severe). 
In addition, the investigator or designee will evaluate the severity of the following LSRs 
known to be associated with acne vulgaris, using the five-point ordinal scales described 
below: 
• Erythema 
• Edema 
• Scaling/dryness 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 28 of 56 
Product Name: Cortexolone 17a-Propionate (CB-03-01) Protocol: CB-03-01126

Erythema: 
0 None 
1 Minimal -barely perceptible erythema 
2 Mild- predominantly minimal erythema (pink) in the treated area with or without 
a few isolated areas of more intense erythema 
3 Moderate -predominantly moderate erythema (red) in the treated area with or 
without a few isolated areas of intense erythema (bright red) 
4 Severe -predominantly intense erythema (bright red) in the treated area with or 
without a few isolated areas of very intense (fiery red) erythema 
Edema· 
0 None 
1 Minimal -scant, rare edema 
2 Mild -easily seen edema, minimally palpable, involving up to 113 of the 
Treatment Area 
3 Moderate -easily seen edema and typically palpable, involving between 113 to 
2/3 of the Treatment Area 
4 Severe -easily seen edema, indurated in some areas, involving over 2/3 of the 
Treatment Area

2 Mild -limited areas of fine desquamation in up to 1/3 of the treatment area 
3 Moderate- fine desquamation involving 113 to 2/3 of the treatment area or limited 
areas of coarser scaling 
4 Severe -coarser scaling involving more than 2/3 of the treatment area or limited 
areas of very coarse scaling 
In addition, subjects will be asked to rate the severity of the following LSRS that 
occurred in the treatment area since the last visit, using the four-point ordinal scales 
described below: 
• Stinging/burning 
• Pruritus 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 29 of 56 
Product Name: Cortexolone 17u-Propionate (CB-03-01) Protocol: CB-03-01126 
Sponsor Name: Cassiopea S.p.A. Protocol Date: June II, 2015 
Stinging/burning: 
0 None 
I Minimal, barely perceptible- tolerable and little discomfort 
2 Moderate- tolerable, but causes some discomfort 
3 Severe- very uncomfortable or intolerable 
Pruritus (itching)· 
0 None -no evidence of itching 
I Mild -only aware of itching at times, only present when relaxing, not present 
when focused on other activities 
2 Moderate -often aware of itching, annoying, sometimes disturbs sleep and daytime 
activities 
3 Severe -constant itching, distressing; frequent sleep disturbance, interferes with 
activities 
These LSRs will be collected independently of AEs. Only LSRs that require medical 
intervention (e.g., prescription medication) or require withholding the application of the 
test articles will be documented as AEs. Any LSRs that are not listed above will be 
recorded as AEs. 
11. PHOTOGRAPHY 
Photography documentation is required in this study. Photographs taken as part of this 
study will be used to document the effects of treatment, AEs, or other findings during the 
trial. Color photographs (both sides of the face and the front of the face) of the areas with 
acne lesions of all enrolled subjects will be performed at the Baseline Visit prior to 
application of the test articles and at Visits 2, 3, and 4. The study sites will be provided 
with suggested guidelines to assist them in taking standardized photographs. In addition, 
investigators at all study sites may take photos as they deem appropriate to document the 
clinical status of the subject (e.g., an AE, etc.). Photographs taken for this study are for 
informational purposes only and are not to assist in grading or for any other assessment. 
Note: Subjects may decline to have photographs taken during the conduct of the study. If 
a subject initially consents to photographs, then declines further photography, the 
Sponsor may use the photographs taken under consent for the purposes noted above.

12. LABORATORY TESTS 
12.1 Urine Pregnancy Tests (UPTs) 
The UPT will be performed at the study site if the site is registered and conforms to 
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations for such testing (site 
possesses at a minimum a current valid CLIA Certificate of Waiver) or at an 
appropriately registered reference laboratory. A UPT will be performed at every visit on 
all WOCBP (see Section 5.1.1 for definition). The investigator will report the UPT results 
on the CRFs, in the subject's medical records and, if applicable, in independent records 
maintained at the study site. The UPT used must have a minimum sensitivity of 25 miU 
of 13-HCG/mL of urine. 
13. END OF STUDY CRlTERlA 
At the end of each subject's participation in the study, the investigator will complete an 
End of Study form for all completed and discontinued subjects. 
13.1 Completion of the Study 
Each subject who completes the 12-week course of treatment as specified in this protocol 
will have completed the study. 
13.2 Subject Discontinuation 
A subject may be withdrawn from the study prior to completion for any of the following 
reasons: 
• Whenever the subject or the subject's parent/guardian decides it is in the subject's 
best interest to be withdrawn, Note: if the subject or parent/guardian decides to 
withdraw from the study due to an AE then it should be classified as withdrawal 
due to an AE. 
• Whenever the investigator decides it is in the subject's best interest to be 
withdrawn 
• AEs 
• Worsening of condition or treatment failure (in the opinion of the investigator) 
• Noncompliance 
• Pregnancy 
• Lost to follow-up 
• Sponsor administrative reasons 
If a subject withdraws prematurely during the 12-week treatment period for any reason, 
the Visit 4 procedures should be completed at that time. Subjects who withdraw 
prematurely will not be replaced. When a subject is withdrawn from the study for a 
treatment-related AE (i.e., possibly, probably or definitely related as defined in Section 
CONFIDENTIAL Page3lof56 
Product Name: Cortexolone 17a-Propionate (CB-03-01) Protocol: CB-03-01/26 
Sponsor Name: Cassiopea S.p.A. Protocol Date: June II, 2015 
14), when possible, the subject should be followed until resolution or stabilization of the 
AE. 
13.3 Study Termination 
The study may be terminated by the investigator or the Sponsor. If, in the opinion of the 
investigator, clinical observations made during the study suggest that it may be unwise to 
continue, he or she may stop the study. A study termination by the investigator will be 
reported to the Sponsor. 
In addition, a written statement fully documenting the reasons for this action will be 
submitted to the Sponsor by the investigator within five (5) working days. 
In the event that the Sponsor chooses to discontinue or terminate the study, appropriate 
notification will be given to the investigator. 
14. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a 
drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An AE can arise from any 
use of the drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with any drug) and from any route 
of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
Information on the medical condition of subjects should begin following the subject's 
written consent/assent to participate in the study and a medical history should be taken at 
screening. During any wash out and baseline periods, any changes in the health of 
subjects should be recorded as changes in medical history unless the event occurred as a 
result of a study-related procedure and is unanticipated, in such cases, the event should be 
recorded as an AE and reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) as an 
"unanticipated problem" in accordance with local procedures. Other changes in subject 
health information becomes AE data when the subject begins dosing with the test article 
and therefore AE data should be collected from the date of the first dose oftest article. 
These data are considered treatment-emergent AEs. 
Timely and complete reporting of all AEs assists CRO m identifying any untoward 
medical occurrence, thereby allowing: 
I) protection of the safety of study subjects; 
2) a greater understanding of the overall safety profile of the test article; 
3) recognition of dose-related test article toxicity; 
4) appropriate modification of study protocols; 
5) improvements in study design or procedures; and 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 32 of 56

Sponsor Name: Cassiopea S.p.A. Protocol Date: June ll, 2015 
6) adherence to worldwide regulatory requirements. 
Test article is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or vehicle/placebo 
being tested or used as a reference in the study, whether blinded or unblinded. AEs may 
be either spontaneously reported or elicited during questioning and examination of a 
subject. All AEs must be completely recorded on the AE CRF. If known, the investigator 
should report the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder, rather than its individual 
symptoms. Subjects experiencing AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of test 
article, or those experiencing AEs that are present at the end of their participation in the 
study should receive follow-up as appropriate. If possible, report the outcome of any AE 
that caused permanent discontinuation or that was present at the end of the study 
particularly if the AE is considered by the investigator to be treatment-related (i.e., 
definitely, probably, or possibly related to test article). 
14.1 Adverse Event (AE) 
All AEs must be recorded on the AE CRF. AEs should be followed to resolution or 
stabilization (if possible), and reported as serious adverse events (SAEs) if they become 
serious. 
LSRs that have been reported in subjects treated with CB-03-01 creams (0.1 %-1% 
concentration) include (with decreasing frequency) erythema, pruritus, scaling/dryness, 
skin atrophy, striae rubrae, stinging/burning, edema, and telangiectasia; however most 
LSRs were typically of minimal to mild severity. No subjects discontinued treatment due 
to these LSRs. 
AEs that have been reported in subjects treated with CB-03-01 creams (0.1-l% 
concentration) were minimal, typically mild in severity, and most were 
recovered/resolved without sequelae at the end of the study. Only two AEs in one (1) 
subject were judged as probably or possibly related to treatment; both of these treatment-
related AEs (burning and cold at application site) were mild in severity. Two SAEs have 
been reported to date; both were not related to treatment and were resolved at the end of 
the study. In addition, one subject discontinued early from the study due to an AE 
(urinary tract infection), which was not related to treatment. 
The investigator will instruct the subject to report any AEs that may occur during the 
study. At each visit, the investigator should ask the subject, in non-directive fashion, 
about any change in the subject's overall condition since the previous visit. 
The severity of each AE, as judged by the investigator, will be recorded on the 
appropriate AE CRF and will be graded according to the following scale: 
Mild -The AE is transient and easily tolerated by the subject. 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 33 of 56 
Product Name: Cortexolone !?a-Propionate (CB-03-01) Protocol: CB-03-01/26 
Sponsor Name: Cassiopea S.p.A. Protocol Date: June II, 2015 
Moderate -The AE causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's 
usual activities. 
Severe -The AE causes considerable interference with the subject's usual 
activities, and may be incapacitating or life-threatening. 
The investigator must determine the relationship of the AE to the test article according to 
the following categories: 
Definite -An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the test article; and that is confirmed by improvement on stopping or 
reducing the dosage, and reappearance of the event on repeated exposure (re-
challenge). 
Probable -An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the test article; and that is confirmed by improvement on stopping or 
reducing the dosage of the test article; and that is unlikely to have been caused by 
concurrent/underlying illness or other drugs, procedures, or other causes. 
Possible -An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the test article; but may have been caused by concurrent/underlying 
illness, other drug, procedure, or other causes. 
Unlikely -An event that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that does not follow a known or expected 
response pattern to the test article, or most likely was caused by 
concurrent/underlying illness, other drug, procedure, or other causes, because of 
their known effects. 
Not Related -An event almost certainly caused by concurrent/underlying illness, 
other drug, procedure, or other causes. 
The investigator should categorize the outcome of the AE according to the following 
categories: 
Fatal -Termination of life as a result of an AE. 
Not Recovered/Not Resolved -AE has not improved or the subject has not 
recuperated. 
Recovered/Resolved -AE has improved or the subject has recuperated. 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 34 of 56 
Product Name: Cortexolone 17u-Propionate (CB-03-01) Protocol: CB-03-01/26 
Sponsor Name: Cassiopea S.p.A. Protocol Date: June II, 2015 
Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae - subject recuperated but retained the 
pathological conditions resulting from the prior disease or injury. 
Recovering/Resolving -AE is improving or the subject is recuperating. 
Unknown -Not known, not observed, not recorded or subject refused. 
The investigator should report the action taken with the test article due to the AE 
according to the following categories: 
Dose Not Changed -An indication that a medication schedule was maintained. 
Dose Increased -An indication that a medication schedule was modified by 
addition; either by changing the frequency, strength or amount. 
Dose Reduced -An indication that a medication schedule was modified by 
subtraction, either by changing the frequency, strength or amount. 
Drug Interrupted -An indication that a medication schedule was modified by 
temporarily terminating a prescribed regimen of medication. 
Drug Withdrawn -An indication that a medication schedule was modified 
through termination of a prescribed regimen of medication. 
Not Applicable -Determination of a value is not relevant in the current context. 
Unknown- Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused. 
The investigator should report any other action taken due to the AE. 
An adverse reaction is any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the 
event. For the purposes of prescription drug labeling, the term adverse reaction means an 
undesirable effect, reasonably associated with the use of a drug that may occur as part of 
its pharmacological action or may be unpredictable in its occurrence. 
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the event. 
For the purposes of IND safety reporting, "reasonable possibility" means there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A suspected 
adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, 
which means any AE caused by a drug. 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 35 of 56 
Product Name: Cortexolone !?a-Propionate (CB-03-01) Protocol: CB-03-01/26 
Sponsor Name: Cassiopea S.p.A. Protocol Date: June II, 2015 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered "unexpected" if it is not listed in the 
investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; 
or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current 
application. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by 
virtue of greater severity) if the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic 
enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would 
be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the investigator brochure listed only 
cerebral vascular accidents. "Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or 
suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring 
with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, 
but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under 
investigation. 
14.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An event that is serious must be recorded on the AE CRF and on the CRO SAE Report 
Form, and requires expeditious handling to comply with regulatory requirements. 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the opinion of either 
the investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death. 
• Life-threatening event. 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions. 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• Is an important medical event- defined as a medical event(s) that may not result 
in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization but, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient/subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Events NOT considered to be SAEs are: 
• Hospitalizations for the treatment, which was elective or pre-planned, of a pre-
existing condition that did not worsen, and 
• Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis, for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of "serious" given above and not resulting in hospital admission.

Product Name: Cortexolone l7u-Propionate (CB-03-01) Protocol: CB-03-01/26 
Sponsor Name: Cassiopea S.p.A. Protocol Date: June 11, 2015 
AEs classified as "serious" by either the investigator or the Sponsor require expeditious 
handling and reporting to CRO to comply with regulatory requirements. All serious AEs, 
whether related or unrelated to test article, must be immediately reported by 
telephone to the Medical Monitor and, in the event that he/she is unavailable, to the 
Project Manager. Written notification of all SAEs should be sent to the Project Manager 
by email or confirmed facsimile transmission. These include those SAEs listed in the 
protocol or investigator brochure and must include an assessment of whether there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event. 
Study endpoints that are SAEs (e.g., all-cause mortality) must be reported in accordance 
with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the 
drug and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In this case, the investigator must 
immediately report the event to the Sponsor. In addition, such information should also be 
provided to the site's respective IRB per their governing guidelines for SAE reporting. 
If only limited information is initially available, follow-up reports are required. Should 
the investigator become aware of an SAE (regardless of its relationship to test article) that 
occurs within 30 days after stopping the test article, the SAE must be reported in 
accordance with procedures specified in this protocol. In the event of death, if an autopsy 
is performed, a copy of the report should be sent to Sponsor, if available. 
As required, CRO will notify participating investigators of all suspected adverse reactions 
that are serious and unexpected. This notification will be in the form of an IND safety 
report of potential serious risks as soon as possible but no later than 15 calendar days 
after the Sponsor determines that the information is "reportable" according to the criteria 
listed in 21 CFR Section 312.32. These are: 
i) Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, 
ii) Findings from other studies including epidemiological studies, pooled 
analyses, or other clinical studies that suggest a significant risk in humans 
exposed to the test articles, 
iii) Findings from animal or in vitro tests that suggest a significant risk to 
humans exposed to the test articles or reports of significant organ toxicity 
at or near the expected human exposure, and 
iv) Clinically important increases in the rate of occurrence of serious 
suspected adverse reactions. 
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the 
Investigator Brochure and immediately submit a copy of this information to the 
responsible IRB according to local regulations. The investigator and IRB will determine 
if the informed consent/assent requires revision. The investigator should also comply 
with the IRB procedures for reporting any other safety information. Where required, 
submission of safety updates by the investigator to Health Authorities should be handled 
according to local regulations.

14.3 Pregnancy 
WOCBP (see Section 5.1.1 for definition) must have a negative UPT prior to study 
enrollment and must use a highly effective method of birth control during the course of 
the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Prior to study enrollment, 
WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial 
participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. The subject 
and parent/guardian must sign an informed consent/assent form documenting this 
discussion. 
During the study, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact the investigator 
immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual 
period). 
WOCBP enrolling into the study must have a pregnancy test prior to study therapy, and 
monthly throughout the course of the study. The study therapy must be withheld until the 
results oflaboratory pregnancy testing are known, and a negative UPT must be confirmed 
to continue in the trial. If pregnancy is confirmed during screening, the subject must not 
receive test article and must not be enrolled in the study. 
If a subject or investigator suspects that a subject may be pregnant at any time during the 
study, the test article must be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing 
are available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not apply further test article and 
must be discontinued from the study. 
If following initiation of study treatment, it is subsequently discovered that a trial subject 
was pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of test article exposure, the 
investigator must immediately notify the Medical Monitor of this event, and record the 
pregnancy on the appropriate pregnancy surveillance form. The form will be sent to 
CRO. The investigator must notify the IRB of any pregnancy associated with the study 
therapy and keep careful source documentation of the event. 
Protocol-required procedures for those subjects that are discontinued from the study must 
be performed on the subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy (e.g., x-ray studies). 
Other appropriate pregnancy follow-up procedures should be considered if indicated, 
including counseling of the subject by the investigator and her managing physician or 
health care provider (e.g., obstetrician). In addition, the investigator must report to CRO, 
on the appropriate pregnancy surveillance form(s), any follow-up information regarding 
the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome. Although 
pregnancy itself is not an AE, any complications during pregnancy should be recorded as 
AEs (or SAEs, ifthey fulfill the SAE criteria). Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, 
or spontaneous should be reported as an SAE. Offspring should be followed for a 
minimum of eight weeks. Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a

subject exposed to the test article(s) should be recorded as an SAE and details 
documented in the pregnancy surveillance form. 
15. BLINDING/UNBLINDING 
Blinding is important for the integrity of this clinical drug trial. However, the blind may 
be broken in the event of a medical emergency in a subject, in which knowledge of the 
test article identity is critical to the subject's management. Before breaking the blind for a 
subject, the investigator should determine that the information is necessary (i.e., that it 
will alter the subject's immediate management). In many cases, particularly when the 
emergency is clearly not test article related, the problem may be effectively managed by 
assuming that the subject is receiving active product without the need for unblinding. The 
need to break the blind should first be discussed with the responsible Medical Monitor 
and the best method to do this will be determined. 
16. CLINICAL SUPPLIES 
16.1 Test Article Information 
Test articles will be packaged and labeled by the Sponsor or designee. Detailed 
information on the packaging/labeling, blinding/unblinding, storage and preparation, 
dispensing, accountability etc. is included in Appendix 3.

17. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
17.1 Study Endpoints 
17.1.1 Efficacy Endpoints 
Primary Endpoints (Hierarchical): 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 39 of 56 
Product Name: Cortexolone 17a-Propionate (CB-03-0l) Protocol: CB-03-01/26 
Sponsor Name: Cassiopea S.p.A. Protocol Date: June II, 2015 
o Pl: Proportion of subjects in each treatment group achieving "success" at Week 
12, with "success" defined as an IGA score of "clear (score=O)" or "almost clear 
(score=!)" AND at least a two-point reduction in IGA compared to Baseline. 
o P2: Absolute change from Baseline in non-inflammatory lesion counts in each 
treatment group at Week 12. 
o P3: Absolute change from Baseline in inflammatory lesion counts in each 
treatment group at Week 12. 
Secondary Endpoints (Hierarchical): 
o Sl: Absolute change from Baseline in total lesion counts (including inflammatory 
and non-inflammatory) in each treatment group at Week 12. 
o S2: Percent change from Baseline in total lesion counts (including inflammatory 
and non-inflammatory) in each treatment group at Week 12. 
o S3: Percent change from Baseline in non-inflammatory lesions count in each 
treatment group at Week 12. 
o S4: Percent change from Baseline in inflammatory lesions count in each treatment 
group at Week 12. 
17.1.2 Safety Endpoints 
o Local and systemic AEs at every visit (Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, and 12). 
o LSRs: telangiectasia, skin atrophy, striae rubrae, erythema, edema, 
scaling/dryness, stinging/burning, and pruritus scored by frequency and severity 
at every visit (Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, and 12). 
o UPTs in all WOCBP at every visit (Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, and 12). 
o Material changes from Baseline in ECGs at Week 12. 
17.2 Sample Size Calculations and Power Considerations 
Assumptions used for sample size calculation were estimated from Phase 2 Dose 
Escalation Study (171-7151-201) [2], using a subset of subjects with 30-75 inflammatory 
lesions and 30-100 non-inflammatory lesions at Baseline. Sample size calculations were 
performed on the basis of the formulas for testing superiority in terms of mean 
differences and odds ratio of Wang and Chow. 
All the hypothesis tests for the primary endpoints have to be performed at the same 
significance level a=0.05 two-sided and the failure to reject a null hypothesis will imply 
the failure of rejecting all of the subsequent null hypotheses. 
In order to keep the overall Type II error p=O.l for the whole study, the sample size for 
the three hypothesis tests on the primary endpoints will be calculated considering an 
individual Type II error P=0.033.

For an IGA success rate of(continuity corrected) 14.00% for CB-03-01 cream and 2.17% 
for vehicle cream (odds ratio=7), sample size was estimated to be 202 subjects per 
treatment group. 
For a mean absolute change from Baseline in non-inflammatory lesion counts of -22 for 
CB-03-0 I cream and -I for vehicle cream (standard deviation= 17), sample size was 
calculated to be 19 subjects per treatment group. 
For a mean absolute change from Baseline in inflammatory lesion counts of -14 for CB-
03-01 cream and -11 for vehicle cream (standard deviation=l7), sample size was 
calculated to be 334 subjects per treatment group. 
The hypothesis test for the secondary endpoints will be performed at the same 
significance level u=0.05 two-sided of the primary endpoints if and only if all the null 
hypotheses on the primary endpoints are rejected. 
For a mean absolute change from Baseline in total lesion counts of -35 for CB-03-0 I 
cream and -13 for vehicle cream (standard deviation=17), sample size was calculated to 
be 13 subjects per treatment group. 
For a mean percent change from Baseline in total lesion counts of -35 for CB-03-01 
cream and -14 for vehicle cream (standard deviation=40), sample size was calculated to 
be 77 subjects per treatment group. 
For a mean percent change from Baseline in non-inflammatory lesion counts of -33 for 
CB-03-0 I cream and -5 for vehicle cream (standard deviation=40), sample size was 
calculated to be 43 subjects per treatment group. 
For a mean percent change from Baseline in inflammatory lesion counts of -37 for CB-
03-01 cream and -23 for vehicle cream (standard deviation=40), sample size was 
calculated to be 172 subjects per treatment group. 
Based on those assumptions, at least 350 subjects in each treatment group (CB-03-01 
cream, I% BID and vehicle BID) will be included in each Phase 3 study to provide 
sufficient power (90%) with the chosen primary endpoints. 
17.3 Statistical Methods 
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. 
Summary tables (descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables) will be provided for 
baseline variables, efficacy variables, and safety variables. Continuous variables will be 
described by descriptive statistics (n. mean, standard deviation, CV%, minimum, median, 
and maximum). Frequency counts and percentage of subjects within each category are 
provided for categorical data. Summaries will be provided for each treatment group.

The Safety set will include all subjects who received at least one application of the test 
article. The ITT set will include all randomized subjects. The PP set will be a subset of 
the ITT set and will include subjects who completed the study without any significant 
protocol deviations. The analysis of safety will be conducted on the Safety set. The 
analysis of efficacy will be conducted on both the ITT and PP sets, with the ITT set 
considered as the primary set for statistical analysis. Multiple imputation will be used to 
impute missing values for the primary endpoints and absolute change in total lesions 
count (S I) in the ITT analyses. Sensitivity analyses will be performed to investigate the 
robustness of the results obtained on the ITT set for the primary endpoints (change from 
Baseline in non-inflammatory and inflammatory lesion counts and IGA "success" at 
Week 12). Missing values for the other secondary endpoints (i.e., S2-S4: percent change 
in lesions counts) will be calculated using the values obtained from the multiple 
imputation of the primary efficacy endpoints and secondary efficacy endpoint #I (SI). 
17.3.1 Efficacy Analyses 
17.3.1.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
Hypothesis tests on the primary endpoints will be conducted in hierarchical order for PI 
through P3. 
Pl: A logistic regression model with treatment and analysis center as fixed effects will be 
used to compare the proportion of subjects achieving "success" in each treatment group 
at Week 12, where "success" is defined as an IGA score of "clear" (score=O) or "almost 
clear" (score= I) AND at least a two-point improvement in IGA compared to Baseline. 
P2: An analysis of covariance (AN COY A) will be used to compare the absolute change 
from Baseline in non-inflammatory lesion count in each treatment group at Week 12, 
with treatment and analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline non-inflammatory 
lesion count as the covariate. 
P3: An ANCOVA will be used to compare the absolute change from Baseline in 
inflammatory lesion count in each treatment group at Week 12, with treatment and 
analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline inflammatory lesion count as the 
covariate. 
17.3.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
Hypothesis tests on the secondary endpoints will be conducted in hierarchical order for 
Sl through S4.

Sl: An ANCOVA will be used to compare the absolute change from Baseline in total 
lesion counts in each treatment group at Week 12, with treatment and analysis center as 
fixed effects and the Baseline total lesion count as the covariate. 
S2: An ANCOV A will be used to compare the percent change from Baseline in total 
lesion counts in each treatment group at Week 12, with treatment and analysis center as 
fixed effects and the Baseline total lesion count as the covariate. 
S3: An ANCOV A will be used to compare the percent change from Baseline in non-
inflammatory lesion counts in each treatment group at Week 12, with treatment and 
analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline non-inflammatory lesion count as the 
covariate. 
S4: An ANCOV A will be used to compare the percent change from Baseline in 
inflammatory lesion counts in each treatment group at Week 12, with treatment and 
analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline inflammatory lesion count as the 
covariate. 
17 .3.1.3 Imputation of Missing Data 
Missing values for the primary endpoint in the ITT analyses will be imputed by 
o Multiple imputation using missing at random assumption; 
o Missing at worst value (for the entire set); 
o Worst case; 
o Last observation carried forward; and 
o Baseline observation carried forward. 
17 .3.1.4 Sensitivity Analyses 
Sensitivity analyses will be performed to investigate the robustness of the results obtained 
on the ITT set for the primary endpoints. The first sensitivity analysis will be the Per 
Protocol analysis. Four additional sensitivity analyses will be performed using different 
methods of imputation on the ITT set. On a per-subject basis, missing values for the 
primary endpoints will be imputed with the 
I) Worst value (for the entire set); 
2) Worst case; 
3) Last observation carried forward; and 
4) Baseline observation carried forward. 
17.3.1.5 Multicenter Studies 
Each center will conduct the clinical study under a common protocol. Consistency in 
study execution at each center will be emphasized. The study is to be conducted in such a 
manner as to have a minimum of eight ITT subjects enrolled in each of the treatment 
groups at each center (i.e., 16 ITT subjects enrolled overall per study center). In the event 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 43 of 56

that there are too few subjects in a treatment arm for a center, then this center's data will 
be combined with another center's data in order to achieve the desired minimum number 
of subjects per treatment arm. The combining of data across centers will be accomplished 
by combining data from two or more centers based on geographical and climatic 
similarities until the minimum number of subjects per treatment arm is achieved. The 
sequence of combination will be based on the total number of subjects enrolled in each 
center (combining the lowest with second lowest and so on). Combining center data to 
achieve sufficient subjects per treatment arm will result in combined centers. These 
combined centers, as well as individual centers with sufficient subjects per treatment arm, 
will be referred to as "analysis centers" in the statistical analysis. 
17 .3.!.6 Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity 
All the hypothesis tests for the primary endpoints have to be performed at the same 
significance level u=0.05 two-sided and the failure to reject a null hypothesis will imply 
the failure of rejecting of all the subsequent null hypotheses. This approach inflates the 
overall type II error p, which in the worst case scenario is equal to the sum of the Type II 
error p connected with the individual hypothesis tests. 
The hypothesis test for the secondary endpoints will be performed at the same 
significance level u=0.05 two-sided of the primary endpoints if and only if all the null 
hypotheses on the primary endpoints are rejected. 
17.3.!.7 Subgroup Analyses 
No subgroup analyses are planned. 
17.3.2 Treatment Compliance and Extent of Exposure Analyses 
17.3.2.1 Treatment Compliance 
Compliance to the test article will be evaluated at each visit and overall according to the 
following formula: 
Number of actual applications 100 X . . Number of scheduled applrcatwns 
Non-compliance will be defined as a compliance value less than 80%. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize test article compliance at each visit and 
overall for the ITT and PP sets. The proportion of compliant and non-compliant subjects 
will be summarized by table of frequencies at each visit and overall for the ITT and PP 
sets. Subjects with an overall compliance not evaluable (due to missing data) or less than 
80% will be excluded from the PP set.

17 .3.2.2 Extent of Exposure 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize exposure to test article for the ITT, PP 
and Safety sets. The total amount of test article used (grams applied) will be calculated 
for each subject from the weights of the returned test articles. The mean daily amount of 
test article applied (total amount of test article used/number of days of treatment) will be 
calculated for each subject and summarized by treatment using descriptive statistics. 
17.3.3 Safety Analyses 
17.3.3.1 Local Skin Reactions (LSRs) 
LSRs (telangiectasia, skin atrophy, striae rubrae, erythema, edema, scaling/dryness, 
stinging/burning, and pruritus) will be summarized by the frequency of each individual 
LSR by treatment group and severity at each visit. 
17.3.3.2 Adverse Events (AEs) 
Pre-treatment AEs (PTAEs) and Treatment Emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be coded using 
the MedORA coding dictionary. TEAEs will be summarized by treatment group and 
overall. The number and proportion of subjects with any TEAE and the number of 
TEAEs will be tabulated by MedORA SOC and PT, seriousness, relationship to test 
article, and severity. 
17.3.3.3 Electrocardiograms (ECGs) 
ECGs will be evaluated for any material change during the study period. Results 
(normal/borderline/abnormal) of the ECG and descriptive statistics will be provided by 
treatment group at each visit for heart rate, RR duration, PR duration, QRS duration, QT 
duration including Bazett's and Fridericia's corrections, and P axis for the Safety set. 
Changes in overall interpretation (normal/abnormal/borderline) of the ECG from 
Baseline to Week 12 will be examined using shift tables. 
17.3.3.4 VitalSigns 
Vital signs will be listed and summarized by treatment group. Descriptive statistics 
(mean, standard deviation, CV%, minimum, median, and maximum) will be presented. 
17.3.3.5 Urine Pregnancy Tests 
The results of UPTs monthly at Visit I (Baseline), Visit 2 (Week 4), Visit 3 (Week 8), 
and Visit 4 (Week 12 I end of treatment), or if the subject withdraws prematurely, will be 
listed.

assigned a subject number and provided with sufficient test article in standard packaging 
for the designated treatment period during the trial. 
Subject Boxes and Labels 
The randomization scheme will be blocked by investigational site. The box label will, at a 
minimum, contain the following information: protocol number, subject identifiers 
(subject number), the contents, an investigational test article disclaimer (e.g for US., 
Caution: New Drug Limited by United States law to investigational use), and the 
appropriate storage conditions for the test article. 
Subject Kits and Labels 
Each Subject Kit label will, at a minimum, contain the following information: protocol 
number, subject identifiers (subject number and subject initials to be filled in), the 
contents, the kit number, an investigational test article disclaimer (e.g. for US, Caution: 
New Drug Limited by United States law to investigational use), and the appropriate 
storage conditions for the test article. In the event of an emergency, the contents of the kit 
can be unblinded using the proper procedures as outlined in the protocol and by 
instructions provided to the site. 
Kits will be dispensed at Baseline, Visit 2 (Week 4), and Visit 3 (Week 8). Subjects 
should not have more than one (I) kit at any time. When the kits are dispensed to 
subjects, the Subject Kit label should be completed entirely with the necessary 
information recorded in the Study Medication Accountability Log at the investigative 
site. 
Tube Labels 
Each tube will contain, at a minimum, the following information: the protocol number, 
subject identifiers (subject number), the contents, the tube number (with test article batch 
number and retest date), an investigational test article disclaimer (e.g. for US, Caution: 
New Drug Limited by United States law to investigational use), and the appropriate 
storage conditions for the test article.

A 3.2 Dispensing Test Article Protocol: CB-03-01/26 
Protocol Date: June II, 2015 
Sites will receive shipments of one or more blocks of test articles. Subjects who are 
eligible for enrollment into the study will be assigned a three digit subject number by the 
study staff in ascending order beginning with the lowest available number. 
The test article must be dispensed only to study subjects and only at study sites specified 
on the form FDA 1572 by authorized personnel as required by applicable regulations and 
guidelines. 
On dispensing the test article for the first time on Day I, provide each subject with 
sufficient test article for the designated treatment period and record the information on 
the Study Medication Accountability Log. Each tube contains approximately 30 grams of 
test article and should last for approximately two weeks. 
The subject will also be instructed to bring all the tubes (used and unused) to each clinic 
visit. When a subject returns each used tube oftest article, record the date of return, and 
initials of the individual accepting the return for each tube of test article on the same line 
of the Study Medication Accountability Log as the dispensing information. 
At Visit 2 and Visit 3 (Week 4 and Week 8), visually check the tubes of test article to 
determine if the subject has applied correctly the test article and, if necessary, review the 
application instructions with the subject. Any discrepancies or concerns with the subject 
regarding the use of the diary to record test article compliance should be addressed. 
At Visits 2, 3, and 4 (Weeks 4, 8 and 12), record the weights of all returned tubes to the 
nearest tenth gram (0.1 gram). At each visit, all tubes should be collected and additional 
tubes dispensed to the subject to ensure each subject has sufficient test article for the 
designated treatment period. Make every effort to obtain the return of all dispensed tubes 
of test article. If these efforts fail, make a detailed note of the reason for the failure in the 
source documents and on the Comments page of the CRFs. 
A 3.3 Test Article Supply Records at Study Sites 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that a current record of test article 
disposition is maintained. Records or logs must comply with applicable regulations and 
guidelines, and should include: 
• Amount received placed in storage area. 
• Amount currently in storage area. 
• Label lD number (subject kit number). 
• Dates and initials of the person responsible for each product inventory 
entry/movement. 
• Amount dispensed to and returned by each subject, including unique subject 
identifiers.

o Amount transferred to another area for dispensing or storage. 
o Non-study disposition (e.g., lost, wasted, broken). 
o Amount returned to Sponsor or third party (if applicable). 
o Amount destroyed at study site, if applicable. 
CRO will provide forms to facilitate inventory control if the staff at the study site does 
not have an established system that meets these requirements. 
A 3.4 Dose Modifications 
The subject should not modify the treatment regimen without consultation with the 
investigator. Subjects should be instructed to discontinue use if skin irritation or rash 
develops and to contact the study site. In the event that the investigator believes dose 
modification is necessary (e.g., problems with tolerance), the subject's care should be 
discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to making any dose modifications. All dose 
modifications must be reported on the appropriate CRF. 
A 3.5 Documentation of Application and Compliance 
The date and time of the first application of test article will be recorded on the 
appropriate CRF. A CRF will also be used to record any changes from the application 
specified in the protocol (e.g., missed applications, investigator directed reduction in 
application frequency, etc.). The date and time of the last application of the test article 
will be recorded on a CRF. 
A Subject Diary will be dispensed to subjects to record the dates and times of all 
application doses and to record any missed doses of the test article (Appendix 2). 
Subjects will be instructed to bring the diary with them to each study visit. 
A 3.6 Return and Destruction of Test Article Supplies 
Upon completion or termination of the study, all test article tubes must be accounted for 
and any missing tubes of test article must be explained on the completed Study 
Medication Accountability Log. All returned tubes will be weighed to the nearest tenth 
gram (O.lg) in order to document extent of subject exposure. Unless instructed otherwise 
by the Sponsor, the study site will keep the original Study Medication Accountability Log 
and copies of the CRF Label Pages containing the Subject Kit labels in the study file. A 
copy of the Study Medication Accountability Log and the CRF Label Pages with the 
original labels from the subject kits will be returned to the Sponsor. All tubes of test 
article will then either be a) returned to the study Sponsor orb) emptied and provided to a 
sponsor-identified third party vendor for appropriate destruction, according to applicable 
regulations with the provision of a certificate of destruction.

TitleAccepta bility and Effectiveness of a Novel Inte rnet Based Decision 
Support Aid Ba sed on the NCCN Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Pati ent 
Guidelines
Patient pop ulatio nNewly  diagnosed patients with NSCLC who have not yet  started on any 
therapy
Ration ale for StudyTo im prove the length and quality-of-life outcomes for people with non- 
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by enlisting and engaging patients in the 
dissemin ation of the NCCN guidelines.  This is a two-year software 
development and impl ementation project to develop and field-test a 
decision aid based on the NCCN patient  guidelines for NSCLC.  The 
study goal is to improve the treatment decision-support  process and 
experience for NSCLC patients in an academic medical center.
Primary Ob jectiveThe primary st udy outcomes will emerge from measurement  of changes 
in overall practice patterns after implementation of  the decision aid. Pre- 
and post-inter vention data will be used to determine the level of 
difference  before and after implementation of  the decision aid into the 
thoracic oncology clinics.  Six specific practice patterns will be queried in 
a binary (yes/no) manner:
1.  All stages: smoking cessatio n discuss ion reinforced with a 
specific follow up plan and/or medication/patch/psychotherapy or 
counseling;
2.  stag e IB, IIA, IIB  receiving surgery: adjuvant chemoth erapy given 
after surgery;
3.  stag e III receiving surgery: pathologic staging of mediastin al
nodal di sease prior to initiati on of therapies;
4.  stag e III not receiving surgery: pathologic staging of  mediastinal 
nodal disease prior to initiati on of therapies
5.  stag e III patients not receiving surgery: if concurrent
chemoth erap y and radiation are given upfront;
6.   stage IV : molecular testing for EGFR and ALK muta tions prior to 
initiation of systemic therapy.

Objec tivesSecond ary objectives are to:
1.  Determine ag reement between patient  and physician post- 
consultatio n reports of  treatments discussed and recommended, 
prognosis, and expected tolerance.
2.  Determine cor relatio ns between overall and lung cancer-specific 
quality of life and decision-support  preferences.
3.  Determine cor relatio ns between overall and lung cancer-specific
quality  of life and decisional conflict.
4.  Determine cor relatio ns between overall and lung cancer-specific 
quality of life and satis faction with decision.
5.  Determine cor relatio ns between decision-support  preferences
and decisional conflict and sati sfaction with decision.
6.   Determine  cor relations betw een decisional conflict  and 
satisfaction with decision.
Study D esignThis study involves the evaluation of  the decision support tool Patients 
with Power, previously used with breast cancer pati ents, in the non- 
small cell lung cancer patient  populatio n.
1. Charac ter ize physician and patient  populations and treatment 
decisions in the UCSF thoracic oncology practices.
2. Establish the  acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of a novel 
decision aid for decisions made about  treatment for NSCLC.
3. Cond uct an  evaluation of changes in NCCN-guided practice patterns 
before and after implementat ion of the decision aid, with respect to 6 
clinical scenario s:
All pati ents: if smoking cessation inte rvention is provided at initial 
visit;
Stage IB-IIB patients receiving surgery:  if adjuvant chemoth erapy 
is given after surgery;
Stage III patients receiving surgery:  if pathologic staging of 
mediastin al nodal disease is done prior to initiati on of therapies;
Stage III patients not receiving surgery: if pathologic staging of 
mediastin al nodal disease is done prior to initiati on of therapies;
Stage III patients  not receiving surgery: if concurrent 
chemoradi ation is given upfront;
Stage IV patients: if molecular testing is done prior to initiation of 
systemic therapy.
4. Collect dat a to facilitate the design of future larger-scale evaluations, 
including assessments of  physician-patient agreement and patients’ 
levels of decisional conflict  and satisfaction with decisions made as well 
as potential correlatio ns to patient-reported quality to life.

Duration of
Interve ntionThe pati ents will have access to the decision support tool indefinitely 
(lifetime) but collectio n of all study metrics will end at 12 months after 
the period of their first 2 initial consultatio ns for NSCLC.
Duration of Follow 
upQuest ionnaires will be completed at the time of  initial consultatio n, with 
no planned follow up;  PwP website-based metrics will be followed in 
aggregate for a maximum of  1 year.
Duration of studyTwenty fo ur months:
Month 1-8: (1) Analyze existing practice patterns focused on 6 decision 
nodes derived from the NCCN decision tree for NSCLC.  The study of 
practice patterns will be based on primarily on review of  medical records 
by a trained research coordinator under Dr.  Yom’s direction. (2) 
Programming of NSCLC decision aid unde r Dr. Yom’s direction , 
conducted with technical assistance as needed from PwP. The results 
will be reviewed by co-investi gators for accuracy and ease of use.
Month 8-20: Conduct prospective trial of the decision aid, collectin g data 
directly from patients over the course of their initial 2 consul tations.
Month 2 0-24: Completion of data collectio n and data  analysis activities.
Study InterventionThe inte ract ive PwP inte rface allows structured exploration of choices, 
sequencing, and timing of therapies. The aid thus enables the patient to 
discuss proposed treatments with the oncologist (rather than assumin g 
passive acceptance) . Furthermore,  the decision aid allows evolving 
display of the treatment  choices and timeline/calendar in a graphical, 
simplified format during the discussion (rather than assuming absorption 
and recall of details of a verbal communication).  We will collect pilot data 
related to the collaborative, patient-oriented approach facilitated  by this 
decision aid.
Study A ssessments A total of fiv e patient-reported instr uments will be used to score overall 
and lung cancer-specific quality of  life, decision-support preferences , 
decisional conflict, and sati sfaction with decision:
1.  Decisi on Support Preference Questionnaire (DMPQ)
2.  FACT-L
3.  
FACT/NCCN-Lung Symptom Index (NCCN-F ACT  FLSI-17)
4.  Decisi onal Conflict  Scale (DCS)
5.  Post-Co nsultation Questionnaire
6.  Sati sfaction with Health Care Decision (SWD)

Page 6 of 33Unique Aspects of 
this StudyThe deci sion aid in this study will be developed in collaboration with a 
technology startup, Patients  with Po wer (PwP).  PwP has developed an 
innovati ve web-based soft ware that displays patient-friendly content 
adapted from the NCCN guidelines. The inte ractive web inter face allows 
physicians or patients to input  an individual patient’s charact eristics and 
then,  drawing from the NCCN-guidelines-based decision trees, to design 
a patient-specific decision tree accompanied by a timeline tying 
anticipated procedures to specific dates.  At present, PwP has developed 
a proof of  concept only for breast cancer, but PwP has shared
proprie tary da ta with the Principal Investig ator establishing the feasibility 
of customizing the inter face for NSCLC-related content .

1.1     Ba
ckgrou nd on Inter vention
Many physic ians are reluct ant to disclose specific details to cancer patients, such as 
risks of treatment, prognosis and treatment alternatives.1-4  Communicatio n is 
complicate d by t he stigma and fear associate d with cancer,5 the complexity of the 
informati on,  and  uncertai nty  about  the  course  of  the  disease  and  benefits  of 
treatment .6,7 Discussions of treatment options are detailed and prolon ged, leading to 
informati on loss and misunderst andings. However, the literature shows that providing 
detailed informati on to patients has not been associated with adverse psychological 
sequelae and, in some studies,  it has contrib uted to decreased anxiety and increa sed 
treatment  adherence.
Most  edu catio nal interventions for cancer patients aim to help manage side effects, 
decrease anxiety, and increase compliance.8-13 Recently , decision aids have been 
developed, to help pati ents go beyond traditional educatio nal interventio ns by engaging 
them more directly  in the decision process.14 Major types of decision aids are interacti ve 
videos, personalized audiot apes, or booklets. In its systematic  review, the Cochrane 
Collaboration found t hat these interventions improved knowledge and encouraged more 
appropriate use of  surgical inte rventi ons.15
A few studies ha ve explored decision aids used jointly and interacti vely by physicians 
and patients during a consult ation. Whelan et al. found that a Decision  Board 
interventio n for breast  cancer patients was associated with increased knowledge and 
use of breast-conserving surgery.16-18 Siminoff et al. tested Adjuvant Online with early- 
stage  breast  cancer  pati ents  and  found  t hat  the  interventi on  group  was  more
knowledgeab le and less likely to  choose adjuvant therapy featuring very marginal 
benefit .19-21
This study w ill test an innovativ e, interacti ve decision aid designed to facilit ate patient 
and oncologist decision-support  as a team. Improved patient-physician communication 
is likely to yield  benefits in  knowledge, decision certainty, and sati sfaction.
1.2 P atients with Power  – An Inno vative Decis ion Aid to Visualize NCCCN 
Guidel ines
The decisi on aid in this study will be developed in collaborati on with a technology 
startup, Patients with Power (PwP). PwP has developed an innovativ e web-based 
software that displa ys content excerpt ed from the NCCN patient  guidelines. Th e 
interacti ve web interface allows physicians or patients to input an individual patient’s 
charact eristics and then,  drawing from the NCCN-guidelines-based decision trees, to 
design a patient-specific decision tree accompanied by a timeline tying anticip ated 
procedures to specific dates. At present,  PwP has developed a proof of concept only for 
breast  cancer, but PwP has shared proprieta ry data with the Principal Investigator 
establishing the feasibility of customizing the inte rface for NS CLC-related content.
Version dat e: 03 -15-2016 Protocol  CC#: 14655
Page 11 of 33The interacti ve  PwP interface allows struct ured exploration of choices, sequencing, and 
timing of therapies.  The aid thus enables the patient to discuss proposed treatments 
with the oncologist (rather than assuming passive accept ance). Furthermore,  the 
decision aid allows evolving displa y of the treatment  choices and timeline/calendar in a 
graphical, simplified f ormat during th e discussion (rather than assuming absorptio n and 
recall of details of a verbal communication). We will collect pilot data related to the 
collaborativ e, patient-oriente d approach facilitate d by this decision aid.
1.2.1  Patients’  Reac tions to PwP Proof of Co ncept
The Pw P prototype decision aid has met  with very positi ve responses in th e breast 
cancer community :
From a ne wly diagnosed patient: “[I[t is amazing. It seems that my surgeon is 
following the right course.  She has not talked about chemotherapy yet since the 
surgery comes first  and then pathology…. My surgeon is also interest ed in 
learning more about  this soft ware.”
From a 2-year s urvivor:  “[K]nowing th e NCCN guidelines as compared to what 
doctors are recommending is really valuable.”
From a 6- year survivor:  “I love the concept and the sleek, clean, bright design…. 
With your drop down lists, it was a snap to pick the correct  answers. Your site 
has the potential to be a great  source of informati on for hungry patients.  I would 
have loved to have had something like it  when I  went  through treatment.”
From a fr iend of a patient:  “She and I went  on[lin e] together. She is not tech 
savvy so I wasn't  sure how she would react.  I am a geek so it makes perfect 
sense to me. She really liked it and was able to navigate around with ease…. We 
especially liked the fact that informati on was available at decision points where 
choices would need to be made. That makes the journey a whole lot less 
confusing.”
From a cancer survivor and activ ist: “If this exist ed when I'd been diagnosed, it
would' ve been  the compass to help guide and map out  my journey.”
Startup te chnology companies often launch proto types in high-profile diseases such as 
breast  cancer. This  project  will extend the innovatio n to a more marginalized and 
underserved population in NSCLC. While extending the concept to NSCLC,  our project 
will preserve the core features of the decision aid, including the graphical visualizatio n 
of the guidelines, the ease of navigatio n in the user interface, t he personalizatio n 
enabled by the drop-down boxes,  and the ability to create,  modify, and review multiple 
scenarios (see Figure 1).

1.3     Rationale for the Propose d Study
This is a two -year career development  project to develop and field-t est a decision aid 
based on the NCCN patient guidelines fo r NSCLC.  The study goal is to improve the 
treatment  decision-support  process in NSC LC patients in an academic medical center. 
If successf ul, this decision aid will be disseminat ed more broadly to community settings.
This study w ill consist  of a development phase followed by an evaluatio n phase. After 
initial protot yping, refinement, coding, and implementa tion of the intervention, a study 
will  be  implemente d  using  a  pre/post  design  to  estimate  the  effect  size  of  the 
interventio n with respect  to disseminatin g NCCN-guided treatment  choices (primary 
outcome) and to generate preliminary data about  secondary outcomes.
Specificall y, this project will:
1. Chara cterize physician and pati ent populations and trea tment  decisions in the UCSF
thoracic oncology practices.
2. Esta
blish th e accept ability , feasibili ty, and effectiveness of a novel decision aid for 
decisions made about  treatment  for NS CLC.
Version dat e: 03 -15-2016 Protocol  CC#: 14655
Page 13 of 333. Conduct  an evaluati on of changes in NCCN-guided practice patterns before and after 
implementa tion of the decision aid, with respect  to 6 clinical scenarios:
1.  All  patients: i f smoking cessatio n interventi on is provided at initial visit;
2.  St age IB-IIB patients receiving surgery: if adjuvant chemotherapy is given 
after surgery;
3.  St age III pati ents receiving surgery: if pathologic sta ging of mediastinal nodal 
disease is done prior to initia tion of  therapies;
4.  St age III patients not receiving surgery: if pathologic sta ging of mediastinal 
nodal disease is done prior to  initiation of  therapies
5.  St age III pati ents not receiving surgery: if concurrent chemoradiation is given 
upfront;
6.  St age IV patients:  if molecular te sting is done prior to initiatio n of syst emic 
therapy.
4. Collect data to facilitate the design of future larger-scale evaluations, including 
assessments of physician-patie nt agreement and patients’ levels of decisional conflict 
and sati sfaction with  decisions made.
2        Objectives of t he Study
2.1     Prima ry
The pri mary st udy outco mes will emerge from measurement of changes in overall 
practice  patterns after implemen tation of the decision aid. Pre- and post-interventio n 
data will be used to determine the level of difference before and after implementa tion of 
the decision aid into the thoracic oncology clinics. Six specific practice patterns will be 
queried in a binary (yes/ no) manner:
1.  All  stages: s moking cessatio n discussion reinforced with  a specific followup plan 
and/or medication/patch/p sychot herapy or counseling;
2.  St age I B, IIA, IIB receiving surgery: adjuvant chemotherapy given after surgery;
3.  St age III receiving surgery: pathologic sta ging of mediastinal nodal disease prior 
to initiation of therapies;
4.  St age III not receiving surgery: pathologic staging of mediastinal nodal disease 
prior to  initiation of therapies
5.  St age III patients not receiving surgery: if concurrent chemoradiati on is given 
upfront
6.  St age IV: molecular testin g for EGFR and A LK mut ations prior to initi ation of 
systemic t herapy.
2.2     Secondary
Seco

5 Reporting and Docume ntation of Results
5.1 E valua tion of  PwP
1. Decision  Support  Prefere nce  Questi onnaire  (DMPQ ):       The  Decision 
Support  Preferenc e  Questi onnaire  (DMPQ)  is  a  brief  assessment  of 
patients’ preferred style in decision making with their physician. Patients 
check off the single statement  out of five that best describes their preferred 
level of shared decision making responsibili ty. The Decision  Support 
Preference Questionnaire (DMPQ)  will be completed once before the 
consult ation.
2. FAC T-L:    The FACT-L is a 44-item self-report instrument that measures 
multid imensi onal quality of life, focused on common concerns of lung cancer 
patients measured on a 5-point Likert  scale.  It includes domains of Physical 
Well Being, Emoti onal Well Being, Social Well Being, and Functional Well 
Being. Available in eight languages, it is currently being used in several 
Phase II and III lung cancer clinical trials  (Cella DF, Bonomi AE, Lloyd SR, 
Tulsky DS, Kaplan E, Bonomi P. Relia bility and validity of  the Functi onal 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT -L) quality of life instru ment. 
Lung Cancer. 1995 Jun;12(3):199-220). The FACT-L will be completed once 
before the consulta tion.
3. NCCN- Functional  Assessment  of Cancer Th erapy Lung Sy mptom Index-
17 (NFL SI-17): T he NCCN-FACT  FLSI-17 is a 17-item pati ent-reported 
questi onnaire that i ndexes the sympt oms most highly valued by physicians, 
nurses,  and patients with advanced-sta ge lung cancer.25  It employs a five- 
point  Likert scale and is scored from 0-68.  It includes three subscales, 
Disease-Relate d Subscale (DRS), Treatment Side  Effects  (TSE), and 
Functional Well-B eing (FWB).  A unique aspect of this instrument is t he
Version dat e: 03 -15-2016 Protocol  CC#: 14655
Page 19 of 33separat ion o f disease-related and treatment-related effect s. The NFLSI-17 
will be completed once before the consult ation.
4. Decisional  Conflict Scale: The Decisio nal Conflict Scale (DCS) is a scale 
designed   to   m easure   patients'   uncerta inty   in   making   healt h-related 
decisions, factors contrib uting to uncerta inty, and patients'  perceived 
effective decision-support. The DCS  has 16 items and uses a five-point 
Likert  scale.  The scale is especially designed to help provide information 
about the efficacy of decision aids.22 It has been used in a variety of cancer 
preventio n  and  tr eatment-related  settings.  The  DCS  will  be  completed
before an d after the consulta tion.
5. Post-Co nsultatio n Questionnaire:  The Post-Consultatio n Questionnaire will 
be comp leted by the patient and their oncologist once after the consulta tion. 
It includes the fo llowing components:
a. Treatm ent Recommendati ons and Decisions: Treatments  discussed, 
recommended, and chosen by the patient and their oncologist will be 
recorded. Options may include surgery,  radiation therapy, chemot herapy, 
targeted therapy, observation,  hospice,  no treatment,  or unresolved. The 
oncologist and patient will also be asked for an estimati on of the tolerance 
of the treatment.  This informati on will be obtained from the patient and 
oncologist immediately after the consulta tion.
b. Prognosis Estimat es:  Estimates of prognosis with no treatment  and with the 
recommended treatment  will be obtained from the patient and oncologist 
immediately after the consult ation.
c. Program Evaluatio n:  The patient will be asked to score the extent  to 
which this process increased their understa nding of their cancer treatment 
options and confidence in their oncologist immediat ely after the 
consulta tion.
6. Sati sfactio n  with  Health  Care  Decision  (SWD):  Although  the  DCS  will 
provide a  general measure of satisfaction with the medical encounter, it 
does not specifically query t he patient's  satisf action with the health  care 
decision itself. The Patient  Satisfaction with Health  Care Decision  (SWD) is 
a six-item scale with excellent reliability and good discriminate validity . The 
instrument  was  validate d  using  a  sample  of  postme nopausal  women
specifically  to e valuate the utility of patient decision aids.14 The strength of 
the SWD is that it measures satisfaction with the decision made regardless 
of how good or bad th e prognosis or health outcome might be f or the
individua l patie nt. The SWD will be completed once after t he consulta tion.

Page 20 of 337. Acceptabi lity: Th e PwP website  will be monit ored for usage during the 
consult a tion and aft erwards. Patients will be given an account to enable 
conti nuous,  unlimite d access f or the life of the grant.  Usage statist ics will be 
monitored only in aggregate terms, without reference to specific content 
accessed by individual pati ents. Repeat visiting to the website  will be 
quanti fied to establish evidence of acceptance on the part of pati ents. 
Physician accept ance will be judged by rates of partic ipation in using the 
decision aid during the consultati on process.
6        Statistic al Cons iderations and Ev aluation of Results
6.1     Study Endpoints
Prima
ry Endpoints:  The practice  pa ttern survey completed during the first 8 mont hs will 
provide the baseline data that will be compared to results  obtained after implementatio n 
of the decision aid.
Seconda ry En dpoints:  A total of five pati ent-report ed instruments will be used to score 
overall and lung cancer-specific quality of life, decision-support preferences, decisional 
conflict,  and sati sfaction with decision:

6.1.1  Study D esign
This study i nvolves the evaluatio n of the decision support tool Patients with Power, 
previously used with breast  cancer patients, in the non-small cell lung cancer patient 
population.
1. Chara cterize physician and pati ent populations and trea tment decisions in the UCSF
thoracic oncology practices.
2. Est
ablish th e accept ability , feasibili ty, and effectiveness of a novel decision aid for 
decisions made about  treatment  for NS CLC.
3. Conduct  an evaluati on of changes in NCCN-guided practice patterns before and after 
implementa tion of the decision aid, with respect  to 6 clinic al scenarios:
Version dat e: 03 -15-2016 Protocol  CC#: 14655
Page 21 of 33All patients: if s moking cessatio n interventi on is provided at initial visit;
Stage IB-IIB  pa tients receiving surgery:  if adjuvant chemotherapy is given after surgery; 
Stage III patients receiving surgery: if pathologic staging of mediastinal nodal disease is
done pri or to initiation of therapies;
Stage  III  patien ts  not  receiving  surgery:  if  pathologic  staging  of  mediastinal  nodal 
disease is done prior to initia tion of  therapies;
Stage III  pati ents not receiving surgery: if concurrent chemoradiati on is given upfront; 
Stage IV patient s: if molecular testin g is done prior to initiation of systemic therapy.
4. Collect data to facilitate the design of future larger-scale evaluations, including 
assessments of physician-patie nt agreement and patients’ levels of decisional conflict 
and satisfaction with decisions made as well as potenti al correlatio ns to patient-reported 
quality to life.
6.2     Determi nation of Sa mple S ize and Accrua l Rate
6.2.1  Sample Size  and Po wer Estim ate
We expe ct that the clinical volume of 30 patients/month  for 12 months will yield a 
potential enrollment pool of 360 patients. A nticipating a 30% decline, dropout, or 
ineligibili ty rate  at the time of potential enrollment,  then at least  250 patients should be 
evaluable. The sample size was determined based on the primary outcomes of changes 
in practice  patterns. For each disease stage, a test of at least  a 25% improvement using 
the decision aid compared with the pre-interventio n results  in the proportio n of patients 
satisfying t he stage-specific criterion listed above will be carried out (see Primary 
Endpoint for practice pattern metrics ). In addition, the enti re study sample will be 
evaluate d to test for a change in smoking cessati on plans. Patients will be included in 
up to 3 individual analyses. The maximum sample size for any one test is based upon 
assuming a null hypothesis of 50% in the pre-interventio n cohort. This estimate for the 
null hypot hesis will be modified using the results obtained prior to use of the decision 
aid (Mont hs 1-8). Based upon the one-sample binary exact test with power set at 90% 
and a 2-sided type I error of  0.017 (adjusted for up to 3 tests for all patients), 53 patients 
would be required for each test. The test would reflect the actual accrual by stage with 
the use of the decision aid. With a fixed type I error of 0.017, this means for any 
individual test that the sample size may differ from 53, and the null hypothesis may 
differ from 50% and result  in reduced power but will be at least 80%. For example,  if 
adjuvant chemot herapy is given after surgery to  40% of stage IB and II patients 
determined from the pre-interventio n assessment,  then a test to detect a 50% 
improvement to 60% will require 70 patients with 80% power and 88 patients with 91% 
power. Si milarly, if  60% of  patients satisfy the smoking cessatio n crit erion during th e
Version dat e: 03 -15-2016 Protocol  CC#: 14655
Page 22 of 33pre-interv entio n interval,  a 50% improvement will require 32 pati ents with 92% power, 
but a 15% improvement with 90% power requires 135 patients across all disease 
stages. It is therefore not antici pated that the comparisons will require more than the 
expect ed enrollment of 250 patient s.
6.2.2  Accru al estima tes
The total n umber of partic ipants  to be enrolled is 250.   The expected number of 
partic ipants  to be enrolled per quarter is 60-65
6.3     Analy ses P lans
6.3.1  Prima ry Analysis (or Analysis of Primary Endp oints)
The major f ocus of the trial analysis will be to determine if there is a statistically 
discerni ble effect for the decision aid in influencing practice patterns before and after 
implementa tion of the decision aid. The rates of NCCN adherence by stage will be an 
important  covariate .  The  current  sample  size  now  reflects  the  ability  to  detect  a 
moderate effect size for decision aid interactions with outcomes. More detailed analysis 
to correlate correlations between changes in practice patterns to other variables will be 
carried out with logistic  regression, with special modifications f or patient 
sociodemographic and clinica l characteristics (e.g ., nodes, tumor size, histology).
6.3.2  Secondary A nalysis (or Anal ysis of Seco ndary Endpo ints)
In additi on to  the primary analysis, additio nal analyses will be carried out to determine 
correlations between sociodemographic and clinical variables, similarity in physician 
and patient post-consulta tion  reports,  quality of  life  scores,  decision-support 
preferences, decisional conflict, and sati sfaction with  decision.
All  data  analy ses  will  be  conducte d  by  first  using  exploratory  data  techniques  to 
examine univariate and bivariate relationships for statistic al significance.  Multivariate 
models will be construct ed using statistical crit eria, plausibili ty of associations, the 
existence of a priori hypotheses, and proposed causal path ways.  Chi-square, non- 
parametric and log-linear techniques will be used for categorical or ordina l data, and t- 
tests, where appropriate , for conti nuous data.  Multivariate models will use the observed 
likelihood ratio statistic  as a statistical index of model fit. Observed effect  sizes and their 
precision (expressed as 95% confidence intervals) will be more important components 
of these analyses than the associat ed p-values.
7        Study Mana ge ment
7.1     Pre-s tudy Docum entation
This stud y will be conducte d in accordance with the ethical principles that have their 
origin in the Decla ration of Helsinki  as st ated in 21 CFR §312.120(c)(4); consist ent with 
GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements.
Version dat e: 03 -15-2016 Protocol  CC#: 14655
Page 23 of 33Before initiating this  trial, the Investi gator will have written and dated approval from the 
Institut ional Review Board for the protocol, writt en informed consent form,  subject 
recruit ment materials,  and any other written informati on to be provided to subjects 
before any protocol relate d procedures are perform ed on any subjects.
The Inv estigator must  comply with the applicable regulations in Tit le 21 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (21 CFR §50, §54,  and §312), GCP/ICH guidelines, and all 
applicable regulatory requirements.   The I RB must  comply with  the regulations in 21
CFR §56 an d applicable regulatory requirements.
7.2     Institu tional Revie w Board Appro val
The prot ocol,  the proposed informed consent form, and all forms of partic ipant 
informati on related to the study (e. g. advertise ments used to recruit  partic ipants)  will be 
reviewed and approved by the UCSF  CHR (UCSF Instit utional Review Board).  Prior to 
obtaining CHR approval, the protocol must  be approved by the Helen Diller Family 
Comprehensive Cancer Cent er Site Commit tee and by the Protocol Review Committ ee 
(PRC).  The initial protocol and all protocol amendments must  be approved by the IRB 
prior to  implementa tion.
7.3     Informed Con se nt
All participants must  be provided a consent form describing the study with sufficient 
informati on for each partic ipant to make an informed decision regarding their 
partic ipation.  Participants must  sign the CHR-approved informed consent fo rm prior to 
partic ipation in any st udy specific procedure.  The partic ipant must  receive a copy of the 
signed  and  dated  consent  document.    The  original  signed  copy  of  the  consent 
document must be reta ined in the medical record or research file.
7.4     Changes i n the Protocol
Once the p rotocol has been approved by the UCSF  CHR,  any changes to the protocol 
must  be documente d in the form of an amendment.  The amendment must be signed by 
the Investi gator and approved by PRC and th e CHR prior to  implementa tion.
If it becomes  nece ssary to alter the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to 
patients, an amendment may be implemente d prior to  CHR approval.   In this 
circumst ance, however, the Investigator must  then notify the CHR in writing  within five 
(5) working days after implementa tion.  The St udy Chair and the UCSF  study team will 
be responsible for updating any partic ipating sites.
7.5     Data Stora ge and Co nfidentiality
Patient con fidentia lity will be ensured at all times. Study results  will not be released to 
partic ipants.  Patient identi fiers will not be accessible to associated research scientists  or 
clinicians conductin g the research unless subsequently approved through the CHR.  De- 
identi fied clinical and laboratory informatio n may be shared with other investi gators at 
other instituti ons. There are currently no plans to contact patients to inform them about
Version dat e: 03 -15-2016 Protocol  CC#: 14655
Page 24 of 33any fin ding of the study.  Patient identi fiers will not be made available to any other 
hospitals, insurers,  or agencies. The results of studies emerging from this work may be 
published but individual patie nts will not be identifiable in these publicati ons.
7.6     Record Keeping and Record Retention
The Pri ncipal In vestigator is required to maintain adequate records.
The Prin cipal Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate 
case histories that record all observations and other data pertinent to the investi gation 
on each individual administ ered the interventio n in the investi gation.  Case histories 
include the case report forms and supportin g data (e.g., signed and dated consent 
forms and medical records,  such as progress notes of the physician, the individual's 
hospital chart (s), and the nurses'  notes.  The case history for each individual shall 
document that informed consent was obta ined prior to partic ipation in the study.
Study docum entation includes all CRFs,  data correcti on forms or queries, source 
documents,  Sponsor-In vestigator correspondence, monit oring logs/le tters, and 
regulatory documents  (e.g., protocol and amendments,  CHR correspondence and 
approval, signed pati ent consent forms).
Source  doc uments  include  all  recordings  of  observations  or  notations  of  clinical 
activities  and all reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of 
the clinic al research study.
In accord ance with FDA regulations, the investi gator shall ret ain records f or a period of
2 years follow ing the date a marketing applicatio n is approved for the drug for the 
indication for which it is being investi gated; or, if no applicatio n is to be filed or if the 
applicatio n is not approved for such indicati on, until 2 years after the investi gation is 
discontin ued and FDA  is not ified.
8        Protec tion of  Hum an Subj ects
8.1     Prote ction from Unnecessary Harm
Each clin ical site is responsible for protecting all subjects involved in human 
experimentatio n. This is accomplished through the CHR mechanism and the process of 
informed consent.  The CHR reviews all proposed studies involving human 
experimentatio n and ensures t hat the subject’s rights and welfare are protected and that 
the potential benefits and/or the importa nce of the knowledge to be gained outweigh the 
risks  to  the  individual.  The  CHR  also  reviews  the  informed  consent  document 
associated with each study in order to ensure that the consent document accurately and 
clearly communicates the nature of the research to be done and its associated risks and 
benefits.
Version dat e: 03 -15-2016 Protocol  CC#: 14655
Page 25 of 338.2     Prote ction of  Privacy
Patients wi ll be informed of the extent to which their confidenti al health informati on 
generate d  from  this  study  may  be  used  for  research  purposes.  Following  this 
discussion,  they will be asked to sign the HIPAA form and informed consent documents. 
The original signed document will become part of the patient’s medical records,  and 
each patient will receive a copy of the signed document.  The use and disclosure of 
protected health informati on will be limited to the individuals described in the informed 
consent document.

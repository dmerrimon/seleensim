  
V. 5,  The Passy Muir Swallowing Self Training Device to Enhance Recovery Post Stroke   
Consent to Participate in Research  
 
Identification of Investigators  
You are being asked to participate in a research study conducted by Dr. Christy Ludlow (Primary 
Investigato r) from James Madison University, Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders.  
You will likely be seen at the JMU -RMH Voice and Swallowing Services office at RMH during this study. 
The JMU -RMH Voice and Swallowing Services is a collaborative project  that includes both JMU and 
RMH. Dr. Ludlow is an inventor on the devices that will be tested as part of this research and could 
possibly benefit financially if the device becomes marketable.  
Dr. Ludlow receives her salary from James Madison University; The Passy Muir, Inc., reimburses 
James Madison University for a portion of her salary that is equivalent to the time she spends on research using funds received from the National Institutes of Health as  part of a small business 
innovative research grant.  
Purpose of the Study  
The purpose of this study is to learn whether or not using noninvasive and non- painful vibratory 
stimuli (like a cell phone) on the neck will change peoples’ swallowing. The findings of the study will contribute to our overall understanding of swallowing and could help people with swallowing disorders in the future, but the study does not provide a new treatment for you.  
Background  
Safe swallowing requires the ability to control when you swallow and to protect your airway.  A 
chronic swallowing disorder (dysphagia) can be life threatening, as it can place patients at risk for aspiration of liquids and/or solids into the trachea. Repeated aspiration of substances into the lungs can result in pneumonia. We want to see whether certain types  of vibratory stimuli might be used to help 
people to  swallow who have had a stroke and have a swallowing disorder.  
 
Study Population 
Up to 50 persons who have had at least one stroke and have a swallowing disorder.  
 
Inclusion Criteria  
You may be eligible for this research study if:  
• You are 20 years old or older  
• You are in stable medical condition 
• You have had at least one stroke  
• You have a swallowing disorder based on the review of an examination of your swallowing using 
videofluoroscopy .  If you have not had such an examination of your swallowing in the last year and 
have previously had a swallowing disorder after a stroke we can arrange for you to have another 
videofluoroscopy  that will be paid for by the research to assess your current swallowing stat us.  We can 
provide you with the results of this testing if you request it.  
• You will need to take a short pen and pencil test to assess your memory and cognitive skills to 
participate in the study.  We can provide you with the results of this testing if you request it.  
• We will be asking you some questions about your ability to eat food and swallow liquids.  This 
questionnaire will assess whether you are at risk of having food enter your airway during swallowing.  We can provide you with the results of this testing if you request it.  
Exclusion Criteria  
Exclusionary criteria by participant report:  
• History of past brain injury, epilepsy, or neurological disorders (excluding stroke)  
  
V. 5,  • Previous neck injury  
• Psychiatric problems  
• Speech problems  
• Dementia, agitation, or a decreased level of alertness   
• Diagnosis of progressive neurodegenerative disorders, such as dementia, Parkinson’s Disease, 
multiple sclerosis, peripheral neuropathy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  
 
Research Procedures  
Should you decide to participate in this research study, you will be asked to sign this consent form 
once all your questions have been answered to your satisfaction.  If you decide to participate in this 
study, you will be asked to participate in one or more studies (described below as  Experiments, 1,2, 3 
and 4) that we are conducting on different types of devices that we are assessing for future use with 
patients who have swallowing disorders.   
 To measure the effects of each vibrator, we will attach a small vibrator to the outside of  your throat 
with a band to hold it in place.  We will turn on a vibrator for different time periods such as 3 to 10 
seconds, and then turn it off for between 15 to - 40 seconds for up to 32 times.  This may occur for up to 
20 minutes at a time with short 2  minute rest period between testing different vibrators.  Thus, the total 
time for one condition may be just over 10 minutes. These sessions will test the following.  
 Experiment 1 : to identify an optimal speed of vibration 
  4 Vibrator Frequencies between 30 and 150 vibrations per second (30, 70, 110, and 150) and 
some combined vibrators will be tested in one session.   This will require one hour and may be divided 
between different testing times if it takes more than 1 hour of testing time.  
 Experiment 2 : to determine optimal pulsing rate  
   We will compare a pulsed vibrator and a continuous vibrator  using one of the vibrators from 
Experiment 1. This should require less than 30 minutes of testing at a time.  
 
Experiment 3 : to determine vibratory pressure settings and relationship with neck fat  
We will use a small balloon placed between the neck band and your neck to determine the effect of 
different pressure settings between the neckband and the neck  which might increase the effect of the 
vibration using one of the vibrators we used in Experiment 1.  We will also measure the thickness of the 
skin overlying your neck with a caliper that has 2 arms. This should require less than 30 minutes of 
testing at a time.  
 Experiment 4 : To determine optimal automatic cyc ling rate :  
We will compare different times of vibratory stimulation to see which duration is needed for you to 
initiate swallowing: between 3, 5, 7 and 9 seconds.  Each trial will be approximately 10 minutes, requiring about 1 hour of testing time.  
These experiments may be run on different days with you returning each day for three  or more  
different visits.  
For each experiment, we will attach a small non- invasive sensor to the outside of your neck with 
tape (about the size of a pea) to record when you swallow.  We will also wrap bands around your rib cage and abdomen to measure your breathing. In some experiments you may have a tube placed on 
your  tongue to record when you swallow.  
You will feel shaking to the throat when a vibrator is turned on, but this  will not be painful or 
uncomfortable.  There will be periods when the vibrator is on and when it is off. Your saliva maybe 
suctioned if necessary. The suctioning would be done by a licensed speech pathologist.   
  
V. 5,  We will also ask you to say the vowel “eee”  for about 10 seconds, two times with a vibrator turned 
on and two times without it turned on. This will tell us whether or not the vibration is reaching your voice 
box.  
Time Required  
Participation in this study will require approximately 3 hours total from consenting to and 
participating in the experiments. Some of the experiments may be combined, but we expect that to 
complete the entire groups of studies approximately 3-5 o ne hour visits will be required, but more can 
be scheduled as needed.   
Risks, In conveniences and Discomforts  
 We will be measuring the frequency that you swallow your saliva during some of these studies.  If 
you have difficulty swallowing you may find it difficult to swallow your saliva we may ask you to clear 
your throat and bring th e saliva to your mouth so that we can suction it for you.  We will test for 
increased saliva every 10 -12 minutes during the study.  If you normally have difficulty swallowing your 
saliva, please let us know and we will give you some advice on how to manag e this.  
 Many people who have swallowing problems are at a higher risk of developing pneumonia because 
of their swallowing problems. For that reason, while you are participating in this study we want you to 
take your temperature at the same time of day each day.  If your temperature is elevated from your 
normal levels by more than 2 degrees for 3 days straight you must call us so we can arrange for 
someone to see you in the next couple of days to see if you have a medical problem.   
 We will contact you within 2 days after each test session to see if you are doing well.  Please return 
our calls so that we can assure ourselves of your well being.  
 Vibrotactile Stimulation  
This is a non -invasive form of stimulation which carries no known risks. You will feel a vibration on 
your throat with the throat stimulator.  
 
Movement transducer device and Respitrace and video recording 
These are non- invasive and carry no known risks. The movement transducer device will be 
attached to the neck with tape which could cause brief skin irritation after removal. The Respitrace 
bands will be wrapped around your rib cage and abdomen during the experiment but should not cause any discomfort.
  A small tube will sit on the front part of your tongue  and will be held in place with tape 
at the chin/side of mouth.  This tape could cause brief skin irritation after removal.  A video recorder will 
record each session for later analysis and data verification. All records, including video recordings, will 
be kept for 2 years on an encrypted computer and the secure server and then destroyed.  
Benefits  
There are no direct benefits to you from participating in this research.  This is not a treatment study 
and you should continue any treatment or regimen that you are now following for management of your 
swallowing disorder. The results of this stimulation study will likely yield generalizable knowledge which 
might benefit others with dysphagia in the future.    
Confidentiality  
Your participation in this study is entirely confidential. All personally identifiable data will be kept in a 
locked and secure location that can only be accessed by authorized investigators. The results of this 
project will be coded in such a way that your identity will not be attached to the final form of this study. 
Your identity will be disassociated from your data and you will be assigned a participant number. The 
researchers retain the right to use and publish non- identifiable data. The overall results of this research 
  
V. 5,  may be presented at professional conferences. You may sign a release form to obtain your results from 
this study and to allow use of your non- identifiable data for educational purposes here at JMU.  
Compensation  
You will be compensated $20.00 for every visit to the JMU/RMH Voice and Swallow Service for 
experimental research sessions while participating in this research study . For those patients without 
transportation to allow them to travel to the Rockingham Memorial Hospital we can offer to reimburse your transportation costs.  
 
Participation & Withdrawal  
Your participation is entirely voluntary. You are free to choose not to participate. Should you choose 
to participate, you can withdraw at any time without it affecting your current treatment or access to care for your swallowing disorder. The investigator can remove you from the study at any time if continuation 
is not in your best medical interest or if you are unable to follow the study requirements.

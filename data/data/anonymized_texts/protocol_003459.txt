V. HYPOTHESIS  
In the ICU, spouses often find themselves in a stressful environment, expected to manage surrogate health 
decisions for their critically ill loved one. Evidence in the literature suggest higher stress levels experienced 
by spouses in the ICU environment, increase s their risk for Post Intensive Care Syndrome 
(PICS ).3,4,12,14,17,18,28,34,41 Reducing stress in the spouse during the ICU hospitalization may reduce the ir 
likelihood of PICS . We hypothesize that participant s who receive the Sensation Awareness Focus Training 
(SĀF-T) intervention will experience less P ICS than control participant s who do not receive the intervention.  
 
VI. SPECIFIC AIMS  
The primary  specific aim of the proposed project is to test the feasibility and determine effect size of the SĀF-T 
intervention on PICS, specifically  spouses of critically ill, mechanically ventilated patie nts. We will carefully 
examine the ability of participants to adequately perform SĀF-T and adhere to the study protocol. A secondary 
aim of this project is to explore if the effect of SĀF-T and sleep/rest are related. Findings from this feasibility 
study will be used to design a dissertation study with adequate power to test SĀF-T. 
 
VII. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Significance  
More than 5.7 million patients are admitted to intensive care units (ICU) each year in the United States.37 The 
technologically advanced ICU is an unfamiliar frightening environment to patients and their families.1 Critical 
Program Director/Principal Investigator : Cairns, Paula   
Pro00026246    Version: 1.4                              Date: 08/28/17       Page | 2  
 illness is a family crisis. There is strong evidence that family distress in response to critical illness does not 
disappear after ICU discharge.2,4,12,16 The Society of Critical Care Medicine36 has identified a cluster of 
complications that occur  in family members of ICU patient s as Post Intensive Care Syndrome -Family (PICS -
F). PICS  in family members of adult ICU survivors includes symptoms of ongoing anxiety, depression, and 
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Data suggest that 70% of family m embers have symptoms of anxiety and 
33% have symptoms of depression and PTSD, which can persist for ≥4 years.7,9,13,24 Moreover, symptoms of 
anxiety, depression, and PTSD are higher and persist longer in family members than in adult ICU survivors .11 
Becaus e PICS -F occurs with greater frequency in spouses and surrogate health decision -makers4,27,34 this study 
will focus on participant s whom are spouses of mechanically ventilated critically ill adults (typically sedated 
and unable to make their own health dec isions).  
 
To date, the focus of PICS -F research has been on description, detection, and prevalence of PICS -F. The 
approach in the proposed project focuses on prevention of PICS -F using an innovative rapid stress reduction 
intervention. The Rosenzweig Cent er for Rapid Recovery29 has recently developed an adaptation of their 
Accelerated Resolution Therapy (ART) for psychological trauma and depression, called Sensation Awareness 
Focused Training (SĀF-T), as an approach to rapidly eliminate negative biological sensations of stress. SĀF-T 
is designed to elicit a calming response; interrupt negative thoughts, negative feelings, and negative behaviors; 
and ultimately serve as a self -management stress reduction  method  for individuals. Lateral left -right (saccadic) 
eye movements are used to elicit an orienting response that activates an investigatory reflex in which first, an 
alert response occurs and then, a reflexive pause produces decreased arousal in the face  of no threat,5,30,32 which  
elicits a calming response that rapidly eliminates negative biological sensations of stress.  A reflexive pause is 
our immediate response of exploratory behavior , with more flexible and efficient cognitive processes , to 
respond in a state of heightened awareness.43 This response process is consistent with behavior of interpretation 
and reaction to challenge  in McEwen’s Allostasis Stress Theory.21 We expect the  SĀF-T intervention will  
enable spouses to better manage stress and reduce risk of PICS -F.  
 
Sleep deprivation has been self -reported as one of the top stressors of family members of ICU patients.25,26,40 
Sleep adequacy is defined as a combination of three factors: latency (the t ime it takes to fall asleep), efficiency 
([time spent sleeping ÷ total time in bed] × 100), and duration of sleep.22 According to the American Academy 
of Sleep Medicine31 for adequate sleep, persons should fall asleep within 15 minutes, stay asleep for at least 
85% of the time they are in bed, and have a total sleep time of no less than 7 hours. Reasons reported by family 
members for sleep deprivation include anxiety, tension, and fear.8 Sleep deprivation may play a role in the 
development of PICS -F.7,40 Although anxiety, tension, and fear are to be expected when a family member is 
critically ill, acknowledging these feelings and practicing relaxation techniques can reduce the impact that the 
feelings have on sleep.6 Therefore,  management of stress in spouse s throughout the daytime may also improve 
nighttime sleep/rest and further reduce risk of PICS -F.

IX. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
Research Design  
We will use a prospective, randomized, experimental design to accomplish the specific aims. Participant s 
(n=10 ) will be randomly assigned within 36 hours of the patient’ s ICU admission  and intubation  to one of two 
groups. The  intervention group will rec eive the SĀF-T intervention daily, over a 3 -day period (72  hours) or 
until discharge of the patient  from  the ICU, if discharged within 3 days. The control group will not receive the  
SĀF-T intervention . Usual  care for spouses of critically ill patients will continue for both groups .  
Sample. A feasibility sample size of 10 participant s will be randomly assigned  (using a blocked design)  to two 
groups (n=5 intervention group, n=5 control group). Eligibility  criteria:  spouses of patients intubated and 
Program Director/Principal Investigator : Cairns, Paula   
Pro00026246    Version: 1.4                              Date: 08/28/17       Page | 3  
 admitted within 36 hours to the adult ICUs are expected to remain in the ICU  at least 36 hours, and  spouse  is 
aged 18 years  or older , and is able to understand English . Exclusion criteria : anticipation by the clinical 
provider of imminent p atient death, spouse does not understand English , under the age of 18 years old, or is  
active ly being treated for  a PICS  condition ( anxiety, depression, PTSD ). 
Setting . Participant  recruitment, enrollment, and interventions w ill be conducted at Tampa General Hospital 
(TGH), a level I trauma center with 225 critical care beds. During past and current studies, we have established 
excellent research relationships at TGH, as both principal investigator (PI) Paula Cairns  and her US F faculty 
adviser /co-investigator  Dr. Cindy Munro are credentialed by TGH Office of Clinical Research.  
 
Methods  
Group Assignment. Randomized assignment will be used to determine the group (intervention or control) for 
participants. Each participant will have an equal chance of being assign ed to receiving the intervention . Usual 
care by the healthcare team will be provided to both groups (intervention and control). A randomized block 
design wil l be used for equal sample size in each group. Randomized group  assignment  will be generated at 
randomizer.org and  concealed inside opaque, sealed envelopes. Following signed consent, each participant will 
have an equal chance of receiving the intervention  with the opening of a sealed group assignment envelope.  
Descr iption of Intervention and Data Collection Procedures. Data collection will take approximately 30 
minutes at four time points: study enrollment,  study day 3 , study day 30, and study day 90, as shown in Table 1. 
The actiwatch will take approximately 30 seconds to place on the participant’s wrist at the time of study 
enrollment, which will collect continuous activity and light data over a 3 -day period (72 hours) or until 
discharge of the pa tient from the ICU, if discharged within 3 days . The SĀF-T intervention will take 
approximately 15 -20 minutes each day, over a 3 -day period (72 hours) or until discharge of the patient from the 
ICU, if discharged within 3 days . Descriptions of procedures f or each group are as follows.  
1) Intervention Group: The SĀF-T intervention includes coaching from SĀF-T trained research staff on 
awareness of biological sensations associated with events in the ICU that are perceived stressful. Research staff 
will sit ac ross from the participant and ask them to use their eyes to follow hand movements that will induce  
lateral left -right (saccadic) eye movemen ts and  elicit an orienting response that activates an investigatory reflex 
in which first, an alert response occurs  and then, a reflexive pause produces decreased arousal in the face of no 
threat.5,30,32  The SĀF-T intervention will be administered each day, by trained research staff, over 3 -days (72 
hours) or until discharge of the patient from the ICU, if discharged within 3 days. The emphasis on the SĀF-T 
intervention on days 2 & 3 will be practicing to independently use the technique as needed by the participant to 
self-manage stress. Participants will continue to receive usual care practices by care providers (orientation to 
ICU patient room and ICU waiting room, use of bathroom and shower in patient’s room, review of ICU visiting 
policy with contact information, optional guest food tray, and other onsite locations to acquire food  and 
beverages, clean towels,  warm b lankets, and resources for spiritual support ). 
2) Control Group: The control group will consist of usual care. There will be no SĀF-T intervention, but 
participants will continue to receive support by care providers, as part of usual care practices ( orient ation to ICU 
patient room and ICU waiting room, use of bathroom and shower in patient’s room, review of ICU visiting 
policy with contact information, optional guest food tray and other onsite locations to acquire food and 
beverages, clean towels, warm blan kets, and resources for spiritual support ), which may reduce their level of 
stress. Participants will remain in the study in the ICU over 3 -days (72 hours) or until discharge of the patient 
from the ICU, if discharged within 3 days .

PICS -F. The measures for symptoms of PICS -F conditions (anxiety, depression, and PTSD) are found in the 
literature associated with spouses of adult ICU survivors.  
 Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression . Anxiety is defined as worry or fear that does not go away and 
interferes with daily activities such as job performance, school work, and relationships.23 Depression is 
defined as experiencing signs and sym ptoms most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks.23 
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale42 will be used to measure anxiety and depression  at 
four time points: study day 1 (immediately prio r to first intervention),  study day 3 , and by telephone 
interview at study day 30 and study day 90. The HADs is  easy to administer and has been successfully 
used to measure symptoms of anxiety (7 questions) and depression (7 questions) in the general 
population and in family members of ICU pati ents.4 Scores for each subscale (anxiety and depression) 
range from 0 to 21 with scores categorized as follows: normal 0 –7, mild 8 –10, moderate 11 –14, and 
severe 15 –21. Although HADs was not designed to be a clinically diagnostic tool,  in the event anxiety 
or depression subscales fall within the severe score range (15 -21), the participant will be provided with a 
copy of their results and encouraged to follow up with their primary care provider for clinical 
evaluation.  
 Symptoms of PTSD.  Symptoms of PTSD will be quantified at four time points: study day 1, study day 
3, and by telephone interview at study day 30 and study day 90, using the  Impact of Event Scale ( IES), 
which  is the most commonly used instrument to measure symptoms of PTSD in PICS -F research.7 The 
IES has been widely used for many years and found reliable across a broad range of traumatic events.39 
The IES is not a tool for diagnosing PTSD, but instead detects  symptoms indicating a risk of PTSD. 
Each of the 15 items is scored on a 6 -point scale rated from 0 to 5; so that the total score can range from 
0 to 75.15 Higher scores indicate more severe post -traumatic stress symptoms . In the event the total IES 
score is > 30, indicating a high risk of PTSD, the participant will be provided with a copy of their results 
and encouraged to follow up with their primary care provider for clinical evaluation.  
Stress. Symptoms of s tress will be quantified at four  time points: study day 1 (immediately prior to f irst 
intervention) , study day 3 , and by telephone interview at study day 30 and study day 90, using Cohen’s 
Program Director/Principal Investigator : Cairns, Paula   
Pro00026246    Version: 1.4                              Date: 08/28/17       Page | 5  
 Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), which is a 10 -item measure with good psychometric properties that includes 
questions on how often in the previous month people view their lives as stressful and their ability to cope with 
stress. Response options range from never (0) to very often (4), with total scores on the scale ranging from 0 to 
40. 
Sleep/Rest . The gold stan dard for accurate sleep analysis is full polysomnography (PSG), but full PSG is not 
feasible. A wrist actiwatch (Actiwatch  Spectrum, Philips Respironics, Bend, OR) will be placed on the 
participant  during study enrollment  to measure activity and amb ient li ght levels  over a 3 -day period (72 hours).  
The actiwatch  is a small, lightweight, limb -worn activity -monitoring  device. Actigraphy is based on sleep 
algorithms . 
Behavior Function. The NIH Toolbox Emotion Battery44 testing will be used to measure behavioral function  at 
four time points: study day 1 (immediately prior to first intervention), study day 3 , and by telephone interview 
at study day 30 and study day 90. NIH Toolbox is a multidimensional set of brief measures assessing cognitive, 
emotional, motor, and sensory function from ages 3 -85, meeting the need for a standard set of measures that can 
be used as a “common currency” across diverse study designs and settings. By using multiple constructs of each 
domain, the NIH Toolbox monitors neurological and behavioral function over time, and measures the domain 
constructs across developmental stages. This facilitates the study of functional changes across the lifespan, 
including evaluating intervention and treatm ent effectiveness. The Principal Investigator attended the 3 -day 
inaugural training by NIH in Washington, D.C. on all domains in addition to the new 2 -day training at 
Northwestern University for the iPad application.  
Participant  Demographics. Participant  characteristics that may affect the development of PICS -F will be 
collected during admission to the study including age, race, e thnicity, sex , history of PICS -F conditions, level of 
education, and distance of hospital commute.  
Data Management. Data will  be downloaded into  research electronic data capture (REDCap ), a secure web 
application database, which will be accessed by a secure USF web connection with authentication and data 
logging . A unique identifier will be assigned to each participant by th e PI in the database to  conceal their 
identity on all research data . The data files will be backed up daily during the data entry  process and once a 
week during oth er tim es by the PI . All data files will be h oused on the university server, which is backed up 
every 24 hours and copies,  are stored off -site for additional security.  Access to the database will be password 
protected and limited to the investiga tors.

XI. DATA ANALYSIS  PLAN   
Data Analysis  
The defining parameter for feasibility is a minimum of two days participation in the study.  Descriptive statistics 
will be reported as means +/ - standard deviation for continuous variables and as frequencies and percentages for 
categorical v ariables.  We will pe rform  repeated measures models in order to compare symptoms of PICS -F 
conditions in the intervention and control groups. Specifically, the repeated outcome variables (symptoms of 
anxiety, depression, & PTSD) will be modeled using genera lized linear mixed effects models to account for 
within -participant  variations.35 Estimates of treatment effects (differences between intervention and control 
groups) will be summarized with odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals.  Our s ampl e size of 
10 participant s is reasonable for a  feasibility study  and perform a power analysis for sample size and effect size 
for the larger dissertation study to follow. A timeline for the feasibility study is provided  in Table 2.

XII.  DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
Since the project involves minimal risk and will be conducted at a single site, data and safety monitoring will be 
conducted by the study PI, Paula Cairns  and reviewed with USF faculty advisor/co -investigator Dr. Cindy 
Munro on a bi -weekly basis . The review of data and safety monitoring will include all study processes, protocol 
compliance with inclusion/exclusion crit eria, sex  and minority enrollment s, and  safety of participant s, including 
but not limited to review of adverse events.

XVI.  HUMAN PARTICIPANT S INSTRUCTIONS   
Recruitment and Informed Consent. The PI will make daily rounds to the adult ICUs and speak with the 
charge nurses regarding ava ilability of the spouse of patient s intubated and admitted within the last 36 hours , 
and are expected to stay in the ICU for at least 36 hours . The bedside nurse will  approach the potential 
participant to ask if they would like to be approached by the PI  with an invitation to enroll in the study. The 
potential participant will be provided with  an oral explanation of the nature of the study and study information 
in writing. The information will include all elements required for informed consent, and will include all 
pertinent contact information as well as information about withdrawal from the s tudy. Written consent will be 
obtained. If at any time the participant does not wish to continue to participate in the study, no additional 
interactions with the participant will take place, no follow -up data will be collected, and that participant's data 
forms will be destroyed. The study PI has extensive experience in obtaining consents from family members of 
critically ill adults. The PI will work closely with the staff of the Burn Center, Cardiac Care, Cardiothoracic 
Surgery, Medical, Medical Surgical, Neuro Science, Surgical Trauma, and Vascular Surgery ICUs, the nurse 
managers, and medical directors to ensure that all eligible spouses of patients have an equal opportunity for 
inclusion.  
Characteristics. Participant s will be recruited from spouses  of the inpatient population at TGH, which has 
1,080  licensed acute care beds served. Characteristics of inpatients at TGH are presented in Table 3.  Patients in 
the study units are representative of the hospital wide patient characteristics in relation to gender  and ethnic  
backgroun d.

Sources of Materials . Data will be obtained from the participant ’s verbal feedback, wrist actigraphy, and health 
assessment instruments. Data will includ e age, race, ethnicity, sex , marital status, history of PICS c onditions, 
level of education,  distance of hospital commute, Perceived Stress Scores, Hospital and Anxiety Scores, Impact 
Event Scores , and NIH Toolbox Emotion Battery Score . Each participant  will be assigned an  arbitrary study 
identification number  to conceal their identity , and no individually identifiable private information will be 
entered into the  study data base.  
 
Potential Risks . The risks of participation in the study are minimal. Risks include skin irritation from  the 
actiwatch, as well as apprehension  with the  Perceived Stress Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 
Impact Event Scale , and NIH Toolbox Emotion Battery  health assessments.  
 
There is no alternative therapy. However, participant s may elect not to participate and may withdraw from  the 
study at any time without affecting the care they or the patient receive s. 
 
Protections Against Risk . The SĀF-T intervention will be administered in the privacy of the ICU’s 
consultation room to avoid interfere nce with critical care procedures  for the patient . At al l times,  we will place 
the patien t’s need for medical treatment, and avoidance  with interference with treatment, foremost.  
 
The information obtained will be kept strictly confidential, prote cting the identity of participant s in all  reports or 
publications that may result fro m this research. Each participant  will be assigned an arbitrary code  number to 
conceal their identity on all research data , and all research data will be maintained in locked file  cabinets under 
the direct supervision of the PI  and USF faculty advisor . 
 
To ensure confidentiality, each participant will be assigned an arbitrary study identification number to conceal 
his or her  identity on all  research data. All hard copy research material (i.e., consent forms)  will be maintained  
in locked file cabinets, electronic data will be kept on password -protected  computers under the direct  
supervision of the PI  and USF faculty advisor . Study information obtained will be kept strictly confidential, 
protecting the identity  of participant s in all reports or publications that may result from this research. To ensure 
privacy, all interactions  with participant s will be conducted private ly in the ICU consultation room . 
 
To redu ce skin irritation , the actiwatch will not be placed  on skin  that is not intact or damaged in any way. The 
actiwatch  will be removed at the end of study day 3 (maximum of 72 hours)  or until discharge of the patient 
from the ICU, if discharged within 3 days .   
 
Prior to beginning the Perceived Stress Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Impact Event Scale , and 
NIH Toolbox Emotion Battery  assessment s, the participant  will be told if they feel ex cessively apprehensive

Pro00026246    Version: 1.4                              Date: 08/28/17       Page | 8  
 during the assessment , they may stop. There is no  alternative therapy. However, participant s may elect not to 
participate and may withdraw from the study at any  time without affecting the care they or the patient receive.  
 
Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Participant s and Others  
Participant s in the intervention group may ben efit from this study if PICS is reduced by the SĀF-T intervention. 
The results of this study holds promise to translate new knowledge into clinical decision -making about the 
management of critically ill patient’s family members  and ultimately improv e both family and patient 
outcomes.  
 
Inclusion of Women, Minorities,  and Children  
Inclusion of Women . TGH is a diverse clinical setting. Based on the patient characteristics of the study 
population in our  current study, females make up approximately 48% of  the population (about 3% less than the 
proportion of  women in Hillsborough County, FL, or the entire TGH hospital population). Our experiences 
during previous critical care studies show that  recruitment of females is similar to that in the admission 
popul ation. Therefore, it is anticipated that the  participant s selected for this study will be representative in 
gender of the population of patients in the TGH ICUs.  All women meeting inclusion criteria will be recruited. 
We will review the enrollment of women  at our bi -week ly data and safety  meetings to ensure that we are 
meeting our target enrollment.  
 
Inclusion of Minorities . TGH is also an ethnically and racially diverse clinical setting. Based on admission 
characteristics of  the study population in Table 3, minorities make up approximately 26% of the population. We 
expect that  recruitment of minorities will also mirror these demographics. Our experiences during previous 
critical care  studies show that recruitment of minorities is similar to that in the adm ission population. It is 
anticipated that  the participant s selected for this study will be representative in ethnic background and race of 
the population of  patients in the TGH ICUs. We intend to recruit minorities consistent with our accessible 
population. The PI  will pay special attention to the admission of ethnic minorities to the units. All  patients 
meeting inclusion criteria will be recruited. We will review the enrollment of racial and ethnic  minorities at our 
bi-week ly data and safety  review  meetings to ensure that we are meeting our target enrollment.  
 
Inclusion of Children . Children less than 18 years of age will not be included in  this study, because PICS 
conditions pr esent  differently in children and is dependent upon developmental level .  
 
Publication and Presentation Plans:  
The design  and method s of this feasibility study will be presented in a poster for Sigma Theta Tau International 
Honor Society for Nursing, Delta Beta Chapter -at-Large’s Research Day.  The results of this study are expected 
to add knew knowledge on the feasibility and practicali ty of providing interventions for family members of 
critically ill patients, during the early ICU admission period, as well as the feasibility of longitudinal follow -up 
measures with family members post hospital discharge and will be submitted as a manuscr ipt for publication.

General Statistical Met hods and Types of Analyses  
Sample Size  
At least  300 subjects (100 each  for the two active arms, and 50 each for the two saline 
solution  arms) will be randomly assigned to study treatment such that approximately 
90 evaluable participants per active arm and 45 per saline solution  arm complete the 
study , assuming a 10% dropout rate . 
Primary Efficacy Analyses:  
The primary evaluation of efficacy of the active arms will be against a combined 
control arm (with BID and QID saline solution ). Sensitivity analysis ma y be 
undertaken for dosing -regimen matching control (that is, QID active vs. QID saline 
solution ). 
The primary analysis will be performed to compare the week 8 difference in the 
change from baseline in CFS between the active NOV03 groups and the saline 
solution  groups . The comparison will be conducted using a repeated measures model 
with treatment, site , visit, and treatment by visit interaction  fixed categorical factors, 
baseline as a continuous covariate, and using an unstructured covariance matrix. To 
establish evidence of efficacy in this proof of concept study, the hypothesis tests will 
be one-sided and performed at the 0.05 significance level.

Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. Frequen cies and 
percentages of subjects with treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious 
TEAEs, and TEAEs causing premature discontinuation will be provided by treatment 
group. An AE is treatment emergent if it occurs or worsens after the patient signed 
Informed Consent Form  (ICF) . Furthermore, frequencies will be given of subjects with 
TEAEs by system organ class ; by system organ class and preferred term ; by system 
organ class, preferred term and maximal severity ; by system organ class, preferred term 
and strongest relationship ; and by system organ class, preferred term, maximal severity, 
and strongest relationship. Separate summaries will be performed for ocular and non -
ocular A Es. 
Pharmacokinetics  
Whole b lood for perfluorohexyloctane  blood  concentration m easurements will be 
drawn from a minimum of 66 subjects at least at one investigational site with the goal 
of having samples from 20 subjects per treatment arm. Blood concentrations of 
perfluorohexyloctane  will be summarized descriptively. If possible, the  following PK 
parameters will be estimated: AUC 0-, Cmax, tmax and summarized descriptively .

 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Dry Eye Disease  (DED)  
Dry Eye Disease (DED) is defined by the International Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS) as a  
multifactorial disease of the ocular su rface characterized by a loss of homeostasis of the 
tear film, and accompanied by ocular symptoms, in which tear film instability and 
hyperosmolarity, ocular surface inflammation and damage, and neurosensory 
abnor malities play etiological roles .2 Estimates of the prevalence of dry eye vary 
considerably, depending on the crite ria used to define the disease , but i n the United States 
(US), it has been estimated that as many as 3.2 million women and 1.7 million men o ver 
the age of 50 have DED , with a projected 40% increase in  the number of patients affected 
by 2030 .4,5,6 With the aging  population in the US and other countries of the developed 
world, and with increasing computer use, DED  is expected to continue to become more 
prevalent and finding a treatment is becoming more important .1  
1.2 Prod uct Rational e 
NOV03 is a sterile ophthalmic eye drop  formulation , developed for the treatment of the 
signs and symptoms of DED associated with  meibomian gland dysfunction  (MGD ). 
It is a one component product consisting of  perfluorohexyloctane develope d to 
supplement  the lipid layer leading to reduced evaporation of the tear film and thereby 
protecting the ocular surface. As a single component product,  it is free of excipients like 
oils, surfactants and preservatives. NOV03  is developed with the goal to  provide patients 
with DED due to MGD a n effective treatment option with a new mode of action addressing 
directly the lipid layer. Further a dvantages compared to existing therapies including 
convenient handling, improved tolerability, and a decrease in the  visual disturbance 
associated with oily eye drops, emulsions or ointments.  
The sole ingredient of NOV03 is the anhydrous semifluorinated alkane, 
perfluorohexyloctane  
. Liquid 
semifluorinated alkanes are physically, physiologically and chemically inert, colorless, 
laser stable compounds with the same refractory index as water. They do not undergo 
metabolism i n the human body.3 Perfluorohexyloctane sh ows a low surface tension of 19. 65 
mNm, which leads  to excellent spreading activities on the ocular surface and to the 
formation of small droplet. On the ocular surface , NOV03 forms a thin film together with 
tear lipids thereby supporting the lipid layer , which in its natural function to reduce the 
evaporation of the tear film  and reducing sharing forces.  
1.3 Trial Rational e 
NOV03 might be valuable for patients with DED due t o MGD, as the loss of the lipid layer 
in these patients leads to increased evaporation of the tears. Initial clinical data from 
observational studies NT -0017 and NT -0028 consistently  indicate that NOV03 is efficacious 
in treating signs and symptoms of mild to moderate evaporative DED and mild to moderate

 DED and MGD. A mechanistic clinical study NT -004 demonstrated that NOV03 increase 
tear film thickness (TFT) and lipi d layer thickness (LLT) over saline solution, and therefore 
provides further clinical evidence supportive for this indication.  
This first US study is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety in a larger population  
versus a control in a double masked  fashion. It is powered to demonstrate efficacy for a 
sign endpoint total CSF (NEI grad ing). Other sign and symptom endpoints will be explored 
as well as the dosing regimen.  
Data from this study will serve to plan the phase 3 program for the project.  
1.4 Summ ary of Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human 
Subjects  
The active and only ingredient  of NOV03 , perfluorohexyloctane, is a semifluorinated 
alkane with a well -established tolerability and safety profile . Perfluorohexyloctane  has been 
on the market  as a medical device in the European Union for more than 10 years in 
ophthalmology, approved as a temporary  endo tamponade  and an intraoperative instrument 
for retinal surgery. It is not yet approved in the US. Physical properties such as  low surface 
and in terface tension, colorlessness and notably complete physical and chemical inertness 
make this substance class suitable for the topical ophthalmic application.  
A total of 151 subjects have been treated with NovaTears® (NOVALIQ GmbH, Heidelberg, 
Germany) in four post -marketing studies, with a treatment duration between 4 and 12 
weeks.  
Safety and local tolerability of NovaTears® during these four post marketing studies was 
found to be excellent when used at the recommended dose of one drop per eye, 4 times a 
day. In all four studies, no changes in intraocular pressure ( IOP) or best-corrected visual 
acuity ( BCVA ) was observed, nor were clinically significant findings with slit lamp 
examinations. Out of a total of 151 patients across  four post market studies, 27 AEs were 
reported from 17 subjects treated with NovaTears®, 12 of which were considered possibly, 
probably or definitely related to the use of NovaTears®. All cases reported to be related 
described symptoms of mild to moderate ocular irritation , which disa ppeared shortly after 
discontinuation of the product. No serious adverse events ( SAEs ), incidents or deaths 
occurred.  
Furthermore, market vigilance data collected to date from >1 million bottles dispatched in 
the market confirms the good safety profile,  with only 64 medical complains as of 30 June 
2017. The  vast majority of these medical complaints were  mild cases  of ocular irritations.  
The observational studies consistently indicate that NOV03 is efficacious in treating signs 
and symptoms of mild to modera te evaporative DED and mild to moderate DED caused by 
MGD.  A statistically significant increase in tear film fluid was observed in study NT -001, 
while tear film stability, as assessed by TFBUT , was shown to significantly improve in both 
the NT -001 and NT -002 studies. Comparable to these results, a significant decrease in the 
average OSDI© score was also observed in studies NT -001 and NT -002 together with 
decreases in the intensity of corneal staining (and conjunctival staining in NT -002). No

 change was obse rved for any of these parameters  in NT -003 in patients with DED due to 
GvHD. Study NT -004 demonstrated that NovaTears® increase TFT and LLT over saline 
solution, and therefore provides further clinical evidence supportive of the mode of action 
of NovaTears®.  
In summary, b ased on the preclinical and clinical data obtained to date , risks to subj ects in 
the planned NVU -002 study are considered very low. Furthermore, the subjects randomized 
in the study will be closely monitored, and current standard ophthalmo logical safety 
assessments will be performed during the entire treatment  period in the study at 2, 4 and 8 
weeks. The efficacy demonstrated to date is supportive of increased benefits in addressing 
the evaporative aspects of DED by strengthening the lipid layer, and suggests relief of DED 
symptoms and signs, that is possibly more sustainable than comparator saline treatments. 
NOV03 therefore provides a favorable risk -benefit treatment profile to patients with m ild 
to moderate DED and the NVU -002 study is designed to further assess this positive profile .

2.2 Overall Study Design and Investigational Plan  
This study is a  phase 2, m ulti-center, randomized, double -masked, saline -controlled study 
to evaluate  the effec t of NOV03 ( perfluorohexyloctane ) at two different dosing 
regimens on signs and symptoms of Dry Eye Disease.  Approximately 300 male and female 
subject s of at leas t 18 years of age with a subject -reported history of DED  in both eyes and 
who meet  all ot her study eligibility criteria will be randomized , stratified by site,  2:2:1:1  to 
receive 1 of 4 treatment s: 
Treatment 1: NOV03 (  Perfluorohexyloctane), 4 times daily (QID)  
Treatment 2: NOV03 ( Perfluorohexyloctane), 2 times daily (BID)  
Treatment 3 : Saline  (0.9% sodium chloride solution), QID  
Treatment 4: Saline  (0.9% sodium chloride solution), BID  
Each active treatment group will be comprised of 100 subjects and each saline group will 
be comprised of 50 subjects  such that approximately 90 evaluable  subjects  per active arm 
and 45 per saline arm complete the study . Up to 15 sites are anticipated to participate.  
This study will consist of two periods: a 14-day screening period and a 57-day treatment 
period  (See Appendix 1).  
2.3 End of Study Definition  
The end of the study for an individual patient is defined as that patient’s last clinic visit.  
The end of the study for the overall trial is defined as the finalization of the Clinical Study 
Report.  
2.4 Visit Descriptio n  
Refer to Appendix 1 for the Schedule of Visits and Measurements and Table 1 for the 
Study Flow Chart.  
Screening  (Visit 0)  
Subjects will be required to sign an Informed C onsent before comp leting any study rel ated 
procedure. At the screening visit, vital signs will be assessed and the subject will give blood 
for safety laboratory test s. They will also submit to a battery of tests to confirm the extent 
and severity of their symptoms and objective signs of dry eye . At least one eye must qualify 
with the following objective measures: Tear film break up time , Schirmer’s Test  
, and Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) defined as  MGD score .

Confidential  Page 21 of 88 
 Subjects who fail  to qualify for the study at screening may be rescreened  as described in 
section  3.5 
Baseline Visit Day 1 (Visit 1)  
On Day 1 (Visit 1), eligible subjects will be evaluated for baseline signs and symptoms  of 
dry eye d isease. After randomization subjects at selected sites will give a blood sample to 
be used for PK. Subjects  will be given a 14-day supply and  will self-administer a single  
drop of the study medication into each eye  at the clinic . Each subject will be given  a diary 
to record that their doses were taken. Study staff will help the subject to understand how to 
use the diary and when the remaining doses should be taken.  
Visits 2 -4 
Subjects will return to the clinic on Day 15±1 (Visit 2), 29±2 (Visit 3), and 57±2 (Visit 4) 
to be evaluated for signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. During this period , subjects  will 
dose NOV03 or the saline solution QID and BID , depending on their assigned group . The 
unused portion of the study medication should be returned to the c linic and a new study 
medication kit will be dispensed. The diary will be checked. At Visit 4, vital signs will be 
evaluated and a second blood draw will be performed for PK  at selected sites . The diary 
will be collected at the clinic during each visit . Subjects will be dismissed from the study 
after all Visit 4 assessments have been completed.  
Early Termination  
Subjects who terminate early during the treatment period will be asked to complete  all 
safety assessments  as indicated on Visit 4 on the Schedule o f Visits and Measurements  prior 
to commencement of any alternative dry eye therapy (if at all possible). Subjects who are 
terminated early from the study will not be replaced.

2.6 Enrollment and Treatment Assignment  
All dose groups wil l be enrolled in parallel. Each subject will be assigned a unique 
screening number . All screening numbers will be assigned in strict numerical sequence at 
a site and no numbers will be skipped or omitted. If all inclusion and exclusion criteria are 
met at Visits 0 and 1, each qualifying subject will then be assigned a randomization number. 
Once a randomization number has been assigned it must not be reassigned.  
 The Interactive Web Response System (IWRS)  will be 
used to account for the stratification factor  while assigning the randomization number . The 
subjects, investigators and sponsor will be masked to study treatment assignment.

5.2 Study Drug  Storage  
The study drugs must be stored in a secure area accessible only to the investigator and 
his/her designees.  Study drugs  must be stored at room temperature  and must not be 
refrigerated . The investigational product must be protected from light, and secured at the 
investigational site in a locked container. Subjects should be instructed to store study drug 
in the same manner at home. Subjects should not use dispen sed bottle that has been opened 
for more than 30 days . However, this may be prolonged at the discretion of the Investigator 
due to visit schedules.  
Study medication  shall be stored under temperature -controlled conditions with  accessibility 
only to  pharmacy  staff and the site pharmacist who is authorized to dispense it to the subject.  
5.3 Study Drug  Preparation  
When instructed by the investigator, or designee, the clinical staff  will dispense  one kit 
containing  2 bottle s for each subject on Day s 1 and 15 (± 1), and two kits on Day 29 (± 2). 
Subjects will be instructed on appropriate hygiene and eye drop dosing technique for 
multiple use drops by clinic staff.  Subjects will self -administer  NOV03  or Saline eye drops  
under the supervision of the medication  coordinat or on Day1 (Visit 1)  as shown in  
Appendix 2. The bottles are designed for multiple use .  
5.4 Administration of Study Drug  
On Day 1 the first dose of drops will be instilled by the subject during the first clinic visit . 
During Days 2  through 57 (±2) , subject s will be instructed to instill their drops into both  
eyes BID or QID . Clinic staff will coach the subject s to dose themselves at approximately 
the same time every day ±  1 hour. If a dose is missed, then the next dos e should be 
administered on time.

 5.4.1 Dispensation Schedule  
• Study drug will be provided to sites as subject  kits containing 2 bottles of  
NOV03  or saline solution . 
• At the end of Visit 1, qualified subjects will be randomized and the first dose 
of study drug wil l be administered in the study center.  The subject will  receive 
the first subject kit. Subjects will be instructed to only open one bottle at a time . 
They should be instructed not to discard the empty  bottle s but return them  at 
their next visit.  Subjects w ill record in their diary that their doses were taken.  
• At Visit 2, used/unused study drug will be collected from subjects for drug 
accountability. The subject will be dispensed a new subject kit to continue daily  
dosing.  Subjects will be instructed to onl y open one bottle at a time . They 
should be instructed not to discard the empty  bottle s but return  them at their 
next visit.  Subjects will record in their diary that their doses were taken.  
• At Visit 3 used/unused study drug will be collected from subjects  for drug 
accountability. S ubjects will receive  two subject kit s. Subjects will be 
instructed to only open one bottle at a time. They should be instructed not to 
discard the empty  bottle s but return them  at their next visit.  Subjects will record 
in their d iary that their doses were taken.  
• At Visit 4 used/unused study drug will be collected from subjects for drug 
accountability .  
• Subjects will be instructed to immediately contact the site if there is any 
problem with the study drug, e.g. kit/bottle(s) was d amaged or lost or if the 
open bottle was dropped. In case the subject needs a replacement,  a new kit is 
assigned to the subject.  
5.5 Study Drug Accountability  
All study medication that is used during the course of the study must be accounted for on 
a drug acco untability form.  Investigational study medication orders, records of receipts, 
dispensing records, and inventory forms will be examined and reconciled.  At each visit, 
subjects will return all bottles to clinic staff for accountability purposes. Accountabil ity 
will be ascertained by performing reconciliation between the amou nt of study drug 
cartons (kits and their components) sent to the site, the amount used and unused at the 
time of reconciliation. No investigative drugs or kits will be discarded prior to full 
accountability by Sponsor’s monitor.  
Study drug shipment records will be verified and accountability performed by comparing 
the shipment inventory sheet to the actual quantity of drug bottles  received at the site. 
Accurate records of receipt and dispo sition of the study drug (e.g. dates, quantity, subject  
number, kits used , kits unused , etc.) must be maintained by designated site personnel.

 5.6 Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
Unless otherwise directed, at the end of the study all unused investigational me dications 
must be directly shipped from the clinical site to the disposal facility to dispose of the 
medications. Note: The medications should not be disposed of prior to full 
accountability by the sponsor’s monitor . The clinical site will provide a copy o f all 
completed drug disposition forms to the sponsor after the completion of the study .

 A Pregnancy Questionnaire (provided in the Site Procedure Manual) will be completed by 
the study site’s Principal Investigator. The Pregnancy Questionnaire will be sent to 
 Product Safety via the SAE Fax number . The  Drug Safe ty 
Associate will forward the documentation to the Medical Monitor and the sponsor for 
review.   
At the completion of the pregnancy, the Pregnancy Outcome form (provided in the Site 
Procedure Manual) is to be submitted to the Product Safety Associate via the SAE 
fax number . The  Product Safety Associate will manage the query 
and reconciliation process until the pregnancy documentation is complete.  
6.4.3 Unscheduled Visits  
These visits may be performed in order to ensure subject safety. All  procedures performed 
at an unscheduled visit will be recorded in the source documents and on the Unscheduled 
Visit eCRF pages. Any procedure indicated in the eCRF that is not performed should be 
indicated as “Not done.”  
Evaluations that may be conducted a t an Unscheduled Visit include:  
• Visual acuity;  
• Slit-lamp biomicroscopy ; 
• Intraocular pressure ; 
• Dilated fundoscopy;  
• Safety blood draws ; 
• Pregnancy test; 
• PK samples (at selected sites)  
• Assessment of AEs; 
• Assessment of concomitant medications and/or treatments;  and 
• Any other assessments needed in the judgment of the investigator.  
 
6.4.4 Pharmacokinetic Samples  
Samples for PK analysis will be collected at the scheduled time  points  (pre-dose and at 0.5, 
1, 2, and 4 hours [ ±5 min for all time points ] after instillation ) at Visit 1 . At Visit 4 and 
unscheduled visits, PK samples should only be taken once. The sample volumes are 
described in Section 9.8. Date and time of specified dose and date and actual PK sampling 
times will be  recorded in the eCRF.  
Samples will be processed, transferred to, and stored at the corresponding bioanalytical 
laboratory during the course of the study. This process will be detailed in a separate 
laboratory manual. After completion of the study, all sam ples will be destroyed after 
analysis or at the discretion of the s ponsor .

 6.5 Compliance with P rotocol  
Subjects will be instruc ted on proper instillation and storage of study drug at the end of 
Visits 0, 1, 2, and 3, and given w ritten instructions  (Appendix 2). The used and unused 
study drug bottle s will be collected  and counted at each visit from Visit 1 up to and 
including Visit 4 to assess dosing. Subject dosing compliance will be determined by the 
subject’s respons e or lack thereof to the prompt “Was the dose taken?” in the subject diary.  
 
 
 
 
6.6 Subject D isposition  
6.6.1 Completed Subjects  
A completed subject is one who has no t been discontinued from the study . 
6.6.2 Discontinued subjects  
Subjects may be discontinued prior to t heir completion of the study due to:  
• Adverse events ; 
• Protocol violations ; 
• Administrative reasons ( e.g. inability to continue, lost to follow up) ; 
• Sponsor termi nation of study ; 
• Subject choice ( e.g. withdrawal of consent);   
• Other 
Note: In addition, any subject may be discontinu ed for any sound medical reason at the 
discretion of the investigator.  
Notification of a subject discontinuation and the reason for d iscont inuation will be made to  
the CRO  and/or study sponsor and will be clearly documented on the eCRF . 
Discontinued subjects will not be replaced.  
6.7 Study Termination  
The whole trial may be discontinued prematurely in the event of any of the following:  
New infor mation leading to unfavorable risk -benefit judgment of the study drug , e.g. due 
to: 
• Occurrence of significant previously unknown adverse reactions or unexpectedly 
high intensity or incidence of known adverse reactions, or  
• Other unfavorable safety findings.  
Sponsor’s decision that continuation of the trial is unjustifiable for medical or ethical 
reasons.

 Poor enrollment of subjects making completion of the trial within an acceptable time frame 
unlikely.  
Discont inuation of development of the s ponsor’s investi gational product . 
Health Authorities and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) / Independent Ethics 
Committees (IECs) will be informed about the discontinuation of the trial in accordance 
with applicable regulations.  
The whole trial may be terminated or suspen ded upon request of Health Authorities.  
6.8 Study  Duration  
An individual subjec t’s participation will involve 4 visits over approximately a 10-week 
period , including screening . After the study, subjects  will be treated according to standard 
of care , as needed . The total duration of the study from first subject in to last subject out is 
expected to be 24 weeks ( 6 months).   
6.9 Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
During the course of the study a monitor, or designee, will make routine site visits to review 
protocol com pliance, assess study drug  accountability , subject safety, and ensure the study 
is being conducted according to the pertinent regulatory requirements. The review of the 
subjects’ medical records will be performed in a manner that  adequately maintains  subje ct 
confidentiality. Further details of the study monitoring will be outlined in a monitoring p lan. 
Domestic and foreign regulatory agencies,   Product Safety ( Clinical Research 
Organization  [CRO ]) quality assurance, Sponsor and or its designees may carry out on -site 
inspections and/or audits , which may include source data checks. Therefore,  direct access 
to the original source data will be required for inspections and/or audits. All inspections and 
audits will be carried out giving consideration to data protection as well as subject 
confidentiality to the extent that local, state, and federal laws  apply.

 7 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the 
use of a drug in humans, whether or not the event is considered drug -related. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign ( eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease occurring after the subject  signed Informed Consent Form (ICF)   
without any judgment about causal ity.   
If there is a worsening of a medical condition that was present prior to the administration 
of the study drug , this should also be considered a new AE and reported. Any medical 
condition present prior to the administration of the study drug  that remains unchanged or 
improved should not be recorded as an AE at subsequent visits.  
Worsening of Dry Eye Disease  will be considered an AE only if the dry eye status of the 
subject exceeds their previous experiences with the condition. This will be determined by 
the subject and  the investigator.  
A clinically significant visual acuity decrease (defined as an increase of 0.22 or greater in 
logMAR score) from baseline (Visit 0) will be considered an Adverse Event.  
Study drug includes the investigational drug unde r evaluation and any comparator drug , 
placebo , or any other medications required by the protocol given during any stage of the 
study.  
Documentation regarding the AE should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, 
severity, relation ship to study d rug, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign 
or symptom observed by the physician or reported by the subject upon indirect questioning.  
7.1.1 Severity  
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an AE 
as determined by the investigator or reported to him/her by  the patient/ subject. The 
assessment of severity is made irrespective of relationship to study drug  or seriousness of 
the event and s hould be evaluated according to the following scale:  
• Mild : Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate : Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Severe : Event is int olerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of 
therapy , and interferes with the subject’s daily activities.  
7.1.2 Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of each AE to the investigational product should be determined by the 
investigator using the se explanations:  

NOV03 (  Perfluorohexyloctane)  Sponsor:  NOVALIQ GmbH  
Clinical  Trial Protocol # NVU -002 07 December 2017 FINAL V2.0  
 
Confidential  Page 44 of 88 
  
• Suspected : A reasonable possibility exists that the investigational product 
caused the AE.  
• Not Suspected : A reasonable possibility does not exist that the investigational 
product caused the AE.  
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE fo r which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the investigational product caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the investigational product and the AE. 
Types of evidence that would suggest  a causal relationship between the investigational 
product and the AE include: a single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known 
to be strongly associated with IP exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -
Johnson Syndrome); one or more o ccurrences of an event that is not commonly associated 
with IP exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the IP (e.g., 
tendon rupture); an aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such 
as known consequences  of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other 
events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that 
indicates those events occur more frequently in the IP -treatment group than in a concurrent 
or histori cal control group . 
7.1.3 Expectedness  
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information 
about the study drug s. Therefore,  the following definition s will be used : 
• Unexpected : An AE that is not listed in the investigator ’s broch ure in the Adverse 
Reaction  Section  at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
• Expected : An AE that is listed in the investigator’s brochure in the Adverse 
Reaction Section at the specificity and severity that has been observed.  
• Not Applicable : Any AE that is unrelated to the study drug.  
The investigator should initially c lassif y the expectedness of  an AE, but the final 
classification  is subject to the Medical Monitor’s determination . 
7.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE is considered serious if, in the  view of either the investigator , medical monitor  or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death ; 
• A life-threatening AE; 
Note:  An AE is considered “li fe-threatening” if, in the view  of either the 
investigator , medical monitor  or sponsor, i ts occurrence places the subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongat ion of existing hospitalization ; 

NOV03 (  Perfluorohexyloctane)  Sponsor:  NOVALIQ GmbH  
Clinical  Trial Protocol # NVU -002 07 December 2017 FINAL V2.0  
 
Confidential  Page 45 of 88 
 Note:  T he term “inpatient h ospitalization” refers to any inpatient admission 
(even if less than 24 hours). For chronic or long -term inpatients, inpatient 
admission includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care 
inpatient unit. Inpatient hospitalization does not inc lude: emergency room visits; 
outpatient/same -day/ambulatory procedures; observation/short stay units; 
rehabilitation facilities; hospice facilities; nursing homes; or clinical 
research/phase 1 units.  
Note:  The term “prolongation of existing hospitalizatio n” refers to any 
extension of an inpatient hospitalization beyond the stay anticipated or required 
for the reason for the initial admission as determined by the investigator or 
treating physician.  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disru ption of the ability t o 
conduct normal life functions ; 
Note:  A serious adverse event (SAE) specifically related to visual threat would 
be interpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes ( e.g. 
hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central  corneal ulcer or damage to the optic 
nerve).  
• A congenital anomal y/birth defect . 
• Important Medical Events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment,  they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergen cy room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
7.3 Procedures for Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Using the SAE  Report Form  approved for this study , all SAEs  and their outcomes must  be 
reported to  Product Safety (who will notify the Medical Monitor and  the study 
sponsor ). 
7.3.1 Reporting a Serious Adverse Event 
To ensure subject safety, all SAEs , regardless of relationship to the study drug, must be 
immedi ately  (i.e. within a maximum 24 HOURS after becoming aware of the event)  
reported  to  Product Safety . The  Product  Safety Associate will forward the 
documentation to the Medical Monitor and the sponsor for review. Within 24 hours of 
knowledge of a new SAE, the investigator must enter the SAE  information onto the hard 
copy SAE report form and transmit the form to the SAE Fax number below. The 
investigator must verify the report was received by Product Safety. If the 
investigator is not able to s uccessfully fax the SAE Report or verify it was successfully

Clinical  Trial Protocol # NVU -002 07 December 2017 FINAL V2.0  
 
Confidential  Page 46 of 88 
 received by  Product Safety, the investigator must call the  SAE Hot Line to 
report the SAE and follow -up with the  Product Safety Associate by phone  
 or email   
 
SAE Fax Number  (US):  
SAE Hot Line Number  (US):  
 
The information  entered  must  contain  sufficient  information  to enable  medical  assessment  
by the Medical  Monitor.  At a minimum,  the initial  SAE  report  should  contain  the following  
information:  
● Subject’s  study ID number  
● Description of the Serious Adverse E vent 
● Date of the Serious Adverse Event  
● Criterion for seriousness  
● Preliminary assignment of causality to study drug 
All information relevant to the SAE  must be r ecorded on the appropriate case report forms. 
The investigator is obligated to pursue and obtain information requested by  
Product Safety,  and/or the sponsor  in addition to that information reported on the 
case report form. All subjects experienci ng a SAE  must be followed up and the outcome 
reported.  
The investigator must  obtain and maintain in his/her files all pertinent medical records, 
information , and medical judgments from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and 
follo w-up of the subject; provide  Product Safety  and the study sponsor with a 
complete case history , which includes a statement as to whether the event was or was not 
suspected to be related to the use of the study drug; and inform the IRB of the AE within 
their guidelines for  reporting SAEs . 
All SAEs will be reported from the start of the study product . All SAEs will be followed 
until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise, explained, or the subject is lost to 
follow -up. 
7.3.2 Reporting a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adve rse Reaction  (SUSAR)  
All SAEs  that are ‘suspected’ (relationship to drug of definite, probable or possible) and 
‘unexp ected’ are to be reported to  Product Safety  within 24 hours after the site 
becomes aware of the event , via the SAE reporting process outlined above . All 
SAE/SUSARs will be promptly reported to the IRB/IEC and go verning health authorities 
(eg, United State Food and Drug Administration [FDA] ) as required by the IRB/IEC, 
federal, state, and local regulations  and timelines .

 7.4 Procedures for Unmasking of Study Drug  
All subjects, investigators, and study personnel involved with the conduct of the study will 
be masked with regard to treatment assignments. The mask may be broken in exceptional 
circumstances. In a medical emergency, when the manage ment of a subject’s condition 
requires knowledge of the treatment assignment, the Investigator, or designee, will obtain 
the study treatment assignment from the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). If 
possible, the medical emergency should be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to 
obtaining the treatment assignment, or as soon after as possible. The Sponsor may unmask 
for regulatory submission determination of an SAE when necessary (see Section  7.3.1 ). 
In a non -emergency situation, when a code break is required, it must be discussed with the  
Medical monitor  and/or  Product Safety  and the study sponsor . The code break 
must be  approved in writing  by the Sponsor.  
If the randomization code for a subject is  broken, the Investigator will record the date and 
reason for lifting the mask  for that subject in the source documents. Upon unmasking, t he 
subject will be withdrawn from the study and should complete both the Early Termination 
and Follow -up procedures.  
Study staff will examine and reconcile s tudy medication orders, records of receipts, 
dispensing records, and inventory forms throughout the study  (see Section 9.5.2 ). 
7.5 Type and Duration of the Follow -up of Subject s after Adverse 
Events  
The investigator will follow unresolved AEs to resolution until the subject is lost to follow -
up or until the AE is otherwise classified. Resolution means the subject has returned to 
baseline state of health or the investigator does not expect any further improvement or 
worsening of the AE. If the subject  is lost to follow -up, the investigator should make 3 
reasonable attempts to contact the subject  via telephone, post, or certified mail. All follow -
up will be documented in the subjec t’s source document. Non -serious AEs identified on the 
last scheduled contact must be recorded on the AE eCRF with the status noted.  
If the investigator becomes aware of any new information regarding an existing SAE  (i.e. 
resolution, change in condition, or new treatment), a new  SAE Report Form mu st be 
completed and faxed to Product Safety  within  24 hours of the site’s awareness of 
the new information . The original SAE form is not to  be altered , but a new SAE Report 
Form must  be completed and identifi ed consecutively based on the previous report form 
(i.e. Initial Report, Follow -up #1, Follow -up #2, etc .). The report must  describe whether the 
event has resolved or  continues and how the event was treated.

 8 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES AND METHODS OF ANALYSES  
8.1 Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populations will be considered:  
• All Subjects – All subjects who sign the ICF  
• Modified Intention -to-Treat  – Modified Intention -to-Treat ( mITT) includes all 
subjects random ly assigned to study treatment and who take  at least 1 dose of 
study treatment.  Subjects  will be analyzed according to the treatment they are 
randomized to . 
• Per Protocol Population  – The Per Protocol (PP) population includes subjects in 
the safety population who do not have significant protocol dev iations and who 
complete the study. Protocol deviations will be assessed prior to database lock 
and unmasking. The PP population will be analyzed using observed data only 
for efficacy variables. Subjects in the PP population will be analyzed as treated . 
• Safety Population  – The safety population includes all subjects who have 
received at least one dose of the investigational product . The safety population 
will be analyzed for all safety assessments. Subjects in the Safety population 
will be analyzed as treat ed.  
• PK Population  – The PK population includes all subjects with an evaluable PK 
sample. The PK population will be used to summarize all perfluorohexyloctane 
blood concentrations.  
The statistical analysis of safety data will be performed for the safety po pulation. The 
analysis of efficacy data will primarily be performed for the mITT population . The 
efficacy analysis based  on the PP population will serve  as the sensitivity analyses.  
8.2 Statistical Hypotheses  
The following two sets of hypotheses will be tested  as the primary hypotheses of the study:  
H01: The difference in the mean change from baseline to Week 8 total Corneal Fluorescein 
Staining (CFS) score between NOV03 QID and combined saline solution  groups (NOV03 
QID – combined saline solution ) = 0  against  
H11: The difference in the mean change from baseline to Week 8 total CFS score between 
NOV03 QID and combined saline solution  groups (NOV03 QID – combined saline 
solution ) ≠ 0 
and

 H02: The difference in the mean change from baseline to Week 8 total CFS sco re between 
NOV03 BID and combined saline solution  groups (NOV03 BID – combined saline 
solution ) = 0  against  
H12: The difference in the mean change from baseline to Week 8 total CFS score between 
NOV03 BID and combined saline solution  groups (NOV03 BID – combined saline 
solution ) ≠ 0.  
8.3  Sample Size  
This study is expected to enroll 100 subjects in each of the four treatment arms, for a total 
of 300 randomized subjects.  
 
 this study has 8 8% power to detect a difference of 
0.8 units in the change from baseline in corneal staining between an active arm and the 
combined control  arm using a one-sided t -test at 5% level of significance. This assumes a 
standard deviation of 1.9 units for each arm.  
8.4 Statistical Analysis  
8.4.1 General Considerations  
Quantitative variables will be summarized using number of subjects (n), mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum and maximum. The qualitative variables will be summarize d 
using counts and percentages.  
All summaries will be presented by treatment group , with placebo presented both pooled 
as well as separately for QID and BID dosing . Summaries will be provided for 
demographics, baseline medical history, concurrent therapie s, and subject disposition.  
For the purpose of summarization, medical history, concurrent therapies, and AEs will be 
coded to MedDRA and WHO Drug dictionaries, as appropriate.  
Baseline measures are defined as the last non-missing measure prior to the initi ation of 
randomized study treatment . 
All primary  will be one-sided at a significance level of 0.05.  
8.4.2 Unit of Analysis  
For efficacy endpoints, the unit of analysis will be the study  eye as defined by the following:  
Study Eye: Eyes are eligible for analysis if they meet all of the inclusion criteria. In the case 
that both eyes are eligible for analysis, the worst eye shall be chosen and this will be defined 
as the eye with worse (higher)  total corneal staining  at Visit 1 . If the total co rneal staining 
is the same in both eyes then the right e ye will be selected as the study eye.

 8.4.3 Missing Data  
The primary efficacy analyses will be performed using the mITT population, and using a 
repeated measures model without any imputation for missing obs ervations. Sensitivity 
analyses using different analysis populations and methods for handling missing data may 
be further detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
 
 
8.4.4 Multiplicity Consideration  
To control for inflation of type 1 error rate due to multiple  hypotheses , the analysis will be 
conducted in a hierarchical manner.  
The hypothesis testing to compare the  BID arm and control will only proceed if the QID 
vs. control comparisons are statistically significant.  
8.4.5 Primary Efficacy Analyses  
All efficacy analyses will be primarily based on the mITT . Population.  Analyses based on 
Per-Protocol (PP) population will be  supportive in nature. The primary evaluation of 
efficacy of the active arms will be against a combined control  arm (with BID and QID saline 
solution ). Analyses will also be provided comparing BID to QID saline solution  to 
determine appropriateness of comb ining for the primary analysis. Sensitivity analysis may 
be undertaken for dosing -regimen matching control  (that is, QID active vs. QID saline 
solution ). 
The primary analysis will be performed to compare the Week 8 difference in the change 
from baseline in  total CFS between each of the active NOV03 groups and the combined 
saline solution  group. The comparison will be conducted using a repeated measures model 
with treatment, site, visit, and treatment by visit  interaction as fixed categorical factors, 
baseli ne as a continuous covariate, and using an unstructured covariance matrix. To 
establish evidence of efficacy in this proof of concept study, the hypothesis tests will be 
one-sided and performed at the 0.05 significance level.  
 
The total CFS score is calcul ated as the sum of the staining from the inferior, central, 
superior , nasal, and temporal regions,  such that a larger number indicates worse  dry eye 
signs.  
Treatment group contrasts and least-squared ( LS) means will be presented from the model 
together wi th two -sided 95% confidence intervals.  
The primary analysis will use  the mITT population at the Visit 4, Week 8  visit; the PP  
population will also be used to further understand the primary results .

8.4.7 Safety Variables  
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Population . The primary evaluation of 
safety of the active arm s will be against a combined control  arm (with BID and QID saline 
solution ). The summaries of the safety data will be presented for a combined control  arm 
as well as for each control arm separately . Additionally, t he listings will have an indicator 
for sub jects receiving BID or QID saline solution . 
Extent of Exposure  
Dosing information for each treatment and each subject will be listed. Discontinuation of 
treatment will be summarized by treatment received. The primary reason for study drug 
discontinuation w ill also be summarized by treatment received.  
Analysis of Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. Frequencies and percentages 
of subjects with treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious TEAEs, and TEAEs 
causing prem ature discontinuation will be provided by treatment group. An AE is treatment 
emergent if it occurs or worsens after the first dose of study treatment. Furthermore, 
frequencies will be given of subjects with TEAEs by system organ class, by system organ 
class and preferred term, by system organ class, preferred term and maximal severity, by 
system organ class, preferred term and strongest relationship, and by system organ class,

 preferred term, maximal severity, and strongest relationship. Separate summaries  will be 
performed for ocular and non -ocular AEs.  
The treatment groups will be compared in regard to safety endpoints descriptively. No 
inferential comparison will be conducted.  
Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the most r ecent version of WHO -Drug and 
summarized by treatment group . 
Analysis of Laboratory Parameters  
Clinical laboratory parameters including hematology  and serum chemistry will be 
summarized by treatment group and by visit. Baseline values, the values at each s ubsequent 
visit, and changes from baseline will be summarized for each of the quantitative laboratory 
assessments by treatment. Shift tables of chemistry and hematology, results will be used to 
summarize changes from baseline to study termination (or early  termination). The number 
and percentage of chemistry  and hematology values outside of normal ranges and/or with 
potential clinical importance will be summarized by visit and treatment.  
Other safety endpoints  including visual acuity, slit -lamp biomicroscop y, dilated 
fundoscopy, safety laboratory, and intraocular pressure  will be summarized by treatment 
group and visit using descriptive statistics. Changes or shifts from baseline will also be 
summarized where appropriate.  For assessments performed by eye, st udy eye and fellow 
eye will be summarized separately. In addition, shifts from baseline to worst on -treatment 
value for ocular safety assessments will be summarized.  
8.4.8 Pharmacokinetic Variables  
Whole b lood for perfluorohexyloctane blood  concentration measure ments will be drawn 
from a minimum of 66  subjects at one or more investigational site s with the goal of having 
samples from 20  subjects per each of the active treatment arm s. Blood concentrations of 
perfluorohexyloctane  will be summarized descriptively.  The following PK parameters will 
be estimated: AUC 0-, Cmax, tmax.  
The relationship between safety endpoints and pharmacokinetic endpoints may be explored 
to understand the impact of PK parameters on safety.  
Interim Analyses  
No interim analyses are planned for this study.

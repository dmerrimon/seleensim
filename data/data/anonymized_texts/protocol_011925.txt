Study Design:  This is  a Phase 2 multicenter , randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
parallel -group, dose -ranging study comparing ATH- 1017 40 mg/day and ATH- 1017  70 
mg/day with placebo in subjects with a clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) , diagnosed on a ‘probable’ level according to McKhann, 
2011. The study will be conducted at a total of approximately 12 centers in Australia 
and the US. Subject s and their caregivers will be required to sign an informed consent 
form (ICF) and will be evaluated against the inclusion/exclusion criteria  during a 
screening period; all eligible subjects will be tested for apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype . Subjects  who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will undergo baseline 
EEG assessments ( ERP P300 and 
) at 2  separate baseline visits. At the first

 baseline visit , (Visit 2 a, Pre-baseline , Day -5 to Day -3), MMSE will be performed to 
first, followed by EEG assessments ( ERP P300 and ) at 2 separ ate time points 
appro
ximately  2 hours apart . EEG data should be uploaded for quality check 
immediately after the completion of the Pre -baseline visit (Visit 2a). At the second 
baseline visit (Visit 2 b, Baseline, Day 1 ), no more than 6 days after the P re-baseline 
visit, subjects will be randomized  in a ratio of 1:1:1 to 3 parallel arms, either to active 
treatment (ATH -1017 40 mg/day or ATH -1017 70 mg /day) or placebo. During 
randomization, subjects will be stratified by screening  Mini- Mental State Examination 
(MMSE) severity: mild (MMSE: 20 -24) versus m oderate (MMSE:  14-19). At this 
Baseline visit (Visit 2b), s ubjects will undergo pre-dose baseline and post -dose EEG 
assessments  (ERP P300 and ).  
Study drugs will be administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection once -daily  (OD)  
prefer
ably during daytime. Do not take more than one dose within 8 hours. The f irst 
SC injection of study drug will be performed at site under supervision. The subject 
should withhold study drug administration on the day of subsequent clinic visits; study drug admini stration will be done on site under supervision of site staff at these visits.
 
Each subject is required to have a primary caregiver willing to accept responsibility for supervising or, if required, administering study drug, and assessing the condition of t he 
subject thro ughout the study in accordance with all protocol requirements. During the 
double -blind treatment period, clinic visits will take place on Day 1 and thereafter at 
Weeks 2, 6, 12, 16, 20, and 26 , with a safety follow -up visit scheduled 4 weeks  after 
completion of the double -blind period at Week  30 (see Table 1  for Schedule of 
Assessme 
nts). Subjects will undergo EEG assessments ( ERP P300 and ) at each 
post-b
aselin
e clinic visit (pre- and post -dose timepoints) through Week 26, plus the 
safety follow -up visit at Week 30 ( see Table 1  for ti
ming of assessments ). On Day 1, 
after completion of the first dose, subjects will remain on -site 2 hours for 
post-treatment clinical observation subject to the conditions in section 5.5. As marked 
circadian fluctuations of cognitive performance have  been observed in AD ( Hilt, 
2015 ), ADAS -Cog 11 and COWAT assessments shall occur at clinic visits in the 
morning at  approximately  the same time they were performed during the initial 
Baseli ne assessment . Similarly, ADCS- CGIC assessments will be organized adjacent 
to the individual EEG  assessment times. Subject s may live at home, in a senior 
residential setting, or an institutional s etting without the need for continuous nursing 
care, and should not be likely to experience a change in living conditions (e.g., institutionalization, moving to a different city, etc.), or change in primary caregiver, during participation in the trial period.  The end of the study is defined as the date of the 
safety follow -up visit, Visit 9/Week 30. Subjects who terminate prior to Visit 8 are to 
complete same assessments as Visit 8/early termination (ET).  
An independent  Data S afety Monitoring Board will conduct periodic review and 
assessments of unblinded safety data (AEs, labs, ECG, etc) throughout the study to ensure the safety of study subject s. Blood draws will take place at scheduled clinic 
visits for analysis of plasma co ncentrations of ATH -1017 and ATH -1001.  
A 26-week open -label extension  will be offered  at participating sites.

study.  
Statistical Methods:  General Statistical Methods and Types of Analysis:  
Analysis of pharmacodynamics will be based on the Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) 
Population, consisting of all randomized subjects who took at least one dose of the 
study medication and who completed at least one  ERP P300 baseline assessment and 
one post -baseline ERP P300 assessment . A mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) 
analysis to compare the estimated changes in ERP P300 latency between active 
treatment and placebo  will be used.  
Correlation of ERP P300 latency and cognition/executive memory function measured by (1) ADAS -Cog
11 and/or (2)  COWAT will be evaluated .  
Safety analyses will be based on the Safety Population consisting of all randomized 
subjects who received at least one dose of the study medication. All safety parameters 
will be summarized des criptively.  
Sample Size Considerations:  
A total sample size of 60 evaluable subjects (20 per treatment arm) is based on the results of the Phase 1 study, NDX -1017- 0101, which demonstrated significant effects 
of ATH -1017 on ERP P300 in n=7 ATH -1017 -treated AD subjects compared to 
n=4 placebo -treated AD subjects .

b. Only weight collected at Baseline/Day 1 (Visit 2b), Week 12 (Visit 5), Week 26 (Visit 8),  and Safety follow -up (Visit 9).  
c Blood collection for FSH levels (to confirm post -menopausal state in females), serology, ApoE genotyping, folate, Vitamin B 12, 
 fT3, fT4, and TSH . 
d ‘C-SSRS Baseline/Screening’ version will be administered at Screening and ‘C -SSRS Since Last Visit’ version will be 
 administered at all post -Screening visits.  
e Dispensing of kits containing study drug will occ ur every 2 weeks , at the study site or as needed by direct -to-patient  
     shipment ; larger provision of study drug is permitted to  accommodate personal need, e.g., vacation; drug returns will be  
     recorded and compliance calculated. IP administration by subject or  caregiver will be assessed at Visits 2 b through 7, inclusive.  
f First SC injection of IMP will be performed at site under supervision . Subjects will remain at site for 2 hours ± 15 minutes for  
     safety observation follow up.  They may be discharged from the clinic at this time absent any systemic AEs (but not for local  
     site reaction). Should they have systemic AEs, they should rem ain under observation for an additional 2 hours and may be  
     discharged at that time with investigator’s clearance. Subjects  should withhold IMP dose on the day of subsequent clinic visits  
     whereupon IMP administration will be done on site under s upervision of site staff . There is no specified in -clinic observation  
     period for these subsequent visits but will require investigator discharge from the clinic.  
      It is recommended to contact the subject/caregiver by phone at appropriate interv als to support dosing compliance and injection    
      techniques.  
g. Physical and Neurological Exam should be done post -dose on all visits when dosing applies   
h.  MRI (or CT for subjects with non -MRI-safe cardiac pacemaker, or other relevant medical reason, with Medical Monitor  
     approval ) scan must have been performed within 12 months before  Screening. If such scan is unavailable or older than  
     12 months, it should be repeated to ascertain the diagnosis before  ra ndomization.

i. 12-lead ECGs will be performed pre -dose and 30 (± 15) minutes post -dose on Day  1(Visit 2b)  and 30 (± 15) minutes post -dose 
 at all other visits . All ECG assessments will be performed  in triplicate approximately 1 minute apart . 
j. Vital signs will be performed pre -dose on all visits. Supine BP and HR recordings will be made after the subject has been supine  
for at least 5  minutes. Orthostatic BP will be recorded as follows: the first blood pressure will be the average of 3 measurem ents 
recorded after the subject is supine for 5  minutes; the second blood pressure will be recorded after the subject stood for up to 3 
minutes.  
k. Safety labs include chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis.  
l. Prior or concurrent medications.  
m. Subject hearing will be tested to establish suitability for auditory ERP assessment , i.e., ability to hear and differentiate two  
     different tones, using the centrally provided EEG equipment; hearing aid must be removed during the screening hearing tes t and   
     during EEG recordings . 
n. A t Pre-baseline visit (Visit 2 a, Day -5 to Day -3 , no dosing ), EEG assessments ( ERP P300 and  will b
e performed  twice 
approxi
mately 2 hours apart . EEG data should be uploaded for quality check immediately after the completion of the Pre- baseline 
visit (Visit 2a). If both EEG assessments failed quality check at pre -baseline, the visit will be repeated once and the screening 
window of 28 days can be extended upon approval by Medical Monitor.  
     At Baseline/Day 1 (Visit 2b), EEG assessments (ERP P300 and  will
 be performed at pre-dose following the completion  
of baseli
ne assessments of ADAS -Cog 11 and COWAT, and before the ADCS -CGIC assessment, up to 1.5 hour before dose in 
clinic. EEG will be assessed post -dose at approximately 2 ( ±1) hours after IMP dosing.  
     At Visits 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, EEG assessments (ERP P300 and  will be performed at pre -dose up to 1  hour before dose in 
clinic. EEG will be assessed post -dose following the  completion of ADAS -Cog 11 and COWAT assessments, and before th e ADCS -
CGIC assessment, at approximately 2 ( ±1) hours after IMP dosing.  
     At safety follow up (Visit 9, no dosing), EEG assessments (ERP P300 and  will be performed following the complet ion of  
ADAS -Cog 11 and COWAT.  
o. PK plasma samples will be collected at post -dose on Baseline/Day 1 (Visit 2 b); pre -dose and post -dose at Week 12 (Visit 5)  
     and Week 26  (Visit 8). The pre -dose PK sample is collected anytime before dosing. The post -dose PK sample is collected   
     anytime between 30 minutes and 120 minutes after dosing as practical . The actual time of  dosing and of PK sampling will be  
     recorded.  
p. Plasma sampl e will be collected and banked for biomarker analysis (only for subjects who provided consent for plasma 
 biobanking). Ten aliquots will be created from the plasma sample.  
q. Subjects who terminate prior to Visit 9 are to complete same assessments as Visit  8/ET (early termination). For clinical outcome  
     assessments if  completed within 4 weeks of the ET visit  they do not need to be repeated; all safety outcomes and drug  
     accountability should be performed regardless of interval . 
r. Safety follow -up visit to be performed for subjects who do not roll over into the optional open-label extension (OLEX) 
 study; s ubjects  who roll over into the OLEX study will complete the safety follow -up visit at the end of the OLEX study.  
*  At Pre-baseline visit (Visit 2 a, Day -5 to Day - 3), MMSE should be done first before all other assessments.  
    At  Baseline/Day 1 (Visit 2 b), ADAS -Cog 11, COWAT, and ADCS -CGIC will be performed pre-dose ; ADCS -ADL23,  C-
SSRS, will be performed anytime during the visit.  
   For visits a fter the baseline (except for safety follow -up when dosing is not applicable), a ll clinical outcome assessments will be 
performed pos t-dose , with ADAS -Cog 11 and COWAT assessments performed first at approximately 1 hour ( ± 30 minutes) post -
dose. ADCS -CGIC assessments, when applicable,  will be organized at adjacent times shortly after the individual EEG assessments .

 1 INTRODUCTION 
ATH-1017 is an experimental Alzheimer’s disease ( AD) treatment, formulated as a sterile 
solution for subcutaneous (SC) injection. ATH-1017 is a prodrug, which is rapidly converted to 
the active drug ATH -1001 in the plasma after SC injection. ATH-1017 was developed as a 
water -soluble prodrug of ATH-1001 to allow SC dosing in aqueous vehicles. The active drug 
ATH-1001 acts as an agonist of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor and its tyrosine 
kinase, MET. Central nervous system (CNS) MET expression is crucial in maintaining the healthy adult brain ( Hawrylycz, 2015), and is reduced in AD particularly in the hippocampus 
(Hamasaki, 2014 ). The HGF/MET system presents a new therapeutic target to treat 
neurodegeneration and restore cognitive function in AD. 
1.1 Background 
Dementia of the Alzheimer’s type (hereafter referred to as AD ) is the most common form of 
dementia and the largest unmet med ical need in neurology ( Citron, 2010). AD can be further 
classified based on age of onset and genetic risks. Individuals under age 65 have early-onset AD, 
and many of whom have a dominant genetic mutation (i.e., familial AD with known mutations in the following genes: amyloid precursor protein, presenilin -1, and presenilin-2). Late -onset AD 
patients have an age of onset at 65 years and older, who typically have no dominant genetic risks (i.e., sporadic AD), with disease onset involving a complex interplay of aging, Apolipoprotein E 
(Apo E)-ε4 genotype, environmental, and lifestyle risk factors. The late- onset sporadic cases 
account for about 95% of the total AD population. Although age is the biggest risk factor, AD is 
not a part of normal aging. 
Growing evidence suggests that complex CNS disorders, like AD, are unlikely to be caused by a 
single route of pathology; they are likely the result of a multifactorial interplay related to 
genetics, age, and environment. Pharmacological stimulation of a critical neuro trophic factor 
system (HGF/MET) may  stop neurodegeneration and promote neuro-regeneration. Neurotrophic 
factors represent a promising  therapeutic target for the treat ment of AD and other dementias, and 
drugs that stimulate neurotrophic systems have the potential to address neurodegeneration and improve cognition by protecting existing neurons, promoting connectivity, inducing neuro- regenerative mechanisms, as well as addressi ng multiple aspects of the AD pathology, by 
decreasing inflammation and improving cerebral blood flow ( Funakoshi, 2011). The therapeutic 
promise of neurotrophic factors in neurodegenerative disorders is hampered by the lack of efficient and non-invasive delivery to the brain. Gene therapy strategies, primarily using adeno -associated viral vectors, have been developed and clinically evaluated for therapeutic 
potential in AD and Parkinson’s disease patients. These strategies are largely hindered by 
challenges  related to gene delivery and transduction with limited brain exposure, uncontrollable 
dose over long- term treatment, and potential immune complications ( Piguet, 2017). Therefore, a 
small molecule approach capable of pas sing the blood brain barrier and ent ering all regions of

 the brain, presents a superior therapeutic strategy for targeting neurotrophic factors to treat 
neurodegenerative disorders.  
ATH-1017 represents a new approach to treat AD in a systemic approach. The mode of action of 
ATH-1017 is augmentation of HGF function and facilitation of signal transduction through MET 
phosphorylation ( Figure 1).  
Figure 1 Mode of Action of ATH -1017 
 
AKT  = protein kinase B ; EEG  = electroencephalogram; HGF  = hepatic growth factor ; LTP = long- term potentiation; 
MAPK  = mitogen -activated protein kinase; MET  = MET receptor tyrosine kinase ; NMDA = N- methyl D -aspartate; 
P = phosphorylated; PI3K  = phosphoinositide 3- kinase; PKC  = protein kinase C; PLCγ  = phospholipase C -gamma; 
PM = plasma membrane; PSP = post-synaptic potential; RAC1  = Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1; 
RAF  = rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF) kinase; STAT3  = signal transducer and activator of t ranscription 3. 
 
After SC injection, the prodrug ATH-1017 is rapidly converted to the active drug ATH-1001, 
which binds to HGF and enhances MET activation. Interaction of the ligand HGF with its 
receptor MET induces MET phosphorylation (activation) and recruitment of effector proteins that potentiate downstrea m signaling through the PI3K/AKT and RAS/RAF /MAPK pathways, 
among others ( Organ, 2011). In the CNS, HGF/MET activity has neuroprotective and 
neurotrophic effects and modulates neurogenesis and neuronal maturation ( Ebens, 1996; Maina, 
1999; Shang, 2011). As a critical regulator of inflammation, HGF/MET activity reduces the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interl eukin-6 and promotes expression of the

 anti-inflammatory interleukin -10 ( Molnarfi, 2015 ). HGF/MET activity also leads to protein 
kinase C (PKC) -mediated potentiation of N- methyl D -aspartate (NMDA) receptor current, 
synaptic localization of NMDA receptors, and long- term potentiation ( Tyndall, 2007), processes 
important for memory formation.  
1.2 Rationale for the Clinical Study  
The Sponsor has completed a Phase 1a/b  study of ATH-1017 in which preliminary safety and 
tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) based on 
electroencephalogram  (EEG), including quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) and event-
related potenti als (ERP) was established. Quantitative EEG  was employed in both preclinical and 
clinical studies providing a translatable biomarker of neuronal network activity, as a function of 
pharmacological intervention. The qEEG analysis, combined with PK-PD modeling, and preclinical behavioral study results, have supported the identification of an active clinical dose 
range in humans (see Section 3.2). Additionally, in an ERP auditory oddball paradigm, ATH -
1017 treatment in AD subjects  significantly reduced ERP P300 latency after 8 days of treatment 
when compared to placebo. This finding suggest s ATH-1017 treatment has potential effects on 
cognitive processing and working memory access in AD. 
This study ( ATH-1017- AD-0202) is designed to provide evidence for the functional translational 
biomarker P300 latency as being predictive of pro-cognitive effects induced by ATH-1017 
therapy. In addition, this study will determine time to onset and degree of maintenance of P300 laten cy reduction over 26 weeks . Eligible participants will rece ive once- daily  (OD)  SC injections  
of ATH-1017 (40  mg or 70 mg) or placebo , over a 26 -week double -blind period, followed by a 
4-week safety follow-up. Subjects who complete the double-blind study wi ll have the option to 
roll over into a long- term (26 -week) open-label extension study. 
1.3 Risk -Benefit Assessment  
Whilst ERP P300 and qEEG results in humans are indicative of CNS penetration and target engagement, efficacy in subjects with AD (in terms of cognitive , functional, or behavioral 
improvement) has not been established. Therefore, the benefit to study subjects of participating in this clinical trial are not yet known.  
In human clinical studies of ATH-1017, single SC administration of 2, 6, 20, 40, 60, and 90 mg 
in healthy young subjects, and multiple administration of 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg (SC, OD, over 
9 consecutive days) in healthy elderly subjects, and 40 mg (SC, OD, over 9 consecutive days) in AD subjec ts were safe and well tolerated. Injection site reactions included pain, pruritus, and/ or 
erythema, were mild in nature, and resolved without specific therapy. A potential risk for 
hepatotoxicity identified in nonclinical studies has not been observed in human studies but will 
be closely monitored in this study. To date, no CNS -specific adverse events have been observed 
in humans.

 3 OVERALL DESIGN AND PLAN OF THE STUDY  
This is  a Phase 2  multicente r, randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled, parallel-group, 
dose-ranging study comparing ATH-1017 40 mg/day and ATH -1017 70 mg/day with placebo in 
subjects with a clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate AD , diagnosed on a ‘probable’ level 
according to McKhann, 2011. The study will be conducted at a total of approximately 12 centers 
in Australia and the US . Subject s and their caregivers will be required to sign an informed 
consent form (ICF) and will be evaluated against the inclusion/exclusion criteria during a screening period ; all eligible subjects will be tested for ApoE genotype. Subjects who meet all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will undergo baseline EEG assessments ( ERP P300 and ) at 2 
sep
arate baselin
e visits. At the first baseline visit (Visit 2 a, Pre-baseline, Day -5 to Day -3 ), 
Mini- Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) will be performed to first, followed by EEG 
assessments ( ERP P300 and ) at 2 separate timepoints  approximately 2 hours apart  (no 
dosing). EEG data should be uploaded for quality check immediately after the completion of the Pre-baseline visit (Visit 2a).  At the second baseline visit (Visit 2 b, Baseline, Day 1), no more 
than 6 days after the P re-baseline visit, subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to 3 
parallel arms, either to active treatment (ATH -1017 40 mg/day or ATH-1017 70 mg/day) or 
placeb o. During randomization, subjects will be stratified by screening  MMSE severity: mild 
(MMSE: 20 -24) versus moderate (MMSE: 14-19) . At this Baseline visit (Visit 2b), subjects will 
undergo pre-dose baseline and post-dose EEG assessments ( ERP P300 and ). 
Study drugs will be a
dministered by SC injection OD preferably by during daytime. Do not take 
more than one dose within 8 hours. The f irst SC injection of study drug will be performed at site 
under supervision. The subject should withhold study drug administration on the day of subsequent clinic visits; study drug administration will be done on site under supervision of site staff at these visits . Each subject is required to have a primary caregiver willing to accept 
responsibility for supervising or, if required, administering study drug, and assessing  the 
condition of the subject throughout the study in accordance with all protocol requirements. During the double-blind treatment period, clinic visits will take place on Day 1 and thereafter at Weeks 2, 6, 12, 16, 20, and 26, with a safety follow-up visit scheduled 4 weeks after completion of the double- blind period at Week  30 (see Table 1  for schedule of assessments). Subjects will 
undergo EEG assessm
ents ( ERP P300 and ) at each po
st-baseline clinic  visit (pre - and 
post-dose timepoints) through Week 26, plus the safety follow- up visit at Week 30 (see Table 1  
for timing o
f assessments) . On Day 1, after completion of the first dose, subjects will remain on-
site 2 hours for post- treatment safety observation.  As marked circadian  fluctuations of cognitive 
performance have been observed in AD ( Hilt, 2015), ADAS -Cog 11 and COWAT assessments 
shall occur  at clinic visits in the morning at  approximately  the same time they were performed 
during the initial Baseline  assessment . Similarly,  ADCS -CGIC assessments will be organized at 
adjacent times to the individual EEG  assessment times. Subjects may live at home, in a senior 
residential setting, or an institutional setting without the need for continuous nursing care, and should not be likely to experience a change in living conditions (e.g., institutionalization, moving

 to a different city, etc.), or change in primary caregiver, during participation in the trial period. 
The end of the study is defined as the date of the safety follow-up visi t, Visit 9 /Week 30.  
Subject s who terminate prior to Visit 8  are to comp lete same assessments as Visit 8 /early 
termination ( ET). 
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will conduct periodic review and assessments of unblinded safety data (AEs, labs, ECG, etc.) throughout the study to ensure the safety of study subjects (see Section  7.2).  
Blood draws will take place at scheduled clinic visits (Day 1, Week 12 and Week 26) for 
analysis of plasma concentrations of ATH-1017 and ATH-1001 (see T able 1  for schedule of 
assessments).  
A 26 -week open- label extension will be offered  at participating sites . 
3.1 Justification  for Study Design 
The study is designed to primarily explore the correlation and extended time course of changes 
of the functional pharmacodynamic biomarker ERP P300 and cognitive performance , as well as 
establishing further long- term safety in mild to moderate AD subjects  (based on clinical 
diagnostic criteria of AD [ McKhann, 2011 ] and the inclusion/exclusion criteria), with 
double-blind, parallel- arm tre atment duration of 26 weeks. An option to roll over into a 
long- term (26 -week) open -label extension study will be available to subjects who comple te the 
double-blind study; the purpose of the open-label extension is to continue to collect long- term 
safety . 
The study is additionally designed to explore treatment effects using validated outcome scales for cognitive func
tion, executive memory function, activities of daily living, and behavioral 
changes, this study will collect pharmaco-economic data using validated scales for  
. 
The saf
ety assessments for the study are generally accepted measures for en suring safety of 
subjects during a double-blind clinical trial. I n addition, subject safety  will be closely monitored  
and stopping criteria implemented (see Section 5.8). This study will employ an independent DSMB who will conduct periodic review and assessments of unblinded safety data (AEs, labs, ECG, etc.) throughout the study. 
The PK sampling schedule is considered appropriate given the information available. The 
rationale for dose selection is discussed in Section 3.2. 
3.2 Justification for Dose  
The dose selection for this clinical study is based on safety, PK, and PK-PD modeling of 
ATH-1017’s tr
eatment effect i n qEEG and noncli
nical studies in animal models, together with 
the qEEG a
nd ERP P300 results of a completed Phase 1a/b  study.

Version 3.00  Page 33 of 87 25-MAY- 2021  
 In the randomized placebo -controlled Phase 1a/b  study, ATH-1017 has been evaluated for safety, 
PK, and PD  in a total of 88 subjects (of whom 65 were exposed to active study drug), including 
healthy young, healthy elderly, and AD subjects. ATH-1017 was evaluated over a wide dose 
range to understand the safety profile and PD  effects  based on qEEG and ERP P300 assessment . 
The obs
erved qEEG effects (i.e., gamma power induction) are thought to be linked to the 
mechanism of action of ATH-1017, indicative of CNS penetration and target engagement. PK-
PD modeling has been employed to guide dose selection, considering data from nonclinical qEEG studies in mouse, nonclinical efficacy studies in animal models (i.e., scopolamine-induced 
amnesia in rat and aged dementia rat), and Phase 1 a/b human clinical study. The results were 
compared based on equivalent PK exposures, based on C
max, to inform dose selection for the next 
proposed study. Given the mode of action of ATH -1017 is via pulsatile activation of  a growth 
factor system, the PD  of ATH-1017 are primarily driven by concentration (C max). Upon 
activation, MET phosphorylation persists for some time before the active complex is 
internalized, and either degraded or dephosphorylated and recycled back to the membrane. This pulsatile method of ATH -1017 (prodrug) administration is aligned with the natural regulatory 
mechanisms of HGF/MET activity, and suggests a steady- state level of ATH-1001 (active drug) 
exposure is not necessary for a therapeutic effect.  
As summarized in  Figure 2, the active PD  dose ra
 nge in humans (20 to 90 mg) overlaps with 
exposures that lead to qEEG 
gamma induction as well as improved behavioral measures and 
regene
rative effects in nonclinical studies. Higher doses in hum ans and animal efficacy studies 
have not been tested, therefore the upper limit of the PD  range is not defined. The PK profile is 
highly consistent across multiple species including rat, mouse, dog, and human, further supporting the utility of PK-PD modeling in guiding dose selection. The  use of qEEG as a 
translational biomarker to guide dose optimization in clinical trials of ATH-1017 allowed for 
efficient selection of dose s that fall within the cross -species PD  range.

 Figure 2 Dose selection based on PK -PD modeling  
 
The dose s selected  for the proposed study are 40 mg (SC, OD) and 70 mg ( SC, OD). Both the 
40 mg and 70 mg doses are covered by the current PD  active dose range (20  mg to 90 mg) 
defined by human qEEG studies, while the upper boundary is not yet determined. Equivalent 
dose exposure levels (C max-based) have been tested in nonclinical studies and showed positive 
qEEG effects and functional improvement. The safety and tolerability of both doses are 
supported by the Phase 1 a/b results . The 40 mg dose has been evaluated in 8 healthy young 
subjects (SC , single dose ; 6 active versus 2 placebo ), 8 healthy elderly subjects ( SC, OD, over 
9 days ; 6 active versus 2 placebo ), and 11 AD subjects ( SC, OD, over 9 days ; 7 active versus 
4 placebo ), with consistent and dose- linear PK , and good safety across all 3 cohorts. The 
normalization of ERP P300 in AD subjec ts treated with 40 mg ATH-1017 suggests a 
treatment -dependent promotion of synaptic activity, and further suggests a therapeutic potential 
of ATH-1017 at the 40 mg dose level.  
In reference to the 40 mg dose, a high dose range is defined based on PD and safety, including 
dose levels between 60 mg and 90 mg.  In  the healthy subject single- dose studies, there was a 
dose-dependent increase in the qEEG signal (i.e., gamma power induction) across 20 mg and 
90 mg. The most notable effects in gamma power induction were observed in the high dose groups including 60 mg (SC; 6 treated versus 2 placebo) and 90 mg (SC; 6 treated versus 2 
placebo). The 90 mg dose demonstrated a statistically significant effect in the frontal area of the 
brain when compared to placebo (p< 0.05; n=6 treated versus n=6 placebo). In healthy elderly subject studies, the 80 mg dose was evaluated over 9 days ( SC, OD; 4 active versus 1 placebo ),

 with PK results in keeping with dose- linearity,  and supportive safety data.  The 70 mg dose is 
therefore selected in reference to the high dose range defined as 60 mg to 90 mg. 
The selection of the 40 mg and 70 mg doses is  supported by the 26- week Good Laboratory 
Practice ( GLP ) toxicology studies in rats and dogs.  
In summary, the selected doses of 40 mg and 70 mg cover the nonclinical effects  and the clinical 
PD range, were well -tolerated in humans based on safety data from the Phase 1a/b  study, and are 
covered  by the 26-week GLP nonclinical toxicology studies in animals at equivalent doses. The 
doses of ATH-1017 used in this study will support selection of an appropriate dose for 
registration of ATH -1017 as a potential treatment for mild to moderate AD.

4.5 Screen Failures  
Screen failures are defined as subjects who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not subsequently randomly assigned to treatment/entered in the study. A minimal set of screen 
failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure subject s to meet 
the Co nsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials publishing requirements and to respond to 
queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure 
details, eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse event ( SAE ). 
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failures) may not be rescreened  unless the investigator feels that rescreening would be appropriate and has 
discusse d the reason for this with the Medical Monitor. Individuals who are rescreened will 
receive a new screening number.  (Note: clinical laboratory test results, ECGs, and vital signs 
may be repeated during Screening if outside the normal range and not considered clinically significant).

ATH -1017  70 mg  Injection  70 mg /mL SC Patheon  
Placebo  Injection  NA SC Patheon  
NA = not applicable; SC = subcutaneous  
 
Pre-filled syringes of active IMP at 40  mg will contain 1.0 mL of 40 mg/mL ATH-1017 in a 
solution of 10 mM sodium phosphate and 0.5% NaCl . Pre-filled syringes of active IMP  at 70 mg 
will contain 1.0 mL of 70 mg/mL ATH-1017 in a solution of 10 mM sodium phosphate. Each 
pre-filled syringe of placebo will contain 1.0 mL of a solution of 10 mM sodium phosphate and 
1.1% NaCl . All IMPs are  adjusted to pH of approximately 7.6. 
5.2 Supply, Packaging, Labeling, and Storage  
IMP ( ATH-1017 and placebo) will be p rovided as blinded subjec t kits  and will be labeled 
according to applicable local and regulatory requirements. 
IMP will be stored under refrigerated conditions (between 2°C and 8°C) during storage at study 
sites in a securely locked area, accessible to authorized persons only . Once dispensed, study 
subjects may store the product under refrigerated conditions (between 2°C and 8°C) or ambient 
conditions (between 15°C and 25°C, as supported by stability data). 
5.3 Drug Accoun tability, Dispensing, and Destruction  
Randomization and dispensation will be controlled by an interactive response technology ( IRT) 
system . Dispensation will occur every 2 weeks , or as needed, at the study site or by direct- to-
patient shipment. Larger prov ision of study drug will be permitted to accommodate personal 
need, e.g., vacation. Study subject s will be provided with sharps containers for proper disposal of 
used IMP .  
The caregiver/support person will supervise or record daily administration of IMP. E ach site will 
ship any product materials (kits and sharps containers) to a central location for destruction or will 
destruct on- site. Reconciliation of IMP will be managed at each study site.

 5.4 Subject Identification and Randomization  
5.4.1 Screening Numbers  
All screened subjects are assigned a unique Screening Number. The Screening Numbers identify 
subjects from time of Screening until time of randomization. Enrolled subjects who drop out of 
the clinical study before randomization will retain their Sc reening Number. 
5.4.2 Randomization Numbers 
Prior to dosing on Day 1, subjects will be assigned a randomization number generated by an IRT 
system;  the randomization numbers will subsequently be incorporated into the Electronic Data 
Capture (EDC) system . A stratified permuted block randomization procedure will be used 
(stratification will be by screening  MMSE severity: mild (MMSE : 20-24) versus moderate 
(MMSE : 14-19). 
Once a randomization number has been allocated to 1 subject, it may not be assigned to another subject.  
5.5 Administration of Investigational Medicinal Products 
Training on safe and effective use of prefilled syringes will be provided to study subject s and 
caregivers by site staff. Practice syringes (filled with placebo) in kits and injection pads will be  
provided to each site. Capable subjects will be allowed to self-administer upon judgement of site staff; those not capable will require caregiver -assisted administration after deemed capable by 
site staff. If stored at refrigerated conditions, pre- filled syringes should be kept at room 
temperature for at least 30 minutes after taking out of the refrigerator before administering the injection. The first dose will be administered on Day 1 (Visit 2b) at the clinic site; site staff will be expected to observe dose administration on day of study visit to ensure safe and effective use. 
Subjects will remain at the clinic site for 2-hour clinical  observation (±15 minutes). The subject 
may be discharged from the clinic absent any systemic AEs at the 2 -hour timepoint. Should there 
be AEs of a systemic nature, they should be observed an additional 2 hours. They should in all 
cases be discharged only after approval of the investigator. Subsequent visits do not have a 
specified period of observation but in all cases must be discharged by the investigator. Should 
self-administration or caregiver-assisted administration not be judged adequate, a suitable 
caregiver must be identified, otherwise subject discontinuation will be required. 
5.6 Compliance with Investigational Medicinal Product s 
IMP compliance will be determined from daily records of IMP administration recorded by the 
caregiver/support person. If a subject demonstrates consistent poor compliance during the study 
(< 80% ), the i nvestigator should evaluate whether the subject should be discontinued from the 
study, in discussion with the Sponsor. However, subjects who are off drug for ≥  14 consecutive 
days may  be prematurely discontinued from the study, in discussion with the Sponsor.

 The study centers will keep an accurate drug disposition record that specifies the subject kit ID 
number, number of kits dispensed to each subject, and the date of dispensation. 
5.7 Blinding  and Breaking the Blind  
The clinical study will be performed in a double -blind manner. 
The study blind should not be broken except in a medical emergency (where knowledge of the 
IMP administered would affect the treatment of the emergency). The decision to break the blind will be made on a case- by-case basis, at the discreti on of the Principal Investigator in 
collaboration with the Sponsor and Medical Monitor. The applicable Contract Research 
Organization ( CRO ) standard operating procedure (SOP) will be followed for blind breaking 
procedures. 
In the event that an interim analysis would be performed by the DSMB employing an 
independent statistician, adequate measures will be defined in the final SAP and implemented 
with the aim to maintain the blind for all involved in actual study conduct at the Sponsor, the 
CRO, or any vendor. 
After database lock, the overall randomization code will be broken only for reporting purposes. 
5.8 Stopping Criteria  
For all subject s, at any time during the study, study treatment should be discontinued and the 
subject will be withdrawn if any of the following criteria/A Es do not resolve: 
• ALT or AST >  8 × upper limit of normal ( ULN) 
• ALT or AST >  5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks 
• ALT or AST >  3 × ULN and (total bilirubin > 2 × ULN, or international normalized ratio 
[INR] > 1.5) 
• ALT or AST >  3 × ULN with symptoms (the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia > 5%)  
• AEs: 
− Any AE of severe intensity and related causality  
− Any SAE  of related causality  
(Note: causality as determined by the Sponsor) 
• Other clinical laboratory criteria:  
− Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) ≥  3 × ULN (that cannot be attributed to causes other than 
the stu dy treatment; i.e., vigorous exercise) 
− Serum creatinine > 1.5 × ULN

 − A decrease from baseline in hemoglobin concentration > 2 g/dL 
− Absolute neutrophil count < 1,000/ µL 
− Platelets < 50,000/ µL 
• Vital sign criteria:  
− Hypotension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] < 90 mmHg and symptomatic). If 
hypotension is observed during the study and the subject is symptomatic, then a minimum of 2 repeat blood pressure measurements should be obtained approximately 5 minutes apart . The mean of the 3 SBP measurements will be used to determine stopping 
criteria.  
− Tachycardia defined as heart rate (HR) > 120 beats per minute (bpm) lasting longer than 
30 minutes or with impaired consciousness 
• ECG criteri on: 
− QTcF > 500 msec (if prolonged QTcF interval is observed during the study, then a minimum of 2  sets of  repeat ECGs in triplicate should be obtained over a brief period. 
The mean of the 3  sets of ECGs will be used to determine stopping criterion). For QTcF 
readings that are borderline, or difficult to interpret due to e.g., presence of a Branch 
Bundle Block, or in those where the T and U waves are superimposed or connected, a manual, local reading using the same ECG device should be considered to determine applicability of this ECG stopping criterion, in discussion with the Medical Monitor. The 
conditions of determining eligibility should be taken into account when considering the 
ECG stopping criterion. 
In addition, if any of the above criteria are met, the event must be reported and discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
The responsibilities of the independent DSMB will be defined in a DSMB Charter and shall 
include making recommendations regarding continuation of any dose groups (as described in Section  7.3),  and of the study itself . 
5.9 Treatment of Overdose  
Overdose: Unintentional administration of a quantity of the study treatment given per administration or per day that is above the maximum recommended dose according to the protocol for the study treatment. This also takes into account cumulative effects due to overdose. 
There is no prior knowledge of clinical symptoms occurring with ATH-1017 overdose. In case of 
suspected or reported overdose, treatment of any clinical signs will be symptomatic.

Access to study treatment will be limited to the period of participation  in this study and (if 
subjects decide to participate and are eligible) for the dur ation of their participation in the 
optional open-label extension study. 
Subjects who decide not to roll over into the open-label extension study will return to their 
original medication  upon discontinuation of double- blind treatment; tapering off study 
medication is not required. 
The investigator will determine whether additional care is needed after the subjec t completes or 
discontinues from the study.

 6 VARIABLES AND M ETHODS OF ASSESSMENT 
6.1 Screening Assessments  
6.1.1 Mini –Mental State Examination (MMSE)  
The Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE) ( Folstein, 1975) is a widely used test of overall 
cognitive function, assessing memory, orientation and praxis in a short series of tests. The score 
is from 0 to 30 with 30 being the best possible and 0 being the worst possible score. The MMSE is administered at Screening with a score of 14 to 24 inclusive for subject eligibility and at the Pre-baseline visit (Visit 2 a, Day -5 to Day -3). At Pre -baseline visit (Visit 2a, Day -5 to Day -3), 
MMSE should be done first befor e all other assessments.  
6.1.2 Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR)  
The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale ( Hughes, 1982) is a global rating of the function of AD 
subjects assessed in 6 categories: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs , home and hobbies, and personal care. It is based on a semi-structured 
interview conducted with the subject and caregiver. Each category has scores from 0 (no 
symptoms) to 3 (severe) from which the overall CDR global score is derived. The CDR is administered at the Screening visit with a score of 1 or 2 required for subject eligibility. 
6.1.3 Audio Screening  
A brief hearing test will be performed at the Screening visit for the purpose of documenting that 
subjects have adequate hearing to participate in the auditory ERP P300 procedure, i.e., ability to 
hear and differentiate the two different tones, using the centrally provided EEG equipment; 
hearing aid must be removed during the screening hearing test and during EEG recordings. 
6.2 Pharmacodynamic Variables 
Pharmacodynamic variables will consist of  EEG assessm
 ents (ERP P300 and ) perf
ormed 
over approxima
tely 20 minutes, with ERP P300 performed prior to .  
At Pre -baseline visit (Visit 2a, Day -5 to Day -3, no dosing), EEG assessments (ERP P300 and 
) will be
 performed twice approximately 2 hours apart. EEG data should be uploaded for 
quality che
ck immediately after the completion of the Pre -baseline visit (Visit 2a).  
At Baseline/Day 1 (Visit 2b), EEG assessments (ERP P300 and ) wil
l be performed at pre-
dose followi
ng the completion of baseline assessments of ADAS-Cog 11 and COWAT, and before 
the ADCS -CGIC assessment, up to 1.5 hour before dose in clinic. EEG will be assessed post-
dose at approximately 2 (±1) hours after IMP dosing. 
At Visits 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, EEG assessments (ERP P300 and ) will be performed at pre-
dose up to 1 hour befor
e dose in clinic. EEG will be assessed post-dose following the completion

Version 3.00  Page 49 of 87 25-MAY- 2021  
 of ADAS -Cog 11 and COWAT assessments, and before the ADCS -CGIC asse ssment, at 
approximately 2 (±1) hours after IMP dosing. 
At safety follow up (Visit 9, no dosing), EEG assessments (ERP P300 and ) will be 
performed 
following the completion of ADAS- Cog 11 and COWAT.  
6.2.1 ERP P300  
ERP P300 is a method of recording brain activity elicited by external stimuli, e.g., an oddball 
auditory stimulus, and is a well-established functional biomarker, particularly of working memory access ( Ally, 2006). ERP P300 is characterized by a stereotyped  series of voltage 
deflections occurring after the respective odd tone to be counted, with early features 
(< 100 msec) corresponding to unconscious sensory transmission (auditory cortex, N100), and 
later features produced by cognitive processing in the ventral attentional network, i.e., P300, 
referring to the large positive deflection at roughly 300 msec in healthy adults (young or elderly). The P300 latency is sensitive to detecting reduced synaptic transmission related to cognitive 
decline in AD patients and other dementias ( Olichney, 2011). 
To assess the P300 wave (latency and amplitude), the subject has to perform a task related to 
auditory stimuli. The stimulus consists of an oddball paradigm with 2 sound stimuli. Stimuli are 
presented through headphones and au ditory stimulation for P300 will be assesse d in a recording 
lasting up to 10 minute s. 
6.2.2 
6.3 Other
 Variables  
As specified by each assessment scale, a qualified, trained  and certifi ed rater will administer  
questionnaires to the study subject  and/or dedicated support person/caregiver. Rater training and 
certification (as applicable) will occur, and if necessary be repeated, in a standardized manner.  
ADAS -Cog 11 and COWAT assessments shall occur at clinic visi ts in the morning at 
approximately the same time they were performed during the initial Baseline/Day 1 assessment .

 6.3.1 Cognitive Variables 
6.3.1.1 Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale ( ADAS -Cog 11) 
The ADAS -Cog 11 is designed to measure cognitive symptom change in subject s with AD 
(Rosen, 1984). The standard 11 items are word recall , commands, constructional praxis, naming 
objects and fingers, ideational praxis, orientation, word recognition, spoken language ability, 
comprehension of spoken language, word-finding difficulty, and remembering test instructions. The test includes 7  performance items and 4 clinician -rated items, with a total score ranging from 
0 (no impairment) to 70 (severe impairment). Therefore, high er scores indicate more severe 
cognitive impairment.  
Due to known circadian  fluctuations of cognitive capacity ( Hilt, 2015), ADAS -Cog
11 will be 
assessed in the morning at  approximately the same time of day as the baseline assessment for all 
applicable visits . 
ADAS -Cog 11 assessments will be  performed pre -dose at Visit 2 b (Baseline/Day 1 ), and post-
dose at approximately 1 hour (± 30 minutes ) at Visit 3 (Week 2), Visit 4 (Week 6), Visit 5  
(Week 12), Visit 7 (Week 20), Visit 8 /ET (Week 26) , and Visit 9 (Safety follow-up; no dosing).  
6.3.1.2 Controlled Word Association Test (COWAT) 
The Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) is an oral verbal fluency test in which the 
subject is required to make verbal associations to different letters of the alphabet by saying all 
the words which they can think of beginning with a given letter. Individuals are given 1 minute to name as many words as possible beginning with each  of the letters. The procedure is then 
repeated for the remaining two letters ( Benton, 1994; Strauss, 2006). The test score is the total 
number of different words produced for all 3 letters. 
The COWAT will be performed adjacent to the ADAS -Cog
11 assessment , i.e., pre -dose at Visit 
2b (Baseline/Day 1 ), and post-dose at approximately 1 hour (± 30 minutes) at Visit 3 (Week 2), 
Visit 4 (Week 6), Visit 5 (Week 12), Visit 7 (Week 20), Visit 8/ET (Week 26), and Visit 9 
(Safety follow -up; no dosing).  
6.3.2 Disease Condition 
6.3.2.1 Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change 
(ADCS -CGIC)  
The Alzheime r’s Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change 
(ADCS -CGIC) scale is a 7 -point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the 
subject ’s illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the 
intervention and rated as: 1, markedly improved; 2, moderately improved; 3, minimally 
improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, moderately  worse; or 7, markedly worse.  The

support person, and a clinician’s rating review ( Schneider, 1997 ). At study start, using the 
ADCS -CGIC baseline f orm as a guideline, the ADCS -CGIC rater will obtain an integral clinical 
impression of the subject’s status, can apply any formal testing at his/her discretion, and take 
personal notes regarding the subject ’s condition; these will serve as a reference for future change 
ratings. The ADCS- CGIC will be administered by a n experienced  clinician  who will remain 
independent of the subject ’s safety, cognitive and functional outcomes, and will be trained and 
certified for this study. The ADCS- CGIC rater will ideally remain the same individual for all 
ADCS -CGIC ratings. 
ADCS -CGIC assessments will be performed adjacent to ADAS -Cog 11 and COWAT assessments 
pre-dose at Visit 2 b (Baseline/Day 1), post- dose at Visit 5 (Week 12), and post- dose at 
Visit 8/ET (Week 26). 
6.3.2.2 Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – Activities of Daily Living, 23 -item Version 
(ADCS -ADL23) 
The ADCS - ADL23 ( Galasko, 1997) is a 23 -item assessment of functional impairment in terms 
of activities of daily living  administered to the support person/caregiver. It comprises 
23 questions about the subject’s involvement and level of performance across items representing 
daily living. The questions range from basic to instrumental activities of daily living. Each item is rated from the highest level of independent performance to complete loss. The total score 
range is from 0 to 78, with lower scores indicating greater functional impairment. ADCS- ADL23 
assessments will be performed pre -dose at Visit 2 b (Baseline/Day 1), post- dose at Visit 5 (Week 
12), and post- dose at Visit 8/ET ( Week 26).

 (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, support person, or the subject’s legally authorized 
representative).  
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AE 
(see Section 6.4.1.5). 
6.4.1.1 Definitions  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a s tudy subject which does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An AE  can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) , whether or not considered related to the IMP. 
Events meeting the definition of AE include: 
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (e.g., ECGs, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific  
judgment of the investigator (i.e., not related to progression of underlying disease) 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition 
• New condition detected or diagnosed after S creening  even though it may have been 
present in the medical history before the start of the study  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming 
intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.  
Events not meeting the definition of AE include: 
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments that are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the 
investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition 
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms (clearly 
defined) of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the 
subject’s condition

 • Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital) 
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuat ions of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen (note: pre-existing conditions will be recorded as part of the subject’s medical history)  
6.4.1.2 Recording of Adverse Events 
AEs should be collected and recorded for each subject from signing informed consent until the 
end of their participation in the study, i.e., from Screening until the subject has discontinued or 
completed the study, including the post- treatment Safety Follow -up period at the timepoints 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). AEs  identified after signing the ICF  and 
before dosing will be recorded as pre- treatment AEs . If AEs occur, the first concern will be the 
safety of the study subjects. 
AEs may be volunteered spontaneously by the study subject, or discovered by the study staff 
during physical examinations or by asking an open, non-leading question such as ‘How have you 
been feeling since you were last asked?’ All AEs and any required remedial action will be recorded. The nature of AE, date (and time, if known) of AE onset, date (and time, if known) of 
AE outcome to date, severity , and action taken  of the AE will be record ed together with the 
investigator’s assessment of the seriousness of the AE and causal relationship to IMP and/or 
study procedure on an AE electronic case report form ( eCRF ).  
When an AE/SAE occurs, i t is the responsibility of the investigator to review all
 documentation 
(e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) related to the event. It is not  acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the subject’s medical records to the 
sponsor in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE eCRF page. 
There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by the 
Sponsor and/or CRO . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant 
number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission. 
All AEs should be recorded individually in the study subject’s own words (verbatim) unless, in 
the opinion of the investigator, the AEs constitute components of a recognized condition, disease or syndrome. In the latter case, the condition, disease or syndrome should be named rather than 
each individual symptom.

 6.4.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Events  
Each AE will be assessed by the investigator with regard to the categories discussed in the 
sections below. 
Intensity  
The investigator will assess all AEs for severity in accordance with the following standard 
ratings: 
• Mild: Ordinarily transient symptoms, do es not influence performance of subject’s daily 
activities. Treatment is not ordinarily indicated  or may be minimal. 
• Moderate: Marked symptoms, sufficient to make the subject uncomfortable. Moderate 
influence on performance of subject’s daily activities. T reatment may be necessary  to 
alleviate symptoms . 
• Severe: Symptoms cause considerable discomfort. Substantial influence on subject’s daily activities, or significantly affects clinical status . May be unable to continue in the 
study and intensive treatment may be necessary.  
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity recorded for the event should be noted. 
Note: an event is defined as serious  when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE (see later), NOT when it is rated as severe.  
Causality 
The investigator will assess the causality/relationship between the AE and IMP/study procedure. 
One of the categories described in Table 3  should be selected based on medical judgment, 
considering the definitions below and all contributing factors. In this study AEs will be 
considered related to IMP/study procedure if causality is ascribed as either related, probably 
related, or possibly rel ated.  
For each AE/SAE, the investigator must  document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed 
the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. 
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to  include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, it is very important that 
the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor.  
The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information and 
send an SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment.

 The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements  
 
Table 3 Assessment of Relationship of Adverse Events to IMP/Study Procedure  
Related  
 A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, which occurs in a 
plausible time relationship to treatment administration, and which concurrent 
disease or other drugs or chemicals cannot explain. The response to withdrawal 
of the treatment (dechallenge*) should be clinically plausible. The event must be 
definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory 
rechallenge† procedure if necessary.  
Probably related  
 A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to administration of the treatment, unlikely to be attributed to 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a clinically 
reaso nable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is 
not required to fulfill this definition.  
Possibly related  
 A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to administration of the treatment, but which could also be explained 
by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. Information on treatment 
withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Unlikely to be 
related  
 A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationsh ip to treatment administration which makes a causal relationship 
improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide 
plausible explanations.  
Unrelated  
 A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no te mporal 
relationship with treatment administration. May have negative dechallenge and 
rechallenge information. Typically explained by extraneous factors (e.g., 
concomitant disease, environmental factors or other drugs or chemicals).  
*Dechallenge is when a drug suspected of causing an AE is discontinued. If the symptoms of the AE disappear partially 
or completely, within a reasonable time from drug discontinuation, this is termed a positive dechallenge. If the 
symptoms continue despite  withdrawal of the drug, this is termed a negative dechallenge. Note that there are 
exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet drug- relatedness clearly exists (for 
example, as in bone marrow suppression, fixed drug eruptions, or tardive dyskinesia).  
†Rechallenge is when a drug suspected of causing an AE in a specific subject in the past is readministered to that subject. If the AE recurs upon exposure, this is termed a positive rechallenge. If the AE does not recur, this is termed 
a negative rechallenge.  
 
Seriousness  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death. 
• Is life -threatening; this means that the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; 
it does not mean that th e event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.  
Athira Pharma , Inc.  
Protocol ATH- 1017- AD-0202  Clinical Study Protocol  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version 3.00  Page 57 of 87 25-MAY- 2021  
 • Requires hospitalization or prolongation in existing hospitalization; in general, 
hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least 
an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that 
would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting.  
Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether hospitalization occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. 
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE. 
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions. 
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor me dical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or 
• Is another important medical event (see below)  
Important medical events that do not result in death, are not life-threatening or do not require 
hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include invasive or malignant 
cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity whereas seriousn ess is defined by the criteria above. For example, a mild degree of 
gastrointestinal bleeding requiring an overnight hospitalization for monitoring purposes would be considered an SAE, but is not necessarily severe. Similarly, an AE that is severe in intensity is not necessarily an SAE. For example, headache may be assessed as severe in intensity but would not be considered an SAE. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding if an AE is serious and if 
expedited reporting is appropriate.

 6.4.1.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Prompt (within 24 hours) notification by the investigator to Sponsor’s designated Drug Safety 
and Pharmacovigilance vendor, i.e., MMS, of an SAE is essential so that legal obligations and 
ethical responsibilities towards  the safety of participants and the safety of a study treatment 
under clinical investigation are met.  
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to 
the regulatory authority, institutional review boards (IRBs) /independent ethics committees 
(IECs) , and investigators. 
The investigator will review each SAE and evaluate the intensity and the causal relationship of 
the event to IMP/study procedure. All SAEs will be recorded from signing of informed consent 
until completion of the Safety Follow-up. SAEs occurring after the Safety Follow -up Visit and 
coming to the attention of the investigator must be reported only if there is (in the opinion of the 
investigator) reasonable causal relationship with the IMP. 
The investigator is responsible for updating the EDC and  providing notification to the MMS 
Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance of any SAE, whether deemed IMP -related or not, that a 
subject experience during their participation in study within 24 hours of becoming aware of the 
event  to: 
Email:  drugsafety@athira.com
 
Fax:  1-425-620-8508 
The MMS Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance is responsible for providing notification to the Sponsor of any SAE as soon as they become aware of the event. 
As a minimum requirement, the initial notification should provide the following information: 
• Identifiable subject  
• Identifiable event  (including causality assessment)  
• Identifiable IMP  
• Identifiable reporter  
The MMS Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance will request clarification of omitted or discrepant 
information from the initial notification. The Principal Investigator or an authorized designee is 
responsible for faxing or emailing the requested information to the MMS Drug Safety and 
Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the request.

Version 3.00  Page 59 of 87 25-MAY- 2021  
 It is not  acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the subject’s medical records to 
the sponsor in lieu of appropriate completion of SAE Report Form. Additional information (copy 
of lab reports, consultant reports, copy of discharge summaries, etc.) should be provided on 
request of MMS Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance.  
If a new SAE Report Form is faxed or emailed, then the Principal Investigator must sign and date 
the form. Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete and sign the SAE Report Form within the designated reporting time frames. Contacts for SAE reporting can be found on the protocol title page. 
All SAE reports submitted by Investigator will be reviewed by study Sponsor and as sessed  for 
meeting criteria of S uspected U nexpected Serious A dverse R eactions  (SUSARs).  All SUSARs 
will be reported by Sponsor to Competent National Authorities and Investigators according to 
local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy. 
An investigator who receives an Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) describing a SUSAR  or 
other specific safety information (e .g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will 
review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB /IEC , if 
appropriate according to local requirements . 
6.4.1.5 Follow-up of Adverse Events 
All AEs experienced by a subject, irrespective of the suspected causality  or seriousness , will be 
monitored until the event has resolved, until any abnormal laboratory values have returned to 
baseline or stabilized at a level acceptable to the investigator  and Medical Monitor, until there is 
a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed or until t he subject is lost to follow -up. If a 
subject is lost to follow -up and has not answered any phone calls from the site (at least 3 calls), a 
final proof of contact via certified letter is required (see Section 7.6).  
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by the Sponsor and/or 
CRO to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals. 
6.4.2 Pregnancy 
The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male participant’s female 
partner who becomes pregnant while the male participant is in this study.  Only female subjects 
of non-childbearing potential (i.e., permanently sterilized, postmenopausal) are eligible for 
participation.  
After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner directly, 
the investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to the 
MMS Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s

Version 3.00  Page 60 of 87 25-MAY- 2021  
 pregnancy. The female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. 
Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor . Generally, 
the follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. Any 
termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of 
anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs. 
6.4.3 Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
The following laboratory variables will be determined by a central laboratory, as outlined in 
Table 4 below:

 Child -Pugh class B and C (i.e., including total bilirubin, albumin, and INR values), will be 
exclusionary. F or transaminase liver enzymes, a repeat laboratory assessment may be performed 
if outside of the normal range. If the transaminase s remain elevated the investigator should 
consider stopping study medication and withdrawing the subject as described in Section  5.8. 
A medical  alert for potential Hy’s  laws cases (possible drug-induced liver injury) will be issued 
based on lab values and supported by Medical Monitor interpretation. Investigators, the Sponsor, 
Medical Monitor , and MMS - Sponsor’s designated CRO for Drug 
Safety and Pharmacovigilance (drugsafety@athira.com) will immediately be notified when the 
above criteria have been met  through a central lab oratory  alert. The AE eCRF should be 
completed within 3  business days. Every effort to determine the cause of the liver enzyme 
abnormalities must be made, and close monitoring should be initiated in conjunction with the 
Medical Monitor and in accordance with the FDA Guidance for Industry, Drug-Induced Liver 
Injury: Pre marketing Clinical Evaluation, July 2009. 
Criteria for potential Hy’s law cases are as follows:  
• ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN AND  
• Total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN AND  
• Alkaline phosphatase < 2 × ULN  
Typically, all 3  analytes will be obtained from the same sample, but th ey may come from 
multiple samples taken within a 24 -hour period. This requirement applies from the time the 
subject signs the ICF for the study until 4 weeks after the final protocol-defined study visit or the 
last known dose of study treatment (if the final visit does not occur). 
Any clinically significant abnormalities from Screening  labs must be discussed with the Medical 
Monitor to confirm eligibility of the subject. Additional testing during the study may be done if 
medically indicated. If a clinically significant abnormality is found in the samples taken after dosing, during the study, and/or at the safety f ollow -up visit, it should be recorded as an AE and 
the subject will be followed until the test(s) has (have) normalized or stabilized.  
6.4.4 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be assessed  pre-dose at the timepoints detailed in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 1). The following vital signs will be measured:  
• Blood pressure (supine ) (systolic and diastolic [mmHg])  
• Orthostatic  blood pressure (systolic and diastolic [mmHg])) 
• Heart rate (bpm)  
• Body temperature (°C) (oral, tympanic , temporal, or forehead infrared )

Version 3.00  Page 62 of 87 25-MAY- 2021  
 • Respiratory rate (breaths per minute) 
Supine BP and HR recordings will be made after the subject has been supine for at least  
5 minutes.  
Orthostatic blood pressure will be recorded as specified in Table 1 . The firs t blood pressure will 
be the average of 3 measurements recorded  after the subject is supine for 5 minutes; the second 
blood pressure will be recorded after the subject has  stood for up to 3 minutes. A drop in blood 
pressure of ≥  20 mmHg, or in diastolic blood pressure of ≥  10 mmHg will be considered 
abnormal. 
6.4.5 Weight  
Weight will be measured at Screening (for calculation of BMI as part of the eligibility criteria), 
at Baseline/Day 1 (Visit 2b), Visit 5 (Week 12), Visit 8 (Week 26), and Visit 9 (Safety follow-up). 
6.4.6 12-Lead Electrocardiogram 
Standard safety 12- lead ECGs will be performed pre -dose and 30 (± 15) minutes post-dose on 
Day 1 and 30 (± 15) minutes post-dose at all other visits . All ECGs will be performed  in 
triplicate approximately 1 minute apart, as  detailed in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). 
The 12-lead ECGs will be performed after the subject has been resting supine for ≥  5 minutes. 
The ECG will include all 12 standard leads and a Lead II rhythm strip on the bottom of the 
tracing. The following ECG parameters will be collected: PR interval, QRS interval, RR interval, QT interval,  and QTcF . 
All ECGs must be evaluated by the investigator or qualified designee for the presence of abnormalities.  Collection and analysis of ECG  data will be performed by a central ECG vendor. 
For QTcF readings that are borderline, or difficult to interpret due to e.g., presence of a Branch Bundle Block, or in those where the T and U waves are superimposed or connected, a manual, local reading using the same ECG device should be considered, in discussion with the Medical Monitor. 
6.4.7 Physical and Neurological Examination 
Physical and neurological examination will be performed by the investigator or designee at the 
timepoints detailed in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). 
The physical examination inc ludes an assessment of general appearance and a review of systems 
(dermatologic, head, eyes, ears, nose, mouth/throat/neck, thyroid, lymph nodes, respiratory, 
cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, extremities, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and psychiatric 
syste ms). 
Body weight (kg) and height (meters) will be assessed at S creening. Body weight and height will 
be used to calculate body mass index using the following formula: weight (kg)/[height (m)]

 Neurological components include, but are not limited to, the following assessments: mental 
status, cranial nerves, muscle strength, tone, and bulk, reflexes, coordination, sensory function, and gait. 
6.4.8 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The C -SSRS will be performed at Screening, Baseline/Day 1  (Visit 2b) , Visit 3 (Week  2), Visit 4 
(Week  6), Visit 5 (Week  12), Visit 7 (Week  20), Visit 8/ET , and Visit 9 (Safety follow -up) 
(Week 26) ( Table 1 ). The  C-SSRS supports suicide risk assessment through a series of simple, 
plain -language questions. The responses assist in identifying whether a subject is at risk for 
suicide, assesses the severity and immediacy of that risk, and gauge the level of support that the 
subject may require. If items 1 to 5 of the C- SSRS have a positive response and are of clinical 
concern, as judged by the investigator during the study, the Medical Monitor must be contacted. 
6.4.9 Geriatric  Depression Scale (GDS)  
The GDS is a self -report measure of depression in older adults with a “Yes/No” response format. 
The GDS was originally developed as a 30-item instrument. It has since been validated in a 
shortened form comprising 15 items ( Sheikh, 1986). The total score range is 0 to 15, with a 
higher score indicating more severity. A GDS score of ≤  7 is required at Screening. In discussion 
with the Medical Monitor, subjects with a GDS score between 8 and 10 inclusive can be 
considered for study participation if the increased score is driven by specific domains related to 
the pandemic and its restrictions, rather than by major depression. 
GDS assessments will be performed at Screening, Baseline/Day 1  (Visit 2b) , Visit 5 (Week 12),  
Visit 8/ET (Week 26), and Visit 9 (Safety follow -up). 
6.5 Pharmacokinetic Variables  
Blood will be collected for PK analyses at the timepoints detailed in Table 1. The actual time of 
PK sampling will be recorded. 
Blood sample collection, processing, and shipping details will be outlined in a separate 
laboratory manual. In brief, blood will be processed and plasma analyzed by a validated method 
for concentrations of ATH-1017 and ATH-1001. PK parameters will be calculated from the 
plasma concentration -actual time profiles. The noncompartmental analysis , if feasible,  will be 
performed using WinNonlin version 7.0. Plasma concentrations may also be used for population PK analysis, the results of which will be reported separately. 
6.6 Genotyping 
Blood sample(s) will be collected at Screening for analysis of ApoE genotype.

 7 STUDY CONDUCT  
• Study procedures and thei r timing are summarized in the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 
1). 
• Protocol exemptions related to enrollment criteria  are only allowed with prior 
Investigator and Sponsor approval, supported by documented agreement from the 
IRB/IEC . 
• Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the subject should continue or discontinue study 
treatment.  
• Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in t he Schedule of 
Assessment s, is essential and required for study conduct. 
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential subjects meet all eligibility criteria. Screening procedures may be conducted on up to 2 separate dates if necessary to accommodate subject and study center schedule. However, every effort should be made to conduct all procedures as early as possible in the screening period. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of 
all subjects  screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as 
applicable.  
• Due to the quantitative functional biomarker nature of this study, particular precautions 
will have to be implemented at each site for the electrophysical assessments, i.e. 
availability of a dedicated quiet EEG room with  controlled lighting and temperature. 
7.1 Schedule and Order of Assessments 
The study will consist of up to 28 days of S creening
  (Day  -28 through Day -6) , a Pre -baseline 
visit (Visit 2 a, Day  -5 to Day -3), during which subjects will undergo an MMSE assessment, and  
2 baseline EEG assessments ( ERP P300 and ) approxi
mately 2 hours apart, Baseline (Visit 
2b, Day  1, randomi
zation), followed by 26 weeks of double- blind treatmen t, and a 4 -week safety 
follow-up. Note: if 28 days is not sufficient to complete the screening  period, the possibility of 
an extension can be discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
All asses
sments to be performed during the study are detailed by visit/timepoint in Table 1 . 
For key endpoints, the general order post-dose should be followed: 
(1) ADAS -Cog 11 
(2) COWAT

Protocol ATH- 1017- AD-0202  Clinical Study Protocol  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version 3.00  Page 66 of 87 25-MAY- 2021  
 (3) EEG assessments ( ERP P300 and ) 
(4) ADCS -CGIC  
At Pre -baseline visit (Visit 2a, Day -5 to Day -3), MMSE should be done first before all other 
assessments.  
ADAS -Cog 11 and COWAT assessments shall occur at clinic visits in the morning at 
approximately the same time they were performed during the initial Baseline/Day 1 assessment. 
ADAS -Cog 11 and COWAT assessments will be performed  pre-dose at Baseli ne/Day 1 (Visit 2 b), 
and post-dose at approximately 1 hour (± 30 minutes ) at Week 2 (Visit 3), Week 6 (Visit 4) 
Week 12 (Visit 5), Week 20 (Visit 7), and Week 26 (Visit 8); and additionally at Safety follow 
up (visit 9; no dosing). 
EEG assessments shall oc cur shortly after the completion of ADAS -Cog 11 and COWAT 
assessments, and before the ADCS- CGIC assessment at applicable visits. EEG assessments will 
be performed at Pre -baseline (Visit 2a), Baseline/Day 1 (Visit 2b), Week 2 (Visit 3), Week 6 
(Visit 4), Wee k 12 (Visit 5), Week 16 (Visit 6), Week 20 (Visit 7), Week 26 (Visit 8), and safety 
follow up (Visit 9, no dosing). 
ADCS -CGIC assessments will be organized at adjacent times to the individual EEG  assessment 
times at Baseline/Day 1 (Visit 2), and post-dose at Week 12 (Visit 5), and Week 26 (Visit 8). PK plasma samples will be collected at post-dose at Baseline/Day 1 (Visit 2); pre -dose and post-
dose at Week 12 (Visit 5) and Week 2 6 (Visit 8). The pre- dose PK sample is collected anytime 
before dosing. The post- dose PK sample is collected anytime between 30 minutes and 120 
minutes after dosing as practical .. The actual time of dosing and of PK sampling will be 
recorded.  
The order of assessments for all other endpoints is flexible. 7.1.1 Unscheduled Visit(s)  
An unscheduled visit may be performed at any time during the study as deemed necessary by the 
investigator. The date and reason for the unscheduled visit will be recorded. AE monitoring and 
concomitant medication recording should be performed by the investigator. Other procedures and evaluations will be completed as deemed necessary by the investigator and may include (but 
not limited to) laboratory tests, ECG, vital signs , and physical examination. Please ensure to 
discuss with the Medical Monitor prior to conducting any unscheduled visit. 
7.2 Pandemic Response  
In the event of a pandemic that impacts study conduct, the following protocol changes will be 
implemented should the situation arise (implementation should  be discussed on a case -by-case 
basis, with sponsor approval):

 • Visits 1 (Screening), 2 ( Pre-baseline, Day -5 to Day -3; Ba seline/Day 1), 5 (Week 12), 
8 (Week 26),  and 9 (Safety follow-up) are considered essential visits , and these visits 
need to be conducted on-site, with proper site arrangements to protect the safety of study 
participants and site staff, including personal protection equipment, proper spacing 
between subjects to avoid crowding and allow proper cleaning, transportation arrangements, etc. (full details will be agreed with the CRO and study sites)  
• Visits 3 (Week 2), 4 (Week 6), 6 (Week 16), and 7 (Week 20) should be conducted on-site if conditions permit, but flexibility will be allowed upon agreement between sites, 
CRO, and sponsor. These visits are to be completed according to one of the following options: 
a. On-site visit with proper safety arrangements 
b. Site staff visit to the subject at home  
c. Travel nurse visits the subjec t at home  
d. Tele-health using phone, video call, or others 
e. Subject goes to local lab oratory  for biological samples to be taken  
7.3 Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB will conduct periodic review and assessments of un blinded safety data 
(AEs, labs, ECG, etc) throughout the study to ensure the safety of study subjects. Based on unblinded safety data review, the DSMB may  recommend terminating the study. 
The DSMB is  composed of at least a study-independent non-Sponsor physician and a 
study- independent statistician. Additional members have been  included and ad hoc members 
may also be invited depending on the safety findings and required scope of expertise. 
Details regarding the DSMB are included in the DSMB charter, including committee 
membership, data review procedures, frequency of review, and communication between the 
DSMB and others.

7.5 Subject Withdrawal 
A subject’s participation in the study may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the 
investigator and/or Sponsor, in accordance with his/her best professional judgment. However, it is encouraged that the investigator contact the Sponsor, when possible, to discuss possible 
reasons for discontinuation prior to withdrawing a subject from the study. Notification of early 
subject discontinuation from the study and the reason for discontinuation will be made to the Sponsor and will be clearly documented on the appropriate eCRF. 
7.5.1 Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
All subjects who permanently discontinue study treatment, for whatever reason, will be 
withdrawn from the study. Upon discontinuation of study drug, subjec ts will continue with their 
original treatment ; tapering off study medication is not required. 
See th e schedule of activities for data to be collected at the time of treatment discontinuation and 
follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed ( Table 1 ). 
7.5.2 Withdrawal from the Study 
• A subject may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request, or may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, 
compliance, or administrative reasons, including protocol deviations 
• Subjects must be discontinued from the study and/or receive no further study treatment, if any of the following criteria are met :

Protocol ATH- 1017- AD-0202  Clinical Study Protocol  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version 3.00  Page 71 of 87 25-MAY- 2021  
 o Any of the stopping criteria described in Section  5.8 
o Any AE or safety finding that may jeopardize the subject’s health in the 
investigator’s judgment, and which is considered to be at least possibly related to the 
study drug. 
o Withdrawal of informed consent by subject/legally authorized representative. In the 
event that a subject’s decision to withdraw from the study is motivated by adverse event(s) or stated lack of efficacy, these reasons should be recorded as the r eason for 
early termination.  
o Physician decision 
o Non-compliance with study drug 
o Site terminated by sponsor 
o Repeat incapacity of subject and/or caregiver (in the judgment of the investigator) to 
properly administer study drug despite training and testing 
o Prolonged or definitive loss of caregiver without adequate replacement 
o Nursing home placement 
• If the subject withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may 
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of cons ent. 
• If a subject withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples 
taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. 
• All subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study, i.e., prior to Visit 8 (Week 26), unless the cause is screen failure, should return for an early termination visit and 
complete all the assessments schedul ed for the Week 26 visit (Visit 8); see the schedule 
of activities ( Table 1 ) for data  to be collected . 
• Unless the reasons of premature discontinuation prevent further meaningful testing, 
investigators should make every effort to motivate subjects who discontinue early (and 
caregiver) to return for a Visit 8  (Week 26)  for final assessments . 
Upon discontinuation of study drug, subjec ts will continue with their original treatment ; tapering 
off study medication is not required.

 7.6 Lost to Follow- up 
A subject  will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. 
The following actions must be taken if a subject fails to return to the clinic for a required study 
visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact the subject and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to and/or should continue in the 
study. 
• Before a subject is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the subject (where possible, 3 telephone calls /emails , 
and if necessary, a certified letter to the subject’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the subject’s study record s. 
• Should the subject continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up. 
7.7 Termination of the Clinical Study  
The Sponsor designee reserves the right to close the study site(s) or terminate the study at any 
time for any reason at the sole discretion of the Sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study 
completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study-site closure visit has been performed. 
The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor or investigator may include but are 
not limited to:  
• Failure of t he investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB /IEC  
or local health authorities, the Sponsor’s procedures, or Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) 
guidelines 
• Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator 
• Discontinuation of further study treatment development

 8 STATISTICAL M ETHODS  
Before database lock, a statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be issued as a separate document, 
providing detailed methods for the analyses outlined below. Any deviations from the planned 
analyses will be  described and justified in the clinical study report. 
8.1 Populations for Analysis 
8.1.1 MITT population 
The modified intent- to-treat (mITT) population will include all randomized subjects  who took at 
least one dose of the study medication and who completed at least one ERP  P300 baseline 
assessment and one post- baseline ERP P300 assessment . Subjects will be analyzed according to 
the dose they were randomized  to. 
8.1.2 Per protocol population 
The per protocol population will include all mITT subjects who took the assigned medication 
during the 26 weeks of treatment, completed at least one ERP P300 plus ADAS -Cog 11 and/or 
COWAT post- baseline assessment , and did not have any major protocol deviations. Subjects will 
be analyzed based on actual treatment received . 
8.1.3 Safety population 
The Safety population will include all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of the study medication. Subjec ts will be analyzed based on actual treatment received.  
8.2 General Considerations  
Descriptive statistics for continuous variables will include number of subjects (n), arithmet ic 
mean, standard deviation , median, minimum, maximum and first and third quartile limits unless 
otherwise noted. Frequency and pe rcentage will be calculated for categorical variables.  
Change from baseline is calculated by subtracting the baseline score from the observed value at 
any subsequent visit. For safety summaries, the last pre-randomization measurement is defined 
as the baseline value. For the primary variable of ERP P300, Pre- baseline and Baseline visit 
assessments will be used for change from baseline comparisons. For other measures, baseline is defined as the last pre-randomization measurement. 
Percentages are based on the number of subjects in each treatment group in the given population 
for AE summary tables, and additionally  overall for medical history, prior and concomitant 
medications. For all other tables, percentages are based on the number of subjects with non-missi ng data in each treatment group and overall for the given population.

 8.3 Analyses 
8.3.1 Primary Analysis – ERP P300  Latency  
The primary analysis will use a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) to compare the 
estimated changes between active treatment and placebo in ERP P300 latency. These analyses 
will assess whether or not there is a difference in estimated changes between treatment groups 
and placebo at Weeks 2, 6, 12, 16, 20, and 26. Further details relating to the primary analysis will be described in the SAP.  
8.3.2 Secondary Analysis  
8.3.2.1 Correlation of ERP P300 with ADAS-Cog
11 and COWAT 
Secondary analyses will include an evaluation of the correlation of ERP P300 latency with 
cognition/executive memory function, and comparison of treatment and placebo for the Global 
Statistical Test (GST), ADAS -Cog 11, ADCS -CGIC, and ADCS -ADL23, which will be described 
in the SAP. 
8.3.3 Exploratory Analyses 
8.3.4 Subgroup Analyses  
Subgroup analyses (e.g., gender, age, MMSE score, ApoE genotype ) will be performed in the 
mITT population. 
8.4 Safety Summari es 
The Safety population will be used for analyses of each of the safety endpoints. All concomitant 
medications will be tabulated according to drug class and preferred term using the World Health Organization Drug dictionary. Clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical and neurological examination s, and ECG results will b e summarized by number of subjec ts, frequency rates and 
by treatment group. The timepoint of each event will also be summarized. 
8.4.1 Adverse Events  
AEs occurring after the start of study drug dosing at on Day 1 will be summarized descriptively 
for the Safety population. All AEs will be coded according to system organ cla ss and preferred 
term using a Medical Dictionary f or Regulatory Activities d ictionary. Summary tables showing 
the number of subjects  and percent within each category will be generated for each of the 
following types of AEs :  
• All events

Weight  data (observed and change from baseline) will be listed for each subject by visit. 
Observed values and change from baseline will be summarized descriptively. 
8.4.4 12-Lead Electrocardiogram 
12-lead ECG data (observed and change from baseline) will be listed for each subject by visit. 
Observed values and change from baseline will be summarized descriptively.  
8.4.5 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
Results from the C- SSRS questionnaire will be listed and summarized using descriptive statistics 
by treatment group a nd visit.  
8.4.6 Geriatric Depression Scale 
Results from the GDS questionnaire will be listed and summarized using descriptive statistics by 
treatment group and visit . 
8.5 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
PK analyses will be described in a separate document finalized before database lock. The PK analyses  will be presented separately from the main clinical study report. 
8.6 Determination of Sample Size 
A total sample size of 60 evaluable subjects (20 per treatment arm) is based on the results of the 
Phase 1 study, NDX-1017-0101, which demonstrated significant effects of ATH-1017 on ERP 
P300 in n= 7 ATH-1017- treated AD subjects versus n= 4 placebo -treated AD subjects.

 9 ETHICAL, LEGAL, AND A DMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS  
9.1 Data Quality Assurance 
The CRO/ Sponsor will conduct a study initiation visit to verify the qualifications of the 
investigator , inspect the facilities, and inform the investigator of responsibilities and procedures 
for ensuring adequate and correct documentation. 
The investigator must prepare and maintain adequate and accurate records of all observations 
and other data pertinent to the clinical study for each study subject . 
Audio recording for certain clinical assessments, including MMSE, CDR, ADAS -Cog 11, and 
ADCS -CGIC will take place for rating quality control purpose. No personal identifying 
information will be included in the recording. 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that data are properly recorded on each subject’s 
eCRF and rel ated documents in a timely manner. An investigator who has signed the protocol 
signature page should electronically sign for the eCRFs (as indicated in the eCRFs) to ensure that the observations and findings are recorded on the eCRFs correctly and completely. The eCRFs are to be submitted in a timely manner, or as otherwise specified by the Sponsor, and will be maintained in a central data repository.  
Frequent communication between the clinical site and the CRO/ Sponsor is essential to ensure 
that the safety  of the study is monitored adequately. The investigator will make all appropriate 
safety assessments on an ongoing basis. The Medical Monitor may review safety information as it becomes available throughout the study. 
All aspects of the study will be caref ully monitored with respect to GCP and SOPs for 
compliance with applicable government regulations. The Study Monitor will be an authorized 
individual designated by the Sponsor. The Study Monitor will have access to all records necessary to ensure integrity of the data and will periodically review the progress of the study 
with the Principal Investigator.  
Records and documents, including signed ICFs, pertaining to the conduct of this study must be 
retained by the investigator at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an International Council for Harmonisation ( ICH) region and until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 2 years have elapsed since the 
formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IMP. These documents should be retained 
for a longer period however if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an 
agreement with the Sponsor. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the investigator/institu tion as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. No records 
may be destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of the Sponsor. No records may be transferred to another location or party without written notification to t he 
Sponsor.

 9.2 Access to Source Data/Documents  
Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the subject and substantiate the integrity 
of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the investigator’s site.  
The investigator will ensure the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the data reported to the Sponsor. Data reported or entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records. Also, current medical records must be available.  
Data collection processes and procedures will be reviewed and validated to ensure completeness, accuracy, reliability, and consistency. A complete audit trail will be maintained of all data changes. The investigator or designee will cooperate with the Sponsor’s representative(s) for the periodic review of study documents to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data capt ure 
system at each scheduled monitoring visit.  
Electronic consistency checks and manual review will be used to identify any errors or inconsistencies in the data. This information will be provided to the respective study sites by means of electronic or manual queries.  
The investigator or designee will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate study documents (medical records, ECGs, AE , and concomitant medication reporting, raw data collection forms, 
as well as the results of diagnostic tests such as x -rays and laboratory tests) designed to record all 
observations and other pertinent data for each subject receiving IMP. 
The investigator will allow Sponsor representatives, contract designees, authorized regulatory 
authority inspectors and the IRB /IEC  to have direct access to all documents pertaining to the 
study. 
9.3 Archiving Study Documents  
According to ICH guidelines, essential documents should be retained for a minimum of 2 years 
after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IMP. However, these documents should be retained for a longer period if required by t he applicable legal requirements.  
9.4 Good Clinical Practice  
The procedures set out in this clinical study protocol are designed to ensure that the Sponsor and the investigator abide by the ICH  Tripartite Guideline for GCP (E6) and with other applicable 
regulatory requirements. The clinical study also will be carried out in keeping with national and

Version 3.00  Page 79 of 87 25-MAY- 2021  
 local legal requirements (in accordance with United States Investigational New D rug 
Regulations [21 CFR 56]).  
9.5 Informed Consent  
Before each subject is enrolled in th e clinical study, written informed consent will be obtained 
from the subject or his/her legally authorized representative (LAR) according to the applicable 
regulatory and le gal requirements.  As part of this procedure, the investigator or appropriately 
qualified designee must explain orally and in writing (when possible) the nature, duration, and purpose of the study and the action of the IMP in such a manner that the study subject is aware of 
the potential risks, inconveniences, or AEs  that may occur , and answer all questions regarding 
the study. The study subject should be informed that their participation is voluntary and that 
he/she is free to withd raw from the study at any time. If a subject, LAR , and caregiver/support 
person is not able to review consent in person at the clinic due to travel restrictions, documented 
oral review by the investigator or appropriately qualified designee with the subject, LAR, and 
caregiver/support person must occur and be documented in the subject’s stu dy records. 
Subjects  or their LAR will be required to sign a statement of informed consent that meets the 
requirements of 21 CFR 50, local regulations, ICH guidelines, Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act requirements, where applicable, and the IRB /IEC  or study center . The 
investigator or designee will provide the CRO  with a copy of the IRB /IEC -approved ICF prior to 
the start of the study. 
The informed consent document must be signed and dated; the authorized person obtaining the 
informed consent must also sign the ICF. One copy will be provided to the subject/LAR and to 
the caregiver/support person, and the investigator will retain a copy as part of the clinical study 
records.  
If the caregiver/support person is different from the LAR, a specific ICF must be explained and 
this person be consented to the tasks and duties during the study; since many assessments rely 
only on the input from the caregiver/support person, it is important they understand fully their role in the trial. The investigator will not undertake any investigation specifically required for the clinical study until written consent has been obtained. The terms of the consent and when it was obtained must also be documented.  
If a protocol amendment is required, then the informed consent document (s) may need to be 
revised to reflect the changes to the protocol. If the informed consent document(s) are revised, 
they must be reviewed and approved by the responsible IRB/ IEC, and signed by all subjects/ 
LARs/caregiver/support persons subsequently enrolled in the clinical study as well as those 
currently enrolled in the clinical study.

 9.6 Protocol Approval and Amendment(s) 
Before the start of the clinical study, the clinical s tudy protocol and other relevant documents 
will be approved by the IRB /IEC , in accordance with local legal requirements. The Sponsor must 
ensure that all ethical and legal requirements have been met before the first subject is enrolled in 
the clinical stud y. 
This protocol is to be followed exactly. To alter the protocol, amendments must be written, which must be released by the Sponsor and receive IRB /IEC  approval prior to i mplementation 
(as appropriate).  
Administrative changes may be made without the need for a formal amendment, but will also be mentioned in the integrated clinical study report. All amendments will be distributed to all study protocol recipients, with appropriate instructions. 
9.7 Confidentiality Data Protection 
All clinical study findings and documents will be regarded as confidential . Study documents 
(protocols, Investigator Brochure s, and other material) will be stored appropriately to ensure 
their confidentiality. The investigator and members of his/her research team (including the 
IRB/IEC ) must not disclose such information without prior written approval from the Sponsor, 
except to the extent necessary to obtain informed consent from subjects who wish to participate in the trial or to comply with regulatory requirements. 
The anonymity of participating subjects must be maintained. Subjects will be specified on study 
documents by their subject number, initial or birth date, not by name. Documents that identify 
the subject (e.g., the signed informed consent document) must be maintained in confidence by 
the investigator. The subject must be informed that his/her personal study- related data will be 
used by the Sponsor in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be explained to the subject/LAR. 
9.8 Publication Policy  
By signing the clinical study protocol, the investigator agrees with the use of results of the 
clinical study for the purposes of national and international registration, publication, and information for medical and pharmaceutical professionals. If necessary, the competent authorities will be notified of the investigator’s name, address, qualifications, and extent of 
involvement. 
The sponsor has proprietary interest in this study. Authorship and manuscript composition will 
reflect joint cooperation between multiple investigators and sites and Sponsor personnel. Authorship will be established prior to the writing of the manuscript. As this study involves 
multiple centers, no individual publications will be allowed prior to completion of the final 
report of th e multicenter study except as agreed with the Sponsor.

 The Sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results. In accordance 
with standard editorial and ethical practice, the Sponsor will generally support publication of multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data. In this case, a 
coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement. 
Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with International Committee of 
Medi cal Journal Editors authorship requirements.

TNX-601 ER (t ianeptine hemioxalate  extended -release tablets) 
Name of Active Ingredient:  
Tianeptine h emioxalate  
Title of Study:  
A Phase 2, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group Study to Evaluate the 
Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of TNX-601 ER Monotherapy versus Placebo in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)  
Study center(s):  Approximately 30 sites in the United States  
Study Population:  Male and female patients  aged 18 to 65 years (inclusive) with a diagnosis of 
MDD as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria, currently suffering from a major depressive episode (MDE).  
Objectives:  
Primary:  
To evaluate the efficacy  of TNX -601 ER  (tianeptine hemioxalate  extended -release tablets) 
monotherapy in the treatment of major depressive disorder ( MDD)  
Secondary:  
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of TNX-601 E R (tianeptine hemioxalate  extended- release 
tablets) monotherapy in the treatment of MDD  
Methodology:  
This is a 6 -week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel- group, multicenter study to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of TNX-601 ER , 39.4 mg monotherapy, on symptoms of 
depression in adult patients with MDD. 
 
There will be a screening and washout period of up to 35 days, a double- blind treatment period 
(during which patients will receive either TNX -601 ER or placebo in a 1:1 randomization ratio) of 
about 42 days , and a posttreatment safety follow -up period of  approximately 14 days after 
discontinuation of study drug.  
 
Patients will be consented and screened at Screening  (Visit 1) for the study until approximately 300 
patients are randomized . Randomization will be performed in a 1:1 ratio to one of 2 treatment arms 
(daily TNX-601 ER or placebo) after meeting DSM- 5 diagnostic criteria for MDD in a current MDE 
as assessed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, Version 7.0.2 (MINI 7.0.2) at Screening ( Visit 1 ). The TNX-601 ER dose for all eligible patients will be 1 tablet once daily in the 
morning, initiated at Baseline  (Visit 2 ). All patients will return to the ir respective study site for an off -
drug, Post Study Follow-up (Visit 6)  approximately 2 weeks after discontinuation of study drug. 
Overall duration in the study for each patient is expected to be up to 13 weeks.  
Number of patients (planned):  
Approximately 300 patients with MDD will be enrolled . Randomized patients who withdr aw will not 
be replaced.

Analysis Populations  
• Safety Population (SAFETY): All patients who receive at least 1 dose of investigational 
product, analyzed as treated.  
• Intention- to-Treat Population (ITT): All randomized patients who receive at least 1 dose of 
study drug, analyzed as  randomized.  
Efficacy Analyses  
The primary efficacy analysis will use a Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM)  approach to 
estimate mean change from  (Visit 2)  in the Total MADRS  score evaluated at the Week 6 visit in the 
TNX-601 ER and placebo arms. The model will include all participants in the ITT population, and the 
dependent variable will be the observed change from B aseline  (Visit 2)  in total MADRS  score at each 
postdose visit.  Covariates in the model will include the fixed cat egorical effects of treatment, site, 
visit, and treatment by visit interaction, as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline score 
and baseline score by visit interaction. Missing data will be imputed via multiple imputation  (MI), 
and details regarding the MI approach will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
The primary analysis will be followed by several sensitivity analyses. The key  secondary efficacy 
outcomes will be measured and compared between treatment groups and will be adjusted for 
multiplicity using a fixed sequence procedure. Further details on sensitivity and secondary analyses 
can be found in the SAP , as well as the order of the key secondary endpoints.

 6. TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE  
6.1. Primary Objective  
To evaluate the efficacy of TNX -601 ER ( tianeptine hemioxalate  extended -release tablets ) 
monotherapy in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD)  
6.2. Secondary Objective 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of TNX -601 ER (tianeptine hemioxalate  extended -release 
tablets)  monotherapy in the treatment of MDD. 
7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall S tudy Design  
This is a 6 -week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel -group, multicenter  
study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of TNX-601 ER, 39.4 mg monotherapy, on 
symptoms of depression in adult patients with MDD in app roximately 30 sites in the United 
States . This study plans to randomize approximately 300 male and female patients aged 18 to 65 
years old (inclusive), with current MDD as defined by DSM-5 criteria. During the 6- week 
double- blind treatment period, patients  will receive either TNX -601 ER or placebo in a 1:1 
randomization ratio . After the End of T reatment  (Visit 5 /ET), there will be a 2 -week 
posttreatment safety  follow -up period.  
The study will be conducted in 4 periods: Screening (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 2), Treatment 
(Visits 3 -5), and Post Study Follow-up (Visit 6).  
Screening (Visit 1) 
Patients will be consented and assessed for current MDD as defined by DSM-5 diagnostic 
criteria, using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, Version 7.0.2 (MINI 7.0.2). 
Depression severity will be assessed by MADRS. Eligibility will also depend on medical history, physical and neurological exam ination, use of concomitant medications, and the results of 
laboratory tests (eg, pregnancy and drug screen, liver, kidney, and thyroid function, electrocardiogram).  
If a patient meets all eligibility requirements but is currently taking a prohibited medication, 
there will be a Screening Period of up to 35 days for drug tapering and washout. For extenuating 
circumsta nces and in cases in which a prospective participant is on fluoxetine, the duration of the 
Screening Period may be increased to up to 49 days with Medical Monitor approval. Medication-
free washout time for prohibited medications will be 4 weeks for antidepressants  (except for 
fluoxetine, which will be 6 weeks) and atypical antipsychotics. 
Baseline, Randomization, Start of Treatment (Visit 2) 
To ensure continued eligibility prior to randomization, patients will be assessed for all inclusion/exclusion criteri a, including a MADRS total score of ≥  25. Patient  must also have a 
≤25% decrease or increase in MADRS score from Screening (Visit 1)  to Baseline  (Visit 2) . Any

Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 7.2. Number of Patients and Treatment Assignment  
A total of approximately 300 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with 
once-daily oral TNX-601 ER (tianeptine hemioxalate extended -release tablets ) or identical 
placebo tablets , which are devoid of the tianeptine hemioxalate  but contain the same inactive 
ingredients present in the active tablets . Randomization will be stratified by study site.  
7.3. Study Endpoints  
7.3.1. Primary E fficacy E ndpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the change from B aseline (Visit 2) in the MADRS total 
score at Week  6.  
7.3.2. Secondary E fficacy E ndpoints  
7.3.2.1. Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The efficacy endpoints listed below are considered key secondary endpoints. 
• Change from B aseline (Visit 2)  in the C linician Global Impression – Severity Scale (CGI-S) 
score at Week  6 
• Change from B aseline (Visit 2)  in the Sheehan Disability Scale ( SDS) total score at Week 6  
A fixed sequence procedure will be applied to the key secondary efficacy endpoints to adjust for 
multiplicity and to control for overall type I erro r. 
7.3.3. Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  
• Proportion of patients achieving response, defined as a ≥50% decrease from Baseline (Visit 
2) in MADRS total score, assessed at  Weeks 2, 4, and 6 
• Proportion of patients  in remission, defined as a MADRS total score ≤ 10 at Weeks 2, 4, and 
6 
• Proportion of patients achieving sustained response, defined as a ≥ 50% decrease from 
Baseline (Visit 2)  in MADRS total score at both Weeks 4 and 6   
• Proportion of patients with a C linician  Global Impression – Improvement Scale (CGI-I) 
rating of “very much improved” or “much improved” at Weeks 2, 4, and 6 
• Mean CGI -I score at Weeks 2, 4, and 6 
• Change from B aseline ( Visit 2)  in Patient Global Impression of Severity Scale ( PGIS ) score 
at Weeks 2, 4, and 6 
• Proportion of patients with a Patient Global Impression of Change ( PGIC ) rating of “very 
much improved” or “much improved” at Weeks 2, 4, and 6  
• Mean PGIC score at Weeks 2, 4, and 6 
• Change from B aseline (Visit 2)  to Week 6 in the CSFQ -14 total score in females and in males 
(analyzed separately)

• Change from B aseline (Visit 2)  in each of the 3 domain s (work/school; social life; home life 
or family responsibilities) using the SDS at Weeks 2, 4, and 6 
• Proportion of patients with a CGI -S rating of “normal, not at all  ill” or “borderline mentally 
ill” at Weeks 2, 4, and 6 
• Proportion of patients with a PGIS rating of “not  present”, “very mild”, or “mild” at Weeks 
2, 4, and 6 
7.3.4. Safety  and Tolerability  
Safety and t olerability will be assessed by:  
• Inciden ce of AEs and SAEs throughout the entire duration of the study 
• Incidence of A Es associated with abuse liability using MADDERS® 
• Assessment of physical and neurological examination findings 
• Changes from B aseline (Visit 2)  in ECG results  
• Changes from B aseline (Visit 2)  in clinical laboratory test results  
• Changes from B aseline (Visit 2) in vital signs and weight 
• Indications of increased suicidal ideation or behavior as assessed by the C- SSRS  
• Changes from B aseline in  patien t-rated CSFQ -14 in males and in females, assessed  
separately  
• Change from B aseline ( Visit 5 or End of T reatment ) in the SOWS at the Post Study 
Follow-up (V isit 6). 
7.4. Efforts to Minimize Missing Data  
It is important to avoid missing data from clinical trials . The following strategies are designed to 
minimize dropouts and missing data in this study: 
1) Providing patients with greater background on the nature of placebo-controlled 
clinical trials and explaining that completing this study, regardless of the patient’s 
level of treatment response, is essentia l to understanding whether TNX-601 ER may 
be helpful to others in the treatment of MDD . Sites will explain that the study is not 
designed to benefit the individual patient but, rather, can only provide useful 
information for future therapeutics. 
2) Minimizing  the burden on patients, with visits scheduled generally every 2 weeks 
(with reasonable visit window flexibility) .  
3) Training of site personnel on the importance of minimizing missing data 
26 of 90
TNX- 601 ER  Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol TNX -TI-M201   Page 27 
 
Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 4) Providing payment for patients’  time and effort at clinic visits, based on the duration 
of assessments and as approved by the Institutional Review Board. R eimbursement 
for travel expenses to and from the clinic sites  may also be provided to further 
minimize the financial burden of participating in the study. 
5) Utilizing repe ated assessments of outcome measures and analytical approaches that 
most appropriately compensate for missing data. 
8. SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF PATIENTS

A potential patient may be screened for eligibility only after the nature of the study , its purpose, 
and any other information relevant to the patient’s decision to participate have been explained to 
him or her, and the patient has voluntarily confirmed his or her willingness to participate. If 
medications are to be withdrawn for the explicit purpose of participation in this study, the patient 
must first sign an informed consent form (ICF) before the withdrawal or down titration of any medication is initiated.  
Informed consent is documented by means of a written, signed, and dated ICF. Separate written, signed informed consent must be obtained if the patient is to participate in the optional pharmacogenomic assessment.  Additional information is provided in Section  15.3. 
8.2. Inclusion Criteria  
Patients enrolled in this study will be volunteer patients . Eligible patients must meet all  the 
following inclusion criteria during the screening period:

Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 8.4. Randomization Criteria  
The following randomization criteria must be satisfied at Baseline ( Visit 2 ) in order for the 
patient to be eligible to continue in the study. Only those patients meeting the following 
randomization criteria are eligible for randomization: 
1. Continue to meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria  
2. MADRS total score ≥25 at Baseline  (Visit 2) , and 
3. ≤25% decrease or increase in MADRS score from Screening (Visit 1)  to Baseline  (Visit 2) .  
8.5. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Many concomitant psychiatric  medications are proh ibited during this study because this study 
has been designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of monotherapy with TNX-601 ER tablets 
for the treatment of MDD . The goal of the study is to recruit patients who are not currently using 
other medications to  treat their MDD, or who are not clearly benefitting from any of the 
medications that would need to be discontinued in order to enter this study. Since many patients with MDD may already be taking one or more excluded medications when screened, Principal 
Investigators should use caution when determining whether a patient, in their clinical judgment, can be safely withdrawn from current medications that are being used to treat MDD or are otherwise excluded from the protocol. 
Eligible patients will not be receiving treatment with antidepressants  (including St. John’s Wort, 
S-adenosyl methionine, and/or trazodone used as an antidepressant), mood stabilizers or 
anticonvulsants (other than used for migraine prophylaxis) within 4 weeks  of Baseline (Visit 2) , 
except for fluoxetine, which must not be within 6 weeks of B aseline  (Visit 2) . If a patient  is receiving  
oral atypical antipsychotics used for antidepressant augmentation, it must not be  within 4 weeks 
of the Baseline (Visit 2) . Eligible patients will not be  receiving antipsychotics for other reasons. 
Eligible patients will also not be receiving stimulants , benzodiazepines, buspirone, or trazodone 
as a hypnotic within 1 week of the Baseline (Visit 2) . In cases in which a stimulant is 
discontinued for participation  and was positive on Screening (Visit 1)  urine toxicology, an 
in-clinic dipstick urine toxicology should be performed prior to randomizing the patient which 
shows the stimulant was successfully washed out. For benzodiazepine washouts with posi tive 
Screening (Visit 1)  urine toxicology, a repeat urine toxicology that is sent to the C entral L ab 
must be obtained at least 7 days prior to randomization in an Unscheduled visit showing 
successful washout of the benzodiazepine. Th e Central Lab is used rather than urine toxicology 
dipsticks because the Central Lab can test a greater number of commonly used benzodiazepines. 
Similarly, all opioid medications, including tramadol and tapentadol, are excluded medications. 
Patients on chronic opioids are not appropriate candidates for participation, but there may be 
patients with occasional as needed (PRN) opioid usage or who were recently on a short course 
for acute pain who may be appropriate if, in the clinical judgement of the Investigator, they could be saf ely tapered and remain opioid free for the week before B aseline ( Visit 2)  and throughout 
the 6 weeks of  treatment and follow up period in  the study. In cases in which opioids are tapered 
and discontinued for the study, an additional urine toxicology by in- clinic dipstick must be 
obtained prior to randomization showing the opioid was successfully washed out.

Clinical Trial Protocol TNX -TI-M201   Page 32 
 
Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 The screening period of up to 35 days is provided to ensure a safe tapering rate and 
discontinuation of excluded medications, per Investigator’s discretion, leading up to the 4- week 
medication -free period (or 1 -week medication -free period, depending on the medication) 
required before Baseline (V isit 2). 
8.5.1. Allowed Concomitant Medications 
It is ideal to have all patients participating in the study go without any hypnotic agents for the 
entire double-blind period of the study. Yet there may be instances in which patients’ insomnia symptoms need to be addressed with a concomitant treatment. In these instances, 
non-benzodiazepine sleep aids (eg, zolpidem, zaleplon and eszopiclone) and sedating 
antihistamines are allowed on a  PRN basis during the study but are to be avoided  within 24 hours 
of a clinical visit and generally should not be used more than two to three nights in a row. The 
Investi gator should manage the use of these two classes of permissible hypnotics during the 
study, encourag ing limited use . The dates on which these are used  should be captured in 
concomitant medications at the clinic visits . Chronic nightly use should be avoided whenever 
possible.  
Other prescription or over-the-counter medications not specifically excluded by entry criteria 
typically may be continued during the study, with the expectation that chronic medications 
should have been used in a stable fashion for at least 30 days prior to randomization . Sites should 
contact the M edical Monitor for any questions about whether a concomitant medication may be 
continued during the study or if it would be acceptable to taper an excluded medication. 
Sites will collect data on all concomitant medications (other than antidepressants) taken within 
30 days of screening. 
8.6. Withdrawal Criteria  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, human patients have the right to withdraw from 
the study at any time for any reason. The Investigator and Tonix also have the right to remove 
patients from the study. Additional information regarding withdrawal or discontinuation of 
patients is described in detail in Section  10.4.1. 
9. STUDY DRUG MATERIALS AND MANAGEMENT  
9.1. Study Drug Packaging, and Labeling and Storage  
Study drug supplies will be packaged identically so as to maintain the integrity of the study 
blind. The study drug bottles will be labeled minimally with the following information:  study 
number TNX- TI-M201, sponsor name and address, bottle number, quantity, storage conditions, 
usage instructions, and caution statements for investigational new drug, eg, Caution:  New Drug 
– Limited by United States Law to Investigational Use and K eep Out of R each of Children and 
Pets. 
Each study drug bottle will contain 20 tablets . One  bottle will be dispensed to each patient at 
Visit 2 ( Baseline), Visit 3 (Week 2), and Visit 4 (Week 4); this will provide the patient with 
20 tablets to cover the 2 weeks of dosing between visits, plus additional tablets to cover loss 
32 of 90
TNX- 601 ER  Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol TNX -TI-M201   Page 33 
 
Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 and/or visit window variability . The patient should be instructed to keep this study drug in a safe 
location out of extreme environmental conditions and out of the reach of children and pets, and 
that this drug is not to be taken by any individual other than the study patient. Each patient will also be instructed that they will be expected to return the bottle and all unused study drug at each clinic visit; unused drug will be counted to assess compliance with study drug treatment. 
Storage of the study drug at the investigational site s should be under locked and secure 
conditions with limited staff access . Study drug should be stored at 15-25°C/59-77°F in a 
temperature/humidity -monitored room. 
9.2. Dosing Instructions  
Patients will be instructed to take one  table t of their assigned study drug (TNX-601 ER  or 
placebo) orally , each morning and continuing without interruption for 6 weeks.  Day 1 study drug 
will be taken in the clinic.  They should swallow  the tablets whole , and not crush or chew the 
tablets . The tablet should be taken  in the morning with breakfast . Patients will be reminded that 
only 1 tablet is  allowed per day. Note:  In the event that the patient misses a dose, instruct the 
patient to continue dosing with one (1) table t the next morning; e g, they should not take more to 
make up for the missed dose. 
9.3. Dispensing Instructions  
Each patient who has met the randomization criteria ( Section  8.4 ) will be assigned 1 
double- blind treatment bottle at Visit 2 via the  Interactive Web Response System (IWRS ), with a 
unique, but otherwise random bottle number that is generated when an authorized staff member  
successfully completes randomization procedures. Patients will also be assigned a new treatment 
bottle  at Visits 3 and 4 via the IWRS . The bottle numbers provided by the IWRS at these visits 
will tell the site which treatment bottle s have been assigned to the patient. 
In the event of loss of study drug, new drug will be provided by the IWR S, when appropriately 
requested by the site and/or the sponsor or designee. 
Study treatments for the double- blind treatment phase are either:  
 
Treatment A: 1 x TNX -601 ER tablet (“TNX -601 ER”) 39.4 mg to be taken orally in the 
morning. 
Or Treatment B: 1 x placebo tablet (“placebo”) to be taken orally in the morning 
9.4. Release of Clinical Study Supplies to the Investigator  
Tonix or Tonix’s designee’s standard operating procedures for releasing clinical trial supplies to 
the site will be followed.  
9.5. Study Drug Accountability and Reconciliation  
All patients will be expected to bring their bottle of study drug with them to all study visits . At 
each study visit, the site staff will inspect the drug bottle, and perform a count of the tablets 
33 of 90
TNX- 601 ER  Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol TNX -TI-M201   Page 34 
 
Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 remaining in the bottle s and document this in the patient’s record. An assessment of drug 
adherence should be done by the study staff to ensure that the patient understands all dosing 
instructions and is taking the drug as prescribed . Patients will be asked for an explanation if the 
count of returned study drug tablets indicates a discrepancy between the expected number of 
tablets dosed and the number returned in the bottle. If it is found that the patient is not taking the 
study drug as expected, the patient will be re -counselled  with instructions, and this should be 
noted in the patients’ records. A deviation should be recorded on any patient who is less than 
70% complian t with dosing between visits. 
If the patient fails to return any of the unused study drug as expected, the I nvestigator will 
identify if it matches a MADDERS® triggering event and complete the MADDERS® 
Supplemental Drug Accountability Form. Patient should be evaluated by the Investigator for the 
reason for the lower -than-expected  tablet number and about potential misuse, abuse, or 
diversion, and the Investigator will address this accordingly. If more than 1 tablet cannot be 
accounted for at an y of the visits where drug is returned (W eek 2, 4, or 6 ), the Investigator will 
be asked to evaluate the situation, and a written summary of this evaluation should be added to the source and entered onto the case report form (CRF). Situations where replacement drug is requested, or when more than 1 tablet cannot be accounted for, should be recorded as deviations.  
All study  drug, including partial and empty bottles, must be maintained at the study site until 
Tonix or its designee verifies drug accountability and provides instruction for destruction or the 
return of the investigational product to the Sponsor’s drug distribution depot. 
Tonix or their designee will perform drug accountability which entails reconciliation between the 
amount of drug shipped to the study site, study drug assigned and dispensed to the patient 
(including returned unused assigned study drug), and study supplies that were never dispensed 
and/or assigned to patients. 
10. STUDY VISITS AND PROCEDURES  
The overall and detailed schedule for study procedures and visits is provided in Table 1. 
10.1. Visit 1 (Screening: Day - 35 to -7) 
10.1.1. Informed Consent  
Before the potential patient has undergone any study-related screening procedures, including any 
downward titration or withdrawal of medications, the nature of the study and the potential risks 
associated with it will be explained to the patient, and the p atient will be given an opportunity to 
ask questions to his or her satisfaction. After all questions are answered, but before proceeding 
further, the patient must read and sign a written ICF. This signed ICF will be retained in the 
Investigator’s study file, and the date the patient signed the form will be entered into the CRF. 
The patient will be provided with a copy of his or her signed and dated ICF and will also be 
required to sign all updated informed consents. 
The patient will also be pr esented  with a consent to Clinical Trial Subject Registry (CTSR) 
screening,  which is a mandatory part of the consent process.

TNX- 601 ER  Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol TNX -TI-M201   Page 35 
 
Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
  A site can elect not to participate in the CTSR, with approval from the sponsor, and there will be 
no protocol deviations recorded for leaving it out of the procedures.   
The patient will also be presented with the opportunity to participate in the optional 
pharmacogenomic assessment. I f the patient agrees to participate in the optional 
pharmacogenomic assessment, a separate signed written ICF must be obtained.  
10.1.2. Screening Overview  
Screening ( Visit 1 ) will start a variable length screening period. The  length of the screening 
period is to be no shorter than 7 days but may be as long as 35 days in order to accommodate 
medication taper and discontinuation or other study requirements. 
If the patient  is eligible to continue in the study, and does not need to discontinue any excluded 
medication, the patient  may be scheduled to return for Baseline ( Visit 2 ) in 7 (or more) days, 
assuming all screening evaluations have been completed, including confirmation of acceptable 
laboratory and ECG results . If the patien t needs to undergo taper and discontinuation of excluded 
medication, the Investigator will generate a written down -titration schedule for the patient  and 
will schedule Baseline ( Visit 2 ) such that the date of Baseline ( Visit 2 ) is 1 to 5 week s after the 
date of the final dose of any excluded medication. If additional clinic visits are deemed necessary 
by the Investigator for clinical monitoring of the patient  before scheduling Baseline ( Visit 2 ), 
such visits will be recorded as unscheduled visits. 
10.1.3. Patient  Numbering  
All screened patients will be assigned a unique concatenated 6-digit site -patient number  
(eg, 202-012) by the IWRS. A screening log or system documenting the following information 
will be recorded and maintained, and will include the patient ’s year of birth , screening number, 
whether the patient  was ultimately randomized or not, and if not randomized, the reason the 
patient  was excluded/screen  failed.  
10.1.4. Screening and Assessments/Procedures  
The following screening assessments/procedures will be completed in the following general order:  
• Obtain written informed consent to participate  
• Review placebo response training  with patient 
• Obtain demographics, including alcohol, nicotine/tobacco (smoking, vaping and/or 
chewing), and marijuana use 
• Obtain medical history  
• Obtain prior and current medication history, including all prior MD D therapies and other 
treatments for psychiatric indications  
• Obtain psychiatric history

o Blood for serum pregnancy test (for women of child-bearing potential) 
o Urine for Drug Screen (central laboratory) 
• Conduct 12- lead ECG  
• Administer C- SSRS, Baseline/Screening Version  
• Review inclusion/exclusion criteria  
Only those patient s meeting all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible 
to continue. NOTE:  Final determination of eligibility based on clinical laboratory  tests will be 
made when results have been returned.  
Sites will be asked to complete and submit to the Tonix medical monitoring team key screening 
information . This information will be reviewed by the Tonix medical monitoring team to help 
ensure the select ion of well-qualified patient s. The specific requirements and timelines 
associated with this pre -randomization review process will be outlined in a separate document.  
Once eligibility has been confirmed and authorization for randomization granted by the M edical 
Monitor or delegate, eligible patient s will return to the clinic for Baseline ( Visit 2 ). 
There is no requirement for Follow-Up visits for patients who are SFs . Patient s who fail to 
qualify should have their medication adjusted, as appropriate, per the judgment of the 
Investigator and be released from the clinic.  
Patients that are determined to be a screen fail may be re-screened based on Medical Monitor 
approval.  
10.2. Visit 2 (Baseline: Day 1) 
Baseline ( Visit 2 ) should be scheduled 7 to 35 days after Screening ( Visit 1 ). If the patient meets 
all randomization criteria, the patient will be randomized via the IWR S system to receive double-
blind study drug. 
10.2.1. Pre-Randomization Assessments 
The following assessments must be completed at Baseline ( Visit 2 ) to confirm that the patient  is 
eligible for randomization . Upon arrival at the clinic, the following assessments should be done, 
in the following general order: 
• Assess occurrence of AEs  
• Update medical history (with changes since screening noted)

≤25% decrease or increase in MADRS score from Screening (Visit 1)  to Baseline  
(Visit 2). 
• Conduct urine drug screen (urine dipstick, only as necessary, if select Screening ( Visit 1 ) 
tests were positive for excluded medi cations that required discontinuation prior to 
randomization, or if Investigator suspects drug use) 
• Conduct in -clinic urine pregnancy test (for women of child-bearing potential) 
• Collect blood sample for those who consent to participate in the optional 
pharmacogenomics  assessment . (The blood draw for this pharmacogenomics assessment 
can be done at any in -clinic visit post- Screening ; however, it is preferred that the sample  
is collected at Baseline ( Visit 2 ) whenever possible.)

available for Investigator to review) 
10.2.2. Randomization Criteria  
Once all pre-randomization assessments have been completed, only those patients who meet all of the following randomization criteria will be eligible to continue: 
1) Continue to meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria ,  
2) MADRS  total score  ≥ 25 at Baseline  (Visit 2 ), 
3) ≤25% decrease or increase in MADRS score from Screening (Visit 1)  to Baseline  
(Visit 2)  
If the patient  does not satisfy these randomization criteria, the patient  has failed to qualify for 
this study and should be considered a SF , with the reason documented. With Medical Monitor 
approval, if the patient  is otherwise considered a qualified and compliant pati ent, Baseline ( Visit 
2) may be delayed to accommodate situations in which extenuating or short -term circumstances  
do not warrant SF .

 • Physician to assess CGI -S and  CGI -I (needs to be completed once all o ther assessments 
are available for Investigator to review) 
• Schedule the Post Study Follow-up (V isit 6) 
10.4.1. Early Termination (ET) 
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, patients have the right to withdraw from the 
study at any time for any reason, and they will be advised of this right. The Investigator and 
Tonix also have the right to remove patients from the study. Specific reasons for removal of a 
patient from the study could include, but are not limited to: 
• An AE  
• An illness that, in the judgment of the Investigator or Tonix, might invalidate the study results or place the patient at risk  
• The request of the patient, Investigator, or Tonix, whether for administrative or other reasons  
• Pregnancy  
This study will attempt to obtain as complete information as possible on all participating patients . An effort must be made to contact the M edical Monitor prior to any patient’s early 
termination . Each reason for early termination will be reviewed . Patients who wish to terminate 
their participation in the study early  should be strongly encouraged to come to the clinic for an 
ET Visit, and a Follow-up visit. The purpose of the ET visit is to obtain critical information about the patient’s participation and should be scheduled preferably before there has been a 
substantial lapse in study drug usage. However, even if there has been a drug lapse, the patient should be encouraged to return to the clinic for this visit and should be instructed to return all study drug. NOTE:  These visit procedures are not intended for patients who fail to qualify for 
randomization or for any other reason withdraw from the study prior to receipt of a dose of 
double-blind study drug. 
If the patient withdraws from the study, the following assessments and procedures are to be 
completed at this visit in the following general order: 
• Document reason for ET. The Investigator should carefully assess the role of AEs  and/or 
lack of efficacy when determining the most accurate reason for the patient’s early termination.

next two weeks and return for the Week 8 Post-Study Follow-up visit.  
10.4.2. Unscheduled Visits  
Patients may need to be seen at other times than the scheduled study visits for additional safety 
assessments or to follow-up, as medically necessary, on clinical laboratory results , physic al 
examination, or other findings. If an additional study visit is warranted, or occurs, the date and nature of the visit will be documented in the CRF and in the source documents. 
10.5. Visit 6 (Week 8)  
Post Study Follow-up ( Visit 6) should occur after 2 weeks from the end of double-blind study 
drug treatment, scheduled at Day 57 + 7 days . The following assessments and procedures are to 
be completed in the following general order:

who are early terminated.  
11. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
11.1. Screening Assess ments  
11.1.1. Psychiatric and Medical History  
A psychiatric interview using the MINI 7.0.2 ( Sheehan et al, 1998), a self -assessed MSI -BPD  
and a comprehensive medical history will be obtained at screening in order to determine whether 
the patient is eligible for enrollment.  The MINI 7.0.2 will assess for a lifetime look -back for 
opioid and sedative-hypnotic use disorder rather than the standard 12 months look- back.  
While patients with mild TBI are eligible to participate in the study, moderate and severe TBI are excluded. Common traumatic brain injuries result from falls, motor vehicle accidents, assaults, 
and sports injuries. A history of TBI  is defined as any traumatically induced structural injury 
and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated 
by new onset or worsening of at le ast one of the following clinical signs, immediately following 
the event:
 
1. Any period of loss of or a decreased level of consciousness; 
2. Any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury; 
3. Any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (eg, confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking); 
4. Neurological deficits (eg, weakness, balance disturbance, praxis, paresis/plegia, change in vision, other sensory alterations, aphasia) that may or may not be transient;  
5. Intracranial lesion.  
Although severity of TBI  depends in part on patient assessment in the days after a traumatic head 
injury, for the purposes of this protocol, mild TBI is defined as: 
6. Normal structural brain imaging findings 
42 of 90
TNX- 601 ER  Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol TNX -TI-M201   Page 43 
 
Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 7. Loss of consciousness not greater than 30 minutes after injury  
8. Alteration of consciousness not greater than 24 hours after injury 
9. Posttraumatic amnesia not more than 24 hours after injury 
10. No ongoing neurological deficits (Note: tinnitus, headaches, or sleep disturbances that 
appeared to result from the head trauma would not be considered as ongoing neurological 
deficits and therefore should not  be interpreted as meaning the person has a greater 
severity than mild TBI.)  
Each incidence of traumatic brain injury in a patient’s lifetime history should be assessed using 
these five rule outs for greater than mild TBI , which is exclusionary for the protocol. 
In addition, the past medication history will be reviewed. Any psychiatric medication or MD D 
therapies utilized during the patient’s lifetime should be collected . Responses from the MINI and 
MSI-BPD  will serve to document the presence or suspicion of other psychiatric conditions. The 
diagnosis and severity of MDD will be based on the MINI 7.0.2 and MADRS, respectively 
(Section  11.2.1).  
11.2. Efficacy Assessments 
The primary efficacy endpoint and many of the secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints in this study are derived from clinician -administered assessments which must be administered by 
qualified and trained individuals at each clinical site . Study specific training will be required 
before staff is allowed to administer these scales . In an attempt to minimize variability in 
responses of a given patient over time, it is important that the same rater administer the scales to 
a given patient throughout the study unless absolutely unavoidable due to the rater’s absence 
from the clinic . It is also important that the assessments, including those that are 
patient -completed, be conducted in the specified order, according to specific instructions, and in 
a setting where the patient has minimal distractions, appropriate privacy, and sufficient time to complete them.  
11.2.1. MADRS  
The MADRS is a validated, 10- item, clinician -administered depression scale that has been used 
in clinical research since 1979 ( Montgomery & Åsberg, 1979). This study will use a structured 
interview version of the MADRS (Structured Interview Guide for the MADRS , SIGMA ), which 
was shown to have high interrater reliability ( Williams & Kobak, 2008).  
The MADRS will be completed at S creening (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 2) and after Weeks 2,4, 
and 6 of treatment (Visits 3, 4, and 5, respectively). The 10 items measure the core symptoms and cognitive features of clinical depression. This scale has historically been used in drug- treatment  trials due to its particular sensitivity to detect treatment effects .  
Patients with a Screening (Visit 1)  MADRS score of  ≥28, ≥25 at Baseline  (Visit 2) , and a ≤25% 
decrease or increase in MADRS score from Screening (Visit 1)  to Baseline  (Visit 2)  are eligible 
to be randomized .

Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 11.2.2. Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI -S) 
The CGI -S will be completed by an Investigator to assess overall patient severity at the time of 
the assessment . The CGI -S will be completed at Visits 2, 3, 4, and 5 (Baseline, Week 2, 4, and 6, 
respectively) . The CGI -S should be completed toward the end of each visit once all assessments 
are available for the Investigator’s review. The  Investigator will answer the following question: 
Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the 
patient at this time?  
1 = Normal, not at all ill  
2 = Borderline mentally ill 3 = Mildly ill  
4 = Moderatel y ill 
5 = Markedly ill 6 = Severely ill  
7 = Among the most extremely ill patients  
11.2.3. Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI -I) 
The CGI -I will be completed by an Investigator to assess the overall change in the patient’s 
status since Baseline (Visit 2) . The CGI -I will be completed  at Visits 3, 4, and 5 (Week 2, 4, and 
6, respectively). The CGI -I should be completed toward the end of each visit once all 
assessments are available for the Investigator’s review . The Investigator will answer the 
following question: 
Rate total improvement whether or not in your judgment it is due entirely to drug treatment. 
Compared to his/her condition at B aseline (Visit 2)  of TNX -TI-M201, how much has patient 
changed?  
1 = Very much improved 2 = Much improved 3 = Minimally improved  
4 = No change 5 = Minimally worse  
6 = Much worse 7 = Very much worse 
11.2.4. Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS)  
The PGIS assesses the patients’ overall perception of their condition. This form will be 
completed by the patient at Visits 2, 3, 4, and 5 (Baseline, Week 2, 4, and 6, respectively). The patient will answer a single question:  
Please rate the severity of your depression right now:

Clinical Trial Protocol TNX -TI-M201   Page 45 
 
Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 1 = Not present 
2 = Very mild  
3 = Mild  
4 = Moderate  
5 = Moderately severe  
6 = Severe  
7 = Extremely severe  
11.2.5. Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) 
The PGIC is a validated, self -report instrument to gauge the patient’s assessment of change in 
condition. This form will be completed by the patient after Week 2, 4 and 6 of treatment (Visits 
3, 4, and 5, respectively) . The patient will answer a single question: 
Since the initiation of study drug, overall, my  depression symptoms are: 
1 = Very much improved 2 = Much improved 3 = Minimally improved  
4 = No change 5 = Minimally worse  
6 = Much worse 7 = Very much worse 
11.2.6. Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)  
The SDS scale is a self -report questionnaire that was designed to assess the patient’s view of the 
degree to which symptoms have disrupted work, social life/ leisure activities, and family 
life/home responsibilities during the past 2 week s (Sheehan  & Sheehan, 2008). In addition, the 
SDS asks the patient to provide the number of days or work lost as well as unproductive days in the past 2 week s. The SDS scale will be completed by the patient at Baseline (Visit 2), and after 
2, 4, and 6 weeks of treatment (Visits 3, 4, and 5 respectively).  
11.2.7. Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) 
The HARS is a widely used and well- validated 14- item clinician -administered scale for assessing 
the severity of symptoms of anxiety ( Hamilton, 1959) . The scale measures both psychic anxiety 
(mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to 
anxiety). The HARS will be completed at Baseline (Visit 2) and after 2, 4, and 6 weeks of 
treatment (Visits 3, 4, and 5, respectively) .

Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 11.3. Safety Parameters  
Safety will be assessed by evaluation of AEs ; responses on the C- SSRS, and CSFQ -14; clinical 
laboratory test results, physical examination findings, ECG parameters, vital signs,  and weight. 
AEs associated with abuse liability of th e study drug will be evaluated using the MADDERS®. 
Withdrawal symptoms associated with the study drug after the End of Treatment (Visit 5 /ET) 
will be evaluated using the SOWS. 
11.3.1. Adverse Events (AEs)  
Patients will be monitored for the occurrence of AEs throughout the study from the time that the 
patient signs an informed consent to their last study visit. AEs that are spontaneously reported, 
elicited , or observed are to be recorded on the CRF with the date, time of onset, date and time of 
resolution, severity, seriousness, causality (relationship to study drug), actions required, and 
outcome. 
To elicit AEs, non-leading, simple questions with minimal connotations should be used as the 
initial q uestions at all evaluation points during the study. Examples of these questions can be: 
• How have you felt since your last visit? 
• Have you had any health problems since your last visit? 
If an AE occurs, the Investigator will institute support and/or tre atment as deemed appropriate. 
During the study, all AEs should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until the subject is 
lost to follow -up. AEs (serious and non-serious) that are ongoing at the last study visit should be 
followed for up to 28 days following the last dose or until one of the above conditions 
(resolution, etc.) is (are) met.  
There are many symptoms associated with MDD  that can vary in intensity and frequency over 
time. Only symptoms that significantly worsen or become more frequent, in the opinion of the 
patient and outside of their normal experience, should be reported as an adverse event. Additional information regarding definition and reporting requirements for AE s, SAEs , and 
pregnancies is provided in Section  12.2 , Section  12.3, and Section  12.4 respectively   
11.3.2. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The C -SSRS is a questionnaire developed by researchers at Columbia University to assess 
suicide risk and to track suicidal ideation and behavior during clinical trials . This scale is 
intended to be used by individuals who have received training in its administration. The 
questions contained in the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale are suggested probes . 
Ultimately, the determination of the presence of suicidal ideation or behavior depends on the judgment of the individual administering the scale. 
There are multiple versions of this questionnaire. At Visit 1, the “ Baseline/ Screening” version 
will be administered , and the recall periods wi ll be “lifetime” and “within the past 6 months” for 
suicidal ideation, and “within the past year” for suicidal behaviors. Patients whose responses are 
indicative of suicidal ideation with intent and/or plan (eg, Type 4- 5 ideation) within the past 
6 months or a history of prior suicidal behavior within the past year will be excluded from participation, with recommended referral for appropriate intervention.

Clinical Trial Protocol TNX -TI-M201   Page 47 
 
Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 At all subsequent visits (Visit 2 through 6), the “s ince l ast visit”  version will be administered, 
and the recall period will be “since the last visit” . Note that if there has been a significant change 
in responses indicative of increased suicide risk, appropriate intervention should be initiated . 
11.3.3. Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination , including a brief neurological examination, will be performed 
at Visit 1  (Screening) and End of Treatment (Visit 5 /ET). At a minimum, the physical 
examination will include the following components: HEENT (head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat), 
neck, chest, and lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen, skin, and musculoskeletal in addition to the 
brief neurological examination. The physical examination may exclude rectal, genitourinary, and 
breast examinations.  
11.3.4. Vital Signs, Height , and Wei ght 
Vital signs  including sitting or supine blood pressure,  heart rate, temperature, and weight will be 
assessed at  Visit 1  (Screening ), Visit 2  (Baseline), and Visits 3, 4 and 5/ET ( after 2, 4, and 6 
weeks of treatment, respectively ), as well as at Visit 6 .  Height will be measured without shoes at 
Screening ( Visit 1 ) only. The BMI will be a derived variable, based on height and weight entries. 
A BMI of <18.0 or >40.0 kg/m2 is an exclusion criterion. Blood pressure and heart rate should be 
measured  after sitting  or supine for five minutes at rest . Height will be measured without shoes at 
Screening ( Visit 1 ) only. The BMI will be a derived variable, based on height and weight entries. 
A BMI of <18.0 or >40.0 kg/m2 is an exclusion criterion. 
11.3.5. Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
A 12 -lead ECG (supine after  five minutes  rest) will be performed at Screening (Visit 1), Baseline 
(Visit 2) and End  of Treatment (Visit 5/ET ). The purpose is to 1) exclude patients who have 
either a hist ory of or current evidence of clinically significant and currently relevant cardiac 
disease (eg, significant arrhythmias or heart block, heart failure, or myocardial infarction within the past 2 years) , a QTcF  at Screening >450m/sec (males) or QTcF  >470m/sec (females) , and 2) 
to determine the effects of the study drug on cardiac intervals. 
The ECG interpretation will be performed by the central reader and confirmed by the 
Investigator, record ed in the CRF as normal, abnormal but not clinically significant, or abnormal 
and clinically significant. In addition, the standard ECG parameters including rhythm, heart rate, 
and intervals for PR (or PQ), QRS, and QTcF (Fridericia’s) corrections for heart rate will be collected . 
If the Investigator has any concerns about the eligibility of a patient or wishes to confirm his/her assessment, the Investigator should consult with the M edical Monitor for this study. 
11.3.6. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
The clinical laboratory evaluat ions to be performed in this trial are listed in Table 2. Those 
marked as screening tests will be performed at screening only. All other tests will be performed at  Week 4 (Visit 4)  and after 6 weeks of treatment (Visit 5), or ET. Clinical laboratory values 
may be repeated prior to randomization in order to confirm exclusionary levels for ALT and/or 
47 of 90
TNX- 601 ER  Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol TNX -TI-M201   Page 48 
 
Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 AST values . If these values remain persistently elevated upon repeat, the patient is not eligible 
for randomization. 
With the exception of the urine pregnancy tests or the ad hoc urine drug test required at Baseline 
(Visit 2)  for patients washing off excluded medications (eg, benzodiazepines, stimulants, 
opioids) , all clinical laboratory evaluations will be analyzed via a central clinical laboratory , and 
information regarding appropriate sample volume, collection tubes, sample labeling and 
handling, and shipment will be provided in a study m anual.  
A urine drug screen for drugs of abuse (including marijuana) will be collected at Screening (Visit 1) and sent to the central laboratory for analysis , as well as an on-site urine drug test. If the 
patient has a positive drug screen at Screening  (Vis it 1) and/or Baseline ( Visit 2 ) for anything 
other than marijuana, and the results cannot be explained by use of current allowable prescription 
medications, the patient should be excluded from the study. If the urine drug screen is positive at Screening  (Visit 1 ) and the results can  be explained by the use of current prescription 
medications (eg, benzodiazepines, stimulants, opioids) that will be discontinued during screening, the Investigator must repeat the drug screen and obtain a negative result using an in-clinic urine dipstick drug screen prior to randomization to confirm eligibility for the study. 
Patients with positive results for benzodiazepines at Screening (Visit 1)  will need to come back 
to the clinic for repeat centralized urine drug screen following a minimum of one week off all 
benzodiazepines. And since the results of the repeat urine drug screen must be confirmed 
negative prior to randomization, the Baseline visit (Visit 2)  should take place no sooner than 7 
days after the patient’s post -washout urine drug screen.  
Each clinically significant abnormal laboratory value or other clinically meaningful abnormality should be followed until the abnormality resolves or until a decision is made that it is not likely 
to resolve. If such abnormalities do not return to normal within a reasonable period, their etiology should be identified and Tonix or designee should be notified. Treatment -emergent 
clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory values will be recorded as AEs.

d Pregnancy testing for females of child -bearing potentia l, including women who have  had bilateral tubal ligation . A positive pregnancy test 
is exclusionary (Visit 1 or Visit 2) or mandates withdrawal from the study (all other visits).  
e Urine drug screening will be conducted on all patients at Screening  (Visit 1)  and, if necessary, at Baseline (Visit 2)  in patients with a 
positive result for excluded medications requiring washout (eg., benzodiazepines, stimulants,  opioids) and who otherwise qualify for the 
study . For patients testing positive at the Screening visi t (Visit 1)  for an excluded medication that will be discontinued during the screening 
interval, an in -clinic urine dipstick drug screen will be performed at  the Baseline (Visit 2)  visit and must be negative in order for the patient 
to be eligible for rando mization  (this will primarily apply to  opioids and amphetamines) . Patients with positive results for b enzodiazepines 
at Screening (Visit 1) will need to come into the clinic for a repeat centralized Urine drug screen following a one-week drug free interval, 
and t he Baseline v isit (Visit 2)  may need to be delayed in order to ensure that the results from the repeat centralized UDS can be confirmed 
negative prior to randomization .  
11.3.7. Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire Short -Form (CSFQ -14) 
The CS FQ-14 ( Keller  et al. 2006) is  a validated scale with internal reliability designed to allow a 
patient to self -evaluate his or her sexual behaviors or problems in a number of areas. The CSFQ -
14 will be administered at Baseline (Visit 2) and Week 6 or ET. ( Visit 5/ ET). It yields a total 
score, 3 subscales corresponding to phases of the sexual response cycle (ie, desire, arousal, 
orgasm), and 5 subscales corresponding to important dimensions of sexual functioning. It is considered a useful scale for assessing sexual side effects of medications . For all items, higher 
scores reflect higher sexual functioning. For 12 of the 14 items, higher sexual functioning 
49 of 90
TNX- 601 ER  Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol TNX -TI-M201   Page 50 
 
Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 corresponds to greater frequency or enjoyment/pleasure (eg, 1 = never to 5 = every day). For 2 
items (item 10, assessing loss of interest after arousal for women and priapism for men, and item 
14, assessing painful orgasm), higher sexual functioning corresponds to lower frequency (eg, 1 = every day to 5 = never). Items 10 and 14 are included in the total score but not in any 
scale score.  
Investigators will ensure that patient receives  applicable male or female versions of the 
CSFQ -14.  
11.3.8. Misuse, Abuse, Diversion Drug Event Reporting System (MADDERS
®) 
The MADDE RS® is a structured method to: 
• Identify potential abuse- related events associated with study drug  
• Classify the events according to standardized definitions 
• Identify potential abuse- related events not already classified as an adverse event of 
interest or drug accountability discrepancy. 
The Investigator at each site will be trained to identify related adverse events and drug 
accountability discrepancy. This information is collected throughout the study in real time. If any 
of these events are identified during the stud y, the Investigator will determine if it matches a 
MADDERS® triggering event. If so, the MADDERS® Supplemental Adverse Event Form or the 
MADDERS® Supplemental Drug Accountability Form will be completed.  These events are 
adjudicated by a MADDERS® Adju dication Committee after the patient exits the study.  
In addition to, all participants (regardless of the occurrence of a MADDERS® triggering events) 
will complete the MADDERS® Medication Use Survey on Visit 6. If the pa rticipant is lost to 
follow-up prior to Visit 6, the Me dication Use Survey should be completed based on the site’s 
knowledge of the participant.  
11.3.9. Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale  (SOWS) 
The SOWS is a  self-administered 16-item scale for evaluating opioid withdraw al symptoms 
(Handelsman et al., 1987 ). The SOWS will  be administered at End  of Treatment  (Visit 5/ET ) 
(after 6 weeks of treatment/ET),  then completed at  home at  +1 day, +2 days, +3 days, +6 days, 
+9 days, and +12 after Visit 5/ET, and lastly administered at the Post Study Follow-up (V isit 6).  
The purpose of t he first administration of the SOWS at End  of Treatment (after 6 weeks of 
treatment or ET)  is to  establis h a “baseline” for withdrawal symptoms. The SOWS is given over 
the next three days (+1, +2, and +3 days) because that is the estimated time for TNX -601 ER to 
be eliminated from the body (5 x 11-hour half -life of MC5, a major metabolite of TNX-601 E R). 
The additional days for the SOWS (+6, +9, +12 days) ensures that the SOWS is given at least 
twice a week between the End  of Treatment (Visit  5/ET) and the Post Study Follow-up (Visit 6).  
11.4. Optional Pharmacogenomic Assessment  
Patients who meet all criteria  for randomization will be eligible  to participate in the 
pharmacogenomic assessment . A single blood draw will be collected in one 6mL K2 EDTA tube 
for each participating patient after they have signed a separate ICF for pharmacogenomic 
50 of 90
TNX- 601 ER  Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol TNX -TI-M201   Page 51 
 
Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 assessment . The blood draw for this assessment can be done at any in- clinic visit post- Screening ; 
however, it is preferred that the sample is collected at Baseline ( Visit 2 ) whenever possible. The 
blood draw may only be performed after the patient has been confirmed to meet all criteria for 
randomization, and after the patient has reviewed and signed the separate pharmacogenomic 
testing ICF . 
The purpose of this testing is to allow genetic sequencing and analysis for genetic variants related to treatment response to TNX -601 ER. It is presumed that unused sample will be stored 
up to 15 years, and potentially utilized to develop a pharmacogenomic test for determining likelihood of treatment re sponse to TNX-601 ER. A decision not to participate in optional 
pharmacogenomic testing will not affect the patient’s eligibility for the main study. Patients have 
the right to stop participating at any time during the study or during the time of sample st orage, 
and, if a patient decides to withdraw from the pharmacogenomics portion of this study, any 
remaining sample will be destroyed and not used for further research. Data collected before a 
patient’s withdrawal from the pharmacogenomics portion of this s tudy will remain in the 
research database.  
12. DEFINITIONS, RECORDING, AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE 
EVENTS 
12.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
According to International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidance E2A, Clinical Safety 
Data Management: Definitions and Stan dards for Expedited Reporting, an adverse event (AE) is 
any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which is not necessarily required to have a causal relationship with this treatment . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. 
A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is an AE that either commenced following initiation of study 
drug or was present prior to study drug but increased in frequency or severity following initiation 
of study treatment. 
12.2. Adverse Event Recording  
12.2.1. Coding the Adverse Event  
Standard medical terminology should be used in describing AEs. MedDRA® will be used as the 
standard coding dictionary for AEs and in describing the patient’s medical history, and the 
World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary will be used to code concomitant 
medications . Informal descriptions should be avoided. 
12.2.2. Severity of Adverse Event  
AEs should be graded as mild, moderate, or severe using the following definitions. 
51 of 90
TNX- 601 ER  Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol TNX -TI-M201   Page 52 
 
Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 • Mild:  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and of minor irritant type 
causing no loss of time from normal activities . Symptoms do not require therapy or a 
medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient. 
• Moderate:  Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the patient and 
may interfere with daily activities but are usually improved by simple therapeutic 
measures; moderate experiences may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe: Events interrupt the patient ’s normal daily activities and generally require 
systemic drug therapy or other treat ment; they are usually incapacitating.  
To make sure there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms 
“serious” and “severe,” which are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is 
provided. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event 
(as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, maybe of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache) . This is not the same as 
“serio us,” which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a patient's life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
12.2.3. Relationship o f Adverse Events (AEs) to Study Drug  
The Investigator will assess the potential relationship of the AE to study drug using the following 
descriptions. 
• Not Related:  This category applies to an AE that is clearly not related to the 
investigational agent/procedure, beyond a reasonable doubt. That is, another cause of the 
event is most plausible; and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the event and the administration of study drug and/or a causal relationship is considered biologically implausible.  
• Unlikely Related:  This category applies to an AE that could reasonably be considered 
caused by something else, and where there is no known or expected response pattern to the suspected study drug. 
• Possibly Related:  This categ ory applies to an AE that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the study drug and that follows a known or expected 
response pattern to the suspected study drug, but that could readily have been produced 
by a number of other factors. 
12.3. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Serious Adverse Drug 
Reactions  
Any SAE that occurs at any time during the study, including a clinically significantly abnormal 
laboratory test result that is considered serious, must be reported to Tonix or its designee( s) so 
that Tonix may comply with regulatory obligations. For these and all other SAEs, an SAE report form must be completed and sent by facsimile or email to Tonix or its designee(s) within  24 
hours of the site’s initial awareness of the event . These requirements apply equally to all patients, 
regardless of the study phase or the at- risk patient’s treatment assignme nt or dosage.

TNX- 601 ER  Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol TNX -TI-M201   Page 53 
 
Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 A serious adverse event (experience) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose: 
• Results in death, 
• Is life -threatening, 
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or 
• Is an important medical event 
NOTE:  The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
patient was at risk of death at the time of the  event . It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medi cal events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment  in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
A death occurring during the study, during the per-protocol follow-up period, or reported to the 
Investigator after study participation  must be reported to Tonix or its designee(s) immediately, whether or not it is consi dered treatment -related .  
SAEs report forms must be submitted to  within 24 hours of 
the site/investigator’s awareness of the event via facsimile or email:  
 
 
For questions pertaining to the reporting of SAEs or the completion of SAE documentation, site personnel should call the  
 
I
nitial SAE reports must be followed by detailed descriptions . These may include copies of 
hospital case records and other documents when requested. All facsimile and email submissions 
will be confirmed by Rho Product Safety within 1 business day of receipt.

13.4.2. Primary Efficacy Estimand 
Population 
The analysis population will be ITT patients with MDD as defined by the protocol 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
Variable  
56 of 90
TNX- 601 ER  Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol TNX -TI-M201   Page 57 
 
Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 The primary endpoint will be the change from B aseline  (Visit 2)  to Week 6 in the MADRS total 
score.  
Intercurrent Events  
Concomitant med ications and all other intercurrent events other than discontinuation will use a 
treatment policy strategy; data will be analyzed as observed. A hypothetical strategy will be 
employed to handle intermittent missing data and discontinuation. Missing data wi ll be imputed 
via MI, and details regarding the MI approach will be described in the SAP. 
Population- Level Summary  
The population- level summary will be the difference in least- square means between treatment 
arms (analyzed as randomized) at Week 6.  
The pri mary efficacy analysis will use a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) approach to 
estimate mean change from baseline to Week 6 in the MADRS total score  visit in the TNX-601 
ER and placebo arms . The model will include all patients in the ITT population, and the 
dependent variable will be the observed change from baseline in the MADRS total score at each 
post-randomization in -clinic visit. Covariates in the model will include the fixed categorical 
effects of treatment, site, visit, and treatment by visit interaction, as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline score and baseline score by visit interaction . Missing data will be imputed 
via MI, and details regarding the MI approach will be described in the SAP.  
The primary analysis will be followed by several sensitivity analyses. Further details on 
sensitivity analyses can be found in the SAP. 
13.4.3. Key Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
The key secondary efficacy endpoints will apply estimands paralle l with the primary estimand, 
adjusted for the endpoint in question, but with identical populations and handling of intercurrent 
events . MMRM methodology will be utilized for the continuous secondary endpoints, and 
analyses will be based on the ITT population. The dependent variable will be the observed 
change from baseline in the respective secondary endpoint at each post- randomization visit. 
Covariates in the model will include the fixed categorical effects of treatment, site, visit, and 
treatment by visit interaction, as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline score and baseline score by visit interaction .  
To adjust for multiplicity and to control for overall type I error, a sequential test procedure will be applied to the key secondary efficacy endpoints. If the primary analysis produces a result that 
is statistically significant, a nominal significance level will be used for comparing the secondary 
endpoints in an ordered fashion. If the analysis for a secondary endpoint does not produce a statistically significant result, then the remaining secondary endpoint analyses will automatically 
be considered non- significant regardless of the p -value produced. In the case of an increase in 
sample size, the same methodology/critical value used for the primary endpoint will be applied to the key secondary endpoints for the purposes of the sequential testing.  The order in which the secondary endpoints are to be tested will be specified in the SAP. 
No other adjustments for multiplicity will be made and other p -values displayed in the output 
will be considered for descriptive summary purposes only and will not be used for formal

Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 inference. Full details regarding the statistical analyses for the listed endpoints will be provided 
in the SAP. 
13.4.4. Exploratory Analyses  
Exploratory efficacy analyses will be based on the ITT population. Details on exploratory 
efficacy analyses can be found in the SAP. 
13.5. Safety Analyses  
Safety analyses will be performed using the Safety Population. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by:  
•    Inciden ce of AEs and SAEs throughout the entire duration of the study 
• Incidence of AEs associated with abuse liability using the MADDERS
®  
• Assessment of physical examination findings 
• Changes from baseline (Visit 2)  in ECG results  
• Changes from baseline (Visit 2)  in clinical laboratory test results  
• Changes from baseline (Visit 2)  in vital signs and weight 
• Indications of increased suicidal ideation or behavior as assessed by the C- SSRS  
• Changes from baseline (Visit 2)  in patient- rated CSFQ -14 in males and in females, 
assessed separately  
• Change from baseline Visit 5 or End of T reatment) in the SOWS at the safety 
follow-up visit 
Adverse events will be coded using MedDRA and will be summarized overall and by preferred 
term and system organ class . Adverse events will also be summarized by severity and 
relationship to study drug. Serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug will 
also be summarized . Actual values and chan ges from baseline for responses on the CSFQ-14, 
and actual values and changes from baseline in clinical laboratory test results, ECG parameters, vital signs, and weight will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum). AEs associated with abuse liability of the study drug will be 
evaluated using the MADDERS
®. Withdrawal symptoms associated with the study drug after the 
End of T reatment  (Visit 5 /ET) will be evaluated using the SOWS.  
The number of patients with suicidal behaviors, ideations and acts based on the C- SSRS will be 
tabulated by treatment group and listed. Physical examination data will be presented in data 
listings.  
13.6. Interim Analyses  
An interim analysis will be performed once approximately 50% of the planne d patients have 
enrolled and those patients have either completed the study or discontinued early. The purpose of the interim will be to evaluate the study for futility and pot entially increase the sample size to 
maintain statistical power conditioned on the results of the first 50% of patients . The study team

TNX- 601 ER  Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol TNX -TI-M201   Page 59 
 
Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 will only be informed of the recommendation to halt the study for futility, maintain the original 
sample size,  or to increase the sample size (by a fixed, pre- specified amount) . All 
recommendations by the statistical review committee  are non -binding.   
For the primary and key secondary outcomes, the results from before and after the interim will be combined with Cui, Hung, Wang (CHW) methodology ( Cui, 1999) . Full details of the interim 
analysis procedure and steps to maintain treatment blinding of the study team will be described 
in the SAP and the Interim Analysis Charter and finalized prior to execution of the interim analys is.  
14. PROCEDURES FOR MODIFYING THE PROTOCOL OR 
TERMINATING THE STUDY  
14.1. Protocol Modifications and Deviations  
The Investigator will make all reasonable efforts to comply with the written protocol and 
protocol amendments. All protocol modifications must be reviewed and approved by the 
appropriate ethics committee  (EC)/Institutional Review Board ( IRB) before the revised protocol 
can be implemented . Emergency revisions that eliminate an apparent hazard to patients do not 
require preapproval by the EC/IRB. However, the EC/IRB must be notified, in writing, as soon as possible after the modification has been made. A copy of this communication must be forwarded to Tonix. 
14.2. Study Termination  
The study may be prematurely terminated at any time at the discretion of Tonix, its designee, or the P rincipal Investigator. Should premature termination be considered necessary, written 
notification documenting the reason for study termination will be provided, and specific 
procedures for termination will be arranged. Circumstances that may warrant premature study 
termination include, but are not limited to, the following. 
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to patients  
• Failure to enter patients at an acceptable rate  
• Insufficient adherence to the requirements of the protocol  
• Insufficient provision of complete and evaluable data 
• Plans to modify, suspend, or discontinue development of the study drug 
In the event that the study is terminated prematurely, all study materials must be returned to 
Tonix or its designee.

 15. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
This protocol is written in accordance with the principles established by the 18th World Medical 
Assembly General Assembly  (World Medical Association, 2013) and amendments and 
clarifications adopted by subsequent General Assemblies. The I nvestigator will make sure that 
the study described in this protocol is conducted in full conformance with those principles, the 
protocol, current FDA regulations, International Council on Harmonisation ( ICH) Good Clinical 
Practices (GCP) guidelines, Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) guidelines, local ethical and regulatory requirements, including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, U.S. applicable Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR title 21), any EC requirements relative to clinical studies . As 
required by the United States  Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ), the study drug may not be 
shipped to any participating Investigator until the requisite study documentation has been submitted an  investigational new drug ( IND) application . 
Should a conflict arise, the Investigator will follow whichever law or guideline affords the greater protection to the individual patient. The Investigator will also make sure he or she is 
thoroughly familiar with the appropriate administration and potenti al risks of administration of 
the study drug, as described in this protocol and the Investigator’s Brochure, prior to the initiation of the study. 
15.2. Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (EC/IRB) Review  
The EC/IRB must be a properly constituted board or committee operating in accordance with 21 
CFR Part 56, “ IRBs .”  This protocol, any protocol amendments, the associated ICFs, and the 
informed consent procedures must be submitted to the EC/IRB for review and approved before 
the enrollment of any patient into the trial.  
All types of patient recruitment or advertising information must be submitted to Tonix or its designee and to the EC/IRB for review and approval prior to implementation. EC/IRB approval of any protocol amendments must be received before any of the changes outlined in the 
amendments are put into effect, except when the amendment has been enacted to eliminate a 
potential hazard to study patients. In such cases, the chair of the EC/IRB should be notified immediately , and the amendment forwarded to the EC/IRB for review and approval. 
15.3. Written Informed Consent  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain signed written informed consent from each 
potential study patient prior to the conduct of any screening or other study procedures. This 
written informed consent will be obtained after the methods, objectives, and potential risks of the study have been fully explained to the potential patient. The Investigator must explain to each 
patient that he or she is completely free to refuse to enter  the study or to withdraw from it at any 
time.  
The patient should also be asked in the ICF for permission for the P rincipal Investigator or their  
designee to contact the patient’s other personal physicians, as appropriate, concerning participation in the study.

Clinical Trial Protocol TNX -TI-M201   Page 61 
 
Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 The method of obtaining and documenting informed consent and the contents of the ICF will 
comply with ICH GCP  guidelines, the requirements of 21 CFR Part 50, “Protection of Human 
Patients,” the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations, and all 
other applicable regulatory requirements. A properly executed written ICF shall be read, signed, 
and dated by each patient prior to entering the trial or prior to performing any study procedure. 
The original signed and dated ICF w ill be kept on file at the study site . Patients will be given a 
copy of the signed ICF and will be informed of any new developments during the course of the study that might influence their continued participation in the study. 
The Investigator or a qualified designee will be available to answer each patient’s questions 
throughout the study, and all questions must be answered to the patient’s satisfaction. If the 
protocol is amended and a revised ICF is introduced during the study, each patient’s further 
consent must be obtained. The new version of the ICF must be approved by the EC, prior to 
subsequently obtaining each patient’s consent. 
Receipt of written informed consent will be documented in each patient’s or potential patient’s 
CRF . The signed ICF must remain in each patient’s study file and must be available for 
verification by study monitors at all times.  
Separate written, signed informed consent must be obtained if the patient is to participate in the optional pharmacogenomic assessment. 
16. DATA HANDLING  AND RECORDING KEEPING  
16.1. Maintaining Privacy and Confidentiality  
In order to maintain patient privacy, all CRFs, study drug accountability records, and other documents, including communications between the study site and Tonix, will identify patients  
only by their initials or their assigned study identification numbers. If required, the Investigator will grant monitors and auditors from Tonix or its designee and/or regulatory authority’s access to patients’ original medical records for verification of the data gathered on the CRFs and to 
audit the data collection process . Patients’  confidentiality will be maintained and will not be 
made publicly available.  
16.2. Maintaining Essential Clinical Documents  
Study site files for the retention of regulatory documents will be established at the beginning of the study, maintained for the duration of the study, and retained according to FDA and ICH/GCP 
guidelines and applicable regulatory requirements . The records maintained must be adequate to 
fully document appropriate protection of study patients /patients, the validity of the study, the 
integrity of the data, and the manner in which the study was conducted. 
The Investigator’s site file, copies of protocols, CRFs, originals of test result reports, drug 
disposition logs, correspondence, records of written informed consent, and other docum ents 
pertaining to the conduct of the study must be kept on file by the Investigator and in readily 
accessible order for at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application, until at least 2 years have elapsed after formal discontinuation o f the clinical development of the 
investigational product, or according to local regulatory requirements. No study document may

TNX- 601 ER  Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol TNX -TI-M201   Page 62 
 
Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 be destroyed without prior written consent from Tonix or its designee. Should the Investigator 
wish to withdraw from the responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must be 
transferred to a person willing to accept the responsibility. Tonix must be notified in writing in advance if a custodial change is to occur . It is important that the Investigator remain ready to 
provide background information from the archived study records on request. 
The sponsor or designee will maintain adequate study records for at least 2 years after the last 
approval of a marketing application or for at least 2 years after clinical development of the study 
drug for the indication being studied has been discontinued. After that period, the sponsor will be 
contacted to determine whether the study records will be forwarded to the sponsor, destroyed, or kept at the location of the designee or another facility for a longer period of time. 
16.3. Data Handling  
Unless otherwise specified, procedures, data collection and evaluation will be conducted as per the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) of the contract research organization  (CRO ). The 
Investigator will a ssume the responsibility of ensuring the completeness and accuracy of the 
clinical data . All data will be verified for quality control and will also be subject  to audits from 
Tonix or designee to ensure quality. 
All laboratory results will be analyzed by a n accredited and licensed clinical laboratory facility . 
Clinical laboratory data will be transferred from the central laboratory to the clinical database 
maintained by the CRO using systems which are validated and Part 11-compliant. 
The responsible clinica l study monitor(s) will check data at the monitoring visits to the clinical 
study site. The I nvestigator will ensure that the data collected  are accurate, complete, and legible. 
Any changes made to the clinical data will be documented with a full audit trail.  
Aspects of the clinical and statistical phases of the study, including all associated documentation 
may be reviewed by the Quality Assurance Unit of the CRO  using a risk- assessment approach . 
The final clinical and statistical report will be au dited to ensure that, as far as can be reasonably 
established, the methods described and the results reported accurately reflect the raw data 
generated during the study. 
16.4. Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
The Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study patient . 
Data must be recorded on CRFs approved by Tonix or its designee. Data (including AEs) will be recorded on raw data sheets and/or electronic or paper source documents. 
If selected data is collected via paper (patient  questionnaires, etc.), the data must be entered into 
the electronic case report form ( eCRF ) and verified that it has been transcribed correctly. 
16.5. Screening Records  
A record generated by IWRS must be kept of all patients considered for the study who sign 
informed consent and who began any screening procedures. The information should include the patient’ s sex at birth, age at Screening  (Visit 1) , and unique patient  identification numbers, 
whether they passed or failed screening, and, if they failed, the reason for SF .

Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 16.6. Clinical Laboratory Certification  
A central clinical laboratory will be used to analyze all samples in this study, with the exception 
of the urine pregnancy test and ad hoc urine drug screens. The Investigator must maintain, on 
file, written evidence that the central clinical laboratory to be used is certified under the Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Act or equivalent certification (depending on local regulations) . 
Further, the Investigator will maintain a copy of the certification, the range of normal values, the effective dates for the ranges, and the units of measurement for all laboratory tests requested in the protocol. If any of the laboratory measurements will be transformed and/or categorized in 
any way, a description of the procedures(s) used should be included. The Investigator is expected 
to receive these documents before the shipment of clinical supplies.  
16.7. Site Monitoring and Tonix’s Right to Review Records  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed by Tonix and/or its designee will be implemented 
to ensure compliance with FDA and ICH GCP and GLP guidelines. 
Tonix’s designated representative (the monitor or auditor) will contact the Investigator and 
conduct regular visits to the clinical site . The monitor will be expected and allowed to verify the 
Investigator’s qualifications, to inspect clinical site facilities, and to inspect study records, 
including proof of EC/IRB review, with the stipulation that patient  confidentiality will be 
maintained in accordance with local and federal regulations, including HIPAA requirements. The monitor will also be responsible for confirming adherence to the study protocol, inspecting CRFs 
and source documents, and ensuring the integrity of the data. CRFs will be checked for accuracy, 
completeness, and clarity and will be cross -checked for consistency with source documents, 
including laboratory test reports and other patient records . Instances of missing or 
uninterpretable data will be resolved in coordination with the Investigator. 
The monitor/auditor will also investigate any questions concerning adherence to regulatory 
requirements . Any administrative concerns will be clarified and followed. The monitor will 
maintain contact with the site through frequent direct communications with the study site by e-mail, telephone, facsimile, and mail. The Investigator and all other site personnel agree to 
cooperate fully with the monitor and will work in good faith with the monitor to resolve any and all questions raised and difficulties detected by the monitor.  
16.8. Audits and Inspections  
The Investigator understands that regulatory authorities, the EC/IRB, and/or Tonix or their 
designees have the right to access all CRFs , source documents, and other study documentation 
for on -site audit or inspection and will retain this right from the start of the study to at least 
2 years after the last approval of a marketing application or for at least 2  years after clinical 
development of the study drug for the indication being studied has been discontinued. The 
Investigator is required to guarantee access to these documents and to cooperate with and support 
such audits and inspections.

Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 17. CONFIDENTIALITY  
17.1. Protection of Patient Anonymity  
The Investigator must make sure that each patient ’s anonymity is maintained . On CRFs or other 
documents submitted to Tonix or its agent, patient  should not be identified by their names or 
initials , but only by their sex at birth and age at Screening  (Visit 1), and the assigned study 
identification numbers. The Investigator should keep a separate record of the patient  initials, 
names, address, and contact information. Documents that contain the names associated with 
these initials and codes are not for submission to Tonix or its agents (eg, written ICFs ). These 
records should be maintained by the Investigator in strict confidence except to the extent 
necessary to allow auditing by regulatory authorities, Tonix, or its agents. These records should be kept in compliance with HIPAA regulations. 
17.2. Confidentiality of Study Information  
All information relevant to this study, whether supplied by Tonix or its agents to the Investigator or collected by the Investigator in support of this study, is privileged and confidential. The 
Investigator agrees to use this information to carry out the study and will not use it for other 
purposes without written consent from Tonix. It is understood that the Investigator is under obligation to provide Tonix with all data obtained during the study. The information obtained

Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 Population pédiatrique  
La sécurité et l’efficacité de la tianeptine chez les enfants et les adolescents de moins de 18 ans 
n’ont pas été établies. Aucune donnée n’est disponible (voir rubrique 4.4).  
La tianeptine est contre- indiquée chez les enfants et adolescents de moins de 15 ans (voir 
rubrique 4.3).  
Mode d’administration  
Voie orale. Mentions légales complètes  
4.3. Contre -indications  
• Hypersensibilité à la substance active ou à l’un des excipients mentionnés à la rubrique 6.1.  
• Enfants et adolescents de moins de 15 ans.  
 
4.4. Mises en garde spéciales et précautions d'emploi  
Suicides/idées suicidaires ou aggravation clinique  
La dépression est associée à un risque accru d’idées suicidaires, d’auto- agression et de suicide 
(comportement de type suicidaire). Ce risque persiste jusqu’à obtention d’une rémission significative. L’amélioration clinique pouvant ne pas survenir avant plusieurs semaines de 
traitement, les patients devront être surveillés étroitement jusqu’à obtention de cette 
amélioration. L’expérience clinique montre que le risque suicidaire peut augmenter en tout 
début de rétablissement.  
Les patients ayant des antécédents de comportement de type suicidaire ou ceux exprimant des 
idées suicidaires significatives avant de débuter le traitement présentent un risque plus élevé de 
survenue d’idées suicidaires ou de comportements de type suicidaire, et doivent faire l’objet 
d’une surveillance étroite pendant le traitement. Une méta- analyse d’essais cliniques contrôlés 
versus placebo sur l’utilisation d’antidépresseurs chez l’adulte présentant des troubles psychiatriques a montré une augmentation du risque de comportement de type suicidaire chez 
les patients de moins de 25 ans traités par antidépresseurs par rapport à ceux recevant un placebo. Une surveillance étroite des patients, et en particulier de ceux à haut risque, devra 
accompagner le traitement médicamenteux, particulièrement au début du traitement et lors des changements de dose.  
Les patients (et leur entourage) devront être avertis de la nécessité de surveiller la survenue d’une aggravation clinique, l’apparition d’idées/comportements suicidaires et tout changement anormal du comportement et de prendre immédiatement un avis médical si ces symptômes 
survenaient.  
En cas d'anesthésie générale, il convient d'avertir l'anesthésiste réanimateur et d'arrêter le traitement 24 ou 48 heures avant l'intervention.  
En cas d'urgence, l'intervention pourra être néanmoins réalisée sans interruption préalable, 
sous surveillance peropératoire.  
Comme avec tout traitement psychotrope, la prise de ce médicament avec des boissons alcoolisées ou médicaments contenant de l’alcool est déconseillée.  
70 of 90
TNX- 601 ER  Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol TNX -TI-M201   Page 71 
 
Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 A l’arrêt du traitement, il est recommandé, comme avec tous les psychotropes, de réduire la 
posologie pendant 7 à 14 jours.  
En cas d’antécédents de pharmacodépendance ou de dépendance à l’alcool, les malades doivent être surveillés tout particulièrement pour éviter l’augmentation de la posologie.  
Ne pas dépasser les doses recommandées.  
L’association avec les I.M.A.O. est déconseillée (voir rubrique 4.5). Il est nécessaire de laisser un intervalle libre :  
• de deux semaines lorsque la tianeptine est utilisé en relais d’un I.M.A.O.,  
• de 24 heures lorsque un I.M.A.O. est utilisé en relais de la tianeptine.  
Ce médicament contient du saccharose. Son utilisation est déconseillée chez les patients présentant une intolérance au fructose, un syndrome de malabsorption du glucose et du 
galactose ou un déficit en sucrase- isomaltase (maladies héréditaires rares).  
Teneur en sodium  
STABLON contient moins de 1 mmol de sodium (23 mg) par comprimé enrobé et peut donc être considéré comme dépourvu de sodium. Mentions légales complètes  
Population pédiatrique  
STABLON est contre -indiqué chez les enfants et adolescents de moins de 15 ans (voir rubrique 
4.3) et ne devrait pas être utilisé chez les adolescents âgés de 15 à 18 ans. Des 
comportements de type suicidaire (tentatives de suicide et idées suicidaires) et de type hostile 
(principalement agressivité, comportement d'opposition et colère) ont été plus f réquemment 
observés au cours des études cliniques chez les enfants et adolescents traités par antidépresseurs par rapport à ceux traités par placebo. Si, en cas de nécessité clinique, la 
décision de traiter est néanmoins prise, le patient devra faire l’objet d’une surveillance attentive pour détecter l’apparition de symptômes suicidaires. De plus, il n’y a pas de données de 
tolérance à long terme chez l’enfant et l’adolescent, concernant les effets sur la croissance, la 
maturation sexuelle, et le développement cognitif et comportemental.  
4.5. Interactions avec d'autres médicaments et autres formes d'interactions  
Associations déconseillées  
• I.M.A.O irréversibles (iproniazide) : en raison des risques de collapsus ou hypertension paroxystique, 
hyperthermie, c onvulsions, décès.  
4.6. Fertilité, grossesse et allaitement  
Grossesse  
Dans une étude péri - et post -natale, une augmentation des pertes post- implantatoires et post -
natales ont été observées chez les rats à dose maternotoxique (voir rubrique 5.3).  
Il n’existe pas de données ou il existe des données limitées (moins de 300 grossesses) sur 
l’utilisation de la tianeptine chez la femme enceinte.  
71 of 90
TNX- 601 ER  Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol TNX -TI-M201   Page 72 
 
Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 Pour cette raison, il est préférable d’éviter d’utiliser la tianeptine au cours de la grossesse quel 
qu’en soit le terme.  
Le maintien d’un bon équilibre psychique maternel est souhaitable tout au long de la grossesse. 
Si une prise en charge médicamenteuse par tianeptine est nécessaire pour assurer cet 
équilibre, le traitement doit être initié ou poursuivi à dose efficace tout au long de la grossesse 
et si possible en monothérapie et le profil pharmacologique de la molécule doit être pris en compte lors de la surveillance du nouveau- né.  
Allaitement  
Une dysfonction de la sécrétion lactique a été observée chez le rat  à dose maternotoxique (voir 
rubrique 5.3).  
Les antidépresseurs tricycliques sont excrétés dans le lait maternel, l'allaitement est donc déconseillé pendant la durée du traitement.  
Fertilité  
Chez le rat, une étude a montré une diminution des performances reproductives (augmentation 
des pertes pré- implantatoires), à dose maternotoxique. (voir rubrique 5.3).  
L’impact clinique n’est pas connu.  
4.7. Effets sur l'aptitude à conduire des véhicules et à utiliser des machines  
Chez certains patients une baisse de la vigilance est susceptible de se manifester. L'attention 
est donc attirée sur les risques de somnolence attachés à l'emploi de ce médicament 
notamment chez les conducteurs de véhicules et les utilisateurs de machines.  
4.8. Effets indésirables  
Résumé du profil de sécurité :  
Les effets indésirables constatés avec la tianeptine au cours des essais cliniques sont 
d’intensité modérée. Ils consistent principalement en des nausées, constipation, douleurs 
abdominales, somnolence, céphalées, bouche sèche et vertiges. Mentions légales complètes  
Tableau des effets indésirables  
Les effets indésirables suivants ont été observés lors des essais cliniques et/ou de l’utilisation 
post-AMM de la tianeptine et sont classés en fonction de leur fréquence :  
Très fréquent ( >1/10); fréquent ( >1/100, <1/10); peu fréquent ( >1/1000, <1/100); rare 
(>1/10000, <1/1000); très rare (<1/10000), indéterminée (ne pouvant être estimée à partir des 
données disponibles).

Déclaration des effets indésirables suspectés  
La déclaration des effets indésirables suspectés après autorisation du médicament est importante. 
Elle permet une surveillance continue du rapport bénéfice/risque du médicament. Les professionnels de santé déclarent tout effet indésirable suspecté via le système national de déclaration : Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament et des produits de santé (ANSM) et réseau des Centres Régionaux de Pharmacovigilance - Site internet : www.ansm.sante.fr.  
4.9. Surdosage  
Symptômes  
L’expérience relative aux cas d'intoxication aiguë par la tianeptine (quantité maximale: 2250mg, 
ingérée en une seule prise) met principalement en évidence des troubles de la vigilance pouvant aller jusqu’au coma, particulièrement en cas d’intoxications multiples.  
Conduite à tenir  
La tianeptine n’a aucun antidote spécifique connu. En cas d’intoxication aiguë, un t raitement 
symptomatique et une surveillance de routine doivent être mis en place. Un suivi médical en milieu spécialisé est recommandé.  
5. PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES  
5.1. Propriétés pharmacodynamiques  
Classe pharmacothérapeutique : AUTRES ANTI -DEPRESSEURS, code ATC : N06AX14.  
Mécanisme d’action  
La tianeptine est un antidépresseur :  
Chez l'animal, la tianeptine possède les caractéristiques suivantes :  
• la tianeptine augmente l'activité spontanée des cellules pyramidales de l'hippocampe et en accélère la 
récupération après leur inhibition fonctionnelle,  
74 of 90
TNX- 601 ER  Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol TNX -TI-M201   Page 75 
 
Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 • la tianeptine augmente le taux de recapture de la sérotonine par les neurones du cortex et de 
l'hippocampe.  
In vitro, la tianeptine n’a pas d’af finité pour les récepteurs monoaminergiques et n’inhibe pas la 
recapture de la sérotonine (5- HT), de la noradrénaline (NA) ou de la dopamine (DA). La tianeptine 
peut moduler la neuro- transmission glutamatergique synaptique. Mentions légales complètes  
La co ntribution précise de chaque effet à l'activité antidépressive est inconnue.  
Efficacité et sécurité clinique  
Quatre essais en double aveugle, contrôlés, versus placebo, ont été réalisés pour évaluer l'efficacité 
à court terme de la tianeptine dans le traitement des épisodes dépressifs majeurs chez l’adulte : un à doses fixes (37,5 mg, 75 mg), deux avec possibilité d’adaptation posologique à une dose supérieure ou inférieure (dose initiale 37,5 mg, puis 25, 37,5 ou 50 mg) et un chez le patient âgé (311 pat ients 
âgés de 65 ans et plus ; ~100 patients par bras, incluant ~20 patients de plus de 75 ans dans chaque bras) avec possibilité d’adaptation posologique à une dose supérieure en fonction de l’amélioration après 2 semaines de traitement (dose initiale 25 mg puis 25 mg ou 50 mg). Dans les essais chez l’adulte, le critère principal a été l’évolution du score total MADRS par rapport au score initial pour les essais à dose fixe ou flexible.  
A la fin du traitement (6 semaines), l’efficacité de la tianeptine ét ait significative dans les deux 
essais à doses flexibles mais pas dans l’essai à doses fixes. Dans un essai, l'imipramine, utilisée comme comparateur actif, a permis de démontrer la sensibilité de l’essai.  
Dans l’étude réalisée chez le sujet âgé (étude av ec possibilité d’augmenter la posologie), après 8 
semaines de traitement, une efficacité significative de la tianeptine a été démontrée sur le critère principal (évolution du score total HAMD par rapport au score initial). Dans cette étude, l'escitalopram utilisé comme comparateur actif, a permis de démontrer la sensibilité de l’essai.  
Le maintien de l'efficacité antidépressive a été évalué dans un essai de prévention des rechutes et 
des récidives. Les patients considérés comme répondeurs au traitement par  l’investigateur (6 
semaines de traitement « en ouvert » avec la tianeptine à la posologie journalière de 2 à 4 comprimés soit 25 à 50mg par jour) ont été randomisés à tianeptine ou placebo pour une durée supplémentaire de 16,5 mois. La tianeptine a montré  une supériorité d’efficacité statistiquement

 Biotransformation  
La tianeptine est fortement métabolisée par le foie, principalement par bêta -oxydation, sans 
implication des CYP450. Son métabolite principal, l’acide pentanoïque (MC5), est actif et moins puissant que la tianeptine.  
Élimination  
L'élimination de la tianeptine est caractér isée par une demi -vie terminale courte de 3 h avec la 
plupart des métabolites excrétés dans les urines.  
Patients âgés, très âgés et patients fragiles  
Chez les patients âgés, les concentrations plasmatiques de tianeptine ont été augmentées de 30% et celles de MC5 ont été environ doublées après administration unique ou répétée, en comparaison de celles de patients plus jeunes (voir rubrique 4.2).  
Chez les patients très âgés (87 ± 5 ans) ou fragiles (45 ± 9 kg), une augmentation significative du 
Cmax et de l’exposition (aire sous la courbe, ASC) à la tianeptine et au MC5 a été observée après administration unique (voir rubrique 4.2).  
Patients insuffisants rénaux sévères (CLCR < 19ml/min)  
La pharmacocinétique de la tianeptine reste inchangée mais l’expositi on au MC5 est 
approximativement doublée après administration unique et répétée (voir rubrique 4.2).  
Patients atteints de cirrhose hépatique sévère (Classe C, Score de Child -Pugh)  
Les expositions à la tianeptine et au MC5, après l’administration d’une dos e de 12,5mg, sont 
augmentées par rapport à celles de patients adultes dépressifs (voir rubrique 4.2).  
En cas de cirrhose plus légère, comme les alcooliques chroniques, les effets sur les paramètres 
pharmacocinétiques sont négligeables (voir section 4.2).  
5.3. Données de sécurité préclinique  
Les données non cliniques issues des études conventionnelles de génotoxicité et de cancérogenèse 
n’ont pas révélé de risque particulier pour l’homme.  
Dans l’étude de fertilité, une augmentation des pertes pré -implantatoires a été observée à la dose 
maternotoxique de 45 mg/kg/jour (soit 12 fois la dose humaine déterminée selon la surface 
corporelle).  
La tianeptine n’est pas tératogène chez les rats et les lapins.  Dans l’étude péri - et post-natale, une dysfonction de la sécrétion lactique et une augmentation des 
pertes post- implantatoires et post- natales ont été observées chez les rats à la dose maternotoxique 
de 45 mg/kg/jour (soit 12 fois la dose humaine déterminée selon la surface corporelle).

Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of tianeptine have not been established i n children and adolescents under 
18 years of age. No data are available (see section 4.4).  
Tianeptine is contraindicated in children and adolescents under 15 years of age (see section 4.3). 
Method of administration 
Oral use.  
4.3. Contraindications 
• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
• Children and adolescents under 15 years of age.  
4.4. Special warnings and precautions for use  
Suicide/suicidal ideation or clinical worsening  
Depression is associated wi th an increased risk of suicidal ideation, self-harm and suicide (suicidal 
behaviour). This risk persists until significant remission is obtained. As clinical improvement may not be obtained until after several weeks of treatment, patients should be closely monitored until this improvement is achieved. Clinical experience shows that suicide risk may increase in the very early stages of recovery.  
Patients with a history of suicidal behaviour or those expressing significant suicidal thoughts prior to treatmen t present a higher risk of suicidal ideation or suicidal behaviour and should therefore be 
monitored closely during treatment. A meta- analysis of placebo -controlled clinical trials of the use 
of antidepressants in adults with psychiatric disorders has shown an increased risk of suicidal behaviour in patients under 25 years of age treated with antidepressants compared to those receiving placebo. Close monitoring of patients, particularly those at high risk, should accompany medication, particularly at the start of treatment and when adjusting the dose. 
Patients (and their friends and family) should be advised to monitor for clinical worsening, the 
onset of suicidal ideation/behaviour and abnormal changes in behaviour and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur. 
If the patient requires general anaesthesia, the anaesthetist should be informed and the treatment 
should be withdrawn 24 or 48 hours before the procedure. 
In the event of an emergency, the procedure may however be carried out without prior washout, 
under intraoperative monitoring. 
As with any psychotropic treatment, taking this medicinal product with alcoholic beverages or 
medicinal products containing alcohol is not recommended. 
When discontinuing the treatment, as with all psychotropic medicinal products, it is recommended 
to reduce the dose over 7 to 14 days. 
Patients with a history of drug dependence or alcohol dependence should be monitored particularly 
closely in order to prevent an increase in the posology. 
Do not exceed the recommended doses.

Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 Treatment in combination with MAOIs is not recommended (see section 4.5). It is necessary to 
leave a washout period: 
• of two weeks when switching from an MAOI to tianeptine, 
• of 24 hours when switching from tianeptine to an MAOI. 
This medicin e contains sucrose. Use in patients with fructose intolerance, glucose- galactose 
malabsorption or sucrase- isomaltase deficiency (rare hereditary disorders) is not recommended.  
Sodium content  
STABLON contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per coated table t and can therefore be 
considered sodium- free. 
Paediatric population 
STABLON is contraindicated in children and adolescents under 15 years of age (see section 4.3) and should not be used in adolescents aged 15 to 18 years. Suicidal behaviour (attempted suicide and suicidal ideation) and hostility (primarily aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger) have been more frequently observed in clinical studies in children and adolescents treated with antidepressants compared to those treated with placebo. If clinical circumstances lead to treatment being initiated, the patient s hould be carefully monitored for the onset of suicidal symptoms. In 
addition, there are no long- term safety data in children and adolescents regarding effects on 
growth, sexual maturity and cognitive and behavioural development. 
4.5. Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Combinations to avoid 
• Irreversible MAOIs (iproniazid): due to the risk of collapse or paroxysmal hypertension, hyperthermia, 
convulsions and death.  
4.6. Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy  
In a peri - and postnatal study, an increase in postimplantation and postnatal loss was observed in 
rats at maternally toxic doses (see section 5.3).  
There are no data or limited data (fewer than 300 pregnancies) on the use of tianeptine in pregnant 
women. 
It is therefore preferable to avoid using tianeptine in pregnancy whatever the term. Maintaining good maternal psychological stability is desirable throughout pregnancy. If 
pharmaceutical management with tianeptine is necessary to ensure this stability, the treatment must be initiated or continued at an effective dose throughout pregnancy and if possible as monotherapy, and the pharmacological profile of the drug must be considered during neonatal monitoring. 
Breastfeeding  
Dysfunction in milk secretion has been observed in rats at maternally toxic doses (see section  5.3). 
As tricyclic antidepressants are excreted into breast milk, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment.

Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 Fertility  
In rats, a study has shown decreased reproductive performance (incre ased preimplantation loss) at a 
maternally toxic dose. (see section 5.3). 
The clinical impact is unknown. 
4.7. Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Some patients may experience decreased alertness. Attention is therefore drawn to the risks of 
somnolence associated with the use of this medicinal product, particularly for individuals driving vehicles and using machinery. 
4.8. Undesirable effects  
Summary of safety profile: 
The undesirable effects observed with tianeptine during clinical trials are of moderate severity. They primarily consist of nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, somnolence, headaches, dry mouth and dizziness.  
Table of side effects  
The following side effects have been observed in clinical trials and/or post-marketing use of tianeptine and are listed according to their frequency:

 4.9. Overdose  
Symptoms  
Experience of cases of acute tianeptine poisoning (maximum quantity: 2,250 mg, taken in a single dose) has primarily shown impaired alertness that may develop into coma, particularly in cases of multiple poisoning. 
Action to take 
Tianeptine has no known specific antidote. In cases of acute poisoning, symptomatic treatment and routine monitoring should be initiated. Medical monitoring in a specialist setting is recommended. 
5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: OTHER ANTI -DEPRESSANTS, ATC code: N06AX14.  
Mechanism of action  
Tianeptine is an antidepressant:  
In animals, tianeptine has the following characteristics: 
• tianeptine increases the spontaneous activity of  pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus and 
speeds up their recovery after functional inhibition, 
• tianeptine increases the rate of serotonin reuptake by neurons in the cerebral cortex and 
hippocampus. 
In vitro, tianeptine has no affinity for monoamine receptors and does not inhibit the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT), noradrenaline (NA) or dopamine (DA). Tianeptine may modulate synaptic glutamate neurotransmission. The precise contribution of each effect to antidepressant activity is unknown. 
Efficacy and clinic al safety  
Four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were conducted to assess the short- term efficacy of 
tianeptine in the treatment of major depressive episodes in adults: one at fixed doses (37.5 mg, 75 mg), two with the ability to adapt to a higher or lower dose (starting dose 37.5 mg, then 25, 37.5 or 50 mg) and one in elderly patients (311 patients aged 65 years and over; ~100 patients per arm, including ~20 patients over 75 years of age in each arm) with the ability to increase the dose depending on improvement after 2 weeks of treatment (initial dose of 25 mg then 25 mg or 50 mg). In the clinical trials in adults, the primary endpoint was the change from baseline in the total MADRS score for the fixed or flexible dose trials. 
At the end of treatment (6 weeks), the efficacy of tianeptine was significant in both the flexible 
dose trials but not in the fixed dose trial. In one trial, imipramine was used as an active comparator, making it possible to demonstrate the sensitivity of the trial.  
In the study carried out in elderly patients  (with the ability to increase the dose), after 8 weeks of 
treatment, tianeptine was shown to have significant efficacy in relation to the primary endpoint (change from baseline in the total HAM-D score). In this study, esci talopram was used as an active 
comparator, making it possible to demonstrate the sensitivity of the trial.

Clinical Trial Protocol TNX -TI-M201   Page 85 
 
Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 Maintenance of antidepressant efficacy was assessed in a trial to prevent relapse and recurrence. 
Patients considered by the Investigator to be treatment responders (6 weeks of “open- label” 
tianeptine treatment at a daily posology of 2 to 4 tablets ie 25-50 mg per day) were randomised to tianeptine or placebo for an additional 16.5 months. Tianeptine was shown to have statistically significant superiority in efficacy over placebo (p <0.001) for the primary endpoint of the trial: prevention of relapse or recurrence as measured by time to onset. The incidence of relapse after 6 months of double-blind follow- up was 6% for tianeptine and 22% for placebo. The incidence of 
relapse or recurrence after 18 months of double-blind follow- up was 16% for tianeptine and 36% 
for placebo. 
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption 
Gastrointestinal absorption is rapid and complete. 
Distribution  
Distribution is rapid and is associated with a level of protein binding close to 94%, primarily to 
albumin. 
Biotransformation 
Tianeptine is extensively metabolised in the liver, primarily by beta -oxidation, without CYP450 
involvement. Its primary metabolite, pentanoic acid (MC5), is active and less potent than tianeptine.  
Elimination  
The elimination of tianeptine is characterised  by a short terminal half- life of 3 h with most 
metabolites excreted in the urine.  
Elderly, very elderly and fragile patients  
In elderly patients, plasma concentrations of tianeptine were increased by 30% and those of MC5 approximately doubled after single or repeated administration, in comparison with younger patients (see section 4.2). 
In very elderly (87±5 years) or fragile (45±9 kg) patients, a significant increase in Cmax and 
exposure (area under the curve, AUC) to tianeptine and MC5 was observed after single administration (see section 4.2). 
Patients with severe renal impairment (CRCL <19 ml/min)  
The pharmacokinetics of tianeptine remain unchanged but exposure to MC5 is approximately doubled after single and repeated administration (see section 4.2). 
Patients with severe cirrhosis (Child -Pugh score Class C) 
Exposure to tianeptine and to MC5 after the administration of a single dose of 12.5 mg is increased compared to adult patients with depression (see section 4.2). 
In cases of milder cirrhosis, such as  patients with chronic alcoholism, the effects on 
pharmacokinetic parameters are negligible (see section 4.2).

Version 2.0, 02 March  2023   
 5.3 Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data from conventional genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies have identified no 
specific risks for hu mans.  
In the fertility study, an increase in preimplantation loss was observed at the maternally toxic dose 
of 45 mg/kg/day (12 times the human dose determined by body surface area). 
Tianeptine is not teratogenic in rats and rabbits. In the peri - and postnatal study, dysfunction in milk secretion and increased postimplantation and 
postnatal loss were observed in rats at the maternally toxic dose of 45 mg/kg/day (12 times the 
human dose determined by body surface area).

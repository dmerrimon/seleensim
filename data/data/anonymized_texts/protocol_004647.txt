Study Design:  
This is a phase 2, double masked, randomized, multi -center, parallel -group, 28 -day study assessing the safety, 
tolerability and ocular hypotensive efficacy of AKB -9778 Ophthalmic Solution 4.0% administered once (AM) or twice 
(AM & PM) daily when used as an  adjunctive therapy to  latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% once daily (PM) in 
subjects with elevated IOP due to OAG or OHT.  Eligible subjects are required to have a diagnosis of either OAG or 
OHT in each eye and are on stable dose of topical prostaglandin eye drops (for at least 2 weeks prior to screening) . 
Subjects eligible to be enrolled in this study must meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria . Subjects 
who agree to participate in this study and are randomized in the study will attend a total of 6 study visits: a Screening Visit, Qualification Visit #1, Qualification Visit #2/Day  -1 (Baseline) , and visits on Days 7, 14 and 28. After 
completion of the Screening Visit, subjects will undergo a minimum 4 -week washout period from IO P lowering 
treatment prior to attending Qualification Visit #1. Subjects will receive an eye examination including IOP 
measurements at Qualification Visits #1 and #2 /Day  -1.  If deemed eligible,  subjects  will be enrolled at Qualification 
Visit #2 /Day  -1 and assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms (AKB -9778 QD + Latanoprost; AKB -9778 BID + Latanoprost; 
or Latanoprost monotherapy) in a 1:1:1 ratio according to a computer -generated randomization list. Subject 
randomization will be stratified  by mean diurnal IOP o n Day  -1 (< 26 mmHg vs ≥ 26 mmHg)  in the study eye . During 
the treatment period,  randomized  subjects will self-administer study medication (AKB- 9778 4.0%  or placebo  for AKB -
9778 ) daily in the AM and PM and will also administer 0.005% latanoprost ophthalmic  solution  daily in the PM. Daily 
AM dose administration of study medication should occur between 7:00 and 10:00 hours and PM dose administration 
should occur between 19:00 and 22:00 hours. Latanoprost PM dose administration will occur at least 5 minutes be fore 
administration of the PM dose of study medication. Subjects will begin dosing with the AM dose of study medication 
on the morning of Day 1 and conclude dosing after administration of  the AM dose of study medication on Day 28 
(there is no PM dose on Da y 28) . At visits conducted on Days 14 and 28, subjects will self-administer  the AM dose of 
study medication at the site after the 8:00 hour ophthalmic assessments have been completed . During the treatment 
period, subjects will be seen in the clinic on Days  7, 14 and 28; safety assessments will be conducted on all days and 
efficacy measurements (IOP) will be conducted on Days 14 and 28 at the following time points: 08:00, 10:00, 12:00 and 16:00 hours. Following completion of the Day 28 study visit procedures , subjects will exit from the study. For 
subjects who discontinue early, every possible effort will be made to assure there is an exit visit that includes all 
required examinations for the Day 28 visit.  
Number of Subjects Planned:  
Approximately 195 subjects are planned to be randomized  (approximately 65 per treatment group) .  
Number of Sites Planned:  
Approximately  25 sites across the USA are planned.   
Duration of Treatment: 28 days  
Duration of Participation : 
The Screening, Washout , Qualification Visit s and Treatment periods will require subject participation for up to  
approximately 1 1 weeks.

administration will occur at least 5 minutes before administration of the PM dose of study medication.   
Statistical Methods:  
Primary Estimand  
The primary comparisons in this trial will be between two doses of AKB- 9778 (QD and BID) + Latanoprost  vs 
Latanoprost monotherapy  at the Day 28 Visit in the ITT population with intercurrent events handled as described in the 
following estimand.    
• Populati on: subjects with Open -Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension defined through enrolment  criteria  
• Endpoint:  
- Mean diurnal  (averaged over 08:00, 10:00, 12:00,  and 16:00 hour  time points ) change from baseline IOP 
(mm Hg) at the Day 28 Visit in the study eye  
• Intercurrent event:  
- Discontinuation of study medication  and non -optimal compliance will be ignored [treatment policy 
strategy].  
- Withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or adverse event: miss ing data will be imputed employing Multiple 
Imputation (MI) assuming missing not at random using:  
▪     Control -based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology [hypothetical strategy].  
- Missing data without withdrawal or withdrawal due to reasons other than lack of efficacy or adverse 
event: missing data will be imputed employing Multiple Imputation (MI) assuming missing at random

strategy].  
• Population -level summary:  
- The difference in the mean diurnal change from baseline IOP at the Day 28 Visit, between study eyes 
treated with each dose of AKB -9778 (QD and BID) + Latanoprost and study eyes treated with 
Latanoprost monotherapy  
Sensitivity analyses will be performed on observed data only and where worst time consistent observation within a 
subject is carried forward for withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or adverse event and last time consistent observation within a subject is carried forward for other missi ng data.  
The primary analysis of the primary efficacy outcome will employ a linear model with Day 28 mean diurnal change 
from baseline IOP as the response, baseline IOP  (mean  diurnal  IOP on Day -1) as a covariate, and treatment as a main 
effect factor, usin g the intent to treat population with multiple imputation techniques used to impute missing data.  
The least squares mean differences (test – control) between AKB -9778 + Latanoprost and Latanoprost monotherapy 
will be presented as well as 2 -sided p- values and 95% confidence intervals. Inference will be made on the p -value < 
0.05.  
Sixty -five (65) subjects per arm completing 28 days of treatment yields 80% power to conclude statistical superiority 
of AKB -9778  (QD or BID)  + Latanoprost   to Latanoprost monotherapy assuming a two -sided alpha = 0.05, a true 
difference in mean diurnal change from baseline IOP  of 1.5 mmHg,  a common standard deviation of 3.5  mmHg at 
each time point, and a correlation of 0.60 among time points within a subject’s study eye (leading to an SD of the 
mean diurnal IOP of 3.0 mmHg) .  
An interim analysis for futility is planned to be performed when 50% of randomized subjects have completed 28 days of therapy.

Page 18 of 89  4.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
Open angle glaucoma  (OAG) is a leading cause of blindness affecting approximately 44.7 
million people worldwide with an estimated prevalence in the United States of 2.7 million in 
2011, which is expected to increase to 7.3 million by 2050 ( Tham et al., 2014; Vajaranant et al. 
2012; Vajaranant et al., 2012b).  OAG is characterized by optic nerve and neuroretina anomalies and progressive visual field defects. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP)/ Ocular hypertension 
(OHT ) is the primary modifiable risk factor and reducing IOP is the only clinical approach 
shown to slow/prevent vision loss ( Gordon et al., 2002; Heijl et al., 2002 ; Kass et al., 2002; 
Leske et al., 2007). Despite the availability of effective IOP lowering drugs, many patients require multiple agents to control IOP that together often fail to achieve a “target” IOP ( Aptel et 
al., 2015).   
Aerpio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Aerpio) is developing AKB -9778 Ophthalmic Solution as a 
treatment for OAG. AKB -9778 is a novel small molecule which selectively inhibits VE -PTP 
(vascular endothelial -protein tyrosine phosphatase), otherwise known as HPTPβ (human protein 
tyrosine phosphatase β), and enhances Tie2 (tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin -like and 
Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF)-like domains 2) activation and signaling . Recent findings 
suggest that An giopoietin (Angpt)/Tie2 pathway activation may have therapeutic benefit in 
patients with OAG and OHT by directly targeting the conventional outflow (CO) pathway. The CO pathway, consisting of the trabecular meshwork (TM) and a specialized vessel called 
Schlemm’s canal, controls IOP under normal physiology and has been identified as the site of 
increased resistance to aqueous humor (AH) outflow in OAG ( Grant, 1951; Grant, 1963; Stamer 
and Acott, 2012). Importantly, a vast majority of topical ocular OAG therapies do not target CO, but rather reduce IOP by either decreasing the formation of AH or facilitating unconventional outflow pathways. The failure of current thera pies to modify CO has been hypothesized to 
contribute to continued deterioration of the CO pathway and progressive increases in IOP over time (Braunger et al., 2015; Stamer, 2012). Relative to c urrent therapies, developing agents that 
target CO pathology directly may have improved efficacy either alone or in combination with approved glaucoma agents, and may prevent progression of OAG that often occurs despite current therapy.  
4.1 Rationale 
Schlemm’s  canal develops postnatally from the intrascleral venous plexus but has a “hybrid” 
phenotype characterized by expression of lymphatic endothelial as well as blood endothelial markers (Aspelund et al., 2014; Hamanaka et al., 1992; Kizhatil et al., 2014 ; Park et al., 2014; 
Truong et al., 2014).  Tie2, the receptor for the Angpt family of secreted proteins, is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on both blood and lymph endothelial cells and is required for development of both vascular systems ( Augustin et al., 2009 ; Morisada et al., 2005; Peters et al., 
2004; Saharinen et al., 2017; Tammela et al., 2005). Tie2 is constitutively expressed and activated in the normal adult blood vasculature, consistent with  the established role of the Tie2 
pathway in maintenance of endothelial function and vascular stability ( Wong et al., 1997). 
Recently, two independent groups have shown that Tie2 is expressed and activated in Schlemm’s canal end othelial cells during development and in the mature vessel (Bernier -Latmani and

Aerpio  — Company Confidential 
Page 19 of 89  Petrova, 2017; Kim et al., 2017; Thomson et al., 2014) .  Disruption of the Tie2 pathway in mice, 
by conditional knockout of Tie2 or both Tie2 ligands (Angpt1 and Angpt2) early in postnatal 
development (postnatal day 1), results in failure of the formation of Schlemm’s canal, associated with increased IOP with retinal and optic nerve p athology resembling human congenital 
glaucoma ( Kim et al., 2017; Thomson et al., 2014).  Tie2 pathway disruption later in postnatal 
development (8 weeks) results in degeneration of Schlemm’s canal w ith development of 
increased IOP and retinal and optic pathology reminiscent of OAG ( Kim et al., 2017 ).  Tie2 is 
most highly expressed in mature inner wall endothelium of Schlemm’s canal and disruption of the Tie2 pathway results in increased apoptosis and reduced formation of giant vacuoles consistent with compromised CO. Supporting these preclinical findings, Tie2 loss of function variants were identified in 10 of 189 unrelated primary congenital glaucoma families, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Angpt1, the Tie2 activating ligand, were significantly associated with the risk of OAG ( Bailey et al., 2017; Choquet et al., 2017 ; Kabra et al., 2017; 
Souma et al., 2016). The preclinical findings, along with human genetic evidence, suggest that activation of the Angpt/Tie2 pathway in Schlemm’s canal could provide a novel CO- targeted 
OAG therapy.  
VE-PTP is a receptor tyrosine phosphatase that is co -expressed with Tie2 in vascular endothelial 
cells that functions as a pivotal negative regulator of Tie2 activation (Shen et al., 2014). AKB-9778 is a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of the catalytic activity of VE -PTP.  
Pharmacologic inhibition of VE -PTP with AKB -9778 restores Tie2 activation independent of the 
presence or absence of Tie2 ligands Angpt1 and Angpt2.  Consistent with a role for VE -PTP in 
regulation of CO, subcutaneous (SC) administration of AKB-9778 reduced IOP in subjects with diabetic macular edema and nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy.  Topical ocular administration of AKB-9778 reduced IOP more than subcutaneous AKB-9778 adm inistration in rabbits and 
decreased IOP in mice in association with  increased Tie2 activation in Schlemm’s canal 
endothelium and increased outflow facility. Data in normotensive dogs indicate that topical ocular administration of AKB -9778 immediately following topical ocular dosing of 0.005% 
latanoprost is well tolerated and has an additive IOP -lowering effect relative to latanoprost alone.  
Moreover, in a recently completed Phase 1b study, topical ocular administration of AKB-9778 once a day for 7 days wa s well tolerated (minimal to mild conjunctival hyperemia only) and 
significantly reduced IOP in a cohort of OHT/OAG patients on standard of care prostaglandin therapy.  Taken together, these data support development of AKB-9778 Ophthalmic Solution as a novel CO targeted treatment for OAG/OHT  and provide strong rationale for the current study 
with AKB-9778 as an adjunct to latanoprost. 
4.2 Summary of Non- Clinical Experience 
Please see the AKB -9778 Ophthalmic Solution Investigator Brochure for additional discussion 
and information for the following section. The nonclinical experience for AKB -9778 Ophthalmic Solution is supported by a comprehensive 
set of in vitro and systemic pharmacology and nonclinical studies completed during the 
development of the AKB-9778 SC  Injection program, including evaluation in multiple 
retinopathy models, safety pharmacology studies, pharmacokinetic (PK) and metabolism studies, 
toxicology studies in rats, dogs, and monkeys, embryo- fetal development studies in rats and

Page 20 of 89  rabbits, and genotoxicity studies . Some of these studies are briefly summarized in the sections 
below, as well as the nonclinical studies for topical ocular administration of AKB -9778. 
4.2.1 Preclinical Pharmacology 
AKB-9778 is a highly optimized small molecule inhibi tor of the VE -PTP catalytic phosphatase 
domain that restores Tie2 activation and downstream signaling. Supporting a role in regulation of 
IOP, VE -PTP inhibition triggers signaling  pathways downstream of Tie2 that have been 
implicated in modulation of CO facility including endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) 
activation and Rho pathway inhibition via Ras- related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1)/ 
Ras-proximate 1 (Rap1) activation (Frye et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2014).  In ocular normotensive 
mice, topical ocular administration of AKB -9778 activated Tie2 in Schlemm’s canal 
endothelium after a single dose and reduced IOP via increased outflow facility after three days of once a day dosing. 
In norm otensive female New Zealand White rabbits (n = 5/group) administered bilateral topical 
ocular doses (30 μL to both eyes) of 1.5% weight/volume (w/v) AKB -9778 in 15% w/v 
hydroxypropyl- beta-cyclodextrin ( HPβCD ) + 2% w/v dextrose or 4.0% w/v AKB-9778 in 15% 
w/v HPβCD + 1% w/v dextrose either once daily (QD) or BID, or vehicle control (15% w/v 
HPβCD) twice daily  (BID), or subcutaneous administration of 10 mg/kg AKB-9778 BID for 
seven consecutive days, IOP was measured daily at baseline prior to dosing, on each day of 
dosing, and 24 hours after the last dose. Results showed that AKB- 9778 Ophthalmic Solution 
4.0% w/v topically administered either QD or BID reduced IOP, whereas the 1.5% w/v BID topical dose and the 10 mg/kg SC dose were not as effective. IOP reductions persisted through the last assessment 24 hours after the end of dosing.  
Preliminary data from a dog IOP -lowering efficacy study indicates that topical ocular 
administration of 4.0% w/v AKB-9778 in a 15% w/v HPβCD + 1% w/v mannitol formulation 
also lo wers IOP in normotensive dogs. Further, administration of AKB-9778 immediately 
following topical ocular dosing of 0.005% latanoprost was well tolerated and had an additive IOP-lowering effect relative to latanoprost alone.  
Safety Pharmacology 
All in vitro  and in vivo  safety pharmacology assessments were conducted for AKB -9778 SC 
Injection program. In vitro assessments demonstrated very limited interactions with AKB -9778; 
and in vivo safety pharmacology assessments demonstrated no respiratory or neurobehavioral effects in rat and a minimal decrease in blood pressure in dog and no effects on QT interval following SC dosing. 
4.2.2 Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) 
In a 3-day PK study conducted in New Zealand White rabbits, topical ocular instillation of 4.0% 
w/v AKB- 9778 in 15% w/v HPβCD + 1% w/v mannitol three times daily (TID) to both eyes 
(7.2 mg total daily dose) resulted in dose normalized AKB-9778 concentrations in aqueous humor approximately 2-fold higher than achieved with SC BID doses (33 mg total daily dose). By contrast, relative to topical ocular administration, systemic exposure following subcutaneous

Aerpio  — Company Confidential 
Page 21 of 89  administration of the same AKB -9778 formulation had a ~44 -fold greater maximum plasma drug 
concentration  (C max) and 29- fold gre ater area under the concentration- time curve from time 0 to 
last quantifiable concentration  (AUC last), based on dose normalized values. In dogs, following 
bilateral topical ocular instillation of 30μL of 4.0% w/v AKB -9778 in 15% w/v HPβCD + 1% 
w/v mannitol QD (2.4 mg/day), BID (4.8 mg/day), or four times daily (QID, 9.6 mg/day) for 3 
days, plasma half-life (T½) was 0.5 hours and mean plasma C max and AUC values were generally 
similar across groups, suggesting rapid elimination of AKB-9778 between the BID and QID inter-day dosing intervals. There was no evidence for accumulation between the QD, BID, and QID dosing regimens.  
In the Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) 28-day rabbit and dog toxicity studies, quantifiable 
systemic exposure of AKB -9778 in plasma was observed following bilateral topical ocular 
administration of 30 μL of 4% w/v AKB -9778 in 15% w/v HPβCD + 1% w/v mannitol to each 
eye QD (2.4 mg/day), BID (4.8 mg/day), and QID (9.6 mg/day) in males and females on Day 1 and during the last week of dosing (Day 23 for rabbit; Day 26 for dog).  There were no consistent sex-related differences in systemic exposure; however, the data exhibited a high degree of inter-
animal variability. In most cases, an initial peak at ≤ 0.25 hours postdose was observed in the mean concentration-time profiles across all dosing regimens and days; however, a second peak in some cases constituted C
max. Systemic exposure to AKB -9778 was similar (C max and AUC 
approximately within 2-fold) following BID and QID dosing regimens on Day 1 and Days 23 and 26 for rabbits and dogs, respectively. Exposure was generally similar across all three dosing regimens with no evidence of accumulation. 
4.2.3 Toxicology 
Topical Ocular (AKB -9778 Ophthalmic Solution) 
The topical ocular instillation of 4.0% w/v AKB -9778 in 10% w/v to 15% w/v HPβCD -based 
solution formulations has been well tolerated in rabbits and dogs in non-GLP toleration and GLP 
toxicity studies.  
In the 28- day GLP toxicity studies, New Zealand White rabbits and Beagle dogs were 
administered a 30 μL bilateral ocular instillation of 4.0% w/v AKB -9778 in 15% w/v HPβCD + 
1% w/v mannitol (1.2 mg/eye) QD (2.4 mg/day), BID (4.8 mg/day), and QID (9.6 mg/day) for 28 days. In both species, there were no adverse vehicle- or test article -related e ffects on body 
weight, food consumption, clinical pathology, ophthalmologic or IOP parameters, electroretinography, or post- mortem organ weight or macroscopic histological findings.  Test 
article -related clinical observations involved only the eyes and surrounding skin areas for both 
rabbit and dog. 
In rabbit, AKB-9778- related effects were primarily limited to clinical observations that included 
red conjunctiva (palpebral conjunctiva), red skin of the periorbital region, and red eyeballs 
(bulbar conjunctiva) .  Palpebral conjunctiva and periorbital skin redness were observed in all 
drug- treated animals the last 2 weeks of dosing. Periorbital redness was also observed in saline 
and vehicle control animals the last week of dosing but at a lesser incidence. Red eyeballs (red bulbar conjunctiva) were observed only in the test article -treated rabbits at the end of the dosing 
period on Days 28 and 29. In dog, similar results were noted where AKB-9778- related effects

Amendment # 2 Integrated   May 17 , 2020 
  
 
Aerpio  — Company Confidential 
Page 22 of 89  were also limited to clinical observations includin g clear discharge, red eyeballs (bulbar 
conjunctiva), and red conjunctiva (palpebral conjunctiva). Red eyeballs were observed in all but 
one drug- treated animal, in 2/10 vehicle control, and in 2/10 saline control animals beginning the 
second week of dosing. Palpebral conjunctiva redness was observed in all drug-treated dogs during most of the dosing phase, with the earliest onset in dogs treated at 9.6 mg/day. These non-adverse findings in dog and rabbit resolved quickly during the recovery phase. Dose- dependent 
clear ocular discharge was observed in dog at all dose levels, including the vehicle control, but with the greatest incidence following QID dosing, with persistence in the QID group throughout the recovery phase.  
There were no microscopic histopathological findings in the 28-day dog toxicity study. In rabbit, 
marked diffuse unilateral corneal epithelial atrophy was observed in 1 male following QID dosing.  While corneal epithelial atrophy is not a reported background finding in this rabbit strain, the single incidence and unilateral distribution suggest that this is unlikely to be a test article -related effect.  It would be unexpected for a direct test article effect to result in marked 
severity in only a single eye when both eyes were treated identically.  However, a test article -
related effect could not be ruled out due to its occurrence in the high -dose group; therefore, this 
finding was considered to have an uncertain relationship to the administration of the test article. 
The no observed adverse- effect level  (NOAEL ) in the 28-day rabbit and dog toxicity studies was 
considered to be the highest dose administered in each study at 9.6 mg/day (2.4 mg QID). In 
rabbits, this dose was associated with mean combined -sex C
max and estimated AUC 0-24 values of 
20.7 ng/mL and 132 ng·hr/mL, respectively; and, in dogs, of 51.7 ng/mL and 243 ng·hr/mL, respectively.  These exposures numerically describe the margin to human exposure since the 
measured human exposure following topical ocular administra tion of 40 mg/mL AKB -9778 QD 
and BID was below the limit of quantitation (BLQ = <1 ng/mL). 
Systemic (AKB -9778 Injection) 
In the in vivo GLP general, genetic, and reproductive toxicity studies for AKB-9778 Injection, AKB- 9778 was formulated as a solution in  10% w/v HPβCD + 1.7% w/v dextrose and 
demonstrated an excellent safety profile and was well tolerated by SC administration in up to 6 months (182 days) dosing in rats and up to 9 months (273 days) dosing in dogs and monkeys. The primary target tissues for AKB-9778 were identified as injection site and liver in rat, dog and monkey; skin/subcutis (vascular) in dog and monkey; and gastrointestinal (GI; vascular) in dog. The NOAEL  exposures measured in rat, dog, and monkey were, respectively, 4-, 25-, and 
33-fold the AUC value associated with a human dose of 15 mg SC BID.  
No liver findings or unusual or unexpected dermal findings have been observed in clinical 
studies with SC administration of AKB -9778. 
AKB-9778 is not considered to be mutagenic or clastogenic based on the negative findings in the pivotal battery of genotoxicity studies. 
Definitive systemic embryo -fetal development toxicity studies in rat and rabbit with SC 
administration showed no evidence of external fetal teratogenic effects or of skeletal o r visceral

findings on fertility or reproductive outcome.  
4.3 Summary of Clinical Experience  
Please see the AKB -9778 Investigator Brochure for additional discussion and information for 
the following section.  
A robust clinical program has been conducted with a subcutaneous formulation of AKB-9778 
(AKB-9778 SC injection) and a phase 1 study evaluating topical ocular administration of AKB-9778 Ophthalmic Solution in healthy volunteers and subjects with OAG/OHT has recently been completed.  Clinical experience is summarized below . IOP reduction effects observed in studies 
conducted with AKB -9778 are consistent with  preclinical  and genetic evidence for the 
importance of  Tie2 function on the  CO pathway  and support  evaluation of Tie2 activation  by 
AKB- 9778 as a potential  approach for IOP reduction in subjects with  OAG or OHT.  
4.3.1 AKB- 9778 SC Injection  
AKB-9778 SC injection 20 mg/mL has been evaluated under an ongoi ng clinical development 
program in the United States for diabetic eye disease, including diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema. A total of 478 human subjects have been randomized in completed clinical trials evaluating AKB -9778 SC administration (in the abdomen) . Data from the two largest clinical 
trials conducted with this formulation are summarized as follows.  
Study AKB -9778- CI-2003, was a Phase 2, double -masked,  parallel -group trial in which  144 
subjects with  diabetic retinopathy  complicated  by center -involved diabetic macular edema were  
randomized to one  of 3 treatment  groups:  AKB- 9778 (15 mg) SC BID monotherapy;  AKB- 9778 
SC BID plus monthly Lucentis
® (0.3 mg) intravitreal injection  (IVT); and monthly Lucentis®  
IVT monotherapy. Op hthalmic  assessment  at baseline, during and at  the end  of the 3- month 
treatment period, included IOP measurement  by applanation tonometry  in both the study  eye and 
the fellow eye.  Pretreatment  baseline IOP assessment  showed both the study eye and fellow  eyes 
of each treatment  group to be normotensive and well balanced  between  treatment groups. Both  
active AKB- 9778 treatment arms achieved  statistically  significant  reductions  in IOP in both the 
study eye  and the fellow eye  compared to baseline . In the subgroup of subjects with  baseline IOP 
> 16 mm Hg,  a greater  IOP reduction  was achieved.  
Study AKB -9778- CI-50 01, was a Phase 2, double -masked, placebo -controlled, parallel -group 
trial in which 167 subjects with moderate to severe non- proliferative diabetic retinopathy were 
randomized to receive once or twice daily AKB -9778 SC (15 mg) for 12 months. Positive effects 
on IOP reduction were observed  in this study and were similar to those observed in the AKB -
9778- CI-2003 study.  
AKB-9778 SC injection has shown no evidence of significant safety issues to date. A transient, 
generally asymptomatic reduction in blood pressure is observed reflecting the vasodilatory pharmac odynamic effect of Tie-2 activation. Vasovagal events (presyncope/syncope) have been 
observed following the first dose of AKB-9778 at doses >22 mg. A vasovagal event was observed after the first dose in 1/144 (0.7%) subjects in the Phase 2 AKB-9778- CI-2003 study.

Page 24 of 89  This subject did not experience any such events during the subsequent 3 months of dosing. No 
other vasovagal events were observed in this study. In both studies there was a significant correlation between baseline blood pressure ( BP) and change in BP. Specifically, subjects with 
higher BP had greater reductions in BP. To date there has been no evidence of adverse effects on clinical chemistry assessments, including liver function tests, and no evidence of unusual dermal findings. 
4.3.2 AKB- 9778 Ophthalmic  Solution  
A Phase 1b study evaluating AKB-9778 ophthalmic solution has been recently completed. Study 
AKB-9778- CI-OS-1001 was a randomized, double-masked study designed to assess increasing 
concentrations of AKB-9778 dosed topically as eye drops (5mg/mL QD, 15 mg/mL QD, 40 mg/mL QD and 40 mg/mL BID) conducted initially in 4 sequential cohorts of 12 healthy (ocular normotensive subjects), randomized 3:1 to receive AKB-9778 or placebo, for 7 days. The primary outcome of the study was ocular safety and tolerab ility with change in IOP  as a 
pharmacodynamic outcome. Conjunctival hyperemia grade and IOP were assessed prior to dosing and at 2-, 4- and 8-hours post-dose on Day 1 and Day 7. Topical ocular administration of AKB-9778 was well tolerated over 7 days at al l dose levels. Compared to placebo, there was a 
dose dependent increase in minimal to mild conjunctival hyperemia with AKB -9778, which was 
transient and generally considered non- adverse. There was also a time and dose dependent 
reduction in IOP that, in the highest QD dose cohort (40mg/mL) peaked at 4 hours post-dose (- 1.47 mmHg; p = 0.041)/-10.64%; p = 0.027) and was sustained through eight hours on day 7, returning to baseline levels at 24 hours post- dose.  There was a trend towards larger IOP 
decreases with BID dosing in Cohort 4, but hyperemia was similar to Cohort 3 with QD dosing. The results of the bioanalysis of approximately 100 plasma samples from the subjects administered the highest dose (40 mg/mL) indicated almost no systemic exposure (all samp les 
(except 1 sample) were reported as below limit of quantitation  (BLQ) using a bioanalytical 
method with a lower limit of quantification of 1 ng/mL).  As a result, no systemic AEs are anticipated for the topical ophthalmic dosing of AKB-9778. 
No signific ant safety issues were identified in Cohorts 1 -4.  Overall, there was 1 AE in the 
5 mg/mL (upper airway cough syndrome ), 15 mg/ mL (scratch), and placebo (blood pressure 
increased ) treatment groups and 7 AEs in 3 subjects in the 40 mg/mL QD treatment group (2 
events of dysgeusia in 2 subjects; 2 events of conjunctival hyperemia in 2 subjects; 2 events of 
headache in 1 subject and 1 event of upper airway cough syndrome in 1 subject ). All AEs were 
mild and all resolved by the end of the study. There were no significant changes in vital signs, body system assessment, clinical labs or visual acuity. In the formal assessments of hyperemia score, minimal  to mild conjunctival hyperemia was observed in subjects receiving A KB-9778. 
The hyperemia was transient and uniformly resolved to minimal or none by 4-8 hrs post-dose. 
Based on favorable tolerability and pharmacodynamic findings in these ocular normotensive 
subjects, a fifth cohort of subjects with OHT/POAG on standard of care prostaglandin therapy was added to assess the safety, tolerability and pilot efficacy of once- daily AKB-9778 
(40 mg/mL) as an adjunctive therapy. Briefly, 43 subjects were recruited with OHT/POAG and baseline IOP measurements ≥ 17 and ≤ 27 mmHg while  treated with once-daily prostaglandin 
therapy. Subjects were randomized 3:1 to receive either AKB -9778 (32 subjects) or placebo (11

therapy. Conjunctival hyper emia and IOP were assessed in the same manner as described for 
Cohorts 1-4 (see above).  Subjects in Cohort 5 randomized to the active treatment group  
exhibited statistically significant decreases in IOP at all post -AKB-9778 administration time 
points on both Days 1 and 7 compared with Day - 1 baseline values when they were being treated 
with prostaglandin alone (see Figure 1; Diurnal = mean IOP of 2, 4 an d 8 hour time points; ** p 
< 0.05, *** p < 0.001).  On Day 7, the diurnal mean reduction was -1.58 mmHg (p < 0.001) compared to 0.06 mmHg for placebo (p = 0.462).

with diurnal mean change from baseline on Days 1 and 7 (right panel). Legend : green circle, Day -1; 
blue square, Day 1; red triangle, Day 7.  
Topical ocular administration of AKB -9778 was well tolerated over seven days of dosing in 
Cohort 5. In the active treatment group  treated with AKB -9778 plus prostaglandin, 21.9% of 
subjects experienced hyperemia compared with 9.1% of subjects in the prostaglandin  
monotherapy treatment group . In all cases, this hyperemia was minimal -to-mild in severity, 
transient in duration and generally considered non- adverse. There were no other ocular AEs and 
no systemic AEs reported during the seven days of dosing in Cohort 5. 
4.4 Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects  
4.4.1 Potential Benefits and Risks of AKB -9778 
Please see the AKB -9778 Investigator Brochure for additional discussion and information for 
the following section.  
Potential benefits: In this study, subjects are unlikely to benefit from the short- term 
administration of the AKB -9778 Ophthalmic Solution.  However, the results of this study may 
lead to continued development of AKB-9778 Ophthalmic Solution as a novel CO -targeted 
treatment for OAG/OHT.  
Potential risks:  No serious risks have been identified in nonclinical toxicology studies of 
AKB-9778 Ophthalmic Solution of up to 28 days duration or in extensive nonclinical toxicology and clinical studies of AKB- 9778 Subcutaneous Injection.  Mean IOP

Page 26 of 89  Potential risks based on the nonclinical topical ocular dosing of AKB- 9778 include conjunctival 
hyperemia and local ocular irritation. Potential risks identified in AKB -9778 Subcutaneous 
Injection nonclinical studies  include hemodynamic findings (blood pressure reduction), liver 
findings and dermal vascular findings. To date, similar findings relating to the liver and dermal 
vasculature have not been observed in clinical trials.  
Based upon the observed clinical safet y data from the subcutaneous program, the following risks 
have been identified: hemodynamic effects (transient reductions in blood pressure and 
compensatory increases in heart rate), adverse events related to local tolerability, and allergic reaction.  
The identified non- ocular risks are mitigated by the expected much lower systemic exposure 
following administration of AKB -9778 Ophthalmic Solution compared to AKB -9778 
Subcutaneous Injection and are not expected to represent significant risks for the topical  ocular 
formulation.  
To date, topical ocular dosing of AKB-9778 for up to 7 days has been very well tolerated. Mild 
transient hyperemia was observed, increasing in incidence with increasing dose of AKB-9778 and mild transient dysgeusia has been observed in some subjects at the highest dose tested (40 mg/mL ). There were no clinically significant changes in  vital signs including blood pressure 
and heart rate consistent with much lower systemic exposure of AKB-9778 Ophthalmic Solution compared to AKB- 9778 Subc utaneous Injection. 
There is no known antidote for AKB-9778. In cases of suspected overdose, subjects should be treated per standard medical practice based on the Investigator’s judgment. Dose delays may be implemented as necessary. Subjects will be withdr awn from the study if persistent or 
unacceptable treatment -related toxicity is observed .

6.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
6.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a phase 2, double masked, randomized, multi- center, parallel -group, 28-day study to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability and ocular hypotensive efficacy of AKB-9778 Ophthalmic 
Solution 4.0% administered once (AM) or twice (AM & PM) daily when used as an adjunctive therapy to latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% once daily (PM) in subjects with elevated IOP 
due to OAG or OHT.  
Subjects will participate in the study for up to approximately 11 weeks (Screening Visit, 
Washout period for 4-6 weeks, 2 Qualification Visits (2 -7 days apart) and Treatment period for 
28 days).   
The study will be conducted at approximately 25 sites in the USA . 
Approximately 195 subjects will be randomized in this study and will be assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio 
to one of the following treatment groups : 
AKB- 9778 Q D + Latanoprost 
• AKB-9778 ophthalmic solution 4.0% QD (AM) and placebo for AKB-9778 
ophthalmic solution QD (PM) plus latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% QD 
(PM) for 28 days  
AKB-9778 BID + Latanoprost  
• AKB-9778 ophthalmic solution 4.0%  BID (AM & PM) plus latanoprost 
ophthalmic solution 0.005% QD (PM) for 28 days 
 
Latanoprost Monotherapy 
• Placebo for AKB- 9778 ophthalmic solution BID (AM & PM) plus latanoprost 
ophthalmic solution 0.005% QD (PM)  for 28 days 
During the treatment period, s ubjects will self -administer study medication  (AKB-9778 
ophthalmic solution 4.0% or Placebo  for AKB-9778) daily in the AM and PM and will also 
administer latanoprost daily in the PM.  Subjects will dose in to each eye by the topical ocular 
route using dropper bottles to deliver eye drops. Daily AM dose administration of study 
medication should occur between 7:00 and 10:00 hours and PM dose administration should 
occur between 19:00 and 22:00 hours. Latanoprost PM  dose administration will occur  at least 5 
minutes before administration of the PM  dose of study medication. Subjects will begin dosing

administration of the  AM dose of study medication on Day 28; there is no PM dose 
administration  on Day 28.  At study visits conducted on Days 14 and 28, subjects will administer 
the AM dose of medication at the site after the 8:00 ophthalmic assessments have been completed.  The Investiga tor, all study -site personnel,  all Sponsor personnel (except for select 
personnel responsible for randomization scheme development  and not involved with core study 
conduct), and subjects will be masked to treatment assignment during the entirety of the stu dy.  
Subjects who agree to participate in this study and are randomized in the study will attend a total of 6 study visits: a Screening Visit, Qualification Visit #1, Qualification Visit #2/Day  -1 
(Baseline), and visits on  Days 7, 14 and 28. Eligible subj ects must be on a stable dose of topical 
prostaglandin eye drops (eg, bimatoprost [ Lumigan® ], latanoprost [ Xalatan® ], tafluprost 
[Zioptan®] and travoprost [ Travatan Z® ]) for at least 2 weeks prior to screening. After 
completion of the Screening Visit, subjects will undergo a minimum 4 -week washout period 
from IOP lowering treatment prior to attending Qualification Visit #1 . Among multiple 
procedures, subjects will receive an eye examination including IOP measurements at Qualification Visits #1 and #2/Day  -1 and, if deemed eligible, will be enrolled at Qualification 
Visit #2 /Day  -1 and assigned treatment group  according to a computer -generated randomization 
list. Randomization will take place using IWRS methodology and will stratify subjects by mean diurnal IOP  (IOP averaged over 08:00, 10:00, 12:00, and 16:00 hour time points ) on 
Qualification Vist#2/Day  -1 (< 2 6 mmHg vs ≥ 26 mmHg) in the study eye. 
 
During the treatment period, subjects will be seen in the clinic on Days 7, 14 and 28; ocular safety assessments will be conducted on all days and efficacy measurements (IOP) will be conducted on Days 14 and 28 at the following time points: 08:00, 10:00, 12:00 and 16:00 hours. Following completion of the Day 28 study visit procedures, subjects will exit from the study. For subjects who discontinue early, every possible effort will be made to assure there is an exit visit that includes all required examinations listed for the Day 28 visit. Following completion of the study, subjects will return to the care of their ophthalmologist.  
At each study visit  during the treatment period, multiple ocular safety assessments will be 
conducted including some or all of the following: adverse events, visual acuity, hyperemia 
assessment, objective findings of biomicroscopic examinations (i.e., lids, conjunctiva, cornea, 
anterior chamber, iris and lens ), cup-disc ratio measurements, and dilated ophthalmoscopic 
examination.  
An interim analysis for futility is planned to be performed when 50% of randomized subjects 
have completed 28 days of therapy. 
6.2 Rationale for Study Design  
This Phase 2 study is being conducted to assess the safety and ocular hypotensive efficacy of 
adding A KB-9778 QD or BID to latanoprost QD therapy for 28 days. In order to best evaluate 
the contributions of AKB-9778 to the ocular hypotensive efficacy of latanoprost, a parallel group, double- masked, three- arm study design was selected.  The information to be  gained from 
this study is considered critical in the development of AKB-9778 as an IOP lowering  medication . 
Results from this study will assist in design of subsequent clinical studies.

Page 30 of 89  6.3 Rationale for AKB- 9778 Dose Selection and Frequency  
The AKB-9778 dose selected for this study is based on the recently completed Phase 1b study, 
AKB-9778- CI-OS-1001. The treatment period and dosing frequency is selected on the basis of 
nonclinical safety studies with AKB-9778 and regulatory requirements for demonstration of ocular hypotensive efficacy. 
In pre-clinical studies, a dose of 30 µL of a 40 mg/mL AKB-9778 f ormulation in 15% HPβCD in 
both eyes for 7 days demonstrated a consistent diurnal reduction in IOP in a normotensive rabbit 
model without exhibiting any systemic or significant local ophthalmic tolerability issues.  In addition, no systemic or serious loca l ocular findings were observed in 28- day GLP repeat -dose 
toxicity studies in rabbit and dog following bilateral topical ocular administration of 30 μL of 40 mg/mL AKB -9778 in 15% HPβCD + 1% mannitol solution QD, BID, or QID for 28 
consecutive days. Prelim inary data in dog following a 35 μL topical ocular dose of a 40 mg/mL 
AKB- 9778 formulation in 15% HPβCD in both eyes of normotensive dogs for 5 days also 
suggest diurnal reduction in IOP with only mild hyperemia. Further, administration of AKB-9778 immedia tely following topical ocular administration of latanoprost in dog appears to 
augment the IOP -lowering effect of latanoprost with a slight increase in the hyperemia observed 
with latanoprost alone and no other observed ocular changes. The 40 mg/mL AKB-9778 formulation used in the rabbit and dog studies represents the highest formulation strength of AKB- 9778 Ophthalmic Solution to be used in the clinical trial  and was assessed for safety in the 
28-day toxicology studies at a high-dose QID dosing regimen, twice the highest daily dosing regimen (BID) to be used in clinical study. The dosing regimen in the clinical trial will be QD or BID at 4.0% w/v AKB–9778. The maximum total daily dose used in the repeat-dose toxicity study in rabbits and dogs (9.6 mg/day) is  2-fold the proposed highest dose in the clinical trial. 
The measured exposures in rabbit and dog at a total daily dose of 9.6 mg/day are estimated to be, respectively, at least 20 - and 50-fold the measured human exposure (<1 ng/mL) following topical 
ocula r administration of 4.8 mg/day (40 mg/mL AKB -9778 BID) in the Phase 1 study. The dose 
levels for the proposed study are selected to allow evaluation of tolerability and efficacy of AKB-9778 Ophthalmic Solution and are not expected to result in systemic adverse effects.   
In the Phase 1b clinical trial, AKB -9778 Ophthalmic Solution (40 mg/mL) both QD and BID 
dosing were well tolerated in ocular normotensive volunteers with a dose dependent increase in IOP reduction.  In OHT/OAG patients on standard of care prostaglandin therapy, QD dosing was well tolerated and resulted in significant IOP reduction.  Thus, based on the available preclinical and clinical data, both QD and BID dosing of AKB-9778 Ophthalmic Solution (40 mg/mL  
[4.0%]) will be studied.

Aerpio  — Company Confidential 
Page 38 of 89  8.4 Masking  
This study will be conducted in a double-masked manner.   
Study medication will be shipped as masked supplies.   Commercially available latanoprost will be provided in an unmasked manner to sites.  
Treatment group assignment will be done through a central randomization system and completed 
using an IWRS.   
Treatment assignments will be masked to the Investigator, the clinical study team (Sponsor, 
personnel involved in day to day study management, Data Managers, and Statisticians), and the 
subjects prior to all subjects completing treatment. Treatment assignment(s) will be unmasked and made available t o the Investigator and the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor only in case of 
medical emergency or occurrence of adverse events that in the opinion of the Investigator warrant unmasking. In the absence of medical need, the randomization code/treatment assignment(s)  will not be available to the above study personnel until after the study is 
completed and the database is locked.  
8.5 Unmasking  
Unmasking of the Investigator is restricted to emergency situations and should only be used under circumstances where knowledge of the treatment is necessary for the proper management of the subject.  When possible, the Investigator should first discuss the unmasking request with the Sponsor and or Medical Monitor prior to unmasking.  If treatment is unmasked, the subjects should be discontinued from the study, and the appropriate early termination visit procedures conducted per protocol requirements.  
8.6 Study Medication and Latanoprost Administration  
Subjects will be responsible for self -administering study medication and latanoprost. F or subjects 
deemed unable to self- administer, a caregiver can administer the study medication and 
latanoprost provided the caregiver has received documented training from the investigative site. 
On the Qualification Visit #2/Day  -1 visit, subjects will be trained on study medication kits and 
instructions for dosing and diary completion for study medication and latanoprost. If necessary, subjects can undergo additional eye drop training during their Day -1 visit.  
During the treatment period, subjects will administer the study medication daily in the AM and 
PM to both eyes  and will also administer latanoprost daily in the PM  to both eyes . Daily AM 
dose administration of study medication  should occur between 7:00 and 10:00 hours and PM dose administration of study medication should occur between 19:00 and 22:00 hours. Latanoprost PM dose administration will occur at least 5 minutes before administration of the PM dose of study medication. Subjects will begin dosing with the AM dose of study medication on the morning of Day 1 and conclude dosing after administration of the AM dose of study medication on Day 28; there is no PM dose administration on Day 28.  At visits conducted on Days 14 and 28, subjects should not dose  the AM dose of study medication at home an d will

Page 39 of 89  administer the AM dose of study medication at the site after the 8:00 hour assessments have been 
completed.  
At completion of the study on Day 28, the subject will return to OAG/OHT treatment per the 
care of their ophthalmologist.   
Subjects will dos e study medication and latanoprost by instilling one drop of medication into 
each eye. Subjects will maintain a dosing diary noting date and time of study mediation and 
latanoprost dosing. If a subject forgets to administer a dose, that dose should be skipped, and 
noted along with the reason why in the dosing diary.  If an administered dose misses the eye, that 
dose should not be repeated and the diary properly noted to indicate the surface of the eye was  
missed.    
Contact lens wear during the study is acceptable. However, subjects must remove their contact lenses at least 15 minutes before instillation of masked study medication or latan oprost, and not 
place contact lenses in their eye(s) until a minimum of 15 minut es after instillation.   On days of 
study visits, subjects should not wear contacts until the study visit is completed.  
8.7 Concomitant Medication  
Intermittent use of over -the-counter (OTC) artificial tear lubricant products is acceptable  
(including preservati ve and preservative- free) , with a minimum of 10 minutes between use of 
OTC products and study medication and latanoprost.  All subjects will self-dose concomitant latanoprost QD (PM)  provided by the Sponsor during the 
treatment period. The latan oprost evening dose will be administered at least 5 minutes before the 
evening dose of study medication.  With the exception of latanoprost dosing which begins on Day 1, concurrent therapy with any 
form of ocular hypotensive medications (prescription or OTC ) is not a llowed during the study.  
Disallowed concomitant ocular medications for randomized subjects include: 
• Miotics  
• Epinephrine- related  compounds 
• Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (ocular or systemic)  
• β-adrenoceptor agonists 
• β-adrenoceptor antagonists

Page 40 of 89  • Prostaglandin analogues other than that which may be contained in the provided 
investigational product 
• Any corticosteroid -containing systemic drug regardless of route of administration  
Systemic therapy with agents that could have an effect on IOP is to be consistent in dose, regimen and agent within the 30 days prior to screening and throughout the study. For example, a subject can be treated with a systemic β -adrenoceptor antagonist as long as the particular agent 
and its dose and regimen had been consistent for the 30 days prior to screening, and there is no reason to believe that alteration would be necessary at some point later during the study. PRN use of systemic or inhaled corticosteroid-containing therapies is not allowed. Subjects should be cautioned to avoid use of alcohol during the study visit days and use of drugs such as marijuana. 
Use of all medications should be documented on the appropriate Electronic Case R eport Form 
(eCRF ). Investigators are encouraged to contact the Sponsor for any questions regarding allowed 
medications.  
Judgment of continued study participation by any randomized subject, and inclusion of this 
subject’s subsequent visits in the safety and  efficacy analysis, will be made by the Sponsor.  
All medications which the subject has taken within 30 days prior to screening and during the study will be recorded in the eCRF. The name of the drug, dose, route of administration, duration of treatment, an d indication will be recorded for each medication. For combination products 
(e.g., Contac
®), the brand name is required. For non-combination products, the generic name is 
desired. Any change in dosing parameters should also be recorded in the eCRF. 
The use of routine ophthalmic diagnostic pharmaceutical agents ( e.g., fluorescein and local 
anesthetic) will be allowed and individual documentation is not required.  
8.8 Restrictions  
8.8.1 Prior Therapy and Washout 
Prior use of AKB -9778 or study participation in a prior Aerpio Pharmaceuticals Inc., study 
which studied the AKB-9778 investigational product is exclusionary. Eligible subjects must be on a stable dose of topical prostaglandin eye drops (for at least 2 weeks 
prior to Screening).  After completion of the Screening  Visit, subjects must undergo a minimum 
4-week washout period from IOP lowering treatment prior to attending Qualification Visit #1.   If 
washout is to be extended beyond 6 weeks (42 days) for logistical or other reasons, the Sponsor should be contacted. 
 
8.8.2 Fluid and Food Intake 
There are no general restrictions on fluid or food intake for subjects participating in this study.

On study visit days during which diurnal IOP measurements are made, subjects may not engage 
in strenuous activity. Otherwise, there are no restrictions on subject activities during their 
participation in this study.  
8.9 Treatment  Compliance  
Subjects will be instructed on the importance of following their daily dosing regimen. Dosing of 
AM study medication should occur in the morning between 7:00 and 10:00 hours.  Dosing of 
latanoprost and PM study medication should occur in the evening between 19:00 and 22:00 hours with the latan oprost dose administered at least 5 minutes prior to the  dose of PM study 
medication.  
Intermittent interruption of dosing is discouraged, whether initiated by the Investigator or the subject. Subjects should contact the Investigator before interrupting treatment, and Investigators should contact the Sponsor. 
Subjects will complete  a provided dosing diary  worksheet to record dosing of study medication 
and latanoprost.  Dosing diaries will be reviewed at each visit.  
8.10 Product Accountability and Destruction   
Product accountability should be an ongoing process throughout the study.  All bulk study 
medication and latanoprost must be accounted for and any discrepancies explained.   
Proper drug accountability includes, but is not limited to: 
• Continuously monitoring expiration dates if expiry date or retest date is provided to the 
Investigator.  
• Frequently verifying that actual inventory matches documented inventory. 
• Verifying that the master drug log is completed for all study medication  and latanoprost 
received at the site and that all required fields are complete, accur ate, and legible.  
• Review of temperature log, and that the study medication and latanoprost is stored in 
locked access controlled conditions. 
• Verifying the subject individual drug accountability log is completed for each subject and 
that all required fields  (units dispensed, returned, used, compliance) etc., are complete 
accurate and legible.  
• Verifying at each study visit, the subject has completed the dosing diary, and any doses missed or not administered are properly documented and explained if necessary.  Compliance to the dosing regimen should be verified and documented by the site at each visit by review of the diary and returned study medication kits.

Page 42 of 89  If any dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered, the Sponsor must be notified 
immediately.  
Prior to site close- out, a representative from the Sponsor will perform clinical study material 
accountability and reconciliation. 
At the end of the study, the Investigator will retain all the original documentation regarding 
clinical study material accountab ility, return, and/or destruction, and copies will be sent to the 
Sponsor. 
The Investigator or designated study personnel is responsible for keeping accurate records of the 
study medication and latanoprost received from the Sponsor or its designee, all supplies retained in inventory at the site, and study medication and latanoprost dispensed to and returned from each subject.  This record will be maintained on a Drug Accountability Log that accurately reflects the accountability of the study medication and latanoprost at all times.  
During the study, the Investigator will be notified of any expiry dates or retest date extensions of study medication  or latan oprost.  If an expiry date notification is received during the study, the 
site must complete all instructions outlined in the notification, including segregation of expired 
study material for return to the Sponsor or its designee for destruction. 
At the end of the study, any unused study medication or latanoprost must be returned to the 
Sponsor or its designee for destruction.  If an investigative site has SOPs for destruction of clinical trial material on site, the Sponsor may authorize destruction of at the investigative site following completion of accountability procedures.  
9.0 STUDY PROCEDURES   
Pleas e see Appendix 1 for a detailed table of the Schedule of Activities.  
9.1 Administrative Procedures 
9.1.1 Informed  Consent  
Informed consent must be obtained prior to the subject entering into the study and before any protocol- directed procedures are performed (see Section 16.3 ).  
9.1.2 Documentation of Screen Failures  
The Investigator or designee must account for all subjects who sign informed consent and will maintain a log of subjects screened and indicate who was randomized or screen failed .  If the

Page 43 of 89  9.1.3 Contraception and Pregnancy Avoidance Measures 
Due to the unknown effects of AKB-9778 Ophthalmic Solution on sperm and the developing 
fetus, all subjects must agree to use adequate contraception throughout the study and for 3 months after administration of last dose of study medication . 
Adequate contraception is defined as follows:  
Male subjects must agree to use a reliable method of birth control and to not donate sperm during the study and for 3 months following the last dose of study medication.   
• Examples of reliable methods of birth control are condoms with spermicide; effective , 
highly effective, or surgical contraceptive method by the female partner; and male sterilization such as bilateral orchiectomy or vasectomy.  
Male subjects exclusively with women of non-childbearing potential partners are not required to use contraception. 
Female subjects of child -bearing potential must agree to use 1 highly effective method (less than 
1% failure rate) of contraception, or a combination of 2 effective methods of contraception for 
the entirety of the study and for 3 months following the last dose of study medication. 
• Highly effective methods of contraception: Combination oral contraceptives, implanted/injectable contraceptives, intrauterine device, bilateral tubal ligation, or permanent tubal occlusion. 
• Effective methods of contraception: Ma le or female condoms with spermicide, 
diaphragms with spermicide, or cervical sponges.  The subject may choose to use a double-barrier method of contraception.  Barrier protection methods without concomitant use of a spermicide are not a reliable or accept able method.  Thus, each barrier method 
must include use of a spermicide.  It should be noted that the use of male and female condoms as a double- barrier method is not considered acceptable due to the high failure 
rate when these methods are combined.   
Female subjects not of child -bearing potential may participate and include those who are:  
• Infertile due to a congenital anomaly such as mullerianagenesis.  
• Surgical sterility such as hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy.  
• Post-menop ausal: defined as a woman at least 50 years of age with an intact uterus, not 
on hormone therapy, who has had cessation of menses for at least 1 year.

Please see the Schedule of Activities presented in  Appendix 1 for designated time points for 
assessments.  
9.2.1 Clinical Evaluations  
The following section details clinical evaluations which will be conducted during the course of 
the study.   
• Medical history and demographics:  Medical history and demographic information will 
be collected at the Screening visit .  Interim medical history will also be collected at 
Qualifying Vis its #1 and #2.  Relevant medical history (with particular emphasis on 
previous medical conditions that may lead to exclusion) and significant ongoing medical conditions or diseases should be documented.  
• Adverse Event Assessments:  From the time of informed consent through study 
completion Day 28, the Investigator and study personnel will review all  ophthalmic and 
clinical finding s and query the subject directly regarding AEs.  Subjects must be followed 
for AEs until the final required protocol visit or until all drug -related toxicities and 
serious adverse events have resolved (or are considered chronic/stable), whichever is later.  
• Concomitant Medication Recording:  All medications, both prescription and non-
prescription, and including vitamins, herbals, topicals, inhaled, and intranasal, taken within 30 days prior to screening  and though Day 28, should be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF.  All medications and treatments, including vitamin supplements, OTC 
medications, and oral herbal preparations must be recorded in the eCRFs.  
9.2.2 Ophthalmic Assessments (listed in order of assessment)  
Further information on the conduct of the following procedures can be found in the study specific operations manual.  Assessments are listed in suggested order of conduct  when 
conducted on same visit.  
• Visual Acuity : VA and pinhole visual acuity will be performed 
as a measure of ocular 
function and will be measured at Screening and frequently throughout the study.  
• Visual Field Testing: Visual field testing must be performed within 3 months prior to 
randomization. Visual fields must be determined as automated threshold perimetry ( e.g., 
30-2 or 24-2 Humphrey). Swedish interactive threshold algorithm  (SITA ) Standard is 
preferred, SITA fast also is allowed. Visual fields must be reliable, defined as those with a) fixation losses ≤  33%, b) false positives ≤ 33%, and c) false negatives ≤ 33%.

Page 45 of 89  • Biomicroscopy: A slit lamp biomicroscopy examination of the lids, conjunctiva, cornea, 
anterior chamber, iris and lens of both eyes will be conducted at Screening and selected 
subsequent visits . 
• Bulbar Conjunctival Hyperemia Assessment & Grading :  Bulbar conjunctival hyperemia 
will be assessed for both eyes at Screening, Qualification Visit s #1 and #2, and frequently 
throughout the study.  All hyperemia assessments coincide with a timed IOP evaluation.  The hyperemia assessment and grading must be evaluated prior to the use of any ocular drops required for the IOP procedure.  The Investigator will evaluate (grade) conjunctival hyperemia using the scale presented below.  Note: An increase of 2 or more  grade s on the 
hyperemia scale when compared to the lowest  score recorded at any previous timepoint 
for an individual eye should be reported as an adverse event. If a subject complains of hyperemia, an AE will be recorded regardless of grade on the hyperemia scale.  
 
 
 
 
• Intraocular Pressure (IOP): IOP will be assessed by calibra ted Goldmann applanation 
tonometry . IOP  assessments are conducted as follows: measure twice, with 3rd measure 
if discordant  (i.e. previous two readings >2mmHg different). The IOP used at each time 
point is the mean of 2 measurements or the median of 3 meas urements. IOP will be 
measured at Screening, Qualification Vis it #1 and #2 and frequently throughout the 
study. Note: For purposes of determining eligibility , any non- integer (non -whole 
number) mean IOP should not be rounded (e.g. if the mean of 2 IOP reading s is 23.5 
do not round up to 24) . 
• Pachymetry : Pachymetry  (contact or non- contact method)  will be performed at Screening  
and Day 28 and will be used to measure the thickness of the central cornea.  
• Gonioscopy:  Gonioscopy will conducted at S creening to confirm the iridocorneal angle is 
open and to what extent. Eligible subjects must have an angle of 3 or 4 (Shaffer grading scale; 
Kolker 1976)  for participation in the study.  
• Dilated Ophthalmoscopy : A dilated funduscopic examination including evaluation of the 
retina, vitreous, macula, choroid, optic nerve, and cup/disc ratio will be performed at Screening and Day 28. Evaluation of cup-disc ratio will be performed when ophthalmoscopy is performed.

Pregnancy test :  A urine pregnancy test will be performed at Screening, Qualification 
Visit #2/Day  -1 and Day 28 for females of childbearing potential.   
The Sponsor will provide urine pregnancy tests to the sites. Expiration dates on the pregnancy 
tests will be reviewed and confirmed by the site prior to use.  
If a female becomes pregnant during the study  or within  3 months after administration of last 
dose of study medication, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor immediately after the pregnancy is confirmed ( Section 11.4 ) and the subject will  stop taking study medication and 
every possible effort will be made to assure there is an exit visit that includes all required examinations listed for the Day 28 visit. The Investigator should follow the progress of the pregnancy until the fetus is carried to term.  
 
10.0 SCHEDULE OF ACTIVITIES  
The Schedule of Activities is presented in  Appendix 1 and shows the timing of planned study 
procedures to occur at the study site.  Every effort should be made to adhere to the procedure schedule and all assessments should be completed at each study visit.  
Subjects will be responsible for self -administration of study medication and latan oprost .  As 
detailed in Section 8.6, subjects will self -dose study medication BID on a morning and evening 
schedule and latan oprost QD on an evening schedule.  Subjects will begin dosing with the AM 
dose of study medication on the morning of Day 1 and conclude dosing after administration of the AM dose of study medication on Day 28; there is no PM dose administration on Day 28.  
Subjects discontinuing study medication sooner than the planned 28 day dosing period or 
withdrawing from the study should complete the Day 28 assessments and return all unused study 
medication .  
Detailed descriptions of procedures and activities to be foll owed during each site visit are

This is the fifth  of five qualifying IOPs for randomization.  
Individuals who do NOT meet this requirement in both eyes may return for up to 2 additional unscheduled qualification visits within 1 week of failing the first qualification visit.  
Individuals returning at an unscheduled visit within 1 week are required to only re- measure IOP 
in both eyes. Upon return, such individuals would need to qualify at 08:00, 10:00 and 16:00 hours. Individuals who fail due to IOP being ≥ 36 mmHg in either eye  (exclusi on criterion) at 
any of these time points at this study visit or at an unscheduled visit within 1 week of the original visit MAY NOT return for additional qualification visits.  
If both eyes qualify, the study eye will be the eye with the higher mean diurnal IOP on Visit 3  
(Qualification Visit #2/Day  -1). If both eyes have the same mean diurnal IOP on Visit 3, then the 
right eye will be the study eye. In each subject, BOTH eyes will be treated.  
At this point, eligible subjects will be enrolled and assigned to an investigational product through an IWRS system. Study medication kits numbers will be assigned through the IWRS system and study medication and latanoprost will be dispensed to subjects.

10.3 Unscheduled Visits  
An unscheduled visit may be any visit to the Investigator other than the specific visits requested 
in the protocol as possibly required for the subject’s ophthalmic condition. The Investigator will perform all procedures necessary to evaluate the study participant at these visits and record any adverse events in the CRF.  
Every  possible effort should be made by Investigators to assure that non- completing subjects 
have a final visit that includes all examinations listed for Visit 6.0 (Day 28 ) plus a dilated 
ophthalmoscopy examination. 
10.4 Early Termination Visits  
Should a subject withdraw after administration of AKB -9778, or should the Inve stigator decide 
to withdraw the subject, all efforts will be made to complete and report the protocol-stipulated 
observations up to the time of withdrawal as thoroughly as possible.   
Subjects who discontinue prior to completion of all planned study assessments, should undergo 
the Day 28 assessments at time of discontinuation . 
 
11.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
11.1 Definitions  
11.1.1 Adverse Events (AEs)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or trial subject administered a drug or 
biologic (medicinal product) or using a medical device; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with that treatment or usage.  
AEs include the following: 
• All suspected adverse medication reactions.  
• All reactions from medication overdose, abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity, o r toxicity.  
• Apparently unrelated illnesses, including the worsening of a preexisting illness (see paragraph below on Preexisting Conditions). 
• Injury or accidents.  Note that if a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or accident ( e.g., a fa ll secondary to dizziness), the medical condition (dizziness) and the 
accident (fall) should be reported as two separate adverse events.  The outcome of the accident ( e.g., hip fracture secondary to the fall) should be recorded under Comments. 
Protocol No. AKB -9778 -CI-OS-2001 
Amendment # 2 Integrated   May 17 , 2020 
  
 
Aerpio  — Company Confidential 
Page 59 of 89  • Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination findings that require 
clinical intervention or further investigation (beyond ordering a repeat [confirmatory] test).  
• An increase of 2 or more grades on the hyperemia scale when compared to the lowest score recorded at any previous timepoint for an individual eye should be reported as an adverse event. If a subject complains of hyperemia, an AE will be recorded regardless of grade on the hyperemia scale ( Section 9.2.2).  
Procedures – Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be reported as adverse events.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported as the adverse event and the resulting appendectomy noted under Comments . 
Preexisting Conditions  – In this trial, a preexisting condition ( i.e., a disorder present before the 
adverse event reporting period started and noted on the pretreatment medical history/physical examination form) should not be reported as an adverse event unless the condition worsens, or episodes increase in frequency during the adverse event reporting period. 
11.1.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
Each adverse event is to be classified by the Investigator as SERIOUS or NONSERIOUS.  An 
adverse event that meets one or more of the following criteria/outcomes is classified as serious:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening (see paragraph below on Life -threatening) 
• In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (see paragraph below 
on Hospitalization) 
• Persisten t or significant disability/incapacity (see paragraph below on Disability)  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important adverse events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered Serious Adverse Events ( SAE s) when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
The term serious also includes any other event that the Investigator o r Sponsor judges to be 
serious or which is defined as serious by the regulatory agency in the country in which the event 
occurred.  If there is any doubt whether the information constitutes an AE or SAE, the 
information is to be treated as an SAE. 
Protocol No. AKB -9778 -CI-OS-2001 
Amendment # 2 Integrated   May 17 , 2020 
  
 
Aerpio  — Company Confidential 
Page 60 of 89  Life-threatening  – Any AE that places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as 
it occurred.  A life -threatening event does not include an event that might have caused death had 
it occurred in a more severe form but that did not create an immediate risk of death as it actually 
occurred.  For example, drug- induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure 
would not be considered life threatening, even though drug- induced hepatitis of a more severe 
nature can be fatal.  
Hospitalization  – Hospitalization is defined as an overnight admission with observation of a 
minimum of 24 hours.  A hospitalization planned before the start of the study for a preexisting condition that has not worsened does not constitute an SAE ( e.g., elective hospitalization for a 
total knee replacement due to a preexisting condition of osteoarthritis of the knee that has not worsened during the course of the study). 
Disability  – Defined as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions.  
11.1.3 Severity  
If required on the adverse event CRF, the Investigator will use the adjectives MILD, 
MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity of the adverse event.  For purposes of consistency, these intensity grades are defined as follows:  
MILD:  Does not interfere with subject's usual function  
MODERATE:  Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function  
SEVERE:  Interferes significantly with subject's usual function  
Note the distinction between the gravity and the intensity of an adverse event.  Severe is a 
measure of intensity; thus, a severe reaction is not necessarily a serious reaction.  For example, a 
headache may be severe in intensity, but would not be classifi ed as serious unless it met one of 
the criteria for serious events listed above.  
11.2 Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
The Investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by the study subject.  In addition, each study subject will be questioned about AEs at each visit following the initiation of treatment.  
11.3 Reporting  
Each AE is to be classified by the Investigator as SERIOUS or NONSERIOUS.  This classification of the gravity of the event determines the reporting procedures to be followed.  If an SAE occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.

Aerpio  — Company Confidential 
Page 61 of 89  All AEs that occur in study subjects during the adverse event reporting period specified in the 
protocol must be reported, WHETHER OR NOT THE EVENT IS CONSIDERED 
MEDICATION RELATED.  
11.3.1 Reporting Period 
The AE reporting period for this study begins from the time of informed consent and ends at the final protocol required visit.  
IN ADDITION, any known untoward event that occurs subsequent to the AE reporting period that the Investigator assesses as possibly or probably related to the study medication and meets 
criteria for serious should also be reported as an SAE. 
11.3.2 Reporting AEs  
NONSERIOUS AEs are to be reported on the adverse event case repor t forms.  
11.3.3 Reporting SAEs  
Serious adverse events should be reported on both the clinical trial adverse event CRF and the Serious Adverse Event Report Form.  
Note:  Where the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE term should be used on both forms. 
Any SAE, regardless of causal relationship, must be reported to the clinical safety contact at the  
Sponsor within 24 hours after the Investigator becomes aware of the SAE by completing and 
sending an SAE report form.  Compliance with this time requirement is essential so that the Sponsor may comply with its regulatory obligations. 
The initial SAE report should be completed as fully as possible but should contain, at a 
minimum:  
• A short description of the event and the reason why the event is categorized as serious 
• Subject identification number  
• Investigator’s name  
• Name of the suspected medicinal product (not applicable for double- masked studies)  
• Causality assessment  
• Onset date  
Follow- Up information relating to an SAE must be reported to the clinical safety contact at the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of receipt by the Investigator by sending a completed SAE report form

Page 62 of 89  with new information.  The subject should be observed and monitored carefully until the 
condition resolves or stabilizes. 
Any emergency event deemed related  to study medication must be reported to the trial monitor 
or to the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor immediately.  
All deaths are to be thoroughly investigated and reported as SAEs .  Autopsy reports are to be 
obtained, if possible.  
The Sponsor and/or its designee are responsible for reporting SAEs to all applicable regulatory 
agencies and the central ethics comm ittees within the required timeline.  
The Investigator is responsible for submitting required safety information to their local IRB. This information includes but is not limited to any safety alert letter received from the Sponsor and any SAEs occurring at their site.  
11.3.4 Relationship to Study Medication  
The causal relationship of the AE to study medication  will be assessed by both the Investigator 
and the Sponsor.  The following definitions will be used in assessment. 
Probably Related :  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration.  It follows a known response pattern to the study medication .  The AE cannot be 
reasonably explained by other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs. 
Possibly Related:  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration but could have been produced by other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs. 
Unrela ted:  The AE does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
product or the AE is clearly related to other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs administered to the sub ject. 
11.3.5 Follow- Up of Unresolved Events  
All AEs should be followed until they are resolved or the PI assesses them as chronic or stable or the subject’s participation in the trial ends (i.e., until a final report is completed for that subject).  
In addition, all serious adverse events and those nonserious events assessed by the Investigator as possibly or probably related to the study medication should continue to be followed even after the subject's participation in the trial is over.  Such events s hould be followed until they resolve 
or until the Investigator assesses them as “chronic” or “stable.”  Resolution of such events is to be documented on the appropriate CRF.

Page 63 of 89  11.4 Exposure In Utero   
If any study subject becomes or is found to be pregnant while receiving a study medication or 
within 30 days of discontinuing the study medication, the Investigator submits this information on a Pregnancy Report Form which must be submitted within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy.  The information submitted should include the anticipated date of birth or pregnancy termination.  
If the pregnancy is discovered during the study treatment period, the study medication should be discontinued. 
The PI will fo llow the subject until completion of the pregnancy and will notify Aerpio 
Pharmaceuticals of the outcome within 5 days or as specified below.  If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a serious 
adverse event ( i.e., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly 
[including that in an aborted fetus]), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting a serious adverse event.  
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are cl assified as serious adverse events 
follows:  
• Note that “spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion. 
• All neonatal deaths that occur within one month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as serious adverse events.  In addition, any infant death after one month that the Investigator assesses as possibly or probably related to the in utero exposure to the study medication should also be reported. 
• In the case of a live birth, the “normality” of the newborn can be assessed at time of birth.  
• The “normality” of an aborted fetus can be assessed by gross visual inspection unless 
there are pre -abortion laboratory findings suggestive of a congenital anomaly.

• H
01: The difference between study eyes treated with AKB -9778 BID + Latanoprost and 
study eyes treated with Latanoprost monotherapy in Day 28 mean diurnal IOP (IOP 
averaged over the 08:00, 10:00, 12:00, and 16:00 hour time points) is ≥ 0 mmHg. 
• H11: The difference between study eyes treated with AKB-9778 BID + Latanoprost and 
study eyes treated with Latanoprost monotherapy in Day 28 mean  diurnal IOP  is < 0 
mmHg

Page 64 of 89  • H02: The difference between study eyes treated with AKB -9778 QD + Latanoprost and 
study eyes treated with Latanoprost monotherapy in Day 28 mean diurnal IOP is ≥ 0 
mmHg.  
• H12: The difference between study eyes treated with AKB -9778 QD + Latanoprost and 
study eyes treated with Latanoprost monotherapy in Day 28 mean  diurnal IOP is < 0 
mmHg.  
The study will be considered a success if either H01 or H 02 is rejected.  
12.2 Multiplicity Adjustment 
No multiplicity adjustment for the two sets of primary hypotheses will be made in this Phase 2 protocol, yielding an overall two-sided Type I Error of 0.10. 
12.3 Sample Size  Considerations  
Efficacy:  
Sixty -five (65) subjects per arm completing 28 days of treatment yields 80% power to conclude 
statistical superiority of AKB -9778 (QD or BID)  + Latanoprost to Latanoprost monotherapy 
assuming a two -sided alpha = 0.05, a true difference in mean diurnal change from baseline IOP 
of 1.5 mmHg, a common standard deviation of 3.5 mmHg at each time point, and a correlation of 
0.60 among time points within a subject’s study eye (leading to an SD of the mean diurnal IOP of 3.0 mmHg)  
12.4 Analysis Populations  
Randomized Population: The randomized population will include all subjects who were 
randomized to treatment. Baseline variables and demographic characteristics will be summarized 
for this population. 
Intent- to-Treat Population (ITT): The ITT population wil l include all randomized subjects who 
have received at least one dose of study medication. This population will be the primary population for efficacy analyses and will be used to summarize all efficacy variables and will summarize subjects as randomized.  
Per-protocol population (PP): The PP population is a subset of the ITT population, which will 
include those subjects (and their visits) who do not have major protocol violations likely to seriously affect the primary outcome of the study as judged by a mas ked evaluation prior to the 
unmasking of the study treatment.  This population will be the secondary population for efficacy analyses and will be used to summarize a subset of efficacy variables.  If the PP
 and ITT 
populations are exactly the same, then additional efficacy analyses on the PP population will not be performed.  The PP population will summarize subjects as treated.

at least one dose of study medicat ion. This population will be used to summarize safety variables 
and will summarize subjects as treated.  
12.5 Statistical Methods to be  Employed 
12.5.1 General Considerations  
All continuous study assessments will be summarized by treatment and time point (as applicable) 
using descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum). All 
categorical study assessments will be summarized by treatment and time point (as applicable) using frequency counts and percentages. 
Hypothesis testing, unless otherwise indicated, will be performed at a 2 -sided 0.05 significance 
level.  When applicable, two- sided 95% confidence intervals will be reported. All p -values will 
be displayed to four decimal places, with p-values less than 0.0001 presented as '< 0.0001' and p-
values greater than 0.9999 presented as ‘> 0.9999’. Differences between AKB -9778 + 
Latanoprost and Latanoprost monotherapy will be calculated as AKB -9778 + Latanoprost minus 
Latanoprost monotherapy. 
All study data will be listed by treatment, subje ct and time point (as applicable).  
For diurnally- adjusted IOP, baseline will refer to the time -relevant measure at Visit 3.0 through 
3.3 (e.g., IOP at 08:00 hours at Visit 3.0 will be the baseline for 08:00 hours at Visits 5.0 and 6.0, 
IOP at 10:00 hours at Visit 3.1 will be the baseline for 10:00 hours at Visits 5.1 and 6.1, etc.). 
For all other variables, baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to the first dose of study medication.  
The unit of analysis for efficacy will be the study eye. The study eye will be the eye with the higher mean diurnal IOP on Visit 3. If both eyes have the same mean diurnal IOP on  Visit 3, 
then the right eye will be the study eye. 
Statistical methods will be more fully described in a separate document ( i.e., the Statistical 
Analysis Plan).  
12.5.2 Interim  Analyses  
An interim analysis for futility is planned to be performed when 50% of randomized subjects 
have completed 28 days of therapy. For this analysis the diurnal mean reduction of IOP in each AKB-9778 treatment group will be compared to that of the Latanoprost monotherapy treatment 
group. Futility will be declared if the conditional probability of achieving a 1.5 mmHg reduction in IOP compared to Latanoprost monotherapy in each AKB -9778 treatment group is < 30%.  
Conditional probability of achieving a 1.5 mmHg reduction in IOP compared to Latanoprost monotherapy will be based on the observed data and projected data for the remaining subjects. Projections will be based on the initial assumptions of a true effect of AKB-9778 + Latanoprost over Latanoprost monotherapy of -1.5 mmHg with a SD of 3.0 mmHg.

Demographic and baseline characteristics such as age, gender, or disease status ( e.g., IOP, cup-
disc ratio) will be summarized and listed. Medical history, history of ocular surgery and 
procedures, OAG/OHT  history and washout period will also be summarized and listed. 
12.5.4 Subject  Disposition  
Subject enrollment, discontinuation of Investigational Product, and withdrawal from the study will be summar ized and listed.  
12.5.5 Analysis of  Efficacy  
All efficacy analyses will be conducted in  the study eye and both eyes (average of study eye and 
eligible fellow eye)  
The primary efficacy outcome will be comparison of AKB -9778 + Latanoprost (QD or BID) 
relative to La tanoprost monotherapy for:  
• Mean change from baseline in diurnal IOP on Day 28 
Secondary efficacy outcomes will include comparison of AKB-9778 + Latanoprost (QD or BID) relative to Latanoprost monotherapy for:  
• Mean change from baseline in diurnal IOP on Day 14 (study eye)  
• Mean change from baseline in diurnal IOP on Days 14 and 28 (both eyes) 
• Mean diurnal IOP on Days 14 and 28 (both eyes) 
• Mean observed IOP at each time point on Days 14 and 28 
• Mean change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP  at each time point  on Days 14 and 28 
• Mean percent change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each time point on Days 14 
and 28 
• Mean percent change from baseline in diurnal IOP on Days 14 and 28 
• Percentages of subjects achieving pre- specified mean, mean change, and percent mean 
change in diurnal IOP levels 
Additional secondary efficacy analyses may be conducted as described in the study Statistical Analysis Plan.  Note that each subject will have one eye designated as the study eye.  Only the 
study eyes will be evaluated for the primary efficacy measure or for selected secondary efficacy measures; however, both eyes will be treated. Fellow eyes will be evaluated separately for the primary analysis of the primary efficacy me asure. In addition, analyses using the average IOP

subject is ineligible, then the both eyes analysis will utilize only the Study eye for that subject  
Primary Estima nd 
The primary comparisons in this trial will be between two doses of AKB -9778 (QD and BID) + 
Latanoprost vs Latanoprost monotherapy at the Day 28 Visit in the ITT population with 
intercurrent events handled as described in the following estimand.   
• Popula tion: subjects with Open -Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension defined through 
enrolment criteria  
• Endpoint: 
- Mean d iurnal (averaged over 08:00, 10:00, 12:00, and 16:00 hour time points)  
change from baseline IOP (mm Hg) at the Day 28 Visit in the study eye 
• Intercurrent event:  
- Discontinuation of study medication  and non- optimal compliance will be ignored 
[treatment policy strategy].  
- Withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or adverse event: missing data will be imputed 
employing Multiple Imputation (MI) assuming missing not at random using: 
▪     Control- based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology 
[hypothetical strategy].  
- Missing data without withdrawal or withdrawal due to reasons other than lack of efficacy or adverse event: missing data will be i mputed employing Multiple 
Imputation (MI) assuming missing at random using randomized treatment -based 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology [hypothetical strategy]. 
• Population- level summary:  
- The difference in the mean diurnal change from baseline IOP  at the Day 28 Visit, 
between study eyes treated with each dose of AKB -9778 (QD and BID) + 
Latanoprost and study eyes treated with Latanoprost monotherapy. 
Sensitivity analyses will be performed on observed data only and where worst time consistent observa tion within a subject is carried forward for withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or adverse 
event and last time consistent observation within a subject is carried forward for other missing data.  
The primary analysis of the primary outcome will employ a linear model with  Day 28 mean 
diurnal change from baseline IOP as the response, baseline mean diurnal IOP (mean diurnal IOP 
on Day -1) as a covariate, and treatment as a main effect factor, using the intent to treat population with multiple imputation techniqu es (e.g., Monte Carlo Markov Chain) used to 
impute missing data. The least squares mean differences (test – control) between AKB -9778 + 
Latanoprost and Latanoprost monotherapy will be presented as well as 2 -sided p-values and 95% 
confidence intervals. Inference wil l be made on the p- value < 0.05.

Page 68 of 89  Analyses will be performed primarily on the  ITT population using multiple imputation 
techniques to impute missing data and secondarily using: observed data only, last observation 
carried forward (LOCF) where LOCF will be performed using time -relevant measures; and 
baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) using time- relevant measures to determine the 
robustness of results. Additionally, the above analyses will be repeated on the PP population to determine robustness of results.  Additional imputation techniques may be designated in the formal Statistical Analysis Plan . 
Secondary analyses of the primary endpoint will be completed using individual two- sample t - 
tests and 95% t -distribution confidence intervals at each time p oint (08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 at 
the Day 14, and Day 28 Visits) using the ITT population. Similar analyses will be completed on the secondary endpoints: mean IOP measure at each time point and visit and mean diurnal IOP and change from baseline diurnal IOP measures. Models adjusting for baseline will only be performed on the mean IOP response variable as inference is identical between this response and the change from baseline IOP response variable in such a model.  
Additionally, for the mean IOP values at each time point, mixed model repeated measures will be run with baseline as the covariate; treatment, visit, time point, treatment by visit, treatment by time point, visit by time point, and treatment by visit by time point as the fixed effect factors; and subject as the random effect, repeated measure. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within subject, between visit and time point variances. This allows for different variances and covariances within and between time points and visits. The treatment by visit, treatment by time point, visit by time point, and treatment by visit by time point interactions allow for a different rate of change in IOP in the different treatment arms among visits and time points. This model will be run including the Day 14, and Day 28 visits. 
Percent change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each time point will be analyzed using 
two-sample t -tests, between AKB -9778 and each comparator, at each time point and visit, 
including two- sample t -tests and 9 5% t-distribution confidence intervals on the difference (AKB-
9778 – comparator).  
Mean diurnal IOP values will be constructed by averaging the 4 diurnal IOP measurements on each of the Day 14, and Day 28 visits. Mean diurnal baseline IOP will be constructe d as the 
average of the four Day -1 IOP measurements. Mean change from mean baseline diurnal IOP 
will be created by taking the average of the four  time points on each of Day 14, and Day 28 visits 
and subtracting the single mean baseline diurnal IOP measure ment.  
Sub-group analyses based upon pre- study characteristics such as site, demographics, or pre- 
study ocular hypotensive medications may be completed to further investigate the efficacy measures.

Page 69 of 89  12.5.6 Analysis of  Safety  
12.5.6.1 Ocular and Systemic Safety  Assessments  
Slit lamp biomicroscopy , hyperemia and dilated ophthalmoscopy measures will be summarized 
at each measured time point using discrete summary statistics.  
Visual acuity data will be summarized at each time point using both continuous summaries 
(logMAR), including change from baseline, and discrete summaries, including change from baseline.  
12.5.6.2 Adverse Events 
Verbatim descriptions of treatment- emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) will be mapped to Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) thesaurus terms and be presented in a data listing.  Treatment emergent AEs, those that occur after the first dose of study medication will be summarized by treatment group using frequency and percent for each system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) within each SOC . Summaries will be presented separately for ocular and 
non-ocular TEAEs. These summaries will also be presented for relation to Investigational 
Product and by severity. Fisher’s exact test will be used to test the difference in proportions of subjects with each TEAE between treatment groups (SOC and PT).  
12.6 Procedure for Accounting for Missing, Unused, or Spurious Data  
Analyses will be performed primarily on missing data imputed using multiple imputation techniques as defined in the primary estimand. Sensitivity analyses will be performed on 
observed data only and where worst time consistent observation within a subject is carried forward for withdrawal due to  lack of efficacy or adverse event and last time consistent 
observation within a subject is carried forward for other missing data . Any missing, unused, or 
spurious data will be noted in the final statistical report.  
12.7 Procedure for Reporting Deviations from  the Statistical Plan 
Any deviations from the Statistical Analysis Plan will be described and a justification given in the final statistical report.

Page 70 of 89  13.0 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING 
13.1 Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
CRFs are required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed original 
CRFs are the sole property of the Sponsor and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of the Sponsor or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from the Sponsor.  CRFs for this study will be electronic (eCRFs).  
The PI has ultimate responsibility for the accuracy, authenticity, and timely collection and reportin g of all clinical, safety, and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data 
collection forms.  The CRFs must be signed by the Investigator (for electronic CRFs, they can be signed electronically) or by an authorized staff member to attest that th e data contained on the 
CRFs is true.  Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs and source documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry.  
In most cases, the source documents are contained in the subject’s chart at the hospital or the 
physician's office.  In these cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.  
In some cases, the CRFs, or part of the CRFs, may also serve as source documents.  In these cases, a document should be available at both the Investigator’s site and at the Sponsor or its designee that clearly identify those data that will be recorded in the CRFs, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document.  
13.2 Record Retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or the Sponsor, the Investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, e.g., CRFs and hospital records), all original signed Infor med Consent Forms, 
copies of all CRFs, SAE forms, source documents, detailed records of drug disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence ( e.g., letters, meeting minutes, telephone 
calls reports).  The records should be retained by the Investigator according to the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH), local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement, whichever time period is longer. 
If the Investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period ( e.g., retirement, relocation), the Sponsor should be prospectively notified.  The 
study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to the Sponsor, such as another Investigator, another institution, or to the Sponsor.  The Investigator must obtain Sponsor’s written permission before disposing of any records, even if retention requirements have been met.

Page 71 of 89  14.0 QUALITY CONTROL (QC) AND QUALITY ASSURANCE (QA)  
14.1 Study Site Monitoring Visits  
During study conduct, the Sponsor or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure 
that the protocol and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) are being followed.  The monitors will review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate.  The Investigator/institution will allow Sponsor monitors or designees and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.  
The study site may also be subject to Quality Assurance audits performed by the Sponsor or companies wor king with or on behalf of the Sponsor, and/or review by the independent review 
board (IRB), and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities 
It is important that the PI and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits 
and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.  
14.2 Protocol Deviations 
The PI should not deviate from the protocol, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects.  Should other unexpected circumsta nces arise that will require deviation 
from protocol-specified procedures, the Investigator should consult with the Sponsor or designee (and IRB, as required) to determine the appropriate course of action. 
The site should document all protocol deviations in the subject’s source documents.  In the event 
of a significant deviation, the site should notify the Sponsor or its designee (and IRB, as required).  Significant deviations include, but are not limited to, those that involve fraud or misconduct, increase the health risk to the subject, or confound interpretation of primary study assessments.  
15.0 TRIAL DISCONTINUATION/INVESTIGATIVE SITE TERMINATION 
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the trial prior to inclusion of the intended number of subjects but intends only to exercise this right for valid scientific or administrative reasons.  After such a decision, the Investigator must contact all participating subjects within a time period specified by the Sponsor to inform them of the decision to discontinue the trial.  
15.1 Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspension of the Study  
The following criteria may result in either temporary suspension or early termination of the study: 
• New information regarding the safety or efficacy of the study medication that indicates a 
change in the known risk/benefit profile for the compound, such that the risk/benefit is no longer acceptable for subjects participating in the study.

Amendment # 2 Integrated   May 17 , 2020 
  
 
Aerpio  — Company Confidential 
Page 72 of 89  • Significant violation of GCP that compromises the ability to achieve the prim ary study 
objectives or compromises subject safety.  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the trial for other valid administrative reasons.  
15.2 Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspension of Investigational Site  
A study site may be terminated prem aturely or suspended if the site (including the PI) is found to 
be in significant violation of GCP, protocol, contractual agreement, or is unable to ensure 
adequate performance of the study.  
15.3 Procedures for Premature Termination or Suspension of the Study or Investigational Site(s)  
In the event that the Sponsor elects to terminate or suspend the study or the participation of an Investigational site, a study-specific procedure for early termination or suspension will be provided by the Sponsor; the procedure will be followed by applicable Investigational sites during the course of termination or study suspension. 
 16.0 ETHICS  
16.1 Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki on Ethical Principles 
for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects, adopted by the General Assembly of the World Medical Association (1996). 
In addition, the study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the ICH guideline on 
GCP, and applicable local regulatory requirements and laws.  
16.2 Institutional Review Board (IRB)  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent forms, and other relevant documents, ( e.g., recruitment 
advertisements, if applicab le) from the IRB.  All correspondence with the IRB should be retained 
in the Investigator File.  Copies of IRB approvals should be forwarded to the Sponsor. 
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB approval is where 
the cha nge is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In that event, 
the Investigator must notify the IRB and the Sponsor in writing immediately after the implementation.

Aerpio  — Company Confidential 
Page 73 of 89  16.3 Subject Information and Consent  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to give each subject (or the subject’s acceptable 
representative), prior to inclusion in the trial, full and adequate verbal and written information 
regarding the objective and procedures of the trial and the possible risks involved.  The subj ects 
must be informed about their right to withdraw from the trial at any time.   
Furthermore, it is the responsibility of the Investigator, or a person designated by the 
Investigator, to obtain signed informed consent from each subject or the subject’s le gally 
acceptable representative prior to inclusion in the trial.  The Investigator will retain the original 
of each subject's signed consent form.  
The informed consent form must be in compliance with International Conference on Harmonisation  (ICH) GCP, loc al regulatory requirements, and legal requirements.  The informed 
consent form used in this study, and any changes made during the course of the study, must be prospectively approved by both the IRB and the Sponsor before use. 
16.4 Reporting of Safety Issues an d Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP  
In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed ( i.e., clinical hold) by an applicable 
Competent Authority, or if the Investigator is aware of any new information which might 
influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational product, the Sponsor should be informed immediately.  
In addition, the Investigator will inform the Sponsor immediately of any urgent safety measures 
taken by the Investigator to protect the study subjects against any immediate hazard, and of any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that comes to the attention of the Investigator.  
16.5 Subject Confidentiality  
All parties will ensure protection of subject personal data and will not include subject names on any Sponsor forms, reports, publications, or in any other disclosures, except where required by laws.  In case of data transfer, the Sponsor will maintain high standards of confidentiality and protection of subject personal data. 
The Sponsor and designees affirm and uphold the principle of the subject’s right to protection 
against invasion of privacy.  Throughout this study, a subject’s source data will only be linked to the Sponsor’s clinical study database or documentation via a unique identification number.  As permitted by all applicable laws and regulations, limited subject attributes, such as sex, age, or date of birth, and subject initials may be used to verify the subject and accuracy of the subject’s unique identification number. 
To comply with ICH Guidelines for GCP and to verify compliance with this protocol, the 
Sponsor requires the Investigator to permit its monitor or designee’s monitor, representatives 
from any regulatory authority ( e.g., Food and Drug Administration [FDA]), the Sponsor’s 
designated auditors, and the appropriate IRB to review the subject’s original medical records (source data or documents), including, but not limited to, laboratory test result reports,

occurring during a subject’s study participation, and autopsy reports.  Access to a subject’s 
original medical records requires the specific authorization of the subject as part of the informed consent process.  
Copies of any subject source documents that are provided to the Sponsor must have certain personally identifiable information removed ( i.e., subject name, address, and other identifier 
fields not collected on the subject’s CRF).  
 
17.0 PUBLICATION OF STUDY RESULTS  
No publication or disclosure of study results will be permitted, except under the terms and 
conditions of a separate, written agreement between Sponsor and the Investigator and/or the Investigator’s institution.  The Sponsor must have the opportunity to review and approve all proposed abstracts, manuscripts, or presentations regarding this study prior to submission for publication/presentation.  Any information identified by the Sponsor as confidential must be deleted prior to subm ission.  
For all publications relating to the study, the institution will comply with recognized ethical standards concerning publications and authorship, including:  Section II - “Ethical 
Considerations in the Conduct and Reporting of Research” of the Unif orm Requirements for

Page 81 of 89  FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION  
 
1 INDICATIONS AND  USAGE  
 
XALATAN is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-
angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. 
 
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
 
The recommended dosage is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening. If one 
dose is missed , treatment should continue with the next dose as normal. 
 The dosage of XALATAN should not exceed once daily; the combined use of two or more prostaglandins, or prostaglandin analogs including XALATAN is not recommended. It has been shown that administration of these prostaglandin drug products more than once daily may decrease the intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effect or cause paradoxical elevations in IOP.  
 
Reduction of the IOP starts approximately 3 to 4 hours after administration and the maximum effect is reached after 8 to 12 hours. 
 
XALATAN may be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic drug products to lower IOP. If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered at least five (5) minutes apart. Contact lenses should be removed prior to the administration of XALATAN, and may be reinserted 15 minutes after administration  
 
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS  
 
Sterile ophthalmic solution containing 50 mcg/mL latanoprost. 
 
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS  
 
Known hypersensitivity to latanoprost, benzalkonium chloride, or any other ingredients in this 
product. 
 
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  
 
5.1 Pigmentation 
 
XALATAN has been reported to cause changes to pigmented tissues. The most frequently reported changes have been increased pigmentation of the iris, periorbital tissue (eyelid), and eyelashes. Pigmentation is expected to increase as long as latanoprost is administered.  
 
The pigmentation change is due to increased melanin content in the melanocytes rather than to an increase in the number of melanocytes. After discontinuation of latanoprost, pigmentation of the iris is likely to be permanent, while pigmentation of the periorbital tissue and eyelash changes have been reported to be reversible in some patients. Patients who receive treatment 
Protocol No. AKB -9778 -CI-OS-2001 
Amendment # 2 Integrated   May 17 , 2020 
  
Aerpio  — Company Confidential 
Page 82 of 89  should be informed of the possibility of increased pigmentation. Beyond 5 years the effects of 
increased pigmentation are not known [ see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. 
 Iris color change may not be noticeable for several months to years. T ypically, the brown 
pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the periphery of the iris and the entire iris or parts of the iris  become more brownish. Neither nevi nor freckles of the iris appear 
to be affected by treatment. While treatment with XALATAN can be continued in patients who develop noticeably increased iris pigmentation, these patients should be examined regularly [ see 
Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. 
 
5.2 Eyelash Changes 
 
XALATAN may gradually change eyelashes and vellus hair in the treated eye; these changes 
include increased length, thickness, pigmentation, the number of lashes or hairs, and misdirected growth of eyelashes. Eyelash changes are usually reversible upon discontinuation of treatment [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. 
 5.3 Intraocular Inflammation 
 
XALATAN should be used with caution in patients with a history of intraocular inflammation (iritis/uveitis) and should generally not be used in patients with active intraocular inflammation because inflam mation may be exacerbated. 
 5.4 Macular Edema  
 
Macular edema, including cystoid macular edema, has been reported during treatment with XALATAN. XALATAN should be used with caution in aphakic patients, in pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule, or in patients with known risk factors for macular edema.  
 5.5 Herpetic Keratitis  
 
Reactivation of Herpes Simplex keratitis has been reported during treatment with XALATAN. XALATAN should be used with caution in patients with a history of herpetic keratitis.  
XALATAN should be avoided in cases of active herpes simplex keratitis because inflammation may be exacerbated.  
 
5.6 Bacterial  Keratitis  
 
There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple -dose containers 
of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by 
patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ].

• Macular edema, including cystoid macular edema [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] 
 
6.1 Clinical Trials Experience  
 
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates 
observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.  
 
XALAT AN was studied in three multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trials. Patients 
received 50 mcg/mL XALATAN once daily or 5 mg/mL active- comparator (timolol) twice 
daily. The patient population studied had a mean age of 65±10 years. Seven percent of patients withdrew before the 6 -month endpoint.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience 
 
The following reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of XALATAN in clinical 
practice. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their f requency or establish a causal relationship to drug 
exposure. The reactions, which have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, possible causal connection to XALATAN, or a combination of these factors, include:  
 
Nervous System disorders : Dizziness; headache; toxic epidermal necrolysis  
 
Eye Disorders: Eyelash and vellus hair changes of the eyelid (increased length, thickness, 
pigmentation, and number of eyelashes); keratitis; corneal edema and erosions; intraocular inflammation (iritis/uveitis); macular edema, including cystoid macular edema; trichiasis; periorbital and lid changes resulting in deepening of the eyelid sulcus; iris cyst; eyelid skin darkening; localised skin reaction on the eyelids; conjunctivitis; pseudopemphigoid of the ocular conjunctiva

7 DRUG  INTERACTIONS  
 
In vitro studies have shown that precipitation occurs when eye drops containing thimerosal are 
mixed with XALATAN. If such drugs are used, they should be administered at least five (5) minutes apart.  
 
The combined use of two or more prostaglandins, or prostaglandin analogs including XALATAN is not recommended. It has been shown that administration of these prostaglandin drug products more than once daily may decrease the IOP lowering effect or cause paradoxical elevations in IOP.  
 
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  
 
8.1 Pregnancy  
Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C. 
 
Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits. In rabbits, an incidence of 4 of 16 
dams had no viable fetuses at a dose that was approximately 80 times the maximum human dose, 
and the highest nonembryocidal dose in rabbits was approximately 15 times the maximum human dose. 
 
There are no adequate and well -controlled studies in pregnant women. XALATAN should be 
used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  
8.3 Nursing  Mothers  
 
It is not known whether this drug or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Becaus e many 
drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when XALATAN is administered 
to a nursing woman. 
 
8.4 Pediatric  Use 
 
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.  
 8.5 Geriatric Use 
 
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and 
younger patients.

If overdosage with XALATAN occurs, treatment should be symptomatic. 
 
11 DESCRIPTION 
 
Latanoprost is a prostaglandin F 2α analogue. Its chemical name is isopropyl- (Z)-
7[(1R,2R,3R,5S)3,5- dihydroxy-2- [(3R) -3-hydroxy-5-phenylpentyl]cyclopentyl]-5-heptenoate. 
Its molecular formula is C 26H40O5 and its chemical structure is:  
 
 
Latanoprost is a colorless to sligh tly yellow oil that is very soluble in acetonitrile and freely 
soluble in acetone, ethanol, ethyl acetate, isopropanol, methanol, and octanol. It is practically insoluble in water.  
 
XALATAN ® (latanoprost ophthalmic solution) 0.005% is supplied as a sterile, isotonic, 
buffered aqueous solution of latanoprost with a pH of approximately 6.7 and an osmolality of approximately 267 mOsmol/kg. Each mL of XALATAN contains 50 mcg of latanoprost. Benzalkonium chloride, 0.02% is added as a preservative. The inactive i ngredients are: sodium 
chloride, sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate, disodium hydrogen phosphate anhydrous, 
and water for injection. One drop contains approximately 1.5 mcg of latanoprost. 
 
12 CLINICAL  PHARMACOLOGY 
 
12.1 Mechanism of  Action  
 
Latanoprost is a prostanoid selective FP receptor agonist that is believed to reduce the intraocular 
pressure (IOP) by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor. Studies in animals and man suggest that the main  
mechanism of action is increased uveoscleral ou tflow. Elevated IOP represents a major risk 
factor for glaucomatous field loss. The higher the level of IOP, the greater the likelihood of optic nerve damage and visual field loss.

Page 87 of 89  Reduction of the IOP in man starts about 3-4 hours after administration and maximum effect is 
reached after 8 -12 hours. IOP reduction is present for at least 24 hours. 
 
12.3 Pharmacokinetics  
 
Absorption 
 
Latanoprost is absorbed through the cornea where the isopropyl ester prodrug is hydrolyzed to the acid form to be come biologically active.  
 
Distribution  
 
The distribution volume in humans is 0.16 ± 0.02 L/kg. The acid of latanoprost can be measured in aqueous humor during the first 4 hours, and in plasma only during the first hour after local administration. Studies in man indicate that the peak concentration in the aqueous humor is reached about two hours after topical administration.  
 
Metabolism  
 
Latanoprost, an isopropyl ester prodrug, is hydrolyzed by esterases in the cornea to the biologic ally active acid. The active acid of latanoprost reaching the systemic circulation is 
primarily metabolized by the liver to the 1,2-dinor and 1,2,3,4- tetranor metabolites via fatty acid 
β-oxidation. 
 
Excretion 
 
The elimination of the acid of latanoprost from human plasma is rapid (t 1/2 = 17 min) after both 
intravenous and topical administration. Systemic clearance is approximately 7 mL/min/kg. Following hepatic β - oxidation, the metabolites are mainly eliminated via the kidneys. 
Approximately 88% and 98% of the administered dose are recovered in the urine after topical and intravenous dosing, respectively. 
 
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 
 
13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of  Fertility  
 
Latanoprost was not carcinogenic in either mice or rats when administered by oral gavage at doses of up to 170 mcg/kg/day (approximately 2800 times the recommended maximum human dose) for up to 20 and 24 months, respectively. 
 
Latanoprost was not mutagenic in bacteria, in mouse lymphoma, or in mouse micronucleus tests. Chromosome aberrations were observed in vitro with human lymphocytes. Additional in vitro 
and in vivo studies on unscheduled DNA synthesis in rats were negative.  Latanoprost has not been found to have any effect on male or female fertility in animal studies.

14.1 Elevated Baseline IOP  
 
Patients with mean baseline IOP of 24 – 25 mmHg who were treated for 6 months in multi-
center, randomized, controlle d trials demonstrated 6 – 8 mmHg reductions in IOP. This IOP 
reduction with XALATAN 0.005% dosed once daily was equivalent to the effect of timolol 0.5% dosed twice daily.  
 
14.2 Progression of Increased Iris Pigmentation  
 
A 3-year open -label, prospective safety  study with a 2-year extension phase was conducted to 
evaluate the progression of increased iris pigmentation with continuous use of XALATAN once-
daily as adjunctive therapy in 519 patients with open- angle glaucoma. The analysis was based on 
observed- cases population of the 380 patients who continued in the extension phase. 
 Results showed that the onset of noticeable increased iris pigmentation occurred within the first year of treatment for the majority of the patients who developed noticeable increased iris pigmentation. Patients continued to show signs of increasing iris pigmentation throughout the 
five years of the study. Observation of increased iris pigmentation did not affect the incidence, 
nature, or severity of adverse events (other than increased iris pigmentation) recorded in the study. IOP reduction was similar regardless of the development of increased iris pigmentation during the study. 
 
16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING  
 
XALATAN is a clear, isotonic, buffered, preserved colorless solution of latanoprost 0.005% (50 
mcg/mL). It is supplied as a 2.5 mL solution in a 5 mL clear low density polyethylene bottle with 
a clear polyethylene dropper tip, a turquoise high density polyethylene screw cap, and a tamper-evident clear low density polyethylene overcap. 
 
2.5 mL fill, 0.005% (50 mcg/mL): Package of 1 bottle: NDC 0013-8303-04 
 
Storage: Protect from light. Store unopened bottle(s) under refrigeration at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F). During shipment to the patient, the bottle may be maintained at temperatures up to 40°C (104°F) for a period not exceeding 8 days. Once a bottle is opened for use, it may be stored at room temperature up to 25°C (77°F) for 6 weeks. 
17. PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION 
 
Potential for Pigmentation  
Advise patients about the potential for increased brown pigmentation of the iris, which may be 
permanent. Inform patients about the possibility of eyelid skin darkening, which may be reversible after discontinuation of XALATAN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 
 
Potential for Eyelash Changes  
 
Protocol No. AKB -9778 -CI-OS-2001 
Amendment # 2 Integrated   May 17 , 2020 
  
Aerpio  — Company Confidential 
Page 89 of 89  Inform patients of the possibility of eyelash and vellus hair changes in the treated eye during 
treatment with XALATAN. These changes may result in a disparity between eyes in length, thickness, pigmentation, number of eye lashes or vellus hairs, and/or direction of eyelash growth. 
Eyelash changes are usually reversible upon discontinuation of treatment.  
Handling the Container  
 
Instruct patients to avoid allowing the tip of the dispensing container to contact the eye or 
surrounding structures because this could cause the tip to become contaminated by common bacteria known to cause ocular infections. Serious damage to the eye and subsequent loss of vision may result from using contaminated solutions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. 
 
When to Seek Physician Advice  
 
Advise patients that if they develop an intercurrent ocular condition ( e.g., trauma or infection) or 
have ocular surgery, or develop any ocular reactions, particularly conjunctivitis and eyelid 
reactions, they sh ould immediately seek their physician’s advice concerning the continued use of 
the multiple -dose container. 
 
Use with Contact Lenses 
 
Advise patients that XALATAN contains benzalkonium chloride, which may be absorbed by 
contact lenses. Contact lenses should be removed prior to administration of the solution. Lenses may be reinserted 15 minutes following administration of XALATAN.  
 Use with Other Ophthalmic Drugs  
 
If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered a t least 
five (5) minutes apart.

Protocol Synopsis  
 
Title of Study: Pilot Trial to Evaluate Blood and Imaging Based Biomarkers for Aromatase Inhibitor Induced Musculoskeletal  Syndrome (AIMSS)   
 
Hypotheses:  Baseline plasma oxylipin profiles can be used to predict who is at risk for 
developing AIMSS.  
 Primary Objectives:  
 
• To compare baseline oxylipin levels in women that do vs. those that do not develop AIMSS  
 
Secondary Objectives: 
 
• To correlate changes in oxylipin panels with changes in tendon stiffness   
• To correlate changes in levels of oxylipins with changes in pain scores through 6-month AI treatment.  
 
Study design: This is a prospective single arm  study  enrolling patients (n = 35) with breast 
cancer scheduled to start adjuvant hormonal therapy. Patients would have completed all 
their primary treatments (surgery±  radiation therapy) and are scheduled to start their 
adjuvant hormonal therapy. They get baseline blood drawn for oxylipi ns. They start 
adjuvant anastrozole and have blood drawn at 3mths and 6mths for measurement of oxylipins .. This is a pilot trial to evaluate blood biomarkers. Once pilot data is analyzed, 
goal is to apply for funding for a larger trial to further evaluate and validate these biomarkers

Statistical analysis 
 
Statistical Considerations:  This is a pilot study to estimate the values needed to 
design a larger study.  The primary objectives are to estimate the baseline oxylipin levels 
in patients who develop with AIMSS vs. those who do not develop AIMSS.  Analysis will 
be based on descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals for each group.  
Although we will not formally test for differences between the two groups, we will estimate the difference with a 95% confidence interval to inform the design of a larger 
study.   
 The secondary objectives are to correlate changes in oxylipin levels with changes in pain 
scores.  These analyses will be based on all 20 women, irrespective of whether they develop AIMSS.   
 Feasibility Issues:  From 2015 to 2016, ~ 40 patients were started on adjuvant 
anastrozole therapy who meet our eligibility criteria. Thus, we anticipate accrual of 2 -3 
patients per month and completion of accrual this pilot study w ithin 8 -12 months of study 
initiation. Based on previously published studies, it is  expected that 50% of women 
initiating AI will develop AIMSS within one year, with most women experiencing symptoms by 2 months.
17 Women who discontinue use of anastrozole before the 6 month visit will 
complete all measurements at the time  that they switch to another AI and come off study.  
 
Dr. Chalasani  and the research personnel will be conducting monthly meetings to review 
patient accrual data, address any barriers to accruals and resolve them in a timely manner. Dr.Martinez will be overseeing the oxylipin data analysis.

Protocol Version 4 dated December 2, 2020  
 1. Introduction  
 
Aromatase Inhibitors (AIs), Adherence, Musculoskeletal Symptoms and Mortality. 
Adjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy is the recommended first -line adjuvant 
treatment for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast 
cancer based on  improved disease- free survival (DFS) compared to tamoxifen in 
randomized control trials. More recently extended adjuvant AI therapy (for 10 years) has 
been shown to improve DFS when compared to placebo in women who completed 5 
years of standard AI therapy .1,2 However, AI therapy has been associated with 
significant, activity -limiting musculoskeletal symptoms including arthralgia, myalgia and 
joint stiffness or AI -induced musculoskeletal syndrome (AIMSS).3 AIs block estrogen 
synthesis and induce menopausal symptoms that are particularly severe in younger 
patients.4,5 Muscul oskeletal complaints are among the most commonly reported and 
debilitating side effects of adjuvant AI therapy;6 findings that are supported by 
observations in aromatase knockout mice which exhibit increased pain responses.7 
Among women with arthralgia syndromes at initiation of AI therapy, half report symptom exacerbation. Joint -related symptoms manifest early after initiation of AI therapy with 
worsening of symptoms up to 1 year post -initiation of AI.
8,9 AIMSS impairs ability to 
perform activities of daily living as well as work -related tasks as the most commonly 
affected joints are hands, knees and hips .10,11 In a survey conducted by Breast Cancer 
Action, 27% of respondents reported that they had discontinued adjuvant AI use because of adverse effects (AE), with AIMSS being the leading AE.
12 In a cohort study in 
California, 61% of patients on AIs developed joint and/or bone pain resulting in 
discontinuation of therapy in 20% of patients.13 In a recent study, full adherence, defined 
as full duration and optimal schedule, was observed for only 49% of breast cancer (BC) patients prescribed any hormone therapy (HT) and was related to higher mortality in 
those who discontinued [Hazards Ratio (HR) = 1.26 (Confidence interval (CI) 1.09– 
1.46)] or were non- adherent to HT [HR = 1.49 (CI 1.23– 1.81)].
14 This study is concerning 
and consistent with clinical trial evidence from prior tamoxifen studies showing higher 
recurrence rates and worse outcomes with < 5 years or suboptimal HT use.15-17 Clearly, 
there is a need to maximize efficacy and improve tolerance t o AIs. Approaches to study 
interventions that enhance both adherence and response rates for AIs are important 
research and clinical gaps that must be addressed to reduce death from breast 
cancer.18,19 A critical first step is to identify those who are at risk of developing 
AIMSS by developing predictive biomarkers that will provide physicians 
opportunity for early intervention, thereby improving adherence to AIs. Currently 
there are no predictive biomarkers available to identify those at risk of developing 
AIMSS.  
Mechanisms of Aromatase Inhibitor -Associated Pain. The mechanism of AIMSS is 
not well understood and is grossly understudied. Based on observational data and 
animal data, it is likely that AIMSS is directly related, at least in part, to a) loss of the 
anti-nociceptive action of estradiol - resulting in greater sensitivity to stimuli and b) 
presence of underlying inflammation and the nociceptive activity or pain- inducing 
response of PGE 2. In aromatase -knockout mice, which lack endogenous estrogen 
production and serve as an animal model of AI therapy, estrogen deprivation results in a 
dominance of pro- nociceptive (pain) over anti -nociceptive response mechanisms 
following noxious stimuli such as formalin injection.20 Results from experimental models 
to determine the role of estradiol in inflammation and specifically in cyclooxygenase 
(COX) -mediated PGE 2 are inconsistent and model dependent. Hunter et al  
demonstrated that ovariectomized rats exhibited greater sensitivity to a pain stimulus, as 
7 
Protocol Version 4 dated December 2, 2020  
 measured by latency to paw withdrawal following an inflammatory insult.21 Serum levels 
of PGE 2 were increased in these rats, indicating an increase in inflammation. Pain 
sensit ivity was reversed with estradiol replacement but serum PGE 2 levels did not 
change, indi cating a separate mechanism for  inflammatory response. The addition of a 
COX2 inhibitor increased latency to paw withdrawal compared to estradiol replacement 
alone, indicating a reduced pain response for these animals, and again indicating separate roles for inflammation and estradiol in pain response.
22 Using this same model, 
ibuprofen (a non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drug, NSAID; a COX inhibitor) + estradiol 
replacement was shown to be more effective in reducing pain than either estradiol or 
ibuprofen alone.22 Collectively, these results indicate that the loss of estrogen alone 
does not increase pain by inducing PGE 2; but in the presence of PGE 2-mediated 
inflammation, estrogen deprivation increases sensitivity to inflammatory pain. Therefore, if PGE
2 is elevated at baseline, this can predispose women to experience pain 
upon the depletion of estradiol with the addition of an AI.  
In healthy women, joint and muscle pain worsen with age with greatest increases 
between 50 - 59 years.23,24 New onset of rheumatoid arthritis is also highest in the 
decade following menopause. Such observations, in combination with extensive experimental studies in animal models, have established estradiol as having both anti -
inflammatory and anti -nociceptive properties.
24 Increased inflammation with aging, 
mediated by bradykinin and the pro -inflammatory prostaglandins (PGs), including PGE 2, 
has been mechanistically linked to hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to painful stimuli) 
and allodynia (painful response to what would normally be an innocuous stimulus). Thus, 
inflammation and injury that stimulate PG release are thought to result in a heightened nociception and allodynia with the decline in estradiol levels with menopause.
25  
Management of AIMSS in AI Patients . While all 3 third -generation AIs in routine clinical 
use cause different levels of estradiol suppression,26 toxicity profiles are similar for all of 
them.27-29 Further, many studies show that  there is no correlation with degree of estrogen 
depletion and pain in women on AI, regardless of AI type.30,31 Differences between 
agents in terms of quality of life (QOL) and tolerability are very important when selecting 
the optimal therapy for individual patients. Randomized clinical trials comparing 
tolerability and QOL between letrozole and anastrozole did not show any significant 
differences between the QOL scores. They did report that subjects who were intolerant 
to one AI were nonetheless able to tolerate another agent.32,33 Other studies have also 
demonstrated that switching AIs can result in improvements of AIMSS.33,34 This is a 
significant finding given that —despite AIs having similar toxi city profiles —AIMSS can 
sometimes be managed by switching AIs .   
AIMSS management is an area of active research interest. For patients developing AIMSS, the re is evidence that acupuncture
,35,36 high dose vitamin D37 or exercise38 might 
help in alleviating their symptoms. Yet results are not always consistent  and are limited 
by small numbers of participants. Recently, a randomized, placebo- controlled study 
reported a 50% decrease in AIMSS symptoms with ω -3 fatty acid supplementation; 
however, this change was not significantly different when compared to the placebo arm.
39 Retrospective clinical data reported a significantly decreased recurrence and 
longer disease- free survival in obese women with ER+ tumors who take NSAIDs.40 Anti-
inflammatory medications like NSAIDs or COX2 inhibitors might alleviate arthralgia and myalgia but have gastrointestinal and cardiac side effects. Currently, for a patient who 
develops AIMSS, routine management  involves i) pain control with NSAID’s or other 
pain medicines, ii) stopping and switching to a different AI or tamoxifen, iii) stopping adjuvant hormonal therapy completely or iv) referral to orthopedic surgeon based on 
8 
Protocol Version 4 dated December 2, 2020  
 symptom severity. It is important to realize not all patients who take AIs develop 
AIMSS . It is crucial to determine which patients are at risk so that preventative strategies 
can be implemented early on to improve adherence to AI therapy and eventually 
decrease breast cancer relapse and death. Identifying at -risk subjects by developing 
predictive biomarkers is a critical unmet need in AIMSS.  
Pain and Oxylipin Cascade. While PGE 2 is the best -studied metabolite of arachidonic 
acid metabolism, arachidonic acid and other polyunsaturated fatty acids (i.e., ω -3 and ω -
6) are also metabolized by the lipoxygenases (LOX) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
enzymes, yielding distinct sets of metabolites with their own biological activities. 
Collectively, these COX, LOX and CYP metabolites are called oxylipins. The oxylipin 
metabolites of ω -3 and ω -6 fatty acids comprise over 100 metabolites, each of which 
exhibit potent biological effects, including acting as modulators of inflammation (pro - and 
anti-) as well as activators of angiogenesis and mediators of hyper algesia and 
allodynia.41-43 Recently, it has been demonstrated that there is cross -talk between the 
estrogen receptor and LOX -mediated oxylipins,44 and that AIs can upregulate the 
CYP450 pathway and downstream epoxyeicosatrienoic acids in vitro .45 It is well 
established that downregulation of PGE 2 production through inhibition of COX2 
alleviates inflammatory pain. Preliminary evidence implicates both the CYP450 and LOX pathways in the development of tendinopathy.
46,47 Two earlier clinical trials showed that 
12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12 -HETE) was significantly correlated with pain in 
menstruating women,48,49 suggesting interplay between 12-H ETE and hormonal 
changes. Our preliminary data in AI -treated women participating in an intervention with 
sulindac (a non -selective COX2 inhibitor) suggests involvement of 12 -HETE and other 
LOX metabolites in AIMSS (see Approach). If we successfully show that oxylipins are 
pathogenic in the development of AIMSS, there are already pharmacologic agents available (COX and LOX inhibitors) or in development (CYP pathway inhibitors) that can 
be implemented to target these pathways
50 and alleviate symptoms, with the ultimate 
goal of improving AI adherence in clinical practice. As cited above, interventional cl inical 
trials have been inconsistent, and there have been no studies that have determined predictive blood- based biomarkers for AIMSS in order to guide optimal subject selection 
to study appropriate interventions.   
 
Preliminary Data:  
Oxylipins:  
Dr. Chalasani is institutional PI of an ongoing 
clinical trial to determine the effect of sulindac (an 
NSAID) on breast density and pain in women that 
have been stable on AI for 6 months. Participants receive sulindac (150 mg BID) for 12 months. Table 2: Relationship between

 Plasma and urine samples are collected before and after a 3 -month observation period 
(months -3 and 0), and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months on sulindac.  
Participant demographics. This study is currently conducted in post -menopausal women 
diagnosed with ER+ breast cancer. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study 
regarding breast cancer history are the similar as the proposed work except that 
participants in the Sulindac trial must have been stable on AI for 6 months and exclusion criteria for this trial also includes active smokers, history of diabetes mellitus, 
uncontrolled hypertension, GI ulcers and bleeding diathesis .  
Oxylipins in women on AI. We have conducted oxylipin profiling in the plasma and urine 
in 10 women after the 3 month observation period (selected based on availability of 
samples). We quantified 92 total oxylipins in plasma and 87 in urine with good reproducibility. PGE
2 levels were similar to the ranges previously reported in plasma of 
other breast cancer patients.86-88 Levels of target oxylipins after a 3 -month observation 
period (PGE 2 and 12 -HETE) in women on AI are presented in Table 1.  
Pain and oxylipins. How much pain interferes with daily activities such as walking ability 
was evaluated using the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI -SF). Oxylipin levels after a 
3 month observation period were correlated with questionnaire items at the same time-
point. Table 2  presents the results from linear regression comparing how much pain 
interferes with walking ability and selected plasma oxylipin levels in 10 women stable on 
AI.  PGE 2 levels were not correlated with how much pain interfered with walking ability. 
However, plasma levels of the LOX metabolite, 12- HETE, were significantly correlated. 
While not statistically significant, a similar pattern was observed across multiple LOX 
metabolites. This trend could still be observed in only 10 participants with overall  low 
scores for how much pain interferes with walking ability (mean ± SD; 2.48 ± 2.45), which 
suggests a role for the LOX arm of the oxylipin pathway in the development of AIMSS. 
There was no correlation (positive or negative) with CYP450- derived metabolites and 
pain scores (data not shown).  
While these results are promising and suggest that the LOX pathway may be related to AIMSS, samples from this clinical trial have several limitations. First, participants in this 
study were stable on AI for at least 6 months. Therefore, there is no true “baseline” to 
quantify oxylipins levels. Second, hand -specific symptoms, common in AIMSS, were not 
evaluated. Third, there is no BPI -SF score that specifically addresses AIMSS 
development. Fourth, while we have presented  our preliminary data from the baseline 
(post -NSAID washout and 3 month observation period) only, women in this study initiate 
intervention with sulindac (a non- specific COX2 inhibitor). Thus, it is likely that the 
oxylipin cascade will be modulated by the intervention, and stored samples from this trial 
will not be appropriate to determine changes in oxylipins related to the natural history of AIMSS. Despite these limitations, these data demonstrate that oxylipins are quantifiable in the plasma of women currently taking an AI, and that they are present in a wide 
enough range of levels to relate to pain scores.

Protocol Version 4 dated December 2, 2020  
 5.3 Research Blood Draw  
 
Currently there are no blood based biomarkers evaluating AIMSS. We propose to 
prospectively collect blood for this pilot study for initial analysis of oxylipins.  
Fasting blood will be drawn at the pre -determined time points (figure 1)  and sent to Dr.  
Martinez’s laboratory at the University of Arizona Cancer Center for further processing.  
 5.4 Self-reported questionnaires 
 
The following questionnaires will be administered for the study to look for potential 
confounders like depression which can influence reporting of pain. The pain questionnaires will help us classify AIMSS in an objective way.   Pain Assessment . Breast Cancer Prevention Trial –Musculoskeletal Symptom (BCPT -
MS) subscale and The Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) have been validated as the most responsive tools for evaluating the development of 
AIMSS.
62 These tools will be administered by the study nurse. 
BCPT -MS: Individuals with a subscale score of ≥1.5 on the BCPT- MS are considered to 
have developed AIMSS, and it is expected that 50% of our sample will develop 
AIMSS.62,63 Our primary study endpoints will be correlated to three items on the BCPT-
MS: general aches and pains, joint pain, and muscle stiffness.64,65 The BCPT -MS was 
derived from the original BCPT Symptom Check -list, a 18 -item questionnaire validated in 
breast cancer survivors.66 The subscale score consists of the mean of responses to 
three questions addressing general aches and pains, joint pain, and muscle stiffness(questions 8,9,10 of the attached subscale). Scores range from 0–4 , with higher 
scores representing worse symptoms. Changes in the BCPT- MS subscale have been 
shown to be the most responsive to changes in AIMSS with 54% of women developing 
AIMSS within 6 months.
62   
WOMAC:  The WOMAC is a 24 -item instrument developed to assess pain, stiffness, and 
physical function in participants with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis.68 This instrument is 
well validated and has been modified from its original form, and used extensively to 
examine specific joint pain changes following treatment, including drug- based (NSAID) 
interventions for back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, and fibromyalgia.69-78  For our study, we 
will use the 5 -point Likert format.  
Depression Questionnaire. It has been reported that up to 50% of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients have symptoms of depression or anxiety
79 and perception of pain 
may be altered in individuals with symptoms  of depression.80 Therefore, we will also 
administer the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) -9 questionnaire, which is a validated 
multipurpose tool used for screening, diagnosing, monitoring, and measuring severity of depression.
81 Additionally, the PHQ -9 has been successfully used in breast cancer 
patients to evaluate psychometric properties.82,83 
 
 
5.5 Toxicities to be monitored  
 Monitoring for side effects from anastrozole will be done per their standard of care by patient’s treating physician.

Protocol Version 4 dated December 2, 2020  
 5.6 Follow Up  
 
Patients will not be followed for this study  after completion of the 6  mths blood draw, study 
questionnaires . However, they will continue to follow -up with their treating physician per 
standard of care.  
 
6. Criteria for Evaluation  
 
The primary endpoint is comparing baseline oxylipin levels for patients who develop 
AIMSS vs. those who do not develop AIMSS. For this pilot trial of 20 evaluable patients 
we expect 10 patients to develop AIMSS and 10 who do not develop AIMSS. The g oal is 
to prospectively evaluate for any  baseline levels in both groups and for  changes in oxylipin 
panels.  
 
 
7. Statistical Considerations:   
 This is a pilot study to estimate the values needed to design a larger study.  The primary 
objectives are to estimate the baseline oxylipin levels in patients who develop AIMSS vs. 
those who do not develop AIMSS.  Descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals 
will be computed for two baseline oxylipin levels (PGE
2 and 12 -HETE)  for each group .  
Based on clinical observation, it is expected that 50% of the women will develop AIMSS.  Ten patients in each group will allow us to estimate the 95% confidence interval with width 1.4 times the observed standard deviation.  Although we will not formally test for 
differences between the two groups, we will estimate the difference between the means 
with a 95% confidence interval, to inform the sample size justification for a larger study.  
 
 The secondary objectives are to correlate changes in oxylipin levels with changes in pain 
scores.  These analyses will be based on all 20 women,  irrespective of whether they 
develop AIMSS.    We expect that only a small number of women may switch to another AI due to the development of AIMSS.  For these women, we will use the values obtained 
at the time of the switch.  Linear regression will be used to estimate the change in pain 
scores (as measured by the BCPT -MS) versus changes in PGE
2, 12-HETE.  
Additionally, we will control for changes in depression levels as measured by the PHQ -9. 
This model will allow us to estimate the effects of each of the oxylipin measures adjusted 
for depression in a single model.    
8.Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
The University of Arizona Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has 
determined that this study falls into the low risk category with regards to  DSMB oversight

Protocol Version 4 dated December 2, 2020  
  
Identification of the entity obligated for routine monitoring duties:  
Routine monitoring will be provided by the Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA /QC) 
Program to ensure that the investigation is conducted according to protocol design and 
regulatory requirements.  
 
This trial will also undergo real -time monitoring by the PI and study team, including 
documentation of real- time monitoring of any new or  ongoing safety issues.  PI will review 
with the study team on a monthly basis regarding any routine safety or adverse issues. 
Adverse events and serious adverse events will be dealt right away as per DSMB/IRB 
requirements. The study team will inform the PI via email regarding any  AE’s and 
subsequent notification forms for the AE’s will be completed and filed.     
  Monitoring progress and data review process:  
Routine monitoring of subject data will be conducted at least quarterly.   
The first routine monitoring visit  will include at a minimum:  
• Informed consent – 50% of cases enrolled;  
• Subject eligibility – 10% of cases, up to two subjects;  
• Data review – 10% of cases, up to two subjects.  
 All subsequent monitoring visits will consist of randomly selected subject cases based on 
current enrollment and include continuing review of previously selected cases, as applicable.  
 
A monitoring visit report and follow -up letter will be completed approximately two weeks 
after the routine monitoring visit; a copy will be maintained in the study file. The monitor will request additional source documentation, clarification, information, or corrections to 
the CRF and/or regulatory records from the Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) or other applicable staff responsible for the study and resoluti on of queries/findings.  
Documentation of such a request will be maintained with a copy of the monitor’s visit report for follow -up at the next monitoring visit. Electronic records will be available in the 
institutional database or provided by the QA/QC Program staff.  
 The Principal Investigator will ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility and timeliness 
of the data reported in the Case Report Form (CRF), or other acceptable data formats. 
Source documentation supporting the study data should indicate  the subject’s 
participation in the trial and should document the dates and details of study procedures, adverse events, and patient status.  
 
Case report forms, which include the inclusion/exclusion criteria form , adverse event forms 
and serious adverse event forms, etc.  should be completed via the institution database or 
other acceptable data formats. Trials using paper CRFs will have the data entered with a 
black ball -point pen or typed. Corrections to the forms should not obscure the original entry 
and should be made by striking the incorrect information with a single line. Each strike 
should be accompanied by the initials of the corrector and the correction date. All subject forms and study files will be stored in a secure area limited to authorized sta ff.

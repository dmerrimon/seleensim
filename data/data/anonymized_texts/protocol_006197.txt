 Introduction  
Background  and rationale  
Approximately  30,000 -50,000  patients  suffer  from SAH every  year in North  America,  
and it accounts  for 5% of all strokes  in the USA.  The grave  nature  of this disease  results  
in an approximately  35-50% mortality  rate. As medical  technology  and techniques  have  
improved,  more  and more  of these  patients  are surviving  this devastating  neurological  
injury.  However,  the increasing  number  of survivors  faces  many  challenges  in their 
recovery  and return  to a normal  life.  
 
A stroke  occurs  when  a blood  vessel  that carries  oxygen  and nutrients  to the brain  is 
either  blocked  by a clot or bursts  (or ruptures).  When  that happens,  part of the brain  
cannot  get the blood  (and oxygen)  it needs,  so it and brain  cells die. Stroke  can be 
caused  either  by a clot obstructing  the flow of blood  to the brain  (called  an ischemic  
stroke)  or by a blood  vessel  rupturing  and preventing  blood  flow to the brain  (called  a 
hemorrhagic  stroke).  There  are two types  of hemorrhagic  stroke:  intracerebral  
hemorrhage  (ICH)  and subarachnoid  hemorrhage  (SAH).   ICH stroke  happens  when  a 
blood  vessel  inside  the brain  bursts  and leaks  blood  into surrounding  brain  tissue.  The 
bleeding  causes  brain  cells to die and the affected  part of the brain  stops  working  
correctly.  SAH stroke  involves  bleeding  in the area between  the brain  and the tissue  
covering  the brain,  known  as the subarachnoid  space.  SAH stroke  can be caused  by 
malformation  of the blood  vessels,  bleeding  disorders,  blood  thinners,  or most  
commonly  by burst  aneurysms.  This type of stroke  is called  aneurysmal  subarachnoid  
hemorrhage  or aSAH.   
 
Survivors  of SAH often  suffer  from new depression  disorders  after recovery,  resulting  in 
a decreased  quality  of life and increased  health  care costs.  Approximately  1/3 of all 
SAH patients  without  a previous  history  of mood  disorder  have  signs  or symptoms  of 
depression  at least  one year after hospitalization.  Multiple  studies  of patients  who 
become  depressed  after any type of significant  injury  show  that their treatment  is at 
least  twice  the cost of patients  who do not develop  depression.  This cost rises  
substantially  with both age and depression  severity.  
  
Our goal with this study  is twofold;  first, to address  the gap in knowledge  of utility  of 
prophylactic  SSRI  in the aSAH  subpopulation  of stroke  patients,  and second,  to study  
the role of cortisol  regulation  in susceptibility  to depression  so that we might  identify  
what  patients  would  most  benefit  from SSRI  prophylaxis.  We hypothesize  that placing  
aSAH  patients  on preventative  anti-depressant  medications  at the time of stroke  may 
both improve  their lives and the lives of their families,  while  also decreasing  post-injury  
health  care costs.  
 
Fluoxetine  (an antidepressant  commonly  known  as Prozac)  is among  a group  of 
medications  known  as selective -serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  that work  to maintain  
higher -than-normal  levels  of serotonin,  a neurotransmitter  popularly  associated  with 
contributions  to well-being  and happiness.  Fluoxetine  is a World  Health  Organization  
Essential  Medicine  and is considered  a first-line treatment  for depression  by the 
American  Psychiatric  Association.  In addition,  fluoxetine  has a fast treatment  effects  
and is inexpensive.  It is currently  not standard  to implement  antidepressant  medications  
after aneurysm  rupture  due to the lack of studies  on their preventative  benefits  to aSAH  
patients.  
 
The use of SSRIs  has been  studied  in the general  poststroke  population,  to include  
patients  with aSAH.  However,  the aSAH  population  has not been  evaluated  as an 
independent  experimental  cohort.   These  studies  demonstrated  no difference  in adverse  
events  between  the stroke  population  and general  population.  Furthermore,  one arm of 
the ongoing  poststroke  depression  triad trials  (AFFINITY,  FOCUS,  and EFFECT)  is also 
including  aSAH  patients,  but again  not looking  at these  patients  as an independent  
experimental  cohort.  Meta -analyses  have  demonstrated  “Poststroke  depression  has 
been  shown  in 6 double -blind  controlled  studies  to be effectively  treated  with 
antidepressants,  and 1 study  has recently  shown  that PSD can be effectively  prevented”  
(Robinson  2010).  More  granular  studies  evaluating  SSRIs  and hemorrhagic  stroke  also 
demonstrated  adverse  events  to be no more  frequent  than controls  as well as similar  
medical  outcomes.  Furthermore,  in our current  clinical  practice,  aSAH  patients  currently  
 on SSRIs  at presentation  are either  continued  on their SSRIs  or restarted  on their 
SSRIs  following  treatment,  without  increased  clinical  concern.  
 
This trial will evaluate  the effect  of preventative  treatment  of depression  in survivors  of 
aSAH  patients  to development  of depression.  Eligible  patients  will be divided  into three  
groups:  a control  group,  which  receives  a placebo  medication,  and an intervention  
group,  which  will receive  fluoxetine,  Patients  will be evaluated  for depression  and health  
care-related  quality  of life immediately  after treatment  of aSAH,  and several  times  over 
the first year of recovery.  We expect  that the patients  receiving  antidepressant  
medications  will show  an improvement  in depression  incidence,  depression  severity,  
and quality  of life when  compared  to those  patients  who receive  a placebo.  We 
anticipate  that these  patients  will have  reduced  post-injury  health  care utilization  costs  
and return  to work  more  often  than those  receiving  placebo.  The control  group  that 
receives  a placebo  is necessary  to prove  that the difference  between  the two groups  is 
based  on the effects  of fluoxetine,  rather  than a placebo  effect.   
 
Obje ctives  
We propose  a double -blinded  placebo -controlled  randomized  trial to evaluate  the effect  
of preventative  treatment  of depression  in survivors  of aneurysmal  subarachnoid  
hemorrhage  (aSAH),  a type of stroke.  
 
Trial  design  
This investigation  is pragmatic,  prospective,  double -blinded,  placebo -controlled  
randomized  trial to evaluate  the effect  of preventative  treatment  of depression  in 
survivors  of aneurysmal  SAH,  a type of non-traumatic,  hemorrhagic  stroke.  Over  a one-
year period,  English  speaking  adults  (18-85 years  old) of all genders  admitted  to, 
treated  at, and discharging  from Harborview  Medical  Center  for aneurysmal  SAH will be 
randomly  prescribed  either  an oral antidepressant  (the SSRI  fluoxetine,  commonly  
known  as Prozac)  or placebo  prior to discharge.  The control  group  that receives  a 
placebo  is necessary  to prove  that the difference  between  the two groups  is based  on 
the effects  of the antidepressant  medication,  rather  than a placebo  effect.  Patients  will 
 be evaluated  for depression  and health -related  quality  of life immediately  after treatment  
of SAH over the course  of a one year following  discharge.  Patients  declining  the 
randomized  trial, will be recruited  into an observational  cohort  to establish  baseline  
rates  of symptoms.  
 
Methods:  Participants,  interventions  and outcomes  
Study  setting  
The University  of Washington  School  of Medicine’s  Harborview  Medical  Center  is the 
primary  tertiary  referral  center  for the Pacific  Northwest  and WWAMI  region  and a 
Certified  Comprehensive  Stroke  Center,  per the Joint  Commission  and American  Heart  
Association/American  Stroke  Association.  Each  year over 200 patients  are admitted  to 
Harborview  Medical  Center  for aneurysmal  SAH.  Harborview  Medical  Center  maintains  
an Investigational  Drug  Service  that manages  medications  used  in clinical  trials.    
 
Eligibility  criteria  
1) Patients  18 years  of age and older  will be included.  
2) Patients  above  85 years  of age will be excluded  from the drug vs placebo  cohort.  
3) Patients  admitted  for subarachnoid  hemorrhage  from a ruptured  cerebral  
aneurysm  will be included.   
4) Non-English  speaking  patients  will be excluded.  
5) Patients  currently  receiving  therapy  for depression  or related  mental  health  
diagnoses  before  admission  will be excluded . 
6) Patients  with medical  contraindications  to fluoxetine  therapy  will be excluded  
from the drug vs placebo  arms  
7) Pregnant  patients  or patients  considering  pregnancy  during  the trial period  at the 
time of consent  will be excluded  from the drug vs placebo  arms . 
8) Patients  with active  psychosis  will be excluded.   
9) Patients  who are incarcerated  or in police  custody  will be excluded.  
10) Patients  with a comorbidity  or cognitive  impairment  (as determined  by a recruiter -
administered  Montreal  Cognitive  Assessment  [MoCA];  Patients  scoring  >20 are 
considered  of appropriate  cognitive  function  for consent)  that precludes  informed  
 consent  and participation  in the research  interviews  will be excluded  from the 
observational  and drug vs placebo  cohorts,  but may be included  in the biofluid  
cohort.  
 
Who  will take informed  consent?  
Potential  patient -subjects  will be identified  by neurosurgeons  on the treatment  team.  
Patients  will be recruited  and screened  for participation  in the drug vs placebo  or 
observational  cohort  by a member  of the research  team  prior to discharge.  Patient  
inclusion  and exclusion  will be determined  by the medical  record  as well as in-person  by 
the provider.  The Montreal  Cognitive  Assessment  will be administered  prior to the 
consent  to determine  baseline  cognitive  state.  We will also conduct  screening  to 
determine  if the patient  is currently  receiving  therapy  for depression  or related  mental  
health  diagnoses.  Any recruiter  who administers  the MoCA  completes  MoCA  training  
and certification.  Patients  scoring  >20 on the MoCA  are considered  of appropriate  
cognitive  function  to participate  in the study.  
 
Patients  recruited  for the drug vs placebo  cohort  will be provided  with a detailed  
explanation  regarding  the study  protocol,  occurrence  of depression  in aneurysmal  
subarachnoid  hemorrhage  and the potential  treatment  effects  of fluoxetine.  Patients  will 
have  an opportunity  for questions  before  providing  before  consent.  Decisional  capacity  
will be determined  by having  participants  confirm  their understanding  of the study  
purpose  and procedure,  and the risks,  benefits  and alternatives  to participating  in the 
study.  
 
Interventions  
Explanation  for the choice  of comparators  
If a patient  chooses  to decline  treatment  with fluoxetine  but is eligible  for the 
observational  cohort,  they will be given  the necessary  study  information.  Patients  can 
choose  to provide  consent  anytime  between  approach  and discharge.  Patients  may 
revoke  their informed  consent  at any time by contacting  the research  team.  
 
 Intervention  description   
Patients  deemed  eligible  for inclusion  in the drugs  vs. placebo  or observational  cohort  
will be approached  for consent  in the inpatient  ward  as they are nearing  discharge  after 
aSAH.  After  consent  is obtained,  patients  will be randomized  to either  a placebo  or 
fluoxetine -treatment  group.  Patients  that decline  participation  in the drug vs placebo  arm 
may be enrolled  in the observational  cohort.   
 
For patients  participating  in the drug vs. placebo  cohort,  the study  drug will be provided  
at no cost for the duration  of the trial (1 year).   
 
Patients  randomized  to the fluoxetine  treatment  group  will be initially  prescribed  
fluoxetine  20mg/day.  The drug will be supplied  to patients  in 90-day supply.  For patients  
in the drug/placebo  cohort,  if severe  depression  (as defined  by a HAM -D score  of >24 or 
a PHQ -9 score  >20 or positive  endorsement  on the PHQ -9 suicide  items  2 or 3) is 
persistent  at any study  time points,  an additional  fluoxetine  dose  of 20mg/day  will be 
administered  for 40mg  total dose  for fluoxetine  group.  
 
If severe  depression  is persistent  at any study  time points  for patients  randomized  to the 
placebo  group  (as defined  above),  they will be prescribed  20 mg of fluoxetine.   
 
The research  assistant  will administer  an approximately  45-minute  interview  at up to five 
time points  to all patient -subjects:  upon  enrollment  (prior  to hospital  discharge)  as a 
baseline  assessment,  and up to four follow -up visits  within  18 months  after discharge  
from the hospital.   
 
The goal will be to do these  assessments  at the six-week,  six-month,  and one-year 
follow -up appointments,  taking  into consideration  that the actual  appointments  
frequently  do not occur  exactly  on the intended  timescale.  The trial period  will be for 12 
months  after discharge;  however,  should  we need  to speak  with patients  or if they miss 
their 12 month  appointment,  we will allow  for another  timepoint  within  18 months.   
 
 The interview  questionnaires  will assess  depression  and health -related  quality  of life, 
medication  compliance,  drug side effects  and pregnancy,  either  in person,  over the 
phone,  via email,  or mail.  If the participant  endorses  serious  side effects,  the event  will 
immediately  be reported  to and reviewed  by the study  PI for its relatedness  to the study  
and it will be reported  to IRB in accordance  with University  of Washington  IRB 
reportable  event  guidelines.  
 
Depression  will be assessed  using  the Hamilton  Rating  Scale  for Depression  (HAM -D) 
and the Patient  Health  Questionnaire  (PHQ -9). Health -related  quality  of life will be 
assessed  using  the Medical  Outcomes  Short  Form  Health  Survey  (SF-36). All measures  
will be assessed  at each  time point.   
 
For patients  reaching  the end of the study  and choosing  to discontinue  the study  drug,  
the two week  weaning  period  will begin  at the completion  of the 12-month  trial period.  
Patient  education  regarding  continuation  or discontinuation  of SSRI  treatment  at the 
completion  of the study  will be provided  90 days prior to reaching  the end of the study,  
regardless  of treatment  group.  From  time to time,  members  of the study  team  may 
contact  the patient  to ensure  medication  compliance  and answer  questions  about  
medications  and the study  the subject  may have.  
 
If any patient,  in the drug vs. placebo  demonstrates  severe  depression  (as defined  by a 
HAM -D score  of >24 or a PHQ -9 score  >20 or positive  endorsement  on the PHQ -9 
suicide  items  2 or 3) is persistent  at any study  time points,  patient  will be immediately  
directed  to their physician  for further  evaluation.  If a patient  endorses  suicidal  ideation,  
they will be immediately  referred  to the psychiatric  service  for further  urgent  mental  
health  evaluation  before  a dosage  increase  is considered.  If a patient  is removed  from 
the study,  that data will be included  in the subsequent  data analysis.    
 
After  a final timepoint  at approximately  1 year after hospitalization  (but up to 18 
months),  the subjects’  study  enrollment  will be complete.  
 
 Criteria  for discontinuing  or modifying  allocated  interventions  
Patients  may be withdrawn  from the research  without  their consent  if the patient  is no 
longer  able to participate  in the research  protocol.  In any case  that a patient -subject  will 
be discontinuing  the drug,  we will taper  over two weeks,  halving  the dose  each  week.  
 
Outcom e Measures  
• For all subjects  enrolled  in the study,  relevant  clinical  and demographic  data,

based  on the PHQ9  score.    
• The Short  Form  (36) Health  Survey  (SF-36): 36-item questionnaire  to assess  
health -related  quality -of-life.  
• Barthel  Index:  Scale  used  to determine  functional  status,  measuring  performance  
in activities  of daily living.    
• Hamilton  Anxiety  Rating  Scale:  Measures  the severity  of anxiety  through  looking  
at both psychic  and somatic  anxiety.    
• Multidimensional  Scale  of Perceived  Social  Support:  Scale  to determine  a 
patients  social  support  system   
• PROMIS:  Sleep  disturbance  scale  assess  pure domain  of sleep  disturbance   
• Health  Care  Utilization:  Assess  ER visits,  outpatient  visits,  rehospitalization  and 
mortality   
• Fatigue  Severity  Scale:  Measures  the severity  of fatigue  and its effect  on a 
person’s  activities  and lifestyle  in patients  exhibiting  depression    
 
Participant  timeline   
  
The research  assistant  will administer  an approximately  45-minute  interview  at up to five 
time points  to all patient -subjects:  upon  enrollment  (prior  to hospital  discharge)  as a 
baseline  assessment,  and at up to four follow -up visits  within  18 months  after discharge  
from the hospital.   
 
The goal will be to do these  assessments  at the six-week,  six-month,  and one-year 
follow -up appointments,  taking  into consideration  that the actual  appointments  
frequently  do not occur  exactly  on the intended  timescale.  The trial period  will be for 12 
months  after discharge;  however,  should  we need  to speak  with patients  or if they miss 
their 12 month  appointment,  we will allow  for another  timepoint  within  18 months.  
 
For patients  reaching  the end of the study  and choosing  to discontinue  the study  drug,  
the two week  weaning  period  will begin  at the completion  of the 12-month  trial period.  
Patient  education  regarding  continuation  or discontinuation  of SSRI  treatment  at the 
completion  of the study  will be provided  90 days prior to reaching  the end of the study,  
regardless  of treatment  group.  From  time to time,  members  of the study  team  may 
contact  the patient  to ensure  medication  compliance  and answer  questions  about  
medications  and the study  the subject  may have.  
 
Sample  size  
Based  upon  previous  studies  we anticipate  the rate of depression  in the treatment  group  
to be 7.3%  and the rate of depression  in the placebo  group  to be 21.2%,  as determined  
by the HAM -D score.  It is estimated  that 200 patients  are eligible  per year,  however  we 
have  conservatively  estimated  enrolling  20 patients  to account  for recruitment  and 
retention  rates.  Power  calculations  show  a large -scale  trial would  require  224 total 
patients.  We anticipate  analysis  at 1-year (as funded  from this proposal)  will 
demonstrate  the feasibility  of both the randomized  administration  of antidepressant  
medication  to the post-SAH population,  as well as prospectively  define  the rate of new 
depression  and the effect  of SAH on health -related  quality  of life. 
 
 Recruitment   
Patients  will be recruited  and screened  for participation  by a member  of the research  
team  prior to discharge.  Patient  inclusion  and exclusion  will be determined  by the 
medical  record  as well as in-person  by the provider.  The Montreal  Cognitive  
Assessment  will be administered  prior to the consent  to determine  baseline  cognitive  
state.  We will also conduct  screening  to determine  if the patient  is currently  recieveing  
therapy  for depression  or related  mental  health  diagnoses.  Any recruiter  who 
administers  the MoCA  completes  MoCA  training  and certification.  Patients  scoring  >20 
on the MoCA  are considered  of appropriate  cognitive  function  to participate  in the study.   
  
Patients  recruited  for the drug vs placebo  cohort  will be provided  with a detailed  
explanation  regarding  the study  protocol,  occurrence  of depression  in aneurysmal  
subarachnoid  hemorrhage  and the potential  treatment  effects  of fluoxetine.  Patients  will 
have  an opportunity  for questions  befor  providing  before  consent.  Decisional  capacity 
will be determined  by having  participants  confirm  their understanding  of the study  
purpose  and procedure,  and the risks,  benefits  and alternatives  to participating  in the 
study.   
  
Relevant  clinical  and demographic  data such  as name,  date of birth,  dates  related  to 
hospital  stay,  medical  record  number,  area of the ruptured  aneurysm,  Glasgow  Coma  
Score,  Fisher  Grade,  Hunt  and Hess  Grade,  Medications,  medical  history,  and 
comorbidity  which  will be maintained  in a secure  screening  and recruitment  log. Patients  
can choose  to provide  consent  anytime  between  approach  and discharge.  Patients  may 
revoke  their informed  consent  at any time by contacting  the research  team.  
 
 
Assignment  of interventions:  allocation  
Sequence  generation   
Simple  randomization  schemes  will be utilized  for the drug cohort  and placebo  cohort.  
For each  cohort,  subjects  will be randomized  in a 1 to 1 ratio to receive  either  the SSRI  
antidepressant  or placebo  drugs.  Randomization  will be done  after the participant  or 
 LAR as signed  the ICF. Randomization  will be performed  by the study  pharmacist.  
Study  team,  study  assessor,  study  investigator  is blinded  until the subject  exits the 
study,  need  to unblind  for medical  intervention,  or end of the study.   
 
 
Assignment  of interventions:  Blinding  
Who  will be blinded  
Trial participants,  care providers , outcome  assessors  will stay blinded.  Placebo  vs study  
drug will be prepared  and dispensed  by local study  pharmacist . Only the study  
pharmacy  will know  the designation  of each  participant  until the clinical  team  request  
the information  for health  care purposes  or when  the participants  exit the study.   
 
Procedure  for unblinding  if needed  
If an adverse  event  occurs  in which  the disclosure  of the treatment  arm is necessary  for 
medical  treatment,  the disclosure  will be provided  to the patient  and/or  provider.

Confidentiality  and Data  management   
All research  data will be deidentified . A single -master  key will be retained.  All data will 
be stored  on a secure  research  database  or in a secure  cabinet  on a secure  floor.  
Access  to identifiers  will be limited  to the study  team.  Data  will be classified  as Level  4 
risk. U1-U13,  D1-D9 will apply  to all data.  S1-S20 will be utilized;  local procedures  will 
be utilized  in addition  to the protections  afforded  by utilizing  the UW OneDrive.  P1-P3 
will be utilized  for non-digital  records.  T1-T8 will be utilized  for data transmission.  We do 
not intend  to utilize  vendors,  but if vendors  are utilized  we will adhere  to V1. 
 
Statistical  methods  
Statistical  methods  for primary  and secondary  outcomes   
In addition  to patient -level measures,  relevant  clinical  and demographic  data will be 
 obtained  for the descriptive  statistics  of the cohort.  For each  time point  we will 
determine  the rate and severity  of the outcome  measures.  We will utilize  linear  mixed  
models  to determine  to determine  the treatment  effect  of preventative  fluoxetine  
administration  in patients  surviving  subarachnoid  hemorrhage.  Important  confounders  
will be determined  and adjusted  for in the analysis.  The primary  outcome  will be 
analyzed  at the one-year time point.  The intermediate  time points  will be obtained  to 
determine  the longitudinal  progression  of the mental  health  status  and functional  ability  
in this patient  population.  
 
Oversight  and monitoring  
Composition  of the coordinating  centre  and trial steering  committee  
The PI (or approved  co-investigator)  will monitor  the study  with prompt  reporting  of 
adverse  events  and other  study  related  information  to the IRB and other  agencies  as 
appropriate.  Non-serious  adverse  events  and unrelated  serious  adverse  events  will be 
reported  in the annual  progress  report.  Serious  adverse  events  that could  be related  to

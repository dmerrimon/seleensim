 1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEMA  
This is a single -center, open -label trial. Ninety -two adult patients undergoing first allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) at Me morial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
(MSK) for hematologic malignancies or myeloproliferative disorders will receive isavuconazole 
(Cresemba) (ISA) as antifungal prophylaxis. Isavuconazole prophylaxis will start on Day (D) +7 
(+/-2 days) after stem cell in fusion. A window of + /- 2 days is allowed to ensure that recipients 
of conventional transplants achieve steady levels of calcineurin inhibitors  prior to starting 
isavuconazole. R ecipients of T-cell depleted  (by CD34+ selection)  HCT that do not receive 
exogenous im munosuppression may start as early as Day  +5.   
Patients that meet all eligibility criteria but have a contraindication to starting isavuconazole on 
day +9 may be permitted to start isavuconazole later than day +9 after review and approval by 
the PI/co -PIs. The reason for starting after day + 9 will be documented in the chart and the CRF.  
The maximum duration of isavuconazole prophylaxis will be through  D +98  (week 14 ) post 
transplant. Patients of conventional peripheral blood or marrow HCT in t he absence of graft 
versus host disease (GVHD) may stop isavucona zole prophylaxis as early as D  +60 or between 
D +60 and D  +98 at the discretion of the primary physician . Patients at high risk for invasive 
mold infection  (IMI) including cord blood HCT reci pients, and recipients of CD34+ selected 
HCT, patients with GVHD, CMV infection, and those requiring growth factors to sustain 
adequate neutrophil count will continue isavuconazole through Day +98.  
Patient s who  develop a suspected or proven fungal infection on  isavuconazole  prophylaxis, will 
discontinu e isavuconazole  and will be treated per standard of care (SOC) at MSK (Appendix 1).  
If the diagnosis of fungal infection is not confirmed and prophylaxis is inter rupted for ≤ 14 days, 
the patient may resume prophylaxis with isavuconazole.  If systemic antifungal therapy is 
required for >14 days, prophylaxis with isavuconazole will be permanently discontinued.   
All patients will be followed  through week 26 (day +18 2) post transplant for survival and 
occurrence of fungal infection, if applicable.  A schema of the study design is  shown below:

  To evaluate the clinical failure rate   by week +14 post HCT of isavuconazole  
prophylaxis per protocol . Clinical failure is defined as:  
1) Systemic antifungal therapy for > 14 consecutive days for suspected fungal infection  
up to week 14.  
2) Breakthrough proven or probable fungal infection during the prophylaxis phase. The 
prophylaxis phase is defined as the period from  the first dose of isavuconazole 
through 7  days after discontinuation  (Definitions for proven or probable fungal 
infections are provided in Appendix 1) . 
3) Toxicity leading to permanent discontinuation of prophylaxis  
4) Adverse event requiring discontinuation.  
Secondary  
1. Assess serum levels of isavuconazole in patients with grade ≥2 acute graft versus host 
disease (GVHD) of the gastrointestinal tract.  
2. Estimate the incidence of probable or proven breakthrough invasive fungal infections 
(IFIs) with isavuconazole prophylaxis at end of study ( week 26).  
3. Describe reasons for discontinuat ion of prophylaxis of isavuconazole.  The number and 
type of adverse events (AE) leading to discontinuation of isavuconazole will be reported. 
The severity grade and relationship of the AE to isavuconazole will be captured.   
4. Estimate overall survival at week 26.  
3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
HCT is associated with a high risk of invasive fungal infection due to Candida  and Aspergillus  
species. The risk of infection is associated with the degree and duration of neutropenia, the 
disruption of protective skin and mucosal surface barriers and the use of cort icosteroids. 
Fluconazole is the only antifungal approved in the USA for chemoprophy laxis during HCT. In 
the 2 largest trials in HCT, fluconazole prophylaxis was associated with a significant reduction in 
the frequency of invasive candidiasis compared with placebo in randomized trials. While 
fluconazole has been widely used as antifungal prophylaxis it does not provide coverage against 
Aspergillus .    
Voriconazole, a broad spectrum azole active against Candida  and Aspergillus  species, has been 
increasingly used for antifungal prophylaxis for high risk HCT such as cord blood HCT and ex 
vivo T-cell depleted HCT recipients.  In a randomized trial of voriconazole versus fluconazole 
prophylaxis in standard risk HCT recipients, the overall rates of fungal infections and fungal free 
survival at 6 and 12 months were similar in the two arms. Notably , there was a significant 
decrease in infections caused by Aspergillus  in the voriconazole arm at 6 months.    
Voriconazole is extensively metabolized by the liver. Cytochrome CYP2C19, the major enzyme 
responsible for voriconazole metabolism, exhibits gene tic polymorphisms which result in Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 variability of voriconazole metabolism and exposure. In clinical trials of voriconazole for the 
treatment of invasive aspergillosis, transaminase elevations were observed in up to 19% of 
patients with 4% being serious hepa tic adverse events. In an observational study of patients with 
hematologic malignancies, up to 69% of patients developed transaminase elevations. However, 
only 7% of patients were thought to have clinically significant hepatotoxicity (HT) and required 
discontinuation of voriconazole.   
In a retrospective study from Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) of 200 HCT recipients who 
received voriconazole prophylaxis during 2005 -07, 34% developed hepatotoxicity on 
voriconazole. The median duration of voriconazole admini stration was 72 days (range: 1 –804 
days). Biochemical hepatotoxicity occurred in 75% of patients and clinical hepatotoxicity in 25% 
of patients  (Amigues et al. 2010) . Voriconazole was discontinued in approximately half of all 
patients with hepatotoxicity. In a more recent study from MSK, approximately 10% of HCT 
required alternative antifungal prophylaxis with IV micafungin due to intolerance, toxicity or 
drug interaction with voriconazole or posaconazole  (Neofytos D et al, 2015) .     
In summary, voriconazo le is an attractive agent for prophylaxis because of its broad spectrum 
covering Candida and Aspergillus sp ecies  However, drug - drug interactions, pharmacokinetic 
variability, short -term acute toxicities (including photopsia, visual hallucinations, and 
abnormalities in liver function) and long -term toxicities (such as skin carcinogenesis and 
fluorosis) concerns about β -cyclodextrin administration in the setting of impaired renal function, 
and recommendations for therapeutic drug monitoring limit the broad a pplicability of 
voriconazole in high risk patients.    
Isavuconazonium sulfate (Isavuconazole, Cresemba ®) is a broad -spectrum triazole that has 
demonstrated potent activity in animal models of invasive aspergillosis, mucormycosis and 
invasive candidiasis.  Isavuconazole was approved in 2015 by the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and invasive mucormycosis. 
The water -soluble prodrug isavuconazonium sulfate was developed to facilitate intravenous 
administration  without the need for potentially nephrotoxic excipients such as β -cyclodextrin. 
Isavuconazole displays excellent bioavailability (roughly 98%) after oral administration without 
any clinically relevant food effects  (Miceli MH et al, 2015) .   
In a large ran domized study of isavuconazole versus voriconazole for treatment of invasive 
aspergillosis and other filamentous fungi (SECURE) , isavuconazole  was non  inferior to 
voriconazole in fungal free survival and overall responses.  The most important differentiati ng 
feature between isavuconazole and voriconazole in the SECURE study was the tolerability and 
safety profile of isavuconazole, which could allow safer therapy  (Maertens JA  et al, 2016) .  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 17-112 A(5) 
Approval date: 02-Oct-2018

 Voriconazole therapy is characterized by a narrow therapeutic window  and an established 
association between elevated concentrations and neurotoxic , hepatic , and visual adverse events. 
These adverse events, although usually reversible, often lead to premature discontinuation of the 
drug. Of the drug -related hepatobiliary ad verse events reported in the study, 10% were noted in 
the voriconazole group compared with 2% in the isavuconazole group. Furthermore, key adverse 
events known to be related to voriconazole (including eye, hepatic, and skin disorders) and 
discontinuations due to adverse events were significantly less common among isavuconazole 
treated patients. Given the double -blind nature of the study, this suggests a true difference in the 
safety features of the two azoles.    
There is limited data on the use of isavuconazole as prophylaxis. In an open -label, multi -center 
dose escalation study of isavuconazole for antifungal prophylaxis in neutropenic patients who 
had undergone chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) of th e 20 twenty subjects who 
completed the study, 18 were classified as treatment success. The mean plasma of isavuconazole 
AUC -24 for the dosing period on day 7 were 60.1 ug·h/ml in low -dose cohort and 113.1 ug·h/ml 
in high -dose cohort. Most  of the adverse ev ents were mild -moderate in severity and most 
common were rash and headache  (Cornely OA , 2015) . Based on this limited data, the safety and 
tolerability profile of isavuconazole support  isavuconazole prophylaxis in neutropenic patients 
with AML with 200 mg a nd 400 mg  once -daily maintenance regimens.   
We propose a study to evaluate the safety , tolerability and effectiveness of isavuconazole 
prophylaxis in HCT recipients.  
4.0 OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
4.1 Design  
This is a single center, open -label, single arm study of isavuco nazole prophylaxis for the 
prevention of fungal infections in recipients of allogeneic HCT.   
Informed consent will be obtained in the outpatient clinic or during inpatient admission for 
transplant. Informed consent m ust be dated ≤  30 days from first dose of ISA.  
Per MSK‟s standard of care (SOC) , HCT recipients receive antifungal prophylaxis with 
micafungin 150mg IV q24 hours from the day of admission for HCT until Day +7. On Day +7 
(+/- 2 days ) micafungin  will be discontinued and  the patien t will start isavuconazole prop hylaxis. 
Patients must start isavuconazole prophylaxis between D  +5 and D  +9.  
Patients that meet all eligibility criteria but have a contraindication to starting isavuconazole on 
day +9 may be permitted to start isavuconazole later than day +9 after review and approval by 
the PI/co -PIs. The reason for starting after day + 9 will be documented in the chart and the CRF.  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 17-112 A(5) 
Approval date: 02-Oct-2018

Duration of prophylaxis: The duration o f prophylaxis will be determine d by the patient‟s risk for 
fungal infection determined by the treating physician. Recipients of conventional peripheral 
blood or marrow allografts may stop as early as Day +60 in the absence of GVHD. Patients at 
high risk for fungal infection including re cipients of cord blood HCT, patients with  graft versus 
host disease (GVHD), or with CMV infection, or cytopeni c patients  requiring growth factor 
support to  sustain adequate  neutrophil count , will continue antifungal prophylaxis through Day  
+98 (week 14)  post transplant . The maximum duration of isavuconazole prophylaxis will be 
through  D +98 ( week 14 ). In the event of suspected fungal infection isavuconazole prophylaxis 
will be held and the patient will receive empiric antifungal therapy per SOC at MSK. If the 
diagnosis of fungal infection is  not confirme d and the patient has received ≤ 14 days of systemic 
antifungal therapy, isavuconazole prophylaxis may be resumed.  If the fungal infection is 
confirmed or the patient receives more  than 14  days of systemic a ntifungals, isavuconazole 
prophylaxis will be permanently discontinued.  
Inter ruption of isavuconazole for 14 days or less is permitted for evaluation of possible toxicity. 
If the toxicity is not deemed to be related to isavuconazole the prophylaxis may be  resumed.  
Any fungal infection occurring during prophylaxis will be classified according to EORTC/MSG 
definitions (Appendix 1).  
Patients will be followed through week 26 post HCT for overall survival, and occurrence of 
fungal infection.  
4.2 Intervention  
Intravenous or oral: Isavuconazonium sulfate 372 mg Q 8hour for 6 doses as loading dose, 
followed by 372 mg Q day as maintenance dose.  
Patients who are unable to tolerate oral medications due to mucositis will start isavuconazole 
intravenously and will  have their dose  switched to oral formulation when able to tolerate oral 
medications at the discretion of the clinician. Switching from oral to intravenous formulation of 
the assigned prophylaxis is acceptable if patients are unable t o tolerate oral medica tion or there is 
concern for absorption. The bioequivalence has been demonstrated between oral and intravenous 
formulation. The l oading dose is not required when switching between formulations.  
The minimum duration of prophylaxis with isavuconazole will be  through D  +60. Beyond day 
+60 discontinuation is at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients at high risk for fungal 
infection such as recipients of cord blood allografts,  CD34+ selected allografts, neutropenia 
requiring growth factors, on immun osuppressants for treatment of GVHD, or other reasons and 
CMV infection will continue prophylaxis with isavuconazole through day +98.  The maximum 
duration of prophylaxis with isavuconazole on protocol will be through D +98 (week 14).

 5.0 THERAPEUTIC /DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS  
Isavuconazole  
Overview  
Isavuconazonium sulfate (CRESEMBA ® Astellas Pharma US, Inc. Northbrook, IL) is 
an azole antifungal indicated for patients 18 years of age and older for use in the 
treatment of invasive aspergillosis and invasive mucormycosis. Isavuconazonium sulfate 
is a water soluble prodrug that is rapidly hydrolyzed in blood by esterases to the active 
moiety, isavuconazole. Isavuconazonium sulfate capsules contain 186 mg of 
isavuconazonium sulfate (1 capsule) equivalent to 100 mg of isavuconazole. 
Isavuconazonium sulfate for injection contains 372 mg of isavuconazonium sulfate (1  
vial) equivalent to 200 mg of isavuconazole.  
Mechanism of Action  
Isavuconazole inhibits the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell 
membrane, through the inhibition of cytochrome P -450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14 -
alpha -demethylase. This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to 
ergosterol. An accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol 
within the fungal cell membrane weakens the membrane structure and function.  
 
Activity in vitro and in clinical infections  
Isavuconazole has activity against most strai ns of the following microorganisms, both in 
vitro and in clinical infections: Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus 
niger, and Mucorales such as Rhizopus oryzae and Mucormycetes  species.  
 
In vitro and animal studies suggest cross -resistance between isavuconazole and other 
azoles. The relevance of cross -resistance to clinical outcome has not been fully 
characterized.  
 
General Pharmacokinetics  
In healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole following oral administrat ion 
of CRESEMBA capsules at isavuconazole equivalent doses up to 600 mg per day (6 
capsules) are dose proportional (Table 1). Based on a population pharmacokinetics 
analysis of healthy subjects and patients, the mean plasma half -life of isavuconazole was 
130 hours and the mean volume of distribution (Vss) was approximately 450 L following 
intravenous administration.

a Each capsule contains the equivalent of 100 mg of isavuconazole.  
 
Absorption  
 
After oral administration of isavuconazole in healthy volunteers, the active moiety, 
isavuconazole, generally reaches maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) 2 hours to 3 
hours after single and multiple dosing. The absolute bioavailability of isavuconazole 
following oral administration of CRESEMBA is 98%. No significant concentrations of 
the prodrug or inactive cleavage product were seen in plasma after oral administration. 
Following i ntravenous administration of CRESEMBA, maximal plasma concentrations 
of the prodrug and inactive cleavage product were detectable during infusion and 
declined rapidly following the end of administration. The prodrug was below the level of 
detection by 1.25  hours after the start of a 1 hour infusion. The total exposure of the 
prodrug based on AUC was less than 1% that of isavuconazole. The inactive cleavage 
product was quantifiable in some subjects up to 8 hours after the start of infusion. The 
total exposur e of inactive cleavage product based on AUC was approximately 1.3% that 
of isavuconazole.  
 
Effect of Food  
 
Coadministration of CRESEMBA equivalent to isavuconazole 400 mg oral dose with a 
high-fat meal reduced isavuconazole Cmax by 9% and increased AUC by 9%. 
CRESEMBA can be taken with or without food.  
 
Distribution  
 
Isavuconazole is extensively distributed with a mean steady state volume of distribution 
(Vss) of approximately 450 L. Isavuconazole is highly protein bound (greater than 99%), 
predominantly to  albumin.  
 
Metabolism  
 
In vitro  studies show that isavuconazonium sulfate is rapidly hydrolyzed in blood to 
isavuconazole by esterases, predominately by butylcholinesterase. Isavuconazole is a Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 substrate of cytochrome P450 enzymes 3A4 and 3A5. Following sin gle doses of [cyano 
14C] isavuconazonium and [pyridinylmethyl 14C] isavuconazonium in humans, in 
addition to the active moiety (isavuconazole) and the inactive cleavage product, a number 
of minor metabolites were identified. Except for the active moiety is avuconazole, no 
individual metabolite was observed with an AUC greater than 10% of drug related 
material. In vivo studies indicate that CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and subsequently uridine 
diphosphate -glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) are involved in the metabolism of 
isavuconazole.  
 
Excretion  
 
Following oral administration of radio -labeled isavuconazonium sulfate to healthy 
volunteers, a mean of 46.1% of the total radioactive dose was recovered in the feces and 
45.5% was recovered in the urine.  
 
Renal excretion of isavuconazole itself was less than 1% of the dose administered. The 
inactive cleavage product is primarily eliminated by metabolism and subsequent renal 
excretion of the metabolites.  
 
Renal elimination of intact cleavage product was less than 1% of the total dose 
administered. Following intravenous administration of radio -labeled cleavage product, 
95% of the total radioactive dose was excreted in the urine.  
 
Special populations  
Renal Impairment  
Total isavuconazole AUC and Cmax were not affected to a clin ically meaningful extent 
in subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment relative to healthy controls. 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. Isavuconazole is not 
readily dialyzable. A dose adjustment is not warrante d in patients with ESRD.  
 
Hepatic Impairment  
After a single dose of CRESEMBA equivalent to 100 mg of isavuconazole was 
administered to 32 patients with mild  (Child -Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment and 32 
patients with moderate (Child -Pugh Class B) hepatic  impairment  (16 intravenous and 16 
oral patients per Child -Pugh Class), the least squares mean systemic exposure (AUC) 
increased  64% and 84% in the Child -Pugh Class A group and the Child -Pugh Class B 
group, respectively, relative to 32 age and  weight -match ed healthy subjects with normal 
hepatic function. Mean Cmax was 2% lower in the Child -Pugh Class A group  and 30% 
lower in the Child -Pugh Class B group. The population pharmacokinetic evaluation of 
isavuconazole in healthy subjects and patients with mild an d moderate hepatic 
impairment demonstrated that the mild and moderate hepatic impairment population had 
40% and 48% lower isavuconazole clearance (CL) values, respectively, compared to the 
healthy population. It is recommended that the standard CRESEMBA lo ading dose and 
maintenance dose regimen be utilized in patients with mild to moderate hepatic disease. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 CRESEMBA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child -
Pugh Class C).  
 
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Relationship  
 
In patients  treated with CRESEMBA for invasive aspergillosis in a controlled trial, there 
was no significant association between plasma AUC or plasma isavuconazole 
concentration and efficacy.  
 
Cardiac Electrophysiology  
 
The effect on QTc interval of multiple doses of  CRESEMBA capsules was evaluated. 
CRESEMBA was administered as 2 capsules (equivalent to 200 mg isavuconazole) three 
times daily on days 1 and 2 followed by either 2 capsules or 6 capsules (equivalent to 600 
mg isavuconazole) once daily for 13 days in a ra ndomized, placebo - and active -
controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg single dose), four -treatment -arm, parallel study in 160 
healthy subjects.  
 
Isavuconazole resulted in dose -related shortening of the QTc interval. For the 2 -capsule 
dosing regimen, the least squa res mean (LSM) difference from placebo was -13.1 msec at 
2 hours postdose [90% CI: -17.1, -9.1 msec]. Increasing the dose to 6 capsules resulted in 
an LSM difference from placebo of -24.6 msec at 2 hours postdose [90% CI: -28.7, -
20.4].  
CRESEMBA was not evaluated in combination with other drugs that reduce the QTc 
interval, so the additive effects are not known.

 The most frequent adverse reactions observed in  the pivotal trial  of isavuconazole  
compared to  voriconazole  were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, elevated liver 
chemistry tests, hypokalemia, constipation, dyspnea, cough, peripheral edema, and back 
pain (refer to  supplemental table for  treatment -emerging adverse events occurring in  ≥ 
5% of population in the Pivotal study by Maertens JA  et al) .  
 
Table 3 shows a comparison of treatment emerging adverse effect s in the isavuconazole 
and voriconazole arms  from the pivotal trial of isavuconazole versus voriconazole for the 
treatment of invasive aspergillosis ( Maertens JA  et al) . 
 
The most important differentiating feature between isavuconazol e and vor iconazole  was 
the tolerability and safety profile of isavuconazole, which could allow safer therapy. 
Voriconazole therapy is characteriz ed by a narrow therapeutic window and an established 
association between elevated concentrations and neurotoxic,  hepatic, and visual adverse 
events.  These adverse events, although usually reversible, often lead to premature 
discontinuation of the drug. Of the drug -related hepatobiliar y adverse events reported in 
the pivotal  study, 26 (10%) were noted in the voriconazole group compared w ith five 
(2%) in the isavuconazole group. In the same  study, key adverse events known to be 
related to voriconazole (including eye, hepatic, and skin disorders) and discontinuations 
due to adverse events were significantly less common among isavuconazole -treated 
patients. Given the double -blind nature of the study, this suggests a true difference in the 
safety features of the two azoles. Whether the higher proportion of adverse events with 
voriconazole was due to supratherapeutic drug exposure  of isavuconaz ole cannot be 
excluded without therapeutic drug monitoring; however, the effect of therapeutic drug 
monitoring on the incidence of these adverse events remains speculative.

The safety and p harma cokinetics of Isavuconazole as antifungal p rophylaxis in  acute myeloid 
leukemia patients with n eutropenia  was evaluated in a  Phase 2, Dose Escalation Study  (Cornely 
OA et al). In this small study comprising of a total of 23 patients, 12 patients were allocated to 
the “high dose” arm, which is equivalent of the cu rrently approved dose of isavuconazole. A 
total of 77 TEAEs were reported for 10 (90.9%) patients in the low -dose cohort compared with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 120 TEAEs in 12 (100%) patients in the high -dose cohort. The most commonly reported TEAEs 
were fever ( n = 6 [54.5%]), dia rrhea ( n = 4 [36.4%]), and rash ( n = 4 [36.4%]) in the low -dose 
cohort, compared with fever ( n = 12 [100%]) and nausea ( n = 8 [66.7%]) in the high -dose cohort. 
The majority of the TEAEs reported in both cohorts were of mild -to-moderate intensity ( Table 
4). One SAE was reported, a case of life -threatening respiratory distress in a patient in the high -
dose cohort, which was not considered to be attributable to the study med ication.

Hepatic  
Hepatic adverse drug reactions (e.g., elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin) have been reported in clinical 
trials. The elevations in liver -related laboratory tests were generally reversible and did not require 
discontinuation of CRESEMBA. Cases of more severe hepatic adverse drug react ions including 
hepatitis, cholestasis or hepatic failure including death have been reported in patients with serious 
underlying medical conditions (e.g., hematologic malignancy) during treatment with azole 
antifungal agents, including CRESEMBA.

 therapy for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Discontinue CRESEMBA if cl inical 
signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to 
CRESEMBA  
 
Infusion -Related Reactions  
Infusion -related reactions including hypotension, dyspnea, chills, dizziness, paresthesia, and 
hypoesthesia were reported duri ng intravenous administration of CRESEMBA. Discontinue the 
infusion if these reactions occur  
 
Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Serious hypersensitivity and severe skin reactions, such as anaphylaxis or Stevens Johnson 
syndrome, have been reported during treatme nt with other azole antifungal agents. Discontinue 
CRESEMBA if a patient develops a severe cutaneous adverse reaction. There is no information 
regarding cross -sensitivity between CRESEMBA and other azole antifungal agents. Caution 
should be used when presc ribing CRESEMBA to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles.  
 
Drug Interactions  
Coadministration of CRESEMBA with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or high -
dose ritonavir and strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin, carbamazepine, St. Joh n‟s wort, or 
long acting barbiturates is contraindicated. A list of CYP3A4 inducers is listed in Appendix 2. 
Under drugs that concentration is affected by voriconazole.  
 
The most common CYP3A4 Inhibitors used in HCT recipients include the immunosuppressants 
Sirolimus , Cyclosporine  and Tacrolimus. In the Lexicomp the degree of interaction of 
isavuconazole for these immunosuppressants is C: “monitor therapy”.  
(http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/interact).  
Other C3A4 inhibitors that may be used in HCT recipients include Benzodiazepines, HMG -CoA 
Reductase Inhibitors (Statins), Dihy dropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers, Oral 
Contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone, Omeprazole , Methadone, Fentanyl 
and Oxycodone. The degree of intera ction of isavuconazole with the above listed medications is 
variable. Alternatives are available where modification of therapy is recommended.

7.0 RECRUITMENT PLAN  
Candidates for the study will be identified at the BMT service  weekly scheduling meeting.  
Potential research subjects will be identified by a member of the patient‟s treatment team, the protocol 
investigator, or research team at Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). If the investigator 
is a member of the treatment team, s/he will screen their patient‟s medical records f or suitable research 
study  participants and discuss the study and their potential for enrolling in the research study. Potential 
subjects  contacted by their treating physician will be referred to the investigator/research staff of the 
study . Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 17-112 A(5) 
Approval date: 02-Oct-2018 
 
 
 
Page 19 of 32 
 
  
The principal  investigator may also screen the medical records of patients with whom they do not have a  
treatment relationship for the limited purpose of identifying patients who would be eligible to enroll in the  
study and to record appropriate contact information in order to approach these patients regarding the  
possibility of enrolling in the study.  
 
During the initial conversation between the investigator/research staff and the patient, the patient may be  
asked to provide certain health information that is necessary  to the recruitment and enrollment process.  
The investigator/research staff may also review portions of their medical records at MSKCC in order to  
further assess eligibility. They will use the information provided by the patient and/or medical record to  
confirm that the patient is eligible and to contact the patient regarding study enrollment. If the patient  
turns out to be ineligible for the research study, the research staff will destroy all information collected on  
the patient during the initial conversa tion and medical records review, except for any information that  
must be maintained for screening log purposes.  
 
In most cases, the initial contact with the prospective subject will be conducted either by the treatment  
team, investigator or the research st aff working in consultation with the treatment team. The recruitment  
process outlined presents no more than minimal risk to the privacy of the patients who are screened and  
minimal PHI will be maintained as part of a screening log. For these reasons, we se ek a (partial) limited  
waiver of authorization for the purposes of (1) reviewing medical records to identify potential research  
subjects and obtain information relevant to the enrollment process; (2) conversing with patients regarding  
possible enrollment; (3) handling of PHI contained within those records and provided by the potential  
subjects; and (4) maintaining information in a screening log of patients approached (if applicable).  
 
Approximately 12 patients per month are admitted for allogeneic HCT. We e stimate to accrue 
approximately 4 patients per month  to complete accrual of 100 subjects in 24 months  and follow up by 36 
months.   
All eligible patients will be approached for participation in the study. Patients will not be paid for 
participation in the study. All visits for the study will occur during visits for routine clinical care.   
No travel reimbursement will be provided for s tudy visits.

gSAE occurring up to 30  days after termination of isavuconazole will be reported (section 17,2).  
h If patient discontinues ISA  prophylaxis prior to week 14 , the post treatment schedule will be followed. End of 
treatment assessment to be conducted when the patient permanently discontinues ISA prophylaxis.  
9.0 TREATMENT/ INTERVENTION  PLAN  
After signing informed consent p atients will be registered by the Office  of Clinical Research Protocol 
Participant R egistration (CRPPR) through the Clinical Research Database .  
Per MSK SOC patients will  receive micafungin 150mg intravenously every 24 hours starting on the day 
of admission for HCT .  Micafungin will be  diluted  in 100 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride. The solution  will 
be kept at room temperature and protected from light. The entire infusion solution  will be  infused over 1 
hour within 24 hours of reconstitution. The tubing will get  flushed at the end of the infusion to secure the 
entire dose of drug was infused.  
 
Isavuconazole (isavuconazonium sulfate)  372 mg Q8hr for 6 doses as loa ding dose, followed by 372 mg 
QD as maintenance dose will  start as described on Day +7 (+/ -2 days). Isavuconazole may be 
administered intravenously until patients are able to receive oral medications at the discretion of the 
treating physician.  
 
Patients that meet all eligibility criteria but have a contraindication to starting isavuconazole on 
day +9 may be permitted to start isavuconazole later than day +9 after review and approval by 
the PI/co -PIs. The reason for starting after day + 9 will be documented in the chart and the CRF.  
 
If the patient develops clinically suspected or documented fungal infection isavuconazole will be 
discontinued and the patient will start anti fungal therapy per SOC . Work up to establish diagnosis of 
fungal infection  will be done by the treating physician as indicated . If the diagnosis of fungal infection is 
not confirmed and ISA has been interrupted for ≤14 days, patients may resume ISA prophylaxis.

 During admission for transplant the patients will be monitored as inpatients. After discharge the patients 
will be monitored at the outpatients BMT  clinic at l east weekly through d +60,  once every 2 weeks 
through d +98 and once at least every 4 weeks through week 26 .    Blood chemistry and comprehensive 
metabolic profile  including ALT, AST, Alk Phos and total bilirubin will be assessed during study visits. 
GVHD grading will be done per SOC. Treatment for GVHD will be captured.  
 
All outlined study procedures are performed during clinic visits for routine post transplant c are.  
 
A serum level of isavuconazole will be performed once when patients have been on a steady oral dose of 
isavuconazole for 10 -14 days .  
 
In addition the subgroup of p atients with GVHD  grade ≥2 of the gastrointestinal system (GI)  will have 
serum level of isavuconazole at diagnosis of GVHD and 2 weeks after  starting treatment for  GVHD.  
 
Follow up will take place in the hospital if patients are hospitalized and at the BMT clinic during 
routine clinic visits when pts are outpatients.  
 
10.0  EVALUATION DURING TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
Study day 1  [First day of dosing (FDD)] through week 14  post-HCT .  
 
The following assessments will be performed twice  per week on two non -consecutive days, preferably 
three days apart (e.g., Mondays and Thursdays) from study Day 1 through week 3, weekly from week 4-8, 
every 2 weeks from week 9-14.  
A table of study procedures and asse ssments is provided in section 8.0. 
The following will occur during the visit.  
 
1. Review of  medications performed by BMT pharmacists (through week 14  or 
discontinuation of prophylaxis)  
 
2. Vital signs: body temperature, blood pressure , body weight, and pulse rate. Interim 
history and directed physical exam. The physical exam should focus on organs systems 
that are clinically relevant in the setting of invasive fungal infections.  
3. Review of any a dverse event s.  Only those events which are deemed to be at least possibly related 
to isavuconazole will be graded and attributed.   
4. Blood tests  
 Hematology: complete blood count with  differential and platelet count  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 17-112 A(5) 
Approval date: 02-Oct-2018 
 
 
 
Page 24 of 32 
 
  Serum chemistry: creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total 
bilirubin, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, an d albumin  
5. If the patient is diagnosed with a fungal infection or  a fungal infection  is suspected , 
isavuconazole  will be held and empiric treatment for fungal infection will b e initiated per  
SOC . Work up for fungal infection will be performed  per SOC . 
 
The clinical work up for suspected fungal infections may include, but is not limited to, 
checking fungal marker s in  serum (galactomannan and BD glucan ), CAT SCAN of the 
chest , CAT scans of the abdomen/pelvis, head or sinuses , bronchoscopy, or other 
procedure for tissue sampling depending on presenting signs and symptoms . 
 
Follow up (week 15 or discontinuation through week 26)  
 
The following assessments will be performed every 4 weeks during the follow up period:  
 
1. Interim history  
 
2. Review antifungal medications  
 
3. Blood tests: CBC and comprehensive metabolic profile  
 
11.0  TOXICITIES/SIDE EFFECTS  
Study drug will be discontinued if clinically indicated for treatment emergent adverse events  that are 
thought to be related to isavuconazole.  However if another etiology is judged by the PI to be the likely 
cause of toxicity and an interval of no more than 1 4 days has lapsed the study d rug can be resumed at 
original dose. If the same toxicity recurs the patient will be withdrawn from the study treatment.  
 
 For any Grade III or IV toxicity according to NCI common terminology criteria of adverse events 
(CTCAE) version 4.0 which is not typi cally expected in the course of BMT and may be possibly 
related to study drug.  
 
12.0  CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
The primary endpoint is the rate of clinical failure by post - HCT week +14.    
Clinical failure  is defined as:  
1) Systemic antifungal therapy for > 14 consecutive days for suspected fungal infection  
up to week 14. The >14 consecutive days must be completed by week 14 to meet the 
definition of clinical failure.  
2) Breakthrough proven or probable fungal infection during t he prophylaxis phase. The 
prophylaxis phase is defined as the period from the first dose of isavuconazole 
through 7 days after discontinuation (Definitions for proven or probable fungal 
infections are provided in Appendix 1).  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 17-112 A(5) 
Approval date: 02-Oct-2018 
 
 
 
Page 25 of 32 
 
 3) Toxicity leading to permanent discontinuation of prophylaxis  
4) Adverse event requiring discontinuation.  
 
13.0  CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, and the US FDA 
Regulations, a patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason without 
prejudice to his/her future medical care by the physician or at the institution. The Investigator also has the 
right to withdraw patients from the study (see below). Should a patient (or a patient‟ s legally authorized 
representative) decide to withdraw, all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations as 
thoroughly as possible.  
 
A complete final evaluation will be made at the time of the patient‟s withdrawal with an explanation of 
why the patient is withdrawing, and an attempt should be made to perform a follow -up evaluation.  
 
Patients may be removed from study if one or more of the following events occur:  
 
 Significant noncompliance on the part of the patient  
 Refusal of the patient to continue treatment or observations  
 Unacceptable toxicity  
 Decision by the Investigator  
 
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS  
Primary Objective : 
This is a single center open label trial of isavuconazole for prevention of fungal infection in patients 
undergoing HCT for hema tologic malignancies at MSK.  
Patients who receive > 2 doses of isavuconazole are considered evaluable for the primary endpoint.  The 
primary endpoint is the rate of clinical failure by post -HCT week +14.  Clinical failure is defined in 
Section 12.0.   Patients who die, or relapse while on prophylaxis , will be considered evaluable for the 
primary endpoint; clinical failure will be evaluated based on the time on study  as long as the patient 
received more than  two doses of isavuconazole . This endpoint defi nition aligns with a competing risk 
analysis.  
 
On the basis of the prior multicenter, randomized prophylactic trial of voriconazole the rate of clinical 
failure for voriconazole is estimated at 40 -50% (Wingard JR et al, 2010) .  We estimate the rate of clinical 
failure  in our historical control to be 50%. Therefore, we will consider isavuconazole prophylaxis 
promising  and worthy of future investigation i f the clinical failure  rate is 36% or less. Using these rates, a 
single - stage exact design will be im plemented. A total of 85 evaluable patients will be included in the 
primary endpoint. If no more than 36 out of 85 patients have clinical failure , the intervention will be 
considered promising for further investigation. The type I and type II errors are bo th set at 0.10.  
This is a single arm study of prophylaxis with a composite endpoint.  There will be no interim analysis for 
this study. Isavuconazole is FDA approved for treatment of fungal infections. The safety and efficacy of 
isavuconazole has been asse ssed in a phase 3 study for treatment of fungal infections.  In that randomized 
study isavuconazole demonstrated similar efficacy to voriconazole but better tolerability and safety 
profile than voriconazole.  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 17-112 A(5) 
Approval date: 02-Oct-2018 
 
 
 
Page 26 of 32 
 
  
We will accrue 100 subjects to ensure at least 85 evaluable patients.  Patients will be evaluable if they 
have received > 2 doses of isavuconazole. Patients who receive ≤ 2 doses of isavuconazole will be 
considered non-evaluable and will be replaced. In the event that more than 85 of the 100 are evaluable for 
the primary endpoint, only the first 85 evaluable enrolled on study will be included in the evaluation of 
the primary endpoint. We anticipate accrual of approximately 4 patients per month and hence accrual 
should  be completed in 24 months a nd follow up by 36 months.  
Secondary  Objective s: 
1.  Descriptive statistics will be used to assess  serum levels of isavuconazole in patients with 
grade ≥2 acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) of the gastrointestinal tract.  
 
2. Estimate the incidence of probable or proven breakthrough invasive fungal infections 
(IFIs) with isavuconazole prophy laxis at end of study (week 26) using cumulative 
incidence functions. Death in the absence of IFIs is considered a competing event for this  
analysis.  
3. Describe reasons for discontinuation of prophylaxis of isavuconazole. The number and 
type of adverse events (AE) leading to discontinuation of isavuconazole will be described 
and the severity grade and relationship of the AE to isavuconazole wi ll be reported . 
4. Kaplan -Meier m ethods will be used to estimate  overall survival at week 26.  
15.0   RESEARCH PARTICIPANT REGISTRATION AND RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURES  
15.1  Research Participant Registration  
Confirm eligibility as defined in the section entitled Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria. Obtain 
informed consent, by following procedures defined in section entitled Informed Consent 
Procedures. During the registration process registering individuals will be r equired to complete a 
protocol specific Eligibility Checklist. The individual signing the Eligibility Checklist is 
confirming whether or not the participant is eligible to enroll in the study. Study staff are 
responsible for ensuring that all institutional  requirements necessary to enroll a participant to the 
study have been completed. See related Clinical Research Policy and Procedure #401 (Protocol 
Participant Registration).  
 
15.2  Randomization  
This is a single arm, open -label study.  There is no ran domization.  
16.0  DATA MANAGEMENT ISSUES  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 17-112 A(5) 
Approval date: 02-Oct-2018 
 
 
 
Page 27 of 32 
 
 This is a single institution study. All patients will be treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. 
A reserch study assistant (RSA) will be assigned to the study. The responsibilities of the RSA include 
project compliance, data collection abstraction and entry, data reporting, regulatory monitoring, problem 
resolution and prioritization and coordinate the activities of the protoco l study team. The data manager 
will also monitor laboratory compliance throu ghout the study. Laboratory data will be tabulated and 
summarized based on MSK normal ranges.  
Data collected for this study will be entered into the MSK clinical research Database (CRDB).  
SAEs will be reported  According to section 17.2.  
AEs will be docum ented in the patient‟s medical records only if the event is considered at least possibly 
related to ISA . Evidence of the relationship will be initially captured as SOC.  In the event that event is 
reported as at least possibly related, the PI or Co -PI will  review the patient‟s medical records and will 
grade attribute the relationship between the event and ISA on a separate document.  
Any event that began before ISA therapy is initiated will be considered as medical history and will only 
be captured as an AE if the event worsens after ISA treatment is initiated and is deemed to be at least 
possible related to ISA.  AEs will be recorded from ISA treatment initiation through 24 hours after the 
last dose.   
At an accrual rate of approximately  4 patients per month  we anticipate to reach accrual in  24 months. 
With an estimated follow up of 6 months we plan to complete the study in 36 months . 
16.1  Quality Assurance  
Registration reports will be generated by the RSA on a regular basis to monitor patient accruals and 
completeness of the registration data. Routine data quality reports will be generated to assess missing data 
and inconsistencies. Accrual rates and extent and accuracy of evaluations and follow -up will be 
monitored periodically throughout the study period and potential problems will be brought to the attention 
of the study team for discussion and action. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) has 
established standard procedures for data safety monitoring of clinical research (see Data and Safety 
Monit oring Plans) . 
16.2  Data and Safety Monitoring  
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM)  plans at MSK  were approved by the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) in September 2001. The plans address the new policies set forth by NCI in the document titled 
“Policy of the National Ca ncer Institute for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials” which can be 
found at: http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html . The DSM Plans at MSK were 
established and are monitored by the Office of Clinical Research. The MSK Data and Safety Monitoring 
Plans can be found on the MSKCC Intranet at: http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm .  
 
During the protocol development and review process, each protocol will be assessed for its level of risk 
and degree of monitoring required. Every type of protocol (i.e. NIH sponsored, in -house sponsored, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 industrial sponsored, NCI cooperative group, etc.) w ill be addressed and the monitoring procedures will 
be established at the time of protocol activation.  
17.0  PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
Consent process : Participation in this trial is voluntary. All patients will be required to sign a statement 
of infor med consent, which must conform to MSK IRB guidelines.  
 
Benefits : It is known that isavuconazole has activity against the fungal pathogens causing infections in 
HCT recipients. Isavuconazole has been effective for the treatment of aspergillosis and other r are molds 
in immunocompromised patients. Isavuconazole compared to voriconazole has less drug -drug interaction  
and lowe r frequency of adverse events including visual and central nervous system effects, skin eruptions 
and laboratory abnormalities  
 
Protocol Amendments and Study Termination: All protocol amendments will be reviewed and 
approved by the Institutional Review Board of Memorial Hospital before implementation.  
 
Incentives: No incentives will be offered to patient/subjects for participation in this study. Participation is 
voluntary.  
 
Costs: isavuconazole will be provided by Astellas and will be free  of charge to the patients.  
 
Eligibility Exceptions: There will be no except ions to the eligibility requirements for this protocol 
without the authorization of the Institutional Review Board of Memorial Hospital.  
 
Adverse Reporting Requirements: AEs will be documented in the patient‟s medical records. The PI or 
Co-PI will attribute the relationship between the event and ISA.  
Any event that began before ISA therapy is initiated will be considered as medical history and will only 
be captured as an AE if the event worsens after ISA treatment is initiated.  AEs will be recorded  from ISA 
treatment initiation through 1  day after  the last dose.   
Inclusion of Children in Research: Isavuconazole is not approved for children under 18 years of age.  
The protocol does not include children.  
 
Inclusion of women and minorities:  Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center has filed form HHS 441 
(re: Civil Rights), form HHS 641 (handicapped Individuals), and form 639 -A (re: Sex Discrimination). In 
selecting patients for study in the projects proposed in this protocol, we have taken due  notice of 
NIH/ADAMHA policies concerning inclusion of women and minorities in clinical research populations. 
We expect that the study population will be fully representative of the range of patients seen at Memorial 
Hospital without exclusion as to age, g ender, or ethnic background.  
 
Alternatives to the Planned Study : Alternative treatment options include receiving standard antifungal 
prophylaxis with voriconazole or participation in other investigational studies. If relevant, other 
investigational option s will also be outlined.  
 
Confidentiality : Every effort will be made to maintain patient confidentiality. Research and hospital 
records are confidential. Patient's names or any other personally identifying information will not be used Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

17.2  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY of the following outcomes:  
 Death  
 A life -threatening adverse event  
 An adverse event that results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
 A persistent or signific ant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered seriou s when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize 
the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition  
Note : Hospital admission for a planned procedure/disease treatment is not considered an SAE.  
 
SAE reporting is required after the participant consents to the study and is fully registered .  SAE reporting 
is required for 30 -days after the participant‟s last investigational treatment or intervention. Any events 
that occur after the 30 -day period and that are at least possibly related to protocol treatment must be 
reported . 
 
If an SAE requires submission to the IRB office per IRB SOP RR -408 „Reporting of Seriou s Adverse 
Events‟, the SAE report must be sent to the IRB within 5 calendar days of the event. The IRB requires a 
Clinical Research Database (CRDB) SAE report be submitted electronically to the SAE Office as follows:

5 1. Introduction  
1.1 AZD4547 
Background: 
AZD4547 is a selective inhibitor of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1-
3 kinases. It exhibits an in vitro IC50 of <  5nM for FGFR1- 3 and has a 
significant ly lower potency for inhibition of FGFR4 insulin- like growth factor 1 
receptor (IGFIR) and kinase insert domain receptor (KFR) (i.e. vascular 
endothelial growth factor receptor) [VEGFR]. AZD4547 has demonstrated potent 
anti-tumor effects in several human cancer cell lines dependent on FGFR1- 3 
including KMS11, KG1a, SNU16, RT112, NCI -H2077, NCI -H716 and SUM52PE  
and in xenograft models derived from these cell lines . 
AZD4547 has been evaluated in a phase I dose- escalation study which has 
recently completed acc rual ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). This study established the safety, 
PK and PD properties of the drug and a recommended monotherapy dose of 80 
mg twice daily. Dose- expansion cohorts, which were tied to FGFR1 or FGFR2 
amplification as a biomarker, demonstrated activity w ith a small number of 
responses  in biomarker selected populations. AZD4547 has been evaluated in a 
Phase I SqNSCLC cohort  and in a phase II study in advanced gastric cancer. 
AZD4547 is currently being evaluated in studies in the US and in Europe aimed at evaluating its efficacy in biomarker selected populations, principally subjects 
with FGFR1 -3 amplifications, point mutations or fusions.  
Pharmacokinetics of AZD4547: 
Preliminary PK data are available from Studies D2610C00001 (single and 
multiple b id dosing of 20 mg to 200 mg AZD4547 oral suspension formulation 
and 120 mg to 200 mg AZD4547 tablet formulation) and D2610C00003 (a Phase 
I/IIa AZD4547 study in combination with exemestane or fulvestrant in estrogen 
receptor (ER+) breast cancer. Final reported data  are available for D2610C00002 
(single and multiple bi d dosing of 40 to 120 mg and qd dosing of 160 mg 
AZD4547 oral tablet formulation in Japanese patients) and D2610C00004 (an open label Phase IIa study in AZD4547 monotherapy versus paclitaxel in 
advanced gastric cancer).  
These studies showed that AZD4547 has a moderate rate of absorption, with a median time to maximum plasma concentration (t Max) of 1 to 4 hours. Following 
a single dose of AZD4547, peak plasma concentrations declined with a 
consistent terminal elimination half -life (t1/2) across the dose- levels; mean value 
approximately 30 hours . The oral clearance was approximately 50 L/h and the 
oral volume of distribution was greater than total body water indicating that 
AZD4547 was well -distributed in the tissues.  
Safety : 
In the dose -escalation study  (Study D2610C00001) , dose- limiting toxicities 
(DLTs) have been reported for 7 patients: raised liver function tests (80 mg bd 
[suspension]), mucositis (120 mg bd [tablet]),  stomatitis (150 mg bd 
[suspension] ), uncontrolled phosphate levels (160 mg bd [tablet]), renal failure 
(200 mg bd [suspension]), renal failure (160 mg bd [tablet]),  and liver enzyme 
changes (200 mg bd [tablet]). The 160 mg bd dose was declared non-tolerated 
as 2/6 patients experienced DLTs . Rev. 7/16

6 Dose expansion cohorts included 94 subjects reporting AEs. The most commonly 
reported AEs (overall; all doses in all parts of the study  [94 patients]) were 
constipation (43 [45.7%] patients); dry mouth (40 [42.6%] patients), stomatitis (39 
[41.5%] patients), diarrhea (33 [35.1%]  patients), alopecia (32 [34.0%] patients), 
decreased appetite (31 [33.0%] patients),  and vomiting (31 [33.0 %] patients).  
As of 04 June 2014, there have been 49 serious adverse events (SAEs) reported 
in 25 patients; this includes 1 SAE (respiratory distress) in 1 patient, which 
occurred  after the 28 -day follow -up period. Nineteen SAEs in 12 patients were 
considered by the reporting investigator to be related to treatment with AZD4547. 
Asthenia,  blood creatinine increased, chorioretinopathy, dehydration, dyspnea, 
general  physical health deterioration, renal failure, sepsis, and vomiting are SAE 
terms  reported on more than one occasion. 
In the gastric cancer monotherapy  vs. paclitaxel  study  (Study D2610C00004),  40 
subjects were enroll ed. The most commonly reported AEs (of any grade) 
reported for patients receiving  AZD4547 were: decreased appetite (16 [40.0%] 
patients), asthenia (11 [27.5%] patients), nausea (10 [25.0%] patients), 
constipation (10 [25.0%]  patients), stomatitis (10 [25.0%] patients), abdominal 
pain (9 [22.5%] patients), abdominal pain upper (9 [22.5%] patients), dry mouth 
(9 [22.5%] patients), and  vomiting (8 [20.0 %] patients).  As of 05 August 2013, 12 
on-treatment or post -treatment SAEs had been reported  for 8 patients receiving 
AZD4547. AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment were reported for 5 
patients and  2 patients in the AZD4547 and paclitaxel groups, respectively. In the 
AZD4547 group these were: arterial disorder (1 patient; fatal; not considered by 
the reporting i nvestigator to be related to treatment), blood bilirubin increased (1 
patient),  intestinal hemorrhage (1 patient; fatal; not considered by the reporting 
investigator  to be related to treatment), retinal pigment epithelial detachment 
(RPED; 1 pa tient),  and RPED and bile duct obstruction (both terms in 1 patient). 
On the basis of these the studies , the following are considered AEs associated 
with AZD4547: Alopecia, blood creatinine increased, diarrhea, dysgeusia, 
epithelial and mucosal  dryness (including palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia 
syndrome), hair and eyelash disorders, hyperphosphatemia, nail disorders, 
retinal pigment epithelial detachment ( RPED) , stomatitis, and transaminases  
increased.  
More specifically the following adverse events are expected to occur at a frequency greater than 20%: retinal detachment (usually preceded by symptoms 
and with good prognosis), constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, oral mucositis, 
vomiting, fatigue, and anorexia. In addition, ALT and/or AST elevations and 
hyper phosphatemia may occur with a frequency >20%. 
Less likely adverse events include xerophthalmia, keratitis, retinopathy, 
abdominal pain, nausea, altered taste, alopecia, dry skin, hand foot syndrome, 
nail discoloration and dystrophy. In addition, elevations  in the ALP and serum 
creatinine, and decreases in the neutrophil count and ejection fraction may occur. Rarely QT prolongation may occur. Also, since AZD457 is  a selective  inhibitor  of 
the fibroblast  growth  factor  receptor  and may alter bone maturation /metabolism , 
there is a theoretical risk that patients under 25 years of age may not reach their maximu m height while taking AZD4547. This adverse event, however, has not 
been observed or reported as initial trials have not included patients younger than 25 y ears of age.

7 Efficacy: 
There are only sparse clinical data response to AZD4547 in FGFR amplified 
tumours as determined by FISH. This is based on two trials that did not meet this 
endpoint in ORR in the relevant histologies (ASCO 2014 abstract #8035 & 2620) . 
Responses have been documented in patients treated with JNJ42756493 or Novartis FGFR inhibitors (2 of 5 patients treated with BJG398 (Personal 
communication, AstraZeneca, Oct 2014). Responses in tumors harboring FGFR2 and FGFR3 fusions appear to be more robust than in tumors with FGFR gene 
amplifications based on early clinical data.  
1.2 Supporting Preliminary Data  
While FGFR1 -3 gene amplifications had been widely recognized prior to the 
initiation of clinical studies of AZD4547, multiple newer studies have also 
described FGFR gene point mutations and translocations across a diverse array 
of cancer types. Currently , there are preclinical data that tumors with FGFR2 and 
FGFR3 point mutations and FGFR3/TACC3 fusions are responsive to AZD4547; Responses in tumo rs harboring FGFR2 and FGFR3 fusions appear to be more 
robust than in tumors with FGFR gene amplifications based on early clinical data. 
Based on the TCGA dataset , the prevalence of FGFR point mutations is above 
10% in bladder cancer, uterine cancer, cholangiocarcinom a and melanoma and 
5-10% in lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, gastric and 
pancreas cancer. Although t he prevalence of FGFR fusions continues to be 
defined,  fusions have been described in lung, head and neck and bladder cancer 
as well as GBM and cholangiocarcinoma. Moreover, clinical activity of FGFR 
inhibitors has been reported in patients  whose cancers contain FGFR  fusions.

This information has been prepared by the ECOG- ACRIN Pharmacy and Nursing 
Committees.  
Availability  
NO STARTER SUPPLIES MAY BE ORDERED. Subjects must be enrolled and assigned 
to the treatment subprotocol prior to submitting t he clinical drug request to PMB. 
Drug Ordering: NCI supplied agents may be requested by the eligible parti cipating 
Investigators  (or their authorized designee) at each participating institution.  
Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) policy requires that drug be shipped directly 
to the institution where the patient is to be treated. PMB does not permit the transfer of 
agents between institutions (unless prior approval from PMB is obtained – see general 
information)  The CTEP -assigned protocol number must be used for ordering all CTEP-
supplied investigational agents.  The eligible participating investigators at each participating institution must be registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual 
submission of FDA Form 1572 (Statement of Investigator), NCI Biosketch, Agent 
Shipment Form, and Financial Disclosure Form (FDF).  If there are several participating investi gators at one institution, CTEP- supplied investigational agents for the study 
should be ordered under the name of one lead investigator at that institution.  
Submit agent requests through the PMB Online Agent Order Processing (OAOP) application ( https://ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/OAOP
). Access to OAOP requires the 
establishment of a CTEP Identity and Access Management (IAM) account (
https://ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/iam ) and the maintenance of an “active” account status, a 
“current” password, and an active person registration status. 
NCI Supplied Agent(s) – General Information  
Questions about drug orders, transfers, returns, or accountability should be 
addressed to the PMB  by calling 240- 276-6575 Monday through Friday between 
8:30 AM and 4:30 PM Eastern Time  or email PMBAfterHours@mail.nih.gov  
anytime . 
Drug Returns:  All undispensed drug supplies should be returned to the PMB. When it is 
necessary to return study drug (e.g., sealed bottles remaining when PMB sends a stock recovery letter), investigators should return the study drug to the PMB using the NCI 
Return Agent Form available on the NCI home page ( http://ctep.cancer.gov
). 
Drug Accountability: The investigator, or a responsible party designated by the 
investigator, must maintain a careful record of the receipt, disposition, and return of agent received from the PMB using the NCI Invest igational Agent Accountability Record 
Form for Oral Agents available on the NCI home page ( http://ctep.cancer.gov
). Maintain 
separate NCI Investigational Agent Accountability Records for each agent, strength, 
formu lation and ordering investigator . 
Investigator Brochure Availability: The current versions of the IBs for PMB -supplied 
agents will be accessible to site investigators and research staff through the PMB Online Agent Order Processing (OAOP) application. Access t o OAOP requires the 
establishment of a CTEP Identity and Access Management (IAM) account and the maintenance of an “active” account status , a “current” password, and active person 
registration status.  Questions about IB access may be directed to the PMB IB

25 5.1 AZD4547 (NSC 765338)  
5.1.1  Other Names  
None 
5.1.2  Classification  
Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor  
5.1.3  Mode of Action  
AZD4547 is potent and selective inhibitor of the fibroblast growth 
factor receptor (FGFR) -1, 2 and 3 receptor tyrosine kinases and a 
weak inhibitor of both insulin- like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and 
kinase insert domain receptor (KDR).  
5.1.4  Storage and Stability  
Store 20 to 25° C (68 to 77° F) in the original container until use.  
Shelf -life studies are ongoing. Dispense tablets in the original, 
unopened containers. Do not repackage tablets in pharmacy bottles per the manufacturer’s instructions.  
If a storage temperature excursion is identified, promptly return AZD4547 to controlled room temperature and quarantine the supplies.  
Provide a detailed report of the excursion (including documentation of temperature monitoring and duration of the excursion) to 
PMBAfterHours@mail.nih.gov
 for determination of suitability.  
5.1.5  Dose Specifics  
AZD4547 is administered at 80 mg PO BID continuously on a 28- day 
cycle. Dose reductions to 60 mg PO BID continuously on a 28- day 
cycle are allowed.  
5.1.6  Preparation  
AstraZeneca supplies and CTEP, DCTD, NCI distributes AZD4547 as beige, round, biconvex, film -coated tablets in 20 mg and 80 mg 
strengths. Tablets are packed in high- density polyethylene (HDPE) 
bottles. Each 20- count bottle is secured with an induction sealed 
membra ne and child- resistant closure.  
Each tablet contains active drug substance and the following excipients: microcrystalline cellulose, mannitol, magnesium 
carbonate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, sodium starch glycolate and glyceryl dibehenate. The film coating contains polyvinyl alcohol, 
titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol 3350, talc, iron oxide yellow, iron 
oxide red and iron oxide black.  
5.1.7  Route of Administration  
Oral. Take without  regard to meals.  
5.1.8  Incompatibilities  
In vitro  studies demonstrate that AZD4547 is mainly metabolized by 
CYP 3A4/5, 2D6 and 1A1 enzymes. Use caution in patients who are 
taking potent inhibitors or inducers of 3A4/5, 2D6 and 1A1. Smokers 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAY131-W 
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: May 16, 2018  
26 may experience reduced drug exposure since tobacco induces 
CYP1A1 activity. AZD4547 is also mainly glucuronidated by UGT1A8 
and 9 isoforms; however, studies indicate a number of other CYP and 
UGT isoforms may be responsible for AZD4547 metabolism. 
In vitro  studies demonstrate that AZD4547 is a substrate of 
OATP1B1, does not inhibit p- glycoprotein (P -gp) and is a weak 
inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OCT2.  
In vivo , AZD4547 is a reversible and time -dependent inhibitor of CYP 
3A4/5. Use caution when combining AZD4547 with CYP3A4/5 
substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic window.

3. If you vomit after taking your scheduled dose, it will not be made up or re- taken. You 
will continue to receive the next scheduled doses as prescribed 
4. Twice daily doses should be taken at approximately the same time each morning 
and evening approximately 12 hours apart, without regard to meals . 
5. Swallow tablets whole. Do not crush or chew tablets.  
6. Please bring the empty bottle or any leftover tablets and your pill calendar to your 
next clinic visit.  
7. Do not take over the counter calcium supplements, antacids that contain calcium (e.g. Tums ; Alka-Seltzer Chews; Alcalak; Antacid Calcium Extra Strength; Cal- Gest 
Antacid: Calcium Antacid Extra Strength: Calcium Antacid Ultra Max St; Maalox Childrens and some other Maalox formulations; Rolaids; and Titralac ), Vitamin D 
supplements (cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol), or laxatives (Fleets Oral, Fleets enema and Miralax) without first checking with the Study Doctor.  
8. Avoid consumption of grapefruit, grapefruit hybrids, pumellos, star -fruit, Seville 
oranges or products containing the juice of each within 7 days prior to starting study treatment and throughout study treatment.  
9. Do not use tobacco (smoke or chew) while taking this medication – this will make the

Patient Drug Information Handout and Wallet Card 
Information for Patients, Their Caregivers and Non- Study Healthcare Team on Possible 
Interactions with Other Drugs and Herbal Supplements  
The patient ____________________________ is enrolled on a clinical trial using the 
experimental study drug, AZD4547.   This clinical trial is sponsored by the National Cancer 
Institute.  This form is addressed to the patient, but includes important informati on for others 
who care for this patient.   
These are the things that you as a healthcare provider need to know:  
AZD4547 interacts with certain enzymes in the liver and certain transport proteins that help 
move drugs in and out of cells.  
• The enzymes in question are CYP 3A4/5, 2D6, 1A1, and UGT1A8/9. AZD4547 is broken 
down by these enzymes and may be affected by other drugs that strongly inhibit or induce 
these enzymes. AZD4547 inhibits CYP 3A4/5 and may affect other drugs that are broken 
down by these enzymes . 
• The transport proteins in question are OATP1B1 and OCT2. AZD4547 requires OATP1B1 to move and out of cells. AZD4547 is an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OCT2 transport proteins 
and may affect transport of other drugs that require these proteins to move in and out of 
cells.  
To the patient: Take this paper with you to your medical appointments and keep the attached information card in your wallet . 
AZD4547 may interact with other drugs which can cause side effects. For this reason, it is very 
important to tell your study doctors of any medicines you are taking before you enroll onto this 
clinical trial.  It is also very important to tell your doctors if you stop taking any regular medicines, or if you start taking a new medicine while you take part in this study.  When you talk 
about your current medications with your doctors, include medicine you buy without a 
prescription (over -the-counter remedy), or any herbal supplements such as  St. John’s Wort.  It is 
helpful to bring your medication bottles or an updated medication list with you.  
Many health care providers can write prescriptions.  You must tell all of your health care providers (doctors, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists) you are taking part in 
a clinical trial. 
These are the things that you and they need to know:  
AZD4547 must be used very carefully with other medicines that use certain liver enzymes and 
transport proteins to be effective or to be cleared from your system.  Before you enroll onto the 
clinical trial, your study doctor will work with your regular health care providers to review any 
medicines and herbal supplements that are considered “strong inducers/inhibitors of CYP 
3A4/5, 2D6, 1A1, UGT1A8/9 or OATP1B1 or substrates of CYP 3A4/5 and transport proteins 
OATP1B1 and OCT2.”  These characteristics may change how AZD4547 or other medicine 
works in your body.

• Please be very careful!  Over -the-counter drugs (including herbal supplements) may contain 
ingredients that could interact with your study drug.  Speak to your doctors or pharm acist to 
determine if there could be any side effects.  
• Avoid ingesting grapefruit juice, grapefruit and Seville oranges while taking AZD4547.  
• Avoid smoking or use of tobacco products as they may affect how AZD4547 works in your 
body.  
• Your regular health care provider should check a frequently updated medical reference or call your study doctor before prescribing any new medicine or discontinuing any medicine.

 STUDY DRUG INFORMATION WALLET CARD   
You are enrolled on a clinical trial using the 
experimental study drug AZD4547.   This clinical trial 
is sponsored by the NCI.   AZD4547 may interact with 
drugs  that are processed by your liver, or use certain 
transport proteins in your body.  Because of this, it is 
very important to:  
 Tell your doctors if you stop taking any medicines 
or if you start taking any new medicines.  
 Tell all of your health care provider s (doctors, 
physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or pharmacists) that you are taking part in a clinical trial. 
 Check with your doctor or pharmacist whenever you need to use an over -the-counter medicine or 
herbal supplement.  
 Avoid ingesting grapefruit, grapefruit juice and Seville oranges and avoid smoking or use of 
tobacco products while on trial.   AZD4547 interacts with CYP 3A4/5, 2D6, 1A1, UGT1A8/9 and transport proteins OATP1B1 and 
OCT2 and must be used very carefully with other 
medicines that interact with these enzymes and transport proteins.  
 Before you enroll onto the clinical trial, your study 
doctor will work with your regular health care providers 
to review any medicines  and herbal supplements that are considered “strong inducers/inhibitors of CYP 3A4/5, 2D6, 1A1, UGT1A8/9 or OATP1B1 or 
substrates of CYP3A4/5 and transport proteins 
OATP1B1 or OCT2.”  
 Before prescribing new medicines, your regular health care providers should go to a
 frequently -updated 
medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid, or 
contact your study doctor.

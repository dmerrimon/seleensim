Statistical Methodology   
The feasibility and safety of Pazopanib  with low -fat meal  will be 
assessed based on the following statistics with a 95% confidence interval around the reported statistic: frequency of toxicity, severity of 
toxicities (according to CTCAE version 4.03 criteria), frequency of dose-
reductions, duration of therapy, and mean or median total dose taken.

 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Background  
Pazopanib is an orally administered multi- kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR (vascular 
endothelial growth factor receptor), PDGFR (platelet derived growth factor) and c -kit, 
which are critical to growth and proliferation of neoplastic cells. Pazopanib has been FDA 
approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC)  with a clear cell component. This 
approval was based on phase 3 clinical trial results in adult patients with measurable, 
locally advanced, and/or metastatic RCC with either no prior therapy or one prior cytokine 
therapy randomly assigned 2:1 to receive oral pazopanib (800 mg once daily  on an 
empty stomach) or placebo1. The primary end point was progression- free survival (PFS). 
Secondary end points included overall survival, objective tumor response rate (RECIST 
criteria) and safety. Of the 435 patients enrolled, 233 were treatment naive (54%) and 
202 were cytokine pretreated (46%). Progression free survival was significantly 
prolonged with pazopanib compared with placebo in the overall study population 
(median, PFS 9.2 v 4.2 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.62; P < .0001). 
In pre- planned subset analyses, pazopanib prolonged PFS in both treatment -naive 
subpopulation (median PFS 11.1 v 2.8 months; HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.60; P < 
.0001), and the cytokine- pretreated subpopulation (median PFS, 7.4 v 4.2 months; HR, 
0.54; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.84; P < .001). The objective response rate was 30% 
with pazopanib compared with 3% with placebo (P < .001), with a median duration of 
response longer than 12 months  on pazopani b1.  
 
In a subsequent non- inferiority trial, pazopanib was compared to sunitinib in therapy of 
clear cell metastatic renal -cell carcinoma, in 1110 patients who were randomized in a 1:1 
manner to receive continuous pazopanib (800 mg once daily  on an empty stomach; 557 
patients) or sunitinib in 6- week cycles (50 mg once daily for 4 weeks, followed by 2 
weeks without treatment; 553 patients)2. The primary end point was progression- free 
survival as assessed by independent review, and the study was powered to show non-
inferiority of pazopanib versus sunitinib. Secondary end points included overall survival, 
safety, and quality of life. Pazopanib was shown to be non- inferior to sunitin ib with 
respect to progression- free survival (hazard ratio for progression of disease or death from 
any cause, 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.22), meeting the predefined non-
inferiority margin (upper bound of the 95% confidence interval, <1.25). Overall survival 
was also similar (hazard ratio for death with pazopanib, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.08). 
Patients treated with sunitinib, as compared with those treated with pazopanib, had a 
higher incidence of fatigue (63% vs. 55%), hand- foot syndrome (50% vs. 29%), and 
thrombocytopenia (78% vs. 41%). Patients treated with pazopanib had a higher incidence 
of increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (60%, vs. 43% with sunitinib). The mean 
change from baseline in 11 of 14 health- related quality -of-life domains, particularly those 
related to fatigue or soreness in the mouth, throat, hands, or feet, during the first 6 
months of treatment favored pazopanib (P<0.05 for all 11 comparisons)2 
 
Pazopanib has since become one of the standard first line therapies in metastatic RCC3. 
If other agents are chosen in the first line setting, pazopanib is often used in subsequent 
lines of therapy.  
 
 Pazopanib Dosing  
Conventional P azopanib dosing WITHOUT FOOD  is with an  initial dose of 800 mg PO 
qday, with subsequent dose- reduction to 4 00mg or 600 mg daily as needed for toxicities .  
Pazopanib is routinely administered by mouth at least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours 
after food per the FDA approved package insert . These instructions are primarily to keep 
absorption of the medication fairly constant from one day to the next. When given as 
specified in the package insert, absolute bioavailability  of the drug is only 21%.  It is well 
known that fat in a meal co- administered with pazopanib results in higher absorption of 
the drug. Administration of pazopanib with a low or high fat meal  has been studied in an 
Protocol UMCC 2016. 013 
 
Page 5 of 34 
 open- label, randomized, crossover, phase I study that evaluated the effect of low - and 
high-fat meals on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of  pazopanib in patients with advanced solid 
tumors 4. Pazopanib is highly lipophilic, and therefore high fat meals can either potentiate 
the absorption of pazopanib, or reduce its solubility by stimulating gastric acid synthesis4. 
Six subjects were enrolled in a lead- in cohort . They received a single dose of pazopanib 
400 mg with a high- fat meal and were then monitored for safety for  8 days. Twenty -nine 
patients were then enrolled in the food- effect cohort and then randomized to receive two 
single doses of  pazopanib 800 mg in either the fed condition (high- or low -fat meal) or 
fasting condition, in random sequence 14 days apart. After  completion of the study, 
patients were given the opportunity to continue treatment with daily  pazopanib 800 mg in 
the fasting state . Administration of  pazopanib with either low - or high- fat meals had 
resulted in a similar magnitude of increase in the maximum observed plasma 
concentration ( Cmax ) and area under the plasma concentration- time curve (AUC) of 
approximately twofold as compared with the corresponding values when administered to 
patients in the fasted condition4.  
 
Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that pazopanib doses greater than 800mg daily in 
the fasting state did not increase systemic exposure of pazopanib at steady state, likely 
due to saturation of absorption in the gut4. Therefore, it is unclear at this time whether the 
increased Cmax and AUC of pazopanib when given with food will correlate with higher 
systemic exposure when these doses are given repeatedly daily with food. Furthermore, 
although Cmax and AUC were increased, the half -life of the drug was the same in 
patients who received pazopanib fasting or with food, indicating that administering 
pazopanib with food primarily affects its bioavailability4. This study did not control for the 
content and volume of meals the participants ate, and did not perform  pharmacokinetic 
studies on continued dosing of pazopanib with food.  
 
Administration of pazopanib with food in the context of varying day to day diets could 
indeed result in excessive variability of absorption and systemic levels of the drug. But if 
pazopanib could be taken with meals of similar fat content daily, higher and fairly 
consistent absorption of the drug may possibly be achieved safely, potentially  translating 
into equivalent or  improved efficacy of pazopanib with smaller quantities of the drug 
compared to standard administration without food and with an acceptable safety profile.   
  
1.2 Study Rationale  
1) Increased efficacy:  Administration of pazopanib with a consistent meal containing a 
standard low quantity of fat  every day could result in higher systemic levels of the 
drug with low intra- patient variability, translating into higher efficacy against advanced 
renal cell cancer.  
 
2) Lower cost:  A similar strategy with abiraterone acetate in castration resistant prostate 
cancer was recently reported and sets a precedent for our approach 5. If our 
approach is shown to be feasible and safe, future strategies could allow intake of 
similar amounts of the drug to achieve similar or greater efficacy as in the fasting 
state, resulting in substantial cost savings given its high cost of the medication. For 
example, abiraterone when taken with food could result in savings of $3,750 per 
month per patient at current prices. Assuming patients would only need 
approximately half the quantity of drug as currently used (given the 2- fold increase in 
Cmax and AUC), the potential for cost savings with pazopanib given with low fat diet 
could be approximately $3,890 per month per patient at current prices.  
 
3) Convenience:  Intake of the drug with food also minimizes the practical inconvenience 
of taking pazopanib in the fasting state.  
 
Protocol UMCC 2016. 013 
 
Page 6 of 34 
 We hypothesize that administration of pazopanib with low fat meal would be safe and 
feasible with secondary implications of higher pazopanib levels; potentially translating 
into greater anti -tumor efficacy in advanced renal cell cancer, with significant cost 
savings. In the proposed pilot study, we seek to test the feasibility and practicality of t his 
approach and gather preliminary data on adverse effects and the safety profile. We hope 
to ameliorate any potential for greater toxicities with a dynamic dosing design that 
incorporates adverse events from each cycle into dosing for the next cycle and a 
structured symptom specific plan. 
1.3 Study Design/Schema  
Registered subjects will take pazopanib by mouth with a low -fat meal (containing less than 400 
calories and less than 20% fat or 10 grams per meal)  approximately , some sample meals are 
described in appendix 1) every day in 14 day cycles, for  a total of 6 cycles,  with a starting dose of 
400 mg and adjusted for the next cycle (dose level +1:600 mg; dose level +2: 800 mg; dose level 
-1: 200 mg) based on toxicity assessment  during or  at the end of each cycle. No dose re-
escal ations are permitted.  Imaging will be performed post 12 weeks  of treatment . 
 An interim analysis for safety will be performed after 8 subjects have completed at least 2 cycle s 
(4 weeks)  of therapy .

 5.0 TREAT MENT PLAN  
5.1 Treatment Dosage and Administration  
Protocol treatment must start within seven business days of registration  to the study.  
 
Subjects  will take starting dose of pazopanib 400 mg PO once a day with a low-fat meal 
as specified in the protocol once d aily in every 14 days cycles , for a maximum of 12 
weeks .  
 
Consecutive doses should be taken approximately 24 hours (± 4 hours)  apart.  
 
If the subject do es not develop significant toxicities as described in Section 5.2 after the 
first cycle , then the pazopanib dose will be escalated to 600 mg PO once daily with low -
fat meal for the next cycle. If the subject does not develop significant toxicities as 
described in Section 5.2 at 600 mg, then the pazopanib dose will be escalated to 800 mg 
PO once daily with low -fat meal for the next cycle.  
 
Subject will be assessed for significant toxicities as described in section 5.2 at the end of each cycle by clinical exam and laboratory values  including  liver function tests . Any grade 
3 or 4 pazopanib- related (as assessed by treating investigator) non-hematological 
toxicities (except specific toxicities listed in table 2, 3 and 4) will necessitate dose

5.2 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  
Any patient who receives at least 1 dose of pazopanib on this protocol will be evaluable 
for toxicity. Each patient will be assessed for the development of toxicity according to the Time and Events Table (Section 6. 5). Toxicity  will be assessed according to the NCI 
Common Terminol ogy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0.  
 
Dose adjustments should be made according to the system showing the greatest degree 
of toxicity. Please see tables 2, 3, 4, 5 for dose adjustment criteria.   
 
Note:  
• Subjects will be removed from the trial if treatment is  held for 4 weeks or longer 
continuously .  
 
• To avoid potential wound healing complications, Pazopanib should be 
discontinued 5 days prior to any surgery and restarted based on the clinical 
judgment of the primary physician caring for the wound post -operatively.  
 
  Any pregnancies occurring up to 6 months after completion of protocol therapy   
  will be  reported to IRBMED.

5.3 Concomitant Medications/Treatments  
Patients should avoid PPI or other drugs that inhibit (i.e. itraconazole, clarithromycin, 
atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, voriconazole) or induce (i.e. rifampin) 
CYP3A4. Specifically, taking pazopanib with simvastatin has showed to increase the risk 
of hepatoto xicity. So, simvastatin has to be stopped prior to/at subject registration.  
5.4 Duration of Therapy  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue until one of the following criteria apply:  
• Disease progression as defined in Section 7.0  
• Inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment  as deemed 
appropriate by treating physician.  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  as defined in Section 8.0  
Protocol UMCC 2016. 013 
 
Page 13 of 34 
 • Patient voluntarily withdraws from treatment OR  changes in the patient’s condition 
render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the 
investigator . 
• Completion of therapy with pazopanib with low fat meal  for 12 weeks . Patients c ould 
then go onto standard therapies, including pazopanib given without food/low fat meal.  
 
5.5 Off Treatment Criteria  
Patients will be removed from protocol therapy when any of the criteria listed in Section 
5.4 apply. Document in the source the reason for ending protocol therapy and the date the patient was removed from treatment. All patients who discontinue treatment should comply with protocol specific fol low-up procedures as outlined in Section 5.6. The only 
exception to this requirement is when a subject withdraws consent for all study procedures or loses the ability to consent freely.  
5.6 Duration of Follow -Up 
Patients will be followed for 28 days  after removal from treatment or until death, 
whichever occurs first. Patients removed from treatment for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event  (Grade 1 or lower) .  
5.7 Off Study Criteria  
Patients can be taken off study at any time at their own request, or they may be 
withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral or administrative 
reasons. The reason(s) for discontinuation from study will be documented and may include: 
5.7.1  Patient withdraws consent (termination of treatment and follow -up); 
5.7.2  Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntary incarceration for treatment;  
5.7.3  Patient is unable to comply with protocol requirements;  
5.7.4  Treating physician judges continuation on the study would not be in the patients best interest;  
5.7.5  Patient becomes pregnant (pregnancy to be reported along same timelines as a serious adverse event);  
5.7.6  Development of second malignancy (except for basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin) that requires treatment  or which would 
interfere with this study  (per PI) ; 
5.7.7  Termination of the study by The University of Michigan;  
5.7.8  Patient completes protocol treatment and follow -up criteria.  
5.8 Patient Replacement  
 S ubjects who are removed or withdraw consent  from the study  will not be replaced.

7.0 MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
7.1 Antitumor Effect- Solid Tumors  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST  1.1) 
Committee]. The largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are 
used in the RECIST v1.1 criteria.  
7.1.1  Definitions  
Evaluable for toxicity. All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of 
their first dose of  study drug.  
 
Evaluable for objective response. Only those patients who have measurable 
disease present at baseline, have received at least 4 cycles of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated will be considered evaluable for response. These 
patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated below. (Note: Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
 
7.1.2  Disease Parameters  
Measurable disease. Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
 
• 10mm by CT scan (irrespective of scanner type) for studies with a slice 
thickness of <5mm or twice the slice thickness or MRI  
• 10mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be  
             accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as  
             non-measurable)          
• 20mm by chest X -ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung)  
                           
                         All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of     
                         centimeters).  
 
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥15mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At 
baselineand 28 days post therapy , only the short axis will be measured and 
followed.  
Protocol UMCC 2016. 013 
 
Page 18 of 34 
  
Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be considered measurable, and the conditions under which such 
lesions should be considered may be defined in the protocol when appropriate.  
 
Non- measurable disease. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions (longest diameter <20 mm with conventional techniques or <10 mm using 
CT scan), are considered non- measurable disease. Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by 
CT or MRI), and cystic lesions are all non- measurable.  
 
Target lesions. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ 
and 5 lesions in total should be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their 
size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organ, 
but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  
 Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathological 
nodes which are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions 
must meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥15mm by CT scan. Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by radiologists to judge if a node is involved by solid tumor. Nodal size is normally reported as two dimensions in the plane in which 
the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI 
the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal  or coronal). The smaller of these 
measures is the short axis. For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20mm x 30mm has a short axis of 20mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurabl e node. In this example, 20mm should be recorded as the node 
measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥10mm but <15 
mm) should be considered non- target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis 
<10mm are considered non -pathological and should not be recorded or followed.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short axis for nodal 
lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum 
diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be 
used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the 
measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Non- target lesions . All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological 
lymph nodes should be identified as non- target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ (more details to follow). In addition, it is possible to record multiple non- target 
lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form (e.g. ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).  
7.1.3  Guide lines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 
Protocol UMCC 2016. 013 
 
Page 19 of 34 
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Imaging based evaluation should always be done rather than clinical examination 
unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by 
clinical exam.  
 Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they 
are superficial and >10mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin 
nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography 
including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. As noted above, 
when lesions can be evaluated by both clinical exam and imaging, imaging evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may also be 
reviewed at the end of the study.  
 Chest X -ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when 
progression is an important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, 
particularly in id entifying new lesions. However, lesions on chest X -ray may be 
considered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  
 CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure 
lesions selected for response assessment. This guideline has defined 
measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5mm or less. When CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slic e 
thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).  
 Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not 
be used as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next. If new lesions 
are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI 
is advised. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used 
instead of CT in selected instances.  
 Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not  advised. However, they can be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 Cytology, Histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR 
and CR in rare cases if required by protocol (for example, residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). When effusions are known to be a potential adverse effect of treatment (e.g. with certain taxane compounds or angiogenesis inhibitors), the cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment can be considered if the measurable tumor has met criteria for 
response or stable disease in order to differentiate between response (or stable 
disease) and progressive disease.

 7.1.4  Response Criteria  
7.1.4.1  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions, 
determined by two separate observations conducted not less than 4 
weeks apart. There can be no appearance of new lesions.  
 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. There can be no appearance of new lesions.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD 
of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.  
7.1.4.2  Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all  non-target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  
 
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD): Persistence of one or more 
non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the 
normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions 
and/or unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.  
7.1.4.3  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will depend 
on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

 * In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non -target 
lesions may be accepted as disease progression.  
 
Note: Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of 
disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration” . Every effort should be made to 
document the objective progression even after discontinuation of 
treatment.  
 
Note: If subjects respond to treatment and are able to have their disease resected, the patient’s response will be assessed prior to the surgery.  
7.1.5  Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment  started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
7.1.6  Progression -Free Survival  
Progression- free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from 
registration to time of progression.  
7.2 Safety/Tolerability 
  Analyses will be performed for all patients having received at least one dose of study drug (pazopanib) . The study will use the CTCAE version 4.0 for reporting of non-
hematologic adverse events ( http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html
) and modified 
criteria for hematologic adverse events . 
8.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.1 Experimental Therapy 
For the most recent safety update, please refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure or Study Agent Prescribing Information for pazopanib . 
(https://www.gsksource.com/pharma/content/dam/GlaxoSmithKline/US/en/Prescribing_In
formation/Votrient/pdf/VOTRIENT -PI-MG.PDF ). 
 
8.2 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial and is done to ensure the safety of subjects enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents. Data on adverse events will be collected from 
the time of the initial study treatment through 30 days after the last dose of study 
treatment or study intervention. Any serious adverse event that occurs more than 30 days 
Protocol UMCC 2016. 013 
 
Page 22 of 34 
 after the last study treatment and is considered related to the study treatment must also 
be reported. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will continue to be followed until:  
• Resolution or the symptoms or signs that constitute the serious adverse event 
return to baseline;  
• There is satisfactory explanation other than the study treatment for the changes observed; or  
• Death.  
The investigator is responsible for the detection, documentation, grading and assignment of attribution of events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE. The definitions 
of AEs and SAEs are given below. It is the responsibility of the principal investigator to ensure that all staff involved in the trial is familiar with the content of this section.  
Any medical condition or laboratory abnormality with an onset date before initial study treatment administration is considered to be pre- existing in nature. Any known pre-
existing conditions that are ongoing at time of study entry should be considered medical 
history.  
All events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE, as defined in Section 8.3,  
occurring from the initial study treatment through 30 days following the last dose of the 
study treatment must be recorded as an adverse event in the patient’s source documents and on the CRF regardless of frequency, severity (grade) or assessed relationship to the study treatment.  
In addition to new events, any increase in the frequency or severity (i.e., toxicity grade) of a pre- existing condition that occurs after the patient begins study treatment is also 
considered an adverse event.  
8.3 Definitions  
8.3.1  Advers e Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient receiving study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an experimental intervention, whether or not related to the intervention.  
8.3.2  Serious Adverse Event  
An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in the view of the investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
  o Death  
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease should be 
reported as event (SAE) itself.  
 
o A life -threatening adverse event  
An adverse even is considered ‘life- threatening’ if, in the view of either  the 
investigator, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 
o Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization for > 24 
hours.  
Protocol UMCC 2016. 013 
 
Page 23 of 34 
  
o A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
 
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
o Important medical event  
Any event that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition of “Serious Adverse Event”. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 Previously planned (prior to signing the informed consent form) surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condition has worsened during the course of the study. Preplanned hospitalizations or procedures for preexisting conditions that are already recorded in the patient’s medical history at 
the time of study enrollment should not be considered SAEs. Hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitalization without a precipitating clinical AE (for example, for 
the administration of study therapy or other protocol- required procedure) should 
not be considered SAEs. However, if the preexisting condition worsened during the course of the study, it should be reported as an SAE.  
 
8.3.3  Expected Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “expected” if:  
• For approved and marketed drug, such as pazopanib, those adverse 
events are described in the approved Package Insert (Label).  
• In clinical research studies, information on expected adverse events is also summarized in the protocol and in the consent document.  See 
section 9.1 for the list of expected adverse events related to the drug 
under study.  
8.3.4  Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “unexpected” if it is not described in the Package Insert, Investigator’s Brochure, in published medical literature, in the protocol, or in the informed consent document.  
8.4 Adverse Event Characteristics  
8.4.1  CTCAE Term  
(AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4. 0 will be 
utilized for AE reporting.  All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a 
copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be down 
loaded from the CTEP web site. ( http://ctep.cancer.gov
) 
8.4.2  Attribution of the AE  
The investigator or co- investigator is responsible for assignment of attribution.  
Definite  – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
Protocol UMCC 2016. 013 
 
Page 24 of 34 
 Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment.  
Unlikely  – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
Unrelated  – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
8.5 Serious Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines  
8.5.1  The Principal Investigator  must be notified within 1 business day of study team’s 
knowledge of any event meeting the criteria and definition of a serious adverse 
event, regardless of attribution, occurring during the study or within 30 days of the last administration of the study drug. 
8.5.2  The investigator must report all events meeting the criteria and definition of a serious adverse event(s) that are unexpected and possibly related (definite, 
probable or possible) to study treatment administration to the local IRB within 7 
calendar days if death or life threatening, and within 14 calendar days for all others.    
8.5.3  All Serious Adverse Events that are unexpected and possibly related (definite, 
probable or possible) to study treatment administration will be reported to the IRB using the CTO Serious Adverse Event form.

    Email: a jjai@med.umich.edu 
• The study will comply with the regulations found in 21 CFR 312.32 regarding IND 
safety reports.    
8.6 Routine Reporting  
All other adverse events - such as those that are expected, or are unlikely or definitely not 
related to the study participation- are to be reported annually as part of regular data 
submission.  
8.7 Reporting of Unanticipated Problems  
There are types of incidents, experiences and outcomes that occur during the conduct of 
human subjects research that represent unanticipated problems but are not considered adverse events. For example, some unanticipated problems involve social or economic 
harm instead of the physical or psychological harm associated with adverse events. In 
other cases, unanticipated problems place subjects or others at increased risk of harm, but no harm occurs.  
 Upon becoming aware of any incident, experience, or outcome (not related to an adverse event) that may represent an unanticipated problem, the investigator should assess 
whether the incident, experience, or outcome represents an unanticipated problem. The 
incident, experience or outcomes is considered unanticipated if it meets all of the following criteria:  
 
1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency);  
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research; and  
Protocol UMCC 2016. 013 
 
Page 25 of 34 
 3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
than was previously known or recognized.  
If the investigator determines that the incident, experience, or outcome represents an 
unanticipated problem, the investigator must report it to the IRB within 14 calendar days 
of the study team becoming aware of the problem.  
8.8 Stopping Rules for the Study  at Interim Analysis  
• Please refer to s ection 11  
9.0 DRUG INFORMATION 
9.1 Pazopanib  
• Brand name: Votrient  
 
• Description: 200 mg capsule- shaped, gray tablets dispensed in bottles with 120 
tablets.  
 
• Classification: Inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases  
 
• Mode of action: Inhibition of VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor), 
PDGFR (platelet derived growth factor) and c -kit,  
 
• Pharmacokinetics: Pazopanib is routinely administered without food i.e. at least 1 
hour before or 2 hours after a meal 
(https://www.gsksource.com/pharma/content/dam/GlaxoSmithKline/US/en/Prescribin
g_Information/Votrient/pdf/VOTRIENT -PI-MG.PDF). When thus administered 
WITHOUT food, pazopanib has a median absolute bioavailability of 21% and mean 
half-life of 30.9 hours. The median time to peak concentration is 2- 4 hours after dose, 
and repeated daily dosing results in 1- 4 fold increase in AUC  and Cmax with a daily 
dose up to 800mg daily. Doses above 800mg daily did not show a consistent 
increase in AUC and Cmax. Administration with food results in about 2 fold increase 
in AUC and Cmax. Crushing the tablet also resulted in increased AUC, increased 
Cmax and decreased Tmax when compared to administration of the tablet as a 
whole. Based on these observations, it was recommended that pazopanib be 
administered as a whole tablet 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. Additionally, the 
bioavailab ility of pazopanib is affected by drugs that increase gastric pH, such as 
esomeprazole, resulting in reduce plasma concentration of pazopanib.  
 
Once absorbed, pazopanib is highly bound to albumin (~99%) with no concentration 
dependence in the 10- 100 microgram/milliliter range, and a subsequent small volume 
of distribution (<40% total body water). It is a substrate for human P -gp and human 
BCRP transporters, which mediate the efflux of substrates from cells in tissues such 
as small intestine, blood- brain bar rier, testes and liver. Therefore, any factors that 
influence these transporters will also influence the tissue distribution of pazopanib. 
Furthermore, pazopanib is not a highly metabolized drug, as evidenced by low 
concentration of metabolites in vivo (<10% of parent drug concentration), and 
therefore pazopanib  is the active drug and the major circulating species. Pazopanib 
does have 4 metabolites, GSK1268997, GSK1268992, GSK1071306 and 
GW700201, of which only GSK1268997 was active with similar inhibition of VEGF -
induced endothelial receptors as pazopanib. Primary route of pazopanib metabolism 
is hepatic, and it is thereby excreted through the feces. Less than 4% of administered 
dose is excreted renally. CYP3A4 is the major metabolizing enzyme, with minor 
contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP2C8. Routes of metabolism are mono-
Protocol UMCC 2016. 013 
 
Page 26 of 34 
 oxygenation, dioxygenation and potential oxygenation of a methyl group to a 
carboxylic acid. Glucuronidation was also detected in human hepatocytes. Steady -
state plasma concentrations were reached by 10 days of repeated dose 
administration. Pharmacokinetics  of pazopanib was otherwise not affected by age, 
race, gender, body weight and creatinine clearance.  
 
• Side effects: Please refer to pazopanib’s package insert 
((https://www.gsksource.com/pharma/content/dam/GlaxoSmithKline/US/en/Prescribin
g_Information/Votrient/pdf/VOTRIENT -PI-MG.PDF) for a comprehensive list of 
adverse events.  
• Drug Interactions: Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, P -glycoprotein (P -gp) and Breast 
Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP), all three of which include pazopanib as a 
substrate, should be avoided due to risk of increased toxicity associated elevated 
levels of pazopanib. Ketoconazole is an inhibitor of both CYYP3A4 and P -gp. 
Lapatinib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, Pgp and BCRP, and has been shown to 
increase pazopanib concentrations. Examples of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are 
itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, 
saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole. Grapefruit juice may also increase plasma 
levels of pazopanib through the same mechanism. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors shoul d 
be avoided.   
 
On the other hand, CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, may decrease pazopanib 
plasma levels, and therefore an alternative medication to rifampin is also 
recommended. In vitro  studies showed pazopanib inhibited CYP enzymes 1A2, 3A4, 
2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2E1 and potentially induced CYP3A4. Pazopanib 800mg daily 
has no clinically relevant effect on pharmacokinetics of caffeine (CYP1A2), warfarin 
(CYP2C9 substrate) or omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate) in clinical pharmacology 
studies. Concomitant administration of pazopanib with midazolam (CYP3A4 
substrate) and dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) resulted in an increase in the 
AUC and Cmax, and increase in urine dextromethorphan to dextrorphan 
concentrations, respectively. Pazopanib also increased the AUC and Cmax of 
paclitaxel when administered concurrently.  
 
 
Pazopanib is also a potent inhibitor of UGT1A1 and OATP1B1, and therefore may 
increase the concentrations of drugs primarily metabolized by these enzymes. One 
such drug is irinotecan, which also has an active metabolite, SN -38, that is 
metabolized by OATP1B1 and several UGT enzymes. Co- administration of irinotecan 
and pazopanib resulted in increased concentrations of irinotecan and its active 
metabolite SN -38. 
 
• Storage and stability: Pazopanib should be stored at room temperature between 20 
and 25 degrees Celsius , with excursions permitted to 15 to 30 degrees Celsius .  
 
• Preparation and Dispensing: Pazopanib is dispensed in a bottle and may be repackaged to a pill dispenser bottle.  
 
• Administration:  
• Pazopanib will be administered with a low-fat meal, defined as a meal 
containing less than 400 calories and less than 20% fat  or 10 grams per 
meal , once daily orally.  
• All pazopanib pills for the day must  be taken together.  
• Patient compliance with drug administration will be assessed at each visit through a pill diary  that will record rate, time of pazopanib intake, number of pills, 
and if low fat meal was eaten.   
Protocol UMCC 2016. 013

• Availability : comm ercially available  
• Return and Retention of Study Drug: Patients may keep their supply of pazopanib as 
it will not be supplied by the study. They should dispose of any unused pazopanib 
after their therapy course is complete or if their supply has expired by  returning it to 
their local pharmacy. It should not be thrown in household garbage or disposed of in wastewater  
 
• Drug Accountability: None, pazopanib is a current standard of care for metastatic 
renal cell  carcinoma and therefore will be billed and provided as such.

11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Protocol UMCC 2016. 013 
 
Page 28 of 34 
 11.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints and Data Assessment Plan  
Pazopanib with a low fat diet is a pilot study with a primary endpoint of feasibility and 
safety.   
 
The primary outcome will be a description of toxicity and feasibility with the following 
endpoints: any  hematologic toxicity of grade 4 or non- hematologic toxicities of grades 3  
and 4 (excluding alopecia, and also excluding nausea and vomiting if the  
symptoms were manageable with standard care or antiemetic therapy) ; frequency and 
proportion of toxicities of all grades according to the CTCAE version 4.0 criteria; the 
frequency of dose reductions ; the duration of treatment and the mean (or median) total  
dose taken. Each endpoint will include a 95% confidence around the reported statistic.  
Examples of exact confidence interval ranges with a sample size of 16 are presented in 
table 3.  
  
  Table 5:  
 
 
  
 
   
 
The secondary objectives include overall response proportion by RECIST 1.1 including 
complete response and partial response at 12 weeks after start of pazopanib therapy 
start (CT chest, abdomen and pelvis) . Each response proportion will be expressed with 
95% exact binomial confidence intervals.  
 
The pharmacokinetic data (Cmax  in units  of ng/mL and the trough concentration in units  
of micro  g/mL) will be reported in context of known PK data of pazopanib administered in 
the fasting state7 and described in the context of the toxicity data. 
 An interim safety analysis will be conducted after 8 patients have been treated for 2 cycles on pazopanib with a low fat meal. If greater than 5 patients of the 8 experience 
hematologic toxicity of grade 4 or non- hematologic toxicities of grades 3 or 4 (excluding 
alopecia, and also excluding nausea and vomiting if the symptoms  were manageable 
with standard care or antiemetic therapy), the study will be pause. Further study may be continued with an amendment to decrease the starting dose to 200 mg PO daily with low fat meal subject to PRC review/approval and IRB review/approval.  
11.2 Sample Size and Accrual  
A sample size of 16 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma will be enrolled over a 
12 month period with an interim analysis for safety after 8 patients have completed 2 
cycles . As a pilot study, this sample size is a convenience sample and sufficient to 
determine the feasibility of administering pazopanib with a low -fat meal in  advanced renal 
cell carc inoma,  the associated toxicity profile and preliminary efficacy measures such as 
ORR, PFS or overall survival.   Frequency  Proportion  95% Confidence Interval  
1 6.25% 0.2%, 30.2% 
2 12.5% 1.6%, 38.4% 
3 18.75 % 4.1%, 45.7% 
6 37.5% 15.2%, 64.5% 
8 50% 24.7%, 75.4% 
Protocol UMCC 2016. 013 
 
Page 29 of 34 
 Based on data form this pilot study, a larger follow -up study may be warranted to 
definitively address the cost savings of administering pazopanib with low fat meal  and the 
efficacy  of the drug when given with low fat meal.  
12.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
This trial will be monitored in accordance with the NCI approved University of Michigan 
Comprehensive Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan. The study specific Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), consisting of the protocol investigators, data manager or designee, and other members of the study team involved with the conduct of the trial, will meet quarterly  or more frequently depending on the activity of the protocol to provide continuous review 
of the data and patient safety. The discussion will include matters related to the safety of study participants (SAE/UaP reporting), validity and integrity of the data, enrollment rate relative to expectations, characteristics of participants, retention of participants, adherence to the protocol (potential or real protocol deviations) and data completeness. At the regular DSMC meetings, the protocol specific Data and Safety Monitoring Report form will be completed. The report will be signed by the Principal Investigator or by one of the co- investigators. Data and Safety Monitoring 
Reports will be submitted to the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) on a quarterly  basis for independent review.

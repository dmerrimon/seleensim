Brief Summary of Research (250 -400 words):  
Patients who undergo general anesthesia for surgical procedures frequently need to have 
a breathing tube placed (“tracheal intubation”) for the duration of the procedure. Most 
often airway management is routine for an experienced anesthesiologist. Less often, 
airway management can be difficult and can result in patient harm. In order to reduce 
risk, anesthesiologists routinely evaluate patients’ airways by obtaining a relevant h istory 
and doing a physical exam, which can aid in predicting which airways may be difficult to 
manage. The “gold standard” for management of the anticipated difficult airway is to 
perform an awake flexible bronchoscopic intubation after anesthetizing the airway with 
local anesthesia. This affords added safety because the airway remains patent and the 
patient breaths spontaneously until a tracheal tube is secured, at which point general 
anesthesia can be induced.  
 
Recently, authors have advocated for alter native methods of management of the predicted 
difficult airway, most commonly by using a video laryngoscope to perform the awake 
intubation. A video laryngoscope provides an indirect view of the larynx using a camera 
at the tip of a rigid laryngoscope. It takes less training to gain and maintain proficiency 
compared to flexible bronchoscopy.  
 
Previous studies that have shown successful awake intubation with video laryngoscopy in 
the predicted difficult airway have not included patients with head and neck p athology, 
including malignancies or a history of head and neck surgery or radiation. Video

Revised  9/2/14  laryngoscopy may be more prone to failure in this patient population, and randomizing 
this population to video laryngoscopy would pose too great a risk.  
 
If results  of previous studies are erroneously  generalized, anesthesiologists’ skills in 
flexible bronchoscopy will decline. We therefore propose to perform video laryngoscopy 
in patients with head and neck pathology who require awake bronchoscopic intubation 
for su rgery after placement of the tracheal tube and induction of anesthesia. This will 
allow us to approximate what the laryngeal view would have been with video 
laryngoscopy. If there is a significant incidence of difficult video laryngoscopy in this 
patient p opulation, it will reinforce that anesthesiologists need to continue to learn and 
maintain skills in bronchoscopic intubation.  
 
Objectives:  
Research Question:  In patients with predicted difficult airways due to head and 
neck pathology  (malignancy or a hist ory of surgery or radiation therapy)  who 
undergo awake bronchoscopic intubation, what proportion would have been 
possible to intubate with video laryngoscopy?  
Hypothesis: A significant proportion of patients with head and neck 
pathology will have poor laryngeal views with post -induction video 
laryngoscopy by experienced anesthesiologists.  
Primary objective: Determine the incidence of difficult (Cormack -Lehane 
grade >2) video laryngoscopic view of the larynx after awake flexible 
bronchoscopic intubation in patien ts with head and neck pathology  
 Secondary objectives:  
a) grade the view (Cormack -Lehane) obtained by video laryngoscopy 
after awake flexible bronchoscopic intubation in patients with head 
and neck pathology  
b) grade the view (Cormack -Lehane) obtained by v ideo laryngoscopy 
after awake flexible bronchoscopic intubation in patients with head 
and neck masses  
c) grade the view (Cormack -Lehane) obtained by video laryngoscopy 
after awake flexible bronchoscopic intubation in patients with a history 
of neck radiation

Revised  9/2/14   
Awake flexible bronchoscopic intubation is considered the gold standard in the 
management of the anticipated difficult airway.1 More recently, this has been called into 
question,2 with alternative intubation techniques described in both asleep  and awake 
patients. In particular, many have advocated the use of awake video laryngoscopy.3,4 
How ever, these studies did not include patients with head and neck pathology such as 
airway masses or previous neck rad iation.  
 
Advantages cited for videolaryngoscopy include faster intubation time, less training 
required to gain and maintain skills, creation of space within the a irway to suction 
secretions,  view of the tracheal tube during intubation of the larynx (as op posed to blind 
“railroading” of the tube over the bronchoscope) , lower cost , and easier maintenance  of 
equipment . Disadvantages of videolaryngoscopy include possible increased risk of failure 
due to gag reflex unable to be attenuated with topical anesthesi a, inability to use with  
very limited mouth opening, and inability to move around fixed lesions. While video 
laryngoscopy has a well -established role in management of the difficult airway, it does 
have recognized limitations and failures. There appears to be an increased risk of failure 
of video laryngoscopy in patients with airway masses, neck pathology, and neck 
radiation5 plausibly because a flexible scope would be required to move around immobile 
tissues. Neither  direct nor indirect video laryngoscopy can accomplish this necessary 
flexibility. Randomizing this patient population, for whom awake flexible bronchoscopic 
intubation is the gold standard, to ot her techniques would be unsafe, as multiple 
laryngoscopies c an increase the difficulty of airway management. As these patients have 
been excluded from previous randomized studies, the results of these studies cannot be 
generalized to the head and neck pathology patient population. This study aims to assess 
the util ity of video laryngoscopy in this patient population by performing a video 
laryngoscopy after the endotracheal tube is safely secured by awake bronchoscopy to get 
an estimate of what the laryngeal view would have been had awake video laryngoscopy 
been used  for the intubation. While laryngoscopy conditions are not identical after an 
endotracheal tube is already in place and the patient is anesthetized, it is the most 
appropriate study design to ensure safety in this patient population.  
 
If we find a signific ant number of difficult video laryngoscopies in this patient 
population, it will reinforce the need for anesthesiologists to maintain skills in flexible 
bronchoscopic intubation. Despite clear clinical indication and a good safety and success 
profile, expe rienced anesthesiologists may incorrectly forego awake bronchoscopic 
intubation. Qualitative analysis of cases in the United Kingdom’s Royal College of 
Anaesthetists’ 4th National Audit Project (NAP4) revealed elements of poor airway 
management in >75% of reports. Upper airway malignancy or disease processes of the 
head and neck were present in 40% of cases presented to NAP4. The report found

judgment, lack of skills, or lack of equipment.6  
 
Bronchoscopy skills are challenging to attain and are prone to decay, potentially leading 
to practitioner discomfort with awake flexible bronchoscopy if not continually 
practiced.7,8 This study aims to add to the current body of knowledge regarding the use of 
video laryngoscopy for the predicted difficult airway, specifically in the head and nec k 
pathology patient population. Unlike previous publications,  this study will provide a safe 
way to evaluate the use of video laryngoscopy in patients with head and neck malignancy 
and/ or previous head and neck surgery or radiation. Information from this study will help 
guide future strategies in difficult airway m anagement. Our  hypothesis  is that the 
anatomy in this patient population does not lend itself to straightforward  video 
laryngoscopy, and that flexible bronchoscopy continues to have a vital role in the 
management of these airways.  
 
2) Setting of the Human Res earch  
This study will be conducted at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount 
Sinai at 1468 Madison Avenue in the 7th floor Annenberg Building 
operating rooms. Consent will be obtained in the preoperative holding 
area, and the study protocol will occur in th e operating room in which the 
patient is assigned.  
3) Resources Available to Conduct the Human Research  
100 participants will be enrolled in this study. Between 3 -10 awake 
intubations with a flexible bronchoscope are performed per week in 
patients with head a nd neck pathology coming to the Annenberg 7 
operating rooms. Assuming conservatively that we can enroll 1 -2 patients 
per week, we anticipate completing the study within two years after 
initiation.  
Drs. Demaria, Levine, and Hyman are attending anesthesiolog ists with 
substantial experience in supervising and performing awake flexible 
bronchoscopic intubations and post -induction video laryngoscope 
intubations. We also each have previous experience with research 
involving ENT surgical patients in the same pract ice setting, and well -
established professional relationships with our ENT surgical and nursing 
colleagues to help support the study.  
Prior to initiating this study, all participating investigators and support 
staff will conduct a protocol initiation meetin g to ensure adequate

discharge to be assessed for all primary and secondary endpoints, we 
estimate the study will be complete within 2 weeks of  final patient 
enrollment.  
 
e) Study Endpoints  
Primary objective: Determine the incidence of difficult  (Cormack -Lehane 
grade >2) video laryngoscopic view of the larynx after awake flexible 
bronchoscopic intubation in patients with head and neck pathology.  
 Secondary objectives:  
a) grade the view (Cormack -Lehane) obtained by video laryngoscopy 
after awake flex ible bronchoscopic intubation in patients with head 
and neck pathology  
b) grade the view  (Cormack -Lehane)  obtained by video laryngoscopy 
after awake flexible bronchoscopic intubation in patients with head 
and neck masses  
c) grade  the view (Cormack -Lehane) obtai ned by video laryngoscopy 
after awake flexible bronchoscopic intubation in patients with a history 
of neck radiation  
Subjects will be withdrawn from the study and video laryngoscopy will 
not be performed if the awake flexible bronchoscopy fails and the pat ient 
cannot be intubated, or if there is difficulty with the awake flexible 
bronchoscopy resulting in tissue trauma.  
f) Procedures Involved in the Human Research  
Patients who are undergoing non -emergency surgery who have a history 
of head and neck pathology ( masses, previous surgery, and/or radiation) 
who as determined by the anesthesiologist caring for the patient must 
undergo awake flexible bronchoscopic intubation will be invited to 
participate in the study after preoperative evaluation prior to entry into the 
operating room. Once in the operating room, intravenous access will be 
obtained and American Society of Anesthesiologists ’ standard monitors 
(pulse oximeter, electrocardiogram tracing, blood pressure cuff) will be 
applied. The patient will receive glyc opyrrolate 0.2mg -0.4mg and sedation 
as per the usual practice of the anesthesiologist. Airway topicalization 
with lidocaine and awake flexible bronchoscopic intubation will be 
performed. After the tracheal tube is secured and general anesthesia is

Revised  9/2/14  Dr. Hyman and Dr. Demaria are board certified anesthes iologi sts with expertise in 
difficult airway management . All subjects will be monitored closely in the 
immediate perioperative period by the anesthesia team caring for the patient. 
Participants will also be seen postoperatively within 48 hours to assess for 
delayed complications, or called by telephone in the case of ambulatory 
procedures. Ambulatory  participants will also receive instructions and a business 
card in order to have a point of contact to report a potential adverse event  at any 
time during or after  participation . They will also be specifically informed that 
they should receive emergency d epartment care for any signs or  symptoms of 
airwa y compromise . Any serious adverse event  will be recorded by the research 
team in a non -anonymized fashion and reporte d directly to the Mount Sinai 
Institutional Review Board.  
j) Withdrawal of Subjects  
Subjects will be immediately withdrawn from the study if:  
• Any difficulty resulting in airway injury occurs during the initial 
awake bronchoscopic intubation  
• The awake broncho scopic intubation is not able to be performed 
successfully  
If withdrawn from the study, the anesthesiologist will not perform the 
planned laryngoscopy with the video laryngoscope.  
 
5) Risks to Subjects  
It is reasonably foreseeable that participants will have  an increased risk of 
sore throat from the addition of video laryngoscopy.  
Video laryngoscopy has the pot ential cause damage to oropharyn geal 
structures, including but not limited to : dentition, hard palate, soft palate, 
epiglottis, vocal cords, larynx, a nd soft tissue. These injuries are more 
likely to occur when struggling to obtain an adequate view of the larynx in 
order to intubate , which will not be the case for this study . Since the 
airway will be protected with an endotracheal tube during laryngosco py, 
damage/ bleeding in the airway should not lead to issues with oxygenation 
or ventilation.  
There is a risk of hemodynamic changes during laryngoscopy. The 
anesthesiologist will have the ability to treat tachycardia, bradycardia, 
hypertension, and hypot ension with the appropriate pharmacologic agents.

Revised  9/2/14  There is a slight risk of unintentional extubation during laryngoscopy - if 
this is to happen the anesthesiologist should be able to reintubate the 
patient using either the flexible bronchoscope or video la ryngoscope, but it 
is possible that reintubation would  be difficult.  
There is a slight risk of having to keep the patient intubated 
postoperatively due to continued bleeding or swelling from damage during 
video laryngoscopy. If this is to occur, the patien t will be admitted to an 
acute care setting for further ventilation management and eventual 
extubation.  
6) Provisions for Research Related Injury  
Subjects  will be monitored during surgery and during recovery from 
anesthesia. Upon discharge, subjects will be provided with a phone 
number to call should they have any concerns related to surgery, 
anesthesia, or the study. If necessary, subjects will be instructed to return 
to the hospital should any complication requiring medical attention occur, 
or to the neares t emergency department for any signs of airway 
compromise.  
Subjects  who are injured as a result of this study will be treated until the 
resolution of the adverse event and the cost billed to them and/or their 
insurance carrier. Patients will not be compens ated for research related 
injury , with the exception of damage to dentition that occurs during the 
course of anesthetic care, which is routinely covered by the department of 
anesthesiology.  
Anesthesiologists and intensive care unit staff will be available to maintain 
ventilation and airway management in the event of airway damage/ 
bleeding requiring prolonged intubation. ENT surgeons will be present in 
the operating room and immediately available in the unlikely case of need 
for an emergent surgical airway.  ENT surgeons would also be available 
for evaluation and treatment of non -emergent oropharyngeal injuries.  
7) Potential Benefits to Subjects  
Participation in this study will not lead to any direct benefit to the patient.  
8) Provisions to Protect the Privacy In terests of Subjects  
The de -identified data wil l be stored on secure, password -protected servers 
maintained by Mount Sinai Information Technology (I T).  Access to the

a. Background  
Hemorrhage is the leading cause of battlefield and civilian trauma deaths.  In the early stages of a 
hemorrhagic injury, autonomic compensatory mechanisms are engaged that are vital to maintain blood 
delivery to vital organs.  
 
Hemorrhagic injuries are virtually always accompanied with pain. Pain management of an injured 
soldier is a critical component of the medical care of that casualty. It is critical that the employed 
analgesic not compromise autonomic responses requisite to ma intain arterial blood pressure, and thus 
blood flow, in a hemorrhaging individual.   Sublingual sufentanil was recently approved by the FDA and 
is being deployed on the battlefield as and analgetic. No studies have evaluated the effects of 
analgesic doses  of sufentanil on tolerance to a simulated (or actual) hemorrhagic insult in humans.   
 
We propose that if sufficient doses of commonly employed analgesics are administered to humans, 
otherwise appropriate cardiovascular responses to the hemorrhagic insult will be suppressed, thereby 
reducing the ability of the individual to tolerate that ins ult.  That said, the effects of analgesic doses of 
such agents (i.e., doses that are recommended for the pre -hospital setting) on physiological responses 
necessary to preserve tolerance to a hemorrhagic insult in humans is entirely unknown. Thus, the 
objec tive of this work is to identify the effects of sublingual sufentanil on tolerance to a simulated 
hemorrhagic challenge in humans.

V2Mar2018  b. Current practice  
A 30 microgram dose of sufentanil  (trade name: Dsuvia) is administered sublingually for the 
management of acute pain.  
 
3.  Study Design.  
Describe the study design (e.g., single/double blind, parallel, crossover, etc.)  Consider inserting a scheme 
to visually present the study design.  
 
We will conduct a double -blind, placebo -controlled, crossover study. Following informed consent and 
screening, eligible participants will be randomized to complete the sufentanil  or the placebo trial  first, with the 
other “agent” administered during the subsequent visit . During these experimental visits, we will administer 
two assessments of pain perception (described in greater detail below), then administer sufentanil 
sublingually  or a placebo pill also sublingually, perform the simulate hemorrhagic tolerance assessment 
(lower -body negative pressure), and then re -assess the measures of pain perception . The graphic s below 
depicts the study design  and experimental protocol, respectively .

V2Mar2018  Inclusion:  
• 18-45 years of age  
• Healthy  
• Body mass index less than 33 kg/m2 
• Body mass greater than or equal to 60 kg 
• Speak English  
 
Exclusion:  
• Subjects not in the defined age range  
• Subjects who have cardiac, respiratory, neurological and/or metabolic illnesses  
• Any known history of renal or hepatic insufficiency/disease  
• Pregnancy or breast feeding  
• Body mass less than 60 kg 
• Current smokers, as well as individuals who regularly smoked within the past 3 years  
• Subjects who cannot speak or read English  
• Positive urine drug screen  
• Currently taking pain modifying medication(s)  
 
Although this study requires relatively uncomplicated procedures, inclusion of non -English speaking subjects 
would compromise subject safety. Consequently, it is imperative that the research and medical staff can 
communicate instantly and effectively with subjects, without the need of a translator. Therefore, the 
investigators feel that inclusion of non -English speakers would markedly and unnecessarily increase the risk 
to those participants.  
 
Healthy adults will be recruited via online and paper  flyers, emails to the Texas Health System (reaches over 
18,000 people) , local universities (inclusive of UTSW) , and our institutional participant database. Participants 
must be free from underlying serious medical  conditions (detailed via medical history, physical exam), non -
smokers, have a body mass index less than 33 kg/m2, and will be excluded if they have any  current  
cardiometabolic  diseases (e.g., diabetes, heart disease). Individuals who are pregnant, planning to become 
pregnant, or breastfeeding will be excluded. We will also exclude those with a history of drug abuse.  
 
As described above, all participants will complete an informed consent and screening for eligibility.  
Participants will be randomized to complete  either the  sufentanil  or placebo trial  first. During these 
experimental visits, we will administer two assessments of pain perception (described in greater detail below), 
then administer sufentanil sublingually or a placebo pill also sublingually, perform the simulate hemorrhagic 
tolerance assessment (lower -body negative pressure), and then re -assess the measures of pain perception.  
 
The setting for all visits will be the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine. Trials will be conducted 
in controlled laboratory settings.  During the experimental visits ( sufentanil  and placebo), we will record 
baseline cardiovascular measures. UT -Southwestern anesthesiologist Joseph Hendrix, MD, or a research 
nurse (with direct oversight from Dr. Hendrix ) will administer sufentanil  (30 microgram tablet ) or placebo tablet  
during each experimental visit  (i.e., participants will receive only one 30  microgram tablet of sufentanil ).  We 
will assess brachial blood pressure, nervous system activity via ultrasound -guided microneurography from 
the upper arm , beat -to-beat arterial blood pressure via photoplethysmography,  cerebral perfusion via 
transcranial Doppler, limb blood flow via Doppler ultrasound, heart rate via electrocardiogram, respiration rate 
and end -tidal CO 2 via capnography from a nasal cannula, peripheral oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry, 
compensatory reserve via photoplethysmography, and plasma catecholamine concentrations from serial 
blood samples collected throughout the visit  (~4 tablespoons per experimental visit). In addition, both before 
and after sufentanil/placebo administration, pain perception will be accessed via a cold pressor test (2 -3

V2Mar2018  minutes of a hand placed in a water/ice slurry) and via a pressure algometer assessment (pressure applied 
to the hand to the point if discomfort).  
 
Data analysis will be performed as done previously in Dr. Craig Crandall’s laboratory  in companion studies 
addressing the same questions but with ketamine (STU 092017 -068), fentanyl (STU 092017 -069), and 
morphine (STU 092017 -070). Specifically, we will compare cardiovascular data (inclusive of nervous system 
activity data) between time points (baseline and post -drug/placebo administration ) and conditions.   We will 
also assess tolerance to the simulated hemorrhage challenge between sufentanil and placebo tri als. All data 
will be analyzed while blind to condition and with proper co -variate analysis  
 
Personal health  information  (PHI)  that is collected will be kept in a key -lock filing cabinet in a key -lock room 
only accessible to study team members within a numeric -padlocked laboratory . As described in the eIRB 
portal, a  coded number  system will be used in p lace of the participants name to de -identify their research 
information  collected . A participant ID key, only accessible to study team members, will link the participants 
‘information with the coded number.  Additionally, we follow all applicable University of Texas Southwestern 
IRB and Institute of Exercise and Environmental Medicine  (i.e., where the research will take place)  guidelines 
for protecting research participant privacy.  
 
Up to 60 participants  are anticipated to enroll in this study. No study has evaluated the effects of sufentanil 
on lower -body negative pressure (LBNP) tolerance in humans.  The power and sample size estimates are 
based on findings from Dr. Crandall’s laboratory showing reduced LBNP tolerance in the heat -stressed 
individuals. In that study heat stressed reduced LBNP tolerance by ~70% (P<0.001).  Though we expect 
sufentanil to likewise reduce LBNP tolerance, we do not anticipate as large of a reduction as tha t observed 
with heat stress.  The power analysis was calculated  using G*Power  [Ttests  – Means:  Difference between 
two dependent means (matched pairs)] using  an estimated reduction in the cumulative stress index to 
sufentanil of 25% relative to LBNP tolerance of a normothermic subjects taking a placebo  (i.e., placebo: 
988±402 units; sufentanil: 741±300 units) .  These predictions resulted in an effect size of 0.68.  Having a 
correlation  of 0.5 , with a study power=0.80 at an adjusted alpha=0.05,  yielded an estimated subject size of 
15 individuals .  That value was inflated to 30 subjects (15 m ale and 15 female) to permit a comparison in the 
primary responses within sexes. Given the potential for subject dropouts, we propose  to recruit up to  60 
individuals to obtain complete datasets from 30 subjects. Since  the effects of sufentanil on  LBNP tolerance  
has never been assessed , the indicated values  are estimates and thus interim power analyses will be 
performed, with the number of required subjects adjusted based upon the variance of the obtained data.

5.  Safety Precautions.  (Describe safeguards to address the serious risks listed above.)  
a.  Describe the procedures for protecting against or minimizing any potential risks for each of the more 
than minimal risk research procedures  listed above.  
Sufentanil  administration:  30 micrograms of sufentanil  will be administered  once during  one of the two 
experimental visits.  The product that will be used will be a DsuviaTM sublingual tablet, or similarly packaged 
placebo.  
Risks and their mitigation : After sufentanil administration , it is possible participants will temporarily (e.g.,  
to several minutes) experience low blood pressure, high heart rate, disorientation, become tired or dizzy, 
and/or develop a headache. While some individuals may feel discomfort from one or more of these 
sensations, it is expected that they will subside  within a few minutes . In rare cases subjects  may become 
nauseous or vomit. In extremely rare conditions individuals may have difficulty breathing. In such extreme 
cases,  when medical treatment is needed, w e will immediately stop testing and monitor the participant 
until all vital signs are within safe limits. Naloxone will completely reverse all opioid effects within 2 
minutes  of IV administration and 5 minutes of intramuscular administration . However, at the dose in the 
study proposed, we do not expect that significant respiratory depression will occur.  We will monitor the 
patient's vital signs continuously.  We will monitor pulse oximetry and end tidal carbon dioxide 
continuously. These two  monitors will provide sufficient accuracy and robustness to administer this 
medication safely.  An anesthesiologist will be present whenever sufentanil is administered  to observe 
and intervene should the patient exhibit the slightest evidence of respirato ry depression well before any

STU2021 -0579, Crandall, FormA -Protocol, Mod_7, 08 -18-23  9 
V2Mar2018  patient danger should arise.  Standard airway intervention equipment will always be readily available . We 
have safely performed similar trials, using identical experimental procedures, with ketamine (STU 
092017 -068), fentanyl (STU 092017 -069), and morphine (STU 092017 -070) administrations without major 
complications in 40+ young adults in the previous two ye ars. 
 
Upon the conclusion of the protocol, subjects will not be permitted to leave the laboratory until all of the 
following discharge variables are met:  
• The subject presents with an Aldrete score (post -anesthesia discharge scoring system) matching 
baseline,  
• The subject demonstrates a awareness of time, person, and place and is able to answer 
questions appropriately  
• The subject is able to stand up and walk for 5 minutes without assistance (supervised)  
• The subject is able to drink water and eat crackers without reports of nausea  
• The subject able to void   
To be consistent with THR/UTSW hospital guidelines —the subject will be required to have a responsible 
adult bring them home.  The responsible adult can either drive the subject home or accompany the 
subject home using ground transportation (bus, train, ube r, or taxi service).  The subject will also receive 
the recommendation to have someone observe them for the rest of the day and overnight.  
 
Lower -body negative pressure (LBNP) : LBNP to pre -syncope will be used to simulate a hemorrhagic 
injury. LBNP is performed by the subject lying on a table with their lower body (from iliac crest) inside an 
airtight container.  A vacuum source is connected to that container.  40 mmHg negative pressure  will 
initially be applied  to the chamber  for 3 min, with this pressure decreasing  by 10 mmHg every 3 min until 
signs and/or symptoms of pre -syncope are observed (e.g.,  bradycardia, sustained systolic blood pressure 
<80 mmHg, nausea, lightheadedness, and/or diaphoresis) . This approach is a validated method to 
simulate  a hemorrhagic challenge  (see PMID: 15016789).  Dr. Crandall’s laboratory has performed this 
procedure on hundreds of individuals (inclusive of 40+ individuals who received ketamine, morphine, or 
fentanyl) without any adverse incidents.  
Risks and their mitigation : The possible risks of this procedure are light -headedness, feeling faint, nausea 
and rarely a subject may faint. If this occurs, the procedure will be stopped  and the subject will begin to 
feel better almost immediately.  
 
Cold pressor test:   This widely used technique for pain assessment presents minimal risk.  For this test, 
immersion of the hand in ice cold water will elicit painful sensations as well as an increase in blood 
pressure.   
Risks and their mitigation : These typical responses are immediately reduced to pretest levels with the 
removal of the subject’s hand from the ice water.  The maximum duration for this test is three minutes and 
the subject can voluntarily remove the hand from the ice water at any time .   
 
Pressure algometry : This pain assessment technique is conducted by applying the rubber tip of a hand -
held digital algometer on the subject’s digit.  Force will be gradually increased and the peak force is 
recorded when the subject first reports a painful sensation.   
Risks and their mitigation : Removal of the  applied  pressure immediately relieves the painful sensation , 
and the subject can voluntarily stop the test at any time. A pre -set maximum  of 3 kg of pressure will 
ensure there is no damage to the tissue.    
 
Microneurography:  Nerve signals from the nerves in the arm [i.e. median nerve (inside portion of the 
middle part of the arm), radial nerve (inside portion of the forearm), or posterior cutaneous nerve (outside 
portion of the forearm)] will be measured. To locate the nerves, we use ultrasound imaging. When the nerve 
is located, we insert a small sterile needle (an electrode about the size of an acupuncture needle) through 
the skin. The participant  may feel some slight discomfort during needle insertion. The recording needle is 
advanced into the nerve. When the tip of the needle enters the nerve, the participant  may notice a tingling, 
Form A

STU2021 -0579, Crandall, FormA -Protocol, Mod_7, 08 -18-23  10 
V2Mar2018  pins and needles, cramping, or dull achy sensation. A second needle serves as a reference electrode and 
is inserted just under the skin, a couple of inches away from the nerve. Once the needles are in place it is 
extremely unlikely the participant  will feel any discomfort. This method of recording nerve signals in human 
participants has been used in over 3000 studies since 1979. We have performed over 300 recordings in 
our laboratory without any major complications. In rare cases, individuals may have tende rness, soreness, 
or numbness in the nerve recording area for a few days that subsides without treatment.  
Risks and their mitigation:  Consistent with published guidelines for microneurography, we will limit the nerve 
search time (from needle insertion until an adequate signal is acquired) to 60 minutes. Also, we will not 
record from the same nerve within one 28 -day period. While not ant icipated, we will stop this technique if 
they feel too much discomfort from microneurography. Participants will be instructed not to perform heavy 
lifting and to avoid rubbing/massaging the upper arm for ~24 hours to reduce the potential for inflammation -
related acute neuropathy (occurs in fewer than 1% of cases).  
 
Blood draws : A sterile catheter will be inserted into an arm vein for blood collection of plasma 
catecholamine concentrations.  A total of ~8 tablespoons of blood will be withdrawn across all visits.   
Risks and their mitigation:  There is a small risk of infection and a still smaller risk of a blood clot or breakage 
of the catheter. The likelihood of these complications is remote (less than 1 in 10,000) when the procedure 
is carried out by trained personnel and proper equipment is used, as during this study. There is also a small 
risk of the catheter perforating the vein or not being inserted into a blood vessel. The partic ipant may have 
discomfort, bleeding, and/or bruising and on rare occasions, a perso n may feel dizzy or faint.  
 
Health history assessment : Participants will fill out a survey  related to their physical well-being.  
Risks and their mitigation:  It is possible individuals may feel uncomfortable while completing this survey. 
We will ensure all participants are aware of this procedure during the informed consent visit. If a participant 
is uncomfortable completing all of the survey, they will be reminded that 1) their participation is entirely 
voluntary, 2) that only study investigators will have access to the surveys and their results, and 3) only de -
identified results will be shared in scientific meetings and/or in future scientific manuscripts.  
 
 
b.  Where appropriate, discuss provisions for ensuring necessary medical or professional intervention in 
the event of adverse events, or unanticipated problems involving subjects.  
When the participant is undergoing any testing, they will be supervised by an ACLS trained nurse and/or 
physician.  Of note, a board -certified anesthesiologist will always be present when sufentanil is 
administered.  There is a fully stocked “crash cart” with a defibrillator and medications  (including naloxone)  
within 50 feet of the laboratory. IV anti -arrhythmic medications  are rapidly available if a sustained but not 
life-threatening arrhythmia were to occur.  Airway management equipment is also stocked in t hat cart.  
Furthermore, the Texas Health Resource Emergency Room is minutes away if an escalation of care is 
required.  
 
Upon screening, participants will be given contact information for a nurse to contact in case any adverse 
event occurs following discharge from experimental days. However, this is unlikely to occur given the 
short -acting effects of sufentanil  and the fact that participants are not discharged until vital signs are 
similar to that of baseline values . 
 
c.  Will the safeguards be different between/among groups?   
 
 Yes 
  
 No 
 
 
 
Statistical Analysis  
Data was assessed for normality and are presented as means ± SD or medians [interquartile 
ranges], when appropriate. Based on our prior data investigating pharmacologic agents’ effects 
on tolerance to LBNP (12, 24, 25) , a sample size of n = 15 was estimated, but to maintain 
consistency with the previous studies, we recruited 29 individuals. Paired t -tests or Wilcoxon 
Signed -Rank tests were used for all paired comparisons (e.g., Urine -specific gravity, CSI, pain 
ratings, differences in CSI b etween the sexes etc.). Plasma catecholamine concentrations were 
compared between trials (placebo vs. sufentanil) using mixed -effects model analyses. 
Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular responses were evaluated every 30 seconds for the cold

 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONAL FOR THE STUDY  
Each year influenza  virus is associated with  approximately 5,546 deaths in adults ≥65 years in 
the United States.1 The reasons for the disproportionate morbidity and mortality of influenza in 
older individuals are not well defined, and  they increase  with age.2 In fact , persons aged 85 
years and older are 32 times more likely to die of influenza and associated pneumonia than 
those  only 65-69 years of age.2 Annual influenza vaccination has been recommended for adults 
≥65 years3 of age since 1960 to reduce  excess morbidity and mortality in older adults. However,  
a steady and systemic declined in the immune system  with increasing age, termed 
Immunosenescence ,4 appears to reduce vaccine effectiveness (VE)  in older adults .5 
The reasons for decreasing response to vaccination with age are multifactorial and may be related 
to changes in adaptive immune responses, including decreased T cell  6-8 and B cell  9,10 function. 
T cell phenotypic changes associated with aging include a gradual loss of CD4+ and CD8+ naïve 
cells 11, and an accumulation of late -stage differentiated CD4+ and CD8+ memory cells with loss 
of CD28 expression6,12-14. CD28 is a costimulatory molecule required for activation, proliferation, 
and differentiation of T cells  15.  
Immune senescence  is defined as phenotypic and functional changes in T cell populations 
associated with aging. These include skewing of the phenotype of CD4+ and CD8+ T  cells toward 
a “late stage differentiated” phenotype, characterized by lack of expression of the costimulatory 
molecules CD27 and CD28  16. Expansion of this T cell phenotype has been associated with 
cytomegalovirus (CMV)  seropositivity and CMV antigen recognition 17, suggesting an ant igen 
driven expansion of these cell  population s. Despite their decreased proliferative ability, these cells 
are functional, as they are still able to produce cytokines and maintain lytic capability (expressi ng 
granzyme and perforin)  17-22. Poor vaccine responses in older persons have been linked to 
expansion of memory T cell populations with decreased CD28 expression, elevated levels of 
exhaustion markers (increased PD -1, CTLA -4 and LAG -3), and an accumulation of T cells with 
decreased proliferative potential (increased CD57 and KLRG1)  23-26. 
Herpesvirus infection is ubiquitous in humans, and is relevant for immune senescence and agin g. 
It is estimated that >90% of the adult population globally is infected with at least one HHV .27 These 
include herpes simplex virus (HSV), CMV , varicella zoster virus , and other HHV. In 
immunocompetent persons, most of these are latent infections that do not contribute to overt 
clinical disease over the course of a life time. There is mounting evidence, however, that 
maintaining HHV latency comes at a cost to the immune system, even in the immunocompetent 
host 27. CMV is a beta herpesvirus, and like the other viruses in this family, causes chronic latent 
infection  28,29. The incidence of CMV seropositivity increases with age  28,30 -32, and ha s been 
associated with poor responses to influenza vaccination in elderly  individuals 12,33, and with 
reports of negative 34 and beneficial 35 effects in young individua ls. The links between CMV 
infection and influenza vaccine response therefore are not straightforward. A recent study 
evaluated antibody responses to a new antigen strain (H1N1pdm in 2009) in adults 18 -52 years 
and found diminished antibody responses associ ated with age, but not with CMV infection 36. Poor 
immune responses in the setting of chronic CMV infection have been linked to accumulation of 
late-stage differentiated senescent T cells with diminished helper function12,22,33,37 38.  
The mechanism by which CMV infection may alter the host’s response to new infections or 
vaccination is not clear. However, the chronic nature of the infection leads to a feature of the 
immune response term ed “memory inflation”. C lassical CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cell responses 
against viruses expand during primary infection and contract to low magnitud es during post 
infection resolution 18. However, CD8+ T cell responses to select epitopes of human CMV (HCMV)  
39,40, rhesus CMV 41, and murine CMV (MCMV) 42,43 persist for decades at very high magnitudes 
after primary infection or during latency. This phenomenon is termed “memory inflation” and has

 been best characterized among CMV - specific CD8+ T cells that consist primarily of CD45RO+ 
CCR7 - CD27- T cells (effector memory T cells [T EM]) and their  CD45RA+ revertants, CD45RO - 
CCR7 - CD27 - T cells (effector memory RA+ [T EMRA]) 21,44 -47. We have recently identified this same 
feature of CMV -specific CD4+ T cells 19. We will evaluate CD4+ CMV -specific T cell memory 
inflation in this cohort of elderly influenza participants to determine whether it contributes to poor 
vaccine responses.   
The term “older adults” represents a diverse population  of individuals  over 65 years of age 
ranging from physically and mentally fit to physically and/or cognitively -impaired with very 
different requirements for daily care ranging from those who are entirely independent to those 
who must rely on others for their complete care . Hence when performing studies in older adults, 
it is essential to describe the population being studied in explicit detail to interpret study results 
and for generalizability of findings. One key characteristic of older adults that may differ greatly 
is the degree of frailty. Frailty is the conceptualization of a phenotype of poor physiologic 
reserve and poor resistance to stressors and hence is associated with a high risk of morbidity 
and death from diseases.48 One of the most accepted methods to measure frailty is one 
described by Fried et al,49 that is operationalized by declines in lean body mass, strength, 
endurance, balance, walking performance, and low activity.  Frailty as a syndrome in the 
geriatric population encompasse s a person’s chronic medical conditions, functional status, and 
risk of mortality.50 Frailty may be a better predictor of the immune response in older adults than 
chronologic age.51 In previous studies, frailty scales have predicted vaccine r esponse to 
polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine better than age 52 and to be correlated with poor 
antibody response to influenza vaccination.53  
Immune responses to both influenza and influenza vaccines are moderated by prior exposure to 
influenza and influenza vaccines. The original concept w as called antigenic sin54 but recently 
has been termed i mprinting .55 Influenza A viruses can b e divided into two phylogenetic groups.  
The first influenza A group that a person is exposed to will provide better protection for the 
remaining influenza viruses within the group but not in the other group.55  The birth cohort 
ranging from 1918 to 1957 is the majo rity of the population ≥65 years of age was first exposed 
to an H1N1 virus leaving this birth cohort at increased morbidity and mortality to H3N2 group 
viruses.    
The current circulating H3N2 has adapted well to humans and evades antibody binding by  
glyco sylating common antigenic sites. These same glycosylations make growth for vaccine 
production in eggs difficult.  Egg adaption can change the vaccine strain less well -matched to 
the circulating strain.  
As a strategy to increase immunogenicity of influenza  vaccines, FDA approved high -dose (HD) 
influenza vaccine (Fluzone® High -Dose , IIV-HD) contain ing 4-times more hemagglutinin (HA)  
(60µg HA/strain)  than the  standard -dose (SD) vaccine (15µ g HA/strain) for people aged ≥ 65 
years in 2009 .56 In clinical trials, the high dose vaccine demonstrated significantly higher HAI 
antibody (Ab) responses (seroconversion and seroprotection rates) without  an increase in 
clinically relevant systemic adverse reactions, but a slight increase in local reactions.57 The 
large phase IIIb/IV study of HD, led by Dr. Talbot, showed improved clinical efficacy with a 
relative VE of 24%. In 2015, the FDA appro ved an MF-59 adjuvan ted inactivated influenza 
vaccine  (FLUAD™ , aIIV ) for the same population of older adults . The adjuvanted vaccine, 
FLUAD , has been in use in Europe  for over 25 years with an excellent  safety and tolerability  
experience.58 The effective ness of the MF -59 adjuvanted vaccine was compared with standard 
influenza vaccine and was found to be 63% more effective .59 A recombinant inactivated 
influenza vaccine (rIIV)comprised of 45mcg hemagglutinin per strain (total of 180mcg) was 
licensed for use in the United States in 2013. Likely due to the higher dose of antigen, the rIIV  
was shown to have higher efficacy in adult s ≥50 years of age in a trial during the 2014 -2015

 season.60  At this time , the, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends all 
adults ≥65 years of age receive an influenza vaccine but does not preferentially recommend any 
vaccine for this population.  
2.0 Specific Aims:  
Studies of immune function in elderly popul ations have been limited. We propose to advance 
multiple high -priority fields simultaneously: T cell immunology, immunologic aging and immune 
senescence, precision medicine and vaccine responses, and the relationship between cellular 
immune responses to ch ronic CMV infection and response to influenza vaccination in 
immunocompetent older populations.  
Specific Aim 1.  To perform HAI and microneutralizat ion assay individuals who receiving influenza 
vaccine.  
Specific aim 2 . Determine whether profile of immune senescence is  predictive of vaccine 
responses in elderly individuals receiving IIV -HD, aIIV3  or rIIV. 
Specific aim 3 . Determine whether inflated CMV -specific immune responses in elderly 
populations are responsible for  the immune senescence profile of elderly individuals and limits 
their ability to mount immune responses to vaccines  
Specific aim 4 . Determine whether measures of frailty are associated with immune senescence 
and decreased ability to respond to vaccines.

 5.0 Study procedures : 
Data Collection:  During the first year of the study, the following forms will be designed to 
complete the objectives of this study.  
1. REDCap Case Report Form : Administered by the  enrollers , and includes: demographics; 
height and weight; p ast medical history ; history of recent falls and hospitalizations; active  
medications ; alcohol use ; use of home oxygen;  questions regarding ability to perform 
activities of daily activity;  frailty measure s (see section on Frailty Metrics); sarcopenia 
assessment; depression symptom screen; cognitive assessment;  and contact information for  
the participant.  
2. Frailty Metrics:  As mentioned earlier, the evaluation of frailty  is very important in the 
assessment of vaccine responses. Frailty can be measured by multiple methods. One of the 
most accepted tools is the Fried Frailty Evaluation.49 This tool evaluates shrinkage (loss of 
mean body mass), weakness, endurance, slowness, and physical activity on a scale of 0 -5. 
This tool is predictive of falls, worsening mobility or disability in the activities of daily living, 
and in predicting hospita lization and death over a three -year period. This measure of frailty 
is not synonymous with comorbidities or functional status. A composite frailty measure will 
be calculated using each  of the evaluation scales and utilized  to compare the safety profile 
and ultimately the immune responses .61 This measure will be based on  the five parameters 
of weight loss, exhaustion, low activity level, slowness, and weak strength, described below.   
1. Weight Loss  Meets criteria for frailty if answers yes to:  
Self-report of loss of >10 pounds unintentionally over the past year 
2. Exhaustion  Meets criteria for frailty if answers:  
Self-report of “moderate” or “most of the time” for either:  
1. I felt that everything I did was an effort in the last week:  
a. Rarely or none of the time (<1 day)  
b. Some or little of the time (1 -2 days)  
c. Moderate amount of the time (3 -4 days)  
d. Most of the time  
 
2. I could not get going in the last week:  
a. Rarely or none of the time (<1 day)  
b. Some or little of the time (1 -2 days)  
c. Moderate amount of the time (3 -4 days)  
d. Most of the time  
3. Low Activity Level  Meets criteria for frailty if answers:  
Self-reported “limited a lot” for:  
Does your health limit vigorous activities such as running, lifting heavy objects, 
or participating in strenuous sports?  
a. No, not at all  
b. Yes, limited a little  
c. Yes, limited a lot  
4. Slowness  Meets criteria for frailty if:  
Time to walk 15 feet (4.57 meters) at usual pace (averaged over 2 trials)  
Men                                                 Women                
> 7sec for height < 173cm               > 7sec for height < 159cm  
> 6sec for height > 173cm               > 6sec for height > 159cm

 5. Weakness  Meets criteria for frailty if:  
Grip strength measured by hand dynamometer (averaged over 3 trials of 
dominant hand):  
Men                                                 Women                
< 29kg for BMI < 24                        < 17kg for BMI < 23                
< 30kg for BMI 24.1 -26                   < 17.3kg for BMI 23.1 -26                
< 30kg for BMI 26.1 -28                   < 18kg for BMI 26.1 -29               
< 32kg for BMI >28                         < 21kg for BMI >29                
(BMI: body mass index)  
Participants with total scores of 3 or  greater meet criteria for frailty. Those participants  with a 
higher composite score (and therefore a greater degree of frailty) will be expected to have lower 
reactogenicity to vaccine and likely a lower serologic response , but this hypothesis will be 
tested. 
3. Five-times Sit -to-Stand (5STS) Test for Sarcopenia.  All participants will be undergo two 
trials of timed duration to go from sitting position to standing position and back to sitting five 
times. The average of the 2 trials will be used for the result.  The 5STS is a routinely -used 
geriatric assessment for sarcopenia and fall risk. An average 5STS time of >12 seconds is 
indicative of fall risk  62.  
4. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) : The MoCA is a validated, performance -
based tool used to detect cognitive impairment with score ranges from 0 to 30 points. It will 
be administered at enrollment. The following ranges may be used to grade severity: 18 -26 = 
mild cognitive impairment, 10 -17 = moderate cognitive impairment and < 10 = severe 
cognitive impairment. This tool will be included as many geriatricians feel cognitive 
impairment is often associated with frailty. As presence of depressive symptoms may affect 
cognition and memory, we will also include a depression symptom screen as part of the 
assessment. All participants  will complete the Patient Health Questionnaire  as part of 
routine care.  The results of the Patient Health Questionnaire  performed during routine 
medical care will be included in the chart review . 
5. Baseline clinical laboratory assessment  
At the first visit, blood specimen collection will also include evalution of two clinical tests to 
be conducted by the Vanderbilt Laboratory: CMV serology  and CD4/CD8 lymphocyte ratio 
calculation.  Detection of  serum CMV IgM and IgG antibodies will be cond ucted on all 
participants. Calculation of absolute CD4 and absolute CD8 lymphocytes will also be 
performed using the clinical lab for calculation of CD4/CD8 ratio. Inversion of the CD4/CD8 
in older adults has been found to correlate with measures of adapti ve immune senescence , 
CMV seropositive,  as well as frailty and falls  63-65.

Recruitment and Retention: Although most industry -sponsored vaccine studies in older adults 
seek to recruit a very healthy, mobile population, in this study we will pay special attention to the 
enrollment of older adults ≥80 years of age and those who are frail  so we can get a more 
comprehensive assess ment of  the safety and immunogenicity of these two vaccines in a larger 
spectrum of older adults . The population in Davidson County  is 61% white and 27% black  with 
37,787 woman and 25 ,574 men ≥65 years of age  who reside in the County .  
Informed Consent in Older adults:  Previous research conducted by our group to identify viral 
respiratory disease in hospitalized patients has led our team to work closely with our Institutional 
Review Board to improve the consenting process for older adult s. Consents have been 
simplified to include only necessary information and they are printed in larger fonts. Each 
enroller also utilizes magnifiers and hearing amplifiers to assist the participant s. In addition, we 
also have utilized a standardized assessm ent to determine a person’s ability to self -consent 
wherein they are asked specific questions to determine their understanding of the consent form. 
These practices will be used for the proposed study.

Approximately 100 adults ≥65 years of age will be enrolled.  After consent, blood and serum will 
be collected and then subjects will be randomized to either high dose influenza vaccine  or 
adjuvanted influenza vaccine  (both FDA approved vaccines).  Vaccination will be done by an 
unblinded nurse.  All further evaluations and analysis will be done by a blinded staff member.  
Medical history, relevant medications, and frailty  status will be assessed at the first visit.  
Subjects will return (Table 3) for blood and serum draws on days  7 (+/- 2 days), 28 ( -4/+14 
days) and for an optional visit at 6 months/180 days (+/ - 14 days)  (after influenza season).   
Influenza vaccination  
The ACIP recommends influenza vaccine for all adults ≥65 years of age. This includes the egg -
based vaccines, the cell -based vaccines and the recombinant vaccines. This study will use the 
egg-based high -dose inactivated influenza  (IIV-HD), the egg -based adjuva nted influenza 
vaccine  (aIIV) , and the recombinant influenza vaccine  (rIIV) . Each of these vaccines are 
recommended and licensed in adults ≥65 years of age and will be used in this study according 
to licensure.

 Subjects Randomized : Subjects will be rando mized 1:1 :1 using the REDCap System, hosted 
at Vanderbilt. Since this is a web -based system, Randomization in REDCap allows users to 
create their custom allocation list, which will serve as a lookup table for deciding how to 
randomize subjects. First, user s will set up their randomization model and all its parameters, 
after which REDCap will provide some examples of how to set up the allocation table. The 
randomization table must be generated outside of REDCap using other software (e.g., SAS, 
Stata, R) before users will finally upload it. By letting users create their own allocation table 
outside of REDCap, they can structure their allocations and assignments (e.g., block sizes, 
permutations, stratification balancing). The figure below demonstrates the optio ns to set up the 
randomization model.  
 
 
6.0 Laboratory Methods   
Specimen processing for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs):  
Blood will be collected from a vein. Study personnel will collect the blood samples, label without 
personal identifiers, and deliver to the  VUMC Cell Processing Core (Directed by Dr. Kalams)  for 
preparation of serum  and and isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Serum 
will be frozen until further testing at Vanderbilt University Medical Center for HAI, MN testing, B 
and T cell influenza -specific responses. Processing, cryopreservation, storage , and 
maintenance of sample logs will be done according to standard operating procedures that have 
been in place and maintained for over 15 years  All clini cal labs will be sent to the local lab.  
Specimen processing for serum:  
Whole blood drawn in a tube without anticoagulant will be left at room temperature for a 
minimum of 30 minutes and maximum of 2 hours.  The samples will then be placed at 4ºC.  

VERSION : 4.0

 Samples will be processed within 24 hours of collection.  Tubes will be placed in a table top 
centrifuge and serum will be clarified by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4ºC . 
Serum will be aliquotted into labeled cryovials with an adjustable pipette.  Aliquot size will be 
determined based on the testing to be performed.  Serum will then be stored at –80ºC in labeled 
fiberboard boxes until shipping or testing is performed.  
HAI Assay:   
The hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) assay is adapted from the CDC laboratory -based 
influenza surveillance manual and we have extensive experience in its use. Briefly, three parts 
of receptor destroying enzyme (RDE) will be added to one part sera and incubated overnight in 
a 37°C water bath.  Then the RDE will be inactivat ed by incubation in a 56°C water bath for 30 
minutes.  Following inactivation of RDE, PBS will be added to the sample for a final serum 
concentration of 1:10.  Turkey red blood cells (RBC) will be washed twice and diluted in PBS to a 
final concentration of 5 % RBC. The cells are kept at 4°C and expire in one week. Twenty -five 
microliters of RDE -treated sera are then serially diluted across the plate (2 -fold).  Twenty -five 
microliters of prepared flu antigen tittered to 4HAU is added to the diluted sera. The pla tes are 
then incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes followed by the addition of 50 μl of 5% 
turkey RBC. Then, the plates are mixed and the RBCS are allowed to settle for 1 hour at room 
temperature.  The test will be read by observing a lack of aggluti nation in the button RBC that is 
settled in the bottom of the well. The HAI titer is determined by the reciprocal dilution of the last 
well with lack of agglutination.  Every plate will have a virus and a serum control. The virus 
control will consist of PBS  + 4HAU of antigen + turkey RBC.  The cell control will consist of PBS 
+ RBC.  A negative titer is reported as a <10.  All samples are tested in duplicate and results are 
expected to be +/ - one well.  If duplicate results are more than one well different the s ample will 
be repeated. The lower of the two results within one well will be recorded as the titer.  
7.0 Statistical Analysis:  
This is an exploratory study. Antibody titers will be compared pre - and post -vaccination on the 
samples collected.  Paired measures  of cell mediated immunity will be compared before and 
after vaccination. In addition, post -vaccination measures of cell mediated immunity will be 
compared across age strata and correlated with serologic response to vaccination. Analyses will 
be done accou nting for age, frailty , and underlying medical conditions.  
Data Management : All data will be collected and stored under the REDCap database system.  
This system is a secure web application for building and managing online surveys and 
databases. While REDCap can be used to collect virtually any type of data, it is specifically 
geared to support data capture for research studies. The REDCap Consortium is composed of 
1,920 active institutional partners  in 103 countries  who utilize and support REDCap in various 
ways including the CDC.  The REDCap application allows users to build and manage online 
surveys and databases quickly and securely, and is currently in production use  or development 
build -status for more than 273,000 projects  with over 372,000 users  spanning numerous 
research focus areas across the consortium. This system will allow each site to access the 
database and will provide a secure means to send a study datase t without personal identifiers 
upon request  to the CDC .

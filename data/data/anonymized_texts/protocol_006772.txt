4 BACKGROUND AND DOSE SELECTION
4.1 Introduction
This is a protocol for a human research study. Th is study is being conducted according to US and 
international standards of Good Clinical Practice  (GCP) (Food & Drug Administration [FDA] Title 
21 Part 312 and International Conference on Ha rmonisation [ICH] guidelines), applicable 
government regulations, and Instituti onal research policies and procedures.
4.2 Considerations for Studies of Epilepsy
According to the World Health Organization, ep ilepsy afflicts more than 50 million people 
worldwide.1Epilepsy leads to an increased risk of inju ry from accidents and an increased rate of 
mortality and has a significant impact on qualit y of life. First-generation antiepileptic drugs 
(AEDs) are still commonly used, even though they can produce a diversity of serious adverse 
events (SAEs). New AEDs approved since the ear ly 1990s have shown an improved tolerability 
profile. Nonetheless, approximately 30% of epilepsy ca ses, particularly those with partial seizures, 
are refractory to treatment. Many of these patien ts are taking multiple antiepileptic drugs. It is 
important to understand any interaction that occurs between them as well as the long term safety 
profile of YKP3089 when given as adjunctive therapy.
Choice of add-on (adjunctive) design. The initial evaluation of a new antiepileptic drug generally 
includes a determination of its efficacy in reduci ng the frequency of seizures in adults who are 
refractory to treatment with other AEDs.2,3,4Because of the risk of exacerbation of seizure severity 
and frequency upon withdrawal of long-term AED therapy, even in the refractory population, the 
new AED under study is added to the existing therapy instead of being used as monotherapy.
Because partial seizures represent the most co mmon type in both adults and children and claim a 
disproportionate share of medically refractory cases, they have been the most frequently selected 
seizure type in the investigation of new AEDs.

Page 67 of 1354.3 Background 
4.3.1 YKP3089 Structure
YKP3089 is (R)-(+)-1-(2-chloro-phenyl)-2-tetraz ol-2-yl-ethyl ester, which has the chemical 
formula C 10H10Cl N 5.YKP3089 is being provided in tablets that contain 50 or 100 mg of the 
active ingredient. It is a novel small molecule of molecular weight 267.68. Its structure is shown 
inFigure 1.
Figure 1. Structure of YKP3089
YKP3089 is a novel small molecule with open IN Ds for epilepsy (76,809), neuropathic pain (IND 
108,178), and anxiety (IND 72,741). It is currently in Phase 2 of development as an antiepileptic 
agent for partial onset seizures. YKP3089 was show n to be active in standard animal models of 
epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and anxiety when administered orally. 
4.4 Pharmacology
Receptor test systems have shown that YKP3089 does not show significant activity at any of the 
classical receptor types (eg, adrenergic, GABA ergic) or pharmacologic receptors. However, in 
vitro electrophysiology assays showed YKP3089 to be an inhibitor of the slow inactivated state of 
sodium channels. YKP3089 may also increase inhibito ry synaptic transmission by facilitating the 
release of GABA.
4.4.1 Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion
In vitro studies with human microsomes revealed th at YKP3089 directly inhibited CYP2B6 (IC 50
= 280 μM), CYP2C19 (IC 50= 170 μM), and CYP3A4/5 (as measured by testosterone 6 β-
hydroxylation, IC 50= 890 μM; and midazolam 1 ′-hydroxylation, IC 50=720 μM). T hese IC 50

administration of YKP3089 by 67% (C max) and 84% (AUC) and plasma YKP3089 exposure (C max,
AUC) decreased with co-administration of phenyto in by 27 - 28%. Preliminary results of a drug 
interaction study examining the reciprocal  effects of phenobarbital and YKP3089, plasma 
phenobarbital exposure increased with co-administration of YKP3089 by 34% (C max) and 37%
(AUC) and plasma YKP3089 exposure (C max, AUC) decreased with co-administration of 
phenobarbital by 10-15% based on historical controls.
4.4.2 Safety Pharmacology and Toxicity Studies
YKP3089 has been assessed in a large number of safety pharmacology and toxicology studies 
including single-dose toxicity, repeat-dose toxicity, cardiotoxicity, genetic toxicity, and 
reproductive toxicity studies in animals. Safety ph armacology studies showed that the doses that 
produced beneficial central nervous system (CNS) effects of YKP3089 in animal models do not 
result in obvious negative effect s on the CNS. No evidence of cardiovascular effects was observed 
by telemetric electrocardiography in male monkeys. 
Details of the preclinical safety and toxicit y studies of YKP3089 can be found in the Investigator’s
Brochure. The most common AEs in preclinical studies of YKP3089 involved the central nervous 
system (CNS).
Reproductive toxicity studies showed adverse effects on reproductive performance when the 
dosage of YKP3089 was high enough to induce maternal toxicity, as evidenced by decreased food 
consumption and decreased body weight. However, there was no evidence of teratogenicity.
The results of standard genotoxicity studies of Y KP3089 were negative. There is no evidence of 
carcinogenicity in standard testing of two rodent species.
4.4.3 Clinical Safety and Efficacy
Cumulatively, 953 subjects have been exposed to  YKP3089 in a total of 14 Phase 1 and 3 Phase 2 
clinical studies.
The results of the first completed double-blind, ra ndomized, placebo-controlled trial in subjects 
with partial epilepsy demonstrated that tr eatment with 200 mg of YKP3089 produced a highly 
statistically significant reduction in the frequenc y of partial onset seizures (Table 2) and seizure 
free rates (Table 3). YKP3089 was generally well-tolerated.  The rate of adverse event withdrawals 
was similar between the YKP3089 a nd placebo groups.  No life threatening serious adverse events 
were identified among YKP3089-treated subj ects. The most common central nervous system 
adverse events in the YKP3089 group were somno lence, dizziness, fatigue, and gait disorder.
The second randomized, double-blind, placebo-cont rolled, dose response trial with a 18 week 
treatment period enrolled a total of 437 subjects , 108 in a 100 mg YKP3089 group, 110 in a 200 
mg YKP3089 group, 111 in a 400 mg YKP3089 group and 109 in a placebo group. The trial 
confirmed that treatment with 200 mg/day and 400mg/day of YKP3089 produces a highly

Page 73 of 135There have been three cases of DRES S syndrome in YKP3089 clinical studies.
Rash and hypersensitivity During the YKP3089 development program there have been other 
reports of rash and hypersensitivity reactions, some resulting in hospitalization and/or 
discontinuation. An aggregate analysis of the rate of rash/hypersensitivity and DRESS in subjects 
exposed to multiple doses of YKP3089 was performed Table 5.

The results of the aggregate analysis suggest that lower YKP3089 starting dose and slower 
titration rate are associated with lower risk of rash/hypersensitivity.  
xWhen YKP3089 dosing was increased weekly or faster, the rate of rash/hypersensitivity 
reactions was approximately 5%.  When YK P3089 was increased by 50 mg increments 
every 2 weeks, only one case (0.8%) of hypersensitivity reactions was observed.  
Two cases DRESS occurred when the first dose of YKP3089 was 100 mg (epilepsy study) or 
200 mg (healthy volunteer) followed by rapid titration.  The third case, in a healthy volunteer, 
occurred in a study where the initial dose of YKP3089 was 50 mg/day for 1 week followed by 50 
mg weekly increments. 
4.5 Rationale
4.5.1 Study Rationale
Approximately 30% of epilepsy cases, particularly those with partial seizures, are refractory to 
treatment. Many of these patients are taking mu ltiple antiepileptic drugs. It is important to 
understand any interaction that occurs between them  as well as the long term safety profile of 
YKP3089 when given as adjunctive therapy. 
Based on healthy volunteer studies with pheny toin and phenobarbital, YK P3089 increases plasma 
levels of phenobarbital and phenytoin levels. A portion of this open label safety and 
pharmacokinetic study is designed to understan d the impact of adding YKP3089 to an AED 
regimen including either phenytoin or phe nobarbital in subjects with partial epilepsy.
In addition this open label and pharmacokinetic study will enroll subjects taking concomitant 
AEDs other than phenytoin or phenobarbital to study long term safety and obtain population 
pharmacokinetic data.
A review of the YKP3089 safety  database confirmed three cases of DRESS syndrome among the 
953 subjects exposed to the drug. 
In order to further characterize the safety prof ile of YKP3089 while minimizing risk to patients, 
the following plan was developed:
1. Low starting dose (12.5 mg) and slower titration (dose increase every two weeks) 
2. Close monitoring (visits every two weeks) duri ng the first 4 months of treatment to allow 
early detection of suspected cases of hypersensitivity reaction  
3. Evaluation of suspected cases of hypersensitivity reaction to facilitate accurate diagnosis 
4. Care of subjects with hypersensitivity reactions to minimize consequences

Protocol YKP3089C021, Amendment 5 June 20, 2019 
Page 75 of 1354.5.2 Dose Justification
The target dose of 200 mg/day is based on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of YKP3089 in 
previously completed and ongoing studies.  
Initiating treatment with YKP3089 at 12.5 mg and th en increasing the dose every two weeks is 
likely to further reduce the risk of many side ef fects including hypersensitivity reactions. Slowing 
the titration rates of pharmaceuticals is a we ll-known procedure for mitigating risk of adverse 
reactions. Reducing the initial dose and slowin g the titration can reduce many central nervous 
system or gastrointestinal side effects.   It has b een demonstrated that lowe ring the initial dose and 
slowing the titration rate can mitiga te the occurrence of rash and possibly the rate of more serious 
and potentially life threatening adverse cutaneous reactions (Zaccara G, 2007). 
After initiating treatment with  YKP3089 for two weeks at 12.5 mg and then for two weeks at  
25mg YKP3089, subjects taking phenytoin or phenoba rbital will titrate YKP3089 upward at a rate 
of 50mg every other week to a target dose of 200mg/ day. This titration is appropriate for this 
portion of the study because of the known inte ractions between YKP3089 200mg and phenytoin 
and phenobarbital. Titrating by 50mg of YKP3089 ev ery other week to steady state will allow 
better understanding of the clinical impact of an y interaction and allow for dosage adjustment of 
phenytoin or phenobarbital.
Subjects taking concomitant AEDs other than ph enytoin or phenobarbital will titrate YKP3089 
upward at the same rate to a target dose of 200mg/day.
After reaching a target dose of 200mg, all subjects will be allowed to titrate up to a maximum dose 
of 400mg/day of YKP3089. A maximum dose of 400mg/day is justified by the additional efficacy 
seen in the subjects randomized to 400mg/day in the completed dose response study. Seizure free 
rate effect size in this group approached 20% during the maintenance phase.  
4.6 Potential Risks and Benefits
Cumulatively, 953 subjects have been exposed to  YKP3089 in a total of 14 Phase 1 and 3 Phase 2 
clinical studies.
The potential risks in this study includes,
1. Phenytoin dose related toxicity
2. Risk of phenytoin hypersensitivity syndrome
3. Phenobarbital dose related toxicity 
4. Rash / hypersensitivity related to YKP3089 exposure
5. DRESS syndrome related to YKP3089 exposure
6. YKP3089 dose related toxicities
Uncontrolled partial epilepsy is a life threatening disease with significant morbidity and elevated 
standard mortality rates.
The early signs and symptoms associated with hypersensitivity reaction that may progress to 
DRESS are readily identifiable by patients and clinicians. When detected and adequately 
managed, progression to DRESS can be prevented or reversed.   The potential benefits of
YKP3089 include significant partial seizure freq uency reduction and substantial seizure free 
rates (~18%) in patients who continue to suff er seizures despite history of treatment with 
multiple AEDs. The current benefit/risk profile in conjunction with the risk minimization 
measures support the enrollment of partial epilepsy patients into this open-label study to assess 
the profile of YKP3089 as a potential antiepileptic drug
5 STUDY OBJECTIVES

Page 77 of 1356 STUDY DESIGN
6.1 Overview
This multicenter, open label study in subjects wi th poorly controlled partial seizures will consist 
of a screening period, open-label titration phase , open label maintenance phase and a taper and 
follow up. At least 20 subjects taking phenytoin and at least 20 subjects taking phenobarbital will 
be enrolled. Additional subjects taking AEDs othe r than phenytoin or phenobarbital, will be 
enrolled in order to expose at least 1,000 subjects for 6 months to further evaluate long term safety.
6.1.1 Screening Period
The screening period for subjects on stable doses of phenytoin or stable doses of phenobarbital or 
stable doses of other concomitant AEDs will be up to 21 days. 
During Screening, assessments will be performed  according to the study assessments listed in 
Table 1 to determine eligibility for the study. Each  subject will be informed of his or her rights, 
and the subject or his or her legally authorized representative must sign an informed consent 
document indicating understanding of the purpose of the study and required procedures and 
indicating willingness to participate in the study.
6.1.2 Open label Treatment Period
The open label treatment period will consist of a 12 week titration phase followed by an open label 
maintenance phase.
6.1.2.1 Titration Phase
Subjects taking phenytoin or phenobarbital
The titration phase for subjects on stable doses of  phenytoin or stable doses of phenobarbital will 
be 12 weeks. During the 12-week up-titration phase, subjects will in crease YKP3089 dose every 
2 weeks to a target dose of 200mg/day as described in Table 6.

Prior to initiating YKP3089, subjects at US sites only will have trough concomitant AED levels
(oxcarbazepine, topiramate, lamotrigine, lacosam ide, clobazam, perampanel and levetiracetam
only) drawn at Visit 2. Sites must instruct the s ubject and schedule the visit accordingly to obtain 
a trough level. Also the blood must be coll ected before first dose of YKP3089.  To improve 
tolerability, the investigator may instruct the subject to take the dose of YKP3089 in the evening. 
The investigator may add, remove, or adjust th e dosage of any concomitant AEDs, as clinically 
indicated (see Table 8 below). Monotherapy with YKP3089 will not be allowed. If clinically 
indicated, titration can be stopped below 200mg/ day. A minimum dose of 50mg/day is necessary 
to continue in the study.

6.1.2.3 Taper and follow up
Subjects who are withdrawn from the open-label  treatment period will taper YKP3089 according 
to the schedule described in Table 10,  unless for safety reasons the investigator judges it necessary 
to discontinue study drug immediately. Fo r subjects taking phenytoin or phenobarbital, 
discontinuing YKP3089 may reduce the plasma c oncentration of these AEDs. Doses of phenytoin 
or phenobarbital may need to be adjusted as clinically indicated.

6.2 Study Endpoints
6.2.1 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
Sparse PK blood samples will be collected to evaluate YKP3089 and relevant concomitant AED 
exposure using a population pharmacokinetics approach. This will allow for the investigation of 
potential effects of covariates on the pharmacoki netics of YKP3089 or other concomitant AEDs. 
YKP3089 and other concomitant plasma concentrat ion data collected from this study will be 
pooled with relevant data from other YKP3089 clinical studies for population PK analysis.
6.2.2 Safety Endpoints
Safety will be assessed by the na ture, frequency, and severity of treatment-emergent spontaneously 
reported AEs, dropouts due to AEs, overall dropout rates, and changes fr om baseline in vital signs, 
physical exams, clinical laboratory evaluations , C-SSRS and 12-lead EC Gs, in YKP3089-treated 
subjects.
7 SELECTION OF STUDY POPULATION
7.1 Study Population and Sites
This trial will be sponsored by SK Life Scien ce Inc. in the United States and other countries.

7.5 Birth Control Methods Allowable for Enrollment of Subjects
Sexually active female subjects of reproductive potential must practice an approved method of 
contraception during the entire study and for 30 days after the last dose of study medication. 
Hormonal contraceptives alone will not be c onsidered an adequate method of contraception.
Women of childbearing/reproductive potential are defined as: Any female who has experienced 
menarche and does not meet the criteria for “Women Not of Childbearing Potential”. Women not 
of childbearing potential are defined as women who are postmenopausal or permanently sterilised 
(e.g. tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy).
Acceptable methods include: 
xHormonal contraception (for at least 3 months prior  to Visit 1) in combination with a barrier 
method.
xIntrauterine device (placement at least 3 months prior to Screening visit)
xDiaphragm with spermicide
xCervical cap
xCondoms with contraceptive gel/foam or cream 
xSurgical sterilization (tubal ligation at least 6 mont hs prior to screening or partner who has had 
vasectomy at least 6 months prior to screening)
xPostmenopausal (as defined by absent  menses for at least 12 months)
xAbstinence; however, if the subject becomes sexu ally active, 1 of the above methods must be 
utilized.
There is no need for male subjects enrolled in  YKP3089C021 study to use contraception with 
partners of childbearing potential during their participation in the study.

8.1.1.2 Testing
The sponsor is responsible for testing investigational product to establish stability and storage 
conditions. The storage specification provided on the labeling reflect results of this testing.
8.1.1.3 Packaging and Labeling
YKP3089 will be packaged in high density polye thylene (HDPE) bottles each containing 30 tablets 
of either 12.5mg or 25mg or 100 tablets of either 50 mg or 100 mg.
8.1.2 Supply, Storage, Accountability, and Disposition of Study Medication
The Sponsor’s manufacturing facility will ship a suf ficient supply of study medication to each 
study site directly or from a local depot. The clinical investigator has the responsibility for 
confirming that all study drug treatment supplies recei ved by the site are inventoried and accounted 
for throughout the study. A drug receipt log is to  be filled out and signed by the person accepting 
the shipment. It is important that the designated study staff count and verify that the shipment 
contains all the items noted in the shipment inventory. Any damaged or unusable study drug in a 
given shipment will be documented in the study  files. The investigator must notify the study 
Sponsor of any damaged or unusable study treatments that were supplied to the investigator ’s site.
Subjects or their legal representatives must be told to return all original containers (empty or 
containing study drug), which will be stored and disposed of according to Sponsor's instructions. 
Subjects or their legal representatives must also  be told to keep study drugs in their original 
containers and not to combine the contents of different containers.
All study medication must be kept in a secure, locked area or lock ed cabinet with access restricted 
to designated study personnel. The tablets will  be stored at room temperature in a dry area,
protected from light.
Study personnel will keep accurate records of the st udy medication dispensed to and used by each 
subject and be available for verification for the Sponsor's site monitor during on-site monitoring 
visits. The site monitor will periodically check the supplies of study medication held at the site to 
ensure accountability of all study medication used throughout the study.
At the conclusion of the study, a final inventory will be performed. Any discrepancies will be 
investigated, resolved, and documented prior to return to the Sponsor for destruction of study drug 
that has not been dispensed and study drug that has been dispensed and returned.
8.2 Screening and Study Drug Distribution
8.2.1.1 Screening Number
The subject will be assigned a screening numbe r by IWRS after signing the informed consent form.
The screening number will be an 8-digit number in which the first 2 digits will signify the country, 
the third, fourth, and fifth digits will signify the site number in that country, and the last 3 digits 
will be a consecutive number, starting 101, assigne d to subjects in the order in which they are 
screened. Thus, the third screened subject in the second site in the country given number 01 will 
have screening number 01002103. Screening number should not be reused. Re-screening is not 
allowed.
SK Life Science Inc CONFIDENTIAL
Protocol YKP3089C021, Amendment 5 June 20, 2019 
Page 91 of 1358.2.1.2 Drug Dispensing
At each visit, the investigator will access the IW RS, enter his or her own user ID and PIN, and 
provide requested subject details (eg, subject’s year of birth). The IWRS will identify open label
bottles of tablets to be dispense d. Returned bottles may be re-dispensed to the same subject after 
drug accountability is performed.
Prior to dispensing, the investigator will record on each open label bottle label the subject number,
date dispensed, site number, phone contact, and investigator name.
In addition, the investigator will review the elec tronic case report form (eCRF) to make sure the
medication number printed on each bottle dispensed is populated in the system correctly.
At each visit, the investigator will record the ex act dates and exact doses taken since the last visit 
in the case report form (eCRF). All dosing changes should be recorded in details.
8.3 Prior and Concomitant Treatments
Subjects must be on their current stable dail y dosage of phenytoin or phenobarbital or any other 
concomitant AEDs for at least 3 weeks before Visi t 2. They must continue taking the same brand 
of phenytoin or phenobarbital throughout the titration phase. 
Those subjects taking phenytoin every 24 hours will be instructed to take the dose at approximately 
8:00 a.m. beginning at least 7 days before Visit 2 and continue this regimen throughout the titration 
phase. On the day of Visit 2, subject should delay  the morning dose until the trough phenytoin 
plasma sample is obtained. Subjects who are takin g phenytoin every 24 hours at bedtime will need 
to switch to morning dosing at least 7 days before Visit 2. Subjects who take phenytoin every 12 
hours will be instructed to take their doses at a pproximately 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. beginning at 
least 7 days before Visit 2 and continue this regimen throughout the titration phase.
Those subjects taking phenobarbital every 24 hours  will be instructed to take the dose at 
approximately 8:00 a.m. beginning at least 7 da ys before Visit 2 and continue this regimen 
throughout the titration phase. On the day of Vi sit 2, subject should delay the morning dose until 
the trough phenobarbital plasma sa mple is obtained. Subjects w ho are taking phenobarbital every 
24 hours at bedtime need not switch to morning dosi ng. Subjects who take phenobarbital every 12 
hours will be instructed to take their doses at a pproximately 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. beginning at 
least 7 days before Visit 2 and continue this regimen throughout the titration phase.
Intermittent rescue medication can be used  during the open-label treatment period.
Subjects taking AEDs other than phenytoin or ph enobarbital at the beginning of the study cannot 
add phenytoin or phenobarbita l to the existing regimen.

Visit 16.
For subjects who discontinue any time after the fi rst year of the open-label treatment, the subject 
should be brought to the clinic as soon as possible and the investigator will perform the assessments 
listed under Visit 14. The data collected at this visi t will be entered in th e Termination Visit page 
in eCRF. After this visit, the s ubject will be scheduled to return for Visit 15 (end-of-study follow-
up, 14 days after the last dose of study medication). 
9.2 Unscheduled Visit
At any time during the study, the subject may ha ve an additional study visit/phone call if the 
investigator or the subject feels it is necessa ry. All information, including reason for visit/phone 
call, AEs, and any procedures performed should be collected in the source documents and recorded 
in the appropriate section of the eCRF.
9.3 Safety Assessments
Safety will be assessed by the na ture, frequency, and severity of treatment-emergent spontaneously 
reported AEs, dropouts due to AEs, overall dropout ra tes, and changes from base line in vital signs, 
physical and neurologic exams, clinical laboratory evaluations, 12-lead ECGs, and Columbia-
Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).
Study subjects will receive the following Hypersen sitivity information on a laminated card to carry 
with them:    
xRash may occur and may progress to Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic 
Symptoms (DRESS).
xRash or other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy, and 
swelling) may herald a serious medical even t and that the patient should report any such 
occurrence to the investigative site immediately.
xInstructions on whom and where to call in the event a symptom arises and information that 
can be provided to an emergency room in the ev ent the subject cannot reach the investigator 
site.
xReminder to check skin daily for evidence of rash for the first four months of therapy
If a subject reports a rash by telephone, an unsch eduled visit should be performed promptly. Any 
patient with a rash or manifestation of hypersensiti vity reaction such as lymphadenopathy, fever, 
facial swelling must be seen immediately at the study site. If it can definitely be determined that 
the rash or other symptoms are unrelated to study drug, then the subject can be maintained on 
YKP3809.  If the cause of the rash or other symptoms cannot be definitely determined 
immediately, then YKP3089 must be discontinued immediately. 
The initial physical/rash assessment for hypersensitivity reaction at the investigative site will 
include the following:
xMeasure body temperature

Page 109 of 1359.4 Pharmacokinetic Evaluations
Time and date of each blood draw and dosing re cords (time/date/dose) of YKP3089 and AEDs 
prior to each blood draw will be record ed on the eCRF and other appropriate forms.
Plasma samples will be assaye d for YKP3089 and AEDs at a specified bioanalytical laboratory 
using previously validated methods. Assay methodol ogy will be detailed in separate assay 
protocols.
For subject taking phenytoin or phenobarbital
These samples will be obtained from subjects takin g phenobarbital or phenytoin at any global sites.
At Visit 2, a single trough level of phenytoin or phe nobarbital will be obtained. At Visits , 4, 5, 6, 
7 and 8, two blood samples will be collected for the determination of phenobarbital or phenytoin 
plasma levels: For the subjects taking phenytoin or phenobarbital in the morning and coming into 
the visits in the morning, the first blood draw will be collected upon subjects’ arrival to the study 
unit; the second blood draw should be collected wi thin 30 minutes to 2 hours after the medication 
is taken. At Visits 8 and 9, two blood samples will be collected for YKP3089 depending on stability 
of dosing (stable dose all AEDs including YKP3089 for prior 2 weeks).                                                                 
For subject taking concomitant AEDs ot her than phenytoin or phenobarbital
These samples will be obtained from subjects tak ing concomitant AEDs other than phenobarbital 
or phenytoin at US sites only.
At Visit 2, a single blood sample will be drawn to  determine trough level if the subject is taking 
one of the followings, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, lamotrigine, lacosamide, clobazam, perampanel 
and levetiracetam. At Visit 8 and/or 9, two blood samp les will be drawn from the same subjects to
determine plasma levels of YKP3089, oxcarbazepi ne, topiramate, lamotrigine, lacosamide, 
clobazam, perampanel and levetiracetam.  Collect  at visit 8 and/ or 9 depending on stability of 
dosing (stable dose all AEDs including YKP3089 for prior 2 weeks). At Visit 8 and 9, for the 
subjects that are taking concomitant AEDs in the morning and coming into the visits in the 
morning, first blood draw will be collected upon subjects’ arrival to the study unit; the second 
blood draw should be collected within 30 minutes  to 2 hours after the medication is taken. For 
patients that are taking concomitant AEDs in the af ternoon and/or coming into the visits in the 
afternoon, the first blood draw will be collected upon subjects’ arri val to the study unit; the second 
blood draw should be collected within 30 minutes to  2 hours after the first blood draw with timing 
of the dose, blood draws and strength of previous dose clearly documented.
The collection schedule is summarized in Table 11 below.

10 SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS 
10.1 Definitions
10.1.1 Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, il lness, or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study. Intercurrent  illnesses or injuries should be regarded as AEs.
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be AEs if the abnormality:
SK Life Science Inc CONFIDENTIAL
Protocol YKP3089C021, Amendment 5 June 20, 2019 
Page 111 of 135xResults in study withdrawal
xIs associated with an SAE
xIs associated with clinical signs or symptoms
xLeads to additional treatment or  to further diagnostic tests
xIs considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance
10.1.2 Serious Adverse Event
AEs are classified as serious or non-serious. A serious adverse event is any AE that is:
xFatal
xLife-threatening
xRequires or prolongs hospital stay
xResults in persistent or significant disability or incapacity
xA congenital anomaly or birth defect
xAn important medical event
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening but are clearly of 
major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject and may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted  above. For example, drug overdose or abuse, a 
seizure that did not result in inpatient hospi talization, or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in 
an emergency department would ty pically be considered serious.
10.1.3 Suspected Adverse Reaction
Suspected adverse reaction means any AEs for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
cause the AE. For the purpose of investigational new drug (IND) safety reporting, “reasonabl e
possibility” means there is evidence to su ggest a causal relationship between the drug and AE.
Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degre e of certainty about causality than adverse 
reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. 
All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for seriousness should be regarded as non-serious 
AEs.
10.1.4 Adverse Event Reporting Period
The study period during which AEs must be report ed is normally defined as the period from the 
initiation of any study procedures (Visit 1) to th e end of the study treatment follow-up. For this 
study, the AE reporting period is defined as 30 da ys following the last administration of study 
treatment for SAEs. For all other AEs, reporting period is defined as 14 days following the last 
administration of study treatment.
10.1.5 Preexisting Condition
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study. A preexisting condition 
should be recorded as an AE if the frequency, in tensity, or the character of the condition worsens 
during the study period.
At Visit 1 any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition. At
the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition 
of an AE must also be recorded and documented as an AE.
Post-study Adverse Events
All unresolved AEs should be followed by the invest igator until the events are resolved, the subject
is lost to follow-up, or the AE is otherwise explain ed. At the last scheduled visit, the investigator
should instruct each subject to re port any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject ’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.
The investigator should notify the study Sponsor of  any death or AE occurrin g at any time after a 
subject has discontinued or terminated study partic ipation that may reasonably be related to this 
study. The Sponsor should also be notified if the investigator should become aware of the 
development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a 
subject who has participated in this study.
Abnormal Laboratory Values
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an AE if any one of the following
conditions is met:
SK Life Science Inc CONFIDENTIAL
Protocol YKP3089C021, Amendment 5 June 20, 2019 
Page 113 of 135xThe laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted  by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality.
xThe abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity.
xThe abnormality is of a degree that requires active management (eg, change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow-up assessments, further diagnostic investigation).
Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization, or Surgery
Any AE that results in hospitalization or prolonge d hospitalization should be documented and 
reported as a serious AE unless specifically instru cted otherwise in this protocol. Any condition 
responsible for surgery should be documented as an  AE if the condition meets the criteria for an 
AE.
Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged hos pitalization, nor surgery are reported as an 
AE in the following circumstances:
xHospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for d iagnostic or elective surgical procedures for 
a preexisting condition. Surgery should notbe reported as an outcome of an AE if the purpose 
of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.
xHospitalization or prolonged hospitalization required to allow efficacy measurement for the 
study.
xHospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for therapy of the target disease of the study, 
unless it is a worsening or increase in frequenc y of hospital admissions as judged by the clinical 
investigator.
xAn Emergency Room visit is not considered hospitalization.
10.2 Adverse Event Recording and Assessing
All AEs occurring during this clinical trial will be recorded. The investigator will review each 
event and assess its relationship to drug tr eatment (unrelated, remote, possible, probable, or
definite). Each sign or symptom reported will be graded on a 3-point severity scale (mild, 
moderate, or severe), and the date of onset, time of onset, and outcome of each event will be noted.
The relationship of each AE to study drug will be assessed using the following definitions:
Definite xDistinct temporal relationship with drug treatment
xKnown reaction to agent or chemical group, or predicted by known 
pharmacology
xEvent cannot be explained by subject ’s clinical state or other factors
Probable xReasonable temporal relationship with drug treatment
xLikely to be known reaction to agent or chemical group, or predicted by 
known pharmacology
xEvent cannot easily be explained by subject ’s clinical state or other factors
Possible xReasonable temporal relationship with drug treatment
xEvent could be explained by subject ’s clinical state or other factors
Remote xPoor temporal relationship with drug treatment
xEvent easily explained by subject ’s clinical state or other factors
Unrelated xEvent occurring before dosing
xEvent or intercurrent illness due wholly to factors other than drug treatment
The following definitions for rating severity will be used:
xMild : The AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with daily activity.
xModerate : The AE interferes with daily activity, but the subject is still able to function.
xSevere : The AE is incapacitating and requires medical intervention.
10.3 Reporting of Adverse Events
At each contact with the subject, the investig ator must seek information on AEs by specific 
questioning and, as appropriate, by examination. Information on all AEs should be recorded 
immediately in the source document and also in the appropriate AE module of the eCRF. All

Protocol YKP3089C021, Amendment 5 June 20, 2019 
Page 115 of 135All AEs occurring during the study period must be  recorded on the appropriate eCRFs. The clinical 
course of each event should be followed until re solution, stabilization, or until it has been 
determined that the study treatmen t or participation is not the cause. Serious AEs that are still 
ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome. Any 
serious AE that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study 
treatment or study participation should be rec orded and reported immediately no later than 24 
hours after awareness of the event.
10.3.1 Study Sponsor Notification by Investigator
In the event of any fatal or life-threatening SAE,  the investigator must inform SK Life Science, 
Inc. (SKLSI) designee QDS by telephone immediately.  Any non-fatal or non-life-threatening 
SAE, regardless of expectedness or causality, mu st be reported on the SAE Report Form by 
scanned and emailed to SKLSI ’s designee QDS within 24 hours of the investigato r’s or any other 
study center personnel’s knowledge of the event as described below. 
A completed SAE Report Form, the AE record, pe rtinent medical records, and the Concurrent 
Medication record from the source documents should be scanned and emailed to SKLSI ’s 
designee QDS within 24 hours of the investigator’s or any study center personnel’s knowledge of 
a serious event.  An updated SAE Report Form should be forwarded to SKLSI ’s designee QDS 
within 24 hours of receipt of new/updated information.  The SAE Reporting Requirements and 
contact information are outlined in Table 12.
Seizures in this subject population are anticipated.  Therefore, seizures, in and of themselves, will 
not be considered adverse events.  Seizures to be  considered adverse events will include those 
occurring with a measurable increase over the subject’s typ ical seizure frequency or duration; or 
multiple seizures in a pattern distinguis hable from the usual seizure pattern.

xA description of the event
xDate of onset
xCurrent status 
xWhether study treatment was discontinued
xThe reason why the event is classified as serious
xInvestigator assessment of the association between the event and study treatment
Within the following 48 hours, the investigator must provide further information on the serious 
AE in the form of a written narrative. This shoul d include a copy of the completed SAE form, and 
any other diagnostic information that will assist  the understanding of the event. Significant new 
information on ongoing serious AEs should be provided promptly to the study Sponsor.
10.3.2 Ethics Committee/Institutional Rev iew Board Notification by Investigator
Reports of all serious AEs (including follow- up information) must promptly be submitted to the 
Ethics Committee/Institutional Re view Board (EC/IRB). Copies of each report and documentation 
of EC/IRB notification and receipt will be kept in the clinical investigator ’s binder.
10.3.3 Regulatory Authority Notificatio n of IND Safety Reports by Sponsor
The study Sponsor must notify the FDA and all participating investigators in an IND safety report 
of potential serious risks from clinical trials as soon  as possible but in no case later than 15 calendar 
days after the Sponsor determines that the informatio n qualifies for reporting. This includes any 
suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected (SUSAR).
The study Sponsor must notify the FDA of any une xpected fatal or life-threatening suspected 
adverse reaction as soon as possible but no  later than 7 calenda r days from the S ponsor’s initial 
receipt of the information.
If a previous AE that was not initially deemed reportable is later found to fit the criteria for 
reporting, the study Sponsor will submit the AE in a written report to the FDA as soon as possible, 
but no later than 15 calendar days from the time the determination is made.
The notification of other Regulatory Authorities follows the same procedure and timeframe, per 
ICH Guidance, as for the FDA.
10.4 Withdrawal of Subject from Study 
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study prior to completion of the study if:
xConsent is withdrawn by the subject
xThe subject fails to adhere to the protocol requirements
xAn intolerable AE is experienced
xThe subject becomes pregnant
xThe subject is lost to follow-up
When a subject is withdrawn, the discharge proc edures must be performed. The reason(s) for the 
withdrawal must be documented in the subject ’s eCRF.
11 DATA HANDLING PROCEDURES
11.1 Data Handling and Record Keeping 
11.1.1 Confidentiality
Information about study subjects will be kept  confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portab ility and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Those 
regulations require a signed subject authoriza tion informing the subject of the following:
xWhat protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study
xWho will have access to that information and why
xWho will use or disclose that information
xThe rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI
The subjects will be told that representatives of the Sponsor, IRB/IEC, or regulatory authorities 
may inspect their medical records to verify the information collected and that all personal 
information made available for inspec tion will be handled in stricte st confidence and in accordance 
with local data protection laws.
SK Life Science Inc CONFIDENTIAL
Protocol YKP3089C021, Amendment 5 June 20, 2019 
Page 119 of 135In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
regulation, retains the ability to use all informati on collected prior to the revocation of subject
authorization. For subjects who have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should 
be made to obtain permission to collect at least vi tal status (ie, that the subject is alive) at the end 
of his or her scheduled study period.
11.1.2 Source Documents
Source data is all information, original records of cl inical findings, observations, or other activities 
in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstr uction and evaluation of the trial. Source data are 
contained in source documents. Examples of thes e original documents and data records include 
hospital records; clinical and office char ts; laboratory notes; memoranda; subject s’ diaries or 
evaluation checklists; pharmacy dispensing records; recorded data from automated instruments;
copies or transcriptions certified after verifica tion as being accurate and complete; microfiches;
photographic negatives; microfilm or magnetic medi a; x-rays; subject files; and records kept at the 
pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico-technical departments involved in the clinical trial.
11.1.3 Electronic Case Report Forms
The eCRF is the primary data collection instrumen t for the study. All data requested on the eCRF 
must be recorded. All missing data must be explai ned. Details of the completion of the eCRF will 
be included in a data entry manual.
11.1.4 Records Retention
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/institution will maintain all eCRFs 
and all source documents that support the data collec ted from each subject, as well as all study 
documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Es sential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical 
Trial, and all study documents as specified by the applicable regulatory requirement(s).
The investigator/institution will take measures to  prevent accidental or premature destruction of 
these documents. Essential documents must be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval 
of a marketing application in an ICH region an d until there are no pending or contemplated 
marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal

12.1 Statistical Methods
Categorical variables will be su mmarized as frequencies and percenta ges. Descriptive statistics for 
continuous variables will include number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation, and 
minimum and maximum values. SAS®version 9.2 or later will be us ed for all data summaries.
Data will be used as collected.  
12.2 Analysis Data Sets
Enrolled subjects : All subjects who successfully meet th eir entry criteria and who have given 
informed consent to participate in this st udy will be considered enrolled subjects.
Safety evaluable subjects (SE) : All subjects enrolled in the study who received at least one dose of 
study drug medication will be consid ered safety evaluable subjects. 
Three safety evaluable subgroups of subjects will be defined: 
oSubjects taking phenytoin and YKP3089
oSubjects taking Phenobarbital and YKP3089
oSubjects taking concomitant AEDs other than phenytoin or Phenobarbital and 
YKP3089
12.3 Baseline Characteristics
All demographic measurements (age, gender, race, ethnicity, height, and we ight) and all baseline 
safety measurements (medical and seizure history, MRI, CAT, ECGs, vital signs, clinical 
laboratory values, physical and brief neurologic ex am, and C-SSRS) will be summarized for all 
enrolled subjects, for all safety evaluable subjec ts and by the 3 subgroups of subjects defined in 
Section 12.2.
12.4 Safety Variable Analyses
All enrolled subjects who took at least one dose of study drug medication will be evaluable for 
safety. The number and percent of subjects re porting AEs (including treatment-emergent 
laboratory abnormalities) will be tabulated for al l safety evaluable subjects and by the 3 subgroups 
of subjects defined in Section 12.2.  All serious AEs (SAEs) will be tabulated separately as well as 
included with all reported AEs. 
Physical and neurologic assessments, laboratory results, vital signs (including orthostatic 
measurements, weight and height), concomitan t medications, ECGs, and C-SSRS will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics.
Extent of exposure and dose modifications will be tabulated.
12.5 Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Analysis
YKP3089 plasma concentration data collected from th is study will be pooled with data from other 
YKP3089 clinical trials for possible population phar macokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis. 
An integrated population pharmacokinetic model for YKP3089 will be developed. Standard 
population pharmacokinetic parameters (eg, total body clearance, CL/F) in epilepsy patients and 
their inter- and intra-individual variability will be estimated. The effects of demographic 
characteristics, concomitant medication including  AEDs, laboratory values, and other subject 
covariates on YKP3089 pharmacoki netics will be evaluated. 
For phenytoin, phenobarbital plasma  concentrations obtained during titration phase (Visits 3-6)
will be compared with that taken at baseline (Visit 2) to assess the effect of YKP3089 on these two 
AEDs. The timing of AED sampling in relation to  the subject’s AED dosing schedule will be 
factored into the analysis.
For each concomitant AED (oxcarbazepine, t opiramate, lamotrigine, lacosamide, clobazam, 
perampanel and levetiracetam only), plasma conc entrations obtained at Visits 8 and or 9 will be 
compared with that taken at baseline (Visit 2) to assess the effect of YKP3089 on these 7 AEDs. 
The timing of AED sampling in relation to  the subject’s AED dosing schedule will be factored 
into the analysis.

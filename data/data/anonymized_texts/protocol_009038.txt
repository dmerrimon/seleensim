Study Design:  This Phase 2, international, multicentre,  dose-ranging, double -masked, randomised, parallel -group, 
vehicle -controlled study  is designed to evaluate  3 different doses of  REC 0/0559  versus vehicle in 
patients with Stage 2 and Stage 3 NK.  
 Dose of MT8 per day  Study drug concentration  
Dose 1  0.5 µg/day  5 µg/mL MT8 given 1 drop QID  
Dose 2  2.5 µg/day  25 µg/mL MT8 given 1 drop QID  
Dose 3  5 µg/day  50 µg/mL MT8 given 1 drop QID  
Vehicle  0 µg/day  Vehicle given 1 drop QID  
Abbreviations: QID, 4 times a day  
Screening procedures (V1a) will be performed on Day -3, Day -2, Day -1, or on Day 1, prior to 
randomisation . The study will have an initial period of dose escalation followed by a parallel recruitment 
period. After confirmation of eligibility and signature of informed consent, patients will be random ly 
assigned to treatment with REC 0/0559  or vehicle on Day 1. Randomisation will be stratified by disease 
stage (Stage 2, Stage 3) and region (Europe, North America).  
Randomisation of the first 24 patients will be sequential, with cohorts of 8 patients fo r each dose level 
randomised in a 3:1 ratio in each cohort (6 patients treated with REC  0/0559  and 2 with vehicle), starting 
with Dose 1. Patients will be enrolled sequentially in each next highe st dose level 7 days after the 8th 
patient  of previous  cohort  has been  enrolled , unless the independent data monitoring committee ( DMC ) 
issues a specific recommendation for a change in study conduct. Th e DMC will receive information 
related to any non -serious adverse events ( AEs) that are considered to be severe and possibly related to 
the study drug and other AEs of special interest ( AESI ), to any serious adverse event ( SAE ), or any 
serum drug concentration > 10  nM on an ongoing basis.  
The initial dose escalation period of the p rotocol will proceed as follows:  
1. The first 8 patients will receive Dose 1 (5 µg/mL REC 0/0559  administered 1 drop QID) or 
vehicle.  
Recordati Rare Diseases  REC0559 -B-001 
REC 0/0559  Version  3.0 Final  
 
This document is confidential.  
Page  6 of 77 2. Seven days after the 8th patient  has been enrolled  at Dose 1, enrolment  will start for the next 
8 patients who will be treated with Dose 2 (25  µg/mL REC 0/0559  administered 1 drop QID) 
or vehicle, unless the DMC issues a specific recommendation for study conduct related to the 
safet y information received on an on going basis.  
3. Seven days  after the 8th patient has been enrolled  at Dose 2, enrolment  will start for the next 
8 patients who will be treated with Dose 3 (50 µg/mL REC 0/0559  administered 1 drop QID) 
or vehicle, unless the DMC issues a specific recommendation for study conduct related to the 
safety information on an on going  basis.  
The DMC will confirm in writ ing that the enrolment and dose escalation to a next dose level can 
continue based on the safety data received, if any (AESI, SAE , PK). 
The DMC can recommend discontinuing  the treatment at any time before the formal review of the data 
from the first 24 patients.  
Once  the 24th patient has been enrolled , enrolment  of new patients will be put on hold and the DMC will 
perform a formal review of all the safety and PK data available  before enrolment  of new patients is 
resumed . The treatment of the first 24 patients will continue as planned. The DMC may also recommend 
discontinuing the 12 -lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) assessment in the remaining patients (if no 
signifi cant systemic exposure to the study drug is observed).  
If no study discontinuation or change in the protocol  design  is recommended after the formal DMC 
review of all safety data for the first 24 patients, enrolment  will resume and patients will be randomis ed 
to all 4 treatment arms in a 1:1:1:1 ratio until approximately 27  patients are enrolled in each arm 
(approximately 108  patients total) . Another formal review of the data by the DMC will be conducted 8 
weeks after approximately 50% of patients (54 patien ts) have been enrolled.  
During the double -masked treatment period, all patients will administer 1 drop (approximately 25  µL) 
REC 0/0559  or vehicle  in the study  eye QID at 4  hour intervals  ± 30 minutes  (starting in the morning) 
for 8 weeks. Patients will be  followed up for 4  weeks after the end of treatment.  
At any time during the study, the investigator can discontinue the study drug and initiate a rescue 
treatment if clinically required (eg, in the case of worsening of disease).  
In case of study drug discontinuation of any reason, including when a rescue therapy is started, the 
patient will be asked to stay in the study and perform all the visits and assessments as planned  (except 
in cases where the patient has withdrawn consent for study participation ). Patients who discontinue 
study drug should at least complete the Early Termination and Follow -Up Visits if possible.  
A central laboratory will be used for haematology, biochemistry, and PK sample analysis. Central 
reading will be performed for the fluo rescein stain test (primary endpoint) . In addition, QoL will be 
evaluated using the NEI  VFQ -25. 
No formal interim analysis is planned for the study.

administration (last sampling before next dose administration)  
For all patients :  
• At Day 28 (±2 days) 4 hours postdose but before the next administration  
• At Day 56 (±3 days) , 4 hours postdose  
Other 
Assessments:  Quality of life will be evaluated using the NEI VFQ -25. Ocular symptoms and tolerability will be 
evaluated using a n NRS . 
Statistical Methods 
and Planned 
Analyses:  Analysis Populations  
Enrolled Population:  
The enrolled population will include all individuals who sign the ICF.  
Modified Intent -to-Treat Population:  
The intent -to-treat ( ITT) population will include all patients who are randomised  and receive at least 1 
drop of study drug , irrespective of any deviation from the protocol or premature dis continuation. The 
treatment group assignment will be designated according to initial randomisation. The ITT population 
will serve as the basis for the analysis of efficacy.  
Safety Population:  
The safety population will include all randomised patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug. 
The treatment group assignment in this population will be defined by the treatment actually received. 
This population will be used for the analysis of safety.  
Per-protocol Population:  
The per -protocol (PP) population will include all patients in the ITT population for whom no major 
protocol violations/deviations occurred.  
Statistical Analyses  
The primary endpoint will be analysed by means of the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel chi -square test, 
controlling for disease stage. Hierarchical testing will be performed to account for multiplicity.  
Benjamini -Hochberg procedure will be applied.  
The primary analysis will be performed on the ITT population and will consider rescue treatment 
initiation or randomis ed treatment discontinua tions due to related adverse events as failures, while all 
the other missing data will be managed according with the last observation carried forward ( LOCF ) 
method.   
A secondary analysis will be performed with the same criteria but including also the data  (if available) 
collected after treatment discontinuation (in this case not considered as failure).  
As sensitivity analyses, the primary analysis will be repeated on the intent -to-treat population by means 
of the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel chi -square test, co ntrolling for disease stage and site (pooled to ensure 
adequate strata sizes), with missing data imputed as failures, with observed data only and on the PP 
population.  
Categorical secondary endpoints will be analysed  using the same analysis used for the pr imary endpoint.  
Continuous endpoints will be based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment and sites 
as main effects and baseline value and disease stage as covariates.  
Time to event endpoints will be evaluated by means of Kaplan -Meier surviva l analysis using log -rank 
test. The Cox’s proportional hazard model will be used in order to manage covariates in the proper way.  
National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire -25 scores will be calculated according to the 
NEI VFQ -25 scoring algor ithm (composite score and subscales).  
An overall NRS score will be calculated as the mean of individual symptoms scores.

Page  18 of 77 5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Background on Neurotrophic Keratitis  
Neurotrophic keratitis ( NK; also known as  neurotrophic keratopathy; ORPHAnet number 
1375961) is a degenerative corneal condition involving the epithelial layer and the corneal stroma, 
associ ated with vasculari sation and opacification, which may evolve, through superficial punctate 
keratopathy (SPK) or persistent epithelial defects (PED), towards corneal ulceration - a severe 
condition called corneal neurotrophic ulcer (CNU) - and eventually l eading to corneal perforation.   
The hallmark of NK is corneal hypoaesthesia  or anaesthesia that leave the organ susceptible to 
injury and epithelial breakdown that can lead to ulceration, infection, stromal melting, and 
perforation, secondary to poor healing. It results from palsy or deficiency of one or more divisions 
of the tri geminal nerve or its branches, caused by surgery, neoplasia, aneurysm or facial trauma. 
Other causes include physical or chemical burns, ocular surgery, (herpetic) infections, (ab)use of 
topical anaesthetics, β -blockers or non -steroidal anti -inflammatory d rugs, systemic diseases (ie, 
diabetes mellitus), corneal dystrophies, congenital diseases (ie, Riley -Day syndrome and 
Goldenhar -Gorlin syndrome), increasing age, or iatrogenic causes (contact  lens wear and ocular 
surgery) .2-5  
Despite the high number of pathological events leading to impairment of t rigeminal corneal 
innervation, NK is a rare disease (EU/3/14/1400 ; defined in the European Union [ EU] as a disease 
affecting less than 5 in 10,000 people  and in the United States [US] as a disease affecting less than 
200,000 people nationwide ).6 
NK is classified ( Table 1) by the degree of the corneal tissue damage (based on Mackie 
classification). Stage 1 (mild) shows slight, non -specific signs and symptoms. Stage 2 (moderate) 
is character ised by epithelial defects, progressively leading to PED . Stage 3 (severe) is 
character ised by stromal disruption associated with a CNU  that progresses to perforation.

Page  19 of 77 Conventional treatment of NK depends on the stage of the disease.7 In Stage 1 NK, 
preservative -free tear substitutes are used to maintain lubrication and support the tear film; and 
topical antibiotics are used prophylactically to prevent superinfection in the  presence of epithelial 
defects. In Stage 2 NK, treatment of PED aims to prevent progression of the corneal lesion to 
corneal ulcer. Corneal and scleral contact lenses are commonly used, and in unresponsive cases, 
tarsorrhaphy  is recommended, either surgically or temporarily through botulinum A toxin 
injection.4 Amniotic membrane transplantation provides a mechanical bandag e rich with growth 
factors and cytokines, and this in combination with tarsorrhaphy has been shown to be useful for 
promotion the healing of refractory neurotrophic corneal ulcers.8 In Stage 3 NK, stromal lysis must 
be prevented and ocular integrity preserved. Topical collagenase inhibitors, such as 
N-acetylcysteine, tetracycline, or medroxyprogesterone are used to reduce stromal melting. 
Conjunctival f laps are also an option that provides metabolic and mechanical supply, promotes 
healing and restores integrity; however, visual function is sacrificed.9 Small perforations are 
sometimes treated with cyanoacrylate glue and a soft bandage contact lens or amniotic membrane, 
however larger defects require keratoplasty.  
Despite these treatments, healing response in NK patients remains difficult to obtain an d visual 
outcomes are poor.10,11  
Experimental models and clinical data have shown that recombinant human nerve growth factor  
(rhNGF) eye drops were able to induce corneal healing and recovery of sensitivity, to ameliorate 
tear production and quality, and to modulate inflammatory reaction.2,12-15 OxervateTM 
(cenegermin, recombinant form of human nerve growth factor [ NGF ]; Dompé Pharmaceuticals ) 
was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA)  and the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA ) in 2017 and 2018, respectively , for the treatment of NK. However, a number of local 
tolerability adverse events (AEs) were reported and medical need remains fo r a well -tolerated, 
practical, and efficacious local treatment of NK.  
Based on these data,  MT8 , a non-peptidi c neurotrophin mimetic compound  capable to bind the 
high-affinity NGF receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase A ( TrkA ) and the brain derived 
neurotrop hic factor  (BDNF) receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B ( TrkB ) at nanomolar 
concentration s, could be of interest in the treatment of NK. 
5.2 Background on MT8  
The compound  MT8  is a non -peptidic neurotrophin mimetic capable of binding  TrkA and TrkB  at 
nanomolar concentrations. The drug product REC 0/0559  is an ophthalmic solution and is prepared 
by dissolving MT8 in a phosphate -buffer ed saline (PBS) solution. The activity of MT8 (lysine salt) 
is due to the active form MT6, the free acid form of MT8 p resent in solution. The methyl ester of 
MT6, MT2, shows a similar pharmacological profile to MT8.  
 Nonclinical Studies  
The pharmacodynamic act ivity of the drug substance MT8  was investigated in in vitro , ex vivo , 
and in vivo  studies, including in vivo /ex vivo models of corneal ulcer in the rabbit.  
Recordati Rare Diseases  REC0559 -B-001 
REC 0/0559  Version  3.0 Final  
 
This document is confidential.  
Page  20 of 77 In vitro experiments with different cell lines of human (HCEP 0.5, HFCEC), bovine (BCE 
C/D-1b), and rabbit (SIRC) origin showed that MT8 is able to sustain cell proliferation and to 
prevent cell apoptosis similarl y to NGF.  
The pharmacodynamic activity of MT8 was investigated in vivo  in an alcohol -induced corneal dis -
epitheliali sation model in rabbits and in an experiment conducted in rabbits whose cornea were 
mechanically scraped. The results collectively indicate that MT8 has significant healing capacity 
in the corneal epithelium and stroma through promotion of cellular proliferation and inhibition of 
apoptosis.  
MT8 is a selective compound  and did not interact significantly with a panel of 45 kinase and 
57 recombin ant human receptors. MT8 did not induce or inhibit CYP450 enzymes, and it did not 
bind melanin in vitro.  
Metabolism of MT8 was measured in rat, dog and human hepatocytes. MT8 was detected 
practically unchanged in dog and human hepatocytes and weakly metabo lised in rat hepatocytes. 
In rat hepatocytes, hydroxylation and conjugation with glutathione were the most important 
metabolic reactions. MT8 does not present a concern for direct phototoxicity, since it does not 
absorb light within the range of natural su nlight (290 to 700  nm). The pharmacokinetic profile of 
MT8 in vivo in rat and rabbit following intravenous (IV), subcutaneous (SC), oral, and ocular 
administration showed a short half-life of about 30 and 10 min, respectively, an oral bioavailability 
of 45 % to 65%, and almost complete bioavailability by SC administration in rats; a lower 
bioavailability of about 20% was observed in rabbits and about 29% in dogs following ocular 
administration.  
Non-clinical toxicology studies conducted with IV MT8 in rats an d in rabbits using ocular 
administration of 0.01 to 1  mM of MT8 in PBS (single and repeated dose, 3 times per day, up to 
28 days) revealed no signs of damage or irritation to the eye; no signs of general toxicity or of 
systemic effects were  noted.  Prelimin ary results of an additional 13 -week study in rats by SC route 
did not show relevant changes that may have suggest ed systemic toxicity up to 30  mg/kg/day, 
which could  therefore be considered  as the no-observed -adverse -effect level (NOAEL ). A 
13/26 -week toxicity study in rabbits after MT8 ocular administration has also been completed. In 
this study, no systemic or local toxic effects were observed with MT8 ocular dosing  up to 
~400  µg/day (including by fluorescein staining, ophthalmologic evaluation, and s lit lamp 
examination). No relevant treatment -related histopathological changes of the eye or other organs 
were noted. The toxicokinetic profile showed an increment of systemic exposure of MT6 (free 
acid of MT8), which did not increase proportionally with t he dose level. Three genotoxicity studies 
have been completed. MT8  was non -mutagenic in an Ames Assay, did not induce chromosomal 
aberrations in human lymphocytes, and did not induce micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes.  
Results of the safety pharmac ology central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory study in rats 
show that MT8 at  0.1, 1 or 20  mg/kg had no effect on respiratory parameters or CNS activity in 
conscious male rats. There was no significant inhibition of human ether -a-go-go-related gene 
(hERG) by MT8 with half maximal inhibitory concentration  values estimated to be > 30µM , and 
Recordati Rare Diseases  REC0559 -B-001 
REC 0/0559  Version  3.0 Final  
 
This document is confidential.  
Page  21 of 77 no biologically relevant cardiovascular effects were observed with MT8 up to 4.725  mg/kg IV in 
conscious, telemetered , Beagle dogs. 
The cumulative results of these studies demonstrate the safety of REC 0/0559 , including when 
administered up to ~400µg/day by ocular route for up to 6 months  or 30  mg/kg/day by SC route 
for 13 weeks .  
Further details of nonclinical studies are in the inves tigator’s brochure (IB).16 
 Clinical Studies  
No clinical studies have been conducted by the Sponsor.  
In a compassionate use investigator -based program  conducted in Italy in 27 patients using the 
25 μg/mL concentration 4 times per day , it was reported  that most of the patients achieved healing 
of the corneal ulcer with MT8 , with a good tolerability of the treatment.17 
5.3 Study Rationale  
Available nonclinical and clinical data indicate that MT8 could be efficacious in the treatment of 
patients with NK. The objective of this Phase 2 dose -ranging, double -masked, randomised, 
parallel -group, vehicle -controlled study is to demonstrate the safety and the eff icacy of MT8 in 
patients with NK and to select the most appropriate dose.  
The rationale for the design of the study is discussed in Section  7.2. 
5.4 Clinical Risks/Benefits of MT8  
The proposed clinical study intends to evaluate the pharmacokinetics ( PK), safety and efficacy of 
REC 0/0559  in patients with NK. REC 0/0559  will be administered at the maximal MT8 dose of 
5 µg/day (50  µg/mL concentration administered as 1 drop [(approximately 25  µL]), 4 times a day 
[QID]) for 8 weeks in this study.  
In the 26 -week rabbit study where ocular MT8 was administered , no local (including irritation of 
the conjunctivae, iris or cornea) or systemic toxicity was observed with a NOAEL of 400  µg/day. 
Based on these data, the safety margin in terms of doses administered is at least 600 fold for the 
highest dose planned in th is clinical study. In addition, a low systemic drug concentration was 
observed in rabbits after ocular administration  (the maximum concentrations after 180 days of 
treatment remained < 10  ng/ml) . Of note, s imilar preliminary results were obtained the first  day of 
administration  of a 800 µg/day ocular dose in dogs . Considering that much lower doses will be 
administered to patients in this study and the difference in body mass and surface area, very low 
systemic exposure if any is expected in patients.  
No cl inical trial has been conducted with REC 0/0559  so far. The drug has been used in a 
compassionate use program, and though there are limitations of such an exploratory assessment, 
it was reported that  most of the patients achieved corneal healing while no local or systemic AEs 
were reported.17 
Based on these data, no specific MT8 -related safety co ncern is expected.

REC 0/0559  Version  3.0 Final  
 
This document is confidential.  
Page  22 of 77 REC 0/0559  is administered as eye drops. Common risks associated with eye drops are eye 
disorders such as ocular irritation or discomfort, eye or eyelid pain, increased lacrimation and 
blurred vision. Allergic reactions including of the skin in case of overflow have also been reported.  
The drug product is formulated in a phosphate buffer, which  has been associated in very rare cases 
with corneal calcifications in some patients with significantly damaged corneas. However, the 
EMA considere d that the evidence did not warrant a restriction on the use of phosphate buffers in 
eye drops, with an appropriate notification to prescribers and patients.18 
Specific study measures will be in place to ensure the safety and well -being of patients. The study 
will include a dose escalation and extensive safety and PK monitoring of the first 24  patients 
included. An independent data monitoring committee (DMC ) will be set up to monitor patients’ 
safety on an ongoing basis and to author ise enrolment  to continue after the first 24 patients. Patients 
will keep their treatment by preservative -free eye drops and/or topical antibiotics  (except 
tetracycline)  as required, and at any time during the study the investigator can initiate a rescue 
treatment in case of clinical need such as disease worsening. In addition, women of childbearing 
potential will have urinary pregnancy tests and the use of a highly effective contraception method 
contraception is required. Men with partners of childbearing potential should use condoms. 
Finally, experienced and trained personnel will conduct the study procedures including the specific 
ophthalmologic assessments.  
In conclusion, the rationale for the use of MT8 in NK, the available data  (in particular the data 
supporting the very large safety margin ) and the study measures planned to be in place collectively 
support a positive benefit risk ratio.

that are considered to be severe and possibly related to the study drug, other AESI as defined i n 
Section  12.7.2 , any SAEs, or any serum drug concentration > 10  nM) and continue to monitor 
safety data regularly throughout the study. The DMC may also recommend discontinuing the

7.1 Description of Overall Study Design and Plan  
This Phase 2, international, multicentre, dose -ranging, double -masked , randomis ed, 
parallel -group, vehicle -controlled study  is designed to evaluate 3 different doses of REC 0/0559  
versus vehicle in patients with Stage 2 and Stage 3 NK.   
 Dose of MT8 per day  Study drug concentration  
Dose 1  0.5 µg/day  5 µg/mL MT8 given 1 drop 
QID 
Dose 2  2.5 µg/day  25 µg/mL MT8 given 1 drop 
QID 
Dose 3  5 µg/day  50 µg/mL MT8 given 1 drop 
QID 
Vehicle  0 µg/day  Vehicle given 1 drop QID  
Abbreviations: QID, 4 times a day  
Screening procedures (V1a) will be performed on Day -3, Day -2, Day -1, or on Day 1, prior to 
randomisation . The study will have an initial period of dose escalation followed by a parallel 
recruitment period. After confirmation of eligibility and signature of informed consent, patients 
will be randomly assigned to treatment with REC 0/0559  or vehicle on Day 1. Ra ndomisation will 
be stratified by disease stage (Stage 2, Stage 3) and region ( Europe, North America ).  
Randomisation of the first 24 patients will be sequential, with cohorts of 8 patients for each dose 
level randomised in a 3:1 ratio in each cohort (6 pa tients treated with REC 0/0559  and 2 with 
vehicle), starting with Dose 1. Patients will be enrolled sequentially in each next highest dose level 
7 days after the 8th patient has been enrolled , unless the independent DMC issues a specific 
recommendation for  a change in study conduct.  The DMC will receive information related to any 
non-serious AEs that are considered to be severe and  possibly related to the study drug and other 
AESI as defined in Section  12.7.2 , to any SAE, or any serum drug concentration > 10  nM on an 
ongoing basis.   
The initial dose escalation period of the protocol will proceed as follows:  
1. The first 8 patients will receive Dose 1 (5 µg/mL REC 0/0559  administered 1 drop QID) 
or vehicle.  
2. Seven  days after the 8th patient has been enrolled at Dose  1, enrolment  will start for the 
next 8 patients who will be treated with Dose 2 (25  µg/mL REC 0/0559  administered 1 
drop QID) or vehicle, unless the DMC issues a specific recommendation for study conduct 
related to the safet y information received on an on going basis.  
3.  Seven days after the 8th patient has been enrolled at Dose 2, enrolment  will start for the 
next 8 patients who will be treated with Dose 3 (50 µg/mL REC 0/0559  administered 1

This document is confidential.  
Page  27 of 77 drop QID) or vehicle, unless the DMC issues a specific recommendation for study conduct 
related to the safety information on an on going  basis.  
The DMC will confirm in w riting that the enrolment and dose escalation to a next dose level can 
continue based on the safety data received, if any (AESI, SAE , PK). 
The DMC can recommend discontinuing  the treatment at any time before the formal review of the 
data from the first 24 patients.  
Once the 24th patient has been enrolled , enrolment of new patients will be put on hold and the 
DMC will perform a formal review of all the safety and PK data available  before enrolment of 
new patients is resumed . The treatment of the first 24 patients will continue as planned. The DMC 
may also recommend discontinuing the 12 -lead ECG assessment in the remaining patients (if no 
significant systemic exposure to th e study drug is observed).  
If no study discontinuation or change in the protocol design is recommended after the formal DMC 
review of all safety data for the first 24 patients, enrolment  will resume and patients will be 
randomis ed to all 4 treatment arms i n a 1:1:1:1 ratio until approximately 27  patients are enrolled 
in each arm (approximately 108  patients total) . Another formal review of the data by the DMC 
will be conducted 8 weeks after approximately 50% of patients (54  patients) have been enrolled . 
During the double -masked treatment period, all patients will administer 1 drop (approximately 
25 µL) REC 0/0559  or vehicle  in the study  eye QID at 4  hour intervals ± 30 minutes (starting in 
the morning) for 8 weeks.  
Patients will be followed up for 4 week s after the end of treatment.  
Details related to the DMC are in Section  15.8. 
At any time during the study, the investigator can discontinue the study drug and initiate a rescue 
treatment if clinically required (eg, in the case of worsening of disease).  
In case of study drug discontinuation for any reason, including when a rescue therapy is started, 
the patient will be asked to stay in the study and perform all the visits and assessments as planned  
(except in cases where the patient has withdrawn consent for study parti cipation) . Patients who 
discontinue study drug should at least complete the Early Termination and Follow -up Visits if 
possible.  
Study procedures will be performed according to the schedule in Table  2 and as described in 
Section s 10, 11 and 12. A central laboratory will be used for haematology, biochemistry, and PK 
sample analysis. Central reading will be performed for the fluorescein stain test as described in 
Section  11.1.2 . In addition, QoL will be evaluated using the NEI  VFQ -25. 
No formal interim analysis is planned for the study.  
A diagram of the study design is presented in Figure 1.

7.2 Discussion of Study Design  
The objective of this Phase 2 dose -ranging, double -masked, randomised, parallel -group, vehicle -
controlled study is to demonstrate the safety and the efficacy of MT8 in patients with NK and to 
select the most appropriate dose.  
Patients will be adults with moderate (Stage 2, PED) to severe (Stage 3, corneal ulcer) NK, 
affecting one eye and not improved by conventional non -surgical treatment. It is planned to include 
108 patients in total (27 per arm).  
In this clinical study, REC 0/0559  will be administered a t 3 different doses (5, 25, and 50  µg/mL) 
or vehicle given as 1 drop in the study  eye, QID at 4 hour intervals ± 30 minutes starting in the 
morning for 8 weeks, followed by a 4 week follow -up without treatment.  
The study includ es a first period of thorough  safety and PK analysis in 24 patients involving a 
DMC to ensure patient safety . Recruitment will be sequential, starting with the lowest dose of 
REC  0/0559 and then with the next higher doses if the treatment is well tolerated.  
The proposed starting dose  of 5 µg/mL is derived from the in vivo and in vitro non clinical 
pharmacological models having shown the pharmacological activity of this low dose of MT8 
(10 µM). The intermediate 25 µg/ml dose was shown to be possibly efficacious and well tolerated 
durin g the compassionate use of MT8 in 27 patients with NK. The highest dose of 50  µg/mL was 
chosen to evaluate if efficacy or time to achieve the healing i mproves .

REC 0/0559  Version  3.0 Final  
 
This document is confidential.  
Page  29 of 77 The administration schedule (QID for 8 weeks) was the same as in the exploratory compassionate 
use program. An 8 -week treatment duration was shown to be  appropriate for achieving healing 
with rhNGF (cenegermin) and MT8 in the compassionate use program. The 4 -week follow -up is 
intended to collect safety data (AEs) as well as clinical and ophthalmolog ical data after study drug 
discontinuation. Based on the short half-life observed in animal data, elimination of the drug is 
expected to be rapid.  
The primary endpoint will capture complete corneal healing assessed conservatively as no corneal 
fluorescein  staining in the area of the prior PED or corneal ulcer by an independent central reading 
centre made of experienced and trained readers masked to the treatment group. A separate manual 
will detail the procedures used for central reading, including clinica l picture collection method(s) 
and definitions for central reading assessment. In addition, the assessment of corneal healing by 
the investigator will be a secondary endpoint. The assessment of corneal healing using a definition 
taking into account the low er limit of reliable slit lamp assessment ie, <  0.5 mm lesion staining 
will be also collected .  
7.3 End of Study  
A patient  will have fulfilled the requirements for study completion if/when the  patient  has 
completed all study periods, including End of Treatment  or Early Termination Visit  and the last 
Follow -up Visit  as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table  2). 
The end of the study will be the last patient’s  last assessment as indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments . 
After the end of this study, REC0/0559 will not be available to patients. Patients will not be 
restricted with regard to pursuing available treatme nts for NK. 
7.4 Early Termination of Study  
The Sponsor may decide at any time with appropriate notification to prematurely terminate or 
suspend the participation of a particular clinical trial centre (eg, for lack of subject enrolment or 
noncompliance with cli nical trial protocol, regulations, or Good Clinical Practice [GCP]) or 
prematurely suspend the clinical trial (eg, for reasons of safety, quality of study drug, regulatory, 
legal, or other reasons aligned with GCP).

Page  33 of 77 8.3 Rescreenin g 
Individuals who sign the ICF to participate in the study  but who do not subsequently meet all the 
requirements as outlined in the inclusion and exclusion crit eria (screen failures)  may be rescreened 
once , provided the investigator assesses and documents that the patient’s condition(s) may evolve 
in order to allow enrolment . 
8.4 Study Withdrawal, Removal, and Replacement of Patients  
Withdrawals will not be replaced (neither withdrawals from study drug, nor withdrawals from the 
study).  
 Withdrawal from Study Drug  
Patients permanently withdrawn from study drug should not be withdrawn from the study and, 
apart from study drug administration, should continue all scheduled study visits and procedures 
until the end of the scheduled treatment  period at Day 56/Visit 8 (±3 days)  to ensure complete 
follow -up (except in cases where the patient has withdraw n consent for study participation) . The 
Follow -up Visit  should take place 4 weeks after Day 56/Visit 8 (±3 days)  regardless the date of 
definitive study drug  discontinuation. If this is not possible, patients will be at least asked to return 
to the study site as soon as possible to complete the Early Termination and Follow -up Visit  
assessments as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2). 
If a patient  discontinues study drug for any reason, the study site must immediately notify the 
medical monitor. The date and the reason for discontinuation must be recorded on the electronic 
case report form (e CRF ).  
In the event that a patient  discontinues study drug prematurely because of a treatment -emergent 
adverse event  (TEAE) or serious TEAE, the TEAE or serious TEAE will be followed up until it 
resolves (returns to normal or baseline values) or stabili ses, or un til it is judged by the investigator 
to no longer be clinically significant.  
A patient  may be withdrawn from the study drug at any time for reasons including, but not limited 
to, the following:  
• Progressive disease : A rescue treatment may be initiated by th e investigator according to 
clinical judgment as described in Section 9.6.2 . 
• Unacceptable toxicity or AE  
• General or specific changes in the patient’s  condition that renders him/her ineligible for 
further treatment according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria  (eg, sus pected 
hypersensitivity to the study drug , pregnancy , etc) 
Corneal healing is not a reason that study drug should be withdrawn before  the end of the 8 -week 
treatment period.

 Withdrawal from the Study  
Patient s may withdraw from the study at any time for any reason without jeopardy or prejudice or 
compromising their clinical care. However, every effort should be made to adhere to as many study 
assessments as possible. If a patient  indicates that he/she wishes t o withdraw from the study, 
whenever possible, the patient  should be seen by the investigator and the procedures for the Early 
Termination  Visit should be performed (refer to Table  2).  
A patient  may be withdrawn from the study at any time for reasons including, but not limited to, 
the following:  
• Patient  withdrawal of consent: At any time, a patient’s  participation in the study may be 
terminated at his/her request or on the basis of the investigator’s clinical judgment. The 
reason for patient  withdrawal will be noted on the eCRF.  
• Patient  fails to adhere to the protocol requirements (eg , drug noncompliance, failure to 
return for study visits) . 
• Lost to follow -up: The patient  did not come for 3 visits , and study personnel were unable 
to contact the patient  for at least 8 weeks . 
• Pregnancy, as indicated in Section  12.8 
• The investigator also has the right to withdraw patient s from the study in the event of 
intercurrent illness, (S)AEs , and administrative or other reasons. Data for all visits to the 
point of withdrawal must be recorded in the patient ’s medical record and in the eCRF.  
The data to be collected for patient s who withdraw from the study should include:  
• Date of withdrawal from the study  
• Reason for withdrawal from the study  
• Data on assessments conducted (if possible) as part of the Early Termination  Visit as 
described in Table  2 
• Data on any (S)AEs present at the time of withdrawal from the study  
The investigator will follow patient s who are withdrawn from the study as a result of an (S)AE 
until the event has resolved , subsided, stabilised or until the event is otherwise explained or the 
patient  is lost to fo llow-up (refer to Section  12.7.4 ). If withdrawal from the  study is a result of a 
SAE or pregnancy, the SAE/pregnancy will need to be reported and followed  up as described in 
Section  12.7.4  and Section  12.8 respectively.  
After study withdrawal , treatment will be decided by the investigator according to clinical 
judgment and may consist of topical, oral or  surgical treatment.

Page  35 of 77 9 TREATMENTS  
9.1 Details of Study Treatments  
The drug product REC 0/0559  is an ophthalmic solution  packaged in single -use blow fill seal  
(BFS) containers.  The solution will be stored at room temperature (below 25°C).  
Patients are to use a s ingle BFS container per study drug administration (ie, 4 BFS containers per 
day).  
Three strengths (5, 25, and 50 μg/ mL) of ophthalmic solution with MT8 will be prepared , one for 
each active treatment arm .  
For the comparator, an ophthalmic solution of the same composition as the study drug without the 
active substance MT8 (vehicle) will be used. Th e vehicle  is identical in appearance and packaging 
to the study drug , and study drugs are labelled in a masked manner.  
All study drug will be provided by the Sponsor  and will be packaged and labelled in accordance  
with the principles and the detailed guidelines of Good Manufacturing Practice ( GMP ) for 
Medicinal Product s. The primary label as well as the secondary container labelling will be in 
country specific language. Label contents will be compliant with local regulatory requirements. 
All study drug provided will be stored in a secure locked area with access limited to those 
authorised by the investigator and under controlled storage conditions described in t he product ’s 
labelling.  
For each patient entering in the study, the investigator will be provided with a set of numbered 
study drug kit s each containing 4 pouches of 10 eye drop solution single dose units (BFS  
containers ) with 0.5  mL each of REC 0/0559  (5, 25, or 50 μg/mL) or vehicle . Each study drug kit  
will provid e treatment for a period of 7 days , and contain treatment for  3 additional days as spare.  
9.2 Dosage Schedule  
Patients will be directed to administer , by themselves or with assistance from a relative or 
caregiver,  1 drop of study drug (approximately 25  µL) 4 times a day at 4 -hour intervals 
(± 30 minutes) starting in the morning in the study  eye, for the duration of the 8 -week 
double -masked  treatment period. If a drop does not reach the eye dur ing study drug administration, 
a second drop should be administered from the same BFS container.  
The total daily dose for the vehicle  and 5, 25, and 50 μg/mL arms will therefore be 0, 0.5, 2.5 and 
5 µg/day . 
On Day 1, the total number of drops administered may be adapted depending on the time of first 
dose administration (ie, a decreased number of administrations may occur if treatment is started  in 
the afternoon ). 
On Day 7 /Visit 3  (±1 day ), the first 24 patients enroll ed in the study will be required to take their 
first daily dose of study drug at the study site.

Page  36 of 77 Administration of any other topical treatments in the eye is required to take place at least 
15 minutes before  or after REC 0/0559  administration , and it is highly recommended to administer 
other topical treatments at least 1 hour before  or after REC 0/0559  administration . 
If clinically required, s tudy drug can be continued, temporarily interrupted , or stopped at the 
discretion of the investigator , as describe d in Section  8.4.1 . If study drug is interrupted, w hen 
medically possible  and indicated , study drug should be restarted . 
9.3 Measures to Minim ise Bias: Study Drug  Assignment  and Mask ing 
 Method of Study Drug  Assignment  
Patients will be randomly assigned by central randomis ation to 1 of the 4 treatment groups. 
Randomis ation will be stratified by disease stage  and region . The first 24 patients will be assigned 
in a 3:1 ratio to active treatment ( 1 drop QID of either 5 , 25, or 50  µg/mL MT8 ) or vehicle , starting 
with the 5  µg/mL dose of MT8. Enrolment will proceed sequentially to the next highest dose level 
unless the DMC  recommend s a change (that can occur at any time based on ongoing review of the 
safety, tolerability, and PK data ). After a formal DMC  review of all safety, tolerability, and PK 
data in the first 24 patients (6 each assigned to 1 drop QID of 5, 25, and 50  µg/mL MT8, and 
6 vehicle ), if the DMC  does not recommend any change to the dosing schedule, patients will be 
enrolled in all 4 treatment arms in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.   
Randomis ation will be performed through an interactive web response system (IWRS)  integrated 
in the eCRF (Randomi sation and Trial Supply Management module). The r andomis ation request, 
randomisation number allocation, and study drug kit  number  allocation at selected visits will be 
performed in the eCRF.  
At each site,  Subject ID number  will be assigned by IWRS to patients who have consented to 
participate in the study. Data obtained for each patient will be identified with the Subject ID 
number .  
 Mask ing 
The study is investigator -mask ed and patient -mask ed (investigators and patients  will not have 
knowledge of the treatment or dose received) . The Sponsor and study  monitor will also be mask ed 
during the study . All assessments of efficacy and safety will be performed by a mask ed investigator 
(or other qualified, mask ed study  staff membe r). 
The investigator or designee will obtain the study drug kit number from the IWRS for the patient  
according to the randomisation schedule as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2). 
The allocated study drug will be delivered to the patient in accordance with the pharmacy manual 
by the pharmacist or designee at the study centre.  
No study site personnel, patients , Sponsor personnel , or Sponsor designees will be un mask ed to 
treatment assignment throughout the duration of the study  unless un mask ing is required . If an 
investigator becomes un mask ed to a given patient’s  study treatment, that  patient  will be 
discontinued from the study  drug unless there are ethical reasons for that patient  not to be 
discontinued; approval from the medical monitor must be obtained in such instances.

Page  37 of 77 Any un masking  at the study site level should be done only in an emergency that requires the study 
treatment to be identified for the medical management of the participant. In the event that 
emergency unmask ing is required for a given patient  because of  AEs or concerns for the patient’s  
safety , the investigator may break the randomis ation code for the patient  via the IWRS , by which 
system the un mask ing will be captured . The investigator is responsible for notifying  the medical 
monitor and /or Sponsor of such an event as soon as possible. The un mask ing and its cause will 
also be documented in the eCRF.  
9.4 Dosage Modification  
Dosage modification is not allowed, as the study is conducted in a double -masked manner. Patient s 
should receive the study drug with the agreed frequency  and in the concentration assigned by the 
randomis ation system.  
Patients who do not tolerate study drug or experience worsening disease may be withdrawn from 
study drug as described in Section  8.4.  
9.5 Treatment Accountability and Compliance  
The investigator  will be responsible at the site level  for maintenance of records of study drug 
delivered to the study site , the inventory at the study site, the distribution to and use by each patient , 
and the return of materials to the Sponsor for storage or disposal.  These records should include 
dates, quantities, batch numbers, expiration dates, in -clinic temperature log, and  study drug kit  
numbers assigned.  
At each visit after initiation of treatment, study site personnel will record compliance of the patient  
with the patient’s  assigned regimen.  Patients  will be instructed to bring their unused/partially 
used/empty containers  back for inspection at each study visit  and the number of opened BFS 
containers will be recorded . Patients will also be instructed to fill out a paper diary recording the 
date and time of study drug administration, which should be brought to the site at each study visit 
and revi ewed with the patient. Patients  are to be reminded of the importance of compliance with 
their assigned  regimen,  with an emphasis on taking their study drug on schedule and maintaining 
the prescribed interval between doses.  
At each study visit during the treatment period, the patient will have to bring back used and unused 
BFS as well the diary . At Day 3 (±1 day) Visit, the investigator should review the patient’s diary 
in order to discuss with the patient any issue in compliance so that this is corrected by the Day 7 
(±1 day) Visit . 
 Patient compliance with the treatment will be assessed  at each study visit during the treatment 
period . 
Investigators will maintain records that adequately document that the patients  were provided with 
the correct study drug kits and reconcile  the products received from the drug dispensing centre . 
Study drug  will not be returned to the Sponsor  until accountability has been fully monitored.

Page  38 of 77 Study drug kits  must be returned at each visit, as compliance will be assessed by number of opened 
BFS containers . Noncompliance is defined as taking less than < 80% or more than 120% of study 
drug during any outpatient evaluation period (visit to visit).  Discontinuation  of treatment  for 
noncompliance is at the investigator’s discretion  and is to be noted on the eCRF.  
Upon completion or termination of the study, all  remaining study drug will be retained according 
to applicable regulations. Once the retention period has elapse d, any remaining drug will be 
returned to the Sponsor in the original containers, or destroyed, as directed in writing by the 
Sponsor.

The Schedule of Assessments (Table  2) outlines the efficacy assessments to be performed 
throughout the study and their timing . 
11.1 Slit Lamp Examination/Fluorescein Staining  
 Slit Lamp Examination  
A slit lamp  is an instrument consisting of a  biomicroscope and high-intensity light source that can 
be focused to s hine a thin sheet of light into the eye. The slit lamp  facilitates an examination of the 
anterior segment and posterior segment of the human eye, which includes the eyelid, sclera, 
conjunctiva,  cornea,  iris, natural crystalline lens, and vitreous body . The slit lamp examination will 
be performed according to local medical practice and applicable medical standards at the site.   
The slit lamp examination must be performed before the instillation of any dilating or anaesthetic 
eye drops or the fluorescein agen t. Slit lamp examination  will assess the anterior eye segment 
general status but in particular will concentrate on corneal abnormalities such as:  
• Presence of PED  
• Presence of corneal ulcer  
• Progression in lesion depth to corneal melting or perforation  
• Presence of infection  
• Presence of any other condition that may influence subject eligibility or study endpoints  
• Corneal photo without fluorescein:  A photo of the cornea of the study eye will be taken 
after slit lamp examination and before the instillation of fluorescein agent by a slit lamp 
camera focusing on the epithelial defect and using white, diffuse (homogenous) frontal 
illumination.  All sites will be trained for standardisation of the corneal photo without 
fluorescein and the accompanying manual will  be provided.  
 Fluorescein Staining  
Fluorescein allows identification of corneal damage.4 The use of  fluorescein  stain, which is taken 
up by exposed corneal stroma and appears green, helps in defining the surface and margins of the  
corneal damage.  Corneal healing will be defined as no fluorescein staining in the area of the PED 
or corneal ulcer as assessed by an independent central reading.  
After a standard slit lamp examination, fluorescein wil l be administered to the study  eye and an 
anterior eye segment photograph will be taken. All sites will be trained for standardisation of 
fluorescein use and the accompanying manual will be provided.  
The following assessments and procedures will be performed as part of the fluorescein staining:  
• Following the instillation of fluorescein in the study  eye the size of the PED or corneal 
ulcer (length of the greatest dimension and the length of the perpendicula r dimension 
expressed in mm) and the grade (density) of the corneal fluorescein staining outside of the

This document is confidential.  
Page  54 of 77 area of the PED or corneal ulcer using the Oxford scale must be assessed at the slit lamp 
using a yellow barrier filter and cobalt blue illumination.  
• The location of the PED or corneal ulcer will be assessed as central or not.  
• Corneal photo with fluorescein: Within 5 minutes after the instillation of the fluorescein a 
corneal photo of the study  eye using a yellow barrier filter and cobalt blue illuminatio n will 
be taken to document the observed corneal findings.  
• Instillation of fluorescein and grading of the corneal staining using the Oxford scale in the 
fellow eye should be performed after the corneal photo with fluorescein has been 
completed in the study eye (at the Screening Visit  and Visit  8/ET; see Table  2). 
11.2 Corneal Sensitivity  
The Cochet -Bonnet aesthesiometer  will be used to quantify corneal sensitivity. A nylon filament 
from 0 to 6  cm in length is touched  to each quadrant of the cornea to elicit a blink or a patient 
response. The length of the nylon filament in cm when response is elicited (ie, the resistance) is 
the quantification of corneal sensitivity .  
11.3 BCDVA  Examination  
Assessment of BCDVA for the study eye and the fellow eye will be done  using the ETDRS 
protocol .20 Distance visual acuity will be measured with best correction. Qualified st udy personnel 
following manifest refraction and  using certified visual acuity equipment/lanes will perform the 
assessment. The BCDVA should precede any examination requiring contact with the study eye. 
The method of visual acuity assessment should remain c onsistent throughout a patient’s study 
participation.  
The BCDVA examination  will start from the distance of 4 m eters  from the chart. The n umber of 
letters correctly read by the patient  will be collected. Eyes reading 19 or fewer letters correctly at 
4 meters should be tested at a 1 meter distance. If visual acuity is so poor that the patient  cannot 
read any  letter from  1 meter then counting fingers, hand motion test , and light perception should 
be tested.  
A detailed description of the ETD RS BCDVA procedure will be provided to sites in form of an 
accompanying manual.

Page  55 of 77 12 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Safety assessments  (vital signs, physical examinations, ECG recording, AEs, SAEs , clinical 
laboratory results [routine haematology  and biochemistry], and ophthalmological examination ) are 
to be performed at protocol -specified visits, as specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Table  2). 
12.1 Vital Signs  
Vital signs (heart rate  and systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements) will be evaluated 
at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table  2). All vital signs will be measured 
after the patient  has been resting in a sitting position for at least 5 minutes. Blood pressure 
measurements are to be taken in the same arm  for the duration of the study.  
Vital sign measurements will be repeated if machine/equipment errors occur. Out -of-range blood 
pressure or heart rate measurements will be repeated at the investigator’s discretion. Any 
abnormalities detected before  signing the ICF or at the Screening Visi t should be recorded as part 
of the patient’s medical history. Any confirmed, clinically significant vital sign measurements 
found during the study must be recorded as an AE.  
12.2 Physical Examination  
A limited physical examination to verify continued patient  eligibility and to follow up regarding 
any change in medical history will be performed at the visits indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table  2). Symptom -driven, limited physical examinations will be performed by a 
physician as clinically indicated at any study visit. Any abnormalities detected before  signing the 
ICF or at the Screening Visit  should be recorded as part of the patient’s medical hist ory. Any 
confirmed, clinically significant physical examination abnormalities found during the study must 
be recorded as AEs.  
Height will be collected at the Screening Visit . Weight will be collected as indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2). 
12.3 Electrocardiograms  
A 12 -lead, resting ECG will be obtained at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table  2). 
An assessment of normal or abnormal will be recorded; if the ECG is considered abnormal, the 
abnormality will be documented on the eCRF. ECGs will be repeated if artefacts are present. Any 
abnormalities detected before  signing the ICF or at the Screening Visit  should be recorded as part 
of the patient’s medical history. Any confirmed, clinically relevant ECG abnormality found during 
the study must be recorded as an AE.  
ECGs will be performed as described in the Schedule of Assessments in the first 24 patients. After 
formal review of data from the 24 first patients, the DMC may decide to discontinue ECG 
examination for other patients (this will be described in the DMC cha rter).

A full ophthalmic examination , including slit lamp examination of eyelids, lashes, conjunctiva, 
cornea, lens, iris, and anterior chamber,  will be performed in all patient s by the investigator.  Any 
abnormalities detecte d before  signing the ICF  or at the S creening Visit should be recorded as part 
of the patient’s medical history.  Any confirmed, clinically significant abnormality found during 
the study  must be recorded as an AE. 
12.5 Fundus Examination  
The fundus examination m ay be performed by binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy , fundus 
biomicroscopy  or wide field fundus . The assessment of the fundus may require use of pupil dilating 
topical medication. If wide field fundus is used, pupil dilating topical medication may not be u sed. 
The f ollowing structures may be assessed during the fundus examination: retina, vitreous, macula, 
choroid, and optic nerve . Any abnormalities detected before  signing the ICF or at the Screening 
Visit  should be recorded as part of the patient’s medical history. Any confirmed, clinically 
significant abnormality found during the study must be recorded as an AE.  
12.6 Laboratory Assessments  
Laboratory assessment samples ( Table  3) are to be obtained at designated visits as detailed in the

Page  57 of 77 Blood samples will be analysed  at a central laboratory facility. All laboratory reports must be 
reviewed, signed, and dated by the investigator. A legible copy of a ll reports must be filed with 
both the patient’s  eCRF and medical record (source document) for that visit.  
All clinically significant out -of-range laboratory values at the Screening Visit  will be recorded in 
the medical history form ( the investigator shoul d report a diagnosis rather than the laboratory value 
whenever possible). All clinically significant out -of-range laboratory values after the Screening 
Visit  are to be reported as an AE.  
Any laboratory test result considered by the investigator to be clinically significant should be 
considered an AE (clinically significant AEs include those that require an intervention) if this 
abnormality was not present at the Screening Visit  or is asses sed as having worsened since the 
Screening Visit  (ie, changed significantly from the Screening Visit ). Clinically significant 
abnormal values occurring during the study will be followed up until repeat test results return to 
normal, stabilise, or are no lo nger clinically significant.  
12.7 Adverse Events  
 Adverse Events  
An AE is any symptom, physical sign, syndrome, or disease that either emerges during the study 
or, if present at the Screening Visit , worsens during the study, regardless of the suspected cause of 
the event. All medical conditions (except those related to the indication under study) present at the 
Screening Visit  will be documented in the medical history eCRF. Changes in these conditio ns and 
new symptoms, physical signs, syndromes, or diseases should be noted on the AE eCRF during 
the rest of the study. Clinically significant findings from laboratory assessments, vital signs 
measurements, ECGs , and  other procedures that result in a diag nosis should also be recorded as 
AEs.  Surgical procedures that were planned before the patient  enrolled in the study are not 
considered AEs if the conditions were known before study inclusion; the medical condition should 
be reported in the patient’s  medic al history.  
Patients  will be instructed to report AEs at each study visit. All AEs are to be followed up until 
resolution or a stable clinical endpoint is reached.  
Each AE is to be documented on the eCRF with reference to date of onset, duration, frequency, 
severity, seriousness, relationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of event, 
and outcome. For ocular AEs, the eye (study eye or fellow  eye) must be recorded on the eCRF as 
well. Furthermore, each AE is to be classified as being serious or nonserious. Changes in AEs and 
resolution dates are to be documented on the eCRF.  
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation for collection of AEs extends from the 
time the patient gives informed consent until the last Follow -up Visit . Follow -up of the AE, even 
after the date of therapy discontinuation, is required if the AE persists until the event resolves or 
stabil ises at a level acceptable to the investigator.

This document is confidential.  
Page  58 of 77 When changes i n the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the event should be noted. If the intensity category changes over a number of days, 
then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
Spec ific guidelines for classifying AEs by intensity and relationship to study drug are given in 
Table  4 and Table  5. 
Table  4. Classification of Adverse Events by Intensity  
MILD : An AE that is easily tolerated by the patient , causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with 
everyday activities.  
MODERATE : An AE that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.  
SEVERE : An AE that prevents normal everyday activities.  
Abbreviation: AE, adverse event.  
 
Table  5. Classification  of Adverse Events by Relationship to Study Drug  or Study Procedure  
UNRELATED : AEs with no reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug and/or that 
can reasonably be explained by other factors, such as underlying diseases, complicatio ns, concomitant drugs , 
and concurrent treatments.  
RELATED :  AEs with reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug (including the 
course after withdrawal of the study drug), or for which possible involvement of the study drug cannot b e ruled 
out, although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, complications, concomitant drugs , and  
concurrent treatments, may also be responsible.  
Abbreviation: AE, adverse event.  
 
 Adverse Events of Special Inter est 
An AESI  (serious or non -serious) is an event of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or programme, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the 
investigator to the Sponsor could be appropriate. Such an event might requir e further investigation 
in order to characterise and understand it. Depending on the nature of the event, rapid 
communication by the study  Sponsor to other parties (eg, DMC, regulators) might also be 
warranted.  
The f ollowing AEs are considered AESI : 
1. Cornea l calcifications in the study eye, independent of intensity  
2. All non -serious AEs  that are  severe in intensity and considered related to the study drug 
Any AESI occurring from the time informed consent is obtained, during the study, or within 
4 weeks of stopping study drug  must be reported to the Syneos  Health Safety and 
Pharmacovigilance group . Any AESI must be reported within 24 hours of occurrence or when  the 
investigator becomes aware of the event using the process described in Section  12.7.4 . Syneos 
Health will communicate these AESI within one business day  to the Sponsor Safety and Medical 
department .

 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence, in the view of either the 
investigator or Sponsor , that : 
• results in death,  
• is life -threatening , 
• results in inpatient hospital isation or prolongation of existing hospital isation , 
• results in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity , and/or  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• is an important medical event ( other important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threat ening or result in death or hospital isation, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, are considered serious AEs [SAEs ] if they are thought to jeopard ise the patient  
and/or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes defining an  
SAE )  
Serious AEs are critically important for the identification of significant safety problems; therefore, 
it is important to take into account both the investigator’s and the Sponsor’s assessment. If either 
the Sponsor or the investigator believes that  an event is serious, the event must be considered 
serious and evaluated by the Sponsor for expedited reporting.  
 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Other Adverse Events Requiring 
Immediate Reporting  
An SAE occurring from the time informed consent is obtained, during the study , or within 4 weeks 
of stopping study drug  must be reported to the Syneos  Health Safety and P harmacovigilance group . 
Any such SAE due to any cause, whether or not related to the study drug, must b e reported within 
24 hours of awareness .  
The eCRF should be used for SAE reporting , however, notification can also be made using the 
dedicated fax line or email for the Syneos  Health pharmacovigilance group:  
Syneos  Health Safety and Pharmacovigilance fax number: +1-877-464-7787  
Syneos  Health Safety and Pharmacovigilance email address: 
SafetyReporting@SyneosHealth.com  
If the investigator contacts the Syneos  Health pharmacovigilance group  or clinical research 
associate by telephone, then a written report must follow within 24 hours and is to include a full 
description of the event and sequelae in the format detailed in the SAE reporting form.  
The event must also be recorded on the standard AE eCRF. Preliminary reports of SAEs must be 
followed up by detaile d descriptions later on, including clear and anonym ised photocopies of other 
documents when requested and applicable. SAE reports must be made whether or not the 
investigator considers the event to be related to the study drug.

This document is confidential.  
Page  60 of 77 Appropriate remedial measures should be taken to treat the SAE, and the outcome  should be 
recorded  in the eCRF . Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed as needed 
in order to determine the aetiology  of the problem. The investigator must report all additional 
follow -up evaluations to the Syneos  Health Safety and Pharmacovigilance  group within 24 hours 
of becoming aware of the additional information or as soon as  is practicable . All SAEs will be 
followed up until the investigator and Sponsor  agree the event is satisfactorily resolved.  
Any SAE that is not resolved by the end of the study or upon discontinuation of the patient’s  
participation in the study is to be followed up until it either resolves, stabil ises, returns to baseline 
value s (if a baseline value is available), or is shown to not be attributable to the study drug or 
procedures.  
Syneos  Health  will determine whether the event meets the criteria for being reportable as a 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction ( SUSAR ).  
 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
Adverse event s that meet all of the following criteria will be classified as SUSARs and reported 
to the appropriate regulatory authorities in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements for 
expedited re porting:  
• serious  
• unexpected (ie, the event is not consistent with information in the Reference Safety 
Information section of  the IB)  
• there is at least a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the event 
and the study drug 
There a re no expected AEs  for MT8 . Each case of AE assessed as related to study drug and 
fulfilling seriousness criteria will be assumed to be a SUSAR.  
The investigator will assess whether an event is causally related to study drug. Syneos Health will 
consider th e investigator’s assessment and determine whether the event meets the criteria for being 
reportable as a 7 -day or 15 -day safety report.  
Fatal or life -threatening SUSARs must be reported to the regulatory authorities and the 
IEC/ institutional review boards  (IRBs ) (where required) within 7 days after the Sponsor or Syneos 
Health has first knowledge of them, with a follow -up report submitted within a further 8 calendar 
days, where applicable.  
Other SUSARs must be reported to the relevant regulatory authoriti es and the IEC/IRBs within 
15 calendar days after the Sponsor or Syneos Health first has knowledge of them.  
Syneos Health is responsible for reporting SUSARs and any other events required to be reported 
in an expedited manner to the regulatory authorities and for informing investigators of reportable 
events, in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements within specific timeframes.

Page  61 of 77 Investigators will notify the relevant IEC/IRBs of reportable events within the applicable 
timeframes.  
12.8 Pregnancy  
Women of childbearing potential ( WOCBP) must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the 
Screening Visit . Following  administration of study drug, any known cases of pregnancy in female 
patients  will be reported until the patient  completes or withdraws from the study. The pregnancy 
will be reported immediately by faxing/emailing a completed pregnancy report to Syneos He alth 
within 24  hours of knowledge of the event. The pregnancy will not be processed as an SAE; 
however, the investigator will follow up with the patient  until completion of the pregnancy and 
must assess the outcome in the shortest possible time but not mor e than 30  days after completion 
of the pregnancy. The investigator should notify Syneos Health  of the pregnancy outcome by 
submitting a follow -up pregnancy report. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for 
immediate classification as a SAE (ie , spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or 
congenital anomaly [including anomaly detected in an aborted foetus]), the investigator will follow 
the procedures for reporting a SAE within 24 hours of awareness.  Syneos Health will forward all 
cases  of pregnancy to the Sponsor ( Medical and Safety Department ) within one business day . 
Upon discontinuation from the study, only those procedures that would not expose the patient  to 
undue risk in the investigator’s judgment will be performed. The investiga tor should also be 
notified of pregnancy occurring during the study but confirmed after completion of the study. In 
the event that a patient is subsequently found to be pregnant after inclusion in the study, any 
pregnancy will be followed to term, and the status of mother and child will be reported to the 
Sponsor and Syneos Health after delivery.  
12.9 Other Reportable Information  
Certain information, although not considered an SAE , must be recorded, reported , and  followed 
up as indicated for an SAE. This includ es the following:  
• Overdose of an investigational product with or without an AE . For this study, an overdose 
is defined as an increase of the intake frequency of the study medication to more than 
8 times  per day (ie, >  2 × the daily dose specified in the p rotocol).  
• Inadvertent or accidental exposure to an investigational product with or without an AE.  
• Medication errors with or without an AE (medication error is an administration of study 
drug that does not match what was allocated by randomisation, administration o f an expired 
study drug, or administration of a study drug that has not met storage condition s as 
described in the protocol , and use outside what is f oreseen in the protocol, including other 
storage conditions) .    
• Misuse , where the medicinal product is intentionally used not in accordance with the 
protocol . 
• Any suspicion of transmission of an infectious agent via an investigational product .

The NEI  VFQ -25 consists of 25 vision -targeted questions that represent 11 vision -related quality 
of life subscales (ocular pain; near activities; distance activities; vision specific social functioning, 
mental health, role difficulties, and dependency; driving; co lour vision; and peripheral vision) and 
one general health item.21,22 This questionnaire will be administered at all study sites by masked 
study site personnel (interviewer).  
This questionnaire will be presented in its interviewer -administered  format in the loca l language 
and should be administered in a quiet room by a study -related person qualified to administer this 
type of questionnaire, preferably before other visit procedures are performed.  
14.2 NRS for Ocular Symptoms and Tolerability  
The NRS of ocular symptom s and tolerability will use an 11 -point scale  (see APPENDIX  2). The 
scale question will be “On average since your last visit how would you rate the following 
symptoms in your treated eye on the scale 0 to 10, 0 means no symptoms and 10 means the worst 
possible discomfort. The scale will be administered for each of the following 7 symptoms: foreign 
body sensation, burning/stinging, itching, ocular pain, sticky feeling, blurred vision , and  
photophobia.”  
14.3 Study Drug Diary  
Patients will fill out a paper diary recording the date and time of study drug administration. Study 
staff will provide the diary and instruct patients in how to use the diary. The diary should be 
brought to the site at each study visit and the study staff sh ould review the diary with the patient 
to encourage compliance with study drug dosing.   
The diary will also be used at Day 28/Visit  6 (±2 days) and Day 56/Visit 8 (±3 days)  to determine 
the timing for PK sampling (see Section  13.1.1  for details).

A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared after the protocol is approved.  This document 
will provide further details regarding the definition of analysis variables and analysis methodology 
to address all study objectives.  The SAP will serve as a compliment to the protocol and supersedes 
it in case of differences.  
Subgroup analyses may be defined and added in the SAP, before the database lock, such as gender, 
NK grade, region or other based on specific characteristics of the enrolled population.  
The statistical evaluation will be performed using SAS® software  version 9.4 or higher 
(SAS  Institute, Cary, NC).  All data will be listed, and summary tables will be provided.  Summary 
statistics will be presented by dose group.  For continuous variables, data will be summar ised with 
the number of patients  (N), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum by 
treatment group.  For categorical varia bles, data will be tabulated with the number and proportion 
of patients  for each category by treatment group.  
No formal interim analysis is planned.  
15.1 Determination of Sample Size 
A total of 108 patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 active treatme nt arms or the vehicle  
treatment arm (27  patients per arm). Randomisation will be stratified by disease stage (Stage 2, 
Stage 3) and region (Europe, North America)   
Considering a n estimated  response rate of 27% for the vehicle  treatment arm based on studie s 
conducted in a similar patient population with cenegermin (O xervate )23 and with approximately 
80% of power and a two -sided alpha 0.05, the sample size of 27 patients per group (including a 
15% estimate of dropout rate) should allow analysis to show a difference o f at least 45% between 
the active treatment arms and the vehicle  treatment arm.  
15.2 Analysis Populations  
Enrolled  Population  
The enrolled population will include all individuals who sign the ICF.  
Modified Intent -to-Treat Population  
The intent -to-treat ( ITT) population will include all patients  who are randomis ed and receive at 
least 1 drop of study drug , irrespective of any deviation from the protocol or premature 
discontinuation.  The treatment group assignment will be designated according to initial 
randomi sation.  The ITT population will serve as the basis for the analysis of efficacy.

Page  65 of 77  
Safety Population  
The safety population will include all randomis ed patients  who receive at least 1  dose of study 
drug.  The treatment group assignment in this population wi ll be defined by the treatment actually 
received.  This population will be used for the analysis of safety.  
Per-protocol Population  
The per-protocol (PP) population will include all patients in the ITT population for whom no major 
protocol violations/deviations occurred.  
15.3 Efficacy Analysis  
 Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary endpoint will be analysed by means of the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel chi -square test, 
controlling for disease stage. Hierarchical testing will be performed to account for multiplicity.  
Benjamini -Hochberg procedure will be applied.  
The primary analysis will be performed on the ITT population and will consider rescue treatment 
initiation or randomis ed treatment discontinuations due to related AEs as failures, whil e all the 
other missing data will be managed according with the last observation carried forward ( LOCF ) 
method.  
A secondary analysis will be performed with the same criteria but including also the data (if 
available) collected after treatment discontinuati on (in this case not considered as failure).  
As sensitivity analyses, the primary analysis will be repeated on the ITT population by means of 
the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel chi -square test, controlling for disease stage and site (pooled to 
ensure adequate str ata sizes), with missing data imputed as failures, with observed data only and 
on the PP population.  
 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Categorical secondary endpoints will be analysed using the same analysis used for the primary 
endpoint.  
The analys is of c ontinuous endpoints will be based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with 
treatment and site as main effects and baseline value and disease stage as covariates.  
Time to event endpoints will be evaluated by means of Kaplan -Meier survival analysis using 
log-rank test. The Cox’s proportional hazard model will be used in order to manage covariates in 
the proper way.  
15.4 Analysis of Other Exploratory Endpoints  
Scores for the NEI VFQ -25 will be calculated according to the NEI VFQ -25 scoring algorithm 
(composite score and subscales).21,22  
An overall NRS score will be calculated as the mean of individual symptoms score s.

Page  66 of 77 15.5 Safety Analysis  
All reported AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA) . 
The incidence of treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs; events with onset dates on or after the start of 
the study drug) will be included in incidence tables. Events with missing onset dates will be 
included as treatment -emergent. If a patient  experiences more than one occurrence of the sam e 
AE, the occurrence with the greatest severity and the closest association with the study drug will 
be used in the summary tables. S erious AEs and AEs causing discontinuation will be tabulated. 
All AEs will be listed by patient , along with information reg arding onset, duration, relationship 
and severity to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of event, and outcome . 
Clinical laboratory data and vital signs will be summar ised using descriptive statistics, including 
mean values and mean change from baseline values, as well as numbers of patients  with values 
outside limits of the normal range at each time point.  
Summary tables will be provided for concomitant medications initiated during the study  period.  
15.6 Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
The standard PK parameters of peak plasma concentration  and area under the curve will be 
estimated by standard noncompartmental methods. This description could also include single - and 
multiple -dose parameters, use of WinNonlin program, linear least squares, etc . 
15.7 Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis is planned.  
15.8 Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent  DMC  will be established by the Sponsor  to review accumulating safety data at 
regular intervals throughout the study and monitor overall study conduct.  Members will include 
experts in ophthalmology  and biostatistics, who are not participating in this study and do not have 
an affiliation with the invest igators or the Sponsor . The DMC  can recommend in writing to the 
Sponsor whether to continue, modify, or s top the clinical study based on  safety considerations.  
The DMC will review information related to any non-serious  AEs that are considered to be severe 
and possibly related to the study drug  and other AESI as defined in Section  12.7.2 , to any SAE, or 
any serum drug concentration more than  10 nM on an ongoing basis in the first 24 patients treated 
with study drug. A formal re view of the data will be conducted 7 days  after the 24th patient has 
been enrolled  and the DMC will recommend whether to continue enrolling patients in all treatment 
arms.  The DMC may also recommend discontinuing the 12 -lead ECG assessment in the remaining  
patients (if no significant systemic exposure to the study drug is observed).  Another formal review 
of the safety data by the DMC will be conducted 8 we eks after approximately 50% ( 54) patients 
have been enrolled . 
The DMC ’s specific duties as well as stat istical monitoring guidelines and procedures and potential 
stopping rules will be fully described in a DMC charter.

 Regulatory Guidelines  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the accepted version of the Declaration of 
Helsinki and/or all relevant regulations , as set forth in Parts 50, 56, 312, Subpart D, of Title 21 of 
the United States Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), in compliance with International Council 
for Harmonisation (ICH) and Good Clinical Pr actice  (GCP ) guidelines , and according to the 
appropriate regulatory requirements in the countries where the study was conducted . 
 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
Conduct of the study must be approved by an appropriately constituted independent ethics 
committee (IEC)/ institutional review board ( IRB). Approval is required for the study protocol, 
protocol amendments (if applicable), IB, ICFs,  recruitment material , patient  information sheets , 
and other patient -facing material . 
 Informed Consent  
For each study patient , written informed consent will be obtained before  any protocol -related 
activities.  As part of this procedure, the Principal Investigator (PI) or designee  must explain orally 
and in writing the nature  of the study, its purpose , procedures, expected duration, alternative 
therapy available, and the benefits and risks involved in study participation . The patient  should be 
informed that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time, and the patient  will receive all 
information tha t is required by local regulations and guidelines for ICH.  The PI will provide the 
Sponsor  or its representative with a copy of the IEC-/IRB-approved ICF before  the start of the 
study.  
16.2 Data Handling  
Clinical data will be captured via the secure, internet -based electronic data capture  (EDC) system, 
provided and managed by the contract research organ isation ( CRO ) Syneos Health for 
transmission to the Sponsor.  
Access to the EDC system will be available t o only author ised and trained users via the study’s 
internet web site, where a user unique assigned username and password are required for access.  
The clinical data will be entered by the investigator /site staff and will be transmitted directly into 
the ce ntral clinical database. The central laboratory data will be received in electronic format and 
uploaded electronically. The IWRS data will be directly integrated with the eCRF instead.  
Site personnel will be trained during the site initiation visit. A reco rd of the completed training 
will be archived. The investigator should enter data close to real -time and for the full duration of 
the clinical study , to ensure Sponsor and CRO have visibility of all data. The eCRF must be kept 
current to reflect patient  status at each phase during the course of the study . The investigator will 
approve the data using an electronic signature, and this approval is used to confirm the accuracy 
of the data recorded. A complete electronic audit trail will be maintained.

This document is confidential.  
Page  68 of 77 Any data to be recorded directly on the eCRFs (to be considered as source data) will be identified 
at the start of the study.  Data reported on the eCRF that are derived from source documents should 
be consistent with the source documents, or the discrepanc ies must be explained.  See also 
Section  16.3.  
Data on eCRFs must correspond to and be supported by source documentation maintained at the 
study sit e, unless the study site makes direct data entry to the databases for which no other original 
or source documentation is maintained.  In such cases, the study site should document which data 
are subject to direct data entry and should have in place procedur es to obtain and retain copies of 
the information submitted by direct data entry.  All study forms and records transmitted to the 
Sponsor  must only include coded identifiers such that directly  identifying personal information is 
not transmitted.   
Clinical data will be reviewed by Syneos Health data managemen t/clinical research associate 
(CRA ) staff by way of both manual and electronic edit checks for consistency and completeness. 
The data review by data management will allow the generation of queri es for the clarification of 
unclear/missing/ inconsistent data. The errors found will be assessed by the data manager /CRA of 
the study and investigators will be involved in resolving them.  
Any changes made to data after collection will be made using  the ED C system . Electronic case 
report form s will be considered complete when all missing and/or incorrect data have been 
resolved.  
The process of data  entry and data  cleaning will start when the study is still in the phase of 
treatment/follow -up and should be c ompleted soon after the study completion in all patient s. After 
all corrections to the data are made, the database will be “locked” and no data will be changed 
without adequate documentation.  
Copies of the eCRFs together with all data changes made will be supplied to the investigator at the 
end of the study . The investigator will be responsible for retaining all records pertaining to the 
study  as specified in the appropriate contract ( see also Section  16.4). At the end of the study, a 
copy of the eCRFs and of all SAS datasets will be provided to the Sponsor on electronic support.  
The worki ng procedures used will be documented in the Data Management Plan.  
16.3 Source Documents  
Source documents are considered to be all information in original records and certified copies of 
original records of clinical findings, observations, data , or other activi ties in a clinical study 
necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study.  The investigator will provide direct 
access to source documents and/or source data in the facilitation of study -related monitoring, 
audits, review by IECs/IRBs, and regulatory inspections.  
The investigator/institution should maintain adequate and accurate source documents and study  
records that include all pertinent observations on each of the site’s study  patients . Source data 
Recordati Rare Diseases  REC0559 -B-001

source data should be traceable, not obscure the original entry, and be explained if necessary.  
16.4 Record Retention  
Study records and source documents must be preserved for at least 15 years after the com pletion 
or discontinuation of/withdrawal from the study , at least 2 years after the drug being studied has 
received its last approval for sale, or at least 2 years after drug development has stopped,  and in 
accordance with the applicable local privacy laws , whichever is the longer time period.  
The investigator agrees to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations 
of the US, EU relating to the privacy of patient  health information . The invest igator shall ensure 
that study patien ts author ise the use and disclosure of protected health information in accordance 
with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations  and in a form satisfactory to the 
Sponsor . 
16.5 Monitoring  
The study will be monitored  according to the CRO ’s monitoring plan to ensure that it is conducted 
and documented properly according to the protocol, GCP, and all applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
Monitoring visits  will be a combination  of on -site and telephone visits  and contacts will be made 
at appro priate times during the study.  The Principal Investigator will assure he/she and adequate 
site personnel are available throughout the study  to collaborate with clinical monitors. Clinical 
monitors must have direct access to source documentation in order to  check the completeness, 
clarity, and consistency of the data recorded in the eCRFs for each  patient . 
The invest igator will make available to the clinical monitor all source documents and medical 
records necessary to review protocol adherence and eCRFs . In addition, the invest igator will work 
closely with the clinical monitor and, as needed, provide them appropriate evidence that the study 
is being conducted in accordance with the protocol, applicable regulations , and GCP guidelines.  
16.6 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
The Sponsor  or its designee will perform the quality assurance and quality control activities of this 
study; however, responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, security, and reliability of the study 
data presented to the Sponsor  lies with the invest igator generating the data.  
The CRO  will arrange audits as part of the implementation of quality assurance to ensure that the 
study is being conducted in compliance with the protocol, standard operating procedures, GCP, 
and all applicable r egulatory requirements.  Audits will be independent of and separate from the 
routine monitoring and quality control functions.  Quality assurance procedures will be performed 
at study sites and during data management to assure that safety and efficacy data a re adequate and 
well documented.

 Protocol Amendment  
Amendments to the protocol that entail corrections of typographical errors, clarifications of 
confusing wording, changes in study personnel, and minor modificatio ns that have no effect on 
the safety of patients  or the conduct of the study will be classed as administrative (non-substantial) 
amendments and will be submitted to the IEC/ IRB for information only.  The Sponsor  will ensure 
that acknowledgement is received and filed.  Amendments that are classed as substantial 
amendments must be submitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities and the IECs/ IRBs for 
approval  and will not be implemented at sites until such approvals are received other than in the 
case of an urgent safety measure . 
 Protocol Deviations  
Should a protocol deviation occur, the Sponsor  must be informed as soon as possible.  Protocol 
deviations and/or violations and the reasons they occurred will be included in the clinical study 
report.  Reporting of protocol deviations to the IRB/IEC and in accordance with applicable 
regulatory authority mandates is a CRO  responsibility  and will be done according to th e local 
regulations .

Page  75 of 77 APPENDIX  1. CONTRACEPTION GUIDELINES  
Women of childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) and men whose sexual partners are WOCBP must use 
at least one highly effective method of contraception during the study and for 4 weeks  after the 
last dose of study drug.  
A woman is considered to be a WOCBP (fertile) following menarche and until becoming  
postmenopausal, unless she is permanently sterile. Permanent steril isation methods include 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is 
defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause . A high 
follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement 
therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a sin gle FSH measurement is 
insufficient.  
A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy.  
Highly effective methods of contraception are those which have a failure rate of <1% (when 
implemented consistently a nd correctly) and include:  
• combined (containing oestrogen  and progestogen) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (administration  may be ora l, intravaginal, or transdermal)  
• progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
(administration  may be o ral, injectable, or implantable)  
• intrauterine device  
• intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
• bilateral tubal ligation or occlusion  
• vasectomy (provided that the male has a medical assessment of surgical success)  
• sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire 
period of risk  in relation to the duration of the clinical study , in line with the preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the patient ) 
All patients  will be strongly advised  that they (or the female partners of male patients ) should not 
become pregnant wh ile on study drug or for 4 weeks  after the last dose. A female patient  will be 
advised that she must report immediately to the study site for pregnancy testing and appropriat e 
management in the event that she  may be pregnant.

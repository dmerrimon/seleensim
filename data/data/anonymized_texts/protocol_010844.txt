2PRÉCIS 
Background:
In 2016, it is estimated that there will be 76,960 new cases of bladder cancer and 16,390 deaths 
associated with bladder cancer.1 Bladder cancer is associated with the highest costs among all 
types of cancer, due to the need for lifelong routine monitoring and treatment.2 Approximately 
70% of cases are non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) at presentation and are treated 
by transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) followed by intravesical treatment with 
BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) or mitomycin C. However, in the setting of high grade disease, 
these therapies can become ineffective over time in up to two-thirds of patients and disease 
progression to muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) can occur.3  In patients who present with 
CIS (carcinoma in situ) rates of progression are greater than 50%.4  Progression to MIBC 
portends a poor outcome as only 50% of patients will survive five years despite undergoing 
radical cystectomy.5 Clearly, there is a large unmet need in therapeutic options for NMIBC that 
recurs or progresses.
Vicineum™ is a recombinant fusion protein, VB4-845, that contains a humanized single-chain 
antibody fragment specific for the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) antigen linked to 
ETA (252-608), a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (ETA). EpCAM is overexpressed 
on the surface of urothelial carcinoma cells and therefore represents a good target for 
Vicineum™ to bind to.  In a previous phase II study in BCG refractory or BCG intolerant 
patients with high grade bladder cancer, 16% of patients treated with induction and maintenance 
therapy with Vicineum™ remained disease-free at 1 year.  As a result, Vicineum™ is currently 
being evaluated as a single agent in a phase III trial.  
Pre-clinical work with a drug called Proxinium, an earlier version of Vicineum™, demonstrated 
an abscopal effect and synergy with the use of a checkpoint blockade inhibitor.  Although it was 
done in a NSCLC model, the results were impressive in causing tumor shrinkage. Durvalumab is 
a human monoclonal antibody (MAb) that inhibits binding of programmed cell death ligand 1 
(PD-L1) (B7 homolog 1 [B7-H1], cluster of differentiation [CD]274) to programmed cell death 1 
(PD-1; CD279) and CD80 (B7-1). Durvalumab has been demonstrated to have activity against 
advanced metastatic urothelial bladder cancer whose tumor has progressed during or after one 
standard platinum-based regimen in a phase I trial. 
Therefore, this trial will take two agents with single agent activity against urothelial cancer and 
combine them in a Phase I trial for patients with high-grade NMIBC Previously Treated with 
BCG.
Objectives:
Primary Objectives:
•To evaluate the safety and tolerability of durvalumab and Vicineum when administered in 
combination to subjects with BCG-refractory high-grade NMIBC
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
3Eligibility:
•Subjects must have a histologically-confirmed high-grade non-muscle invasive urothelial 
carcinoma (transitional cell carcinoma) of the bladder as follows: 
oCarcinoma-in-situ (CIS) with or without papillary tumors
oHigh-grade Ta or T1 disease based on a biopsy/TURBT performed within 12 weeks of 
the initial dose of study treatment.  If multiple bladder biopsies/TURBTs are required to 
confirm eligibility, the timing of the last bladder biopsy to the initial dose of study 
treatment must be within 12 weeks.
•Subjects with BCG unresponsive disease as defined by the Society of Urologic Oncology and 
the FDA6,7:  Subjects must have received at least two courses of intravesical BCG (at least 5 
of 6 induction doses of BCG and at least 2 of 3 maintenance doses of BCG under a 
maintenance regimen or at least 2 doses of a repeat induction course).  See exception below 
for persistent T1 disease below.  There is no upper limit on the amount of prior BCG a 
subject may have received.  
•Patients with persistent T1 high grade disease on TURBT following a single induction course 
of BCG (at least 5 of 6 doses) may also be eligible for this trial provided that the patient is 
surgically unfit for cystectomy as deemed by the investigator or the patient declines 
cystectomy
Design:
•This is a Phase I, open-label study of the combination of durvalumab and Vicineum in 
subjects with high-grade NMIBC previously treated with BCG.
•All subjects will receive Vicineum intravesically and durvalumab systemically at the 
standard doses for both drugs as determined by Phase II trials for each drug, as no synergy or 
additive effect is expected for adverse events. 
•Vicineum is administered in a 12-week Induction Phase followed by a Maintenance Phase 
for at least one year with an option for a total of up to 2 years of treatment. During the 
Induction Phase, Vicineum is administered once weekly for 12 weeks.  During the 
Maintenance Phase, Vicineum is administered every other week.  The dose of Vicineum is 30 
mg in 50 mL of saline.  
•Durvalumab 1500 mg is administered intravenously (IV) once every 4 weeks for 12 months 
with an option to continue therapy for an additional 12 months (total of 24 months) provided 
that patient is tolerating therapy and remains free of recurrent high grade NMIBC (see 
Treatment Period below).  The dose of durvalumab is 1500 mg.  If optional maintenance 
therapy continued in the second year, durvalumab 1500 mg will be administered 
intravenously once every 3 months to provide an immune boost.  
•Vicineum will be given as monotherapy for 1 week followed by treatment with the 
combination of Vicineum and durvalumab starting week 2.  
•In the initial six patients, three subjects at a time will enroll at these doses and schedules. 
Dose-liming toxicity (DLT) for each subject will be determined during the initial 6-week 
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC

4period that the subject is on treatment (i.e., the DLT period).  When all subjects in the initial 
cohort have been on treatment through the DLT period, all available safety data will be 
considered in decisions to enroll additional subjects at this dose level, or to de-escalate the 
dose(s) of study drug(s), based on a standard “3 + 3” design.  There will be no dose-
escalations in this study.  The dose of durvalumab will remain at 1500 mg every 4 weeks, 
and the dose of each intravesical Vicineum treatment can be reduced to 20 mg if the initial 
doses in combination induce DLTs.  
•After the first six patients, an additional 18 subjects will be enrolled at the initial doses or at 
the reduced doses (if DLTs resulted in the first 6 patients) in order to obtain additional safety 
data, biomarker data and preliminary anti-tumor activity.
•Each subject’s course will consist of the following periods:
oScreening/Baseline Period:  The subject is consented and undergoes screening 
assessments to determine eligibility for the study.
oTreatment Period:  The subject is treated and monitored for safety.  Biomarker data 
will be obtained prior to treatment and at periodic intervals during treatment. Subjects 
who remain free of high-grade NMIBC after 12 months of study treatment may 
continue to receive treatment for an additional 12 months until they develop recurrent 
high-grade disease, disease progression, or intolerable toxicity, or meet another 
withdrawal criterion (e.g., consent withdrawal, pregnancy). 
oPost-Treatment.  The subject will return to the study site monthly for up to 90 days 
after the last dose of immunotherapy for end-of-treatment assessments.  Subjects with 
ongoing clinically-significant related AEs or SAEs will have additional follow-up after 
the initial post-treatment visit.

1.2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
Bladder cancer is the 6th most common cancer in the United States, affecting more men than 
women. It is the 3rd most common cancer in men and the 11th most common in women. 
(Bladder cancer treatment (PDQ® 2015) Approximately 75% of bladder cancers are of the non-
muscle invasive type.8  Non-muscle invasive bladder cancers (NMIBCs) can be categorized as 
Ta (non-invasive papillary carcinoma), T1 (tumor invades lamina propria or subepithelial 
connective tissue), and Tis (carcinoma in situ). Ta tumors are the most common, representing 
about 70% of NMIBCs, but only about 7% of these are categorized as high-grade.9 About 20% 
of NMIBCs are T1 tumors.10 T1 tumors are more aggressive than Ta tumors, and considered 
high-risk.8 Flat, high-grade tumors confined to the mucosa (non-invasive) are characterized as 
carcinoma in situ (CIS),8 and these represent approximately 10% of the NMIBCs.10 
The usual first treatment for NMIBC (Ta, T1, and CIS) is transurethral resection of the bladder 
tumors (TURBT), followed by intravesical immunotherapy, most commonly with bacillus 
Calmette-Guérin (BCG).8 In patients with T1 tumors, a second TURBT is recommended.8 
Induction therapy with BCG is usually dosed as 6 once-weekly instillations.8 In patients with 
high-grade Ta, T1, and CIS, maintenance therapy with BCG of at least 1 year is 
recommended,8,10 although the optimal dose, dosing schedule, and duration of treatment are 
unknown. Local and systemic side effects are common with intravesical BCG therapy, causing 
discontinuation of treatment in approximately 20% of patients.11 Approximately 75% of patients 
experience local side effects (including cystitis, irritative voiding symptoms, and hematuria), 
while 40% report systemic side effects, including general malaise and fever.11 Intravesical BCG 
failure occurs in up to 40% of patients.11 In ~20-35% of cases that failed an initial induction 
course of BCG, a second course of induction BCG may be beneficial, but patients who fail two

16courses are often best served by radical cystectomy.3,12,13 Therefore, cystectomy is recommended 
for CIS and high-grade Ta and T1 patients who experience disease recurrence following 
intravesical therapy.8 However, Shabsigh et al. reported that 64% of patients who undergo 
cystectomy suffer at least one complication within the first 90 days after surgery14 and the 
operation has been reported to have at least a 2.5% perioperative mortality rate even at a high-
volume center.5  For patients unable or unwilling to undergo cystectomy, treatment options are 
limited.
High grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer tends to respond well to BCG and when it does 
not, there is evidence to suggest an incomplete or inefficient immune response.  Immune 
responses directed against tumors are one of the body’s natural defenses against the growth and 
proliferation of cancer cells. However, over time and under pressure from immune attack, 
cancers develop strategies to evade immune-mediated killing allowing them to develop 
unchecked. One such mechanism involves upregulation of surface proteins that deliver inhibitory 
signals to cytotoxic T cells.
Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is one such protein, and is upregulated in a broad range 
of cancers with a high frequency, with up to 88% expression in some tumor types. In a number 
of these cancers, including lung,15 renal,16-18 pancreatic,19-21 ovarian cancer,22 and hematologic 
malignancies,23,24 tumor cell expression of PD-L1 is associated with reduced survival and an 
unfavorable prognosis.  Programmed cell death ligand 1 is part of a complex system of receptors 
and ligands that are involved in controlling T-cell activation. PD-L1 acts at multiple sites in the 
body to help regulate normal immune responses and is utilized by tumors to help evade detection 
and elimination by the host immune system tumor response. In the lymph nodes, PD-L1 on 
antigen-presenting cells binds to PD-1 or CD80 on activated T cells and delivers an inhibitory 
signal to the T cell.25,26  This results in reduced T-cell activation and fewer activated T cells in 
circulation. In the tumor microenvironment, PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells binds to PD-1 and 
CD80 on activated T cells reaching the tumor. This delivers an inhibitory signal to those T cells, 
preventing them from killing target cancer cells and protecting the tumor from immune 
elimination.27  Therefore, targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 protein has emerged as an interesting 
strategy in bladder cancer especially given recent FDA approval of atezolizumab in the treatment 
of metastatic urothelial cancer.  Durvalumab, a novel PD-L1 inhibitor, has not been investigated 
in NMIBC but has demonstrated activity in metastatic urothelial cancer as well.  
 Limited agents have demonstrated response in the setting of BCG-refractory disease.  One such 
agent is Vicineum™.  Vicineum™ consists of a recombinant fusion protein, VB4-845, that 
contains a humanized single-chain antibody fragment specific for the epithelial cell adhesion 
molecule (EpCAM) antigen linked to ETA (252-608), a truncated form of Pseudomonas 
exotoxin A (ETA).  In 135 bladder cancer patients with CIS, TaG2-3, or T1G2-3 screened for 
trial enrollment for BCG-refractory disease, EpCAM staining was performed and revealed that 
132 (98%) patients had some EpCAM staining.  In fact, two of the 3 patients with negative 
staining, did not actually have tumor on the specimen analyzed.  Ninety-four percent of all 
tumors had 2+ or 3+ staining.  Therefore, EpCAM appears to be a good target in BCG-refractory 
bladder cancer.  In a previous phase II study in patients with high grade bladder cancer 
previously treated with BCG, the 3-month complete response rate was 40% and 16% of patients 
treated with induction and maintenance therapy with Vicineum™ remained disease-free at 1 
year.
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
17Given activity of Vicineum™ in such patients and activity of durvalumab in metastatic urothelial 
cancer, the combination of both drugs may be more effective than either drug alone.  PD-1/PD-
L1 checkpoint inhibitors do not directly induce anti-tumor immune responses.  Instead they 
function by taking the breaks off of existing T cell clones with a specificity for antigens 
expressed on the surface of tumor T cells.  Therefore, in order for checkpoint inhibitor therapy to 
be effective, the checkpoint inhibitors should be used in conjunction with agents that are capable 
of inducing a cellular anti-tumor immune response. It is generally accepted that a type of cell 
death known as immunogenic cell death (ICD) is associated with effective stimulation of these 
cellular host immune responses.  ICD can be identified by the presence of damage associated 
molecular patterns or DAMPS – these are characterized by distinct signals such as the release of 
ATP and HMGB1 (High Mobility Group Box 1) and cell surface translocation of calreticulin, an 
endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein.  Preclinical work demonstrates that Vicineum (VB4-
845) mediated killing of tumor cells results in the presence of these DAMPS, thereby suggesting 
that it could promote the desired anti-tumor cellular immune responses.  Additionally, as bladder 
cancer is one of the cancers associated with higher levels of somatic mutations, it follows that 
targeted killing of EpCAM positive cancer cells should present these antigens to the immune 
system, thereby providing targets for the cellular immune response.  Therefore, use of both 
agents may lead to synergistic killing of tumors. 
Based on the thoughts of synergy, an in vivo study was performed with a drug called Proxinium, 
an earlier version of Vicineum™, demonstrating an abscopal effect and synergy with the use of a 
checkpoint blockade inhibitor.  Although it was done in a NSCLC model, the results were 
impressive in causing tumor shrinkage.  In this experiment, a humanized mouse model was used 
with an engrafted immune system (myeloablated and engrafted with human bone marrow stem 
cells) and a human EpCAM-expressing NSCLC PDX tumor placed in the flanks bilaterally.  The 
mice had circulating human T cells and B cells.  Four treatment groups were used.  In group 1, 
vehicle alone was given to serve as a control group.  Group 2 was treated with direct injection of 
VB4-845 (Proxinium/Vicineum) unilaterally into only one of the flank-bearing tumors.  Group 3 
was treated with PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor alone (nivolumab) and finally group 4 was treated 
with the combination of VB4-845 and the PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor.  The left graph shows the 
tumor size of the injected tumor in the four groups while the right graph shows the tumor size of 
the uninjected tumor in the four groups.  As can be seen in the left graph, intratumoral treatment 
of the EpCAM positive subcutaneous PDX tumor with VB4-845 led to cessation of tumor

18growth. PD-1 inhibitor by itself or in combination with VB4-845 was not that effective in 
reducing the size of the injected tumor.  However, intratumoral treatment of the EpCAM positive 
subcutaneous PDX tumor with VB4-845 increased the ability of a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor to 
decrease the growth rate of an uninjected contralateral PDX tumor as compared to treatment with 
the checkpoint inhibitor alone as shown on the right graph.  The small number of animals per 
cohort and the use of a rapidly growing PDX model decreased the impact of the combination but 
interestingly the flattening of the growth rate of the uninjected tumors in the combination group 
was not observed until a sufficient period of time passed to allow for the induction of a cellular 
immune response.  The preclinical study was performed with Vicineum in combination with a 
PD-1 inhibitor targeting the receptor, rather than durvalumab which is a PD-L1 inhibitor that 
targets the ligand of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction.  However, there is no reason to believe that 
durvalumab would act differently.  It would be difficult to truly predict the safety of the 
combination of the two drugs in a preclinical model as neither antibody cross reacts with mouse 
homologues.  Therefore, this trial is evaluating the safety and tolerability of the combination of 
Vicineum and durvalumab in BCG-refractory NMIBC.  A secondary endpoint would be 12-
month recurrence-free survival (RFS) with the combination.  Historical data suggests that the 12-
month recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate is approximately 20-35% for patients who failed one 
previous induction course of BCG and are treated again with BCG alone.  
1.2.1 Durvalumab Background
Durvalumab is being developed as a potential anticancer therapy for patients with advanced solid 
tumors. Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody (MAb) of the immunoglobulin G1 kappa 
(IgG1κ) subclass that inhibits binding of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) (B7 homolog 
1 [B7-H1], cluster of differentiation [CD]274) to programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; CD279) and 
CD80 (B7-1). Durvalumab is composed of 2 identical heavy chains and 2 identical light chains, 
with an overall molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa. Durvalumab contains a triple 
mutation in the constant domain of the immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 heavy chain that reduces binding 
to complement protein C1q and the fragment crystallizable gamma (Fcγ) receptors involved in 
triggering effector function.    
1.2.1.1 Summary of non-clinical experience
The non-clinical experience is fully described in the current version of the durvalumab 
Investigator’s Brochure.   
Durvalumab binds with high affinity and specificity to human PD-L1 and blocks its interaction 
with PD-1 and CD80. In vitro studies demonstrate that durvalumab antagonizes the inhibitory 
effect of PD-L1 on primary human T cells, resulting in their restored proliferation and release of 
interferon gamma (IFN-γ). Additionally, durvalumab demonstrated a lack of antibody-dependent 
cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) in cell-based 
functional assays. In vivo studies show that durvalumab inhibits tumor growth in a xenograft 
model using pancreatic and melanoma human cancer cell lines via a T lymphocyte (T-cell) 
dependent mechanism. Moreover, an anti-mouse PD-L1 antibody demonstrated improved 
survival in a syngeneic tumor model when given as monotherapy and resulted in complete tumor 
regression in > 50% of treated mice when given in combination with chemotherapy. 
Combination therapy (dual targeting of PD-L1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 
[CTLA-4]) resulted in tumor regression in a mouse model of colorectal cancer.

191.2.1.2 Summary of clinical experience
Clinical experience with durvalumab is fully described in the current version of the durvalumab 
Investigator’s Brochure.
As of the DCO date (12 July 2016), across the entire clinical development program, an estimated 
5225 patients have been exposed to 1 or more doses of durvalumab in AstraZeneca- or 
MedImmune-sponsored studies, either as monotherapy or in combination, including 2878 
patients in open label trials, and 2347 patients as an estimate based on the random scheme in 
studies where the treatment arm is blinded. Additionally, more than 1700 patients have been 
exposed to 1 or more doses of durvalumab in ESR/IITs.  Of the 2878 patients exposed to 
durvalumab in ongoing AstraZeneca- or MedImmune-sponsored open label studies, 1744 
patients received durvalumab monotherapy, 808 patients received durvalumab in combination 
with tremelimumab, 140 patients received durvalumab in combination with other investigational 
products and 186 patients received durvalumab in combination with approved products. No 
studies have been completed and no study has terminated prematurely due to toxicity. For a 
summary of the different studies including study design, dosing regimen, study populations and 
exposure, please see IB.
Pharmacokinetics and Product Metabolism 
Study CD-ON-durvalumab-1108: 
As of 24 July 2016, PK data were available for 977 patients who have been treated with 
durvalumab 0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W or 15 mg/kg Q3W (dose escalation), 10 mg/kg Q2W (dose 
expansion), and 20 mg/kg Q4W (dose-exploration) durvalumab administered as an iv infusion 
over 60 minutes. Following the first iv dose, durvalumab exhibited nonlinear PK at doses <3 
mg/kg Q2W likely due to saturable target-mediated CL and exhibited linear PK at doses ≥3 
mg/kg Q2W. The AUC 0-14 increased dose-proportionally at doses of 3 to 20 mg/kg and more 
than dose proportionally at doses of <3 mg/kg, likely due to saturable target-mediated CL. Cmax 
increased in a dose proportional manner within the dose range examined. The steady state was 
achieved at approximately Week 16. Accumulation of durvalumab was observed following 
repeated dosing.
As of 24 July 2016, a total of 790 patients provided samples for ADA analysis. Only 25 of 790 
patients (1 patient each in 0.1 and 3 mg/kg cohorts, 17 patients from 10 mg/kg cohort) were 
ADA positive. Based on population PK covariate analysis, ADA positive status was not 
associated with a clinically relevant reduction of exposure to durvalumab. At the 10 mg/kg Q2W 
dose, sPD-L1 suppression in ADA positive patients was similar to that observed in ADA 
negative patients. The relevance of ADA on safety and efficacy is unknown given the small 
number of ADA positive patients.
Safety 
The safety profile of durvalumab as monotherapy and combined with other anticancer agents 
was consistent with the pharmacology of the target and other agents in the immune checkpoint 
inhibitor class. No tumor types appeared to be associated with unique AEs. Immune-related AEs 
(irAEs), which are important risks of immune checkpoint inhibitors, have been observed with 
durvalumab and include colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis/hepatotoxicity, neuropathy/neuromuscular 
toxicity, endocrinopathy, dermatitis, and nephritis. In addition, pancreatitis is an important

events are manageable by available/established treatment guidelines as described in the study 
protocols.

Efficacy 
Study CD-ON-durvalumab-1108: 
Urothelial carcinoma 
A phase 1/2 multicenter, open-label study conducted in patients with inoperable or metastatic 
solid tumors, reported the results a urothelial carcinoma expansion cohort.28  Durvalumab (10 
mg/kg every 2 weeks) was administered intravenously for up to 12 months. The primary end-
point was safety, and objective response rate (ORR, confirmed) was a key secondary end point.  
A total of 61 patients (40 PD-L1–positive, 21 PD-L1–negative), 93.4% of whom received one or 
more prior therapies for advanced disease, were treated (median duration of follow-up, 4.3 
months). The most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) of any grade were fatigue 
(13.1%), diarrhea (9.8%), and decreased appetite (8.2%). Grade 3 treatment-related AEs 
occurred in three patients (4.9%); there were no treatment-related grade 4 or 5 AEs. One 
treatment-related AE (acute kidney injury) resulted in treatment discontinuation. The ORR was 
31.0% (95% CI, 17.6 to 47.1) in 42 response-evaluable patients, 46.4% (95% CI, 27.5 to 66.1) in 
the PD-L1–positive subgroup, and 0% (95% CI, 0.0 to 23.2) in the PD-L1–negative subgroup.

22Responses are ongoing in 12 of 13 responding patients, with median duration of response not yet 
reached (range, 4.1+ to 49.3+ weeks). 
1.2.2 Vicineum Background 
Vicineum™ (Vicineum) contains the active pharmaceutical ingredient VB4-845, which is a 
recombinant fusion protein produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli) that expresses a humanized 
single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) specific for the epithelial cell adhesion molecule 
(EpCAM) antigen linked to ETA(252-608). ETA(252-608), which is a truncated form of 
Pseudomonas exotoxin A (ETA) that lacks the cell binding domain, is a single polypeptide 
fusion protein produced by continuous translation of a single construct.  
The mechanism of action is dependent upon the 2 components of Vicineum. Once bound to the 
EpCAM antigen on the surface of carcinoma cells, Vicineum is internalized through an 
endocytic pathway. Furin contained within the endosomal compartment cleaves a proteolytic site 
on the surface of ETA(252-608), releasing ETA(252-608). The ETA(252-608) induces cell death 
by irreversibly blocking protein synthesis through adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation of 
a post-translationally modified histidine residue of elongation factor-2 (EF-2), called 
diphthamide. (Oppenheimer 1981) The truncated version of ETA, ETA(252-608), has been 
engineered to retain the active domains necessary to induce cell death, but the cell binding 
domain has been eliminated thereby preventing the ETA(252-608) moiety from entering the cell 
in the absence of some alternate vehicle, such as via antibody-mediated internalization. Binding 
to EpCAM must occur to result in ETA(252-608)-mediated effects.
The ETA(252-608) component of the Vicineum fusion protein can cause an immunogenic 
response when administered systemically to humans. Therefore, Vicineum is being developed as 
a locally targeted therapeutic in order to limit its systemic exposure and to maximize the 
concentration of the drug in its target cells. By administering Vicineum via intravesical 
instillation, the probability of systemic exposure and subsequent generation of neutralizing 
antibodies is decreased. Furthermore, the high local concentrations of Vicineum maximize the 
likelihood of achieving a therapeutic benefit.
Clinical experience with Vicineum is fully described in the current version of the Vicineum 
Investigator’s Brochure (Version 8.0).  
1.2.2.1 Preclinical Studies
Preclinical study data have shown that Vicineum exhibits potent activity [inhibitory 
concentration 50% (IC50) = 0.001 - 10 pM] against numerous EpCAM-positive cell lines, with 
selectivity for EpCAM-expressing tumors. In vivo pharmacology demonstrated that Vicineum 
effectively inhibits tumor growth in several human xenograft animal models. Studies in rats 
found that the toxicological effects of Vicineum occur at doses 1,000-fold greater than the IC50 
for activity on tumor cells, with a safety margin of at least 5- to 100-fold. 
1.2.2.2 Clinical Studies
VB4-845-02-I
A Phase 1 trial (VB4-845-02-I) of Vicineum evaluated doses up to 30.16 mg administered 
intravesically to 64 subjects with Grade 2 or 3, stage Ta or T1 transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) 
or CIS, either refractory to or intolerant of BCG therapy.29 No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) 
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC

23were observed. Vicineum was well tolerated, and the majority of adverse events (AEs) were 
mild. The most frequently reported treatment-related AEs were renal and urinary disorders, with 
dysuria (14.1%) and hematuria (10.9%) most commonly reported. Of the systemic AEs, fatigue 
was reported by 7.8% of subjects, while fever/chills and loss of appetite were each reported by 
6.2% of subjects. The frequency of treatment-related AEs did not increase with increasing doses 
of Vicineum. There was 1 serious adverse event reported (death due to cardiac failure), which 
occurred 3 weeks after stopping study drug; the Investigator assessed the event to be unrelated to 
Vicineum treatment, attributing it to the subject’s long-standing history of cardiovascular 
disease. Exploratory efficacy assessment at 3 months showed that of 61 evaluable subjects, a 
complete response (defined as non-positive urinary cytology and either normal cystoscopy or 
abnormal cystoscopy with negative biopsy) was achieved by 24 subjects (39%). Of the 17 
subjects with Tis, 29% achieved a complete response, while complete responses were observed 
in 44% and 43% of the subjects with T1 and Ta, respectively. 
Blood samples for assessing humoral immune reactivity to Vicineum were taken prior to dosing 
on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and at the final study visit. Antibody titers to the scFv and ETA252–
608 portions of the fusion protein (human antihuman antibodies (HAHA) and human anti-
Pseudomonas antibodies (HAPA)) were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay. HAPA response was more vigorous, as patients developed a measurable titer earlier; the 
majority of patients exhibited HAPA by day 29, with 77% (47/61) having a measurable titer at 
final visit. In contrast, only 16% (10/61) of patients had HAHA by the end of the study. HAPA 
titers were also generally higher, with a mean maximum titer of 20,512 versus 3373 for HAHA 
responses. A comparison of mean titers of the HAPA and HAHA responses measured in samples 
taken on the final visit showed no significant difference between responders and nonresponders.
VB4-845-02-IIA
A Phase 2 study (VB4-845-02-IIA) evaluated once-weekly instillations of Vicineum 30 mg in 
two different induction schedules:  weekly x 6 weeks or weekly x 12 weeks, followed by up to 3 
maintenance cycles (3 once-weekly instillations followed by a 9-week drug-free period) in 46 
subjects with histologically-confirmed TCC of the bladder and residual CIS with or without 
concurrent Ta or T1 who were refractory or intolerant to BCG.30 Some subjects in the 6-weekly 
induction arm received a second induction cycle.  Forty-six subjects were considered evaluable 
for response.  A complete response (defined as no histological evidence of disease and negative 
urine cytology at the 3-monthly evaluations) was achieved by 44% (20/45) of subjects, and 16% 
(7/45) of subjects remained disease-free at the 1-year end-of-study (EOS) assessment. A post-
study assessment found that these subjects were still disease-free at 18-25 months. The median 
time to recurrence was 134 days longer in subjects who received 12 weeks of induction therapy 
compared to 6 weeks (408 vs 274 days, respectively; log rank test p=0.1708). The most 
frequently reported treatment-related AEs were renal and urinary disorders, including 50% with 
dysuria (61% of these were of mild intensity) and 13% with hematuria. Overall, most AEs were 
of mild severity. There were 3 severe events, all of which resolved without sequelae. No subject 
discontinued from the study due to AEs and there were no deaths or other serious AEs. 
Based on the preliminary positive therapeutic results and favorable tolerability profile, the 
present Phase 3 trial will evaluate the efficacy of Vicineum induction therapy administered for 
12 weeks, and the long-term effectiveness of Vicineum maintenance therapy (up to 24 months 
treatment in total) in preventing disease recurrence.

24VB4-845-02-IIIA
An open-label, single–arm Phase 3 trial of Vicineum (VB4-845-02-IIIA) is evaluating Vicineum 
in subjects who have received a least 2 courses of BCG and whose disease is considered BCG-
unresponsive.  One hundred thirty-three subjects will enroll of whom 77 will have CIS with 
relapsed/refractory disease within 6 months of their last dose of BCG.
Based on data in the database as of 03 October 2016, the most frequent adverse events regardless 
of causality were UTIs, dysuria, hematuria, fatigue, micturition, urgency, pollakiuria, diarrhea, 
and arthralgia.
Two subjects were reported to have suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs).  
A 90 year-old patient with an elevated lipase developed acute renal failure and LFT elevations.  
The patient required dialysis.  Cholestatic hepatitis progressed. The investigator judged these 
events as possibly related to study treatment.  After a few weeks of dialysis, the patient elected to 
stop further dialysis and go to hospice care.  After stopping dialysis, the patient passed away.
A 74-year-old patient also developed acute kidney injury with LFT elevations.  The LFT 
elevations resolved quickly upon stopping Vicineum treatment.  The kidney function improved 
with hospitalization and intravenous fluids.

Efficacy
Vicineum demonstrated efficacy in CR rate at 3 months with sustained CR and duration of 
response, as well as CR rate at 6, 9, and 12 months, cystectomy free days, event-free survival, 
progression-free survival, overall survival, recurrence-free rates in papillary disease subjects, and 
time to disease recurrence in papillary disease subjects, for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive 
subjects who are resistant to currently available therapy. Subjects that responded to Vicineum 
(CIS subjects with CR and papillary subjects who were recurrence-free at 3 months) were 5 
times more likely to remain cystectomy-free at 2 years than those who did not respond.
The CR rate at 3 months was 39% and 40% for the primary efficacy population (mITT) and all 
evaluable CIS subjects, respectively. Of those mITT subjects with a CR at post-induction phase 
(3 months), 69%, 53%, and 42% continued to have a complete response at 6, 9, and 12 months, 
respectively. All CIS subjects with fewer BCG cycles had a higher CR rate than those CIS 
subjects treated with more courses of BCG.
1.2.3 US FDA withdrawal of metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma (mUC) indication for 
Imfinzi (durvalumab) granted under the accelerated approval pathway
On 5/1/17, the FDA had granted accelerated approval to durvalumab for the treatment of locally 
advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma with disease progression after failing platinum-
based chemotherapy or disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant 
treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy.
As of February 2021, AstraZeneca has voluntarily withdrawn the indication for Imfinzi 
(durvalumab) in the US for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
urothelial carcinoma who:
– Have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
25– Have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with 
platinum-containing chemotherapy.
This decision was made in consultation with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based 
on their broad evaluation of accelerated approvals. The voluntary withdrawal was for lack of 
efficacy and not for safety concerns.
The urothelial carcinoma indication was granted Accelerated Approval from the US FDA, based 
on tumor response rate and duration of response from Study 1108 and the significant unmet 
needs of patients.2 Accelerated approval is a specific regulatory path whereby confirmatory data 
is required to convert an accelerated approval to full approval. In this case, continued approval 
for this indication in the US was contingent upon positive results from the Phase III DANUBE 
trial of Imfinzi or Imfinzi plus tremelimumab versus chemotherapy as first-line therapy for 
patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. The DANUBE 
trial did not meet either of its co-primary endpoints of improving overall survival versus standard 
of care chemotherapy for Imfinzi monotherapy in patients whose tumor cells and/or tumor-
infiltrating immune cells express high levels (≥25%) of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) 
or for Imfinzi plus tremelimumab in patients regardless of their PD-L1 expression.
We would like to continue the drug-combination trial since our preliminary interim data analysis 
shows a 40% 12 week response rate (5/12 patients) with half of them showing a >12 month 
sustained response. We hypothesize that the prolonged response might be related to the systemic 
therapy (Durvalumab) administration. Also, most of the treatment related AEs are irritative 
voiding symptoms and most of them are grade 3 or lower, suggesting that the treatment is 
tolerated well thus far.Combination Therapy Dose Justification
In the single-agent phase I Vicineum study, there were no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and no 
MTD was determined.  Only 2 subjects of 64 had detectable plasma Vicineum levels and these 
were very near the lower level of quantitation.  Durvalumab has been extensively studied in 
Phase I and Phase II and the recommended dose and safety profile has been established.  For 
these reasons, the initial dose level for the combination will be the standard doses for both drugs.  
The FDA approved dose for durvalumab is currently 10mg/kg every 2 weeks and this amounts to 
750 mg every 2 weeks for an average 75 kg individual.  Based on pre-clinical data, there is no 
difference in exposure between weight based Q2W dosing and fixed dose Q4W dosing.  
Therefore, we are administering 1500 mg every 4 weeks instead of 750 mg every 2 weeks for 
ease and dosing convenience.  
2 ELIGIBILITY ASSESSMENT AND ENROLLMENT 
2.1 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
2.1.1 Inclusion Criteria

Pathology as high grade non-muscle invasive urothelial (transitional cell carcinoma) of 
the bladder as follows: 
•Carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) with or without papillary tumors
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
26•High-grade Ta or T1 disease based on a biopsy/TURBT performed within 12 weeks 
of the initial dose of study treatment.  If multiple bladder biopsies/TURBTs are 
required to confirm eligibility, the timing of the last bladder biopsy to the initial dose 
of study treatment must be within 12 weeks.
•Patients with persistent T1 high grade disease on TURBT following a single 
induction course of BCG (at least 5 of 6 doses) may also be eligible for this trial 
provided that the patient is surgically unfit for cystectomy as deemed by the 
investigator or the patient declines cystectomy.
2.1.1.2 Subjects with BCG unresponsive disease as defined by the Society of Urologic 
Oncology and the FDA6,7:  Subjects must have received at least two courses of 
intravesical BCG (at least 5 of 6 induction doses of BCG and at least 2 of 3 
maintenance doses of BCG under a maintenance regimen or at least 2 doses of a repeat 
induction course).  Please note exception above for persistent T1 disease.  There is no 
upper limit on the amount of prior BCG a subject may have received.

302.1.3 Recruitment Strategies
This study will be posted on NIH websites and on NIH social media forums. Additionally, this 
study will be listed on available websites (www.clinicaltrials.gov and others) and participants 
will be recruited from the current patient population at NIH.
2.2 SCREENING EVALUATION 
Note: Screening evaluation testing/procedures are conducted under the separate screening 
protocol, 01-C-0129 (Eligibility Screening and Tissue Procurement for the NIH Intramural 
Research Program Clinical Protocols). Assessments performed at outside facilities or on another 
NIH protocol within the timeframes below may also be used to determine eligibility once a 
participant has signed the consent.
Evaluations to be performed within 12 weeks prior to starting treatment: 
•History and physical examination (including medications, medical history, surgical 
history, previous treatments for bladder cancer with dates, allergies, and demography)
•ECOG performance status 
•Formal review of available previous bladder tumor specimens by the Laboratory of 
Pathology, NCI, to confirm the bladder cancer diagnosis prior to enrollment into the 
study. 
oIf outside bladder tumor specimens are inadequate to accurately stage the 
patient’s disease, then additional biopsies will be performed at the NCI as part of 
standard of care therapy.  Tissues obtained at the NCI will be used to confirm 
diagnosis and for study of immune-related markers.  With preoperative patient 
permission, extra tissue not sent to Laboratory of Pathology, NCI, will be frozen 
for future analysis of immune-related markers and tumor infiltrates.  This 
additional harvested tissue will be used for research purposes only and is not 
required for a candidate to participate in this protocol. 
oIf outside bladder tumor specimens are adequate to accurately stage the patient’s 
disease, cystoscopy with or without biopsy and/or TURBT to confirm diagnosis 
and resect and remove any residual papillary disease and fulgurate any CIS may 
be performed as part of standard of care therapy.  With preoperative patient 
permission, extra tissue not sent to the Laboratory of Pathology, NCI, will be 
frozen for the future analysis of immune-related markers and tumor infiltrates.  
This additional harvested tissue will be used for research purposes only and is not 
required for a candidate to participate in this protocol.Blue light cystoscopy can 
be performed at urologist’s discretion.
•Laboratory studies
oHematology (Complete blood count plus differential and platelet count)
oSerum chemistries and liver function tests (Na+, K+, Cl-, CO2, glucose, BUN, 
creatinine, albumin, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, 
ALT, AST, total bilirubin, LDH, pre-albumin, amylase, lipase
oCoagulation parameters (PT, PTT)

31oViral Studies (Hepatitis B and C; HIV)
oThyroid function tests 
•Urinalysis
•24 hour urine (only if CrCL will not be calculated)
•PPD if indicated
•Computerized Tomography (CT) urogram or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 
urogram.  If urogram protocol not available or contrast allergy/poor renal function 
preclude such imaging, then CT or MRI of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast will 
suffice and investigator may perform retrograde pyelogram at their discretion. 
•Electrocardiogram (ECG) for QT interval – Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate 
using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) will be calculated from a single ECG.  If QTcF ≥ 
470ms, then the patient must be excluded from trial.
oResting 12-lead ECGs will be recorded according to the assessment schedule. 
ECGs should be obtained after the patient has been in a supine position for 5 
minutes and should be recorded while the patient remains in that position.
oECG will be recorded at Screening, in Week 2 (pre-durvalumab treatment) and as 
clinically indicated.
oIn case of clinically significant ECG abnormalities, including a QTcF value >470 
ms, 2 additional 12-lead ECGs should be obtained over a brief period (e.g., 30 
minutes and at least 5 minutes apart) to confirm prolongation

3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION
This is a single arm study.  A run in cohort of up to 12 evaluable subjects and an expansion 
cohort of up to 24 evaluable will be evaluated. No randomization of stratification will be 
performed.
3.1 STUDY DESIGN
See SCHEMA.
3.1.1 Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)
A DLT will be defined as any Grade 3 or higher toxicity that occurs during the initial 6-week 
period the subject is on treatment (i.e., the DLT evaluation period). Toxicity that is clearly and 
directly related to the primary disease or to another etiology is excluded from this definition.  
Since this trial also involves immunotherapy, immune-related AEs (irAEs) are defined as AEs of 
an immune nature (i.e. inflammatory) in the absence of a clear alternative etiology.  In the 
absence of a clinically significant abnormality, repeat laboratory testing will be conducted to 
confirm significant laboratory findings prior to designation as a DLT.  The following will be 
DLTs:
•Inability to reduce prednisone dose below 10 mg within 6 weeks (rather than 12 weeks) 
due to ongoing immune-related adverse reaction of Grade >1
•Any Grade 4 irAE not attributed to local tumor response (e.g., inflammatory reaction 
attributed to local tumor response or inflammatory reaction at sites of metastatic disease 
or lymph nodes)
•Any ≥ Grade 3 colitis
•Any Grade encephalopathy
•Any ≥ Grade 3 neurotoxicity
•Any ≥ Grade 3 peripheral neuromotor syndromes
•Any Grade 2 or higher noninfectious pneumonitis irrespective of duration
•Any Grade 3 irAE, excluding colitis that does not downgrade to Grade 2 within 3 days 
after onset of the event despite optimal medical management including systemic 
corticosteroids or does not downgrade to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline within 14 days
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
34•Total bilirubin >1.5 - 3.0 x ULN (Grade 2 Hyperbilirubinemia)
•ALT or AST >8x ULN
•ALT or AST >5x ULN for more than 2 weeks
•ALT or AST >3x ULN and 
•ALT or AST >3x ULN and INR >1.5
•ALT or AST >3x ULN with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%)
•Any Grade ≥3 non-irAE toxicity that does not downgrade to Grade ≤1 or baseline status 
(for patients who entered the study with an existing laboratory abnormality) within 14 
days 
•Inability to receive ≥ 75% or more of scheduled study treatment (both Vicineum and 
durvalumab) during the first six weeks of the trial
•Persistent Grade 2 events possibly related to study drugs such as persistent nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, or fatigue that are refractory to maximal intervention or are severely 
limiting to the patient’s ability to carry out activities of daily living.
The definition excludes the following conditions: 
•Grade 3 endocrine disorder (thyroid, pituitary, and/or adrenal insufficiency) that is 
managed with or without systemic corticosteroid therapy and/or hormone replacement 
therapy and the subject is asymptomatic
•Concurrent vitiligo or alopecia of any AE grade
•Grade 3 infusion-related reaction (first occurrence and in the absence of steroid 
prophylaxis) that resolves within 6 hours with appropriate clinical management
•Isolated Grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities that are not associated with clinical signs or 
symptoms and are reversed with appropriate maximal medical intervention within 3 days.
•Grade 3 inflammatory reaction attributed to a local antitumor response (e.g., 
inflammatory reaction at sites of metastatic disease, lymph nodes, etc.)
3.1.2 Dose De-Escalation / Cohort Expansion
•This trial will begin with a fixed dose of Vicineum 30 mg intravesical (Dose Level 1) 
administered once weekly for the first 12 weeks. Durvalumab administration will begin after 1  
week of Vicineum monotherapy, at 1500mg IV once every 4 weeks. 
•In the initial six patients, three subjects at a time will enroll at these doses and schedules (Dose 
Level 1). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) for each subject will be determined during the initial 6-
week period that the subject is on treatment (i.e., the DLT period).  When all subjects in the 
initial cohort have been on treatment through the DLT period, all available safety data will be 
considered in the decision to enroll additional subjects at this dose level, or to de-escalate the 
doses of the study drugs to Dose Level -1, based on a standard “3 + 3” design (see table below).  
There will be no dose-escalations in this study.  
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
35•After the first six to twelve patients, an additional 18 subjects will be enrolled at the highest dose 
level at which fewer than 2 of 6 subjects experienced DLT in order to obtain additional safety 
data and preliminary anti-tumor activity. Treatment at this level will continue as long as the 
cumulative fraction of patients experiencing DLT is < 1/3.
Dose De-Escalation Schedule
Dose Level Dose of IND Agent
Level 1•Durvalumab 1500mg IV every 4 weeks
•Vicineum 30 mg intravesically per dose*
Level -1•Durvalumab 1500mg IV every 4 weeks
•Vicineum 20 mg intravesically per dose*
* Vicineum administered weekly during the first 12 weeks of the study, then 
every 2 weeks thereafter.
Dose de-escalation will follow the rules outlined in the Table below.
If 2 or more DLTs occur at dose level -1, then accrual to the trial will end pending an amendment 
to consider other dosing options to explore for safety before proceeding to explore efficacy.

3.2 DRUG A DMINISTRATION
In this trial, patients will receive both drugs in certain weeks as specified in the schema.  The 
order of administration will be determined by drug delivery by pharmacy to the day hospital on 
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
36the day of administration.  Therefore, patients can receive either both drugs concurrently or 
sequentially without a particular order.
3.2.1 Durvalumab
3.2.1.1 Durvalumab doses and treatment regimens
The initial dose of durvalumab (Cohort 1) is 1500 mg IV every 4 weeks for up to 52 weeks. 
Please note, at the end of each maintenance cycle there is a 2 week window in order to allow the 
patients sufficient time to recover from biopsies prior to continuing treatment. Refer to the 
schema for a detailed description of Durvalumab administration weeks. 
Study treatment should be discontinued prior to 12 months if there is confirmed PD, initiation of 
alternative cancer therapy, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or if other reasons to 
discontinue study treatment occur.  
Subjects who have a dose interruption due to toxicity at any point in the first 12 months of 
treatment may resume treatment and complete the 12-month treatment period.  For patients 
without recurrent high grade disease and who are tolerating therapy well, optional maintenance 
therapy may be continued in the second year.  The maintenance dose will be durvalumab 1500 
mg administered intravenously once every 3 months to provide an immune boost.  During that 
second year, as per standard of care for high grade disease, cystoscopy and urine cytology will be 
performed every 3 months. This is depicted graphically in the schema in the optional 
maintenance section. 
No incompatibilities between durvalumab and polyvinylchloride or polyolefin IV bags have been 
observed. Dose of 1500mg durvalumab (for patients >30 kg in weight) will be administered 
using an IV bag containing 0.9% (w/v) saline or 5% (w/v) dextrose, with a final durvalumab 
(MEDI4736) concentration ranging from 1 to 20 mg/mL, and delivered through an IV 
administration set with a 0.2- or 0.22-μm in-line filter. 
Add 30.0 mL of durvalumab (MEDI4736) (ie. 1500 mg of durvalumab (MEDI4736)) to the IV 
bag.  The IV bag size should be selected such that the final concentration is within 1 to 20 
mg/mL.  Mix the bag by gently inverting to ensure homogeneity of the dose in the bag.
For patients who lose weight (<30 kg) during the course of the trial and maintain their enrollment 
ECOG status, further treatment with durvalumab will be weight based.   The dose volume of 
durvalumab and number of vials needed for the subject to achieve the accurate dose will be 
calculated according to Appendix B.
Durvalumab will be administered at room temperature (approximately 25°C) by controlled 
infusion via an infusion pump into a peripheral or central vein. Following preparation of 
durvalumab, the entire contents of the IV bag should be administered as an IV infusion over 
approximately 60 minutes (±5 minutes), using a 0.2, or 0.22-μm in-line filter. Less than 55 
minutes is considered a deviation.
The IV line will be flushed with a volume of IV solution (0.9% [w/v] saline) equal to the priming 
volume of the infusion set used after the contents of the IV bag are fully administered, or 
complete the infusion according to institutional policy to ensure the full dose is administered and 
document if the line was not flushed.
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
37Standard infusion time is 1 hour.  However, if there are interruptions during infusion, the total 
allowed time should not exceed 4 hours at room temperature.  The table below summarizes time 
allowances and temperatures.
Durvalumab hold and infusion times
Maximum time from needle puncture to 
start of administration4 hours at room temperature, 24 hours at 2°C to 
8°C
Maximum time for IV bag infusion, 
including interruptions8 hours at room temperature
In the event that either preparation time or infusion time exceeds the time limits outlined in the 
table above, a new dose must be prepared from new vials.  Durvalumab does not contain 
preservatives, and any unused portion must be discarded.
3.2.1.2 Monitoring of dose administration
Subjects will be monitored before, during and after the infusion with assessment of vital signs at 
the times specified in the Schedule of Assessment. Subjects are monitored (pulse rate, blood 
pressure) every 30 minutes during the infusion period (including times where infusion rate is 
slowed or temporarily stopped).
In the event of a ≤Grade 2 infusion-related reaction, the infusion rate of study drug may be 
decreased by 50% or interrupted until resolution of the event (up to 4 hours) and re-initiated at 
50% of the initial rate until completion of the infusion.  For subjects with a ≤Grade  2 
infusion-related reaction, subsequent infusions may be administered at 50% of the initial 
rate.  Acetaminophen and/or an antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine) or equivalent medications 
per institutional standard may be administered at the discretion of the investigator.  If the 
infusion-related reaction is Grade 3 or higher in severity, study drug will be discontinued. The 
standard infusion time is one hour, however if there are interruptions during infusion, the total 
allowed time from infusion start to completion of infusion should not exceed 4 hours at room 
temperature, with maximum total time at room temperature not exceeding 4 hours (otherwise 
requires new infusion preparation).  
As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible.  Appropriate drugs 
and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available, and 
study personnel must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis.  The study site must have 
immediate access to emergency resuscitation teams and equipment in addition to the ability to 
admit subjects to an intensive care unit if necessary.
3.2.2 VicineumTM 
3.2.2.1 Doses And Treatment Regimens
The initial dose of vicineum is 30 mg in 50 mL of saline (Dose level 1).  Vicineum will be 
instilled through a catheter into the bladder. Subjects will be instructed to hold study drug in the 
bladder for 2 hours, and asked to refrain from fluid intake to reduce urine flow during this 
period. After complete administration of the Vicineum dose, the catheter may be clamped and 
remain in for the 2-hour dwell time, or may be removed, per the discretion of the investigator.  
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
38Subjects will be encouraged, when physically possible, to be upright (sitting or standing), prone, 
supine, and in the left and right lateral decubitus positions, for at least 15 minutes each, in any 
order. If physically unable, this should be recorded in the CRF. At the end of 2-hour period, the 
catheter will be unclamped and the bladder will be drained (if the catheter remained in place) or 
the subject will void to empty the bladder.
Study Phase Treatment Regimen
Induction Phase (Weeks 1-12)One intravesical dose of Vicineum in 50 mL of saline instilled 
once weekly for a total of 12 weeks. 
Maintenance Phase (up to 
Week 104)One intravesical dose of Vicineum 50 mL saline instilled once 
every other week for 12 months from the start of the Induction 
phase.  Please note, at the end of each maintenance cycle there 
is a 2 week window in order to allow the patients sufficient 
time to recover from biopsies prior to continuing treatment. 
Refer to the schema for a detailed description of Vicineum 
administration weeks. If remain disease-free, therapy can be 
continued for up to 24 months (Week 104) from the start of 
the Induction Phase.  
3.3 DOSE MODIFICATIONS
3.3.1 Durvalumab
Following any biopsy or TURBT, study drug must be interrupted for a maximum of 2 weeks 
before restarting Durvalumab treatment.  
For adverse events (AEs) that are considered at least partly due to administration of durvalumab 
outside of the DLT evaluation period, the following dose adjustment guidance may be applied:
•Treat each of the toxicities with maximum supportive care (including holding the agent 
suspected of causing the toxicity where required).
•If the symptoms promptly resolve with supportive care, consideration should be given to 
resuming the same dose of durvalumab along with appropriate continuing supportive 
care.
•If medically appropriate, dose modifications are permitted for durvalumab. All dose 
modifications should be documented with clear reasoning and documentation of the 
approach taken (see Appendix C ).
In addition, there are certain circumstances in which durvalumab should be permanently 
discontinued (see Appendix C). In circumstances where subjects cannot tolerate durvalumab or 
do not meet retreatment criteria to receive either drug, subjects will be taken off protocol 
therapy.
Following the first dose of durvalumab, subsequent administration of durvalumab can be 
modified based on toxicities observed (see Appendix C ).  
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
39Based on the mechanism of action of durvalumab leading to T-cell activation and proliferation, 
there is the possibility of observing immune related Adverse Events (irAEs) during the conduct 
of this study.  Potential irAEs include immune-mediated enterocolitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, and 
endocrinopathies. Subjects should be monitored for signs and symptoms of irAEs.  In the 
absence of an alternate etiology (e.g., infection or PD) signs or symptoms of enterocolitis, 
dermatitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathy should be considered to be immune-related.  
Dose modification recommendations and toxicity management guidelines for immune-mediated 
reactions, for infusion-related reactions, and for non-immune-mediated reactions are detailed in 
Appendix C .  
3.3.2 Vicineum
Following any biopsy or TURBT, study drug must be interrupted for a minimum of 1 week and 
maximum of 2 weeks before restarting Vicineum treatment.  Patients who develop low grade 
papillary disease will be allowed to stay on trial. In November 2016, the FDA published a draft 
guidance for trials involving patients with BCG-unresponsive disease in which only high-risk 
disease counts as a recurrence or an event.  In this clinical setting, low-risk disease would lead to 
transurethral resection while high-risk disease would lead to cystectomy, which is a much 
different clinical outcome. Therefore, in this trial, low grade recurrences will be documented but 
will not count as a trial-ending recurrence or event.  Furthermore, low grade recurrences are 
considered to be downstaging of disease since the inclusion criteria requires patients with high 
grade disease.  
Study drug administration must be postponed if a subject develops any Grade 3 or greater 
adverse event. Study treatment may resume when the AE returns to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline or 
sooner if there is agreement between the investigator and the sponsor. Study treatment may be 
postponed at the discretion of the investigator for unrelated AEs, if this is considered in the best 
interest of the subject.  If the causal relationship between Vicineum and an AE is initially 
uncertain, study drug should be interrupted until that determination is made.  Also study 
treatment may be postponed for lower grade AEs at the investigator discretion if considered in 
the best interest of the subject.  
The following specific criteria will be used for holding Vicineum dosing based on serum 
creatinine and calculation of creatinine clearance: 
Criteria for  Holding Vicineum Treatment*
Baseline Creatinine Serum Creatinine Creatinine Clearance
<1.0 mg/dl or <88 µmol/L >1.5 mg/dl or >133 µmol/L<40 ml/min or a decrease of 
25% from baseline
≥1.0 mg/dl or ≥88 µmol/L Increase to >2 x Baseline Value<40 ml/min or a decrease of 
25% from baseline
*Vicineum dosing should be held if either the serum creatinine or the creatinine clearance criteria, as defined in this 
table, are met.
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
40If changes in renal function are noted, the investigator should evaluate the subject for the 
etiology of these changes.  Vicineum treatment may be resumed upon improvement or 
stabilization at creatinine of  ≤ 2 x baseline or ≤ 2 x ULN.
•Vicineum dosing must be held for any subject whose AST or ALT doubles from their 
baseline value and is ≥2xULN; OR for a bilirubin ≥2mg/dl (≥34 µmol/L). However, if Grade 
2 hyperbilirubinemia occurs during the DLT evaluation period, then a DLT is present and 
treatment will be permanently discontinued and patient will be removed from study. The 
investigator should evaluate subjects for the etiology of any changes in these values.  
Vicineum treatment may be resumed upon improvement or stabilization of AST and ALT of  
≤ 2 x baseline or ≤ 2 x ULN; OR for a bilirubin ≤ 2mg/dl (≤34 µmol/L) provided that Grade 
2 hyperbilirubinemia did not occur.
•The investigator should consider holding Vicineum treatment for patients with a clinically 
significant UTI requiring antibiotic therapy until improvement.  Investigators should also 
consider holding Vicineum treatment for patients with grade II hematuria.  
Missed doses should not be made up.  In the Maintenance Phase, dosing should be restarted as 
soon as there is AE resolution i.e., treatment should not be postponed longer in order to align 
with the initial every-other-week schedule. 
If study treatment is postponed longer than 3 weeks, the investigator should consider whether the 
subject should remain on treatment.
In circumstances where subjects cannot tolerate Vicineum or do not meet retreatment criteria to 
receive either drug, subjects will be taken off protocol therapy.
The reasons and details relevant to the subject postponement and/or discontinuation of study 
treatment must be recorded on the CRF. The Investigator must notify Sesen Biotherapeutics if 
study treatment is discontinued.

526. Vital signs will be obtained at a single timepoint at screening and baseline.  Subjects will have their blood pressure and pulse measured 
before, during and after the infusion at the following times (based on a 60-minute infusion):
•At the beginning of the infusion (at 0 minutes)
•At 30 minutes during the infusion (±5 minutes)
•At the end of the infusion (at 60 minutes ±5 minutes)
•In the 1 hour observation period post-infusion: 30 and 60 minutes after the infusion (ie, 90 and 120 minutes from the start of the 
infusion) (±5 minutes) – for the first infusion only and then for subsequent infusions as clinically indicated.
•If the infusion takes longer than 60 minutes then blood pressure and pulse measurements should be collected every 30 minutes (±5 
minutes) and as described above or more frequently if clinically indicated.
7. ECG during screening required to measure QTc as specified above and 1 ECG is needed while on treatment (pre-durvalumab infusion) and as 
clinically indicated.  ECGs should be obtained after the patient has been in a supine position for 5 minutes and should be recorded while the 
patient remains in that position.  In case of clinically significant ECG abnormalities, including a QTcF value >470 ms, 2 additional 12-lead 
ECGs should be obtained over a brief period (e.g., 30 minutes) to confirm prolongation.  If screening laboratory assessments are performed 
within 3 days prior to Day 1, they do not need to be repeated at Day 1.  
8. Free T3 and free T4 will only be measured if TSH is abnormal.  They should also be measured if there is clinical suspicion of an adverse 
event related to the endocrine system. During maintenance phases 4-7, TSH will be drawn prior to each durvalumab dose and subsequently 4 
weeks and 8 weeks after durvalumab administration.
9. Can be given without contrast if severe contrast allergy or renal function does not allow contrast administration per institutional 
recommendations. MRIs will be done per PI discretion and when clinically indicated.
10. First void after Vicineum administration in Week 1.
11. First void after the next morning after Vicineum administration in Week 1.
12. Day 8 void prior to Vicineum administration in Week 2.
13. H&P, Labs including renal, liver, complete blood count + platelets, coagulation studies monthly for up to 90 days after last immunotherapy. 
14.End of treatment visit will occur 90 days after the last dose of immunotherapy. If clinically indicated, patients may continue to be followed 
by phone or clinic visits beyond that time and up to a year at the NIH/NCI or their local urologist. 
15. Per PI discretion, a remote evaluation may be done by phone by a member of the study team. This evaluation will be conducted in 
compliance with NIH guidelines and FDA regulations.  A patient may be asked to come to the NIH Clinical Center or may be referred to 
their local provider for an in-person assessment, if deemed necessary by the PI.  In the case of any visits with participants’ local providers, 
records will be obtained.
3.5 COST AND COMPENSATION 
3.5.1 Costs
NIH does not bill health insurance companies or participants for any research or related clinical 
care that participants receive at the NIH Clinical Center.  If some tests and procedures are 
performed outside the NIH Clinical Center, participants may have to pay for these costs if they 
are not covered by their insurance company.  Medicines that are not part of the study treatment 
will not be provided or paid for by the NIH Clinical Center.    
3.5.2 Compensation
Participants will not be compensated on this study.
3.5.3 Reimbursement 
The NCI will cover the costs of some expenses associated with protocol participation.  Some of 
these costs may be paid directly by the NIH and some may be reimbursed to the 
participant/guardian as appropriate.  The amount and form of these payments are determined by 
the NCI Travel and Lodging Reimbursement Policy.  
3.6 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM PROTOCOL THERAPY AND OFF STUDY C RITERIA
Prior to removal from study, effort must be made to have all subjects complete monthly safety 
visits (+/- 7 days) for 90 days following the last dose of study therapy.  These visits will consist 
of H&P and labs (including renal, liver, complete blood count + platelets, coagulation studies).  
Patients will revert to standard of care once coming off study. If clinically indicated, patients 
may continue to be followed by phone or clinic visits beyond that time and up to a year at the 
NIH/NCI or their local urologist.  
3.6.1 Criteria for Removal from Protocol Therapy
Subjects are free to withdraw from further treatment or to withdraw consent to participate in this 
study at any time and without prejudice to further treatment. For subjects who withdraw their 
consent for study participation, no further study specific assessments will be performed and no 
additional study data will be collected. For subjects who withdraw from further treatment only 
will remain on study for further evaluations but receive no additional study treatment. The 
investigator may also withdraw a subject from study treatment or from the study if he or she 
deems it to be in the best interest of the subject or if the subject is unable to comply with the 
study. All subjects withdrawing only from further treatment should have enter the Post-
Treatment Period and have the appropriate assessments performed 90 days after the last dose of 
study drug, unless the subject withdraws consent for the procedures. If clinically indicated, 
patients may continue to be followed by phone or clinic visits beyond that time and up to a year 
at the NIH/NCI or their local urologist. The reasons and details relevant to subject withdrawal 
must be recorded in the source documents and in the CRFs.
In addition, an individual subject will not receive any further investigational product if any of the 
following occur in the subject in question:
•Completion of protocol therapy

relative to the known safety profile of the investigational agents in the opinion of the 
investigator
•Sponsor or Manufacturer terminates the study
•The FDA requests that the sponsor terminate treatment of a specific subject or 
subjects or all subjects
•Subject noncompliance that, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor, warrants 
withdrawal; e.g. refusal to adhere to scheduled visits
•Investigator discretion
•Positive pregnancy test or intent to become pregnant or intent to breast-feed or is 
breastfeeding
•Disease recurrence with high-grade bladder cancer
3.6.2 Off-Study Criteria
The following are off study criteria that will preclude further follow-up:
•Completed study follow-up period 
•Participant requests to be withdrawn from study
•Death
•Patient is lost to follow-up
•Patient enrolled into another clinical study
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
553.6.3 Lost to Follow-up
A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she fails to return for 3 scheduled visits 
and is unable to be contacted by the study site staff. 
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit:
•The site will attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit and 
counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and 
ascertain if the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study.
•Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee will make 
every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, 
if necessary, an IRB approved certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing 
address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in 
the participant’s medical record or study file. 
•Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up.
4 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS/MEASURES

5.1.1.2.1 Sample processing
For PBMCs, green top tubes will be obtained and then processed at the Clinical Services 
Program (CSP) NCI Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, PO Box B, Frederick, 
MD 21702 in collaboration with Dr. Schlom’s research group.  On days samples are drawn, Jen 
Bangh at CSP should be notified (phone: [301] 846-5893; fax [301] 846-6222).  Once a patient’s 
treatment schedule has been determined, Caroline Jochems should be notified at 
jochemscm@mail.nih.gov for planning purposes.  Dr. Schlom and colleagues recently published 
their ability to analyze PBMCs for 123 subsets of peripheral immune cells using 30 unique 
markers in 5 immune flow cytometry panels.  These subsets are subsets of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ 
T cells, Tregs, B cells, NK cells, NK-T cells, conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), plasmacytoid 
DCs (pDCs), and MDSCs.  A full list is enclosed in Appendix D .  
5.1.2 Research urine studies
5.1.2.1 Urine cytokines 
Urine collection at the timepoints indicated in the table in section 5.2 for correlative/exploratory 
research aims (e.g. inflammatory cells, cytokines) at baseline.  This will be performed through a

- see table in section 5.2 for PK timepoints
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
585.1.2.3 Sample Processing
For urine collection, it will be processed according to standard protocol (refer to Appendix E) 
and stored in the Urologic Oncology Branch in Dr. Linehan’s lab.  Samples will be batched at 
the end of the trial and then analyzed.  
5.1.3 Tissue studies
Samples will be obtained pre-and post treatment as indicated in the table in section 5.2 to:
•Perform immunohistochemistry (IHC) or cytogenetic analysis of baseline tissue (FFPE or 
frozen tissue specimen) for EpCAM, PD-1/PD-L1, TILS, CD4, CD8, Tregs, MDSCs, 
Macrophages, and monocytes.  In addition, mesenchymal markers such as vimentin, 
TWIST, Snail, Slug, and Sip1 may also be assessed by immunohistochemistry of baseline 
tissue.  This can be compared to similar IHC of tissue obtained from the last biopsy on trial.  
This analysis will be performed by the NCI Laboratory of Pathology upon accruing at least 
4 patients or by PI’s discretion.  Baseline FFPE slides will be obtained from paraffin-
embedded blocks stored within NCI’s Laboratory of Pathology at a future date when 
analysis will be performed.  In the event that patients have had baseline biopsy at an 
outside institution, every effort will be made to obtain the paraffin-embedded blocks in 
order to generate baseline FFPE slides for further analysis.  
In particular to the current study, we would like to study the T-cell infiltration pattern 
within bladder tumors pre- and post-treatment. Specifically, we will look at: 
1. The presence of CD4 and CD8 T cells in bladder tumor specimens pre- and post-
treatment 
2. The presence of regulatory T cells (Tregs) by double staining with FoxP3 and 
CD4 in bladder tumor specimens pre- and post-treatment
3. The presence of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in bladder tumor 
specimens pre- and post-treatment 
4. The presence of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in bladder tumor 
specimens pre- and post-treatment 
5. The presence of PD-L1 staining pre- and post-treatment as specified below in 
section 5.1.3.2.
6. The presence of EpCAM and mesenchymal markers.
•If sufficient tissue is available, cell lines may be generated.  Cell lines may be characterized 
by karyotyping, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) mapping, 
immunohistochemistry, and/or flow cytometry. Differences between cell lines will be 
manipulated to study the various molecular pathways active in nutrient sensing, cell cycle, 
cell signaling, proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastatic potential in urothelial 
cancer.
•If adequate tissue and funding available, then may perform mutational load analysis 
through a targeted panel (RNAseq or DNA mutation panel) of tumor tissue. This analysis 
will be performed by the NCI CORE facility, NCI collaborator (Paul Meltzer), or outside 
entity (e.g. Foundation Medicine)
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
595.1.3.1 Tissue Collection Procedures  
If tissue is clinically available, the Urologic Oncology Branch procedures for tissue collection 
will be followed. This is usually done with standard of care procedures such as such as 
transurethral resection of bladder tumor.  CT guided biopsy is not a procedure by which to 
procure non-muscle invasive bladder tumor and so it will not be performed on this protocol.  A 
procurement form will be completed. The tissue procurement nurse or a UOB-designated 
procurement staff member will work with an NCI pathologist following resection of the 
specimen to obtain tumor tissue from the resected specimen. this will be done using standard of 
care procedures  This will then be delivered by the procurement nurse or UOB Procurement staff 
member to the Urologic Oncology Branch Research Laboratory for individual processing. 
Specimens will be placed in cryovials and also be snap frozen in OCT for frozen tissue sections. 
Tissue sent to pathology will be processed in standard fashion but when formalin-fixed paraffin 
embedded slides made, they will be modified as below in section 5.1.3.2 to allow for PD-L1 
testing in a standardized fashion.  
Pathologic material, such as fixed tissue blocks from surgery performed at the NIH Clinical 
Center, outside surgeries or autopsy materials, may be obtained at the request of, and with 
written permission from the subject, or appropriate relatives. These samples may undergo 
pathologic analysis by individuals in the NCI Laboratory of Pathology to confirm diagnosis and 
may undergo histo-immunologic or other analysis. 
5.1.3.2 Tissue PD-L1 Testing
To ensure comparability of data across all studies of durvalumab and to gain real world experience 
on the performance of this assay, it is strongly encouraged that all studies that include PD-L1 
testing utilize the Ventana SP263 assay.  Testing should be restricted to the Ventana SP263 assay 
and should be performed in accordance with the package insert on the Ventana Benchmark 
platform (Ultra or XT).  
The Ventana SP263 assay is fully analytically validated test characterized through to the 
completion of reader precision studies in the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and squamous 
cell carcinoma of the head & neck (SCCHN).  For these tumors, the Ventana SP263 assay has a 
fully reproducibility data package supporting cut-off and scoring algorithm.  Following completion 
of ATLANTIC and HAWK clinical trials, the assay will be associated with clinical utility.  In 
other cancer types (bladder, pancreatic, gastric, hepatocellular, triple negative breast, ovarian, 
esophageal, nasopharyngeal, glioblastoma, soft tissue sarcoma, cholangiocarcinoma, small cell 
lung, melanoma and cervical HPV+ cancers), the Ventana SP263 assay has only limited clinical 
performance data.  
5.1.3.2.1 Sample collection for PD-L1 testing
•The preferred tumor sample for the determination of a patient’s PD-L1 status is the one 
taken following the completion of the most recent prior line of therapy.  Samples taken at 
this time reflect the current PD-L1 status of the tumor and considered clinically most 
relevant.  
•In AstraZeneca studies, the preferred sample for PD-L1 testing was less than or equal to 3 
months old.  In cases where a sample a less than 3 months old was not available, patients 
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
60were asked to undergo a new biopsy if considered clinically appropriate by their treating 
physician.  
•Samples should be collected via a core needle of 18 gauge or larger or be collected by an 
incisional or excisional tumor biopsy.  Where institutional practice uses a smaller gauge 
needle, samples should be evaluated for tumor cell quantity (i.e. >100 tumor cells) to allow 
for adequate PD-L1 immunohistochemistry analyses.  
•When the collection of a new sample is not clinically appropriate, archival samples may be 
utilized provided the specimen it is not older than 3 years of age.  When archival samples 
are used to assess PD-L1 status, the age of the sample / date of collection should be 
captured.  
•Samples submitted for PD-L1 testing should be formalin fixed and embedded in paraffin.  
Samples from fine needle aspirates (FNA) or decalcified bone are not appropriate for PD-
L1 analysis.  
5.1.3.2.2 Sample data collection for PD-L1 testing
The following fields of data should be collected from the site/institution collecting and if, indicated 
shipping of the samples:  
•Patient identifier (unique identifier)
•Specimen identifier (written on the specimen)
•Site identifier
•Specimen collection date
•Type of specimen submitted
•Quantity of specimen
•Date of sectioning
•Archival of fresh tumor
•Tumor type
•Primary tumor location
•Metastatic tumor location (if applicable)
•Fixative
The following fields of data should be collected from PD-L1 testing laboratory:
•Are the negative and positive controls stained correctly
•Is the H&E material acceptable
•Is morphology acceptable
•Total percent positivity of PD-L1 in tumor cells
•PD-L1 status (positive, negative or NA) in tumor cells 
•Total percent positivity of PD-L1 in infiltrating immune cells
The Ventana SP263 assay to measure PD-L1 in tumors is experimental.  As with all tests, there is 
a chance of false positive (the test shows high PD-L1 when it is not there) or false negative (the 
test does not show PD-L1 when it is there) results may occur.  
5.1.3.2.3 Sample processing for PD-L1 testing
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
61Preparing Stored samples for testing
•Where samples already exist, they should be retrieved from the Bio-Bank storage location.  
These blocks should undergo quality review, prior to evaluation or shipment.  Where it is 
not possible or indicated to ship the block to a testing laboratory, unstained slides should 
be prepared from the paraffin-embedded tumor sample block (described below) prior to 
evaluation or shipment.  
Preparing newly acquired samples for PD-L1 testing
•If patients are undergoing a biopsy procedure that provides the option to submit newly 
acquired samples, this sample should be used to determine PD-L1 status.  Where clinically 
acceptable, a minimum of 2 core biopsies should be collected and processed to FFPE in a 
single block.  The provision of 2 cores is advised in order to provide sufficient tissue for 
PD-L1 assessment. 
•It is recommended that core needle tumor biopsies are collected using an 18 gauge or larger 
needle and the process should be image-guided.  Excisional or incisional samples are also 
adequate.  If this is not per the institutions normal practice and a smaller gauge needle is 
used then the number of cores collected should be increased to allow sufficient material for 
successful PD-L1 testing (>100 tumor cells) and embedded in the same block.  If available, 
a single excisional biopsy of at least 4 mm in diameter may substitute for all core biopsies. 
Fixation of biopsy samples for PD-L1 testing
•Previously frozen tissue is not acceptable for processing to FFPE for PD-L1 testing.  To 
fix newly acquired tissue, place immediately (within 30 min of excision) into an adequate 
volume of 10% v/v neutral buffered formalin (NBF).  Samples should remain in fixative 
for 24 – 48 hours at room temperature.  
•It is vital that there is an adequate volume of fixative relevant to the tissue (at least a 10 
volume excess) and that large specimens (if any) are incised prior to fixation to promote 
efficient tissue preservation.  
Embedding in paraffin for PD-L1 testing
•An overnight processing schedule into paraffin wax is recommended 
•Below is the suggested routine overnight processing schedule
Storage of tumor blocks for PD-L1 testing
•FFPE blocks should be stored at ambient temperature and protected from light until 
shipment by courier at ambient temperature. FFPE blocks are stable under these conditions 
for an indefinite period.
Quality control of samples to be used for PD-L1 testing
•Tissue should be assessed by the site pathologist prior to PD-L1 testing.  
•Each sample should be reviewed for:
•Adequate fixation
•Good preservation of morphology
•Presence of tumor tissue
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
62•Histopathology consistent with indication
•Greater than 100 tumor cells are required to determine PD-L1 status – tumor cell 
content must be reviewed prior to testing in order for PD-L1 obtain a valid result.  
If indicated, shipping samples to a PD-L1 testing laboratory
•When submitting sample to for PD-L1 testing the recommendation is to ship the block in 
order for sectioning to occur at the laboratory.  Blocks should be shipped - containing 
enough material to be provided to allow a minimum of 5, and preferably 10, sections to be 
cut (each 4 micron thick) to be used for PD-L1 testing.   
Sectioning instructions
•Where it is not possible or indicated to ship the block to laboratory for PD-L1 testing, 
unstained slides should be prepared from the paraffin-embedded tumor sample block as 
described below:  
•A minimum of 5-10 x 4 micron (μm) thick, unstained sections should be provided 
for PD-L1 testing
•A new disposable microtome blade must be used for each block to prevent 
contamination between Slides are stable under these conditions for 6 months.
•patient samples
•Apply one section per slide to positively-charged Superfrost glass slides 
•The sections should be dried overnight between room temperature and 37°C. Do 
not dry sections at temperatures above 37°C.
Sections should be stored at ambient temperature and protected from light until use or shipment to 
testing lab by courier at ambient temperature.  It is recommended that slides are cut freshly prior 
to PD-L1 testing and they are used within 90 days of being cut to obtain PD-L1 status
Any additional FFPE tissue obtained that is not used for PD-L1 testing can be used for the 
following additional correlative assays:
1. Tissue Immune Correlates - (FFPE or frozen tissue specimens) - pre-treated and post-
treated samples can be analyzed by IHC (FFPE) for Epcam, TILs, CD4, CD8, Tregs, 
MDSCs, Macrophages, and monocytes.  In addition, mesenchymal markers such as 
vimentin, TWIST, Snail, Slug, and Sip1 may also be assayed by IHC.  
2. Frozen tissue specimens or a single FFPE slide can be analyzed later for tumor 
mutational load through targeted sequencing panel.
Frozen tissue specimens or a single FFPE slide for gene expression using HT Seq immune-
oncology panel of 500+ genes and/or microRNA analysis.

655.3.1 UOB Research Laboratory
All specimens obtained for research purposes will be coded upon arrival in the UOB research 
laboratory to maintain patient confidentiality.  All samples will be accessioned and entered into a 
database (such as LabMatrix) with access limited to the PI and UOB research data managers.  
The location of all samples will be carefully tracked in the database.  All stored samples will be 
coded and identifying patient information will not be placed on sample containers.  Stored 
samples will be kept in freezers/refrigerators or secure containers located in the Urologic 
Oncology Branch research laboratories or in approved storage facilities.  The research samples 
collected will be used for the correlative/biomarker studies mentioned above in Section 5.1.  
Tissue slides/blocks may be obtained in order to determine protocol eligibility.  Tissues are 
submitted to the NCI Laboratory of Pathology at the NIH Clinical Center for clinical 
determination of histologic features.  Specialized stains/assays may be used to clarify tissue 
phenotype.  After completion of analysis, tissue slides/blocks are either returned to the 
originating pathology department or archived in the Laboratory of Pathology or Urologic 
Oncology Branch and tracked in the UOB database (LabMatrix).  Archived material will be 
retained for the duration of the study unless the originating pathology department requests return.
Coded/anonymous samples with minimal clinical information may be shared with qualified NIH 
and non-NIH researchers who have IRB-approved protocols with similar research objectives.   
No personal identifying information such as name, address, or date of birth will be provided to 
the non-UOB investigator.  In the event a subject is eligible to participate in a clinical trial based 
on tumor characteristics, coded tissue samples may be sent to an outside laboratory.  
5.3.2 Samples (serum samples for cytokines) Stored with Clinical Pharmacology Program 
(Figg Laboratory)
5.3.2.1 Procedures for sample data collection for the Clinical Pharmacology Program: 
Please e-mail NCIBloodcore@mail.nih.gov at least 24 hours before transporting samples (the 
Friday before is preferred).
For sample pickup, page 102-11964.
For immediate help, call 240-760-6180 (main biospecimen processing core number) or, if no 
answer, 240-760-6190 (main clinical pharmacology lab number).
For questions regarding sample processing, contact NCIBloodcore@mail.nih.gov.
All samples sent to the Clinical Pharmacology Program (CPP) will be barcoded, with data 
entered and stored in the Labmatrix utilized by the CPP. This is a secure program, with access to 
Labmatrix limited to defined CPP personnel, who are issued individual user accounts. 
Installation of Labmatrix is limited to computers specified by Dr. Figg. These computers all have 
a password restricted login screen. 
Labmatrix creates a unique barcode ID for every sample and sample box, which cannot be traced 
back to patients without Labmatrix access. The data recorded for each sample includes the 
patient ID, name, trial name/protocol number, time drawn, cycle time point, dose, material type, 
as well as box and freezer location. Patient demographics associated with the Clinical Center 
patient number are provided in the system. For each sample, there are notes associated with the 
processing method (delay in sample processing, storage conditions on the ward, etc.). 
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
665.3.2.2 Procedures for sample storage at the Clinical Pharmacology Program: 
Barcoded samples are stored in barcoded boxes in a locked freezer at either -20oC or - 80oC 
according to stability requirements. These freezers are located onsite in the CPP and offsite at 
NCI Frederick Central Repository Services in Frederick, MD. Visitors to the laboratory are 
required to be accompanied by laboratory staff at all times. 
Access to stored clinical samples is restricted. Samples will be stored until requested by a 
researcher named on the protocol. All requests are monitored and tracked in Labmatrix. All 
researchers are required to sign a form stating that the samples are only to be used for research 
purposes associated with this trial (as per the IRB approved protocol) and that any unused 
samples must be returned to the CPP. It is the responsibility of the NCI Principal Investigator to 
ensure that the samples requested are being used in a manner consistent with IRB approval. 
Following completion of this study, samples will remain in storage as detailed above. Access to 
these samples will only be granted following IRB approval of an additional protocol, granting 
the rights to use the material. 
If, at any time, a patient withdraws from the study and does not wish for their existing samples to 
be utilized, the individual must provide a written request. Following receipt of this request, the 
samples will be destroyed (or returned to the patient, if so requested. The PI will record any loss 
or unanticipated destruction of samples as a deviation. Reporting will be per the requirements of 
section 7.2.1.
Sample barcodes are linked to patient demographics and limited clinical information. This 
information will only be provided to investigators listed on this protocol, via registered use of the 
Labmatrix. It is critical that the sample remains linked to patient information such as race, age, 
dates of diagnosis and death, and histological information about the tumor, in order to correlate 
genotype with these variables.
5.3.3 Clinical Services Program
All data associated with the patient samples is protected by using a secure database.  All samples 
drawn at the NIH Clinical Center will be transported to the NCI Frederick Central Repository by 
couriers.
Samples will be tracked and managed by the Central Repository database.  All samples will be 
stored in liquid nitrogen.  These freezers are located at NCI Frederick Central Repository in 
Frederick, Maryland.
NCI Frederick Central Repositories (managed under a subcontract) store, among other things, 
biological specimens in support of NIH clinical studies. All specimens are stored in secure, 
limited access facilities with sufficient security, back-up and emergency support capability and 
monitoring to ensure long-term integrity of the specimens for research. 
The subcontractor’s role is limited to clinical research databases and repositories containing 
patient specimens. The subcontractor neither conducts nor has any vested interest in research on 
human subjects, but does provide services and supports the efforts of its customers, many of 
which are involved in research on human subjects. 
It is the intent and purpose of the subcontractor to accept only codedsamples and sample 
information.  If the coded data are linked, the code key will not be accepted.To the best of our 
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
67ability, every effort will be made to ensure that protected information is not sent electronically or 
by hard copy or on vial labels. 
Sample data is stored in the BioSpecimen Inventory (BSI) System II. This inventory tracking 
system is used to manage the storage and retrieval of specimens as well as maintain specimen 
data. BSI is designed for controlled, concurrent access. It provides a real-time, multi-user 
environment for tracking millions of specimens. The system controls how and in what order 
database updates and searches are performed. This control prevents deadlocks and race 
conditions. For security, BSI has user password access, 3 types of user access levels, and 36 user 
permissions (levels of access) that can be set to control access to the system functions. BSI 
provides audit tracking for processes that are done to specimens including shipping, returning to 
inventory, aliquoting, thawing, additives, and other processes. BSI tracks the ancestry of 
specimens as they are aliquoted, as well as discrepancies and discrepancy resolution for 
specimens received by the repository. If a specimen goes out of the inventory, the system 
maintains data associated with the withdrawal request. Vials are labeled with a unique BSI ID 
which is printed in both eye-readable and bar-coded format. No patient-specific information is 
encoded in this ID. 
Investigators are granted view, input and withdrawal authority only for their specimens.  They 
may not view specimen data or access specimens for which they have not been authorized. 
Access to specimen storage is confined to repository staff. Visitors to the repositories are 
escorted by repository staff at all times.
5.3.4 Protocol Completion/Sample Destruction
All specimens obtained in the protocol are used as defined in the protocol. Any specimens 
remaining at the completion of the protocol will be stored in the conditions described above. The 
study will remain open as long as sample or data analysis continues. Samples will be stored until 
they are no longer of scientific value or until a subject withdraws consent for their continued use, 
at which time they will be destroyed. If the patient withdraws consent, the participants data will 
be excluded from future distributions but data that have already been distributed for approved 
research use will not be able to be retrieved.
Once primary research objectives for the protocol are achieved, intramural researchers can 
request access to remaining samples, provided they have an IRB-approved protocol and patient 
consent or an exemption from OHSRP. 
The PI will record any loss or unanticipated destruction of samples as a deviation. Reporting will 
be per the requirements of section 7.2.
5.4 SAMPLES FOR GENETIC/GENOMIC ANALYSIS
5.4.1 Proposed Genetic Analysis
Protein, DNA mutational analysis, and miRNA/mRNA for immune gene expression profile 
analysis (quantitative polymerase chain reaction [Q-PCR]) of known and putative targets 
obtained from tumor tissue at baseline if adequate tumor tissue is available for such an analysis.  
The analysis will be performed through one of the following platforms:  
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
68•Targeted DNA mutational panel from frozen tissue or FFPE via NCI Core facility, 
collaborator (Paul Meltzer), or outside entity (e.g. Foundation Medicine) if adequate 
funding and tissue available
•HT seq from single FFPE slide for immune-oncology panel of 500+ genes or 
microRNA analysis – NCI CORE facility or Development Therapeutics Branch 
Clinical Trial Unit (DTB CTU)
•Nanostring panel for immune oncology related genes obtained from tumor tissue
5.4.2 Description of how privacy and confidentiality of medical information/biological 
specimens will be maximized
Using a computerized inventory system (LabMatrix), each new specimen collected will be 
assigned a unique barcode identifier that can be linked to the original specimen collected but 
personal identifiers will be removed.  
For each specimen, the corresponding subject demographics and clinical information will be 
assigned in the database as described in section 6.1 and only be accessible by the PI and research 
nurses within the UOB through a password-protected database.
Samples provided to other researchers will be bar coded and these researchers will not have 
access to any information in LabMatrix. Samples will not be sent outside NIH without 
appropriate approvals and/or agreements, if required.
Data from genomic analysis will be deposited in dbGAP.
5.4.3 Management of Results
Subjects will be contacted if a clinically actionable gene variant is discovered. Clinically 
actionable findings for the purpose of this study are defined as disorders appearing in the 
American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recommendations for the return of 
incidental findings that is current at the time of primary analysis. Subjects will be contacted at 
this time with a request to provide a sample to be sent to a CLIA certified laboratory. If the 
research findings are verified in the CLIA certified lab, the subject will be offered the 
opportunity to come to NIH (at our expense) to have genetic education and counseling to 
explain this result.  If the subject does not want to come to NIH, a referral to a local genetic 
healthcare provider will be provided (at their expense).
This is the only time during the course of the study that incidental findings will be returned. No 
interrogations regarding clinically actionable findings will be made after the primary analysis .
Note:  incidental findings considered clinically relevant will be discussed among Senior Scientific 
Staff at meetings such as the weekly UOB conference prior to being communicated to subjects.
5.4.4 Genetic counseling
Genetic counseling will be recommended should any clinically relevant incidental findings be 
discovered and consultation with the NCI Genetics Branch will be offered.

696 DATA COLLECTION AND EVALUATION 
6.1 DATA COLLECTION
The PI will be responsible for overseeing entry of data into a 21 CFR Part 11-compliant data 
capture system provided by the NCI CCR and ensuring data accuracy, consistency and 
timeliness. The principal investigator, associate investigators/research nurses and/or a contracted 
data manager will assist with the data management efforts.  Primary and final analyzed data will 
have identifiers so that research data can be attributed to an individual human subject participant.
All AEs, including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory evaluations, regardless 
of severity, will be followed until return to baseline or stabilization of event. Document AEs 
from the first study intervention, Week 1/Day 1, through 90 days after the last administration of 
the study intervention. After 90 days, only adverse events which are serious and related to the 
study intervention need to be recorded.
An abnormal laboratory value will be considered an AE if the laboratory abnormality is 
characterized by any of the following:
•Results in discontinuation from the study
•Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
•Requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention
•Is associated with death or another serious adverse event, including hospitalization. 
•Is judged by the Investigator to be of significant clinical impact
•If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator will 
provide details about the action taken with respect to the test drug and about the patient’s 
outcome.
End of study procedures: Data will be stored according to HHS, FDA regulations and NIH 
Intramural Records Retention Schedule as applicable. 
Loss or destruction of data: Should we become aware that a major breach in our plan to protect 
subject confidentiality and trial data has occurred, this will be reported expeditiously per 
requirements in section 7.2.1.  
6.2 DATA SHARING PLANS

Version Date: 05/22/2025
70•An NIH-funded or approved public repository.  Insert name or names: clinicaltrials.gov, 
dbGaP.
•BTRIS (automatic for activities in the Clinical Center)
•Approved outside collaborators under appropriate individual agreements.
•Publication and/or public presentations.
When will the data be shared? 
•Before publication.
•At the time of publication or shortly thereafter.
6.2.2 Genomic Data Sharing Plan
Unlinked genomic data will be deposited in public genomic databases such as dbGaP in 
compliance with the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy.
6.2.3 Response Criteria
Patients will be evaluated every 3 months as per standard of care with cystoscopy.  Biopsy will 
be done at PI discretion pending cystoscopic findings.  Any biopsies done will be for clinical 
reasons to rule out tumor recurrence, however, extra biopsy material if available will be used for 
research purposes.  
Evaluable for toxicity:  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first 
treatment with vicineum or durvalumab.  All observed toxicities will be tabulated using CTCAE 
v5.0.  
6.2.4 Evaluable for Objective Secondary Endpoints/Response
Only those patients who have biopsy-proven disease present at baseline, have received at least 
one intravesical dose of Vicineum therapy and one intravenous dose of durvalumab, and have 
had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response.  These patients will 
have their response classified according to the definitions stated below.  
6.2.4.1 Recurrence-free survival
The recurrence-free survival duration will be measured from the start of Vicineum therapy until 
disease recurrence, progression, or death due to any cause.  Recurrence is suspected and/or 
determined by urine cytology and/or cystoscopic exam and then confirmed pathologically after a 
TURBT.  Positive cytology in the absence of pathologic confirmation is not considered to be a 
recurrence.  Low grade papillary tumor will not be considered recurrent disease.
6.2.4.2 Complete Response Rate for CIS
In patients with any component of CIS upon study entry, the complete response (CR) rate will be 
determined at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months from the start of Vicineum therapy.  Complete 
response will be defined as the absence of CIS upon follow-up biospies.  These rates can be 
compared to historical rates of CR for CIS at these various time points. 
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
716.2.4.3 Disease Progression & Progression-Free Survival
PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, 
whichever occurs first. The duration of progression-free survival is measured from the start of 
vicineum therapy until progression or death due to any cause. Disease progression is defined as 
upstaging from a lower stage to a higher stage (e.g., Ta to T1-T4 or T1 to T2-4; CIS to T1 or CIS 
to T2-T4; or any N+ or M+ in these high grade tumors).  
6.2.4.4 Time to Tumor Recurrence
The duration of time measured from the start of Vicineum therapy until recurrence is noted.
6.3 TOXICITY CRITERIA
The following adverse event management guidelines are intended to ensure the safety of each 
patient while on the study.  The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be utilized for AE 
reporting.  All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 
5.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_50).

research staff. 
8 SPONSOR SAFETY REPORTING
8.1 DEFINITIONS
8.1.1 Adverse Event 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product (ICH E6 (R2)).
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following:
•Death,
•A life-threatening adverse event (see 8.1.3)
•Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
oA hospitalization/admission that is pre-planned (i.e., elective or scheduled surgery 
arranged prior to the start of the study), a planned hospitalization for pre-existing 
condition, or a procedure required by the protocol, without a serious deterioration in 
health, is not considered a serious adverse event.
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
73oA hospitalization/admission that is solely driven by non-medical reasons (e.g., 
hospitalization for patient or subject convenience) is not considered a serious adverse 
event. 
oEmergency room visits or stays in observation units that do not result in admission to 
the hospital would not be considered a serious adverse event. The reason for seeking 
medical care should be evaluated for meeting one of the other serious criteria.
•Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions
•A congenital anomaly/birth defect.
•Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.
8.1.3 Life-threatening 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "life-threatening" if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death. (21CFR312.32).
8.1.4 Severity
The severity of each Adverse Event will be assessed utilizing the CTCAE version 5.0.
8.1.5 Relationship to Study Product
All AEs will have their relationship to study product assessed using the terms:  related or not 
related.  
•Related – There is a reasonable possibility that the study product caused the adverse 
event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the study product and the adverse event.
•Not Related – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
product caused the event.
8.1.6 Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is one of scientific and medical interest specific to 
understanding of the Investigational Product and may require close monitoring and rapid 
communication by the investigator to the sponsor. An AESI may be serious or non-serious. The 
rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize and 
understand them in association with the use of this investigational product.
AESIs for durvalumab include but are not limited to events with a potential inflammatory or 
immune-mediated mechanism and which may require more frequent monitoring and/or 
interventions such as steroids, immunosuppressants and/or hormone replacement therapy. These 
AESIs are being closely monitored in clinical studies with durvalumab monotherapy and 
combination therapy. An immune-mediated adverse event (imAE) is defined as an AESI that is 
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
74associated with drug exposure and is consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism of action 
and where there is no clear alternate etiology. Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) 
data, as appropriate, should be used to support an imAE diagnosis. Appropriate efforts should be 
made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic causes of the imAE. 
In the event of imAE or suspected imAE, the AstraZeneca study team may request relevant 
clinical information (including images) for those subjects who demonstrate the event, and may 
request the independent review by external experts based on the acquired clinical information. 
AESIs observed with durvalumab include:
•Diarrhea / Colitis and intestinal perforation
•Pneumonitis / ILD
•hepatitis / transaminase increases
•Endocrinopathies (i.e. events of hypophysitis/hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, 
hyper- and hypothyroidism and type I diabetes mellitus)
•Rash / Dermatitis
•Nephritis / Blood creatinine increases
•Pancreatitis / serum lipase and amylase increases  
•Myositis / Polymyositis
•Neuropathy / neuromuscular toxicity (e.g. Guillain-Barré, and myasthenia gravis)
•Intestinal Perforations
Other inflammatory responses that are rare/less frequent with a potential immune-mediated 
etiology include, but are not limited to:
•Myocarditis
•Pericarditis
•Sarcoidosis
•Uveitis
•Other events involving the eye and skin
•Hematological events
•Rheumatological events
•Vasculitis
•Non-infectious meningitis
•Non-infectious encephalitis
•Pemphigoid
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
75It is possible that events with an inflammatory or immune mediated mechanism could occur in 
nearly all organs. In addition, infusion-related reactions and hypersensitivity/anaphylactic 
reactions with a different underlying pharmacological aetiology are also considered AESIs. 
Further information on these risks (e.g., presenting symptoms) can be found in the current 
version of the durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure. More specific guidelines for their evaluation 
and treatment are described in detail in the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management 
Guidelines (see Appendix C ). These guidelines have been prepared by the Sponsor to assist the 
Investigator in the exercise of his/her clinical judgment in treating these types of toxicities.  
These guidelines apply to AEs considered causally related to the study drug/study regimen by the 
reporting investigator.
8.2 ASSESSMENT OF S AFETY EVENTS
AE information collected will include event description, date of onset, assessment of severity 
and relationship to study product and alternate etiology (if not related to study product), date of 
resolution of the event, seriousness and outcome. The assessment of severity and relationship to 
the study product will be done only by those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis 
and listed on the Form FDA 1572 as the site principal investigator or sub-investigator.  AEs 
occurring during the collection and reporting period will be documented appropriately regardless 
of relationship.  AEs will be followed through resolution.
SAEs will be:
•Assessed for severity and relationship to study product and alternate etiology (if not 
related to study product) by a licensed study physician listed on the Form FDA 1572 as 
the site principal investigator or sub-investigator.
•Recorded on the appropriate SAE report form, the medical record and captured in the 
clinical database.
•Followed through resolution by a licensed study physician listed on the Form FDA 1572 
as the site principal investigator or sub-investigator.
For timeframe of recording adverse events, please refer to section 6.1. All serious adverse events 
recorded from the time of first investigational product administration must be reported to the 
sponsor.
8.3 REPORTING OF SERIOUS A DVERSE EVENTS
Any AE that meets a protocol-defined serious criteria or meets the definition of Adverse Event 
of Special Interest that require expedited reporting must be submitted immediately (within 24 
hours of awareness) to OSRO Safety using the CCR SAE report form.
All SAE reporting must include the elements described in 8.2.
SAE reports will be submitted to the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) at: 
OSROSafety@mail.nih.gov and to the CCR PI and study coordinator.  CCR SAE report form 
and instructions can be found at: https://nih.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/NCI-CCR-OCD-
Communications/SitePages/Forms-and-Instructions.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=uWBXtI 
Following the assessment of the SAE by OSRO, other supporting documentation of the event 
may be requested by the OSRO Safety and should be provided as soon as possible.

768.4 SAFETY R EPORTING CRITERIA TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL COLLABORATORS 
8.4.1 Safety Reporting Criteria to AstraZeneca
8.4.1.1 Safety Reports sent by OSRO
All SAEs will be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational 
product, or to the study procedure(s). The reporting period for SAEs is the period immediately 
following the time that written informed consent is obtained through 90 days after the last dose 
of durvalumab or until the initiation of alternative anticancer therapy. The investigator and/or 
Sponsor are responsible for informing the Ethics Committee and/or the Regulatory Authority of 
the SAE as per local requirements.
The investigator and/or sponsor must inform the FDA, via a MedWatch/AdEERs form, of any 
serious or unexpected adverse events that occur in accordance with the reporting obligations of 
21 CFR 312.32, and will concurrently forward all such reports to AstraZeneca. A copy of the 
MedWatch/AdEERs report must be emailed to AstraZeneca at the time the event is reported to 
the FDA. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to compile all necessary information and ensure 
that the FDA receives a report according to the FDA reporting requirement timelines and to 
ensure that these reports are also submitted to AstraZeneca at the same time.
* A cover page should accompany the MedWatch/AdEERs form indicating the following:
•“Notification from an Investigator Sponsored Study”
•The investigator IND number assigned by the FDA
•The investigator’s name and address
•The trial name/title and AstraZeneca ISS reference number (ESR-##-#####)
* Sponsor must also indicate, either in the SAE report or the cover page, the causality of events 
in relation to all study medications and if the SAE is related to disease progression, as 
determined by the principal investigator.
* Send SAE report and accompanying cover page by way of email to AstraZeneca’s designated 
mailbox:  AEMailboxClinicalTrialTCS@astrazeneca.com
If a non-serious AE becomes serious, this and other relevant follow-up information must also be 
provided to AstraZeneca and the FDA.
8.4.1.2 Safety Reports sent by the Study Team
Serious adverse events that do not require expedited reporting to the FDA still need to be 
reported to AstraZeneca preferably using the MedDRA coding language for serious adverse 
events. This information should be reported on a monthly basis and under no circumstance less 
frequently than quarterly. 
In the case of blinded trials, AstraZeneca will request that the Sponsor either provide a copy of 
the randomization code/ code break information or unblind those SAEs which require expedited 
reporting.
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
77On a monthly basis, non-expedited SAEs will be provided to Collaborator Patient Safety 
Department via fax at:  (301) 398-4205 and email  to: drugsafety@medimmune.com and 
AEMailboxClinicalTrialTCS@astrazeneca.com.
8.4.2 Safety Reporting Criteria to Sesen Biotherapeutics  
As soon as the investigator becomes aware that an adverse event meets the criteria for being a 
serious adverse event (SAE) the following is required:
•The investigator will notify Sesen Biotherapeutics within twenty-four (24) hours of 
becoming aware of the SAE by submitting a completed SAE form and any supporting 
documentation to Sesen Biotherapeutics.  
•The SAE form and supporting documentation should be scanned and emailed to Sesen 
Biotherapeutics at with joycelyn.entwistle@sesenbio.com and

8.5 REPORTING PREGNANCY
All required pregnancy reports/follow-up to OSRO will be submitted to: 
OSROSafety@mail.nih.gov and to the CCR PI and study coordinator.  Forms and instructions 
can be found here: https://nih.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/NCI-CCR-OCD-
Communications/SitePages/Forms-and-Instructions.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=uWBXtI 
8.5.1 Maternal  exposure
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study, the study treatment should be 
discontinued immediately, and the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor no later than 24 hours of 
when the Investigator becomes aware of it. The Investigator should notify the Sponsor no later 
than 24 hours of when the outcome of the Pregnancy become known,
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an SAE. However, congenital abnormalities or birth defects 
and spontaneous miscarriages that meet serious criteria (section 8.1.2) should be reported as 
SAEs. 
The outcome of all pregnancies should be followed up and documented.
8.5.2 Paternal exposure
Male patients should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 
120 days after the last dose of Durvalumab and Vicineum. 
Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE. The outcome of all pregnancies  
occurring from the date of the first dose until 120 days after the last dose should, if possible, be 
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
78followed up and documented. Pregnant partners may be offered the opportunity to participate in 
an institutional pregnancy registry protocol (e.g., the NIH IRP pregnancy registry study) to 
provide data about the outcome of the pregnancy for safety reporting purposes.
8.6 REGULATORY R EPORTING FOR STUDIES C ONDUCTED UNDER CCR-S PONSORED IND
Following notification from the investigator, CCR, the IND sponsor, will report any suspected 
adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected.  CCR will report an AE as a suspected 
adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study 
product and the adverse event.  CCR will notify FDA and all participating investigators (i.e., all 
investigators to whom the sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any investigator’s 
IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks from clinical trials or any other source, as 
soon as possible, in accordance to 21 CFR Part 312.32. 
All serious events will be reported to the FDA at least annually in a summary format.
8.7 SPONSOR PROTOCOL DEVIATION REPORTING
A Protocol Deviation is defined as any non-compliance with the clinical trial Protocol, Manual 
of Operational Procedures (MOP) and other Sponsor approved study related documents, GCP, or 
protocol-specific procedural requirements on the part of the participant, the Investigator, or the 
study site staff inclusive of site personnel performing procedures or providing services in support 
of the clinical trial.
It is the responsibility of the study Staff to document any protocol deviation identified by the 
Staff or the site Monitor in the CCR Protocol Deviation Tracking System (PDTS) online 
application. The entries into the PDTS online application should be timely, complete, and 
maintained per CCR PDTS user requirements. 
In addition, any deviation to the protocol should be documented in the participant’s source 
records and reported to the reviewing IRB per their guidelines. OSRO required protocol 
deviation reporting is consistent with E6(R2) GCP: Integrated Addendum to ICH E6(R1): 4.5 
Compliance with Protocol; 5.18.3 (a), and 5.20 Noncompliance; and ICH E3 16.2.2 Protocol 
deviations.
9 CLINICAL MONITORING PLAN
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure:
•that the rights of the participants are protected; 
•that the study is implemented per the approved protocol, Good Clinical Practice and 
standard operating procedures; and, 
•the quality and integrity of study data and data collection methods are maintained.  
Monitoring for this study will be performed by NCI CCR Office of Sponsor and Regulatory 
Oversight (OSRO) Sponsor and Regulatory Oversight Support (SROS) Services contractor. 
Clinical site monitoring activities will be based on OSRO standards, FDA Guidance E6(R2) 
Good Clinical Practice: Integrated Addendum to ICH E6(R1) March 2018, and applicable 
regulatory requirements.
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
79Details of clinical site monitoring will be documented in a Clinical Monitoring Plan (CMP) 
developed by OSRO. CMPs will be protocol-specific, risk-based and tailored to address human 
subject protections and integrity of the study data. OSRO will determine the intensity and 
frequency of monitoring based on several factors, including study type, phase, risk, complexity, 
expected enrollment rate, and any unique attributes of the study and the site. The Sponsor will 
conduct a periodic review of the CMP to confirm the plan's continued appropriateness. A change 
to the protocol, significant or pervasive non-compliance with GCP, or the protocol may trigger 
CMP updates.
OSRO SROS Monitoring visits and related activities will be conducted throughout the life cycle 
of each protocol. The first activity is before the study starts to conduct a Site Assessment Visit 
(SAV) (as warranted), followed by a Site Initiation Visit (SIV), Interim Monitoring Visit(s) 
(IMVs), and a study Close-Out Visit (COV).
Some monitoring activities may be performed remotely, while others will occur at the study 
site(s). Monitoring visit reports will describe visit activities, observations, and associated action 
items or follow-up required for resolution of any issues, discrepancies, or deviations. Monitoring 
reports will be distributed to the study PI, NCI CCR QA, CCR Protocol Support Office, 
coordinating center (if applicable), and the Sponsor regulatory file.
The site Monitor will inform the study team of any deviations observed during monitoring visits. 
If unresolved, the Monitor will request that the site Staff enter the deviations in the CCR 
Protocol Deviation Tracking System (PDTS) for deviation reporting to the Sponsor and as 
applicable per institutional and IRB guidance.
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES
Primary endpoints: 
The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether the use of a combination of Vicineum 
and durvalumab in patients with high grade NMIBC previously treated with BCG is safe and 
tolerable as determined by a 3+3 dose de-escalation trial design.  The primary endpoint will be 
the fraction of patients who have adverse events.
Secondary endpoints:
A secondary endpoint will be to determine if the combination of the two agents can be associated 
with an increase in the disease-free survival (DFS) probability in patients with high grade 
NMIBC previously treated with BCG. If accrual is rapid, an amendment may be made to accrue 
additional patients to evaluate DFS as described in section 10.2.
A secondary objective is whether the combination is associated with changes in a set of immune 
parameters obtained from blood and biopsies. 
A secondary objective is whether the pharmacokinetics of Vicineum can be determined from 
urine samples obtained within the first 7 days of Vicineum treatment.
A secondary objective is whether urinary EpCAM levels correlate with response to therapy.
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
80A secondary objective is to assess PD-L1 expression and PD-1 expressing T cells in paired 
bladder biopsies pre- and post-treatment with durvalumab and Vicineum as a marker of 
response/benefit.  
10.2 SAMPLE SIZE D ETERMINATION
The trial will begin with a 3-patient run-in at the proposed doses of Vicineum and durvalumab 
(1500mg; 30 mg) and if 0/3 or 1/3 patients have a DLT, then the next 3 patients will also be 
treated at the full doses of the agents (1500mg durvalumab; 30 mg Vicineum). If 0/6 or 1/6 has a 
DLT, then the remaining 18 patients will be treated at the full doses if the cumulative fraction of 
patients experiencing a DLT is <1/3. 
If 2 or more patients among 3 to 6 have a DLT at 1500mg durvalumab and 30mg Vicineum, then 
3 patients will be enrolled at the lower dose level (1500mg durvalumab and 20mg Vicineum), 
and if 0/3 or 1/3 patients have a DLT, then the next 3 patients will also be treated at the reduced 
doses of the agents. If 1/6 has a DLT, then the remaining patients will be treated at the lower 
dose level of the agents (1500mg durvalumab and 20mg Vicineum) if the cumulative fraction of 
patients experiencing a DLT is <1/3. 
As the secondary endpoint, all the evaluable patients will have determinations of many immune 
parameters at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The changes in the parameters obtained from 
blood samples will be determined at baseline vs. 3 months, and baseline vs. 6 months. The 
changes in the parameters obtained from biopsies will be obtained from baseline vs. a single 
second biopsy at 6 months. A very large number of parameters may be evaluated, and unless 
more parameters than anticipated are to be evaluated, we will assume that 24 patients will be 
adequate to evaluate changes in these parameters based on the following.  As an illustration, we 
will assume that a total of 25 paired tests will be considered of equal, primary importance. Paired 
results from 24 evaluable patients, including those used in the initial run-in portion who are 
treated at the highest safe dose, will provide 90% power to detect a change from baseline of 1.0 
SD of the change (effect size=1.0) using a two-sided 0.002 significance level paired t-test, to 
allow an overall 0.05 significance level test, applying a very conservative Bonferroni adjustment 
to the set of approximately 25 paired comparisons.  In practice, comparisons of the paired values 
will likely be performed using a Wilcoxon signed rank test instead of a paired t-test, and a 
Hochberg adjustment may be used instead of an overly stringent Bonferroni adjustment. 
If accrual is sufficiently rapid, that is, if the 24 evaluable patients can be accrued within 2.5 
years, then these 24 patients will be included in an expansion cohort, opened by an amendment 
to the study, designed to evaluate DFS, as follows that would allow for the enrollment of an 
additional 23 patients:
It has been estimated from published trials that the 6 month DFS in patients with high grade 
NMIBC previously treated with BCG is approximately 50%, and that it is 35% at 12 months, and 
25% at 18 months. In this expansion cohort, the goal is to determine if use of a combination of 
Vicineum and durvalumab can be potentially associated with a 50% 1-year DFS probability. 
With 47 evaluable patients receiving the proposed therapy, including those in the initial 6 
patients at the intended dose level as well as those in the evaluation of biologic endpoints, 
assuming accrual would take place over approximately 4 years, and that there would be at least 2 
years of additional potential follow-up after the last patient has begun the therapy, there would be 
80% power to determine whether there is a difference between a 35% 1 year DFS and an 
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
81improved 50% 1-year DFS, with a one sided 0.10 alpha level test, using the method of 
Brookmeyer and Crowley.33 In practice, Kaplan-Meier curves and appropriate confidence 
intervals at selected time points will be provided to help interpret results relative to the expected 
results.  
It is anticipated that one patient per month may enroll onto this trial; thus, allowing for 6 to 12 
separate patients as a run-in if needed, and 24 evaluable patients at the intended dose level, 
approximately 24-30 months would be the approximate accrual duration for the secondary 
endpoint based on evaluating biologic correlates. To allow for a small number of invaluable 
patients, the accrual ceiling will be set at 40. If the expansion to evaluate DFS will be 
undertaken, this will be modified by an amendment.
10.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSIS
Modified intention to treat: all patients who receive at least one dose of the two drugs will be 
included in the statistical analyses performed.
10.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES
10.4.1 General Approach
For the toxicity evaluation, the fraction of patients with toxicity will be determined and reported 
at each of the dose levels explored. The immune parameters will be obtained at baseline, 3 
months, and 6 months and for each parameter, the change between baseline and the later time 
points will be calculated and evaluated for the statistical significance of the change. If the 
disease-free survival (DFS) is evaluated, a Kaplan-Meier curve for DFS will be constructed.
10.4.2 Analysis of the Primary Endpoint
All patients will be evaluated for the grades of toxicity identified, and the number of patients will 
DLTs at each dose level will be reported. The MTD will be identified based on being the dose 
level at which 0 or 1 patient in 6 has a DLT. All toxicities will be tabulated for all 24 or more 
patients to be enrolled onto the trial. 
10.4.3 Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints
Efficacy:  A DFS curve will be created using the Kaplan-Meier method based on all patients 
considered to be evaluable based on having received protocol treatment, provided that adequate 
patients are enrolled in order to address this following an amendment to increase accrual.
The response to treatment will be determined for patients who receive treatment; the response 
rate for those patients who are evaluable for response, along with a 95% two-sided confidence 
interval will be reported.
As another secondary endpoint, all the evaluable patients will have determinations of many 
immune parameters at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The changes in the parameters obtained 
from blood samples will be determined at baseline vs. 3 months, and baseline vs. 6 months. The 
changes in the parameters obtained from biopsies will be obtained from baseline vs. a single 
second biopsy at 6 months. As an illustration, we will assume that a total of 25 paired tests will 
be considered of equal, primary importance. Paired results from 24 evaluable patients, including 
those used in the initial run-in portion who are treated at the highest safe dose, will be formed 
and tested for a difference from zero using a two-sided 0.002 significance level paired t-test, to 
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
82allow an overall 0.05 significance level test, applying a very conservative Bonferroni adjustment 
to the set of approximately 25 paired comparisons.  In practice, comparisons of the paired values 
will likely be performed using a Wilcoxon signed rank test instead of a paired t-test, and a 
Hochberg adjustment may be used instead of an overly stringent Bonferroni adjustment. 
Another secondary objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of Vicineum 
obtained by urine samples. This will be a descriptive analysis and will report sample statistics 
such as mean, standard error, median, minimum, maximum and other descriptive measures only.
Urinary EpCAM will be measured and will be compared between patients who have a clinical 
response to therapy vs. those who do not respond. The results will be presented for both response 
categories using descriptive statistics such as mean, standard error, median, minimum, maximum 
and other descriptive measures. Although it is expected to have low power, a comparison of the 
EpCAM levels may be compared between the two response categories using a Wilcoxon rank 
sum test, with the resulting p-value intended to help describe the differences noted.
PD-L1 and PD-1 levels will be obtained at baseline and after treatment with both agents. The 
change in levels will be determined between the two measurements, and these changes will be 
compared between responders and non-responders, as well as between those who respond or 
have SD (clinical benefit=CR+PR+SD) and those with PD. Although it is expected to have low 
power, in each case the comparisons between the two response categories will be made using a 
Wilcoxon rank sum test, with the resulting p-value intended to help describe the differences 
noted.
10.4.4 Safety Analyses
All patients will be evaluated for the grades of toxicity identified, and the number of patients will 
DLTs at each dose level will be reported. The MTD will be identified based on being the dose 
level at which 0 or 1 patient in 6 has a DLT. All toxicities will be tabulated. 
10.4.5 Baseline Descriptive Statistics
Demographic and clinical characteristics of all patients will be reported.
10.4.6 Planned Interim Analyses
None will be performed.
10.4.7 Subgroup Analyses
None will be performed.
10.4.8 Tabulation of Individual Participant Data
None will be provided.
11 COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS 
11.1 COOPERATIVE R ESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT (CRADA) 
This Protocol will be carried out under a collaboration between NCI, Sesen Biotherapeutics Inc. 
and AstraZeneca AB. Sesen Biotherapeutics will provide Vicineum (VB4-845) under NCI

8312 HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTIONS 
12.1 RATIONALE F OR S UBJECT SELECTION
Subjects from all racial/ethnic groups and both sexes are eligible for this study if they meet the 
eligibility criteria.
12.2 PARTICIPATION OF C HILDREN
Individuals under the age of 18 will not be eligible for participation in this study based on the 
fact that patients under 18 are unlikely to have this disease and there are unknown toxicities in 
pediatric patients.
12.3 PARTICIPATION OF S UBJECTS UNABLE TO GIVE C ONSENT
Adults unable to give consent are excluded from enrolling in the protocol.  However, re-consent 
may be necessary and there is a possibility, though unlikely, that subjects could become 
decisionally impaired. For this reason and because there is a prospect of direct benefit from 
research participation (section 12.4), all subjects ≥ age 18 will be offered the opportunity to fill 
in their wishes for research and care, and assign a substitute decision maker on the “NIH 
Advance Directive for Health Care and Medical Research Participation” form so that another 
person can make decisions about their medical care in the event that they become incapacitated 
or cognitively impaired during the course of the study. 
Note: The PI or AI will contact the NIH Ability to Consent Assessment Team (ACAT) for 
evaluation to assess ongoing capacity of the subject and to identify an LAR.
Please see section 12.5.1 for the consent procedure. 
12.4 EVALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS
Patients may benefit from the study as treatment may delay or avoid having the bladder removed. 
All care will be taken to minimize side effects, but they can be unpredictable in nature and 
severity.  Patients will be examined and evaluated prior to enrollment. All evaluations to monitor 
the treatment of patients will be recorded in the patient chart.  If patients suffer any physical 
injury as a result of the participation in this study, immediate medical treatment is available at 
the Clinical Center, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland. 
Although no compensation is available, any injury will be evaluated and treated in keeping with 
the benefits or care to which patients are entitled under applicable regulations. In all publications 
and presentations resulting from this trial, patients’ anonymity will be protected to the maximum 
extent possible. Authorized personnel from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) or other regulatory authorities may have access to research files in 
order to verify that patients’ rights have been safeguarded. In addition, patient names will be 
given to the Central Registration to register and verify patients’ eligibility.
12.4.1 Study Agents Risks
Potential adverse reactions attributable to the administration of the study agents utilized in this 
trial are discussed in sections 14.1.2 and 14.2.2. Additional information is located in the 
investigator brochures.
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
8412.4.2 Research Blood Sampling Risks
Side effects of blood draws include pain and bruising, lightheadedness, and rarely, fainting.
12.4.3 Risks from Bladder Procedures
Risks associated with cystoscopy, TURBT, biopsies and catheterization include:  burning when 
passing urine, blood-tinged urine, bladder infection or the need to urinate frequently following 
the procedures.  The insertion of a catheter into the bladder through the urethra may cause 
discomfort. There is also a small risk that these procedures, particularly cystoscopy, TURBT and 
biopsies, could damage the lining of the bladder or cause a perforation of the bladder.  This could 
lead to urine or drugs leaking out of the bladder causing severe side effects.  
12.4.4 Non-Physical Risks of Genetic Research
•Risk of receiving unwanted information: Anxiety and stress may arise as a result of the 
anticipation of unwanted information regarding disease.   Subjects will be clearly informed 
that the data related to genetic analysis is coded, investigational and will not be shared with 
family members or health care providers.  However, as specified above in Section 5.4.3, 
subjects who have indicated a desire to be informed of these data will be given an 
opportunity.  
•Risk related to possibility that information may be released: This includes the risk that data 
related to genotype or risk for disease tendency or trait can be released to members of the 
public, insurers, employers, or law enforcement agencies.  
•Risk to family or relatives: Family members or relatives may or may not want to be aware of 
familial tendencies or genetic risks of disease which may cause anxiety about possible future 
health problems.    
12.4.5 Radiation Risks
The risk of radiation exposure is expected from up to 1 CT scan a year.  The total estimated 
effective dose for one year is approximately 1.4 rem.
12.4.6 CT Contrast Risks
Itching, hives or headaches are possible risks associated with contrast agents that may be used 
during CT imaging. Symptoms of a more serious allergic reaction include shortness of breath 
and swelling of the throat or other parts of the body. Very rarely, the contrast agents used in CT 
can cause kidney problems for certain patients, such as those with impaired kidney function.
12.4.7 Electrocardiogram Risks
Other than possibly experiencing some minor skin irritation from the electrodes, there are no 
anticipated risks related to complete the electrocardiogram and/or the echocardiogram.
12.5 CONSENT P ROCESS AND D OCUMENTATION
The informed consent document will be provided as a physical or electronic document to the 
participant or consent designee(s) (e.g. legally authorized representative [LAR] if participant is 
an adult unable to consent) for review prior to consenting.  A designated study investigator will 
carefully explain the procedures and tests involved in this study, and the associated risks, 
discomforts and benefits. In order to minimize potential coercion, as much time as is needed to 
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
85review the document will be given, including an opportunity to discuss it with friends, family 
members and/or other advisors, and to ask questions of any designated study investigator. A 
signed informed consent document will be obtained prior to entry onto the study.
The initial consent process as well as re-consent, when required, may take place in person or 
remotely (e.g., via telephone or other NIH approved remote platforms used in compliance with 
policy, including HRPP Policy 303) per discretion of the designated study investigator and with 
the agreement of the participant/consent designee(s).  Whether in person or remote, the privacy 
of the subject will be maintained. Consenting investigators (and participant/consent designee, 
when in person) will be located in a private area (e.g., clinic consult room). When consent is 
conducted remotely, the participant/consent designee will be informed of the private nature of 
the discussion and will be encouraged to relocate to a more private setting if needed.
Consent will be documented with required signatures on the physical document (which includes 
the printout of an electronic document sent to participant) or on the electronic document.  
Signatures on electronic documents are described below.  Note: FDA only regulates electronic 
signatures (i.e., an electronic timestamp is generated at the time of signature) in FDA regulated 
research.  
Manual (non-electronic) signature on electronic document:
When a manual signature on an electronic document is used for the documentation of consent at 
the NIH Clinical Center, this study will use the following to obtain the required signatures:
•Adobe platform (which is not 21 CFR Part 11 compliant); or,  
•iMedConsent platform (which is 21 CFR Part 11 compliant)
During the consent process, participants and investigators will view individual copies of the 
approved consent document on screens at their respective locations (if remote consent); the same 
screen may be used when in the same location but is not required.  
Both the investigator and the participant will sign the document using a finger, stylus or mouse. 
Note: Refer to the CCR SOP PM-2, Obtaining and Documenting the Informed Consent Process 
for additional information (e.g., verification of participant identity when obtaining consent 
remotely) found https://nih.sharepoint.com/sites/NCI-CCR-OCD-

12.5.1 Consent Process for Adults Who Lack Capacity to Consent to Research 
Participation
For participants addressed in section 12.3, an LAR will be identified consistent with Policy 403 
and informed consent obtained from the LAR, as described in section 12.5. 
13 REGULATORY AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 
13.1 STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient 
reasonable cause.  Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or 
termination, will be provided by the suspending or terminating party to study participants, 
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
86investigator, funding agency, the Investigational New Drug (IND) sponsor and regulatory 
authorities.  If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal Investigator (PI) 
will promptly inform study participants, the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and sponsor and 
will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension.  Study participants will be 
contacted, as applicable, and be informed of changes to study visit schedule.
 Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:
•Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants
•Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stopping   
•Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements
•Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable
•Determination that the primary endpoint has been met
•Determination of futility
Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are 
addressed, and satisfy the sponsor, IRB and as applicable, Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
13.2 QUALITY A SSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL
The clinical site will perform internal quality management of study conduct, data and biological 
specimen collection, documentation and completion.  An individualized quality management 
plan will be developed to describe a site’s quality management.
Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and 
data QC checks that will be run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data 
anomalies will be communicated to the site(s) for clarification/resolution.
Following written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the monitors will verify that the 
clinical trial is conducted and data are generated and biological specimens are collected, 
documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, International Council for 
Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), and applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., 
Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)). 
The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source data/documents, 
and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by the sponsor, and inspection by local 
and regulatory authorities.
13.3 CONFLICT OF INTEREST P OLICY
The independence of this study from any actual or perceived influence, such as by the 
pharmaceutical industry, is critical.  Therefore, any actual conflict of interest of persons who 
have a role in the design, conduct, analysis, publication, or any aspect of this trial will be 
disclosed and managed. Furthermore, persons who have a perceived conflict of interest will be 
required to have such conflicts managed in a way that is appropriate to their participation in the 
design and conduct of this trial.  The study leadership in conjunction with the NIH has 
established policies and procedures for all study group members to disclose all conflicts of 
interest and will establish a mechanism for the management of all reported dualities of interest.

8713.4 CONFIDENTIALITY AND P RIVACY
Participant confidentiality and privacy is strictly held in trust by the participating investigators, 
their staff, and the sponsor(s). This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological 
samples and genetic tests in addition to the clinical information relating to participants. 
Therefore, the study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be 
held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any 
unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor. 
All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible.
The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the sponsor, representatives of the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB), and/or regulatory agencies may inspect all documents and 
records required to be maintained by the investigator, including but not limited to, medical 
records (office, clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy records for the participants in this study. The 
clinical study site will permit access to such records.
The study participant’s contact information will be securely stored at the clinical site for internal 
use during the study. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure 
location for as long a period as dictated by the reviewing IRB, Institutional policies, or sponsor 
requirements.
Study participant research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific 
reporting, will be stored at the NCI CCR. This will not include the participant’s contact or 
identifying information. Rather, individual participants and their research data will be identified 
by a unique study identification number. The study data entry and study management systems 
used by the clinical site and by NCI CCR research staff will be secured and password protected. 
At the end of the study, all study databases will be archived at the NIH.
To further protect the privacy of study participants, a Certificate of Confidentiality has been 
issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  This certificate protects identifiable research 
information from forced disclosure. It allows the investigator and others who have access to

14.1.2.1 Other Potential Risks for Durvalumab Monotherapy and the Durvalumab Plus 
Tremelimumab Combination
Hypersensitivity Reactions and Anaphylaxis
Hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis are considered potential risks for durvalumab 
monotherapy and the durvalumab + tremelimumab combination. In the durvalumab monotherapy 
pooled dataset (N=3006), hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions (grouped term including 
Abbreviated Title: Durvalumab & Vicineum for NMIBC
Version Date: 05/22/2025
92reported PTs of hypersensitivity, drug hypersensitivity, drug eruption, anaphylactic shock, and 
anaphylactic reaction), were uncommonly reported in 28 patients (0.9%); 5 patients had Grade 3 
or 4 events. Of the 28 patients, 16 patients had events of drug hypersensitivity (1 patient had a 
Grade 4 event), 5 patients had events of drug eruption (2 patients had Grade 3 events), 4 patients 
had events of hypersensitivity (Grade 1 or 2 events), 3 patients had events of anaphylactic 
reaction (1 patient had a Grade 4 event), and 1 patient had a Grade 2 event of anaphylactic shock.
Subcutaneous Injection Site Reaction
Subcutaneous injection site reactions can occur via immune or non-immune mechanisms.
A potential immunogenic mechanism could be due to antigen presentation and processing by 
lymph node and migratory cutaneous dendritic cells in the subcutaneous space. Non-immune 
mechanisms by which injection site reactions may arise can be related to biophysical 
characteristics of the drug and preservative/stabilizing agents. Patients should be closely 
monitored for signs and symptoms of subcutaneous injection site reactions including, but not 
limited to pain, blistering, induration, burning, and erythema at the site of injection.
Immunogenicity
As with the administration of any therapeutic protein, there is a potential for an immune 
response. The incidence of durvalumab ADA-positive patients in clinical studies is low. Overall, 
of the 4045 patients who were treated with durvalumab monotherapy 10 mg/kg Q2W, 20 mg/kg 
Q4W, or 1500 mg Q4W, 3069 patients were evaluable for the presence of ADAs, of which 6.2% 
(191/3069) patients were ADA-positive at any visit and 2.7% (84/3069) patients were treatment-
emergent ADA-positive. Neutralising antibodies against durvalumab were detected in 0.5% 
(16/3069) patients. The presence of ADAs did not have a clinically relevant effect on PK. The 
presence of durvalumab ADA did not have an influence on durvalumab exposure metric, and 
there was no apparent effect on the safety of durvalumab.
Other Rare or Less Frequent Immune-mediated Adverse Events
Events with an inflammatory or immune mediated mechanism could occur in nearly all organs. 
Potential risks with an immune-mediated aetiology that are rare or less frequent include, but are 
not limited to, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, pericarditis, sarcoidosis, uveitis, cholangitis sclerosing, 
immune-mediated cystitis and other events involving the eye (eg, keratitis and optic neuritis), 
skin (eg, scleroderma and vitiligo), haematological (eg, hemolytic anaemia and immune-
mediated neutropenia), rheumatological events (polymyalgia rheumatica and autoimmune 
arthritis), vasculitis, non-infectious meningitis and psoriasis.

10116.2 APPENDIX B: DURVALUMAB DOSE CALCULATIONS
Durvalumab Dosing
The durvalumab dosing should be done depending on subject weight (if subject is < 30kg)):
1. Cohort dose: X mg/kg
2. Subject weight: Y kg
3. Dose for subject: XY mg = X (mg/kg) × Y (kg)
4. Dose to be added into infusion bag: 
Dose (mL) = XY mg / 50 (mg/mL) 
where 50 mg/mL is durvalumab nominal concentration 
The corresponding volume of durvalumab should be rounded to the nearest tenth mL (0.1 mL). 
Dose adjustments for each cycle only needed for greater than 10% change in weight.
5. The theoretical number of vials required for dose preparation is the next greatest whole 
number of vials from the following formula:
Number of vials = Dose (mL) / 10 (mL/vial)
Example: 
1. Cohort dose: 10 mg/kg
2. Subject weight: 30 kg
3. Dose for subject: 300 mg = 10 (mg/kg) × 30 (kg)
4. Dose to be added into infusion bag: 
Dose (mL) = 300 mg / 50 (mg/mL) = 6.0 mL
5. The theoretical number of vials required for dose preparation: 
Number of vials = 6.0 (mL) / 10.0 (mL/vial) = 1 vials
16.3 APPENDIX C: DURVALUMAB DOSING MODIFICATION AND TOXICITY MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES
These guidelines are standardized for durvalumab trials.  However, these guidelines are superseded and should be superceded by any 
protocol-specific DLTs as as specified in section 3.1.1.  This is specifically the case for toxicities such as hyperbilirubinemia, 
encephalopathy, neurotoxicity, peripheral neuromotor syndromes, and transaminase elevation as well as others. 
General Considerations Regarding Immune-Mediated Reactions
These guidelines are provided as a recommendation to support investigators in the management of potential immune-mediated adverse events (imAEs). 
Immune-mediated events can occur in nearly any organ or tissue, therefore, these guidelines may not include all the possible immune-mediated reactions. Investigators are 
advised to take into consideration the appropriate practice guidelines and other society guidelines (e.g., National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), European 
Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO)) in the management of these events.  Refer to the section of the table titled “Other -Immune-Mediated Reactions” for general 
guidance on imAEs not noted in the “Specific Immune-Mediated Reactions” section.
Early identification and management of imAEs is essential to ensure safe use of the study drug.  Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical 
manifestations of underlying imAEs. Patients with suspected imAEs  should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any alternative etiologies (e.g., disease progression, 
concomitant medications, infections). In the absence of a clear alternative etiology, all such events should be managed as if they were immune-mediated.  Institute medical 
management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. In general, withhold study drug/study regimen  for severe (Grade 3) imAEs. Permanently discontinue 
study drug/study regimen for life-threatening (Grade 4) imAEs, recurrent severe (Grade 3) imAEs that require systemic immunosuppressive treatment, or an inability to 
reduce corticosteroid dose to 10 mg or less of prednisone or equivalent per day within 12 weeks of initiating corticosteroids. 
Based on the severity of the imAE, durvalumab and/or tremelimumab should be withheld and corticosteroids administered. Upon improvement to Grade ≤ 1, corticosteroid 
should be tapered over ≥ 28 days.  More potent immunosuppressive agents should be considered for events not responding to systemic steroids. Alternative 
immunosuppressive agents not listed in this guideline may be considered at the discretion of the investigator based on clinical practice and relevant guidelines. With long-
term steroid and other immunosuppressive use, consider the need for glucose monitoring.
Dose modifications of study drug/study regimen should be based on severity of treatment-emergent toxicities graded per NCI CTCAE version in the applicable study 
protocol.
Considerations for Prophylaxis for Long Term use of Steroids for Patients Receiving Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Immunotherapy
• Infection Prophylaxis: Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), antifungal and Herpes Zoster reactivation
• Gastritis: Consider prophylaxis for patients at high risk of gastritis (e.g. NSAID use, anticoagulation) when the patient is taking steroid therapy
• Osteoporosis: Consider measures for prevention and mitigation of osteoporosis .

Pediatric Considerations Regarding Immune-Mediated Reactions
Dose Modifications Toxicity Management
The criteria for permanent discontinuation of study drug/study regimen based on 
CTCAE grade/severity is the same for pediatric patients as it is for adult patients, 
as well as to permanently discontinue study drug/study regimen if unable to reduce 
corticosteroid ≤ a dose equivalent to that required for corticosteroid replacement 
therapy within 12 weeks of initiating corticosteroids. − All recommendations for specialist consultation should occur with a 
pediatric specialist in the specialty recommended.
− The recommendations for steroid dosing (i.e., mg/kg/day) provided for adult 
patients should also be used for pediatric patients.
− The recommendations for intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and 
plasmapheresis use provided for adult patients may be considered for 
pediatric patients.
− The infliximab 5 mg/kg IV one time dose recommended for adults is the 
same as recommended for pediatric patients ≥ 6 years old. For subsequent 
dosing and dosing in children < 6 years old, consult a pediatric specialist.
− For pediatric dosing of mycophenolate mofetil, consult a pediatric specialist.
− With long-term steroid and other immunosuppressive use, consider need for 
PJP prophylaxis, gastrointestinal protection, and glucose monitoring.

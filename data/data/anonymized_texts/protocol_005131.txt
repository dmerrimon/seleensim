 Introduction  
The dramatic evolution of contemporary plastic surgery has brought liposuction to 
become the second -most commonly performed elective aesthetic procedure 
performed in the USA  1.  In this minimally invasive procedure, excess fat deposits are 
removed, and either discarded or exploited in subsequent lipo -sculpturing procedures 
aiming to  restore the normal appearance of a range of body regions suffering from 
surgical, accidental or traumatic tissue loss, or disease - or aging -related cosmetic 
defects 2.  Autologous fat tissue has become a popular filling material, particularly in 
the face and hands  3–5, largely due to its circumvention of complications associated 
with allogenic fillers and implants, high and simple accessibility, cost-effectiveness and 
host -compatibility  6,7. Yet, relatively high resorption rates have been reported, 
averaging 55% within one year of transplantation, with sample composition, purity 
and viable ad ipocyte content flagged as key determinants of implanted fat longevity  
8–14.   
The most commonly used liposuction te chniques rely on mechanical, thermal, 
ultrasonic or hydric forces to harvest the desired sample.  Laser -assisted liposuction 
(LAL) induces temperature elevations that lead to liquefication of the adipose tissue 
and eventual adipocytolysis, enabling removal  of larger volumes of fat than traditional 
liposuction techniques 15.  In addition, the thermal effect elicits collagen deposition 
and rearrangement, coagulation of vasculature, skin contraction and reduced laxity.  
Multiple wavelengths can be used to provide for selective photothermolysis, each 
providing distinct ratios of penetration and scatter, fat absorption, and tissue 
tightening.  In general, high absorption lasers (1370, 1440 and 1470 nm) generate 
localized thermal damage, while the lower absorption lasers (980, 1064 and 1320 nm) 
lead to more diffuse tissue response 16. Overall, LAL is considered safe and tolerable, 
and has been associated with a lower touch -up rate and improved precision as 
compared to conventional liposuctioning techniques  17. 
Alma Surgical’s LipoLife integrates a 1470 nm diode laser, emitting light preferentially 
absorbed by water, rendering it ideal for gentle fat tissue collection, with reduced risk 
of burning and scarring. In addition, its radially emitting fiber reduces emi ssion 
intensity and subsequently, the risk of burns and internal scarring. Abdominal fat 
samples harvested with the LipoLife device were more homogenous, demonstrated 
higher viable adipocyte counts and contained fewer fibrous and blood contaminants 
as comp ared to those collected via mechanical liposuctioning 18. These virtues are 
expected to yield more long -lasting clinical outcomes, thereby reducing the need for 
correction or repeat procedures. When deploying the device for Teimourian grades I -

 II arm contouring in a single -session laser lipolysi s procedure in 45 patients, Leclere 
and colleagues  reported an average 4.7 -5.5 cm decrease in arm circumference 
(p<0.01), with slightly better results for grades IIa and IIb patients.  Similarly, the 
average skin pinch decreased by 0.7 cm for grade I patie nts and 2.1 cm and 2.9 cm for 
the grade IIa and IIb patients, respectively.   Patient -evaluated pain was minimal, and 
mean downtime was shorter than one day.  Complications included prolonged edema 
in 11 patients  19. The same gr oup reported on a 26.6 -degree s reduction in 
cervicomental angle in patients presenting Rohrich type IV aging neck undergoing a 
single LipoLife treatment session; 2/10 patients requested complementary surgery 6 
months following LAL 20.  When deployed to address gynecomastia, Trelles et al.  
(2013) reported no complications, skin burns, edema or areolar congestion. In 
addition, nipple sensitivity was not compromised.  Mean chest and areola diameter 
reductions 6 months posttreatment, were 11.93 cm and 1 .80 cm, respectively 
(p<0.05). A significant degree of skin retraction was observed among all patients and 
patients resu med their normal activities within three days of surgery  21. 
The present multi -center, open -label, p rospective study aims to assess the safety and 
efficacy of LipoLife, laser -assisted liposuction of abdominal and outer thigh fat 
samples, as well as the efficacy of facial autologous fat grafting with  the harvested fat 
tissue. Contouring and volumetric enh ancement outcomes will be assessed up to 6 
months following the procedure.

 Approximately 20 –30 minutes should be allowed to enable an adequate diffusion of 
the tumescent solution and provide effective vasoconstriction.  
Liposuction with t he LipoLifeTM system involves simultaneous  work of laser and 
suction . Alma 1470 diode laser is  used in Continuous Wave (CW) emission mode,  Pulse 
mode and Repeat mode. Power settings are recommended to be selected as a 
function of the  liposuction area : 10-13W (chin, arms and knees), 13W (abdomen, 
back), and 15W  (thighs, hips and buttocks). The  laser  energy is convey ed into the fat 
layer using a 3 mm cannula which  incorporates a 4 00 or 600 μm optical single -use fiber. 
The suction tube is connected directly to the  cannula so laser and suction will work 
simultaneously.  
The LipoLifeTM system  is designed to  be operated only by licensed medical  
practitioners properly trained in its handling and use. Personnel operating the  device 
must read the operator's manual .

6.3 Subject Withdrawal and Replacement  
The p articipating subjects may withdraw their consent to participate in the study at 
any time during the study without prejudice as written in the informed consent form. 
The reason should be clearly stated in the subjects' medical records. Only the data, 
collec ted up to the point of consent withdrawal, will be analysed by the Sponsor.  
The investigator may withdraw a subject if, in his clinical judgment, it is in the best 
interest of the subject or if the subject cannot comply with the protocol or if the 
subject  is unable to adhere to appointments. In the event that a subject drops out of 
the study or is withdrawn from the study, before the primary end point (3 month s FU 
visit), the Termination CRF form should be completed and the subject should be 
replaced by the investigator , with the sponsor's approval.  
The site s will be required to complete treatment and follow -ups for 20 subjects  and 
therefore should enrol l 10% more subjects to account for any subject dropouts or 
subjects that will be lost to follow -up duri ng the course of at least 6 months . 
Reasonable effort should be made to contact any subject lost to follow  up during the 
course of the study in order to complete assessments and retrieve any outstanding 
data. The records of subjects who terminate prior to completing the study will be 
retained and the reason for termination will be documented. The sponsor must be 
notified of all withdrawals. Subject  that have a complete data for the primary endpoint

 8.5 Fat vitality assessment  
Fat vitality assessment will be optional.  
Ten (10) samples of the harvested fat, from 10 subjects at Assaf Harofeh MC, will be 
transported to the laboratory, within 4 hours.  
Cell viability assessment will  be performed using trypan blue exclusion assay.  
 Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting 
the criteria and definition of an adverse event (AE) or a serious ad verse event (SAE) as 
provided in this protocol. During the study, when there is a safety evaluation, the 
investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting AEs and SAEs, as detailed in 
this section of the protocol . All adverse events reported bet ween consent and final 
follow -up will be recorded in the case report form  (CRF).  
9.1 Definition of an Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a partici pant or clinical investigation p articipant, 
temporarily associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated 
with the use of a me dicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal 
product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce benefits 
(i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse.  
9.2 Anticipated Outcome Related Adverse Events  
Anticipated related AE for liposuction procedure may include;  local pain,  hematoma, 
contour deformities, infection, local fibrosis of scars or systemic side effects such as 
electrolyte disorders.  
Anticipated related AE for facial fat grafting procedure may  include ; infection, 
ecchymosis, fat necrosis or injury of adjacent tissue.  
Any anticipated AE that occurs at any time during or after the use of the study device 
must be reported by the Investigator to Alma Lasers Ltd. If the anticipated AE, in the 
Protocol Number: ALM -Lipo-002, V. 2.1  
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________________________  
Page 31 of 42 
CON FIDENTIAL  
 opinio n of Alma Lasers or the Investigator, is likely to affect the safety of the subjects 
or the conduct of the study, the IRB/ Helsinki/ other ethic committee will be notified 
of the effect within 10 working days after Alma Lasers first receives notice of it.  
9.3 Unanticipated  Outcome Related Adverse Events  
An unanticipated adverse device effect as defined by the Federal Regulations [21 CFR 
812.3(s)] is “any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening 
problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or 
death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or 
any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the 
rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.” From a practical perspective, an unanticipated 
adverse device effect means a serious adverse event that is not listed in the device 
labelling , or the frequency or severity is greater than reported in the device labelling .  
9.4 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
a) Results  in death  
b) Is life threatening  
c) Requires  hospitalization  or prolongation of an existing hospitalization . 
Hospitalization  for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.  
d) Results  in disability/incapacity  
e) Is a congenital abnormality / birth defect.  
f) Any event deemed by the investigator as being a significant medical event.  
9.5 Recording of AEs and SAEs  
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g. hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostic reports) 
relative to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information 
regarding an AE/SAE in to the CRF. It is not acceptable for the investigator to send 
photocopies of the subject ’s medical records to Alma Lasers Ltd. in lieu of completion 
of the appropriate AE/SAE CRF pages. Howev er, there may be instances when copies 
of medical records for certain cases are requested by Alma Lasers Ltd. In this instance, 
all subject identifiers will be blinded on the copies of the medical records prior to 
submission to Alma Lasers Ltd.

 For each a dverse event, start and stop dates, action taken, outcome, intensity  and 
relationship to study product (causality)  must be documented. If an AE changes in 
frequency or intensity during a study, a new entry of the event must be made in the 
CRF.  
The investig ator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In the absence of a diagnosis, the 
individual signs/symptoms should be documented.  All details of any treatments 
initiated due to the adver se event should be recorded in the subject ’s notes and the 
CRF.  
9.6 Prompt Reporting of SAEs to Alma Lasers Ltd.  
Once an investigator becomes aware that an SAE has occurred in a study subject , 
he/she will immediately notify the sponsor by contacting the study  monitor via 
telephone to notify him/her of the event. The SAE form must be completed as 
thoroughly as possible with all available details of the event, signed by the 
investigator, and faxed within 24 hours of first becoming aware of the event  to the 
follo wing person:  
Ronit Lipson  
Alma Lasers Ltd.  
14 Halamish Street,  POB 3021  
Caesarea Industrial Park  
Caesarea, Israel 38900  
Phone: 972 -52-2337768  
Fax: +972 -4-627-5368  
If the investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he/she will not wait 
to receive additional information before notifying the study monitor of the event and 
completing the form. The form will be updated when additional information is 
rece ived.  
The investigator must also notify the Reviewing  IRB/ Helsinki/ other ethic  Committee 
of any SAEs according to the guidelines of the Ethics Committee.  
9.7 Evaluating AEs and SAEs  
9.7.1 Assessment of Intensity  
The investigator will make an assessment of intens ity for each AE and SAE reported 
during the study. The assessment will be based on the investigator’s clinical 
Protocol Number: ALM -Lipo-002, V. 2.1

 judgement. The intensity of each AE and SAE recorded in the CRF should be assigned 
to one of the following categories:  
Mild:  An event that is eas ily tolerated by the subject , causing minimal discomfort and 
not interfering with everyday activities.  
Moderate:  An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities.  
Severe:  An event which is incapacitating and prevents normal everyday activities.  
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severity is a 
category utilised for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as s evere. An event is defined as “serious” when it meets one of the pre -
defined outcomes as described in Section “Definition of an SAE”.  
9.7.2 Assessment of Causality  
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between investigational device  
and the oc currence of each AE/SAE. The investigator will use clinical judgment to 
determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as natural history of the 
underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal 
relationship of the event to the investigational product will be considered and 
investigated. The investigator will also consult the IB and/or device information in the 
determination of his/her assessment.  
The causal relationship to the study product assessed by the Investigator (o r medically 
qualified delegate) should be assessed using the following classifications:  
Not Related  In the Investigator’s opinion, there is not a causal relationship between 
the study product and the adverse event.  
Unlikely  The temporal association between  the adverse event and study 
product is such that the study product is not likely to have any 
reasonable association with the adverse event.  
Possible  The adverse event could  have been caused by the study p articipant’s 
clinical state or the study product.  
Probable  The adverse event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the 
time of study product administration, abates upon discontinuation of

 the study product and cannot be reasonably explained by the know n 
characteristics of the study p articipant’s cli nical state.  
Definitely  The adverse event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the 
time of study product administration or reappears when study product 
is reintroduced.  
 Statistical Analysis  
10.1 General Considerations  
When  statistical tests are performed , they will be two -sided. The required significance 
level of findings will be equal to or lower than 5%. Where confidence limits are 
appropriate, the confidence level will be 95%.  
Baseline values are defined as the last valid value prior to the surgery.  
All statistical analyses of safety and performance measures will be descriptive in 
nature. Continuous variables will be summarized by a mean, standard deviation, 
minimum, median and maximum, and categorical variables by a count and 
percentage. Confidence int ervals will be provided where relevant.  
10.2 Disposition of Subject  
The numbers of subjects  who were enrolled and completed each visit of the study will 
be provided, as well as the reasons for all enrol lment  discontinuations, grouped by 
major reason (e.g., lost to follow -up, adverse event, poor compliance). A list of 
discontinued subjects , protocol deviations, and subject  excluded from the efficacy 
analysis will be provided as well.  
10.3 Safety Analysis  
A detailed  list of all adverse events will be presented. The adverse event rate and 
incidence will be compiled with respect to frequency, nature, seriousness of the event, 
severity of the event, and relationship to the study device. In addition, listings of all 
safety measures will be produced.  
10.4 Interim Analysis  
An interim report to analyse  safety and efficacy will be performed at 3 months Follow -
Up.

 Administrative Procedures  
11.1 Investigator Responsibility  
Except where the Principal Investigator’s signature is specifically required, it is 
understood that the term ‘Investigator’ as used in this Protocol and on the CRFs refers 
to the Principal Investigator or an appropriately qualified member of the staff that the 
Principal Investigator designates to perform speci fied duties of the Protocol.  The 
Principal Investigator is ultimately responsible for the conduct of all aspects of the 
study.  
Each Investigator will comply with the local regulations regarding clinical trials and the 
Investigator responsibilities outlin ed in the ICH GCP guidelines.  
11.2 Ethic committee Approval  
The Protocol will be  submitted for approval to the R eviewing  IRB/ Helsinki/ other ethic  
committee , and written approval obtained, before study subjects are enrolled.  The 
Investigators will receive all  the documentation needed for submitting the present 
Protocol to the Ethics Committee. A copy of the respective approval letters will be 
transmitted to the Study Monitor before starting the study.  The composition of the 
Ethics Committee must also be provi ded to the Study Monitor.  If approval is 
suspended or terminated by the Reviewing Ethics Committee, the Investigator will 
notify the Study Monitor immediately.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to report study progress to the Reviewing 
Ethics C ommittee as required or at intervals not greater than one year.  
The Principal Investigator, or his/her nominee, will be responsible for reporting any 
serious adverse events to the Ethics Committee as soon as possible, and in accordance 
with the local guide lines.  
11.3 Informed Consent  
Before recruitment and enrol lment into the study, each prospective candidate will be 
given a full explanation of the nature and purposes of the study, and a copy of the 
Informed Consent Form to review. Once the essential study inf ormation has been 
provided, and the Investigator is assured that each potential subject understands the 
implications of participating in the study, the subjects will be asked to give consent to 
participate in the study by signing the informed consent form.  The consent forms shall 
Protocol Number: ALM -Lipo-002, V. 2.1  
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________________________  
Page 36 of 42 
CON FIDENTIAL  
 be signed and dated by the appropriate parties.  A notation that written informed 
consent has been obtained will be made on the participant’s CRF.  The completed 
consent forms will be retained by the Investigator and a copy of thes e will be provided 
by the Investigator to the participant.  
11.4 Case Report Forms (CRF)  
A Case Report Form (CRF) will be completed for each study subject summarising all 
clinical screening and study data. Subjects will only be referred to in the CRF by their 
subject number and initials in order to retain their confidentiality.  
The Investigator is responsible for completely and accurately recording study data in 
the appropriate sections of the CRFs provided by Alma lasers. The CRFs must be signed 
by the Investiga tor or by his/her authorized person as designated in the Signature 
Authorization Log.  
The completed original CRF’s are to be sent to the Sponsor as soon as practical after 
completion and review.  A copy of each completed CRF is to be retained by the 
Invest igator for a period of time as determined by local regulations.  
11.5 Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
The task of the Study Monitor is to guarantee the best conduct of the study through 
frequent contacts by phone and in person with the responsible Investigator,  in 
accordance with the Monitor’s Standard Operating Procedures, with the purpose of 
facilitating the work and fulfilling the objectives of the study.  The Monitor is 
responsible for monitoring adherence to the Protocol and completion of the CRF, and 
for t he relationship between the Investigator and Alma Lasers Ltd. 
The organisation, monitoring, supply of study materials and quality assurance of the 
present clinical study is the responsibility of Alma Lasers Ltd. or its designee.  
In order to ensure the accuracy of data, direct access to source documents by the 
representatives of both the Study Monitor and regulatory authorities is mandatory.  
Anonymity of the subject will be maintained at all times.  Alma Lasers Ltd. reserves 
the r ight to terminate the study for refusal of the Investigator/Institution to supply 
source documentation of work performed in the study.  
Protocol Number: ALM -Lipo-002, V. 2.1

 11.6 Financial Aspects  
The conduct of the study is subject to a Financial Agreement between Alma Lasers Ltd. 
and the Investiga tor or Institution.  
11.7 Device Use/Accountability  
Use and storage  of LipoLifeTM system and accessories will be performed according to 
the Operation Manual. All received used and unused LipoLifeTM system components 
will be documented on the accountability form.   
11.8 Protocol Amendments  
Neither the Investigator nor Alma Lasers Ltd. will modify the Protocol without first 
obtaining the concurrence of the other in writing.  Protocol modifications that impact 
on participant safety or the validity of th e study will be ap proved by the Ethics 
Committee.  
No changes (amendments) to the Protocol may be implemented without prior 
approval from the Sponsor and the Reviewing Ethics Committee.  If a Protocol 
amendment requires changes to the Informed Consent Form, the revised Infor med 
Consent Form, prepared by the Investigator, must be approved by the Reviewing  
Ethics Committee.  
Once the final Protocol has been issued and signed by the Investigator and the 
authorised signatories, it shall not be informally altered.  Protocol amendme nts are 
alterations to a legal document and have the same legal status.  Therefore, they must 
pass through appropriate steps before being implemented.  In general, any important 
change that theoretically increases risk to participants constitutes an amendm ent.  
Minor changes are administrative changes and need documentation without 
approval.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to submit the amendment to the Reviewing 
Ethics Committee for their approval; written approval should be obtained and a cop y 
provided to the Sponsor.  The Sponsor is responsible for determining whether or not 
the local regulatory authority must be notified of the Protocol change.  Completed and 
signed Protocol amendments will be circulated to all those who were on the 
circulat ion list for the original Protocol.  
Protocol Number: ALM -Lipo-002, V. 2.1  
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________________________  
Page 38 of 42 
CON FIDENTIAL  
 The original signed copy of amendments will be kept in the Study File with the original 
Protocol.  It should be noted that where an amendment to the Protocol substantially 
alters the study design or the potential risks t o the participants, each participant’s 
consent to continue participation should be obtained.  
11.9 Protocol Compliance  
The instructions and procedures specified in this Protocol require diligent attention to 
their execution.  Should there be questions or conside ration of deviation from the 
Protocol, clarification will be sought from the Study Monitor. Any participant treated 
in a manner that deviates from the Protocol, or who is admitted into the study but is 
not qualified according to the Protocol as amended by Alma Lasers Ltd. and the 
Investigator, may be ineligible for analysis and thereby compromise the study.  
Only when an emergency occurs that requires a departure from the Protocol for an 
individual will there be such a departure. The nature and reasons for the Protocol 
violation/deviation shall be recorded in the CRF and the investigator should notify the 
spon sor and Ethics Committee as soon as possible.  
11.10  Archives: Retention of Study Records  
All source documents, CRFs and trial documentation will be kept by the Investigator 
for the appropriate retention period as stipulated by local regulations and ICH -GCP.  
11.11  Early Termination of the Study  
The study may be terminated prematurely by the principal investigator or his/her 
designee and the sponsor if:  
 The number and/or severity of adverse events justify discontinuation of the study  
 New data become available which raise  concern about the safety of the study 
device, so that continuation might cause unacceptable risks to subjects.  
In addition, Alma Lasers Ltd. reserves the right to discontinue the trial prior to 
inclusion of the intended number of participants, but intends  only to exercise this right 
for valid scientific or administrative reasons.  
After such a decision, the Investigator must contact all participating subjects, and 
written notification must be sent to the Reviewing Ethics Committee and relevant 
Regulatory A uthorities.

 11.12  Reporting Requirements  
The investigator must promptly report to Alma lasers any withdrawal of IRB/ 
Helsinki /other ethic committee approval at the site. Additional reporting 
requirements include:  
 Notify Alma Lasers’ designee and to the ethic committee a report of any serious 
adverse device effect, whether anticipated or unanticipated, that occurs during 
the study as soon as possible, but in no event later than 10  working days after the 
investigator first learns of the effect. This report is to  include a description of the 
effect, subsequent treatments, clinical outcomes, and outcome diagnoses.  If the 
site personnel are not sure whether an event meets these criteria they should call 
the clinical monitor.  
 Notify Alma Lasers or Alma Lasers' desig nee and the ethic committee immediately 
(within 24 hours) if an emergency situation arises in which the subsequent 
treatment, in the best interests of the subject, requires a deviation from the 
protocol. This should be followed with written confirmation th at describes the 
emergency action and outcomes, to Alma Lasers and the ethic committee within 
5 working days.  
 Report to the ethic committee and Alma Lasers, within 5 working days, the use of 
the study device without signed informed consent from the subject . 
 Report adverse events in accordance with 21 CFR 803.  
 Submit regular progress reports to the approval committee and Alma Lasers or 
Alma Lasers’ designee, as requested by the investigators or the ethic committee.  
 Submitting a final report on the study to t he ethic committee and Alma Lasers or 
Alma Lasers’ designee within 3  months after termination or completion of the 
study.

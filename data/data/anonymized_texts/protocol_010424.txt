Title:  A Problem  Solving  Intervention  for Hospice  Caregivers 
PI: G. Demiris  
Date of Document: December 20, 2022  
 
Study Protocol  and Data  Analysis  
Design  
The study  was designed  as a randomized  clinical  trial with four  groups.  Hospice caregivers  were 
randomly assigned to either to a group receiving standard hospice care with the addition of the 
PISCES intervention delivered face to face (Group 1) or a group receiving standard hospice  
care with the additio n of the PISCES intervention delivered in a hybrid format (first session in 
person, remaining sessions via video) (Group 2) or a group receiving standard hospice care  
with the addition of the PISCES plus intervention delivered in a hybrid format (Group 3) o r a 
group receiving standard hospice care with the addition of the PISCES plus intervention 
delivered entirely online (Group 4).  
 
Setting  and Participants  
We partnered with Penn Homecare and Hospice Services. Penn Homecare and Hospice 
Services is an agency (part of the Penn Medicine system) that is Medicare and Medicaid - 
certified,  accredited  by the Joint  Commission,  licensed  in the Commonwealth  of Pennsylvania.  It 
serves patients and families in Philadelphia, Chester, Delaware, Bucks and Montgomery 
counties  mostly (total number of counties serves is 20) and is experiencing a growth over the 
years (20% increase in admissions over the past 5 years). The hospice component of the 
agency had a total number of 2,970 home admissions, an average daily census of 380 and an 
average length of service (LOS) of 68 days in 2016  
Inclusion  criteria  for caregivers  were  the following:  
• enrolled  as a family/informal  caregiver  of a hospice  patient  
• 18 years  or older  
• with access  to a standard  phone line  or Internet  and computer  access  at home  
• without functional  hearing  loss or with a hearing aid that  allows  the participant to conduct 
telephone conversations as assessed by the research staff (by questioning and 
observing the caregiver)  
• no or only mild cognitive impairment —mental status will be assessed using the Short 
Portable  Mental  Status  Questionnaire;i individuals  with a  score  of less  than seven  (i.e., 
more than three errors) will be excluded, similar to other studies involving this 
instrument.  
• speak  and read  English,  with at least  a 6th-grade  education  
 
Enrollment  
The hospice admissions  staff presented the research opportunity to caregivers  upon admission, 
asking them if  they agree  to be contacted  by the  research staff to find  out more  about  the study. 
The admissions staff then forwarded contact information for caregivers willing to learn more 
about the study to the research team if they fulfilled  the eligibility criteria. The interventionist 
called and scheduled the initial visit. The interventionist visited the caregiver, discussed the 
project,  obtained informed consent from the caregiver, and documented demographic  data. The 
interventionist open ed a numbered sealed envelope, prepared by the team in advance, which 
assigned caregivers to  one of the three  groups. This approach ensured  that consent is  obtained 
prior to group  assignment  and caregivers  consent  to participate in  the study, regardless  of group 
assignment. Randomization was stratified by site.  Furthermore, we followed a block 
randomization approach to ensure that treatment groups are not imbalanced with respect to  
time of the year as season (e.g., holidays) may have an effect on some of the psychometric 
measures. Upon consent, caregivers were asked to review and prioritize common caregiver 
concerns  using a checklist, as  the intervention will  focus  on the top three concerns  or problems. 
Following this visit, a research assistant  called the caregiver to conduct the baseline  
assessment (including anxiety, quality of life, caregiver reaction and problem solving inventory) 
over the phone. The research assistant was blinded to the caregiver’s group assignment to  
eliminate an y potential bias. While the pre - and post assessments were conducted by the 
research assistant  over the phone,  the consent  visit, actual  intervention visits/  video -calls and 
exit interviews were delivered by an interventionist.  
 
Group  1: PISCES  delivered  face to face 
Before  departing,  the interventionist  tentatively  scheduled  the upcoming  three  face-to-face visits 
for caregivers, and leave a manual on problem -solving designed for the lay audience based on 
“Solving Life’s Problems” by Nezu and D’Zurilla who developed the PST theoretical frameworkii 
with a  special  emphasis  on hospice and  hospice specific  examples.  The three intervention visits 
were scheduled with a suggested timeline between days 5 and 18 of the hospice admission.  
This timeline w as calculated based on average length of stay for our participating hospice 
agency and also on national level as well as based on the PST recommendations86 and 
previous work on cognitive behavioral interventions in hospice.iii However, this was only a 
guideline,  and the  actual  timing  and scheduling was  tailored to the individual  caregiver  needs 
and challenges (the visits  were scheduled and confirmed based on the caregiver’s feedback 
and preferences and with the recognition that unexpected and stressful even ts can lead to 
frequent rescheduling). Each intervention visit lasted approximately 45 minutes.  
The agenda for the first face to face visit for caregivers (suggested timeline 5 -7 days after 
hospice admission) includes an explanation of the purpose of the v isit/call, and confirmation of 
the three specific problems that the caregiver had selected from the concern list during the 
consent visit. Caregivers’ problem -solving inventory scores and sub -scales indicate their 
problem -solving style (positive problem or ientation, negative problem orientation, rational 
problem -solving, impulsivity/carelessness and avoidance6) and this allows the interventionist to 
customize the delivery of the intervention. During the first session, the interventionist works on 
steps  one and two of the ADAPT  model  of the  PST, namely  “Attitude”  and “Defining the  Problem 
and Setting Realistic  Goals.” For the first  step the focus  is on realistic  optimism, i.e.,  acceptance 
that problems are a normal part of life. This step focuses on promoting visualizing successful 
problem solving, healthy thinking rules, positive self -talk and using emotions adaptively. The 
problems identified by the caregiver will be used as examples for exercises and to brainstorm 
about applying different approache s. The second step of defining the problem focuses on 
enabling caregivers to seek available facts, describe facts in a clear language, separate facts 
from assumptions, set realistic goals and identify obstacles to overcome.  
During the second visit (suggest ed timeline 11 -13 days after hospice admission) the 
interventionist covers steps three and four of the ADAPT model. Step three encourages 
caregivers in being creative and generating alternative solutions. This step involves 
brainstorming  possible solutions  to the identified  problem,  encouraging  caregivers  to brainstorm 
many alternatives, defer judgment on these alternatives until a later stage of the intervention 
and think of a wide range of possible strategies (general) and tactics (more specific). Step fo ur 
focuses on predicting the consequences and developing a solution plan. This step involves 
evaluating  alternatives  and choosing the  one that is most likely to effectively solve  the identified 
problem.  Making effective decisions involves screening out obv iously ineffective solutions, 
predicting possible consequences, evaluating solution outcomes, and identifying effective 
solutions/developing a solution plan.  
The third visit (suggested  timeline  16-18 days  after hospice  admission)  focuses  on step five, 
namely trying out the solution plan and determining if it works. The general goal is to 
systematically evaluate the solution that caregivers implemented as a result of the previous 
steps to determine if it was effective in solving (or improving) the identified problem.  
 
Group  2: PISCES  delivered  in a hybrid  format  
In this  group,  participants  received  the PISCES  intervention  in three sessions;  however,  the first 
session was  delivered face  to face and the  other  two via video. The  three intervention sessions  
were scheduled with  a suggested  timeline  between days  5 and 18  of the hospice  admission  as 
in Group 1.  
The first session took place in person (suggested timeline 5 -7 days after hospice admission) 
and included an explanation of the purpose of the visit/call, and confirmation of the three  
specific problems that the caregiver  had selected from the concern list. During the first session, 
the interventionist worked on steps one and two of the ADAPT model of the PST, na mely 
“Attitude” and “Defining the Problem and Setting Realistic Goals.” After the first session where 
the in person  encounter  allowed  for the establishment  of rapport  between  the interventionist  and 
the caregiver, the second session (suggested timeline 11 -13 days  after hospice admission)  and 
the third session (suggested timeline 16 -18 days after  hospice admissions) were conducted via 
live videoconferencing.  
 
Group  3: PISCES plus delivered  in a hybrid  format  
PISCES plus is meant to be an enhanced version of th e PISCES intervention including the 
original problem solving therapy modules as designed for PISCES with the addition of positive 
reappraisal elements added to the curriculum. The agenda for the first face to face visit for 
caregivers  (suggested  timeline 5 -7 days  after hospice  admission)  includes  an explanation  of the 
purpose of the visit/call, and confirmation of the three specific problems that the caregiver had 
selected. During the first session,  the interventionist works  on steps  one and two of the ADAPT 
model of the PST, namely “Attitude” and “Defining the Problem and Setting Realistic Goals.” 
Additionally, at the end of the first session, the interventionist will ask the caregiver to take the 
time until the next scheduled session to think about and  identify some positive aspects of 
caregiving, whether these are tasks or responsibilities they enjoy, or other elements of the 
caregiving experience that they perceive as positive or beneficial.  
During the second session (suggested timeline 11 -13 days  after hospice admission) which took 
place via video the interventionist covers steps three and four of the ADAPT model. At the end 
of the session the interventionist  asked the caregiver to go over the benefits  or positive aspects 
of caregiving  that they had identified  and asked  them  to comment  as to why  they perceive these 
as positive or beneficial and whether there are ways to maximize the perceived benefits. The 
interventionists asked the caregiver to take the time until the next scheduled session to record 
how the  appreciation  of these  positive  elements helps them  through  stressful situations  or when 
they have negative thoughts.  
The third session (suggested timeline 16 -18 days after hospice admission) which also takes 
place via video focuses on step five, na mely trying out the solution plan and determining if it 
works.  The interventionist  concluded  the session  by briefly  discussing  the caregiver’s  perceived 
positive aspects of caregiving and reiterating the importance of recognizing and celebrating 
these aspects during the caregiving trajectory.  
Group  4: PISCES plus delivered  online  
In this group the entire PISCES plus is delivered online. The first session is conducted via video 
and not in person (as is the case in Group 3). The  agenda for the first video v isit for caregivers 
(suggested  timeline 5 -7 days  after hospice  admission)  includes  an explanation  of the  purpose  of 
the visit/call, and confirmation of the three specific problems that the caregiver had selected.  
During the first session, the interventioni st works on steps one and two of the ADAPT model of 
the PST, namely  “Attitude”  and “Defining  the Problem  and Setting Realistic  Goals.”  Additionally, 
at the end of the first session, the interventionist will ask the caregiver to take the time until the 
next scheduled session to think  about  and identify  some  positive  aspects  of caregiving,  whether 
these are tasks or responsibilities they enjoy, or other elements of the caregiving experience 
that they perceive as positive or beneficial.  
During  the second session (suggested  timeline  11-13 days  after hospice  admission)  which took 
place via video the interventionist covers steps three and four  of the ADAPT model. At the end 
of the  session  the interventionist  asked  the caregiver  to go over  the benefits  or positive aspects  
of caregiving  that they had identified  and asked  them  to comment  as to why  they perceive these 
as positive or beneficial and whether there are ways to maximize the perceived benefits. The 
interventionists asked the caregiver to take the time until the next scheduled session to record 
how the  appreciation  of these  positive  elements helps them  through  stressful situations  or when 
they have negative thoughts.  
The third session (suggested timeline 16 -18 days after hospice admission) which also takes 
place via video focuses on step five, namely trying out the solution plan and determining if it 
works.  The interventionist  concluded  the session  by briefly  discussing  the caregiver’s  perceived 
positive aspects of caregiving and reiterating  the importance of recognizing and celebrating 
these aspects during the caregiving trajectory.  
 
After all three intervention sessions were completed, a research assistant (blinded to the group 
assignment) called caregivers in all four groups for a post-intervention assessment of anxiety, 
depression,  quality  of life and  problem  solving inventory.  This segregation  of responsibilities  and 
the blinding of the research assistant to the group assignment aimed to minimize any potential 
bias. Caregivers rec eived a phone exit interview a few days after the last intervention visit and 
post intervention assessment phone call.  
 
Treatment  Fidelity  
To ensure treatment fidelity to the planned interventions, we used the training and treatment 
fidelity manual refined  during previous work. The  guide details the training of research staff, the 
nature of each of the three intervention sessions, and the protocol for administering each of the 
evaluative instruments. All face to face visits and all video -calls were audio -taped by the 
research staff and a randomly chosen sample of 10% of all sessions were studied. Thus, the 
integrity of the intervention protocol was systematically assessed via reviews of audio  
recordings of these sessions. Tapes were rated by the principal investigator (PI) for overall 
adherence to the protocol and inclusion of all required elements, as well as to confirm that no 
contamination took place (e.g., a case where the interventionist p rovided specific advice for a 
problem without allowing the caregiver to review and select an option). The research team was 
required to make adjustments if interventions were violating the intervention protocol. The 
intervention  manual  included  our interve ntion  monitoring  tools  (IMTs)  that were  refined  based  on 
recommendations by Radziewicz et aliv to help assure fidelity in individualized intervention 
studies.  
 
Measures  
Measures  for Specific  Aims  1 and 2: 
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD -7): The GAD -7 is a brief, valid and efficient tool for 
screening for anxiety and assessing its severity in clinical practice and research. The GAD -7 
has been tested and demonstrated high levels of reliability and validity.v The total score is 
calculated by  assigning  scores  of 0-3 for each  of the seven items.  Scores  of 5, 10, and 15 are 
taken as the cut off points for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively.  
Problem -Solving Inventory (PSI): The PSI is a 25 item Likert -type inventory that serves as a 
measure of problem -solving appraisal, or an individual’s perceptions of their problem -solving 
behavior and attitudes.vi The total score is used as an overall index of problem -solving ability. 
Reliability  and validity  of this instrument  have  been documented extensivel y (Cronbach’s  Alpha 
reported at .85).  
Caregiver Quality of Life Index – Revised (CQLI -R): The CQLI -R, a measure of caregivers’ 
quality of life (QOL), includes four dimensions: emotional, social, financial, and physical.vii This 
four-item instrument was des igned specifically for hospice caregivers, and its reliability and 
validity  have  been  established.  The instrument  has been  used  successfully  with elderly  hospice 
caregivers.viii Our research team has revised the CQLI instrument for use in oral interviews  
using 0 and 10 for each of the four anchors in place of the visual analog scale.ix Cronbach’s 
alpha  for the revised  instrument  (CQLI -R) was 0.769,  and test-retest  reliability  was supported 
(rs = 0.912, p<0.001).  
Nine-item Depression  scale of the Patient Health  Questionnaire (PHQ -9): The PHQ -9 is a brief 
tool for  assisting clinicians and researchers in assessing and monitoring levels of depression.x 
The PHQ -9 assesses symptoms and functional impairment due to depression and derives a 
severity s core. It  is based  directly  on the diagnostic criteria for  major  depressive  disorder  in the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Fifth Edition (DSM -V). It is widely used in practice and has 
been extensively tested (kappa = 0.65; overall accuracy, 85%; sensitiv ity, 75%; specificity, 
90%).  While  all other  measures  described  above  were also  used in  our original  clinical  trial, the 
PHQ -9 is a new measure we are planning to utilize; we decided to include a depression 
measure as it has been found to be impacted by the positive reappraisal modules in other 
studies.  
Demographic data:  Standard demographic data were collected on patients and caregivers, 
including a ge, gender, nativity, education level, marital status, occupation, patient’s diagnosis, 
relationship to patient, location of residence (residing with patient or not), estimate of average 
time spent on caregiving activities per week, impact on employment (w hether caregiver had to 
decrease work hours or give up employment) and perceived income adequacy (having a 
comfortable income,  having just  enough to  get by, not having  enough  to get by). Furthermore,  if 
the patient dies during the subject’s participation, that will be recorded along with the date of 
death (to allow for calculation of timing of death in the context of subject’s days in the study).  
Table  1 demonstrates  the timeline  for the collection  of these measures.

Measures  for Specific  Aim 3 
We conducted exit interviews with caregivers in all three groups. Caregivers in Group 1 were 
asked to provide general feedback about the PISCES intervention. Exit interviews with 
caregivers in Groups 2, and 3 also assessed caregivers’ perceptions of the hy brid delivery 
platform (face to face and video sessions); caregivers in Groups 3 and 4 were further  asked to 
provide feedback on the positive reappraisal aspects of PISCES plus. Interviews were carried 
out by the research coordinator and audio -taped based o n an interview protocol aiming to 
examine caregivers’ perceptions  and satisfaction.  Interview  questions  pertained to satisfaction 
with this  form of interaction,  barriers  and facilitators  to the use  of video,  and confidence in  using 
this form of interaction , lasted 20 to 30 minutes. The interviews were digitally recorded and 
transcribed. The QSR Nvivo11 software was used to manage and interpret the data. This 
software facilitates  the organization  of emerging  ideas,  to search  and explore in context,  and to 
seek patterns.  
 
Measures  for Specific  Aim 4: 
We conducted a cost analysis and we utilized the demographic data collected on enrollment in 
the study to allow for comparisons between the groups. These include hospice admission date 
and diagnosis,  patient  and informal  caregiver  age and sex,  race,  informal  caregiver  employment 
status,  education and income range, relationship of informal caregiver to patient,  and residence 
of the informal caregiver. We also equipment costs (including equipm ent price and 
depreciation), and training costs based on time to train research staff in the use of 
videoconferencing. The participating hospice agency also furnished the research team with the 
following client -level data to estimate resource use and costs : 
• direct  care time for scheduled  visits  by type of professional  
• travel  distance and  time spent  traveling  for scheduled  visits  by type of professional  
• direct  care time for after-hour calls and visits  by type of professional  
• travel  distance  and time spent  traveling  for after-hour visits  by type of professional  
• time and travel  associated  with the installation  and maintenance  of videophones  and 
addressing potential technical problems  
• average  salary  paid by type of professional  
• number  and cost of hospital  or emergency  room  visits  for patients.  
 
Other  Measures  
We assessed the quality of the video calls using a previously developed instrument for 
assessing the technical quality of a “virtual visit” in home care,xi a video -based interaction 
between he alth care providers and patients or caregivers. This instrument is a form that will be 
filled out by the research staff after  each video -session with a caregiver in Groups 2 and 3. The 
form includes  identification of  the caregiver, date,  starting and endin g time of the video -call. The 
main section  of the  form contains five items  regarding  the technical quality  of the video -call. The 
first two items refer to the observations made by the research staff in regard the frequency of 
difficulties with audio and image by the research staff.  The next two items address problems 
with video and sound at the caregiver’s end, as reported to the research staff during the video - 
call. The last item  addresses possible disconnection(s)  and their frequency of occurrence.  This 
section  allows  for the definition  of a score for  the overall  technical  quality  of each video -call. This 
instrument has been tested for reliability and validity and used to rate the technical quality of 
video -calls in home care settings.xii 
 
Data  Analysis  Plan 
Data  Analysis  for Specific Aims  1 and 2 
The primary analyses focused on examining differences between treatment groups in terms of 
caregiver  outcomes  during  the time  of intervention.  Changes  in caregivers’  scores  from baseline 
to post -treatment will be analyzed using analysis of covariance, with baseline score, site, and 
whether the caregiver’s patient has died, as covariates. Separate models were run for each 
outcome (caregiver  quality of life, anxiety, depression, and  problem -solving ability). For Specific 
Aim 1 (SA1) to assess the equivalence between PISCES F2F and PISCES in hybrid format, a 
confidence interval approach was used on the ANCOVA model, with a two -sided 5% leveI of 
significance. If the CI of the differenc e between the two groups falls within the pre -specified 
range of equivalence, the two interventions will be considered equivalent.xiii xiv The range of 
equivalence is defined between – Δ and + Δ. The clinically informed Δs for the primary 
outcomes  are: CQL I-R = 1.0; GAD -7 = 1.75;  PHQ -9 = 2.0; PSI = 2.5, respectively. The  analyses 
of equivalence  will be on a per-protocol  basis and  will be supplemented  by secondary sensitivity 
intent -to-treat analyses.55 
The analyses for Specific Aim 2 (SA2) focus on pair-wise comparisons between PISCES plus 
and the other treatment groups. A significance level of α=0.025 for each comparison was used 
to account for the multiple (2) comparisons and assure an overall significance level of no more 
than 0.05 for  each outcome . These  analyses  of superiority  was on an intent -to-treat basis,  using  
multiple imputation to address missing data. ANCOVA and chi -square tests were used to 
determine whether attrition  had an impact  on sample composition.  Specifically,  analyses were 
computed  on baseline  demographic  characteristics,  as well as baseline  outcome  measures,  to 
determine whether participants who completed all phases of data collection were initially 
different when compared with persons who did no t complete the intervention. Data were 
analyzed using the Stata statistical package.  
 
Data  Analysis  for Specific  Aim 3 
Interview  sessions  were  audio -recorded  and transcribed.  Data  were  analyzed  using  a qualitative 
thematic coding approach.  Data codes were inductively generated. Data analysis was 
performed by two members of the research team  and validity of interpretations was checked by 
a third member. Transcript data were coded  by line and  sentence for  descriptive (first -level)  and 
theme (p attern) codes.65 A list of major  thematic elements was extracted by thorough study and 
coding  of the interview  transcripts. The  analysis was organized into  an expanding list  of themes, 
arising from content, concepts, and descriptive categories (the process  will be supported by  the 
use of QSR NVivo11, an index -based qualitative analysis software package). The thematic 
elements was used to develop coding keywords. Each response was coded along a number of 
salient dimensions, such as topic, thematic content, a nd general sentiment using the previously 
abstracted keywords. Data were grouped and reviewed for trends and patterns or ideas that 
give insight into caregivers’ overall satisfaction with the intervention, their perception of the 
hybrid delivery platform ( for Groups  2 and 3)  and of the positive reappraisal modules (for Group 
3). Perceived benefits and challenges associated with both the focus and content of the 
intervention and its components as well as the mode of delivery were examined.  
 
Data  Analysis  for Specific  Aim 4 
Our cost analysis  compared  the three  intervention  groups  with respect  to total costs.  Using  the 
resource use and cost information, and the cost of client -specific hospitalizations and 
emergency  department visits  as described earlier,  we estimated  the total cost of care for each 
client.  These data were used as the dependent variable in four pair wise regression analyses 
comparing the four groups with respect to total costs incurred over the study timeframe.  
Analysis of variance  methods was employed.  We also examined resource use, and compared 
this between groups. Specifically, we compared the number of after -hours calls and, and the 
number of hospitalizations and emergency department visits. As these outcome variables are 
each  an event -count,  each  cannot  be truly normal  in distribution.  Traditional  regression  methods 
assume a normally distributed outcome with constant variance. In contrast, count data are 
discrete and usually involve many observations with identical values and of ten highly right - 
skewed due to a few individuals with extreme event counts. We used both Poisson regression 
and the Zero -Inflated Poisson model for a comparison of the number of after -hour visits and 
calls. We also controlled for demographic covariates in  these models. Direct and indirect costs 
for the hospice program were computed as the sum of implementation and operating costs.  
Intervention implementation costs included equipment costs (based on equipment price and 
depreciation), and staff training cost s. Operating costs were measured by staff costs (wages 
and time)  for delivery  of the intervention (based  on average wages  and average time research 
staff took to do the intervention), and costs of home visits (frequency and duration) by all 
hospice staff a s documented in the record review. Caregiver costs were based on overall 
informal  care time (using  income  data gather  upon  admission), intervention  time,  any time  lost 
from work, and out -of-pocket and travel expenditures related to caregiving as reported by the

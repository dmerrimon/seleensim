Protocol VITD -001  Topical Vitamin D in Vitamin D Deficiency  
1. SYNOPSIS  
Study Title:  Vitamin D Levels in Su bjects with Vitamin D Deficiency 
Following Topical Application of Vitamin D Gel – A Proof of 
Concept Study  
Protocol Number:  VITD -001 
Development Phase:  Phase 1   
Indication:  Subjects with known vitamin D deficiency   
(<20 μg/L Total 25 -OH Vitamin D)  
Study Drugs : 
(Including test, 
comparator, dosage 
form, dosing regimen 
and route)  A novel v itamin D 3 (cholecalciferol)  is provided as a topical gel using 
ingredients that are identified in the USP/NF and/or designated in the 
list of Inactive Ingredients in FDA  Approved Drugs.  The ingredients in 
the topical gel are well known in the industry and have references in the 
pharmaceutical literature and some have available FDA drug master 
file in formation.  A single applicator  contains 0. 75g of gel, containing 
150,00 0 international units of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) to be 
applied to the upper arm.  One dose consists of two applicator s, one 
applied to each upper arm, for a total of 300,000 international units per 
dose.  
Subjects with known vitamin D deficiency of  ≤20 ng/ml  total 25 -OH 
Vitamin D  (50 nmol/liter ) will be consented and  enrolled . They  will 
have a blood draw prior to dosing on Day 1 (to obtain a baseline 
vitamin D , calcium, albumin, and parathyroid hormone level ) and will 
receive 300,000 units of topical vi tamin D 3.  On Day 7, subjects will 
return to the clinic for a blood draw  to assess Vitamin D  level and to 
check for any signs of skin rash and/or reaction.   If a subject has a skin 
rash and/or reaction prior to Day 7, he/she will be advised to return to 
the clinic for assessment  as soon as possible . Any rash and/or skin 
reaction may be photographed and diagnosed.  A second dose of 
300,000 units of topical Vitamin D will be applied  by the nurse at the 
day 7 visit . Subjects will return on Day 14 for a third do se and a third 
blood draw.  A final blood draw to assess for Vitamin D level will be 
done on day 2 1.  
A study nurse or physician will apply each dose of topical Vitamin D . 
Prior to application of the gel, 2 strips of paper tape will be applied to 
the subje ct’s upper arms. One strip will be applied approximately 2 
inches below the subject’s shoulder and the second strip will be applied 
approximately 2 inches above  the subject’s elbow.  T he entire contents 
of one syringe (0.25 mL of gel) will be applied onto the subjects  arm in 
a straight line, from approximately 1 inch below the first strip of paper 
tape to approximately 1 inch above the second strip of paper tape.  The 
subject will be instructed to gently rub the gel into their upper arm with 
their fingertip s, while staying between the two pieces of paper tape, for 
approximately 2 minutes or u ntil the gel has been absorbed.  After 
completing the application process on both arms, the subject will wash 
his/her hands thoroughly.

No. Subjects:  20 subjects will p articipate.  If the change from baseline in 25 -OH 
vitamin D is consistently less than 10 µg/L in the first 10 subjects then 
the study will be discontinued.  
No. Centers:  The study will be conducted at the University of Minnesota (single 
center ) 
Study Dur ation:  The maximum duration of treatment is 14  days (stud y Days 0, 7 and 
14). Subjects will be followed for change in vitamin D blood level and 
for safety until Study Day 21 .  It is antici pated that the study will last 4  
months to enroll and com plete dosin g and assessment of 20  patients.  
 
Objectives of the 
Study:  The primary objective of the study is to determine the change in 
vitamin D blood levels following 3 doses of  topical vitamin D3 
treatment.  The secondary objective is to assess the safety (based o n 
skin rash and/or other reaction , as well as calcium and parathyroid 
hormone levels ) following the application of 3 doses of vitamin D 3 gel. 
Study Endpoints:  
(Primary and 
Secondary)  The primary endpoint is to establish the average change in vitamin D 
blood levels following 3 doses of treatment with vitamin D gel. The 
secondary study endpoint  is the number of subjects who have any skin 
rash and/or other skin reaction following treatment with the vitamin D 
gel. 
Study Design:  The study is a pre vs. post open-label trial to assess the change in 
vitamin D blood levels following treatment with 3 doses of topical 
vitamin D gel.  Subjects with known vitamin D deficiency will be 
consented and enrolled. They will have a blo od draw prior to dosing on 
Day 0  (to obtai n a baseline vitamin D level) and will receive topical 
vitamin D 3 on Days 0 , 7 and 14. On Day s 7, 14, and 21  subjects will 
return to the clinic for a post -dose blood draw and to be assessed for 
any signs of skin rash and/or reaction.  If a subject has a sk in rash 
and/or reaction at any time during the study , he/she should return to the 
clinic for assessment as soon as possible. Any rash and/or skin reaction 
will be photographed and diagnosed.

5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Vitamin D Deficiency  
Vitamin D insufficiency is an emerging and compelling public health issue.  Recent studies 
suggest that 19% of the U.S. population is  at risk for vitamin D inadequacy  1, although this 
may underest imate  the number of people at risk from  suboptimal vitamin D levels2. More 
than 40% of U.S. and European elderly men and women living in the community are 
deficient in Vitamin D3, and m ore than 50% of postmenopausal women taking medication for 
osteoporosis4. Diverse population subgroups are deficient in Vitamin D including Arab 
women and lactose intolerant individuals who consume less vitamin D from fortified 
products5.  In a Boston hospital, 25% of healthy students, physicians, and residents were 
found to be vitamin D –deficient, despite drinking a glass of milk and taking a multivitamin 
daily and eating salmon at least once a week6. By the end of the winter, it has been estimated 
that 42% of 15 - to 49 -year-old black females throughout the United States have  25-
hydroxyvitamin D levels below 20 ng per milliliter.  The implications of this are far -reaching .  
In addition to well -known impacts on bone health, vitamin D status is thought to potentially 
influence  a number of common diseases, including cancers, autoi mmune disorders, and 
cardiovascular disease. Vitamin D deficiency may increase  the risk of injury from falls as 
people  age7, while early in life Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with increased risk 
of Type 1 diabetes8,9.  Other patient p opulations at increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency 
include individuals with fat malabsorption, chronic kidney disease , or obesity10,11,12 .  
  
The Endocrine Society defines v itamin D deficiency as a 25(OH)D of 20 ng/ml (50 
nmol/liter)  or below , and vitamin D insuf ficiency as a 25(OH)D of 21 –29 ng/ml (525 –725 
nmol/liter)13.  They recommend measuring vitamin D using  the serum circulating 25 -
hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D).  The Institute  of Medicine  reports that persons are potentially 
at risk for inadequacy at serum 25OHD  levels between 12 and 20 ng/mL (30 and 50 
nmol/L)14. In sun -rich environments, normal levels have been estimated to be  54-90 ng /ml15. 
Although it is not known what the safe upper value for 25(O H)D is for avoiding 
hypercalce mia, most studies in children and adults have suggested that the blood levels need 
to be above 150 ng/ml before any concern  arises16. 
 
Of all of the forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol ( Vitamin D3 ) has been viewed as having the 
best overall combination of safety and efficacy, assuming norma l kidney and liver function.  
In the US, cholecalciferol has primarily been available as an oral supplement at fairly low 
doses (most commonly 1000 – 2000 IU).   In otherwise healthy patients , a common US 
standard of care for treatment of low serum vitamin  D  is to give 50,00 0 IU Vitamin D orally 
per week for four weeks ( total dose 200,000 IU) until levels are brought up into the adequate 
University of Minnesota  
Protocol VITD -001  Topical Vitamin D in Vitamin D Deficiency  
range , followed by daily 
supplements of 2,000 IU.  This is 
often provided as commercially 
available Vitamin D2, however  
supplementation with Vitamin D3 
appears to be  more potent and may 
provide other benefits17.     
 
Despite the widespread availability 
of oral supplementation, the 
frequency of vitamin D deficiency 
remains high.  Some individuals 
have difficulty taking pills , while 
others, especially the elderly, may be 
overwhelmed by the ir number of oral 
medications .  A need  exists  for a 
more convenient delivery 
mechanism  that enhance access to 
effective long term treatment of vitamin D deficiency . The proposed study aims to  
investigate both safety and efficacy of a topically applied vitamin D that is likely to be more 
effectiv e, convenient , or acceptable for many individuals . 
 
A wide variety of dosing schedules for Vitamin D  have been documented18. Recently Vieth’s 
team condu cted a study with oral cholecalciferol in 48 elderly women (81 ± 8 years)19.  The 
study tested oral cholecalciferol  (D3)  up to 45,000 IU once every 28 days.  The study showed 
that a single oral dose of 45,000 IU  dissolved in alcohol generally produced a r ise in serum 
vitamin D of about 10 ng/ml.  A second oral dose 28 days later further increased the serum 
vitamin D level by about another 10 ng/ml.  Thus, the total increase after two oral doses 
(90,000 IU) was about 20 ng/ml.   Although f ollowing oral dosing , rises in serum Vit D can 
be seen up to one month following administration, Vieth’s study  demonstrate d that most of 
the rise (>60%) in Vitamin D  occurs within 7 days . (Figure 1) . No one receiving oral 
monthly dosing of 45,000 IU  Vitamin D3 developed hyper calcemia.   
 
Vitamin D Product Development  
Innovative Pharmacy Services, Inc. has developed a vitamin D3 topical gel using ingredients 
that are identified in the USP/NF and/or designated in the list of Inactive Ingredients in FDA 
Approved Drugs.  The ingred ients in the topical gel are well known in the industry and have 
references in the pharmaceutical literature and some have available FDA drug master file 
information.  A single applicator contains 0.75 g of gel, containing 150,000 international 
units of vi tamin D3 (cholecalciferol) .  One dose will consist of two applicators.  One 
applicator  will be applied to each of the subject’s upper arm for a total dose of 300,000 units.

5.2 Study  Rationale and Selection of Dose  
5.2.1 Rationale for Study  
The purpose of this in vestigation is to demonstrate that a novel topical vitamin D3 
(cholecalciferol) gel is bioavailable to the systemic circulation and in sufficient quantities to 
treat hypov itaminosis D. In Phase Ia , healthy volunteers will be dosed with a topical gel to 
determine increases of serum 25 -OH vitamin D  that can be expected from three doses .  The 
application will take place in the winter months in Minnesota.  Although ambient levels of 
light are low at that time, subjects will be asked to  avoid attending tanning b ooths, and to  
wear a comfortable shirt that covers their upper arms at least to the elbow if they choose to 
go ou tside during daylight hours .  
5.2.2 Rationale for Selected  Dose  
A wide variation in Vitamin D dosing has been used in clinical practice12.  If we ass ume that 
the topical gel vitamin D dosing has no greater bioavailability than intramuscularly injected 
dosing, then the maximal effect of 100,000 IU of Vitamin D3 applied topically would be 
expected to reflect that of a single 100,000 IU injected dose19.  The supplementation protocol 
most often used in France to correct vi tamin D levels of  ≥ 10 ng/m l and <20 ng/ml is three 
doses of 100,000 IU of Vitamin D3 given intramuscularly one week apart20. For values ≤ 
10ng/ml four doses of 100,000 IU are administered.  An observational study of this common  
French  protocol by Rouillon evaluated 204 pati ents receiving 3-4 doses of 100,000 IU 
Vitamin D3 weekly for vitamin deficiency (Groups 1 and 2)21.  Rouillon found t he protocol 
to be safe with no episodes of hypercalcemia . Two patients from the total of 257 studied 
developed Vitamin D levels over 90 ng/m l (one 92 mg/ml and one 94 ng/ml) , with both 
resolving within one month.   .  
     
The proposed study  will use a topical application of Vitamin D which is unlikely to be as 
completely absorbed as intramuscular injection.  Furthermore, topical application of Vitamin 
D provides important additional physiologic mechanisms that reduce the potential for 
possible hypervitaminosis . Upon exposure to UVB radiation, previtamin D3 is synthesized 
from 7 -DHC in the stratum basale and stratum spinosum layers of the epide rmis. Previtamin 
D3 thermoisomerizes to vitamin D3  with heat or sunlight exposure at the ultraviolet region  of 
the solar spectrum around 316-330 nm  22.  Vitamin D3  is then available for binding with a 
vitamin D binding protein (DBP) and transported into the  circulation23. In the skin, the  DBP 
acts as a regulatory mechanism preventing over absorption of Vitamin D into the circulation  
by providing  a threshold when  the binding protein has been  fully occupied.  Upon exposure 
to sunlight, vitamin D3 itself is rapi dly degraded to other photoproducts, including 5,6 -trans -
vitamin D3, suprasterol I, and suprasterol II  24.  Although winter sunlight is not strong 
enough to  produce vitamin D3 in the skin , it is strong enough to promote the 
photodestruction of existing vita min D  24.  Neither binding with  DBP  nor other serum 
components prevent photodestruction .).  
 
In the process of normal physiologic production, p revitamin D3 can isomerize in a reversible 
reaction to form the photoproducts, tachysterol -3 or lumisterol -3.  These isomers do not 
enhance intestinal calcium absorption  and do not significantly enter the circulation .  The 
inactive m etabolic products  are sloughed off when skin cells are naturally shed.  Removal of 
previtamin D3 provides  a mechanism to prevent vitamin D toxic ity from prolonged sun 
University of Minnesota  
Protocol VITD -001  Topical Vitamin D in Vitamin D Deficiency  
exposure25, and may further  increase the potential safety of topical Vitamin D3  
administration .  The Mayo Clinic reports that Vitamin D is ‘likely’ safe when applied to the 
skin12.   
 
The effectiveness of topical absorption  for the proposed product  is unknown , however topical 
absorption is substantially  less effective  than the intramuscular  injection  of Vitamin D3 .  In 
the first three candidates, 300,000 units applied over three weeks resulted in an insignificant 
average change in Vitamin D level, as follows.      
Baseline  Week 1  Week 2  Week 3  Av

10.2  9.4 10.4  12.1  1.2 
 
 
Oral administration  of 50,000 IU  should  produce a 10 ng/ml  increase in total serum Vitami n 
D 13.   The topical application os 300,000 IU, therefore, was  substantially less effective than 
one 50,000 IU oral dose.   .  The study will use three doses of 300,000 IU applied one week 
apart with safety and outcome measures after each.  This is hoped  to provide a greater 
difference in vitamin D level than that see n in one oral 50,000IU supplement, but should 
produce less change than the typical US replacement dosing of three oral  supplements ,  If the 
change in total serum Vitamin D level after the topical application of 900,000 IU in the first 
10 subjects is consis tently less than 10  mg/ml then the study will be discontinued.

7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1 Overall Study Design  
20 healthy adult s with known vitamin D deficiency  (defined  as serum 25 -OH vitamin D 
concentration < 20 ng/ml) will receive 3 doses of 300,000 IU of topical vitamin D  once per 
week for three weeks.  Each dose will be made up of two applications of 150,000 IU 
cholecalciferol  in .75 ml of gel applied consecutively t o the upper arms (one 150,000 IU 
application per arm).  
 
Blood will be drawn at baselin e prior to the first dose (Day 0 ) and on Days 7, 14, and 21.    
Total serum 25-OH vitamin D will be assayed at each draw. Parathyroid hormone level will 
be assayed at ba seline and on day 21.     
7.2 Study Duration  
The maximum duration of treatment is 14 days (study Days 0, 7 and 14). Subjects will be 
followed for change in vitamin D blood level and for safety until Study Day 21 .  It is 
antici pated that the study will last 4  months to enroll and com plete dosing and assessment of 
20 patients.

8.3 Criteria for Withdrawal  
A subject  has the right to withdraw fully or partially from the study at any time and for any 
reason without prejudice to his or her future medical care by the physician or at the 
institution.  
Withdrawal of full consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive further 
investigational treatment and does not wish to or is unable to continue further in study 
participation.  Subject data up to withdrawal of consent will b e included in the analysis of the 
University of Minnesota  
Protocol VITD -001  Topical Vitamin D in Vitamin D Deficiency  
study.  The Investigator will discuss with the subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal 
from the study.  Withdrawal of partial consent from a study means that the subject does not 
wish to take investigational product or other protocol -required therapy any longer but is still 
willing to collaborate in providing further data by continuing on study.  Should a subject 
request or decide to withdraw from the study, all efforts will be made to complete and report 
the observat ions as thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal.  All information 
should be reported on the applicable case report form ( CRF ).  Reasons for removal from 
protocol -require d treatment  or observation might include:  
 partial /full withdrawal of consen t 
 administrative decision by the Sponsor -Investigator  
 pregnancy  
 ineligibility  
 significant protocol deviation  
 subject noncompliance  
 adverse event, including rash or other skin reaction  
 Death  
8.4 Replacement of Subject s 
Subjects who withdraw or are removed from the study prior having their Day 7  blood draw  
for a reason other than a drug-related adverse event  will be replaced .

9. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS  
9.1 Treatment Assignment  
This is an open -label, nonrandomized study in which all subjects will receive topical vitamin 
D gel.  
9.2 Treatment  Administration  
Subjects will be provided with written and verbal instructions about Vitamin D deficiency  
during their baseline/Day 1 visit.  A study nurse or physician will supervise each treatment 
application  to ensure that the gel is applied correctly. Prior to application of the gel, 2 strips 
of paper tape will be applied to the subject’s upper arms. One strip will be applied 
approximately 2 inches below the subject’s shoulder and the second strip will be applied 
approximately 2 inches above the subject’s elbow.  The entire contents of one syringe (0. 75 
mL of gel) will be applied onto  their arm in a straight line, from approximately 1 inch below 
the first strip of paper tape to approximately 1 inch above the second strip of paper tape.  The 
subject will be instructed to gently rub the gel into their upper arm with their fingertips, while 
staying between the two pieces of paper tape, for approximately 2 minutes or until the gel has 
been absorbed.  After completing the application process o n both arms, the subject will wash 
his/her hands thoroughly.  
A complete description of the administration process can be found in Appendix 1.

10. STUDY DRUG MATERIALS AND MANAGEMENT  
10.1 Description of Study Drug  
A novel topical vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) gel has been developed  and is being provided  by 
Innovative Pharmacy S olutions , Inc. The ingredients in the gel are well -known in the 
industry and have references in the pharmaceutical literature and some have available FDA 
drug master file information.  The formul ation for the topical vitamin D gel is: 
 
Gel Formula  
Vitamin D3 1,000,000 IU/gm          20.0 gm  
Phosol 53 MCT (lipoid)        20 gm  
Cholesterol USP -NF         0.8 gm  
Isopropyl myristate USP -NF       5 gm  
Poloxamer 407 NF         7.5 gm  
Purified Water USP         46.5 gm  
Methylparaben USP -NF       0.18 gm  
Propylparaben   USP-NF       0.02 gm  
The previous anhydrous formula was changed to a hydrous base to provide a less greasy 
product.  The new formula is a simple wash off base that provides phospholipids that  are able 
to self -associate into micelles and liposomes.  
 
10.2 Packaging and Labeling  
The topical vitamin D gel is provided in a syringe as a single application of 0. 75g of gel, 
containing 150,000 IU of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) that will be applied to each  of the 
subject’s upper arms, totaling  300,000 IU per dose.

11. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
The schedule of study assessments and procedures is shown in Table 1.   
11.1 Baseline Assessments  
A chart review of subjects with known vitamin D deficiency will be performe d prior to Day 0  
in order to assess for potential study eligibility. Informed consent must be obtained before 
any study pro cedures are performed.   
11.1.1  Study Day  0 
The following procedures should  be completed on Day 0 : 
 informed consent  
 assessment of height, weight and skin to assess for study eligibility  
o Anthropometric Assessment  
 Patients are measured for height (cm) and weight ( kg) following 
standardized procedures as outlined in the Anthropometric Standardization 
Reference Manual  (Lohman et al., 1991) .    Body weight is measured with 
a stand -on digital scale and height is measured by a stadiometer.  Height is 
measured to the nea rest 0.1 cm and weight to the nearest 0.1 kg.   
o Recording of Fitzpatrick skin -type score.  
 Blood draw for vitamin D level, parathyroid hormone level, calcium, and album in. 
 Application of the topical vitamin D gel, including instructions for dosing at home  
11.1.2  Study Day 7 and Study Day 14 
 Evaluation of skin site where gel applied.  If the subject has any skin rash or other 
reaction, he/she should contact study personnel as soon as possible for photographs 
and an assessment/diagnosis  
o Photographs of application si tes 
 A digital photograph may be taken of the gel application site following 
application to record any signs of irritation or reaction. Identifying 
marks on or near the application site (i.e. tattoos, birthmarks, scars 
etc.) should be avoided when a photogr aph is taken. Digital 
photographs will be uploaded to the REDcap database and stored on 
the secure server.  
 Blood draw for vitamin D level  and calcium  
 Application of the topical vitamin D gel 
11.1.3  Study Day 21 
 Assessment of skin for rash or any other reaction  
 Blood draw for vitamin D , parathyroid hormone level, and calcium.  
University of Minnesota  
Protocol VITD -001  Topical Vitamin D in Vitamin D Deficiency  
12. EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
Efficacy assessments should be performed  according to the Schedule of Events  (Table 1).   
12.1 Vitamin D Levels  
Assessments of serum 25-OH vitamin D levels ( D2 and D3)  will be done  and on Day  0, 7, 
14, and 21 . Venous blood draws will be performed by a trained University of Minnesota 
Physicians (UMP) technician and delivered to HealthEast laboratory  for analysis .    
University of Minnesota  
Protocol VITD -001  Topical Vitamin D in Vitamin D Deficiency  
13. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
13.1 Safety Assessments  
13.1.1  Skin Rash or Other Reaction  
An assessment of each subject’s skin will be performed on Day s 7, 14 and 21  using the 
following scoring system for topical irritation developed per FDA guidance:  
Basic Score:   Description:  
 0  No visible react ion 
  0.5   Doubtful or negligible erythema reaction  
  1.0  Mild or just perceptible macular erythema reaction in a speckled/follicular,  
patchy or confluent pattern (slight pinking)  
  2.0 Moderate erythema reaction in a confluent pattern (definite redness)  
  3.0  Strong or brisk erythema reaction that may spread beyond the test site  
 
Supplemental Scores:  Description:  Label:  
 0.5   Edema   E 
 0.5   Papules  P 
 0.5   Vesicles  V 
 0.5   Bullae   B 
Supplemental scores will be added to the basic scores if the associ ated symptoms are present. The 
final score will be the sum of the basic and supplemental scores.  
As part of the general safety assessment, dermal irritation will be evaluated by the 
Investigator  or designated research staff using the outlined scale.  The likelihood of allergic 
reaction not manifested as a dermal irritation is extremely low.  Given that all the ingredients 
used to make the topical vitamin D gel are considered GRAS, we do not anticipate non -local 
allergic reactions.  In the event that a non -dermal allergic  reaction occurs,  standard medical 
procedures utilized  for such situations will be followed .   
 
If a subject  develops a dermal response of 1.5  up to 2.5 , he or she will be given the option to 
permanently discontinue the study treatment and w ithdraw from the study, or to allow 
sufficient time for the rash to resolve before he or she reinitiates the phase of the study he or 
she was in at the time that the rash developed.  If a participant develops a dermal response of 
2.5 or greater, he or she will be required to permanently discontinue the study treatment and 
he or she will be withdrawn from the study.  In both cases, the study participant will be 
encouraged to seek medical care from his or her primary care physician . In addition, we will 
ask s ubjects who decide to withdraw from the study to return for their next scheduled blood 
draw, as per protocol.  We will also follow up with any study participant who withdraws 
from the study due to AE occurrence through telephone contact at 1 week intervals  until the 
AE resolves . 
 
All other adverse events will be assessed by self -report from subjects.   
 
University of Minnesota  
Protocol VITD -001  Topical Vitamin D in Vitamin D Deficiency  
We will initially administer  100,000 units topically  to subjects , and check serum Vitam in D 
and calcium levels  one week later.  Dosing will be discontinued i f a patient achieves a 
Vitamin D level of greater than  normal ( > 90 ng/ml ) or if serum calcium rises above normal 
(> 10.2 mg/d l). Additional doses of 100,000 units will be administered on days 7 and 14. The 
outcome of interest will be the effect on total s erum Vitamin D  at 21 days . Although a 
change in calcium is unlikely, calcium will be monitored for safety.   
 
Vitamin D may alter glucose values  and improve glucose control in individuals with 
diabetes26. Although individuals with diabetes  will not be exclu ded, we will instruct any 
subjects with diabetes to more closely monitor glucose values during the course of the study.  
 
Parathyroid hormone will be measured at baseline and on Day 21 to determine if vitamin D 
correction changes the level of this metaboli c calcium regulatory hormone.    
 
 
13.2 Reporting of Safety Information  
13.2.1  Definition of an Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporarily associated 
with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considere d related to the medicinal 
product.  
Examples of an AE include:  
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition  
 A new condition detected or diagnosed after investig ational product administration 
even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigati onal product or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be 
reported as an AE/SAE)  
Examples of an AE do not include:  
 Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE  
 Situations whe re an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to hospital, such as for PK sampling convenience)  
In this study, AEs may include pre - or post -treatment events that occur as a result of 
protocol -mandated procedures (i.e. , invasive procedures, modification of a subject ’s previous 
therapeutic regimen).  
13.2.2  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
University of Minnesota  
Protocol VITD -001  Topical Vitamin D in Vitamin D Deficiency  
a. results in death  
b. is life -threatening  
Note: The term ‘life -threatening ’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
c. requires hospitali zation or prolong ation  of an existing hospitali zation  
Note: In general, hospitali zation signifies that the subject has been detained (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation 
and/or treatment that would not have been a ppropriate in the physician’s office or out -
subject setting.  Complications that occur during hospitali zation are AEs.  If a 
complication prolongs hospitali zation or fulfills  any other serious criteria, the event is 
serious.  When in doubt as to whether ‘h ospitali zation’ occurred or was necessary, the 
AE should be considered serious.  
Hospitali zation for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.  
d. results in disability/incapacity  
Note: The term di sability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea , 
influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent 
everyday life functions, but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e. is a congen ital abnormality / birth defect  
f. any event deemed by the Investigator  as being a signific ant medical event.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitali zation, bu t may jeopardi ze the subject or may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
above definition.  These should also be considered serious.  Examples of such events are 
invasive or malignant cancers, intensiv e treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitali zation, 
or development of drug dependency or abuse.    
13.2.3  Recording of AEs and SAEs  
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsib ility of the Investigator  to review all 
documentation (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostic reports) relative to 
the event. The Investigator  will then record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE 
into the CRF.   
For each AE, sta rt and stop dates, action taken, outcome, intensity (see Section  13.2.3.1 ) and 
relationship to study product (causality) (see Section  13.2.3.2 ) must be documented.  I f an 
AE changes in frequency or intensity during a study, a new entry of the event must be made 
in the CRF.  
University of Minnesota  
Protocol VITD -001  Topical Vitamin D in Vitamin D Deficiency  
The Investigator  will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information.  In the absence of a diagnosis, the individual 
signs/symptoms should be documented.  
All details of any treatments initiated because of the AE should be recorded in the subject’s 
notes and the CRF.  
All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabil izes, until the 
event is otherwise explained, or until the subject is lost to follow -up.  Once resolved, the 
appropriate AE/SAE CRF page(s) will be updated.  The Investigator will ensure that follow -
up includes any supplemental investigations as may be ind icated to elucidate the nature 
and/or causality of the AE or SAE.  This may include additional laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care 
professionals.  
13.2.3.1  Assessment of Intensity  
The Investigat or will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during 
the study.  The assessment will be based on the Investigator’s clinical judgment.  Adverse 
events from the first dose of topical vitamin D gel will be assesed  based on this general  
guideline:  
 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
 Moderate; minimal, local or non -invasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily  
 Severe or med ically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care activities of 
daily living  
 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
 Death related to AE   
Severity should not be confused with an SAE.  Severity is a category utili zed for rating the 
intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  An event is defined 
as “serious” when it meets one of the pre -defined outcomes as descri bed in Section 13.2.2  
“Definition of an SAE.”  
13.2.3.2  Assessment of Causality  
The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between investigational product and 
the occurrence of each AE/SAE.  The Investigator  will use clinical judgment to determine the 
relationship.  Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, 
concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the 
investigational product will be c onsidered and investigated.   
The causal relationship to the study product assessed by the Investigator (or medically 
qualified delegate) should be assessed using the following classifications:  
Not Related  In the Investigator’s opinion, there is not a caus al relationship between the 
study product and the AE.  
University of Minnesota  
Protocol VITD -001  Topical Vitamin D in Vitamin D Deficiency  
Unlikely  The temporal association between the AE and study product is such that the 
study product is not likely to have any reasonable association with the AE.  
Possible  The AE could have been caused by the study subject’s clinical state or the 
study product.  
Probable  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study 
product administration, abates upon discontinuation of the study product and 
cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the study 
subject’s clinical state.  
Definitely  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study 
product administration or reappears when study product is reintroduced.  
The causality assessment is one of the criteria u sed when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.  
13.2.3.3  Assessment of Expectedness  
Expected  An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is consistent with the 
applicable product information (e.g., Investigators’ Brochure for an  
unapproved medicina l product).  
Unexpected  An adverse reaction, the nature or sever ity of which is not consistent with 
information in the relevant source document (e.g., Investigators’  Brochure for 
an unapproved medicinal product).  
13.2.4  Reporting of SAEs  
Once a Sponsor -Investigato r becomes aware that an SAE has occurred in a study subject, 
he/she will assess the event and determine if it meets regulatory reporting requirements.  The 
Investigator must also notify the reviewing Investigational Review Board (IRB)  and site 
governance of fice (if required) of any SAEs acco rding the guidelines of the IRB.

14. DATA ANALYSIS AND STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Data for this study will be entered into a REDCap database, which uses a MySQL database 
via a secure web interface with data checks used during  data entry to ensure data quality. 
REDCap includes a complete suite of features to support HIPAA compliance, including a full 
audit trail, user -based privileges, and integration with the institutional LDAP server. The 
MySQL database and the web server wil l both be housed on secure servers operated by the 
University of Minnesota Academic Health Center’s Information Systems group (AHC -IS). 
The servers are in a physically secure location on campus and are backed up nightly, with the 
backups stored in accordan ce with the AHC -IS retention schedule of daily, weekly, and 
monthly tapes retained for 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively. Weekly backup 
tapes are stored offsite. The AHC -IS servers provide a stable, secure, well -maintained, and 
high-capacity da ta storage environment, and both REDCap and MySQL are widely -used, 
powerful, reliable, well -supported systems. Access to the study's data in REDCap will be

The general analytical approac h for all endpoints will be descriptive in nature. No formal 
statistical hypothesis testing will be conducted. No p -values will be presented due to the 
small sample size of this study. Data analyses wil l be provided  for all study subjects 
combined wherever  appropriate.   
For continuous variables, summary statistics will include number of subjects, mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.  For categorical variables, descriptive statistics 
will include number of subjects  and percentages.  
In regards to handling of missing data, there will be no imputation of missing values.  
14.1 Analysis  Populations  
Safety Population :  all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug and who have at 
least one post -dosing safety evaluation.  All safety endpoints , baseline characteristics, and 
demographic data will be summarized using the Safety Population.  
Efficacy Evaluable Population :  all subjects who receive all 3 doses  of study drug and have a 
follow up blood draw for vitamin D levels , or discontinue prior to completing dosing due to a 
drug-related adverse event .  Vitamin D level  data will be analyzed using the Efficacy 
Evaluable Population.   
14.2 Study Endpoints  
The primary endpoint is to establish the change in vitamin D blood levels following 3 doses of 
treatm ent with vitamin D gel. 
Secondary study endpoint s include assessment of safety, including change in parathyroid hormone 
level and the number of subjects who have any skin rash and/or other skin reaction following 
treatment with the vitamin D gel.

14.3 Data Anal ysis 
14.3.1  Subject Disposition  
The number and percentage of subjects entering and discontinuing the clin ical study will be 
presented .  The reasons for discontinuation will also be summarized.  
14.3.2  Demography and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline chara cteristics will be descript ively summarized  using the Safety 
Population.  Quantitative and/or categorical summaries will  be presented for demographics 
and other basel ine characteristics.   
14.3.3  Treatment Exposure  
Treatment exposure will be su mmarized .  Measures  of extent of exposure include the total 
number of doses per subject, cumulative dose per subject, and compliance  (percent of target 
dose received per cycle) .  The reason(s) for dose(s) missed  will also be summarized.  
14.3.4  Safety Analyses  
Safety parameters will  be listed and summarized using standard descriptive statistics.   
Adverse event terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) and will be summarized by dose.  Incidence of AEs occurring during the study 
will be summar ized by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term.  Adverse events will 
also be summarized by causality and grade.  Serious adverse events and AEs leading to 
discontinuation of study treatment will be listed separately.   
Additional analyses will be perf ormed if warranted upon review of the data.  
14.3.5  Analysis of Efficacy  
The primary outcome will be the change in total Vitamin D following the topical application 
of 100,000IU Vitamin D3 weekly for three weeks.    
14.4 Determination of Sample Size  
A change from basel ine of 10 µg/L in total 25 -OH Vitamin D levels in subjects with Vitamin 
D deficiency is thought to be a clinically relevant improvement. Assuming that the standard 
deviation for pre and post measures of total 25 -OH Vitamin D is 4 μg/L, then the standard 
deviation of the difference is 5.6  μg/L  so 10 subjects should be adequate  to show an effect 
size of 6.4  μg/L with alpha of .05 and a power of 90%.  However the standard deviation of 
the second measure is unknown since absorption may vary by individual.  Assu ming  the 
standard deviation of the second measure increases to 12, then 20 subjects would be needed 
to detect an effect size of 10  μg/L.  In order to be most conservative, 20 subjects will be 
treated in this proof -of-concept study.

16. ADMINISTRATIVE CONSIDERATIONS  
16.1 Protocol Amendments  
Protocol modifications that impact on subject safety or the validity of the st udy will be 
approved by the IRB. If a Protocol amendment requires changes to the Informed Consent 
Form, the revised Inf ormed Consent Form, prepared by the Investigator, must be approved 
by the IRB and site governance offices (as required).  
Once the final Protocol has been issued and approved  by the Sponsor -Investigator and the 
authoriz ed signatories, it shall not be inform ally altered.  Protocol amendments are alterations 
to a legal document and have the same legal status.  Therefore, they must pass through 
appropriate steps before being implemented.  In general, any important change that 
theoretically increases risk to sub jects constitutes an amendment.   
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to submit the amendment to the IRB for their 
approval; written approval should be obtained . The original signed copy of amendments will 
be kept in the Study File with the origin al Protocol.  It should be noted that where an 
amendment to the Protocol substantially alters the study design or the potential risks to the 
subjects, each subject’s consent to continue participation should be obtained.  
16.2 Archiving of Records  
All source docu ments, CRFs and trial documentation will be kept by the Investigator for the 
appropriate retention period as stipulated by l ocal regulations and ICH -GCP . 
16.3 Study Report  
The Sponsor -Investigator or designee will produce the clinical study report at the comple tion 
of the study. In addition, it is intended that the outcome of the study will be submitted for 
publication in appropriate peer review journals and scientific meetings, as accepted.

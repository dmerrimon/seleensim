 Background and Introduction  
The human cornea is an avascular tissue that receives it s oxygen through the tear film. It is well accepted that 
contact lens wear interrupts this oxygen diffusion and results in physiologic changes (Smelser GK, 1955). 
Contact lens and oxygen metr ics to prevent these physiologic changes due to contact lens wear like corneal 
swelling, limbal injection, and neovas cularization have been calculated (Brennan NA, 1987; Papas, 1998; Yeung 
KK, 2018). The Apioc lens design differs from commercially available lenses primarily because it has greater on-
eye movement. It is proposed that this greater movement  allows for greater tear flow and thus greater oxygen 
diffusion to the cornea. 
Human corneal oxygen uptake rate is measured by gent ly placing a polarographic oxygen sensor against the 
central cornea while the subject is seated in a chair and fi xating a target straight in front of the subject on the 
wall. A Dual Channel oxygen meter with automated respir ometry software amplifies the current output of the 
sensor and displays the oxygen tension in torr. The sensor has a flat, non-rece ssed 25 um diameter silver 
anode covered by a nominal 12.5-um po lyethylene membrane. To maintain proper sensor function, as well as 
sanitary conditions, the membrane co vering the sensor tip which contacts the cornea is changed between 
subjects.  Calibration of the sensor allows for accurate measuremen ts. The output of the sensor is zeroed by immersing 
the sensor into a 0.9 percent saline  bath which has been bubbled with ni trogen from a compressed nitrogen 
gas cylinder for at least 60 minutes. Though dissolving so dium sulfite would create a more stable zero oxygen 
solution, this method is not safe for meas urements being done on the human cornea in vivo . Nitrogen purging 
is considered the most effective method to remove dissolved oxygen for the stated purpose (Butler IB, 1994). 
The gain of the sensor’s output is adjusted after imme rsion in a second bath of 0.9 percent saline bubbled with 
room air to establish an oxygen tension of approxim ately 154.3 torr (or, 20.9% of the average barometric 
pressure less the partial pressure of  humidity). The temperature of both baths is controlled at 35.9°C, the 
average human corneal temperature (Purslow C, 2005).  
Corneal oxygen uptake rates are derive d by rapid transfer of the sensor from the 154.3-torr bath to gentle 
contact with mild consistent pressure against the central cornea. This tr ansfer takes less than 2 sec. There is an 
initial upward burst of the sensor out put to approximately 160 torr, after wh ich the partial pressure of oxygen 
falls monotonically as the cornea depletes oxygen from th e reservoir of the sensor (i.e., oxygen dissolved in the 
polyethylene jacket). Contact with the normal open-e ye cornea is discontinued within approximately 28-40 
seconds– when the cornea has depleted the oxygen reservoir below 40 torr. The corneal oxygen uptake rate is 
defined in mmHg/sec as the average depletion rate ov er the 100-mmHg range from 140 to 40 mmHg. It is 
important to note this difference in  units (torr vs. mmHg) is negligib le as one torr is equivalent to 
0.9999998575337 mmHg. The resting oxygen uptake rate of  the normal open-eye human cornea measured in 
this manner will therefore vary  from 3.5 to 4.5 mmHg/sec.  
According to Benjamin (1982) (1979)  measurements of corneal oxygen  uptake rate can also be made 
immediately after 5-min periods of eye closure, 5-min non-blinking periods of open-eye contact lens wear, and 
5-min periods of open-eye contact lens  wear in which blinking occurs. Each of these conditions will lower the 
concentration of oxygen available to the cornea and create  an oxygen uptake rate that is greater than that of 
the resting open-eye cornea. The degree to which the oxygen uptake rate is greater is related to the degree to which the conditions lower the concentration of oxygen at the corneal surface below that of the resting condition, 20.9%. 
 
2 
 The study objective is to compare the corneal oxygen uptake rates of the standard conditions (normal open 
and closed eyes) and test conditions. 
Tear Flow Under Hydrogel Contact Lenses  
Polse measured the tear replenishment rate under three different hydrogel lenses a nd determined with a slit 
lamp modified to serve as a fluorophotometer. He fo und that fractional tear vo lume replenishment rates 
under these lenses averaged 0.011 per blink, which was significantly lower than the 0.10 to 0.20 per blink 
reported for rigid lenses. These data suggest that the amount of oxygen delivered to the cornea by tear 
pumping for common hydrogel lenses is relatively small and that oxygen re ceived by the cornea covered by a 
hydrogel lens comes principally by diffusion through the material (Polse, 1979). 
Using hypothetical tear mixing rates, Fatt and Lin (1976) calculated the amount of oxygen under the lens 
attributable to tear pumping. Their re sults show that if the mixing effici ency (fractional replacement of the 
tear-lens volume per blink) is 0.05 or greater, the part ial pressure contributed by tear pumping can range from 
5 to 10 mmHg, depending on the oxygen transmissibility of  the lens. They theorized that increasing the oxygen 
tension under the lens by 5 to 10 mmHg would likely reduce much of the corneal edema resulting from 
corneal hypoxia seen with the low-transm issibility soft lenses of their day. 
The low tear interchange rate reported  by Polse suggests that if corneal edema is to be prevented with contact 
lens wear, the material must have high enough oxyg en transmissibility to meet the oxygen needs of the 
cornea. This observation is consistent with the prediction s by Fatt and Lin (Fatt I L.  D., 1976) and Fatt and Hill 
(Fatt I H. R., 1970), who have shown that the contribution of tear flow to the oxygen tension at the anterior 
cornea for most low Dk/t hydrogel lenses would be as  low as 4 mmHg. Many currently used hydrogel contact 
lenses can only supply adequate oxygen to the cornea dire ctly by diffusion if the lens thickness is less than 0.10 
mm (Decker M, 1978). 
Study Objective 
I. Evaluate corneal oxygen uptake of a new translating contact lens design with comparison to published 
data and commercially available designs. 
II. Evaluate subjectively reported co mfort of a new translating contact lens design with comparison to 
commercially available designs. 
Hypothesis 
We hypothesize that the Apioc lens design will provide greater tear exchange behind  this novel soft contact 
lens than a standard soft contact lens. Its patented design  suspends the lens from  the upper eyelid thus 
allowing a looser fit and greater movement of the contac t lens over the ocular surface than standard thickness 
soft contact lenses. These design aspects should lead to  an increase in tear exch ange behind the contact lens. 
Because tear exchange behind a soft co ntact lens is very difficult to meas ure on the human eye, and there is 
no tear exchange rate benchmark that  is correlated with direct clinical  benefits, the impact of the Apioc 
contact lens design will be assessed indirectly by measuring corneal oxygen  uptake, as the cornea receives its 
oxygenation through the tears. Thus, our experimental hy pothesis is that the cornea wearing the Apioc contact 
lens will have an oxygen uptake rate of >=10 mm Hg.  
Apioc is manufactured in Definitive 74 contact lens material (Dk/t = 44) (B enjamin, 2018). If the Apioc contact 
lens and standard contact lens have center thickness of 0.20 mm, then th e Dk/t of the lenses is 22 which 
correlates with 9 percent EOP. If the Apioc lens movement  with blinking at a normal  blink rate allows greater 
oxygen delivery by 30 percent to 12  percent EOP, (See illustration by Be njamin below) it will allow normal 
corneal thickness, (prohibit corneal sw elling) in daily wear. This provides  a clinical benchmark demonstrating 
 
3 
 that the Apioc contact lens design will provide an im provement in corneal physiology over the standard soft 
contact lens design.  
Note, lenses having an Equivalent Ox ygen Percentage (EOP) of 9.9%, do not induce corneal edema. Holden and 
Mertz (Holden BA, 1984) state an oxygen transmissibility of  at least 24.1 ± 2.7 X 10~9 (cm X ml C>2)/(sec X ml X 
mmHg) which correlates closel y with Benjamin, above.  
 
Study Lenses 
The Apioc contact lens is a daily we ar soft contact lens, which is cl assified under 21 CF R 886.5925 (product 
code: LPL).  The FDA has previously made  risk determinations (class II, non-si gnificant risk) for devices classified 
under 21 CFR 886.5925.  The Apioc-A contact lens has th e same actions and indications for use as other 
contact lenses classified under 21 CFR 886.5925.  As a no n-significant risk device, the Apioc contact lens is 
exempt from the IDE regu lation (21 CFR 812).

Study Design and Procedures 
Study Design 
Structure:  Single center, se rially recruited 
Duration: approximately one month from consent to study completion 
Visit Schedule:  up to three study visits sepa rated by a minimum of 48 hours 
Clinical Study Methods 
In this study, an experienced clinic ian will apply the oxygen electrode as described above to one eye of up to 
10 subjects who are experienced contact lens wearers, eyec are clinicians or clinicians -in-training, and have no 
active ocular conditions that would prec lude short term contact lens wear.  
There will be up to five scenarios that wi ll be examined at each visit: cornea  with no stimulus to represents the 
high oxygen condition; immediately af ter gently closing their eyes for 5 minutes to represent the low oxygen 
condition; and after contract lens wear. Lens options in clude Apioc lens design with lenticular, Apioc lens 
design without lenticular, and commerc ially available contact lenses. The co ntact lens conditions will be worn 
with normal blinking – every four se conds for five minutes prior to oxygen  uptake measures. The scenarios will 
be randomized to minimize bias. Each of these measurements lasts less than one mi nute and are repeated at two additional visits.  
A rest period of at least ten minutes of normal open eye blinking should be allowed between measurements of 
the same eye.   
The conjunctiva of the subject will be examined prior to probe applications  and between probe applications to 
assess ocular irritation induced by the probe. An increase in two grades on to the Brien Holden Vision Institute 
Grading Scales (see appendix) will indicate a need  to discontinue measurements for the day.

 Data Analysis 
The study objective is to compare the corneal oxygen uptake rates of the standard conditions (normal open 
and closed eyes) and test conditions. Paired t-tests will  be performed to determine if this objective is met. 
The individual performing data analysis  will be masked to minimize bias. 
Safety and Adverse Events 
Subjects in this study are exposed to  a test contact lens. Adverse events reported before the use of the test 
lens should be recorded as medical history. Untoward me dical events reported after the subject's exit from the 
study will be recorded as adverse events  at the discretion of the Investigator. 
All adverse events either observed by the Investigator, one of his/her medical collaborators, or reported by the 
subject spontaneously or in response  to direct questioning, will be re corded on an adverse event form. 
Documentation will include a descript ion of the adverse event, time of onset, duration of event, treatment 
regimen instituted, any referral to ot her health care providers (if needed ), outcome, prognosis, and likely 
etiology. Habitual visual acuity will  be recorded prior to the report of an adverse event (as part of the 
examination), upon report of the subject's report of the adverse event, and after the adverse event has 
resolved. All adverse events will be followed  in accordance with standard of care. 
The Investigator will evaluate adverse events to ensu re the events are categorized correctly. Elements of 
categorization will include (definitio ns provided in following section): 
• Causality - i.e. the relationship between the test lens and the adverse event (not related; doubtful; 
possible; probable; very likely) 
• Severity - i.e. the degree of intensity of  the adverse event (mild, moderate, severe) 
Adverse Event (AE) Definitions 
An AE is any untoward (unwanted) medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a test lens, if caused by the test lens. An  AE can therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign 
(including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease te mporally associated with the use of the test lens if 
related to the test lens. 
An AE includes any condition (includi ng a pre-existing condition) that: 1) was not present prior to study 
treatment, but appeared or reappeared  following initiation of study trea tment; or 2) was present prior to 
study treatment but worsened during study treatment.  This would include any condition resulting from 
concomitant illnesses, reactions to concomitant medica tions, or progression of disease states. Pregnancy 
should be documented as an adverse event and should be  reported to the clinical monitor and to the Sponsor 
immediately upon learning of the event. 
Causality Assessment 
A determination of the relationship between an adverse ev ent and the test lens. The test lens relationship for 
each adverse event should be determined by  the investigator using these explanations: 
Not Related 
An adverse event that is not related to the use of the test lens. 
Doubtful 
An adverse event for which an alternative explanat ion is more likely, e.g.  concomitant treatment, 
concomitant disease(s), or the relationship of time suggests that a causal relationship is not likely. 
 
7 
 Possible 
An adverse event that might be due to the use of the test lens. An altern ative explanation, e.g. 
concomitant treatment, concomitant disease(s), is inco nclusive. The relationship in time is reasonable. 
Therefore, the causal relati onship cannot be excluded. 
Probable 
An adverse event that might be due to the use of the test lens. The relationship in time is suggestive 
(e.g. confirmed by de-challe nge). An alternative explanation is le ss likely, e.g. concomitant treatment 
or concomitant disease(s). 
Very Likely 
An adverse event that is listed as a possible ad verse effect (device) and cannot be reasonably 
explained by an alternative explan ation, e.g. concomitant treatment of concomitant disease(s). The 
relationship in time is very suggestive, ex: it  is confirmed by de-cha llenge and re-challenge. 
Severity Assessment 
A qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an  adverse event as determined by the investigator or 
reported to him/her by the subject. The assessment of severity is made irresp ective of test lens relationship or 
seriousness of the event and should be ev aluated according to the following scale: 
Mild  
Event is noticeable to the subject but is easily tole rated and does not interfere with the subject's daily 
activities. These conditions are us ually asymptomatic and usually do not warrant discontinuation 
(temporary or permanent) of the test lens. Nonetheless, the Investigator may choose to treat the 
condition as a precautionary measure.  
Diagnoses and conditions that are considered Mild Adverse Events include the following: 
• Non-significant Infiltrative Event 
• Contact Lens Papillary Conjunctivitis 
• Superficial Punctate Keratitis 
• Conjunctivitis: Bacterial, Viral, Allergic 
• Blepharitis 
• Meibomianitis 
• Contact Dermatitis 
• Localized Allergic Reactions 
• Any corneal event not explicitly define d as serious or significant adverse 
event, which necessitates temporar y lens discontinuation < 2 weeks 
Moderate 
Event is bothersome, possible requiri ng additional therapy, and may in terfere with the subject's daily 
activities. Those events that are usually sympto matic and warrant disconti nuation (temporary or 
permanent) of the test lens (exc luding Serious Adverse Events).  
Diagnoses and conditions that are considered Moderate Adverse Events include the following: 
• Contact Lens Induced Pe ripheral Ulcer (CLPU) 
• Significant Infiltrative Events (SIE) 
• Superior Epithelial Arcuate Lesions (SEALs) 
• Any Temporary Loss of 2 Lines of BSCVA 
• Other grade 3 or higher corneal findi ngs, such as abrasions or edema 
• Any corneal event which necessitates temporary lens discontinuation for ≥ 2 
weeks 
• Non-contact-lens-related-corne al-events – ex: EKC (Epidemic 
Keratoconjunctivitis) 
 
8 
 • Asymptomatic Corneal Scar 
 
Severe 
Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy and interferes with the 
subject's daily activities. A serious AE is any untoward medical occurrence that: 
• Results in death 
• Is life threatening 
• Requires in-patient hospitalization or pr olongation of existing hospitalization 
• Results in persistent or sign ificant disability/incapacity 
• Has potential to cause permanent impairment of a body function 
• Has potential to cause damage to a body structure and may necessitate 
medical or surgical intervention 
Diagnoses and conditions that are consid ered Serious Adverse Events include: 
• Microbial Keratitis (MK) 
• Iritis 
• Permanent decrease in best spectacle co rrected visual acuity equivalent to 2 
acuity lines or greater 
• Central Corneal Opacity 
• Central Corneal Neovascularization 
• Uveitis 
• Endophthalmitis 
• Hypopyon 
• Hyphemia 
• Penetration of Bowman's Membrane 
• Persistent Epithelial Defect 
• Limbal cell damage leadin g to conjunctivalization 
 
Upon finding an adverse event, the Principal Investigator will document the condition on the 
follow-up visit examination form using photos or dr awings (where appropriate) that detail size, 
location, and depth. He/she will al so complete the Adverse Event Classification (AEC) Discovery Form.  
Adverse Event Follow-up 
It is the Investigator's responsibility to maintain do cumentation of each reported  adverse event. All adverse 
events will be followed in accordance  with standard of care. Such docu mentation will include the following: 
• Diagnosis 
• A description of the adverse event or ocular complication 
• Detailed drawings or photographs, when appropriate 
• Time of onset 
• Duration of event 
• Treatment regimen instituted, in accordance with state/national licensing requirements 
• Any referral to another health care provider if needed 
• Outcome, ocular damage (if any) 
• Likely etiology 
• Best corrected visual acuity at  the discovery of the event and upon conclusion of the event 
Subjects who present with an adverse event should be fo llowed by the Investigator, within licensure, until all 
signs and symptoms have returned to pre-treatment stat us, stabilized, or been sati sfactorily explained. If 
further treatment (i.e. beyond licensure) is required, the patient will be referr ed to the appropriate health care 
provider. The Investigator should use his/her clinical judgment as to whether a subject reporting with an 
 
9 
 adverse event should continue in the study. If a subj ect is discontinued from th e study, it will be the 
responsibility of the Investigator to record the reason  for discontinuation. The inve stigator will also complete 
the Adverse Event Classification (AEC) Outcome Form. 
Adverse Event Reporting Timeline 
The investigator will notify the Sponsor of an adverse event by e-mail, facsimile, or telephone as soon as 
possible and no later than 24 hours from discovery of a serious adverse event, and no later than 3 working 
days from discovery of any non-seri ous potentially related adverse event.  In addition, the study Sponsor will 
submit notification to the IRB according to their requirements. Such a report should comment on whether the 
adverse event was considered test lens related. 
All adverse events will be recorded on the Adverse Event Classification (AEC) Outcome Form and evaluated by 
the investigator – see appendix, page 12. 
Serious Adverse Events: 
The Investigator will inform the sponsor of all serious adverse events occurring during the study 
period as soon as possible by e-mail, fax, or tele phone, but no later than 24  hours following discovery 
of the event. All subjects experiencing a seriou s adverse event must be followed and all outcomes 
must be reported. 
In the event of a serious adverse event, the investigator must: 1. Notify the Sponsor immediately 
2. Obtain and maintain in the subj ect's file all pertinent medical records, information, medical 
judgment and follow-up of the subject 
3. Provide the Sponsor with a complete case history which includes a statement as to whether the 
event was or was not related to the us e of the investigational test lens 
4. Notify the IRB as required by the IRB reportin g procedure and by fede ral, state and local 
regulations 
Non-Serious Adverse Events: 
All non-serious adverse events will  be reported to the sponsor no later than 3 working days from 
discovery for review by the sponsor’s medical officer. 
Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE): 
In the event of an Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse De vice Effect (UADE), the Investigator will submit a 
report of the UADE to the Sponsor and IRB as soon as  possible, but no later than 10 working days after 
the Investigator first learns of the effect. 
The Sponsor must conduct an evaluation of the UADE and must report the results of the evaluation to 
FDA, the IRB and participating investigators within 10 working days after the Sponsor first receives 
notification of the effect. 
 
Protocol Deviations 
In the event of an unintentional protocol deviation, th e Investigator will notify the sponsor’s Chief Medical 
Officer who will decide whether the deviation was signif icant enough to notify the IRB. No changes in the 
protocol can be put into effect with out prior authorization by the IRB unl ess the change is required to reduce 
the risk or eliminate immediate hazard to the study subjects. This includes all advertising for subject 
recruitment which must be approved by the IRB prior to dissemination.

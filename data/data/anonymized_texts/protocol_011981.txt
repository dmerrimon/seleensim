Short Protocol Title:   Long- term Safety Follow -up of Subjects With Giant Cell Tumor of 
Bone Treated With Denosumab in Study 20062004 
Study Phase:   Phase 4 
Indication:   Giant Cell Tumor of Bone  
Rationale 
XGEVA (denosumab) was approved in the United States, Canada, European Union, 
Australia,  and other countries for the treatment of giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB)  
largely based on results from ongoing Study  20062004.  Study  20062004 is an 
open- label, single -arm trial where subjects with GCTB are treated with denosumab 
120 mg every 4 weeks.  For subjects with surgically salvageable disease, treatment 
continued until surgery for complete resection and for approximately 6 months 
post-surgery.  For subjects with surgically unsalvageable disease, treatment continued 
as long as there was investigator -determined clinical benefit.  Study  20062004 will 
continue until all subjects enrolled in the initial phase of the study complete at least 
5 years of follow -up on study.  Enrollment in the initial phase of Study  20062004 
concluded in November 2012; therefore, the study ended in May 2018.   
Study 20140114 will continue to follow subjects with GCTB who were treated in 
Study  20062004 for an additional 5 or more years  of long- term safety follow -up.

CONFIDENTIAL    Overall Design 
This prospective study will provide long -term safety follow -up for subjects who complete 
Study  20062004 and consent to enroll in Study 20140114.  The subject’s follow -up 
begins after signing the informed consent form (ICF)  and continues through the earliest 
date of:  5 years after the subject enrolled signs the ICF, death, withdrawal of consent, or 
lost to follow -up.  Study assessments are to be completed every 6 months (±  30 days).  
End of study (EO S) visits for all patients will be at 5 years; Cohort A subjects on 
investigational product will have an EOS visit conducted 30  days following the 
last dose of investigational product  (end of treatment [ EOT] visit)  if receiving 
investigational product at the 5 year time point . 
Subjects who are still being treated with denosumab when 20062004 completes  can 
continue receiving open- label denosumab at dose of 120 mg subcutaneously every 
4 weeks.   Collection of long -term safety information will include the following adverse 
events of interest:  osteonecrosis of the jaw, malignancy (including malignancy in 
GCTB ), atypical femoral fracture, hypocalcemia, hypercalcemia following treatment 
discontinuation, and pregnancy and lactation (if occurring  on treatment or within 
5 months of last dose of denosumab).  Additionally, all treatment -emergent adverse 
events and serious adverse events will be collected.   
Number of Subjects 
The number of subjects in this study will be determined by the number of subjects 
completing Study  20062004 who are willing to enroll in this study for long -term safety 
follow -up.  It is estimated that this will be approximately 100 to 300 subjects.   
Summary of Subject Eligibility Criteria  
All subjects from Study  20062004 who agree to participate in this study and sign the ICF 
will be considered enrolled.   
For a full list of eligibility criteria, please refer to Section 6.1  and Section 6.2. 
Treatments 
For subjects receiving denosumab:  
Denosumab will be supplied as a sterile, clear, colorless to slightly yellow, 
preservative- free liquid, in single -use 3.0 mL glass vials containing a deliverable dose of 
1.7 mL.  Denosumab will be administered as a subcutaneous ( SC) injection 120 mg 
every 4 weeks.   A planned dose may be given up to 7 days before the scheduled visit, 
as long as there are at least 21 days between doses.  If a planned dose is delayed more 
than 7 calendar days, it will be considered a missed dose and recorded as such on the 
electronic case report form.  If a subject  undergoes retreatment with denosumab, 
they will receive denosumab as a SC injection 120 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 28, 
then every 4 weeks subsequently.  
All subjects receiving denosumab should be adequately supplemented with calcium and 
vitamin D (at least 500 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D), except in the case of 
pre-existing hypercalcemia.  
Proc edures 
Written informed consent must be obtained from all subjects before any study -specific 
procedures are performed.  The following key procedures will occur per the Schedule of 
Activities  (Table 2-1):  collection of  disease status, GCTB interventions , review of 
adverse events  of interest, serious adverse events , and treatment -emergent adverse 
events.

CONFIDENTIAL    For a full list of study procedures, including the timing of each procedure, please refer to 
Section 9.2 and the Schedule of Activities in Table 2-1. 
Statistical Considerations 
The number of subjects in this study will be determined by the  number of subjects 
completing Study  20062004 who are willing to enroll in this study for long -term safety 
follow -up.  It is estimated that this will be approximately 100 to 300 subjects.  
Treatment -emergent adverse event will be summarized for all subjects who receive at 
least 1 dose of denosumab during this study .  Serious adverse event and  adverse event 
of interests will be summarized for all subjects who have signed the ICF and enrolled.  
Exposure- adjusted event s of interest will be summarized.  
For a full description of statistical analysis methods, please refer to Section  10.

n For subjects in Cohort A only and subjects from Cohort B who resume treatment with denosumab for disease recurrence:  product complaints as defined in 
Section 7.1.6 will be collected at each Q6M  visit and recorded from signing of the ICF through the EOT visit. 
o For subjects in Cohort A only and subjects from Cohort B who resume treatment with denosumab for disease recurrence: treatment -emergent adverse events will be 
collected at each Q6M visit and recorded from the first dose of denosumab through the last EOT visit.  
p For subjects in Cohort A only and subjects from Cohort  B who resume treatment with denosumab for disease recurrence:   subjects will receive denosumab 120 mg 
subcutaneous Q4W until confirmation of disease progression , the subject’s decision to discontinue for any reason, or any other reason listed in Section 8.1.  The 
planned dose may be given up to 7 days before the scheduled visit, as long as there are at least 21 days between doses.  If a planned dose is delayed more than 
7 days, it will be considered a missed dose and recorded as such on the eCRF.  For subjects in Cohort A who were receiving deno sumab in 20062004, and continue 
to receive denosumab in this study:  denosumab will commence at the next scheduled Q4W visit (with at least 21 days from the last dose of denosumab received in 
the 20062004 study).  Denosumab administration dates will be collected for all subjects receiving denosumab, including Cohort  B subjects who resume treatment 
after disease recurrence.  If the subject has discontinued denosumab, stop date and reason for discontinuation will be documented.  
q All subjects receiving denosumab should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D (at least 500 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D), except in the 
case of pre-existing hypercalcemia.  
r Retreatment with denosumab is permitted for subjects who demonstrated a previous response to denosumab (eg, in the case of recurrent disease while subject is in 
the safety follow -up).  Eligibility criteria for retreatment are outlined in Section 7.4.1.   Refer to Section 7.1.1 for information on additional  dose s. 
s No study assessments are required during the Q4W dosing visits unless the visits coincide with the timing of the Q6M  follow -up study visit s.

120 mg every 4 weeks.  For subjects with surgically salvageable disease, treatment 
continued until surgery for complete resection  and for approximately 6 months 
post-surgery.  For subjects with surgically unsalvageable disease, treatment continued 
as long as there was investigator -determined clinical benefit.  Study  20062004 will 
continue until all subjects enrolled in the initial phase of the study complete at least 
5 years of follow -up on study.  Enrollment in the initial phase of Study  20062004 
concluded in November 2012; therefore, the study ended in May 2018.   
Study 20140114 will continue to follow subjects with GCTB who were treated in Study  20062004 for an additional 5 or more  years  of long- term safety follow -up.   
3.2 Background 
3.2.1  Disease 
Giant cell tumor of bone is a rare disease characterized clinically by relentlessly 
expansive osteolytic lesions usually located at the epiphyses of long bones.  GCTB has 2 components:   a mononuclear stromal cell matrix and dispersed multinuclear giant 
cells.  The mononuclear stro mal cells express receptor activator of nuclear factor 
kappa -B ligand (RANKL); its receptor, RANK, is expressed on the multinuclear giant 
cells.  The RANK/RANKL pathway is an essential mediator of osteoclast function, formation and survival.     
3.2.2  Amgen Investigational Product Background :  Denosumab 
Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to RANKL, inhibits osteoclast ‑mediated 
bone destruction and has been shown to provide therapeutic benefit for patients with 
GCTB.   
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of 
denosumab can be found in Denosumab Investi gator’s Brochure/ XGEVA package

4.2 Hypotheses  
This study is descriptive in nature and does not involve testing formal hypotheses.   
5. Study Design 
5.1 Overall Design  
This prospective study will provide long -term safety follow -up for subjects who complete 
Study  20062004 and consent to enroll in Study 20140114.  As Study  20062004 nears its 
end of study (EOS) date, subjects in Study  20062004 will be offered to roll -over into 
Study 20140114.  Study assessments are to  be completed every 6 months (±  30 days).  
The subject’s follow -up begins after signing the informed consent form ( ICF) and 
continues through the earliest date of: 5 years after the last subject enrolled signs the 
ICF, death, withdrawal of consent, or los t to follow -up.  Study assessments are detailed 
in the Table 2-1.   
There will be 2 cohorts in this study:  
Cohort A:   subjects who were receiving denosumab at the conclusion of Study  20062004 
can continue receiving denosumab at the current dose and schedule at the investigator’s 
discretion.  All subjects should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D 
(at least 500  mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D), except in the case of pre- existing 
hypercalcemia.  Follow -up study visits will be performed  in clinic every 6  months 
(± 30 days) while receiving denosumab.  Subjects who discontinue denosumab will have

CONFIDENTIAL    an end of treatment  (EOT)  in-person clinic visit approximately 30 days  (± 8 days) after 
the last dose of denosumab.  Thereafter, they will enter the long-term safety follow -up 
and will be monitored as per Cohort B requirements .  In addition to the EOT, all subjects 
should be monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of hyperc alcemia  
following discontinuation of investigational product ( IP).  Investigators are advised to 
includ e assessment of serum calcium (eg, every 2 to 3 months for approximately 1 year) 
as clinic ally indicated following IP treatment discontinuation or interruption.   The calcium 
and vitamin D supplementation following discontinuation of IP should also be 
re-evaluated.   When investigational product  is discontinued, the investigator 
should evaluate the individual subject’s risk for vertebral fragility fractures.  
Subjects with a high risk for fragility fracture (eg, history of osteoporosis, postmenopausal status, prior fracture history), should be monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of vertebral fractures following discontinuation of denosum ab. 
Cohort B:   subjects who completed denosumab  treatment in 20062004 and were in the 
safety follow -up at the conclusion of 20062004 will continue in long-term safety follow -up 
in this study.  Follow -up study visits  will be done every 6  months (± 30 days) either via 
telephone or in-person clinic visit.  If subjects have completed denosumab treatment less 
than a year before enrolling in Study 20140114, they should be monitored for development of signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia. 
Retreatment  with denosumab (120 mg subcutaneous [ SC] on days 1, 8, 15, and  28, 
then every 4 weeks  subsequently ) is allowed for subjects who previously demonstrated 
a response to denosumab and have experienced disease recurrence while in long- term 
safety follow -up at the investigator’s discretion.  If more than 12 months have elapsed 
since the last denosumab therapy, biopsy confirmation of disease for further pathologic 
evaluation of the recurrence is required.  Once denosumab treatment is resumed, the 
investigator  must follow the safety reporting requirements as outlined for Cohort A.   
For Cohorts A and B :  laboratory assessments are not mandated by the study and will 
be performed at the investigator’s discretion as part of the standard of care or as 
clinically indicated.   Investigators are advised to monitor all subjects for the development 
of signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia  and to consider periodic  assessment of serum 
calcium (eg, every 2 to 3 months for approximately 1 year) as clinically indicated 
following IP treatment discontinuation or interruption.

subjects within 3 months  of site initiation may be closed.  
5.3 End of Study  
5.3.1  End of Study Definition  
Primary Completion:  The primary completion date is defined as the date when the last 
subject is assessed or receives an intervention for the final collection of data for the 
primary endpoint, for the purposes of conducting the primary analysis, whether the study 
concluded as  planned in the protocol or was terminated early.  
The primary completion date is the date when the last subject has completed the 
assessments for  5 years of follow -up.   
If the study concludes prior to the primary completion date originally planned in the 
protocol (ie, early termination of the study), then the primary completion will be the date when the last subject is assessed or receives an intervention for evaluation in the study (ie, last subject last visit).  
End of Study :  The EOS  date is defined as the date when the last subject across all 
sites is assessed or receives an intervention for evaluation in the study (ie, last subject 
last visit), following any additional parts in the study (eg, long -term follow -up), as 
applicable.

CONFIDENTIAL    The subject or the subject’s legally acceptable representative must personally sign and 
date the IRB/IEC and Amgen approved informed consent before commencement of  
study -specific procedures . 
A subject is considered enrolled when the investigator decides that the subject has met 
all eligibility criteria.  The investigator is to document this decision and date, in the 
subject’s medical record and in/on the enrollment case repor t form (CRF).  
Each enrolled subject receives a unique subject identification number before any 
study -related activities/procedures are performed.  The subject identification number will 
be assigned via Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) .  This number  will be used 
to identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study 
documentation related to that subject. 
The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, including if a subject is 
rescreened .

CONFIDENTIAL    8. Discontinuation Criteria 
Subjects have the right to withdraw from denosumab treatment , protocol procedures, or 
the study as a whole at any time and for any reason without prejudice to their future 
medical care by the physician or at the institution.  
The investigator and/or sponsor can decide to withdraw a subject(s ) from denosumab 
treatment , protocol  procedures, or the study as a whole at any time prior to study 
completion for the reasons listed in Sections  8.1, 8.2.1 , and 8.2.2 . 
8.1 Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
Subjects (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving 
denosumab at any time during the study but continue participation in the study.  If this 
occurs, or if the subject discontinues denosumab treatment for any reason 
(eg, investigator decision or adverse event [ AE]), the investigator is to discuss with the 
subject the appropriate processes for discontinuation from denosumab , including 
counseling  the subject on signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia,  and if clinically 
indicated, as sessment of serum calcium,  and must discuss with the subject the 
possibilities for continuation of the Schedule of Activities (see Table 2 -1) including 
different options of follow -up (eg, in person, by phone/mail, through family/friends, in 
correspondence/communication with other treating physicians, from the review of medical records) and collection of data, including endpoints, adverse events, and must 
document this decision in the subject’s medical records.   When investigational product  
is discontinued, the investigator should evaluate the individual subject’s risk for 
vertebral fragility fractures.  Subjects with a high risk for fragility fracture (eg, history of osteoporosis, postmenopausal status, prior fracture history), should be monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of vertebral f ractures 
following discontinuation of denosumab.  Subjects who have discontinued 
denosumab should not be automatically removed from the study.  Whenever safe and 
feasible, it is imperative that subjects remain on- study to ensure safety surveillance 
and/or collection of outcome data.  
Subjects may be eligible for continued treatment with Amgen investigational product(s) and/or other protocol -required therapies by a separate protocol or as provided for by the 
local country’s regulatory mechanism, based on parameters consistent with Appendix 3.

8.2 Discontinuation From the Study  
Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive 
further protocol- required therapies or procedures, and the subject does not wish to or is 
unable to continue further study participation.  Subject data up to withdrawal of consent 
will be included in the analysis of the study, and where permitted, publically available data can be included after withdrawal of consent.  The investigator is to discuss with the subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study, and must document the 
subject’s decision to withdraw in the subject’s medical recor ds. 
Refer to the Schedule of Activities  for data to be collected at the time of study 
discontinuation and follow -up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed.

CONFIDENTIAL    The following actions must be taken if a subject fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact the subject and reschedule the missed visit as soon 
as possible and counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned 
visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to and/or is able to 
continue in the study.  
• In cases in which the subject is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or 
designee must make every effort to regain contact with the subject (where possible, 
3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the subject’s last known 
mailing address or local equivalent methods).  These contact attempts are to be 
documented in the subject’s medical record. 
• If the subject continues to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost  to follow -up.  
 
9. Study Assessments and Procedures  
Study procedures and their time points are summarized in the Schedule of Activities (see Table 2 -1).  
As protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed, if an enrolled subject is subsequently  
determined to be ineligible for the study, th is must be discussed with the sponsor 
immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the subject is to continue or discontinue study treatment.  
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of Activities, is essential and required for study conduct.  
9.1 General Study Periods  
9.1.1  Enrollment  
Informed consent must be obtained before completing any assessments detailed in the  
Schedule of Activities (Table 2-1).  If subjects are continuing on denosumab from the 
Study 20062004 (Cohort A), the informed consent must be signed prior to administration 
of denosumab in this study.   
9.1.2  Treatment Period  
Cohort A  subjects can  continue receiving denosumab at the investigator’s discretion.  
Denosumab will commence at the next scheduled every -4-week  visit (with at least 
21 days from the last dose of denosumab received in the 20062004 study ).  Cohort B 
subjects who enter retreatment only  may also receive denosumab at the investigato r’s 
discretion.   All dosing  and follow -up study visits will be scheduled based on the day  1 
date defined as the date the ICF is signed.  Dosing visits will occur every 4 weeks, per 
the Schedule of Activities ( Table 2-1).  Follow -up study visits will be performed in clinic

CONFIDENTIAL    every 6 months (± 30 days).  No safety assessments are required during the 
every -4-week  dosing visits unless the visits coincide with the timing of the follow -up 
study  visit.  
9.1.3  End-of-treatment Visit  
Cohort A and Cohort B subjects who enter retreatment only:  upon discontinuation from  
denosumab for any reason, an EOT in-person clinic visit will be performed approximately 
30 days  (± 8 days) after the last dose  of denosumab.    
Thereafter, they will enter the long-term safety follow -up. 
In addition to the EOT visit , all subjects stopping denosumab should be monitored for the 
development of signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia following discontinuation of IP.  
Investigators are advised to includ e assessment of serum calcium (eg, every 2  to 
3 months for approximately 1 year ) as clinically ind icated following IP treatment 
discontinuation or interruption.  If denosumab treatment is discontinued or interrupted, 
the calcium and vitamin D supplementation should also be re- evaluated. 
9.1.4  Long- term Safety Follow -up 
Cohort B:  subjects who completed denosumab treatment in Study 20062004 and were 
in the safety follow -up at the conclusion of Study 20062004 will continue in long- term 
safety follow -up in this study.  If subjects have completed denosumab treatment less 
than a year before enrolling in Study  20140114, they should be monitored for the 
development of signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia with serum calcium assessments 
as clinically indicated.  Study assessments  during follow -up study  visits  in long- term 
safety follow -up will be completed per the Schedule of Activities (Table 2-1) every 
6 months (±  30 days) either via telephone or in-person clinic visit .  An EOS  visit should 
be performed 5 years after signing of the ICF.  
Cohort A  and Cohort B subjects who enter retreatment only :  subjects will enter 
long-term safety follow -up after the EOT visit and will be monitored per Cohort B 
requirements.  Subjects receiving investigational product  5 years after signing of 
the ICF, should undergo an in- person clinic, combined EOT and EOS visit 30 days 
following the last dose of investigational product . 
9.1.5  End of Study  
End of study will occur when one of the following happens: the last subject enrolled has 
had the opportunity to complete 5 years of follow -up, death, withdrawal of consent, or 
lost to follow -up, whichever comes  first.

records  
• pregnancy and lactation (if occurring on treatment or within 5 months of last dose of 
denosumab) :  pregnancy and lactation notification worksheets ( Appendix 5 ) 
Adverse events of interest will be collected and recorded from the signing of the ICF 
through the EOS  visit.   
9.2.3.1.1.3  Serious Adverse Events 
For all subjects (Cohorts A and B):  the investig ator is responsible for ensuring that all 
serious adverse events  observed by the investigator or reported by the subject that 
occur after signing of the informed consent through EOS visit are reported using the 
Event CRF . 
For all subjects who experienced a  treatment gap of more than 30 days between 
the EOS visit of Study 20062004 and signing the ICF for Study 20140114, all 
serious adverse events and/or events of interest observed by the investigator or 
reported by the subject that occurred in that period must be reported using the electronic case report form ( eCRF ).  Events of interest include:  
• ONJ 
• malignancy, including malignancy in GCTB  
• AFF 
• hypocalcemia (assessed per CTCAE criteria)  
• hypercalcemia following treatment discontinuation (assessed per CTCAE 
criteria)  
• pregnancy and lactation (if occurring on treatment or within 5 months of last dose of denosumab)  
All serious adverse events will be collected, recorded and reported to the sponsor or 
designee within 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 4
.  The investigator will submit any 
updated serious adverse event data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. 
9.2.3.1.1.4  Serious Adverse Events After the Protocol -required Reporting 
Perio d 
There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for serious adverse events following the EOS (ie, the  protocol -required reporting period ).  However, these serious adverse 
events can be reported to Amgen.  Per local requirements i n some countries, 
investigators are required to report serious adverse events that they become aware of 
after EOS .  If serious adverse events are reported, the investigator is to report them to 
Amgen within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event.

CONFIDENTIAL    Serious adverse events reported after EOS  will be captured within the safety database.  
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of adverse events and 
serious adverse events and the procedures for completing and transmitting serious 
adverse event reports are provided in Appendix 4. 
9.2.3.1.2  Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse events and/or serious 
adverse events.  Open- ended and non -leading verbal questioning of the subject is the 
preferred method to inquire about adverse event  occurrence.  
9.2.3.1.3  Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Event s 
After the initial adverse event/serious adverse event report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each subject at subsequent visits/contacts.  All adverse events and serious adverse events will be followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 8.3).  
Further information on follow- up procedures is given in Appendix 4.  
All new information for previously reported serious adverse events must be sent to Amgen within 24 hours following knowledge of the new information.  If specifically requested, the investigator may need to provide additional follow -up information, such as 
discharge summaries, medical records, or extracts from the medical records.  
Information provided about the serious adverse event must be consistent with that 
recorded on the Event CRF. 
9.2.3.1.4  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events 
If subject is permanently withdrawn from denosumab because of a serious adverse 
event, this information must be submitted to Amgen.  
Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of serious adverse events is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities toward the safety of 
subjects and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met.  
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation.  The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs /IECs, and investigators.

CONFIDENTIAL    Individual  safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded 
to investigators as necessary.  
An investigator who receives an individual safety report describing a serious adverse 
event or other specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of serious adverse 
events) from the sponsor will file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify 
the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.   
9.2.3.1.5  Pregnancy and Lactation 
Details of all pregnancie s and/or lactation in female subjects  and female partners of 
male subjects  will be collected after the start of denosumab and until  5 months after the 
last dose of denosumab. 
If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator is to inform Amgen within 24 hours of learning 
of the pregnancy and/or lactation and is to follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 5.   
Amgen Global Patient Safety will follow -up with the investigator regarding additional 
information that may be requested.  
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth,  
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered serious adverse events.  
Further details regarding pregnancy and lactation are provided in Appendix 5.  
9.2.3.1.6  Adjudication Process for Suspected Osteonecrosis of the j aw and 
Suspected Atypical Femoral Fracture Adverse Events 
All subjects with an oral sign or symptom  suspicious for ONJ should be examined by a 
dentist or other qualified oral specialist (eg, oral surgeon).  All subjects presenting with new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain should be evaluated for a suspected adverse event of AFF. 
Adverse events reported as ONJ or AFF as well as adverse events identified by Amgen 
as potentially representing ONJ or AFF will be reviewed by an independent adjudication 
panel of experts to determine whether the pre- defined criteria for ONJ or AFF are met.  
Amgen will request the investigating site to provide all available source documents surrounding that event to be reviewed by the blinded adjudication committee.

CONFIDENTIAL    9.2.4  Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
Laboratory assessments , both on denosumab and following  discontinuation of 
denosumab are not required and will be performed at the investigator’s discretion as part 
of the standard of care or as clinically indicated.  Investigators are advised to include 
assessments of serum calcium (eg, every 2 to 3  months fo r approximately 1 year) as 
clinically indicated following IP treatment discontinuation or interruption  (Appendix 2). 
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and recording any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the Event CRF.  The investigator 
must determine whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a 
clinically significant change  from the subject’s baseline values ( Appendix 4 ).  In general, 
abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's 
judgment) are not to be recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value 
changes that require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable, clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse event.    
9.2.4.1  Pregnancy Testing 
On-treatment pregnancy testing may be performed at the investigator’s discretion or as 
required per local laws and regulations . 
9.2.5  Other Assessments  
9.2.5.1  Giant Cell Tumor of Bone Status Assessments 
The following GCTB disease status assessments will be collected: 
• disease progression  
• disease recurrence  
• GCTB interventions, including surgery, embolization, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy   
10. Statistical Considerations 
10.1 Sample Size Determination  
The number of subjects in this study will be determined by the number of subjects 
completing Study  20062004, and who are willing to enroll in this study for long- term 
safety follow -up.  It is estimated that this will be approximately 100 to 300 subjects.  
For the expected sample size of 100 to 300 subjects, the 95% confidence interval (CI) 
based on exact method for the incidence rate of a particular adverse event is calculated 
below ( Table 10-1 ).  If none of the subjects report a particular adverse event then a true 
incidence rate of more than 3.6% for 100 subjects and more than 1.2% for 300 subjects 
is unlikely for that particular adverse event.

the protocol or other adverse event reports received from Amgen, in accordance with 
local procedures . 
• Overall conduct of the study at the site and adherence to requirements of Title 21 of 
the United States  Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), ICH guidelines, the IRB/IEC, 
and all oth er applicable local regulations . 
Recruitment Procedures 
This is a roll- over study, and no specific recruitment procedures are required.  
Informed Consent Process 
An initial sample ICF is provided for the investigator to prepare the informed consent 
document to be used at his or her site.  Updates to the sample ICF are to be 
communicated formally in writing from the Amgen  Trial Manager to the investigator.  The 
written ICF is to be prepared in the language(s) of the potential patient population.  
The investigator or his/her delegated representative will  explain to the subject, or his/her 
legally authorized representative, the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential 
hazards of the study before any protocol -specific procedures or any investigational 
product(s) is/are administered, and answer all  questions regarding the study.   
Subjects must be informed that their participation is voluntary.  Subjects or their legally authorized representative defined as an individual or other body authorized under 
applicable law to consent, on behalf of a prospective subject, to the subject’s 
participation in the clinical study  will then be required to sign a statement of informed 
consent that meets the requirements of 21 CFR 50, local regulations, ICH guidelines, The Health Insurance Portability and Accountabili ty Act requirements, where applicable, 
and the IRB/IEC or study site.  
The medical record must include a statement that written informed consent was obtained before the subject was enrolled in the study and the date the written consent was obtained.  The authorized person obtaining the informed consent must also sign the ICF. 
The investigator is also responsible for asking the subject if the subject has a primary 
care physician and if the subject agrees to have his/her primary care physician informed 
of the subject’s participation in the clinical study  unless it is a local requirement.  The 
investigator shall then inform the primary care physician.  If the subject agrees to such notification,  the investigator is to inform the subject’s primary care physician of the 
subject’s participation in the clinical study.  If the subject does not have a primary care

CONFIDENTIAL    physician and the investigator will be acting in that capacity, the investigator is to 
document such i n the subject’s medical record.  
The acquisition of informed consent and the subject’s agreement or refusal of his/her 
notification of the primary care physician is to be documented in the subject’s medical 
records, and the ICF is to be signed and personally dated by the subject or a legally 
acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the informed consent 
discussion.   Subject withdrawal of consent or discontinuation from study treatment 
and/or procedures must also be documented in the subject’s medical records; refer to 
Section 8. 
Subjects must be re- consented to the most current version of the ICF(s) during t heir 
participation in the study .  
The original signed ICF is to be retained in accordance with institutional policy, and a 
copy of the ICF(s) must be provided to the subject or the subject’s legally authorized 
representative.  
If a potential subject is illiterate or visually impaired and does not have a legally acceptable representative, the investigator must provide an impartial witness to read the 
ICF to the subject and must allow for questions.  Thereafter, both the subject and the 
witness must sign the ICF to attest that informed consent was freely given and 
understood.  (Refer to ICH GCP guideline, Section 4.8.9.)  
Data Protection/Subject Confidentiality  
The investigator must ensure that the subject’s confidentiality is maintained for 
documents submitted to Amgen.  
Subject will be assigned a unique identifier by the sponsor.  Any subject records or datasets that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the identifier only; subject names  
or any information which would make the subject identifiable will not be transferred.   
On the CRF demographics page, in addition to the unique subject identification number,  
include the age at time of enrollment.  
For serious adverse events reported to Amgen, subjects are to be identified by their 
unique subject identification number, initials (for faxed reports, in accordance with local 
laws and regulations), and age (in accordance with local laws and regulations).

CONFIDENTIAL    Source Documents 
The investigator is to maintain a list of appropriately qualified persons to whom he/she 
has delegated study duties.  All persons authorized to make entries and/or corrections 
on CRFs will be included on the Amgen Delegation of Authority Form.  
Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the subject and substantiate the integrity of the data collected.  Source documents are filed at the investigator’s site.  
Source documents are original documents, data, and records from which the subject’s CRF data are obtained.  These include but are not limited to hospital records, clini cal 
and office charts, laboratory and pharmacy records, diaries, microfiches, radiographs, and correspondence.  Source documents may also include data captured in the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS)  system (if used, such as subject 
identification  and randomization number) and CRF entries if the CRF is the site of the 
original recording (ie, there is no other written or electronic record of data, such as paper questionnaires for a clinical outcome assessment). 
Data reported on the CRF or entered in the electronic CRF that are transcribed from 
source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained.  The investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study.  Also, current medical records must be available.

CONFIDENTIAL    Appendix 4.  Safety Events:  Definitions  and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -up and Reporting  
Definition of Adverse Event  
Adverse Event Definition 
• An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject 
irrespective of a causal relationship with the study treatment.   
• Note :  an adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or 
exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a treatment, combination 
product, medical device or procedure. 
 
Events Meeting the Adverse Event  Definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) 
or other safety assessments (eg, electrocardiogram , radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from prior results , that are considered 
clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator 
(ie, not related to progression of underlying disease). 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medication.  Overdose per se will not be reported as 
an adverse event/serious adverse event unless it is an intentional overdose taken 
with possible suicidal/self -harming intent.  Such overdoses are to be reported 
regardless of sequelae.  
• For situations when an adverse event or serious adverse event is due to  giant cell 
tumor of bone , report all known signs and symptoms.  Death due to disease 
progression in the absence of signs and symptoms should be reported as the 
primary tumor type (eg,  metastatic pancreatic cancer).  Note: t he term “disease 
progression” should not be used to describe the disease- related event or adverse 
event.  
• “Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be 
reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event.  Such instances will be 
captured in the efficacy assessments.  However, the signs, symptoms, and/or 
clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as adverse event or 
serious adverse event if they fulfill the definition of an adverse event or serious 
adverse event.

Protocol Number:  20140114  
Date:   23 August 2018  Page 51 of 65 
 
CONFIDENTIAL    Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy) : the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the adverse event.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital). 
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A Serious Adverse Event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that 
meets at  least 1 of the following serious criteria : 
• Results in death (fatal)  
• Immediately  life-threatening  
The term “life- threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. 
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation 
and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or 
outpatient setting.  Complications that occur during hospitalization are an adverse 
event.  If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, 
the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was 
necessary, the adverse event is to be considered serious.  
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre- existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an adverse event. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent 
everyday l ife functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.

CONFIDENTIAL    • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Other me dically important serious event  
Medical or scientific judgment is to be exercised in deciding whether serious adverse 
event reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that 
may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of 
the other outcomes listed in the above definition.  These events are typically to be 
considered serious.  
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.  
Recording Ad verse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
Adverse Event  and Serious Adverse Event Recording  
• When an adverse event or serious adverse event occurs,  it is the responsibility of 
the investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, 
laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to the event.  
• The investigator will then record all relevant adverse event/serious adverse ev ent 
informatio n in the E vent case report form ( CRF). 
• The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
o adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or 
symptoms)  
o dates of onset and resolution (if resolved)  
o severity (or toxicity  defined below)  
o assessment of relatedness to  denosumab  
o action taken.  
• If the severity of an adverse event changes from the date of onset to the date of 
resolution, record as a single event with the worst severity on the Event CRF. 
• It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the subject’s 
medical records to  Amgen  in lieu of completion of the Event CRF page.  
• If specifically requested, the investigator may need to provide additional follow -up 
information, such as discharge summaries, medical records, or extracts from the 
medical records.  In this case, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the 
subject number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records befor e 
submission to Amgen . 
• The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the adverse event/serious 
adverse event.

CONFIDENTIAL    Evaluating Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
Assessment of Severity 
The investigator will make an assessment of severity  for each adverse event and 
serious adverse event reported during the study.  The assessment of  severity  will be 
based on:  
The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0 which is 
available at the following location:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 
Assessment of Causality  
• The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between denosumab and 
each occurrence of each adverse event/serious adverse event.  
• Relatedness means that there are facts or reasons to support a relationship 
between investigational product and the event . 
• The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. 
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other 
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment 
administr ation will be considered and investigated.  
• The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. 
• For each adverse event/serious adverse event, the investigato r must document  in 
the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the adverse event/serious adverse 
event and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There may be situations in which a serious adverse event has occurred and the 
investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report.  However, it is 
very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for 
every event before the initial transmission of the serious adverse event data.  
• The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality  in light of follow -up 
information and send a serious adverse event follow -up report with the updated 
causality assessment.  
• The causality assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.

Date:   23 August 2018  Page 54 of 65 
 
CONFIDENTIAL    Follow -up of Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event  
• The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by  
Amgen  to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the adverse event or serious 
adverse event as fully as possible.  This may include additional laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health 
care professionals.  
• If a subject is permanently withdrawn from denosumab because of a serious 
adverse event, this information must be submitted to Amgen.  
• For all deaths, available autopsy reports and relevant medical reports should be 
provided to Amgen .   
• New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed Event 
CRF. 
• The investigator will submit any updated serious adverse event data to Amgen  
within 24 hours of receipt of the information.  
Reporting of Serious Adverse Event  
Serious Adverse Event Reporting via Electronic Data Collection Tool  
• The primary mechanism for reporting serious adverse event will be the electronic 
data capture (EDC) system via the Safety Report Form.  
• If the EDC system is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will report 
the information to Amgen using an electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency 
Report Form ( see Figure 12-1 ) within 24 hours of  the investi gator’s knowledge of 
the event . 
• The site will enter the serious adverse event data into the electronic system as 
soon as it becomes available.  
• After the study is completed at a given site, the EDC system will be taken off -line 
to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
• If a site receives a report of a new serious adverse event from a study subject or 
receives updated data on a previously reported serious adverse event after the 
EDC has been taken off -line, then the site can re port this information on a paper 
Serious Adverse E vent Report Form (see Figure 12-1 ).

CONFIDENTIAL    Appendix 5.  Contraceptive Guidance and Collection of Pregnancy and Lactation 
Information  
Study -specific contraception requirements for female of childbearing potential  are 
outlined in Section 6.2. 
Female subjects of childbearing potential must receive pregnancy prevention counseling 
and be advised of the risk to the fetus if they become pregnant during treatment and for 
5 months after the last dose of denosumab. 
Additional medications given during the study may alter the contraceptive requirements.  
These additional medications may require female subjects to use highly effective methods of contraception and for an increased length of time.  In addition, male subjects may also be required to use contraception.  The investigator must discuss these 
contraceptive changes with the subject . 
Definition  of Females of Childbearing Potential  
A female  is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post menopausal 
unless permanently sterile.  Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.  
Females  in the Following Categories Are Not Considered F emale of Childbearing 
Potential : 
• premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
− documented hysterectomy ; 
− documented bilateral salpingectomy ; or 
− documented bilateral oophorectomy . 
Note :  site personnel documentation from the following sources is acceptable: 
1) review of subject’s medical records; 2) subject’s medical examination; or 
3) subject’s medical history interview . 
• premenarchal  female  
• postmenopausal female  
o A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause.  A high follicle stimulating hormone level in the 
postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in 
women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy 
(HRT).  However, in the absence of 12  months of amenorrhea, a single follicle 
stimulating hormone measurement is insufficient.  
o Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to 
use 1 of the non -hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to 
continue their HRT during the study.  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to 
allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment .

CONFIDENTIAL    Contracept ion Methods for Female Subjects  
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods  
Note:  failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.  
• combined (estrogen and progestogen  containing ) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, or transdermal)  
• progestogen- only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
(oral, injectable, implantable)  
• intrauterine device  
• intrauterine hormonal -releasing system  
• bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion 
• vasectomized partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the female 
subject of childbearing potential and that the vasectomized partner has received 
medical assessment of the surgical success)  
• sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the 
entire period of risk associated with the study treatments ; the reliability of sexual 
abstinence must be evaluated in relation to the duration of the trial and the preferred 
and usual lifestyle of the subject ) 
Unacceptable Methods of Birth Control for  Female Subjects 
Birth control methods that are considered unacceptable in clinical trials include:  
• periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods)  
• withdrawal (coitus interruptus)  
• spermicides only  
• lactational amenorrhoea method  
Collection of Pregnancy Information  
Female Subjects Who Become Pregnant  
• Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female subject who becomes 
pregnant while taking denosumab through 5 months of the last dose of denosumab. 
• Information will be recorded on the Pregnancy Notification Worksheet (see 
Figure  12-2).  The worksheet must be submitted to Amgen Global Patient Safety 
within 24  hours of learning of a subject’s pregnancy.  (Note:   sites are not required 
to provide any information on the Pregnancy Notification Worksheet that violates the 
country or regions local privacy laws.)  
• After obtaining the female subject’s signed authorization for release of pregnancy 
and infant health information, the investigator will collect pregnancy and infant 
health information and complete the pregnancy questionnaire for any female subject 
who becomes pregnant while taking denosumab  through 5 months after the last 
dose of denosumab.   This information will be forwarded to Amgen Global Patient 
Safety.  Generally, infant follow -up will be conducted up to 12  months after the birth 
of the child (if appli cable).

CONFIDENTIAL    • Any termination of pregnancy will be reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety, 
regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for 
procedure.  
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an adverse event or serious adv erse 
event, any pregnancy complication or report of a congenital anomaly or 
developmental delay, fetal death, or suspected adverse reactions in the neonate will 
be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event.  Note that an elective 
termination with no information on a fetal congenital malformation or maternal 
complication is generally not considered an adverse event, but still must be reported 
to Amgen as a pregnancy exposure case. 
• If the outcome of the pregnancy meets a criterion for immediate classification as a 
serious adverse event (eg, female subject experiences a spontaneous abortion, 
stillbirth, or neonatal death or there is a fetal or neonatal congenital anomaly) the 
investigator will report the event as a serious adverse event. 
• Any serious adverse event occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy which is 
considered reasonably related to the study treatment by the investigator, will be 
reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety as described in Appendi x 4.  While the 
investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study 
subjects, he or she may learn of a serious adverse event through spontaneous 
reporting.  
• Any f emale subject who becomes pregnant while participating will discontinue study 
treatment  (see Section 8.1 for details).  
Male Subjects With Partners Who Become Pregnant or Were Pregnant at the Time of 
Enrollment  
• In the event a male subject fathers a child during treatment, and for an additional 
5 months  after discontinuing denosumab , the information will be recorded on the 
Pregnancy Notification Worksheet.  The worksheet  (see Figure  12-2) must be 
submitted to Amgen Global Patient Safety within 24 hours of the site’s awareness of 
the pregnancy.  (Note:  sites are not required to provide any information on the 
Pregnancy Notification Worksheet that violates the country or regions local privacy 
laws.)  
• The investigator will attempt to obtain a signed authorization for release of 
pregnancy and infant health information directly from the pregnant female partner to 
obtain additional pregnancy information. 
• After obtaining the female partner’s signed authorization for release of pregnancy 
and infant health information, the investigator will collect pregnancy outcome and 
infant health information on the pregnant partner and her baby and c omplete the 
pregnancy questionnaires.  This information will be forwarded to Amgen Global 
Patient Safety.  
• Generally, infant follow -up will be conducted up to 12 months after the birth of the 
child (if applicable).  
• Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety 
regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for 
procedure.

CONFIDENTIAL    Collection of Lac tation Information  
• Investigator will collect lactation information on any female subject who breastfeeds 
while taking denosumab  through 5 months after last dose of denosumab. 
• Information will be recorded on the Lactation Notification Worksheet (see below) 
and submitted to Amgen Global Patient Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
knowledge of event.  
• Study treatment will be discontinued if female subject breastfeeds during the study .  
• With the female subjects signed authorization for release of mother  and infant 
health information, the investigator will collect mother and infant health information 
and complete the lactation questionnaire on any female subject who breastfeeds 
while taking denosumab  through 5 months  after discontinuing denosumab.

Amendment Date:  23 August  2018  
Rationale:  
This protocol is being amended to:  
• change the interval between last dose of denosumab and the end of treatment 
(EOT) in-person clinic visit .  The current 6 month safety follow -up visit following 
investigational product discontinuation, is not in line with the historical denosumab clinical trial program.  To align with previous standards established in 
the denosumab clinical program, this visit will be changed to 30 days  (± 8) 
following investigational product discontinuation.   This change will not alter the 
safety or physical or mental integrity of the clinical trial participants, or the 
scientific value of the trial.  
• add detail to denosumab  dosing instructions .  This is to ensure subjects  entering 
retreatment with denosumab, follow the approved labelled dosing instructions by including additional 120 mg  doses on days 8 and 15.  
• clarify procedure for reporting serious adverse events and/or events of interes t 
for subjects who experience a treatment gap of more than 30  days between the 
end of study (EOS) visit of Study 20062004 and signing the informed consent 
form (ICF) for Study  20140114. 
• clarify that S tudy 20062004 ended in May 2018, as the study was extended by a 
year.

investigational product will have an EOS visit conducted 30  days following the 
last dose of investigational product (EOT visit) if receiving investigational product 
at the 5  year time point .   
• clarify  that subjects with surgically salvageable disease, treatment continued until 
surgery for complete resection and for approximately 6 months post -surgery , as 
aligned to the 20062004 study.  
• clarify that investigators will not search publicly available records to ascertain survival status when a subject is lost to follow -up. 
• clarify that upon discontinuation, subject’s  risk for vertebral fragility fractures 
should be evaluated.  This language is being added in order to align language 
with the core data sheet.  
• make editorial, typographical, and f ormatting changes throughout the document

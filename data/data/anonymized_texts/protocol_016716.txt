 2   1.0 PURPOSE and OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of clobetasol proprionate .05% ointment to fractional CO2 laser procedure for the treatment of vulvar lichen sclerosus.  Primary Outcome Measures: - The primary outcome will be the subjective and objective cure of vulvar symptoms of itching, burning, dyspareunia at 12 weeks post treatment, or 6 months [Time Frame:12 weeks ] using the SkINDEX-29 and Vulvar Symptom Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Secondary Outcome Measures: - Complications [Time Frame: 6 week, 6 months, 1 year] pain, infection, de novo or worsening dyspareunia, contact dermatitis and burns - Subjective Vulvovaginal Symptoms Questionnaire (VSQ) - Objective Cure of Lichen Sclerosus [Time Frame:6 months, 1 year] using PHOTO documentation, Vulvar Signs Visual Analog Scale - Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) based on patient global impression of improvement and satisfaction as well as the Vaginal Health Index [Time Frame: 6 months, 1 year]   2.0  BACKGROUND and SIGNIFICANCE Vulvar lichen sclerosus (LS) is a well-characterized dermatosis resulting in labial atrophy, synechiae and introital narrowing and can often cause dyspareunia, itching and co-existent vulvar pain. Biopsy is necessary to confirm the clinical diagnosis and the mainstay of treatment usually consists of topical steroid therapy. 1 Clobetasol proprionate and mometasone furoate are potent topical steroids that have long been considered gold-standard treatment for vulvar lichen sclerosus and work through anti-inflammatory, anti-mitotic, and immunosuppressive effects. One of the complications of long-term steroid use, however, is potential thinning of the vulvar skin, therefore limiting long-term use. Other therapeutic options include topical calcineurin inhibitors, surgery including incision and skin graft treatment, cryotherapy and phototherapy. Table 1 summarizes current clinical comparative trials for lichen sclerosus involving topical steroid therapy. Clobetasol proprionate has a range of efficacy from 61-91% depending on the selected outcome criteria. Table 1.

The SmartXide8–V2-LR system was first introduced in 2009 with DOT therapy distributing fractioned CO2 laser in small spots of 200 microns to the vulvar skin or vaginal epithelium, resulting in a portion of the skin remaining intact with less tissue destruction and faster healing. The device is cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for incision, excision, ablation, and coagulation of gynecologic soft tissues.  The fractioned therapy has been shown to stimulate fibroblastic growth through activation and biosynthesis of collagen and restoration of the extracelluar matrix with collagen fibers.  D-Pulse DOT therapy involves two types of energy: 1) An initial high energy peak that allows laser energy removal of the superficial epithelial component 2) A second variable lower peak power that enables the laser energy to penetrate into the submucosa stimulating new collagen synthesis The histopathologic changes associated with the CO2 laser treatment are supportive for reconstituting the vaginal epithelium back to physiologic function in patients with severe vaginal atrophy. The atrophic vaginal epithelium in GSM is thin with few cycles having glycogen storage rendering the vaginal pH less acidic and the epithelium completely atrophic. Two months after treatment, the epithelium is thickened with proliferating basal cells beneath. The structural integrity of the epithelium is enhanced with newly formed papillae and capillaries supporting the vaginal ecosystem. Epithelial cells have remarkably more glycogen forming the characteristic superficial, intermediate and deep layers. Fibroblasts undergo protein production to create the extracellular matrix including collagen.9 The mechanism by which the carbon dioxide laser is hypothesized to work is by thermal energy creating heat shock of proteins. As a result of the damage, cytokines and growth factors are released signally molecules to recruit fibroblasts and increase cell division.10 Table 2 includes prior

Increased marketing for laser vaginal rejuvenation has spawned a proprietary female genital cosmetic surgery industry in the US with very limited published outcome data. SmartXide8 –V2-LR has some established outcome data for treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause GSM, also known as vulvovaginal atrophy.

 3.0  STUDY DESIGN Women presenting to the urogynecology clinic will be screened for lichen sclerosus. Vulvar biopsy will be performed for confirmation, and, if eligible, the patient will be consented to undergo baseline questionnaires, photodocumentation of vulvar lesions and randomization. Patient will be randomized to monthly LASER treatment for 3 months or topical STEROID therapy (temovate propionate .05% ointment nightly for one month, three times weekly for 2 additional months, then as needed) in a 1:1 ratio using a computer generated randomization schedule. Grouping assignments will be kept in sealed consecutively numbered, opaque envelopes. Because of the nature of the treatment, it will not be possible to blind patients but the assessor will be blinded to the intervention. Patient questionnaires include multiple validated scales and surveys to provided reproducible measures of vulvar symptoms as primary and secondary outcomes. Questionnaires will be completed at the intake visit, repeated at 12 weeks after treatment is completed or 6 months from intake, and one year follow up. Subjective symptoms including vulvar itching, vulvar burning, vulvar irritation, pain with intercourse, tearing of the vulvar skin, painful urination, and painful defection will be rated with a validated visual analog scale (VAS), scaled 0-10, see appendix 1. Higher values correspond to more bothersome symptoms.  The Skindex-29 questionnaire is a subjective measure of skin symptoms validated against the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Survey (SF-36)17, appendix 2. The Skindex-29 was developed in dermatology and modified for use in vulvadynia18.  The Skindex-29 is scored as a sum expressed on a 100-point scale with higher scores indicating lower quality of life. Validated quartiles are used to characterize disease symptoms, emotions, functioning, and overall score as either very little, mild, moderate, or severe19. Secondary outcomes of patient satisfaction and global impression of improvement will be collected using simple validated visual analog scale from 0-5, much worse to much better, appendix 4. A final subjective measure, the Vulvovaginal Symptoms Questionnaire (VSQ), a validated measure of vulvar symptoms, emotions, life impact, and sexual impact in postmenopausal women will be collected a secondary outcome20, appendix 5.  A higher total score on the VSQ corresponds to lower quality of life.  Objective measures of the clinical appearance of vulvar lichen sclerosus will be completed by investigators at concurrent time points with the patient questionnaires. Non identifiable photo documentation of vulvar appearance will be completed using Fujifilm JX665 Digital Camera. Investigators blinded to treatment arm will complete visual assessment including white plaques/hypopigmentation, cigarette paper/thin skin, introital narrowing, perianal involvement (figure of eight shape), loss of labia minor, fusion of labia minora, philmosis of clitoral hood, vulvar fissure, and erosion scaled on validated visual analog scale, rated 0-10 from absent to severe, see appendix 1. Lower objective VAS scores corresponds to less severe Lichen Sclerosus disease. In addition, investigators will complete validated Vaginal Health Index (VHI) at all time points21, appendix 3. The VHI evaluates vulvovaginal overall elasticity, fluid secretion type and consistency, pH, epithelial mucosa, and moisture on a scale 1-5 from none to excellent. A lower VHI score corresponds to greater urogenital atrophy.  The laser used in this clinical investigation complies with federal laser performance standards.

 6 Fractional CO2 laser with 10600 um wavelength, 60 W pulse, continuous or pulsed with repetition rate, articulated arm with scanner hand-piece, 120 Vac power and 635 nm aiming beam. The laser power will be set at 26 W, dwell time of 800 microseconds, DOT spacing at 800 micro meters and normal scan mode. Vulvar lichen sclerosis will be treated except for the clitoris glans and clitoral hood which will be spared with at least 5mm margin.  The procedure will be performed in the outpatient clinic at the National Center for Advanced Pelvic Surgery at MedStar Washington Hospital Center or Medstar Lafayette Center, and include 3 sessions, 4 weeks apart. A minimum of 2 weeks are required from the time of biopsy to treatment. Prior to treatment eutectic local anesthetic (EMLA) will be applied for at least 5 minutes up to 30 minutes and then wiped off prior to laser treatment. Photodocumentation will take place at baseline and at 6 months and one year following the last LASER or STEROID treatment. Interpretation of photodocumentation with clinical objective scale will be completed by blinded provider.  4.0   SUBJECT POPULATION and SELECTION CRITERIA Patients presenting to urogynecology or gynecology clinic with vulvar symptoms and biopsy confirmed lichen sclerosus.  Inclusion criteria: - Women  - Biopsy proven symptomatic vulvar lichen sclerosus  - Ability to understand the study, accept randomization and logistically follow-up with scheduled visits - Post-menopausal Exclusion criteria: - Known vulvar malignancy - Pregnancy or planning pregnancy or less than 3 months postpartum - Current or prior diagnosis of any gynecologic malignancy - Previous pelvic radiation therapy - Allergy to topical steroid - No active UTI, vulvar infection (candida, herpes, bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis or other infection) - Pelvic organ prolapse > than Stage 2  - Treatment with systemic immunomodulators, topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus, pimecrolimus), or vulvar hormonal or vulvar topical steroid use within 2 months of enrollment - History of vaginal mesh implant - IUD (Intrauterine Device) - Skindex-29 overall score <21, below mildly impaired health related quality of life threshold  5.0  SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION The study will consist of 2 study groups (LASER vs STEROID therapy). We expect improved subjective and objective results in the LASER group at 3 months post treatment or 6 months from enrollment compared with the STEROID group.  This study is designed as a two-group randomized clinical trial. Sample size calculations were conducted using the absolute change in the Skindex 29 as the primary end point. Out study will reach 80% power to detect a mean difference of 16 points on the Skindex 29 (sd=22 for both groups)22 between the study groups with 24 patients in each group, or 48 in total based on a one-sided two-sample t-test with alpha=0.05. By accounting for 10% attrition, we propose to recruit 52 patients to the study to be randomized with a 1:1 ratio to each group, with a blocked component for those who used topical clobetasol in the past. The Skindex-29 has validated cutoff categories for mildly, moderately, and severely impaired health related quality of life scores, the mean difference between each quality of life measure overall score is between 6 and 7. Therefore, powering the study for a detection of mean difference of 16 points should measure significant quality of life improvement.23,24

Description of random and blinded nature of the protocols will be explained by the physician in charge of the participant. To avoid or minimize potential risks, frequent monitoring for adverse events will be performed by study staff and the PI. Risks of clobetasol proprionate include skin irritation, burning, rash and change in skin pigmentation.  Potential adverse reactions to laser use include ocular laser exposure which will be minimized with the use of protective eyewear with an optical density of 4x the treatment wavelength. Pain or mild to moderate discomfort, erythema, swelling, blistering, itching, numbness, change in pigmentation, scarring, and burns are other adverse events including as well as painful intercourse, change (postive or negative) in sexual response, including arousal around clitoris and orgasm. These risks will be minimized with laser use per manufacture instructions with trained personel and avoidance of laser treatment within 5mm of clitorial glans and hood.  All known risks will be disclosed to the participants via the informed consent process. All study participants will be closely monitored post treatment for adverse events. All known risks will be disclosed to the participants via the informed consent process. All study participants will be closely monitored post treatment for adverse events. All study investigators will receive extensive training on the study protocol. Attending staff/surgeons will also receive training on how to operate the laser and the appropriate settings for the vulvar treatment, supervised by the study mentor. Serious adverse events are defined as any untoward medical occurrence that (1) results in death, (2) is life-threatening, (3) requires inpatient hospitalization (4) results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, (5) is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or (6) is another medically important condition.

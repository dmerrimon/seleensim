 
 Sensitivity: Internal Profiling the determinants of recovery to establish novel rehabilitation guidelines to improve clinically relevant and patient-reported outcomes in the post-COVID-19 period across 3 individual countries.  Background  The value of clinical cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) within healthcare settings has been established in the last decad. CPET methods remain highly relevant in the COVID-19 endemic phase and should be used to assess those recovering from COVID-19 infection. This diagnostic tool could play an integral role in disease prognostication and evaluate the integrative response to incremental exercise. Date from such assessments can enable practitioners to characterise cardio-respiratory fitness and identify reasons for physical impairment or abnormal cardio-respiratory function. More than 50% of patients admitted to hospital will experience cardiorespiratory issues and significant morbidity during their recovery and will require significant rehabilitative support. In this context, measurements obtained from an assessment of cardio-respiratory responses to physiological stress could provide insight regarding the integrity of the pulmonary-vascular interface and characterisation of any impairment or abnormal cardio-respiratory function. Current approaches to rehabilitation are being developed on existing knowledge from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) related illness. These provide important insight but do not provide insight into the novel challenges provided by COVID-19.  We bring together three clinical and academic research centres from around the world that collaborate as part of the Healthy Living for Pandemic Event Protection international network to conduct a minimum of 150 2-day CPET tests in patients that hospitalised with COVID-19. Patients will be engaged in testing in the UK (led by Faghy from the Human Science Research Centre, Derby and Maden-Wilkinson from the Research and Innovation for post-COVID-19 Rehabilitation centre, Sheffield), USA (led by Arena and Ozemek at the University of Illinois at Chicago) and India (led by Veluswamy and Babu at the Ramaiah Medical College, Bangalore). All tests will be conducted following standardised procedures documented by the American College of Sports Medicine.

Upon the conclusion of each test, the key descriptive characteristics and findings will be recorded to facilitate the use of cohort analyses. Data will be stratified according to the demographic (age, gender, ethnicity, pre-COVID-19 functional status and important physiological parameters for a given workload (absolute and relative oxygen consumption or VO2 peak, O2 pulse, alveolar-arterial O2 gradient, arterial to end-tidal CO2 difference and the relationship between carbon dioxide output and ventilation (VE/VCO2 slope)). These approaches will be used to identify differences, trends and patterns in key defining variables that might lead to longstanding impairment/morbidity. Study day 1 will be conducted 7-10 days post baseline measures to ensure no symptoms of post exertional malaise and/or excessive fatigue from baseline assessments. Patients will wear accelerometers during this period to compare baseline and follow up.  
 
Gilead Sciences Long COVID Work Package 2 Protocol Version 1 15-03-2021 13         4.1 Baseline Clinical Data Data collected will include demographics, the pre-admission symptoms, pre-admission therapy, preadmission exercise tolerance and performance status (retrospective assessment by the patient and/or representative 6 weeks preceding admission) level of educational attainment, past-medical history, time and route of admission, and in-hospital routine physiological observations (including heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and temperature). Blood biomarkers that are part of clinical profiling such as CRP, total blood count, D-Dimers and IL-6 as well as exploratory markers for Long covid mechanisms including inflammatory responses and clotting factors. This will also be performed pre and post (30mins) exercise bouts..   4.1.1 Anthropometrics (Session 1) Participants will be asked to provide an approximate date of onset of COVID-19 and whether they have received any COVID-19 vaccinations and the manufacturer of the vaccine. Body Mass (kg) and height (m) will be assessed.  4.1.2 Questionnaires 4.1.2.1 Symptom Profile Symptom profile will be measured twice at the baseline assessment (Day 0), to capture a) retrospective assessment by the patient of their symptom status at symptom onset (essentially their baseline symptoms), and b) their current symptom status at the point of testing.  4.1.2.2 Quality of Life The EQ-5D-5L is routinely used in the assessment of the quality of life in respiratory research and is available in more than 130 languages (EQ-5D-5L). It comprises five dimensions (Previously 3): mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems.  4.1.2.3 Sleep Behaviour Participants will complete the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI is a self-report measure to assess sleep quality over a 4 week in period, throughout the Session 3 (+1 day) Symptom Profile* ECG  Resting HR + BP CPET Lactate and BP Recovery following CPET HRV  7 Day follow up Accelerometery Patient Log/Diary HRV    Baseline Anthropometrics  Questionnaires Symptom Profile*  Lung Function TUG 6MWT   Session 2 Symptom Profile* ECG  Resting HR + BP CPET Lactate and BP Recovery following CPET HRV   
 
Gilead Sciences Long COVID Work Package 2 Protocol Version 1 15-03-2021 14 intervention. The measure consists of 19 individual items, with a 0-3 interval scale and creates 7 components that produce one global score. The PSQI is reliable and valid in the assessment of sleep problems.  4.1.2.4 Fatigue Fatigue is a common complaint in patients recovering from an acute respiratory infection and is not adequately captured in general quality of life or specific recovery questionnaires. Participants will complete 2 separate measures of fatigue at Visit 1 and Visit 2); (A) the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS), a self-reported questionnaire validated to assess presence and severity of fatigue; and (B) MFI-20. A 20 item self-reported questionnaire assessing fatigue across five aspects.  4.1.2.5 MRC Dyspnoea Scale The Medical Research Council (MRC) Dyspnoea Scale (MRC) is a measure to grade the effect of breathlessness on the person’s daily activities. The MRC is simple to administer and is a short 1-5 stage scale (1 item) and allows the person to state the extent to which their breathlessness affects their mobility.  4.1.2.6 Post-COVID-19 Functional Status (PCFS) Scale The Post-COVID-19 Functional Status (PCFS) Scale will be assessed upon discharge from the hospital and during each face-to-face visit to monitor direct recovery and to assess functional sequelae. The PCFS will evaluate the ultimate consequences of COVID-19 on functional status and supplement other instruments that measure quality of life, tiredness, or dyspnoea in the acute phase. The PCFS covers the full spectrum of functional outcomes and focuses on both limitations in usual duties/activities and changes in lifestyle in six scale grades. Briefly grade 0 reflects the absence of any functional limitation, and the death of a patient is recorded in grade D. Upward of grade 1, symptoms, pain or anxiety are present to an increasing degree. This has no effect on activities for patients in grade 1, whereas a lower intensity of the activities is required for those in grade 2. Grade 3 accounts for inability to perform certain activities forcing patients to structurally modify these. Finally, grade 4 is reserved for those patients with severe functional limitations requiring assistance with activities of daily living (ADL).  4.1.2.7 Cognition The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) will be conducted at Visit 1.  To allow accurate interpretation, highest educational level/attainment will be recorded during  data collection   4.1.3 Functional Status Two different assessments of lower extremity functional capacity will be conducted at each visit these are (A) the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and (B) the timed up and go test (TUG). The 6MWT is a standardised and widely used measure of functional status in individuals with chronic disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, congestive cardiac failure, peripheral vascular disease, and elderly. It has been previously used to assess response to interventions and predict morbidity and mortality. Participants will be given a shortened practice attempt (1-2 minutes) at the beginning of each of their assessment visits. This will not be recorded but will be performed to allow familiarisation with the assessment and repeated at each visit for 
 
Gilead Sciences Long COVID Work Package 2 Protocol Version 1 15-03-2021 15 consistency. Patients suffering from excessive fatigue/Post exertional malaise from the 6MWT will be excluded from the study to prevent further onset of these symptoms.   The TUG is reliable and reproducible and has been validated as a predictor of frailty and risk of falls in elderly adults. The TUG has several advantages over other measures, mainly its reproducibility and shorter assessment time. Its use at predicting functional status following pneumonia has not been assessed previously.  Participants will also be asked to self-report their return to functional activity and employment at each contact with the research team (telephone consultations and follow-up visits.) Each participant will be asked at each contact with the research team if they have returned to perform their activities of daily living to the same level as 6 weeks before admission, and if they have returned to their occupation (if employed.) The patient-reported date of return to these activities will also be recorded.  4.1.4 Lung Function (Session 1) Full lung function tests including FEV1, FVC, PEFR, flow-volume curves, MIP, and MEP will be conducted during first visit. These spirometry measurements will be conducted by a suitably qualified individual, proficient in the use of the specific equipment and according to published standards.  4.1.5 Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Blood Pressure (Session 2 and 3) Participants will then be fitted with: a 12-channel electrocardiography (ECG) device (Custo Cardio 200, Customed, Ottobrunn, Germany); a blood pressure cuff positioned over the brachial artery (Tango M2, SunTech, Eynsham, UK). Measurements will be taken following 10 minutes of supine rest, during sit to stand task and monitored continuously throughout the CPET.   4.1.6 Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test (CPET) (Session 2 and 3) Cardiopulmonary exercise testing will be performed to measure VO2 peak and other parameters representative of cardiovascular reserve (McGregor et al., 2016). Tests will be conducted using a standard bicycle ramp protocol in accordance with American Thoracic Society guideline (Ross et al., 2003). In accordance with pilot data, we will stratify individuals starting load based on their 6MWT distance, Strata I: 6MWD < 350 (starting load of 10 watts; with subsequent increments of 5 watts), Strata II: 6MWD 350 – 400 (starting load of 20w with subsequent increments of 5w and Strata III: 6MWD > 400 (starting load of 30w with subsequent increments of 5W)  Participants will then complete a maximal graded exercise test on a friction-loaded cycle ergometer (Monark 894E Ergomedic Peak Bike, Monark, Varberg, Sweden). The cycle ergometer friction wheel will be calibrated according to manufacturer recommendations prior to the study. The cycle ergometer will be set up according to each participant’s body size and personal preference. The knee angle at the bottom of the pedal stroke will be ~25°, which is optimal for movement economy and injury prevention. Knee angle will be measured using a universal goniometer. The cycle ergometer handlebars will be positioned so that the participant can comfortably maintain an upright posture. The cycle ergometer set-up will be identical for each visit.   
 
Gilead Sciences Long COVID Work Package 2 Protocol Version 1 15-03-2021 16 A step-wise incremental exercise test will be performed at a cadence of 60 revolutions per minute (rpm) (±10%). The exercise protocol will begin with a 3-minute rest period, followed by a step-wise incremental protocol, designed to achieve volitional exhaustion within 8-12 minutes of exercise onset. The exercise protocol will be individualised based on participants’ predicted exercise capacity, as described above. Heart rate and pulmonary gas exchange data will be measured continuously. Blood pressure and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) (6 to 20 scale) will be measured during the final 15 second period of each minute. For blood pressure measurements, participants will be asked to relax their arm and shoulder muscles whilst their forearm is rested on the researcher’s shoulder (padded with a folded towel). This will ensure that the participant’s arm is positioned near heart level to reduce measurement error. At the end of the exercise test, participants will complete a cooldown consisting of unloaded pedalling at 20rpm for 5-10 minutes. All data will be exported for offline analysis using Microsoft Excel (Washington, USA).   Criteria for the assessment of a good participant effort will include peak respiratory exchange ratio (RER) >1.10, peak HR≥85% predicted and RPE ≥18.31 (Balady et al., 2010). Prior to the test, participants will be monitored for 5 minutes to allow passive data collection and for a total of 10 minutes after completion.  We will analyse over 30s averages to allow for differences in Gas analysis systems and monitor heart rate throughout test and 10 minutes seated recovery. Blood Pressure monitoring continuously (every 30s). Blood lactate concentration will be monitored through fingertip sampling at the end of each stage and at 5-minute intervals for 30 minutes following volitional fatigue.    4.1.6.1 Pulmonary Gas Exchange Measures Breath-by-breath pulmonary gas exchange data will be smoothed using a middle five of seven breath average. Key variables of interest include: the first ventilatory threshold (VT1), the respiratory compensation point (RCP), peak oxygen consumption (V̇O2peak) and end-tidal CO2. V̇O2peak is defined as the mean V̇O2 over the last 30 seconds of the exercise test, adjusted for body mass (ml·kg−1·min−1). VT1 will be determined by using the V-slope method to identify the deflection point in the relationship between V̇CO2  and V̇O2 – indicating a disproportionate rise in CO2 production due to increasing anaerobic glycolytic activity (65). VT1 will be confirmed using the nadir of the ventilatory equivalent (VE) for V̇O2 (VE/V̇O2) (65). The RCP will be determined using the V-slope method to identify the deflection point in the relationship between VE and V̇CO2 – which marks the onset of hyperventilation caused by excessive blood lactate accumulation (65). The RCP will be confirmed using the nadir of VE/V̇CO2  (65). The VT1 and the RCP will be confirmed by two researchers at each site. Where agreement is not reached, a third researcher will adjudicate. End-tidal CO2 is the partial pressure of CO2 measured at the end of each breath.  Exercise termination criteria Chest pain suggestive of ischaemia Fall in systolic blood pressure >20 mmHg from the highest value during exercise >225 mmHg systolic blood pressure >130 mmHg diastolic blood pressure Hypotension (<100 mmHg systolic) 
 
Gilead Sciences Long COVID Work Package 2 Protocol Version 1 15-03-2021 17 Severe desaturation: SpO2 ⩽ 80% when accompanied by symptoms of severe hypoxaemia Sudden pallor Loss of coordination Mental confusion Dizziness or faintness Signs of respiratory failure    4.2 Follow-up Assessments Using a custom developed application alongside commercially available heart rate monitoring devices, participants will be asked to provide accelerometery (asked through the participants phone), heart rate variability (iHeart) and a subjective wellness score for each day following baseline and CPET investigations each for a period of 3 days. This custom developed software has been developed at the Advanced Wellbeing Research Centre to provide objective and subjective assessment of fatigue in people suffering with long covid and has successfully been piloted with over 200 individuals. Where smartphone data is not possible, individuals will be asked to wear an accelerometer and subjectively report their wellness through patient diary.   4.3 Safety of Graded Exercise Testing Graded exercise testing is a safe procedure which is routinely used in clinical, exercise and research settings. Numerous studies that have assessed the safety of graded exercise testing (mostly in cardiac patients) indicate that the risk of exercise-induced complications and mortality is very low. The reported mortality rate ranges from 0 to 1 death per 10,000 tests, and the non-fatal adverse event rate ranges from 0 to 5.2 per 10,000 tests.  4.4 Risk Management  4.4.1 Cardiovascular Risk Participation in aerobic exercise may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as cardiac ischaemia, arrythmia or hypotension. The use of an appropriate graduated warm-up and cool-down is recommended to minimise these risks (ACSM, 2021). In the proposed study, participants’ physiological response to exercise will be closely monitored during and after exercise. Exercise will be stopped if any adverse signs or symptoms occur (see table above). The researcher is experienced in the provision of clinical exercise tests and is trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation.   4.4.2 Musculoskeletal Risk Participation in aerobic exercise may increase the risk of musculoskeletal injury such as a muscle strain. This risk will be minimised by conducting a graduated warm-up and by following the cycle ergometer manufacturer guidelines regarding correct positioning of participants.   4.4.3 Post-Exertional Malaise Post exertional malaise has been identified in patients with long covid especially with incremental exercise and exertion. We will screen for individuals’ experiences PEM 
 
Gilead Sciences Long COVID Work Package 2 Protocol Version 1 15-03-2021 18 prior to the study and follow up with individual participants following baseline measurement sessions before proceeding with repeated day CPET. Those individuals who show symptoms of PEM will be provided with guidance of pacing and provided with access to published materials around managing fatigue as per UK NHS long covid clinic guidance (World Physiotherapy, 2021).   4.4.4. Bruising.  Bruising may occur following venepuncture sampling, participants will be advised of this through PIS and management if bruising occurs (Rest and cold exposure).  4.5 Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis will be supervised by Dr Emma Sharpe at the University of Derby and conducted using SPSS version 26. This study is a prospective observational cohort study, designed to identify suitable tools and measures across different domains for assessing patient recovery from COVID-19.   Descriptive statistics will be calculated for all outcomes of interest. These will be presented as proportions and means with standard deviations or medians with interquartile ranges, depending on the distribution of data.  Within group differences will be compared using parametric (students t-test) and non-parametric (Mann-Whitney U, Chi square) tests, depending on normality of distribution.   4.6 Sponsor and Coordination The University of Derby, UK will act as the sponsor for the research and Dr Mark Faghy will act as the Chief Investigator. With site principal investigators as follows: • Advanced Wellbeing Research Centre, Sheffield UK - Dr Tom Maden-Wilkinson • Ramaiah Medical College, Bengaluru, USA - Dr Sundar Kumar Veluswamy • University of Illinois, Chicago - Dr Cemal Ozemek   4.7 Adverse Events and Reporting 4.7.1 Definition of Adverse Event (AE) Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study where participants are administered a medicinal product, which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with participation in this study.  An AE includes: • Exacerbation of pre-existing illness • Increase in frequency or intensity of a pre-existing episodic event or condition • Condition detected or diagnosed after study intervention even though it may have been present before the start of the study • Continuous persistent disease or symptoms present at baseline that worsens following the start of the study  
 
Gilead Sciences Long COVID Work Package 2 Protocol Version 1 15-03-2021 19 An AE does not include: • Medical or surgical procedure (e.g. surgery, tooth extraction) but the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE • Pre-existing disease or conditions present or detected at the start of the study that did not worsen • Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has occurred (e.g. hospitalisations for cosmetic elective surgery) • Disease or disorder being studied, or sign or symptom associated with the disease or disorder unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition • Overdose of concurrent medication without any signs or symptoms  4.7.2 Non-serious AEs All such events, whether expected or not, should be recorded.  4.7.3 Abnormal Baseline Findings Abnormal findings at that are deemed to be a clinically significant abnormality may be reported as an AE, according to the judgement of the Chief Investigator taking into account any associated clinical symptoms/signs from the below measures during pre; mid and post time frame.  4.7.4 Reporting Procedures for All AEs Aim: to describe adverse events relating to study and the reporting process  Adverse event (AE) and Serious Adverse Event (SAE) will use the local NHS Trust reporting procedures but reported to the University of Derby Research and Knowledge Exchange Office as soon as possible.  All AEs should be reported on the CRF. Any questions concerning adverse event reporting should be directed to the Chief Investigator in the first instance. Participants will be asked to report AE’s and SAE’s during all follow up sessions. All participants will be provided with contact details for a trial phone, where they can communicate AE/SAE throughout the study and will be operated during working hours (Monday to Friday 9-5). Outside of these working hours, participants are encouraged to leave a voicemail and the study team will contact them back as soon as possible during working hours.  The following information will be recorded: description, date of onset and end date and severity. Follow-up information should be provided, as necessary. AEs considered related to the study as judged by a medically qualified investigator (Tom Bewick, CI) or the sponsor will be followed until resolution or the event is considered stable. All related AEs that result in a participant’s withdrawal from the study or are present at the end of the study, should be followed up until a satisfactory resolution occurs. It will be to the responsibility of the Chief Investigator’s clinical judgement whether an AE is of sufficient severity to warrant removal from the study. The relationship of AEs to the study will be assessed by a medically qualified investigator. All such events, whether expected or not will be recorded.  
 
Gilead Sciences Long COVID Work Package 2 Protocol Version 1 15-03-2021 20 4.7.5 Definition of Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Any untoward and unexpected medical occurrence or effect that: • Results in death • Is life-threatening – refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe • Requires hospitalisation, or prolongation of existing inpatients’ hospitalisation • Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity • Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  An SAE form will be completed and forwarded to the sponsor or delegated representative within 24 hours. However, relapse and death and hospitalisations for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition do not need reporting as SAEs. All SAEs should be reported to the study sponsor local Research Ethics Committee where in the opinion of the Chief Investigator, the event was: • ‘Related’, i.e. resulted from the administration of any of the research procedures; and • ‘Unexpected’, i.e. an event that is not listed in the protocol as an expected occurrence  4.7.6 Reporting Procedures for All SAEs Reports of related and unexpected SAEs should be submitted within 15 days of the Chief Investigator becoming aware of the event, using the ‘COREC SAE’ form for non-CTIMP studies. Local investigators should report any SAEs as required by their Local Research Ethics Committee and/or Research & Development Office. Fatal or life-threatening SAEs must be reported within 7 days which will be reported to the Competent Authorities MHRA and the Research Ethics Committee.  SAE reports must be sent to R&I using one of the following methods:  i. Email: UKREO@Derby.ac.uk ii. Hand Delivered (Not Mailed): South Tower, Kedleston Road iii. Telephone: 01332 59 7815 (If written report not immediately possible)  The intensity of the AE will initially be assessed according to the following definitions: • Mild: An event easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort, and not interfering with everyday activities • Moderate: An event sufficiently discomforting to interfere with everyday activities • Severe: An event that prevents everyday activities  All AE and SAE Reporting documentation (i.e. NHS National Patient Safety Agency, National Research Ethics Service, Report of Adverse Event (AE) and Serious Adverse Event) physical copies of these will be kept in the Trial Master File.  
 
Gilead Sciences Long COVID Work Package 2 Protocol Version 1 15-03-2021 21 5.0 Data Protection and Patient Confidentiality All investigators and study site staff will comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 2018 with regards to the collection, storage, processing, and disclosure of personal information and will uphold the Act’s core principles. This includes a trial independent monitor which will carry out the monitoring of the study data as an on-going activity.  Staff involved in the study will ensure that all participants’ confidentiality is maintained. The participants will be identified only by initials and surname (for purposes of address on the telephone), and a unique patient study identification number on the CRF and central electronic database. All documents will be stored securely and only accessible by staff involved in the study and authorised personnel. The study will comply with the Data Protection Act (in the UK) and with local legal requirements alongside the principles of ICH-GCP (worldwide); in line with this, all data will be anonymised as soon as it is practical to do so. The fully anonymised study data will be stored for at least five years following the closure of the study and thereafter disposed of in line with regulatory requirements. No participant will be individually identified in any subsequent publications relating to this study.  The study database will be kept on Microsoft Excel© 2016 and hosted on the University of Derby internal server. The server and database are protected by several measures including anti-virus and anti-spyware applications, firewalls, encryption technology and permissions. Data will be entered onto the paper CRF and retained and stored securely until the study end date, at which point the CRFs will be sent securely to the coordinating centre for entry onto the electronic study database. The data will be securely stored in line with ICH-GCP standards and data protection principles. The data stored will be checked for missing or unusual values and for consistency within participants over time. If any problems are identified, the appropriate CRFs will be reviewed in discussion with relevant local site personnel and queried for confirmation or correction as required until resolution.  The Chief and Principal Investigators, sponsor, and authorised staff will have access to participants’ data. The Chief Investigator and/or Principal Investigators will facilitate access to study records for monitoring, audits, and regulatory inspections.  6.0 Data Retention and Archiving In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, regulations and following the University Hospitals NHS Trust Code of Research Conduct and Research Ethics the Chief Investigator will maintain all records and documents regarding the conduct of the study. These will be retained for at least 15 years (or for longer if required). If the Chief Investigator is no longer able to maintain the data records, an alternative person will be nominated to take over this responsibility.  The Trial Master File and Trial documents held by the Chief Investigator on behalf of the Sponsor shall be finally archived by the sponsor local NHS Trust. This archive shall include all study databases and associated meta-data encryption codes.  
 
Gilead Sciences Long COVID Work Package 2 Protocol Version 1 15-03-2021 22 6.1 Amendments Amendments to the study protocol will be handled according to the Health Research Authority’s guidelines for Non-CTIMP studies. Decisions to amend the protocol will be the responsibility of the Sponsor in consultation with the Chief Investigator and Principal Investigator. The Sponsor will have responsibility for determining the category of each amendment (Substantial versus Non-Substantial). All substantial and non-substantial amendments will be reported directly to the local Hospitals Trust Research Ethics Committee. It will be authorised by the Sponsor and Chief Investigator before submission. The appropriate documentation, clearly detailing changes, will be emailed to the responsible REC for review. Should a protocol amendment be made that requires REC approval, the changes in the protocol will not be instituted until the amendment and revised participant consent forms and participant information sheets (if appropriate) have been reviewed and received approval from the REC and R&I departments. A protocol amendment intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to participants may be implemented immediately providing that the MHRA, R&I and REC are notified as soon as possible, and approval is requested. Minor protocol amendments only for logistical or administrative changes may be implemented immediately and therefore the REC will be informed.  6.2 Access to the Final Study Dataset The study database will be kept on Microsoft Excel© 2016 and hosted on the local University server. The server and database are protected by many measures including anti-virus and anti-spyware applications, firewalls, encryption technology and permissions. Data will be entered onto the paper CRF and retained and stored securely until the study end date, at which point the CRFs will be sent securely to the coordinating centre for entry onto the electronic study database.  The data will be securely stored in line with ICH-GCP standards and data protection principles. The data stored will be checked for missing or unusual values and for consistency within participants over time. If any problems are identified, the appropriate CRFs will be reviewed in discussion with relevant local site personnel and queried for confirmation or correction as required until resolution. The Chief and Principal Investigators and authorised staff will have access to participants’ data. The Chief Investigator and/or Principal Investigators will facilitate access to study records for monitoring, audits, and regulatory inspections.  7.0 Financing and Insurance This study is funded by GILEAD Sciences: COVID-19 RFP Program to the value of £174,885.46.  Indemnity and insurances will be provided by the University of Derby who is acting as the sponsor for this study.  7.1 Participant Incentives There will be no financial recompense for the participants time, however all expenses (parking and travel) will also be covered by the study.  
 
Gilead Sciences Long COVID Work Package 2 Protocol Version 1 15-03-2021 23 7.2 Funding The study is funded by GILEAD Sciences: COVID-19 RFP Program  8.0 Public Patient Involvement This protocol has been reviewed as part of the PPI groups at Royal Derby Hospital, UK and Patient involvement in Research Group (PIRG) at the Advanced Wellbeing Research Centre, UK.   9.0 End of Study The end of the study is the date of the home visit (post-study follow up) of the last participant enrolled.  10.0 Discontinuation/Withdrawal of Participants from Study Treatment Each participant has the right to withdraw from the study at any time. Participants may be withdrawn from the study either at their request or at the discretion of the Chief Investigator. Participants will be made aware (via The Participant Information Sheet and Participant Consent Form) that withdrawing the data which has been collected cannot be erased and may still be used in the final data analysis and study dissemination (i.e. published journal). The Chief Investigator may withdraw a participant from the study at any time if they consider that the participant’s health is compromised by remaining in the study or the participant is not sufficiently cooperative. The reasons for any participant withdrawal will be recorded on the study completion form of the CRF. The data collected from withdrawn participants will be included in the study report.  Besides, the Chief Investigator may discontinue a participant from the study at any time if they consider it necessary for any reason including but not limited to: • Ineligibility (arising during study or retrospective having been overlooked at screening) • Significant protocol deviation • Significant non-compliance with study requirements • An AE which results in the inability to continue to comply with study procedures • Progression of illness that renders participants unable to comply with study procedures. • Consent is withdrawn • Lost to follow up  The reason for withdrawal will be clearly stated and recorded in the CRF.  If the participant is withdrawn due to an AE, the Chief Investigator will arrange for a follow-up telephone call until the AE has resolved or stabilised.  
 
Gilead Sciences Long COVID Work Package 2 Protocol Version 1 15-03-2021 24 11.0 Dissemination All data arising from this study will be owned by the named academics from the University of Derby.

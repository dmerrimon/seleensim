Introduction:  
An SpO 2 accuracy comparison was conducted as part of the final validation of the VitalDetect™  pulse oximetry  
system . The study was conducted in accordance to Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) for Non -Significant Risk (NSR) 
investigational studies, following ISO 14155:2011 as appropriate and the pulse oximetry guidelines of ISO 80601 -2-
61:2017  applicable sections, and Pul se Oximeters – Premarket Notifications Submissions [510(k)s] Guidance For 
Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff (issued: March 4, 2013) . 
 
Purpose:  
The purpose of this study was to validate the SpO 2 accuracy of the VitalDetect™  pulse oximetry  system  during non -
motion conditions over the range of 70 -100% SaO 2 as compared to arterial blood samples assessed by CO -
Oximetry.  It was expected that the Accuracy Root Mean Square (A RMS) performance of the oximetry system would 
meet the required specifi cation of A RMS of 3.0% or less .  
 
A secondary goal was to evaluate the pulse rate performance simultaneous ly collected  over  the SpO2 range 
covered. The Pulse Rate Accuracy Root Mean Square (Arms) performance of the VitalDetect™  pulse oximetry  
system , were expected to meet a specification of 3 bpm.  
 
Subjects:  
Following Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval Title: “Vital USA SpO2 Accuracy Comparison to Arterial Blood 
CO-Oximetry ”, Clinimark Study ID# PR 201 9-353, eleven  healthy  adult volunteer subjects were screened and 
enroll ed into the study.  One subject was withdrawn from the study due to poor  device placement  and time sync 
with the control oximeter . The demographics of subjects included were five males and five females (age: 19-38yrs, 
weight: 1 05-228 lbs, height: 63-75”, BMI: 18.0 -34.7). For race and ethnicity, the subject pool included two Black / 
African -Americans , one Asian , and seven  White . Nine  subjects were of Non -Hispanic / Non -Latino and one of 
Hispanic /Latino ethnicity . The skin pigmentation / tones ranged from light to dark meeting the requirement of at 
least 2 darkly pigmented or 15 % of the subject pool whichever is larger. All subjects completed  the study without 
incidence. There were no significant adverse events, device effects or other, observed during the study.  
 
Methods:  
Testing was conducted under normal office environment conditions. The VitalDetect™  pulse oximetry  was placed  
on the right  index finger  of all subject s to evaluate the SpO 2 and pulse rate accuracy performance during steady 
state non -motion conditions.   A Clinimark Control Pulse Oximetry system was also placed on the subject to 
evaluate the stability of the draws  and the real time oxygen saturation status.  The subject was in a reclined 
posit ion and connected to a breathing circuit, for administering medical grade oxygen and nitrogen. The gas flow 
delivery was adjusted for subject comfort. The gas mixture was controlled to various levels of induced hypoxia 
resulting in stable oxygen saturation  plateaus between 100% and 67% SaO 2. Arterial blood samples were drawn 
during simultaneous data collection from the control pulse oximeter and the test oximeters. The blood was 
immediately analyzed by Reference CO -Oximetry providing functional SaO 2 for the  basis of the SpO 2 accuracy

1. Introduction  
Pulse oximetry monitoring is considered a standard physiological measurement and is used by clinicians in 
everyday situations to estimate arterial oxygen saturation. A pulse oximeter is a device that measures the oxygen 
saturation of arterial blood non -invasively. In general, pulse oximeters use two wavelength absorption 
spectrophotometry to measure oxygen saturation based on the amount of reflected or scattered radiation. The 
wavelengths are selected to provide the best separation of absorbencies of oxy -hemoglobin (O2Hb) and deoxy -
hemoglobin (HHb) states. The ratio of the two absorbencies is used to calculate the oxygen saturation (SpO 2) 
value. Because an arterial sample of blood is not required to make the measurement, the pulse oximeter can 
provide non -invasive real time information. The clinical use of pulse oximeters has reduced the frequency and 
necessity of invasive arterial blood sampling and  has helped to improve patient safety by providing information to 
clinicians about patients’ oxygenation status . 
 
The purpose of this study was to validate the SpO 2 and pulse rate accuracy of the VitalDetect™  pulse oximetry  
during non -motion conditions over the range of 70 -100% SaO 2 as compared to arterial blood samples assessed by 
CO-Oximetry  and Reference ECG res pectively.   
 
The goal, was to provide supporting documentation for the SpO 2 accuracy validation  and performance for the 
VitalDetect™  pulse oximetry .  It was expected that the Accuracy Root Mean Square (A RMS) performance would 
meet the required specification of A RMS 3.0% or lower in non -motion conditions for the range of 70 – 100% SaO 2 
thereby demonstrating an acceptable SpO 2 accuracy performance specification.  As a secondary goal, the pulse rate 
accuracy performance was reviewed for the range ob served during the non -motion hypoxia study. The pulse rate 
accuracy was expected to meet an A RMS of 3 bpm as compared to Reference ECG Heart Rate.  
 
No risks or adverse device effects were expected. There were no contraindications for use in the study / stu dy 
population.  
 
The study was conducted in accordance to the code of federal regulations for non -significant risk medical device 
studies and applicable ISO 14155 (2nd edition 2011 -02-01), applicable sections of ISO 80601 -2-61:2017 , and  Pulse 
Oximeters – Premarket Notifications Submissions [510(k)s] Guidance For Industry and Food and  Drug 
Administration Staff (issued: March 4, 2013).

Subjects were instructed that they could terminate the test at any time. The principal investigator, clinician or gas 
controller could t erminate the test based on such request or judgment of the well -being of the subject.  
 
Following completion of the initial screening, a vascular assessment was conducted prior to cannulation of the 
artery to verify the presence of adequate collateral blood  flow to the hand. Precautions to minimize discomfort 
were taken by including a small injection of Lidocaine (a numbing medicine) under the skin at the insertion site. A 
radial arterial line was then placed. Radial arterial line placement involves introduc tion of a standard arterial 
catheter or angiocath into the radial artery.  Since the arterial catheter is placed into the artery using a needle, 
mild to moderate discomfort was expected.  Blood samples were drawn to a 3cc arterial blood sample syringe with  
dry lithium heparin. The total amount of blood drawn during the procedure was less than 150cc.  
 
Subjects were reclined for the study. The sensor s were  placed on the  right  wrist  of each subject to evaluate the 
SpO 2 accuracy performance. As a secondary goal , the Pulse Rate accuracy was evaluated over the range of oxygen 
saturation levels elicited during the study.  
 
Subjects were given medical grade mixtures of oxygen and nitrogen to induce stable plateaus across the range of 
100% to 70%. The goal was to have an equal distribution of data by decade. The stable plateaus allowed data 
collection in the following SaO2 ranges 95 -100, 90 -95, 85 -90, 80 -85, 75 -80, 67 -75. In general, 4 to 8 discrete points 
were collected at each of the levels such that the overall data of the population was evenly distributed by decade 
and the minimum number of points was met for the data analysis. Fewer data points were expected in subjects 
that were unable to tolerate the duration of the lower hypoxic levels. Data was collected un der non -motion 
conditions. Arterial blood samples were drawn simultaneously to SpO 2 data collection and measured immediately 
on the gold standard Reference CO -Oximeters.  
 
After the test, the clinician reviewed any final questions raised by the subject and the subject was released. Follow 
up was made to subjects post study for any questions regarding the study and status of the site where the arterial 
line was placed. There were no significant adverse events reported.  
 
The endpoint comparator for data collection was a minimum of 200 points evenly distributed across the full range 
of 70 -100% SaO 2 on at least ten subjects as well as to document the accuracy for the specified range of 70 -100%. 
The Accuracy Root Mean Square (A RMS) calculation was used for s tatistical analysis comparison for the test device 
vs Reference CO -Oximetry, functional SaO 2. The pulse rate accuracy was also documented over the range realized 
from the hypoxia changes across the range of 70 -100% SaO 2. 
 
Data analysis results provide docu mentation showing SpO 2 and Pulse Rate accuracy performance of the 
VitalDetect™  pulse oximetry  as compared to arterial blood samples measured by Reference CO -Oximetry  and ECG 
heart rate respectively .

The passing criteria identified in the clinical investig ation plan  for oxygen saturation  was an A RMS specification of 
3.0% or less under steady state / non -motion conditions for the range 70 -100%. Data analysis results provide 
documentation showing SpO 2 accuracy performance of the VitalDetect™  pulse oximetry  as compared to arterial 
blood samples measured by Reference CO -Oximetry.  
 
The pulse rate accuracy was compared to ECG Heart Rate as recorded by the S5 Multi -parameter monitor. Passing 
criteria was an ARMS of 3 bpm or better based measurements observed during  the pulse oximetry evaluation.  
 
3. Results  
Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval1 was obtained for  validation  testing. The study was conducted November 
4-5, 2019 , in the Clinimark Laboratories located in Avista Adventist Hospital Plaza in Louisville, CO in accordance  
with the study procedure2. There were no deviations to the study procedure. Eleven subjects  were screen with all 
being  enrolled into the study . Following the study, one subject was identified as having poor sensor placement  and 
as well as an incorrect time sync with the control oximeter. This subject  was not included in the data analysis . Each 
subject was cannulated with an indwelling catheter in the left radial artery. The control oximeter3 was attached to 
the hand on the cannulated side t o evaluate the stability of the SpO 2 level during the data collection process. 
Testing was conducted under non -motion conditions.  The device under test was VitalDetect™  pulse oximetry . 
 
Each subject was presented with various levels of induced hypoxia resulting in stable oxygen saturation levels  
between 100% and 70% SaO 2. Arterial blood draws were collected under non -motion conditions. SpO 2 and Pulse 
Rate values from the pulse oximeters as well as the Reference ECG Heart Rate values were collected elect ronically 
at one second intervals simultaneously to blood drawn from the indwelling catheter. Four to eight arterial blood 
samples were collected, approximately 20 -40 seconds apart for each stable level. The blood was immediately 
analyzed by the Reference CO-Oximeter4 to measure the arterial oxygen saturation (Functional SaO 2).  
 
All subjects completed the study without incidence. The stable data from each system for ten subjects was 
included for analysis. There were no serious adverse events or adverse dev ice effects during the study.

points needed for the analysis and handling of missing data or data that is removed from the analysis. Complying 
with the standards was achieved through more than 200 paired observations of Test and Reference  values equally 
distributed over the specified SpO 2 accuracy range (70 -100%) of the device under test. The data was collected on 
healthy adult volunteer subjects who range in age, gender and skin tone with at least two subjects having deep 
skin pigmentatio n tones. Controls for the study were maintained by using a control oximeter to assess the stability 
of the plateaus for data collection and a Reference Standard Pulse Oximetry value for oxygen saturation level of 
the subject during the study. An Accuracy R oot Mean Square (A RMS) calculation was used to determine SpO 2 
Accuracy as compared to “gold standard” measurements of blood SaO 2 by Reference CO -Oximetry.  Simultaneous 
to oxygen saturation measurements, pulse rate from the test device and the Reference ECG  monitor were 
collected for comparison.  
 
4.1 Control Oximeter Stability handling:  
The data was analyzed in the following manner. The Control Oximeter SpO 2 data was reviewed for Stability. The 
data points are considered unstable and removed prior to the ana lysis:  
- if the Control Oximeter SpO 2 value varies by >2% during the draw  
- if the combined minimum and maximum deviations of the Control Oximeter SpO 2 value are > 3%  during the 
review period of 20 -30 sec prior to draw period through the draw as defined by IS O 80601 -2-61:201 7. 
 
4.2 Test SpO2 Data handling:  
Data recorded as 100% or higher was removed prior to the analysis.  Data collected under poor perfusion 
conditions or invalid / zero readings  were  also removed prior to the analysis .  
 
4.3 CO -Oximeter Data ha ndling:  
The third step in the process was to review the CO -Oximetry data for outliers or anomalous readings prior to 
pairing of the CO -Oximeter value with the test device SpO 2 value.  
 
The CO -Oximeter data was reviewed for outliers or anomalous readings fro m which these plateaus were subject to 
removal. The functional oxygen saturation value was used for the basis of comparison to SpO 2 value collected from 
the pulse oximeter. Subjects with elevated COHB (>3%), MetHb (>2%) and/or tHb (<10g/dl) levels were exc luded 
from the data collection. The tHb, COHb, MetHb values were reviewed for consistency to the other draws for each 
subject. If those values were found to not be similar in readings for a given subject, then it is determined that the 
reference value was unstable and the point was to be removed from the analysis.  
 
Draws with CO -Oximeter data that were <67% were excluded from the analysis for the evaluation of the accuracy 
specification claim. Overall stable data 70 -100% SaO 2 is presented in the statistics  for each graph. Summary 
statistics includes data for claims only.  
 
A rationale was provided for data that was excluded from the data analysis due to the Control Oximeter Stability, 
the Test Device and the Reference CO -Oximetry values. Please refer to the  Line Listing  below  for the rational of 
excluded data.  
 
4.4 Description of Statistics  
The final step was to pair the remaining CO -Oximeter functional SO 2 value with the Test device SpO 2. 
Ref = Reference CO -Oximetry SO 2 
DUT = Device Under test SpO 2, pulse oximetry system . 
 
For Pulse Rate:

Discussion by subject for noticeable outliers with offsets >5%:  
There were twenty -eight  points  or 12% of the data,  that were considered as outliers , reading >5% from the 
Reference CO -Oximeter reading. Subject # 1 (9 pts), Subject #2  (2 pts), Subject #4 (1 pt), Subject #8 (8 pts), Subject 
#10 (8 pts).  All points  with a reading >5% from the Reference occurred below 80%.  Of the outlying points, only 
errors for Subject #10 were in the positive direction. Additionally, the data appeared to have a hard lower limit of 
65% in the readings.  It is expected that  greater scatter will occur in the lower oxygen saturation range.  The amount 
of errors observed resulted in a poorer A RMS performance.   6065707580859095100

6. Conclusions  
The Accuracy root mean square (A RMS) between measured SpO 2 and reference SaO 2 did not meet a 3.0% 
specification for the VitalDetect pulse oximetry .  The results for SpO 2 accuracy as indicated below is an A RMS of 3.1. 
ARMS is based on statistically distributed measurements, therefore, a sensor/oximeter with an A RMS specification of 
3, is expected to have approximately 68% of the data points fall within that range. This in turn means that 
approximately one -third of the measurements fall outside the range of ± 3 of the reference SaO 2.   
 
The SpO 2 and Pulse Rate accuracy performance results showed the following A RMS values for the SaO 2 range of 70 -
100%.

Note: The range of 70% to 100% includes reference data down to 67%.  
 
The results of the study provide evidence t hat the VitalDetectTM pulse oximetry  fails to meet  an A RMS specification 
of 3.0% under steady state / non -motion conditions for the range 70 -100%.  It is recommended that the sponsor 
review and determine a means to improve accuracy performance especially for  SpO2 levels <80%.  
 
Reviewing the pulse rate accuracy, VitalDetectTM pulse oximetry  provides accurate pulse rate values for the range 
of 50-119 bpm, observed during simultaneous data collectio n of oxygen saturation levels between 70-100%.

Clinical Phase  III Pivotal  
Coordinating Investigator   
Study Objectives The primary objective of this study  is to demonstrate that the 
rate of acute serious bacterial infections (i.e., the mean 
number of acute serious bacterial infections per 
subject -year) is less than 1.0  to provide substantial evidence 
of efficacy. The secondary objectives of this study , in 
addition to further efficacy assessments, are to evaluate the 
safety and pharmacokinetic  characteristics of BT595.  
Study Design  Open -label, prospective, multicenter , multinational . 
Study Population Male or female subject s (age: 2 -75 years , inclusive ) with 
PID. For those countries where local regulations permit 
enrolment of adult subjects only, subject recruitment will be 
restricted to those who are 18  through 75  years.  
Inclusion Criteria  a) Written informed consent /assent obtained from 
subject s/subject s’ parent (s) or legal ly acceptable

(CVID) as defined by the European Society for 
Immunodeficiencies (ESID)/Pan American Group for 
Immunodeficiency (PAGID) diagnostic criteria . 
Or 
- X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) as defined by 
ESID/PAGID diagnostic criteria.  
d) Established replacement therapy with any intravenous 
immunoglobulin (IVIg) reference preparation during the 
previous 6 months, including documentation of 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) trough levels.  
e) Established replacement therapy with a single IVIg 
reference preparation for at least 3 months prior to 
treatment start with BT595 at a 3- or 4-week schedule 
with a  constant IVIg dose  that did not change by ±20% of 
the mean dose, regular dosage intervals, and at least 
1 IgG trough level of ≥5 g/L during the previous 
3 months.

no safety concerns (as reviewed by the Data and Safety 
Monitoring Board).  
About 70 subject s will have to be enrolled to account for 
drop-outs.  
Countries/Number of 
Study Sites  About 25  sites in Europe and the United States.  
Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) BT595: human normal IVIg for intravenous ( iv) 
administration (10 g/100  mL). 
Dosage and Mode of Administration  Dosage:  Planned doses in a range of 0.2  to 0.8  g/kg body 
weight (bw) (2  to 8 mL/kg bw) as an iv infusion at 3 - or 
4-week intervals for a treatment period of approximately 
12 months.  
The initial dose and dosage interval must be consistent with 
the subject ’s prestudy IVIg treatment and the initial dose and 
dosage interval will only be changed if medically indic ated. 
This change will be at the investigator’s discretion. 
Infusion rate:  BT595 should be infused intravenously at an 
initial rate of 0.3 mL/kg/h for 30 minutes, to be increased to  
1.4 mL/kg/h for a further 30 minutes. If well tolerated, the 
rate of administration may then be gradually increased to a 
maximum of 2.0  mL/kg/h for the remainder of the first 
infusion. From the second infusion, i n subjects who have 
tolerated the infusion rate of 2.0  mL/kg/h well, the rate may 
be gradually increased to 4 mL/kg/h and, if still tolerated 
well, it may be further increased gradually to 6 mL/kg/h, and 
to a maximum of 8  mL/kg/h.  
In general, subject s’ infusion rates will be individually 
tailored at the discretion of the invest igator , but must always 
start again at an initial rate of 0.3  mL/kg/h . 
Duration of Treatment  Approximately 12  months per subject .

SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 9 of 82 - Pharmacokinetics  Pharmacokinetic (PK) endpoints:  
• IgG trough levels (total  IgG) before  each administration. 
• IgG trough levels (subclasses  1-4) at baseline and 
before the 7 th/5th infusion of the 3 -week/4- week 
schedule, respectively (with the exception of pediatric 
subjects aged 2- 5 years, inclusive) . 
• IgG trough levels of specific antibody levels  
(anti-pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide,  
anti-hemophilus influenzae type B, anti -measles, 
anti-tetanus, anti -cytomegalovirus, and 
anti-HBs/hepatitis  B) at baseline and before the 
7th/5th infusion of the 3- week/4- week schedule, 
respectively (with the exception of pediatric subjects 
aged 2- 11 years, inclusive) . 
 
A homecare service is allowed for the PK sampling of 
pediatric subjects (2- 17 years, inclusive).  
Subjects will complete serial blood sampling according to 
their age category . For adult subjects (18- 75 years, 
inclusive) and pediatric subjects (6- 17 years, inclusive), 
samples will be taken at a fixed series of  time points  after 
the 7th /5th infusion (according to treatment schedule) . For 
pediatric subjects (2-5 years, inclusive), sparse sampling at 
flexible time  points within specified time windows after the 
end of this  infusion may be performed (note: these sam ples 
are optional).  Evaluable data from at least 20 adult subjects  
and all available pediatric data will be included in the PK 
analysis. Analysis of the concentration- time profiles will be 
used to derive key PK parameters for total  IgG, 
IgG subclasses 1- 4, and IgG  specific antibody levels 
following simple noncompartmental analysis or a more 
appropriate approach including population analysis.  For 
pediatric subjects , analysis for total  IgG will be from pediatric 
subjects aged 2 through 17 years, analysis  for 
IgG subclasses 1-4 will be from pediatric subjects aged 
6 through 17 years, and analysis for IgG  specific antibody 
levels will be from pediatric subjects aged 12  through 
17 years only . 
The following key PK parameters will be derived from the 
analysis : maximum concentration (C max), time to reach 
maximum concentration (t max), trough concentration (C trough), 
area under the concentration- time curve (AUC) calculated 
from time zero to time t of the last measured concentration 
(AUC (0-t)), area under the concentration- time curve 
calculated from start to end of the dosing interval (AUC tau), 
steady -state clearance (CLss), volume of distribution at 
steady -state (Vss), %Fluctuation, and if data permit, terminal 
elimination half -life (t 1/2), area under the conc entration- time 
curve calculated from time zero extrapolated to infinity 
(AUC (0-inf)), mean residence time (MRT), and terminal 
elimination rate constant (λz ).

SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 10  of 82  The efficacy, safety, and PK results of this study will be 
compared to historical  data from previous PID studies with 
Intratect and Bivigam  (already marketed 10% IVIgs ), as well 
as to available data from literature.  
Biostatist ical Concept  A sample size of at least 50  evaluable subject s is 
considered a sufficient number to evaluate the primary study 
endpoint according to the relevant FDA and EMA guidelines. 
A sample size of at least 50 subject s will ensure a power of 
at least 80% to reject the null hypothesis of an acute serious 
bacterial infection rate greater or equal to 1.0  by means of a 
1-sided test and a Type 1 error of 0.01  assuming a true 
underlying rate of acute serious bacterial infections of 
0.5 per year.  
The primary endpoint is the rate of acute serious bacterial 
infections (i.e., the mean number of acute serious bacterial 
infections per subject -year). The null hypothesis of 1 or 
more acute serious bacterial infections per subject -year will 
be tested against the 1-sided alternative hypothesis of less 
than 1 acute serious bacterial infection per subject -year at 
the 1% level of statistical significance. This 1- sided 
hypothesis test will utilize a Poisson model as used for the 
calculation of the upper confidence limit. Rejection of the 
null hypothesis o f 1 or more acute serious bacterial infection 
per subject -year will result in the acceptance of the alternate 
hypothesis of less than 1 acute serious bacterial infection 
per subject -year.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints and safety endpoints will be 
analyzed descriptively. Exploratory 2- sided 90% confidence 
intervals will be calculated for the total incidence of AEs and 
of temporally associated AEs. Exploratory upper 1- sided 
95% confidence limits will be calculated for the proportion of 
infusions temporally associated with 1 or more AE.  
Analyses of the IgG trough levels and PK parameters wil l be 
done descriptively and presented graphically , including a 
comparison of the IgG  trough levels by analyte (total  IgG, 
IgG subclasses , and IgG  specific antibody levels ), treatment 
schedule (3-week and 4- week schedule) , and age categor y. 
Evaluation of total IgG trough levels will include the 
calculation of the proportion of subject s who failed to meet 
the target level (≥5 g/L) prior to dose adjustment, and an 
intra-individual comparison to trough levels of the former 
IVIg product (i .e., using prestudy d ata). No formal statistical 
test will be performed for these variables.

a A time window of ±2 days will be allowed for the treatment period visits and the closing (follow -up) visit; however, this time window will not apply 
for the PK assessments. Pharmacokinetic  assessments will follow time point specific time windows . 
b The physical examination will be followed- up with a verbal exchange (face- to-face) between the subject and the investigator 1  hour after the end 
of each infusion, and a verbal exchange (by telephone) 24 and 72  hours after the end of each infusion . 
c Vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate) will be assessed within 30 minutes before each infusion, 15  to 30  minutes after the start of 
each infusion, 15 to 30 minutes after the end of each infusion, and 15 to 30 minutes after the start of any change in the infusion rate.  In any case 
where the change in infusion rate is sooner than a 15  minute interval, vital signs should be measured prior to the change. The vital sign, 
temperature, will be recorded within 30 minutes before each infusion only.

h At the 7th infusion ( Week  18 [3-week schedule] ) or 5th infusion ( Week  16 [4-week schedule] ), serum samples for the PK analysis  of total  IgG, 
IgG subclasses  1-4, and IgG specific antibody levels ( anti-pneum ococcal capsular polysaccharide, anti-hemophilus influenzae type  B, 
anti-measles, anti -tetanus, anti -cytomegalovirus, and anti -HBs/hepatitis  B) will be drawn from subjects (6 -75 years, inclusive  for total  IgG and 
IgG subclasses  1-4; 12- 75 years inclusive for IgG specific antibody levels ) at the following time points: predose (i.e., 10 to 30  minutes before the 
infusion) , 10 to 30 minutes postinfusion (end of infusion), 4 and 24 hours  postinfusion; and 4, 7, 14, 21  days  (for the 3 -week and the 4- week 
treatment schedule ), and 28 days post infusion  (4-week schedule only) . For pediatric subjects (2-5 years, inclusive), sparse sampling for PK 
analysis of total  IgG only may be performed at flexible tim e points within specified time windows after the end of the infusion (note: these samples 
are optional).  
I For detecting any hemolytic outcome the first two infusions (V2, V3) should be followed up on the following visit (V3, V4) for the first 10 patients by 
analyzing Coombs test and test of haptoglobin .

Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) are a class of disorders in which there is an 
intrinsic defect in the human immune system. Since the original description of X -linked 
agammaglobulinemia (XLAs) in 1952, the number of independent PIDs has expanded to more than 100 entities.  
 Intravenous administr ation of immunoglobulins is a well -established therapy in patients 
with primary or secondary immune deficiencies and recurrent infections. The primary aim of therapy is to prevent infections by substituting missing antibodies. Moreover, 
immunoglobulins have a modulating effect on the immune system and may therefore 
also be helpful in the treatment of recurrent infections and autoimmune diseases  
(Björkander  et al, 2006;  Chapel  et al, 2014; Imbach  et al, 2010; Schwab and 
Nimmerjahn, 2013;  Lünemann et al, 2015). 
 Immunoglobulin G Next Generation (BT595) is a normal immunoglobulin preparation 
manufactu red from human plasma. BT595 is a sterile, highly purified solution of human 
normal immunoglobulin for intravenous administration (IVIg) containing, in concentrated form, all the immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that regularly occur in the 
donor population. BT595 contains 100  mg human plasma protein per mL of solution 
(i.e., 10% ready -for-use solution).  
 Fundamental knowledge on the manufacturing conditions of the licensed IVIg products at Biotest AG formed the basis for the development of BT595. To optimize the 
production process, Biotest has established a new process aiming to produce an intravenously tolerated IgG preparation with a low content of polymers and high purity. 
The manufacturing process of BT595 ensures the required viral safety and provides a reproducible quality.   Further details on the manufacturing process are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
 To date, n o clinical studies have previously been conducted with BT595 but 
pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and the efficacy and safety profile are expected to be comparable with other currently licensed immunoglobulin products, including Bivigam  
(Biotest's intravenous immunoglobulin [ IGIV] 100 g/L; licensed in the United States) 
and Intratect, the IVIg preparation available in 2  strengths (50 g/L and 100  g/L) and 
marketed by Biotest  in the EU and other international markets as  a replacement 
therapy for patients with PID as well as for other antibody -deficiency/autoimmune 
diseases.  
 With Bivigam , 1 clinical study has been performed in 63  subjects with PID ( Wasserman  
et al, 2012) . These subjects received a total of 746  infusions over approximately 
12 months. Forty subjects were reported with adverse events (AEs) that were related 
to the study product . The majority of the AEs were mild to moderate. The reported AE s 
were in the expected profile for IGIVs.  
 With Intratect (50 g/L), 3  clinical studies have been performed: 2 in subjects with PID 
(Study  941 [2002]  and Study  957 [ Kreuz  et al, 2010]) and 1 in subjects with idiopathic

SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 20 of 82  thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP; Study  942 [ Colovic  et al, 2003]). In the 2  PID studies, 
overall 68 subjects were treated over a period of 6  and 12  months, respectively.  
 
With Intratect (100  g/L), 1  clinical study (Study  981 [ Krivan  et al, 2015]) has been 
performed over 3 to 6 months in 30 subjects with PID.  These 30 subject s received a 
total of 165 infusions , where a total of 19 infusions (11.5%) were associated with 
adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The majority of these ADRs were mild to moderate and self -limiting. No serious ADR was observed during this study. The reported ADRs 
were consistent with the expected profile for IVIgs.   
 Study  981 demonstrated that the PK and safety profile of Intratect (100 g/L) is 
consistent with those of Intratect (50 g/L) and other IVIg products. Moreover, the data 
demonstrated that the escalation of infusion rates of Intratect (100  g/L) can lead to the 
identification of an individual’s maximum tolerated infusion rate, which is well -tolerated 
and safe when administered at subsequent infusions.  
 The goal of the current clinical development plan is the parallel development of BT595 in European and United States’ regulatory regions. Three  studies are planned for the 
clinical development of BT595 which consider both European Medicines Agency  
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94033/2007 rev. 2, 2010 ) and Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA, 2008) guidelines for the PID and ITP indications, as well as recently -published 
and ongoing studies in the chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy indication. The plan is to begin with a PID  study in Europe and the United States to 
obtain PK data for BT595, as well as safety and efficacy data of long -term replacement 
therapy in this target indication in  adult and pediatric subjects.  
 In the present  study , subject s will receive intravenous infusions of BT595 at a dose and 
dosage interval consistent with their prestudy  IVIg treatment. The planned schedule for 
the gradual increase of the infusion rate is based on the results of Clinical Study  981 
(Krivan  et al, 2015) which showed a good tolerability of Intratect (100 g/L); however, 
the infusion rate will be individualized for each subject .  
 In conclusion, due to comparable quality/biologic characteristic s of BT595 and based 
on the clinical experience with the already -marketed Intratect, it is predicted that BT595 
will have an acceptable safety profile, even at the scheduled increased infusion rate. The principal benefit for the participating PID subject s will be to receive their required 
immunoglobulin replac ement  therapy that will have the antiinfective effect already 
demonstrated for Intratect. Balancing the risk of a limited increase in frequency of maximally mild to moderate adverse reactions with the expected benefit for subject s 
and resource savings for the health care system, the expected benefits of the study  
clearly exceed the expected risks.  Thus, the benefit -risk ratio of BT595 is considered 
favorable and the use of BT595 in this clinical study i s justified.  
2 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
The main purpose of this study  is to assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics 
of BT595 in subjects with PID. The primary objective of this study  is to demonstrate 
that the rate of acute serious bacterial infections (i.e., the mean number of acute 
serious bacterial infections per subject year) is less than 1.0  to provide substantial

efficacy assessments, are to evaluate the safety and PK characteristics of BT595.  
3 STUDY DESIGN  
This is an open- label , prospective, uncontrolled, multicenter  Phase III Pivotal study  to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of the human normal 
immunoglobulin for intravenous administration BT595 in subject s with PID.  
 The rate of acute serious bacterial infection – the primary efficacy endpoint - will also 
be compared to historical data from previous PID studies  with Intratect and Bivigam 
(already marketed 10% IVIgs ) as well as  to available data from literature. These data 
will be provided by Biotest by the time of the analyses.  
 About 70 subject s will be enrolled to ensure data are available for at least 50  evaluable 
subjec ts. At least 20 subject s should be adult subject s (18-75 years, inclusive) . At least 
20 subjects should be pediatric subject s (i.e., children [ 2-11 years , inclusive ] or 
adolescents [12- 17 years , inclusive ]), with the age distribution representative of the PID 
patient population. Age will be the age recorded at screening (initial visit). The same age will be used per subject  during the entire study  (i.e., if a subject ’s age changes 
from 17  years to 18 years during the study , the subject will remain in the age category 
of 12  through  17 years during the entire study ). 
 A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be used to monitor the safety data of at least 10 adult subjects (18-75 years , inclusive ) (Section 9.4) before any pediatric 
subject s are enrol led to the study . The DSMB will review these data and provide 
recommendations on the suitability of the enrolment of p ediatric subjects in the study . 
The final decision to enrol l/not enrol l pediatric subject s will be the responsibility of the 
sponsor.  
 Efficacy and safety will be assessed from baseline ( Week  0) to the closing (follow -up) 
visit ( Week  54 [3-week schedule]/ Week  56 [4-week schedule]). For the baseline visit 
and the treatment period visits, subject s will remain at the site for at least 1 hour 
following the end of infusion and any new AEs will be reported to the investigator at the site. All changes in concomitant medications and any AEs following subject  discharge 
from the site must be reported continuously (by subject  diary) between site visits. The 
duration of treatment will be approximately 12 months per subject . In addition, all 
subjec ts will attend a closing (follow -up) visit up to 3 or 4 weeks (depending on the 
subject ’s treatment schedule) following the final treatment visit.  
 Serum samples for detailed PK analysis will be taken at a fixed series of time points 
after the 7th /5th infusion of the 3 -week/4- week schedule, respectively, from at least 
20 adult subject s (18-75 years , inclusive ) and from pediatric subjects (6- 17 years , 
inclusive ). For pediatric subjects (2-5 years, inclusive), sparse sampling at flexible time  
points within specified time windows after the end of the infusion may be performed (note: these samples are optional). Evaluable data from at least 20 adult subjec ts and 
all available pediatric data will be included in the PK analysis. Analysis of the concentration- time profiles will be used to derive key PK parameters  for total  IgG, IgG 
subclasses 1- 4, and IgG  specific antibody levels  (anti-pneumococcal capsular

anti-cytomegalovirus, and anti -HBs/hepatitis  B). 
 
Further details on the assessment schedule that will be used for the assessment of the efficacy, safety, and PK parameters in this study  are presented in a flowchart in 
Section  III. 
 The design of this study  follows the EMA guidelines (“Guideline on the Clinical 
Investigation of Human Normal Immunoglobulin for Intravenous Administration [IVIg]” ; 
EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94033/2007 rev. 2, 2010 ) and the FDA guidelines (“ Guidance for 
Industry - Safety, Efficacy, and Pharmacokinetic Studies to Support Marketing of 
Immune Globulin Intravenous [Human] as Replacement Therapy for Primary Humoral Immunodeficiency” ; FDA, 2008) applicable to the PID study  type.  
 As the current regulatory goal is to receive marketing authorization in both the United States and European regions, this clinical study will be carried out in parallel in sites in the United States and Europe; thus, taking into account guidelines from both regions that provide specific recommendations on the general principles for the design of a clinical investigation of human normal immunoglobulin products for intravenous administration as replacement therapy in patients with PID. These guidelines also provide recommendations on the primary efficacy endpoint , secondary efficacy 
endpoints, and safety endpoints to be assessed in a study of this type. The present study will follow these guidelines to demonstrate clinical evidence of the efficacy and safety of BT595, and as such, the efficacy and safety endpoints  used in this study are 
consistent with the recommendations made by both the EMA and the FDA. All safety signals, including short -term tolerance, will be closely monitored in this study. In 
addition, all PK parameters recommended by the EMA and FDA guideli nes will be 
calculated to support the pharmacological activity and efficacy of BT595.

It is planned to enrol l about 70 male or female subject s (2-75 years , inclusive) with PID 
and established replacement therapy in approximately 25 sites in Europe and the 
United States, with about 2-3 subject s per site. For those countries where local 
regulations permit enrolment of adult subjects only, subject recruitment will be restricted to those who are 18 through 75  years.  The goal is to have at least 
50 evaluable subject s in this study . At least 20  of the evaluable subject s should be 
pediatric subject s (i.e., children [ 2-11 years , inclusive ] or adolescents [12- 17 years , 
inclusive ]), with the age distribution representative of the PID patient population. At 
least 20 of the evaluable subjects should be adult subjects. Age will be the age 
recorded at screening (initial visit). The same age will be used per subject  during the 
entire study. At least 10  adult subjects will receive at least 2 BT595 infusions with no 
safety concerns (as reviewed by the DSMB; Section  9.4) before any pediatric subject s 
begin the study .

A subject and/or his /her parent (s) or legally acceptable representative is/are entitled to 
discontinue participation in the clinical study at their own request at any time without 
stating a reason.  
 The investigator can terminate a subject's participation in the study at any time if continuation could lead to disadvantages for the subject which cannot be justified by the investigator.  
 The participation of subject s may be stopped following guidance from the DSMB 
(Section 9.4). 
 The reason for withdrawal of the subject must be documented by the investigator together with all data collected until the day of premature study termination, including 
laboratory results and assessment of AE s. All examinations foreseen for the subject ’s 
last study visit (e .g., closing [follow -up] visit) should be performed.  
 In case a subject withdraws due to an AE  or serious adverse event (SAE), please 
follow the instructions given in Appendix  2 of this protocol.  
 Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced. 
4.5 Subjects ’ Information  
The subject and/or - if applicable – his/her legally acceptable representative
 will be 
informed about the clinical study according to the requirements of Good Clinical 
Practice ( GCP ) and the legal requirements of the country in which the subject is 
recruited.   
 The clinical study, its objectives, possible benefits and risks, and its consequences will 
be verbally explained to the subject and/or his/her legally acceptable representative. Moreover, the subject and/or his/her legally acceptable representative
 is/are provided 
with written information about the clinical study. Sufficient time will be allowed for the 
informati on to be read and for questions to be asked. Attention should be paid to any 
signs of undue distress in pediatric subjects who are unable to clearly indicate their distress ( ICH Harmonised Tripartite  Guideline ; E11 Step 4, 2000). The subject and/or 
his/her legally acceptable representative must be told that refusal to participat e in the 
clinical study does not cause any disadvantages to their treatment; similarly, 
withdrawal of written informed consent /assent  is possible at any time, without stating a 
reason, and without prejudice to further medical management.  
 Subjects and/or his/her legally acceptable representative
 should be informed and 
should agree that medical data may be reviewed by authorized persons during monitoring and during an audit or an inspection by the appointed R egulatory Authority 
or Ethics C ommittee, but that personal data will be treated with absolute confidentiality.

BT595 should not be mixed with any other product.  
6 STUDY  TREATMENT  
6.1 Dosage Regimen  
BT595 will be administered at 3- or 4 -week intervals for a treatment period of 
approximately 12 months . The initial dose and dosage intervals must be consistent 
with the subject ’s prestudy  IVIg treatment and the initial dose and dosage interval will 
only be changed if medically indicated. This change will be at the investigator’s discretion.  
6.2 Dosage and Administration 
The planned dose of BT595 is 0.2  to 0.8  g/kg body weight ( bw; 2 to 8 mL/kg) 
administered as intravenous infusions at 3- or 4-week intervals for a treatment period 
of approximately 12 months.  
 Infusion rate:  BT595 should  be infused intravenously at an initial rate of 0.3  mL/kg/h 
for 30 minutes, to be increased to 1.4 mL/kg/h for a further 30 minutes. If well tolerated, 
the rate of administration may then be gradually increased to a maximum of 
2.0 mL/kg/h for the remainder of the first infusion. Every infusion must start again at an 
initial rate of 0.3  mL/kg/h. From the second infusion, i n subject s who have tolerated the 
infusion rate of 2.0  mL/kg/h  well, the rate may be gradually increased to 4 mL/kg/h, and 
Study No.: 991  Final Version 4.0 Clinical Study Protocol

IND No.: 17046   21-MAR -2018  
 
SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 28  of 82  if still tolerated well, it may be further increased gradually to 6 mL/kg/h, and to a 
maximum of 8  mL/kg/h.  
 
From the second infusion, subjects ’ infusion rates may be individually tailored (i .e., a 
certain infusion rate for a certain time period) at the discretion of the investigator , but 
must start again at an initial infusion rate of 0.3 mL/kg/h . This means that the 30 minute 
interval may be shortened to less than 30  minutes if deemed appropriate for the 
subject. Changes in infusion rates (increases and/or decreases)  and the respective 
time of day must be documented.   
 In case of a decrease in infusion rate or an interruption of infusion as a consequence of 
an AE, all AE details must be recorded in the eCRF.  
6.2.1  Dose Changes d uring the Study  
The subject ’s total IgG trough levels from the previous infusion will be assessed at the 
local laboratory to allow dose adjustment at the next infusion if a subject ’s trough level 
was below 5 g/L. Serum trough levels of IgG ≥5 g/L must be met throughout the study . 
If a subject ’s IgG level changes to <5  g/L, the subject ’s dose must be adjusted to meet 
the target trough levels. Dose changes will be made at the investigator’s discretion and must follow the dosage regimen detailed in Section  6.2 (i.e., 0.2 to 0.8  g/kg bw [2  to 
8 mL/kg]  administered as intravenous infusions at 3- or 4-week intervals ). 
 Body weight will be assessed before each study infusion in order to calculate an accurate dose for each subject ’s dose infusion. The investigator will calculate the 
percentage change in the subject’s body weight since the last assessment. If a 
subject ’s body weight changes by <5% from the weight used for the current dose, the 
total dose will remain the same as the current dose. If a subject ’s body weight changes 
by ≥5% from the weight  used for the current dose, the total dose (g), but not the dose 
per weight (g/kg), will be adjusted accordingly  to maintain a constant dose in 
g/kg/infusion during the study . 
 Any changes in dose and the reason for the change in dose will be recorded in the eCRF.  
6.3 Compliance with Dosage Regimens  
BT595 will be administered intravenously by the instructed study  staff. If a subject’s 
treatment deviates from the dosage regimen ( e.g., a dosing interruption occurs due to 
the occurrence  of an AE), this will be recorded in the eCRF (Section  6.2). 
 If a subject fails to comply with the dosage regimen (i .e., misses ≥1 dose[s] of BT595), 
the subject will be considered to be noncompliant and may be terminated prematurely 
from the study . The decision to terminate a subject from the study  prematurely will be 
at the investigator’s discretion after consultation with the sponsor . Details of any  
deviations from the dosage regimen will be recorded in the eCRF.  
6.4 Dose Justification  
The planned monthly dose of BT595 is in the range of 200 to 800 mg/kg bw (2 to 
8 mL/kg bw) in 3- or 4- week intervals for a treatment period of approximately 
12 months. This schedule follows the recommendation in the EU -Core Summary of 
Product Characteristi cs (SmPC ) for human normal immunoglobulin for intravenous 
Study No.: 991  Final Version 4.0 Clinical Study Protocol  
EudraCT No.: 2015 -003652 -52/ 
IND No.: 17046   21-MAR -2018  
 
SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 29  of 82  administration as replacement therapy in subject s with PID  
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94038/2007 rev.  4, 2012 ). 
 
Accordingly, the dose and dosage interval must be consistent with the subjects’ prestudy  standard IVIg treatment and only changed if medically indicated. The dose 
needs to be individualized for each subject depending on the subject’s total IgG  trough 
levels (the dose may need to be adjusted to meet target subject trough levels 
[measured before the next infusion ] of ≥5 g/L). 
 The infusion rate is planned to be escalated from 0.3 mL/kg/h to a maximum of 
8 mL/kg/h , initially at 30 minute intervals. Although no clinical studies have previously 
been conducted with BT595, it is expected from previous experience with Intratect that a relevant proportion of subjects will tolerate this escalation procedure up to an individually determined maximum tolerated infusion r ate. The use of premedications to 
prevent AEs should be avoided in this study , if possible ( Section  6.10). 
 In the clinical study conducted with Intratect at 100 g/L (Study  981; Krivan  et al, 2015), 
subjec ts with PID received Intratect at the established dose and dosing interval of their 
previous reference IVIg therapy. The study was designed to gradually escalate infusion rates from 0.3 to 1.4  mL/kg/h to 2.0 mL/kg/h (in Part  A; 30  subjec ts) to 0.3  to 
1.4 mL/kg/h to 4.0 mL/kg/h to a maximum of 8.0 mL/kg/h (in Part  B; 25  subjec ts). Of 
the 25 subjec ts treated in Part  B, 16  subjects (64.0%) achieved an individual maximum 
tolerated infusion rate of 6.0  or 8.0  mL/kg/h at their 4th  infusion and only 4 subjects 
(16%)  had individual maximum tolerated rates of <4.0 mL/kg/h.  The 30 subjec ts in the 
study (Part  A and Part  B) received a total of 165 infusions of Intratect, where a total of 
19 infusions (11.5%) were associated with ADRs. Overall, 5 subjec ts (20%) in Part  B 
experienced AEs limiting the infusion rate (all were nonserious). Three subject s 
reported SAEs in the study, but none were related to treatment with Intratect.  
 This study demonstrated that escalation of infusion rates leads to the identification of an individual’s maximum tolerated infusion rate, which is well -tolerated and safe when 
administered at subsequent infusions. The identification of an individual’s maximum tolerated infusion rate allows PID patients and their physicians to choose an infusion rate that shortens the duration of infusion (higher infusion rates reduce the time 
required for infusions). Shorter infusion times reduce the time PID patients spend receiving their IVIg treatment, reducing the burden of this  condition on these chr onically 
ill patients, and lowering the demand for healthcare resources.  
 Infusion rates of up to approximately 8.0 mL/kg/h have been shown to be tolerated for 
other 10% IVIgs: Bivigam  (Wasserman  et al, 2012) , Gamunex  (Gelfand and Hanna, 
2006) , Kiovig  (Björkander  et al, 2006) , and Privigen ( Stein  et al, 2009).
  
 Thus, the administration of BT595 at infusion rates  currently recommended for Intratect 
is expected to demonstrate an acceptable tolerability compared to similar marketed IVIgs.  
6.5 Treatment of Overdose  
Based on the dosage recommendations in  the EU -Core SmPC for human normal 
immunoglobulin for intravenous administration ( EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94038/2007 
rev. 4, 2012), an IVIg dose of more than 2  g/kg is considered to be an overdose in this 
Study No.: 991  Final Version 4.0 Clinical Study Protocol  
EudraCT No.: 2015 -003652 -52/ 
IND No.: 17046   21-MAR -2018  
 
SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 30  of 82  indication . However, within this  PID study design, where doses of 0.2 to 0.8  g/kg are 
recommended for this indication, any dose ≥0.9 g/kg will be reported as an overdose.  
 
BT595 will be administered intravenously by the instructed study  staff; however, in the 
case of accidental overdose,  subjects should be monitored closely for signs of adverse 
reactions . Overdose may lead to fluid overload and hyperviscosity, particularly in 
subject s at risk, including elderly subject s or subject s with renal impairment.  
 Any overdose event will be reported as an AE that must be reported to the sponsor 
within 24 hours of the study site being aware of the AE  (i.e., overdose is an 
immediately reportable adverse event [IRAE]; Appendix  2). 
6.6 Randomization Code  
This is a nonrandomized, open- label clinical study ; therefore , no randomization code is 
required.  
6.7 Procedures for Emergency Unblinding  
This is a nonrandomized, open- label clinical study; therefore , no procedure for 
unblinding is required. 
6.8 Drug Accountability  
The IMP will be supplied to the investigator at the time of site initiation under the 
assumption that all required regulatory documents are in place. The investigator or his/her designee should maintain records that document adequately that the subject s 
were provided the doses specified in the protocol and reconcile all IMPs received for the clinical study . The investigator has to ensure that consignm ents of IMPs  are 
received correctly by a dedicated person (e.g., pharmacy ) and that the IMP  is safely 
and appropriately handled and stored.  
 The investigator or designee is obliged to keep sufficient documentation of the delivery, 
use, and destruction or return of unused, used, or partially used packages of IMP. The 
investigator must allow the monitor to perform drug reconciliation before any IMP is 
returned or destroyed . The documentation must include dates, quantities, subject 
numbers, batch numbers or other identification numbers , and expiry dates.  
 The entries in the eCRF as well as the documentation kept in the Investigator Site File  
will be compared with the returned and residual IMPs, with clarification of any discrepancies or inconsistencies.  
6.9 Previo us and Concomitant Medication or Treatment  
6.9.1  Previous Medication or Treatment  
Previous Established Repl acement Therapy  
Before the subject  enter s the study , the subject  must have been on an established 
replacement therapy with any IVIg reference preparation for at least the previous 6 months. Before treatment starts with BT595 in a 3- or 4-week schedule, the subject 
must have been on an established replacement therapy with a single IVIg reference preparation for at least 3 months. The single IVIg reference pr eparation must have 
Study No.: 991  Final Version 4.0 Clinical Study Protocol  
EudraCT No.: 2015 -003652 -52/ 
IND No.: 17046   21-MAR -2018  
 
SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 31  of 82  been at a constant dose that did not change by ± 20% of the mean dose, at regular 
dosage intervals. This information will be  assessed at the initial visit  and at the baseline 
visit (Day 1) to ensure the subject meets criteria for study  entry and this information will 
be documented in the eCRF.  
 
Other Previous Medications or Treatment s 
In case of blood- derived medications (i .e., administration of blood or blood products), 
documentation will be required for a period of 3 months before inclusion in the study . 
 
Administration of all medication in the 4 weeks before enrol lment will be documented in 
the eCRF. 
6.9.2  Concomitant Medication or Treatment  
Concomitant medication ( other than immunoglobulins ) may be taken as required. All 
routine concomitant medication should be given after information of/consultation with 
the investigator  (i.e., the subject will be instructed to inform the investigator before 
taking any concomitant medications). In case of concomitant medication given  for 
emergency reasons , the investigator should be informed as soon as possible.  
 Full details of any concomitant medication given during the study , including the time of 
its discontinuation, if applicable, will be documented in t he eCRF.  Changes of therapy 
(including changes in regimen) during the study  will be recorded in the e CRF and in the 
subject ’s medical record.  
 For any concomitant medication (including any change in dose) given as treatment for a new or worsened condition after the first infusion of study  treatment, the investigator 
will record  the condition as an AE in the eCRF.  
6.10 Prohibited Medication or Treatment 
If not required by an emergency situation, passive or active immuni zations, 
administration of plasma preparations, or administration of other immunoglobulins is not allowed during the study . In such instances, the subject  will be withdrawn from the 
study . 
 Subject s who are prone to AEs occurring in conjunction with the infusion of IVIg 
products are often premedicated with antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or steroids. In this study , however, the use of premedications should be avoided (if possible), except 
in cases where such premedication is important to the safety of the study  subject . The 
use of any premedication must be approved by the principal investigator before use 
and recorded in the concomitant medication record in the eCRF. 
6.11 Warnings  and Precautions  
The safety profile of BT595 is expected to be comparable to Intratect ( 100 g/L; a 10% 
IVIg marketed in the EU and i nternational markets ), Bivigam (a 10% I GIV marketed in 
the United States),  and other 10% IVIgs on the market. For further details, see the 
Investigator’s Brochure .

Standard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma will include selection of donors, screening of 
individual donations and plasma pools for specific markers of infection, and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens.  
 The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as HIV, hepatitis  B virus, and hepatitis  C virus (HCV). The measures taken may be of limited 
value against nonenveloped viruses such as hepatitis  A virus and parvovirus B19.  
 There is reassuring clinical experience regarding the lack of hepatitis  A or 
parvovirus  B19 transmission with immunoglobulins and it is also assumed that the 
antibody content makes an important contribution to the viral safety  
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94033/2007 rev. 2, 2010 ). 
7 COURSE OF THE CLINICAL STUDY  
7.1 Visit Schedule  
Screening Visit  (Visit  1, Week  -4 to 0 , Day  -28 through Day  0) 
All subjects will attend a screening visit up to 4 weeks before the first BT595 infusion, 
where the following procedures will be performed:  
 
• W ritten informed consent /assent will be obtained. 
• Demographic data (including gender , date of birth [for calculation of age; 
note: age will be the age recorded at screening], ethnic origin, height, and body weight) will be recorded.

subject’s established replacement therapy (at least 6  months before study 
enrol lment) and data on blood- derived medication (i.e., administration of 
blood or blood products ; at least 3  months before study enrol lment). The type 
of previous medication, dose schedule, duration, and the indication the previous medication was given for will be documented. An x -ray may be 
performed at any time throughout the study  to evaluate new observations 
against baseline finding s, if medically indicated, and to confirm diagnostic 
criteria for acute serious bacterial infections. This is not applicable for Germany. (Note:  if the subject has recently had an x -ray taken [i .e., within

7.3 Criteria for Premature Termination  
7.3.1  Premature Termination of the Entire Clinical Study 
The clinical study  as a whole may be stopped by Biotest after consultation with the 
coordinating  investigator if there are reasons for which continuation of the clinical study  
is no longer justified, such as:  
a) Unacceptable delay of study  completion  
b) Low recruitm ent rate  
c) A large number of subject s with premature  termination  
d) Changed benefit -risk ratio according to the efficacy and/or safety results from this  or 
parallel studies  
e) Lack of efficacy  
f) Recently emerged information suggest that the study population can be offered a 
more advantageous study design 
 
For sites in Europe, in case of premature termination of the entire clinical study , the 
sponsor has to notify the appropriate Regulatory Authorities within 15  days.  
 For sites in the US, in case of premature termination of the entire clinical study, the investigator has to notify the appropriate Regulatory Authorities promptly.  
7.3.2  Premature Termination of an I ndividual Study Site 
The clinical study  may be stopped at an individual study site for reasons such as:  
a) Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subjects  
b) Low recruitment rate  
c) Lack of cooperation  
d) Severe deviations from study  protocol  
e) Manipulation of study  data 
f) Violation of other ethical or legal principles  
 The participation of subject s may be stopped following guidance from the DSMB 
(Section 9.4). The DSMB Charter will include a description of stopping rules for the 
participation of subjects . 
7.4 Treatment and Care a fter the End of the Study  
For subject s who have finished the clinical study  and for all subject s who drop out 
prematurely , it is the responsibility of the investigator to choose adequate therapeutic 
measurements.  
8 BENEFIT-RISK EVALUATION  
8.1 Benefit  
The principal benefit for the participating PID subject s will be to receive the required 
immunoglobulin replacement therapy and thereby the antiinfective effect of BT595 , 
Study No.: 991  Final Version 4.0 Clinical Study Protocol  
EudraCT No.: 2015 -003652 -52/ 
IND No.: 17046   21-MAR -2018  
 
SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 38  of 82  i.e. to prevent infections by substituting missing antibodies.  Moreover,  the participating 
PID subjects ’ quality of life  will improve  via the small er infusion volume and short er 
infusion duration feasible with BT595 (compared to a 5% IVIg) , which will allow 
subject s to potentially experience a shorter stay in hospital or other health care facility.  
 
Based on the extensive clinical experience with Intratect (50  g/L and 100 g/L) and the 
expected comparability of the safety profile between Intratect (100  g/L) and BT595, it is 
estimated that BT595 will show an acceptable safety profile even at the scheduled increased infusion rates.  
8.2 Foreseeable Risk and Discomfort Related to BT595  
Adverse Drug Reactions to be Expected w ith BT595 
The identified risks for BT595 have been derived from the well -established safety 
profile s of Bivigam (licensed in the United States) and Intratect (50  g/L and 100  g/L; 
licensed in the EU and international markets ); the EU-Core SmPC for IVIgs  
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94038/2007 rev.  4, 2012); and EMA  guidance 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94033/2007 rev. 2, 2010 ). 
 The following identified risks are considered to be expected ADRs for BT595 during the clinical study  program:  
 
• Thromboembolic events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis ; 
• Hypersensitivity reactions  (anaphy lactoid and anaphylactic, including 
anaphylactic shock, chills, headache, dizziness, fever, vomiting, allergic reactions, nausea, arthralgia, low blood pressure, and moderate low back pain; 
and transient cutaneous reactions);  
• Aseptic meningitis;  
• Hemolysis;  
• Acute renal failure, increased serum creatinine;  
• Leukopenia/neutropenia.  
 Foreseeable discomfort may result from blood samples taken from each subject during the course of the study for the assessment of exclusion criteria, laboratory parameters, viral sa fety (retention samples), immunoglobulin G trough levels, specific antibody 
trough levels, and PK parameters. The puncture of a vein and/or placement of indwelling catheters for blood withdrawal may cause pain and occasionally result in 
thrombosis or thrombophlebitis. Discomfort may also be caused by intravenous 
infusion of BT595.  
8.3 Other Sources of Possible Risk and Discomfort  
The following additional  possible risks for BT595 have also been derived from the 
well-established safety profiles of Intratect (50 g/L and 100 g/L; licensed in the EU and 
international markets) and Bivigam (licensed in the United States); the EU -Core SmPC 
for IVIgs ( EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94038/2007 rev.  4, 2012); and EMA guidance 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94033/2007 rev. 2, 2010 ). 
 
Study No.: 991  Final Version 4.0 Clinical Study Protocol  
EudraCT No.: 2015 -003652 -52/ 
IND No.: 17046   21-MAR -2018  
 
SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 39  of 82  The following possible risks are considered relevant, but unexpected, for BT595 during 
this clinical study  program:  
 
• Suspected transmission of pathogen infection (infective agents)  
• Interference of IVIg (interaction) with live- attenuated virus vaccines  
• Transfusion- related acute lung injury  (TRALI)  
• Interference with serological testing by passively -transferred antibodies of IVIg.  
 
To minimize the potential risk of transmission of infective agents, standard 
measures are established to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products  prepared from human blood or plasma. These include the selection of donors, 
screening of individual donations and plasma pools for specific markers of infection, and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma 
are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to unknown or emerging virus es and other pathogens.  
 
Interference (interaction) of IVIgs with live -attenuated virus vaccines:  
Immunoglobulin administration may impair, for a period of at least 6 weeks and up to 
3 months, the efficacy of live- attenuated virus vaccines (such as measles, rubella, 
mumps, and varicella). After administration of this medicinal product, an interval of 3 months should elapse before vaccination with live- attenuated virus vaccines. In the 
case of measles, this impairment may persist for up to 1 year. Therefore,  subjects 
receiving measles vaccine should have their antibody status checked. The foreign antibodies administered with IVIg could suppress a sufficient antibody induction by the live-attenuated virus vaccine in the subject.  
 Consequently, the above mentio ned live -attenuated virus vaccines must not be 
administered during the respective time period.  
 
Transfusion- related acute lung injury (TRALI)  is a very rare and serious blood 
transfusion complication characterized by the acute onset of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema following transfusion of blood products. Transfusion- related acute lung injury is 
typically associated with products from SINGLE donors, such as fresh frozen plasma, or of packed red blood cells due to the residual plasma present in the unit. Th e 
American Association of Blood Banks recommended on 03 NOV  2006  (in Association 
Bulletin #06- 07) that blood banks use high plasma volume components from female 
donors for further manufacturing instead of transfusion due to the higher risk of TRALI. In the  company’s opinion at present, no risk is seen for polyvalent immunoglobulins 
with manufacturing pool sized of more than 2000 donors. The reason for keeping it in 
this section is a class- label established in the United States.  
 
Regarding the interference with serological testing  by passively -transferred 
antibodies of IVIg, this risk can be considered in many cases as mild to moderate, and is spontaneously resolving.  
8.4 Summary of Possible Risk and Discomfort  
A single dose toxicity study is being performed in rats. The results are not yet available.  
 Of the possible risks associated with the administration of IVIgs in humans (Section 8.3), the risk of tra nsmission of infective agents is considered to be controlled 
Study No.: 991  Final Version 4.0 Clinical Study Protocol  
EudraCT No.: 2015 -003652 -52/ 
IND No.: 17046   21-MAR -2018  
 
SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 40  of 82  by the manufacturing process, which includes several process -steps for the removal of 
bacteria, viruses, and other infective agents  
 
The possible risk of interference (interaction) of IVIgs with live -attenuated virus 
vaccines will be prevented by the respective exclusion criterion ( Section  4.3). 
 At present, there is considered to be no risk of TRALI in subjects with PID who are on a 
long-term low dose treatment regimen if the IVIg is manufactured from a sufficiently 
sized donor pool.  
 The possible risk of interference with serological testing by passively transferred antibodies of IVIg, if relevant, will be assessed by virus serology control.  
 No clinical studies  in humans have previously been performed  with BT595. However, 
BT595 as a 10% IVIg is expected to have a comparable safety profile to Intratect 
(100 g/L) and Bivigam , where favorable benefit -risk profile s have  been established . In 
addition, the subjects eligible for  this study  will have been treated with an established 
replacement IVIg therapy for at least 6 months before inclusion in this study . So it is 
also predicted that similar ADRs will be observed under treatmen t with BT595 as  with 
their previously established IVIg replacement therapy before study  start.  
 This study  will assess infusion rates ranging from 0.3  mL/kg/h to 8  mL/kg/h for BT595. 
As this is the same infusion rate range that is  currently recommended for Intratect at 
100 g/L, it is expected that BT595 at infusion rates up to 8 mL/kg/h will result in similar 
ADR frequencies and severities of ADRs as those observed with Intratect at 100 g /L. It 
is well known that the risk of  hypersensitivity reactions, such as chills, headache, 
dizziness, fever, vomiting, allergic reactions, nausea, arthralgia, low blood pressure, 
back pain, and transient cutaneous reactions  increases with increased infusion rates  
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94033/2007 rev. 2, 201 2), and as such, these types of 
anaphylactoid ADRs are expected in this study . 
 No change of  the risk profile under treatment  with BT595 is expected for subject s 
already being treated with other approved 10% polyvalent immunoglobulins at higher 
infusion rates. The occurrence of AEs which interfere significantly with the subject s’ 
physical wellbeing or social activity during or after the testing period is not expected; however, cannot be excluded as a possibility.  
 The frequency, type, and severity of ADRs in the pediatric population are expected to 
be the same as in adults . A DSMB will be used to review the safety data of at least 
10 adult subjects (18-75 years , inclusive ) who have received at least 2 infusion s with 
no safety concerns ( Section  9.4), and will provide recommendations on the suitability of 
the enrollment of pediatric subject s into the study . 
 Although risks in general cannot be excluded entirely, the potential to occur can be minimized by the careful selection of subject s and by their close surveillance by 
experienced investigators who recognize safety issues early by carefully surveying warning signs and taking appropr iate corrective  action in case of AEs . 
 The potential risks and discomfort to the individual subject  are reasonably balanced by 
the relevance of the study . Under the conditions of the study  as described in the

9 ASSESSMENT OF OBJECT IVES/ CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION 
9.1 Efficacy  
9.1.1  Specification of Efficacy Parameters  
9.1.1.1  Primary Efficacy  
The primary efficacy parameter is determined from the rate of acute serious bacterial 
infections  per subject -year. 
 
Data will be compared to historical data from previous PID studies with Intratect and 
Bivigam, as well as to  available data from literature.  
9.1.1.2  Secondary Efficacy  
Secondary efficacy will be determined using the following:  
• Immunoglobulin G t rough levels (total IgG) before each infusion 
• Infections (serious and nonserious, time to resolution of infections, antibiotic 
treatment for infections, and days lost from school/work due to infections and 
their treatment)  
• Hospitalization  
• Fever episodes  
• Health -related quality -of-life 
9.1.2  Methods for Assessing and Recording Efficacy Parameters  
9.1.2.1  Primary Efficacy Parameter  
The number and type of acute serious bacterial infections will be determined through 
review of data collected on infections. Infections will be reported as AEs which will be obtained by the investigator through observation of the subject (including examinations and investigations), from any information volunteered by the subject, and through active questioning . Subject  diaries will be reviewed to check for instances where the 
AE occurs and the subject  is not on a site visit. Subject s will receive instructio ns from 
the investigator on how to record this information in their subject  diary (paper) in ‘real 
time’ from the time they leave their current site visit until the next site visit, what steps to take if an AE occurs, and the action to be taken if an infection is suspected. If a subject  suspects they have an infection between visits, the subjec t must inform the 
investigator as soon as possible. If the investigator confirms/suspects the subject  has 
an infection, the subject must attend the site to be examined by the investigator. 
Subject s will be instructed to bring their subject  diary to each study visit. During each 
scheduled visit, subject s will be asked about AEs occurring since their last visit and 
subject  diaries will be collected and reviewed for any signs of AEs (infections) 
occurring between visits  before IMP administration. Specific diagnostic criteria, as 
recommended by the FDA guidance ( Appendix  3), will be used by the investigator to 
define each type of serious infection included in the primary efficacy analysis.

EudraCT No.: 2015 -003652 -52/ 
IND No.: 17046   21-MAR -2018  
 
SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 42  of 82  Acute serious bacterial infections will include:  
 
• Bacteremia or sepsis  
• Bacterial meningitis  
• Osteomyelitis/septic arthritis  
• Bacterial pneumonia  
• Visceral abscess  
 Essential diagnostic features are defined in the diagnostic criteria for acute serious bacterial infections recommended by the FDA guidance ( Appendix  3). The infections 
must be documented by objective findings. If possible, blood for measurement of acute phase reactants should be obtained, but this is not an absolute requirement. If imaging procedures (i .e., x- rays) are taken to confirm diagnostic criter ia for acute serious 
bacterial infections,  data will be recorded in the e CRF.  
 The investigator will confirm t he date of onset of an episode of acute serious bacterial 
infection and record this in the eCRF . 
 Details of all AEs defined as acute serious bacterial infections will be recorded in the subject’s e CRF.  
9.1.2.2  Secondary Efficacy Parameters  
Immunoglobulin G Trough Levels  (Total IgG ) 
Blood samples ( approximately 7.5 mL) for the assessment of total  IgG trough levels will 
be taken at the time points  detail ed in Section III, Flowchart of Study . Note: the 
approximate blood sample volumes are estimated, and as the samples will be tested by local laboratories, may differ from the approximate blood volumes detailed.  
 Before each infusion of  BT595 , blood samples will be taken for the assessment of 
total IgG trough levels. Samples will be analyzed at the local  laboratory using standard 
assay methods.  During the treatment period, the subject’s total IgG trough level res ult 
from the previous infusion will be made available to the investigator  before the next 
infusion of BT595. This is to allow dose adjustments to be made if the subject’s trough 
level fell below the specified level of 5  g/L. 
 
Infections and Infection -Related Events  
All infections and episodes of fever will be reviewed and recorded as described in 
Section  9.1.2.1. 
 Infection s (serious and nonserious) will be assigned using  the most current version of 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA
®) and using the coding levels 
of system organ class and preferred term. The investigator will confirm the date of 
onset of infection and record this in the e CRF. The time to resolution of infection will be 
recorded by the subject in the subject diary and verified by the investigator.  
 For each episode of infection, the subject  must be examined by his/her inves tigator 
before initiation of antibiotic therapy.  A record of antibiotic treatments will be reported in 
the subject ’s diary. If a subject ’s antibiotic treatment includes antipyretic treatment, the 
subject  must also have their  body temperature (before the antipyretic is taken) 
recorded in the subject diary.

SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 43  of 82  A record of the number of days a subject  is not able to attend school  or work due to the 
infection and the treatment of the infection will be reported in the subject ’s diary. A 
record of any admission to hospital and the number of days in hospital will also be 
reported in the subject  diaries. This record will include the hospitali zation type 
(i.e., hospital admission or emergency room), the dates of the visit/admission, and the  
reason for the visit/admission.  
 Fever is defined as a body temperature ≥ 38°C ( ≥100.4°F). Fever which recurs after 
≥3 days without fever will be counted as a new fever episode. The number of days of 
fever for a given fever episode is defined as the number  of days from the first day of a 
body temperature ≥ 38°C ( ≥100.4°F) to the last day with a body temperature ≥ 38°C 
(≥100.4°F).  
 Details of all AEs defined as infections or episodes of fever will be recorded in the 
subject’s e CRF.  
 
Health -Related Quality -of-Life 
The subject s’ health- related quality -of-life will be assessed using 2 subject 
questionnaires (Peds  QL™ [PedsQL™  Measurement Model ] and EQ -5D™ [EuroQol  
Five Dimension Health Questionnaire, 2015]) collected as patient reported outcomes 
(PRO s) while the subject  attends the investigator site for a visit. For pediatric subject s, 
the PRO s may be completed by proxy (i .e., by the subject s’ parent [s] or legal ly 
acceptable representative).  
 All pediatric subjects (2- 17 years , inclusive ) will complete the 23- Item Pediatric Quality 
of Life (Peds  QL™) Measurement Model (Version 4.0). The Peds  QL™ Measurement 
Model consists of developmentally appropriate forms for children aged 2 through 
4 years, 5 through 7 years, 8 through 12 years, and 13 through 18 years, and must 
include both child self -reports and parent proxy -reports , with the exception of children 
aged 2 through 4 years where only the parent proxy -report is required. The 
developmentally appropriate form will be selected based on the subject ’s age recorded 
at screening (initial visit). The same age will be used per subject during the entire study  
and the same developmentally appropriate form will be used per subject  during the 
entire study , even if the subject ’s age indicates a change in form is required (i .e., if a 
subject ’s age changes from 7 to 8 years during the study , they must complete the form 
for children aged 5 through 7 years during the entire study ). The person completing the 
parent proxy -report should be constant for the duration of the subject ’s study  
participation. The Peds  QL™ Core Scales encompass the essential core domains for 
pediatric health- related quality -of-life measurement: physical functioning (8 items), 
emotional functioning (5 items), soci al functioning (5 items), and school functioning 
(5 items). In each domain, the person completing the form will be provided with a list of 
things which might be a problem for the subject and asked to respond with ‘how much 
of a problem’ each one is (i .e., 0 if it is never a problem, 1  if it is almost never a 
problem, 2 if it is sometimes a problem, 3 if it is often a problem, and 4  if it is almost 
always a problem).  
 All adult subjects will rate their quality of life by self -completing the EQ -5D™ Health 
Questionnaire (Version 1.0). The EQ -5D™ essentially consists of 2 pages: the 
EQ-5D™ descriptive system page and the EQ  visual analog scale (EQ  VAS) page. The 
EQ-5D™ descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self -care, 
usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each EQ -5D™ dimension has

SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 44  of 82  3 levels (EQ -5D-3L™): no problems, some problems, extreme problems. The EQ -5D™ 
EQ VAS records the respondent’s self -rated health on a vertical, visual analog scale 
where the endpoints are labelled ‘Best imaginable health state’ and ‘Worst imaginable 
health state’.  
 In addition to the Peds  QL™ Measurement Model, p ediatric subjects (4-17 years , 
inclusive ) will rate their quality of life by completing the youth version of the EQ -5D™  
(EQ-5D-Y™; child self -report or proxy -report ). The EQ -5D-Y™ consists of the same 
2 pages: the EQ -5D-Y™ descriptive system page and the EQ  VAS page. The 
descriptive system comprises the same dimensions as the EQ -5D-3L™, but using 
child-friendly wording (mobility; looking after myself; doing usual activities; having pain 
or discomfort; and feeling worried, sad, or unhappy) and has 3 levels: no problems, 
some problems, and a lot of problems. The EQ  VAS endpoints are labelled ‘The best 
health you can imagine’ and ‘The worst health you can imagine’. A proxy version of the form will be used for children aged 4 through 7 years. All other pediatric subject s 
(8-17 years , inclusive) will self -complete the EQ -5D-Y™.

9.2.1  Specification of Safety Parameters  
Safety and tolerability in this clinical study will be addressed by the following safety parameters: AEs, laboratory parameters (routine and intravascular hemolysis ), vital 
signs, and physical examination.  
 For the timing of individual safety parameters refer to Section III, Flowchart of Study . 
Any abnormal observation or finding detected during the screening procedures after subject's  informed consent /assent that is considered clinically relevant must be 
docume nted as concomitant disease (ongoing medical history)  or as past medical 
history . All medications other than the study medications should also be documented.

SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 45  of 82  9.2.1.1  Adverse Events  
Adverse event  data are obtained by the investigator through observation of the subj ect 
(including examinations and investigations), from any information volunteered by the 
subject, and through active questioning.  At each visit after informed consent /assent  
has been signed, subjects will be asked about AEs  that occurred since the last vis it, by 
questioning them with regard to their well -being by ‘nonleading’ questions.  This 
includes AEs occurring during the administration of the study medication, as well as changes in concomitant diseases (i .e., ongoing medical history).  The subject ’s diary 
(paper) is a source of collection of AE data that will be transcribed to the e CRF. 
Subject  diaries will be reviewed for any signs of AEs occurring between visits.   
 Occurrence, frequency, nature, severity , causality, and seriousness  of AEs will be 
recorded. This includes observations or abnormalities in physical examination, vital 
signs, laboratory , or other investigations reported as AEs. Any treatments for AEs will 
also be recorded.  For further details regarding AEs including definitions and reporti ng 
procedures refer to Appendix  1 and Appendix  2. 
9.2.1.2  Physical Examination  
For each subject, a complete physical examination will be performed at the time points specified in S ection  III, Flowchart of Study . Physical examination includes inspection of 
general appearance, skin, neck (including thyroid) , eyes, ears, nose, throat, heart, 
lungs, abdomen, lymph nodes, vascular system, extremities , musculo- skeletal system , 
and nervous system.  Clinical findings and existing diseases at screening are to be 
documented as medical history.  A new appearance of an abnormal finding or 
worsening of a concomitant disease that is considered clinically significant and occurs after signature of informed consent /assent must be documented as an AE. 
 
• Body weight is measured in kilograms (kg).  
• Body height is measured in cm once at the screening visit for the purpose of calculation of body mass index . 
 The physical examination will be followed- up with a verbal exchange (face- to-face) 
between the subject and the investigator 1 hour after the end of each infusion, and a 
verbal exchange (by telephone) 24 and 72  hours after the end of each infusion. At 
each exchange, the  subject will report any changes since the physical examination 
performed before the BT595 infusion. Any new physical examination finding will be documented as an AE.  
9.2.1.3  Vital Signs 
Vital signs are measured with the following methods/units:  
 
• Blood pressure i s measured in mmHg according to the Riva Rocci method while 
the subject has been resting in supine position for at least 15  minutes. The 
same arm should be used for blood pressure measurements throughout the study. The size of the cuff has to be chosen appropriately in relation to the subject’s arm circumference.  
• Pulse  rate is measured in beats per minute either electronically and/ or by 
palpation for 1 minute while the subject is supine and has been resting for at 
least 15  minutes. When pulse rate is of concern, cardiac monitors are used to 
determine not only rate, but also rhythm.

SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 46  of 82  • Respiratory rate is measured in breaths per minute while the subject has been 
resting for at least 15 minutes . 
• Body temper ature is measured in degrees Centigrade or Fahrenheit using axillar 
measurements.  
 
Measurements outside the normal range (according to the age and gender of the subject ) or even values within the normal range showing a trend have to be assessed 
for clinical relevance by the investigator, and reported as AE s if considered to 
represent a clinically significant change as compared to screening  values.  
9.2.1.4  Laboratory Parameters  
Routine Laboratory Parameters  
All routine laboratory results have to be evaluated in the eCRF (by the investigator) 
according to the following pattern:  
a) Within reference range (normal range)  
b) Outside reference range but not clinically relevant (e .g., marginal deviation only, 
due to underlying diseases in the study population) 
c) Outside reference range and clinically relevant  
Laboratory values occurring  (by date of blood sampling) after signature of informed 
consent/assent , which are outside the reference range and assessed as clinically 
relevant (as determined by investigator), have to be documented as AE s. 
An abnormal laboratory value that is a sign of an AE (e.g., increased leukocytes due to 
bacterial infection) that has already been reported during the present clinical study , has 
to be stated but the respective abnormal laboratory value (e.g., increased leukocytes) 
does not constitute a separate AE.  
For the routine laboratory parameters, the total volume of blood that will be drawn from a subject per visit will be  approximately 13.5 mL. 
The laboratory safety parameters to be assessed are summarized in Table 1.

Note: the approximate blood sample volumes are estimated, and as the samples will be tested by local laboratories, volumes may differ from the approximate blood 
volumes detailed.  
 In addition, the following specific safety laboratory parameters will be assessed at the time points specified in S ection  III, Flowchart of Study: 
Intravascular Hemolysis  
The intravascular hemolysis tests will be performed at screening (initial visit) and the closing (follow -up) visit only, unless further tests are required.  Tests for the detection of 
intravascular hemolysis will consist of a direct antiglobulin test (Coombs’ test; approximately 7 mL blood sample) and the measurement of serum haptoglobin, 
plasma- free hemoglobin, and urine hemosiderin. If the Coombs’ test result i s positive, 
the test will be repeated and red blood cell count, hematocrit, hemoglobin, serum haptoglobin, bilirubin (total, direct, and indirect), lactate dehydrogenase, and urine hemosiderin tests will be performed within 2 to 5 days. If the hemoglobin level has 
dropped by ≥ 2.0 g/dL from the screening level, in conjunction with both a drop in serum 
haptoglobin to below the lower limit of normal and a rise in serum lactate dehydrogenase from the screening level, this will suggest intravascular hemolysis, and a repeat urine dipstick, micro- urinalysis, and assessment of hemoglobin levels will be 
obtained within 72 hours of being informed of the drop in hemoglobin levels.  
 For the first 10 patients and their  first 2 infusions (V2 and V3) the results of the dire ct 
antiglobulin test (Coombs test) and the test of serum haptoglobin at the time points V3 and V4 are  required as a prerequisite for the decision of the Data and Safety 
Monitoring Board. F or those 10 patients approximately 7 mL of additional blood will be 
taken  for each of the two visits  (V3 + V4) . 
 Note: the approximate blood sample volumes are estimated, and as the samples will be tested by local laboratories, volumes may differ from the approximate blood 
volumes detailed.

SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 48  of 82  Virus Serology  
The immunological  status of viral infections will be assessed at screening (initial visit) 
for: 
 
• HIV (anti -HIV1 and anti -HIV2)  
• hepatitis  B (total hepatitis  B core antibody [ anti-HBc], hepatitis  B surface 
antibody [anti-HBs], hepatitis  B surface antigen [ HBsAg ]) 
• hepatitis  C (anti-HCV ) 
 
Pregnancy Test  
In females of child- bearing potential (i .e., female subjects ≥12 years or with presence 
of menstruation at screening), a pregnancy human chorionic gonadotropin test in 
serum will be performed at screening (initial visit). Urine pregnancy dipstick tests will be performed at other time points in the clinical study as specified in S ection III, Flowchart 
of Study. 
 The serum sample will be analyzed by the local laboratory using standard assay methods and the urine dipstick test will be analyzed at the stud y site. 
9.2.1.5  Viral Safety ( Retention Samples ) 
In order to respond rapidly to any reports on additional viral infections, a screening  
blood sample (5 mL ) from each subject included in the study must be taken at the start 
of the study  (screening [initial visit ]) and stored at - 70°C for possible future serum 
testing.  
 At the closing (follow -up) visit, an additional blood sample (5 mL ) must be taken and 
stored up to 6 months after study end . 
9.2.2  Methods for Assessing and Recording Safety Parameters  
The following safet y parameters are recorded in the eCRF:  AEs ( Section 9.3 for further 
details), physical examination findings, laboratory values (routine and intravascular hemolysis), virus serology, and vital signs.  
 All laboratory analyses will be performed by the local laboratory using standard assay 
methods and will be transcribed to the e CRF by the investigator in a timely manner.  
9.2.3  Safety Endpoints  
For each subject and for the study as a whole:  
• Number , severity, causality, and seriousness  of infusional AEs ( including 
nonproduct related) temporally associated with the infusion (occurring during 
infusion or within 1, 24, and 72  hours after the end of infusion)  
• Number of related infusional AEs  (occurring during infusion or within 1, 24, and 
72 hours after the end of infusion) 
• Number and percentage of infusions temporally (within 72 hours) associated 
with 1  or more AEs  
• Number, severity, causality, and seriousness of all AEs  
• Number, severity, causality, and seriousness of all treatment -emergent AEs  
(TEAEs)  
• Number  of noninfusional  AEs (occurring more than 72  hours after the end of 
infusion)

SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 49  of 82  • Changes in safety laboratory parameters  (outside reference range and clinically 
relevant)  
• Number of positive intravascular hemolysis test results  
• Changes in vital sign parameter s 
• Changes in physical examination parameters  
 
For AEs that occur during an infusion, the  following  should be reported and analyzed: 
(1) the infusion rate in effect at the time of onset of the AE; (2)  the time of onset of the 
AE; and (3)  the time at which t he AE change d materially in intensity and/or resolved . 
Listings of SAEs ; AEs by severity; AEs by body system ; and a determination of which 
AEs were product -related, and which were not, will be provided.  
 The mean number of AEs temporally associated with infusions per infusion will be 
calculated by (a)/(b) where: (a)  equals the total number of AEs that occur during or 
within 72 hours of an infusion, and (b)  equals the total number of infusions.  
 The proportion of infusions administered to subjects for which “infusional” AEs have been reported will be provided.  
 The proportion of subjects who experience 1 or more AEs at any time during the 
course of the study  will be provided.  
 For each AE, it will  be indicated which infusion of investigational product this occurred 
with or followed (i .e., 1st infusion, 2nd infusion, etc). The AE listings will include 
separate reports of all AEs and of AEs judged by investigators to be associated with the infusion of the product, even if the sponsor determines the AE not to be product -related.  
 Where appropriate, analyses of AEs should take into account the observed intra-subject correlation of the same type or any type of AE, as such within- subject 
events may not be independent. Methodology for these analyses will  be described in 
the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) . 
9.3 Adverse Events 
9.3.1  Definitions  (also refer to Appendix  1) 
• Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  or clinical study  subject 
administered an investigational medicinal product ( IMP) and which does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE  may be any 
aggravation or new unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal 
laboratory findings), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP, whether or not considered related to the IMP . 
Adverse Reaction (ADR) of an I nvestigational Medicinal Product:  
All untoward and unintended responses to an IMP  related to any dose 
administered. All AEs judged by either the reporting investigator or the sponsor 
as having a reasonable causal relationship to a medicinal product qualify as ADRs (= related AEs) . The expression reasonable causal relationship means to 
convey in general that there is evidence or argument to suggest a causal

is foreseen in the protocol, including misuse and abuse of the IMP  
(Section 9.3.6 ). 
• Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose*:  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening  
• requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• results in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• is another important medical event  
* “At any dose” does not necessarily imply that the subject is receiving the study drug at the time 
of the event.  
Reporting requirements are detailed in Appendix  2. 
• Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI)  
An AESI (serious or nonserious) is one of scientific and medical concern specific 
to the sponsor’s IMP  or development program, for which ongoing monitoring and 
immediate communication by the investigator to the sponsor may be 
appropriate. Such events may require further investigation in order to 
characterize and understand them. Reporting requirements are detailed in Appendix  2. 
The following AEs have been defined as AESI s for thi s study:  
• Thromboembolic events (such as stroke, myocardial infarction, lung embolism)  
• Hemolysis  
• Immediately Reportable Adverse Event (IRAE)  
An AE that must be reported to the sponsor within 24  hours  of the study site 
being aware of the AE. Reporting requirements are detailed in Appendix  2. 
For this clinical study, IRAEs include : 
• A ll SAEs  
• A ll AESIs  
• A ll AEs that result in a subject’s withdrawal from the study  
• O verdose 
• P regnancy  
• Adverse Events Leading to Subject’s Withdrawal from the Clinical Study  
An AE, serious or nonserious, resulting in a subject’s withdrawal from the clinical 
study, i .e. permanent treatment discontinuation. Reporting requirements by the 
investigator are detailed in Appendix  2. 
Mandatory Adverse Event Stopping Rules  
Subject s have to be withdrawn if any of the following AEs occur:

SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 51  of 82  9.3.2  Recording Adverse Events  
All AEs, serious and nonserious, that occur during the period of observation defined for 
the clinical study ( Section III, Flowchart of S tudy) have to be fully documented in the 
eCRF according to the provisions  given in this sect ion of the study protocol and CRF 
completion guidelines, as well as in the subject’s source data. This applies also to AEs 
in subject s who signed the informed consent /assent  but never received the study drug.  
In addition, for a subset of AEs (SAE s, AESI s, AE s leading to withdrawal, overdose, 
and pregnancy ), immediate reporting from the investigator to sponsor is required 
(IRAE s). This is further detailed in Appendix  2. The following information is necessary:  
• Diagnosis vs. Signs/Symptoms  
The investigator should provide a diagnosis rather than individual signs and symptoms, wherever possible and appropriate. However, if there is not enough 
information to provide a diagnosis, individual signs and symptoms are to be recorded. If a diagnosis is accompanied by unusual symptoms, the diagnosis itself and the unusual symptoms have to be reported separately. For SAEs  and 
other IRAE s, the investigator shall provide any other supporting information that 
may be required for the assessment of the events.  
A complication of an AE constitutes another AE. For example , in diarrhea 
leading to dehydration, diarrhea and dehydration would be captured as separate AEs.  
The eCRF provides for a number of items to be completed for each AE. This 
includes the onset date; end date; intensity/severity ; seriousness ; action taken 
with study medication; treatment for the AE ; outcome ; and causal relationship of 
the AE with the study medication, other drugs, or study procedures (Appendix  1). 
Severe vs. Serious:  The severity is used to describe the intensity of an event. 
This is not the same as seriousness, which is based on subject /event outcome 
or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to subjec t’s 
life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as the guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
• Causal Relationship of the Adverse Event  
The causal relationship with the study medication has to be reported for each AE. It refers to the presence or absence of a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the study medication and the AE . 
The investigator is asked to use medical judgment and take into account the nature of the AE ; the subject’s medical history ; temporal relation; response to 
withdrawal or interruption of study drug (dechallenge) ; response to 
reintroduction of study drug (rechallenge) ; and any alternative explanations such 
as underlying or concomitant diseases, concomitant drugs, or study procedures.  
 The following categories are used:  
• Related: There is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the study medication and the AE.  
• Not related: There is no reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
between the study medication and the AE.

IND No.: 17046   21-MAR -2018  
 
SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 52  of 82  For SAEs  and other IR AEs, the investigator is asked to specify if there are 
alternative and/or additional explanations for the occurrence of the event 
(e.g., concomita nt drugs, study procedures, or concomitant/underlying disease) 
and should provide this information already with the initial case report.  
9.3.3  Period of Observation  
The period of observation for collection of AE s extends from the time the subject signs 
the informed consent /assent  form until the last study visit  (closing [follow -up] visit) , 
which is scheduled 3 or 4 weeks after the last dose of study medication (depending on 
the subject’s treatment schedule) . 
Abnormal, clinically relevant findings or observat ions made prior to signature of 
informed consent /assent are to be recorded as medical history/concomitant disease , 
but not as AEs. 
Adve rse events occurring in the pretreatment period between signature of informed 
consent/assent  until first administrat ion o f study medication are nontreatment emergent 
AEs.  
Adverse events occurring from the first administration of study medication until the subject’s last study visit are TEAEs.  
If an SAE occurs in a subject after the period of observation, i .e., after the last  study 
visit, which is considered by the investigator to be related to the study medication, this should be recorded as an SAE and should follow the immediate reporting process for 
SAEs as described in Appendix  2. If the eCRF has been closed for the subject, the 
investigator should contact the sponsor to determine how to report the SAE.  
9.3.4  Assessment of Adverse Events  
• Responsibilities of Investigator  
Adver se events are assessed by the investigator in a standardized manner 
including, but not limited to seriousness, severity, outcome, and causality. This 
has to be performed in line with the definitions and provisions given in Appendix  1. 
Laboratory values outside the reference range have to be assessed for clinical relevance taking into account the pretreatment values. For reporting of abnormal laboratory values as AEs, refer to Section  9.2.1.4 . 
If an AE meets the definition of any of the mandatory AE related stopping rules (Section 9.3.1 ), the investigator must withdraw the subject and report the AE as 
an IRAE according to Appendix  2. 
For all AEs , the causality assessm ent has to be provided in the eCRF, even if 
based on preliminary data. Once more information is available, the investigator may change a preliminary causality assessment.  
During and after participation of a subject in a clinical study , the 
investigator/institution has to ensure that adequate medical care is provided to the subject for any ongoing AEs, including clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory values. The investigator has to inform the subject when medical care is needed for any intercurrent disease of which the investigator becomes aware.

IND No.: 17046   21-MAR -2018  
 
SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 53  of 82  • Responsibilities of Sponsor  
Adverse events are reviewed and assessed by the sponsor during ongoing 
safety monitoring activities throughout the study, as well as medical evaluation and regulatory assessment for reportability of SAEs and IRAEs. For the purpose of regulatory reporting, the causality assessment given by the investigator will not been downgraded by the sponsor. If the sponsor disagrees with the investigator’s causality assessment, both the opinion of the investigator and the sponsor will be recorded.  
Regulatory assessment of an AE by the sponsor comprises the assessment of expectedness, which is based on Section  7 of the I nvestigator’s Brochure  for 
BT595 . 
• Follow -up of Adverse Events  
Adverse events should be followed up to determine the outcome.  
Adverse events  that are serious or severe or considered related to the study 
medication or st udy procedures must be followed- up by the investigator until the 
AE is resolved or resolved with sequelae, and until all queries related to the AE have been clarified. If the subject had an AE with fatal outcome, an autopsy report should be provided, if possible.  
If AEs that are serious or severe or considered related to study medication or study procedures are ongoing at the time of the subject’s last study visit, or if the subject has clinically relevant laboratory parameter abnormalities at the last study visit, one or more safety follow -up visit should be scheduled for those 
subjects. The investigator should set the interval to the additional Safety follow -up visit according to his/her medical judgment . Follow -up activities should 
be continued until the investigator considers it medically justifiable to stop further follow -up. 
All other AEs must be followed up by the investigator until the AE is resolved or resolved with sequelae or the end of the period of observation ( i.e., last study 
visit), whichever comes first.  
The investigator should respond to any queries raised by the sponsor in relation to AEs, including provision of supporting documentation for SAEs or other 
IRAEs (e .g., electrocardiogram [ ECG ] data, laboratory results, hospital 
summary, autopsy report) within the requested timeline. In case of fatal or life-threatening SAEs , the sponsor may request urgent clarification within 
1 calendar  day. In general, if for AEs requiring immediate reporting from the 
investigator to sponsor (IRAE s/SAEs), follow -up information becomes available, 
this must be reported to the sponsor within 24  hours  of becoming aware of this 
information (i .e., the same timeframe as for initial IRAE/SAE reports). Any 
supporting documents have to be identified by the subject identificati on, and 
personal data (e.g., subject name, address , or phone number) obliterated pr ior 
to sending to the sponsor. For details on reporting IRAE s/SAEs, see 
Appendix  2. 
Adverse event data in the e CRF must be updated accordingly when follow -up 
information is received.  
All efforts to collect follow -up information must be documented in the subject’s 
source data.

SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 54  of 82  Subjects who were treated with the study medication but did not complete the 
study as per protocol, should receive all the examinations and investigations scheduled for the last study visit. The investigator should make all efforts to contact subjects lost to follow -up and document the attempts in the subject’s 
source data.  
9.3.5  Immediate Reporting by Investigator to Sponsor  
The reporting processes are outlined in detail in Appendix  2. 
9.3.6  Use of I nvestigational Medicinal Product  Outside the S pecifications of the 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Situations may occur where the IMP is used outside the specifications of the protocol, which may or may not be associated with an AE. These special situations comprise: 
• Medication errors (including overdose)  
• Abuse/misuse of the IMP  
Such situations, whether  or not associated with an AE, are documented in the e CRF 
on dedicated pages. Any AE that occurred in association with such a special situation has to be cros s-referenced on the dedicated e CRF page. An IRAE/SAE occurring in 
conjunction with a medication error or abuse/misuse of the IMP has to follow the immediate reporting process for IRAE/SAE as described in Appendix  2 in additio n to its 
documentation in t he eCRF (also refer to Sections 9.3.1 , 9.3.8 , and 10.2). 
9.3.7  Investigational Medicinal Product Complaints  
Investigational medicinal product complaints must be recorded in the e CRF and in 
addition reported to the sponsor on the “Investigational Medicinal Product Complaint Report Form” within 24  hours  of the investigator becoming aware of the IMP 
complaint. If the IMP complaint is associated with an AE, the AE mus t be entered in t he 
eCRF also.  
Any complaint samples should be provided to the sponsor upon request.  
9.3.8  Special Situations Requiring Immediate Reporting 
Special situations may occur that may or may not be associated with AEs. For these situations , special reporting provisions  apply.  
Special situations comprise:  
• Pregnancy in a female study subject or the partner of a male study subject  
• Investigational medicinal product complaint  
• Use of IMP outside the specifications of the C linical Study Protocol  
(e.g., m edication errors, overdose, misuse and abuse ; also refer to S ection  9.3.6  
and Section  10.2) 
• Protocol deviations  (refer to S ection  10.2) 
If such a situation occurs, the investigator should contact the sponsor immediately. A special paper report form has to always  be completed in these situations and sent to 
the sponsor immediately, but not later than 24  hours  after the investigator b ecoming 
aware of the situation.

SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 55  of 82  9.3.8.1  Pregnancy  
Pregnant women are excluded from the study, and female study subjects of 
child-bearing potential (≥12  years or presence of menstruation at screening) undergo 
pregnancy testing at screening and regularly during the study ( Section III, Flowchart of 
Study). If pregnancy is suspected in a study subject during treatment with the IMP, the 
IMP must be immediately withheld until the result of a confirmatory test is available. If confirmed, the subject must be withdrawn from the study. Furthermore, the reason and the contraception methods may need to be reviewed and documented as a preventative measure for other participants.  
Although not an AE per se, pregnancy in a female study subject or the partner of a 
male study subject must be recorded if it occurs during the period of observation of the study (see definition in Section 9.3.3). The investigator must contact the sponsor 
immediately in such a situation. 
The pregnancy must be documented on a “Drug Exposure Via Parent Report Form”  
(DEVP Form ) and reported to the sponsor within 24  hours  of the investigator 
becoming aware of the pregnancy. If an AE occurs in relation to the pregnancy, it has to be noted on the DEVP Form and recorded in the e CRF. If an IRAE/SAE occurs in 
relation to the pregnancy, it has to be noted on the DEVP Form and rec orded in the 
eCRF and follow the immediate reporting process for IRAE/SAE as described in 
Appendix  2. 
The investigator must make all reasonable efforts to follow up the pregnancy until its 
end and will report all outcomes associated with the pregnancy to the sponsor. In the situation of pregnancy of the female partner of a male study subject, consent for the release of medical data should be obtained from the female partner to allow collection of information on the outcome of the pregnancy.  
9.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
To monitor the safety data from adult subjects and provide advice and 
recommendations on the enrol lment of pediatric subjects, a DSMB consisting of 
independent experts will be convened. The DSMB will review the safety data of at least 10 adult subjects (18-75 years , inclusive ) who have received at least 2 BT595 infusions  
with no safety concerns  and provide recommendations on the suitability of the 
enrollment of  pediatric ( 2-17 years , inclusive ) subjects  into the study . In addition to the 
laboratory values already described and as a requirement from the DSMB the direct antiglobulin test (Coombs' test) and the test for serum haptog lobin for these  10 adult  
patients and the ir first two visits have to be performed on V3 and V4. The final decision 
to enroll/not enroll pediatric subjects will be the responsibility of the sponsor.  
 The specific responsibilities and composition of the DSMB  are outlined in a separate 
document, the DSMB Charter , which will include a description of stopping rules for the 
participation of subjects. The DSMB Charter will  also include details on the frequency 
of DSMB meetings and details of the information to be provided for the DSMB review.

SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 56  of 82  total IgG, IgG subclasses 1 -4, and IgG  specific antibody levels (anti -pneumococcal 
capsular polysaccharide, anti-hemophilus influenzae type B, anti-measles, anti-tetanus, 
anti-cytomegalovirus, and anti -HBs/ hepatitis  B) will be obtained from at least 20  adult 
subjects (18-75 years , inclusive ) and from pediatric subjects (6-17 years , inclusive ). 
Note: samples for IgG  specific antibody levels will be taken from pediatric subjects 
aged 12  through 17  years only.  
 
Sufficient samples will be obtained to reconstruct a concentration- time curve and to 
derive key PK parameters for total  IgG, IgG subclasses 1 -4, and IgG  specific antibody 
levels . The samples will be taken as 1  aliquot for all analytes . 
 
Unused PK  serum samples may be used to measure additional specific antibody 
levels /immunological variables  of medical relevance as optional analytical variable s 
which may be of importance with regard to efficacy of an IVIg in PID.  
 
For pediatric subjects (2-5 years, inclusive), sparse sampling at flexible time points 
within specified time windows after the end of the infusion may be performed (note: 
these samples are optional; see Section  7.1). For pediatric subject s (2-5 years, 
inclusive), only total  IgG kinetics at steady -state will be established; no samples for 
IgG trough levels of subclasses 1- 4 and IgG trough levels of specific antibody levels 
will be taken.  
9.5.2  Methods for Assessing and Recording Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
Blood samples will be collected by health care professionals, with procedures adapted for each age category (i .e., pediatric tubes and plasma micro- sampling). A homecare 
service is allowed for the PK sampling of pediatric subjects (2- 17 years, i nclusive). 
Blood sampling will be performed with a very thin gauge needle to reduce discomfort as much as possible. Blood collection immediately and up to 6  hours after the infusion 
must not be performed from the subject’s arm to which the infusion of study medication 
was administered; instead the contralateral  arm must be used. 
 Blood samples will be taken at estimated steady -state after the 7 th infusion of the 
3-week schedule or after the 5th  infusion of the 4 -week schedule. Subjects will 
complete serial blood sampling according to their age category; therefore, the number of blood draws will depend on the subject’s age category. For adult subjects (18-75 years, inclusive) and pediatric subjects (6- 17 years, inclusive), samples will be 
taken at a fixed ser ies of time  points. For pediatric patients (2-5 years, inclusive), 
sparse sampling at flexible time points within specified time windows after the end of 
this infusion may be performed (note: these samples are optional).  
 The samples will be taken at the t ime points  detailed in Section  III, Flowchart of Study, 
and Section  7.1. 
 In total, 8  or 9 PK blood samples will be t aken from adult subjects (18- 75 years, 
inclusive) and pediatric subjects (6- 17 years, inclusive) over a period of 3 or 4 weeks 
(according to the treatment schedule). The samples will be taken as 1 aliquot for all 
analytes. For pediatric subjects (2-5 years ), up to 5 PK blood samples may be taken 
over a period of 3 or 4 weeks (according to the treatment schedule) . 
 The blood samples taken for PK analysis will be analyzed by the central laboratory using standard assay methods, including the predose samples (trough levels) collected

SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 57  of 82  for this purpose. An aliquot of each sample will be stored at - 20ºC until the end of the 
study  and centrally measured.  
 
Pharmacokinetic data (including total  IgG trough levels) will also be compared to 
historical  data from previous PID studies with Intratect and Bivigam, as well as to 
available data from literature.  
 The statistical analysis of the PK data will be performed by . 
9.5.3  Pharmacokinetic Endpoints  
• IgG trough levels (total  IgG) before each administration  
• IgG trough levels (subclasses  1-4) at baseline and before the 7th/5th infusion of the 
3-week/4- week schedule, respectively (with the exception of pediatric subjects aged 
2-5 years, inclusive)  
• IgG trough levels of specific antibody levels ( anti-pneumococcal capsular 
polysaccharide, anti-hemophilus influenzae type B, anti -measles, anti -tetanus, 
anti-cytomegalovirus, and anti -HBs/hepatitis  B) at baseline and before the 
7th/5th infusion of the 3 -week/4- week schedule, respectively (with the exception of 
pediatric subjects aged 2- 11 years, inclusive)  
• Pharmacokinetic parameters at steady -state: maximum concentration ( Cmax), time 
to reach maximum  concentration ( tmax), trough concentration ( Ctrough), area under 
the concentration- time curve calculated from start to end of the  dosing interval  
(AUC tau), steady -state clearance ( CLss), %Fluctuation, and if possible, terminal 
elimination half -life (t1/2), terminal elimination rate constant ( λz), as well as other 
parameters described in greater detail in Section 10.10 . 
10 STATISTICS  
The statistical planning and evaluation of the clinical study  will be carried out by a 
qualified bio statistician in accordance with the ICH -guidelines and adequate 
biostatistical standard operating procedures . A SAP, providing details about the 
statistical methods for the analyses,  will be finalized before the inclusion of the first 
subject in the study  to avoid any data driven bias. This ensures that the integrity of the  
analyses is maintained.  
Any deviations from the planned analyses will be descri bed and justified in the clinical 
study report.  
10.1 Analysis Sets  
The following analysis sets  will be defined:  
All Subjects Enrolled Set:  
The All Subjects Enrolled Set includes all subjects who have given informed 
consent/assent  to this study.  
Safety Set (SAF) : 
The SAF comprises all subject s who have received at least 1 dose of study medication.  
Subjects will be analyzed according to the treat ment received.  

Study No.: 991  Final Version 4.0 Clinical Study Protocol  
EudraCT No.: 2015 -003652 -52/ 
IND No.: 17046   21-MAR -2018  
 
SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 58  of 82  Full Analysis Set (FAS):  
The FAS includes all subjects following the principle of intention- to-treat. The FAS 
comprises all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication (i.e., there is 
no difference between the FAS and the SAF in this study) . 
Per-protocol Set (PPS) : 
The PP S includes  all subject s who are compliant with the study protocol without any 
major protocol deviations . Classification of protocol deviations as major or minor will be 
agreed upon at the Data Review Meeting (DRM) prior to database lock . The decision to 
carry out  any analysis based on the PPS will be evaluated at the DRM. Any analysis 
based on the PPS will be performed for the primary efficacy endpoint as an additional 
analysis.  
Pharmacokinetic Trough Set:  
The PK Trough Set includes all subjects following the principles of the SAF for whom at 
least 1  trough concentration of total  IgG and/or subclass/specific I gG was available.  
Dense Pharmacokinetic Subset:  
The Dense PK Subset includes all subjects following the principles of the SAF for 
whom at least 1 concentration of total IgGs, IgG subclasses 1- 4, or IgG specific 
antibody levels ( anti-pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide , anti-hemophilus 
influenzae type B, anti -measles, anti -tetanus, anti -cytomegalovirus, and 
anti-HBs/hepatitis  B), measured in the dense sampling period (i .e., after/at the 
7th infusion of the 3- week schedule or after /at the 5 th infusion of the 4- week schedule 
[depending on dosing schedule]) was available.  
The FAS will be used for efficacy analyses. The safety analyses will be based on the 
SAF. All PK analyses involving trough concentrations will be conducted using the PK 
Trough Set. Pharmacokinetic parameter derivation will be done using the Dense PK 
Subset.  
10.2 Protocol Deviations  
Deviations from the protocol will be documented on an on- going basis during conduct 
of the clinical study  based on monitoring reports  (e.g., failure of eligibility criteria),  data 
management checks , and statistical programming (e.g., prohibited medications  based 
on drug codes)  and stored in the clinical study database . Protocol deviations will be 
collected and agreed in the DRM  to find protocol deviations with major impact on 
subject safety  or the validity of the study  data. Subjects with major protocol deviations 
will be excluded from the PPS under the assumption that the deviation may have an 
impact on the efficacy analysis.  
The investigator should not implement any  deviation from, or changes of the protocol , 
without agreement by the sponsor and prior review and documented approval/favorable opinion from the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)/Independent 
Ethics Committee ( IEC) of an amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an 
immediate hazard(s) to study  subjects . The investigator, or person designated by the 
investigator, should document and explain any deviation from the approved protocol.

SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 59  of 82  10.3 General Considerations  
Quantitative (continuous) data - absolute values and differences from baseline, where 
appropriate - will be summarized with number of observations  (n), arithmetic mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Confidence intervals (95%, 
2-sided) will be added where applicable.  
Qualitative (categorical)  data will be summarized using number of observations (n), 
and frequency and percentages of subjects. Unless stated otherwise, the calculation of 
percentages will be based on the total number of subjects in the population of interest . 
Thus cou nts of missing observations will be included in the denominator and presented 
as a separate category.  Confidence intervals (95%, 2- sided) will be added, where 
applicable.  
Definition of Baseline  
In general, the last nonmissing valid observation before the first infusion  will serve as 
the baseline measurement  and may be measured at an unscheduled visit . 
Missing Data Conventions  
All available data will be included in the analyses and will be summarized as far as 
possible. Unless otherwise specified, there will be no substitution of missing data, 
i.e., missing data will not be replaced; missing data will be handled as ‘missing’ in the 
statistical evaluation.  
A more detailed description of the handling of missing data will be provided in the SAP.  
Pooling of C enters  
As it is expected that the number of subjects within each center will be very small, 
summaries of data by center would be unlikely to be informative; data from all centers 
will be pooled.  
Subgroups  
Besides the analyses sets as described in Section  10.1, and the planned subgroup 
analyses for the PK parameters (see Section  10.10 ), subgroup analyses by age 
category are planned to be performed for the primary efficacy endpoints and for AEs 
(infusional AEs and TEAEs).  
The age categories for the subgroup analyses will be children ( 2-11 years , inclusive ), 
adolescents (12- 17 years , inclusive ), and adults (18-75 years , inclusive ). The age 
categories will be consistent for all subgroup analyses, with the exception of PK where blood samples will be taken from all pediatric subjects aged 6 through 17 years and 
where PK blood samples are optional for pediatric subjects aged 2 through 5 years . 
Age will be the age recorded at screening (initial visit). The same age will be used per subject during the entire study  (i.e., if a subject’s age changes from 17 to 18  years 
during the study , the subject will remain in the age category of 12 through 17 years 
during the entire study ).

SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 60  of 82  10.4 Efficacy Analyses  
Analyses of the efficacy parameters will be based on the FAS and PPS as determined 
during the DRM. The analysis based on the FAS will be performed for the primary efficacy endpoint and the secondary efficacy endpoints, while the possible analysis based on the PPS will be carried out as an additional analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint only (see Section 10.1). 
10.5 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint is t he acute serious bacterial infection rate (i.e. the mean 
number of acute serious bacterial infections per subject -year). 
The primary endpoint will be analyzed using  the upper 1- sided 99% confidence limit for 
the acute serious bacterial infection rate, which will be calculated using a Poisson model accounting for  the length of the observation period per subject . 
A generalized linear model assuming the Poisson distribution for the number  of acute 
serious bacterial infections with the logarithm as link function will be used. The Poisson model will include the natural logarithm of the length of the observation period in years as an offset to account for the (possibly) different lengths of the observation periods per subject . 
To assess the primary outcome for efficacy, the null hypothesis of 1 or more acute 
serious bac terial infections per subject -year will be tested against the 1- sided 
alternative hypothesis of less than 1  acute serious bacterial infection per subject -year 
at the 1% level of statistical significance. This 1- sided hypothesis test will utilize the 
same Poisson model as used for the calculation of the upper confidence limit. Rejection of the null hypothesis if 1 or more acute serious bacterial infection per 
subject -year will result in the acceptance of the alternate hypothesis of less than 
1 acute serious bacterial infection per subject- year.  
If sensitivity analyses is to be carried out (the decision will be made during the DRM), 
this will be performed with the PPS . 
10.6 Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
The following secondary  endpoint s will be summarized descriptively:  
• IgG trough levels (total  IgG) before each infusion will be presented in tabulated 
statistical summaries of the raw data and absolute changes from baseline values by infusion schedule and overall (evaluation of IgG trough levels will 
include the calculation of the proportion of subject s who failed to meet the target 
level of ≥ 5 g/L). 
• Rate  of any infections: The annual rate of infection will be calculated as the 
mean number of all infections (serious plus nonserious) per subject- year. The 
point estimate will be the total number of infections in all subject s divided by the

• Time to resolution of infections will be calculated as infection stop date – 
infection start date  + 1. The presentation will be done by infusion schedule and 
overall and will include the frequencies of number of days until the resolution of infection. Kaplan- Meier plots will be generated for time to resolution of infection 
by infusion schedule and overall.  
• Antibiotic treatment information will be collected via the subject  diary: Monthly 
rates of days on antibiotic treatment will be calculated per subject- month. The 
point estimates will be the total number of days on antibiotics in all subject s 
divided by the total duration expressed in months (of 30 days) of the observation 
period of all subject s. 
• Rate of time  lost from school/work due to infections and their treatment: Monthly 
rates of the number of days not able to attend school/work due to infections and 
their treatment will be calculated per subject- month. The point estimates will be

SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 62  of 82 10.7 Safety Analysis 
The safety endpoints will be summarized descriptively.  
 
Adverse events temporally associated with the infusion are AEs occurring during infusion or within 1, 24, and 72 hours after the end of infusion and will be defined as 
infusional AEs. Summaries of AEs will be based on TEAEs, defined as those events 
with onset date/time at or after the first infusion date/time. All AEs will be attributed to the most recently received infusion rate at the time of onset. Presentation for TEAEs will be done overall.  The safety analysis has  to consider the severity, causality, and 
seriousness  of AEs.  
 Safety issues will mainly be addressed by measuring:  
 
• The number of infusional AEs (including nonproduct related; occurring during 
infusion or within 1, 24, and 72  hours after the end of infusi on). 
• The number of related infusional AEs ( occurring during infusion or within 1, 24, 
and 72 hours after the end of infusion). 
• The number of infusional AEs ( occurring during infusion or within 1, 24, and 
72 hours after end of infusion) by infusion ( e.g., 1st infusion, 2nd infusion, etc).  
• The number of serious infusional AEs ( occurring during infusion or within 1, 24, 
and 72 hours after the end of infusion). 
• The number of nonserious infusional AEs ( occurring during infusion or within 1, 
24, or 72 hours afte r the end of infusion). 
• The number of infusions temporally (within 72 hours) associated with 1 or more 
infusional AEs.  
• The number of all AEs.  
• The mean number of AEs temporally associated with infusions per infusion.  
• The number of TEAEs (infusional and noninfusional) . 
• The number of TEAEs (noninfusional ). 
• The number of serious TEAEs  (infusional and noninfusional) . 
• The number of serious TEAEs (infusional) . 
• The number of serious TEAEs (non infusional ). 
• The number of related TEAEs (non  infusional ). 
• The number  of serious related TEAEs (noninfusional ). 
• The number of TEAEs  by maximum severity  (noninfusional ). 
• The number of TEAEs leading to study drug infusion interruption and/or study 
drug infusion stop.  
• The number of TEAEs leading to premature withdrawals.  
• The number of TEAEs of special interest.  
• The number of ADRs.  
• The number of expected/unexpected TEAEs or ADRs.  
• C hanges in safety  laboratory parameters  (outside reference range and clinically 
relevant) . 
• Results  of intravascular hemolysis parameters  (number of positive hemolysis 
test results) . 
• C hanges in vital sign parameter s. 
• C hanges in physical examination parameter s. 
 Adverse events will be coded using  the most current  version of MedDRA. The version 
used will be defined in the SAP. Incidence rates (i .e., number and percentage of 
affected subjects ) will be calculated for the coding levels system organ class and

SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 63  of 82  preferred term . Further analyses of AEs will focus on seriousness, intensity, causal 
relationship to study medication, and outcome. I mmediately reportable AEs (including 
SAEs etc ) will be displayed in detail.  Where appropriate, analyses of AEs will consider 
the observed intra- subject correlation of the same type or any type of AE, and as such 
within -subject events may not be independent. Methodology f or these analyses is 
described in the SAP.  
 
An exploratory 2- sided 90% confidence limit interval will be calculated for the total 
number of subjects with TEAEs and for the number of subjects with infusional AEs  
(i.e., AEs within 72 hours after the end of i nfusion) . 
 An exploratory upper 1- sided 95% confidence limit will be calculated for the proportion 
of the infusions with 1 or more temporally -associated AE (including nonproduct 
related) . The proportion will be calculated as the total number of infusions with 
infusional AEs (AEs occurring during or within 1, 24, and 72 hours after the end of an 
infusion) divided by the total number of infusions.  
 All AEs will be captured and registered ( listed ) and will include separate reports of all 
AEs and of all AEs ju dged by the investigator to be associated with the BT595 infusion, 
even if the sponsor determines the AE not to be product -related . 
 Safety laboratory assessments will be categorized with respect to the laboratory specific reference ranges as normal/abnormal. Abnormal values will be further classified with respect to clinical relevance. Changes over time will be described by means of “shift -tables”.  The raw data will be listed. Values below or above the 
reference values in the data listings will be flagged.  All laboratory values will be 
converted into common units for presentation reasons.  
 Intravascular hemolysis laboratory assessments will be summarized by the number and percentage of subjects and infusions with the given results at each visit. In case of 
positive Coombs’ test results, further evaluations and/or time points will be included in the summaries.  
 For the viral safety parameters  (retention samples), the presentation of the data will be 
detailed in the SAP.  
 For vital sign parameters, absolute values and changes from baseline will be presented for each study  visit using summary descriptive statistics.  
 Physical examination data will be summarized at each visit.  
 Safety analys es will be based on the SAF . 
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
To monitor the safety data from adult subject s and provide advice and 
recommendations on the enrol lment of pediatric subjects, a DSMB consisting of 
independent experts will be convened (see Section 9.4 for further details) . 
 The DSMB Charter will include details of the outputs provided for the DSMB review.

No interim analysis is planned during the study . 
10.9 Determination of Sample Size  
A sample size of at least 50 subject s will ensure a power of at least 80% to reject the 
null hypothesis of an acute serious bacterial infection rate greater or equal to 1.0  by 
means of a 1-sided test and a Type 1 error of  0.01 assuming a true underlying rate of 
acute serious bacterial infections of 0.5 per year. Thus, about 70 subject s will be 
enrolled to account for drop- outs.  
The sample size will be at least 50 evaluable male or female subject s (2-75 years , 
inclusive ), including at least 20 pediatric subjects (i.e., children [ 2-11 years , inclusive ] 
or adolescents [12- 17 years , inclusive ]). Pharmacokinetic investigations will be carried 
out in at least 20 adult subject s and in pediatric subject s (6-17 years , inclusive ). 
The above sample size number (to obtain at least 50  subject –years) and inclusion of at 
least 20  pediatric (i .e., children [ 2-11 years , inclusive ] or adolescent [12- 17 years , 
inclusive ]) subject s with the age distribution representative of the patient  population 
follows the advice provided by both the EMA guidelines 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94033/2007 rev. 2, 2010 ) and the FDA guidelines  (FDA, 2008 ). 
10.10  Pharmacokinetic Analyses 
All PK data (IgG trough levels and PK parameters; as defined in Section  9.5.1) will be 
summarized by descriptive statistics by analyte (total  IgG, IgG subclasses  1-4, and 
IgG specific antibody levels [ anti-pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide , 
anti-hemophilus influenzae type B, anti -measles, anti -tetanus, anti -cytomegalovirus, 
and anti -HBs/hepatitis  B]) for the study population as a  whole, for each age category, 
for both treatment schedules (3- week and 4 -week schedule)  together , and treatment 
schedules separately. Similarly, data on dose levels and infusion rates will be 
summarized. Data from the different age categories will be compared descriptively. 
However, no formal statistical analysis will be performed.  
 
Pharmacokinetic  serum samples will be optionally analyzed to identify additional 
specific antibody levels/immunological variables of medical relevance which may be of 
importance with regard to efficacy of an IVIg in PID.  
 Graphical presentations will be provided for the IgG trough levels as well as for the PK 
time profiles for individual subject s and summari zed by analyte (for subjects 
6-75 years, inclusive) , by schedule, and by  age category  (adult [18-75 years , inclusive ] 
vs pediatric [ 6-17 years , inclusive  for total  IgG and IgG subclasses  1-4], [12-17 years, 
inclusive for IgG specific antibody levels ], and [2-5 years, inclusive] ). 
 The time -course of total IgG , IgG subclasses 1- 4, and IgG specific antibody levels in 
adult subjects (18- 75 years, inclusive) and pediatric subjects (6- 17 years, inclusive for 
total IgG and IgG  subclasses 1- 4; 12 -17 years inclusive for IgG  specific antibody 
levels ) will be analyzed by noncompartmental analysis. Key PK parameters will be 
derived from this analysis: maximum concentration (C
max), time to reach maximum 
concentration (t max), trough concentration ( Ctrough), area under the concentration- time 
curve (AUC) calculated from time zero to time t of the last measured concentration 
(AUC (0-t)), area under the concentration- time curve calculated from start to the end of 
Study No.: 991  Final Version 4.0 Clinical Study Protocol

steady -state (Vss), %Fluctuation, and if data permit, terminal elimination half -life (t 1/2), 
area under the concentration- time curve calculated from time zero extrapolated to 
infinity (AUC (0-inf)), mean residence time (MRT), and terminal elimination rate constant 
(λz). 
 
A similar analytical approach might not be possible for pediatric subjects (2-5 years, 
inclusive) where only sparse sampling ( total IgG only) is planned. Therefore, a 
population modelling approach will be proposed.  First, a preliminary model based on 
prior PK data obtained with BT595 in adult subjects (18- 75 years, inclusive) and 
pediatric subjects (6- 17 years, inclusive) will be established. This model will be updated 
and used to reconstruct dense individual concentration -time profiles for all subjects, 
including the youngest pediatric subjects (2 -5 years, inclusive), and to derive the 
different key PK parameters.  
 Finally, all data will be summarized by descriptive statistics for the study population as a whole, and for each age category. Data from the different age categories will be compared descriptively. However, no formal statistical analysis will be performed.   
 Evaluation of the total IgG  trough levels will include the calculation of the proportion of 
subject s who failed to meet the target level (≥5 g/L) prior to dose adjustment . In 
addition, an intra -individual comparison to currently licensed IVIg products i n the same 
subject s (i.e., using prestudy  data)  will be performed by suitable methods . No formal 
statistical test will be performed for these variables.  
 Pharmacokinetic data (including total  IgG trough levels) will also be compared to 
historical data from previous PID studies with Intratect and Bivigam  (already marketed 
10% IVIgs) and to available data from literature.  
11 D ATA MANAGEMENT 
11.1 Data Collection  
Electronic Case Report Form (e CRF)  
The eCRF is the primary data collection instrument for the clinical study. All data to be 
recorded according to this clinical study protocol must be documented. Entries in the eCRF must only be made by the investigator or persons authorized by the investigator.  
A list of all persons who are allowed to make entries in the e CRF must be available in 
each study site.  Electronic case report form  completion guidelines including 
e.g. handling of data corrections will be described in the Data Management Plan.  
 Clinical study data will be directly entered via the e CRF into the study database on a 
central server by the authorized investigator and/or study personnel.  
 According to the ICH GCP Guideline ( Section  5.5), it is ensured that the electronic data 
capture system is built up with the following requirements: validated system, 
functionality of different user roles and access administration, password protection, given traceability, record keeping, and availability of audit trail functionality , and as well

Subjects will be identified by a unique study specific number and/or code in any 
database. The subject's name and any other identifying detail will not be included in any study data- electronic file . 
Laboratory samples (e.g., for IgG trough levels, specific antibody trough levels, safety 
laboratory levels, intravascular hemolysis levels , viral safety  [retention samples ], virus 
serology, PK, and any other study spec ific laboratory data) will be collected at each  
site. 
Outcome measure data (e.g., the health- related quality -of-life questionnaire responses) 
will be collected by the i nvestigator or assigned study personnel at each site to be 
further processed into the eCRF .
 
The complete data management activities (data capture,  data entry, data validation, 
query handling, data editing  after entry, coding, database closure, etc) will be defined 
in advance within a D ata Management Plan together with a description of the 
personnel responsible for data entry/correction performance and controlling as well as specific data handling procedures.

appropriate,  at the earliest possible time. This will allow an early joint decision to be 
made as to whether or not the subject should continue in the study . This decision will 
be documented by both the investigator and the  CRO . 
13.8 Confidentiality  
The objectives and contents of this clinical study  as well as its results are to be treated 
as confidential and may not be made accessible to third parties.  
 Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. These regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the 
following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why 
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization. For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e., that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
13.9 Final Report and Publication  
For each study , an integrated final report according to ICH -requirements will be 
produced.  At the end of the study , the sponsor will provide the Competent Authority 
and IEC/IRB with a summary of the clinical study  report within 6 months  after the end 
of the study  (where required) or as agreed with the C ompetent Authorit ies. 
 It is generally recommended that the results of clinical studie s be presented at 
congresses and symposia and/or published in scientific journals. Prior to their publication, all results of medical tests with the sponsor’s products, and/or publications or lecture manuscripts concerning such results, are to be reviewed and discussed by 
the coordinating investigator and the sponsor by mutual agreement.  
 Each investigator is obligated to keep data pertaining to the study  secret. He/she must

• Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  or clinical study  subject 
administered an IMP  and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE  may be any aggravation or new unfavorable and 
unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
IMP, whether or not considered related to the IMP. 
This includes abnormal laboratory and other investigation results which are considered clinically relevant by the investigator (unless already pre- existing at 
baseline). However, if an abnormal laboratory value is a sign of an already reported AE (e.g., infection), the respective abnormal laboratory value does not 
constitute a separate AE.  
A surgical or invasive procedure is not an AE in itself. Instead, the condition for which the surgical or invasive procedure is performed may be an AE. Planned or elective surgery or procedures (i .e., planned prior to signature of informed 
consent/assent ) for a pre -existing condition and the pre- existing condition leading 
to surgery or procedure are not AEs. However, if the pre- existing condition 
worsened after signature of informed consent /assent , the worsening of the 
condition constitutes an AE.  
Worsening of the disease under study (underlying disease): This will be captured by efficacy parameters and should not usually be recorded as an AE, unless 1 or 
more of the following criteria are met:  
 The worsening of the disease under study constitutes a SAE 
 A deterioration exceeding the usual fluctuations of the disease under study has occurred in the opinion of the investigator  
 The worsening leads to discontinuation of the study medication  
 Additional treatment is required for the worsening, e .g., concomitant 
medication is added or changed.  
No causal relationship with the investigational drug, or comparator drug, or study procedures is implied by the use of the term “Adverse Event”.  
• Adverse Reaction (ADR) of an I nvestigational Medicinal Product:  
All untoward and unintended responses to an IMP  related to any dose 
administered. All AEs judged by either the reporting investigator or the sponsor 
as having a reasonable causal relationship to a medicinal product qualify as ADRs (= related AEs). The expression reasonable causal relationship means to 
convey in general that there are facts,  evidence, or argument s to suggest a 
causal relationsh ip. This definition also covers medication errors and uses 
outside what is foreseen in the protocol, including misuse and abuse of the IMP  
• Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose*:  
 results in death

SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 75  of 82  - Death is an outcome of an AE and not an AE in itself. All 
deaths, regardless of cause or relationship must be reported for study subjects.  
 is life -threatening  
- “Life-threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was 
at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
- In-subject hospitalization means that the subject has been 
formally admitted to a hospital for medical reasons, for any length of time, which may or may not be overnight. It does not include presentation and care within an emergency department.  
- A complication that oc curs during hospitalization and 
prolongs the existing hospitalization is an SAE. Complications that occur during hospitalization but do not prolong the existing hospitalization and do not meet any other seriousness criteria are nonserious AEs.  
- Elective or preplanned (prior to signature of informed consent/assent ) hospitalization for investigations, medical or 
surgical treatment does not meet this seriousness criterion. However, if the underlying condition for which hospital treatment or surgery had been planned worsened during the study, the worsening of the condition is to be reported as an SAE.  
 results in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity  
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 is another important medical event  
- Adverse events that may not be im mediately life -threatening 
or result in death or hospitalization but m ay jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above, should be reported as serious. Medical and scientific judg ment must be 
exercised in deciding whether an event is serious.  
* “At any dose” does not necessarily imply that the subject is receiving the study drug at the time of the event.  
• Diagnosis vs Signs/Symptoms  
The investigator should provide a diagnosis rather than individual signs and symptoms, wherever possible and appropriate. However, if there is not enough information to provide a diagnosis, individual signs and symptoms are to be recorded. If a diagnosis is accompanied by unusual symptoms, the diagnosis itself and the unusual symptoms have to be reported separately. For SAEs  and 
other IRAEs,  the investigator shall provide any other supporting information that 
may be required for the assessment of the events, specifically in the free text narrative description of the case. This is of particular importance in situations where a diagnosis cannot  (yet) be made. Any subject identifying data on

SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 76  of 82  supporting documents (e.g., name, address, phone number) have to be 
obliterated prior to sending them to the sponsor.  
A complication of  an AE constitutes another AE. For example  in diarrhea leading 
to dehydration, diarrhea and dehydration would be captured as separate AEs.  
The eCRF provides for a number of items to be completed for each AE. This 
includes the onset date, end date, intensity/severity, seriousness, action taken 
with study medication, treatment for the AE, outcome, and causal relationship of the AE with the study medication, other drugs, or study procedures.  
• Onset Date, End Date 
If an AE started during the study but did not end before the final closing (follow -up) visit, the investigator must make a reasonable effort to establish the 
outcome and the end date. If this is not possible, e.g., because the AE is still 
ongoing, or the subject is lost to follow -up, there will be no end date for the AE.  
For all AEs that resolve, resolve with sequelae, or have a fatal outcome, an end date must be provided.  
If an AE stops and restarts later, all occurrences have to be recorded separately.  
If an AE starts as a nonserious AE and becomes serious at a later point in time, 
the following applies in regard to onset and end dates:  
• Intensity/Severity  
Refers to the extent to which an AE affects the subject’s daily activities. Severity will be categorized according to the following criteria:  
Table: Adverse Event Severity  
Mild The AE does not interfere with the subject’s routine 
activities.  
Moderate  The AE interferes with the subject’s daily routine, but usual 
routine activities can still be carried out.  
Severe  The AE results in inability to perform routine activities.  
Severe vs Serious:  The severity is used to describe the intensity of an event. 
This is not the same as seriousness, which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as the guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
Example: While an event may be of “severe” intensity, it may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as severe headache. On the other hand, a myocardial infarction would be usually regarded as serious, even if its intensity is “mild”.  
Adverse event s with changes in severity:  If an AE changes in severity, this 
will be captured as 1 AE, with the highest severity grade recorded.

SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 77  of 82  • Seriousness  
For definition of seriousness criteria refer to S ection  9.3.1 For an S AE, all 
seriousness criteria that apply have to be reported. Reporting requirements by 
the investigator are detailed in Appendix  2. 
• Action Taken W ith Study Medication 
The action taken with study medication as a result of the AE has to be documented. In the situation that the AE leads to permanent discontinuation of the study medication, this meets the definition of an AE leading to subject’s withdrawal from the study, which is an IRAE. Reporting requirements by the investigator are detailed in Appendix  2. 
• Treatment for the A dverse Event  
It has to be specified in the e CRF if counteractive treatment was given for the 
AE. Any treatment for an AE, whether pharmacological or other (e .g., surgical) 
treatment, has to be recorded in the e CRF.  
• Outcome  
The following categories are used:  
 Resolved 
- Indicates that the event has fully resolved.  
 Resolving  
- Indicates that the event is in the process of recovery but has not yet fully resolved.  
 Not resolved  
- Indicates that the event is ongoing and there has been no recovery.  
 Resolved with sequelae 
- Indicates that there is a residual, possibly permanent consequence of the event (e.g., residual hemiparesis subsequent to stroke).  
 Fatal  
- Indicates that the subject died due to the event. The outcome “fatal” applies only to the event(s) that were the cause(s) of death. For other AEs that were ongoing at the time of death, the outcome 
must not be “fatal” but “not resolved”.  
• Causal Relationship of A dverse Events 
The causal relationship with the study medication has to be reported for each AE. It refers to the presence or absence of a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the study medication and the AE . The investigator is asked 
to use medic al judgment and take into account the nature of the AE ; subject’s 
medical history ; temporal relation; response to withdrawal or interruption of study 
drug (dechallenge) ; response to reintroduction of study drug (rechallenge) ; and 
any alternative explanatio ns such as underlying or concomitant diseases, 
concomitant drugs, or study procedures.

SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 78  of 82  The following categories are used:  
 Related: There is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between 
the study medication and the AE.  
 Not related: There is no reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
between the study medication and the AE.  
For SAEs  and other IRAEs, the investigator is asked to specify if there are 
alternative and/or additional explanations for the occurrence of the event, 
e.g., concomitant drugs, study procedures, or concomitant/underlying disease, 
and should provide this information already with the initial case report.

SOP -CCR- 007-T001_2.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 79  of 82  Appendix  2: "Reporting Procedures"  
Reporting Procedure:  
All IRAE/SAEs have to be recorded in the eCRF immediately , but not later than 
24 hours , after the investigational site becoming aware of the IRAE/SAE. In addition to 
the AE pages, the following e CRF pages have to be updated or completed at the same 
time as necessary: Subject accountability, study drug accountability, subject 
demographics, medical history, concomitant medication, and study completion/termination (in case of an AE leading to withdrawal).  
The investigator must report the IRAE/SAE by means of a paper IRAE/SAE form within 
24 hours  of becomin g aware of the event via fax or email to the following contact:  
Biotest C orporate Drug Safety  
Email   
Biotest C orporate Drug Safety  
Fax Number   
 Email  
 Fax Number   
For questions regarding IRAE/SAEs or to notify the sponsor of an IRAE/SAE in the event of technical failure of the email or fax system, the investigator should contact Biotest CDS by phone under  
Once the e CRF is av ailable again, the investigator has to record the IRAE/SAE and all 
additional information as required immediately ( within a maximum of  24 hours ). 
Whenever follow -up information becomes available to a previously recorded IRAE/SAE, 
this has to be entered into the e CRF by the investigator immediately but not later than 
24 hours after becoming aware of the follow -up information. In addition, any supporting 
documents (e.g., medical records, autopsy report, ECG , or laboratory reports) as part of 
the follow -up information to an IRAE/SAE must be sent accompanied by a cover  page 
and provided via fax or email within a maximum of  24 hours  of the investigator 
becoming aware of the information to the reporting contact above.  
The investigator has to undertake active follow -up for subjects with IRAE/SAEs. The 
investigator shall respond to queries raised by the sponsor with regard to IRAE/SAEs within the timelines stipulated in the query, and provide all necessary information as requested. In case of a fatal or life- threatening SAE, the sponsor will contact the 
investigator urgently to obtain required additional information within 1 business day. If 
supporting documents are requested by the sponsor (e.g., copies of medical records, 
laboratory reports, ECG tracings, autopsy report), the investigator must ensure that subject identifying data are obliterated prior to sending to the sponsor. The supporting documents should carry the subject ID for identification.  
If required the investigator is responsible to inform local I ECs/IRBs of safety reports in 
compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Copies of all correspondence relating to reporting of safety reports to IECs/IRB s shoul d be maintained in the 
Investigator Site File/ Regulatory Binder.

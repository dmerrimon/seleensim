CONFIDENTIALProtocol Synopsis
Title:   A Phase 1b Open -label Study Investigating the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of 
Administration of Subcutaneous Blinatumomab for the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Indolent 
Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma
Study Phase:   1b
Indication:   Relapsed/Refractory Indolent Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma
Primary Objective:
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous (SC) blinatumomab dose 
administrations 
Secondary Objectives:   
To determine pharmacokinetic s(PK) with continuous intrav enous (cIV) and SC administrations
To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) tested for blinatumomab administered 
subcutaneously 
To determine the incidence of anti -blinatumomab antibody formation following SC administration 
To evaluate efficacy response following treatment with SC blin atumomab administration
Exploratory Objective s:
To determine the pharmacodynamic (PD) time profiles for B -and T -lymphocytes as well as 
cytokine profiles during SC administration
To evaluate efficacy response following treatment with SC blinatumomab admini stration using 
Lugano criteria if positron emission tomography -computed tomography (PET/CT )is used 
for evaluation (Appendix B)
Hypotheses:   
Blinatumomab administered through the SC route will demonstrate a tolerable safety -profile with 
serum concentrations comparable to those for which efficacy was shown with cIV administration 
in subjects with indolent relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL)
Primary Endpoint:   
Subject grade, incidence, and sev erity of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and adv erse ev ents

CONFIDENTIALStudy Design:   This is a global multi-center, Phase 1b open -label study investigating the safety 
and PK of blinatumomab administered subcutaneously for the treatment of relapsed/refractory 
indolent NHL.  The SC administration of blinatumomab will be tested for the first time in humans.  
Period 1 of the study will focus on the determination of PK, bioavailability, and safety profile of 
blinatumomab SC administration.  The PK and bioavailabili ty data from Period 1 of the study will 
be used in conjunction with safety data (DLT) to determine the SC MTD.  The MTD or the 
maximum tested dose, if MTD is not reached, will be further tested in Period 2 in an expanded 
cohort.  Efficacy of blinatumomab a dministered subcutaneously will also be investigated in each 
period of the study.
Cycle 1/Period 1:
In Period 1, 3 or more separate dose cohorts of up to 6 DLT evaluable subjects each will be 
enrolled and undergo treatment as follows:
Subjects will undergo an initial cIV blinatumomab run -in period (weeks 1 to 3) followed by a 
12-hour treatment free period .
Subjects will then receive SC administration (week 4) followed by a treatment free period 
of 2 to not more than 3 days .
After the SCadministration period, subjects should return to receive cIV treatment to 
complete 6 weeks of therapy (weeks 5 to 6) .  
For all cohorts, the initial cIV dose of blinatumomab will be 9 μg/day for the first 7 days (to 
mitigate for potential cytokine release syndrome [CRS ] and neurologic events associated with 
introduction to blinatumomab) which then will be escalated (dose -step) to 28 μg/day starting on 
day 8 through day 14 (week 2), and to 112 μg/day starting on day 15 until day 21 (week 3). 
After stopping cIV blinatumomab, t here is a12-hour treatment free period before starting 
SC blinatumomab .
SC blinatumomab starts after the 12 -hour treatment free period and will be administered 
(week 4) as the following dose -cohort levels:  
Dose Cohort 1: 112 μg q12h ×5 days for a total of 9 doses (n 6)
Dose Cohort 2:  225 μg q12h ×5 days for a total of 9 doses (n 6)
(Note:   A total of 9 SC doses will be given for the q12h dosing, so intensiv e PK samples can 
be obtained on day shift to reduce errors ).
Dose Cohort 3: 450 μg q24h ×5 days for a total of 5 doses (n6)
Additional Dose Cohorts : Dose level and dosing frequency to be determined as 
described below
One or more dosing regimens (refer to Dosing Schema Figure 1 ) may be selected based 
on clinical findings including safety, tolerability, and PK results from previous cohort s;
and after Dose Level Review Team (DLRT )review and make recommendations for the next 
SC cohort dose and frequency .  The dose may be increased (by 1dose level or between 
the dose of the previous cohort and the next higher dosing level in Figure 1schema), kept 
at the same dose level or decre ased by 1or more dose levels.  The dose frequency chosen 
(q12h, q 24h, q48h, q72h, q96h, or q7days) will be decided by the DLRT and will be based 
on the previous cohort PK data. 
Once the SC dosing is complete, a treatment free period of 2 to not more than 3 days 
between stopping SC and restarting cIV will be observed. Then the cIV blinatumomab 
dosing will resume at 112 μg/day (weeks 5 to 6) to complete 6 weeks of treatment.

CONFIDENTIALFor each SC dose cohort, if 1 of the 6 DLT evaluable subjects experience a DLT during the SC 
administration DLT evaluation period then the dose will be determined to be tolerable and the 
DLRT will decide the next dose lev el tobe initiated and the frequency of administration for 
the next cohort ; see Section 6.2.1.2.2 for definition of the DLT evaluation period .  
For each SCdose cohort, i f 2 of the 6 DLT evaluable subjects experience a DLT during the SC 
administration then dosing will stop for in dividual subjects who experience a DLT , a DLRT 
meeting will be conducted ,and further steps will be determined , such as dose de -escalation or 
increasing dosing interval ( Figure 1 ).  In addition, if subjects on this cohort have not 
reached the SC dosing, they will be allowed to stay on study but will finish cycle 1/period 1 
as cIV.
MTD will be defined as the highest do se lev el at which 1 of 6 subjects experience a DLT.  If no 
subject experiences a DLT, the MTD will be defined as the maximal dose tested.
For further details, see Section 6.2.1.2.1 andSection 6.2.1.2.3 .
Cycle 1/ Period 2: 
The aim of Period 2 will be to assess the MTD as derived from Period 1,or the maximum tested 
dose, if MTD has not been reached, for additional safety and preliminary efficacy data in an 
expanded cohort of up to 15 evaluable subjects receiving SC treatment only (no cIV run -in)
Figure 2 .
Doses for Cycle 1/Period 2 will be derived based on PK, bioavailability, and safety data collected 
in Cycle 1/Period 1 and DLRT review and recommendations.  Subjects will receive sequentially 
the estimated SC doses equiv alent to the 9 g/day cIV in week 1, SC dose sequiv alent to the 
28g/day cIV starting in week 1 and continuing into week 2, and then the SC dose sof the 
selected maximal dose and dosing interval from Cycle 1 /Period 1 starting in week 2 (day 12) 
and continuing to complete a total of 6 weeks of blinatu momab (see Section 6.2.1.2.2 for 
definition of the DLT ev aluation period for Period 2 ).
Sample Size:   Six DLT evaluable subjects will be enrolled at each SC dose level in 
Cycle 1/Period 1 .  Subjects may be replaced.  This sample size is based on practical 
considerations and is consistent with conv entional phase 1 oncology studies. If the true DLT rate 
is 10, the re is a 89 probability of observing 1 DLT and 11 probability of observing 2 or 
more DLT in 6subjects. If the true DLT rate is 30 , the probability of observing 1 DLT 
decreases to 42 and probability of observing 2 or more DLT increases to 58 .
Upto 15 evaluable subjects will be enrolled into Cycle 1/Period 2 with the planned target 
treatment dose being the highest tolerable dose regimen or highest tested dose regimen based 
on DLRT’s recommendations. Continuous toxicity monitoring for early termi nation of the trial in 
Cycle 1/Period 2 will be performed.  Termination of Cycle 1/P eriod 2 will occur if the posterior 
probability that the DLT rate is greater than 25 is at least 80.

Investigational Product
Amgen Investigational Product Dosage and Administration : Blinatumomab will be 
administered as SC or cIV.  
Cycle 1/ Period 1: Blinatumomab is administered as a cIVinfusion , 9μg/day cIV for the first 
7days to mitigate for potential CRS and neurologic events associated wi th introduction to 
blinatumomab.  The blinatumomab will then be escalated (dose -step) to 28 μg/day cIV 
starting on day 8 through day 14 (week 2), and to 112 μg/day cIV starting on day 15 
(week 3),for 21 days of treatment . In addition, the blinatumomab dose of 112 μg/day cIV may 
continue for any number of days required to bridge cIV dosing so that SC dosing begins on a 
Monday (unless the study site can administer SC injections on the weekend ).  There is then a
12-hour treatment free period that isfollowed by 5 days of SC dosing (week 4)for Dose 
Cohorts 1,2, and 3.  TheSCdose and frequency will be chosen by the DLRT for fu rther 
cohorts (see Figure 1).  There is then at least 2 days to not more than 3 days of no 
investigational product , followed by a return to investigational product 112 μg/day cIV 
administration for 2 weeks (weeks 5 and 6) to complete a total of 6 weeks of therapy for a single 
cycle .  
(Note:  A total of 9 SC doses will be given for the q12h dosing, so intensive PK samp les can be 
obtained on day shift to reduce errors).
Cycle 1/ Period 2: Subjects will receive the estimated SC equivalent doses of the 2 lower cIV 
doses given in the run -in period of Cycle 1/Period 1 sequentially: the equivalent SC dose of
9g/day cIV during week 1 ,the equivalent SC dose of28g/day cIV starting in week 1 and 
continuing into week 2 , and then the SC MTD from Cycle 1/Period 1 (or the maximum tested 
dose if MTD is not reached )starting in week 2 at the dosing and frequency determined in 
Cycle 1/Period 1 for a total of 6 weeks of SC blinatumomab.
Optional Cycle 2for Period 1 :A subject may receive a second cycle of blinatumomab if, in the 
investigator`s opinion, the subject derive sbenefit from treatment.  The optional cycle 2 of 
blina tumomab will be dosed at 9µg/day cIV for 7 days for days 1 through day 7, next the dose 
willbe escalated (dose -step) to 28 µg/day cIV for 7 days starting on day 8 through day 14, and 
then adv anced to 112 μg/day cIV for 28 days starting on day 15 through day 42.  
A treatment -free interval of 14 days will be observed after the completion of the first cycle 
of blinatumomab before starting the second cycle.

CONFIDENTIALOptional Cycle 2 for Period 2:  A subject may receive a second cycle of blinatumomab 
administered SC i f the subject derived clinical benefit (demonstrated on staging scans) 
from Cycle 1/Period 2 treatment.  
If no clinical benefit occurred with SC in Cycle 1/Period 2 then an optional Cycle 2/Period 2 
may still be given but will administered as a cIV infusion instead of SC.  If blinatumomab is 
administered as a cIV infusion it will be dosed at 9 µg/day cIV for 7 days for days 1 through 
day7, next the dose will be escalated (dose -step) to 28 µg/day cIV for 7 days starting on 
day 8 through day 14, and then advanced to 112 μg/day cIV for 28 days starting on day 15 
through day42.
A treatment -free interval of 14 days will be observed after the completion of the first cycle 
of blinatumomab before starting the second cycle.
Procedures:   At specified time poi nts outlined in the Schedule of Assessments subjects will 
undergo the following procedures: collection of informed consent form, medical history /current 
medical conditions , demographics, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance 
Status, physic al exam including neurologic examination, height, weight, medical and surgical 
histories, vital signs and temperature, PET-CT(per standard of care), CT scan (per standard of 
care), and bone marrow biopsy (per standard of care ).  Subjects will provide samples for 
coagulation, hematology with differential, blood chemistry profiles, urinalysis, hepatitis serology , 
human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV), anti -blinatumomab antibodies , and immunoglobulin G
(IgG).  Subjects will further p rovide samples for other specialty labs including cytokines, 
lymphocyte subsets, PK samples, and a serum or urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing 
potential.  Research staff will document the use of concomitant medications and all adv erse 
events re ported by the subject.  Approximately 30 days ( 7 days) after the last dose of 
blinatumomab, subjects will undergo a safety follow -up vis it.  For a full list of study procedures, 
including the timing of each procedure, please refer to Section 7and the Schedule of 
Assessments (Table 3, Table4, Table 5,Table 6, and Table7).

2. BACKGROUND AND RA TIONALE
2.1 Disease
Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) represents the tenth most common cancer with a 
yearly incidence of approximately 15/100,000 in the developed world 
(GLOBOCAN 2012). Globally, almost 400,000 new cases of NHL are diagnosed each 
year; approximately 200,000 patients die of NHL per year, with approximately 40 of 
them in developed countries ( GLOBOCAN 2012 ). The median age at diagnosis is 
66years of age ( Howlader et al,2016 ).
NHL is a heterogeneous set of malignancies with many histologic subtypes.  Various 
international classification systems have been merged into the World Health 
Organization classification (Harris et al, 1994 ).  For practical clinical purposes, NHL can 
be divided into indolent (low -grade) and aggressive (high -grade) lymphomas.  The main 
histological subtype of the indolent NHL is the follicular lymphoma, which accounts for 
approximately 20 of all NHL (Gribben 2007).  Diffuse large B -cell lymphoma with a 
frequency of approximately 25 among all NHL is the main variant of aggressive 
lymphomas , WHO classification 2008 (Swerdlow et al, 2008 ).  Most NHLs are B -cell

CONFIDENTIALderived (90 ) and express common B -cell antigens su ch as CD19, CD20, and 
CD22 (Gribben 2007 ). 
In addition, to histological classification, several factors predict the prognosis and help 
guide therapy.  The anatomical localization of disease will influence prognosis and 
management in NHL.  The most commonl y used staging system is the Ann Arbor 
classification.  Specifically for follicular lymphoma, important prognostic factors are the 
number of nodal areas, lactate dehydrogenase, age, stage, and hemoglobin 
concentrations.  These factors have been integrated into a “Follicular Lymphoma 
International Prognostic Index" (lPl), allowing risk/prognosis assessments for follicular 
lymphoma (Lister et al, 1989 ).
Management of NHL varies considerably, ranging from no initial therapy at all to 
multimodality therapy usin g radiotherapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and/or combinations 
of chemotherapy and immunotherapy.  Whereas most patients with limited disease may 
be cured, all indolent and up to 50 of aggressive NHL patients with advanced disease, 
(Ann Arbor stage lll/lV) c annot be cured by conventional chemotherapy 
(Armitage etal,1998 ).
Consequently, primary therapy is for most patients followed by additional therapies to 
manage first and later relapses . Duration of remission usually gets shorter ,and most 
patients inevitably die from their disease.
In relapse, indolent NHL patients may be retreated with chemotherapy.  An alternative to 
chemotherapy for these patients is immunotherapy with the monoclonal antibody 
rituximab directed against CD20, wh ich is increasingly used to manage relapsed stage 
lll/lV follicular lymphoma patients.  Rituximab has also been reported to improve the 
outcome of first line therapy when administered in combination with cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, Oncovin (vincristine) ,andprednisone ([CHOP ]chemotherapy regimen) for 
the treatment of aggressive lymphoma (Gribben 2007 ).
Most patients with advanced stage indolent disease will succumb to their disease.  
Therefore, a high -unmet medical need exists to develop novel agents t hat will further 
improve the survival of NHL patients.  Current limitations of chemotherapy and the 
success of rituximab indicate that immunotherapies could be of significance.  Ongoing 
studies using chimeric antigen receptor T -cell therapies are being inv estigated, and have 
provided preliminary evidence of CD19 as an important potential target 
(Singh etal,2016 ).

CONFIDENTIAL2.2 Amgen Investigational Product Background : Blinatumomab
Blinatumomab (BLINCYTO, AMG 103, formerly also known as MT103 or 
bscCD19xCD3) is a member of a novel class of bispecific antibody constructs called 
BiTE, or “bispecific T -cell engagers” ( Dreier et al, 2002 ,Schlereth et al, 2006 ).  
Blinatumomab is a BiTEantibody construct with dual binding specificities.  T -cells are 
bound by its anti -CD3 moiety, whereas B lymphoblasts and cells are bound by the 
anti-CD19 moiety.  This unique feature of blinatumomab allows it to transiently connect 
malignant cells with T -cells, thereby inducing T- cell mediated killing of the bound 
malignant cell.  In p reclinical models, blinatumomab -mediated T- cell activation involves 
the transient release of inflammatory cytokines and proliferation of T -cells.  The 
subsequent serial lysis of multiple malignant B cells by a single blinatumomab -activated 
T-cell closely r esembles a natural cytotoxic T -cell reaction.  In clinical studies, T -cell 
activation, B -cell depletion, and transient cytokine release have been observed in 
patients being evaluated.
Blinatumomab is approved in multiple regions for the treatment of Philad elphia 
chromosome -negative relapsed or refractory B -cell precursor acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (ALL).
Detailed information on the nonclinical effects of blinatumomab, and its clinical effects in 
this patient population is provided in the current country -specific prescribing information 
for blinatumomab .  The European Union Summary of Product Characteristics provides 
detailed product information for investigators in the European Union and in regions 
where blinatumomab is not currently approved .  The U nited States (US) Prescribing 
Information provides detailed product information for investigators in the US.
Refer to the specific section of the Investigator’s Brochure for additional information 
related to the physical, chemical, and pharmaceutical properties and formulation(s).
2.3 Dose Selection
2.3.1 Pharmacokinetics
The PK of blinatumomab was assessed over a dose range from 5 to 90 μg/m2/day 
following cIV administration in subjects with NHL.  Mean concentration of drug at steady 
state values increased dose -proportion ally over the dose range tested.  The estimated 
mean clearance, volume of distribution, and terminal half -life were 2.29 L/hour, 
4.84 Land 2.47 hours, respectively, in subjects with NHL (Study MT103 -104
[Goebeler etal,2016 ]).  Since body size (weight or body surface area [BSA]) was not a 
factor affecting the blinatumomab PK, a fixed dosing regimen, instead of BSA based 
Approved  
  
Product:  Blinatumomab

Date:  25 February 2019 Page 21of 113
CONFIDENTIALdosing, is appropriate for the treatment in adults.  The fixed dosing regimen has been 
tested in Study MT103 -208(Viardot etal,2016 )in patients with diffuse large B -cell 
lymphoma and showed comparable exposure levels as those with an equivalent BSA 
based regimen.
2.4 Rationale
The effect of blinatumomab in the treatment of NHL was tested in a dose escalation 
study ( Study MT103 -104[Goebel er et al, 2016] ).  A dose dependent clinical response 
was observed and objective clinical responses were seen starting at 
15μg/m2 /d(28g/day) and peaked at 60 μg/m2/d ( 112 g/day).  Due to transient 
cytokine release after initiation of treatment, a st ep-dosing regimen was implemented to 
minimize cytokine related adverse events.  An effective step -dose regimen of 9 g/d 
(wee k1)-28g/d (week 2) -112 g/d (remaining weeks) following cIV infusion for 
8weeks was established for the treatment of diffuse la rge B -cell lymphoma in 
study MT103 -208(Viardot et al, 2016) .  In this study, the blinatumomab concentration 
levels following the cIV regimen will be used as a reference to guide dose selection of 
SC administration.  The target SC dose for the treatment of NHL is a dose that can 
achieve a similar exposure ( area under the curve ) as that of 112 g/d dose under cIV.  
To facilitate the SC dose selection, PK simulation was performed with the PK 
parameters (clearance and volume of distribution) generated from human studies under 
cIV and an assumed bioavailability of 0.25 in humans which was an approximate 
average of bioavailability in mouse (0.35), rat (0.16), monkey (0.21) and pig (0.30) under 
SC administration.  
The simulated PK profiles of cIV (9/28/112 g/d) and SC every day (112/450 ) and 
twice a day ([ BID] 56/225 g/dose ) are provided in Figure 3. Based on currently 
available information on bioavailability and exposure, 450 (or 225 g/BID) is the 
estimate d SC equivalent dose to the cIV 112 g/d dose.
The assumption will be examined in Period 1 of this study following the PK assessment 
in the cIV run -in phase and then SC administration.  
The calculated bioavailability for SC administration, the PK profiles of SC as well as 
safety and tolerability data will be used to assess the doses recommended for the 
Period 2 of the study.

2.5 Immunogenicity
Anti-blinatumomab antibodies (ADA) have been detected in a very limited number of 
adult patients with relapsed or refractory ALL treated with blinatumomab via cIV.  No 
anti-blinatumomab antibodies have been detected in subjects with NHL under cIV.  The 
incidence of anti-blinatumomab antibodies with SC administration will be examined in 
this study.  
2.6 Rationale for SC vs cIV Route of Administration
The SC delivery could simplify administration and improve convenience, and has been 
assessed for rituximab, velt uzumab, trastuzumab, and alemtuzumab in various cancer 
settings ( Goldenberg ,et al,2010 ,Pivot ,et al,2013 ,Stilgenbauer ,et al, 2009 ,
Shpilberg ,et al,2013 ).  The SC delivery could also reduce the incidence of severe 
administration related reactions and costs ( De Cock ,et al,2013 ,Lundin ,et al,2002 ), as 
well as avoid the need for a central line, potentially decreasing the risk of infection.
2.7 Clinical Hypotheses
Blinatumomab administered through the SC route will demonstrate a tolerable 
safety- profil e with serum concentrations comparable to those for which efficacy was 
shown with cIV administration in subjects with indolent relapsed/refractory NHL .

The overall study design is described by study schema s in Figure 1andFigure 2at the 
end of the protocol synopsis section.
Approved

Protocol Number:  20140286

CONFIDENTIALThis is a global multi -center, Phase 1b open -label study investigating the safety and PK 
of blinatumomab administered subcutaneously for the treat ment of relapsed/refractory 
indolent NHL.  The SC administration of blinatumomab will be tested for the first time in 
humans.  
Approximately 30subjects’ evaluable for dose limiting toxicities (DLT )will be enrolled in 
Period 1 (6 evaluable subjects in each dose -cohort).  The focus of this period is to 
determine the PK, bioavailability, and safety profile of blinatumomab SC administration.  
The PK and bioavailability data from Period 1 of the study will be used in conjunction 
with safety data (DLT) to determine the SC MTD.  The MTD or the maximum tested 
dose, if MTD is not reached, will be further tested in Period 2 in an expanded cohort of 
up to 15 additional evaluable subjects .  Efficacy of blinatumomab administered 
subcutaneou sly will also be investigated in each period of the study.
3.1.1 Cycle 1/Period 1
In Period 1, 3 or more separate dose cohorts of up to 6 DLT evaluable subjects each 
will be enrolled .  Subjects will undergo an initial cIV blinatumomab run -in period 
(weeks 1 to 3 ) followed by a 12-hour treatment free period, and then receive 
SCadministration (week 4) .  After a treatment free period of 2 to not more than 
3days, subjects receive cIV treatment to complete 6 weeks of therapy (weeks 5to 6)
Figure 1.  
For all cohorts, the initial cIV dose of blinatumomab will be 9 μg/day for the first 7 days 
(to mitigate for potential cytokine release syndrome [CRS ] and neurologic events 
associated with introduction to blinatumomab) which then will be escalated (dose -step) 
to 28 μg/day starting on day 8 through day 14 (week 2), and to 112 μg/day starting on 
day 15 until day 2 1 (week 3). 
After stopping cIV blinatumomab, t here is a12-hour treatment free period b efore 
starting SC blinatumomab.
SC blinatumomab starts after the 12 -hour treatment free period and will be 
administered (week 4) as the following dose -cohort levels:  
Dose Cohort 1: 112 μg q12h ×5 days (n 6)for a total of 9 doses
Dose Cohort 2:  225 μg q12h ×5 days (n 6)for a total of 9 doses
(Note:  A total of 9 SC doses will be given for the q12h dosing, so intensive PK 
samples can be obtained on day shift to reduce errors )

CONFIDENTIALDose Cohort 3: 450 μg q24h × 5 days (n = 6) for a total of 5 doses
Additional Dose Cohorts: Dose level and dosing frequency to be 
determined as described below
One or more dosing regimens may be selected based on clinical findings 
including safety, tolerability, and PK results from previous cohorts; after DLRT 
review, the DLRT may make recommendations for the next SC cohort dose and 
frequency. The dose may be in creased (by 1dose level or between the dose of
the previous cohort and the next higher dosing level in Figure 1schema) , kept at 
the same dose level or decre ased by 1or more dose levels.  T he dose frequency 
chosen (q12h, q24h, q48h, q72h, q96h, or q7 days) will be decided by the DLRT 
and will be based on the previous cohort PK data (refer to dosing schema 
Figure 1).
Once the SC dosing is complete, a treatment free period of 2 to not more than 
3days between stopping SC and restarting cIV will be observed. Then the cIV 
blinatumomab dosing will resume at 112 μg/day (weeks 5 to 6) to complete 
6weeks of treatment .
For each SCdose cohort, if 1 of the 6 DLT evaluable subjects experience a DLT 
during the SC administration DLT evaluation period then the dose will be determined to 
be tolerable and the DLRT will decide the next dose level tobe initiated and the 
frequency of administration for the next cohort ; see Section 6.2.1.2.2 for definition of 
the DLT evaluation period .
For each SC dose cohort , if 2 of the 6 evaluable subjects experience a DLT during the 
SC administration then dosing will stop for individual subjects who experience a DLT , a 
DLRT meeting will be conducted ,and further steps will be determined , such as dose 
de-escalation or increasing dosing interval (Figure 1). In addition, if subjects on 
this cohort have not reached the SC dosing, they will be allowed to stay on study 
but will finish cycle 1/period 1 as cIV.
MTD will be defined as the highest dose level at which 1 of 6 subjects experience a 
DLT.  If no subject experiences a DLT, the MTD will be defined as the maximal dose 
tested.

maximum tested dose, if MTD has not been reached, for additional safety and 
preliminary efficacy data in an expanded cohort of up to 15 evaluable subjects receiving 
SC treatment only (no cIV run- in) Figure 2 .  
Doses for Cycle 1/ Period 2 will be derived based on PK, bioavailability, and safety data 
collected in Cycle 1/ Period 1 and DLRT review and recommendations.   Subjects will 
receive the estimated SC  equivalent  doses  of the 2 lower cIV doses as given in the 
cIV blinatumomab run -in period sequentially:   2 doses of the equivalent SC dose 
to 9 µg/day of cIV during week 1, 3 doses of the equivalent SC dose to 28 μg/day 
cIV starting in week 1 and continuing into week 2, and then the SC MTD (or the maximum tested dose if MTD is not reached) and SC dosing interval as determined in Cycle  1/Period 1 starting in week 2 (day 12) and continuing to 
complete a total of 6 weeks of blinatumomab.   See Section 6.2.1.2.2  for definition 
of the DLT evaluation period for Period 2 . 
Continuous toxicity monitoring for early termination of the trial in Cycle 1/Period 2 
will be performed.  Termination of Cycle 1/Period 2 will occur if the posterior 
probability that the DLT rate is greater than 25 % given the cumulative data thus far 
is at least 80 %. 
The study endpoints are defined in Se ction  10.1.1  and stopping rules are detailed in 
Section 10.2. 
3.2 Numb er of Sites  
The study will be conducted at approximately 15 to 20 sites in the United States (US) , 
Europe, and Australia.  
Sites that do not enroll subjects into an open cohort within 6 months  of site initiation may 
be closed.   
3.3 Number of Subjects  
Participants in this clinical investigation shall be referred to as “subjects”.  
Approximately 54 subjects will be enrolled in this study  in order to ensure 
approximately  30 evaluable subjects in Period 1 and up to 15  evaluable subjects in 
Period 2 are treated with blinatumomab.  It is expected that approximately 20% of 
subjects will discontinue the study prematurely (ie, due to adverse event, subject request, requirement for alternative therapy) during the cIV run- in period

3.4 Replacement  of Subjects 
Subjects enrolled may be replaced if they are not evaluable for DLT during the DLT 
observation period as described in Section 6.2.1.2.2. 
3.4.1  Replacement Rules in Cycle 1/Period 1  
Subject s may be replaced for any of the following reasons:  
• failing to complete all 3 cIV dosing levels during cIV run- in (weeks 1 to 3)  
• failure to recei ve all doses (q48h, q72h, q96h, or q7d dosing), at least 4 of the 
5 doses (q24h dosing) , or at least  8 of 9 doses (q12h dosing)  during the SC 
treatment period (week 4)  
• withdrawal from study for DLT without having had PK assessments (subjects who 
withdraw due to DLT are evaluable from a safety standpoint, but may not be 
evaluable from a PK standpoint if they have not completed their PK blood draws)  
• subjects may be replaced if they miss the PK assessment time point and are unable 
to resume  dosing and PK asses sments  
o Note:   Subjects who miss a dose before any PK assessments will default to 
the day of the missed dose.  PK assessments will be performed per Table 4  
following the subject´s resumed dose of investigational product ( IP).  For 
example, if a subject misses the dose on study day 2, the restart treatment day will be considered as study day 2 and all applicable assessments will be done per Schedule of Assessments (refer to Table 3  and Table 4  for further 
details)  
• for all subjects who miss PK samples, the PK scientist will evaluate the PK results for 
this subject, and determine if t he subject needs to be replaced, or if the PK results 
are sufficient for analysis.  The DLRT will be informed of this decision to replace or 
not replace individual subjects at the time of the DLRT meeting.  
o subjects who do not complete PK assessments may continue on study, even if replaced 
3.4.2  Replacement Rules in Cycle 1/Period 2  
Subject s may be replaced for any of the following reasons  (except subjects removed for 
DLT that will never be replaced) : 
• failure to receive at least 85% of the  first 8  planned doses during the SC 
treatment period as outlined in Table 6  (this would include 5 doses of step 
dose run- in and 3 doses at MTD)

CONFIDENTIALThe dosing schedule is described by study schemas in Figure 1andFigure 2at the end 
of the protocol synopsis s ection.
6.2.1.1.1 Cycle 1/ Period 1
Cycle 1 /Period 1 will consist of blinatumomab administered as a cIV infusion for 21 days 
(weeks 1 to 3) of treatment and in addition, any number of days required to bridge cIV 
dosing so that SC dosing begins on a Monday (unless the study site can administer SC 
injections on the weekend)
, followed by a 12-hour treatment free period.
Thensubjects will receive SC dosing in week 4 followed by a treatment free period 
of 2 to not more than 3 days, and then subjects return to cIV administration for 
2weeks (weeks 5 to 6) to complete a total of 6 weeks of treatment .  
The initial dose of blinatumomab will be 9 μg/day cIV for the first 7 days (to mitigate for 
potential CRS and neurologic events associated with introduction to bli natumomab) and
then the dose will be escalated (dose -step) to 28 μg/day cIV starting on day 8 through 
day 14 (week 2), and to 112 μg/day cIV starting on day 15 through 21 (week 3).
If there are any interruptions in treatment that lead to the start day of SC dosing to be on 
a weekend day, then cIV dosing will be continued at the maximum dose and stopped 
12hours before starting the SC injections, which can commence on a Monday if not 
logistically feasible to administer SC injections on a weekend day.
After completion of the initial cIV blinatumomab run -in period, there is a treatment free 
period of 12 hours, then SC blinatumomab will be administered daily for 5 days 
(week 4) for dose cohort 1, 2, and 3.   The SC dose and frequency will be chosen by 
the DLRT for further cohorts (see Figure 1).  After completing SC dosing there is 
at least 2 days to not more than 3 days of no investigational product, followed by 
a return to investigational product at 112 μg/day cIV administration for 2 weeks 
(weeks 5 and 6) to complete a total of 6weeks of therapy .  (Note:  A total of 
9SCdoses wi ll be given for the q12h dosing ,so intensive PK samples can be obtained 
on day shift to reduce errors).
6.2.1.1.2 Cycle 1/ Period 2
Subjects will receive the estimated SC equivalent doses of the 2 lower cIV doses as 
given in the cIV blinatumomab run-in period sequentially: 2 doses of the equivalent 
SCdose to 9 g/day of cIV during week 1, 3 doses of the equivalent SC dose to 
28μg/day cIV starting in week 1 and continuing into week 2, and then the SC MTD

complete a total of 6 weeks of blinatumomab (Figure 2).
6.2.1.1.2.1 Special Case of SC Dosing Interruptions and Weekend Dose Holds
for Cycle 1/Period 1.
For dose cohorts 1 ,2,and 3 the SC administration of blinatumomab will occur over 
5days in Cycle 1/ Period 1.  If administration at a study site is feasible on weekends, 
then SC administration may commence any day of the week.  If weekend administration 
of blinatumomab at a study site is not feasible, then SC administration should 
commence on a Monday so that the fifth day of dosing can be given on a Friday.
In instances where there is a dose interruption during the SC administration , and the site 
does not have the ability to restart dosing on a weekend day, the subject should have 
the dose held over the weekend and resume dosing the next available weekday. 
Premedication dexamethasone will be given as per protocol after an interruption 
(Table 1) ofcIV and SC dosing.
6.2.1.1.3 Optional Cycle 2
Optional Cycle 2 for Period 1:  A subject may receive a second cycle of blinatumomab 
if, in the investigator`s opinion, the subject may derive benefit from the treatment.  The 
optional cycle 2 of blinatumomab will be dosed at 9 μg/day cIV for 7 days for days 1 
through day 7, next the dose will be escalated (dose -step) to 28 μg/day cIV for 7 days 
starting on day 8 through day 14, and then advanced to 112 μg/day cIV for 28 days 
starting on day 15 through day 42.  A treatment free interval of 14days will be observed 
after the completion of the first cycle of blinatumomab before starting the second cycle.
Optional Cycle 2 for Period 2:  A  subject may receive a second cycle of 
blinatumomab administered SC if the subject had clinical benefit on scans from 
treatment given SC in Cycle 1/P eriod 2 (Section 6.2.1.1.2 ).  
If no clinical benefit on scans after Cycle 1/ Period 2, then optional Cycle 2 is 
administered as a cIV infusion.  If cIV is used, blinatumomab will be dosed at 
9µg/day cIV for 7 days for days 1 through day 7, next the dose will be escalated 
(dose -step) to 28 µg/day cIV for 7 days starting on day 8 through day 14, and then 
advanced to 112 μg/day cIV for 28 days starting on day 15 through day 42.  A 
treatment free interval of 14 days will b e observed after the completion of the first 
cycle of blinatumomab before starting the second cycle.

CONFIDENTIAL6.2.1.1.4 Blinatumomab Inpatient Dosing
It is mandated in this study that subjects are hospitalized at least during the first 
72hours at the start of cIV infusion ( Cycle 1 /Period 1 ,Optional Cycle 2/Period 1 , and 
Optional Cycle 2/Period 2 if administered as a cIV infusion ) as well as after any 
additional dose -step.  Hospitalization is also required during the first 48 hours after the 
return to cIV infusion after the SC dosing in Cycle 1/ Period 1.  Subjects will remain 
hospitalized during the entire SC administration dosing in Cycle 1/ Period 1.  
In Cycle 1/Period 2, subjects are hospitalized:  For s ubjects 1 -5:  day 1 until 
completion of the second MTD dose PK being finished. Sites where outpatient PK 
cannot be obtained, for the third MTD SC dose, the subject needs to be 
hospitalized until completion of the third MTD dose PK.   Subjects 6 -15:  are 
ho
spitalized on days 1-8 (discharge 8 hours after day 8, 28 µg/day equivalent SC 
dose is administered) and readmitted to the hospital on day 12 (prior to first MTD 
SC dose) until 8 hours after the second MTD SC dose is administered.  Sites 
where outpatient P K cannot be obtained, for third 28 ug/day equivalent SC dose 
and third MTD SC dose, the subject needs to be hospitalized until completion of 
the third MTD dose PK.
In Optional Cycle 2/Period 2, if given SC subjects are hospitalized on days 1 -8 
(discharge 8 hours after day 8, 28 µg/day equivalent SC dose is administered) and 
readmitted to the hospital on day 12 (prior to first MTD SC dose) until 8 hours after 
the second MTD SC dose is administered.  The infusion bags will be changed (if IP is 
administered as a cIV infusion) and SC injections administered by trained site nursing 
personnel.  Close monitoring during the first 72 hours of treatment at each dose will be 
required because of the potential for adverse events.
6.2.1.1.5 Blinatumomab Outpatient Dosing and Home H ealth Care 
Administration for cIV and SC Dosing
If a subject is deemed stable by the investigator, the subject may continue blinatumomab 
(cIV[in all periods ]or SC administration [in Cycle 1/ Period 2 only ]) as an outpatient. 
In the outpatient setting, the subject will return to the study site or the subject will be 
visited by a well -trained home health care service provider at specific intervals to change 
the infusion bag or for administration of the SC injection , as applicabl e.  The subject and 
the home health care provider will receive written instructions for storage of the IV bags 
and/or blinatumomab for SC administration as applicable.

CONFIDENTIALThe home health care provider will be trained on study- specific requirements , recording
of source documentation , and completion of the study delegation log (authorized by the 
investigator) must be completed before any study -related tasks are started.  A 
comprehensive list of all home care services, including but not limited to the storage, 
handling, and administration of blinatumomab as well as mandatory procedural and data 
collection requirements will be provided in a home health care manual.  Following each 
visit, this information will be documented on the Ambulant/Home Care Services visit 
worksheet and forwarded to the investigator.  Any unexpected or unusual events as well 
as any deviations will be communicated promptly to the investigator.  In addition, the 
subject will visit the study site for assessments according to Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, 
Table 6, and Table 7.
In the event of drug interruptions refer to Section 6.2.1.4.1 .
In case of an adverse event occurring in the outpatient setting, the subject or the home 
health care service provider should contact the investigator immediately at the study 
center for furt her instruction on management and the investigator will assess the 
adverse event .
6.2.1.1.6 Overdose
The daily blinatumomab cIV dose may be up to 10 lower or higher in order to account 
for possible pump inaccuracies.  A dose of up to 10% higher than the intended do se 
may not require specific intervention. In case of overdose or medication error, the 
infusion should be immediately stopped. Consultation with the Amgen medical 
monitor is strongly recommended for prompt reporting of clinically apparent or 
laboratory a dverse events possibly related to overdose.  Routine supportive and 
symptomatic care according to standard medical practice is recommended.  Once 
the subject is stabilized and no clinically relevant safety findings due to 
blinatumomab are observed, resumpt ion of blinatumomab at a correct dose can 
be considered after consultation with the Amgen medical monitor.  
If the overdose results in an adverse event, the subject should be followed 
carefully until all signs of toxicity are resolved and the adverse even t(s) should be 
recorded/reported. If the overdose results in clinically apparent or symptomatic 
adverse events or additional adverse events, the subject should be followed carefully 
until all signs of toxicity are resolved and the adverse event/s should b e 
recorded/reported per Section 9.

CONFIDENTIAL    All available study data, including demographics, investigational product administration, 
medical history, concomitant medications, adverse events, vital signs, laboratory data, 
and PK/PD information will be reviewed.  In addition to DLTs, all ≥ grade 3 toxicities not 
meeting DLT criteria will be reviewed and may be considered in DLRT decisions.  
Source data and queries do not need to be resolved before the DLRT.  Continuous 
toxicity monitoring for early termination of the trial in Cycle 1/Period 2 will be performed.  
All adverse events  that occur during the DLT evaluation period will be reviewed and may 
be considered in DLRT decisions.  
6.2.1.2.2  Dose Limiting  Toxicity Rules 
Cycle 1/Period 1 
The DLT evaluation period includes  the entire week 4 (7 days) which is  the week that 
blinatumomab is administered SC during Cycle 1/ Period 1 of the study.  To be 
evaluable for a DLT, subjects must have experienced a DLT within the DLT evaluation 
period.   In addition, if the investigator and/or sponsor removes the subject from the study 
due to a treatment -related toxicity during the DLT evaluation period, regardless of the 
grade of toxicity, this will be considered a DLT.   If a subject does not experience a DLT 
during the DLT evaluation period and does not receive all doses (q48h, q72h, q96h, or 
q7d dosing), at least 4 of the 5 doses (q24h dosing) , or at least 8 of 9 doses 
(q12h dosing) of SC blinatumomab during Cycle 1/Period 1 of the study, the subject will 
not be considered DLT -evaluable and will be replaced as described in Section 3.4.1 . 
If ≤ 1 of the 6 evaluable subj ects in a dose SC cohort experience a DLT during the SC 
administration,  then the dose will be determined to be tolerable and the next dose- cohort  
level will be initiated in a new dose- cohort of subjects  after review by the DLRT .   
If ≥ 2 subjects of the 6 evaluable subjects  in a SC dose cohort experience a DLT during 
SC administration then dosing will stop  for individual subjects  who experience a DLT, a 
DLRT meeting will be conducted, and further steps will be determined.  
Additionally, the DLRT will meet:  
• once dose- cohort 1 has completed subcutaneous dosing  
• once dose- cohorts 2 and 3 have completed subcutaneous dosing  
• once any additional cohorts complete dosing if additional dose- cohorts are tested 
to determine the MTD in Cycle 1/ Period 1

CONFIDENTIALCycle 1/Period 2
For subject s who receive o ptional Cycle 2 after Cycle 1/Period 2 (SC dosing period), the 
DLT evaluation period includes the entire duration of SC administration in Cycle 1 and 
16 days following the last SC dose (56 days in total) or until the start of optional Cycle 2 , 
whichever is longer, up to 30 days after the last SC dose of Cycle 1 .
For subjects who do not receive o ptional Cycle 2, the DLT evaluation period includes the 
entire duration of SC administration and 30 days following the last SC dose (70 days in 
total).
Continuous monitoring for early termination of the trial will be performed (refer to 
Section 10.2).
6.2.1.2.3 Dose Limiting Toxicities
All toxicities will be graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE )version 4.0 (see Appendix D).  The occurrence of any of the following toxicities 
during the DLT evaluation period will be considered a DLT, if judged by the investigator 
to be related to the administration of blinatumom ab:
Any treatment -related death
Any treatment -related toxicity, regardless of grade, that leads to a subject’s removal 
from the study by the investigator and/or sponsor
Persistent CTCAE grade 2 non -hematologic adverse events related to 
blinatumomab that are deemed intolerable by the subject or the treating physician 
and that do not respond to appropriate medical management within 5 days and lead 
to treatment discontinuation will be considered DLTs
Recurrent grade 2 seizures ie, brief generalized seizures
All grade 3 and 4 adverse events and laboratory abnormalities, which occur during 
the SC administration portion of the treatment period and which, in the opinion of the 
investigator, are at least possibly related to the investigational drug, are considered
as DLT with exceptions noted below: 
oLaboratory parameters of grade 3 that responds to intervention/treatment 
interruption and resolves to grade 1 within 7 days
oGrade 3 and 4 lymphopenia
oGrade 3 fever or infection
oGrade 3 events of CRS ortumor lysis syndrome that responds to
intervention /treatment interruption and resolves to grade 1 within 7 days
oGrade 3 neurologic events that respond to intervention/treatment

should be performed in the hospital, under the supervision of the investigator.  The 
subject should be observed overnight f or possible side effects after the re -start of the cIV 
or SC IP , in the hospital.  Premedication dexamethasone should be administered as 
described in Table 1.
In the event of drug interruptions of 4 hours in the cIV infusion, or if 2 doses are 
missed in the q12h SC dosing schedule ora single missed dose in the q24h , q48h, 
q72h, q96h, or q7d SC dosing schedule, the restart of IP should be performed in the 
hospital under the supervision of the investigator, with premedication dexamethasone as 
described in Table 1.  The subject should be observed overnight for possible side effects 
after the re -start of thecIV or SC IP.
6.2.1.4.2 Interruption of Blinatumomab Treatment/Dose Modification Due to 
Adverse Events
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 4 non -laboratory 
adverse events at least possibly related to blinatumomab will require permanent 
discontinuation of blinatumomab.  For all CTCAE grade 3 laboratory events reflective 
of hepatoto xicity or CRS , refer to Sections 6.3and  Table 2, respectively, for specific 
guidance for the interruption and discontinuation of therapy .  Subjects who have been 
dose reduced will have an option to receive the higher dose level once th e adverse 
event has resolved to grade 1 or less for at least 7 days.  For interruptions or dose 
modifications because of neurologic events as defined in Appendix E(refer to Table 2).
If the interruption after an adverse event lasts no longer than 7 days, the same cycle 
should be continued.  An infusion interruption of more than 2 weeks because of an 
adverse event relate d to blinatumomab will lead to permanent discontinuation of 
treatment.  The infusion duration before and after an interruption should total 7 days at 
each dose level for cIV run -in and the SC treatment duration should be a total of 5 days 
for dose cohorts 1, 2, and 3or for any additional cohorts at the SC dose and 
frequency determined by the DLRT during week 4 in Cycle 1/P eriod 1.  For
Cycle 1/Period 2 after a treatment interruption, treatment will resume on the same 
treatment day of the week that it was originally interrupted on (eg, if there was in 
interruption on day 3 of a cycle, day 3 of the cycle will be repeated with all applicable 
assessments at re -start).
For cIV infusion of IP, t he lowest dose for restart is 9 μg/day if l ast dose given was 9 or 
28 μg/day.  The lowest dose for restart should be 28 μg/day cIV infusion if the last dose

CONFIDENTIALgiven was 112 μg/day cIV infusion .  Restart following a dose interruption for cIV infusion 
and S Cshould be performed in the hospital, under s upervision of the investigator and 
the subject should be hospitalized for 48hours.
For a grade ≥3 neurologic adverse event occurring at initial dosing of 9μg/day cIVin
Cycle1/Period 1 or 9 μg/day SC equivalent in Cycle 1/Period 2 , permanently 
discontinue blinatumomab.
Administer premedication as described in Table 1.  Thetreatment time for each of the 
treatmen tcycles is approximately 6weeks.
Restart cIV infusion should be performed with a 9/28/112 μg/day weekly dose escalation 
if last dose given was 9 or 28 μg/day.  If last dose given was 112 μg/day restart should 
be performed with a 28/112 μg/day dose escala tion (dose escalation 1week after 
restart).  
For SC dosing, the doses that have equivalent exposures to the cIV doses mentioned 
above should be used.
Restart and dose escalation for cIV infusion and SC should be performed in the hospital, 
under supervisi on of the investigator and the subject should be hospitalized for 48hours.
In addition, to the events described above, the dose may be temporarily or permanently 
reduced to 9 μg/day cIV infusion (or the equivalent SC dose) if, by the investigator´s 
judgment, it is necessary for safety reasons.  After at least 7 days of dosing at 9 μg/day
cIV infusion (or the equivalent SC dose), the dose may be increased to 28μg/day cIV 
infusion (or the equivalent SC dose) or treatment ma y be continued at the dose o f 
9μg/day cIV infusion ( or the equivalent SC dose) after consultation with an Amgen 
medical monitor.  Likewise, if an event occurred at a dose of 112 g/ day cIV infusion or 
the SC MTD, the dose may be temporarily or permanently reduced to 28 μg/day cIV 
infusion (or the equivalent SC dose) and may be increased to 112 g/day cIV infusion
(or SC MTD) following the same guidance as described above.  This does not apply for 
neurologic events (refer to Table 2).

6.3.2 Criteria for Conditional Withholding of Blinatumomab and Oth er 
Protocol -required Therapies D ue to Potential Hepatotoxicity
For subjects who do not meet the criteria for permanent discontinuation of blinatumomab 
outlined above and have no underlying liver disease, and e ligibility criteria requiring 
normal transaminases and TBL at baseline or subjects with underlying liver disease and 
baseline abnormal transaminases, the following rules are recommended for withholding 
of blinatumomab and other protocol -required therapies:
Elevation of either AST or ALT according to the following schedule:
Baseline AST or ALT v alue AST or ALT elevation 
Any 8 ×ULN at any time
Any 5 ×ULN but 8 ×ULN f or 2 weeks
Any 5 ×ULN but 8 ×ULN and unable to adhere to 
enhanced monitoring schedule
Any 3 ×ULN with clinical signs or symptoms that are 
consistent with hepatitis (such as right upper quadrant 
pain/tenderness, fever, nausea, v omiting, jaundice).  
OR: TBL 3 ×ULN at any time
OR: ALP 8 ×ULN at any time
Blinatumomab and other protocol -required therapies, as appropriate should be withheld 
pending investigation into alternative causes of DILI.  If IP is withheld, the subject is to 
be followed according to recommendations in Appendix Dfor possible DILI.  
Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause for impaired liver tests (ALT, 
AST, ALP) and/or elevated TBL, is discovered and the laboratory abnormalities resolve 
to normal or baseline ( Section 6.3.3 ).
6.3.3 Criteria for Rechallenge of Blinatumomab and Other 
Protocol -required Therapies After Potential Hepatotoxicity
If signs or symptoms recur with rechallenge, then blinatumomab and other 
protocol -required therapies, as appropriate, should be permanently discontinued.  
Subjects who clearly meet the criteria for permanent discontinuation (as described in 
Section 6.2.1.4.3 ) should never be rechallenged.

CONFIDENTIAL6.4 Concomitant Therapy
Throughout the study, investigator s may prescribe any concomitant medications or 
treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care except for those 
listed in Section 6.8.
For concomitant therapies being taken for NHL and that assist in the evaluation of 
efficacy or safety endpoints, collect therapy name, indication, dose, unit, frequency, start 
date and stop date. 
For all other concomitant therapies, collect therapy name, indication, dose, unit, 
frequency, route, start date and stop date.  
All treatments that the investigator consi ders necessary for a subject’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the community 
standards of medical care.  All concomitant medication will be recorded on the CRF 
including all prescription, over -the-counter, herbal supplements, and IV medications and 
fluids.  Concomitant therapies are to be collected from signing of the informed consent 
form through the safety follow -up period.  For therapies used for the treatment of 
lymphoma, all data for medications and tre atments will be recorded from the time of 
diagnosis of the lymphoma, not the signing of the informed consent form .  If changes 
occur during the study period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date 
may also be included on the CRF.
6.5 Other Tr eatment Procedures
6.5.1 Fever Management
Fevers may be managed per local clinical standard of care.  For symptomatic relief of 
fevers due to any cause (eg, infection, drug fever) the recommended first choices for 
fever management are paracetamol/acetaminophen a nd/or dexamethasone.  The 
dexamethasone dose should be reduced step -wise as soon as the fever is resolved.  If 
these are not sufficiently effective, pethidin/meperidine is recommended.  For 
pethidin/meperidine, adequate antiemetic prophylaxis should be adm inistered.  The 
treating physician should also use their clinical judgment to determine the underlying 
cause of the fever and treatment.  For instance, in the case of fever due to infection one 
should consider the use of antibiotics and avoid the use of de xamethasone.

radiated field.  
6.9 Contraceptive Requirements
6.9.1 Female Subjects
A female is considered of childbearing potential unless she has undergone a
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or is postmenopausal.  
Postmenopausal is defined as:   
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause.  (A high follicle stimulating hormone level in the 
postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in 
women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy 
[HRT].  However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single follicle 
stimulating hormone meas urement is insufficient).
Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to 
use one of the non -hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish 
to continue their HRT during the study.  Otherwise, they must discontinue H RT to 
allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.
Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to practice sexual abstinence or 
use an acceptable method of effective contraception during the treatment and for an 
additional 48 hours after the last dose of cIV or 96hours after the last dose of SC 
blinatumomab.  
Acceptable methods of contraception include:  
Combined (estrogen and progestogen) or Progestogen -only hormonal methods 
given via oral, intravaginal, transdermal, injectable, or implantable route
Intrauterine device (IUD)
Intrauterine hormonal -releasing system (IUS)
Bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion
Vasectomized partner (Provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the 
female subject of childbearing potential and that the vasectomized partner has 
received medical assessment of the surgical success)
Approved  
  
Product:  Blinatumomab
Protocol Number:  20140286
Date:  25 February 2019 Page 53of 113
CONFIDENTIALSexual abstinence (Defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during 
the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments.  The reliability of 
sexual abstinence must be evaluated in relation to the duration of the trial and 
the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject .)
Double barrier method:  the male uses a condom and the female may choose 
either a cervical cap, diaphragm, or contraceptive s ponge with spermicide 
(Afemale condom is not an option due to the risk of tearing when both partners 
use a condom.)
Female subjects of childbearing potential must receive pregnancy prevention counseling 
and be advised of the risk to fetus if they become p regnant during treatment and foran 
additional 48 hours after the last dose of cIV blinatumomab or 96hours after the last 
dose of SC blinatumomab .
Additional medications given during treatment with blinatumomab may alter the 
contraceptive requirements.  These additional medications may require female subjects 
use highly effective methods of contraception and for an increased length of time.  In 
addition, male subjects may also be required to use contraception.  The investigator is to 
discuss these contrac eptive changes with the subject.
If a female subject is suspected of being pregnant, the protocol -required therapies must 
be stopped immediately and may not be resumed until absence of pregnancy has been 
medically confirmed.  
6.9.2 Unacceptable Methods of Birth Control for Women Subjects
Birth control methods that are considered unacceptable in clinical trials include:  periodic 
abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus 
interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenor rhea method.

CONFIDENTIALeHospitalization in Period 2: For subjects 1 -5:  day 1 until completion of the second MTD dose PK being finished.  Sites where outpatient PK cannot be obtained, for third MTD  
SC dose, the subject needs to be hospitalized until completion of the third MTD  dose PK.  Subjects 6 -15:  are hospitalized on days 1 -8 (discharge 8 hours after day 8, 
28µg/day SC dose is administered) and readmitted to the hospital on day 12 (prior t o first MTD SC dose) until 8 hours after the second MTD SC dose is administered.  Sites 
where outpatient PK cannot be obtained, for third 28 µg/day equivalent SC dose and third MTD  SC dose, the subject needs to be hospitalized until completion of the third
MTD dose PK.
fThe investigator should monitor the subject's vital signs continuously every 4 hours ( 2 hours) during the first 12 hours after the start of each new treatment/dose -step. Subject must be in 
a supine position in a rested and calm state for at least 5 minutes before blood pressure assessments are conducted.  If the subject is unable to be in the supine position, t he subject 
should be in most recumbent position possible.  The position selected for a subject should be the same throughout the s tudy.  Vital sign measurements will be repeated daily during the 
subject's hospitalization.
gSerious adverse events are collected from the time of signing informed consent form to the end of study and adverse events ar e collected after the first dose of I P.
hSerum or urine pregnancy test will be performed for all women subjects unless surgically sterile or 2 years postmenopausal.  Additional pregnancy testing may be performed at the 
investigator’s discretion or as required per local laws and regulations.
ICoagulation will include PTT, INR ,and fibrinogen. 
jLumbar puncture is only needed for disease assessment per standard of care per investigator.  Lumbar puncture should be obtai ned for evaluation of seizures that occur during 
blinatumomab treatment , if clinically stable, and a sample sent for blinatumomab PK .
kDisease assessments are to be performed as to establish staging and response per Cheson (Appendix A) and Lugano criteria (Appendix B).  For PET-CT, CT, or contrast enhanced CT 
the same imaging modality should be used throughout the study for an individual subject.   Disease assessment to occur: during screening; just prior to optional cycle 2 if given (attempt 
to obtain this study at least 2 weeks after stopping IP in cycle 1 and just prior to starting cycle 2); and the last disease assessment is 4 weeks after finishing the last dose of IP. If PET and 
CT are acquired on the same day, it is strongly recommended that PET is performed prior to the CT with IV contrast. 
lBone marrow biopsy to be performed according to Cheson (Appendix A) and Lugano criteria (Appendix B[standard o f care per investigator ]).
mBone marrow assessment performed within 21 days of the first dose of IP may be used in place of screening assessment to establish staging or response per Cheson (Appendix A) and 
Lugano criteria (Appendix B).

CONFIDENTIAL7.2 General Study Procedures
A description for each phase of the study is provided in this section.  Refer to the CRF 
completion guidelines for data collection requirements and documentation of study 
assessments/procedures.
Confirmation that the most current IRB /IEC approved written informed consent form has 
been signed should occur before any study- specific procedures are performed .  All 
subjects who are enrolled and receive blinatumomab or undergo st udy-specific 
procedures should be reconsented with any updated versions of IRB /IEC approved 
informed consents during study participation as applicable and per institutional 
guidelines.
7.2.1 Screening Enrollment and/or Randomization
Informed consent must be obta ined before completing any study -specific 
procedures. Procedures that are part of standard of care are not considered 
study -specific procedures and may be performed before the informed consent and used 
to determine eligibility, but must be done within 2 w eeks to treatment start (unless 
specified otherwise), as described in the eligibility criteria. 
After written informed consent has been obtained, subjects will be screened to assess 
eligib ility for study participation.  The screening period is up to 14 da ys.If a subject has 
not met all eligibility criteria at the end of the 14 -day window, the subject will be 
registered as a screen failure. Subjects who screen fail may be eligible to rescreen 
3additional times per Section 7.2.2 .
All screening procedures except PET- CT,CT, and bone marrow biopsy must be 
performed within 14 days of day 1 (equals start of treatment with study drug), unless 
otherwise noted.  PET -CT, CT, and bone marrow biopsy assessments can be done 
within 21 days of the first dose of IP .  Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be 
eligible to be enrolled in the study.
7.2.2 Rescreening
Subjects who are unable to complete or meet eligibility at the initial screening will be 
permitted to rescreen up to 3 additional times, provided study recruitment has not 
closed. Upon signing a ne w informed consent form , a new 14 -day screening window will 
begin. Subjects will retain the same subject identification number assigned at the 
original screening.

CONFIDENTIALAfter reconsenting, all screening procedures, excluding PET-CT, CT, and bone marrow 
biopsy ,must be repeated unless the procedure was performed within 2 weeks before 
thetreatment start.  The PET-CT, CT, and bone marrow biopsy need to be performed 
within 21 days of the first dose of IP prior to treatment start .
7.2.3 Treatment
Procedures will be completed during the treatment period from  each treatment cycle 
(day 1 to day 43 of Cycle 1/Period 1 , day 1 to day 43Cycle 1/Period 2, and day 1 to 
day43 of cycle 2) at the times designated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 3,
Table 4,Table 5,Table 6,and Table 7).
Subjects satisfying eligibility requirements will be enrolled into the treatment period and 
should receive the first dose of blinatumomab on day 1 of the study.  All subsequent 
study visits will be scheduled based on the day 1 date.  
7.2.4 Safety Follow -up Visit (s)/End of Study Visit
Approximately 30 days ( 7 days) after their last dose of blinatumomab, subjects will 
complete a EOS/safety follow -up visit (Table 3, Table 5, and Table 7).  If hematopoietic 
stem cell transplant (HSCT )or any other non-protocol specified anti -tumor therapy will 
be administered after blinatumomab, the end of study visit should be cond ucted before 
these alternative treatments are administered .
7.2.5 Early Termination Visit
If a subject withdraws informed consent from the study, safety follow -up procedures 
should be conducted immediately if possible ( Table 3,Table 5, and Table 7).

CONFIDENTIALThe following measurements for vital signs must be performed: systolic/diastolic blood 
pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature.  The investigator should monitor 
the subject's vital signs continuously every 4 hours ( 2 hours) during the first 12 hours 
after the star t of each new treatment/dose -step.  Vital sign measurements will be 
repeated daily during the subject's hospitalization.  Subject must be in a supine position 
in a rested and calm state for at least 5 minutes before blood pressure assessments are 
conducted .  If the subject is unable to be in the supine position, the subject should be in 
most recumbent position possible.  The position selected for a subject should be the 
same throughout the study and documented on the vital signs CRF.  The temperature 
locati on selected for a subject should be the same throughout the study and 
documented on the vital signs CRF.  If abnormalities are found and they are considered 
an adverse event, record on the adverse event summary page.
7.3.8 Neurological Examination
A neurological examination will be performed as outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments (Table 3, Table 5, and Table 7).  Subjects will be specifically queried for 
neurological symptoms observed in the interval since the last extended neurological 
examination. Abnormalities of the following should be recorded: level of consciousness, 
orientation, vision, cranial nerves and brain stem functions, pyramidal and extra 
pyramidal motor system, reflexes, muscle tone and trophic findings, coordination, 
sensory system, neuropsychological findings (eg, speech, cognition and emotion).  If 
they are present at screening, then they will be considered as medical history.  Any new 
findings on neurologic examination during the study will be considered adverse events.
7.3.9 Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events / Disease Related Events
Adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject will be collected 
at all study visits starting with the first IP administration.
Serious adverse events are collected from the time of signing the informed consent form 
to the end of the study. 
Disease Related E vents are events (serious or non -serious) anticipated to occur in the 
study population due to the underlying disease ( Table 9).  Refer to Section 9.1.1 for 
further information.

Follow -up visit (2 to 4weeks after the end of therapy for cycle 1). In the case where a 
second cycle is administered, the assessment has to be done prior to the start of the 
next cycle to assess the evolution of disease (as close to 2 weeks after the last dose of 
IP cycle 1, but before starting cycle 2).   Additional PET- CT or CT follow up following the 
optional second cycle of treatment should be performed during the Safety Follow -upvisit 
(2 to 4weeks after the end of therapy for cycle 2) .  The same imaging m odality should 
be used throughout the study for an individual subject. 
If PET and CT are acquired on the same day, it is strongly recommended that PET is 
performed prior to the CT with IV contrast.
7.3.11 Magnetic Resonance Image
Magnetic Resonance Image Scan of the brain with contrast is recommended as part of 
the evaluation of the etiology of a grade 3 seizure or neurologic event that occurs 
during IP infusion. The magnetic resonance image is obtained if there are no 
contraindications to the procedure.
7.3.12 Bone Marrow Biopsy
Bone marrow biopsies should be performed within 21 days of start of IP treatment and 
3to 4 weeks after the end of treatment (may occur with the Safety Follow -up visit), if 
required for staging or response assessment .  Bone marrow biopsies ar e recommended 
to be unilateral and the samples must be 2.5 cm (total biopsy length) as per standard 
of care if required for staging and for evaluation of disease response/progression .

Any blood biomarker , PK sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 3, Table 4,Table 5,Table 6,and Table 7) can be analyzed for any of th e tests 
outlined in the protocol and for any tests necessary to minimize risks to study subjects.  
This includes testing to ensure analytical methods produce reliable and valid data
throughout the course of the study .  This can also include, but is not limited to, 
investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample reanalysis, and analyses for 
method transfer and comparability. 
All samples and associated resu lts will be coded before the being shipped from the site 
for analysis or storage.  Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is assigned 
to the samples for the study.  Results are stored in a secure datab ase to ensure 
confidentiality.
If infor med consent is provided by the subject, Amgen may do additional testing on 
remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and better understand the 
relapsed/refractory indolent NHL,the dose response and/or prediction of response to 
blinatumom ab, as required, characterize antibody response, and characterize aspects of 
the molecule (eg, mechanism of action/target, metabolites).  Results from this analysis 
are to be documented and maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this 
study .  Samples can b e retained for up to 20 years.
Since the evaluations are not expected to benefit the subject directly or to alter the 
treatment course, the results of pharmacogenetic , biomarker development, or other 
exploratory studies are not placed in th e subject’s medical record and are not to be 
made available to the subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other 
third parties, except as specified in the informed consent.
The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by 
contacting the investigator .  Following the request from the subject, the investigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and subject identification number so that any 
remaining sample types (eg, blood, tumor) samples and any other components from the 
cells can be located and destroyed. Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined 
procedure s are completed. However, information collected from samples before the
request for destruction, will be retained by Amgen.

8. WITHDRAWAL FROM TREA TMENT, PROCEDURES, AND STUDY
8.1 Subject s’Decision to Withdraw
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason 
without prejudice to their future medical care by the physician or at the institution.
Subjects (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving 
investigational product and/or other protocol -required therapies or procedures at any 
time during the study but continue participation in the study .  A legally acceptable 
representative is an individual or other body authorized under applicable law to consent , 
on behalf of a prospective subject, to the subject’s participation in the clinical study.   If 
this occurs, the investigator is to discuss with the subject the appropriate processes for 
discontinuation from investigational product , device or other protoco l-required therapies 
and must discuss with the subject t he options for continuation of the S chedule of 
Assessments (Table 3,Table 4,Table 5,Table 6,and Table 7) and collection of data, 
including endpoints , adverse events, disease related events ,and device related events, 
as applicable .  The investigator must document the change to the Schedule of 
Assessments (Table 3,Table 4,Table 5, Table 6, and Table 7)and the level of 
follow -up that is agreed to by the subject ( eg, in person, by telephone/mail, through 
family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other physicians, from review of 
the medical records ).  
Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive 
further protocol -required therapies or procedures ,and the subject does not wish to or is 
unable to continue further study participation .  Subject data up to withdrawal of consent 
will be included in the analysis of the study ,and where permitted, publicly available data 
can be included after withdrawal of consent.  The investigator is to discuss with the 
subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study.

9. SAFETY DA TA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING
9.1 Definition of Safety Events
9.1.1 Disease Related Events
Disease Related Events are events (serious or non -serious) anticipated to occur in the 
study population due to the underlying disease eg, disease progression (Table 9).  Such 
events do not meet the definition of an adverse event unless assessed to be more 
severe than expected for the subject’s condition.  
Disease Related Events that do not qualify as Adverse Events or Serious Adverse 
Events: 
An event which is part of the normal course of disease under study (eg, disease 
progression in oncology or hospitalization due to disease progression) is to be 
reported as a Disease Related Event. 
Death due to the disease under study is to be recorded on the event CRF.
If the outcome of the underlying disease is worse than that which would normally be 
expected for the subject, or if the investigator believes there is a causal relationship 
between the IP(s)/study treatment protocol required therapies and di sease worsening, 
this must be reported as an adverse event or a serious adverse event.  Table 9outlines 
the expected Disease -Related Events by System Organ Class .

CONFIDENTIALDisease Related Events that would qualify as an Adverse Event or Serious Adverse 
Event:
Anevent based on t he underlying disease that is worse than expected as 
assessed by the investigator for the subject’s condition or if the investigator
believes there is a causal relationship between the investigational 
product(s)/study treatment /protocol -required therapies and disease worsening, 
this must be reported as a n Adverse Event or Serious Adverse Event.
9.1.2 Adverse Events
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial 
subject.  The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment.  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by the 
investigator or reported by the subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record.  
The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pr e-existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition or underlying disease 
(eg,diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or 
duration more than would be expected , and/or has an association with a significantly 
worse outcome than expected .  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened more 
than anticipated (ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease) during the study or involves 
an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study ,
is not considered an adverse event.  
If the severity of an adverse event changes from the date of onset to the date of 
resolution, record as a single event with the worst severity on the Event CRF.
For situations whe n an adverse event or serious adverse event is due to the underlying 
lymphoma, report all known signs and symptoms.  Death due to disease progression in 
the absence of signs and symptoms should be reported as the primary tumor type 
(eg,relapsed/refractory indolent NHL).
Note:  The term “disease progression” should not be used to describe the disease 
related event or adverse event.  
An adverse device effect is any adverse event related to the use of a medical device.  
Adverse device effects include adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use, adverse events resulting from any malfunction of the device, or 
adverse events resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the device.

9.1.3 Serious A dverse Events
A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the 
following serious criteria (unless it meets the definition of a Disease Related Event as 
defined in Section 9.1.1 ):
fatal
life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)
requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
congenital anomaly/birth defect
other medically important serious event
A disease related event blood and lymphatic system disorders or investigations areto be 
reported as a serious adverse event if :
the subject’s pre -existing condition becomes worse than what the investigator would 
consider typical for a patient with the same underlying condition, or
if the investigator believes a causal relationship exists between the investigational 
medicinal product(s)/protocol -required therapies and the event , 
and the event meets at least 1 of the serious criteria.
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization”, if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).  
If an investigator conside rs an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could 
include alle rgic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI (see Appendix Dfor 
drug-induced liver injury reporting criteria) , or events that necessitate an emergency 
room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.
9.2 Safety Event Reporting Procedures
9.2.1 Reporting Procedures for Disease Related Events
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all Disease Related Events observed by 
the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after the first dose of investigational

follow -up visit and are recorded on the Event CRF as a Disease R elated Event .  
Disease Related Events assessed by the investigator to be more severe than expected 
and/orrelated to the investigational medicinal prod uct(s)/study 
treatment/protocol -required therapies, and determined to be serious, must be recorded 
on the Event eCRF as Serious Adverse Events.  
Additionally, the investigator is required to report a fatal Disease Related Event on the 
Event eCRF.  
9.2.2 Adverse Events
9.2.2.1 Reporting Procedures for A dverse Events That do not Meet Serious 
Criteria
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by the 
investigator or reported by the subject that occur after first dose of IP through 30 days 
after the last dose of study treatment or the safety follow -up visit (whichever is later) are 
reported using the Event CRF.
The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:
Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms),
Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved) ,
Severity [and/ or toxicity per protocol],
Assessment of relatedness to blinatumomab or protocol required medication or 
medical device, and
Action taken.
If the severity of an adverse event changes from the date of onset to the date of 
resolution, record as a single event with the worst severity on the Adverse Event 
Summary CRF.
The adverse event grading scale used will be the Amgen adverse event standard 
grading score; CTCAE . The grading scale used in this study is described in
Appendix D.  
The investigator must assess whe ther the adverse event is possibly related to 
blinatumomab .  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the 
Investigational Medicinal Product?

CONFIDENTIALThe investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to any 
study -mandated activity (eg, administration of investigational product, protocol -required 
therapies, device (s)and/or procedure (including any screening procedure(s) ).  This 
relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  “Is there a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by a study activity
(eg,administration of investigational product, protocol -required therapies, device (s)), 
and/or procedure”?
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a change from the 
subject’s baseline values.  Laboratory value changes that require intervention 
(eg,treatment, hospitalization, or adjustment in current therapy) should be recorded as 
adverse events.  In addition, if signs or symptoms are associated with a laboratory 
abnormality, the signs/symptoms and the laboratory abnormality should al l be recorded 
as adverse events.  The laboratory abnormality and any signs/symptoms should be 
graded according to their own CTCAE criteria . 
9.2.2.2 Reporting Procedures for Serious A dverse Events
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adver se events observed by 
the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after signing of the informed
consent through the safety follow -up period 30 days after the last dose of 
protocol -specified therapies are recorded in the subject’s medical record and are 
submitted to Amgen.   All serious adverse events must be submitted to Amgen within 
24hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event via the Event CRF.   
If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the 
serious adverse event, the information is to be reported to Amgen via an electronic 
Serious Adverse Event (eSAE) Contingency Report Form within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s knowledge of the event .  See Appendix Ffor a sample of the Serious 
Adverse Event Worksheet/ eSAE Contingency Report Form.  
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is p ossibly related to 
the blinatumomab. This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the 
question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by 
blinatumomab ?
The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events until stabilization 
or reversibility.

submitted to Amgen .  All new information for serious adverse event s must be sent to 
Amgen within 24 hours following knowledge of the new information.  If specifically 
requested, t he investigator may need to provide additional follow -up information, such as 
discharge summar ies, medical records, or extracts from the medica l record s.  
Information provided about the serious adverse event must be consistent with that 
recorded on the Event CRF.
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapies because of a 
serious adverse event, this information must be sub mitted to Amgen.
Amgen will report serious adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and IRBs/IECs 
in compliance with all reporting requirements 
according to loca l regulations and good 
clinical practice .
The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/IEC of serious adverse events occurring 
at the site and other adverse event reports received from Amgen, in accordance with 
local regulatory requirement s and proce dures.
9.2.2.3 Reporting Serious A dverse Events A fter the Protocol -required 
Reporting Period
There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for serious adverse events following 
the protocol -required reporting period or after end of study.  However, these seriou s 
adverse events can be reported to Amgen.  In some countries (eg, European Union 
member states), investigators are required to report serious adverse events that they 
become aware of after end of study. If serious adverse events are reported, the 
investi gator is to report them to Amgen within 24 hours following the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event.
Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -required reporting period willbe
captured within the safety database as clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited 
reporting. 
9.3 Pregnancy and Lactation Reporting
If a female subject becomes pregnant, or a male subject fathers a child, while the 
subject is taking blinatumomab report the pregnancy to Amgen Global Patient Safety as

to obtain information regarding the birth outcome and health of the infant.  If a male 
subject's female partner becomes pregnant, the investigator should discuss obtaining 
information regarding the birth outcome and health of the infan t from the pregnant 
partner.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets a criterion for immediate classification as a
Serious Adverse Event (eg, female subject experiences a spontaneous abortion, 
stillbirth, or neonatal death or there is a fetal or neonatal c ongenital anomaly) the 
investigator will report the event as a Serious Adverse Event.
If a female breastfeeds while taking protocol -required therapies report the lactation case 
to Amgen as specified below. 
In addition to reporting a lactation case during the study, investigators should report 
lactation cases that occur 48 hours after the last dose of cIV blinatumomab or 96hours 
after the last dose of SC blinatumomab .
Anylactation case should be reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety within 24 hours of

10.1.2 Analysis Sets
The statistical analysis will be based on the following study populations.  Subjects will be 
summarized separately by the planned dose cohorts.
The analysis of all endpoints, unless noted otherwise, will be conducted on the Full 
Analysis Set.
The analysis of DLTs will be restricted to DLT -evaluable subjects.
10.1.2.1 Full Analysis Set
All subjects who receive blinatumomab are included in the full analysis set.  This 
definition is in line with the intent -to-treat principle in single -arm open -label studies.

All subjects who had cytokine and/or lymphocyte subset samples collected at any time 
during the study will be included in the PD analysis set.  
10.1.3  Covariates and Subgroups 
The relationship of the certain baseline covariates to endpoints will be explored if 
appropriate.  Biomarker data may be incorporated in additional exploratory subgroup or multivariate analyses.  The analyses of biomarkers may be performed after collection of all samples during the conduct of the study and therefore may be reported after the final 
analysis.  
10.2 Sample Size Considerations  
Approximately 54 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in the study.   
Six evaluable subjects will be enrolled at each SC dose level in Cycle 1/P eriod 1.  
Subjects may be replaced (replacement rules outlined in Section 3.4).  This sample size 
is based on  practical considerations and is consistent with convent ional 
phase 1 oncology studies.  If the true DLT rate is 10% , there is an 89% probability of 
observing ≤ 1 DLT and 11 % probability of observing 2 or more DLT in 6 subjects.   If the 
true DLT rate is 30% , the probability of observing ≤ 1 DLT decreases to 42 % and 
probability of observing 2 or more DLT increases to 58% .  
Up to 15  evaluable subjects will be enrolled into Cycle 1/Period 2 with the planned target 
treatment dose being the highest tolerable dos e regimen or highest tested dose regimen 
based on DLRT’s recommendations.  Continuous toxicity monitoring for early termination 
of the trial in Cycle 1/Period 2 will be performed.  Termination of the study in Cycle 
1/Period 2 will occur if the posterior probability that the DLT rate greater than 25% , given 
the cumulative data thus far is at least 80%.  Starting with the fifth subject treated in 
Cycle 1/Period 2, stopping may occur any time.  The stopping boundaries assume a 
prior beta distribution of (0.50, 1.50) and a batch size of 1 (starting with the fifth  subject 
treated) are presented in Table 10 and the operating characteristics are given in 
Table 10.  The operating characteristics in Table  10 provide the probability of stopping 
the trial early for given hypothetical true DLT rates whereas the stopping criteria in 
Table 10 are based on situations where the empirical evidence would result in a 
posterior probability ≥ 80% that the true DLT rate is ≥ 25% (Thall et al, 1995).

The Clinica l Monitor is responsible for verifying the CRFs at regular intervals throughout 
the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency 
of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research.  The
Clinic al Mo nitor is to have access to subject medical records and other study- related 
records needed to verify the entries on the CRFs.
The investigator agrees to cooperate with the Clinical Monitor to ensure that any 
problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in 
completing CRFs, are resolved.
In accordance with ICH GCP and the sponsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected 
for audit by representatives from Amgen ’sGlobal Research & Development Compliance 
and Audit fu nction (or designees).  Inspection of site facilities (eg, pharmacy, 
protocol -required therap ystorage areas, laboratories) and review of study -related 
records will occur to evaluate the study conduct and compliance with the protocol, ICH 
GCP, and applicab le regulatory requirements.
Data capture for this study is planned to be electronic:
All source documentation supporting entries into the CRFs must be maintained 
and readily available.
Updates to CRFs will be automatically documented through the software’s “audit 
trail”.
To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data 
management review is performed on subject data received at Amgen.  During 
this review, subject data are checked for consistency, omissions, and any 
appare nt discrepancies.  In addition, the data arereviewed for adherence to the 
protocol and GCP.  To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data 
management review process, data queries are created in the EDC system 
database for site resolution and subsequently closed by the EDC system or by 
an Amgen reviewer.
The investigator signs only the Investigator Verification Form for this EDC study 
or the investigator applies an electronic signature in the EDC system if the study 
is set up to accept an electron ic signature .  This signature indicate sthat 
investigator inspected or reviewed the data on the CRF, the data queries, and 
agrees with the content.

Drug -induced Liver Injury Rep orting & A dditional Assessments
Reporting
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of DILI, cases of concurrent AST /ALT and 
TBL and/or INRelevation according to the criteria specified in Section 6.3require the 
following:
The event is to be reported to Amgen as a serious adverse event within 1 working 
dayof discovery or notification of the event (ie, before additional etiologic 
investigations have been concluded)
The appropriate CRF (eg, Event CRF) that captures information necessary to 
facilitate the evaluation of treatment -emergent liver abnormalities are tobe 
completed and sent to Amgen. 
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Section 9.2.2.2 .
Additional Clinical Assessments and Observation
All subjects in whom investigational product(s) or protocol -required therapies is/are 
withheld (either permanently or conditionally) due to potential DILI as specified in 
Sections 6.3.2 and 6.3.3 or who experience AST or ALT elevations 3 ×ULN are to
undergo a period of “close observation” until abnormalities return to normal or to the 
subject’s baseline levels.  
Assessments that are tobe performed during this period include: 
Repeat AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin (total and direct), and INR within 24 hours 
In cases of TBL 2 ×ULN or INR 1.5, retesting of liver tests, BIL (total and direct), 
and INR is to be performed every 24 hours until laboratory abnormalities improve
Testing frequency of the above laboratory tests may decrease if the abnormalities 
stabilize or the investigational product(s) or protocol -required therapies has/have been 
discontinued AND the subject is asymptomatic .

Superseding Amendment 6 
v2 25 February 2019 
Rationale:  
The purpose of this protocol amendment is to:  
• Expand the primary objective to include additional SC dosing frequency intervals 
based on PK and safety data by deleting q12h and qd dosing frequency in the 
objective 
• Add potential for additional dose cohorts in Period 1 beyond Cohorts 1 -3 to explore 
different SC dosing regimens (doses and intervals) during Cycle 1 Week 4 
o Expand the SC dosing frequency options to include longer intervals of q48h, 
q72h, q96h, q7d, in addition to the pre- existing q12h and q24h options  
o Expand the SC dose range to 169- 900 µg including intermediate dose options  
• Expand Schedule of Assessments to define dosing schedule, PK sampling, biomarker sampling and hospitalization requirements for the additional SC 
frequencies (Period 2)  
• Increase the number of subjects to accommodate potential for 2 additional cohort s in 
Period 1, and to allow for up to 20% replacement rate of subjects who prematurely discontinue in either Period  
• Clarify that the DLRT will decide on choice of SC dosing regimen for each cohort 
based off review of clinical, safety, tolerability and PK data from previous cohorts, 
and to define boundaries for dose and frequency choices  
• Extend the premedication dexamethasone administration window from within 1 hour 
prior to up to 6 hours prior to first dose/dose- step, and to clarify that dexamethasone 
requirements also apply prior to first dose SC and prior to resuming cIV in 
Cycle  1/Period 1 Weeks 4 and 5 respectively  
• Update the subject replacement rules for Cycle 1/Period 2  
• Clarify DLRT Investigator quorum includes PI’s that enrolled subjects on cohort.

CONFIDENTIAL    • The DLRT will decide the change in dosing frequency based on results of 
pharmacokinetics from previous cohorts.  
• Modify DLT criteria to exclude all Grade 3 and 4 lymphopenia.  Grade 4 lymphopenia 
is known to occur from therapies used to treat lymphoma.  This lymphopenia is 
reported to last for 6 months or as long as a year after therapy completion 
(Chiappella et al, 2017; Coffier, 2007; Plosker and Figgitt, 2003).  Lymphopenia is also a known adverse event with blinatumomab does resolve after therapy is 
completed.   
• Modify DLT to exclude Grade 3 neurological events that resolve within 7 days.   
o This is based on that Grade 3 neurologic events are known to occur with cIV 
blinatumomab and resolve within 7 days in most cases.   After resolution of the 
neurologic event the blinatumomab can be restarted at the next lower dose level 
and if the event doesn’t occur again then the dose can be escalated to the target 
dose.   
o There are now 12 patients that have been treated with SC blinatumomab and 
have tolerated the dose which has similar pharmacokinetics to the target dose of 
112 ug/day cIV.   One subject had Grade 3 neurotoxicity after the third SC  dose 
that resolved after 24 hours.  One subject had Grade 3 neurotoxicity in cIV Run 
In at 112  ug/day cIV that resolved on holding the infusion.  The subject 
proceeded to SC and tolerated this well without reoccurrence of the grade 3 
neurotoxicity.   
• Revise toxicity management, treatment interruptions and re- start table, including 
capacity to rechallenge with SC in the event of  Grade 3 neurological event that 
resolves within 7 days  
• Add contingent treatment management instructions for remaining subjects enrolled in 
any Period 1/Cycle 1 cohort in the scenario that preceding subjects in that cohort 
experience a DLT and the cohort is terminated.  
• Modify optional Cycle 2 in Period 2 to allow SC if the subject had clinical benefit in Cycle 1, if no benefit they could receive cIV.  
• Clarify that post -Cycle 1 and post -Cycle 2 disease assessment PET -CT/CT scans 
should be performed within 2- 4 weeks post last dose  
• Increase contraception and lactation reporting and washout period post last dose of SC from 48 hours up to 96 hours in the Safety section and under Exclusion Criteria, 
based on review of actual Period 1 PK data  
• Make editorial and administrative changes for grammatical reasons as well as for internal consistency within the protocol.  
Additional errors were identified and rectified in the superseding amendment, and 
administrative errors were corrected:  
• incorporate superseding revisions to Table 7  (Schedule of Assessments for Optional 
Cycle 2) to correct typographical errors in cycle day and footnote “m”  
• to correct the wording of footnote “m”.  
A date error was identified and rectified in Superseding Amendment 3 Version 2.0:  
• Date in the header was changed from 17 January 2019 to 25 February 2019

The purpose of this protocol amendment is to:  
• Expand the primary objective to include additional SC dosing frequency intervals 
based on PK and safety data by deleting q12h and qd dosing frequency in the 
objective 
• Add potential for additional dose cohorts in Period 1 beyond Cohorts 1 -3 to explore 
different SC dosing regimens (doses and intervals) during Cycle 1 Week 4 
o Expand the SC dosing frequency options to include longer intervals of q48h, 
q72h, q96h, q7d, in addition to the pre- existing q12h and q24h options  
o Expand the SC dose range to 169- 900 µg including intermediate dose options  
• Expand Schedule of Assessments to define dosing schedule, PK sampling, 
biomarker  sampling and hospitalization requirements for the additional SC 
frequencies (Period 2)  
• Increase the number of subjects to accommodate potential for 2 additional cohorts in 
Period 1, and to allow for up to 20% replacement rate of subjects who prematurely 
discontinue in either Period  
• Clarify that the DLRT will decide on choice of SC dosing regimen for each cohort based off review of clinical, safety, tolerability and PK data from previous cohorts, 
and to define boundaries for dose and frequency choices  
• Extend the premedication dexamethasone administration window from within 1 hour 
prior to up to 6 hours prior to first dose/dose- step, and to clarify that dexamethasone 
requirements also apply prior to first dose SC and prior to resuming cIV in 
Cycle  1/Period 1 Weeks 4 and 5 respectively  
• Update the subject replacement rules for Cycle 1/Period 2  
• Clarify DLRT Investigator quorum includes PI’s that enrolled subjects on cohort.  
• The DLRT will decide the change in dosing frequency based on results of pharmacokinetics  from previous cohorts.

CONFIDENTIAL    • Modify DLT criteria to exclude all Grade 3 and 4 lymphopenia.  Grade 4 lymphopenia 
is known to occur from therapies used to treat lymphoma.  This lymphopenia is 
reported to last for 6 months or as long as a year after therapy completion (Chiappella et al, 2017; Coffier, 2007; Plosker and Figgitt, 2003).  Lymphopenia is 
also a known adverse event with blinatumomab does resolve after therapy is 
completed.   
• Modify DLT to exclude Grade 3 neurological events that resolve within 7 days.   
o This is based on that Grade 3 neurologic events are known to occur with cIV 
blinatumomab and resolve within 7 days in most cases.   After resolution of the 
neurologic event the blinatumomab can be restarted at the next lower dose level 
and if the event doesn’t occur again then the dose can be escalated to the target 
dose.   
o There are now 12 patients that have been treated with SC blinatumomab and 
have tolerated the dose which has similar pharmacokinetics to the target dose of 
112 ug/day cIV.   One subject had Grade 3 neurotoxicity after the third SC  dose 
that resolved after 24 hours.  One subject had Grade 3 neurotoxicity in cIV Run 
In at 112  ug/day cIV that resolved on holding the infusion.  The subject 
proceeded to SC and tolerated this well without reoccurrence of the grade 3 neurotoxicity.   
• Revise toxicity management, treatment interruptions and re- start table, including 
capacity to rechallenge with SC in the event of Grade 3 neurological event that resolves within 7 days  
• Add contingent treatment management instructions for remaining subjects enrolled in 
any Period 1/Cycle 1 cohort in the scenario that preceding subjects in that cohort 
experience a DLT and the cohort is terminated.  
• Modify optional Cycle 2 in Period 2 to allow SC if the subject had clinical benefit in 
Cycle 1, if no benefit they could receive cIV.  
• Clarify that post -Cycle 1 and post -Cycle 2 disease assessment PET -CT/CT scans 
should be performed within 2- 4 weeks post last dose  
• Increase contraception and lactation reporting and washout period post last dose of 
SC from 48 hours up to 96 hours in the Safety section and under Exclusion Criteria, 
based on review of actual Period 1 PK data  
• Make editorial and administrative changes for grammatical reasons as well as for 
internal consistency within the protocol.

Amgen Protocol Number (Product Name: Blinatumomab) 20140286  
 
Amendment Date:  08 January 2017  
Rationale:  
This protocol is being amended as a result  of discussions with the US Food and Drug 
Administration ( FDA). 
The changes reflect the following key modifications: 
• Inclusion criterion 103,  clarified to be eligible subjects must have a histologically 
determined B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma ( NHL) subtype as defined in the 
bulleted list and must have disease that is primary refractory after initial therapy 
or have relapsed disease. 
• Inclusion criterion 104, clarified that the subject’s disease status for eligibility in 
the study . 
• Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) rules were clarified to more precisely define what the 
DLT evaluable period is for each subcutaneous (SC) period (Periods 1 and 2) of 
the study and to clarify how many doses a subject must receive in order to be 
considered DLT -evaluable if the subject did not have a DLT.  
• Clarified the definition of a DLT and better define what is considered an adverse event in the study.  
• Added a table to he lp the investigator better understand what to do when there is 
an interruption of blinatumomab and dose modification because of an adverse event and the criteria for rechallenge . 
• Added amylase to the list of chemistries to monitor for pancreatitis to be 
consistent with the acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL) label.  
• Revised the table for disease- related adverse events to include only adverse 
events that are directly related to the underlying disease.  
• Revised the language for laboratory adverse events to inc lude the requirement 
that laboratory abnormalities that require intervention be recorded as adverse events.  
• Revised Figure 4  to show continuous monitoring.  
• Clarified the stopping rules for Cycle 1/Period 2. 
• Clarified that up to 15 additional subjects may be enrolled in the Period 2 expanded cohort to allow for flexibility in stopping the study.  
• Administration, typographical and formatting changes were made throughout the protocol.

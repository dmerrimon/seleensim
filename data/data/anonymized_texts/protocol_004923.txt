Study Objectives 
Primary Objective: 
 To assess the efficacy of repeat intravenous (IV) doses of 4 mg and 8 mg IRL201104 
compared to placebo in adult participants with EoE after 3 doses administered over 14 days as 
assessed by the change in peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophilic count per high power 
field (eos/hpf) at Week 4.  
Secondary Objectives: 
 To explore the relationship between IRL201104 treatment and change in symptoms of 
dysphagia in adult participants with EoE, using the patient-reported outcomes (PRO) 
instrument Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ). 
 To assess the efficacy of repeat IV doses of IRL201104 in adult participants with EoE after 
3 doses administered over 14 days as assessed by thresholds of histologic response at Week 4. 
 To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of IRL201104 in adult participants 
with EoE. 
Exploratory Objectives: 
 To explore the relationship between IRL201104 and change in clinical outcomes assessments, 
to include the PROs Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) and Patient Global 
Impression of Change (PGI-C), and the clinician-reported outcomes EoE-Endoscopic 
Reference Score (EREFS) and EoE Histology Scoring System (EoEHSS].  
 To explore the relationship between IRL201104 and the relative change in RNA gene 
expression to include EoE diagnostic panel (EDP) transcriptome signature. 
 To explore the relationship between IRL201104 treatment on immune cells and markers of 
inflammation.

5.1. Eosinophilic Esophagitis 
Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic and progressive disease of the immune system 
resulting in damage to the esophagus with subsequent loss of function resulting in difficulty 
swallowing and food impaction. If not adequately treated, symptoms and inflammation can 
progress, leading to scarring of the esophagus with irreversible damage. In the United States 
(US), there are approximately 160,000 patients with EoE who are currently treated, of which 
approximately 50,000 have failed multiple treatments. There are currently no therapies approved 
by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for EoE. 
Eosinophilic esophagitis is caused by the presence of large numbers of eosinophils in the 
esophagus. The production and accumulation of eosinophils may be caused by many factors, 
such as immune hypersensitivity responses to particular foods or environmental proteins 
(allergens) in affected individuals. Eosinophilic esophagitis is characterized by esophageal 
barrier defects and eosinophilic infiltrates. Therapeutic interventions that target reduction in 
esophageal eosinophils have been shown to correlate with symptom improvement ( Hirano 2020).
Regulatory T (Treg) cells are a subset of T lymphocytes that play an important role in the 
prevention and control of many autoimmune and allergic diseases. Frischmeyer-Guerrerio, et al 
noted that transforming growth factor–that patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), an autosomal dominant disorder caused by 
mutations in the genes encoding receptor subun
strongly predisposed to develop allergic disease, including asthma, food allergy, eczema, allergic 
rhinitis, and eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease ( Frischmeyer-Guerrerio 2013). Patients with 
LDS exhibited elevated immunoglobulin (Ig) E levels, eosinophil counts, and T helper (Th) 2 
cytokines in their plasma. They had an increased frequency of cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ 
T-cells that expressed both forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) and interleukin (IL)-13, but retained the 
ability to suppress effector T-cell proliferation. T helper 2 cytokine–producing cells accumulated 
in cultures of naïve CD4+ T-cells from LDS subjects, but not controls, after stimulation with h2 skewing in naïve lymphocytes in a 
cell-
signaling can predispose to allergic phenotypes in humans and underscores a prominent role for 
 the environment and foods and may 
be relevant to nonsyndromic presentations of allergic diseases such as EoE.  
Treg cells are reduced in the biopsies of adults with EoE as compared with control participants 
(Stuck 2011 ). In contrast, Treg cells seem to be increased in esophageal tissue of children with 
EoE compared with individuals with gastroesophageal reflux disease and healthy participants 
(Fuentebella 2010 ). However, Treg cell immunosuppressive function may be minimized in 
patients with EoE, similar to patients with allergic asthma. In animal models of EoE, 
epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT) induced Treg cells in the spleen and expression of forkhead 
box P3 (FOXP3) in the esophagus that correlated with reduced eosinophilic infiltration. 
Depletion of CD25+ cells abrogated Treg cell induction and resulted in increased esophageal 
inflammation. The transfer of Treg cells isolated from mice who had undergone EPIT prevented 
peanut-induced eosinophil infiltration and eotaxin expression in the esophagus of mice 
(Dioszeghy 2014 ). Interestingly, patients with the autosomal recessive form of hyper-IgE

Clinical Study Protocol Version 2.0 Study RVLO 121-04 
Confidential Page 20 of 60 syndrome caused by mutations in the dedicator of cytokinesis 8 gene have defective Treg cells 
and often develop EoE ( Hsu 1993, Janssen 2014 ). 
Finally, Wen, et al employed single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing to examine the 
heterogeneity of human tissue CD3+ T-cells during allergic inflammation, focusing on EoE. 
They investigated 1088 single T-cells derived from patients with a spectrum of disease activity 
with Treg (FOXP3+) enriched in the tissue. Prodigious levels of IL-5 and IL-13 were confined to 
HPGDS+ CRTH2+IL-17RB+FFAR3+CD4+ T8 effector Th2 cells. EoE severity closely 
paralleled a lipid/fatty acid–induced activation node highlighted by the expression of the 
short-chain free fatty acid receptor 3 (FFAR3). Ligands for FFAR3 induced Th2 cytokine 
production from human and murine T-cells, including in an in vivo allergy model. In summary, 
they elucidated the defining characteristics of tissue-residing CD3+ T-cells in EoE, a specific 
enrichment of CD4+ Treg and effector Th2 cells, and confinement of type 2 cytokine production 
to the CD4+ effector population ( Wen 2019). Together, these findings show that Treg cells are 
dysregulated in patients with EoE and that they can protect against an EoE-like disease in some 
cases. 
While the exact mechanism of the lack of suppressive Treg cell function in EoE isn’t known, 
Treg cells appear to be important in the pathophysiology of EoE and their modulation may 
represent an opportunity for enduring therapy for patients with EoE. 
5.2. Rationale for Treatment with IRL201104 
Almost one third of the worlds’ population is infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis (mTB) 
World Health Organization 
[WHO] 2012), resulting in an estimated 2 million deaths each year ( Miranda 2012). In the 
2 billion people with ‘latent’ disease the bacteria survive in a dormant state entrapped in the 
lungs within a protective cellular structure known as the granuloma. The process of granuloma 
formation is initiated by the mTB bacteria being taken up by alveolar macrophages, which then 
release mediators to recruit inflammatory cells including more macrophages, dendritic cells and 
T-cells, which organize into the spherical structure of the granuloma. The bacteria can survive 
for decades inside the granuloma in a latent state. To further enhance its chances of survival the 
bacteria secrete proteins, known as chaperonins, which modulate the hosts’ inflammatory 
response ( Cehovin 2010 ) and enable the bacteria to remain undetected in the human host. The 
sponsor has explored the therapeutic potential of these proteins to produce drug-like peptides. 
One such peptide, IRL201104, formerly known as PIN201104, has been identified via 
phenotypic drug discovery to be a potential anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory agent and is 
being developed as a potential treatment for a range of autoimmune and allergic diseases. 
IRL201104 is a novel synthetic peptide derived from the active domain of the mTB-secreted 
protein chaperonin 60.1. It is being developed for the relief of symptoms in patients with active 
EoE. The peptide significantly decreases airway eosinophil infiltration in rodent models of 
allergic and nonallergic inflammation. IRL201104 appears to be effective in resetting the 
immune system from an inflammatory state and in inducing inflammatory disease remission in 
nonclinical models. Its short pharmacokinetic (PK) terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2) decreases 
the potential for the negative off-target effects associated with current therapies. 
Importantly, in an assay using blood cells from healthy human participants, incubation with 
IRL201104 increased Treg cell concentrations in a dose-dependent manner, compared with the 
IRL201104 Revolo Biotherapeutics 
Clinical Study Protocol Version 2.0 Study RVLO 121-04 
Confidential Page 21 of 60 control-treated cells. Treg cell levels were increased by more than 2-fold at the top concentration 
of IRL201104 (data on file).  
Numerous nonclinical pharmacology studies performed suggest that IRL201104 has an 
anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory mechanism of action. IRL201104 is effective in a 
range of models of inflammation and has also demonstrated efficacy in animal models of asthma, 
with prolonged duration of action. 
5.3. Clinical Development Program
In non-clinical safety pharmacology and toxicology studies, IRL201104 was safe and well 
tolerated at exposures up to 11 times higher than the highest dose level planned for the current 
Phase 2a clinical study. In 14-day rat and dog Good Laboratory Practice toxicology studies, the 
no-observed-effect-level was the highest dose tested (0.5 mg/kg intravenous [IV] bolus). 
IRL201104 was assessed in a first-in-human (FIH) Phase 1 study in 62 healthy participants and 
participants with mild asthma in the United Kingdom (UK) (Study C1104-001). The highest dose 
tested was a single 8 mg dose (IV bolus) in 4 healthy participants and 6 participants with mild 
asthma. Most participants in the study received a single dose by IV bolus; however, 1 group 
(4 participants) received 3 single IV bolus injections of 2 mg (2 hours apart) on a single day. In 
this study, IRL201104 was well tolerated and safe, with no significant adverse events (AEs) 
reported for single doses up to 8 mg IRL201104. After a single 2, 4, and 8 mg IV bolus, 
IRL201104 was detectable in blood up to 15, 30, and 60 minutes, respectively, with exposure 
increasing in a dose-dependent manner. The mean t1/2 of the 8 mg dose was approximately 
16 minutes. 
IRL201104 is currently being assessed for safety, tolerability, and PK in an ongoing Phase 1 
multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in 18 healthy participants in the UK (Study C1104-003). 
The IRL201104 IV dose levels were 4 mg once daily (QD) for 5 days and 8 mg QD for 7 days. 
At each dose level, up to 8 participants received IRL201104 and 2 received placebo. Following a 
blinded review of safety data, study treatment was well tolerated in the groups receiving either 
IRL201104 4 mg (6 participants), 8 mg (8 participants) or placebo (4 participants) for 5 days and 
followed through Day 21.  
In combination, these nonclinical data and a good clinical safety/tolerability profile show that 
IRL201104 is well suited for further development as a treatment for EoE.
This Phase 2a clinical study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to investigate 
the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of IRL201104 in adult participants with active EoE. 
Participants will receive a total of 3 doses of IRL201104 4 mg or 8 mg IV or placebo over a 14-
day period. Study treatment will be delivered by IV bolus injection via cannula.  
The justification for the dose levels selected in the current study is presented in Section 7.8. 
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and 
all applicable regulatory requirements.

7.1. Overall Study Design and Flow Chart 
This is a Phase 2a, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to assess the efficacy and 
safety of a repeat-dose regimen of IRL201104 in participants with active EoE. A study diagram 
is provided in Figure 1. 
Eligible participants will undergo an up-to-6-week screening period to stabilize current therapy, 
confirm diagnosis by histologic assessment, and other eligibility criteria. Participant compliance 
to DSQ reporting will be assessed for at least 2 consecutive weeks prior to randomization. 
At the end of the screening period, eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one 
of 3 arms, as displayed in Figure 1: 
 Arm 1: IRL201104 4 mg IV with endoscopy and esophageal biopsy 2 weeks after last 
dose (Week 4).  Arm2: IRL201104 8 mg IV with endoscopy and esophageal biopsy 2 weeks after last 
dose (Week 4). 
 Arm 3: Placebo IV with endoscopy and esophageal biopsy 2 weeks after last dose 
(Week 4). 
Participants will receive IRL201104 (4 mg or 8 mg IV) or placebo on Days 0, 7, and 14 (3 total 
doses over 14 days). Participants will be evaluated for clinical and histologic responses at 
Week 4. All participants will be assessed for safety and continued biomarker sampling through 
Week 8. 
The Schedule of Events for the study is provided in Table 3.  
The total duration of the study for a given participant is up to 14 weeks.

Approximately up to 50 participants are planned to be enrolled to yield 36 participants who are 
randomized and complete the final endoscopy at Week 4. The sample size determination is 
provided in Section 15.4. 
7.3. Treatment Assignment 
Eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive IRL201104 4 mg or 8 mg or 
placebo and to complete the final endoscopy with esophageal biopsy 2 weeks after last dose 
(Week 4).  
7.4. Definition of the End of the Study 
The end of the study is defined as the final follow-up visit by the last participant. If the study is 
terminated prematurely, the study ends when the sponsor notifies the investigator in writing that 
the study has finished, or when the last participant attends the final follow-up visit, whichever is 
later. 7.5. Dose Modification Criteria 
Dose modification for an individual participant is not allowed. 
7.6. Planned Interim Analysis 
No interim analysis is planned. 
7.7. Independent Data Monitoring Committee 
An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), composed of members who are 
independent from the sponsor and the study investigators, will monitor participant safety by 
conducting formal reviews of accumulated safety data. 
The IDMC will provide the sponsor with appropriate recommendations on the conduct of the 
clinical study to ensure the protection and safety of the participants enrolled in the study. The 
IDMC may also institute measures required for ensuring the integrity of the study results during 
the study execution.
All activities and responsibilities of the IDMC are described in the IDMC charter. 
7.8. Rationale for Dose Selection 
A total of 3 doses of 4 mg or 8 mg (IV bolus) administered once on Days 0, 7, and 14 will be 
tested for efficacy in participants with active EoE in this study. 
In safety pharmacology and toxicology studies, IRL201104 was safe and well tolerated at 
exposures at least 3-fold and up to 11 times higher than the dose level planned for the current 
Phase 2a clinical study. In 14-day rat and dog Good Laboratory Practice toxicology studies, the 
no-observed-effect-level was the highest dose tested (0.5 mg/kg IV bolus). Safety margins are 
summarized in Table 2.

The dose and dosing regimen have been selected from nonclinical models of allergic 
inflammation, which assess impact on eosinophils. A number of models assessing eosinophilic 
inflammation have been conducted showing significant reduction in eosinophils. 
7.8.1. Selection of Highest Dose Level 
In the ovalbumin challenge model, single IV doses of 2 and 20 µg/kg significantly inhibited 
eosinophil recruitment into the lung (Study D0028 GSK; refer to the Investigator’s Brochure), 
with a greater effect being seen with 20 g/kg ( Figure 2). Pharmacokinetics were not measured 
in this study but were measured in a lipopolysaccharide acute inflammation mouse model, where 
an IV dose of 20 g/kg (which was maximally efficacious) resulted in a maximum observed 
concentration (C max) of 152 ng/mL and an area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 
time = 0 to the last measurable concentration (AUC last) of 18 ng.h/mL (Studies D0055 PNE and 
PSN18-0258; refer to the Investigator’s Brochure). This exposure is consistent with other mouse 
studies where PK has been measured. A clinical dose of 8 mg (C1104-001) gives an exposure 
approximately 4- to 8-fold higher than the maximum efficacious dose in mouse model 
(20 µg/kg).

Mouse Lung 
Data represent mean ± standard error of the mean of n= 6 animals; *p<0.05 vs ovalbumin, T- test 
 
7.8.2. Selection of Dose Interval 
In addition, an allergic house dust mite (HDM) model has been conducted. Briefly, mice 
underwent 3 weeks of sensitization to HDM, rested for a period of 2 weeks, and then were 
challenged intranasally (IN) with HDM. Animals were treated with vehicle, IRL201104, or 
comparator drugs 15 minutes prior to HDM challenge as a single administration. Lung 
inflammatory infiltration was measured by analyzing the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at 4 hours 
after HDM challenge (acute time point) or after 7 days (chronic time point). A third group of 
animals was rechallenged with HDM 14 days later and cellular infiltration was evaluated 4 hours 
later. 
IRL201104, given as a single IN administration, dose-dependently reduced eosinophil, 
neutrophil, and lymphocyte lung influx following both the HDM challenge and rechallenge 
(Figure 3), indicating that the effect lasted for at least 14 days. Eosinophil recruitment was 
significantly inhibited by IRL201104 and achieved the same degree of eosinophil inhibition as 
anti-interleukin (IL)-5 at the maximum dose tested (2 µg/kg).

Therefore, 3 doses administered over a 2-week period has been selected as the dosing regimen 
based on the nonclinical evidence that, despite having a short PK t 1/2, IRL201104 IV bolus is 
maximally efficacious in the ovalbumin mouse model (Studies D0028 and D0024) and that the 
effect lasts for 14 days after a single dose in the HDM mouse model (Study D0024 GSK; refer to 
the Investigator’s Brochure) but the effects appeared to subside at 20 days postdose (ovalbumin
mouse model; results published in Riffo-Vasquez 2020). This long PD effect is hypothesized to 
be because of an effect of IRL201104 on Treg cells; IRL201104 was shown to increase the 
number of Treg cells in human in vitro assays (Study D0066 KCL; data on file). 
Two dose strengths were selected to be tested in the current Phase 2a clinical study: 4 mg and 
8 mg. These dose levels have been well tolerated in healthy participant studies to date, the 
maximum doses studied to date being 8 mg on 7 consecutive days. Experience with anti-IL-5 
compounds would indicate that marked and sustained suppression of eosinophils has not been 
associated with adverse effects for example increased risk of parasitic infection.

26. Any other medical or psychological condition including relevant laboratory abnormalities 
at screening that, in the opinion of the investigator, suggest a new and/or insufficiently 
understood disease, may present an unreasonable risk to the participant as a result of 
his/her participation in this clinical study, may make the participant’s participation 
unreliable, or may interfere with study assessments. The specific justification for 
participants excluded under this criterion will be noted in study documents (eg, chart 
notes, electronic case report form). These may include participant-reported alcohol or 
drug abuse and severe concomitant illness(es). 
27. Planned or anticipated use of any prohibited medications and procedures (as described in 
the exclusion criteria) during study treatment. 
28. Treatment with a live (attenuated) vaccine within 3 months prior to screening and/or 
treatment of a killed vaccine within 30 days prior to screening, until the end of the study 
with the exception of a coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine, as described in 
Section 9.2.1 . 
29. Pregnant or breastfeeding women, or women planning to become pregnant or breastfeed 
during the study. 
30. Women unwilling to use adequate birth control, if of reproductive potential* and sexually 
active. Adequate birth control is defined as agreement to consistently practice an 
effective and accepted method of contraception throughout the duration of the study and 
for 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. These include: hormonal 
contraceptives, intrauterine device, or double barrier contraception (ie, condom and 
diaphragm), or male partner with documented vasectomy.
*For females, menopause is defined as at least 12 consecutive months without menses; to 
include laboratory confirmation of post-menopausal status (ie, a follicle stimulating 
hormone (FSH) of 2.25 U/mL must be documented). Hysterectomy, bilateral

At the end of the study, all unused study treatment supplies will be returned to the sponsor or 
destroyed in accordance with the sponsor’s instructions. 
The investigator must be able to account for all opened and unopened study treatment. These 
records should contain the dates, quantity, and study treatment dispensed to each participant and 
disposed of at the study center.  
All accountability records must be made available for inspection by the sponsor and regulatory 
agency inspectors; photocopies must be provided to the sponsor at the conclusion of the study.  
10.7. Study Treatment Handling and Disposal 
Procedures for study treatment handling and disposal are provided in the study manuals.  
11. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY 
All efficacy assessments will be collected at the time points specified in Table 3. 
11.1. Histologic Response 
Esophageal biopsies will be obtained by endoscopy. The peak eos/hpf is the primary measure of 
efficacy. 
The screening endoscopy should be performed during the screening period to allow results to be 
available prior to Visit 1 for assessment of eligibility. A total of 9 mucosal pinch biopsies will be 
collected at each time point from across 3 esophageal regions: proximal, mid-esophagus, and 
distal. Three samples from each region will be used for the histology (needed for study inclusion 
criteria, as well as efficacy endpoints). Biopsy tissue will be placed in level-specific vials and 
sent to the central pathology laboratory for processing of tissue into slides. Esophageal biopsies 
will be used to assess histologic changes and to examine EoE gross esophageal mucosal features 
based on a validated scoring system for inflammatory and remodeling aspects of the disease. To 
be randomized in the study, participants must have a peak intraepithelial eosinophil count of at 
least 15 eos/hpf [400×]) from esophageal biopsy specimens in at least 2 of the 3 esophageal 
regions sampled. 
Eosinophil counts, histopathologic features, and gross endoscopic findings will be evaluated and 
scored for each endoscopy. Eight histopathologic epithelial features (basal layer hyperplasia, 
eosinophil density, eosinophil microabscesses, eosinophil surface layering, dilated intercellular 
spaces, surface epithelial alteration, dyskeratotic epithelial cells, lamina propria fibrosis) will be 
scored on a 4-point scale (0 = normal, 3 = worst) for both the severity of the abnormality (ie, 
grade) and the amount of tissue affected by the abnormality (ie, stage). 
Endoscopic findings with separate evaluations of the proximal and distal esophagus will be 
recorded with respect to 5 categories by the endoscopist: 1) exudates or plaques (grade 0–2); 
2) fixed esophageal rings (grade 0–3); 3) edema (grade 0–1); 4) furrows (grade 0–1); and 
5) strictures (grade 0–1). An endoscopy score for each category will be calculated and summed 
for each anatomic location (proximal and distal). The maximum endoscopy score is 10 points for 
IRL201104 Revolo Biotherapeutics 
Clinical Study Protocol Version 2.0 Study RVLO 121-04 
Confidential Page 43 of 60 each location, and a Total Endoscopy Score is the sum of the scores for the proximal and distal 
locations. 
In addition, the general appearance of the stomach and duodenum will be assessed by the 
endoscopist. Biopsies will be taken from the stomach and duodenum for the screening EGD as 
follows: gastric body (greater curvature): 2 specimens, gastric antrum: 2 specimens, and 
duodenum (third part or distal): 2 specimens. Biopsies from the stomach should be submitted in 
one vial; biopsies from the duodenum should be submitted in a separate vial to the central 
pathology laboratory for processing of tissue into slides. If the pre-treatment biopsy identifies 
eosinophilia in the stomach and/or duodenum, the participant will be excluded from the study. 
As a secondary endpoint, histologic response will be defined as eosinophil count < 15 eos/hpf 
(400×) in all available esophageal levels following 14 days of treatment with IRL201104 based 
on anatomical and histological findings from endoscopy with esophageal biopsies. Change in 
peak esophageal eos/hpf from baseline will be determined by counting eosinophils in the most 
inflamed areas of each esophageal region sampled at each time point and calculating the change 
in the peak count at each location obtained at baseline compared with the count obtained at 
subsequent time points. 
Histology results will be interpreted by a pathologist at a central pathology reading center. 
Gastric and duodenal biopsies may be repeated at the discretion of the investigator, but are not 
required. Detailed instructions for biopsy sample collection and handling will be provided in the 
study manuals. 
Tissue blocks remaining after the histological assessment will be banked for exploratory 
research. Remaining samples from each region will be processed to bank tissue RNA for EDP 
transcriptome signature (Section 11.7)  and other EoE related gene expression exploratory 
research (Section 11.8 ). Biopsy samples will be sent to a central pathology laboratory for 
processing and analysis. If required by the investigator institution, biopsy samples will be 
processed and analyzed by the local laboratory, and the processed specimen will be sent to the 
central pathology laboratory for central reading.  
In addition to the samples to assess histological response, the next set of biopsies will be taken 
from the most inflamed area of the esophagus. A total of 4 biopsies will be obtained and stored 
in RNA later™(1 fragment), flash frozen (1 fragment), and formalin-fixed (2 fragments). The 
banked samples will be used for exploratory analysis which could include, but are not limited to, 
gene expression, epigenetics, cell culture, and microbiome, etc. Detailed instructions for biopsy 
sample collection and handling will be provided in the study manuals. 
The number of and locations of required biopsy sampling is summarized in Table 5.

11.2. Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire 
The DSQ is used to measure the frequency and intensity of dysphagia. The DSQ scores can 
range from 0 to 84, with a lower score indicating less frequent or less severe dysphagia 
(Dellon 2013). 
The questionnaire will be completed by participants daily. Each evening before bedtime, 
participants will be asked to indicate if they experienced dysphagia symptoms (eg, food passing 
slowly or food sticking) during that day. Participants must have experienced dysphagia (response 
of “yes” to Question 2 on DSQ) on a minimum of 2  
of days in at least 2 consecutive weeks (qualifying period) prior to the baseline visit (Visit 1). 
Participants must fill out the DSQ at least 5 or more days during a given week in order to be 
compliant. 
Calculations will be performed on daily ePRO entries from the qualifying period prior to 
baseline, and prior to each study visit during the treatment and follow-up periods. The DSQ 
score for the secondary endpoints will be calculated by summing the scores of responses to 
Questions 2 and 3 only. Questions 1 and 4 will be excluded from the DSQ score. 
DSQ score for 14-day period =  
(Sum of points from questions 2+3 in the daily DSQ with 
non-missing data over the interval being reported)×14 
Number of diaries reported with non-missing data over the interval 
being reported 
IRL201104 Revolo Biotherapeutics 
Clinical Study Protocol Version 2.0 Study RVLO 121-04 
Confidential Page 45 of 60 For each DSQ calculation, the sum of the specified question(s) from each reported daily diary 
with non-missing data over the interval being reported will be obtained, dividing this by the 
number of reported daily diaries with non-missing data in that same interval. This result will then 
be multiplied by the interval. This normalizes each DSQ sum over the interval. For the DSQ 
score, if a response of “No” is recorded for Question 2, the DSQ score will be set to zero for that 
day. The DSQ calculations during the interval being reported prior to the baseline visit will be 
defined as the baseline DSQ evaluation. For each 14-day period, at least 8 reported diaries are 
needed to effectuate a DSQ calculation for that period. If at least 8 diaries are not available, the 
DSQ result for that 14-day period will be set to missing. 
11.3. Eosinophilic Esophagitis-Endoscopic Reference Score
The EoE-EREFS will be used to measure the endoscopically identified EoE esophageal mucosal 
inflammatory and remodeling features. This instrument includes a total of 17 items related to the 
presence and severity of esophageal features. The specific esophageal features include: rings 
(absent, mild, moderate, severe, not applicable); stricture (yes, no, not applicable); diameter of 
the stricture (if applicable); exudates (absent, mild, severe); furrows (absent, present); edema 
(absent, present); crepe paper esophagus (absent, present); overall general appearance 
incorporating all endoscopically identified EoE findings (ie, fixed rings, strictures, whitish 
exudates, furrowing, edema, and crepe paper mucosa). In addition, mucosal changes associated 
with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) will also be recorded using the Los Angeles 
classification system for erosions (No Erosions or LA Classification A, B, C, D). The EoE 
esophageal characteristics will be analyzed based on the EoE-EREFS, a validated scoring system 
for inflammatory and remodeling features of disease using both overall scores and scores for 
each individual characteristic ( Hirano 2013). The EoE-EREFS should be performed by the 
physician who performs the endoscopy procedure at the time of the endoscopy. In addition to the 
local read, images will be submitted to the central imaging laboratory for central reading. 
11.4. Eosinophilic Esophagitis-Histology Scoring System 
The EoEHSS is a validated histology scoring system for esophageal biopsies that evaluates 8 
features: eosinophil density, basal zone hyperplasia, eosinophil abscesses, eosinophil surface 
layering, dilated intercellular spaces, surface epithelial alteration, dyskeratotic epithelial cells, 
and lamina propria fibrosis (absent/present) ( Collins 2017). Severity (grade) and extent (stage) of 
abnormalities will be scored using a 4-point scale (0 normal; 3 maximum change). 11.5. Patient Global Impression of Severity 
The PGI-S is a PRO measure that uses a verbal rating scale of severity. The PGI-S uses a recall 
period that aligns with the assessment period used for calculating DSQ endpoint scores (ie, DSQ 
endpoints are based on 14-day scores, and the PGI-S is administered on the last day of the 14-
day assessment period. The PGI-S instructs participants to recall over the past 14 days, such that 
the anchor covers the same 14-day period as the 14-day DSQ endpoint score). 
IRL201104 Revolo Biotherapeutics 
Clinical Study Protocol Version 2.0 Study RVLO 121-04 
Confidential Page 46 of 60 11.6. Patient Global Impression of Change
The PGI-C is a PRO measure that assesses change compared with prior to starting treatment and 
reflects the participant’s belief about the efficacy of treatment. The PGI-C is a scale depicting a 
participant’s rating of overall improvement. 
11.7. RNA Sequencing and EDP Transcriptome 
RNA sequencing and EDP transcriptome will be evaluated.  
A molecular EDP has been identified that is composed of 94 EoE genes and distinguishes EoE 
from control individuals without esophagitis or with GERD ( Wen 2013).  
The EDP signature will be evaluated in biopsy samples. Using a method reported by 
Wen (2015) , the EoE transcriptome will be determined using the EDP from extracted RNA.  
Further details will be provided in the study manuals. 
11.8. Other Biomarkers of Eosinophilic Esophagitis  
Other biomarkers of disease will be explored and may include, but are not limited to: 
immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, DNA analysis, microdissection further 
immunophenotyping, gene expression, epigenetics, cell culture, and microbiome, etc.  
12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
All safety assessments will be collected at the time points specified in the Schedule of Events 
(Table 3). 
12.1. Screening and Baseline Assessments 
A screening assessment to determine study eligibility will be performed after the participant has 
provided signed informed consent. The participant will be assigned a unique participant number 
once the ICF has been signed.  
Demographic characteristics will include standard demography (eg, age, race, and weight), 
medical history, medication history, and diet history for each participant . Characteristics of 
disease, including duration, and disease symptoms, will be collected. Viral serology, 
demographic characteristics, medical and medication history, and height are collected at 
screening only. 12.2. Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, 
and respiratory rate and will be assessed within 15 minutes predose and at 15 minutes (+/-5 
minutes) postdose.  
Measurements should be made with participants in a sitting position, after resting for at least 
5 minutes. 
Height will be measured at screening only.

A complete physical examination comprises a routine medical examination, including gross 
neurological assessments. The following body systems will be examined: general appearance, 
neurological, eyes, ear/nose/throat, cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, hepatic, 
gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and dermatological. 
For each body system the result will be recorded as “normal”, “abnormal not clinically 
significant”, or “abnormal clinically significant”. 
12.4. Electrocardiogram 
A standard 12-lead ECG will be performed before blood is drawn during visits requiring blood 
draws. The ECG strips or reports will be retained with the source documentation, and the results 
will be documented in the eCRF. Electrocardiogram results will be locally interpreted.

Other laboratory tests: 
Serum pregnancy tests will be performed for females of reproductive potential at 
screening, after which urine pregnancy tests will be performed. 
 FSH testing will be performed at screening to confirm post-menopausal status in female 
participants who have had at least 12 months without menses. 
 Coagulation testing (prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time) will be performed 
as indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Table 3 ). Samples for coagulation tests should be 
obtained before the procedures of endoscopy with esophageal biopsies are performed. 
Abnormal laboratory values and laboratory AEs: 
 All laboratory values must be reviewed by the investigator or authorized designee. 
 Significantly abnormal tests must be repeated to confirm the nature and degree of the 
abnormality. When necessary, appropriate ancillary investigations should be initiated. If 
the abnormality fails to resolve or cannot be explained by events or conditions unrelated 
to the study treatment or its administration, the medical monitor must be consulted.
 The clinical significance of an abnormal test value, within the context of the disease 
under study, must be determined by the investigator. 
Criteria for reporting laboratory values as an AE are provided in Section 12.6.1.4 . 
Central laboratory assessments for the assessment of PK and immunogenicity are described in 
Section 13 . 
12.6. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events 
12.6.1. Definition of Adverse Events
12.6.1.1. Adverse Event 
An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a 
pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, 
whether or not considered causally related to the product. In clinical studies, an AE can include 
an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including baseline or washout periods, 
even if no study treatment has been administered. 
All AEs that occur after any participant has been enrolled, before treatment, during treatment, or 
within 30 days following the cessation of treatment, whether or not they are related to the study, 
must be recorded on forms provided by the sponsor. 
IRL201104 Revolo Biotherapeutics 
Clinical Study Protocol Version 2.0 Study RVLO 121-04 
Confidential Page 49 of 60 12.6.1.2. Serious Adverse Event 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, baseline, 
treatment, washout, or follow-up), and at any dose of the study treatment, that fulfils one or more 
of the following: 
 Results in death 
 It is immediately life-threatening
 It requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
 It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
 It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the participant or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
All SAEs that occur after any participant has been enrolled, before treatment, during treatment, 
or within 30 days following the cessation of treatment, whether or not they are related to the 
study, must be recorded on forms provided by the sponsor. 
12.6.1.3. Other Adverse Events 
The following events require reporting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of learning 
of the event: 
Pregnancy 
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on the sponsor’s pregnancy form. 
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an investigational 
product may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. 
Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the investigator to report 
to the sponsor (or designee) by telephone within 24 hours of identification, any pregnancy 
occurring in a female participant or female partner of a male participant, during the study or 
within 120 days of the last dose of study treatment. Any complication of pregnancy affecting a 
female study participant or female partner of a male study participant, and/or fetus, and/or 
newborn must be reported as an SAE. 
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the participant was 
discontinued from the study. 
Overdose of Study Treatment 
Any accidental or intentional overdose over the intended dose of study treatment within the 
intended therapeutic window, if associated with an AE, should be reported within 24 hours. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) must be reported within 24 hours of identification. 
Adverse events of special interest in this study include:
IRL201104 Revolo Biotherapeutics 
Clinical Study Protocol Version 2.0 Study RVLO 121-04 
Confidential Page 50 of 60  Anaphylactic reactions or acute allergic reactions that require immediate treatment 
 Severe injection site reactions that last longer than 24 hours 
Any severe infection, any bacterial infection requiring treatment with parenteral 
antibiotics or treatment with oral antibiotics for longer than 2 weeks, any clinical 
endoparasitosis, any opportunistic infection, any viral infection requiring antiviral 
treatment 
 Note: Generally, all uncommon, atypical, peculiar, or unusually persistent infections, 
especially viral infections, should be reported as AESI. 
Refer to the study manuals for the procedures to be followed. 
12.6.1.4. Abnormal Laboratory, Vital Signs, or Electrocardiogram Results 
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an 
AE include: 
 the test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or 
 the test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
and/or 
 the test result leads to discontinuation from the study, significant additional 
concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy. 
Contact the medical monitor in the event the investigator feels that an abnormal test finding 
should be reported as an AE, although it does not meet any of the above criteria. 
Repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an 
AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an 
AE. 
12.6.2. Relationship to Study Drug 
An investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to the 
investigational product for each AE (Unrelated, Possibly Related or Probably Related). The 
investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product. If no valid reason 
exists for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “unrelated.” If there is 
any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause-and-effect relationship 
between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be 
considered “related.” 
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined to be 
“possible” or “probable” the event will be considered to be related to the investigational product 
for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting. 
12.6.3. Recording Adverse Events 
Adverse events spontaneously reported by the participant and/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the 
IRL201104 Revolo Biotherapeutics 
Clinical Study Protocol Version 2.0 Study RVLO 121-04 
Confidential Page 51 of 60 investigational study center. Clinically significant changes in laboratory values, blood pressure, 
and pulse need not be reported as AEs. However, abnormal values that constitute an SAE or lead 
to discontinuation of administration of study treatment must be reported and recorded as an AE. 
Information about AEs will be collected from the signing of the consent form until 30 days 
following the last dose of study treatment. Serious AE information will be collected from signing 
of the consent form until 30 days following the last dose of study treatment. The AE term should 
be reported in standard medical terminology when possible. For each AE, the investigator will 
evaluate and report the onset (date and time), resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, 
action taken, serious outcome (if applicable), and whether or not it caused the participant to 
discontinue the study.
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:
 Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
 Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)
 Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities) 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Section 12.6.1.2. An AE of severe intensity 
may not be considered serious. 
12.6.4. Reporting Adverse Events
All SAEs (related and unrelated) will be recorded from the signing of consent form until 30 days 
following the end of treatment exposure. Any SAEs considered possibly or probably related to 
the investigational product and discovered by the investigator at any time after the study should 
be reported. All SAEs must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of the first awareness of 
the event. The investigator must complete, sign, and date the SAE pages, verify the accuracy of 
the information recorded on the SAE pages with the corresponding source documents, and send 
to the sponsor.  
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should all be reported to the sponsor 
within 24 hours of receipt and this should be completed on a follow-up SAE form and placed 
with the original SAE information and kept with the appropriate section of the eCRF and/or 
study file. 
The sponsor is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain events. It is 
the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or 
Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) of all SAEs that occur at his or her study center. 
Investigators will also be notified of all unexpected, serious, drug-related events (7/15 Day 
Safety Reports) that occur during the clinical study. Each study center is responsible for 
notifying its IRB or IEC of these additional SAEs. 
All AEs that lead to a participant’s withdrawal from the study must be reported to the sponsor's 
medical monitor within 30 days. 
Refer to the study manuals for procedures to be followed.

Confidential Page 52 of 60 13. ASSESSMENT OF PHARMACOKINETICS AND
IMMUNOGENICITY 
Samples will be collected pre- and postdose at the time points listed in the Schedule of Events 
(Table 3) for the following assessments: 
 IRL201104 PK concentrations  
 Antidrug antibodies (ADA)   
 Immune cell phenotyping (T-subsets, B-subsets, and macrophage subsets) 
 A20 
Serum cytokines
Serum IgE/IgG4
 Serum EDN 
Immunogenicity variables include ADA status. Results are reported as an optical density (OD) 
unit with a cut-off value. If the OD value is lower than the cut-off value, it is reported as 
negative, and if OD value is higher than the cut-off value it is positive. Participants who are 
assessed as ADA positive at their last study visit (early termination or end of study) will be 
considered for follow-up based on the overall clinical presentation at that time. Participants who 
are identified for follow-up may be asked to return to the clinic to have additional ADA samples 
collected for analysis. 
The PK and immunogenicity assessments will be analyzed by a central laboratory. 
14. RESEARCH SAMPLES 
Research samples (blood/esophageal biopsies) will be collected at time points listed in the 
Schedule of Events (Table 3). 
Use and Storage of Research Samples (Serum/Plasma/Esophageal Biopsies)
Research blood samples and esophageal biopsy samples will be banked and may be used to study 
the effects of the study treatment on target pathway modulation and EoE pathophysiology. 
Stored samples may also be used to discover markers predictive of IRL201104 response as well 
as identify markers associated with toxicity. Details for banking samples will be provided in the 
study manuals. 
Technologies that may be employed include circulating protein marker analyses (eg, 
enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay, electrochemiluminescence), 
immunohistochemistry and/or histology of biopsies, and/or transcriptome analyses of blood 
and/or biopsy samples (eg, microarray, transcriptome sequencing, and/or quantitative reverse 
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction). 
Detailed instructions for sample collection and handling will be provided in the study manuals.

15.1. General Considerations for Data Analysis 
No formal statistical analysis will be conducted for this study. Summary statistics appropriate for 
categorical and continuous variables will be presented by treatment group and all inferences will 
be based on clinical evaluation of those results. A detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be 
prepared that describes the method and style of the data summaries and listings for each 
endpoint. 
15.2. Analysis Populations 
15.2.1. Full Analysis Set
The full analysis set (FAS) will consist of all participants randomized at baseline who receive at 
least one dose of treatment.  
This is the principal data set for the formal evaluation of the primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints at Week 4. Participants will be evaluated based on the treatment group to which they 
were randomized. 
15.2.2. Safety Analysis Set
The safety analysis set will include all participants who were documented to have taken at least 
1 dose of study treatment. Safety evaluations will consider participants according to the actual 
treatment they received.  
15.3. Planned Analysis 
15.3.1. Study Population Analysis 
Demographics and baseline disease characteristics and medical history will be summarized 
descriptively by treatment group. Participant disposition will be summarized, including the 
reasons for discontinuation. The number of participants in each analysis population will be 
displayed and an accounting of exclusions from each study population will be provided. 
15.3.2. Efficacy Analysis
For the primary efficacy endpoint, the change from baseline in histologic eosinophil count in 
each treatment group will be summarized as the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 
and maximum, appropriately presented as defined by the treatment group of interest.  
As a secondary endpoint of interest, number and the proportion of participants with a histologic 
eosinophil count of < 15 eos/hpf will also be summarized for each treatment group. The 
secondary endpoint, DSQ change from baseline, will be summarized in the same manner as the 
primary endpoint.  
For the exploratory EoE-EREFS and EoEHSS endpoints, a categorical summary of the scores 
obtained will be highlighted along with the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum change from baseline. The PGI-S and PGI-C will be summarized categorically and as 
summarized continuous data. Post-baseline evaluation for each PRO measure will be undertaken 
IRL201104 Revolo Biotherapeutics 
Clinical Study Protocol Version 2.0 Study RVLO 121-04 
Confidential Page 54 of 60 as described in the Schedule of Events ( Table 3). The EREFS data will be summarized as the 
frequency and percentage distribution of observed scores within each EREFS domain. 
15.3.3. Safety Analysis 
All on-treatment safety data will be assessed descriptively for AEs, SAEs, clinical laboratory 
measurements, viral serology, vital signs, physical examinations, and ECGs. No formal statistical 
analysis will be performed on safety outcomes; inferences, if any, will be derived through 
clinical review and interpretation.
All TEAEs will be summarized overall and for each body system and preferred term by
treatment group, relationship to investigational product, and severity. For tabulations by severity, 
only a participant’s most severe event within the category (eg, overall, body system, or preferred 
term) will be counted. Adverse events will be dichotomized into “related” (definitely, probably, 
and possibly) and “unrelated” (unlikely and not related). “Treatment-emergent” will be defined 
as starting or worsening after the first dose of investigational product. If the start date is missing, 
the event is assumed to be treatment emergent. All SAEs will be tabulated. 
Vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, respiration rate, and weight 
will be summarized by treatment group at baseline and at each scheduled visit. 
Clinical safety laboratory data will be summarized descriptively by treatment group at baseline 
and at subsequent scheduled visits. Summaries of safety laboratory parameters will include the 
first measurement of each scheduled assessment but repeat assessments done at the same study 
time point will not be included in summary calculations. Laboratory data will also be listed by 
treatment, participant, and visit. Listings will include scheduled, unscheduled, and repeat 
evaluations. A listing of markedly abnormal values, as defined in the SAP, will additionally be 
generated. 
Abnormal physical examination findings that suggest a clinically significant worsening from 
baseline will be reported as AEs and analyzed as such. Clinically significant findings noted prior 
to start of investigational product treatment will be recorded as medical history and analyzed as 
such. 
Concomitant medications will be tabulated by preferred term, and treatment group. For the 
purposes of data collection, a medication’s usage will be considered concomitant if it was started 
within 14 days prior to informed consent and continued after administration of the 
investigational product. If the start date is missing, it will be assumed that the medication was 
used concomitantly. 
15.3.4. Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity Analysis 
Concentrations of IRL201104 will be listed by participant and summarized by treatment group 
and time point from predose to Week 8 based on the safety set. 
Antidrug antibody status (negative or positive based on whether results are lower or higher, 
respectively, than the OD cut-off value) will be listed and summarized by treatment group and 
time point from predose to Week 8based on the safety set. 
Details will be provided in the SAP.

Confidential Page 55 of 60 15.4. Determination of Sample Size
The chosen sample size for this study reflects reasonable clinical expectations of the number of 
participants who could be evaluated in this observational investigation for the purpose of 
obtaining preliminary estimates of histological response to treatment. It also provides for some 
level of accounting of the variability of estimates and the repeatability of results among a small 
group of participants treated in each proposed arm. 
16. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS 
16.1. Study Monitoring 
Before an investigational study center can enter a participant into the study, a representative of 
the sponsor will assess the investigational study center to: 
 Determine the adequacy of the facilities
 Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of the sponsor or its representatives. This will 
be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between the sponsor and the investigator. 
During the study, a monitor from the sponsor or representative will have regular contacts with 
the investigational study center, for the following:  Provide information and support to the investigator(s). 
Confirm that facilities remain acceptable. 
 Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the eCRFs, and that investigational product accountability checks 
are being performed. 
 Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the eCRFs 
with the participant’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records 
relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records or certified 
copies for each participant (eg, clinic charts). 
 Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to the sponsor. 
 Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to the sponsor and those SAEs that met criteria for reporting 
have been forwarded to the IRB. 
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice. 
16.2. Audits and Inspections 
Authorized representatives of the sponsor, a regulatory authority, IEC, or an IRB may visit the 
study center to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of a 
sponsor audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study-related 
activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were 
IRL201104 Revolo Biotherapeutics 
Clinical Study Protocol Version 2.0 Study RVLO 121-04 
Confidential Page 56 of 60 recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, GCP guidelines of the 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH), and any applicable regulatory requirements. The 
investigator should contact the sponsor immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency about an  
inspection. 
16.3. Institutional Review Board 
The Principal Investigator must obtain IRB approval for the investigation. Initial IRB approval, 
and all materials approved by the IRB for this study including the ICF and recruitment materials 
must be maintained by the investigator and made available for inspection. 
17. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements, the sponsor may 
conduct a quality assurance audit. Please see Section 16.2 for more details regarding the audit 
process. 
18. ETHICS 
18.1. Ethics Review 
The final study protocol, including the final version of the ICF, must be approved or given a 
favorable opinion in writing by an IRB or IEC as appropriate. The investigator must submit 
written approval to the sponsor before he or she can enroll any participant into the study. 
The Principal Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB or IEC of any amendment to the 
protocol in accordance with local requirements. In addition, the IRB or IEC must approve all 
advertising used to recruit participants for the study. The protocol must be re-approved by the 
IRB or IEC upon receipt of amendments and annually, as local regulations require. 
The Principal Investigator is also responsible for providing the IRB with reports of any 
reportable serious adverse drug reactions from any other study conducted with the investigational 
product. To the sponsor will provide this information to the Principal Investigator. 
Progress reports and notifications of serious adverse drug reactions will be provided to the IRB 
or IEC according to local regulations and guidelines. 
18.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study 
The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with the ICH/GCP, applicable regulatory requirements 
and the sponsor’s policy on Bioethics. 
18.3. Written Informed Consent 
The Principal Investigator at each center will ensure that the participant is given full and 
adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the 
study. Participants must also be notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any 
IRL201104 Revolo Biotherapeutics 
Clinical Study Protocol Version 2.0 Study RVLO 121-04 
Confidential Page 57 of 60 time. The participant should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to 
consider the information provided. 
The participant’s signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before conducting any 
study procedures. 
The Principal Investigator(s) must maintain the original, signed ICF. A copy of the signed ICF 
must be given to the participant. 
19. DATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEPING
19.1. Inspection of Records 
The sponsor will be allowed to conduct study center visits to the investigational facilities for the 
purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study. The investigator agrees to allow the monitor to 
inspect the drug storage area, study treatment stocks, drug accountability records, participant 
charts and study source documents, and other records relative to study conduct. 
19.2. Retention of Records 
The Principal Investigator must maintain all documentation relating to the study for a period of 
2 years after the last marketing application approval, or if not approved 2 years following the 
discontinuance of the test article for investigation. If it becomes necessary for the sponsor or the 
Regulatory Authority to review any documentation relating to the study, the investigator must 
permit access to such records.
20. PUBLICATION POLICY 
If the data merit, the investigator and the sponsor will discuss the preparation of a manuscript for 
publication in a peer-reviewed professional journal or an abstract for presentation, oral or 
written, to a learned society or symposium. Either party may undertake the task, but both must 
agree to the strategy before the work is started. Each party will allow the other 30 days to 
comment before any results are submitted for publication or presentation. Authorship should 
reflect work done by the investigators and personnel of the sponsor, in accordance with generally 
recognized principles of scientific collaboration.

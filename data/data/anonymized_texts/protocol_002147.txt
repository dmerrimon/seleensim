2.0  Background  Information  
 
2.1  Introduction  and Background   
The recent emergence of  Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cor onavirus (SARS -CoV-2) in 
Wuhan, China in late 2019 and its subsequent spread to the rest of the world has created a pandemic 
situation unprecedented in modern history 1-4. SARS -CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus closely related to 
SARS -CoV; however, significant differences in the Spike glycoprotein (SGP) are present in SARS -
CoV-2 that may drive differences in the attachment and entry process. In SARS -CoV, the SGP binds 
to its cognate receptor, human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The bound virus is then 
endocytosed into the cell, where SGP is acted upon by the endosomal protease TMPRSS2 to allow 
envelope fusion and viral entry.  
While ACE2 has been confidently identified as the viral receptor, many viruses (including some 
betacoronaviruses) will use cellular polysaccharides as cellular attachment co receptors, allowing the 
virus to adhere to the surface of the cell and increasing the local concentration of viral particles to 
increase effective infection rates. Sequence analysis of SGP of SARS -CoV-2 suggest that this virus 
has evolved to have additiona l potential glycosaminoglycan (GAG) binding domains compared to 
SARS -CoV. GAGs are a family of linear sulfated 
polysaccharides found on the surface of virtually all 
mammalian cells, and commonly includes 
chondroitin sulfate (CS) and heparan sulfate (HS). 
Previous studies using isolated SARS -CoV-2 SGP 
monomer or trimer and surface plasmon resonance 
(SPR) have shown that SARS -CoV-2 SGP has high 
affinity to heparin 5-6, a sp ecialized member of the 
HS family that is highly sulfated and commonly used 
clinically as an anti -coagulant drug. It was also 
reported that heparin was capable of inhibiting 
infection of SARS -CoV-2 in Vero cell culture in a 
dose -dependent fashion 6. These results support a 
model  of SARS -CoV-2 attachment and entry 
illustrated in Figure 1 , where SARS -CoV-2 initially 
binds to HS in the nasal epithelium glycocalyx, 
where it then binds hACE2 and is endocytosed.  
Based on this model, disruption of the initial 
interaction between SARS -CoV-2 SGP and HS could be an effective method for preventing COVID -19 
or treating the disease, especially in its earliest stages. Heparin is an FDA -approved drug commonly 
used via intravenous infusion, intravenous injection or deep subcutaneous injection as  an anti -
coagulant, where it acts in the blood to disrupt the coagulation cascade. Heparin has numerous side 
effects, including bleeding and heparin -induced thrombocytopenia, all of which also occur due to 
heparin activity in the blood. Moreover, heparin i s used in COVID -19 treatment where evidence of 
microclotting (such as high D -dimer levels) is present. Because of this, use of heparin as an anti -viral 
through a route of administration that allows for significant distribution to the blood carries risks, 
especially for projected use outside of a closely -observed clinical setting.  
Figure 1: Model of SARS -CoV-2 
attachment and entry.  Binding of virus to 
HS in the glycocalyx increases the local 
concentration of virus, improving binding  to 
hACE2.  
5 
V20 9.1 .2020  Previous studies have examined large doses of heparin via an inhalation route in both humans 7-8 and 
rodents 9 indicate that even very large doses of heparin administered via inhalation has very poor 
serum bioavailability, and no reported toxicity.  These results suggest that COVID -19 treatment by 
heparin via an intranasal or inhalation route could avoid dangerous side effects or complications with 
anti-coagulation treatments while potentially still providing a prophylactic or therapeutic benefit.  
Heparin’s inability to affect blood coagulation when administered intranasally is due to the molecule’s 
large molecular weight which precludes its active and passive transport across the epithelial barrier of 
the nasal passages.   Recent published reports indicate that the nasal epithelium is  a probable major 
portal for initial infection and transmission based on viral loads in both symptomatic and asymptomatic 
patients 10-11, as well as expression patterns of both the hACE2 receptor and the TMPRSS2 protease 
12. This suggests that a self -administered nasal spray of heparin  may be a simple, safe and effective 
prophylactic to lower the rates of SARS -CoV-2 transmission. A previously disclosed patent indicated 
that heparin formulated in 15% ethanol had only 0.02% sy stemic bioavailability 13; this small amount of 
bioavailability is likely due to the presence of the 15% ethanol. S ingle intranasal administration of 
saline heparin  in a rat m odel resulted in no noted toxicity and very poor serum bioavailability 9. We are 
aware of no published studies of repeated dosing of intranasal heparin . 
2.2  Preliminary Studies  
In vitro potency and efficacy.  In order to test the potency and efficacy of hepari n, we developed an 
in vitro  model. We created a pseudotyped third -generation lentiviral system that expresses the SARS -
CoV-2 SGP, which drives cell attachment and entry in SARS -CoV-2. Upon attachment and entry into 
target cells (in this case, HEK293T cells ), the pseudotyped system will drive expression of green 
fluorescent protein (GFP). Therefore, the number of cells that have been infected by the pseudotyped 
virus can be determined by counting the number of cells that fluoresce. Using this assay, we teste d 
the ability of various sulfated polysaccharides, including heparin, to block infection. The results of this 
assay for heparin (160 USP/mg) are shown in Figure 2 . 
Heparin showed high potency, with an IC 50 of 5.99 µg/L (95% CI: 2 .90 – 11.96 µg/L), or 0.96 U/L. 
Based on the average molecular weight of heparin of 15,000 g/mol, this equals an IC 50 of ~4 00 pM. 
This is 10x higher than  the KD of heparin for SARS -CoV-2 SGP measured by surface plasmon 
resonance 5.

Mouse toxicology of intranasally administered heparin  
In order to test the toxicity of repeated intranasally administered doses of heparin, we carried out a 
two-week blinded toxicology study in C57BL/6 mice. Mice were administered 12 µL (6 µL/nostril) of a 
heparin sodium saline formulation identical to the FDA -approved formulation used for deep 
subcutaneous injection (5 mg/mL sodium chloride, 1% benzyl alcohol, pH 5.0 – 7.5, adjusted using 
sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid as needed) . Four groups of six mice each, plus one control 
group of six mice, were used to test heparin. Each group was given 12 µL of heparin daily for two 
weeks at concentrations of 5000 mg/L, 500 mg/L, 50 mg/L or 5 mg/L, with the control group given the 
vehicle. Given the average mouse nasal cavity volume of 32 mm3, this results in a peak nasal cavity 
concentration of 1875 mg/L, well above the highest dose tested in the in vitro  pseudotype study. Mice 
were monitored daily for bleeding, nasal discharge, nose irrita tion or discoloration, and weight loss.  
At the end of the two -week study, the samples were unblinded  and the mice exposed to the highest 
dose were tested for anosmia. All mice were euthanized, and a necropsy was performed to identify 
any gross tissue abnormalities. Blood was used to perform an activated partial thromboplastin time 
(aPTT ) test to look for  anticoagulant activity , as well as look for decreases in platelet count to indicate 
heparin -induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) . In no cases were any evidence of toxicity found at any dose 
tested.   
3.0  Study Objective s 
 This exploratory clinical trial is desi gned to assess tolerability  of increasing doses of intranasally 
administered heparin sodium in saline solution . Baseline values for aPTT and complete blood count 
will be obtained from six subjects . Heparin will be administered in increasing concentrations using 
one 0.1 mL spray per nostril  (0.2 ml total)  on a daily basis. Major signs of toxicity will be clinically 
relevant changes in aPTT time, clinically relevant decrease in platel et count, signs of anosmia  30 
minutes after administration, or epistaxis. Dosing will start at 1000 units of heparin  administered  (500 
U in each nostril ) and then  escalated to 2000 units . Signs of toxicity include  a clinically relevant aPTT 
time (> 90s) or decrease in platelet count (below clinical lab normal limit).  Tolerance of each dose 
during the acute phase will be used to determine the dose tested for a 14 -day self -administered 
chronic phase to determine any adverse effects of repeated dosing.  
4.0  Study Overview  
4.1 Description of Design of Study  
This study is a single center, prospective , Phase 0 exploratory tolerability t rial.  A total of 6 healthy 
subjects  (3 M and 3 F)  will be enrolled in to the study. This study will evaluate the acute and multi -day 
(14 days) tolerability of intranasally administered heparin . 
5.0 Test Article  
5.1 Investigational Product  
 
The study will assess the single and multi -dose tolerability  of intranasal administration of an aliquot 
of an  FDA-approved heparin sodium injection  (5,000 USP units/mL or 10,000 USP units/m L) to 
deliver 1000U or 2000U of heparin sodium .  Doses will be prepared and administered as follows:  
1000 U = (2 x 0.1 mL of 5000U /mL or one spray of 500 U in each nostril)  
2000 U = (2 x 0.1 mL of 10000U /mL or one spray of 1000 U in each nostril)   
 
In order to minimize the need for formulation stability testing, we are limiting our studies to 
formulations of heparin currently FDA -approved for administration by injection. In order to maximize 
patient compliance f or self -administration, we are testing formulations that require only a single 100 
µL spray per nostril. Heparin sodium injection is currently available in concentrations up to 10,000 
units/mL, or 1,000 units/spray. As the formulation is liquid, we decided  that nasal cavity volume was 
the appropriate measure to determine tolerable concentration. Our initial mouse studies found that 
7 
V20 9.1 .2020  doses up to 337.5 U of heparin per cubic centimeter of nasal cavity volume each day were tolerated 
for the entire 14 days of th e study, based on an average mouse nasal cavity volume of 32 mm3 14. In 
humans, this corresponds to a dose of up to  7,155 U/day based on an average human nasal cavity 
volume of 21.2 cm3 15, well above the maximum dose for a single spray per nostril at the highest 
available heparin concentration (2,000 U/day).  
Our pharmacok inetic goal was to maintain a concentration of heparin ≥ 0.267 U/cm3 nasal cavity 
volume for at least eight hours (preferably twelve hours).  In vivo  imaging studies in a mouse model 
indicate that between 1% and 4% of the applied 2.67 U dose remained in the  nasal cavity after 
twelve hours. If this elimination model holds in humans, a 1000 U dose (the lower dose to be 
tested) would results in a concentration between 0.47 and 1.89 U/cm3 nasal cavity volume after 
twelve hours, meeting our pharmacokinetic goal. The next lower concentration of heparin currently 
commercially available (1000 U/mL, or a 200 U dose), would result in a lower range of retained 
concentration below our target concentration after twelve hours (0.094 to 0.378 U/cm3). Both the 
1000 U dose (4 7.2 U heparin per cm3 nasal cavity volume) and the 2000 U dose (94.3 U heparin 
per cm3 nasal cavity volume) are well below our highest tested and tolerated dose in mice of 337.5 
U heparin per cm3 nasal cavity volume, and represent the highest two doses tha t can be achieved 
from a single 100 µL spray per nostril of currently available FDA -approved heparin sodium 
formulations.  
 
5.3 Labeling of Investigational Product

 5.4 Supplier  
 The test article  (Heparin Sodium USP) will be obtained from UM Pharmacy Health Services.    
 
  5.4.1  Preparation of Investigational Product  
NCNPR personnel will prepare the investigational product within a Class II Type A2 
biosafety cabinet in the clinical laboratory where the study will take place.  

9 
V20 9.1 .2020   
The test article will be prepared by transferring (4 mL) of sterile heparin sodium injection 
(5,000 USP units/mL or 10,000 USP units/mL) at ambient room temperature into 
intranasal spray bottles, one bottle for each individual subject. The sprayer has been 
verified to dispense 100 ± 20 µL heparin per spray  before delivery of the test article to 
subjects . The ability of the sprayer to dispense the appropriate 100 µL of heparin per 
spray has been tested by weighing the bottle before and after dispensing and using the 
change in mass to determine the amount of heparin dispensed ( 92± 8  uL/spray).  
 
The test article will be administered within 4 weeks of preparation, and the remainder 
discarded after study completion.  
6.0  Study Population  
This study will be conducted in healthy  volunteers,  that are not  currently taking prescription anti-
coagulants or blood thinners, not currently taking any nasal medication, and that have no symptoms 
of COVID -19. 
 
An equal number of males and females will be included in this study.  Racial distribution within this 
protocol is expected to reflect the racial distribution of the campus of the University of Mississippi, 
residents of the city of Oxford, MS, Lafayette County, MS or the surrounding counties in northeast 
Mississippi.  The student body of the University of Mississippi, the population of Oxford , Lafayette 
County, and surrounding counties is predominately Caucasian (72%) with a large minority of African -
Americans (24%), Asians (2%) and Hispanics (2%).  Attempts will be made to recruit subjects of all 
ethnicities; however, actual racial distributi on will be dependent upon personal choice of each subject.  
 
The University currently has more than 23,000 students (undergraduate and graduate) enrolled with 
faculty and staff totaling almost 1,600. Lafayette County has a population of approximately 50,000 . 
Advertisements, both print and media (email, campus intranet, and social media), will be used to inform

9.0  Safety Assessments  
Safety assessments will be completed as part of this single and  multi -dose study.  Safety will be 
assessed prior to test article administration and at 24 , 48 and 72 hours post dose, in the acute phase. 
For the chronic phase, safety asssessments will be as sessed prior to test article administration and on 
days 14, 15, and 30. Each subject will be called every three (3) days for updates and subjective reports 
(adverse events).  Subject safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events, clinical laboratory  
tests, vital signs, and physical examinations.  
 
Throughout the study l aboratory values will be monitored closely by the Investigator and study Physician 
to detect changes induced by the test article. Subjects with an aPTT value of 60 seconds or greater 
(normal range is 30 -40 seconds) will not recieve the initial daily dose (one 0.1 mL spray of heparin nasal 
solution in each nostril to deliver a total dose of 1000U [500U per nostril/0.1mL per nostril to equal total 
dose of 0.2mL]), OR  proceed to dose 2 (o ne 0.1 mL spray of heparin nasal solution in each nostril to 
deliver a total dose of 2000U [1000U/0.1mL per nostril to equal total dose of 0.2mL]) , in the acute phase.  
  
In the multi -day, or chronic phase, each individual test subject’s dose will be based on the highest acute 
dose received that produced no clinically relevant impact on aPTT  (i.e., aPTT ≤ 90 seconds). This 
dose (1000U or 2000U) will be used for the multi -day phase of this study.  
 
 9.1 Vital  Signs 
 Vital signs  (temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressur e, heart rate, SpO2) will 
be collected prior to the initiation of the test article  and with the Safety 
assessment visits at 24, 48 and 72 hours post dose, in the acute phase. During 
the chronic phase, vital sig ns will be assessed prior to test art icle administration, 
and on  days 14, 15, 30-post per study RN.  
 
9.2 Physical Examination  
 A physical examination will be performed during the screening period, prior to 
test article initiation, and post study visit , per Study RN & MD.   
 
 
9.3 Laboratory Parameters  
 Laboratory parameters will be evaluated during screeni ng and daily, to include 
the following:  
 Complete Blood Count (WBC, RBC, Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, MCV, Plate let 
Count)  
 
 aPTT  
 
17 
V20 9.1 .2020   PT/INR (b aseline and post  study  assessments)  
 
 Serum  hCG baseline assessment only  
 
 Urine hCG prior to each in clinic dose  
10.0  Blood Sample Processing  
 
  10.1 Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT )  
 Blood samples for aPTT will be collected at baseline, prior to single dose,  24, 48,  
 and 72 -hours post dose, and again pre multi -day dose, and days 14, 15 and 30   
 
   10.2 Collection and Processing of Blood Samples  
For aPTT assessment, 3mL of venous blood will be collected and will be determined 
per Lab Corp before and at 24 , 48, and 72 hours after each heparin administration 
as well as pre multi -day dosing, and on days 14, 15, and 30.  
 
For Safety Assessments (CBC  & Other studies -see section 9.3 ),4 mls of venous 
blood will be collected in appropriate vacutainer and stored as per Lab processing 
sight specifications.  These specimens will  be sent off site for analysis.   
 
 
 
11.0  Adverse /Serious Adverse  Events  
 
 11.1  Clinical Adverse Event s 
Clinical Adverse Events will be monitored throughout the study. However, such events 
are not anticipated during this trial due to the low systemic exposure of the test article  
being administered.  However, local side effects  of intranasal heparin , such as  epistaxis 
or nasal congestion may result .  
   
For any a bnormal lab values , test subjects  will be evaluated for any sign and symptoms, 
and labs will be redraw n, until stabilized or returned to baseline . Subjects will be referred 
to the primary p hysician for  any continued care required.  
 
In the event of an Emergency, there will be an onsite RN for  the duration of the study, the  
study Physician will present on the day of dosing. The us e of e mergency equipment  
(defibrillator) and 911 would be used as necessary,  deemed prudent by study physician  
and investigators.  
 
Unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others that 
occur during the course of this study (including SAEs) will be reported to the IRB.  AEs 
that are not serious b ut that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be 
summarized in narrative or other format and submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing 
review.  
 
 11.2  Adverse Event  Reporting  
AE’s will be monitored and recorded in the source document to include the description of 
the event, onset date, stop date, and outcome. The subjects will be instructed to inform 
the study personnel  or clinical staff of any AEs  experienced during the trial.  In addition, 
subject safety will be assessed by monitoring clinical laboratory tests, vital signs  and 
physical examinations.  Any subject who has an AE will be evaluated by the investigator 
and will be treated accordingly. The designated study physician  will review each event 
and assess its relationship to the drug treatment.  
18 
V20 9.1 .2020   
  11.2.1 Time -Frame for Reporting  
Under 21 CFR 312.32(c), the Principal Investigator will notify the FDA within 7 
calendar days an event that meets all three definitions of a suspected adverse 
reaction, serious adverse reaction and unexpected adverse reaction via a secure 
e-mail account with the FDA. The Principal Investigator will evaluate the a vailable 
information and decide whether there is a reasonable possib ility that the test 
article causes the adverse event, and therefore, that the e vent meets the 
definition of suspected adverse reaction. In addition, the investigat or will identify 
in each IND safety report all IND safety reports previously submitted to the  FDA 
concerning  a similar suspected adverse reaction in light of previous , similar 
reports of any other relevant information. As per 21 CFR part 312, t he 
investigator will conduct ongoing safety evaluations, including a periodic review 
and ana lyses of the entire safety d atabase, not only for IND safety reporting 
purposes, but also to update investigator brochures, protocols, and consent 
forms with new safety information.  
 
   11.2.2 Regulatory  Reporting  
 Reporting of SAEs by the Investigator to the IRB will be done in acco rdance with 
the standard operating procedures and policies of the IRB. Adequate 
documentation will be maintained showing that the IRB was properly notified  
 
 11.3  Follow -Up of Adverse Events  
Any SAE or AE assessed after  the last dose of the test article  will be followed until either 
resolution of the event or determination by the Investigator that the event has become 
stable or irreversib le. Follow -up data concerning reported SAE must also be  
 reported to the FDA.  
12.0  Discontinuation and Replacement of Subjects  
    12.1  Discontinuation  
Subject(s) may be discontinued from study at any time if the subject or the investigator is 
of the opinion that continuing participation in the study is not in the interest of the subject . 
Subjects on their own may withdraw from study with reason or without  providing any 
reason.  If reasons for subject withdrawal from study is known, such reasons shall be 
documented.  
 Other reasons why subject s may be withdrawn from study include:  
1. Subject withdrawal of consent  
2. Subject not adhering to study plan  
3. University request for study termination  
4. Changes in subject’s condition that meets exclusion criteria, e.g. pregnancy  
5. If withdrawn from study due to adverse events, subject(s) will be treated by the   
  investigators and monitored till adverse effects are resolved.  
 
 12.2  Replacement  
Subjects who withdraw from the study may be replaced if so considered by the 
investigators, by another qualified subject.   
13.0  Data Handling and Record Keeping  
In compliance with ICH guidelines, the investigator will maintain copies of all source documents that 
support data collected from each patient and all study documents as specified in ICH Section 8, 
Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial. The investigator will take measures to prevent 
accidental or premature destruction of these documents.

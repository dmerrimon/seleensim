EX-MKTG -145 ECLIPSE Protocol v 1.1 23 Feb2023 9 2 INTRODUCTION  
Eye care professionals recommended daily disposable (DD) contact lenses  to their patients quite 
frequently today to  avoid the use of a lens cleaning product and in some circumstances  to reduce 
symptoms of dryness and discomfort .1 As a result, DD lenses account for 45% of all soft lens fits 
today.2 
More silicone hydrogel (SiHy) l ens materials with  high oxygen- permeability  become available in 
DD lens  designs and the goal of this study  is to compare the performance of  MyDay , a SiHy DD 
lens from CooperVision  Inc., which has successfully been established on the market with  
ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1 -Day, a DD SiHy lens recently launched by Johnson & Johnson Inc.   
3 OBJECTIVES  
To evaluate and compare the performance of MyDay (CONTROL) (CooperVision Inc) and 
ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1 -Day (TEST ) (Johnson & Johnson) in existing soft lens (CL) wearers 
over one week of wear . 
The prim ary outcome variable for this study is: 
• Lens handling on removal collected on Day 6 on the at -home ratings (0 -100 
scale) .   
4 HYPOTHESIS  
The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference for  lens handling on removal on Day 6 (At -
home ratings, 0 -100 scale) between CONTROL compared to TEST lens.  
5 MATERIALS AND METHODS  
5.1 STUDY DESIGN  
5.1.1 OVERALL DESIGN 
This study is a prospective, bilateral eye, double- masked, randomized, 1- week cross -over, daily -
wear design involving two different daily disposable lens types. Each lens  type will be worn for 
approximately one week, during which participants record their subjective lens -wear experience 
on three different days.  
EX-MKTG -145 ECLIPSE Protocol v 1.1 23 Feb2023 10 5.1.2 RANDOMIZATION  
A randomization schedule will determine the order of CONTROL and TEST CL wear for the 
first/second week  for each participant . Participants  will be randomize d immediately prior to their 
first lens dispense.  
This randomization schedule will be generated for each site using a web- based program: 
(www.randomization.com ). The lens type that will be worn during the first week is called “ Lens 
type #1”, the lens type dispended for the second week is called “ Lens type  #2”. The final study 
randomization schedule will be generated by CORE ’s Database Administrator  and provided to 
the research assistants at each site.  
5.1.3 MASKING  
This study will be double masked i.e. participants and investigators will be masked to the lens 
type dispensed. In order to achieve this, unmasked research assistants will determine the lens order according to the randomization schedule (see section 5.1.2) and will over- label the lens 
packages/foils prior to dispense by placing strongly adhesive stickers on the packages/foils to 
mask the participant and investigator to the lens brand.  At the fitting visit both lens types will be 
fit, but only the participant can be masked to the lens type during this process because the 
investigator needs to know which type is being fit in order to follow the fitting guide when making changes to the lens. During the lens wear phases both investigators and participant s will be 
masked.  
5.2 INVESTIGATIONAL  SITES  
5.2.1 NUMBER OF SITES  
This study will be conducted at 4 optometry practice sites in the USA and Canada.    
 
5.2.2 INVESTIGATOR RECRUITMENT  
The principal investigator at each site will be required to fulfil the following criteria: 
• Is a l icensed eye care professional  with at least two years of contact lens fitting 
experience.  
• Can demonstrate training in Good Clinical Practice (GCP) by the already trained 
principal investigator.  
• Accepts responsibility for the conduct of the study at their site.  
• Has in- office email and document scanning capabilities.  
EX-MKTG -145 ECLIPSE Protocol v 1.1 23 Feb2023 11 • Will scan and send all study visit documents to CORE, ideally the same day* as the 
visit or at most within 2 days of the study visit.  
• Is willing  to follow the study protocol and to co- operate with the study monitors  at 
CORE . 
* Study documents are required as soon as possible because this allows a timely data review, 
query and entry.  
5.3 STUDY POPULATION 
5.3.1 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION  
The sample size calculation was based on “ lens handling at removal ” using historical data at 1 
week in which participant s used a 0- 100 scale (10 0 being best).  
A sample size of  64 is required to detect a mean difference in “ handling at removal ” of 10 units on 
a 0 to 100 scale using a standard deviation of the paired differences of 24.2 with 90% power and 
alpha 0.05 in a two -tailed t -test. Therefore, up to 73  participants will be dispensed with study 
products with the goal to complete at least 64.  
 

EX-MKTG -145 ECLIPSE Protocol v 1.1 23 Feb2023 12  
Figure 1: Sample size calcu lation graph 
 
 
5.3.2 NUMBER OF PAR T ICIPANTS  
Participants will be recruited using site records, databases and advertising materials (eg. 
posters, email scripts) approved by the ethics  review board. All initial individual -targeted 
recruitment activities, such as any direct mailing of recruitment scripts, will be conducted by practice staff that are not directly involved in conducting the research. This separation will reduce any undue influence of the optometrist -patient relationship. This process will also 
eliminate opportunity for the investigator to access personal health information before any consent for disclosure is provided by the potential participant.  
It is anticipated that up to 73 potential participants may attend a Screening visit and up to 70 
participants may be randomized and dispensed with study products, with a target of at least 64 
completing the study.  
 
5.3.3 INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
A person is eligible for inclusion in the study if he/she:  
1. Is between 18 and 35 years of age (inclusively) and has full legal capacity to volunteer;  

EX-MKTG -145 ECLIPSE Protocol v 1.1 23 Feb2023 13 2. Has read and signed an information consent letter; 
3. Self-reports having a full eye examination in the previous two years;  
4. Anticipates being able to wear the study lenses for at least 8 hours a day, 7 days a week;  
5. Is willing and able to follow instructions and maintain the appointment schedule;  
6. Habitual ly wears  soft contact lens es, for the past 3 months minimum;  
a. No more than 1/3 of participants  should be habitual wearer of MyDay or MyDay 
Energys  
b. No more than 1/3 of participants should be habitual wearer of ACUVUE® OASYS 
MAX 1-Day or ACUVUE® OASYS 1 -Day. 
7. Has refractive astigmatism no higher than -0.75DC in each eye;  
8. Can be fit and achieve binocular distance vision of at least 20/30 Snellen (Available lens 
parameters are sphere -1.00 to -6.00D, 0.25D steps ). 
 
A person will be excluded from the study if he/she:  
1. Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research study;  
2. Has any known active* ocular disease and/or infection that contraindicates contact lens wear;  
3. Has a systemic condition that in the opinion of the investigator may affect a study outcome variable;  
4. Is using any systemic or topical medications that in the opinion of the investigator may affect contact lens wear or a study outcome variable;  
5. Has known sensitivity to the diagnostic sodium fluorescein used in the study;  
6. Self-reports as pregnant, lactating  or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrolment; 
7. Has undergone refractive error surgery or intraocular surgery.  
* 
For the purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as infection or inflammation which 
requires therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered clinically relevant) lid abnormalities (blepharitis, 
meibomian gland dysfunction, papillae), corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered 
active ocular disease. Neovascularization and corneal scars are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or inflammation and are therefore not active.  
 
Pregnant and lactating women are not being excluded from the study due to safety  concerns but 
due to fl uctuations in refractive error, accommodation and/ or visual acuity that  occur secondary 
to systemic hormonal changes  and water retention. It has further been shown that pregnancy 
EX-MKTG -145 ECLIPSE Protocol v 1.1 23 Feb2023 14 could impact tear production, which could impact dry eye  symptoms. Such fl uctuations could 
affect data, thereby negatively affecting  study data integrity.  
5.4 STUDY MATERIALS  
Each site will be provided with an inventory of the CONTROL lens which will be used for fitting 
and dispensing the CONTROL lens.   
For the TEST lens,  the clinical sites will pre -order two packs of 30 CL in each prescription in the 
range -1.00 to - 6.00 inclusively in 0.25D steps for the use in this study. These lenses will be 
used for fitting and dispensing the TEST lens . Reimbursement to practice sites for study product 
expenses  for the TEST lens  will be provided by CooperVision, after CORE has reconciled the 
invoices . 
CORE will provide all sites with the study paperwork. This  will include participant informed 
consent letters and study data collection forms, product accountability logs and the par ticipant 
dispensing logs. CORE will train site personnel to complete the forms correctly and provide continued support to answer queries on correct form completion.

8. The participant will remove the lenses.  
9.  
10. Continue with Study Exit.  
 
5.5.6 STUDY EXIT  
The study exit form will be completed when a participant exits the study. This form will be 
completed either at study completion, or if the participant is discontinued from the study at another time. A study exit form must be completed for all participants who have taken a study ID number. If in the opinion of the investigator post -study follow -up visits are required, the exit form will be 
completed after the last follow -up visit.  
Exit visual acuity will be recorded with either the participant’s spectacles, refraction or habitual 
contact lenses. An exit biomicroscopy assessment will be conducted if not already completed on the same day for a concurrent study visit.  
After the  exit assessments have been completed, the participant and investigator will complete 
the study completion and remuneration forms. At this time the participant will be considered as 
having exited the study.  
 
5.5.7 UNSCHEDULED VISITS  
An unscheduled visit is defined as an interim visit requested by the participant  or investigator 
due to an unanticipated problem. Data recorded at these visits will be entered into the database. 
Only relevant and applicable unscheduled visit information will be included in the final report as deemed necessary.  
 
5.6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
Table 4 summarizes  the procedures conducted at each visit.

6 MONITORING PROTOCOL ADHERENCE  
Adherence to study visit windows, lens wearing schedule, and time windows around other data 
collection points (i.e. subjective ratings) will be monitored by CORE. Deviations from the study 
plan as  described in the protocol will be reported in the study report. As described in Section 13.4, 
major protocol deviations will be reported to the Sponsor and Sterling Institutional Review Board  
within 10 days of becoming aware of them (as per Sterling Institutional Review Board  guidelines) .  
7 POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS TO HUMAN PARTICIPANTS 
There may be no direct benefits to the subjects in this study. Participation in a study may contribute to scientific research information that may be used in the development of new contact lens products. The subjects will receive an examination of the front part of their eyes  and may 
have the opportunity to try a different type of soft contact lenses and/or different lens care products at no cost to them. The contact lens materials used in this study are commercially available as daily wear. This study will investigate partici pants’ wearing schedule intended for 
daily wear (NOT extended wear), similar to the average wearing time of 10 -16 hours for daily 
wear lenses.  
All lenses used in this study are IDE exempt under 21 CFR 812.2(c)2.  
The habitual lens and the two study contact  lens types will be worn as per their approved use; 
on a daily wear, daily disposable basis. When contact lenses are worn on a daily wear basis there is a small risk of an adverse event compared to not wearing contact lenses. When contact lenses are worn on an extended wear basis, there is a significantly increased risk of an adverse reaction compared with wearing contact lenses on a daily wear basis.  
Adverse events and/ or complications in daily wear of  soft contact lenses can occur  (eg: 
inflammation and i nfection).  Complications that may occur during the wearing of contact lenses 

EX-MKTG -145 ECLIPSE Protocol v 1.1 23 Feb2023 24 include discomfort, dryness, aching or itching eyes, excessive tearing, discharge, hyperemia and 
variable or blurred vision.  More serious risks may include pain, photophobia, iritis, corneal edema or eye infection. Although contact lens -related infections are very infrequent, the 
possibility does exist.  The incidence of infection due to day -wear soft lenses is 0.035%. Almost 
always an infection will occur only in one eye.  This r isk is assumed by 35 -million Americans who 
currently wear contact lenses and only current soft lens wearers will be recruited for this study.  
A dye (fluorescein) normally used for eye examinations is being used in this study. Although rare, it is possible  to have an allergic reaction to the dye. Participants will be asked if they  have  a 
known allergy or sensitivity to fluorescein. 
The assessments conducted in this study are r outine clinical procedures  and they includ e auto-
refraction, auto- keratometry, visual acuity, anterior ocular health assessment, and contact lens 
fitting will be used. In addition, high magnification imaging of the lens fit may be made using 35 
mm or digital cameras . Patients will be monitored frequently  until the end of the study to reduce 
the occurrence of adverse or potential adverse events. Patients will be given instructions from 
their investigator regarding early symptoms and signs of adverse events.  
8 ADVERSE EVENTS  
See CORE SOP012 for a description of all adverse events, including management and reporting.  
An ‘adverse event’ refers to any undesirable clinical occurrence in a participant, whether it is considered to be device -related or not. Adverse events (AE) may be classified as ‘unanticipat ed 
adverse device effects,’ ‘serious adverse events,’ ‘significant adverse events,’ or ‘non- significant 
adverse events,’ as defined below , Table 5.  
A number of conditions may result in temporary suspension until resolution. These include corneal infiltrates, corneal staining, limbal injection, bulbar injection or tarsal conjunctival abnormalities.  
EX-MKTG -145 ECLIPSE Protocol v 1.1 23 Feb2023 27 for each adverse  event. If both eyes are involved, a separate adverse event form will be completed 
for each eye . Whenever possible, the adverse event will be photo -documented.  
Expenses incurred for medical treatment as part of study participation will be paid by the sponsor 
(bills and prescription receipts kept). The participant must be followed until resolution or no further change is anticipated and/or referred for further care with the appropriate health care professional and/or recorded as being under appropriate health care as per investigator’s discretion. A written 
report will be completed indicating the subsequent treatment and resolution of the condition.  
8.3 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
All potential Serious and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects that are related or possibly related 
to participant’s participation will be reported to CORE’s lead study coordinator  (details below) and 
also to the sponsor (details below) within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event. 
The site’s Principal Investigator will also report the event to Sterling IRB within 10 days of becoming aware of the Serious or Unanticipated event, using the Reportable Events Form. All fatal or life -threatening events will be reported immediately to the IRB , CORE and the sponsor . 
Adverse Events will be reported to CORE’s lead study coordinator  and the sponsor as soon as 
possible, but no later than 5 working days after the occurrence.  Each site’s Principal Investigator 
will report the event to the IRB  as per IRB requirements  (by fax, mail/delivery, phone, or email).  
 
Details of
 all adverse events will be included in the study report. 

EX-MKTG -145 ECLIPSE Protocol v 1.1 23 Feb2023 28 9 DISCONTINUATION FROM THE STUDY  
Participants may be discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor in consideration 
of participant safety or protocol compliance, or at discretion of the participant. Participants discontinued from a study will be reimbursed per visit for th eir active involvement in the study 
(including the initial screening visit  and all lens fitting visits) . Upon discontinuing, a participant will 
be offered the option of their data being withdrawn from future statistical analysis. The following 
is a list of possible reasons for discontinuation from the study:  
• Screening failure: Participants will be discontinued if they do not meet the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria outlined in section 5.2.3. 
• Unacceptable performance with products to be used in study: Participants may be discontinued if they are unable to achieve acceptable comfort and /or vision with the study products.  
• Positive slit lamp finding:  Participants may be permanently discontinued from the study depending on the severity of the condition and on the judgement of the investigator.   
• Adverse event: If a participant experiences an adverse event during the study they may be discontinued based on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
• Symptoms: If the participant has persistent symptoms they may be discontinued based 
on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
• Disinterest, relocation or illness: The participant may choose to discontinue due to 
reasons within or beyond their control.  
• Violation of protocol or non- compliance:  The participant will be discontinued if they are 
unable or unwilling to follow the protocol specified visit schedules and/or study 
procedures.  
• Instillation of topical ocular medication:  The participant will be discontinued if they elect 
to use a topical ocular medication during the study unless that topical ocular medication is prescribed for a limited duration (less than two weeks) to treat a transient condition; in this case the participant may remain an active participant (at the discretion of the investigator) after  stopping topical ocular medication following resolution of the ocular 
condition).  
EX-MKTG -145 ECLIPSE Protocol v 1.1 23 Feb2023 29 • Lost to follow -up:  The participant will be discontinued if they cannot be contacted and do 
not return to complete the final study exit, and if the investigator has made a r easonable 
effort to contact the participant for a final study visit.  
• Premature termination of the study by the sponsor, CORE or Sterling IRB.  
A discontinuation form, stating the reason for discontinuation will be completed, which requires 
the signatures of  both the participant and the investigator except where the participant is lost to 
follow- up in which case only the signature of the investigator is required.    
When a participant choses to discontinue from the study they will be given the opportunity to 
withdraw their data from the statistical analysis. This choice will be captured on the discontinuation 
form.  
All discontinuations including their reasons will be included in the final report.  
10 DEVICE MALFUNCTIONS  
A device malfunction means the failure of the device to meet its performance specification or 
otherwise perform as intended. Any defective lens that is  likely to cause or contribute to a  Serious 
Adverse Event should be reported to CORE  and the sponsor within 24 hours  of the investigator 
becoming awar e of the malfunction. Sterling IRB would also be notified within 24 hours of any 
device malfunction that may contribute to a  Serious Adverse Event . 
Other defective lenses should be reported to CORE as soon as possible (usually in weekly study 
updates).  
This clinical study will also ascertain satisfaction or preference with subjective attributes such as comfort, vision, or lens handling. Responses to these subjective questionnaires will not be 
considered as complaints or device malfunctions. 
11 STUDY COMPLETION AND REMUNERATION 
At the last scheduled protocol visit a study completion form will be completed, which requires the 
signatures of both the participant and the investigator.  Participants will also be provided with a letter of appreciation.    
Once their involvement in the study is complete, participants will be informed about receiving feedback following study completion in the Let ter of Appreciation. 
Participant remuneration will be paid as per site contract . 
EX-MKTG -145 ECLIPSE Protocol v 1.1 23 Feb2023 31 12.2 DATA MANAGEMENT  
Data will be collected and written on paper forms which will be provided to each site by CORE. 
Each site will be instructed to send completed study forms to CORE using a secure file share 
system operated by the University of Waterloo called Sendit which uses 128bit (or 256bit)  SSL 
encryption . The sites will receive their individual accounts and passwords.   
The site will endeavour to send the scanned forms to CORE on the same day as the study 
visit or a maximu m of two days after the study visit.  
Within CORE, d ata will be entered into a REDCap database developed and tested specifically 
for this study and accessible only to trained, authorised users. A data management plan will be 
developed to describe the data h andling in more detail, including the personnel involved.  
Data from this study will be retained by CORE for a minimum of 25 years on a password-protected server. After 25 years, data will be disposed of in accordance with the guidelines laid out by the University of Waterloo. More details regarding storage procedures are provided in section 15.7 and also in CORE SOP014 Clinical data management.  
At the completion of the study CORE will provide a copy of the study database in Excel format to 
the sponsor when requested. Data will typically be sent using Sendit. This system provides a 
secure way to transfer files when email is not appropriate, whether because of file size, file type or concerns over security. Sendit includes features such as password protection,  a restricted 
time period for download, IP logging and email notification of download.  Files may be encrypted 
prior to transmission at the request of the sponsor. Using this method means that data files are only stored on University of Waterloo servers during the transfer .  
12.3 COMMENTS ON SOURCE DOCUMENTS  
Data analysis will not be conducted on comments which have been recorded in the source documents. Only relevant and applicable comments will be included in the final report as 
deemed necessary by CORE’s Lead Co -ordinator.  
13 PROTOCOL & OTHER TRAINING  
All study personnel will be required to complete training prior to their involvement in the study. 
This will include training by CORE on the study protocol, study procedures, informed consent procedures, and on the randomization and participant masking procedures, as well as training for Good Clinical Practice.  
EX-MKTG -145 ECLIPSE Protocol v 1.1 23 Feb2023 32 All site Principal Investigators and co -investigators will provide a scan of their curriculum vitae, 
license to practice optometry and evidence of professional indemnity insurance. Additional 
training and site qualification may be required as indicated by the sponsor.  
14 STUDY MONITORING  
Each site will provide regular status reports to CORE. Status reports will include:  
• The number of participants screened, enrolled, and randomized (i.e. assigned a study ID 
number), discontinued and completed.  
• Details of all protocol deviations, adverse events, device malfunctions . 
• Reports of unintended events.  
CORE will collate the site updates and provide 2 -weekly status reports to the study sponsor.  
Study monitor ing visits to the sites may be conducted by CORE, the sponsor, or sponsor’s 
designate, throughout the study and will be scheduled in conjunction with the Principal 
Investigator at each site. In addition study records may be inspected by the sponsor, the 
sponsor's designate, Sterling Institutional Review Board, and by regulatory authorities in Canada 
and the United States, namely Health Canada and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA); however, they will not be permitted to take away any recor ds containing 
identifiable personal information.  
Study data review and data monitoring will be conducted by CORE personnel. To improve data integrity, data entry will be conducted by one person and a second person will visually compare the data entry to the source documents.  Data queries will be reported to the site within 5 working 
days of receipt of initial data. A response resolving the query will be expected from the site within 5 working days of receipt of the query.  
All adverse events and protocol deviations will be reviewed by the site Principal Investigator and CORE’s Lead Coordinator. All serious adverse events and major protocol deviations will be reviewed by the site Principal Investigator and CORE’s Director and/or Head of Clinical Research.

15.4 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
Protocol deviations are unanticipated or unintentional changes to a study after it has received 
prior sponsor approval and ethics clearance. Protocol deviations can be major or minor.  
15.4.1  MAJOR PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
Major protocol deviations may impact the research protocol, information consent document or 
other study materials, usually cannot be anticipated ahead of time and are often necessary to 
ensure the safety and welfare of the participants.  
EX-MKTG -145 ECLIPSE Protocol v 1.1 23 Feb2023 34 The following are examples of major (significant) protocol deviations:  
• Changes in procedures initiated to eliminate immediate risks/hazards to participants;  
• Enrollment of participants outside the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria whether agreed 
to or not by the sponsor;  
• Medication / device / intervention errors (i.e. incorrect drug or dosage of drug / incorrect 
contact lens(es) dispensed / incorrect care system dispensed); 
• Inadvertent deviation in specific research intervention procedures or timing of the research intervention which could impact upon the safety or efficacy of the study -related 
intervention or upon the experimental design;  
• Information consent documentation violations: no documentation of informed consent; incorrect version of, or incomplete, informed consent documentation used.  
15.4.2  MINOR PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
The following are examples of protocol deviations that are typically considered minor:  
• Logistical or administrative aspects of the study (e.g., study participant missed appointment, change in appointment date);  
• Inadvertent deviation in specific research intervention procedures or timing of the 
research intervention which would not impact upon the safety or efficacy of the study -
related intervention or upon the experimental design (i.e., missing a measurement during a session that is not considered critical for the st udy).  
15.4.3  REPORTING AND DOCUMENTING PROTCOL DEVIATIONS  
Major protocol deviations must be reported to the Sterling Institutional Review Board within 10  
days  of the deviation occurring (or its discovery) using the Reportable Events Form. To facilitate 
timely re porting to the sponsor, all sites must notify CORE of a major protocol deviation as soon 
as possible.  
All protocol deviations (major and minor) occurring during the study will be documented and included in the final report . 
15.5 PREMATURE TERMINATION OF THE STU DY 
The sponsor, CORE  or Sterling Institutional Review Board may terminate the study at any time 
for any reason.  
EX-MKTG -145 ECLIPSE Protocol v 1.1 23 Feb2023 35 15.6 STUDY PARTICIPANT RECORDS

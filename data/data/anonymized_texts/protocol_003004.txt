2 of 54  SUMMARY  
Indication:  
This trial will enroll subjects who received tremelimumab (prev iously known as CP-275,206) 
in other trials and are no longer going to receive tremelimumab  in the other trial.  
Rationale:  
Tremelimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody. It binds to the CTLA4 molecule, 
which is expressed on the surface of activated T lymphocytes. T he binding of CTLA4 to its 
target ligands (B7-1 and B7-2) pr ovides a negative regulatory s ignal, which limits T-cell 
activation.  Tremelimumab antagonizes binding of CTLA4 to B7 li gands and enhances 
human T-cell activation as demonstrated by increased cytokine ( interleukin-2, interferon-
gamma) production in vitro in whole blood or peripheral blood m ononuclear cells cultures.  
Tremelimumab is thought to stimulate subjects’ immune systems t o attack their tumors by 
blocking a negative regulatory signal, as mentioned above.    
The anti-tumor activity of antibodies to CTLA4 has been demonst rated in a variety of murine 
tumor models. Tremelimumab has also been shown to induce durabl e tumor responses in 
subjects with metastatic melanoma in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinic al studies.    
More complete information is available in the current tremelimu mab Investigator Brochure.  
Objectives:   
Primary Objective  
x To allow access to tremelimumab for subjects who received treme limumab in other trials  
Secondary Objectives  
x To follow long-term survival and tumor status of subjects treat ed with tremelimumab in 
other trials  
x To monitor the safety and tolerability of tremelimumab  
 
Trial Design:  
This is a multi-center, international, open label study.  Eligi ble subjects are those who have 
received tremelimumab in another protocol but are no longer goi ng to receive tremelimumab 
in the other trial.  All subjects who are enrolled in this tria l will have the opportunity to 
receive tremelimumab.  Doses may be delayed under certain circu mstances at the discretion 
of the investigator.  Subjects not receiving tremelimumab shoul d be seen in the clinic or 
contacted at least every 6 months to determine their tumor stat us until the time of final 
analysis.

Endpoints:  
Safety Endpoints  
x Serious adverse events  
x Grade 3 or 4 tremelimumab-related adverse events  
x Immune-mediated adverse events  
x Hypersensitivity reactions to tremelimumab  
 
Efficacy Endpoints  
x Tumor status: alive with disease (AWD) or no evidence of diseas e (NED)  
x Survival  
 
Trial Treatments:  
Subjects who received a single dose of tremelimumab or who rece ived 15 mg/kg every 90 
days in another study will receive intravenous administration o f tremelimumab at a dose of 
15 mg/kg on Day 1 of each 90-day cycle.  To allow for possible change in body weight over 
time, subjects should be weighed within 10 days prior to each c ycle and the administered 
dose of tremelimumab should be recalculated.  
Subjects who have been receiving a different dosing regimen of tremelimumab in a prior 
study may have the option of continuing with their prior dosing  regimen or switching to the 
regimen of 15 mg/kg each 90 days.  
For subjects on a 90-day (or 3-month) dosing regimen, doses sho uld not be given less than 86 
days from the previous dose.  For subjects on other dosing sche dules, doses should not be 
given more than 2 days prior to the scheduled dose.   
Doses may be delayed under certain circumstances at the discret ion of the investigator: 
x Dosing may be delayed per the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management 
Guidelines, due to either an immune or a non-immune-related AE.  
x If dosing must be delayed for reasons other than treatment-rela ted toxicity, dosing will 
resume as soon as feasible.  
 
Subjects not receiving tremelimumab should be seen in the clini c or contacted at least every 6 
months to determine their tumor status until the time of the fi nal analysis.

Sample Size  
The number of subjects enrolled in this study will be determine d by the number of subjects 
who received tremelimumab in other tremelimumab trials who wish  to participate and who 
meet the eligibility criteria.   
No statistical methods will be employed to test a specific hypo thesis in this study.  Only 
descriptive statistics will be provided for safety (number and percentage of subjects with 
adverse events) and survival (median, range, 95 percent confide nce interval) end-points.

Footnotes to Schedule of Activities:    
1. Cycle: For subjects on a 90-day (or 3-month) dosing regimen, doses sho uld not be given less than 86 days 
from the previous dose.  For subjects on other schedules, doses  should not be given more than 2 days 
prior to the scheduled dose.   
2. Informed Consent: All subjects must sign an informed consent document prior to an y study-related 
procedures that are not considered standard of care.   
3. Contraception Counseling:  All women of childbearing potential must agree to practice a fo rm of effective 
contraception for 12 months following any dose of study drug.   
4. Adverse Event Assessment: Following the first dose, serious adverse events, tremelimumab- related grade 
3 and 4 events, immune- mediated adverse events, and hypersensitivity reactions to trem elimumab should 
be assessed and documented during the study reporting period. S ee Section 8.2 , Reporting Period.  All 
reported study drug-related adverse events must be followed unt il the event has resolved, returned to 
baseline or has been deemed irreversible, or until the subject dies.    
5. Concomitant Medications:  Review medications taken by the subject since the last visit to  determine 
whether treatment with tremelimumab is contraindicated.  See Se ction 5.3, Concomitant Medications.   
6. Vital Signs:  Vital signs, including temperature, blood pressure (sitting), a nd heart rate.  During 
tremelimumab infusions, routine monitoring of the subjects’ blo od pressure, heart rate, and temperature 
should be recorded prior to treatment and monitored as needed d uring drug infusion and for 
approximately 1 hour post- infusion. Patients experiencing symptoms or changes in their vi tal signs should 
be monitored more frequently as needed   
7. Pregnancy Test: For women of childbearing potential.  Serum or urine.  Results must be available prior to 
dosing.  Pregnancy tests may also be repeated during the study as per request of IEC/IRBs or if required 
by local regulations.  Subjects who become pregnant must not re ceive furthe r treatment while they are 
pregnant.   
8. Laboratory Assessments:   Blood Chemistry:  Lipase, Amylase, AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), 
Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP),  
Gamma-Glutamine Transferase (GGT), Lactic Acid Dehydrogenase (L DH)    
Thyroid Function:  T3, T4, TSH   
Hematology: WBC with differential count and Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) , RBC count, 
Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Platelet Count  
9. Tumor Assessment:  The results of any tumor assessments should be reviewed, and th e tumor status (NED 
or AWD) and date of assessment should be recorded. If the patie nt begins a new treatment for their  
tumor, the start date and type of treatment will be recorded on  the CRF. See Section 7.4 Tumor 
Assessments.   
10. Follow-Up:  Subjects (or their physicians) should be seen or contacted at l east every 6 months to collect 
information on date of death, cause of death, and tumor status.  If the patient begins a new treatment for 
their tumor, the start date and type of treatment will be recor ded on the CRF.  If there is evidence of 
continuing study drug-related toxicity, the subject should cont inue to be followed at intervals deeme d 
medically appropriate by the investigator.  This information ma y be obtained by telephone interview.

10 of 54  1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background 
Rationale for tremelimumab (previously known as CP-675,206) in Melanoma and Other 
Tumors:  
Tremelimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody.  It binds to  the CTLA4 molecule, 
which is expressed on the surface of activated T lymphocytes.  The binding of CTLA4 to its 
target ligands (B7-1 and B7-2) pr ovides a negative regulatory s ignal, which limits T-cell 
activation. Tremelimumab antagonizes binding of CTLA4 to B7 lig ands and enhances human 
T-cell activation as demonstrated by increased cytokine (interl eukin-2, interferon-gamma) 
production in vitro in whole blood or peripheral blood mononucl ear cells cultures.  
Tremelimumab is thought to stimulate subjects’ immune systems t o attack their tumors by 
blocking a negative regulatory signal, as mentioned above.    
The anti-tumor activity of antibodies to CTLA4 has been demonst rated in a variety of murine 
tumor models. Tremelimumab has also been shown to induce durabl e tumor responses in 
subjects with metastatic melanoma in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinic al studies.    
1.1.1 Rationale for this Trial 
Tremelimumab has been and will be tested in multiple clinical t rials. Each of the protocols 
allows the administration of a limited number of doses of treme limumab.  This rollover 
protocol will allow continued access to tremelimumab for subjec ts who have received it in 
other trials, until this agent becomes commercially available o r development is discontinued.  
Some subjects who were treated in early phase trials have exper ienced long term survival 
and/or durable tumor responses.1 This protocol will allow long-term follow-up of subjects for 
survival and tumor status.  
1.1.2 Clinical Data for Tremelimumab  
The results of previous clinical trials are summarized in the c urrent Investigators Brochure.   
1.2 Tremelimumab Risks and Precautions 
Risks with tremelimumab monotherapy include, but are not limite d to, gastrointenstinal 
effects (colitis, diarrhea, enterocolitis, intestinal perforati on, and large intestinal perforation); 
endocrine disorders (hypo- and hyperthyroidism, hypophysitis, a nd adrenal insufficiency); 
skin effects (rash and pruritus); lipase and/or amylase elevati ons and clinical manifestations 
of pancreatitis; hepatic events (including immune-mediated hepa titis and liver enzyme 
elevations); pneumonitis and IL D; neurotoxicity (including ence phalitis, peripheral motor 
and sensory neuropathies, and Guillain-Barré syndrome); thrombo cytopenia, anemia, and 
neutropenia; infusion-related re actions and hypersensitivity/an aphylactic reactions; renal 
events (including nephritis/autoimmune nephritis and acute kidn ey injury); autoimmune

11 of 54  arthritis, Sjogren’s syndrome; giant cell temporal arteritis, a nd ulcerative colitis; and 
hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus.  
For information on all identified and potential risks for treme limumab, please always refer to 
the current version of the tremelimumab IB. 
In monotherapy clinical studies, AEs reported at an incidence o f > 20% include events such 
as diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, pruritus, decreased appetite, ras h, and vomiting. Approximately 
16% of patients experienced an AE that  resulted in permanent discontinuation of 
tremelimumab, and approximately 45% of patients experienced an SAE. Please see the 
current version of the tremelimumab IB for a detailed summary o f tremelimumab 
monotherapy data, including AEs, SAEs, and CTC Grade 3 to 5 eve nts reported across the 
tremelimumab program.

13 of 54  5 TRIAL TREATMENTS  
Subjects who received a single dose of tremelimumab or who rece ived 15 mg/kg every 90 
days in another study will receive intravenous administration o f tremelimumab at a dose of 
15 mg/kg on Day 1 of each 90-day cycle. To allow for possible c hange in body weight over 
time, subjects should be weighed within 10 days prior to each c ycle and the administered 
dose of tremelimumab should be recalculated.  
Subjects who have been receiving a different dosing regimen of tremelimumab in a prior 
study may have the option of continuing with the prior dosing r egimen or of switching to the 
regimen of 15 mg/kg each 90 days.  
For subjects on a 90-day or 3-month dosing regimen, doses shoul d not be given less than 86 
days from the previous dose.  For subjects on other schedules, doses should not be given 
before 2 days prior to the scheduled dose.   
Doses may be delayed under certain circumstances at the discret ion of the investigator: 
x Dosing may be delayed per the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management 
Guidelines, due to either an immune or a non-immune-related AE.  
x If dosing must be delayed for reasons other than treatment-rela ted toxicity, dosing 
will resume as soon as feasible.   
 
Subjects not receiving tremelimumab should be seen in clinic or  contacted at least every 6 
months to record their tumor status until the time of the final  analysis.    
 
5.1 Allocation to Treatment  
This is an open label trial.  Allocation to study treatment wil l take place during the enrollment 
process. Please refer to the Study Manual for details.  
Subjects must withdraw from treatment in their other tremelimum ab trial prior to enrollment 
in this study.

Product Manual. Labels for the investigational product will be prepared in accordance with 
Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and local regulatory guidelin es. The label will fulfill 
GMP Annex 13 requirements for labeling. Label text will be tran slated into local languages, 
as required. 
5.2.2 Preparation and Dispensing  
Specific preparation instructions are provided in the most curr ent version of the 
Investigational Product Manual.  A member of the Pharmacy or Cl inical Research Unit staff 
with appropriate training and experience must prepare all suppl ies.  
5.2.3 Administration  
Tremelimumab may be diluted with sterile normal saline (supplie d by the investigator) prior 
to administration according to specific instructions in the Inv estigational Product Manual.  
Tremelimumab should be administered open label as an intravenou s solution followed by 
observation.  Specific dosing and administration instructions a re provided in the most current 
version of the Investigational Product Manual.  
Although tremelimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody, imm unogenicity remains a 
possibility, so acute and subacute hypersensitivity reactions a re possible. The subjects’ blood 
pressure, heart rate, and temperature should be recorded prior to treatment and monitored as 
needed during drug infusion and for approximately 1-hour post-i nfusion.    
Medications to treat hypersensitivity reactions should be avail able, such as IV saline, 
acetaminophen, and emergency drugs, including subcutaneous epin ephrine, 
diphenhydramine, methylprednisolone, and nebulized albuterol.  See Section 5.4.1 for 
guidelines on management of hypersensitivity reactions.  If a h ypersensitivity reaction 
attributed to tremelimumab occurs, the investigator must report  this to the AstraZeneca study 
physician .    
5.2.3.1  Dose Delays and Re-Dosing Criteria for Tremelimumab  
The initiation of a cycle may be delayed to allow recovery from  treatment-related toxicity.  
There is a concern that subjects with active brain metastases m ay be at risk for increased 
intracranial pressure if treated with tremelimumab. Subjects wi th brain metastases must not 
receive tremelimumab until after the metastases have been adequ ately treated with surgery 
and/or radiation.  
Subjects must not receive tremelimumab while pregnant or breast -feeding. Females of 
childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine preg nancy test within 10 days 
prior to each dose. Females who have undergone surgical sterili zation or who have been 
postmenopausal for at least 2 years are not considered to be of  childbearing potential. 
For details on dosing delays and re-dosing criteria, please ref er to the Dosing Modification 
and Toxicity Management Guidelines, which is delivered as an An nex document.

15 of 54  5.2.3.2  Stopping Rules for Adverse Events  
Subjects who experience any of the following adverse events at any time during the previous 
cycle must not receive further dosing with tremelimumab unless the investigator discusses 
the case with the AstraZeneca study physician and has provided a written action plan.  
• Hypersensitivity to tremelimumab, Grade 3 (see Section 5.4.1)  
• Hypersensitivity to tremelimumab, Grade 2, and symptoms reappea r after infusion 
restarted  
• Melanoma associated retinopathy, Grade 2 or above  
• Uveitis, Grade 2 or above  
• Diverticulitis  
• Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia  
5.2.4 Compliance  
Tremelimumab will be administered in the clinic by study person nel.  The dose administered 
will be recorded in the subject records and in the Case Report Form (CRF).  
5.2.5 Drug Storage and Drug Accountability   
Tremelimumab must be stored at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).  It i s important that the 
formulation is not frozen.  The investigator or an approved rep resentative (e.g., pharmacist) 
must ensure that all study drug is stored in a secured area, un der recommended storage 
conditions and in accordance with applicable regulatory require ments.    
The investigator must maintain adequate records documenting the  receipt, use, loss, or other 
disposition of the investigational product(s). Drug accountabil ity forms used must identify 
the investigational product, including batch or code numbers, a nd account for its disposition 
on a subject-by-subject basis, including specific dates and qua ntities. The forms must be 
signed by the individual who dispensed the drug, and copies mus t be provided to 
AstraZeneca.  
At the end of the trial, AstraZeneca will provide instructions as to disposition of any unused 
investigational product. If AstraZeneca authorizes destruction at the trial site, the investigator 
must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with  applicable environmental 
regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions  provided by AstraZeneca.  
Destruction must be adequately documented.  
5.2.6 Treatment after the End of the Study 
After the final analysis, AstraZeneca will continue to supply o pen-label drug to patients 
receiving tremelimumab therapy up to the time that they discont inue the treatment for 
whatever reason (see Section 6.3). At the time of the final ana lysis and thereafter:

5.3 Concomitant Medication(s)  
Concomitant medications to treat the subject’s primary malignan cy are not allowed unless 
these drugs were allowed in the subject’s original protocol; As traZeneca does not supply 
these concomitant medications for this protocol.  Examples of a llowed concomitant anti-
cancer therapy include:  
Table 2 Examples of Allowed Concomitant Anti-Cancer Therapies 
Protocol #  Indication  Allowed Anti-Cancer Therapy  
A3671006  Breast Cancer  exemestane (Aromasin)  
Patients from Renal Cell Carci noma studies should not receive s unitinib within 3 months of a 
dose of tremelimumab, as acute renal failure has been reported with combination therapy of 
tremelimumab and sunitinib. It is unknown whether there could b e a safety issue with 
combination of tremelimumab and other tyrosine kinase inhibitor s.  
Since the anti-tumor activity of tremelimumab is thought to inv olve activation of the immune 
system, the use of immunosuppressive drugs should be avoided if  alternative treatment is 
available. However, it is recognized that subjects may require immunosuppressive drugs such 
as corticosteroids for management of underlying disease, treatm ent-related toxicity, or 
unrelated conditions. Topical and inhaled corticosteroids in st andard doses are not expected 
to be immunosuppressive.  
It is highly recommended that subjects not receive anti-infecti ve immunizations for at least 6 
months after dosing with tremelimumab, given that the effect of  the immunization has not 
been explored under conditions of CTLA4 blockade.    
Concommitant medications should not be recorded on the Case Rep ort Form unless they 
were administered to treat a reportable  adverse event (See Section 8.1).

17 of 54  5.4 Management of Toxicity and Dose Modification Information of 
Tremelimumab   
Comprehensive toxicity management guidelines have been develope d to assist investigators 
with the recognition and management of toxicities associated wi th the use of the immune-
checkpoint inhibitors durvalumab [Medi4736] (PD-L1 inhibitor) a nd tremelimumab (CTLA4 
inhibitor).  Given the similar underlying mechanisms of toxicit ies observed with these two 
compounds, these guidelines are applicable to the management of  patients receiving either 
drug as monotherapy or in combination.  Additionally, these gui delines are applicable when 
either drug is used alone or in combination and is administered  concurrently or sequentially 
with other anti-cancer drugs (i.e. antineoplastic chemotherapy,  targeted agents), as part of a 
protocol specific treatment regimen.  The TMGs provide informat ion for the management of 
immune-mediated reactions, infusion-related reactions, and non- immune mediated reactions 
that may be observed with checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy or c ombination checkpoint 
inhibitor regimens, with specific instructions for dose modific ations (including 
discontinuations) and treatment i nterventions.  Investigators a re advised however to use local 
practice guidelines and consult local references for the manage ment of toxicities observed 
with other cancer treatment. The most current version of the TM Gs entitled “Dosing 
Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune-Medi ated, Infusion-Related, 
and Non-Immune Mediated Reactions (MEDI4736) Monotherapy or Com bination Therapy 
with Tremelimumab or Tremelimumab Monotherapy” is provided to t he investigative site as 
an Annex document and is maintained within the Site Master File .  
Patients should be thoroughly evaluated and appropriate efforts  should be made to rule out 
neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic ca uses of the imAE. Serologic, 
immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, shou ld be used to support an 
imAE diagnosis. In the absence of a clear alternative etiology,  events should be considered 
potentially immune related. In addition, there are certain circ umstances in which 
tremelimumab should be permanently discontinued (see Section 5. 2.3.2 of this protocol and 
the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines).  F ollowing the first dose of 
IP, subsequent administration of tremelimumab can be modified b ased on toxicities observed 
as described in the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management  Guidelines. These 
guidelines have been prepared by the Sponsor to assist the Inve stigator in the exercise of 
his/her clinical judgment in treating these types of toxicities . These guidelines apply to AEs 
considered causally related to tremelimumab monotherapy  regime n by the reporting 
Investigator.  
Dose reductions are not permitted . In case of doubt, the Investigator should consult with 
the Study Physician. 
5.4.1 Management of Hypersensitivity Reactions to Tremelimumab  
In case of hypersensitivity reactions, the Investigator should institute treatment measures 
deemed medically appropriate and notify the AstraZeneca Clinici an of the event.  The 
following treatment recommendati ons may be applicable and can b e adopted at the 
investigator’s judgment:3, 4

18 of 54  CTCAE v.3.0 Grade 1 Allergy (transient flushing or rash, drug fever <38°C):  
x Supervise at the bedside.  
CTCAE v.3.0 Grade 2 Allergy (urticaria, drug fever ˰38°C, and/or asymptomatic 
bronchospasm):  
x Interrupt the infusion of tremelimumab and disconnect infusion tubing from subject.  
x Administer IV antihistamines (diphenhydramine 25-50 mg and rani tidine 50 mg or 
cimetidine 300 mg).  
x After recovery of symptoms, resume the infusion at half the ini tial infusion rate.  If no 
further symptoms appear, complete the administration of the dos e.  If symptoms 
reappear, stop infusion and discontinue the subject from treatm ent.  
x CTCAE v.3.0 Grade 3 or 4 Allergy (symptomatic bronchospasm requiring parenteral 
medication(s) with or without urticaria; allergy-related edema/angioedema; 
hypotension; anaphylaxis):  
x Stop the infusion of tremelimumab and disconnect infusion tubin g from subject.  
x Administer epinephrine (1:10,000) in 3.5 to 5 mL IV boluses (no  more than 6 doses).  
x Administer IV antihistamine (diphenhydramine 50 mg IV push).  
x If wheezing persists: 0.35 mL of inhaled albuterol or other bro nchodilators.  
x Consider methylprednisolone 30 to 60 mg IV push, which may prev ent recurrent or 
ongoing reactions. 
x Discontinue the subject from treatment    
5.4.2 Medication Errors 
The definition of a Medication Error can be found in Appendix 4 . 
 
If a medication error occurs in the course of the study, then t he Investigator or other site 
personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives w ithin 1 day, i.e., immediately 
but no later than 24 hours after he/she becomes aware of it. 
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all 
relevant information is completed within 1 (Initial Fatal/Life- Threatening or follow up 
Fatal/Life-Threatening) or 5 (other serious initial and follow up) calendar days if there is an 
SAE associated with the medication error (see Section 8.2) and within 30 days for all other 
medication errors.

19 of 54  6 TRIAL PROCEDURES  
6.1 Screening  
Informed Consent  
All subjects being considered for this study must sign an infor med consent document prior to 
any study-related procedures that are not considered to be stan dard of care and prior to 
receiving study drug.    
Screening assessments are outlined in  
Table 1.  
6.2 Treatment Period   
All assessments for each cycle are outlined in  
Table 1 .  
6.3 End of Treatment  
Subjects may withdraw from treatment at any time at their own r equest, or they may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety, behavioral, 
or administrative reasons.  If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort 
should be made to contact the subject. In any circumstance, eve ry effort should be made to 
document subject outcome, if possible. The investigator should inquire about the reason for 
withdrawal, request the subject to return for a final visit, if  applicable, and follow-up with the 
subject regarding any unresolved adverse events.  
The investigator must determine the primary reason for disconti nuation from treatment in this 
study:     
1. Withdrawal due to adverse event. When a discontinuation is due to a serious adverse 
event (SAE), the serious adverse event must be reported in acco rdance with the 
reporting requirements and the discontinuation must be reported  immediately to the 
AstraZeneca clinical monitor or his/her representative. 
2. Disease progression, unless there is reasonable evidence of cli nical benefit to justify 
continuation on protocol. 
3. Subjects may decide to withdraw from treatment at any time. Sub jects who withdraw 
from treatment should be followed for tumor assessment and surv ival. If the subject 
also withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, no  further evaluations 
should be performed and no additional data should be collected.  The sponsor may 
retain and continue to use any data collected before such withd rawal of consent. 
4. Subjects who begin new investigat ional therapy, chemotherapy, o r other therapy for 
his/her disease must not receive further treatment. 
Tremelimumab  
D4881C00024 Protocol Amendment 2  26 December 2019 
AstraZeneca — Company Confidential 
 
20 of 54  5. Subjects may be discontinued from the study for poor compliance  at the discretion of 
the investigator. 
6. The investigator should withdraw the subject at any time if he/ she believes it is in the 
subject’s best interest to do so. 
7. The subject is lost to follow-up. 
8. The study is terminated by the sponsor. 
Data collection will be stopped, the database locked and the av ailable data summarized once 
eligible patients are no longer available to enter the trial, a nd all patients have had the 
opportunity to be followed up for approximately 9.5 years.  At this time AstraZeneca will 
continue to supply open-label drug to these patients, up to the  time that they discontinue the 
treatment for whatever reason. 
6.4 Follow-up Assessments  
The post treatment follow-up assessments are outlined in  
Table 1.  
Subjects will be followed for at least 90 days after the last d ose of study drug for reportable 
adverse events (See Section 8).  If there is evidence of contin uing study drug-related toxicity, 
the subject should continue to be followed at intervals deemed medically appropriate by the 
investigator.  
After withdrawal from study treatment, subjects (or their physi cians) should be seen or 
contacted at least every 6 months to collect information on dat e of death, cause of death, and 
tumor status. This information may be obtained by telephone int erview.   
In the event a subject is unable to return to the clinic for th e follow-up visit, telephone contact 
with the subject (or their physician) to assess adverse events is expected.  If laboratory 
assessments are needed to follow-up unresolved adverse events, retrieval of assessments 
performed at an institution local to the subject is acceptable.   
The outcome of reportable adverse events with a date of onset d uring the study period should 
be reevaluated, and any new reportable adverse events should be  recorded.  All serious 
adverse events, and those reportable non-serious adverse events  assessed by the investigator 
as possibly related to study drug should continue to be followe d even after subject 
withdrawal from study.  These adverse events should be followed  until they resolve or until 
the investigator assesses them to be “chronic” or “stable.”

21 of 54  7 ASSESSMENTS  
The minimum required screening, on-study and follow-up subject assessments are 
summarized in the Schedule of Activities ( 
Table 1 ).  
7.1 Baseline Demographics  
Demographic data will include date of birth.  The subject’s pri or tremelimumab study 
number and prior subject ID number in that study will be noted on the Case Report Form 
(CRF).  
7.2 Subject History  
The subject s’ prior history will include their cancer history, medical his tory, and dates of 
first and most recent tremelimumab administration.  
7.3 Laboratories  
Laboratory assessments will include the following: lipase and a mylase; liver function tests 
including AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), G amma-Glutamine  
Transferase (GGT), lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH); thyroid fun ction tests including T3,  
T4, TSH., hematology tests including WBC with differential coun t and Absolute Neutrophil 
Count (ANC), RBC count, Hemoglobi n, Hematocrit, and Platelet Co unt.   Investigators 
should review the results of all laboratory tests and use them to make re-dosing decisions.    
All women of childbearing potential must have a serum or urine pregnancy test completed 
within 10 days prior to each administration of tremelimumab.  T he pregnancy test must be 
negative, and the results must be available prior to dosing.  P regnancy tests may also be 
repeated during the study as per request of IEC/IRBs or if requ ired by local regulations.   
Results of routine laboratory assessments will not be collected  on the CRFs.  
7.4 Tumor Assessments  
The subject’s tumor should be assessed according to the investi gator’s usual practice.  The 
subject’s tumor status (alive with disease (AWD) or no evidence  of disease (NED) and the 
date and type of the most recent tumor assessment should be rec orded at each dosing visit 
and follow-up visit.    
Tumor status does not need to be recorded in the CRF for this p rotocol if it is being recorded 
in the CRFs as part of the post-treatment follow-up for the sub ject’s prior protocol.  
8 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
8.1 Adverse Events  
The following adverse events must be reported as described in t he subsequent sections.  
Tremelimumab  
D4881C00024 Protocol Amendment 2  26 December 2019 
AstraZeneca — Company Confidential 
 
22 of 54  • Serious adverse events  
• Grade 3 or 4 tremelimumab-related adverse events  
• Immune-mediated adverse events  
• Hypersensitivity reactions to tremelimumab  
For all adverse events which meet these criteria, the investiga tor must pursue and obtain 
information adequate both to determine the outcome of the adver se event and to assess 
whether it meets the criteria for classification as a serious a dverse event (See Section 8.5) 
requiring immediate notification to AstraZeneca or its designat ed representative.  For all 
reported adverse events, sufficient information should be obtai ned by the investigator to 
determine the causality of the adverse event.  The investigator  is required to assess causality.  
For adverse events with a causal relationship to the investigat ional product, follow-up by the 
investigator is required until the event or its sequelae resolv e or stabilize at a level acceptable 
to the investigator, and AstraZeneca concurs with that assessme nt.  
8.2 Reporting Period  
8.2.1 Immediate Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Serious adverse events require immediate notification to AstraZ eneca or its designated 
representative beginning from the time that the subject provide s informed consent for the 
study; and should be reported under the patient’s prior protoco l until the patient receives 
investigational product in this study.  SAEs do not require not ification if it has been at least 
90 days since the previous dose of tremelimumab, and at least 2 8 days since any study-
related procedures for the patient.   
8.2.2 Reporting of Adverse Events on Case Report Forms  
Adverse events (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the 
subject has taken at least one dose of trial treatment.   
An adverse event does not need to be recorded in the CRF for th is protocol if it is being 
recorded in the CRF for the patient’s prior protocol.  
If a subject begins a new anticancer therapy, the adverse event  reporting period for non-
serious adverse events ends at the time the new treatment is st arted.  Death must be reported 
if it occurs during the serious adverse event reporting period after the last dose of 
investigational product, irrespective of any intervening treatm ent.  
8.3 Definition of an Adverse Event  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinic al investigation subject 
administered a product or medical device; the event need not ne cessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment or usage.  Examples of adverse events include but are not 
limited to:    
x Abnormal test findings;  
Tremelimumab  
D4881C00024 Protocol Amendment 2  26 December 2019 
AstraZeneca — Company Confidential 
 
23 of 54  x Clinically significant symptoms and signs;  
x Changes in physical examination findings;  
x Hypersensitivity.  
Additionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:  
x Drug overdose;  
x Drug withdrawal;  
x Drug abuse;  
x Drug misuse;  
x Drug interactions;  
x Drug dependency; 
x Extravasation;  
x Exposure in utero.  
Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under trial s hould be reported as 
adverse events in the appropriate section of the CRF, providing  they meet the reporting 
criteria in Section 8.1.  Disease progression assessed by measu rement of malignant lesions on 
radiographs or other methods should not be reported as adverse events.  
8.4 Abnormal Test Findings  
Abnormal objective test findings meeting the reporting criteria  in Section 8.1 should also use 
the following criteria for determining whether an abnormal obje ctive test finding should be 
reported as an adverse event:   
x Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
x Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/s urgical intervention, 
and/or  
x Test result leads to a change in trial dosing or discontinuatio n from the trial, 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other the rapy, and/or  
x Test result is considered to be an adverse event by the investi gator or sponsor.  
Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the  above conditions, does not 
constitute an adverse event.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does 
not require reporting as an adverse event.  
Tremelimumab  
D4881C00024 Protocol Amendment 2  26 December 2019

24 of 54  8.5 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event or serious adverse drug reaction is any  untoward medical occurrence 
at any dose that:  
x Results in death;  
x Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);  
x Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
x Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
x Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Progression of the malignancy under trial (including signs and symptoms of progression) 
should not be reported as an SAE unless the outcome is fatal du ring the trial or within the 
safety reporting period. Hospitalization due to signs and sympt oms of disease progression 
should not be reported as an SAE. If the malignancy has a fatal  outcome during the trial or 
within the safety reporting period, then the event leading to d eath must be recorded as an AE 
and as an SAE with CTC Grade 5 (see Section 8.7, Severity Asses sment).  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determin ing whether an event is an 
important medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-
threatening and/or result in death or hospitalization. However,  if it is determined that the 
event may jeopardize the subject and/or may require interventio n to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the definition above, the important medical event should be reported as 
serious.  
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; 
or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.1  
8.6 Hospitalization  
AEs reported from clinical trials associated with hospitalizati on or prolongation of 
hospitalization are considered s erious. Any initial admission ( even if less than 24 hours) to a 
healthcare facility meets these criteria. Admission also includ es transfer within the hospital to 
an acute/intensive care unit (e.g., from the psychiatric wing t o a medical floor, medical floor 
to a coronary care unit, neurological floor to a tuberculosis u nit).  
Hospitalization does not include the following:  
x Rehabilitation facilities;  
x Hospice facilities;  
 
1 21CFR 312.32  
Tremelimumab  
D4881C00024 Protocol Amendment 2  26 December 2019 
AstraZeneca — Company Confidential 
 
25 of 54  x Respite care (e.g., caregiver relief);  
x Skilled nursing facilities;  
x Nursing homes;  
x Routine emergency room admissions;  
x Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedure s).  
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absen ce of a precipitating, clinical 
adverse event is not in itself an SAE. Examples include:   
x Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associat ed with the 
development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition  
(e.g., for work-up of persistent pre-treatment lab abnormality) ; 
x Social admission (e.g., subject has no place to sleep); 
x Administrative admission (e.g., for yearly physical exam);  
x Protocol-specified admission during a clinical trial (e.g., for  a procedure required by 
the trial protocol);  
x Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical  adverse event (e.g., for 
elective cosmetic surgery);  
x Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted i n the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual  subject.  
x Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products.  
Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures , such as surgery, should not 
be reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which th e procedure was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For exa mple, an acute appendicitis that 
begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the  AE, and the resulting 
appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.

4  LIFE-THREATENING OR DISABLING Adverse Event  
5  DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event  
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness o f an adverse event. A severe 
event is not necessarily a serious event. For example, a headac he may be severe (interferes 
significantly with subject’s usual function) but would not be c lassified as serious unless it 
met one of the criteria for SAEs, listed above.  
8.8 Causality Assessment  
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for  all adverse events (serious 
and non-serious).  An investigator’s causality assessment is th e determination of whether 
there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to 
an adverse event.  If the investigator’s final determination of  causality is unknown and the 
investigator does not know whether or not investigational produ ct caused the event, then the 
event will be handled as “related to investigational product” f or reporting purposes.  If the 
investigator’s causality assessment is “unknown but not related  to investigational product”, 
this should be clearly documented on trial records.    
In addition, if the investigator determines a serious adverse e vent is associated with trial 
procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationsh ip in the source documents and 
CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordanc e with the serious adverse 
event reporting requirements, if applicable.  
8.9 Exposure in Utero  
For investigational products within clinical trials and for mar keted products, an exposure 
inutero (EIU) occurs if:  
1) a female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while rece iving or having been 
directly exposed to (eg, environmental exposure) the investigat ional product, or the 
female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant after discontinuing  and/or being directly 
exposed to the investigational product (maternal exposure);  
2) a male has been exposed, either due to treatment or environment al, to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of concepti on and/or is exposed 
during the partner pregnanc y (paternal exposure).  
If any trial subject or trial subject’s partner becomes or is f ound to be pregnant during the 
trial subject’s treatment with the investigational product, the  investigator must submit this 
information to AstraZeneca on an Exposure in Utero Form.  In ad dition, the investigator must 
submit information regarding environmental exposure to a AstraZ eneca product in a pregnant 
woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been ex posed to a cytotoxic product 
by inhalation or spillage) using the Exposure in Utero Form.  T his must be done irrespective 
of whether an adverse event has occurred and within 24 hours of  awareness of the pregnancy.  
Tremelimumab  
D4881C00024 Protocol Amendment 2  26 December 2019 
AstraZeneca — Company Confidential 
 
27 of 54  The information submitted should include the anticipated date o f delivery (see below for 
information related to induced termination of pregnancy).  
Follow-up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information on all Exposure in Utero 
reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy until 
completion or until pregnancy termination (ie, induced abortion ) and then notify AstraZeneca 
of the outcome.  The investigator will provide this information  as a follow up to the initial 
Exposure in Utero Form.  The reason(s) for an induced abortion should be specified.  An EIU 
report is not created when an ectopic pregnancy report is recei ved since this pregnancy is not 
usually viable.  Rather, a serious adverse event case is create d with the event of ectopic 
pregnancy.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediat e classification as a serious 
adverse event (ie, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal d eath, or congenital anomaly 
[including that in an aborted fetus, stillbirth or neonatal dea th]), the investigator should 
follow the procedures for reporting serious adverse events.  
In the case of a live birth, the “normality” of the newborn can  be assessed at the time of birth  
(ie, no minimum follow-up period of a presumably normal infant is required before an 
Exposure in Utero Form can be completed).  The “normality” of a n aborted fetus can be 
assessed by gross visual inspection, unless pre-abortion test f indings are suggestive of a 
congenital anomaly.  
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are classi fied as serious adverse 
events follows:   
• “Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion .  
• All neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should b e reported, without 
regard to causality, as serious adverse events.  In addition, a ny infant death after 1 
month that the investigator assesses as possibly related to the  in utero exposure to the 
investigational medication should be reported.  
8.10 Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also End of Treatment, 
Section 6.3)  
Withdrawal due to adverse event should be distinguished from wi thdrawal due to insufficient 
response, according to the definition of adverse event noted ea rlier, and recorded on the 
appropriate adverse event CRF page if it meets the protocol-spe cified criteria for reportable 
adverse events.    
When a subject withdraws due to a serious adverse event, the se rious adverse event must be 
reported in accordance with the reporting requirements defined below.  
Tremelimumab  
D4881C00024 Protocol Amendment 2  26 December 2019 
AstraZeneca — Company Confidential 
 
28 of 54  8.11 Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
The investigator is to report all adverse events which meet the  criteria for adverse event 
reporting in this trial (Section 8.1 including all directly obs erved adverse events and all 
adverse events spontaneously reported by the trial subject.  In  addition, each trial subject will 
be questioned about adverse events.  
8.12 Reporting Requirements  
Each adverse event is to be assessed to determine if it meets t he criteria for serious adverse 
event.  If a serious adverse event occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and 
international regulations, as appropriate.  
All adverse events which meet the criteria for adverse event re porting in this trial (Section 
8.1) will be reported on the adverse event page(s) of the CRF.  An adverse event does not 
need to be recorded in the CRF for this protocol if it is being  recorded in the CRF for the 
patient’s prior protocol.  It should be noted that the form for  collection of serious adverse 
event information is not the same as the adverse event CRF.  Wh ere the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same 
adverse event term should be used on both forms.  Adverse event s should be reported using 
concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of serious 
adverse event information.  
8.12.1  Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
If a serious adverse event occurs, AstraZeneca is to be notifie d within 24 hours of awareness 
of the event by the investigator.  In particular, if the seriou s adverse event is fatal or life-
threatening, notification to AstraZeneca must be made immediate ly, irrespective of the extent 
of available adverse event information.  This timeframe also ap plies to additional new 
information (follow-up) on previously forwarded serious adverse  event reports as well as to 
the initial and follow-up reporting of Exposure in Utero cases.     
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware o f the occurrence of a serious 
adverse event immediately (eg, if an outpatient trial subject i nitially seeks treatment 
elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 h ours after learning of it and 
document the time of his/her first awareness of the adverse eve nt.  
For all serious adverse events, the investigator is obligated t o pursue and provide information 
to AstraZeneca in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, 
an investigator may be requested by AstraZeneca to obtain speci fic additional follow-up 
information in an expedited fashion.  This information may be m ore detailed than that 
captured on the adverse event case report form.  In general, th is will include a description of 
the adverse event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case 
and independent determination of possible causality.  Informati on on other possible causes of 
the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses must b e provided.  In the case of a 
subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible 
to AstraZeneca or its designated representative.

29 of 54  8.12.2  Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
Non-serious adverse events which meet the criteria for adverse event reporting in this trial 
(Section 8.1) are to be reported on the adverse event CRFs, whi ch are to be submitted to 
AstraZeneca.  An adverse event does not need to be recorded in the CRF for this protocol if it 
is being recorded in the CRF for the patient’s prior protocol.  
9 DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.1 Sample Size Determination  
The number of subjects enrolled in this study will be determine d by the number of subject s 
who were administered tremelimumab in prior tremelimumab trials , who wish to participate 
in this trial and who meet the eligibility criteria.    
9.2 Efficacy Analysis  
No statistical methods will be employed to test a specific hypo thesis in this study.  Only 
descriptive statistics will be provided for survival (median, r ange, 95 percent confidence 
interval) end-points.   
9.3 Safety Analysis  
No statistical methods will be employed to test a specific hypo thesis in this study.  Only 
descriptive statistics will be provided for safety (number and percentage of subjects with 
adverse events) end-points.   
9.4 Interim Analysis   
Not Applicable  
9.5 Data Monitoring Committee   
Not Applicable  
10 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
During trial conduct, AstraZeneca or its agent will conduct per iodic monitoring visits to 
ensure that the protocol and GCPs are being followed.  The moni tors may review source 
documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate .  The investigator and 
institution will allow AstraZeneca monitors or its agents and a ppropriate regulatory 
authorities direct access to source documents to perform this v erification.  
The trial site may be subject to review by the Institutional Re view Board (IRB)/Independent 
Ethics Committee (IEC), and/or to quality assurance audits perf ormed by AstraZeneca, 
and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities.  
Tremelimumab  
D4881C00024 Protocol Amendment 2  26 December 2019

30 of 54  It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant per sonnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that s ufficient time is devoted to the 
process.   
11 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
11.1 Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record  
As used in this protocol, the term Case Report Form (CRF) shoul d be understood to refer to 
either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depen ding on the data collection 
method used in this trial.  
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included sub ject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole property of AstraZeneca and should n ot be made available in any 
form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of  AstraZeneca or appropriate 
regulatory authorities, without written permission from AstraZe neca.  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure completion an d to review and approve all 
CRFs.  CRFs must be signed by the investigator or by an authori zed staff member.  These 
signatures serve to attest that the information contained on th e CRFs is true.  At all times, the 
investigator has final personal responsibility for the accuracy  and authenticity of all clinical 
and laboratory data entered on the CRFs.  Subject source docume nts are the physician’s 
subject records maintained at the trial site.  In most cases, t he source documents will be the 
hospital’s or the physician’s chart.  In cases where the source  documents are the hospital or 
the physician’s chart, the information collected on the CRFs mu st match those charts.   
In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document.  In these cases, AstraZeneca 
and the investigator must prospectively document which items wi ll be recorded in the source 
documents and for which items the CRF will stand as the source document.  
11.2 Record Retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities  or AstraZeneca, the 
investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects 
(sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed 
informed consent forms, copies of all CRFs, serious adverse eve nt forms, source documents, 
and detailed records of treatment disposition.  The records sho uld be retained by the 
investigator according to ICH, local regulations, or as specifi ed in the Clinical Study 
Agreement, whichever is longer.  
If the investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withd raws from the trial, AstraZeneca 
should be prospectively notified.  The trial records must be tr ansferred to an acceptable 
designee, such as another investigator, another institution, or  to AstraZeneca.  The 
investigator must obtain AstraZeneca’s written permission befor e disposing of any records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.

12 ETHICS  
12.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB )/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC)  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospectiv e approval of the trial protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent forms, and other relevant  documents, eg, 
advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC.  All correspon dence with the IRB/IEC 
should be retained in the Investigator File.  Copies of IRB/IEC  approvals should be 
forwarded to AstraZeneca.  
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated pr ior to IRB/IEC approval is 
where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate h azards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify the IRB/IEC and AstraZ eneca in writing within 5 
working days after the implementation.  
12.2 Ethical Conduct of the Trial  
The trial will be performed in accordance with the protocol, In ternational Conference on 
Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and applicable  local regulatory 
requirements and laws.  
12.3 Subject Information and Consent  
All parties will ensure protection of subject personal data and  will not include subject names 
on any sponsor forms, reports, publications, or in any other di sclosures.  In case of data 
transfer, AstraZeneca will maintain high standards of confident iality and protection of 
subject personal data.  
The informed consent form must be agreed to by AstraZeneca and the IRB/IEC and must be 
in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements.  
The investigator must ensure that each trial subject, or his/he r legally acceptable 
representative, is fully informed about the nature and objectiv es of the trial and possible risks 
associated with participation.  The investigator, or a person d esignated by the investigator, 
will obtain written informed consent from each subject or the s ubject’s legally acceptable 
representative before any trial-specific activity is performed.   The informed consent form 
used in this trial, and any changes made during the course of t he trial, must be prospectively 
approved by both the IRB/IEC and AstraZeneca before use.  The i nvestigator will retain the 
original of each subject’s signed consent form.

Comprehensive toxicity management guidelines (TMG) have been de veloped to assist 
investigators with the recognition and management of toxicities  associated with the use of the 
immune-checkpoint inhibitors durvalumab [Medi4736] (PD-L1 inhib itor) and tremelimumab 
(CTLA4 inhibitor).  Given the similar underlying mechanisms of toxicities observed with 
these two compounds, these guidelines are applicable to the man agement of patients 
receiving either drug as monotherapy or in combination.  Additi onally, these guidelines are 
applicable when either drug is used alone or in combination and  is administered concurrently 
or sequentially with other anti-cancer drugs (i.e. antineoplast ic chemotherapy, targeted 
agents), as part of a protocol specific treatment regimen.  The  TMGs provide information for 
the management of immune-mediated reactions, infusion-related r eactions, and non-immune 
mediated reactions that may be observed with checkpoint inhibit or monotherapy or 
combination checkpoint inhibitor regimens, with specific instru ctions for dose modifications

Patients should be thoroughly evaluated and appropriate efforts  should be made to rule out 
neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic ca uses of the imAE. Serologic, 
immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, shou ld be used to support an 
imAE diagnosis. In the absence of a clear alternative etiology,  events should be considered 
potentially immune related.  In addition, there are certain cir cumstances in which 
tremelimumab should be permanently discontinued (see Section 5. 2.3.2. of this protocol and 
the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines).  F ollowing the first dose of 
IP, subsequent administration of tremelimumab can be modified b ased on toxicities observed 
as described in the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management  Guidelines. These 
guidelines have been prepared by the Sponsor to assist the Inve stigator in the exercise of 
his/her clinical judgment in treating these types of toxicities . These guidelines apply to AEs 
considered causally related to tremelimumab monotherapy  regime n by the reporting

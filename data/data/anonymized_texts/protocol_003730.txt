COV
ID-19, the infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV -2, is rapidly affecting humans around the globe. While initial
epidemiological data have focused on cases that resulted in severe respiratory disease seen predominantly in adults,
little information rega rding the infection burden in children is available . This is complicated by the observation that
many virologically -confirmed cases in children are asymptomatic (Dong et al, Pediatrics ,PMID 32179660).
Undocumented, and likely infectious, cases could result in exposure to a far greater proportion of the community thanwould otherwise occur. Indeed, it has been proposed that undocumented (or silent) infections are the source for almost
80% of documented infections (Li et al, Science , PMID 32179701); thus, it is critical to determine the silent and
symptomatic infection rate in children. To overcome challenges for clinical study implementation imposed by current
healthcare access restrictions, this surveillance study will enroll and prospectively observe eligible children that are
current participants in NIH-funded pediatric research studies and their family members. These children and their
families are known to study site personnel and because, as part of their participation in the various NIH-funded research
studies , most of these children have already been exposed to the procedures that are involved in a surveillance study .
This study can therefore be rapidly implemented and realistically conducted remotely without necessitating any visits to
a clinical res earch center.
In
addition to the need for surveying children for asymptomatic SARS -CoV-2 infection, this study will allow a comparison
between children with asthma and other atopic conditions and children without those conditions. Although, as of thecurrent writing of this protocol, asthma has not been identified as a risk factor for severe COVID -19 disease (Zhang et al,
Allergy , PMID 32077115), t here is evidence that children with asthma and other atopic conditions have increased
susceptibility to viral respiratory infections (Esquivel et al, AJRCCM ,PMC5649984) and that viral respiratory infections
may result in worsening of underlying airway disease (Jartti et al, J Allergy Clin Immunol, PMID 28987219) . No data
currently exist as to whether this is true for SARS-CoV -2 infection or whether allergic airway disease could be protective.
2. Study Objectives
2.
1 Primary Objective
Determine the incidence of SARS -CoV-2 infection ( viadetection of viral RNA in nasal secretions) in children and their
househ old contacts (caregivers and siblings) during the study period .
2.2. Secondary Objectives
a. Determine SARS-CoV -2 antibody development in children and their household members .
b. Compare SARS -CoV-2 infection status (detection of viral RNA in nasal secretions) and virus -specific antibody
development for children with asthma and other atopic conditions (e.g. eczema) v ersus children without asthma
or other atopic conditions.
c. Determine mucosal immune responses toSARS-CoV-2 infection through gene expression profiling and examine
whether these responses are influenced by the presence of asthma or other atopic condition .
d. Determine whether topical, systemic, or inhaled steroids use, asdirected by their care provider, modif ythe risk
of SARS -CoV-2 ,the severity of infection , or expression of the SARS -CoV-2 receptor .
e. Determine whether baseline demographic and environmental factors, such as age, sex, race, history of influenza
vaccination, rural versus urban living ,medications (such as ACE inhibitors), and smoking exposure modify the
risk of SARS -CoV-2 infection or the severity of infection.

2.3.
 Exploratory Objectives
a. Investigate the transmissibility of SARS- CoV-2 infection among household members.
b. Investigate whether SARS- CoV-2 infection will be associated with more respiratory symptoms in children with
asthma and other atopic conditions, ascompared to children without asthma or other atopic conditions.
c. Investigate whether SARS- CoV-2 infection will be associated with baseline nasal microbiome or with changes in
the nasal microbiome and whether the underlying atopic status plays a role in this relationship.
d. Investiga te whether SARS -CoV-2 infection, as identified by the presence of virus in nasal secretions, will be
associated with the presence of virus in stool.
e. Determine whether IgA antibody specific for common coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1) in the blood at
baseline modifies the risk of SARS-CoV -2 infection or the severity of infection.
f. Investigate earlier SARS-CoV -2 exposure by assaying historical samples from enrolled participants.
g. Identify protective/risk factors for disease acquisition integrating all available data using machine learning
approaches and network analysis to provide efficient representation of complex interactions .
3. Study Design
3.1. Description of Study Design
This is a prospective surveillance study in which subjects that are currently enrolled in NIH -funded studies (index
participant ) and their household contacts, including caregiver(s) and possibly asibling, will be asked to enroll in the
SARS -CoV-2 surveillance study. Aminimum of 2 family members (index participant and a caregiver ) and up toa
maximum of 4 total members (additional caregiver and/or sibling) will be enrolled per family. The enrollment goal is
approximately 2000 families. The enrollment period will be approximately 8 weeks, and each participant will participate
fora minimum of 6 months with possible extension of the observation period .During the study, biological samples will
becollected by the family at pre -determined intervals and symptom and exposure surveys will becompleted remotely
via a smart phone, on-line , or phone communications at the time the biological samples arecollected (Figure 3.1 Study
Overview). The Schedule of Events (Table A)provides more complete details of the study events and timing of these
event s.All biological samples ( e.g. nasal swabs, peripheral blood , stool )will be collected by the caregiver at home using
materials provided to the family. Peripheral blood will only be collected from participants 2 years of age and older. At
the end of study, additional samples (e.g. nasal secretion and/or saliva samples) may be collected by the family or study
staff at a site visit, if feasible.
Ifanymember of the household develops symptoms compatible with COVID -19, the family will be instructed to
complete a symptom survey for the affected household member . Ifcompletion of the symptom algorithm meets a
study -specified threshold ,this will be considered the first illness event for the family/household and an additional nasal
swab willbe collected from all study participants in the household and an additional stool sample (via swab) will be
collected from the affected household member if they are a study participant .Blood will be collected from all study
participants that are 2 years of age and older three weeks following this first illness event during the study period.
Additional nasal swabs and stool samples will be collected from the index participants with every illness that meets the
study -specified symptom threshold. For family members other than the index participant , additional samples associated
with illnesses will be collected with the first illness event only .

4.2. Rationale for Study Population
The study population will include index participants and their families. The intent is to recruit index participants who
have asthma and/or other atopic or allergic conditions ,as well as healthy index participants ,with extensive medical
information and information on atopic and allergic status available as a result of their participation in the NIH-funded
research stu dy. As many of these studies are birth cohort studies, there is also extensive information on the parents.
Furthermore, most ofthese families have experience with collection of respiratory samples and are familiar with
respiratory questionnaires.
4.3. Inclusion Criteria
Household members who meet all of the following criteria are eligible for enrollment as study participants:
a. The index participant a nd/or caregiver understa nds the study procedures, is willing to conduct them at home,
and has the ability to u se either a computer or a smart phone to link to and respond to the study questionnaires .
If the family does not have access to a computer or a smart phone ,they are willing to speak with a study
member toanswer the questionnaires.
b
. The index participant is 21 years old and younger , lives with caregiver(s), and is or has been a participant in a
NIH-funded clinical study from which information on respiratory conditions, including asthma, and other atopic
and allergic diseases is available .
c. Th
e index participant and caregiver will reside in the United States, including Puerto Rico, for the duration of the
study.
d
. The index participant will live with the caregiver for at least 50% of the time for the duration of the study.
e
. AnEnglish or Spanish speaker is available to serve as the primary contact and as the person who will be
responsible for the completion of questionnaires and the collection of study bio logical samples.
f. Q
ualifying siblings must be under 21 years of age and l ive in the same home as the index participant and
caregiver.

xclusion Criteria
Individuals who meet any of the following criteria are not eligible for enrollment as study participants :
Past or current medical problems, which, in the opinion of the siteinvestigator, may pose risks from participation in the
study, may interfere with the participant’s ability to comply with study requirements or may impact the quality or
interpretation of the data obtained from the study
5. Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Participants
5.1 Risks of Study Procedures
5
.1.1 Nasal Swabs and Nasal Secretions
a.Nasal swab and nasal secretion collection may cause localized discomfort. Rarely, mild epistaxis may occur.
b.There is a risk of irritation if the liquid reagent in the nasal swab collection kit comes in contact with the skin.
Gloves will be provided to reduce the risk of skin contact.
c.Risk of infection: It is unknown whether the collection of the biospecimen s outlined in this protocol increases
the risk of infection to household members beyond that of living in the same household with study participants.
There is a distinction between what should be expected in a healthcare setting and the home. In this respe ct,
home collection probably does not merit use of the level of personal protective equipment ( PPE)recommended
for healthcare workers. Because it is not known whether the collection of the biospecimens outlined in this
protocol increases the risk of infec tion to household members beyond that of living in the same household with
study participants, we include viral transmission as a potential risk of study participation. Because we do not
know if there is an increased risk of infection transmission, as a pr ecaution, the study will provide, recommend,
and teach proper use of barrier protection to those assisting with biospecimen collection (collection of anterior
nasal swab in age 10 and under, inferior turbinate swab for age 11+, stool swab, capillary blood collection).
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) plan: The proposed PPE plan for this study is based on available data and
guidance from the CDC at the time the study was implemented to prevent any significant additional infectious
risk to the family members performing the swabs given both the nature of the procedure being non -aerosol
generating and the ongoing level of contact within the household.
1. Masks. We recognize that the CDC a t the time of writing of this protocol does still recommend use of an N95
or higher -level respirator during collection of a nasopharyngeal (NP) sample for SARS -CoV- 2 testing by
healthcare providers. However, there are no recommendations for collection by household members nor
any recommendations for collecting anterior nares and mid -length, inferior turbinate samples. The CDC
guidance does acknowledge that not all procedures are equally likely to generate infectious aerosols andthat NP swabs therefore wou ld be a lower priority for use of N95 masks than more invasive procedures such
as intubation ,if availability of N95 masks is limited. The collection of anterior nares swabs and inferior
turbinate swabs, which are proposed to be performed in this study , isless likely to induce coughing and
possible aerosol generation compared with NPswabs, although even NP swabs are not considered AGP.
Thus ,we believe that there is lesser utility of an N95 in the setting of such sample collection. In addition, an
Confi dential Page 13of24
HEROS   Version 3 .0                                                                                         09/02/2020  N95 mask cannot be fit tested in this scenario, and without fit testing there isn't any assurance that an N95
mask willprovide any better protection than a surgical mask.
2. Other barrier protection: The CDC guidance for specimen collection by healthcare providers also
specifies the use of a gown in addition to the PPE we are recommending. We do not view a gown in the
home as necessary given the differences between the healthcare and home environments . When family
members have physical contact with the child throughout the rest of the day without such a barrier , the
benefit of the gown is questionable. We are recommending gloves for the dual purpose of barrier protection
and protection from inadverten t contact with the liquid reagent provided in the tubes into which the swabs
will be placed, as the liquid reagent may cause mild irritation of the skin.
3. Ethical use of PPE: Atthe time of development of this protocol, PPE shortages, including N95 masks a re
currently (March –April 2020) posing a tremendous challenge to the US healthcare system because of the
COVID -19 pandemic. Healthcare facilities are having difficulty accessing the needed PPE and are having to
identify alternate ways to provide patient care. There is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of
Respiratory Protective Devices; on February 4, 2020, the HHS Secretary declared that circumstances exist tojustify the authorization of emergency use of additional respiratory protective devices in healthcare settings
during the COVID -19 outbreak. Thus, recommending PPE for this protocol in excess of what has been
included and in the absence of any likely benefit would not be responsible use of limited resources and
could not be endorsed.
Summary: In summary, it is unknown whether the collection of the biospecimens outlined in this protocol
increases the risk of infection to household members beyond that of living in the same household with study
participants. Because of this uncertainty ,viral tra nsmission is included as a potential risk of study
participation ,and a barrier protection plan is recommended. However, the collection of these samples by
household members do esnot merit use of the level of PPE recommended for healthcare workers. Thus , use
of a surgical mask, eye shield, gloves, and education on proper use, in addition to hand hygiene, are deemed
to provide protection for household members assisting with biospecimen collection. These
recommendations were developed based on there being a clear distinction between what should be
expected in a healthcare setting and the home, and the procedures being conducted. It is not known
whether our recommendation of barrier protection precautions for those living in the same household who
assist with biospecimen collection are even necessary, but the benefits seem plausible, and the harms
unlikely.

1.2 Blood Collection
The risks associated with drawing blood via the OnDemand device include syncope, local discomfort where the lancet is
inserted, and,in rare cases ,local infection. Participants are instructed to remain seated while using the OnDemand
device and during blood collection and to lay down if a participant feels light -headed or experiences dizziness. Universal
precautions will be followed to reduce the risk of infection.
5.1.3. Stool and Saliva Collections
There are no significant risks associated with saliva sample collection.
Confi dential Page 14of24
HEROS   Version 3 .0                                                                                         09/02/2020  There is a risk of irritation if the liquid reagent in the stool swab collection kit comes in contact with the skin. Gloves w ill
be provided to reduce the risk of skin contact.
5.1.4. Questionnaires/SurveysThere is a possibility that participants may fin d questions too personal. Participants may refuse to answer any questions
that make them feel uncomfortable. Participants will provide name, address, phone number, and date of birth. This
information will be shared with the sponsor (NIAID/DAIT), the Data Management Coordinating Center (DMCC) at
Vanderbilt University, the company that is sending the sample kits to the participants home ,and the researchers and
staff that are part of this study.5.1.5. Breach of ConfidentialityAs in every research study, un authorized access to identified data is a risk. The REDCap data system into which
participants will directly enter personal data is an established data system that provides several levels of security .
5.2.
 Potential Benefits
This study will provide nodirect benefit for participants. The public health benefit for this study isto collect data
regarding incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS -CoV-2 in a large convenience sample inorder to inform
decisions regarding interventions to control spread of SARS -CoV- 2 infection and possibly design proactive interventions
to prevent future COVID -19 outbreaks. This study will provide timely and useful evidence and may enable public health
authorities to be more effective in their efforts to protect and promote public health related to SARS -CoV -2.
6. Study Procedures
6.1. Enrollment and Training
Potential study participants (usually the primary care provider for minor children) will be contacted by a member of the
clinical research site staff via text, email, or pho ne call who will direct them to the link to the study HEROS home web
page. If interested in participating in the study ,the participant/caregiver will be given instructions to view the study web
portal. The potential participant will read an information sheet that includes details about the study, study
requirements, and study risks, and will provide assurance that each participating family member has read the
information sheet and agrees to participate forthemselves, index participants ,and other family members. The
participant willthen be directed to complete an electronic registration form and to complete abaseline questionnaire.
Once this process is completed, the participant is considered enrolled in the study and will be assigned a unique
particip ant number. All participating family members will be assigned unique participant numbers. Upon completion of
these tasks, the sample kit distribution center will mail each household a set of sample collection kits for initiation of
bio-sampling.
Once enrol led, the primary contact/caregiver and each participant will be requested to undergo a web -based training
that will describe in detail the processes of sample collection and handling . Study staff will be available by phone, Skype,
text, or video conferenc ingfor further instructions and clarifications on sample collection procedures.

study extension that will include collecting 4 additional nasal swabs for a total of 14 nasal swabs over 28 w eeks . The
information sheet will require that each participating family member attest that they have read the information sheet .
The household will have the option to continue with the origina l visit and sample collection schedule (10 nasal swab
collections over 24 weeks), to participate in the study extension with 4 additional nasal swab collections , ortorequest
further information via contact with their local study site.
6.2.
 Index participants and Household Contacts Study Assessments
6.2.1Caregiver -Collected Samples
At the times shown in the Schedule of Events (Table A),the primary contact/caregiver will collect nasal swabs from the
index participants and all family members that are enrolled in the study at the beginning of the study (Week 2 )and
every 2 weeks thereafter for9 collections , then a final 10thnasal swab collect eda t the end of the study (total 10 nasal
swabs collected over 24 weeks) . If the household agrees toparticipate in the study extension, 4additional nasal swabs
will be collected between Week 18 and Week 2 8 (Table A). Stool samples via swabs will be collected from the index
participants and all family members that are enrolled (starting at Week 2) into the study (Table A). Blood samples will be
collected via the OnDemand device from the index participants and all family members that are enrolled in the study
and 2 years of age and older (Table A) .Nasal secretion and/or saliva samples may also becollected from theindex
participants and all enrolled family members at Week 24.Samples will be shipped as instructed in the sample kit
package. Details of the nasal swab , stool collection, blood collection, nasal secretion, and saliva procedures will b e
provided in the sample kit package.
6.2.2.
Questionnaires
At the times shown in the Schedule of Events (Table A),the primary contact/caregiver willhave the responsibility to
ensure that on-line questionnaires regarding current symptoms and recent expo sures will be completed for all
participants .A symptom and exposure survey will be completed every 2 weeks starting at Week 2 to coincide with nasal
sample collection. Ahealth check surve yto detect anyillness in the household in the intervening weeks will be
completed every 2 weeks starting at Week 1. The caregiver will be instructed on how toaccess and complete the on -
line questionnaires.
6.3. U
nscheduled Assessments During Illness
6.3.1. First Illness. Ifany member of the household ,including study participants and other people living in the same
household that are not enrolled in the study ,develop symptoms consistent with a viral illness, the caregiver will be
instructed to fill in a symptom survey . If completion of the symptom survey meets a study -specified threshold in an
illness algorithm, the caregiver will be instructed to collect, within 24 hours, unscheduled nasal swabs from all study
participants and astool sample from the affected participant. If the affected household member is not a study
participant, she/he will be asked to enroll in the study only for this illness event and to provide a nasal swab and a stool
sample. In addition, blood will be collected via a OnDemand device from all study participants that are 2 years old or
older three weeks after the first illness event threshold is met. If the affected household member was not a study
participant, she/he will also be asked to provide the 3 -week blood sample. If the affected household member was not a
study participant and refus es to register into the study or provide samples, then this illness event will not be recorded as
the first Illness event for the household.

consistent with a viral illness that meet the same study-specific threshold as in the “first illness”. In such case, an extra
nasal swab and a stool sample will be collected only from the index participant within 24 hours.
6.4. Sample Collection/Questionnaire Completion Windows
Sample collection and completion of the study questionnaires should take place within the time limits specified in the
Schedule of Events (Table A).

2Additional nasal swab and a stool samples will be collected when a household member shows signs of a viral illness and a stud y-specifi ed threshold for symptom algorithm
has been met. For the first illness, the nasal swab sample will be collected within 24 hours from all study participants, inc luding the affected household member, and a stool
sample from just the affected household member. Subsequent illnesses will be assessed only if the index participant is affected; in this case a swab and a stool sample wil l
be obtained within 24 hours only from the index participant.

• SARS -CoV-2 detection and nasal transcriptomics. RNA extracted from all swabs will be used to perform RT -qPCR
for SAR S-CoV -2.The r emaining RNA and DNA will be stored for possible detection (and quantification) of other
respiratory virus es,for generating the host transcriptom e response to infection (from airway epithelial and any
immune cells that were present on the nasal swab ), and for delineating the nasal microbiome at the time the
swab was collected .
• Viral Serology ( antibody detection/quantification) on stored serum. The optimal assay for detection of virus-
specific antibody has not yet been identified in the greater scientific community. Serum samples will be stored
until such an assay becomes available.
• SARS -CoV-2 detection in stool. RNA extracted from all stool swabs will be used to perform RT -qPCR for SAR S-
CoV-2. The remaining RNA will be stored for possible detection (and quantification) of other respiratory viruses .
8. Biospecimen Storage
All biological samples will be collected by the caregiver and mailed to the study biorepository.
9. Criteria for Participant and Study Completion and Premature Study Termination
9.1. Participant Completion
Participation of the index participants , caregiver, and sibling(s) will be complete at Week 24 (original schedule of events)
or Week 28 if the household agrees to the study extension .
9.2. Participant Stopping Rules and Withdrawal Criteria
Participants may be prematurely terminated from the study for the following reasons:
• The participant elects to withdraw from all future study activities
• The p articipant is “lost to follow -up” (i.e., no further follow -up is possible because attempts to reestablish contact
with the participant have failed)
• The participant dies
• The Investigator no longer believes participation is in the best interest of the part icipant
• If the index participant’s enrollment is terminated, the caregivers’ and siblings’ participation will be terminated;
however, termination of enrollment of the caregiver or sibling will not result in termination of the index participant
9.3.
 Participant Replacement
Participants who withdraw or are withdrawn will not be replaced .
9.
4.Study Stopping Rules
The study may be prematurely terminated for the following reasons:
• Ifprotocol continuation poses major new risks to participants or study staff
• If, as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic circumstances, protocol feasibility becomes highly questionable
10. Safety Monitoring and Reporting
Confi dential Page 20of24
HEROS   Version 3 .0                                                                                         09/02/2020  10.1 Overview
T
his section defines the types of safety data that will be collected under this protocol and outlines the procedures for
appropriately collecting, grading, recording, and reporting those data. Adverse events (AEs) that are classified as serious
will be reported promptly to DAIT/NIAID. Appropriate notifications will also be made to thesite principal investigators.
10.2 Definitions
10.2.1 Adverse Event
For this surveillance study, an adverse event ( AE)is defined as a ny untoward or unfavorable medical occurr ence in a
participant that is associated with a study procedure mandated by the protocol and occurs within 48 hours of this
procedure. This definition excludes all untoward or unfavorable medical occurrences not related to astudy procedure,
including hospitalizations or deaths. The study mandated procedures are listed in the Schedule of Events (Table A) .
Criteria for determining the relatedness of an AE to a study procedure and grading its severity are provided in Sections
10.3. 1Grading Criteria and 10.3 .2Attribution Definitions .The worsening of a participant’s pre-existing medical
condition will not be considered an AE unless the worsening is related to a study mandated procedure.
10.2.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
SAEs are very unlikely to occur and r eportable SAE s for this surveillance study will be limited to those related to study
procedures. An SAE is defined as an AE meeting 1 of the following conditions :
• Death.
• A life -threatening event: An AE is considered “life- threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or the
DAIT Medical Monitor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AEthat, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongatio n of existing hospitalization.
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions.
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be
considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
Any other condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, represents a significant hazard, such as an
important medical event that does not result in one of the above outcomes, may be considered an SAE when
the event is related to a study procedure and jeopardizes the participant or requires medical or surgical
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.

0.3 Grading and Attribution of Adverse Events
10.3.1 Grading Criteria
The study site will grade the severity of adverse events experienced by the study subjects according to the
criteria set forth in the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE
V5.0). This document (referred to herein as the NCI -CTCAE manual) provides a common language to describe
levels of severity, to analyze and interpret data, and to articulate the clinical significance of all adverse events.
The NCI-CTCAE has been reviewed by the DAIT/NIAID Med icalMonitor and has been deemed appropriate for
the subject population to be studied in this protocol.
Confi dential Page 21of24
HEROS   Version 3 .0                                                                                         09/02/2020  Adverse events will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the follo wing standards in the NCI-CTCAE
manual:
Grade 1 = mild adverse event.
Grade 2 = moderate adverse event.
Grade 3 = severe and undesirable adverse event.Grade 4 = life -threatening or disabling adverse event.
Grade 5 = death.

0.3.2 Attribution Definitions
For the purpose of this surveillance study , only AEs related to astudy -mandated procedure will be
reportable and by definition will always be assessed as related. The degree of certainty about
relatedness will be graded using the 2 categories below.
T
able 12.3.2 Attribution of Adverse Events
Code Descriptor Relationship (to study procedure )
RELATED CATEGORIES
2 Possibl y
RelatedThe adverse event has a reasonable possibility to be
related; there is evidence to suggest a causal
relationship.
3 Related The adverse event is clearly related.
10.4 Co
llection and Recording of Adverse Events
10.4.1 Collection Period
Adverse events will be collected from the time of first procedure , until aparticipant completes the study ,until
48hours after he/she prematurely withdraws ,or is withdrawn from the study.
10.4.2 Collecting Adverse Events
Adverse events (including SAEs) may be discovered through any of these methods:
• Interviewing theparticipant through specific questions that will be incorporated in the study questionnaire s
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the participant
10.4.3 Recording Adverse Events
Throughout the study, the clinical site investigators will record adverse events and serious adverse events as
described previously (Sections 10.2.1, 10.2.2) on the appropriate AE/SAE eCRF
Once recorded, an AE/SAE will be followed until it resolves with or without sequelae, or until the end of study
participation, or until 48hours after the participant prematurely withdraws or is withdrawn from the study,
whichever occurs first.

A pregnancy will not be reported as an AE and is not an exclusionary condition for this surveillance study
10.6 Review of Safety Information
10.6.1 Medical Monitor Review
The DAIT/NIAID Medical Monitor willreceive monthly reports from the Statistical and Clinical Coordinating
Center ( SACCC) compiling new and accumulating information on AEs and SAEs recorded by the study site(s ) on
appropriate eCRFs .
The DAIT/NIAID Medical Monitor will also assess whether a study stopping rule has been met and will
recommend either halting of the study for review of the safety information or study termination .
11. Statistical Considerations and Analytical Plan
11.1 Ov
erview
A prospective longitudinal cohort of children and their families will allow us to estimate the incidence of SARS -CoV-2
infection and investigate the association of risks factors for infection while accounting for follow -up and censoring. This
study will permit us to gain insights into the complex interaction o f SARS-CoV-2 exposure, particularly within families,
with participant sex, age, susceptibility, immunological profiles and clinical outcomes.
11.2 Analysis Plan
Population descriptionBaseline characteristics of 2000 index children and their families that include age, sex, household members, co -
morbidities, proportion with evidence of SARS-CoV- 2 infection at baseline, and follow -upwill be described using
standard statistical techniques such as proportions for categorical variables and means and standard deviations (SD) ,or
medians and interquartile ranges as appropriate.Primary outcome: The cumulative incidence of SARS -CoV -2 RNA detection in nasal samples among index participants
and their household contacts over the study period
T
ime to event analyses will be conducted among participants that are SARS -CoV-2 serologically negative at entry . We
will use Kaplan-Meier cumulative morbidity curves for the primary analysis. The primary endpoint will be calculated at
the end of follow-up orfate defined as follows. Follow -up time will be the time from entry until the first of the following
events:
• Tests positive for SARS-CoV -2RNA in nasal samples
• Is lost to follow -up or withdraws from the study
• End of study (24 weeks)
Fa
te at the end of follow -up will be:
• 1(positive): if the patient tests positive for SARS-CoV- 2.
• 0 (censored): if the patient has no evidence of having had disease by the end of follow -up.
Confi dential Page 23of24
HEROS   Version 3 .0                                                                                         09/02/2020  Attack rates
SARS -CoV-2 attack rate per person -week will be calculated. Attack rates within families will also be estimated.
S
econdary outcome: time to the index participants and their household members with detectable SARS -CoV -2-
specific antibodies in serum over the study period.
Co
xregression on seroconversion status at 24 weeks: Hazard ratios will be mo deled using Cox Regression to compare
demographic and clinical factors toth e time to detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in serum.
11.3
Sample Size Calculations
Sample size considerations were based on the margin of error or precision. We plan to enroll and study 2000 index
children representing 2000 family units. Power estimates were based on precision represented with width of the 95%
confidence interval and using the Wilson interval (Software Stata version 16). Below are estimates for varying observed
incidence of SARS-CoV -2 infection among these 2000 family units:
3%,
the 95% confidence interval for the true incidence as 2.3% --3.84%;
5%, the 95% confidence interval for the true incidence as 4.1% --6.0%;
10%, the 95% confidence interval will be as 8.7% --11.4%
and 20% this confidence interval will be 18.3% -21.8%.
12. Identification and Access to Source Data
12.1. Source Data
A source document is a document in which data are collected for the first time . In HEROS, the source documents are the
electronic case report forms (eCRFs) completed by the participants in an online electronic data capture system hosted
by Vanderbilt. Throughout the study, Vanderbilt will transfer deidentified HEROS data to the SACCC where deidentified
historic data imported from the index participant’s parent study will be merged with the HEROS data and laboratoryresults and stored.
12.2. Access to Source Data
The site investigators and site staff are bound to maintain the strict confidentiality of medical and research informat ion
that may be linked to identified individuals.
12.3 Genomic Data Sharing Policy
DNA from participants in the HEROS study will be stored for analysis that will be limited to studies of SARS -CoV-2
infection. The NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) policy requires deidentified genomic data from a NIH -funded study to be
shared via dbGaP. However, GDS provides an exception to allow for controlled access to the data. The protocol chair for
HEROs will submit a request for this exception which allows for deposition of summary (high level general) data with a
‘controlled access guard’ so that a future investigator would need to ask NIAID for permission to access the COVID -19
collected summary data and will be required to indicate that data analysis will be restricted to COVID -19 research.
13. Quality Assurance and Quality Control
The site principal investigator is required to keep accurate records to ensure that the conduct of the study is fully
documented. The NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) is responsible for regular inspectionof the conduct of the trial, for verifying adherence to the protocol, and for confirming the completeness, consistency,
Confi dential Page 24of24
HEROS   Version 3 .0                                                                                         09/02/2020  and accuracy of all documented data. On a frequency determined by DAIT/NIAID, a clinical moni tor from the SACCC will
conduct a review of the conduct of the study by remote data review. Site study staff and participants will complete
electronic case report forms and questionnaires online via a web-based electronic data capture system and data will be
stored remotely at a central database. Data quality will be ensured through the electronic data capture system’scontinuous monitoring of data and real -time detection and correction of errors. All elements of data entry (e.g., time,
date, verbatim text, and the name of the person performing the data entry) will be recorded in an electronic audit trail
to allow all changes in the database to be monitored and maintained. In addition, SACCC data managers and statisticians
will monitor data completeness and other elements of data quality throughout the trial and provide periodic reports on
data quality.
14. Protocol Deviations
Since this is a Public Healthy Surveillance study and not human subject research, we will not be collecting protocol
deviations. Missed samples and incomplete questionnaires are considered missing data.
15. Ethical Considerations
15.1. Informed Consent Process
The proposed prospective observational study fits the Public Health Surveillance exception at 45CFR46.102(l)(2). The
exception allows for no IRB involvement since the study would not be considered human subject research and therefore
not subject to the Common Rule. The informed consent is an information sheet about the study .The primary caregiver
of the participant will read the information sh eets and any questions will be addressed to the study investigators. If the
caregiver want sto continue with the surveillance study and each member of the household that will take part in the
study has reviewed and agrees with therequirements for participation in the information sheet, the caregiver will check
“yes” and continue into the study web portal .
15.2 Privacy and Confidentiality
A participant’s privacy and confidentiality will be r espected throughout the study. It is pos sible that the study team may
be required by law to share the s urveillance data , including individually identifiable information ,toa public health
authority other than the National Institute of Health. The Human Health Services protection of human subjec ts
regulations do not prevent investigators or institutions from fulfilling this requirement. The participants are informed
that the results from the study will be confidential to the extent permitted by law.
16. Publication Policy
A publication policy of study results will be developed by the study investigators and the data coordinating centers prior
to the completion of the study .

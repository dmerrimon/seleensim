 1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy that causes characteristic loss of visual fields and  can 
eventually lead to blindness. A major risk factor for glaucomatous visual field loss is  elevated intraocular 
pressure ( IOP); (The AGIS Investigators 2000 ). While numerous products are approved for use in the 
United States to lower IOP , the need for new options with improved efficacy is supported by several 
clinical  studies. Studies such as the Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial  (Heijl 2002 ), the Ocular Hypertension  
Treatment Study  (Kass 2002 ; Kass 2010 ), and the Collaborative Normal Tension Glaucoma Study Group 
(Collaborative Normal -Tension Glaucoma Study Group 1998 ) support the general conclusion that f or 
delaying disease progression, e very millimeter of reduction in IOP is significant. This conclusion  holds 
true not only for ocular hypertensive and glaucoma patients with elevated IOPs but also for glaucoma 
patients with IOPs in the statistically normal range.   In addition, f or many individuals with glaucoma, 
current IOP -lowering  medications are not sufficiently effective as monotherapy to achieve target IOP and 
the majority of glaucoma patients often need more than one drug to reach their target IOP  
(Lichter 2001 ). Increasing complexity of the dosing regimen often leads to decreased  compliance with 
dosing.    
 
Thus, the goal for treating patients should be to maximally lower the IOP, to the point that it prevents 
further damage to the optic nerve and achieve this without sacrificing safety or convenience  so as to 
maintain compliance . 
 
Inhibitors of Rho kinase (ROCK) have emerged as a new class of IOP -lowering agents .  Netarsudil 0.02% 
is a novel Rho kinase and norepinephrine transpo rter inhibitor developed at Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
Netarsudil lowers IOP through a distinct mechanism of action: increasing trabecular outflow by 
decreasing acto -myosin –driven cellular contraction and reducing production of extracellular matrix 
protei ns (Kazemi 2018; Lin 2018 ). In preclinical studies, netarsudil was shown to not only increase 
trabecular outflow facility ( Lin 2018; Wang 2015; Ren 2016; Li 2016 ), but also to decrease episcleral 
venous pressure ( Kiel 2015 ) and aqueous humor production ( Wang 2015 ). The mechanisms of action of 
netarsudil were further explored in a phase 1 study of healthy human volunteers, in whom netarsudil 
0.02% QD was demonstrated to lower IOP primarily by increasing outflow facility, but also by reducing 
episcleral venou s pressure ( Kazemi 2018 ). 
 
Prostaglandin analogues are another class of IOP -lowering agents that are highly effective at lowering 
IOP when dosed once daily in the evening, primarily acting on uveoscleral outflow.  
 
 As netarsudil lowers IOP through different mechanisms of action than prostaglandin analogues, 
netarsudil provides additional IOP -lowering eff icacy when used in combination with a prostaglandin 
analogue.  R ecently, ROCKLATAN® 0.02%/.005%  was approved by the United States Food and Drug 
Administration  for reducing elevated IOP. ROCKLATAN® 0.02%/0.005% is a fixed dose combination of a 
Rho kinase inhibitor and a prostaglandin F2α analogue indicated for the reduction  of elevated intraocular 
pressure (IOP) in patients with open -angle glaucoma  or ocular hypertension.  
 
Two randomized and controlled clinical trials enrolled subjects with IOP > 36 mmHg and compared IOP 
lowering effect of ROCKLATAN® dosed once daily (QD) to individually administered netarsudil 0.02% 
once daily and latanopro st 0.005% once daily.  Studies demonstrated 1 to 3 mmHg reductions in IOP 
greater than monotherapy  with either netarsudil 0.02% or latanoprost 0.005% throughout 3 months in one 
study and reductions were maintained throughout 12 months in the other study  (Rocklatan ™ Prescribing 
Information 2019 ). 
   
2. STUDY OBJECTIVE  
The objective of this study is to to evaluate the IOP lowering,  and number of agents/bottles required to 
achieve similar or additional IOP lowering with Rocklatan® in subjects  on a current regimen of latanoprost 
alone or latanoprost plus addition of either one or  2 IOP-lowering agent s.

 7.4.1 Women of Childbearing Potential and Acceptable Contraceptive Methods  
An adult woman is considered to be of childbearing potential unless she is at least 1 -year post -
menopause (no menses for 12 months or more without an alternative medical cause) or at least 3 months 
post-surgical sterilization. Subjects must not intend to b ecome pregnant during the study and must 
properly use an acceptable effective method of contraception.  
If a woman is of childbearing potential, she must have a pregnancy test performed at the visits specified 
in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures ( Appendix 5). Additional pregnancy tests may also be required 
per local regulatory guidelines. Subjects with positive pregnancy test result must be excluded f rom the 
study. Subjects with negative pregnancy test must agree to use an acceptable  effective contraception 
method during the study.  
Acceptable contraceptive methods when used consistently and in accordance with both the product label 
and the instruction s of the physician (Clinical Trials Facilitation Group 2014), include:  
1. Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition 
of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, or transdermal)  
2. Progestogen -only hormonal contra ception (oral, injectable, or implantable)  
3. Intrauterine device (IUD)  
4. Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
5. Bilateral tubal occlusion  
6. Vasectomized partner  [1]  
7. Sexual abstinence  [2]  
8. Male or female condom with or without spermicide  
9. Cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide  
 [1] Vasectomized partner is considered to be a highly effective birth control method providing that the partner is the 
sole sexual partner of the women of childbearing potential and that the vasectomized partne r has received a medical 
assessment of the surgical success  
[2] Sexual abstinence is considered to be an acceptable method of contraception when defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study interventions. The reliability of 
sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the subject  
 
Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coit us interruptus), 
spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
7.5 Visit 2 ( Week 6 ): Follow -Up  
Subject’s Visit 2 should occur in the morning (before noon) at a time similar to that of the 
Baseline Visit.  
The investigator (or designee) will perform/administer the following assessments : 
• Concomitant medications and/or  procedures review  
• Best corrected visual acuity (Snellen visual acuity chart)  
• Biomicroscopy  
• IOP assessment (morning measurement in each eye using Goldmann applanation 
tonometer)

 Please see “ Rocklatan ® Package Insert ” (Appendix 4) for further  details regarding possible adverse 
experiences associated with the use of study medication.  
8.2.2 Best Corrected Visual Acuity  
BCVA will be measured for both eyes by the investigator (or designee) at the Baseline Visit (Visit 1) and 
at both Visit 2 (Week 6 ) and Visit 3 (Week 12)  using a Snellen Visual Acuity Chart ( see Appendix 6 for 
detailed information on this examination).  
8.2.3 Biomicroscopy  
Biomicroscopy will be performed according to the site’s usual  practice by the investigator (or designee) 
for both eyes at the Baseline Visit and at each follow -up visit by slit lamp examination.  Eye 
structures/surfaces to be assessed include, but are not limited to, lids/lashes, conjunctiva (palpebral and 
bulbar), cornea, an terior chamber and lens.  All observations will be recorded. (see Appendix 6 for 
detailed information on this examination).  
8.2.4 Pregnancy Testing  
A urine hum an chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test (only for females of childbearing  potential ) 
will be used in th is study and performed at the Baseline  Visit to immediately confirm non -pregnancy 
eligibility for women  of child -bearing  potential.  
If pregnancy occurs during the study, the investigator must immediately notify the Ethics Committee/IRB 
and Aerie.   In addition, every attempt will be made to coll ect data on the pregnancy of female subjects. 
Signature of a separate consent form will be requested of the pregnant woman. Information  on pregnant 
partners of study subjects will not be collected.  
Every attempt will be made to collect data regarding the newborn child born to a female subject with 
parent/guardian permission. One parent or the legal guardian will be requested to provide permission for 
the minor to participate in this part of the research       
9. END OF STUDY

MA-ROC -22-003 Study , Amendment 1   Page 18 of 36 Final  30Sep2022  
 9.1 Completion of the Study  
Each subject who completes the entire Schedule of Visits as specified in this protocol will have completed 
the study.  
9.2 Subject Discontinuation  
A subject may be withdrawn from the study pr ior to completion for any reason  and categorized as follow s: 
• AEs 
• Lost to follow -up 
• Subject decides it is in his/her best interest to withdraw  
• Investigator decides it is in the subject’s best interest to be withdrawn  
• Noncompliance  
• Other (administrativ e reas ons, etc.) 
If a subject discontinues from the study for any reason at any point beyond  his/her Baseline Visit (Visit 1 ), 
he/she should be requested to return for a final visit at  which time all Visit 3 ( Week 12 ) procedures should 
be performed according to the protocol Schedule of Visits/ Procedures (see Appendix 5).   
Subjects who are prematurely withdrawn or discontinued from the study will not be replaced.  
9.3 Study Termination  
The study may be terminated by the investigator or the sponsor. If, in the opinion of the investigator, 
clinical observations made during the study suggest that it may be unwise to continu e, the investigator 
may stop the study. Study termination by the investigator will be reported to the sponsor.  
In addition, a written statement fully documenting the reasons for this action will be submitted to the 
sponsor  and the IRB  by the investigator w ithin 5 working days.  
In the event that the sponsor chooses to discontinue or terminate the study, appropriate notification will 
be given to the investigator.  
10. ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS AND REPORTING  
10.1 Adverse Events  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the administration of the study 
intervention in humans, whether or not considered related to the study medication.   AEs include any 
illness, sign, symptom, or clinically significant labora tory test abnormality that has appeared or worsened 
during the course of the clinical trial, regardless of causal relationship to the study medication(s) under 
study.  
Study medication is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or vehicle/p lacebo being 
tested or used as a reference in the study, whether masked or unmasked. AEs may be either 
spontaneously reported or elicited during questioning and examination of a subject.  
 
All AE s will be collected from visits 2 and 3 as well as upon subjec t report after visit  1, 
and will continue until the final protocol required visit and/or continue through resolution,  
stabilization, or the Investigator assesses them as chronic or stable or the subject’s  
participation in the trial ends, whichever occurs f irst.  Documentation of AEs will include AE description, 
start date and stop date, severity, relationship, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome.   
If a disease is known at the time an AE is reported, this diagnosis should be recorded rather than listing of 
individual symptoms. However, if a cluster of symptoms cannot be identified as a single diagnosis, each 
DocuSign Envelope ID: 46697C86-BCE1-491C-B7C3-35B002C4C496

 CONFIDENTIAL  
MA-ROC -22-003 Study , Amendment 1   Page 19 of 36 Final  30Sep2022  
 individual event should be reported separa tely. If a diagnosis is subsequently known, it should be 
reported as follow -up information.  
When recording an AE, the following information should be provided on the study AE CRF:  
1. Action Taken with Study Intervention:  
• None  
• Study Intervention Discont inued  
• Study Intervention Interrupted  
2. AE Outcome:  
• Fatal  
• Not Recovered/Not Resolved  
• Recovered/Resolved  
• Recovered/Resolved with sequelae  
• Recovering/Resolving  
• Unknown/Lost to follow -up 
Subjects experiencing AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of study medication, or those 
experiencing AEs that are present at the end of their participation in the study should receive follow -up, 
as appropriate. If possible, report the outcome of any AE that caused permanent discont inuation or that 
was present at the end of the study , particularly if the AE was considered by the investigator to be related, 
or possibly /unlikely  related to investigational product.  
AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization and reported as serious adverse events (SAEs) if 
they become serious ( Section  10.2). 
 
Adverse drug reactions that are both serious and unexpected (suspected unexpected  
serious adverse reactions [SUSARs]) will be subject to expedited reporting by the Sponsor  
to the FDA as req uired by the relevant regulations.  
10.1.1  Severity of Adverse Events  
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the level of discomfort or the degree of 
intensity of an AE as determined by the Investigator or reported to them by the subject. The  assessment 
of severity is made irrespective of study medication relationship or seriousness of the event and should 
be evaluated according to the following scale:  
Mild: present and noticeable, but not distressing, and no disruption of normal daily activities  
Moderate : bothersome, discomfort sufficient to possibly reduce or affect normal daily activity  
Severe : incapacitating, with inability to work or perform normal daily activity  
A change in increased severity for a reported AE will require a stop d ate for the previous severity and a 
new start and stop date for the new severity. For example, a change in severity may go from mild to 
moderate, or from moderate to severe. In either case, the start and stop dates should be recorded.  
Note: A severe AE is not the same as a serious AE. Seriousness of an AE (NOT severity) serves as a 
guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see Section 10.2 for further information on SAEs).  
10.1.2  Relationship of Adverse Events  
The relationship of the AE(s) to the study medication(s) must be specified by the investigator using the 
following definitions:  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 46697C86-BCE1-491C-B7C3-35B002C4C496

 CONFIDENTIAL  
MA-ROC -22-003 Study , Amendment 1   Page 20 of 36 Final  30Sep2022  
 Not Related : The event is clearly related to other factors , such as subject’s clinical condition , therapeutic 
interventions, concomitant disease , or therapy administered to the subject and does not follow a known 
response pattern to the product.  
Unlikely Related : The event is most probably caused by other etiologies . such as participant’s underlying 
condition, therapeutic intervention, or concomitant therapy; or the delay between administration and the 
onset of the AE is incompatible with a causal relationship. Therefore, there is not a reasonable possibility 
that the AE was caused by the study medication.  
Possibly Related : The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of study medication 
administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study medication but could have been 
produced by other factors , such as the subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions , or concomitant 
therapy administered to the subject.  
Related : The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of study medication 
administration and/or follows a  known response pattern to the study medication and cannot be 
reasonably explained by other factors , such as subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions , or 
concomitant therapy administered to the subject and either occurs immediately following stu dy 
medication administration, improves on stopping the study medication, reappears on repeat exposure, or 
there is a positive reaction at the application site.  
10.2 Serious Adverse Events  
SAEs or reactions are any untoward medical occurrence that, results in a ny of the following outcomes:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (defined as an event in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its 
occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. ) 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event (define d as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical and scientific 
judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require non -surgical or surgical intervention to 
preve nt one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above). Examples of such 
events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result  in hospitalization.  
Investigators must record all SAEs  using the appropriate CRFs . 
All SAEs, whether related or unrelated to study medication, must also be immediately reported by 
investigators to Drug Safety at ProTrials , Contract Research Organization  using one of the 
following mechanisms  within 24 hours of learning of the event : 
In addition, the governing Ethics Committee/IRB and  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc . (sponsor) must 
also be notified by telephone or confirmed facsimile transmission should an SAE occur.  
If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. Documentation of all SAEs 
must be maintained in the study files – e.g., Serious Adverse Event Form or equivalent form ( e.g., 
MedWatch Form). Should the investigator become aware of an SAE (regardless of its relationship to 
investigational product) that occurs within 30 days after stopping the study medication, the SAE must be 
reported in accordance with procedures specified in this protocol. In the event of death, if an autopsy is 
DocuSign Envelope ID: 46697C86-BCE1-491C-B7C3-35B002C4C496

 CONFIDENTIAL  
MA-ROC -22-003 Study , Amendment 1   Page 21 of 36 Final  30Sep2022  
 performed, a copy of the report should be sent to the Ethics Committee/ IRB. Aerie  will report any 
SAEs/serious adverse device effects to other invest igators, relevant competent authorities , and Ethics 
Committee/ IRB, as required by local health care authorities.  
The investigator(s) should always group signs and symptoms into a single term that constitutes a single 
unifying diagnosis.  The investigator’s opinion of the relationship of the SAE to study medication, the 
duration, intensity, frequency, serious criteria, countermeasures taken with study medication, and the 
outcome of the SAE should be documented.  
10.3 Pregnancy  
Women of childbearing  potential (See Section 7.4.1  for definition of women of childbearing potential ) must 
use an effective method of birth control during the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of 
failure is minimized. Prior to study enrollment, women of childbearing potential  must be advised of the 
importance of avoiding pregnancy during tr ial participation and the potential risk factors for an 
unintentional pregnancy.   
During the study, all women of childbearing potential  should be instructed to contact the investigator 
immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant ( e.g., missed or la te menstrual period). If pregnancy is 
suspected in any female subject while the subject is receiving study treatment, the study medication must 
immediately be withheld until the result of pregnancy testing is known. If pregnancy is confirmed, the 
study the rapy will be permanently  discontinued and the subject will be withdrawn from the trial. Protocol -
required procedures for those subjects that are discontinued from the study must be performed on the 
subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy ( e.g., x-ray s tudies).   
If pregnancy occurs during the study, t he investigator must immediately notify the Ethics Committee/ IRB 
and A erie.   In addition, every attempt will be made to collect data on the pregnancy of female subjects. 
Signature of a separate consent form will be requested of the pregnant woman. Information on pregnant 
partners of study subjects will not be collected.  
Every attempt will be made to collect data regarding the newborn child born to a female subject with 
parent/guardian permission.  One parent or the legal guardian will be requested to provide permission for 
the minor to participate in this part of the research  
11. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1 Sample Size  
The planned enrollment is approximately 180 subjec ts. 
11.2 Analysis Populations  
An intent -to-treat (ITT) population will include all subjects who were enrolled into the study . 
A modified intent -to-treat (mITT) population will include all subjects who were treated and had at least 1 
follow -up visit with a completed IOP measurement . 
A per -protocol (PP) population will include all subjects who completed 3 months of treatment without 
significant protocol violations. Subjects to be excluded from the PP analysis are subjects who have: 1) no 
efficacy evaluation at baseline, an d/or have no follow -up visit; 2) used any prohibited medications during 
the study period that would interfere with the study objectives; 3) had any prohibited procedures during 
the study period that would interfere with the study objectives.  
A safety popul ation will include all subjects who have received at least 1 dose of study medication . This 
population will be used to summarize safety variables and will summarize subjects as treated.

 Appendix 6 EXAMINATION PROCEDURES  
1. Best Corrected Visual Acuity  
At all study visits , BCVA  will be assessed in both eyes of each subject using a Snellen visual acuity  chart  
at a distance of 20 feet. 
Ensure subject is seated in a position whereby his/her eyes are 20 feet from the chart, which is hung on 
the wall at eye level. Mark a spot on the floor with a piece of tape to ensure subjects are seated in the 
exact same position every time they take the test. Also ensure subject is fitted with appropriate lenses as 
to provide “best correction” each time he/she takes the test. In order to standardize the conditions of the 
test as much as possible , all visual acuity testing should be performed in the same r oom under the same 
lighting conditions for every subject.  
Perform the test on the right eye first. Ask the subject to read each letter, line by line, left to right 
beginning with line #1 on the top of the chart. Subjects should be told that the chart conta ins only letters, 
not numbers. If the subject reads a number, he/she should be instructed that the chart only contains 
letters and for him/her to “try again.” Subjects should be asked to read the letters slowly as to achieve 
best identification of each let ter. There is no time limit for this test. Subjects are not to proceed to the next 
letter (or line) until they have given a finite answer.  
If a subject changes a response ( e.g., that should be a “C” not an “O”) before he/she has read the next 
letter, the c hange will be accepted. If the subject attempts to change a response after reading the next 
letter in the series, the change will not be accepted.  
When the letters become difficult to read or if the subject identifies a letter as 1 of 2 letters, he/she sho uld 
be instructed to choose 1 letter and, if necessary, to guess. The examiner should consider the lowest line 
read with no more than 1 mistake as the extent of a subject’s visual acuity. This visual acuity should then 
be recorded (in Snellen units, e.g., 20/70) on the appropriate CRF. 
Repeat for the left eye.  
 
2. Biomicroscopy  
Any findings from the gross examination will be recorded in this section on the CRF.  Slit lamp 
biomicroscopy  will be performed by the investigator (or designee) according to the site’s usual  practice  
during the study.  Observations for the slit lamp biomicroscopy examination will be graded as follows:

 3. Intraocular Pressure  
NOTE: The examination procedure described below are to be completed for both eyes.  
IOP should be measured by the investigator (or designee) in each eye using a Goldman n applanation 
tonometer affixed to a slit lamp. Measurements will be recorded on an appropriate CRF.  
Please ensure tight -fitting neck wear has been loosened prior to initiating the examination. Both eyes will 
be tested, with the right eye preceding the left.  
Instill 1 drop of topical anesthetic ( e.g., Ophthetic®) into each eye and wait 4 minutes before continuing 
with the test procedure.  
 
Test Procedure:  
1. With the subject seated, both he/she and the slit lamp should be adjusted so that the 
subject’s head is firmly positioned on the chin rest and against the forehead rest without 
leaning forward or straining.  
2. Look through the binocular viewer of the slit lamp at low power making sure the tension knob 
is pre -set to the low -pressure value (4 -6 mmHg).  
3. Follow the image of the fluorescein -stained semicircles while rotating the tension knob until 
the inner borders of the fluorescein rings touch each other at the midpoint of their pulsation in 
response to the cardiac cy cle. 
4. When this image is reached, remove your fingers from the tension knob and record the IOP 
reading along with the time of day in the CRF. 
Please note:  
• IOP readings should not be adjusted for corneal thickness.  
• The tonometer should be calibrated prior to  or at the Baseline Visit (Visit 1) and calibration 
should be documented.  
 
4. Pregnancy Testing  
A urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test (only for females of childbearing potential ) 
will be used in this study and performed at the Baseline Visit to immediately confirm non -pregnancy 
eligibility for women  of childbearing potential.

 8. Adverse Events  
At both Visit 2 ( Week 6 ) and Visit 3 (Week 12) , the investigator (or designee) will question each subject 
regarding adverse experiences that may have occurred since a previous visit. Subjects will be queried 
“How are you feeling?” and all AEs will be recorded in the CRFs, including severity, action tak en, and 
relationship to study medication.
